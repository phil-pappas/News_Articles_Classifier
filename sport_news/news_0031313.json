Erick Fernandez Editorial Fellow, HuffPost Sports Posted: 10/12/2015 11:17 AM EDT | Edited: 11 minutes ago \nMets fans are understandably an emotional bunch right now. They have dealt with a lot of losing in the past, especially in the past nine years, and their shortstop, Ruben Tejada, just got his leg broken by Gotham's latest villain, Chase Utley. \nBut until Sunday morning, no one had adequately expressed just how pained Mets fans can get. That's when the instantly legendary \"Will from Queens\" called up Mike Francesa's radio show and, well, ladies and gentlemen, he lost it. \n\"Harvey better step up tomorrow night,\" Will from Queens said as his emotions were building up. \"This is his one chance. Put the team on your shoulders and you got my faith back in you.\" \n\"He has to do it tomorrow night,\" Will from Queens then said as he fought back tears. \"I want to see it done tomorrow night. Thank you...\" he trailed off. \n\"Will, are you crying? Not really crying over theres, I hope? Geez,\" Francesa replied. \"Geez, I think Will was crying. Sounded scary. Will, come on. Calm down, it's Sunday morning.\" \n\"Glad I'm not spending the day with Will, that would be a tough day,\" he added. \nWill from Queens is the best.
