UW FOOTBALL | NOTES Badgers football notes: Corey Clement gives it a go but misses sixth straight game JASON GALLOWAY and JIM POLZIN 16 hrs ago 0 STEVE APPS — State Journal \nCorey Clement and   celebrate a touchdown in the fourth quarter. Clement is recovering from sports hernia surgery. \nEvery sign pointed to the return of running back Corey Clement to the   football team on Saturday. \nThe junior warmed up in full pads. He took the first reps at his position during offensive walk-throughs. He even led the Badgers out of the Camp Randall Stadium tunnel just before the kickoff of the 24-7 victory over Purdue. \nClement never entered the game, though, opting to spend another week recovering from sports hernia surgery. \n“He was not ruled out,”   “We could have played him today, but as it went on and doing what’s best for Corey, and after warmups and sitting, decided not to go with him.” \nClement has not played since the season opener against Alabama and had surgery 21/2 weeks ago. \nThe Badgers once again struggled to run the ball without him Saturday, gaining just 96 yards on 37 carries. \nDare Ogunbowale, UW’s starter while Clement is out, said Clement made the decision to sit out. \n“He’s holding himself back,” Ogunbowale said. “It’s all based on how he feels. He’s not going to go out there if he doesn’t feel 100 percent. \n“He practiced this week and he thought he would be able to go, but he just didn’t feel that he would have been doing the team a good service not being 100 percent.” \nIngold shines \nTrue freshman running back Alec Ingold strolled into the end zone untouched for a 4-yard touchdown run on UW’s opening drive of the game. \nThe degree of difficulty increased quite a bit for Ingold’s second score of the game, a 1-yard run on fourth down midway through the fourth quarter that completed the Badgers’ scoring. \nWhen Ingold took a handoff from senior   at the 5, the road to the end zone was filled with potholes. Purdue defensive end Evan Panfil had a clear shot at Ingold in the backfield but missed. Ditto for cornerback Anthony Brown, who at least got an arm on Ingold at the 3. \nAndy James Garcia had the best shot at bringing down Ingold, who ended up carrying the Purdue linebacker the final 2 yards into the end zone. \n“I wasn’t really thinking much,” Ingold said. “It was all instincts at that point. I just had to do what the coaches trust me to do on that fourth down.” \nStave didn’t see the play because he was carrying out a fake naked bootleg. But he watched the replay and was impressed. \n“That very easily could have been a 3-yard loss there,” Stave said. “He made the guy miss, he made another guy miss, kind of spun and kept pushing and he eventually pushed it in. That was big for us.” \nIngold, who also scored a touchdown last week against Nebraska, has given a depleted UW tailbacks group a lift since being moved over from linebacker last month. \n“Three months ago, no one was asking about me,” Ingold said. “No one wanted to see what I was doing on a Saturday night. It’s pretty interesting. It’s been a whirlwind, but I’m grateful for it.” \nO-line shifts again \n  elbow) did not play, forcing the offensive line into its fifth combination of starters this season. \nLeft   moved to center, Micah Kapoi started at left guard and Walker Williams played right guard. \n“I thought it went pretty well,” Deiter said. “There’s a lot of stuff I could have done better, but I took a lot of reps (at center) in practice. It felt pretty natural for the most part.” \nAccording to UW, Voltz was available to play in an emergency situation. \n7-DB package \nUW’s defense introduced a new package that featured seven defensive backs, four linebackers and zero defensive linemen. \nThe seven defensive backs were cornerbacks Sojourn Shelton, Darius Hillary, Derrick Tindal, Tanner McEvoy, Michael Caputo, D’Cota Dixon and Arrington Farrar. \nVince Biegel, Joe Schobert, Chris Orr and T.J. Watt were in at linebacker. \nThe Badgers ran the package twice on third down in the first half, both times forcing punts. \nFarrar, who mentioned UW also used it a couple times late in the game, said the package was introduced Tuesday or Wednesday during the week. \nExtra points \nTindal left the game early in the fourth quarter with a right knee injury and did not return. Chryst believes it’s just a bruise. … Running back Taiwan Deal, who suffered a left ankle injury against Nebraska last week, did not play. … Andrew Endicott, who handles kickoffs, limped off the field after a kickoff in the second quarter. Chryst said there was no update on his injury. \nContact Jason Galloway at jgalloway@madison.com or 608-252-6174 and Jim Polzin at jpolzin@madison.com or 608-252-6473.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T12:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T05:15:55.013+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
