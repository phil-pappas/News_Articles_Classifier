Image 21 of 21 Fox fires 69 in first day of state qualifier 1 / 21 Back to Gallery Altamont\nMost of the field beat the rain Tuesday in the Section II state golf qualifier at Orchard Creek, but a bigger issue will be whether they can beat Austin Fox .\nAfter winning the Section II Class A individual title last week at Eagle Crest, Fox, a sophomore at Bethlehem, fired a 2-under par 69 Tuesday to take a two-stroke lead heading into Thursday's final round of the championship.\n\"He's a much smarter player than he was last year, and it shows,\" Bethlehem coach Dick Villa said. \"If he hits a bad shot, which rarely happens, he knows how to do damage control. He's a birdie machine out there, too. If his putter's hot, he's got a lot of putts that are very makeable.\"\nFox carded six birdies in a round that was completed by most of the 48-player field before some mild rain arrived in the afternoon. The top 20 — anyone shooting 80 or lower — advanced to the final 18 holes Thursday, when dry weather is predicted.\n\"If it's dry out here, you can throw it out a long way,\" Fox said, \"but if it's wet, it will stop right where it is. It was in between today. We got in before the rain, so I didn't have to deal with it.\"\nTommy McPartlon of Shenendehowa is two shots behind Fox after shooting an even-par 71. He made the state team last year as a sophomore.\n\"You have to be smart here,\" said McPartlon, one of three players from his school to advance. \"You have to pick where you need to land your shots, and you have to think overall what you want to do instead of just what's in front of you.\"\nFox, who failed to qualify for this event last year, started out with back-to-back bogeys before getting the birdie train started on No. 4.\n\"I was thinking, 'Control the damage, try to make pars now,' \" Fox said, \"but I made a birdie and kept it going the whole round.\"\nHe will be trying to match a feat his older brother Victor did twice for Bethlehem by winning the section's individual championship. His brother, now a junior at the University of Maryland , won in 2011 and 2012.\n\"I don't think it's fair to compare them,\" Villa said. \"They're both great players. I was privileged to watch Vic. He was one of the best to ever play in the section. Vic's helped mentor him, but Austin's his own person. He's blazing out his own territory.\"\nAustin Fox (Bethlehem) 69\nTommy McPartlon (Shenendehowa) 71\nKyle Adams (CBA) 72\nJack O'Hara (CBA) 73\nAdam Desorbo (Fonda) 74\nOwen Jones (Burnt Hills)
