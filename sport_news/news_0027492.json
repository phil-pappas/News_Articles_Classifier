Royal - Texas Memorial Stadium.\nThe Cowboys' offense enters the game with sophomore quarterback Mason Rudolph, who has thrown for 947 yards and five touchdowns. Oklahoma State's defense is led by junior safety Jordan Sterns and redshirt junior defensive end Emmanuel Ogbah.\nA Cowboys' win would keep them undefeated in 2014.\nWhen Texas has the ball\nThe Longhorns will continue to use Heard to their advantage. The 'juice's' legs helps keep defenses at bay as they're forced to respect Heard's option to run or pass.\nTexas will keep senior running back Johnathan Gray involved in the offense. He only received 11 carriers but was able to turn that into 46 yards and two touchdowns against the Golden Bears. He also made four big receptions for 71 yards. Expect it to use sophomore running back D'Onta Foreman, who scored a touchdown with 47 yards against the Golden Bears, and Gray against Oklahoma State.\nWhen the Longhorns have the ball, they'll look to get it into the hands of its playmakers: senior wide receiver Daje Johnson, sophomore wide receiver Armanti Foreman and freshman John Burt. The trio combined for 280 receiving yards against California.\nWhen Oklahoma State has the ball\nRudolph has been impressive in 2015. He's been able to throw five touchdowns in the three games. He'll look to exploit a reeling Texas defense that has given up 271.1 passing yards per game. Rudolph will try to get the ball into the hands of his favorite wide receiver redshirt senior David Glidden. Glidden has recorded 12 receptions for 283 receiving yards.\nThe Cowboys will also look to exploit Texas' porous rushing defense that ranks No. 119 in the nation. Oklahoma State will use junior running back Chris Carson in its running attack. Carson has run for 235 yards and three touchdowns.\nPrediction\nOklahoma State's defense has yet to be tested and Heard has shown he's tough to stop. The Longhorns have an opportunity to prove that last week's 650 yard and 44 point game wasn't a fluke. Texas' defense also has an opportunity to show improvement against the Cowboys. But the Longhorns' will have their struggles against Rudolph and the Oklahoma State offense. Saturday's game will be another high-scoring affair as both offenses will put up big numbers. But this week Texas will be able to finish the job against the Cowboys. 'The Juice' will run loose against Oklahoma State and lead the Longhorns to a much-needed win.\nPrediction: Texas 38, Oklahoma State 35\nOn Twitter:\n @Nick_Castillo74", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/Nick_Castillo74"], "published": "2015-09-24T20:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T13:45:44.484+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
