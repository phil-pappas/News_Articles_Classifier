Two days later in Edmonton, the Oilers got one just 1:36 in from Lauri Korpikoski to break open the scoring.\nEdmonton's Teddy Purcell stood at the red line and shot a puck into the offensive zone that hit the end boards and bounced back into the slot. Taking a better lane to the rebound and outhustling Blues defenseman Carl Gunnarsson, Korpikoski gathered the puck just in front of goalie Brian Elliott and slipped it past him for a 1-0 Oilers' advantage.\nBut the Blues had a quick response, with Jori Lehtera scoring his first goal of the season for the equalizer.\nLehtera's line rode into the offensive zone together. The puck went in a direct line from Lehtera to Jaden Schwartz to Troy Brouwer, who put a shot on goalie Cam Talbot. The rebound ricocheted to Talbot's left, where Lehtera was standing and knocked in the second chance for a 1-1 tie just 3:14 into the period.\nThe Blues' penalty-killing unit kept them in the first period of Tuesday's game against Calgary, killing off three of the four minors.\nThe PK was put to work in the second period Thursday against Edmonton, as Colton Parayko and Tarasenko were whistled for back-to-back penalties. When Tarasenko exited the box, the unit was three for three against the Oilers, and a short time later, Tarasenko made amends.\nIn every game this season, the Blues have kept the top line of Tarasenko, Stastny and Steen together. But with 4:02 left and a face-off looming in the offensive zone, Hitchcock sent out the \"STL Line\" of Schwartz, Lehtera and Tarasenko, who were magical at times last year.\nWell, the Blues pulled another one out of their hat with the STL Line on the ice.\nThe NHL's No. 1 faceoff team going in Thursday's game had won just 13 of 35 draws before Lehtera and Edmonton's Mark Letestu dropped into the dot. They battled, the puck popped loose, and an alert Jay Bouwmeester pushed it back to Tarasenko, who was at the top of the circle.\nOr should we say kneeling?\nWith Tarasenko's left knee touching the ice, he ripped a shot estimated at 55 feet that sizzled past Talbot. A big smile unfolded on Tarasenko's face, and he pumped his fist, as the Blues built a 2-1 lead with 3:59 left in the second period.\nThey went into the second intermission with that advantage, but added to it after Edmonton's Mark Fayne was whistled for holding just 3:09 into the third period.\nSet up in the offensive zone, Steen feathered a pass just over the top of the crease and Stastny was standing in perfect position to punch the puck past Talbot for his first of the season and a 3-1 lead.\nHall cut it to 3-2 when, after a face-off, Parayko failed to corral a loose puck. The Oilers forward zipped past Gunnarson and beat Elliott for a 3-2 game.\nBut Elliott finished with 24 saves for his sixth straight win over Edmonton. The Blues improved to 2-1 on their season-long, six-game road trip, which will continue Friday in Vancouver.\n(c)2015 St. Louis Post-Dispatch\nVisit the St. Louis Post-Dispatch at www.stltoday.com\n ", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/hockey/s-1738503&hashtags=ArcaMax", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/hockey/s-1738503&h=Blues+hold+off+Oilers%2C+4%2D2", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/hockey/s-1738503"], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T08:03:50.950+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
