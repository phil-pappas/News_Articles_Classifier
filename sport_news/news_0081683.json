Dickey will try to get the Blue Jays even in the best-of-seven series this afternoon. He faces Kansas City’s 6-foot-10 right-hander Chris Young in Game 4. \nRyan Goins also homered and had a two-run single a game after his misplayed pop fly set off Kansas City’s winning seventh-inning rally Sunday. \nThe resilient Royals tried to come back this time, too. Kendrys Morales capped a four-run surge with a two-run homer before Roberto Osuna closed it out. \n“We’re just going to keep fighting,” Kansas City outfielder Alex Gordon said. \n“We’ve got a lot of competitors on this team and that’s what you see.” \nEven with a big lead, Tulowitzki lost his cool. He was given a rare playoff ejection for arguing balls and strikes before the top of the eighth. \nTulowitzki, who struck out looking in the seventh, was restrained by teammates as he argued with plate umpire John Hirschbeck when the Blue Jays took the field for the eighth. Gibbons and bench coach DeMarlo Hale also came out to break it up. \nDespite being outhit 15-11 by the pesky Royals, Toronto pounced on Kansas City’s pitching in the first ALCS game at Toronto since 1993 for their most runs ever at home in the postseason — after scoring just three in two games in Kansas City. \n“You could not tell in the clubhouse if we’re down 0-2 or up 2-0,” winning pitcher Marcus Stroman said. “What we have is extremely special. The confidence that everybody has with everybody is amazing.” \nSeemingly not distracted by the contentious federal elections that were being held in Canada on Monday, 49,751 fans serenaded Cueto with a sing-song “Cueto-Cueto!” chant from the game’s first pitch and never quieted down. \nThe Royals took a quick lead when Alcides Escobar opened the game with a triple and scored on Ben Zobrist’s grounder. But that was the only advantage Kansas City held in having its nine-game ALCS winning streak snapped. The string dated to the 1985 series against Toronto. \nBlue Jays center fielder Kevin Pillar quashed that rally with a fantastic, over-the-shoulder catch that sent him crashing into the wall. \nAfter an easy first, Cueto appeared flustered by the crowd. Eleven of his remaining 13 batters reached and at one point in the third inning he threw his hands up in frustration after gesturing for a new cycle of signs from catcher Salvador Perez. \nGoins singled in two runs in the second after Tulowitzki singled with one out and Russell Martin was hit by a pitch that knocked off his left elbow guard. Goins pulled into second on the throw home and shouted and pumped his arms.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T08:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T11:10:22.199+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
