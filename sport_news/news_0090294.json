Outfielder Junior Felix, who became a regular at age 21 in 1989. Reliever Mike Timlin made his mark as a rookie with the 1991 Jays, pitching more than 100 innings in relief. Infielder Jeff Kent emerged the next year, allowing the Jays to deal him for David Cone. And in 1993, reliever Danny Cox was signed, pitching more than 80 innings — the most of any reliever that season — in a supporting role for Duane Ward after Henke departed to the Rangers as a free agent. And this year?\nWho would be Johnson’s pick as his old team heads into Game 5 of the best-of-five American League Division Series against the Rangers at 4:07 Wednesday afternoon at the Rogers Centre?\nWell, he’d have a few candidates.\nDid you figure back in February that centre fielder Kevin Pillar would turn into one-part Jim Edmonds and one-part Lenny Dykstra?\nPillar is the guy with skin ripped off his knees and elbows from diving in, left, right or climbing up and over the wall — or just crashing into it.\nThe way general manager Alex Anthopoulos and his staff drew it up, Michael Saunders, acquired from the Seattle Mariners for lefty J.A. Happ, was going to play left and Mississauga’s own Dalton Pompey, who had an impressive September in 2014, would be the every-day centre fielder.\nSaunders was felled by a sprinkler head in Dunedin, eventually made nine starts and then was forced to shut it down. Pompey was demoted after one month.\nPillar went from a projected back-up role to being the left fielder to THE centre fielder.\nAnd with Pillar in centre, Chris Colabello, Danny Valencia and Ezequiel Carrera spent time in left field until Ben Revere arrived at the non-waiver trade deadline on July 31.\nPillar made 155 starts in all — 139 in centre, 13 in left and three in right. He played in 158 games, thanks in large part to his outstanding defence — the good folks at baseball-reference.com say Pillar’s WAR (5.2) is second on the Jays behind Josh Donaldson (8.8) and ahead of Jose Bautista and Edwin Encarnacion.\nPillar is more than a pretty glove. His off-season workouts increased his speed — he was an impressive 25-for-29 stealing. He hit 31 doubles, 12 homers with 56 RBI, .278 average and a .713 OPS.\nOr as surprises go, is Colabello your choice?\nThe Jays watched him go 8-for-12 in three games with four doubles and five RBI in Minneapolis last April. Colabello hit .667 for the series — two Twins wins — and had a 1.714 OPS.\nWhen the Twins put Colabello on waivers on Dec. 8, the Jays claimed him. He started this season at triple-A Buffalo and made his Jays debut on May 5.\nWhile not a left fielder, Colabello’s best position is the batter’s box.\nAt the end of May, he was hitting .368. People said he wouldn’t be able to keep it up.\nAt the end of June, he owned a .335 average. His own father said he wouldn’t maintain the pace.\nAt the end of July, he was down to .312. Baseball people said he could not maintain it.\nWell, by the final day of August, he was hitting .324.\nHe kept it up, hitting .321 with 19 doubles, 15 homers, 54 RBI and an .886 OPS.\nOr maybe your choice is right-hander Marco Estrada, whom coach Pete Walker has pitching up in the zone more as he held opponents to the lowest batting average in the American League. This from a guy who allowed the most homers in the National League last year.\nBesides going 13-8 with a 3.37 ERA, he held opposing hitters to a .203 average. He allowed 24 doubles, 24 homers and a .633 OPS.\nOr maybe you like Dioner Navarro, who lost his starting job to Russell Martin again, but not his passion for soccer or the Jays.\nOr Aaron Sanchez, a starter and now in the bullpen.\nOr Roberto Osuna, who was at class-A Dunedin a year ago, and had 20 saves this season.\nELLIOTT\nJays' Pillar, Colabello headline list of pleasant surprises\nBy Bob Elliott , Toronto Sun First posted: Tuesday, October 13, 2015 04:34 PM EDT | Updated: Tuesday, October 13, 2015 04:45 PM EDT\nBlue Jays scout Wilbur (Moose) Johnson used to talk about his team each spring.\nAnd, after assessing the 40-man roster, he would always, always add: “And don’t forget, someone will surprise everyone.
