That was irrelevant, he said. He wanted to see each side get the best out of the other. The scout team would have to wait a few plays.\nFile that as yet another disruption from Campbell’s first 10 days on the job.\nUSA TODAY\nDallas Cowboys QB Branden Weeden: 'I'm pissed' about being removed as starter\n“I hope I’ve changed enough ,” Campbell told USA TODAY Sports Wednesday during a walk back to his office. “We need to go the other way and we need to go the other way fast. We don’t have an offseason to change what I feel like needs to be changed. So with that, you’re trying to get these guys to buy into what you want to do within a little more than a week.”\nTranslation: More modifications are coming.\nCampbell is taking a chance on change because he needs to. Miami’s first plan didn’t work, and it fired Joe Philbin Oct. 5 following a disappointing loss to the New York Jets in London that dropped its record to 1-3.\nBefore the season, the Dolphins – on paper, at least – were widely considered to be a team on the verge of a breakout, thanks to several high-profile offseason additions. Now, they’re hitting the reset button. That means their best shot at turning things around is a complete overhaul.\n“I’m certainly encouraged, just from going to practice,” executive vice president of football operations Mike Tannenbaum told USA TODAY Sports. “The validation has been just watching it every day. But that has to lead to better performance in games.”\nUSA TODAY\nBell: Former QBs shrug off Deflategate, still hold Tom Brady in high regard\nPhilbin’s tenure was marred by a lackadaisical culture that failed to foster competition and bred complacency. Inconsistent play led to a 24-28 record with no playoff appearances in three and a half seasons.\n“It’s tough when you lose a coach you’ve been with your entire career,” quarterback Ryan Tannehill told USA TODAY Sports. “But you have to play the hand you’re dealt. This locker room has bought in and everyone is on board.\n“We love Dan. We love the attitude and the energy that he brings. It’s contagious. You can already feel it in practice, just the energy and enthusiasm and competition. I can’t help but think that’s going to translate on Sundays.”\nCampbell, 39, is now the youngest head coach in the NFL, and there’s no denying that his promotion is a risk. He’s just six years removed from an 11-year career in the league and has just five years of coaching experience, all as Miami’s tight ends coach.\nUSA TODAY FANTASY SPORTS\nWeek 6 fantasy football rankings\nWhen asked what the hardest part about his promotion was, Campbell didn’t say it was firing assistants, crafting game plans, or dealing with a room full of young multi-millionaires whose season is in danger of unraveling.\n“Everything outside of football,” Campbell said, without hesitation. “Who sits where on the plane? What time are we going to leave on Saturday? What about food? How long do you want to serve food in the cafeteria? Those are things that have been more out of my comfort zone.”\nCampbell has sought guidance from veterans on his staff like Darren Rizzi, whom he promoted to assistant head coach, but given his inexperience, it won’t be a surprise to see some initial growing pains. Those could start as early as this Sunday when the Dolphins travel to Tennessee to face the Titans.\nTo combat those, Campbell has found comfort in – you guessed it – disruption.\nHe started one practice with a game of tug of war. The seldom-used Oklahoma Drill, which pits players against each other in a tight space, highlighted another. One morning last week, players showed up to work with the surprise that most of their lockers had been moved and organized by position group.\nUSA TODAY\nQB Rank, Week 5: Peyton Manning and the Broncos are in trouble\nBut as Tannenbaum said, the Dolphins need to show up on Sundays.\nTannenbaum declined to comment on whether Miami had a short list for its head coaching vacancy or whether the team had begun to approach replacements, though team owner Stephen Ross said in a conference call last week that Campbell “is certainly a candidate for the permanent job.”\nObviously, that depends on Miami’s performance in its remaining 12 games. But if there was one person on the current Dolphins coaching staff who could spearhead a complete overhaul, it was Campbell. His experience as a player carries respect in the locker room. When coupled with his seemingly endless supply of energy, it’s easy to see why Miami’s players feel rejuvenated.\n“I’ve been there,” Campbell said. “I’ve done that. I’ve sat where they sit. I know what makes them tick. I know what drives them. I know what wears them down. I know all those little things.”\nAs receiver Jarvis Landry added: “Man, that’s something that we really needed here.”\nFollow Lorenzo Reyes on Twitter @LorenzoGReyes .\nPHOTOS: Week 6 games ranked by watchability\n14.
