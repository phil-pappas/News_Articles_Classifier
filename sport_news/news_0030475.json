(Photo: MATTHEW DAE SMITH | for the Lansing State Journal) Buy Photo \nA week after moving into the top 10 in their respective divisions for the first time this fall, Grand Ledge and Corunna continued to climb up the state rankings. \nGrand Ledge moved up four spots and Corunna jumped two places in this week's Associated Press prep football poll, which is selected by a panel of sports reporters. \nCAAC Blue-leading Grand Ledge (7-0) moved up to No. 6 in Division 1, while GAC Red leader Corunna (6-1) is No. 8 in Division 4 in the latest rankings. \nCAAC White runner-up Lansing Catholic (6-1) and GLAC champion Lakewood (7-0) were the other area programs to move up in the poll this week. Lansing Catholic moved to No. 5 in Division 5 and Lakewood shares the No. 2 spot in Division 4 with Grand Rapids Catholic Central. \nGrand Ledge, Corunna, Lansing Catholic and Lakewood are among 10 mid-Michigan teams featured in the latest state poll heading into Week 8. \nIthaca remains No. 1 in Division 6 to lead all area teams, while Portland is still No. 2 in Division 5. \nOther area teams in the top 10 include CAAC Red champion DeWitt (No. 4 in Division 3), CMAC leader Pewamo-Westphalia (No. 4 in Division 7) and Fowler (No. 7 in Division 8). \nMorrice, which is 6-1, is among the teams receiving votes just outside the top five in the 8-man division rankings. \nContact Brian Calloway at bcalloway@lsj.com.
