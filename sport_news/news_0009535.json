She won 8-11, 13-11, 5-11, 11-7, 11-9. The Indian ace plays the fourth seed Alison Waters of England.\nWorld No.20 Joshana accounted for ninth seed Annie in surprisingly 28 minutes of tight play. The Indian national champion won in straight games 11-6, 11-7, 12-10. She next plays Omneya Kawy, the sixth seed from Egypt.\nSaurav was unlucky to have faced the third seed Gregory Gaultier of France in the very first match. Even he put up a good resistance, Gregory was far too strong to win 11-5, 11-6, 12-10.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T19:52:37.322+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
