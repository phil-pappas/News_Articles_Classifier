Any illusion coach John Fox still has about making the Bears competitive in his first year needs to start taking realistic shape Sunday at Soldier Field. If not, the Bears' planning for 2016 can take precedent over game-planning for any remaining opponents, if it hasn't already. Just in case Raiders quarterback Derek Carr ruins your weekend, remember the NFL draft begins April 28.\nAs for the Sox, their season mercifully will end after Game No. 162 against the Tigers amid all the broken promises and squandered potential. The moves general manager Rick Hahn made last winter that many of us hailed as shrewd or smart simply turned the Sox into one of the most disappointing teams in baseball, raising expectations never met as the franchise unacceptably missed the playoffs for the ninth time in the last 10 seasons.\nNow what?\nIt sounds so easy to say copy the Cubs and completely start over, but it's harder than anybody realizes to follow through with such a bold plan. Cubs President Theo Epstein didn't just catch lightning in a bottle this season; he illuminated a franchise dimmed by a losing tradition with bright ideas about how to draft and develop prospects in an environment conducive to sustained success. Epstein systematically turned the 2015 Cubs into the 2009 Blackhawks, a team clearly on the verge of something special and potentially historic. He gave Sox and Bears fans, their noses perpetually pressed to the postseason glass, good reason to wonder why they can't do what the Cubs did — however impractical that sounds.\nWhat Epstein did in orchestrating three seasons of losing after taking over in October 2011 represents the exception and not the rule in a major sports market, unprecedented in baseball and largely unrealistic for the Sox. The man immortalized in Boston got away with transparently announcing the tough times ahead because the two Red Sox World Series rings Epstein brought to town bought him the benefit of the doubt Hahn simply doesn't enjoy.\nHahn continues to navigate the Sox through that murky territory between rebuilding and reloading. A young core of quality starting pitchers led by Chris Sale again might persuade Hahn to avoid a total teardown and keep manager Robin Ventura and the current philosophy intact — a tack likely to infuriate Sox fans. Consequently, the Sox reside uncomfortably in baseball limbo, stuck in a nebulous area that guarantees them little but angst.\nIn the NFL, a Cubs-like approach for, say, the Bears would be incompatible because of how flipping veterans for young players would affect the salary cap, which isn't a worry for baseball executives. But neither the Bears nor the Sox find themselves in position to read from the Cubbie blueprint until they start hitting on first-round draft picks the way the Cubs have in recent years. As much as any factor contributing to a surprising summer — Joe Maddon, Jake Arrieta, Anthony Rizzo — drafting the right player drove the Cubs into the playoffs.\nConsider that from 2011-14, the Cubs’ first-round draft picks were, in order, infielder Javier Baez, outfielder Albert Almora, third baseman Kris Bryant and catcher Kyle Schwarber. Only Almora hasn’t been part of this magical season. Throw in shortstop Addison Russell, whom the A’s selected five spots after Almora at No. 11 and traded to the Cubs in the Jeff Samardzija deal, and you see how rare Epstein’s collection of high draft picks is.\nThe Cubs have fortuitously avoided the bust factor, something the Bears know well. Their first-round draft picks in the same four-year period were offensive lineman Gabe Carimi, linebacker Shea McClellin, offensive lineman Kyle Long and cornerback Kyle Fuller. To change the direction at Halas Hall, the Bears need 2015 first-rounder wide receiver Kevin White and whomever they draft first in April to have the type of impact Bryant and Schwarber did on the Cubs.\nFor a more direct comparison, look at the Sox's top first-round selection in the same four-year span: outfielder Keenyn Walker, outfielder Courtney Hawkins, shortstop Tim Anderson and pitcher Carlos Rodon. Besides Rodon, a future ace, the major-league clock has yet to start on the Sox prospects. And the rookies that emerged most this season on the South Side — Trayce Thompson and Tyler Saladino — were drafted in 2009 and 2010, respectively. You have to wonder if either player would have spent one day in the majors this season if he was in a Cubs organization loaded with young talent.\nThat's not criticizing the Sox as much as complimenting the Cubs for elevating their standards to a level the non-playoff teams in town don't look close to meeting.\ndhaugh@tribpub.com\nTwitter @DavidHaugh\nPrivacy Policy Chicago Cubs Chicago White Sox Chicago Bears Albert Almora Kris Bryant NFL Oakland Raiders", "external_links": ["http://www.tribpub.com/privacy-policy-and-your-privacy-rights/", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-560da470/turbine/ct-haugh-cubs-white-sox-bears-spt-1002-20151001"], "published": "2015-10-02T00:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T21:01:13.079+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
