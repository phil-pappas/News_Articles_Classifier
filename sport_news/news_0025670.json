One of them, a seemingly simple catch at mid-on, kept Dinesh Chandimal at the crease. \nHe was 14 not out at the time and went on to score an unbeaten 72 as he and Karunaratne built a partnership of 149 by the close of play. \nThe hosts won the toss and elected to bat as they looked to build up a big score on a bat-friendly pitch. \nBut the Windies' four-man seam attack provided some movement and tested openers Karunaratne and Kaushal Silva early on. \nThey ground out a 56-run partnership before Kemar Roach made a breakthrough with his last ball of the 17th over. \nRoach deceived Silva with a full length delivery and the opener edged behind to wicket-keeper Dinesh Ramdin for 17. Karunaratne ended the first session on 41 not out. \nKarunaratne grabbed his sixth half-century in Tests with a boundary past backward point off Jerome Taylor to keep the hosts on the front foot at the start of the second session. \nLahiru Thirimanne almost fell victim to an outside edge from a full delivery off Taylor but Darren Bravo fumbled at first slip. \nLeg-spinner Devendra Bishoo was brought into the attack and bagged a second wicket for the visitors in the 40th over. \nThirimanne was the man to go on 16 after he skied a short ball from Bishoo to midwicket and fielder Rajendra Chandrika took the catch to leave Sri Lanka on 101 for two. \nThe spin of Bishoo continued to trouble Sri Lanka and new man Chandimal should have been sent back to the pavilion in the 50th over. \nA flat delivery from Bishoo teased Chandimal into a badly-timed shot which Taylor dropped at mid-on and the hosts went into tea on 141 for two. \nThe Windies would pay for their lapses in the field after the break as Karunaratne picked up his third Test century in the 69th over, pushing through a short Bishoo delivery over midwicket. \nThe pair brought up a century partnership in the 73rd over before Chandimal claimed his third successive fifty-plus score at Galle two overs later. \nSri Lanka reached the close on 250 for two to put themselves in a strong position.
