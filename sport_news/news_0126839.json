Do Your Job. For many teams, those are empty words. They say them, but they can’t live up to them. The Patriots do an admirable — even amazing — job of both. The next man up for the Patriots always seems to be able to do his job. Consider what happened Sunday night in Indianapolis, against a Colts team that was a preseason pick of many to go deep into the playoffs; one that, after losing six straight to the Patriots — including an embarrassing, 45-7 thrashing in the AFC Championship Game last season — was determined to make a strong showing in front of the home fans. New England opened the game with Marcus Cannon at left tackle in place of Nate Solder, who last week was placed on injured reserve for the remainder of the season after tearing his biceps in the first half of the win over the Cowboys in Dallas. Cannon had come into that game and played capably, so there was every expectation that would continue against the Colts. But then, on the Pats opening possession, Cannon suffered a toe injury and went to the sidelines for the rest of the game. That required veteran right tackle Sebastian Vollmer to shift to the all-important left side, while Cameron Fleming, who had been activated from the practice squad only the day before, suddenly found himself the regular right tackle. And how did that work out? Well, although Tom Brady was sacked twice in the game, that was one less time than the Patriots got to Colts quarterback Andrew Luck. Not only was Luck sacked three times, but the Pats also put such consistent pressure on him that the Colts were called for holding six times. The Patriots, with a patchwork offensive line thrown together in the heat of battle, did a better job of protecting Brady than the Colts did Luck. What makes that even more impressive is the Patriots have been starting two rookies on their offensive line. One is left guard Shaq Mason, a fourth-round pick out of Georgia Tech, where pass protection is an afterthought in the Yellowjackets’ ground-oriented, option offense. The other is center David Andrews, who was undrafted out of Georgia, but has played every down this season for the Pats after projected starter Ryan Wendell was sidelined by a mysterious illness. Yet the Patriots keep rolling along, keep winning, as the Next Man Up keeps doing his job. Consider that not only did the Pats lose the NFL’s best cover corner, Darrelle Revis, in free agency to the Jets, but they also saw their other starting cornerback in Super Bowl XLIX, Brandon Browner, go the Saints, also in free agency. Yet young Malcolm Butler, whose startling interception at the goal line saved the Super Bowl, and Logan Ryan — the next men up — have stepped in and gotten the job done. Against a potent Colts attack featuring Luck and the likes of T.Y. Hilton, Andre Johnson and Frank Gore, the Patriots were without standout linebacker Dont’a Hightower, who was injured against the Cowboys. In his place, they plugged in Jonathan Freeny, signed as a free agent this year after having been primarily a special-teams player his first three seasons in the league with the Dolphins. That the Patriots can do this with such success is a tribute to coach Bill Belichick and his staff, and to the players, who quickly pick up what they need to learn to, yes, do their job. In New England, where the reigning Super Bowl champions are off to a 5-0 start, it doesn’t seem to matter who is the Next Man Up — he always is able to do the job.
