The people selling the house did not bother to clean up much and the place is a mess, but that is what you expected. You also are promised by the sellers that everything would be picked up and cleaned out before you move in and the sellers back out of that promise and you are stuck with the clean up duty yourself. You now have the keys to your new home and the amount of work that needs to be done is overwhelming. Oh, and you are a veteran of the United States Armed Services. \nYou just lived a very brief moment in the life of Army Veteran Chris Key. \nKey purchased a home in the New Washington community after moving from the Lima area. He received the keys with the promise that the house would be completely cleaned up and ready for him to move in and get to work. When he returned, he found the sellers left without cleaning anything up. \n\"The sellers' agent was not willing to help very much,\" said Steve Garberick, Key's realtor. \"In fact, they offered a small window of time when they would be available but never offered another time that suited Mr. Key. I was the realtor for Mr. Key and having had major hernia surgery, was in no shape to be able to lift much of anything and didn't know what to do.\" \nNew Washington is a tight knit community and a parent of a Buckeye Central football player caught wind of what Key was going through and came up with an idea of sending some football players out to get their hands dirty. \n\"I had my reservations knowing what teenage boys like to do on their own time did not usually include help picking up trash for a total stranger,\" Garberick said. \nSo, on Sept. 12, four of the Buckeye Central football team members went to help Key out at his new home. While they got their hands dirty, Derek Kalb, Nash Ehresman, Chris Key, Carter Bishop, and Avery Garberick put in a hard days work and also learned a little from Key. The group listed to Key talk about the glory days of high school football and the kids even shared their own stories with Key as a welcome to the community gesture. \n\"Avery actually mentioned it,\" Kalb said. \"It just seemed like the right thing to do and was a lot of fun to help out a community member. Just hearing his stories about when he used to play was a lot of fun after we were all done working. He told us about how much different football is today compared to back when he played.\" \nThe group of seniors and Key worked up a sweat and then held a conversation that lasted late into the evening. \n\"It was a very refreshing conversation with those boys,\" Key said. \"They did a nice thing for me and it showed what fine young gentlemen they are. They did not have to do that, but they came out and worked extremely hard.\" \nAvery Garberick, Steve Garberick's son, heard through his father the situation Key was left in and took the reins of the project. Bishop's mother also had a hand in the workings of the plans. It was a no brainer for the others to get involved. \n\"He was a veteran so he gave his life to helping us out when he was in the services,\" Avery Garberick said.\"Why not return the favor to a guy that gave so much to our country defending our freedoms? He cleaned it a lot before we got there but there was a lot of heavy stuff that he could not move. We all teamed up and picked up the stuff, threw it in the backs of our trucks and hauled it to be recycled.\" \nFor Bishop, it was more about his friends. \n\"I heard about how everything went down with him and it felt like a perfect situation to lend a helping hand and spend some time with my teammates,\" Bishop said. \nThe fact that Key was a veteran of the armed forces made the project that much more important to the seniors. It also helped that Key had some fun stories to tell the kids. \n\"It was cool to just try to help out a veteran and spend time with my teammates in the process,\" Ehresman said. \"Mr. Key was a very cool guy who had a lot of funny stories. We told him how our season was going. It was important for us as teammates to get to spend that time together. We have a lot of classes together and spend weekends with each other.\" \nKey is now enjoying his new home located in the country. The centrally located town is perfect for he and his fiancee as he travels to Upper Sandusky for work and she travels to Marion. \n\"We wanted a spot in the country and this was perfect for us,\" Key said. \"What we did not expect was for these young men to care so much for just some people moving in. it really shows the character of the New Washington community.\" \n\"This group of kids reminded me a lot of my days in high school athletics,\" Key added. \"We talked about how the friendships made on the football field will last a lifetime. I am still in contact with some of my teammates from when I played. These guys are a fantastic group of young men who will be friends forever. What they did for me, I will be grateful forever.\" \nSteve Garberick sees first hand the relationship the four seniors share as he is used to seeing all of them at his house very often. \n\"These boys are part of a very tight knit group of seniors and are always willing to give a helping hand,\" he said. \"From talking to them afterwards, I think they actually enjoyed it. It really made my day knowing these young men selflessly gave their time just like this veteran did many years ago. With all that is going on in the world today, I think we overlook those a little too much that served for our rights and freedoms.\" \njfurr@gannett.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T01:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T03:12:54.945+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
