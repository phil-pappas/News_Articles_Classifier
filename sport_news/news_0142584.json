We know we’re a good team in this locker room. That doesn’t mean, ‘Hey, give us the ring right now.’ There are a lot of good teams out there and we’re going to have to play good baseball.”\nThe Jays may have ended the season on something of a sour note, losing four of their last five games following a champagne-soaked division-clinching celebration.\nBut taken as a whole, their season was still something to behold. They led the league in scoring by 127 runs and their eye-popping +221 run differential was the best in the majors by a 99-run margin. They won more than two-thirds of their games after the all-star break, boast arguably the league’s best player in Josh Donaldson and best pitcher in David Price, became the most efficient team in the majors at converting balls in play into outs, and are just the fourth team in baseball history to have three different hitters with 39 or more home runs. So they have reason to be confident.\nBut how were they rewarded? With a date with the only team as hot as they were in the second half. The Rangers won nearly two-thirds of their games after the break, scoring more runs than every team but the Jays, while overtaking the Houston Astros for top spot in the AL West.\n“We’re hot for a reason, too,” said Jays’ reliever Mark Lowe, who twice went to the World Series with the Rangers in 2010 and 2011. “We’re at the top of our game. They’re at the top of theirs and it’s just a matter of going out and executing.”\nThe Rangers announced Tuesday that Yovani Gallardo, who shut out the Jays in two starts this season, will get the ball in Game 1 on Thursday against Price. In Game 2 on Friday it will be the Rangers’ own deadline-acquired ace, Cole Hamels, who will be matched against Marcus Stroman.\nManager John Gibbons said the decision was “obvious” to have Stroman follow Price. “Shoot, he’s been perfect since he’s been back.”\nThe 24-year-old right-hander has made four starts since his improbable return from what was initially believed to season-ending surgery to repair a torn ACL. He has allowed a total of just five earned runs in those starts and four extra-base hits.\n“He hasn’t been here long, but he’s really dominated the outings he’s had,” Gibbons said.\nFollowing Stroman will be Marco Estrada in Game 3 and R.A. Dickey in Game 4, if that game is needed. Both games will be played in Arlington. That leaves Price available to pitch in a potential Game 5 back in Toronto on Oct. 14.\nWhile they won’t officially announce their division series roster until Thursday morning, the Jays cleared up any outstanding questions Tuesday when Gibbons announced that lefty Aaron Loup will be the seventh man in the bullpen, while Dalton Pompey and Ezequiel Carrera both made the cut as extra outfielders.\nPompey, who grew up in Mississauga, made the roster thanks to his game-breaking speed. In seven pinch-running appearances in September, he scored five times. “He was a difference-maker for us,” Gibbons said.\nCarrera could also be used as a pinch runner late in games, while Loup was tapped ahead of some others to give Gibbons another left-handed arm besides Brett Cecil against the Rangers’ heavily left-handed lineup. The players squeezed out included veteran starter Mark Buehrle, relievers Ryan Tepera and Bo Schultz, as well as infielder Munenori Kawasaki and catcher Josh Thole.\nGibbons says he senses the anxiety and excitement in the city, but he feels relaxed heading into his first postseason as either player or manager.\n“You never know in the playoffs, everybody will tell you that,” he said. “But I feel confident in the group and I know they feel confident. Now we just gotta go out and play.”\nMore on thestar.com\nMeet your 2015 Blue Jays ALDS roster\nR.A.
