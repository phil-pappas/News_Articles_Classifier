Rodgers is making his ninth appearance at the Ironman World Championship. Jones is making his seventh.\n\"You have to love what you're doing,\" said Jones, 52, a veteran salesperson at Richardson Bike Mart.\nHe aspires to improve upon his 10 th place age group finish at the 2013 Ironman World Championships.\n\"I fell apart in the last 10K,\" he recalled.\" That's the worst part in Hawaii. That's the make or break point for most people. I want to do a little better this year.\"\nHe said he's spent more time on the bike this year. He also has focused on taking care of his body.\n\"The older we get, the more time we need to recover,\" he said. \"You concentrate on your key workouts and making sure you recovery and not trying to pack in everything. I still train five or six days a week, but I do more structured training. You have to keep things simple. I have to eat healthy and get enough sleep.\"\nRodgers, 55, will be making his ninth Ironman World Championship appearance. It actually will be his 12 th time to race at Kona. He's also competed in three Ultraman championships.\nHe aged up this year and had visions of making a podium appearance as the young guy in the 55 to 59-year-old age group. A pesky hamstring pull forced him to revise his plans since h e hasn't been able to run.\nInstead of pulling out of the race, Rodgers said he will race the swim and bike, and then he will walk the marathon. He's been training to walk fast. He's even done bricks in which he's ridden long on the bike and then walked for a few hours. He said he's in the best shape he's been in the past four or five years.\n\"This race is so important to me, and it's such an honor to qualify,\" he said. \"So instead of having a 10-hour time and placing 4 th or 5 th in my age group, I'll have a 13:30 time and finish in the dark.\"\nOn Twitter:\n @DFWRunning", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/DFWRunning"], "published": "2015-10-08T22:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T03:05:33.524+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
