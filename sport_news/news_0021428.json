It was a big penalty.\n\"I do not understand what the referee behind the goal does – he doesn't make a decision,\" Mourinho continued When it's 0-0 and such a penalty is not given it's a huge moment. Once more it was a game without luck. A little bit of luck and we would win.\"\nJohn Terry was in agreement with Mourinho over the penalty incident but was keen to look forward to Chelsea’s upcoming fixtures.\n\"The first half was better than the second,\" Terry said. We created a few chances; Willian's free kick that hit the bar and a penalty that was, for me, but was not given.\n\"But we move on. We will go back to the Bridge and move on. It's on us now. Maybe we could've got three points tonight. It's in our hands and we're comfortable with that.\"\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "http://www.goal.com/en-us"], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T08:50:47.510+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
