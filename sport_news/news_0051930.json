That lead kept coach Dave Kridler on his toes a bit. \n\"I actually became worried in the second half when it was still 1-0 that we were playing so hard that we could possibly play ourselves out of the game,\" Kridler said. \nBut it wasn't one of the leading scorers who made the game changing play, it was junior Taylor Massie. Massie scored the first goal of the game with 18:58 left in the first half, but it was the second goal that she wasn't even credited for that pushed the Black Bears to a 3-0 win. \nFreshman Claire Warschauer brought the ball down the right wing taking a shot on goal that the goalkeeper just stopped from crossing the line. There was a scrum in the middle and Massie got a foot on the ball, which deflected off a Dover defender and in the net. \n\"1-0 was a very scary lead. We all came into this game wanting to win this game and I knew that when my chance came I knew I had to be ready to hit the ball whenever she brought it back,\" Massie said. \"I was like this is the moment when I have to get this in the net, so we will get a better lead.\" \n\"Taylor is a really conscientious kid,\" Kridler said. \"Tonight was excellent it was kind of a breakthrough night for her.\" \nNot only for Massie, but it was a good night for the midfield and defense, too. Despite leading only 1-0 with 65 minutes passed, the midfielders Zoe Smalley and Mallory Giffin held their own, especially knowing their normal center midfielder, Danielle Muhleman, didn't play nearly as much as she usually does due to an ankle injury. \n\"We weren't sure if we even wanted to play her, but she acted as if she really wanted to give us something and she did,\" Kridler said. \"It turned out to be important to have her on the field.\" \nThe defense did what it normally does and locked down the back, as Smalley and Giffin did what they could and more to control the midfield. Giffin won whatever ball she could in the air, while Smalley was distributing the ball everywhere she could on the ground. \n\"(Giffin) is a very unsung player. She has a ways to go yet with her passing, but she never comes off the field. She wins balls for us everywhere on the field and she is sort of the heart and soul of our midfield,\" Kridler said. \"I thought (Smalley) played with more appetite than she has played with this year. She did a lot of good things for us in the middle.\" \nWith the score 2-0 going entering the final 10 minutes of the game, Dover pushed forward as much as possible, but to no avail. The Black Bears offense seemed to gain some extra energy and confidence after that second goal, which is something Dover surely didn't want, as the Black Bears offense has begun to hit its stride in recent games, totaling 14 shots on goal Wednesday also. \n\"We have amazing runners not he outside that can get down the line and then they end up with an amazing cross or shot,\" Massie said. \"They don't all go in, but as long as you keep shooting one of them has to go in.\" \nThe final goal of the game came from Warschauer, who scored off an indirect kick assisted by Zoe Smalley with 2:42 left in the game. \n\"This was an important milestone for us,\" Kridler said. \"We got our tenth win, to get redemption for a loss that we shouldn't have had. We are growing as a team.\" \nThe Black Bears will play Tri-Valley Saturday with a spot in the district final on the line. Tri-Valley defeated the Black Bears 2-1 on Oct. 10. \n\"We are really looking forward to that chance,\" Kridler said. \ncteaguerob@gannett.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T05:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T06:45:05.025+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
