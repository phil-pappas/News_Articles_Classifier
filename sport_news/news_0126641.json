It's a trend of collapses that started during their loss in last season's Super Bowl.\nThe Seahawks are 2-3 and remain firmly in the playoff hunt in the NFC. However, they are not trending upward. Their wins have come against two teams ( Chicago, Detroit) with a combined record of 2-8. And let's not forget that the win against the Lions was aided and abetted by a missed call by the officials.\nThe way in which the Seahawks have lost games this season is familiar. They possess a lead late in the game, and the defense can't hold the lead against a pass-happy quarterback.\nThe Seahawks are allowing an average of 214.2 passing yards a game, 26th in the league. Teams are completing 67.9 percent of their passes against the Seahawks, which ranks 27th in the league. The Seahawks have picked off one pass this season.\nDuring their 27-24 overtime loss at Cincinnati, the Bengals mounted four scoring drives in the fourth quarter and overtime (two touchdowns and two field goals). Cincinnati quarterback Andy Dalton completed 10-of-11 passes and the Bengals offense gained 146 yards in the fourth quarter.\nOpponents have targeted cornerback Cary Williams throughout the season. The Seahawks pride themselves on relying on man-to-man coverage, but Williams has struggled and needs help. Interestingly, some teams are also going after strong safety Kam Chancellor. Chancellor is the leader of the defense, but his run support is better than his ability to cover receivers.\nPart of the problem is the inconsistent offense. The Seahawks punted on their final six possessions against Cincinnati, the defense spent too much time on the field and tired in the fourth quarter and overtime. That's a good excuse for the loss to Cincinnati, but not so much in the game against winless Detroit and Green Bay.\nThe Seahawks aren't bullying teams anymore and they need to rediscover the swagger that helped propel them to two consecutive trips to the Super Bowl. They'll get another opportunity to regain that intimidation factor when they host Cam Newton and the unbeaten Carolina Panthers Sunday.\n-- Geoffrey C.
