Curtis Granderson reached on an infield hit off losing pitcher Zach Greinke and with one out, Murphy tripled to give the Mets a 1-0 lead. \nBut the Dodgers came back in their half of the first against starter Jacob deGrom when Cory Seager singled and Adrian Gonzales singled him to third. Justin Turner and Andre Ethier.followed with RBI singles to give Los Angeles a 2-1 lead. \nThe Dodgers threatened in the second, but stranded two baserunners when deGrom recorded back to back strikeouts of Seager and Gonzales, and the Dodgers squandered another opportunity in the third when Enrique Hernandez grounded into a double play. \nA Dodgers’ mental lapse cost them a run in the fourth when Murphy singled, went to second on a walk to Lucas Duda and took an extra base when no Dodger was covering third base. Murphy scored on a sacrifice fly by Travis D’Arnaud to draw the Mets even. \nMurphy’s game winner, his third homer of the series, came off Greinke with one out in the sixth. \ndeGrom pitched six innings, giving up six hits, just two after the first inning. He walked three and struck out seven. Noah Syndergaard worked around a walk in the seventh and Jeurys Familia retired six straight over the final two innings for the save. \nGreinke allowed six hits over 6 2/3 innings. He walked one and struck out nine. \nThe Mets will now take on the Chicago Cubs in the National League Championship Series beginning Saturday night in New York.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T06:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T06:40:31.604+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
