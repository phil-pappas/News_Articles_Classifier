The response was so candid, so emotional, so politically incorrect, so Torts down to the core. \n\"No I haven't,\" Tortorella replied. \"I think it's an absolute joke (when I read) percentages on who gets fired first. (NHL coach is) such a disrespected position.\" \nOne day later, here was Torts on a conference call. The newly hired Torts. A calm cool and collected Torts. An analytical Torts. The OTHER Torts. \n\"It's really exciting to be part of, because you're going to be teaching and developing kids, teaching them how to be pros,\" Tortorella said, sounding excited and sincere. \n\"Along with doing that, you're looking to win. It's a team that's 'there.' I'm just honoured to be part of it.\" \nA humble Torts, too. \nHow long will it last? \nWhen it comes to John Tortorella's moods, there are more questions than answers. If you didn't know that already. \nJust ask Flames coach Bob Hartley, who was the target of Torts' wrath during a nationally-televised Calgary-Vancouver game in January 2014 when the then-Canucks coach tried to bust into the visitors dressing room to get at his counterpart . \nThat act has worn thin. It can't resurface. It strips away the credibility of a man who, through all the bluster, can be among the upper echelon of coaches in the game. \nThat the Tampa Bay Lightning won the Stanley Cup in 2004 under his watch was no fluke. Indeed, it was Tortorella who somehow convinced the uber-skilled Vincent Lecavalier to be a two-way player. Without that, Lord Stanley's Holy Grail likely would not have been residing in the Sunshine State that summer. \nHis next stop was New York, where he led the Rangers to a berth in the Eastern Conference final in 2011-12. But even he admitted Wednesday that \"I should have been fired\" in 2013 after a second round loss to the Boston Bruins, which is exactly what happened. \nAnd then came the shipwreck that was the Vancouver Canucks. We're not talking about L'Affair Hartley either. Asking the Sedins to block shots? Ah, Torts, not your finest hour. \nIf John Tortorella can rekindle the X's and O's magic exhibited earlier in his career, he might be able to get these sagging 0-7 Jackets going again. And, given his history of tough love, he might just bring that Nationwide Arena cannon into the Columbus dressing room to make his point. \n\"Todd Richards is a nice guy, but this team looks like it needs to have its butt kicked and (Tortorella) is a good fit to do that,\" an executive from an Eastern Conference team said Wednesday night. \nMaple Leafs forward Shawn Matthias played 18 games for Tortorella's Canucks after being traded to Vancouver by Florida as part of the Roberto Luongo deal in 2014. In that time, he quickly discovered that the Torts the public sees is different from the Torts the players deal with behind closed doors. \n\"Big time,\" Matthias said Wednesday. \"He wants to win so bad. That's the No. 1 thing I noticed from him.\" \nFor former goalie Marty Biron, who played under Torts with the Rangers, Tortorella's at-times volatile relationship with the media hinders the public's perception of what kind of guy he really is. \n\"I loved playing for him,\" Biron said. \"A lot of players do. He's great with the fans, he's great in the community. He's great doing charity work.\" \nBut will he be great for the Jackets in terms of the standings? \nIf he sticks to the job at hand, it says here he very well could be. But if he creates a circus-like atmosphere around himself as has been the case at times in the past, he'll do more harm than good. \nTo the Jackets. And to his own career. \nBecause at this point, John Tortorella might very well be running out of second chances. \nOr fourth chances, as is the case here. \nTortorella reunited with former critic Dubinsky \nBrandon Dubinsky once claimed John Tortorella's crumbling relationship with his players led to the coach's firing by the New York Rangers. \nNow Dubinsky, a former Ranger, finds himself being coached by Tortorella once again, this time in Columbus. \nAwkward? \n\"You have your ups and downs in relationships in sports and life,\" Dubinsky told reporters Wednesday. \"Although those types of things happened a little bit, at the end of the day he made me a better hockey player without a doubt. He helped me immensely.\" \nDubinsky was the first player Tortorella met with after being hired by the Blue Jackets Wednesday. \n\"I need to lean on him,\" Tortorella said. \"He's part of that heartbeat of the club. He needs to be a conduit between the players and the coaching staff until I get to know the other guys. \n\"I had him at a different stage in our career. We went through the process, him and I, some good things, some bad things.\" \nIn order to land Tortorella, the Jackets sent a second-round pick to the Vancouver Canucks. \nWith Tortorella off the market, former Leaf bench boss Randy Carlyle remains one of the more experienced candidates on the market for teams looking to fill vacancies down the road.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T03:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T12:42:14.420+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
