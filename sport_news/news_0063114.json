If team medical director Dr. Keith Meister clears Profar, he will participate in the Arizona Fall League as a designated hitter.\nProfar could pick up the pace of a throwing program after the AFL season but will not play in a winter league. Profar has not played the field in two years because of a torn muscle in the right shoulder. He had 43 minor league at-bats as a DH this season.\nThe Rangers discussed Profar's future during a staff meeting, Daniels said. If Profar gets back to full health, the Rangers will have to decide if he can be a multipositional player on the major league club or needs to play regularly in the minors.\n\"We have to get him healthy first,\" Daniels said.\nBriefly: Daniels and Banister will talk to 2B Rougned Odor about the virtue of rest vs. playing in the Venezuela winter league. Odor appeared in 32 games with Magallanes last season and followed that with 155 games in the majors and minors. ... Daniels has had no contact with OF Leonys Martin, who balked at the club's request that he work out with the Arizona Instructional League team to be ready if he were needed during the playoffs. Daniels indicated OF Ryan Rua passed on an assignment to the Arizona Fall League because of an approaching wedding. ... RHP Sam Wolff pitched for the first time since September 9, 2014, with a four-inning start in the Arizona Fall League. Wolff missed the minor league season because of a torn Achilles tendon.\nRangers eliminated from postseason\nRangers loss reviewed Grant: Rangers need hitting coach; Banister knows what he wants\nFraley: Jon Daniels expects motivated Rangers in spring because 'losing sucks'\nPotential Rangers' hitting coach candidates: Michael Young seems unlikely\nExpert analysis Grant: In truth, the Rangers started falling apart well before their 7th-inning collapse in Game 5\nCowlishaw: Rangers didn't choke, but Elvis Andrus and Derek Holland did\nSherrington: Mind-boggling Rangers collapse is as bad as World Series nightmare\nGrant: Will his defensive struggles in Game 5 define Elvis Andrus' career?\nFraley: Jose Bautista becomes Public Enemy No. 1 after Rangers intense ALDS vs. Toronto\nFraley: The 53 minutes that changed the Rangers' destiny\nCowlishaw: On Elvis Andrus, Adrian Beltre, and their future with the Rangers\nPlayer and fan reaction\nWhy Rangers' Cole Hamels looks 'forward to not only next season, but the next couple of years'\nGame 5 in Toronto reminded Darren Woodson of battery-filled snowballs thrown at him in Philadelphia\nScare Rangers fans at Halloween with new Jose Bautista bat flip T-shirt\nJose Bautista enjoys his special moment, calls ALDS 'unbelievable'\nAdrian Beltre: 'I still cannot process' that Rangers season is over\nHow did Jeff Banister know quirky rule that helped Rangers in Game 5?
