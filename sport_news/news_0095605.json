STEPHEN, S.C. (WCIV) -- The stories from across the Lowcountry are all similar with hundreds of people being forced to evacuate or stay indoors and watch the floodwaters rise, hoping they don't breach their homes. \nIn St. Stephen, one family is in it knee deep. \nDriving around St. Stephen, the story is the same as many other places around the state and the Lowcountry. Houses are surrounded by water, flooded streets are in every direction. In St. Stephen, it's a rural area and people have more land to flood. \nAt one home surrounded by water, the people who live there decided to ride out the storm. Wading up to the front door is a bit of a task in knee-deep water, but the family inside is taking it all in stride. \nHolly Thomas' home seems like a scene right out of Hollywood. Fitting really, since her family is spending the time watching a lot of movies. \n\"Movies, lots of Movies. I came outside to see how deep it was. It's knee deep, it's bad,\" she said. \nThe lifelong Berkeley County resident says she's seen bad weather, but this weekend's storms is something else. \n\"I'm shocked, never seen it like this before. It looks like a house in a pond. It started as a big puddle and a few hours later, the whole yard was covered,\" Thomas said. \nThomas and her daughters are stocked up with the necessities -- food, water, a few movies -- until access to the rest of the Lowcountry is restored. But if things get really dire, rescue is nearby. \n\"We have a nice pontoon boat, nice to have in front of the yard. We have had people stop to take pictures in front of the yard. It's just crazy,\" she said. \nThomas' daughters Allie and Kadence said they thought taking the boat out of St. Stephen was a good idea. \n\"Momma said we're going to stand on boat with fishing poles for people who see us,\" they said. \nBut do they think they'll catch anything? \"No -- maybe a dog or two.\" \nWhen it was pointed out that they don't even have to go to school on Monday, they girls were pretty matter-of-fact on that subject. \n\"We wouldn't make it even if there was,\" they said. \nWhile it continued to rain cats and dogs on Sunday, they Thomas family will continue to weather the storm on their own little island. \n\"We will wait it out. We have a few feet before the house rolls away. We're just going to wait it out, but I don't think we're going anywhere,\" Thomas said.
