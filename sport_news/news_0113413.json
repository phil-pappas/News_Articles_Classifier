And every one of us from management to coaches to players bears responsibility,\" general manager Jarmo Kekalainen said in statement released by the team. \"There is still a lot of hockey to be played and we believe this change was necessary to give our team the best chance to accomplish the goals we've set for this season.\" \nTortorella signed a three-year contract and will make his debut Thursday when Columbus visits Minnesota. \nWith a 446-375-115 record over 14 seasons, the 57-year-old Tortorella is the NHL's winningest U.S.-born coach. \n\"John Tortorella is an experienced National Hockey League coach with a proven track record of success,\" Kekalainen said. \"He is a Stanley Cup winner, and we believe the right person to lead our team at this time.\" \nAnd Tortorella is suddenly in demand after his year off. \nLast month, he was hired by USA Hockey to coach the American team competing in the NHL's World Cup of Hockey tournament next year. \nTortorella acknowledged spending the past year soul-searching to determine what he might have done differently in Vancouver. It was a season in which a second-half collapse led to the Canucks missing the playoffs three years after reaching the Stanley Cup final. \n\"I have searched and looked at situations of what I could've done a better job there, and I do have some answers with that,\" he said. \"So sure, I think you become a better coach when you dig deep.\" \nRichards finished with a 127-112-21 record with the Blue Jackets. \nThey have scored just 13 goals and have allowed an NHL-worst 34 goals. \n___", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T18:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T19:00:10.117+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
