The sophomore scored on a 67-yard run in the third quarter and scored the game-winner on a 51-yard sprint to the end zone with just more than a minute to play during the fourth quarter. \n“It’s incredible,” Money said. “Ever since two-a-days, the coaches have preached to us when it comes to district, the games are tougher and its going to take a full 48 minutes from everybody on the team to come out victorious, and that’s what we had to do (Friday).” \nMoney had 200 yards of offense — 135 rushing and 65 passing — and accounted for three touchdowns for St. Joseph. \nSt. Joseph got on the board first in the first quarter. Money hit Dave Lapeyre on an 11-yard touchdown pass and added the 2-point conversion to take an 8-0 lead. \nThe St. Michael’s offense stalled on its first drive but received a 32-yard field goal from Pedro Tijerina. Later in the quarter, the Crusaders took the lead when Gabriel Vondrak scored on a 21-yard run to make it 9-8. \nDuring the second quarter, St. Michael’s added a 1-yard touchdown run by De’Sean Johnson to take a 16-8 lead. \nThe Bloodhounds answered a few minutes later as Mario Garcia scored on a 15-yard run. \nSt. Michael’s added a 26-yard field goal from Tijerina late in the second quarter to take a 19-14 lead at the break. \nDuring the second half, the Bloodhounds’ defense stepped up. When Cole Conner had to exit the game with a possible concussion in the first half, Garcia stepped into his linebacker position and helped stifle the Crusaders’ offensive production. \n“Hats off to the defense,” St. Joseph coach Tino Villarreal said. “This was team football, it looked good and the defense played their hearts out.” \nMidway through the third quarter, Money gave the Bloodhounds the 21-19 lead after the 67-yard run. \nSt. Michael’s answered early in the fourth quarter. Vondrak hit Conner Gjerset on an 8-yard pass for a touchdown to give the Crusaders a 26-21 advantage. \nIt remained that way until late in the quarter when Money scored his second rushing touchdown to take a 29-26 lead. \nAndrew Crum covers sports for The Brownsville Herald.
