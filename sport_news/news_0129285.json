We equalised and then their keeper made a great save at the end,\" said Simeone. \n\"The sensation is that we have lost two points and that we were very close to winning a game that on chances we deserved to win.\" \nSimeone's substitutions worked a treat as Vietto, Martinez and Yannick Ferreira Carrasco all made their biggest impact since joining the club this summer. \nA point leaves Atletico still two adrift of Madrid and Barcelona, but Simeone is content with their return from a difficult start to the campaign \n\"We are still looking for the right balance, but we have played seven games and I think the 13 points we have is not bad. \n\"We've played Madrid, Barcelona, Sevilla and Villarreal both away. I think it is an important point but the feeling is that we could have won.\" \nAnd the man who masterminded Atletico's amazing title triumph in 2013/14 hailed the competitive start to the season that sees Villarreal and Celta Vigo upsetting Madrid and Barcelona's applecart. \n\"Villarreal are having a great season. The injuries are playing an important part too. Barca aren't the same without Messi or Iniesta, Real Madrid miss James (Rodriguez) or Danilo, we miss Koke. \n\"We are all competing and at least it is more entertaining for everyone like this.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T09:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T07:21:21.567+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
