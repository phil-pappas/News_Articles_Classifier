Log in and start commenting \nAlthough the appointment is undoubtedly good news for fans of the red and white, it couldn’t have come at a worse time for those following blue and white stripes. \nIn dire need of a win, and perhaps more importantly, a performance with some attacking intent, what looked like a less taxing return to Premier League action after the international break just got a lot harder. Big Sam doesn’t have a lot of time to work with his players, but then neither does Albion chief Pulis. \nToday is the first time this week he’s seen the majority of his team, and some players are not returning until tomorrow or Friday. \nAllardyce, who started his managerial career at The Hawthorns with a spell as Brian Talbot’s assistant, has a mouthwatering derby against his old club, Newcastle, next.
