But he led Villa to safety with a 17th-place finish last season and also guided the team into the final of the FA Cup, before losing 0-4 to Arsenal at Wembley in May. \nSherwood, 46, acknowledged his job was under threat after the loss against Swansea at Villa Park. Swansea rallied to win with a goal in the 87th minute. \nAssistant manager Ray Wilkins, first-team coach Mark Robson and performance analyst Seamus Brady have also left. \nKevin MacDonald, who has been coaching the under-21s, was placed in temporary charge. \nVilla travels to Southampton for a League Cup match on Wednesday, before an away game against Tottenham Hotspur in the league on November 2. \nPossible contenders to replace Sherwood include former Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers, who was fired earlier in October.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T18:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T13:13:10.668+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
