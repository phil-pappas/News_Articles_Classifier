Bielema appeared to fall backward right before the flag was thrown, leading to questions about the exact reason for the penalty.\nThe Arkansas coached called the whole controversy \"got blown out of catastrophic proportion\" and defended his decision to try and diffuse a situation.\nSteve Shaw, the league's coordinator of officials said the play was officiated properly though he couldn't get into specifics. He said not to read much into the timing of the flag's appearance.\n\"Sometimes it can be an accumulation of activities on a play or series of plays when play gets chippy,\" Shaw said. \"... For those type things, you have to look at the whole sequence and not just look at when the flag came out. I know people always say 'Wow, that was a late flag' as if a late flag is very, very bad. We want our guys to see it, know it and then throw it. So I'm not looking for fast flags. I'm looking for accurate flags.\"\nAlabama coach Nick Saban said he still hasn't seen the new video of the incident but he did speak with Robinson about the play.\n\"His thoughts were, 'Hey, it's my responsibility. I got blocked. I got up and pushed a guy and whatever happened from then would have never happened if I had not been more emotional and had more personal discipline,'\" Saban said. \"I just talked to him about it. I asked him what he thought and he said he thought it was his responsibility, so I didn't even look at it.\"\nThe play in question followed an Alabama interception in front of the Arkansas bench. Bielema approached Robinson and an Arkansas players arguing after the whistle.\nBielema walked next to Robinson and appeared to fall backwards as if he were shoved by the Alabama left tackle. The linesman reached for his flag only after Bielema stumbled, though the video did not show any contact from Robinson. Bielema celebrated with a few fist pumps once he saw the flag tossed.\nSEC commissioner Greg Sankey on Tuesday released a statement saying he'd spoken to Bielema about it and the flag was not a result of the coach's involvement in the scrum.\n@ClayTravisBGID watch Beilema instegate Cam Robinson, fake like he was shoved, then dance a jig to celebrate. pic.twitter.com/DYSSZdEkOM\nâ€” Anthony Jacks (@Coach_Jacks) October 12, 2015", "external_links": ["http://t.co/DYSSZdEkOM", "https://twitter.com/Coach_Jacks/status/653400272002248704", "https://twitter.com/ClayTravisBGID"], "published": "2015-10-15T01:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T21:08:53.943+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
