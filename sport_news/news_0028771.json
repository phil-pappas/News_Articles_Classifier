But Joey Logano had other ideas. \nAfter the two jostled for the lead over the closing laps, Logano tagged Kenseth going into turn one with just five laps to go, sending Kenseth spinning and handing Logano his second straight Chase victory. \nIt’s the fifth win of the season for Logano, who has locked other Chase contenders out of being able to safely transfer during the Contender round of the Chase. Afterwards, Logano said the incident was just hard racing. We also heard from car owner Roger Penske and second place finisher Denny Hamlin. \nKyle Busch came back from a pit road penalty, damage to the front of his Toyota and a slow pit stop to power to his 75th career NASCAR Xfinity Series victory Saturday at Kansas Speedway. The win is the third of Busch's Xfinity Series career at Kansas and his fifth series win of the season. \nWith 43 laps to go, Busch drove from seventh to second, then stalked teammate Matt Kenseth for 28 laps before driving to the lead and away for the win with 15 to go. Busch talked about the win afterwards. We also heard form second place finisher Kenseth. \nThe NASCAR Sprint Cup Series heads for the unpredictable high banks of Talladega Superspeedway this weekend for the final race of the Contender round of the Chase for the Sprint Cup.
