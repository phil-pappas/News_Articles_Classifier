Well, unless your name is Kyle Bellhorn , the junior goalie for Northwestern. \nBellhorn stood strong, made 10 saves and clinched a 1-0 victory for Northwestern in the Colonial League championship game. \n\"I love it. I love being under pressure,\" Bellhorn said. \"I mean I've got to play 110 percent for my teammates as they're putting in 120 percent for me. So I've got to do absolutely everything that I can to keep it out of the back of the net.\" \nNorthwestern junior defender Jonathan Blaine put the Tigers on the scoreboard with 30 minutes left in the first half when he found the back of the net off a corner kick by senior midfielder Brett Scott . \nThen it was up to Blaine, the defenders and Bellhorn to stave off the pressure that the Lions were producing. \nBellhorn made a diving stop with 6:33 left in the first half. He later stopped Moravian Academy's Jack Painter with 20:51 remaining in regulation. With 6:35 remaining in regulation, Bellhorn made two big back-to-back stops with the last one being a save on the Lions' Tanner Shane off a corner kick. \n\"We were just kind of hanging on for dear life in the second half. Moravian was taking it us pretty good,\" Northwestern coach Nate Hunsicker said. \"And honestly I have to admit I was partly surprised they didn't find the back of the net at one point. But our defense and especially our goalkeeper Kyle Bellhorn, they played awesome in the back. And they won this for us.\" \nIt's another league title for the Tigers, who also won the championship in 2013. \n\"It's really unbelievable. It's a dream come true,\" Blaine said. \"My freshman year we did it and to come out and do it again, it's just amazing.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T08:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T03:10:02.171+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
