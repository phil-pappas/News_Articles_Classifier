Two teams that know eachother well North Dakota State and UNI and UNI is 4-3 vs the Bison in the last seven years. A couple of years ago you went up there and almost got the double-u but the football Gods were against you. \nMark: We had some tough breaks in that game some injuries but when you play on the road you have to find a way to win because the key to playing on the road you have to win the close ones. Find a way to close games out. \nRick: You have been on the road a lot this year but this is a very tough road environment the Fargo Dome they are celebrating their 40th year just like UNI. Tough defense--great quarterback. How do you win there? \nMark: Lot of similarities between the two football teams--I think the key to the football game right now is Carson Wentz their quarterback...so we are going to have to find a way to contain him--he is going to get his yards he makes great throws great plays and their defense is outstanding so we have our work cut rout for us. \nRick: Last year you did a great job of stopping Carson Wentz beating North Dakota State 23-3 snapping their 33 game winning streak--lots of similarities to that game you lost some great players but you have some good ones returning.. \nMark: yeah there are similarities but there are differences because of changing personnel on both sides. \nRick: What's the mentality of your football team right now? \nMark: It's good we have been calm learning from last week's mistakes.. and we have been trying to get ready for the noise in the Fargo dome and the communication problems it will cause. \nRick: UNI fans will be up there but also back here.. \nMark: Yes the game will be shown on the big screen at the UNI-dome and also a big tailgate up there by Warren Transport.. \nRick : Good Luck Coach at North Dakota State..", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T05:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T05:44:36.944+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
