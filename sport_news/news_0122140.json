Both D-III No. 14-ranked Bradshaw and No. 26 Prescott possess strong defenses, and both teams have offenses that can either go gangbusters or leave you scratching your head as to their inconsistencies. No matter what, this is almost always one of the best games in any sport in any given year in the tri-city area. Expect nothing less Friday night, Oct. 23.  Mohave Accelerated (2-7, 1-2) at Chino Valley (3-5, 1-2)7 p.m. Friday at Chino Valley H.S. football stadium in Chino Valley How 'bout them Cougars? Say what you will about Division V No. 32-ranked Chino Valley being on the cusp of another losing season, but indications are that this program's turning the corner under second-year coach Wade Krug. The Cougars, winless in 2014, have three victories with two games left in the 2015 regular campaign. This evening, on Senior Night, Chino Valley should win its second straight game for the second time this season by defeating a struggling Mohave Accelerated squad. Division VI state tournament Bagdad on a first-round BYE Friday, Oct. 23 Bagdad, the No. 4 seed in the 12-team D-VI state tournament, earned a first-round bye Friday, Oct. 23, as one of the top four seeds.
