(AP) — Nick Chubb is back on the Georgia sideline, and his old buddy Todd Gurley is with him. \nChubb suffered a season-ending left knee injury on the first play of last week’s loss to Tennessee. He was on crutches as he followed the Bulldogs out of the locker room for Saturday night’s game against Missouri. \nGurley, a first-round NFL draft pick by St. Louis this year, attended the game with the Rams off. \nWith his left leg in a brace, Chubb used his crutches to maneuver to a trainer’s table, where he sat and watched the first half. Gurley stood beside him and at times shared the seat on the trainer’s table. \nChubb’s injury ended his streak of 13 straight games with more than 100 yards rushing. \n___ \nAP College Football website: www.collegefootball.ap.org Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T03:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T04:02:50.036+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
