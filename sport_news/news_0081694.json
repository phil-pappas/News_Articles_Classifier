Poulter has currently played nine European Tour events in 2015 but needs to play at least 13 to retain a European Tour card, mandatory criteria for Ryder Cup consideration.\nAfter the Hong Kong Open is the European Tour's four-event Final Series. Currently ranked 50th in the Race to Dubai, Poulter is not guaranteed to get into all four events in the series and thus likely needs to both qualify for and play well in the WGC-HSBC Champions.\nSo now, the 39-year-old Englishman will play in Hong Kong this weekend, a 19-hour trip from Florida. According to a report from James Corrigan for The Telegraph , Poulter’s late entry in the event came via an unlikely source: an American golfer.\nFormer PGA Champion Rich Beem, now a broadcaster at Sky Sports, backed out of the Hong Kong event so Poulter could tee it up.\nNEWSLETTERS: Sign up to get the latest golf news in your inbox\nMany American golf fans questioned Beem’s decision on Twitter, but can you blame him? He has a free dinner coming his way.\nThanks to @beemerpga for giving up his invitation to allow me to play in Hong Kong. Where would you like me to take you for dinner.\n— Ian Poulter (@IanJamesPoulter) October 20, 2015 Poulter is a lucky man, especially since his passport arrived just a few hours before his flight took off. He will tee off Thursday without playing a practice round at Hong Kong Golf Club.\nThat's what you call cutting it fine, passports arrived 7.15am, taking off at 9am to make flight to Hong Kong. pic.twitter.com/JmeVITEvLn\n— Ian Poulter (@IanJamesPoulter) October 20, 2015\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["https://t.co/JmeVITEvLn", "http://www.golf.com/static/newsletter/signup", "http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/golf/rydercup/11942494/Ian-Poulter-dashes-from-Florida-home-to-Hong-Kong-Open-to-ensure-he-is-eligible-to-play-in-2016-Ryder-Cup.html", "http://www.golf.com/", "https://twitter.com/IanJamesPoulter/status/656433280145846272", "http://www.owgr.com/ranking", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "https://twitter.com/IanJamesPoulter/status/656429809002795008", "https://twitter.com/beemerpga"], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T08:54:30.017+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
