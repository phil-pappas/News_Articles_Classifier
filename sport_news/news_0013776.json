Lee may have gotten the win, but they didn’t make it easy for themselves. \nThe Lee Ladies bested the Waynesboro Giants in four error-riddled sets thursday night, winning by scores of 25-15, 25-16, 14-25 and 25-21. \n“The first two games were a little easy because Waynesboro wasn’t playing their best,” said Lee coach Jan Williams. “It’s hard mentally to stay tough mentally throughout the third game when you’ve won the first two as easily as they did. But Waynesboro came out fighting and they had no intentions of going home and my girls really weren’t mentally ready for that. And Waynesboro gave it their all.” \nThey certainly did. \nLee won the first two sets comfortably enough, taking them by scores of 25-15 and 25-16, but their game fell apart in the third set. Numerous unforced errors by the Lee Ladies and an explosive start by Waynesboro gave the Giants an early 6-0 lead. The crowd perked up seeing their home team seizing the unexpected advantage. \nThere was a lengthy delay of game as a Waynesboro player argued a point that would have put the Giants up 15-6. A hush fell as the referees silently debated the call. Lee High’s Camryn Shull stood bouncing the ball on Lee’s backline, the sound echoing like the gym’s nervous pulse. That point went Lee’s way, but the third set didn’t. Waynesboro swept it 25-14. \nSuddenly on the backfoot after two unremarkable sets, Williams had to give her players something. \n“Some choice words,\" she said. \"Just kidding. You’ve got to get them to quit goofing off and get their mind back set back on the game, serving hard and hitting hard.” \nLee rebounded to win the fourth set in heart-pounding, back-and-forth fashion. Trailing 7-8, Waynesboro’s Alyssa Balsley made a spectacular diving save that brought the crowd to its feet and the score to another deadlock. \nIt also gave Williams’ team a chance to prove their collective mettle. \n“They all have a role in getting everyone together,” Williams said. “I wish we had one person to depend on but it varies depending on the game.” \nLee eventually claimed a 25-21 victory. With half the season gone, the team has plenty to learn from this game. \n“Now it’s just fine-tuning the game and staying mentally tough whenever things are going well and play hard and do what you’re supposed to be doing and not start having fun,” Williams said. “I want them to have fun, but I don’t want them to be lax at the same time. We want to have fun and win, and who doesn’t have fun doing that?” \nLee was led by Jennifer Williams’ 12 kills and 10 digs, Natalie Fitzgerald’s seven kills and 16 digs, and Amber Johnson’s nine aces and 16 assists. \nFor Waynesboro, Tamarah Jackson had 11 assists and 12 digs, Alyssa Balsley had eight kills and 13 digs, and Lauren Kelso had nine digs, five aces, and three kills.
