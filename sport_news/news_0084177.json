(Photo: Geoff Burke-USA TODAY Sports) CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nMy first, second and third impressions of Ohio State offensive coordinator Ed Warinner: Nice guy. \nGrowing up, he would have been the neighbor my dad spent hours talking to across the fence. He comes across as a someone you’d want living next door in the event of an emergency — a man’s man, from that firm jaw to a voice that needs no mic for amplification. \nBut I had my reservations when head coach Urban Meyer promoted Warinner to replace the departed Tom Herman as OC. For starters, I worried that putting more on his plate might detract from him being arguably the best offensive line coach in America. \nTwo, because he has spent most of his coaching career working with the O-line — or “slobs,” as this group of Buckeyes likes to be called — I’ve always figured him to be more old school than new age. \nNot as Neanderthal as former O-line coach and overmatched OC Jim Bollman, but not a whiz kid like Herman either. \nSorry, but I can’t picture someone whose nose has been buried in the trenches for so many years doodling imaginative ways to make the Ohio State offense even more explosive. \nI just can’t. \nThat’s why when I get a text or email or read the message boards assailing “his” play-calling so far this season, I am hesitant to pile on. \nI’m not sure how much of the attack we’ve seen this year has Warinner’s signature attached. This offense, as it’s been since he arrived, is Meyer’s handiwork. He has ultimate veto power. \nBefore pointing a Fickell finger of blame at Warinner — remember when defensive coordinator Luke Fickell was everybody’s favorite whipping boy? — know that Meyer is fully engaged with the offense. \nHe’s like Tressel in that regard. For Tressel to have anything to do with the defense when he was head coach was like trespassing. And he admitted as much. \nMeyer keeps his nose out of the defense’s business. Unless things get so messy that he has to stage a one-man intervention like he did in 2012 when he moved fullback Zach Boren to linebacker to give that unit the leadership and toughness it was lacking. \nInterestingly, with the Buckeyes opening Big Ten play Saturday at Indiana, that position switch came one week after their last trip to Bloomington. Ohio State was lucky to escape with a 52-49 victory. \nMoving Boren worked wonders. The defense, riddled for 87 points in back-to-back games, didn’t allow more than 23 points in a game the rest of the way and finished off a 12-0 season. \nHeading back to the Hoosier state, the OSU offense is showing signs of coming out of its funk. The Buckeyes rolled up 511 yards last week against Western Michigan and probably would have gone over 700 had Cardale Jones not underthrown a handful of deep balls. \nAnd had Ezekiel Elliott been worked into the gameplan more. \nAnd had OSU found ways to use Braxton Miller more as a slot receiver and less as a Wildcat quarterback. \nAre those shortcomings on Warinner? To some degree, yes, since he’s part of the braintrust. But to make him the scapegoat for whatever ails the offense would seem out of bounds. \nMeyer’s staff is going through a transitional phase that finds him not only working with a new coordinator, but a new quarterbacks coach in Tim Beck and a new running backs coach in Tony Alford. \nYes, the Buckeyes miss Herman, but I think more in his day-to-day handling of the quarterbacks as their position coach than his play-calling. \nMeyer has a system in place, and if I’m reading between the lines correctly, it should be on auto-pilot no matter who the lieutenants are assisting him. \n“I think it’s important to understand when we say offensive coordinator here, it’s coordinating an offense that’s (already) in,” Meyer said Monday. “Does that make sense? The system’s here and the system’s not going anywhere. We hire people to coach our system.” \nMeyer made a tweak last week to how OSU operates his system by giving more game day input to Beck, the “eye in the sky.” Herman worked from the press box, like Beck does now. Meyer kept Warinner on the sidelines, where his fiery personality is more of an asset but the vantage point is less ideal. \nHopefully, Meyer won’t need to blow things up like he did last time his Buckeyes got back from Bloomington.
