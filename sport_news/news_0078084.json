Ask the experts! \nFor the Rutgers offense, the past three weeks have brought three different leading rushers.\nThe Scarlet Knights entered Saturday’s game against No. 1 Ohio State ranked 33rd in the nation and second only to the Buckeyes in the Big Ten with 199.2 rushing yards per game, and they’ve had success on the ground while at times featuring any one of three running backs: sophomores Robert Martin and Josh Hicks as well as redshirt senior Paul James.\nIn the first half against Ohio State, James had nine carries for 48 yards and Martin had two for 1 yard. Hicks did not carry the ball.\nMartin led that group in last Saturday’s win over Indiana, carrying the ball 17 times for 124 yards and a career-high-tying three touchdowns.\n“I just have to thank my line,” Martin told NJ.com after the Indiana game. “They’ve been playing good this season, and we just have to keep it up.”\nThe sophomore has led Rutgers in carries each of the past two weeks, but against Michigan State, James led all Scarlet Knights rushers with 74 yards on two carries.\nAgainst Kansas on Sept. 26, Hicks set the pace with 21 carries for 113 yards and two touchdowns.\nAgainst Indiana, that meant the Hoosiers had to pay attention to three different capable ball carriers. It also meant Indiana was less equipped to defend the pass, as Rutgers redshirt sophomore quarterback Chris Laviano threw for a season-high 386 yards and three touchdowns.\n“Philosophically, I think all offenses are trying to create space, I think everybody’s got a different way of doing it, but for us, running the ball creates the one-on-one matchups that we want and running it effectively forces defenses to add people to the box,” Rutgers coach Kyle Flood said. “We’ve got a talented group of running backs, and that certainly helps.”\nThrough six games, Martin and James rank second and third in the Big Ten, respectively, with 6.2 and 5.9 yards per carry. An early-season emphasis on the run game also had the Scarlet Knights ranked 20th in the Football Bowl Subdivision with an average time of possession of 32:37.\n>> Get the most out of your Ohio State experience, follow @BuckeyeXtra on Twitter \nKeeping the ball away from an OSU offense that ranked first in the Big Ten in scoring offense could have given Rutgers an advantage on Saturday, but Flood said winning the time of possession battle comes with a caveat.\n“I think the accurate answer is it’s effective as long as you’re scoring touchdowns,” Flood said.\nSaturday sellout Rutgers’ athletic department announced on Wednesday that Saturday’s game had sold out. It was the first sellout at High Point Solutions Stadium in five home games this season.\n“The country got a glimpse of that a couple weeks ago when we played Michigan State, and I think it’ll be amped up even a little bit higher this week with the No. 1 team in the country coming to town,” Flood said on Monday.\n>> Click for details on how to win tickets and trips to OSU games from Dispatch Reader Rewards \nLonga leads defense Rutgers entered the Ohio State game ranked 84th in the FBS in scoring defense, but things likely would be worse without junior linebacker Steve Longa, who had 66 tackles through his first six games, good for sixth-most in the FBS.\nThe Scarlet Knights were roughed up — for 52 points — against Indiana, and so was Longa, who sported a walking boot on his right leg after that game, in which he recorded a team-high 16 tackles.\nStill, he played against Ohio State.\n“We gave up 52,” Longa told the Asbury Park Press after the Indiana game. “They gave up 50 whatever. We came out on top. That’s all that matters, right?”\naerickson@dispatch.com \n@AndrewRErickson", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T03:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T08:17:59.921+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
