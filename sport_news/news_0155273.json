As hurricane season approaches — a time when panic-ridden residents categorically stock up on flashlights and non-perishables — some might be surprised to learn that the majority of the most fatal storms in history took place long before any of us roamed the earth.\nHere are the 10 most fatal storms in U.S. history:\n1. Galveston, Texas, 1900 AP The debris and devastation following the hurricane in Galveston, Texas, in 1900, which remains the deadliest storm in U.S. history. This disaster left a devastating impact on its victims.\nWith winds blowing at a high of 155 mph, the death toll was tallied at between 8,000 and 12,000 people — an all-time high for hurricane-related fatalities in recorded history, according to a report by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\nOver a century later, the category 4 hurricane in Galveston remains the benchmark against which all other hurricanes are measured based on its status as the foremost lethal storm in U.S. history.\n2. Lake Okeechobee, Florida, 1928 J. PAT CARTER/AP A plaque in West Palm Beach, Florida marks the site where 674 of the victims of the Lake Okeechobee hurricane in 1928 are buried. The notorious tempest hit the coastal areas of Florida with ferocious force and gusts of wind recorded at a high of 155 mph, according to the NOAA.\nChoppy waves as high as 20 feet crashed into the barrier islands of Florida, including Palm Beach, the National Weather Service reported.\nThousands of residents drowned as water submerged an area that was approximately 6 miles deep and 75 miles long around the south end of Lake Okeechobee, according to the NWS.\nThe category 4 storm caused a staggering 2,500 to 3,000 deaths, the NOAA reported.\n3. Hurricane Katrina, Louisiana and Mississippi, 2005 DAVID J. PHILLIP/ASSOCIATED PRESS Floodwaters from Hurricane Katrina submerged the streets near downtown New Orleans, Louisiana in August, 2005. It shouldn't come as much of a surprise that Hurricane Katrina made the list.\nThe category 3 cyclone, had winds peaking at 125 mph, which pummeled Louisiana and Mississippi — causing a devastating death toll of 1,200, with hundreds of thousands more losing their homes, according to the NOAA.\nAn astounding 80% of the city of New Orleans was inundated, with some areas submerged in 10 feet of water, the NOAA reported.\nOn top of its fatal impact, the financial repercussions were cataclysmic.\nThe cyclone cost a whopping $108 billion in damages (before inflation), according to the NOAA.\n4. Cheniere Caminada Island, Louisiana, 1893 The hurricane commonly referred to as the \"Great October Storm,\" may have hit Louisiana almost a century and a quarter ago, but the storm is still widely referenced today based on its lethal outcome.\nThe category 4 squall leveled houses on the Louisiana island of Cheniere Caminada and caused between 1,100 and 1,400 casualties, according to the NOAA.\nWhen the storm ended, most of the town of Grand Isle was completely wiped out, the NOAA reported.\n5. Sea Islands, Georgia and South Carolina, 1893 It appears that 1893 was not the safest year to be alive in the Southern states of the U.S., when it came to natural disasters.\nThe category 3 storm supplied a shattering surge of over 16 feet, with winds whipping at about 120 mph, the NOAA reported.\nThe hurricane fomented between 1,000 and 2,000 fatalities and left nearly 30,000 people homeless, according to the NWS.\n6. Georgia and South Carolina, 1881 Don't be fooled by the category 2 rating of this tumultuous tempest — the storm slammed Georgia and South Carolina, resulting in a whopping 700 deaths, the NOAA reported.\nIn fact, the hurricane is the deadliest category 2 storm in history and was “an example of the worst possible outcome from a category 2 storm,” according to the Encyclopedia of Disasters .\nWhile Savannah, Georgia was particularly marred by the hurricane, several low-lying barrier islands were completely submerged and there was significant crop damage, the NWS reported.\n7. Hurricane Audrey, South Central U.S., 1957 AP Hurricane Audrey survivors gathered in the aftermath at Combre Memorial Park in Lake Charles, Louisiana, for a mass burial of victims of the Category 4 storm. Hurricane Audrey wreaked havoc on Texas, Louisiana and the Gulf of Mexico.\nThe category 4 storm incited 416 confirmed deaths, with many more missing and presumed dead, according to the NOAA.\nThe storm surge peaked at 12 feet and infiltrated as far as 25 miles inland over lowland areas of Louisiana, the National Hurricane Center reported.\nAn offshore oil-drilling rig on the Gulf of Mexico was completely engulfed, costing the U.S. $16 million alone, according to the U.S. Department of the Interior Minerals Management Service.\nThe NHC estimated the total damages from the storm at approximately $150 million.\nTo this date, Hurricane Audrey is considered the strongest and only major hurricane to make landfall in the U.S. in the month of June, according to the NWS.\n8. Florida Keys, 1935 AP The category 5 storm uprooted trees and leveled houses in the Florida Keys with winds as high as 185 miles per hour. Let's just say Labor Day in 1935 in Florida was not a day of respite.\nWhile this storm might appear modest at number eight on the list, it remains the most intense hurricane ever known to strike the U.S. and the third most intense hurricane in the Atlantic Basin, according to the NHC.\nThe super storm — which the NHC referred to as “small but vicious” — featured winds roaring through the Keys at an astounding 185 mph, according to the NOAA.\nThe category 5 hurricane obliterated low-lying areas around the Florida Keys and was the impetus for 408 fatalities, many of whom were World War I veterans, the NOAA reported.\n9. Last Island Hurricane, Louisiana, 1856 It's no wonder this super storm earned the moniker the “Great Storm of 1856,” given its catastrophic impact on island-goers in Louisiana.\nThe category 4 cyclone eradicated 400 people, many of whom were on holiday, according to the NOAA.\nThe storm boasted a force so strong, that it severed the island in two.\nShips capsized, hotels collapsed and many vacationers drowned or became trapped under crumbling buildings, the NHC reported.\n10. Miami Hurricane, 1926 Miami was just emerging as an up and coming metropolis during this time, with real estate developments proliferating across the coastal line, when this torrent materialized.\nThe category 4 storm made its calamitous presence felt when, after a few hours of landfall, it underwent a brief half-hour lull, during which, many residents and vacationers emerged from safety, the NHC reported.\nThat's when the storm gained momentum, causing a devastating blow of 372 fatalities and injuring about 6,000 more, according to the NOAA.\nThe NHC reported that the Miami hurricane of 1926 single-handedly stunted the economic boom in South Florida and would have cost a whopping $90 billion had the same disaster occurred in recent years.\nbrobins@nydailynews.com", "external_links": ["https://books.google.com/books?id=4YzF-DT__aIC&pg=PA128&lpg=PA128&dq=georgia+south+carolina+hurricane+1881&source=bl&ots=RoghEbvxf4&sig=9YCDs-5Uwpvk9SAnz00vNmu5pY4&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CFQQ6AEwCGoVChMIxZjWrv6hyAIVgZMeCh2AnwlH#v=onepage&q=georgia%20south%20carolina%20hurricane%201881&f=false", "http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/pdf/nws-nhc-6.pdf", "http://www.srh.noaa.gov/mfl/?n=okeechobee", "http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/outreach/history/#audrey", "http://www.srh.noaa.gov/mfl/?n=miami_hurricane"], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T20:07:15.129+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
