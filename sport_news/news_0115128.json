But the bull trout recovery plan the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service released this month reminds us that this fish, which has been a threatened species since 1999, could also affect recreation — specifically, fishing for brook trout. Although brook trout were first stocked in many mountain lakes close to a century ago, the fish is not native to Eastern Oregon. Brook trout are aggressive and they can outcompete bull trout, which is a native species, for food. Brook trout can also breed with bull trout, producing a hybrid. The Fish and Wildlife Service’s recovery plan, which is a list of recommendations rather than mandates, calls for the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife to eradicate brook trout from lakes that are the sources of streams with bull trout populations. (Brook trout can migrate between lakes and outlet streams.) That includes many lakes in the Elkhorn and Wallowa mountains. In most of those lakes brook trout is the predominant, or even the only, fish species present. That brook trout threaten bull trout is not a revelation. The Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife (ODFW) has tried to deal with that threat by easing bag limits and other restrictions on brook trout fishing in many places. In the short term that means more chances for people to catch, and keep, brook trout. But the federal agency’s proposal to eliminate brook trout would eventually have the opposite effect, of course. In the meantime we urge ODFW to look into other fish that could replace brook trout as a sport fish in alpine lakes. Cooking just-caught trout over a campfire in the Eagle Cap Wilderness or the Elkhorns is a venerable tradition. We’d hate to see that tradition fade away.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T14:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T22:47:16.048+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
