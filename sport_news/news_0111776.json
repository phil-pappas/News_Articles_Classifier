And then they may chat for a bit about Justin's daughters. And football will probably come up, too.\n\"I'll usually say, 'So and so is driving me crazy,' \" says Justin. \"We talk about how to handle certain situations.\"\nSays Jim: \"What I'm most proud of is, a lot of times, he won't listen to my suggestions. That's how you know you've done OK as a parent. When your kid makes up his own mind about things.\"\nSo this is how they talk. Nearly every day, as Justin Fuente drives home after a day of work.\n\"It may be only a couple of minutes,\" says Justin.\nIt only has to be a couple of minutes. Any father or son can tell you that.\nAnd this is a father-and-son story, a story of a father who wanted nothing more than to spend time with his kids, and a kid who wanted nothing more than to spend time with his father, and where such a happy confluence can lead.\nThe son, Justin Fuente, will be coaching the Memphis Tigers Friday night when they travel to his hometown to take on the Tulsa Golden Hurricane. The father, Jim Fuente, will be, well, he'll be somewhere in the stadium, but good luck figuring out where.\n\"I don't like to watch the game with a lot of people,\" he says. \"I don't like relatives asking me questions, or laughing.\"\nSays Justin: \"He's grumpy. That's his schtick.\"\nSays Jim: \"I want to get off by myself and watch the game.\"\nYou can see he has the grumpy thing down pat.\nBut before Jim Fuente watched his son's games, he played them, nearly every day, out in the front yard.\n\"My dad was the guy who was always outside, playing with us,\" says Justin. \"If we were playing basketball, he was playing. If we were playing football, he was the quarterback. He loved sports in general. I realized, really quickly, that was something he liked. And I liked to be around him, so we went and did sports things together. My sister, Jamie, was the same way. She didn't have a choice.\"\nSays Jim: \"I'd always get home about an hour before dinner. I lost my dad when I was 16, so my brother and I made up our own games and stuff. It was just natural for me to drag both of the kids out, Justin and his sister. We must have gone through a thousand of those Nerf footballs. We played everything.\"\nJamie went on to play softball at the University of Nebraska. Justin went on to play football at Oklahoma and Murray State, before embarking on his coaching career.\nSpeaking of which, what did Jim say when Justin asked him whether to take the Memphis job?\n\"I thought he was crazy. I said, 'Justin, are you sure?' You're liable to shoot the hell out of your career and get fired before you get started. He said, 'Dad, I'm a football coach. I'm going to get fired sooner or later.' I don't know if many people advised Justin to take the Memphis job. He's pretty confident. He has a belief in what he does. He just saw something, he saw that this program was really down and it shouldn't be, and he could make it better. He was totally convinced of that. It's one of those times I'm glad he didn't listen to me.\"\nWhich bring us to last Saturday, and Fuente's greatest triumph at Memphis. What did Jim Fuente think of the Ole Miss game?\n\"I'll tell you the truth, he couldn't watch it,\" says Justin. \"It's hard on him. You're putting yourself out there, and sometimes it doesn't work out, and it's hard on parents.\"\nSays Jim: \"We're really proud of him, but, to us, it's always stressful. We know how much wins and losses mean. We're not fools.\"\nSo Jim resolved to watch a game other than the Memphis game last Saturday. He got occasional updates from his wife, Lynn, Justin's mom.\n\"She said, 'We're doing pretty good, you want to watch it now?' But by then, I didn't want to jinx it. Justin and I are both a little superstitious. I watched the replay.\"\nAnd what did he think?\n\"I told one of my friends, 'Maybe this kid really knows what he's doing.' \"\nYeah, maybe he does. But don't expect Jim Fuente to get a whole lot more effusive than that. You know how Justin Fuente never allows himself to get too high or too low? That comes straight from his dad.\n\"I've always been that way with my kids,\" Jim says. \"I don't care how damn good you think you are, somebody is always better. And I don't care how bad you think you have it, because someone always has it worse.\"\nOK, but will Jim Fuente at least admit this isn't a bad time to be the stockbroker in charge of his son's finances?\nSays Jim, laughing: \"His cash-flow prospects aren't too bad right now.\"\nAnd that's the kind of thing that can happen when a father takes the time to play with his son, and when a son takes pleasure in playing with his father, and when the whole thing works the way it should. It's not about money or success. It's about family and connection. About knowing there's someone out there who has your back.\nSomeday, Justin Fuente will lose another football game. Someday, somewhere, he may even get canned. But whatever happens, he's got a father he can call to review the events of the day.\n\"He'll tell me, 'You think you've got problems,' \" says Fuente. \"That's my dad.\"\nTo reach Geoff Calkins, call 901-529-2364 or email calkins@commercialappeal.com.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T03:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T10:34:16.365+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
