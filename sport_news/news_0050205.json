The 37-year-old, who has hinted of retirement after next year's World Twenty20, now has 293 wickets in 65 Tests. World record holder Muttiah Muralitharan and Chaminda Vaas are the only Sri Lankans with over 300 wickets, and Herath looks certain to pass that milestone. Sri Lanka still miss their legends Sri Lanka's poor batting in the second Test when they were shot out for 200 and 206 showed how much they miss their retired greats, Mahela Jayawardene and Kumar Sangakkara. Jayawardene quit Tests last year and Sangakkara went after playing two Tests against India in August, leaving a gaping hole at the top of the order. Those are big shoes to fill and Sri Lanka will hope young players stand up and be counted. Free-falling Windies reduce Sobers to tears The West Indies have slipped so badly over the years that their plight reduced the legendary Garfield Sobers to tears recently. Gone are the days when the West Indies ruled world cricket in the 1970s and 1980s under Clive Lloyd and Vivian Richards. Now, internal bickering and administrative chaos has taken over. Coach Phil Simmons was suspended from the Sri Lankan tour for voicing unhappiness at the omission of Dwayne Bravo and Kieron Pollard from the one-day squad. The Test captaincy was thrust on 23-year-old Jason Holder. The 2-0 defeat would not have surprised anyone. To bowl or not to bowl West Indies all-rounder Marlon Samuels was reported for a suspect bowling action for the third time in his career during the first Test in Galle. The off-spinner, who was reported previously in 2008 and 2013, is preparing to undergo testing. If he fails the test, he will be suspended indefinitely till he rectifies his action. That would prove to be a further blow for the already struggling West Indies cricket.
