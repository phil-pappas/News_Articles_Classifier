(Gary Walts | gwalts@syracuse.com ) \nSyracuse, N.Y. — Syracuse football is aiming to end a two-game skid Saturday afternoon at Virginia. \nLet's take a look at what is on readers' minds before the Orange's ACC road opener. \nReminder, each week we'll answer your Syracuse football questions. To submit a question, email Nate Mink at nmink@syracuse.com . You can also reach him on Twitter: @MinkNate . \nWe also encourage writing an actual letter to 220 S. Warren St., Syracuse, N.Y. 13202. What's on your mind, SU football fans? Tweet me your questions for this week's mailbag — Nate Mink (@MinkNate) October 15, 2015 @MinkNate Do you think we will see Seamus Shanley back starting soon? Weird they pulled him out when they seemed to be having success — Dale Sturdevant (@Narfplayer3) October 13, 2015 \nFor those not familiar with the timeline here, a quick rundown: \nShanley, a walk-on from West Genesee High School, earned the starting right guard position coming out of the preseason and started the first three games. \nSyracuse opted for a lineup change against LSU, sliding Rob Trudo over to right guard and inserting Jason Emerich at center. At the time, it was said Trudo's lower-body injuries affected his ability to snap. \nAfter evaluating the line during the off week, the staff kept Emerich at center because of his improved ability to stay on blocks. \nThe Orange has not run the ball well the last couple weeks, but Scott Shafer has been steadfast in his appraisal of the offensive line this season, touting the veteran unit when much of the attention has gone to the younger skill players. \nTo that end, it's tough to forecast the lineup changing again. If the staff feels Emerich is the best option at center (and it certainly appears that is the case), Shanley will remain a viable reserve at guard along with Aaron Roberts. @MinkNate what adjustments did the defense make this week? It's obvious that the defensive game plan isn't working — Bob (@CuseontheLoose) October 15, 2015 \nWhat's obvious is the execution and fundamentals aren't always there at times. That's going to happen when about 50 percent of your defensive snaps are coming from players who have never played in a game prior to this season. \nThe staff saw challenges coming months ago. Is anybody really surprised that replacing eight starters on defense doesn't come with some dropoff? \nLast week at South Florida, Syracuse did not get off blocks well, so the staff said that would be drilled more this week in practice. @MinkNate how are we 7-point underdogs this week? — Chris Brockman (@chrisbrockman) October 15, 2015 \nSyracuse opened the week as an eight-point underdog at Virginia . The line has since moved, but the Cavaliers will likely still be a touchdown favorite by Saturday afternoon's 3:30 kickoff. \nHow? \nWhy? \nColleague Brent Axe spoke with a Vegas insider on this very subject earlier this week. \nIn short, the belief is Virginia is better than its record indicates given its challenging nonconference schedule. \nI wouldn't get too hung up on point spreads, though, Chris. I'm not sure Syracuse will be favored in many ACC games the rest of the way.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T17:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T20:56:05.625+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
