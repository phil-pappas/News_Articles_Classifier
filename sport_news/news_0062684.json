Ted Gaines, recalled her as a nurturing mother and priest \nShe was called to the ministry after a particularly poignant moment in her life The Rev. Canon Winifred Gaines as State Senate chaplain California State Senate i \nblindelof@sacbee.com \nMemorial services are scheduled Friday for the Rev. Canon Winifred B. “Winnie” Gaines, the first female priest in the Episcopal Diocese of Northern California. \nMrs. Gaines, who had suffered strokes in the past few years, died on Sept. 30 at the age of 87. \n“The same attributes as a mother also made her a good priest,” said her son, State Sen. Ted Gaines, R-Roseville. “She was a loving, nurturing mother. She treated her congregation the same way.” \nServices for the retired priest are scheduled for 7 p.m. Friday at Trinity Cathedral, 2620 Capitol Ave. \nIn addition to being the first woman ordained as a priest in the Episcopal Diocese of Northern California, Mrs. Gaines was also the first female chaplain of the California State Senate, according to her son. \nAs a priest, she helped those in need whether it was marriage counseling or providing spiritual comfort and guidance to hundreds of Sacramento families in end of life situations. \n“Pastoral care was her long-suit,” said the Rev. Canon Lynell Walker. “She was the one at the cathedral who visited the sick and dying. She prayed with families. She was extraordinarily good at it.” \nWalker said that in the early days of Mrs. Gaines’ life as a member of the clergy, some members of the congregation avoided receiving communion from a female priest. \n“It was not easy for her,” said Walker. “People would calculate where she would stand during the distribution of communion and line up on the other side across from a male. That was the culture, but, because of her efforts, that has changed. It is a total non-issue now.” \nIn a story by freelance writer Barb Chandler published in The Bee in 2001, Mrs. Gaines said she was called to the ministry after a particularly sad moment in her life, the death of her daughter, Mary Louise, in the early 1970s. \n“I became aware of my calling to ministry when my 2-year-old daughter died,” Mrs. Gaines said. “While my daughter was sick, I started searching the Bible to find out the meaning of life and death. Her death was a conversion experience for me. Before it, I didn't want anything to do with organized religion. I thought people who went to church were weak and just needed a crutch, and I didn't believe I was that type of person.” \nAfter her daughter’s death, she became very involved in the church. In 1973, she approached then-Bishop Clarence Thompson of the Northern California diocese and asked to be ordained as a deacon, a position she eventually realized. \n“I assumed I would be ordained a deacon because at that time woman could not be ordained priests,” Mrs. Gaines said. “However, the bishop wanted me to go to seminary.” \nShe said that step proved to be advantageous, because, in 1976, the official governing body of the Episcopal Church passed a resolution for the ordination of woman. \nTo be ordained, however, Mrs. Gaines needed to meet with a special church committee to persuade its members to recommend her to the bishop for ordination. The committee members had their doubts that a woman could be ordained until they met with her, she remembered. \nAfter being ordained, Mrs. Gaines became a hospital chaplain at Mercy San Juan Hospital. She was also assigned to work with terminally ill people in hospice. \n“I thought I was going to help other people, but I quickly learned that the people I worked with were the greatest gifts of all,” she said. \nThe Rt. Rev. Barry L. Beisner, bishop of the Sacramento diocese, on Tuesday lauded her long ministry throughout the diocese and at the midtown Trinity Cathedral. \n“Winnie Gaines had a true pastor’s heart,” he said. “It is also true that she was a bold pioneer, but it was because she had a deep and abiding love for the people of God.” \nMrs. Gaines, a native of Sacramento, graduated from Sacramento High School and University of California, Berkeley. She received a Masters in Divinity from the Church Divinity School of the Pacific. \nShe is survived by her husband of 64 years, Robert; her sisters Jennifer Langan, Kitty Davis and Debbie Davis; her children Robert Gaines, Jr., Clare Andrews, Ted Gaines, Peter Gaines and Margaret Hutchinson; 15 grandchildren and one great-grandchild. \nRemembrances may be sent to the Winnie Gaines Scholarship Fund, Church Divinity School of the Pacific, 2451 Ridge Road, Berkeley, 94709-1211.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T22:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-07T00:14:23.642+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
