He sees him as a mentor and a friend. \nKnowing the disappointment that Lecavalier went through last season and already is going through again this season, Stamkos feels bad. \nBut Stamkos, one of hockey's biggest stars, understands why Lecavalier, 35, was a healthy scratch 17 times last season and will sit again Thursday night when the Lightning and Flyers open their 2015-16 schedule at Amalie Arena. \n\"It's just the reality is that the kids that are coming into the league now are that much more ready than they were in the past 15-20 years physically, mentally and skill wise,\" said Stamkos, who was a teammate of Lecavalier from 2008-09 to 2012-13. \"It's pretty amazing to see. This is the best league in the world. You've got the best players playing in it and sometimes there are tough decisions that need to be made and you have to life with it.\" \nALSO: Coburn: Losing to Timonen in Cup Final \"incredibly disappointing\" \nStamkos pointed out the oldest players on Lightning are 31. \n\"It's kind of a changing of the guard,\" Stamkos said. \"It's tough (for aging players like Lecavalier) with the amount of skill and speed that's been implemented in this league. You've seen a lot of great hockey players not even be able to get jobs anymore and that's tough to see.\" \nNo matter, Stamkos is rooting for Lecavalier, who is beginning the third season of a seemingly untradeable five-year, $22.5 million contract. \n\"You never want to ex-teammates/friends in his position where you don't get a chance to go out there and play,\" he said. \"As an athlete, you take pride in your performance. You want to go out there and believe that you can be a difference maker on the ice given the chance. It's tough. \n\"Obviously, I've known Vinny for a long time and learned a lot from him as a leader. He's going to be a professional during this time. He'll continue to work hard and hopefully get a chance. ... When you don't get an opportunity, it's tough to show what you can do.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T20:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T22:09:32.584+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
