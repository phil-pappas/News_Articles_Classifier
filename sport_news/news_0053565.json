This time, though, the Patriots didn’t embarrass the Colts, as it was the Colts who did it to themselves.\nTrailing 27-21 with 1:14 remaining in the third quarter and facing fourth-and-3 at its own 37, Indy used an illegal punt formation to throw off the Pats, but it backfired in epic fashion. Wide receiver Griff Whalen snapped the ball to safety Colt Anderson, the pair isolated together in the middle of the field with the remainder of the Indy formation banked to the right sideline, but Pats running back Brandon Bolden stuffed Anderson for a 1-yard loss.\n“I think there was a lot of confusion out there, honestly,” said defensive back Logan Ryan. “I don’t know what the goal of that play was, but I’m happy that we were able to defend it.”\nThe Colts had no chance to convert, as Bolden, linebacker Jon Bostic, Ryan and defensive back Nate Ebner were all over the snapper. Though the Pats had never seen the play before, Ryan said they read their keys and knew they would execute if the ball was snapped because they had the personnel advantage.\nSix plays later, quarterback Tom Brady scrambled and hit running back LeGarrette Blount for an 11-yard touchdown that pushed the Pats’ lead to 34-21 in the fourth quarter.\nBrady was sharp throughout, completing 23-of-37 passes for 312 yards, three touchdowns and one pick, but that score all but ended the game.\nQuarterback Andrew Luck (30-of-50, 312 yards, three touchdowns) diced up the Patriots on the game’s opening series. Wide receiver Donte Moncrief beat cornerback Malcolm Butler on the fade route to give the Colts a 7-0 lead, and the stadium operators fired off a first round of fireworks, confetti and glitter.\nThe Patriots’ pent-up anger after nine months of Deflategate-induced drama, which was launched by the Colts after the AFC Championship Game, was ever present on the ensuing drive. Brady and Edelman connected for a 12-yard touchdown to tie the score, 7-7, and the shifty receiver dashed to the back of the end zone to unleash a fastball toward the Colts’ horseshoe logo.\n“I’m always emotional,” a smirking Edelman said. “You know that.”\nThe Patriots took a 10-7 lead in the second quarter when kicker Stephen Gostkowski made a 40-yard field goal, and they had slowed down Luck’s offense to seize control of the game by forcing a couple of punts after the scoring drive.\nThat momentum quickly evaporated when Edelman lost control of an easy pass on a crossing route toward the right sideline. He corralled the pass then juggled it right into safety Mike Adams’ hands for Brady’s first interception of the season. Adams walked into the end zone for a 14-yard pick-six that put the Colts ahead, 14-10, with 11:30 remaining in the second quarter.\n“I let (Brady) down,” Edelman said. “That interception should be on me. My guy is playing great ball, and it’s unfortunate. No excuses. We have to get better next week.”\nThe Patriots caught a break right after that when the Colts appeared to recover a surprise onside kick, but the officiating crew, with the help of a replay review, awarded possession to the Pats. Blount closed the quick drive by storming through the right side of the line for a 38-yard touchdown and a 17-14 lead.\nThe Colts’ ensuing drive culminated on third down when Luck scrambled away from an enclosing pass rush, and wide receiver T.Y. Hilton spun free behind Ryan for a 3-yard TD connection and a 21-17 Indy lead with 2:38 to play in the first half.\nThe Patriotss settled for a 35-yard Gostkowski field goal, which trimmed the deficit to 21-20, at the half.\nOn the first possession of the second half, tight end Rob Gronkowski, who was shut out in the first half, caught a pass over the middle, split two defenders and scored an easy 25-yard TD as the Pats reclaimed a lead, 27-21.\nThe defense held from there, keeping the Colts off the scoreboard for their first six second-half possessions.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T11:30:09.340+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
