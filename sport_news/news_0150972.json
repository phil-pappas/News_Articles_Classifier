Should we be talking more about a possible San Clemente resurgence? Can La Habra be beat in the Freeway League? And why do Westminster (4-0) and Garden Grove (3-1) keep plummeting in the Southern Division coaches poll? \nOh, and Damian muses on Orange County volleyball for the first time this season. \nAll this and more on OCVarsity On the Record!", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T00:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T01:19:15.740+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
