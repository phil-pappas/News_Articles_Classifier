Other than the Mariners propensity for hiring guys named Jim to manage the club, if you take out Piniella, who managed the club for 10 seasons, that 2 season average drops to 1.6 seasons per manager. \nThat’s 18 managers in 29 years. Maybe, just maybe, the problem isn’t the guy calling the shots in the dugout. \nNever the less, the Mariners are going to hire a new manager, probably within the next week or so. While new Mariners GM, Jerry Dipoto hasn’t officially named any finalists, here’s a look at what is likely his short list. Jason Varitek \nA candidate that has popped up on the radar is former Mariners and Red Sox catcher, Jason Varitek . You most likely will remember Varitek as a Mariner only because he was part of a trade package that the M’s sent to Boston in one of the worst deals in their entire franchise history. \nThe M’s sent Varitek along with pitcher Derek Lowe to the Red Sox for one closer named Heathcliff Slocumb . Varitek turned into a solid, everyday catcher and team captain for the Sox. Lowe was a solid starter and reliever in his time as well. The M’s got a year and half of crap out of Slocumb. \nVaritek has no managerial experience to speak of at any level of baseball but he was a catcher, and one of the smartest baseball has ever seen. It’s not a stretch to think he can do the job. The big concern would be, does he really want the job? \nSince his departure from Seattle in 1997, Varitek has put down strong roots in Boston. I just don’t see him leaving Bean Town although I’d certainly welcome the idea. Raul Ibanez and Dan Wilson \nBoth Raul Ibanez and Dan Wilson are names any Mariners fan will recognize. The former outfielder and former catcher for the M’s are both well-liked by fans, smart enough to do the job well, and have absolutely no managerial experience what so ever. \nIf your goals is to sell tickets, putting Wilson and/or Ibanez in the dugout alongside hitting coach Edgar Martinez, well then you have the perfect choices all figured out. \nThe romantic in me wants this coaching staff in the dugout. These are all guys I grew up emulating as a high school and college player but I just fear it wouldn’t work out. \nGuess what happens if it doesn’t work out? I get to write and you get to read a headline that says the Seattle Mariners fire Edgar Martinez , Dan Wilson and Raul Ibanez . Talk about a gut punch. Realistically, It’s Bogar’s job to lose at this point. Tim Bogar \nHere’s the leading candidate– Tim Bogar . Bogar actually has some managerial experience, although it was as interim manager of the Texas Rangers when he was promoted to the top dog in the dugout following Ron Washington’s resignation. \nBogar also has considerable experience managing in the minor leagues. He started his managerial career in 2004 with the Greeneville Astros of the Rookie-level Appalachian League. Greeneville finished with a 41–26 (.612) record and won the Appalachian League championship and Bogar was selected as manager of the year. He was promoted in 2005 to the Astros’ low Class-A affiliate, the Lexington Legends of the South Atlantic League, where he led the Legends to a league best 82–57 mark and was named the 2005 SAL’s top skipper. \nMinor league accolades aside, Bogar’s best trait to get the M’s managerial job might be the fact that he’s Jerry Dipoto’s buddy. Yup, the two are close, close enough that when Bogar didn’t wind up with the Rangers managerial job permanently, Dipoto hired him to be a special assistant to the GM in the Angels organization. \nIt’s not what you know, it’s who you know. It always seems to come back to that doesn’t it? \nThe question now is, Will Bogar buck the trend and make the M’s a winner or will be having this discussion again in 1.6 seasons?
