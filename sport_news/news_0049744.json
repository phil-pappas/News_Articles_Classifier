Or maybe it was just a temporary respite for the beleaguered Longhorns and their coach. \nRegardless, the 24-17 win against the 10th-ranked Sooners was no ordinary victory for Texas. \n\"We heard all week how the pride has been lost. How we don't play hard,\" Strong said. \"And I don't have an answer for last week [TCU 50, Texas 7]. … This week we came out and we wanted to impose our will. We wanted to play physical and watch our team just go to work.\" \nThe Longhorns (2-4, 1-2 Big 12) worked over Oklahoma's defense with 313 yards rushing. Their defense went to work on quarterback Baker Mayfield and the Sooners' offensive line, blitzing and stunting their way to six sacks. \nNaashon Hughes and Poona Ford buried Mayfield for a 17-yard loss on a third-and-14 deep in Oklahoma territory late in the fourth quarter on what turned out to be a fitting last offensive play of the game for the Sooners. \nNo. 1 OHIO STATE 49, MARYLAND 28 (at Columbus, Ohio) — Cardale Jones threw two touchdown passes, J.T. Barrett scored three times and Ohio State remained unbeaten — and mostly underwhelming — with the victory over Maryland. \nEzekiel Elliott had two touchdowns for the Buckeyes (6-0, 2-0 Big Ten), who were tied at 21 in the third before shaking free of the Terrapins (2-4, 0-2) and extending the nation's longest winning streak to 19. Ohio State has won 26 straight regular-season Big Ten games. \nOhio State coach Urban Meyer juggled his quarterbacks, using Jones to start drives and Barrett to finish them. Jones threw a 19-yard TD pass to Braxton Miller and connected on a 48-yarder to Jalin Marshall. \nOutscored 73-6 the past two weeks, the Terrapins put up a fight amid speculation about coach Randy Edsall's future with the program. Maryland quarterback Perry Hills ran for 170 yards and two TDs. \nNo. 2 TCU 52, KANSAS STATE 45 (at Manhattan, Kan.) — Trevone Boykin threw for 301 yards and two touchdowns, the second a 55-yard strike to Josh Doctson with 1:10 left in the game, and TCU rallied from a big halftime deficit to win. \nBoykin also ran for 124 yards and two scores for the Horned Frogs (6-0, 3-0 Big 12), who trailed, 35-17, at the break. Aaron Green added 124 yards and two touchdowns rushing, while Doctson caught eight passes for 155 yards and two touchdowns. \nNo. 3 BAYLOR 66, KANSAS 7 (at Lawrence, Kan.) — Seth Russell threw three touchdown passes and Shock Linwood ran for 135 yards and a score as Baylor romped past Kansas. \nRussell threw for 246 yards, all in the first half. Two of the TD strikes went to Corey Coleman, pushing his nation-leading total to 13. The other touchdown pass went to 6-foot-7, 410-pound tight end LaQuan McGowan, helping the Bears (5-0, 2-0 Big 12) to a 52-7 halftime lead. \nNo. 6 CLEMSON 43, GEORGIA TECH 24 (at Clemson, S.C.) — Deshaun Watson threw two touchdown passes, Wayne Gallman ran for two scores and Clemson surged past Georgia Tech. \nOn the same soggy field where the Tigers (5-0, 2-0 ACC) outlasted Notre Dame last week, they made quick work of the Yellow Jackets (2-4, 0-3). \nGeorgia Tech has four straight for the first time since 1996. \nNo. 7 LSU 45, SOUTH CAROLINA 24 (at Baton Rouge, La.) — Leonard Fournette had an 87-yard touchdown run and Brandon Harris passed for a career-best 228 yards as LSU won in a game moved because of flooding in South Carolina. \nFournette finished with a season-low 158 yards on 20 carries in three quarters. Freshman Derrius Guice rushed for 161 yards and a TD, fellow running back Darrel Williams scored twice and the Tigers (5-0, 3-0 SEC) piled up 396 yards rushing. \nNo. 8 ALABAMA 27, ARKANSAS 14 (at Tuscaloosa, Ala.) — Calvin Ridley caught an 81-yard touchdown pass from Jake Coker and Alabama rode its swarming defense to the victory. \nStymied by early mistakes, the Crimson Tide (5-1, 2-1 SEC) scored 24 points over the final 17 minutes after trailing the Razorbacks (2-4, 1-2) at the half. © 2015 North Jersey Media Group Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T08:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T18:22:24.545+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
