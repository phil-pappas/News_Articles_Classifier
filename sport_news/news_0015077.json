One is taking what could be his final national campaign lap; the other, his first.\nBut Bill Clinton and Marco Rubio share one thing: Both are known for their charisma on the stage and stump, and both brought those skills to the Philadelphia region Thursday.\nClinton was raising money for his wife's presidential campaign; Rubio, for his own.\nThough Pennsylvania is considered a battleground state, candidates have to survive primaries and caucuses in about 30 other states before voters here get to punch a ballot. But the hunt for funding knows no state borders.\nA couple hundred Hillary Rodham Clinton supporters, high off her debate performance the other night, gathered at Philadelphia's Mutter Museum on Thursday to hear her husband fan their fervor and rally them to reach for their checkbooks.\nBill Clinton is good at that. In a fitted blue suit, his iconic shock of white hair highlighted by the afternoon sun, he smiled, waved, and disappeared into the museum to greet about 200 buttoned-up, high-powered lawyers and politicos who later emerged from the closed-door campaign fund-raiser almost giddy.\n\"He seems to be bigger than life,\" said lawyer Joe Mistrano.\nNotable Democratic attendees included former Gov. Ed Rendell, mayoral nominee Jim Kenney, former U.S. Rep. Allyson Y. Schwartz (she co-hosted), and U.S. Senate candidate Katie McGinty.\nDonations ranged from $250 to $2,700, the maximum allowed. Organizers did not answer requests for the total raised, though Schwartz said the event was expected to hit its goal. \"Some people gave more than they might even have wanted to, because they share that feeling of pride in who Hillary is and her performance the other night.\"\nClinton, 69, made the rounds, posing for photos with top donors in a private room, and in the main hall for shots snapped on cellphones. Speaking without notes, he said an officeholder should be judged on three things on which he said his wife has delivered: Are people better off than before? Did you do something to make the world's children safer? And did you build things or tear things apart?\nClinton, donors said, also told of the night Osama bin Laden was killed. President Obama called every living president with the notification, Clinton recalled. On the phone, Obama said he assumed Clinton's wife - then secretary of state - had already told him.\nClinton said he assured Obama: \"She wouldn't have told me. She works for you.\"\nRendell, a longtime Hillary Clinton backer, called it a \"great day to be a Democrat\" in Philadelphia.\nHours later, some might have called it a great day to be a Republican in King of Prussia, where an evening audience sat captivated by Rubio. At the end of a day that netted him $550,000 in donations, the Florida senator exhorted about 700 listeners at the fall reception for the Republican Committee of Chester County.\n\"There is nothing before this country we cannot fix,\" said Rubio, 44, who spent Thursday morning and afternoon with other potential donors in Philadelphia. He is scheduled to make rounds in Pittsburgh on Friday.\nThe crowd received Rubio's remarks with cheers and whistles as he argued for the need for a new generation in government - offering himself as the face of that generation and of the GOP.\n\"It's great to hear that and have a relatable candidate,\" said Lance Chappelle, 23, a high school teacher from Chester County. He had not been sold on Rubio when he arrived Thursday night but was converted into a supporter by the speech.\nRubio looked to augment his fund-raising with a $1,500-a-head VIP reception before the speech at the Crowne Plaza hotel. The largely Chester County-based audience included many state and county GOP officials. Chester County, Pennsylvania's wealthiest and fastest-growing county, is the only one of the four counties nearest Philadelphia that still has a Republican voter-registration edge.\nSome attendees, citing frustrations with the rise of outsider candidates Donald Trump and Ben Carson, said the party needs to focus on viable contenders. Many believed that Rubio could be one.\n\"Rubio is more like a grown-up candidate,\" said Joseph Lacek of Glenmoore.\nThough Rubio roused the crowd, some were not fully sold on the young Florida senator.\n\"I am still with Jeb Bush. . . . I think he has experience,\" said Carol Aichele, who was secretary of the commonwealth under Republican Gov. Tom Corbett.\nBut Rubio won at least some minds.\n\"After this, I believe he can do what he says,\" said Lacek's wife, Lisa Henry-Lacek, a 58-year-old designer. \"I was in tears.\"\njmcdaniel@philly.com\n610-313-8205\n@McDanielJustine", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T13:17:48.123+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
