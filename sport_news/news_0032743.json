The Commission is learnt to have conveyed to the representatives of JD (U), RJD and Congress that under Section 126 of Representation of the People Act, there is no legal bar on people to campaign outside areas going to polls. Section 126 deals with prohibition on campaigning 48 hours before the elections but does not state that campaigning cannot be held in nearby areas not going to poll on the same date. The 'mahagathbandhan' or grand alliance consisting of Janata Dal (United), Rashtriya Janata Dal and Congress had yesterday approached the Commission seeking a ban on live telecast of Modi's poll rallies in Bihar on the ground it could influence voters of constituencies going to poll today. Voting for the first phase of 5-stage Bihar Assembly election is was held today. Modi addressed a rally in Bhabua near Sasaram today. BJP had opposed the demand and dubbed it as an attempt to scuttle democracy. \"How can you ensure that telecast is not shown in areas going to election...many parties hold campaign. But we see that in their campaign they do not address the voters or issues of constituencies going for poll on that particular day,\" an EC official said. â€” PTI", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T20:10:38.721+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
