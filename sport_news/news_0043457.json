AP Photo/Rainier Ehrhardt/File × CLEMSON — The richer the coach, the higher the ranking? Not so, at this point in October. USA Today released its annual database of head coaching salaries , and the teams currently topping the Associated Press poll aren’t necessarily in the top 10 — or even top 15 — at the bank. South Carolina coach Steve Spurrier, making a total of $4,028,600 in 2015 before bonuses, ranks No. 15 in the nation in 2015 salary. That ranks seventh-highest in the SEC overall, but second in the SEC East behind Georgia’s Mark Richt. Clemson coach Dabo Swinney will make $3,305,200 this year, which ranks No. 26 on the list. His team is currently ranked sixth in the country. Urban Meyer’s top-ranked Ohio State squad rewards the defending national champ with a $5.86 million salary, third-highest nationally behind Alabama’s Nick Saban ($7.08 million) and Michigan’s Jim Harbaugh ($7 million.) In between Ohio State and Clemson in the AP team rankings are TCU’s Gary Patterson ($3.94 million) at No. 19 on the salary list, Baylor’s Art Briles ($4.24 million) at 11th, Michigan State’s Mark Dantonio at No. 21 and Utah’s Kyle Whittingham ($2.6 million) way down the list at No. 40. The SEC occupies 13 of the top 27 spots in terms of salary. All but Vanderbilt’s Derek Mason, whose private institution is not required to release salary information, are reported to earn at least $3.26 million this season. Swinney, at $3.3 million, has a lower paycheck than 12 SEC coaches. No. 6 Clemson is ranked one spot above LSU, the highest-ranked SEC team in this week’s AP poll. Swinney does take home more than every ACC coach except Jimbo Fisher, whose $5.15 million earnings from Florida State ranks fifth overall.
