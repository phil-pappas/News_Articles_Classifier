Kyle Flood factor. After being suspended for the last three games, coach Kyle Flood returns to the sideline . Not much has changed from a preparation standpoint given that the terms of Flood’s suspension left him in charge of the program six days a week. Assistant head coach Norries Wilson did an admirable job in a tough spot and had Rutgers poised to upset No. 4 Michigan State. He also owned a late-game clock management miscue that probably had no impact on the outcome but certainly drew attention to the fact that Flood was M.I.A. Flood said he felt “helpless” watching the games on TV. Now is his best chance ever to prove his value.\n2. Who’s at quarterback? Indiana coaches are trying to spin the situation as the offense remains the same no matter who is at quarterback. Not buying it. Gunslinger Nate Sudfeld led Indiana to its first 4-0 start since 1990 and what might have been against No. 1 Ohio State if he had not gotten injured. Sudfeld didn’t play against Penn State and Indiana’s high-octane attack managed seven points. If he is back, Indiana is much more dangerous. If he isn’t, Rutgers could face a third-string freshman (Danny Cameron) because backup Xander Diamont was injured against Penn State. This revolving door is nothing new at Indiana. When the shifty Diamont started against Rutgers last year, he actually was No. 4 on the depth chart.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T16:07:51.334+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
