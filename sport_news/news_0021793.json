Good news is always welcome, right? How about a double dose of good news?\nOn this day, we ask that Frank Barton and Scott Yaich take a well-earned bow: Barton for his 13 years of service as the hunt test secretary at the annual Master National Retriever Hunt test and Yaich for recently receiving the Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies' highest honor, the Seth Gordon Award.\nNot bad for two people who love what they do and don't ask for recognition.\nBarton, 59, who lives in Marion, Arkansas, is midway through his hunt test secretary duties at the 24th MNRHT on the grounds of the H. Cooper Black Recreation Area in Cheraw, South Carolina.\n\"If you are a dog person, whether it is retrievers, pointers or a horse person, this is the mecca for you to come to,\" said Barton, who owns two ATV dealerships in East Arkansas. \"It is something I look forward to every year no matter where it might be.\"\nBarton isn't sure how many miles he has covered in his duties with the MNRHT.\n\"I have no idea,\" he said. \"I've been to California three times and Maryland once and a bunch of times to Texas. So, there is no telling how many miles I've driven. I do know how many miles I have on my truck – 280,000 – and a lot of those miles came on trips to the Master National.\"\nSo what are his duties?\nIt's quite simple – Barton counts and recounts and recounts the dogs in the field. This year's event attracted a record 915 entries from 43 states, including Alaska.\n\"I know how many dogs there are and where each of them come from,\" Barton said. \"I know how many times they have qualified (for the MNRHT). It is a working vacation, but there a lot of people out here who love dogs just like I do. They come here year-in and year-out. I have good company with me.\"\nWhen a dog passes or qualifies at a weekend Master hunt test held by an MNRHT member club, that qualifying score counts toward qualifying the dog to run in the annual Master National event.\nOnly two dogs have passed the MNRHT nine times, Barton said. A few others have passed it seven or eight times. Only 245 in the event's history have passed it at least once.\n\"To take a dog and pass this event, say three times, you've got a really, really good dog,\" Barton said. \"Those are special animals.\"\nCheraw is located in northeast South Carolina. It escaped the brunt of the recent floods in the state, but there were some travel problems because of high water. Barton said I-95 was closed for several days but opened before the event, which opened Saturday and runs through Oct. 25.\nAs for Yaich, he was \"shocked and humbled\" to be recognized by his peers.\n\"I have known a lot of the awardees in the past, including my old boss, Steve Wilson, when I worked for the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission,\" said Yaich, 62, who lives in Collierville. \"I know other state directors who won the award and I just don't put myself in the same category as those people.\"\nHe might not, but others do.\n\"Scott has worked tirelessly on waterfowl conservation for decades, and I couldn't think of a better person to receive this great honor,\" said Paul Schmidt, DU's chief of conservation. \"Scott truly deserves this award and I'm honored to call him a colleague and friend.\"\nYaich, who has been with DU for 14 years, said he went on his first duck-hunting trip to southern Illinois when he was in grad school in 1974.\n\"It was a green-tree hunt and man was it great,\" he said. \"I was 21 and I was hooked immediately. I love what I do (for DU). My heart since that day in the woods has been with waterfowl conservation, and coming to DU was an opportunity to focus all my energy in that direction.\"\nYaich is among the headliners at Bass Pro Shops at The Pyramid's Waterfowl Expo that began Saturday and runs through Oct. 25. He'll join Dale Earnhardt Jr., Si Robertson, Dude Perfect, local call maker and DU partner Buck Gardner and DU TV host Field Hudnall.\nThe Expo is an extension of DU Month, when Bass Pro Shops retail stores across the U.S. offer the \"Round Up for Conservation\" program when making purchases. In addition to donations from customers, Bass Pro will match 50 percent of each donation.
