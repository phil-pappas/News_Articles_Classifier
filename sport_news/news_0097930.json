A lift took beekeepers 140 feet up to the 10th floor of the Maritime Building.\n\"It was amazing,\" said Ryan Abadie, an expert on the job. \"I've seen large hives before, but I've never seen a hive like that.\"\nIn Marrero, Gueho is transferring thousands of those bees into a commercial hive to make honey.\n\"The hive we got last night was so big I've had to subdivide it,\" he said.\nWhen the bees were taken to Marrero, they were let go in an orange orchard. They got the nectar and pollen needed to take back to a hive and make orange blossom honey.\nIt will take these bees months to make honey in the new hive. Gueho says the hive taken from the CBD held gallons of the sweet stuff.\nCopyright 2015 WVUE.
