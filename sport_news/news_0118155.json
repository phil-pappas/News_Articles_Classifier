The former Wisconsin forward played his last game with Milwaukee on Tuesday at the Kohl Center, the Badgers' home court in Madison, when the Bucks beat Minnesota 106-88. \nLandry had five points, three rebounds and two blocks, playing the entire fourth quarter. He received a warm reception from the crowd. \nBut the 6-foot-7 Landry's odds to make a Bucks roster stocked with young talent were slim, especially with forward Jabari Parker expected to return to the floor by mid-November from a left knee injury. \nThe team also waived guard Jorge Gutierrez and forward Josh Powell on Wednesday. 0", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T20:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T21:20:27.594+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
