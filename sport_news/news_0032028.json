Mr. Happy. (Darryl Dyck/AP Photo/The Canadian Press) \nTSN‚Äôs Darren Dreger on Wednesday reported that the Columbus Blue Jackets, who are off to an exceptionally lousy 0-7-0 start, had fired Coach Todd Richards and hired John Tortorella , who was fired by Vancouver in 2014 after just one year with the Canucks. \nIn other news, Brandon Dubinsky‚Äôs life just got much more interesting. The Blue Jackets center said his relationship with Tortorella ‚Äúfell apart‚Äù when the two were last paired on the Rangers in 2011-12. Torts: Now throw your body in front of the shot and block it. Players: Um‚Ä¶coach? That‚Äôs the goal celebration cannon. Torts: I SAID BLOCK IT! \n‚Äî Down Goes Brown (@DownGoesBrown) October 21, 2015 I would pay money for a live shot of Brandon Dubinsky being informed of this. https://t.co/6Pk1hMWgWA \n‚Äî Jesse Spector (@jessespector) October 21, 2015 \"That's what I'm tellin' ya Portzy, why DON'T YOU [EXPLETIVE] LISTEN AND TURN OFF YA DAMN PHONE!\" -CBJ media room, 12/1/15 cc: @Aportzline \n‚Äî Greg Wyshynski (@wyshynski) October 21, 2015 When Torts was fired by Canucks, a lot of people thought he was done as an NHL coach. That was like 18 months ago. \n‚Äî Jason Brough (@JasonPHT) October 21, 2015 üé∂ Hello Dubi my old friend I've come to coach with you again üé∂ pic.twitter.com/Uyp6knUYNR \n‚Äî Dave Bozo (@davelozo) October 21, 2015 \nTortorella‚Äôs hiring is good news for fans of profanity-filled, hostile press conferences, dagger stares and laughing at other people‚Äôs rage, but probably not great news for members of the Columbus Blue Jackets, who are now totally gonna get yelled at. \nWhat makes Tortorella so mad? Literally everything. Let‚Äôs review. CELLPHONES!!! \nTortorella has been waging a war on cellphones for years. As a bonus, here‚Äôs an exchange from 2013, when Tortorella was coaching the Rangers, via The Post‚Äôs Mark Giannotto : \n‚ÄúBut I‚Äôm not gonna talk about injuries and I‚Äôm certainly not gonna talk about the lineup each and every day,‚Äù Tortorella said, ‚ÄúAnd I‚Äôm not gonna answer questions ‚Ä¶that begin with, ‚ÄòCan you talk about?‚Äô Ask me a question and I‚Äôll do the best I can to answer that.‚Äù \nMoments later, as he actually responded to a question, a cell phone began ringing in the middle of his answer. \n‚ÄúThat‚Äôs another thing ‚Ä¶ I am going to walk if a cell phone goes off,‚Äù Tortorella said, cutting himself off.
