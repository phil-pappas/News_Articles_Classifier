But I’m going to decide what’s best for me academically, running and a place where I’ll be happiest even if I can’t run.\"\nSullivan’s top choices appear to be West Point and the Air Force Academy, although the Clarkstown, N.Y. senior also might visit American University and the University of Kentucky.\nChoosing a service academy requires a physical and passing a fitness test in addition to the traditional application and also requires a nomination from his Congressman, Senators or other eligible nominator.\n\"I’m trying to get my application complete by the end of the month,\" said Sullivan, who will run at Manhattan on Oct. 10. \"I’ve done my official visits to West Point and the Air Force Academy, but now its time to concentrate on getting the applications done and running.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T04:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T10:33:35.448+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
