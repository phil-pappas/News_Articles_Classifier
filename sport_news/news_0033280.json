The AHSAA Medical Advisory Committee also supports the rule, officials said. \n“We understand just how important limiting pitches thrown is to the health safety of a player’s arm,” Gann said in a news release about the change. “No two innings are the same.” \nThe AHSAA’s current pitching rule – adopted in 1989 and will still be in effect this spring for the 2016 season – limits pitchers to 14 innings in one week and requires rest of three calendar days after pitching seven innings in one day or makes two appearances on consecutive days. \nThe new pitch count rule, adopted today and beginning in 2017, will require a varsity pitcher to rest three calendar days after throwing 76 to 120 pitches in one day. The maximum pitches allowed for a junior varsity pitcher will be 100 and it’s 85 for junior high or middle school players. \n“Our Medical Advisory Board made it clear that limiting the number of pitches thrown is much more important than innings pitched,” AHSAA Executive Director Steve Savarese said in the news release. “We think this rule change is a landmark decision by the Central Board. Health and safety is a chief concern in all our sports, and this is a positive move toward making baseball safer for our student-athletes.” \nIn addition, the Central Board also adopted a change to baseball scheduling. Beginning in 2016, teams in Classes 1A through 6A will be limited to 28 total games and 7A teams will be limited to 32. There is one caveat to this rule, however, which allows any games played during a school system’s spring break will not count toward the 28- or 32-game total.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T23:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T00:38:23.467+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
