The sample was collected during in-competition doping control June 28, 2015.\nPicard, a resident of Laval, Que., admitted the violation and agreed to waive his right to a hearing, entitling him to request a sanction reduction. Both the CCES and World Anti-Doping Agency jointly agreed to a reduced sanction of three years and nine months.\nPicard's suspension will end April 14, 2019.\nReport Error Submit a Tip Refund Refund", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T15:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T20:37:18.578+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
