The 14-7 non-district victory prompted a jubilant outpouring from Lee players following a sack of quarterback Kyle Smith at midfield to end the game. \nThat was a key — Sandalwood (6-1) kept star quarterback Eli Peters on the bench nursing a sore ankle as Smith, a sophomore, made his first start. \n“[Peters] could have played,” Saints coach Adam Geis said. “We wanted to keep him [healthy for district play]. Sometimes you have to lose a battle to win a war.” \nThe Generals had no problem enjoying the battle’s aftermath. Lee (4-2) trailed 7-0 in the second quarter, but scored a touchdown at the end of the first half to pull within a point, then got the go-ahead score on Derrick Jones’ 11-yard pass to Tyrique Thomas with 2:26 remaining. \n“It’s a big win,” Generals coach O.J. Small said. “They’re a great program, and this win says a lot about our kids. I see something special in our kids. We just have to keep working at it.” \nThat was the theme of the night. Lee’s defense worked to prevent Sandalwood from reaching the end zone, surviving drives of 16, 13 and 12 plays that ended with a pair of failed fourth-down attempts and a punt. \nThough Smith hit RZ McCorker on a 43-yard pass play for the game’s first score, the Generals paid more attention to the Saints’ running game and Logan Wright, who entered the contest leading the area with 1,002 rushing yards. \n“We knew they had a second-string quarterback in and they like to run the ball,” Small said. “We knew if we stopped the run, it would put ourselves in a good position. The defense kept us in the game.” \nWright gained 181 yards on 36 carries, but for almost every yard Wright gained, Sandalwood gave one back on a penalty. The Saints were flagged 21 times for 176 yards, including eight personal fouls and 21 yards in penalties on Lee’s last drive. \n“It was ugly,” Geis said. \nThe Generals struggled on offense as well, short-circuited by three turnovers. But Jones led an eight-play drive at the end of the first half, with his 2-yard scoring run set up by a 42-yard pass to Devante Johnson. \n“It seemed like their defense was holding us,” said Jones, who finished with 114 passing yards. “The last drive we scored on before the half, that was a big drive. We thought we could play with them.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T07:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T16:44:39.689+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
