Here are some highlights from Aggies' head coach Kevin Sumlin's time spent with the media on Tuesday.\nImpact of freshmen...\nSumlin: I don't know that they are making...an across the board statement. I think you have certain guys who are very talent and have been able to make that transition. The new rules have really helped college football and helped the student athlete. The fact that we are able to pay for summer school subsequent to the young man entering in the fall. Guys are here and then graduate that next Friday back home but are here already in summer school. That was one big thing that helped from a maturation standpoint.\nThe second big rule change was the ability for coaches to be able to meet with players about football related things for up to two hours per week during the summer time. You've got a young man here that's basically lifting for two four-week periods, June and July, which is a complete offseason in a workout phase. He's here and lifting three-four times a week. In our situation quarterbacks are running seven-on-sevens with defense three nights a week. Meeting with coaches. That will speed up a curve in a hurry. Just like I said for Kyler [Murray] and a bunch of these guys. When we started practice we had been through the instillation twice offensively, the only thing we hadn't done yet was gone out and work with them as coaches\nOn Christian Kirk...\nSumlin: I always envision everyone we recruit doing [what he's done], we would like for everybody we sign to be that way. There are a lot of guys out there making impact like that across the country. I think fortunately we have signed our share of them and we are going to continue to recruit that way. The best players get to play here whether you've been here five years or five days and competition is our best friend.\nThat being said, he is playing well. He caught a break, Speedy has been nicked up a bit and when he gets back he will take a bit off of Christian's plate. What I've found is it's hard for a freshman to play at that level for a complete year. What we've got to do is have other guys step into those roles and fortunately we have guys that can do that. Ricky Seals-Jones has been solid, he hasn't had the numbers other people think he should have but he is playing as well as he's ever played from a physical, blocking, leadership and maturity standpoint.\nJosh Reynolds has gotten going. Obviously in the last couple three weeks what he does is make touchdowns, that's his deal. What we've got to do is bring the other guys along in the intermediate phase, that's where Speedy Noil, Damion Ratley and Jeremy Tabuyo and those guys, Jeremy has had a great spring.. We've got enough weapons that can help him out because he's going to start seeing different things and after about game four or five people figure out he has some real talent and defenses will change.\nSignificance of time of possession...\nSumlin: For what we do, time of possession isn't very relevant at all. Third down conversions are relevant. If you aren't converting, it doesn't matter how long you have the ball. We won the game because we won the turnover margin two to nothing and were efficient on the plays we had. It's hard to walk in and halftime and be frustrated when you only ran 16 plays and you are winning the game.\nIn those situations what you have seen and felt, the 'hey we have to do something...' In actuality that's not the case. The score of the game didn't dictate that, it was a close football game. A lot of times in those situations people panic. They get outside themselves and feel like every possession we have to score. Every possession, you have to at least flip the field or put points on the board and that's how we were able to hang in there in that type of game. Looking back at the game, Arkansas played exactly the game they wanted to play.\nMaturity of your team has to come in. Instead of guys panicking and feeling like they have to score every snap, moving the football and scoring points is still important. Do we have to get better in the red zone? Yes. And that's certainly a point of emphasis for us.\n2014 start compared to this season...\nSumlin: I dont think this year is anything like last year. Maybe the Arkansas game was like that. We were one of the few teams to go eight straight weeks in a row last year.\nI don't draw any similarities to it. I think people are making a mistake trying to say 'let's wait and see' and that's fine. To a certain extent I think there is a little bit to this game. You've got two teams that might be feeling the same way about life. Without going into that I think you understand what I'm getting at.\nThis team we are playing is a really good team, I'm amazed. Spent five or six weeks at number one last year, returned the most experienced QB in the game and they were picked last in our division.\nMississippi State has an experienced QB who wont be intimidated, top tacklers back on defense, and I think they aren't getting the respect they should be getting. YOu've got two very similar teams playing Saturday night, it's going to be a heck of a game.\nKyle Allen...\nSumlin: He's been really good. He's been calm, the look in his eye is good, a lot different than last year this time. When he wasn't playing at all, I think he left the Arkansas game... Quite frankly I think last year when he left that game he was thinking about going somewhere else to play because we had a quarterback who was playing at a high level and had just won a game like that. He's come a long way.\nCan he get better? You bet. There's a lot of things we are working on. Confidence is a big deal. He understands the system better, his ball security was a lot better Saturday. Just little things in the pocket, not turning the ball over, the quarterback has a lot to do with that.\nHe should get better. That's just the progression. of things. I think he understands personnel a lot more, that's what you saw in the fourth quarter.\nOffensive line...\nSumlin: I think we did some good things Saturday. Whenever we get in a situation where we had to drop back, that created some issues for us. I thought we were able to handle that schematically, I thought we did a great job on screens. Game plan wise, from where we started, our biggest issues were penalties.\nWe had long fields, third down situations I thought we handled schematically as coaches better.\nMississippi State QB Dak Prescott...\nSumlin: He's patient, he will hop and look and you just hope he doesn't come out of the pocket because he's a tough guy to tackle. He's strong and he's a leader. I think the biggest compliment you can give a guy is 'Would you want this guy on your team?' Just a class act when you go to media days, a great guy to be around, confident on the field and the team feeds off that. He's not going to be intimidated and he' s a good player.\nHe's a guy everything will run through offensively. They have excellent skill on the outside to compliment their big receivers. Schematically they do a great job, Dan Mullen has always been that kind of guy that is going to give his players the opportunity to be successful, he's done that all the way back to Tebow.\nKyler Murray...\nSumlin: I was hoping [putting him in the game] would catch Arkansas off balance and it looks like it did. The ability to put him in and do some things is advantageous to us and the ability to be in that environment is advantageous to him. As he gets more comfortable there's more things he can do than just running on and off the field. He cost Arkansas a time out at one point.\nHe helps us out duing the game but also creates a preparation situation for the other team. As he continues to grow he will get more opportunities and he will be able to handle more of the whole package.\nKevin Sumlin provided no injury update on James White or Otaro Alaka.\nView the entire Sumlin press conference video here .
