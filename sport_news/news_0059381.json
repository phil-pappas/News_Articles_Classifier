Daniel Gallen Contact Reporter Maryland looking forward to opportunity to play Penn State at M&T Bank Stadium. \nWhen Maryland beat West Virginia, 37-0, the last time it played a game at M&T Bank Stadium in 2013, middle linebacker Jermaine Carter Jr. was suited up in the team’s brand-new Maryland Pride 2.0 uniforms, but he was relegated to the sideline while redshirting. \nSo this Saturday, Carter will get his chance to play in an NFL stadium for the Terps when they take on Penn State. But it won’t be his first time playing at M&T Bank Stadium. \nWhen Carter was in eighth grade, his Upper Marlboro Mustangs team played its league championship game at the Ravens’ stadium, an eye-opening experience for a young player, even if the crowd was much, much smaller than what will fill the purple seats this weekend. \n“It was probably about 1,000. It wasn’t that many. It was probably just our parents honestly,” Carter said with a laugh Wednesday. “Probably about 25 to 30 people. It wasn't many. But it's something I’ll never forget.” \nPenn State and Maryland players are relishing the opportunity to play on a bigger stage in Baltimore, in front of the familiar faces of friends and family. \n“It's exciting,” right guard Andrew Zeller said. “It's going to be an electric atmosphere. If you've ever been to M&T Bank Stadium for a Ravens game or even the last time we played West Virginia, it's an exciting place to play. So they're going to fit a lot more fans in the stadium than Byrd Stadium can and the guys are excited to play in an NFL stadium, as they would any other time.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T22:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T03:06:05.129+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
