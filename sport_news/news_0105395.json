The wreck was reported at 6:30 p.m. on Highway 120 and Smith Station Road, California Highway Patrol Officer Nick Norton said. A 2012 Mercedes registered out of San Jose and a 2012 Nissan registered out of Merced collided head-on, Norton said, adding that it is not clear which vehicle crossed into the opposing lane. “At that point there was a fire with the vehicles,” he said. “It also caught the hillside on fire — they were able to get that extinguished pretty quickly.” Five people were declared dead on scene and two others were flown to a hospital in Modesto. “We haven’t seen a collision like this in quite some time,” Norton said. Responders are still working to clear the scene. Traffic is being rerouted to Ferretti Road. Contact Tori Thomas at or 588-4526. Follow her on Twitter @ToriThomasUD.
