McCarthy and Bella’s mother, Rachelle Bond, 40 — who faces an accessory charge — both briefly appeared in Dorchester District Court today where Judge Lisa Ann Grant agreed to allow the defense to conduct their own autopsy on Bella. Prosecutors did not object to the defense motion.\nShapiro noted that the medical examiner’s office hasn’t determined a cause and manner of death for the little girl found discarded in a trash bag on the Boston Harbor June 25 by a dog walker.\nBond’s lawyer, Janice Bassil, said her client didn’t want a second autopsy because it’s really hard for her but it was necessary to assess her statements to investigators and whether her statements are corroborated by medical evidence.\n“I wanted my own person to give me a second opinion,” Bassil said.\nBoth Bassil and Shapiro said they will have different experts conduct the autopsy, but Shapiro said he hopes they reach same conclusion.\nIn court, Bond bowed her head and was huddled in corner behind a glass partition while McCarthy stood several feet behind her looking on expressionless.\nThe pair, who were arrested last month and have pleaded not guilty, are due back in court Nov. 19 for a probable cause hearing. Bond remains held on $1 million bail, while there is no bail for McCarthy.\nMcCarthy’s father and brother left court without commenting.\nJoseph Amoroso, Bella’s biological father, said after the hearing that he’s “disgusted” to see his ex-girlfriend Bond in court.\n“I hope they find more evidence and more cause,” Amoroso said. “This is all about justice for Bella from here on out.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T18:43:32.121+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
