It was strong enough to win the boys’ cross country race by 17 seconds over teammate Alex Sennott. Sarah Christopher also cruised along without a serious challenge on a day that might have been nearly perfect for those who took to the 3.1-mile course in the wilderness. Despite the efforts of Durham and Sennott, Pontiac lost the boys’ portion of the meet by one point to Rantoul. The Eagles finished at 37 while the Tribe chalked up 38 points. Prairie Central was third at 66 and Tri-Point competed with four runners. Durham won the race in 18 minutes, 34.1 seconds. Sennott was next with a second-place time of 18:51.8, edging Rantoul’s Elijah Hall by three seconds. Tyler Lind, a senior who was recognized before the meet, along with the seniors from each team participating, was third for PTHS at 20:02.8, which was good for eighth overall. Frank Smith was 10th at 20:06.3 and Ryan Cupples completed the scoring with a 17th-place time of 21:38.1. Also running for the Indians were Geno Borrego (21:55.5), Billy Burns (22:53.4), Ryan Lauritsen (23:21.8) and Kevin Turner (25:36.1). Dawson Toller led the Prairie Central contingent with a seventh-place time of 19:59.2. Aidan Krieger came in two spots later at 20:03.3 with Jordan Zapp placing 12th at 20:12.3. Tyler Porter hit the chute at 21:35 for 16th place and Jeremiah Dunahee placed 22nd at 22:35.7. Also running for the Hawks were Andrien Ruiz (22:45), Luke Evans (23:22.1), Lukas Ashman (23:23.4), Seth Reed (25:43.9) and James Connors (35:17.5). David Amador led Tri-Point with a sixth-place time of 19:38.4. Jacob Ritchie was 13th at 20:13.9. Josh Gonzalez came through at 21:47.6 for 18th place and Nathan Berens was 21st at 22:21.8. Christopher had a bigger margin of victory in her seemingly confident run of 22:11.7 to win the girls’ race. Hope Russell of Rantoul was second at 22:38.5 and Prairie Central’s Megan Ifft placed third at 22:58.2. Completing the top five were two Tri-Point harriers as Ali Flessner edged teammate Abby Kerrins 23:11.9 to 23:12.5. Placing an immediate sixth was Pontiac’s Jaycey Crisostomo at 23:13.2. Alli Hodgson was seventh overall and third for PTHS at 23:54.2. Daphne Matson was second for PC and ninth overall with time of 24:16.6, edging teammates Abbie Bazzell, who was 10th at 24:19.5, and 11th-place finisher Emma Fogarty (24:20). Vivian Walter was the final scorer for the Hawks with a 13th-place time of 27:14.1. Also running for PC was Summer Huber (27:14.5). Anna Murphy was 12th overall and third for the Chargers at 24:25.4. Anicah Bruner came in 15th with a time of 27:42 for The Point.
