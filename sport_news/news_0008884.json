The Cubs swept the season series from the Mets, winning all seven games.\nAs Cubs manager Joe Maddon stood on the field, celebrating the magical moment, he commented on a possible meeting with the Mets. Mets manager Terry Collins had Maddon as one of his coaches while managing the Angels.\n“It would be incredible to be in the NLCS with Terry,’’ Maddon told The Post as players celebrated all around him. “I also have a vested interest with Andrew [Friedman, Dodgers president]. Whatever happens, happens, but Terry permitted me to stay in the big leagues by hiring me as his bench coach. He could have easily not have done that.\n“I don’t know if I’d be standing here right now, so I do owe a lot to TC regarding keeping me employed at that particular juncture of my career.\n“It’s incredible the velocity in major league baseball. It’s just crazy to watch — both starters and out of the bullpen. You have to play a complete game in order to win.’’\nThe Cubs played a complete game and a complete series to beat the 100-win Cardinals. They blew through the NL Central monsters, blanking the Pirates in the wild card then taking care of a gritty Cardinal team.\nCubs fans celebrate after the clincher.

In the second, backup shortstop Javier Baez had blasted a three-run home run.\nIn the two games at Wrigley, the young Cubs blasted nine home runs.\nThis has all happened the way team president Theo Epstein and his staff drew it up — but much faster than anyone anticipated.\nEpstein said he is not about to hang any labels on this team.\n“The only thing we want to hang on us is a pennant and let everybody else write about it,’’ said the former Red Sox general manager who broke the Curse of the Bambino in 2004 and now is trying to get the Cubs to win their first World Series since 1908.\nFinally, the “W’’ flag is flying at the Friendly Confines.\nWrigley was built in 1914. To let riders on the elevated train that rattles past the ballpark know whether the Cubs had won or lost that day, a “W’’ or an “L’’ was raised on the flagpole.\nThe Cubs have been stuck in their own losing time warp since 1908.\n“Nothing is promised in baseball or in life,’’ Epstein said. “We’re excited about all the tomorrows but we have to go earn it and the only thing we’re promised is a game Saturday in L.A. or New York. We’re looking forward to that, two great teams, great organizations. Celebrate tonight go back and pop a cold one, sit on the couch and advance scout a little bit.’’\nParty on, Cubs.\nLeft-hander Jon Lester put the Cubs’ mission in perspective. When a TV reporter breathlessly asked: “Is this why you came to the Cubs?’’ his answer was direct. “No,’’ Lester said. “I came here to win a World Series. This is just the start.’’\nA win over the Dodgers on Thursday, and the Mets and Cubs will be one blast of an NLCS.\n chicago cubs , joe maddon , mlb playoffs , st. louis cardinals , theo epstein", "external_links": ["https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/cubs-4.jpg", "https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/cubs-4.jpg?w=300&#038;h=200"], "published": "2015-10-14T07:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T03:18:48.851+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
