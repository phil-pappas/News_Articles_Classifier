I guess I kind of learned from that. I played a few years of pro in Sweden, too, so I've played in front of crowds. But of course, you don't know what to expect. When you get a start like that, it's easy to shake those nerves off and I think you play better when you get a start like that.\"\nOn Twitter:\n @MikeHeika", "external_links": ["http://video.nhl.com/videocenter/embed?playlist=842222&site=stars", "https://twitter.com/MikeHeika"], "published": "2015-10-11T05:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T11:11:49.112+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
