By Liam Apicella , Features EditorFiled:   10:01 UK Last Updated:   10:04 UK \nGreat Britain's Johanna Konta was defeated 6-3 7-5 in the second round of the Generali Ladies Linz by Madison Brengle yesterday afternoon. \nWorld number 47 Konta had eased beyond Germany's Annika Beck in the previous round, but as soon as she was broken in the fourth game of the first set, the Brit was always playing catch up. \nBrengle, who is ranked five places above Konta, went on to make the most of that break to open up a one-set lead. \nNeither player was able to hold their serves during the opening four games of the second set, but once the USA's Brengle struck again to take a 3-2 lead, she eventually ended up winning the encounter in 92 minutes.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T12:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T12:10:17.978+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
