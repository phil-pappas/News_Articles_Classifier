Tompkins \nVista Grande defenders Jay Scott, 44, Jesus Velasco, 57, and Adrian Leos tackle Flagstaff ball carrier C.J. Tompkins during Friday night’s game. The Spartans defeated the Eagles 36-7 to improve their season record to 5-1. Posted: Tuesday, October 6, 2015 10:52 am | Updated: 11:07 am, Tue Oct 6, 2015. Grande Gridiron Report 10/6/15 \nVista Grande \nThe first two touchdown drives for the No. 12 Spartans in Friday night’s 36-7 Division III nonsection victory over No. 18 Flagstaff covered 39 yards in nine plays and 43 yards in eight plays. \nThen came the quick-strike TDs — a 75-yard punt return by Luis Palacios, a 47-yard pass from Sam Barragon to Daniel Padilla and Barragon’s 91-yard pass to Nik Halter. \nVista Grande (5-1) has scored 18 touchdowns this season, eight on plays of 30-plus yards — three on passes, three on runs, one on a kickoff return and one on a punt return. \nBarragon, a sophomore, was unflappable in his second varsity start. He completed 8 of 12 passes for 238 yards with three TDs and no interceptions. \n“He did a good job of taking what the defense gave him,” Vista Grande coach Tracy Stuart said. “He hit the open receivers and managed the game very well.” \nBarragon’s second pass of the game was a 15-yard TD to Brenden Ethington that capped the Spartans’ initial possession. It came on second and 13 after the Spartans converted on third and 3 and fourth and 5. That drive set the tone and filled them with confidence. \n“We needed to get that quick start,” Stuart said. “It definitely swung the momentum our way.” \nVista Grande ran for 137 yards, getting 62 from Alec Meza and 58 from Palacios, and finished with a season-best 375 total yards. The point total also was a season high. \n“The offense is improving every week, both the run game and the pass game,” Stuart said. \nThe Spartans had 338 total yards in the previous week’s 20-14 win over Seton, and their season average has climbed to 291 (171 rushing, 120 passing). \n-- DEFENSE: Vista Grande was not the least bit confused by Flagstaff’s unique hurry-up approach. The receivers would spread wide as the rest of the players formed a loose huddle. After the Eagles hustled to the line of scrimmage, the ball was immediately snapped. \n“The kids were relaxed because they paid attention and knew what was coming,” Stuart said. “We practiced against it all week, and our (defensive coaching) staff did a great job of having them ready.” \nFlagstaff (3-3) had seven runs of 10 yards or more that accounted for 153 of its 223 rushing total, but averaged just 1.8 yards on its other 44 attempts. \n“We knew they would get theirs, but to shut them down the way we did was fantastic,” Stuart said. \nThe Eagles posed no threat with the pass, going 2 of 12 for 11 yards with one interception. \nThe Spartans allowed 14 or fewer points for the fifth time in six games. Flagstaff punted on six of its 11 possessions, had two turnovers and was stopped once on fourth down. \n-- SPECIAL TEAMS: Palacios set up Vista Grande’s first TD with a 29-yard punt return and another touchdown with a 52-yard kickoff return to the Flagstaff 44 to begin the second half. He finished with 213 all-purpose yards. “There were some fantastic blocks on the returns,” Stuart said. … Linemen scored both of the Spartans’ two-point conversions — Skylar Collins on a pass from Palacios, who also had a 4-yard TD run, and Alex Soto on a run. … Art Ruiz was 2 for 2 on extra-point kicks and is 10 for 11 on the season. … Halter averaged 38.0 yards on four punts, with a long of 43 that was downed at the Flagstaff 1. \nCasa Grande Union \nThe defense stepped up for the No. 18 Cougars in their Division IV/Section 5 opener, forcing five turnovers while holding Fountain Hills to an average of 2.8 yards per play in Friday night’s 35-0 road victory. \nSomewhat overshadowed by CG Union’s prolific point-a-minute offense, it was another stellar performance by a crew that is allowing just 10.7 points and 181 total yards per game. \n“We’ve always been pretty good athletically, and now we’re getting smarter each week,” CG Union coach Jake Barro said. “We’re recognizing what opponents are doing, which makes us faster to the football, and we’ve got kids who like to hit.” \nArmando Pinon returned one of his two interceptions for a 63-yard touchdown. Koby Charles and Angel Campos also had interceptions, and Garrett Thomas recovered a fumble as the Cougars improved to 5-1 overall with their fifth consecutive victory. Thomas had two of CG Union’s five tackles for loss. \nFountain Hills (1-5, 0-1 section) had 94 yards rushing on 39 attempts (2.4 average) and completed just 8 of 23 passes for 81 yards. The deepest penetration for the Falcons was CG Union’s 26-yard line. \n“We gave up some yards, but they didn’t score,” Barro said. \nNo opponent has registered more than 14 points against the Cougars since the season opener, when Vista Grande did all of its scoring in the first half en route to a 23-12 win. CG Union has kept every opponent under 300 total yards, with two netting less than 100. \n-- OFFENSE: After passing for at least 244 yards in its first five games, CG Union was held to 71 by the Falcons. \n“There’s no question we had trouble throwing the ball,” Barro said. Fountain Hills “put pressure on our quarterback and had good coverage in the secondary.” \nThe Falcons utilized six defensive backs to “take away the deep threat,” Barro said. The Cougars did not throw a pass in the first quarter and completed just 8 of 21 attempts. \nWith just five in the box, Fountain Hills was vulnerable to the run. Going mainly with quick-hitters inside, CG Union gained 204 yards on the ground with an average of 5.1 per carry. \nTrenton Diaz had 117 yards and a touchdown on 16 attempts, and Hunter Bechtel had 64 yards on seven carries. \nAfter Fountain Hills adjusted by putting more players in the box, “we threw quick passes to the edge,” Barros said. \nQuarterback Brock Hall threw TD passes of 14 yards to Cameron Gardner and 8 yards to Trevor Russell to raise his season total to 19. Hall also ran for a touchdown. \nThe turnovers “gave us great field position,” Barro said, so being limited to 275 total yards “didn’t matter much.” \nBeing turnover-free for the second time this season also helped. \n-- SPECIAL TEAMS: Jacob Auza was 5 for 5 on extra-point kicks and is 26 for 28 on the season. … Hall averaged 45.0 yards on four punts.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T20:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T14:48:39.601+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
