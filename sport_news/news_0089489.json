He has only one other interception in 18 games since, that coming early in an eventual blowout loss to the Denver Broncos last season. \nToo often, Hayden's been mentioned for his struggles. In just 10 games last season, he was beaten for six touchdowns and quarterbacks had a 121.6 passer rating throwing his way, according to Pro Football Focus. He's already allowed three touchdowns and a 119.3 rating in five games this season. Oakland Raiders' D.J. Hayden (25) and Oakland Raiders' Nate Allen (20) react to a call against Hayden during their game against the Arizona Cardinals in the second quarter of their NFL preseason game at O.co Coliseum in Oakland, Calif, on Sunday, Aug. 30, 2015. The call was overturned. (Nhat V. Meyer/Bay Area News Group) ( Nhat V. Meyer ) \nStill, Hayden feels like he and the Raiders defense are growing and improving. \n\"We're just overall getting better and better each week,\" Hayden said. \"Whether it's tackling, attacking the ball in the air ... we're getting better.\" \nDefensive coordinator Ken Norton Jr. says he's seeing improvement from Hayden. \n\"Early on, you saw balls get thrown deep on him,\" Norton said. \"Now, you see those deep balls, the number of times are getting smaller. He's making plays. He's covering people. His coverage is a lot tighter.\" \nThat's not to say Hayden has fully turned any corners. He's allowed a reception of 20-plus yards in all but one game, and in the 16-7 loss to the Broncos that preceded the bye, he was beaten deep when he bit on a double move by Emmanuel Sanders and saw him scoot by for a 45-yard gain. But on the seven other times he was targeted, Denver receivers made just four catches for 33 yards. Advertisement \nThat Broncos game marked the first time all season he wasn't credited with any missed tackles and, as a team, that's an area that has improved. After having 31 missed tackles the first two games -- during which they allowed a total of 70 points -- they've missed only 22 tackles the past three while allowing an average of 19.3 points. \nHayden's starting spot figures to be tenuous in a few weeks if Nate Allen returns from his knee injury. Allen, on the short-term injured reserve, could begin practicing in two weeks and is eligible to return Nov. 15 against Minnesota. \nThat would allow TJ Carrie to slide back to cornerback, where David Amerson seems in good shape to maintain a starting spot. Hayden could be relegated to a spot in the Raiders' nickel defense. \nSome of Norton's complimentary comments about Hayden may have to do with a continued effort to instill confidence in the third-year player, who was drafted No. 12 overall by Reggie McKenzie in the 2013 draft. \n\"For young players, confidence is really important,\" Norton said while discussing Hayden. \"You really have to find a lot of the positive things they are doing and really build their confidence. His repetitions are high, his skill is getting really good. He's really growing into one of the better corners in the league.\" \nThat might be going a step too far with the praise, but the Raiders could sure use another outing like that rookie performance against San Diego. That stands statistically as his best outing as a pro. He was targeted five times and allowed just one catch for 16 yards, giving Rivers just a 0.2 rating going his way -- by far the best game of Hayden's career.
