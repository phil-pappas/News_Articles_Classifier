The backfield duo combined for 284 rushing yards and all three touchdowns in the Vikings’ 21-0 victory over Abington at Memorial Field. “You’re not going to find a two-headed monster like that in too many other places,” East Bridgewater coach Shawn Tarpey said. “They’re both special kids, seniors, they work their butts off.” Despite missing their starting quarterback, senior Ryan Graham, for the second straight game, the Vikings (4-0, 2-0 South Shore League Large) didn’t miss a beat, thanks to Vargus (21 carries, 183 yards, TD) and Peterson (18-101, two TDs). “It speaks to the overall talent I think we have,” Tarpey said. “It’s not just those two guys, it’s the guys up front doing their part.” Abington, the defending Division 5 state champ, opened the game with its best drive of the night, but it was thwarted at the Vikings’ 36, when the Green Wave (3-1, 1-1) could not convert on fourth down. “You certainly don’t want to give up an opening touchdown to a team like Abington,” Tarpey said. “So, yeah, it was huge.” The Vikings responded with a six-play, 64-yard drive of their own, capped by Vargus scoring on an 18-yard run for a 7-0 lead with 4:56 to play in the first quarter. Vargus was quick to praise his offensive line following a monster performance. “They crushed it,” Vargus said. “They definitely came out today with a purpose and helped us run well.” That was all the room the Vikings would need as their defense was able to stifle the normally potent Abington offense. “We weren’t clicking the way we’d like to be clicking,” Abington coach Jim Kelliher said. “We have to get back to the drawing board and get back to playing the kind of football that we’re usually known to play.” Defensively, Vargus added three pass breakups and two tackles for loss. Senior linebacker Nick Bainter also had a great game defensively, including stuffing the middle on fourth down on the Abington opening drive. The Vikings added a score right before half, when Peterson hurdled his way into the end zone from 4 yards out. Despite being held to only 72 yards of total offense in the first half, the Green Wave still were in the game at halftime, down 14-0. As the rain started to fall more steadily in the second half, Abington force a pair of Vargus fumbles, with recoveries from seniors Brendan Glavin and Dave Lyons (two tackles for loss). But the Green Wave were unable to capitalize offensively. Page 2 of 2 - “We were able to slow them down a bit (in the second half),” Kelliher said. “We were able to play our game like we can play, but at the same time, offensively it wasn’t there.” Abington senior running back Shawn Donovan (12 carries, 41 yards) was unable to get anything going against the defensive line of seniors Eric Marchant and Mike Chaupetta, with his longest rush coming off a fake punt in the second quarter for 18 yards. “(Marchant and Chaupetta) made sure that they did their job,” Tarpey said. “When they do their job, they’re so big and strong, that they can have a pretty big impact.” Peterson added the last score on a 20-yard scamper with 3:25 left in the game. This might not be the last time these two teams face off, as both are favored to return to the Div. 5 South Sectional playoffs. Last year, EB beat Abington, 28-16, in the regular season to claim the SSL Large crown, but the Green Wave prevailed, 38-20, in the sectional final rematch. “They’re such a good program,” Tarpey said of Abington. “They play so hard and if we see them again, they’re going to have a lot of answers and it’s going to be a battle.” David Konowitch", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T07:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T07:08:31.594+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
