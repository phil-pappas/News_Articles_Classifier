Lawrence was by far the fastest team we have seen. Their style of playing was lots of large drives, followed by lots of sprinting. We did a great job the first half of keeping up, but our defensive positioning hurt us.” \nWhile Clement said her team still needs to “iron out the wrinkles” defensively, she was pleased that her squad held the Bulldogs scoreless over the final 22 minutes. She also credited the work of Frances Pendleton, who “stopped a few shots that would have been goals otherwise.” \n“We have a lot of tough games coming up, so we have our work cut out for us,” the coach said. \nLawrence held a 12-9 lead in shots and and a 6-3 edge in penalty corners. Jenna Stearns made seven saves in the cage for the Windjammers, while Emily Tozier made seven saves in goal for the Bulldogs. \nThe Bulldogs advanced to the Eastern Class A championship game last year, but fell to Skowhegan. \nCamden Hills 9, Lincoln Academy 0 \nAt Newcastle Sept. 26, the Windjammer offense scored in droves en route to a lopsided win. \nLeading the offense were Molly Davee (goal, assist), Emily Daggett (2 goals, 2 assists), Hilary Merrifield (3 goals, assist), Frances Pendleton (goal), Emily Bowen (goal, assist), Sadie Mills (goal, assist), Caroline Keefe (assist), Amy Cummings (assist) and Halsey Yattaw (assist). \nCamden Hills held a 21-0 advantage in shots and a 13-2 edge in penalty corners. Jenna Stearns played in the cage for the Windjammers, while Zoew Sewall made 12 saves for the Eagles. \nIn the Maine Principals' Association Heal Point Standings for Class B North, Camden Hills (6-5, 24.8980 points) is eighth, while Winslow (7-2-1, 85.6378 points) is first in the 14-team region. The top 10 teams qualify for the playoffs. \nCourier Publications' sports staff can be reached by email at sports@villagesoup.com or by phone at 594-4401.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T17:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T19:36:23.873+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
