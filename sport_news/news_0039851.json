By Jeff Deters jeff.deters@cjonline.com \nKANSAS CITY, Mo. — A year ago, the Kansas City Royals were just happy to be in the postseason. Now they won’t be happy unless they win it all. \nThe Royals are the only team in the American League that is returning to the postseason from last year, and they do so in much better shape, having cruised to a division title and securing home-field advantage throughout the playoffs. \nArmed with invaluable experience from last year’s postseason, the Royals will take on the Houston Astros in the American League Division Series. The team also seems intent on taking care of some unfinished business, so here are five reasons the Royals have what it takes to beat the Astros. \n1. EXPERIENCE \nThe Royals experienced every emotion possible during last year’s postseason run, and they proved during the regular season that they are better for having gone through that experience. With the exception of Alex Rios, every player in KC’s starting lineup has played in the postseason. This also is manager Ned Yost’s 13th trip to the postseason as a coach or manager. Yost has a World Series ring — having won one when he was a coach with the Braves in 1995 —and could well be in position to get another in a few weeks. \n2. THE BULLPEN \nThe Royals will miss Greg Holland, but they are stocked with enough power arms to overcome that loss. Wade Davis has arguably been the best reliever in baseball the past two years and he will take the ball in the ninth. Still, Yost has right-handers Ryan Madson and Kelvin Herrera to rely on in the seventh and eighth innings and left-hander Danny Duffy has been nearly flawless since moving to the bullpen a few weeks ago. \n3. THE ROTATION \nSurprised? Maybe you shouldn’t be. The Royals received a string of solid starts from their rotation to close out the regular season, led by Yordano Ventura. \nAnother positive sign is that Johnny Cueto posted three quality starts in his last four outings and Edinson Volquez has remained steady. Chris Young also has pitched brilliantly in his two starts since returning to the rotation, and Kris Medlen has had his moments. \n4. HOME FIELD \nThe electricity of last October is bound to return, and may be even better this postseason. The Royals protected their home park well during the regular season, going 51-30 at home, whereas the Astros went a league-worst 33-48 on the road. \n5. DEEP LINEUP \nThe Royals feature a balanced attack offensively that has Alex Gordon, arguably the team’s best player when healthy, hitting eighth. The Royals went from ninth in the AL last year in runs scored to sixth this year and their power numbers are up as well. \nAfter hitting just 95 home runs last year, the Royals hit 139 this season. Kendrys Morales, Mike Moustakas and Salvador Perez all hit 20 or more home runs and Eric Hosmer hit 18. The Royals also will play at least one game at Minute Maid Park, where it’s only 315 feet to the wall in left field. \nJeff Deters can be reached at jeff.deters@cjonline.com .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-07T18:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T02:35:11.681+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
