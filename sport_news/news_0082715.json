Stewart will be 45 next season, hasn't won a race in more than two years and has been privately working on finding a successor for the No. 14 Chevrolet all year.\n\"There wasn't any pressure from anybody,\" Stewart said of his decision. \"If anything, it was the opposite. I know people were trying to talk me out of it. It's a scenario where everybody in their career makes the decision that it's time for a change.\"\nStewart, who deeply loves dirt-track racing, isn't getting out of the car for good, though.\n\"I am still going to race,\" he said. \"I am not retiring from racing, just the Sprint Cup Series.\"\nClint Bowyer, released from his contract with Michael Waltrip Racing because the team is folding at the end of the season, will replace Stewart in the No. 14 in 2017. Bowyer has been looking for a one-year deal for next season as a stopgap while Stewart runs his 18th and final Cup season. SHR also fields cars for reigning series champion Kevin Harvick, Kurt Busch and Danica Patrick.\nThe last three years have been trying for Stewart. He struck and killed sprint-car driver Kevin Ward Jr. during a 2014 event in New York. He also missed the final third of the 2013 season with a broken leg suffered in a sprint car crash. His passion for NASCAR racing also has waned in the last several seasons, in part because of an evolving rules package that he has struggled with.\nStewart told AP in June that his confidence was shot and he was struggling to find any enjoyment in being in the race car.\nStewart said the fatal incident with Ward and his comeback from injuries played no role in his decision.\nNot much has worked for Stewart this season. He's mired in 25th in the points standings and failed to qualify for the Chase for the Sprint Cup championship for the third consecutive year.\nStewart, who moved from IndyCar to NASCAR and got his break in 1999 with Joe Gibbs Racing, is the second star in two years to call it quits. Four-time champion Jeff Gordon will retire at the end of this season.\nStewart has 48 Cup victories and is a lock for NASCAR's Hall of Fame. He's one of the most proficient drivers in racing, winning in every kind of series, from sprint cars to a dominant stretch in NASCAR in which he reeled off at least one win in 15 straight seasons.\nBut the last two seasons have been filled with heartache and hardship on and off the track for Stewart. While no one would count out Stewart from winning one more race, he's no longer a regular threat to find victory lane. He last won a Cup race June 2, 2013.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T04:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T08:43:38.098+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
