While they are 4-3 in this round, virtually every series has been wildly entertaining:\n1969 Mets defeat Braves in 3 \nThe Mets calling card — their pitching — struggles in this series, but the offense certainly doesn’t, scoring nine runs per game. A five-run eighth leads to a 9-5 victory in Game 1, Tommie Agree, Cleon Jones and Ken Boswell homer in Game 2’s 11-6 win and the Mets pound out 14 hits in Game 3 to win 7-4 and reach the World Series for the first time.\n1973 Mets beat Reds in 5 \nThe Mets’ big arms dominate the series, allowing no more than two runs in any one game. After the Mets drop the opener, Jon Matlack throws a two-hit shutout in Game 2, Jerry Koosman dominates Game 3, though a brawl is the real story when Pete Rose slides hard into second base to break up a double play, and gets into a fight with Bud Harrelson.\nThe Reds win Game 4, 2-1 in 12 innings, but Tom Seaver pitches the Mets to the pennant in Game 5, rebounding from his Game 1 loss, in a 7-2 victory.\n1986 Jesse Orosco celebrates the Mets’ win in Game 6 of the 1986 NLCS. Photo: Getty Images Mets beat the Astros in 6 \nOne of the classic postseason series in LCS history, the Astros ride the right arm of ace Mike Scott to comfortable victories in Game 1 and Game 4, while the Mets steal Game 3 on the strength of Lenny Dykstra’s two-run walk-off homer off closer Dave Smith. The Mets take Game 5 in a 12-inning affair, prevailing on Gary Carter’s RBI single, setting up a mammoth Game 6.\nDown 3-0 entering the ninth, the Mets rally to pull even. The teams trade single runs in the 14th and the Mets finally win it 7-6 in the 16th, scoring three times.\n1988 Mets lose to the Dodgers in 7 \nFormer Mets still have nightmares about this series, as the one that got away. They were heavily favored, after taking 10 of 11 games against the Dodgers in the regular season and winning 100 games during the year, and they held series leads of 1-0 and 2-1.\nBut Mike Scioscia’s two-run, game-tying homer in the ninth inning of Game 4 against Doc Gooden flips the momentum, and the Dodgers win Game 7 6-0 behind a dominant Orel Hershiser.\n1999 Mets lose to the Braves in 6 \nJohn Rocker and the Braves defeated the Mets in the 1999 NLCS. Photo: AFP An emotional NLDS series victory over the Diamondbacks doesn’t carry over for the Mets, who drop the first three games of the NLCS by a combined four runs to their NL East tormenters. But the NL wild-card winners refuse to enter the offseason quietly. Four outs from elimination in Game 4, John Olerud’s two-run single keeps the Mets alive. And in a classic Game 5, Robin Ventura’s 15th-inning “Grand Slam Single” sends the series back to Atlanta.\nGame 6 is a gut-wrenching classic. The Braves race out to a 5-0 lead, but the Mets respond again, scoring seven runs in the sixth and seventh innings with the big blow a Mike Piazza two-run homer off John Smoltz to pull the Mets even at 7. But the Mets can’t hold single-run leads in the eighth and 10th, and the Braves win 10-9 in the 11th when Kenny Rogers walks Andruw Jones with the bases loaded.\n2000 Mets beat the Cardinals in 5 \nThe wild-card Mets’ offense steamrolls the Cardinals pitching in this series, averaging a shade over six runs per game, and they cruise to their first World Series berth in 14 years.\n2006 Mets lose to Cardinals in 7 \nMets fans still get the shakes thinking of that Adam Wainwright curveball that froze Carlos Beltran, ending a memorable season in despair. The Mets were the heavy favorites, winning 97 games during the regular season and cruising to the NL East crown.\nThe series goes seven, and the Mets seem to be a team of destiny when left fielder Endy Chavez robs Scott Rolen of a two-run homer in the sixth. But Yadier Molina takes reliever Aaron Heilman deep in the top of the ninth, and Wainwright strikes out Beltran looking with the bases loaded to close out a 3-1 Cardinals win.\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google Whatsapp Email Filed under mlb playoffs ,  new york mets ,  nlcs", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T03:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T09:19:04.812+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
