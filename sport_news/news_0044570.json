(AP Photo/Paul Sancya) more > By NOAH TRISTER   \nALLEN PARK, Mich. (AP) - Golden Tate was ready when reporters approached him at his locker. \nThe Detroit receiver made some pointed comments about the home crowd after the Lions were routed by Arizona on Sunday amid quite a bit of booing. \nA day later, Tate tried to mend some fences with Detroit’s frustrated fans. \n“I understand where our fan base is coming from as far as their patience with this organization,” Tate said. “They’ve been waiting for a long time, and I’ve been here for one and a half years. That’s one thing, I will step back and put that in perspective. I do understand. I still appreciate the heck out of our fans and still love our fans to death and wouldn’t choose anybody over us. We’re going to get this together.” \nThe Lions were in disarray during their 42-17 loss Sunday. Fans booed, and they headed for the exits early. Quarterback Matthew Stafford was benched in the third quarter. \nIt was hard to believe this was the same team that went 11-5 during the regular season in 2014 and reached the playoffs, but this five-game losing streak to start this season has wiped out just about all of the optimism the Lions had created. \nCoach Jim Caldwell says Stafford is still the starting quarterback for the next game against Chicago. The loss to Arizona was a huge step back after the Lions nearly upset Seattle in their previous game. Detroit turned the ball over six times against the Cardinals in a listless performance. \n“Typically our guys will fight and scratch and dig and those kinds of things, but oftentimes what happens to you, things get tough,” Caldwell said. “Some things go bad, particularly in sequence, and you’ve got to be able to fight through it. We didn’t fight through it very well yesterday.” \nTate took responsibility for his own effort, saying it needs to be better. \n“I’ve got to find that fire that I had last year and that I’ve shown early this season,” he said. “I didn’t have that yesterday for some reason.” \nCaldwell said he’s spoken with team owner Martha Ford, although he didn’t say when. He said the Ford family is “not happy, obviously.” \n“They were certainly as upset about this game as anybody, like they have been about the entire season,” Caldwell said. “So it’s our job to get that turned around.” \nThe Lions are the only team to go 0-16 in a season, and although there would seem to be too much talent on this team for that to happen again, the winless 2008 campaign serves as a reminder of how quickly things can go downhill. Detroit was actually 6-2 at one point in 2007. \nNow it’s fair to wonder if another rebuilding process awaits. Stafford is in his seventh season, and his trend is not encouraging. Since throwing for 5,038 yards in 2011, he’s passed for progressively fewer yards in each season since. \nLast year, he was expected to take a step forward in Caldwell’s first season as Detroit’s coach, but instead it was the defense that lifted the Lions to the playoffs.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T02:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T03:14:08.288+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
