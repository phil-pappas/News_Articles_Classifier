Anyone who works in the city or who visits to shop, eat or enjoy its many cultural and entertainment offerings has a stake in the election’s outcomes.\nSavannah remains the straw that stirs the drink economically, culturally and socially in southeast Georgia.\nBecause the stakes are significant, this newspaper has devoted time and resources to educating readers and familiarizing them with candidates for the mayor’s race and all of the eight aldermanic seats.\nAfter a process that has included individual meetings with candidates, attending political forums and referring to written answers to questionnaires, we will offer our recommendations in each race.\nTo help take the measure of the candidates – who all deserve credit for sacrificing their time and energy to give Savannah’s voters a choice – we weighed the responses of each of them to a list of priorities that include:\n• Improving public safety.\n• Raising the competency level of city staff and strengthening administrative leadership.\n• Developing a long-range strategic plan to guide decision making.\nPublic safety\nPeople no longer feel safe on our streets, sidewalks, squares and public places.\nThat includes crowded public places and busy pedestrian thoroughfares in the city’s Historic District such as Bull Street and Oglethorpe Avenue where a drive-by shooting took place recently or Ellis Square, the scene of a late-night shootout.\nThe Savannah-Chatham police force is budgeted for 605 sworn officers but has as many as 100 positions vacant at any given time.\nTo blame all of the problems — a chronically high vacancy rate, poor morale and the ongoing flight of experienced officers — on corrupt former police chief Willie Lovett is nothing more than shameless buck-passing.\nAs Joseph Lumpkin, the current chief, does his best to undo the damage he inherited, the responsibility for past inaction rests on Mayor Edna Jackson and incumbent members of the city council.\nNow, the choice comes down to which candidates have the best ideas to improve public safety and can be best trusted to get the job done.\nCompetency and leadership\nSavannahians of a certain age can look back and remember a time when city government seemed to run without the kind of bone-headed moves the city has made in recent years — buying and paying too much for property it doesn’t need and can’t use on Waters Avenue, Hall Street and Martin Luther King Boulevard and investing in a $325,000 community center that will have to be torn down, on Waters Avenue again.\nUnder Savannah’ council-manager form of government, elected officials aren’t in charge of day-to-day operations. That’s the responsibility of the city manager who is hired by and reports to the council.\nCurrent City Manager Stephanie Cutter is a breath of fresh air in the wake of her predecessor, Rochelle Small-Toney, but the jury on Cutter’s overall performance is still out and her future employment will be a major order of business for the next council.\nIn evaluating what direction to take regarding Cutter’s tenure, it’s important that council members have a good mix of competent and even-handed people who have experience in supervising others, reading and understanding budgets and have experience with goal-oriented organizations.\nVision: A long-range plan\nThe city’s next administration must work on a long-range plan. The lack of such a strategic blueprint partly explains why the city often appears to have attention deficit disorder when it come to choosing and tackling projects and then seeing them through to fruition.\nThat includes projects such as the bungled construction of a yet-to-be-built cultural arts center and creates a pattern that fails to build public confidence as the city eyes other projects, especially that of building a $125 million arena as part of redeveloping the so-called Canal District west of downtown.\nThe mayor and council must develop a vision of where they see Savannah in the future and use that vision to generate a road map of where Savannah needs to go to best position itself as a prosperous and vibrant 21st century city. Then it needs to break that plan down into smaller pieces, complete with scorecards to measure its progress.\nAmong the pieces that should be included in this vision and a long-range plan are:\n• Reducing poverty. Savannah’s poverty rate of 28 percent contributes to a host of ills, including crime and societal problems. Fresh ideas and leadership are needed, and it’s going to require a collaborative effort.\n• Improving the quality of life in the city’s many diverse neighborhoods. This includes recreational and youth-development programs, better infrastructure to reduce flooding and improve drainage and steps to calm traffic.\n• Moving faster on an area-wide broadband plan to fully embrace and to capitalize on new technology.\n• Consolidating local government. Combining governments for efficiency and planning reasons — and to end petty political bickering — is the way Georgia is trending. Savannah and Chatham County are conspicuously alone among mid-sized metropolitan areas in the state with our dual municipal and county governments. Local leaders, including the next City Council, should be thinking along this line.\n• Improving the climate for business startups. While the city has made progress in this area, it lacks overall direction and any sense of urgency.\nTHE SCHEDULE\nThe Savannah Morning News will publish our endorsements in the City Council and mayoral races, beginning today with the two at-large contests and running through Nov. 1:\n• Today: Alderman at-large posts 1 and 2.\n• Monday, Oct. 26, 1st District Alderman.\n• Tuesday, Oct. 27, 2nd District Alderman.\n• Wednesday, Oct. 28, 3rd District Alderman.\n• Thursday, Oct. 29, 4th District Alderman.\n• Friday, Oct. 30, 5th District Alderman.\n• Saturday, Oct. 31, 6th District Alderman.\n• Sunday, Nov. 1, Mayor of Savannah.", "external_links": ["http://sav-cdn.com/sites/all/themes/savannahnow/images/blank.gif"], "published": "2015-10-24T17:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T12:04:57.478+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
