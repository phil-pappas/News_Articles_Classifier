India, looking to defending the title for the third consecutive time, will take on Great Britain in the title clash tomorrow. India began on an attacking note today, but Australia played a strong defensive game, denying their opponents any chances to score. Australia’s main chances came in the form of two penalty corners but they failed. In the 27th minute, Kiran Arunasalam scored a goal for Australia but it was subsequently disallowed by the umpires. After a goalless first half, India finally got a goal in the 42nd minute when Harmanpreet Singh converted a penalty stroke. Australia managed to get three more penalty corners in the 44th, 49th and 50th minutes, but could not convert the chances. “It is great to finish the league matches on a winning note. It wasn’t an easy game and we played against a tough Australian team today,” said India coach Harendra Singh. India will face last year’s losing finalists Great Britain, who have remained unbeaten in the tournament so far with three wins and two draws. The win took India to the top of the points table with 12 points from 4 wins and a single loss, to Great Britain. Sumit Kumar and Harmanpreet, with three goals each, are the top scorers for India so far. “I think it’s going to be a well-contested final. Both the teams are well prepared for it and I think that it’s going to be a world class match,” said Harendra. “We’re not going to be overconfident because we are the defending champions; anything can happen. The winner will be the team that can better capitalise on the chances.” “Our tactical strengths so far have been the rotation of the ball so as long as we keep that up and improve our weaknesses we will do well in the final,” he added. — PTI", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T04:16:06.509+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
