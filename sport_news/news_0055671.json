They drew on that experience in a three-set match Thursday against Valparaiso's Matthew Cory and Raymond Kreloff.\nThe Trojan duo prevailed 6-2, 4-6, 6-2 as part of Chesterton's 4-1 victory over Valparaiso to capture the Portage Sectional championship — the second sectional title in a row for Chesterton.\n\"After that second set, the first thing out of Chris' mouth was, 'We're not panicking. We've got this third set,'\" Chesterton coach Tom Bour said. \"And then they just turned it around. That's where that experience jumped in.\"\nBoth Fouts and Nabhan said, in being partners for two seasons, it took time to develop the chemistry they now enjoy.\n\"We somehow managed to sneak by. We'd always pull out some late clinchers,\" Fouts said. \"Now it feels like I know if Zac is going to run across the court and he knows that I'm going to cover his alley.\"\nChris Fouts, Zac Nabhan take Chesterton to 2nd straight sectional title Kyle Telechan / Post-Tribune Chesterton's Zac Nabhan returns the ball to Valparaiso during the No. 1 doubles match on Thursday.

(Kyle Telechan / Post-Tribune) And that connection helped the duo get by on another cold, blustery day at Portage.\n\"You couldn't think about the fact that the wind was there,\" Nabhan said. \"You just had to hit your shots.\"\nThat No. 1 doubles match was the only one to go three sets. Chesterton's Cameron Cook and Alec Emmons scored a two-set win at No. 2 doubles, while Matt Jewison added a 6-2, 6-1 victory at No. 3 singles.\nAt No. 2 singles, Chesterton senior Dylan Jayasuriya changed his game plan from his previous meeting with Valparaiso's Maxwell Behrend — a match that went three sets.\n\"My biggest problem in the regular-season match was being too passive with my shots and letting him dictate most of the shots,\" Jayasuriya explained. \"So (Thursday) I was trying to be more aggressive and come to the net a lot more. It definitely paid off.\"\nAn aggressive approach was the Trojans' common theme, the whole team hardly containing its enthusiasm during warm-ups.\n\"We were almost trying to calm them down,\" Bour said. \"They didn't complain about the cold or the wind. They just wanted to get out on the court and get going.\"\nValparaiso's lone victory came at No. 1 singles, where Derek Wappel defeated Johnny Mario 6-2, 6-4.\nMelton is a freelance writer for the Post-Tribune.\nCopyright © 2015, Post-Tribune Maxwell Sports", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-560dd4cc/turbine/ct-ptb-boys-tennis-portage-st-1002-2-jpg-20151001", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-560dd4c8/turbine/ct-ptb-boys-tennis-portage-st-1002-20151001"], "published": "2015-10-02T03:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T15:36:18.021+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
