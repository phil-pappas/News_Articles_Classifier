Clark gear to help people in the Chicago area get outside.\n“Lewis N. Clark is a Chicago-based brand rooted in adventure travel. We might not have mountains in our backyard, but we have miles of Midwestern prairie land, natural dell rock formations to climb, and rivers to paddle. Adventures Accessed works to get Chicago natives outside to enjoy these natural landscapes and Lewis N. Clark is happy to sponsor them with the right gear to make the most of their trips,” said Jen Panattoni, Director of Marketing.\nAaron Wolf founded Adventures Accessed after discovering that he didn’t like working in noisy downtown Chicago. However, he also learned that many people did not have the ability to leave the city or own the proper outdoor equipment. “So I took those issues and purchased a ton of gear, a 12 passenger van, got outfitter and guide permits and am trying to eliminate the stigma that there is nothing to see in the Midwest,” he said.\nSome of the organization’s trips include whitewater rafting, sustainable farming, horseback riding, backpacking, and overnight adventures like meteor shower watching. It also offers services for corporate teams, youth groups, and spiritual organizations. Individuals are welcome to Create Your Own Trip (C.Y.O.T.) as well.\nCurrently, Adventures Accessed leads trips throughout Illinois, Wisconsin, Indiana, and Michigan. “There are forest systems that span acres in the hundreds of thousands with more trails and lakes to see in a decade. Bears, eagles, otters, fruit and herbs are abundant in areas of the Midwest but no one really thinks to look here for them,” Wolf added.\nIndividuals interested in planning an outdoor trip are encouraged to contact Adventures Accessed .\nAbout LCI Brands\nLCI Brands (formerly known as L.C. Industries, Inc.) is located just outside Chicago and is home to brands such as Lewis N. Clark® and UrbanGear.
