This matchup will be priority No. 1 for the Chiefs. Bishop leads the Mustangs with five touchdowns and has compiled 304 yards on 12 receptions. Every time Bishop gets his hands on the ball, it is for a big play. Cruz,will once again be tasked with limiting those plays. He has more than held his own on the outside filling in for an injured DJ Velazquez with four interceptions and he could add another one by the end of the night. Buena RB Quadir Albright (5-5, 160) vs. Mainland LB Dean Deveney (6-4, 215). Albright made his return against Holy Spirit last week and produced in a big way, rushing for 153 yards and a touchdown on just seven carries. The big plays were back for Buena and they’ll want to keep things rolling on the ground. In the way is the physically imposing Deveney. The senior has great size to plug up the middle, but it will be interesting to see if he can make plays on the outside where Albright thrives. If the Mustangs can’t get to Albright, it could be a long night. Buena LB Eddie Torres (6-2, 210) vs. Mainland QB Sam Jackson (5-10, 170). Jackson has been having great success finding Bishop and it will be up to Buena to cut the connection. To have those big plays, Jackson needs time and Torres needs to make sure he has none of it. Although the Chiefs’ line has done a good job of manufacturing their own pressure, it couldn’t hurt to sent in Torres a few times to make sure Jackson feels uncomfortable. Torres also has the athleticism to line up on the inside should Bishop move around the formation. \nKeys to the Game Buena has to contain Jackson. Even though the Mustang signal caller has just 26 rushing yards on the season, he has the capacity to break out of the pocket. In last year’s contest, Jackson scored both of Mainland’s touchdowns on the ground in the first half. He had 55 yards to lead the team. He will probably take fewer chances on the ground, but the Chiefs must be ready in case he tucks the ball and runs. Buena needs establish a lead. The Chiefs are a different team when they can control the tempo. They did a great job of it last week in their 47-21 drubbing of Holy Spirit. Picking up first downs and keeping that clock running will be important because they might not be able to rip off long runs this time around. In last year’s matchup, Buena didn’t ever have a lead until the game-winning score in overtime. Buena can’t keep giving the ball away. The Chiefs had four turnovers last week and those miscues helped make the game closer than it should have been. Holy Spirit scored 15 of its points directly off fumbles and the Chiefs can’t allow for a repeat of that in this game. \nPrediction", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T17:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T07:45:21.846+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
