(AP) — New York Jets rookie defensive lineman Leonard Williams showed his support for the USC football program while wearing a Trojans T-shirt in the locker room. \nWilliams played three seasons at USC, including last year with coach Steve Sarkisian, who was fired Monday — one day after the university placed the troubled coach on leave when it determined he wasn’t in condition to lead practice. \nWilliams says Wednesday he is wearing the shirt because he wanted to “represent” the program while it goes through a difficult time. Offensive coordinator Clay Helton is serving as the interim coach. \nWilliams, the No. 6 overall pick in the draft, says he feels bad for the USC players. He adds that he never saw any signs of trouble with Sarkisian, calling him “a great guy.” \n___ \nAP NFL website: www.pro32.ap.org and http://twitter.com/AP_NFL Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T01:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T01:56:04.261+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
