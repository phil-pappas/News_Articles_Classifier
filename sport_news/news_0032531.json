(Photo: File/ASSOCIATED PRESS) 7 CONNECT 7 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nFor the Washington Nationals, the 2015 baseball season is over. \nThe lights are dark at Nationals Park, the manager has been fired and come Nov. 1, a quartet of the team’s better players are free agents and may not return next season. \nIt wasn’t supposed to be this way. \nAt the start of the season, the gurus predicted that the Nationals had the best chance of any of the 30 major league teams of not only making the postseason, but also winning the World Series. \nFor me, a longtime Washington baseball fan who goes back to the 1950s, this season was a disappointment, but compared with the distant past, it was a decent year, when comparing wins and losses. \nPerhaps, I, along with other followers, have been spoiled by the team’s recent success. \nTo show why I say that, let me take you back into time, back to the early 1950s when I first became a Senators fan. That’s what the Nationals were known as then. \nMy dad, who grew up in Staunton, had gone to D.C. for night college, and had attended many Washington baseball games, which were then played at old Griffith Stadium. And my mom was a big fan as well. I remember them telling me about seeing Babe Ruth play, and other Hall of Famers. \nIn any event, I grew up in a baseball culture. As a child, I was taken to just about every Staunton Braves game, whether at home or in Linville, Shenandoah, Craigsville or other stops on the way. \nAnd for professional ball, the TV was always on to Channel 5 for the Senators games, or the radio to listen to Bob Wolff or Arch McDonald broadcast the games. \nBut the highlight of the baseball year for me was always those trips to Washington and Griffith Stadium. \nWe’d hop the mountain to Charlottesville, and then go up Route 29 (the Interstate Highway System wasn’t yet built). In Arlington, we would stop for breakfast at an old Peoples Drug Store. \nThen it was on to D.C. We’d stay at my aunt’s house on 30th Street, and from there we went to Griffith Stadium. \nI’ll never forget that old ball park. Everything was painted in dark green, and there were bleachers in left with a monster wall in right field. \nNames like Pedro Ramos, Camilo Pascual, Roy Sievers, Eddie Yost ... they were the Senators at that time .. still resonate in my mind. \nBut the point I want to make, is that the team was never any good. Losing season followed losing season, and more losing seasons. \nThe Yankees were the perennial pennant winners and the Senators the annual cellar-dwellers. \nThe old saying, “Washington — first in war, first in peace and last in the American League” never was truer. \nThings were so bad the city lost major league teams twice. \nJust as the Senators were becoming winners with the “Fearsome Foursome” of Sievers, Jim Lemon, Bob Allison and Harmon Killebrew, owner Calvin Griffith pulled up stakes and moved the franchise to Minneapolis in 1961. \nWashington got an expansion franchise, and it was basically a non-winner too. Over its 11 years, only once did it finish with a record over .500. \nThe expansion Senators played in the new D.C. Stadium, which I thought at that time was the most beautiful place to play a ball game ever built. \nBut it was a loser on the field, and it left for Texas in 1972. On the final game in Washington, the team’s favorite, Frank Howard, homered. The Senators were beating the Yankees in the ninth inning when the fans rushed the field and the game had to be forfeited. \nAnd that was the last baseball in Washington for over a 30-year period until the Montreal franchise was shifted to D.C. in 2005. \nFor the first seven years, there was no winner with the new Nationals. In 2008 the team was 59-102 and in 2009, 59-103, so woeful that the squad was last place both years in major league baseball. \nI was beginning to think that in my lifetime, I would never see Washington as a league champion. There wasn’t one with the old Senators, and the new Nats were as bad or worse. \nBut those two years turned out to be a blessing in disguise. It gave the Nationals first round draft choices each year, and with it came Stephen Strasburg and Bryce Harper. \nAnd things turned around. The 98-64 record of 2012 produced the first pennant winner in my lifetime as the Nats won the National League East. They repeated in 2014 with a 96-66 record. \nAnd maybe that spoiled me, and other Washington fans, to expect even bigger things in the future. \nSports writers picked the Nationals not only to advance to postseason play this year, but also to win the World Series. \nIt was a logical choice. The Nats had probably the best pitching rotation in Major League Baseball, and a solid batting lineup plus a reliable bullpen. \nBut things began to fall apart on opening day when errors led to a 3-1 loss to the Mets. \nAnd it was downhill from there. Because of injuries, only twice all season did Washington have all its players available for a game in a lineup that general manager Mike Rizzo envisioned at the start of the season. \nInjuries decimated the batting order. Everyday players Ryan Zimmerman, Jason Worth, Anthony Rendon and Denard Span lost huge chunks of the season due to injuries with multiple players out at times. \nThe revamped batting order as well as the bullpen did not live up to expectations. The Nats were sixth in the National League with a 3.62 earned run average while last year, they were best in the major leagues at 3.03. \nStill with a chance to make the playoffs late in the season, it was the bullpen that collapsed in a three-game series with St. Louis and another three-gamer with the Mets that doomed their playoff hopes. \nAfter watching the last game of the year on MASN, Nats broadcaster F.P. Santangelo said that not meeting expectations would result in consequences. \nAnd the following day, manager Matt Williams and his entire coaching staff were fired. This came a year after he was selected the National League manager of the year. \nWilliams had gotten into trouble with some questionable moves in the postseason series with San Francisco in 2014, and this year, many decisions both in batting and in relief pitching didn’t pan out. \nCertainly the way he handled the Harper and Jonathan Papelbon scuffle in the dugout when Papelbon had a choke-hold on Harper didn’t help. This incident took place near the end of the season when Papelbon yapped at Harper for not running out a fly ball quickly enough to first base, then the two got into a scuffle and had to be separated. Williams took Harper out of the lineup, but left Papelbon to pitch the ninth inning. He blew the game, and left the mound to a loud chorus of boos from the stands. \nNow, 2016 will certainly have a different look. There will be a new manager, and the team will probably lose four stalwarts of the past to free agency — Jordan Zimmermann, Ian Desmond, Span and Doug Fister. Other changes, particularly in the relief pitchers are probably on the way. \nWhere in the past, everything was pretty much in stone for the following season, nothing is at this point. \nSo, for this old Washington baseball fan, the just completed 83-79 season, with all the injuries, wasn’t so bad, compared with the distant past which saw sometimes 50-some wins. But it certainly wasn’t up to current expectations. \nWhat the future brings? Who knows. But Rizzo is good at putting a team together as attested by the 363-285 record over the last four seasons. You can bet that Washington will again be in the pennant fight in 2016. \nLet’s just hope the injuries stay away and the team finds better leadership. \nContact Ken Bosserman at kbosserman@newsleader.com. 7 CONNECT 7 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://www.newsleader.com/story/sports/2015/10/10/worst-season-nats-fans-spoiled-lot/73747752/ TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T02:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T22:08:13.641+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
