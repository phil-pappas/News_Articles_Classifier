(WKYT) – Woodford Co. offensive lineman Drake Jackson is one of three Kentucky high school players that will participate in the U.S. Army All-American Bowl. \nOn Friday, Jackson became the first of the three to receive a ceremonial jersey. The others, Landon Young and Kash Daniel, will receive their jerseys next week. \nAll three players have committed to play at Kentucky. \nJackson said it was a dream of the three players to play in something like the U.S. Army All-American Bowl game, which will take place on Jan. 9 in San Antonio. Jackson said the three once talked about it during a middle school all-star camp. \n“We were like, ‘dude, we can't wait,’” Jackson said. “We're going to try to get to this level again when we're in high school, and hopefully, play at the same college. Looking back it's pretty funny, because both of those dreams came true.” \nYoung, an offensive tackle from Lafayette, will receive his U.S. Army All-American jersey on Monday. \n“Being able to come and support my guys, it's sort of like, they're your buds,” Young said. “You're going to have their back on the field, so why not come and have their back when they're not on the field.” \nJackson and Young both plan to make the trip to Johnson Co. on Tuesday, when Daniel, a linebacker from Paintsville, gets his jersey. \n“We all just hit it off,” Jackson said of the bond formed by the three players. \n“We've all got a lot of similarities. Kash and Landon love to go fishing and hunting. We're all really cool and it's because we're from the state of Kentucky, going to play at Kentucky, and we get to be U.S. Army All-Americans.” \n“We end up committing to Kentucky, and now we talk and text all the time,” Young said. “We're sort of like the three amigos out here, the UK commits. We've created a really good relationship over the years.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T01:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T16:17:16.830+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
