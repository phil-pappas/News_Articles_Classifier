It had already entered into Schilling’s permanent CNN, Huffington Post, Internet search engine record. He’s “anti-Muslim.”\nAnd so the truth, not that it matters to easily frightened and selectively indignant ESPN nor other mass-media outlets, has been devalued to the sum of zero as it travels completely around the world.\nWhile I’m no fan of Schilling, the talk-games-to-death analyst — “Death to America’s baseball telecasts!” — his permanent staining and defaming is just plain un-American, cruel but no longer unusual punishment.\nIn fact, Schilling’s tweet was not anti-Muslim; it addressed Muslim “extremists,” comparing them to World War II Nazis — both master race murderers eager to commit religion-driven genocide — which, as a matter of historical fact, is a solid comparison.\nYet, ESPN, which regularly hires pre-established me-first creeps and braggarts because that’s ESPN’s sense of both sports and appeal to the omnipotent young male wise-guy demographic, could not suffer such Schilling’s fact-based opinion.\nIt suspended him with this: “Curt’s Tweet was completely unacceptable, and in no way represents our company’s perspective.”\nAlthough ESPN didn’t explain its “perspective,” do we assume it’s supportive of Islamic extremists or just believes them a lesser threat to civilized civilization than were Nazis?\nCurt Schilling Photo: Getty Images Schilling, his career on the line and broke from rotten investments, was forced to apologize.\nHere’s another fact that won’t make history’s cut: Many ESPN employees were appalled by ESPN’s reaction to Schilling’s words. Of course, they can’t speak out publicly for fear of reprisals.\nPART II: This week, the NFL Players’ Association became the latest to make a deal with a “fantasy league” (real lost money) bookmaker, signing for NFL players’ cross-promotional presence and piece of DraftKings’ rake and take.\nAs subjugated truths go, consider that there is not one team owner in any pro sport, not one pro league commissioner, not one players’ union executive who has openly declared what many-to-most know to be true:\nGambling on their sports and/or players is not something they should be part of, let alone encourage. They know it’s wrong.\nThey know it’s predicated on the public being suckered into losing their money, their sense and their good sense of the games played. They know that beyond ill-gained potential profits, there is no upside. And wait until consumers discover that despite the ads’ endless parade of young, male-adult, big winners, these are bad bets, with long odds and poor payoffs.\nBut the truth sits gagged and guarded by money. MLB’s Steroid Era renewed. Everyone who stood to profit — Bud Selig as the CFOs for the team owners, the players’ unions and the players — knew it was wrong, saw it was wrong.\nBut money bought their silence and their souls. Don’t rock that money boat. Why Congress only subpoenaed players, and not team owners and GMs to explain how they didn’t notice that spray hitters, over night and well into their 30’s, became muscle-massed sluggers, well, too late to pursue such truths.\nSo don’t rock this onshore gambling boat. Even if the weight of the gold — the all-aboard greed — will send it to the bottom.\nHeck, Wednesday’s Channel 4 six o’clock news was sponsored by DraftKings. Bet daily, nightly, go, go, go! Big winners everywhere! Everyone into the pool! Missing, though, is unadvertised term of engagement: Lose as much as possible as often as possible.\nPART III: With Larry Brown’s SMU program slapped hard by the NCAA for lying and cheating, count another Basketball Hall of Famer enshrined despite clear evidence that genuine integrity is a disqualifier. Brown, inducted into the Hall of Fame Class of 2002, by then had failed two NCAA stink tests, first at UCLA and was then at Kansas.\nAt UCLA, the program’s 1980 title-game appearance was vacated and it was place on probation for two years after it was discovered players were given improper benefits.\nAt KU, even the conspicuously shameless was green-lighted. In 1983, Brown somehow was able to land the nation’s top recruit, Danny Manning, who lived in North Carolina.\nBut the Manning family was about to relocate to Kansas. Why? Danny’s father, Ed, former NBAer, was hired by KU as Brown’s assistant coach. Small world, eh? As another Larry, “Larry The Cable Guy,” advocates, “Git ‘er done.”\nFascinating, how the most self-evident truths escape those who run sports. Must be none of their business.\nMore of Francesa’s fallacies Sept. 11, 2013, a soulful Mike Francesa speaks: “There’s a way people should be treated, and that’s really important to me. And it’s something I’ve done on this show … I’ve always tried to give you a very classy show.”\nMike Francesa, Sept. 28, 2015: “Mike in New Haven; what’s up, Mike?”\nMINH: “I want to talk about that Nationals situation, but before I do, I was at the Yankee game yesterday, and got to take a tour of the field after the game … ”\nMike Francesa Photo: GC Images Francesa, annoyed, interrupts: “No one cares about the Yankee game. That’s not high on our list. What else ya got? I don’t wanna hear about your tour. What else? Come on. Wanna talk about the Nationals? Go ahead.”\nShaken, MINH, begins to talk about the Nationals. Francesa cuts him off, doesn’t allow him to finish a sentence.\nAlso, as supplied by Francesa monitor @RNs_Funhouse, Tuesday, the all-knowing Francesa, had no idea that Larry Brown and SMU were even under NCAA investigation — a months-old story — let alone sanctioned, several hours before.\nSame show: Francesa twice authoritatively stated, “There are years when the Yankees have entered through the wild card and won the World Series.” Never happened, not even once.\nIf you’re scoring at home, another 5-F — Fabulous, Fabricated, Fraudulent Francesa Fact.\nAnd with an ugly storm, Joaquin, yesterday threatening, we were reminded of Francesa’s meteorological prowess, his knowing, lost-tape tout that Hurricane Sandy would be no more than a steady drizzle.
