Coach Jeff Fisher said Monday that Longâ€™s injury is a result of hyperextension, but that ligament damage has been ruled out, so Fisher considered it good news. Saffold injured his right shoulder and was undergoing testing for potential labrum issues. He underwent surgery on the left shoulder in the offseason. The Rams released running back Trey Watts, who returned last week after a four-week suspension. Fisher said the team intends to sign Watts to the practice squad if he clears waivers. The Rams have a bye this week before playing host to the Cleveland Browns on Oct. 25.
