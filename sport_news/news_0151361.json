He's made that much obvious over the course of his career, and he still has a few things to say about the Buffalo Bills .\nWhen the Bills were for sale last summer, Trump, who is now running for president of the United States, was in the thick of the bidding process. He claims he offered $1 billion cash for the franchise that sold to Terry and Kim Pegula for $1.4 billion last September. In an interview that appeared in the print edition of Sports Illustrated last week, Trump said he's happy things worked out the way they did.\n\"I'm glad, because if I bought the Buffalo Bills, I probably would not be doing what I'm doing now, which is much more important,\" Trump said.\nBecoming president is certainly a more important gig than owning the Bills\n\"I would have done a good job with the team, but I wouldn't be doing what I'm doing now,\" Trump said. \"So you understand. Now, that's today. I'm No. 1 in the polls. Ask me that question in two months; who knows, right?\"\nTrump is the leading candidate to win the Republican nomination for president. There's still a long way to go in the race, but if you ask Trump, missing out on his chance to own an NFL team is what pushed him to go after something bigger. So depending on your views on Trump, the Bills may deserve some credit — or blame — for his rise in the race.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T05:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T01:03:23.975+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
