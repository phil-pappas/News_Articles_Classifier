We're so used to playing on turf,\" North Hunterdon coach Steve DeLorenzo said. \"I think our touches weren't as crisp as they normally are. But they are a tough team. They play with a lot of heart and a lot of desire.\" \nThankfully for the Lions, they had some experiencing practicing on a grass field. \n\"It was a little of a struggle to play on the grass field. But we had practice on grass so that helped us out a lot,\" North Hunterdon junior goalkeeper Olivia Ripnyak said. \"Having one of our tournament games on grass, we were a little scared but we knew we could do it because we were practicing on grass.\" \nRipnyak was able to handle the bounces on Saturday no matter the surface, making five saves to keep Belvidere off the scoreboard and preserve the 1-0 win. \n\"It was a big team effort,\" Ripnyak said. \"I didn't get much action today. But the defense helped keep the ball away.\" \nThe goalkeeper was also relieved that her teammate Heather Tostevin was able to score in the first overtime and end any chance at penalty kicks. \n\"I was really excited,\" Ripnyak said. \"I mean in overtime, I thought in my mind we were going to PK's. Then Heather knocked it in and I was like, 'yea!' Less stressful for me.\" Olivia Ripnyak (Josh Folck | For lehighvalleylive.com ) \nThe Lions held a 20-6 edge in shots in the game. And although they had trouble getting one past Belvidere goalkeeper Christine Fox, DeLorenzo was confident that his team would eventually get the job done. \n\"I'm sure it's frustrating,\" DeLorenzo said about coming up empty on so many chances. \"I have such a great group of girls this year. They are just an incredible group. They work really hard. The fact of the matter was it wasn't our best game. We didn't play as well as we have been playing. For whatever reasons, I don't know. The one thing we always do is, we play hard. These girls play as hard as any team I ever coached in my life. And that's 20 years worth of coaching. They play hard even if they aren't clicking on all cylinders. We had our chances and I think they knew sooner or later, we would get our chance and they just kept plugging away.\" \nIt is DeLorenzo's first season as North Hunterdon girls coach after assisting Lions boys coach John Simpson the last 12 seasons. \nNorth Hunterdon, the sixth seed, will play at second-seeded Sparta on Saturday in the semifinals. \nThe Lions are 7-5-2 on the season and Ripnyak thinks the team is in a good place right now. \n\"I think our team is playing fantastic,\" the goalkeeper said. \"As a team, we're really coming together. We're all really close. We bond really well and I think that definitely shows on the field.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T07:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T02:55:37.553+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
