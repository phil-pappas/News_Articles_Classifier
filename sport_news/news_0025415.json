A key recommendation by Scala was shifting the power balance away from the elected members.\nThe existing executive committee under Scala's proposal would become a governing body elected by all 209 FIFA members with responsibility for \"strategic matters, supervision\" while a management board would take day-to-day decisions. A commercial board would deal with contracts and a development board would allocate funding to soccer projects.\nCONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Copyright 2015 The Associated Press.
