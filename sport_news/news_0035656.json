It is a very important week for us -- Sevilla on Wednesday in the Champions League and then the Manchester derby at the weekend,\" he said. \nUnited will relish next weekend's Manchester derby too after demolishing Everton at a sombre Goodison Park where fans took part in a minute's applause for Howard Kendall, the club's twice league-winning manager, who died on Saturday, aged 69. \nGoals by Morgan Schneiderlin and Ander Herrera put United in control and Rooney completed the win at his former club. \nRooney, who has 187 Premier League goals, second only to Alan Shearer, said: \"It was a very good performance. We were disappointed about the Arsenal game (losing 3-0), and we know coming here is difficult, but it's a well-deserved victory and we're delighted.\" \nJose Mourinho's troubled start to the season took an upturn as his Chelsea side steadied the ship with a 2-0 home win against struggling Aston Villa, although they were helped by a goalkeeping error from Brad Guzan and Alan Hutton's own goal. \nHigh-flying West Ham notched a fourth away win this season, Manuel Lanzini and Dimitri Payet scoring late in a 3-1 victory at London rivals Crystal Palace, who played half the match with 10 men after Dwight Gayle was red-carded just before the break. \nWest Ham's former manager Sam Allardyce's first game in charge of Sunderland ended in a dismal 1-0 defeat at West Bromwich Albion, leaving them second from bottom. \nMid-table Southampton led 2-0 against fifth-placed Leicester City but were pegged back and drew 2-2. \n($1 = 0.6477 pounds)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T20:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T20:34:24.511+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
