The Lady Bulldogs now will face Houston in a 12:30 p.m. elimination game at Blackman High School.\n\"We got comfortable,\" Bearden coach Zach Forgani said. \"I'm not going to blame (the outage), but sitting around all day did not help us. It's tough to come back after losing a set like that (third one).\"\nThe third set was decisive. Siegel broke a 7-7 tie with a 12-2 run for a commanding 19-9 lead. The Lady Stars scored 18 of the set's final 22 points.\n\"We didn't really come together as a team,\" Bearden junior Kristin Dowling said. \"We knew coming here that we had not peaked and we definitely have to play more as a team.\"\nIn the fourth set, Siegel led 17-16 before winning three consecutive points and outscoring Bearden 8-3 down the stretch.\n\"We will have to play an extra game or two, but we'll be fine after we get some food and rest,\" Forgani said.\nJunior Chesney McClellan, a Nebraska commitment, had 17 kills, four blocks and 16 digs for Bearden. Dowling had 15 digs and 35 assists.\nBearden 3, Franklin 1: The Lady Bulldogs cruised in their opening match at MTSU's Murphy Center, beating Franklin 25-23, 25-18, 15-25, 25-17 to advance.\nClass AA\nCatholic Rallies To Advance: Catholic needed 10 sets to advance to Thursday's 2 p.m. semifinal at Siegel High School.\nThe Lady Irish edged Signal Mountain 20-25, 19-25, 23-25, 25-19, 15-10 late Wednesday, and now will play 2013 state champion Sullivan South for a berth in Friday's state final.\nCatholic also needed five sets in its opening match, which was interrupted nearly three hours by the power outage. It beat Hixson 26-28, 25-14, 25-22, 24-26, 15-5 at MTSU, before the final game was moved to Siegel.\nCatholic junior Kamila Cieslik said the Irish played \"kind of flat\" against Hixson after the outage.\n\"We finally got everybody focused,\" she said. \"We always knew we could win it.\"\nTom Wood is a freelance contributor.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T07:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T17:25:38.052+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
