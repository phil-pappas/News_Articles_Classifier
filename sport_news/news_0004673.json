But we've given ourselves a chance with a lead. \n\"If the guys (unbeaten batsmen Adil Rashid and Stuart Broad) can try and edge as much as they can and get a hundred lead then you just don't know.\" \nHe added: \"There's been a lot spoken about the pitch and how unresponsive it's been, but you've seen in subcontinental conditions how quickly it can change. \n\"The amount of wickets we lost in the final session gives you a glimmer of hope as a side trying to force a result.\" \nHe also supported Rashid, who went wicketless in the first innings, and recorded the worst-ever figures for a Test debutant. \n\"You've seen a world class spinner in (Zulfiqur) Babar take 70 odd overs to get a wicket. \n\"That's given him (Rashid) a little bit of confidence and that bit of rough brings him in the game massively. \n\"We won't put pressure on him as a side and hopefully he can go out and show all his tricks and hopefully come good for us.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T17:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T20:08:59.630+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
