Erik Verduzco/Las   Follow @Erik_Verduzco Related links Las   \nHe had a lot to Smylie about. \nPGA Tour rookie Smylie Kaufman had the best day of his brief professional career Sunday, tearing up TPC Summerlin with a 10-under-par 61 and holding off a half-dozen pursuers to win the Shriners Hospitals for Children Open. \nKaufman finished with a four-day total of 16-under 268. It was the highest winning score for the Shriners Open since the tournament went to a four-round format in 2004. In 2005, Wes Short Jr. won with a 266. \n\"I always knew the potential was there,\" Kaufman said. \"It was just a matter of figuring everything out and staying committed to most every one of my golf shots.\" \nKaufman's brilliant round, which was one shot off the course record of 60, came while a number of challengers were still playing. So he knew he had a long wait before finding out what his fate would be. But the 23-year-old from Birmingham, Ala., who starred at LSU managed to stay in front and he had a lot to be proud of in what was just his fifth pro tournament. \n\"It's funny, on nine I asked my caddie 'Who do you think is going to win this week?'\" Kaufman said. \"He's like, 'Well, I mean, I think there's more to be said. I think you can post a number and you could see what happens.' He knew better than I did, because I did it.\" \nKaufman earned $1,152,000 for the victory. He also received 500 FedEx Cup points, got a two-year exemption on the Tour and secured a spot in the field for next April's Masters. \n\"Honestly, it hasn't really sunk in yet,\" Kaufman said on what winning means for this season and his status on the Tour through 2018. \"I left it all out there and posted a number and luckily it held up.\" \nKaufman started quickly with a birdie on his second hole, but then he leveled off and was still at 1-under for his round until he made birdie at No. 8. That seemed to get him going as he went on to record four straight birdies and was 5-under through 11 holes. \nHe added yet another birdie at No. 13 before carding an eagle at the par-4 15th to get him to 8-under for the day. He finished up birdie-par-birdie for a 61 and the lead at 16-under. \nDid he see a 10-under round when he teed off Sunday? \n\"No. I just knew I was playing good, and you never know what's going to happen out here,\" Kaufman said. \"I just holed some putts on the back nine and stayed committed to what I was doing.\" \nHe had been part of a Sunday game of \"Tag\" at TPC Summerlin. Brett Stegmaier, the third-round leader 13-under, started out as it. Then it was William McGirt's turn. Then Kaufman was it. Then Kevin Na briefly was it before Kaufman was tagged again as the leader. \nFinally, after five-plus hours, Kaufman put an end to the chase as Na self-destructed with a horrible chip shot at the par-3 17th which led to bogey, and Stegmaier couldn't pick up the one extra shot he needed to pull even. \nAs his pursuers took their run at him, Kaufman hung out at the driving range, hit some balls, then watched the final few holes at the caddies' tent with Aaron Alpern, who had been his man on the bag this week. \n\"I dodged a lot of bullets coming down the stretch with guys coming in and I'm really thankful to get the W,\" Kaufman said. \nKaufman may have come to Las Vegas this week under everyone's radar, but he did play well last week in finishing in a tie for 10th place at the Frys.com Open in Napa, Calif. And when he had a 67 on Thursday at TPC Summerlin, perhaps everyone should have paid attention, though his second-round 72 on Friday hardly inspired confidence that he would be a factor on the weekend. \nBut Kaufman felt good about his game and it all came together for him Sunday. And for the second straight week, a Tour rookie came away with the top prize. Last week, it was Emiliano Grillo. \n\"It feels unbelievable,\" Kaufman said. \"A lot of hard work and dedication has gone into this. \n\"Emiliano and I had dinner a couple nights last week, so I guess you need to eat with Emiliano and you get to be a champion.\" \nContact reporter Steve Carp at scarp@reviewjournal.com or 702-387-2913.
