(Source: WBBM/CNN) \nCHICAGO (WBBM/CNN) - You'd be hard-pressed to find a sweeter Chicago cubs fan than Loretta Dolan. \nShe has been waiting more than a century to see a postseason Cubs victory. \nMonday she attended her first playoff game at Wrigley Field. That's where she recalled decades and decades of tracking the cubs. \n\"I'm 101 in two months,\" Dolan said. \"We used to take our own lunch and pop, and we never paid anything. We sit and cry when they don't win.\" \nDolan was treated to a dramatic playoff victory Monday. \nThe Cubs beat their archrivals, the St. Louis Cardinals, to take a 2-1 lead in the National League Division Series. \nOn Tuesday, the Cubs advanced to the National League Championship Series with a 6-4 win, the team's first-ever series clincher at home. \nCopyright 2015 WBBM via CNN.
