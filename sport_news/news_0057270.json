Authorities suspended dozens of flights and sea voyages due to the stormy weather, and many cities canceled classes Monday.\nLate Sunday night, the typhoon was blowing over the northern mountainous province of Ifugao and was continuing to weaken. It had sustained winds of 80 miles per hour and gusts of up to 100 mph and was blowing northward at just 3 mph, according to the government's weather agency. It's expected to weaken to a tropical storm by late Monday and exit the main northern island of Luzon on Wednesday.\nWhile weather conditions had begun to improve in some towns and villagers had started to clear roads of fallen trees and debris, Koppu still packed a ferocity that could set off landslides and flash floods, officials said.\n\"We're asking our countrymen not to become complacent,\" said Alexander Pama, who heads the government's disaster-response agency, citing how rainwater could cascade down mountainsides after Koppu passed and flood villages.\nThat happened in low-lying villages in six towns in Nueva Ecija, near Aurora, where some residents were trapped on rooftops by floodwaters, said Nigel Lontoc of the Office of Civil Defense.\nA teenager was pinned to death on Sunday by a fallen tree, which also injured four people and damaged three houses in suburban Quezon city in the Manila metropolis. In Subic town, northwest of Manila, a concrete wall collapsed and killed a 62-year-old woman and injured her husband, Lontoc said.\nThree fishermen missing at sea were rescued off northern Bataan province, and three other missing people were found in an evacuation camp in Aurora's Baler town, he said.\nPresident Benigno Aquino III and disaster-response agencies had warned that Koppu's rain and winds may potentially bring more damage with its slow speed. But Saludes, the government forecaster, said there was less heavy rain than expected initially in some areas, including in Manila, but that fierce winds lashed many regions.\nKoppu, Japanese for \"cup,\" is the 12th storm to hit the Philippines this year. An average of 20 storms and typhoons each year batter the archipelago, one of the world's most disaster-prone countries.\nIn 2013, Typhoon Haiyan, one of the most ferocious storms on record to hit land, barreled through the central Philippines, leveling entire towns and leaving more than 7,300 people dead or missing.\n-- The Associated Press", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T23:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T02:29:33.808+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
