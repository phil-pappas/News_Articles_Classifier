Both ex- Pakistani cricketers are currently commentating in the ongoing India and South Africa ODI series. According to Zee News , on Monday, Shiv Sena workers stormed the Indian board's office in Mumbai to protest against the PCB-BCCI talks. The former Pakistani cricketers will leave India after fourth ODI in Chennai on Friday to prevent any further mishap. According to Cricinfo , Arsalan Haider, who is the agent of Akram has said that the duo would commentate in the fourth ODI in Chennai and will return on 23 October, two days before the Mumbai ODI. Akram and Akhtar pulled out on their own and there was no pressure from anyone as it was about threat perception. The decision was taken a day after dozens of Shiv Sena fanatics stormed the BCCI headquarters and shouted anti-Pakistan slogans. International Cricket Council (ICC) has also withdrawn Pakistan umpire Aleem Dar for the last two ODIs.
