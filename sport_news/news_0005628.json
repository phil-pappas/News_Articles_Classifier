State dismisses RB Shadrach Thornton after latest incident The Associated Press (WTVD ABC11.com photo) RALEIGH - \nN.C. State has dismissed running back Shadrach Thornton from its football program, head coach Dave Doeren announced Wednesday afternoon. \nThe suspension comes on the heels of an incident where Raleigh police spokesman Jim Sughrue said Thornton was arrested on Tuesday after he struck a pedestrian while riding a moped on a sidewalk near campus and left the scene. \nIn an email, Sughrue said the pedestrian suffered \"non-life-threatening\" injuries, with an accident report stating the pedestrian suffered a facial injury that required stitches. \nSughrue said Thornton was later located at the parking deck of his nearby apartment and taken into custody without incident. \n“It’s an unfortunate set of circumstances, but we’ve made the decision to dismiss Shadrach from our program,” Doeren said in a press release. “We will continue to support him academically and help him earn his degree.” \nThornton, a senior from Hinesville, Ga., is on track to graduate in the spring. \nAccording to a magistrate's report, Thornton was charged Tuesday night with a misdemeanor of failing to provide his name, address and other personal information or \"reasonable assistance\" to the injured pedestrian. A traffic citation states Thornton is also charged with driving on the sidewalk and operating an unregistered vehicle. \nThornton and the pedestrian were headed toward each other on the sidewalk at the time of the incident. \nLast year's leading rusher recently returned from a two-game suspension for a violation of athletic department policy. It was the senior's third suspension, with the first two coming after brushes with the law in 2013. \nLee Turner, Thornton's Raleigh-based attorney, said Thornton cooperated with police. \n\"I understand that he was polite, cooperative and gave the officers a full statement about what happened,\" Turner said. \"I understand that after the accident he did have a conversation with the victim before leaving the scene.\" \nThornton sat out the 2013 opener during Doeren's first season after being charged with misdemeanor assault on female. Turner said previously that Thornton received counseling through a deferred-prosecution agreement that ultimately led to the dismissal of that charge. \nIn December 2013, Doeren indefinitely suspended Thornton after authorities cited him for misdemeanor simple possession of marijuana and drug paraphernalia. Turner said charges were later dismissed, leading to his reinstatement during last year's training camp to avoid sitting any games. \nAs Thornton prepared to return from his suspension entering Week 3, Doeren was asked about the number of chances he's given Thornton, a native of Hinesville, Georgia. Doeren said then that Thornton had been \"the best him that he's been since I've been here\" and that he had learned from his mistakes. \n\"But if I felt like I couldn't help him anymore, he wouldn't be here,\" Doeren said then. \nThornton ran for 907 yards and nine touchdowns last season. He ran for 92 yards and a touchdown in his return against Old Dominion, then 111 yards and two scores in last weekend's win at South Alabama. \nNorth Carolina State (4-0) hosts Louisville in its ACC opener Saturday. \nCopyright 2015 by WCTI12.
