Ashley Burkholder placed 19th with a time of 21:23, and three of her teammates joined her in the top 25. \n“We preached pacing and pack running, staying together.” Coach Dustin Favinger said. “They pushed the middle part of the course and did well. I am very proud of them. Phenomenal race.” \nThat team-first attitude paid off with a silver medal finish for Cozad. Third place Sidnet finished a single point behind the ‘Makers. \nBoone Central/Newman Grove took the top spot with 39 points, Cozad had 55. \nIn the Class C boys race, lone entry from the ECO team of Overton and Elm Creek Riley Nichols ran a strong second mile to finish in 39th out of 91 in his race. \nThe Lexington girls took to the starting line at 2:30 p.m. along with the other 11 teams , and 84 racers. \nLeah Treffer paced the squad with a 35th place finish on the way to a 10th place showing for the Maids. \nFreshman McKenna Kiburz would cross the line in 22:03, Yailin Santoyo and Bianca Hernandez would finish close behind. \nThe final race of the day was the Class B boys race. \nLexington senior and district champ JohnMark Shields looked to finish strong in the last race of his high school career. \n“I’ve raced this course seven times before, and I know when I need to push and when to run steady” Shields said prior to the race. “Hergenreder of Scottsbluff is someone I will be watching for at the end.” \nJoshua Hergenreder of Scottsbluff would be looking for Shields as well, after the Lexington runner beat him at the District meet last week. \nUltimately, Hergenreder got the best of Shields Friday, crossing the finish line two seconds earlier. Shields earned a fourth place finish. \n“I gave it my all, and while its disappointing not to finish higher, I know I did my best today, and I’m proud of how my team did.” Shields said. \nThe Lexington boys finished with five runners in the top 41, taking third in the team division. \nSee Wednesday’s edition of the Clipper-Herald for full results and more photos from State Cross Country.
