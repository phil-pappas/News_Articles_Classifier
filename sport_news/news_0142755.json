Now the Yankees needed to get 12 more Red Sox out for the victory, but setup men Justin Wilson and Dellin Betances and closer Andrew Miller had all pitched more than an inning the night before.\nLatest Yankees stories A-Rod's comeback season now includes playoffs Yanks clinch wild-card spot with 10,000th win Rieber: Yankees' wild card worth celebrating Gregorius proves worthy successor to Jeter Tanaka struggles early, Yanks can't clinch in extras Warren came to the rescue with three scoreless innings of relief to help the Yankees triumph, 4-1.\nOf course he did.\nWhen the Yankees were desperate for a starter at the beginning of the season, they asked him to move from the bullpen, and he became one of the team's most consistent starters, going 5-5 with a 3.59 ERA.\nYankees Yankees celebrate wild-card spot With his innings climbing and Ivan Nova returning from the disabled list, Warren was shifted back to the bullpen and made numerous comebacks possible by keeping the team close when starters faltered. Then he returned to the rotation when injuries to Masahiro Tanaka and Nathan Eovaldi hamstrung the team.\nAs a starter, he is 6-6 with a 3.66 ERA. As a reliever, he has pitched 351/3 innings to a 2.51 ERA.\n\"Every really good club that I've been on has seemed to have a guy like Adam Warren, who is able to do so many things for you as a pitcher,'' said manager Joe Girardi, who brought up the name of a key member of the Joe Torre championship teams. \"I first saw it in Ramiro Mendoza, the way that he could spot start and do those things.\"\n\"His value has been as big as any pitcher we have in that room. Look at what he did tonight. He was a big reason we won that game because he was able to give us three innings on a night when I didn't want to use Miller and I wasn't going to use Wilson. He did the job. He's invaluable.''\nSaid Warren, \"I remember in spring training thinking I want to do whatever it takes to help this team win ballgames. I feel like I have been that guy, back and forth.\"\nYankees Yankees vs. Red Sox \"And getting the opportunities to help this team has been a great experience for me. I don't worry about starting or relieving.\"Girardi said there is a chance Warren could be part of the postseason rotation if the club wins the AL wild-card game and advances to the AL Division Series.\nWarren didn't expect to be pitching Thursday, but when he arrived he was told to be ready to come out of the bullpen. He did what he always does: prepare. He allowed one hit and one walk and struck out three.\n\"I was just focused on getting through one hitter, one inning, and then they said 'can you go another?' and I said 'yes,'\" he said. \"And then 'can you go another?' And I said 'yes.' I was prepared to do whatever they needed.\"\nBut that's no surprise at this point. It's exactly what he's been doing all season.\nSubscribe to Newsdayâ€™s sports newsletter for stories, photos and videos about your favorite New York teams plus national sports news and events.", "external_links": ["http://embed.sendtonews.com/player/sidebar.php?pkey=Wr18b6nt&width=300&cid=3547&sound=no&playlist=no&upnext=yes"], "published": "2015-10-02T09:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T21:41:10.059+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
