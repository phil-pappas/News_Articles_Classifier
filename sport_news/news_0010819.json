He helped the Bears win a modern-era, NCAA -record 11 tournaments, but his decision to turn pro after his sophomore season still seemed curious — he was rail-thin and didn’t hit the ball especially far. \nMaybe he knew what he was doing. \nKim, 22, earned his way onto the PGA Tour by finishing 13th on the Web.com Tour money list last season. Now, in his first event as a member of the “big tour,” Kim finds himself on the leaderboard at this week’s Frys.com Open in Napa. \nHe shot 67 on Friday at Silverado Resort , to soar into the top 10. That left him at 6-under par for the tournament, three shots off the lead as the afternoon wave teed off. \nKim actually played in two PGA Tour events as an amateur in 2013, including the U.S. Open at Merion. He improbably moved into third-round contention there, ultimately landing low-amateur honors with his tie for 17th. Kim also tied for 38th in the Greenbrier Classic. \nThose experiences helped prepare him for the rookie season he’s launching at Silverado. \n“I definitely feel not as star-struck as I did at Greenbrier or the Open,” Kim said. “I don’t know if it’s because I’m a tour member now, or it’s just a time thing. But I definitely feel like I belong out here more than I did before.” \nKim estimated he hits his tee shots 20 yards farther now than he did at Merion, an increase he traced to dutiful work in the weight room. He ranked 65th on the Web.com Tour in driving distance last season, at a more-than-respectable 299.2 yards. \nHahn surges: Another Cal alum, James Hahn , also played well Friday. He matched the morning’s best round (66) to reach the weekend at 4-under par. \nHahn, who grew up in Alameda, picked up his first PGA Tour victory in Los Angeles in February. He collected only two top-20 finishes in his last 17 starts of the season, a potent reminder of the challenges ahead. \n“I understand it’s golf and it’s very unpredictable,” Hahn said. “One week you’re on top of the world and the next week you’re irrelevant.” \nHahn, who will leave about 50 tickets for family and friends this weekend at Silverado, has learned to adapt his schedule to courses he likes. He might play every tournament on the West Coast swing in early 2016 — and hardly any on the Florida swing. \nBriefly: The only other player to shoot 66 in the morning wave was Colt Knost , who also has Bay Area ties (sort of): He won the 2007 U.S. Amateur at the Olympic Club . … Stockton native Ricky Barnes shot 73 and was among those to miss the cut. \nRon Kroichick is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer.
