(AP) - Residential drug treatment centers struggling to meet the room size requirements needed for a license will soon get a break from the state.\nA newly released review of licensing procedures requested by Gov. Maggie Hassan shows some residential treatment providers are struggling to expand or provide licensed treatment beds under existing requirements that all double occupancy rooms be at least 160 square feet.\nThe report says health officials will now give waivers to programs with rooms of at least 120 square feet, the measure used in 17 other states.\nThe review is part of an effort to increase access to treatment programs for people suffering from substance abuse.\nThe state has seven licensed substance abuse treatment centers with 228 beds and two pending applications for 50 more beds.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
