Late slip costs Union win 1 / 6 Back to Gallery Schenectady\nOpening night for the Union College hockey team produced a solid effort for more than 58 minutes but all it took was for one mistake to ruin the team's 2015-16 debut.\nDespite holding a 32-18 shots-on-goal advantage, a defensive lapse late in the third period allowed Sacred Heart to tie the score before the teams finished overtime knotted at 1 Friday night in nonleague play at Messa Rink.\nUnion (0-0-1) grabbed a 1-0 lead on freshman Cole Maier 's first-period goal and put the defensive clamps on Sacred Heart until Spencer Graboski 's centering pass from behind the Union net found a wide-open Jacob Brightbill , who beat Dutchmen goaltender Alex Sakellaropoulos to tie the score with 1:20 left in regulation.\nMore Information\nUNION 1, SACRED HEART 1\nSacred Heart 0 0 1 0—1\nUnion 1 0 0 0—1\nFirst period— 1. Union, Maier 1, (Vecchione, Wilkins), 17:01. Penalties— Luczyk (SC), hooking, 5:39; Scarfo, (Uni), hooking), 9:47; Union bench, (too many men on the ice-served by Pontarelli), 14:19.\nSecond period— None. Penalties— Wilkins, Uni, (major, contact to head-game misconduct), 4:59; Kennedy, SH, (tripping), 15:20; Scarfo, Uni, (slashing), 16:31; Carroll, SH (roughing), 16:31; Butcher, SH, (hooking), 18:52.\nThird period— 2.

A— 2,026.\n\"It's the first game of the year, we're going to make mistakes and they capitalized on our mistake there and we didn't capitalize on theirs,\" Union coach Rick Bennett said. \"We left him (Sakellaropoulos) out to dry on that goal. Our guys know that.\"\nWhen he was called on, Sakellaropoulos (17 saves) came up big with his team protecting the lead.\nThe junior stopped Justin Danforth 's short-handed breakaway in the second period and then denied Evan Jasper by flashing his right pad while sprawling on the ice while Jasper skated through the crease with 2:32 left in the period.\n\"Those are saves I need to make, especially in a 1-0 game,\" Sakellaropoulos said. \"If I let those in, it is a totally different ball game.\"\nGoaltender Brett Magnus of Sacred Heart (0-0-1) was the busier of the two goalies and the freshman was heavily tested in the third period as Union tried to extend its lead.\nMagnus came up big when Ryan Scarfo redirected the puck on goal at 9:56 of the third and again on an Eli Lichtenwald slap shot from the slot with 7:30 to play in regulation.\n\"We had so many chances that we didn't bury and it came back to bite us in the end.\" Union's Mike Vecchione said. \"We look at it in a positive way. They are going to bounce our way one of these times.\"\nThe first period was a tight-checking battle and evenly played until Vecchione broke free in the Pioneers' zone and neatly centered the puck to a driving Maier, who was coming down the right side of Magnus.\n\"Wilky ( Matt Wilkins ) made a really good play, chipping it through there to Vex and he gave me an awesome pass on the two-on-one,\" Maier said.\nWilkins was issued a game misconduct for contact to the head when he hit Zach Luczyk near the Sacred Heart blue line at 4:59 of the second period.\nThe Dutchmen killed off the five-minute power play but were left without one of their leaders and members of the top line for the rest of the game.\n\"You really want to review those, but at the same token, it certainly didn't look like Matt's elbow came up at all,\" Bennett said. \"Last time I checked, that kid (Luczyk) came out for the second round of the power play so he couldn't have been too hurt.\"\nUnion returns to Messa Rink Saturday to play host to Boston University of the Hockey East Conference.\nSean Martin , a local freelance writer, is a frequent contributor to the Times Union .", "external_links": ["http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/34/47/8767983/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/34/47/8767985/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/34/47/8767980/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/34/47/8767980/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/34/47/8767985/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/34/47/8767981/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/34/47/8767982/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/34/47/8767982/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/34/47/8767984/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/34/47/8767984/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/34/47/8767983/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/34/47/8767981/3/920x920.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-10T07:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T08:21:35.364+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
