The Lady Badgers swept three matches last weekend to secure the crown. Friday, Powder Valley traveled to Wallowa, winning 25-16, 25-11, 25-11. “The girls were focused and ready to play coming off of a great week of practice,” said coach Marji Lind. Saturday, at North Powder, Powder Valley defeated Nixyaawii by forfeit before squaring off with Griswold for the title. Powder Valley won 25-7, 23-25, 25-23, 33-31. “The first game, our girls were on fire and Griswold struggled to warm up,” Lind said. However, in game two, Griswold re-awakened and was ready, Lind added. “The fourth and final game, was INTENSE,” the Powder coach said. “Both sides played with heart. Our girls never gave up and fought for every point. We were finally able to close the fourth game out 33-31. It was amazing to watch! Just the kind of game you want to have as you start to prepare for the district tournament next Saturday.” District will be Saturday at La Grande High School. The top three teams at district will advance to the Class 1A state tournament in November.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T10:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T22:40:19.832+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
