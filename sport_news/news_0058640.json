Formerly a heavy smoker, he had double heart bypass surgery in 1991 while he was still in charge of Barcelona, a role he eventually left in 1996. \nBarça’s vice-president Susana Monje, who was giving a financial presentation on Thursday, sent a message of support from the club. \nIn his prime, Cruyff was considered one of the world’s greatest players in the world at a time when Pelé, George Best and Franz Beckenbauer could all lay claim to the title. \nHe was European Footballer of the Year in 1971, 1973 and 1974 and part of the mould-breaking team that won three European Cups in 1971, 1972 and 1973 – a side that provided the foundation for Holland’s Total Football revolution when their coach Rinus Michels took over the national side in 1974. \nCruyff moved to Barcelona in 1973 and won the league title the following year. That same year, 1974, Holland reached the World Cup final where they were defeated by West Germany. \nFour years later Cruyff moved to the United States where he played for the Los Angeles Aztecs and the Washington Diplomats the following year. He finished his career in the Netherlands with two more seasons with Ajax and one with Feyenoord. \nCruyff took over as manager of Ajax in 1985 but it was his return to Barcelona in 1988 that brought him success as a coach, the “Dream Team” winning four league titles, the European Cup and a Copa del Rey and devising the swift passing possession that later became known as tiki-taka. \nSince leaving Barça in 1996 he has had various minor roles in the game and acts as an adviser to Ajax, a spell notable for his successful attempt to block his fellow directors from appointing Louis van Gaal to the board by taking them to court. \nFollow Joy Sports on Twitter: @Joy997FM.
