Pen Argyl and Wilson are both now 1-7. \nGreen Knight sophomore running back Logan Sterner tied a single-game Pen Argyl record by scoring five touchdowns on runs of 5, 6, 46, 73, and 28 yards. \nWilson sophomore quarterback Cameron Clark set a single-game passing record with 349 yards, and his 93-yard TD pass to Job Goodman was the longest in school history. \nTurning point: Wilson had taken a 13-12 lead late in the second quarter after the hosts had led 12-0. On the next Pen Argyl possession, Sterner, on an option pass, found senior wide receiver James Klinger for a 61-yard touchdown pass that put the Green Knights ahead to stay, one of five straight Pen Argyl scores. \nTop performer: Logan Sterner ran for more yards and touchdowns Saturday (263 and 5) than he had all season (201 and 4.). His patient style of running baffled the Warriors. \nWhat it means: Pen Argyl won’t go winless and enters its final two games with a surge of momentum. Wilson did many things well enough to triumph, but must eliminate penalties and self-inflicted wounds to capture such winnable games. \nBrad Wilson may be reached at bwilson@lehighvalleylive.com .
