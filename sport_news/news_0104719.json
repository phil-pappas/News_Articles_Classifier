But nobody has done it better than Andy Dalton and a Cincinnati team that went to 4-0 with a well-rounded 36-21 win over the Kansas City Chiefs. \nJeremy Hill ripped the Chiefs’ defence, running for three TDs. Meantime, K.C.’s line couldn’t keep quarterback Alex Smith from being sacked five times, and harrassed and hurried much of the rest of the time. \n“We knew, with Alex Smith, he kind of panics like any quarterback when he gets pressure in his face,” said tackle Domata Peko, who had a pair of sacks and rubbed his belly in celebration each time. “Alex Smith was on his back a lot today, and that was a key thing.” \nTrue, Smith was able to move the ball — Jamal Charles had more than 100 yards in the first half alone — but the Bengals defence controlled the red zone, holding the Chiefs to seven field goals. \nThat kept the score close — the Chiefs trailed only 14-12 at the half — for much of the game. But Dalton continues to show a more mature, poised game. He was 17-for- 24 for 321 yards and, with the ground game working, he was able to loosen the secondary with deep passes. Five receivers caught passses of 20 yards or longer while Hill and Giovanni Bernard combined for 102 yards on the ground, including four TDs. \n“It’s what we expect from this offence,” Dalton said. “We’ve got everybody back, we’re healthy. We’ve done a great job so far.” \nThe Bengals also are showing something they’ve never done as losers of four consecutive playoff wild card games. They are opportunistic, and with Dalton showing more presence in the pocket, they overcome adversity. \nOn Sunday, they were called four times for penalties on their first possession. Marvin Jones had nobody between him and the end zone ... and dropped a 55-yard pass. Dalton, much improved throwing on the run this season, came right back and, flushed from the pocket, he rifled a ball 50 yards downfield where Brandon Tate made a diving catch, belly-flopped back to his feet, and into the end zone. \nThe Bengals led 21-12. It was lights out for K.C., which has now lost to Peyton Manning, Aaron Rodgers and Dalton the past three weeks. \nMeantime, the Bengals also are getting a rare hug from Lady Luck in going 4-0 for the first time in a decade. That showed on a second key play late in the third quarter. It appeared Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce had an elbow down when he fumbled, yet officials ruled the ball was recovered by Cincinnati. Two plays later, Hill was standing in the end zone, to put the Bengals up 27-15. \nWith Pittsburgh missing quarterback Ben Roethlisberger for the next four to six weeks, Cleveland engulfed in another quarterback controversy and Baltimore struggling, the Bengals suddenly find themselves controlling the division. \nThey are finally looking like a team that can actually win in the playoffs rather than just getting there. \n“We started the season with a special intent, and that’s to be great,” left tackle Andrew Whitworth said. “We’re not satisfied with being good anymore.” \nPILING ON \nSmith is a man on the run. The Chiefs’ QB has been under pressure all season and on Sunday he had Bengals’ defensive end Michael Johnson in his grillwork. Johnson had three QB hits, a sack and a tackle for a loss. \nSmith has now been sacked 19 times this season with the Bengals getting to him five times. Johnson came off the edge to stuff K.C.’s opening drive in the red zone. \nIt would be an omen of the frustration that awaited a Chiefs team which has now drifted to the bottom of the AFC West. \n“We have a good team,” linebacker Derrick Johnson told the team’s official website, “but the roster is not going to win games for us. We have to go back and look in the mirror.” \nSure hope it doesn’t crack. \nWHO NEEDS LUCK? \nThe Colts didn’t get a lot of offence with quarterback Andrew Luck standing on the sideline with a sore shoulder this week. \nFortunately they were playing the Jaguars, who get even less offence, every week. A couple of greybeards hooked up to hand the Jags their weekly dose of disappointment. Matt Hasselbeck, Luck’s 40-year-old backup, keyed a 53- yard drive in overtime. \nThen, Adam Vinatieri, closing in on 43 birthday candles, slipped a 27-yard field goal into the history books for a 16-13 win. Vinatieri became the first player in league history to top 1,000 points with two different teams. He now has 1,001, which also broke Mike Vanderjagt’s franchise scoring mark of 995. \nHELLO, THERE \nMaybe practice does make perfect. Ryan Delaire couldn’t have asked for a better NFL debut. \nThe undrafted rookie linebacker was signed by the Panthers off Washington’s practice squad on Wednesday and celebrated Sunday with two sacks, five tackles, including two for a loss, and two quarterback hits. \nQUICK HITS \nThe Chiefs have surrendered 1,182 passing yards and an NFL-high 15 touchdowns ... Brian Billick, on NFL Gameday, in reference to the Dolphins quitting on coach Joe Philbin: “It’s a common criticism when you’re in a tough spot: ‘Well the players quit on the coach.’ They don’t quit on the coach, they quit on themselves .... Cornerback Josh Norman became the first Carolina player to return a pair of interceptions for TDs in the first four weeks of a season and the first to do it in the league in the past five years...TJ Yeldon had 105 yards on 22 carries.
