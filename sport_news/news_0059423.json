Linden, she had the resources. Using all-natural oils, she created a fragrance that, to her, represented the character of the carefully curated boutique: a concoction heavy with spicy, woodsy palo santo, a relative of frankincense.\nTill heats a sample on a small flame as she mixes oils. The Ironwood scent, which R.L. Linden bottled and sold, was a successful cross-promotion between the two businesses — a bit of olfactory branding, conveying the business's message through what has long been reported as our most powerful sense.\nFragrance branding is often something the customer or guest is only subconsciously aware of. There's a science behind the scents pumped through ventilation systems of Las Vegas hotels , meant to evoke luxury and elicit various impulses. Anyone who has stepped inside a shopping mall with a Cinnabon can attest to the power of the brand's food-based fragrance, said Dawn Stencer Hurwitz, a perfumer and owner of DSH Perfumes in Boulder.\nAdvertisement \"When you interact with smell your subconscious and parts of your brain that are not dealing with your conscious brain before you are even aware of it start processing it,\" said Hurwitz. \"You can infiltrate someone's memory and psyche with olfactory stimulation.\"\nHurwitz now designs fragrances mostly for art studios, as part of exhibits as multi-sensory art, a role she calls \"olfactory artist.\" Most recently, she created fragrances to be paired with Denver Art Museum's \"In Bloom: Painting Flowers in the Age of Impressionism\" exhibit .\nR.L. Linden's success led Till to bottle scents inspired by local artisan businesses. But as far back as 1993, Hurwitz designed fragrances for brands, starting with a high-end furniture maker.\n\"It had to be something that would make you feel very homey and comfortable,\" she said.\nR.L. Linden's initial success opened the door for Till to bottle more scents inspired by others in Denver's artisan business population. The collection has become a sensory tour of seven of the city's makers. Among them: Ritual Chocolate, picking up the scents of cacao nibs, almond shells, cardamom and cognac; florist Beet and Yarrow with a whiff of violets, twigs and green leaves that scatter the cutting room floor; and the unlikely Western Daughter, a butcher that inspired a perfume of freshly mowed hay, sweetgrass and prairie flowers.\nTill and business partner Robin Ting said they chose businesses whose work inspired them, and themed each fragrance around the tools, materials and ambiance of each one.\n\"It doesn't seem like it at first, but when you really try to tease pieces apart, when you look at the pieces people use in their everyday work, there are a ton of smells in that,\" Ting said.\nThe goal was to draw inspiration from creatives they admired, but the fragrance line continues to evolve beyond that, Till said. When it launched, smelling parties held at the retailers' locations were bustling.\n\"People just react to it really directly,\" said Tanya Fleisher, co-owner of Winter Session, a maker of hand-crafted bags and inspiration for another one of R.L. Linden's fragrances. The workshop at 2952 Welton St. is filled with the smells of leather, canvas and coffee, and Fleisher said the workplace culture inspired notes of whiskey and tobacco. Fleisher said the resulting scent gets people talking, trying it on and asking questions.\nNow, more businesses are connecting with R.L. Linden, seeking scents for their brand.\nBen Anderson, owner of Denver-based Icelantic Skis, has enlisted R.L. Linden to create a signature fragrance for his company. They have been working on a scent that elicits memories of that first snow of winter: pine and the woodsy dampness of the forest's decomposing floor, sprinkled with the crisp, dry cold carried in tiny ice crystals in the air.\nAnderson said the fragrance won't sit atop a vanity awaiting a quick spritz in the morning — it will go to work at trade show booths, in boxes of products shipped to retailers around the globe, and with sponsored athletes on the slopes.", "external_links": ["http://lasvegassun.com/news/2010/jan/11/hes-behind-casinos-scent-science/", "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site36/2015/1008/20151008__BN20151011_Z00_BNFE11SCENTS~p3_200.jpg", "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site36/2015/1008/20151008__BN20151011_Z00_BNFE11SCENTS~p2_200.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-08T18:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T19:47:49.941+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
