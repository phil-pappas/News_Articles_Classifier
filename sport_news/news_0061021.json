For me, as long as I can reach your jaw or your head, you're just right.\"\nMansour, 43, and Washington, 33, will headline a Fox Sports 1 telecast from Little Creek Casino Resort in Shelton, Wash., Tuesday at 9 p.m.\nWashington is a 6-6 heavyweight from San Jose, Calif. He will be Mansour's first opponent since Mansour (22-1, 16 KOs) earned a unanimous decision over Philadelphia's Joey Dawejko in August at 2300 Arena to capture the Pennsylvania state heavyweight championship.\nWashington weighs 250 pounds and has Mansour by 50 pounds. This is his first national TV appearance.\n\"This is my time to make a statement,\" Washington said. \"I will make an example of Amir Mansour to let the heavyweight division know that there's a new sheriff in town. No more Mr. Nice Guy. It's time for me to bring the pain.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T00:19:47.314+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
