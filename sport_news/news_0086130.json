Here are more of some of the most fun and interesting things that happened in sports this past weekend. The Indianapolis Colts' trick play now has a video game tribute \nIf you weren't watching live on Sunday night on NBC, you've probably seen it by now anyway: the Colts' \"creative\" fake punt play that ended up in misery. Here's the link to it , if you've missed out. \nIt's gotten so popular that Sports Illustrated's \"The Cauldron\" created a Tecmo Bowl tribute, and if you played that growing up like I did, well, it's a must watch: \nGo virtual Chuck Pagano! This kid broke a window with his hockey shot \nSpeaking of things I did growing up, driveway hockey was definitely one of them. We had makeshift goals and alternated between using a puck and a ball, because we could never decide which was better suited for concrete. \nBut my parents had one rule: Leave the garage door up when playing hockey. Who knows what could happen otherwise? \nWell, this is what they had in mind. The kid's reaction is adorable, though: John Wall skips preseason game for something more important \nJohn Wall, star point guard for the Washington Wizards, is a good man. Wall missed the Wizards' preseason game Saturday night in order to attend the \"Light the Night Walk,\" a fundraiser for blood cancer research. \nHe did this in memorial of Miyah, a 5-year-old girl he befriended last year. She died last December, leaving Wall to give this emotional postgame interview that's pretty incredible: \nWall, despite what radio host Colin Cowherd will tell you, is an incredible human. Credit to him, and the Wizards, for putting lives over basketball.
