(Alex D'Addese/CIS) Related Stories Melissa Bishop, 800m world silver medallist, reveals power of adrenaline \nCanada's university sports system is becoming more appealing to athletes who might otherwise consider enrolling in American colleges and universities, according to some of Canada's top track and field athletes. The new CEO of CIS, Canadian Interuniversity Sport, wants to make it even more so. \n\"When I was looking for schools, I was fully intending on going to the States,\" said Melissa Bishop, currently one of Canada's shining stars on the track. \"It's a full ride. It's hard to turn that down.\" \nInstead, Bishop enrolled at the University of Windsor and trained with the Windsor Lancers. She graduated in 2011 and continued a post-collegiate running career with her university coach. This summer, she won gold in the 800 metres at the Pan Am Games, and silver at the world track and field championships in Beijing. \n\"Certainly the stigma [of not going to the States] has changed from when I was in school to now,\" Bishop told CBC Sports. \"I don't think they are any differences in terms of preparation. At all. \n\"The CIS is such a strong force, especially in track and field,\" she said. \"It's getting stronger and stronger.\" \nThat should be good news to Graham Brown, who started as CIS CEO just one month ago. \n\"I would like the CIS to become higher profile, to become an avenue that athletes actually consider before they choose to perhaps go to the NCAA,\" said Brown this week. \n\"I want it to be more relevant.\" Fight against notion of \"full-ride scholarship\" \nTo gain that relevancy, there are a few hurdles the CIS must tackle, including the popular impression of the American \"full-ride scholarship.\" \nWhen Canadian academic bursaries are compared to American scholarships they seem disproportionate in amount, but only because Canadian tuition fees are much lower, Brown said. \n\"A lot of our athletes – and this is maybe my opinion, but it's a fairly educated one – do not always go to the U.S. because of a scholarship,\" said Brown. \n\"There are a lot of student athletes who go to division two and three programs or who take half and partial scholarships that aren't guaranteed to division one programs.\" \nWhen taking partial scholarships, Canadian athletes are actually paying more or just as much as if they were going to school in Canada. \nBrown said by making Canadian schools higher profile options, \"that whole allure of the so-called NCAA scholarship may in fact diminish.\" \nThat wasn't the case for Matthew Hughes, who competed in steeplechase at Kentucky's University of Louisville, although he also struggled to pin down major differences between Canadian and American schools. \n\"I come from a big family of seven kids, so for me accepting a full ride to a college in the states was big,\" said Hughes, gold medallist at the Pan Am Games. \nBut money isn't everything. \n\"Often times kids will ask me whether to go a NCAA school or stay in the CIS, and for me it's a lot about the coach rather than the actual university,\" he said. \n\"Just explore all options.\" Athlete profiles to up CIS relevance \nOne option Brown is considering to make Canadian school among those options is highlighting Canadian talent. \n\"Obviously university sports is very athlete-focused,\" said Brown when asked how to capitalize on success stories like Bishop. \"The volume of promotional material [students] see from U.S. colleges is significant. Maybe the fact is [students'] decisions are distorted because we don't do a very good job.\" \n\"We will do a better job of profiling our athletes.\" \nBishop agrees that success stories can only help. \n\"You see athletes, like myself, who came through the CIS system doing well and really putting their mark on the world,\" said Bishop. \n\"Back in high school, I would certainly be considering a Canadian school much more than I was three years ago.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T20:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T20:59:35.443+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
