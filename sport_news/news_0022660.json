It’s usually a success when he targets his favorite weapon. Ball completed 4 of 5 passes for 52 yards and two touchdowns in Exeter’s 37-14 Division I victory over Dover (1-6) at William Ball Stadium on Friday night. All of Ball’s completions went to senior tight end Hunter Long in the win. “I always trust Hunter is going to come down with it,” Ball said. “When we have our run game going, we have a threat through the air. We just pound it in the middle and nobody knows exactly what is coming at them.” Exeter (7-0) held a 6-0 lead when the duo hooked up on a 13-yard completion down to Dover’s 20-yard line. On third-and-2 from the 10, Ball found Long for five yards that helped set up Evan Royer’s 22-yard field goal that gave the Blue Hawks a 9-0 lead with 3:22 left in the first quarter. The Blue Hawks ran the ball eight straight times on their next drive and were faced with a fourth-and-3 from the Green Wave 8. Ball rolled out to the right and found Long in the corner of the end zone to give Exeter a 16-0 lead with 5:19 left in the second quarter. “They’ve been good for us all year and they continue to get better every week, so it’s nice to have that,” Exeter coach Bill Ball said. “They work real hard at it. It’s good to be more multi-dimensional for sure.” Exeter’s two-minute drill at the end of the second quarter ended when Kyle Ball found a streaking Long down the middle for a 26-yard scoring pass — the big tight end diving to secure the pass and landing in the end zone. The big play gave the Blue Hawks a 23-0 lead entering halftime. “I don’t have many opportunities to catch the ball much in this offense,” Long said. “I trust that he’s going to get the ball to me and he trusts that I’m going to get open. On the second touchdown, he threw it trusting that I was going to get there and that’s all that you need.” Long now has 17 receptions for 266 yards and four touchdowns — all from Ball — on the season. His quarterback is now 25 for 49 (51 percent) for 440 yards and six touchdowns, also connecting with back Mason Wallace twice for scores. Regrouping time for Devils TILTON — The most important thing Epping-Newmarket football coach Justin Leonard wanted his team to realize following Saturday’s 53-0 loss to Winnisquam is that there is still time to achieve a goal. Epping-Newmarket (2-4) was overmatched against the undefeated Bears (6-0) from the start, as five first-half turnovers helped feed into seven Winnisquam touchdowns. The Blue Devils are still alive for the fourth and final playoff spot in the Division III South with two games left in the regular season. They're battling defending champion Campbell (2-4) and Saturday’s opponent, Somersworth (3-3), for the berth. “Mentally, we let it snowball and now we’ve just got to move on and get ready for Somersworth,” Leonard said. “We’re going to come back on Monday, prepare for Somersworth and hopefully fix our errors.” The Blue Devils were coming off a 19-14 victory over Campbell two weeks ago, but they quickly realized the uphill climb they had on Saturday when Christian Serrano’s 44-yard touchdown pass to Tim Harmon sparked a 26-point first quarter for the Bears. Epping-Newmarket gained only 49 yards and was held to four first downs, and now must move on. After Saturday’s home game against the Hilltoppers, the Blue Devils host Farmington-Nute (1-5). “We’re still in a great position for a (No. 4) seed,” Leonard said. “The mental preparation is something we can work on. They seemed a little lackadaisical from the start, but that’s on me. That’s something we’re going to fix this week.” By Dan Doyon", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T20:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T03:15:57.092+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
