Oklahoma set the tone early, taking only 1:04 to score on its opening drive on a 22-yard pass from Mayfield to Sterling Shepard.\nThe Sooners took a 35-0 lead into halftime as Mayfield threw for all five of his TDs in the first half, including two to Shepard. He finished 20 of 27 for 282 yards.\nOklahoma kept rolling to open the second half. The Wildcats had benched Joe Hubener in favor of Kody Cook, who played most of the first half at wide receiver, and Cook promptly threw an interception that Zack Sanchez returned 38 yards for a touchdown that made the score 42-0.\nThe Sooners tacked on two more field goals in the third quarter, and five minutes into the fourth quarter Joe Mixon scored the first rushing touchdown of the day for Oklahoma, stretching the team's lead to 55-0.\nMixon finished with 73 yards on 15 carries to lead a Sooners rushing attack that rolled up 232 yards. Mixon also caught three passes for 29 yards, including a 10-yard touchdown catch in the first quarter.\nGoing into Saturday's game, Kansas State had scored in 234 straight games. The loss to Oklahoma marked the first time the Wildcats have been shut out at home since 1991.\nFull coverage: Predictions, analysis and more\nCLICK HERE TO VISIT THE OKLAHOMA SOONERS PAGE\nCarlton: Big 12 first half review - top defense, top low-key team, player\nOklahoma prediction: Sooners' fate directly tied to stopping Kansas State run, running the ball themselves\nSherrington: Bob Stoops has clearly plateaued at Oklahoma; Charlie Strong is safe at UT\nBig 12 power rankings (10/14): Texas, Texas Tech move up\nFive things Oklahoma Sooners fans should know about Kansas State, including Wildcats' option-heavy offense\nWhy loss to Longhorns doesn't hurt Sooners playoffs hopes\nOklahoma quotable: Bob Stoops on where responsibilities lie between coaches, players after upset loss to Texas Longhorns\nOn Twitter:\n @SportsDayDFW", "external_links": ["http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/10/12/loss-longhorns-hurt-sooners-playoffs-hopes", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/oklahoma-sooners", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/10/14/sherrington-bob-stoops-clearly-plateaued-oklahoma-charlie-strong-safe-ut", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/10/16/carlton-big-12-first-half-review-top-defense-top-low-key-team-player", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/10/15/oklahoma-prediction-sooners-fate-directly-tied-stopping-kansas-state-run-running-ball", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/10/13/big-12-power-rankings-1014-baylor-takes-top-spot-middle-conference-remains-unpredictable", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/10/12/oklahoma-quotable-bob-stoops-responsibilities-lie-coaches-players-upset-loss-texas-longhorns", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/chats/2015/10/17/chuck-carlton-answers-big-12-questions-2-pm-thursday-oct-22-ask-now", "https://twitter.com/SportsDayDFW", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/10/17/five-thoughts-losing-longhorns-sooners-take-frustrations-kansas-state-55-0-win", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/10/13/five-things-oklahoma-sooners-fans-know-kansas-state-including-wildcats-option-heavy-offense"], "published": "2015-10-15T21:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T06:12:56.550+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
