Bergner Jr. The Daily Courier FLAGSTAFF, Ariz. - Three interceptions, two fumbles and a muffed punt summed up Prescott's effort offensively against rival Flagstaff in a 36-6 upset loss under the friendly confines of the NAU Walkup Skydome on Friday night.Prescott head coach Cody Collett had very little to say on his team's performance.\"This loss is on me,\" he said during a postgame radio interview, adding that his squad would just get back to work next week and \"see what happens.\"Down 22-0, Prescott tailback Christian Setter's 42-yard touchdown run on a sweep play with 4:31 to play in the third quarter was the only scoring play of the night for the Badgers.Setter had only seven carries for 39 yards in the first half. In Prescott's first six possessions of the game, the box score would read: PUNT. INT. PUNT. INT. PUNT. FUMBLE.Flagstaff junior Austin Rhoda began the game's scoring with a 5-yard touchdown run at the 5:09 mark in the first quarter, and after a two-point conversion it was 8-0.After the Eagles recovered a surprise onside kick, Prescott linebacker Kyle Peach bailed out the Badgers with his sixth interception of the season as Flagstaff was threatening to score inside Prescott's own 15-yardline. Later in the second quarter, the Badger defense forced their second fumble of the night and recovered, but quarterback Ryan Greene would give it right back to the Eagles on his first of three interceptions on the night. Greene had his Badgers inside Flagstaff's own 10-yardline but Rhoda stepped in for the pick.The barrage of turnovers between both teams would continue as Flagstaff quarterback Christian Singleton made a bad pitch to his halfback on an option play and Peach would recover to make it 1st-and-10 on Prescott's own 13-yardline.After the Badgers failed to score, Singleton would find Bridger Hershey on a 25-yard touchdown throw to give the Eagles a 16-0 lead with 33 seconds left in the first half.On the ensuing possession, Green threw his second interception of the night with 14 seconds left in the first half and Flagstaff would take a knee to head into the locker room.In the second half, Singleton scored a touchdown on a 25-yard scramble, which was set up after the Eagles blocked a Derek Knotek punt on Prescott's first possession of the half. The score gave Flagstaff a 22-0 lead at the 9:42 mark in the third quarter.Adding to the Badgers' frustration, Edgar Aguilera forced a Rhoda fumble and recovered it with 7:27 remaining in the third quarter, but the referees would blow the whistle and call the runner down by contact.With under 2 minutes to go in the fourth quarter, Singleton found Nick Christopher on a 4th-and-goal play for a 2-yard touchdown, making it 30-6 Eagles.And if that wasn't enough, Flagstaff's Mitch Thompson would intercept Greene in the final minute of play and take it to the house for a touchdown to seal the deal, 36-6.Next up, the Badgers will host cross-town rival Bradshaw Mountain on Friday, Sept. 23. The annual \"Black and Blue\" game sports two teams with 6-2 records after the Bears beat Coconino 56-22 on Friday night.Kickoff is set for 7 p.m.Follow Brian M.
