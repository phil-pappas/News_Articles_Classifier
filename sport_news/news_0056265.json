FAU (1-5) is trying to halt a two-game losing streak, falling to Rice and Marshall in consecutive weeks. Texas at El Paso (2-4) is playing its second consecutive game against a Conference USA opponent from South Florida, losing 52-12 at Florida International two weeks ago.\nAbout FAU: All signs are pointing toward quarterback Jaquez Johnson returning to the starting lineup. He sat last week after aggravating an ankle injury that has bothered him since the second game of the season. Despite Buddy Howell being the leading rusher, expect freshman Trey Rodriguez to factor heavily into the running game. Freshman defensive back Ocie Rose ranks 18th nationally with three interceptions.\nAbout UTEP: Injuries have made this a nightmare season for the Miners. Ten players have already suffered season-ending injuries while nine others have missed games. The injuries have forced 27 first-year players to see significant playing time. Quarterback Mack Leftwich is back as the starter after losing the spot for a few games to freshman Ryan Metz.\nWhat to watch :\n1. For the third straight week, the Owls are dealing with questions about health at quarterback. All season Johnson has said he's fine, but the training staff has thought otherwise. If he's fully healed, the Owls can utilize a completely different playbook. Nothing against backup Jason Driskel, but FAU is much better in the red zone with Johnson under center because his ability as a runner.\n2. How will the FAU defense handle the possibility of facing two different quarterbacks? Leftwich is the starter, but Metz could also see time. The Owls had to at least prepare for both, making the practice week a bit more difficult.\n3. If the Owls can't score this week, there is a serious problem. UTEP is allowing 43 points a game and its only Division I-A victory came against winless New Mexico State. FAU should put up its best offensive outing since the season-opener at Tulsa.\n College Football Florida Atlantic Owls Texas-El Paso Miners Conference USA Rice Owls Tulsa Golden Hurricane Sun Bowl", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-562ab8e3/turbine/fl-fau-owls-preview-notes-1024-20151023"], "published": "2015-10-24T00:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T07:48:13.301+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
