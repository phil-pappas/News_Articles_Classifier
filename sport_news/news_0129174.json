(AP) - The drought in Mississippi is letting some bow hunters boost their chances by setting up stands near the few oaks which have dropped acorns, providing food for deer. But hunters who have planted food plots are getting little more than dirt.\nKyle Sandidge of Clinton tells The Clarion-Ledger ( http://on.thec-l.com/1LYabA0 ) that only a few of his white oaks are dropping acorns, giving deer few places to browse. He says he's been using trail cameras to watch bucks on his land, knew where the biggest was bedding and eating, and shot that buck on Oct. 7.\nState wildlife bureau official Chris McDonald says ( http://on.thec-l.com/1LY9XZA ) deer will need food plots this winter. But he says people should wait to plant until there's been a substantial amount of rain.\nInformation from: The Clarion-Ledger, http://www.clarionledger.com\nCopyright redistributed.", "external_links": ["http://on.thec-l.com/1LYabA0", "http://on.thec-l.com/1LY9XZA"], "published": "2015-10-19T01:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T04:18:08.665+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
