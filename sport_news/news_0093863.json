These past few days have been no different,\" JaNean Mercer, Odom's aunt, added Monday in a statement. \"He is defying the odds in his toughest battle to date with God's grace. Each day Lamar is getting stronger and reaching significant milestones in his recovery. We are committed to remaining by his side as a family for our champion, who we love immensely.\"Kim Kardashian, who has known Odom since he married her sister in 2009, added more information about Odom's condition via social media, sharing a picture with the athlete and writing, \"I have faith in you.\"\"I believe in the power of prayer and positive energy! Thank you all for your prayers! Lammy- I'm so happy Kendall & I could make you smile today! God is good!\" she added.Kardashian has been photographed visiting the two-time NBA champion.Odom, 35, had been unconscious since being found at the Love Ranch in Crystal, Nevada, Tuesday. The owner of the ranch told ABC News he had been staying there since the Saturday before.When rescuers arrived at the Love Ranch, Odom was \"unconscious but breathing,\" Nye County Sheriff Sharon Wehrly told reporters last week.Police also said that a worker at the legal brothel claimed to 911 dispatchers that the former basketball player had been using cocaine and sexual enhancement drugs in the days before the incident.After the incident, Odom first received treatment at Pahrump's Desert View Hospital, then was transferred to Sunrise Hospital, where the Rev. Jesse Jackson said earlier in the week, his estranged wife, Khloe Kardashian, has been by his side.Khloe Kardashian married Odom in 2009, but filed for divorce four years later. Both parties signed the divorce papers earlier this year.Khloe's only post about the incident thus far was a statement on her website that read, \"As a family we've decided to hold off on publishing content across our apps while we continue to support and pray for Lamar. Thank you for your kindness and understanding during this difficult time.\" Copyright   Monday, October 19, 2015 at 12:42PM", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T19:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T22:19:36.571+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
