By Brett Miller \nCleveland 27, Nathan Hale 21 \nCleveland recovered Nathan Hale’s onside kick attempt with under 20 seconds remaining to hold off Nathan Hale’s best comeback attempt. Will Sanders scored his third touchdown of the game late in the fourth quarter to get the Raiders within six points, but they had simply dug themselves into too deep of a hole. Cleveland’s touchdown to make it 27-14 with under three minutes in the game was simply too much to overcome with so little time on the clock. \nThomas Jefferson 22, Decatur 3 \nThomas Jefferson was carried to their fourth SPSL Northwest League championship, and first since 1980, by the legs of Kenny Turner, who finished with 224 rushing yards, two rushing touchdowns, and a passing touchdown. Though the offense struggled to find the end zone for much of the game, Thomas Jefferson’s smothering defense–which has not allowed a touchdown in three games–put the pressure squarely on the Decatur offense to stay in the game. The Raiders’ defense was led by Tyson Sonnenfield’s three interceptions.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T08:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T08:56:31.655+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
