The Gamecocks were 2-4 overall and 0-4 in the Southeastern Conference for the first time in Spurrier's career. \nHe had never had a losing season in 25 previous seasons coach at Duke (1987-89), Florida (1990-2001) or South Carolina, where he has been since 2005. \n___", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T19:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T19:29:56.388+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
