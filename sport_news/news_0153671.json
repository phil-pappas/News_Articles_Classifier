That's one fewer match for each session, and after watching the Americans pour in 22 birdies, it was hard not to imagine the lead being even larger with an extra match. \nLouis Oosthuizen and Branden Grace of South Africa provided the lone point for the International team with a 3-and-2 win over Matt Kuchar and Patrick Reed . It was the first win for Grace, who went 0-4 two years ago at Muirfield Village in Ohio. \n\"I know we're behind,\" Grace said. \"But one point is better than none.\" \nSo dominant were the Americans that they had a lead after the second hole of every match, and they only trailed in the one match they didn't win. \nRickie Fowler and Jimmy Walker , who halved all three of their team matches at the Ryder Cup last year, delivered the first point with the shortest match of the day, 5 and 4, over Anirban Lahiri of India and Thongchai Jaidee of Thailand. \nJordan Spieth , the No. 1 player in the world, and Dustin Johnson proved as formidable as advertised in a 4-and-3 win over New Zealand's Danny Lee and Australia's Marc Leishman . The tone was set early when Spieth holed a 20-foot birdie putt on No. 2 and Johnson walked to the next tee and unleashed a 349-yard drive. \n\"That's the whole point,\" Johnson said. \"Me hitting bomb drives, Jordan holing putts. That's what you want to get in their heads.\" \nPerhaps the most pivotal match was the first one. Bubba Watson and J.B. Holmes , two of the longest hitters in golf, never trailed after a birdie on the second hole, though it was tight on the back nine against Australia's Adam Scott and Japan's Hideki Matsuyama . \nBy then, the Americans were ahead in three other matches, and the International team could have used a win to at least keep it close. The Americans were 1 up when Scott missed a putt to win the hole, and the U.S. pulled ahead 2 up when Matsuyama left a downhill birdie attempt short and Holmes rolled in an 8-foot birdie on No. 15. Holmes rolled in a birdie on the 16th from about 15 feet to close out a 3-and-2 win. \nDay tried to give the International side at least a little momentum going into Friday. Day and Bowditch were 2 down to Mickelson and Zach Johnson with two holes to play when Day poured in a 40-foot birdie putt to send the match to the 18th. \nBowditch hit a long iron to about 18 feet for an eagle chance, and Day narrowly missed the putt. Johnson only had a 7-iron to the green, which he hit to 10 feet, and that eagle putt was conceded. \n\"I hit 7-iron a lot into par 5s,\" the short-hitting Johnson said. \"But it's my third shot.\" \nU.S. captain Jay Haas referred to Mickelson's tee shot as a \"statement,\" and perhaps dispelled any doubts why he was a captain's picks. \n\"It was a great start for us,\" Haas said. \"But I think they all realize it's a long series right now -- kind of like shooting a low round in the first round of a tournament. There's a lot of golf to be played, so I don't think anybody's getting too giddy.\" \nFor the five matches of fourballs on Friday, Haas will send Spieth and Dustin Johnson out in the first game against Oosthuizen and Grace, followed by Fowler and Walker against Lee and Sangmoon Bae. \n\"He's going for the kill,\" Price said. \"He wants to shut this down fast. If we get momentum going, it can change things.\" MORE NEWS: Want stories delivered to you?
