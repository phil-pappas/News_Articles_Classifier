Contenders eyeing Charlotte win 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Concord, N.C.\nExpect the intensity to pick up a tick in the opening race of the second round of NASCAR 's playoffs. The event at Charlotte Motor Speedway ended last year with mild-mannered Matt Kenseth jumping Brad Keselowski , who had already drawn the ire of Denny Hamlin .\nWhy will drivers be more amped than usual Saturday night? Because a win will earn a championship contender an automatic berth into the third round and relieve the pressure for ominous races at Kansas and Talladega.\n\"I think if you can win in a first-round situation, you can definitely put yourself in a position to get those guys on the team that mental break that they're going to need just because of the detail and things that it takes on a weekly basis when you have to run all three weeks at that level,\" reigning Sprint Cup champion Kevin Harvick said.\nMore Information\nNASCAR Sprint Cup\nBank of America 500\nWhen: 7:15 p.m. Saturday\nTV/Radio: NBC-13, WSDE 1190 AM, 94.3 FM\nHarvick had a grueling first round of the Chase for the Sprint Cup championship, which began when he crashed after contact with Jimmie Johnson in the first race. It dropped him to last in the Chase field and pushed him into a must-win situation to keep his title defense alive.\nBut an almost-certain victory the next week at New Hampshire slipped away when he ran out of gas in the closing laps, and it was make-or-break Sunday at Dover. He got the win he needed to advance into the second round, but it was a draining stretch for Harvick and his Stewart-Haas Racing team.\n\"When you get in those types of situations, when you see everybody overachieve in every department of the car, because they're just so focused on all the little things, and when you start taking those crumbs and you start adding them up ... you can't race like this all year because it's just so draining and so hard on everybody,\" Harvick said.\nHe won at Charlotte last October to coast into the third round of the Chase. It's a critical victory to get because Kansas has proven over the years to ruin many title hopes, and Talladega is the crapshoot of the Chase.\nKyle Busch for years struggled at Kansas to cripple his championship chances, and tire issues last season dumped Keselowski and Dale Earnhardt Jr. to the back of the standings. Keselowski pulled out the must-win at Talladega, but Earnhardt was eliminated.", "external_links": ["http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/34/42/8767675/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/34/42/8767675/3/920x920.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-10T06:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T08:18:49.814+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
