He is the player who takes the most pressure off of quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick, who historically is prone to turnovers if relied upon to throw too many passes, win the game with his arm.\nOffensively, the Jets know they must win this game riding Ivory’s legs, not Fitzpatrick’s arm.\nAnd so do the Patriots.\nIt’s no coincidence the only game the Jets have lost this season, to the Eagles, came when Ivory was out with a leg injury.\nFor all of his Hall of Fame credentials as a coach, highlighted by his four Super Bowl titles, Bill Belichick’s genius from game-to-game actually is quite simple: Eliminate the opponent’s greatest strength and, more often than not, win the game.\nThat formula has made the Patriots coach more successful than any coach of this generation.\nSo Belichick’s plan is simple: Eliminate Ivory and win the game.\nHerein lies the problem for the Patriots: Their run defense has been a weakness, allowing a gaudy 4.8 yards per carry.\n“This is going to be a great test,’’ Patriots defensive tackle Alan Branch said Thursday. “Ivory is the engine that jump-starts their offense. He’s the leading rusher in the league. It’s hard to beat a team when they’re running the ball well and it’s showing with the Jets — they’re playing well because they’re running the ball with [Ivory].’’\nAddressing the Patriots’ porous run defense, Branch made no excuses.\n“We are what we are, and right now we are the defense that’s giving up 4.8 (yards per carry),’’ he said. “But we feel like we’re better than that. We know it’s coming at us. It’s going to be a fun game for me, knowing that I like to stop the run and they’re a running team. It’s going to be fun to see what happens.’’\n“Fun’’ will be in the eye of the beholder. Because if Ivory is knocking Patriots’ defenders down like bowling pins the way he has against the rest of the league this season, it’s not likely to be very fun for anyone on the defensive side of the ball for New England.\n“He runs angry,’’ linebacker Jonathan Freeny said. “He’s an explosive back with quickness. We’ve just got to do a great job of getting people to him and rallying to the ball. We’ve got to get a lot of bodies on him to get him to the ground. He’s constantly running out of arm tackles.’’\nAsked what he sees on film, veteran safety Devin McCourty said: “A guy that doesn’t want to go down.’’\n“He’s probably running and playing as good as any running back in the NFL right now,’’ McCourty said. “There are times when three guys hit him at one time and he’s trying to get them off him with one arm while getting his shoulders back to square to keep running.\n“One of the things that sticks out is his speed. When he’s able to hit the sideline and go he’s run past quite a bit of people this year for big gains.’’\nDefensive tackle Sealver Siliga called Ivory “similar to Marshawn [Lynch of Seattle] in what type of attitude he has when he’s running the ball.\n“I faced him last year and this year it seems like he has a lot more bounce in his step; he looks quick, he reads the holes very well and he’s patient.”\n“It’s going well and they keep feeding him,’’ Belichick said. “He’s a guy who gets stronger as the game goes on. He’s probably had more production in the second half than he’s had in the first. He runs hard all of the time. He’s hard to tackle in the first quarter. He’s hard to tackle in the fourth quarter.\n“He’s got good vision, good power, good speed and he catches the ball. Tough guy to stop.’’\nThus all the film work this week.\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google Whatsapp Email Filed under chris ivory ,  new england patriots ,  new york jets", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T02:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T07:01:52.420+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
