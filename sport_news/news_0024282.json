Last April, the Canadian Taxpayers Federal took aim at the governing Conservatives over $13.5 million spent on advertising that Ottawa said was to promote public awareness of government programs. The Federation said the ads were torqued for partisan gain and a waste of public money; another group, Democracy Watch, called on the federal auditor general to investigate.\nThe ones who’d owe the most\nThe dispute is currently the subject of a court case.\n<bullet>Party leader’s office: $408,573 (under both current leader Tom Mulcair and former interim leader Nycole Turmel)\n<bullet>Party house leader’s office (House Leader at dissolution was Peter Julian, MP for Burnaby-New Westminsiter), $189,714\n<bullet>Isabelle Morin, (Dorval-Lachine-LaSalle), $169,117\n<bullet>Alexandre Boulerice, (Rosemont—La Petite-Patrie) $122,122\n<bullet>Jean Rousseau, (Compton-Stanstead) $142,548\n<bullet>Dan Harris, (Scarborough Southwest) $141,467\nIn the matter of the NDP MPs expenses, as of July 1, Commons administrators were under instructions to begin collecting the money by refusing to reimburse the expense claims of the 68 MPs involved in the satellite office matter.\nThe amount recovered thus far would be trivial, since Parliament was not sitting in July and no expenses could be claimed in any event after the election was called on Aug. 2.\nHowever, if any of those MPs are defeated on Monday, they could find their final pay-outs from the Commons — severance and reimbursement of pension contributions — docked for the full amount of what they still owe.\nEvery defeated MP receives a lump-sum severance payment of half a year’s salary — $83,700.\nAnd those who’ve been MPs for fewer than six years also receive lump sum reimbursement of their pension contributions, which would amount to roughly another half year’s salary.\nFour NDP incumbents could wind up losing most or all their final payments, should they be defeated.\nThe party leader’s office also owes $408,573 (racked up under both current leader Tom Mulcair and former interim leader Nycole Turmel) and the party House leader’s office owes $189,714.\nThe NDP launched a court challenge a year ago after the board ordered reimbursement of the $2.7 million, as well as another $1.2 million for improper use of parliamentary mailing privileges. Most of the latter was supposedly owed to Canada Post, which has made no known move to collect.\nThe court case has languished ever since, with no attempt by the NDP or the board of internal economy to move it along. There was a brief attempt to negotiate a settlement which went nowhere.\nThe board will be reconstituted after the election and the new membership could decide to let the matter drop. However, both the Liberals and Conservatives have argued it’s a matter of principle to ensure that taxpayer-funded resources are used to help MPs carry out their parliamentary duties, not to advance their political parties.\nMore on thestar.com\nThe Star’s election home page\nHow Canada's 42nd federal election all adds up\nOusted trustees offer explanations for not filing expenses\nMore on thestar.com\nCameron's EU wish-list due in November\nWhy volatility in Quebec is good news for Gilles Duceppe", "external_links": ["http://static.freeskreen.com/publisher/52/freeskreen.min.js"], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T16:45:00.902+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
