Now they’re up by three scores. We are running the football well tonight. Let’s continue to feed [Demarea Crockett]. Once we got a couple stops, we felt confident in our game.” \nThe game seemed to favor the Greenbrier for much of the game, with the Panthers leading by three touchdowns midway through the third quarter. \nHowever, the Warriors never gave up, scoring 22 unanswered points. The final touchdown was scored on a 2-yard rushing touchdown by Crockett, a Boise State recruit who also ran for the decisive two-point conversion. \nWeaver said the two-point conversion was never a question. He said they felt they had a great chance to win and they took it. \nBoth teams traded scores through the first quarter and half of the second before Greenbrier pulled away after forcing a turnover on downs. \nPanther running back Spencer Sutterfield ran for a 27-yard touchdown, giving Greenbrier a 28-21 lead with 3:03 left in the second quarter. \nThe Panther defense forced Crockett to fumble at the Greenbrier 45. \nThe Panthers put together a five-play, 45-yard drive, which was capped off by a 1-yard touchdown run by quarterback Harold Ross, giving the Panthers a 35-21 lead at the half. \nLRC drove down to the Panthers’ 15 on its opening possession of the third quarter. \nHill threw a pass to the right side of the end zone, but it was intercepted by Greenbrier cornerback Sam McNabb, who McNabb returned the interception 73 yards to the Warrior 27. \nThree plays later, the Panthers scored on a 15-yard pass from Ross to Alex Massey in the back corner of the end zone, bringing the score to 42-21 after an extra point. \nThe Warriors then scored on Carlos Stewart’s third rushing touchdown of the night, bringing the score to 42-28 with 55 seconds left in the third quarter. LRC continued to battle back after stopping Greenbrier on its next possession, scoring on a 31-yard touchdown pass from Hill to wide receiver Austin Guymon, bringing the score to 42-35 with 5:13 left. \nThe lead dwindled and the Panthers suffered their first loss in 5A competition. \n“They just put drives together and we faltered somehow offensively,” Greenbrier coach Randy Tribble said. “They’ve got a big, powerful offense and it was a good football game.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T04:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T09:25:07.161+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
