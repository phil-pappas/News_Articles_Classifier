(AP Photo/Nick Ut) \nANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) — Billy Eppler is unafraid to take on an apparently perilous job as the Los Angeles Angels’ general manager alongside demanding owner Arte Moreno and powerful manager Mike Scioscia. \nEppler says that’s because he knows all about sky-high expectations in demanding organizations after 11 years with the New York Yankees. \nThe Angels introduced Eppler as their 12th general manager on Monday, a day after their season ended. The big-budget club missed the postseason for the fifth time in six years. \nEppler was the other finalist for this job four years ago, when Moreno hired Jerry Dipoto instead. Dipoto abruptly quit on the Angels at midseason after repeatedly jousting with Scioscia. \nScioscia confirmed he’ll return for his 17th season next year, and Eppler says he’s eager to work together.
