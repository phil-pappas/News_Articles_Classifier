The university announced on Sunday that Golden had been \"relieved\" of his duties.\nGolden's firing came a day after the Hurricanes suffered the worst loss in the program's history â€“ a 58-0 beating by Clemson in an Atlantic Coast Conference home game. The loss left Miami with a 4-3 overall record and a 1-2 conference mark.\n\"Coach Golden has led our program through some very difficult times, and he has done so with class, integrity and a true desire to see our students succeed on the field, in the classroom and in the community,\" said Blake James , the school's athletic director. \"However, we have a proud tradition of excellence at Miami, not just in football but in all sports, and we want to compete for ACC and national championships. I simply believe that now is the time to bring the Hurricane family together and rally behind our young men.\"\nJames announced assistant coach Larry Scott would serve as the interim coach for the remainder of the season. Scott has been the tight ends coach for the past three seasons.\nIn his fifth season at Miami, Golden had a 32-25 record after taking over a program under NCAA investigation. The Hurricanes won the ACC's Coastal Division in 2012, but didn't play in the league title game because of a self-imposed postseason ban. Miami played in the Russell Athletic Bowl after the 2013 season and the Independence Bowl after the 2014 season.\n\"On behalf of my family, I want to thank the University of Miami for a tremendous opportunity,\" Golden said in a release from the university. \"I believe in what we are doing and how we are doing it, and we have some outstanding young men in our football program. Though this moment is difficult, we wish the Canes the best of luck going forward.\"\nMiami visits Duke on Saturday.", "external_links": ["http://www.hurricanesports.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=28700&ATCLID=210450744"], "published": "2015-10-26T06:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T08:04:01.685+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
