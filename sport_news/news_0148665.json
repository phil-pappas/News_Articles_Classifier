Trending up \nMarken Michel: Lost in all the Tajae Sharpe hype is that Michel is having his most productive season as a Minuteman. The senior wideout caught a pair of touchdowns, including a 5-yard fade that put UMass out of range of FIU midway through the fourth quarter. \nLogan Laurent: Back-to-back mentions here for Laurent, which makes sense given that he's now playing two positions for the Minutemen. He punted only twice, averaging 47.5 yards, but it was his 48-yard field goal at the end of the first half that drew the loudest McGuirk Stadium cheer of the day. \nDefensive line: The grunts down in the trenches stepped up in a huge way. More than that, it was who along the defensive line that was getting snaps. Sha-Ki Holines and Robert Kitching were out, meaning Peter Angeh, Trey Seals Enock Asante & Co. had to work over time. Gutty performance by them and a good job by the coaching staff to have the unit prepared. Trending down \nPass protection: Blake Frohnapfel looked shaky and uncomfortable on several occasions, thanks largely to an FIU pass rush that had him jumpy in the pocket and scrambling far more often than UMass wants. \nMarquis Young: So Mark Whipple didn't listen to my pleas to unleash the freshman running back. Instead, Young carried the ball just five times for 13 yards. Meanwhile, Lorenzo Woodley got seven carries. Who knows how this backfield is going to shake out each week? \nTight end production: Rod Mills missed his second straight game, meaning Frohnapfel's options at tight end were severely limited. A.J. Doyle played significant snaps with both Brandon Howard and Sharif Custis also held out. Jean Sifrin isn't walking through that door, so UMass fans had better get used to Shaq Harris if Mills' recovery continues to drag.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T23:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T00:59:52.196+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
