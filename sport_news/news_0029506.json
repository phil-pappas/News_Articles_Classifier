He hadn't been in a game since a routine dunk caused a torn rotator cuff in his right shoulder on a telling January night in New Orleans.\nBryant, 37, started at small forward Sunday, pushed out of the backcourt because of the younger duo of Jordan Clarkson and D'Angelo Russell. He had five points on one-for-five shooting in 12 minutes.\nHis first shot, a three-point attempt from the left, hit the side of the backboard. His second shot, a mid-range jumper from the right, rimmed out.\nBryant hit a three-pointer from the right side and then missed from almost the same spot. He picked up his dribble on another play, pivoted several times and couldn't connect on a mid-range fadeaway over Joe Ingles.\nFans chanted his name in the fourth quarter when it became apparent he wouldn't return.\nBryant is already tiring of questions about how he'll look this season, sarcastically saying he would hold a \"B average\" if graded on the upcoming season.\nMore frankly, and relieving to the Lakers, he said his legs \"feel strong. I don't feel tired at all. It's just getting timing down. Getting acclimated to that again.\"\nIt might be hard to remember sometimes, especially in Bryant's final season (perhaps), but there were other players besides the 20-year veteran.\nJulius Randle showed hustle by pushing the ball upcourt a few times after taking defensive rebounds, but he shot poorly from outside and finished with seven points on two-for-10 shooting.\nAs if to demonstrate Randle's growing importance to the franchise, Bryant reacted strongly when Randle was fouled hard and landed on his back in the third quarter. Bryant jumped off the bench and practically ran onto the court.\n\"Damn right I did. If I could have ran fast enough to catch him, I would have,\" Bryant said.\nRandle was fine, allowing Bryant to offer one more compliment.\n\"I think he's an animal, man. I really do.\" Bryant said. \"He's competitive, extremely athletic and strong as a bull. That's a great combination to work from.\"\nRussell had five points and seemed a little out of control on drives, making two of eight shots overall. He had three assists and two turnovers.\n\"Rookie. Nineteen years old,\" Lakers Coach Byron Scott said. \"That's pretty much to be expected.\"\nLou Williams demonstrated his alleged versatility by scoring from the outside and on drives. He had 14 points.\nThe Lakers' second unit was Williams, Jabari Brown, Nick Young, Brandon Bass and Robert Sacre. Young had 10 points, making two of five three-point attempts.\nMetta World Peace was healthy but did not play Sunday, a possible sign of his tenuous spot on the Lakers' roster. He is expected to appear in Tuesday's exhibition, a rematch against Utah, Scott said.\nDerrick Favors had 16 points and nine rebounds for the Jazz.\nEtc.\nScott on fans calling for Bryant's return in the fourth quarter: \"I thought they were crazy. He hadn't played for 2 1/2 quarters. They didn't think I really was going to put him back in, did they? As much as I love Hawaii, it's a much bigger picture than these two games.\" Scott would not commit to whether Bryant would play Tuesday. Sure, the Lakers are in Hawaii for 10 days. But Scott says he is taking it seriously: \"This is business. I don't swim, so I don't get near the water anyway.\"\n(c)2015 Los Angeles Times\nVisit the Los Angeles Times at www.latimes.com\nDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.\nShare Comment", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/basketball/s-1732625&hashtags=ArcaMax", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/basketball/s-1732625", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/basketball/s-1732625&h=Kobe+Bryant+holds+court%2C+briefly%2C+in+Lakers%27+90%2D71+loss+to+Jazz"], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T19:09:25.962+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
