Honda’s new subcompact SUV fails to make a strong impression, despite delivering good fuel economy and a roomy interior.\nThe HR-V lacks any distinguishing style, features or personality to establish it as a leader in the burgeoning crop of small crossovers.\nIt’s a perfectly acceptable vehicle, but not a memorable one.\nHonda The 2016 Honda HR-V has good fuel economy and a roomy interior, but fails to make a strong impression. (Honda) HR-V prices start at $19,115 for a front-wheel-drive model with a six-speed manual transmission. All HR-Vs have a 1.8-liter four-cylinder engine that produces 141 horsepower. Stepping up to a continuously variable automatic transmission, or CVT, raises the price to $19,915. The least expensive all-wheel-drive HR-V costs $21,165. All-wheel-drive is only available with the smooth CVT.\nI tested a nicely equipped front-drive HR-V EX-L with navigation, Bluetooth phone and music compatibility, voice recognition, front seat side air bags, curtain air bags, leather seats, heated front seats; 60/40 split folding rear seats, 17-inch wheels and more. It stickered at $24,590. All prices exclude destination charges.\nThe HR-V competes with small SUVs like the Buick Encore, Chevrolet Trax, Fiat 500X, Jeep Renegade, Mazda CX-3, Mitsubishi Outlander Sport 2.4-liter and Nissan Juke. Its prices are comparable to similarly equipped models.\nThe HR-V’s selling points are a roomy interior and good fuel economy.\nThe passenger compartment has a high roof, excellent visibility (thanks to large windows) and accommodating front and rear seats. Its passenger volume is in the middle of the pack: more than the Encore, Trax, CX-3 and Juke; less than the 500X, Renegade and Outlander Sport.\nThe HR-V has the most cargo space, both behind the rear seat and with it folded flat. Despite that, it could use more, and larger, bins and cubbies to store glasses, phones, iPods and the like in the front seat. Road noise is quite noticeable at highway speed.\nThe interior looks good, but the flat panel and touch screen controls for audio and climate are inconvenient.\nThe HR-V also uses Honda’s faux-blind spot alert, a distracting video display that projects the view to the vehicle’s right-rear on the touch screen when you indicate a right turn. Honda has moved away from this system on more expensive vehicles. Next step: Drop them across the model line.\nThe HR-V’s horsepower is at the lower end of the class, topping only the Encore and Trax. It’s got the least torque, 127 pound-feet at 4,300 rpm. That trails the competition by 19 to 50 pound-feet.\nThe CVT works hard to overcome that disadvantage, but the HR-V does not feel quick, though it’s perfectly adequate around town and on the highway.\nThe HR-V’s fuel economy ties that of the Mazda CX-3 for best in class. The Environmental Protection Agency rates the Honda 28 mpg in the city, 35 on the highway and 31 in combined driving. The key combined rating matches the CX-3 and leads all others.\nThe HR-V’s styling is unremarkable. The SUV looks big and practical. Its height and large expanses of glass provide good sight lines owners will appreciate. There’s nothing objectionable or quirky about the HR-V’s looks, but nothing memorable to inspire affection like Honda’s Element did with its combination of whimsy and practicality.\nAutomakers are still figuring out how to apply their brand character to the new class of small SUVs. Nissan struck first, and endowed the Juke with odd looks and a sporty persona. Buick went upscale with the Encore. Chevy gave the Trax leading-edge connectivity and iPhone compatibility. Jeep looks and off-road ability distinguish the Renegade.\nThe HR-V’s failure to mark its territory leaves plenty of room for other automakers to stake their claims. Next candidate: the Mazda CX-3.\nHonda HR-V 2wd EX-L with Navigation\nFront-drive five-passenger subcompact SUV\nPrice as tested: $24,590 (excluding destination charge)\nReasons to buy: Passenger and cargo space, fuel economy, visibility\nShortcomings: Controls, voice recognition, distracting blind-spot display\nEngine: 1.8-liter 16-valve four-cylinder\nPower: 141 horsepower at 5,800 rpm; 127 pound-feet of torque at 4,300 rpm\nTransmission: Continuously variable automatic\nWheelbase: 102.8 inches\nLength: 169.1 inches\nWidth: 69.8 inches\nHeight: 63.2 inches\nCurb weight: 3,094 lbs.", "external_links": ["http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/lt/lt_cache/thumbnail/600/img/photos/2015/10/09/7b/b0/BIZ_AUTO-HONDA-REVIEW_1_DE.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-16T20:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T08:27:00.303+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
