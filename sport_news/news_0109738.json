Comments Email Print × \nMajor corporations provide employees discounted tickets to Broadway shows and other cultural events as a treat or perk. They even donate thousands of dollars to arts nonprofits and theater. But executives at these firms fail to see the importance of the arts when it comes to advancing workforce skills, at least without some prodding. \nIn a recent survey of 200 top human resources executives of corporations, nonprofits and government agencies conducted by Theatre Forward, a Manhattan organization that funds nonprofit theaters and arts education throughout the country, 92% of respondents said young people lack the skills to enter the workforce and be successful. And when asked what could boost the workplace preparedness of the next generation of employees, only 8% said arts education was important. They were more likely to note the value of sports, internships and communications courses. \nOnly after some prompting did the respondents change their minds. When asked to specifically reflect on whether participation in the arts could help improve communication, creativity and other workplace skills, 58% of respondents agreed. \n\"Even some of our board members who have been supporting us for so long were saying, well, 'How does theater improve focus?' \" said Bruce Whitacre, executive director of Theatre Forward. \"Even people who care about the arts and have benefited from it have trouble making the connection. We have to figure out how to break that mental block that separates art engagement from workforce preparedness.” \nMr. Whitacre, who started out as an accountant and then pivoted to dramatic writing at New York University's Tisch School of the Arts, said he still uses the skills he gained from his theater work in his current position. \"The ability to put on a show and create a certain environment helps to engage employees,\" he said. \"Storytelling and knowing how to work with different kinds of people are also useful.\" \nInterestingly, most of the executives surveyed had similar personal experiences: 89% said they had had arts education or personally participated in the arts. And the majority said that that experience helped them build characteristics that aided their careers, such as creativity, confidence, verbal communication, teamwork, focus and perseverance. \nMr. Whitacre said some executives he’s spoken with following the survey are having an \"aha moment,\" while for others it's reinforcement of what they already know. \n\"Those of us who develop talent believe the more professionals are aware of the ways theater and the arts can improve the skills and capabilities of America’s workforce, the better prepared we are to shape our corporate and civic activities,\" said Jodeen Kozlak, executive vice president and chief human resources officer at Target. \"Each of us and our companies have roles to play in acting on this important new information.\" \nMr. Whitacre said the main challenge that employers should work to address is guaranteeing access to the arts at low-income schools where such programs are threatened by budget cuts.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T08:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T17:55:05.083+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
