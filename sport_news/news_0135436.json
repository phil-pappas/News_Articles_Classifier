Even at 34 with 10 full seasons as a starter, Manning is fully capable of making a stunningly misguided play at the worst time. A left-handed toss while in the grasp. A reckless pass under pressure. Or, as he did in the opener against Dallas, a clock-stopping incompletion when he should have taken the sack, exacerbating the miscue by losing track of the down. Manning also has the ability, as he showed against the San Francisco 49ers last Sunday, to play a football game that leaves onlookers wondering something else about him. Wondering if he should, and will, one day earn induction into the Pro Football Hall of Fame. The topic surely has resurfaced on barstools and ballrooms since Manning threw for 441 yards and three touchdowns and carried the Giants past a lackluster Niners team in prime time. We got a heavy dose of the “good Eli’’ and not the “bad Eli,’’ well-oiled descriptors suggesting the dichotomy that is Eli Manning. But critics need not fret. We could see Manning’s nasty side come out on any Sunday, or more timely on Monday night against the Philadelphia Eagles. Still, Manning has had a good enough career to be injected into the Hall-of-Fame debate. It’s important to note that the NFL Hall hardly bears the strictest standards of Major League Baseball, which has a large contingent of stuffy grudge-bearing voters who arbitrarily and sometimes recklessly decide who did what with performance-enhancing drugs. The Manning argument for acceptance is fairly simple. He has two championship rings, a pile of clutch performances, more than 41,000 yards passing and, perhaps most underrated, a remarkable ability to play every week. Manning has started 174 straight regular-season games. The only quarterbacks with better streaks are Brett Favre, with his likely untouchable record of 297 straight regular-season starts, and Eli’s brother Peyton (208). In fact, only eight quarterbacks have started at least 100 straight regular-season games. Manning gains points when viewing him against a few of the 23 modern-day quarterbacks in the Hall of Fame. Or at least two of them. Joe Namath, as head-scratching a Hall of Famer as you’ll find in any sport, had 173 touchdown passes and 220 interceptions. His quarterback rating was 65.5, a number in today’s game that would have players plowing snow by mid-week. Even Fran Tarkenton, despite throwing for 47,003 yards – seemingly 46,000 of them off dump-offs to Chuck Foreman – made the Hall with a 57.0 completion percentage and an 80.4 rating. Manning, by comparison, has 41,172 yards passing, a 59.2 completion percentage, 269 touchdowns, 187 interceptions and an 83.0 rating in the regular season. (And those two rings. Did I mention those two rings?) Let’s not forget, of course, the restrictions placed on defenses that allow offenses in general, and quarterbacks in particular, to record progressively inflated numbers in at least the past 10 years. Manning arrived at the perfect time for NFL quarterbacks. And yet he has put together multiple seasons during his prime that you wouldn’t see in the worst prime years of veteran quarterbacks such as Peyton, Tom Brady, Aaron Rodgers, Philip Rivers, Tony Romo or Drew Brees. It’s hard, if not impossible, to promote someone as a future Hall of Famer when he’s never been among the top five players at his position. Eli’s career isn’t remotely comparable to those of Peyton, Brady, Rodgers or Brees. But it’s barely in the same ballpark as other QBs perceived as having similar blueprints. Rivers, for example, has never thrown more interceptions than touchdowns in a season. Manning, of course, has led the league in interceptions two of the past five seasons: a 27-pick debacle two seasons ago and 25 interceptions in 2010. Rivers’ lowest completion percentage was 60.2 in 2007. Manning’s CAREER completion percentage is 59.2. Nor has Romo thrown more interceptions than touchdowns in a season. His career completion percentage is 65.3. His career rating is 97.6, almost 15 points better than Manning’s. Even Ben Roethlisberger, despite a clunker in 2006 with 18 TDs and 23 interceptions, has never had a completion percentage worse than 59.7, close to Eli’s career number. And Roethlisberger’s 94.2 career rating blows away Manning as well. “In my opinion, he just keeps getting better,’’ Tom Coughlin said of Manning. Coughlin makes an interesting observation. Manning indeed is on his way to a second straight elite season. He attributes it to himself and teammates continuing to have a better grasp of Ben McAdoo’s offense. Manning better continue to improve per his coach’s critique. Because unless he dramatically improves his numbers across the next five seasons, assuming he stays healthy, Manning’s only shot at the Hall of Fame should be virtual automatic entrance with a third Super Bowl title. And we all know the crapshoot of winning the Super Bowl in today’s NFL. recordonline.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T23:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T22:34:04.520+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
