The elite rebounder and the defending Eastern Conference champions remain apart on a long-term contract. The Cavs practice Friday, and if he's not there he will be considered a holdout. \nThompson was a key contributor during Cleveland's run to the NBA Finals last season, filling in when starter Kevin Love dislocated his shoulder. Thompson and his representatives believe he deserves a maximum contract. \nThe Cavs value Thompson, but aren't willing to go beyond what they're comfortable offering. \nTwice in the past few days LeBron James said he was confident the sides could reach a long-term deal. James is also represented by Thompson's agent, Rich Paul. \n   ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T17:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T21:33:17.736+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
