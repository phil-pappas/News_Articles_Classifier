She says the disaster could strike at any time so we need to have a gameplan.\n“The disaster can be tremendous and are we ready for that? Probably never ready, but it certainly helps to at least be a bit pro-active about it and to have a bit of a gameplan in place.”\nShe is encouraging anyone in Vancouver to take part in the Neighbourhood Emergency Assistance Team program to develop their own strategy if the worst case scenario ever happens.\n“In the past we would have probably just shrugged and looked at each other and wondered what to do, and I think now our neighbours are prepared to know exactly what we need to do once we get out of our houses and how we are going to support one another.”\nRelated Stories North Shore Rescue team wants help keeping volunteers More hikers stranded on Grouse Mountain", "external_links": ["http://vancouver.ca/home-property-development/neighbourhood-emergency-assistance-team.aspx"], "published": "2015-10-05T00:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T19:27:42.489+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
