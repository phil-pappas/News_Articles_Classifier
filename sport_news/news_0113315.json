She has made it back to the No. 1 ranking after conquering much more serious health concerns and is well aware of her limits at this stage of her career. She retired from three tournaments this year, citing injuries.\nBut Williams’s calling time on her season would be much less understandable if it were primarily about lingering disappointment or faltering motivation, which was what her coach, Patrick Mouratoglou, seemed to suggest this week.\n“I don’t doubt she will have the motivation to win more Grand Slams and reach records,” Mouratoglou told ESPNW. “I’m just thinking about the end of the season, and I don’t know how high the motivation is, and I don’t think she should go play competitions if her motivation is not high enough.”\nOn Tennis An occasional column looking at the news, issues and personalities in the world of tennis.
