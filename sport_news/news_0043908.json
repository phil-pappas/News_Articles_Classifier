Smith and Timofey Mozgov in uniform for tonight's game against the Philadelphia 76ers.\nHead coach David Blatt said the starters would include Mo Williams, Matthew Dellavedova, Richard Jefferson, James Jones and likely Anderson Varejao.\nBlatt said there's a small possibility Varejao takes the game off, too. They want to monitor his condition after his pregame workout.\nThese moves were expected. Blatt plans to preserve some of his veterans throughout the exhibition schedule. Six of the team's seven games are part of back-to-back sets.\nAfter tonight's contest, Cleveland's next game will be on Monday against the Memphis Grizzlies in Columbus. Kevin Love could suit up for that game.\nUPDATE: Sasha Kaun started in his place at center and Varejao comes off the bench.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T01:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T06:19:17.461+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
