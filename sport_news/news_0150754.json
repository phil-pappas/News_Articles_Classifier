If Toronto wins or ties, then the Union will be eliminated from playoff consideration. It would be the fifth time in six seasons the Union would fail to qualify for the playoffs. \nShaking off the result of the U.S. Open Cup won't be easy, especially since a familiar malady returned - the inability to put a team away. \nThe Union led 1-0 at halftime, had other chances and just couldn't put on the accelerator. And afterward, coach Jim Curtin and his players felt devastated. Curtin spilled his heart out at the postgame press conference. \n\"Again, all I can say is sorry for not delivering something that we've talked about achieving. . . . It's elusive for us right now,\" Curtin said. \nHe then praised his team's effort (if not execution). \n\"No fault of my players, they put everything into the game. [They] emptied their tanks for me.\" \nPlaying hard is rarely a problem with the Union. It's playing well that has dogged this franchise. \nTheir lack of speed up top, their inability to finish plus an overall lack of depth are among the issues the team faces. \nThere are more that will have to be addressed in the offseason. \nRight now the immediate goal is not to hang their collective heads, and be representative against Toronto (13-13-4, 43 points). If not, this is a Toronto team, led by Sebastien Giovinco (20 goals) that can bury the Union. \nIt won't be easy, rebounding from such a difficult loss, but with only three games left, at least this nightmarish season is soon coming to an end.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T22:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T22:42:00.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
