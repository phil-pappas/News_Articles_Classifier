Games between the Steelers and Ravens are notorious for their on-field violence, but Baltimore wideout Steve Smith upped the ante after Thursday night's battle, announcing that Pittsburgh safety Mike Mitchell is on his \"lifetime hit list.\"\nSmith may want to ask for a do-over on that warning, though.\nVideo of a big hit that Smith took by the sideline showed linebacker Lawrence Timmons, not Mitchell, striking Smith in the back. The veteran wide receivertried to walk it off on his way to the huddle, but crumbled to the ground soon after. Smith left the game with a lower back contusion and did not return to the game.\n\"I got speared in my back by an ex-teammate,\" said Smith, who played with Mitchell for Carolina in 2013. \"I kinda know his character and who he is. After he hit me, he said, 'How do you like that?'\"\nTimmons and Smith have never teamed together.\nThe Ravens and the Steelers will play again Dec. 27. Smith announced prior to the season that he plans to retire following this campaign.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T23:14:14.351+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
