(Image Source: Mike Ehrmann/Getty Images) \nHere are this week’s picks ranked in order of confidence: \n(14) Seattle Seahawks vs. Detroit Lions: Seattle is not where you go to get healthy, so expected the 0-3 Lions to return to Detroit still searching for their first win. Even if RB Marshawn Lynch can’t go or is limited, the Seahawks believe they have found something in undrafted rookie Thomas Rawls . \n(13) Green Bay Packers @ San Francisco 49ers: The Green Bay Packers won’t win every game by double digits and the San Francisco 49ers won’t lose every game by double digits…having said that the Packers will beat the hapless Niners. Jim Tomsula looks overmatched and Colin Kaepernick is getting exposed. Good thing they got rid of Jim Harbaugh . \n(12) Buffalo Bills vs. New York Giants: It looks like the Bills will be without RB LeSean McCoy and WR Sammy Watkins , but they managed 41 points without much production from either in Miami (McCoy had 16 yards on 11 carries, Watkins had one catch for 39 yards). They have other players who can pick up the slack—see RB Karlos Williams and TE Charles Clay —and their defense will harass QB Eli Manning into a mistake or two. The G-Men played well against Washington but they’ve won five straight against them and are 2-10 in their past 12 against everyone else, and 6-15 in their past 21 on the road. \n(11) San Diego Chargers vs. Cleveland Browns: The Chargers have dropped two straight (both on the road) but return to SoCal for some home cooking while the Browns were crushed by three TDs in their only road game of the season (@ NYJ). \n(10) Arizona Cardinals vs. St. Louis Rams: Leading one of the hottest teams in the NFL, QB Carson Palmer is 16-2 in his past 18 as a starter, including nine straight, with a 12-2 record at home with the Red Birds. Enough said. \n(9) Indianapolis Colts vs. Jacksonville Jaguars: The signing of QB Josh Johnson to potentially backup No. 2 Matt Hasselbeck if he were to start is a sign Indy is worried that Andrew Luck may miss Sunday’s game, which is why the Colts are lower than you might have expected. \n(8) New York Jets @ Miami Dolphins (London): The Dolphins appear to be heading in the wrong direction and playing without LT Branden Albert against New York’s vaunted D-line won’t help matters. As long as QB Ryan Fitzpatrick doesn’t make mistakes—like he did against the Eagles last week—the Jets should bounce back across the pond. Including their season-opening win (17-10 at Washington), the Phins haven’t looked good this season. \n(7) Philadelphia Eagles @ Washington Redskins: I still don’t believe in QB Sam Bradford (14 of 28 for 118 yards last week), but the Eagles O-line played their best game of the season and RB Ryan Matthews (108 yards) brought some life to the rushing attack. RB DeMarco Murray is also expected to play according to reports. Ultimately, this is an anti-Washington pick, as the odds are QB Kirk Cousins (4 INTs) implodes against an opportunistic Philly D (8 takeaways). \n(6) Denver Broncos vs. Minnesota Vikings: The Broncos aren’t just 3-0 this season they’re also 3-0 against the spread. I suspect the Vikings may end one of those streaks but I don’t have the guts to pick the outright upset on the road. QB Peyton Manning is 3-0 in his career against the Vikes, but more importantly is getting better by the week (59.9 rating in Week 1, 86.9 rating in Week 2, 101.7 rating in Week 3). \n(5) Chicago Bears vs. Oakland Raiders: The Raiders are favored for the first time in 27 games and that scares me. So does the fact that I switched my pick last week from Oakland to Cleveland. I missed the wedding…I won’t be there for the funeral. It’s easy to pile on the Bears but to be fair…they’ve lost to the Packers, Cardinals and Seahawks…the Raiders are much improved but not that much. WR Alshon Jeffery is out but QB Jay Cutler may suit up. \n(4) Kansas City Chiefs @ Cincinnati Bengals: The return of CB Sean Smith to go with potential star rookie Marcus Peters will allow the Chiefs to match up with WR A.J. Green & Company in what should be a highly-contested game. \n(3) Houston Texans @ Atlanta Falcons: The Falcons are a touchdown favorite…can you say over-adjustment? Sooner or later, trailing in the fourth quarter will catch up to Atlanta…this is the week. I guess I’m officially back on the Texans bandwagon. Houston may also get a big lift if RB Arian Foster can make his 2015 debut. \n(2) Tampa Bay Buccaneers @ Carolina Panthers: Rookie QB Jameis Winston is starting to make use of WR Mike Evans (7 catches for 105 yards last week) and as that rapport grows so will the Tampa offense. Look for the troika of DE Jacquies Smith , DT Gerald McCoy and LB Lavonte David to make things tough on Carolina QB Cam Newton . \n(1) Dallas Cowboys @ New Orleans Saints: I’m not saying having QB Tony Romo last week wouldn’t have made a difference in their loss to Atlanta, but that’s not why the defense was lit up by WR Julio Jones . The Saints no longer have that type of firepower on offense while the Cowboys (21 rushes, 127 yards, 4 TDs last week) should lean more on their run game this week. \nDaniel Mogollon is a member of the Pro Football Writers of America and the Football Writers Association of America.
