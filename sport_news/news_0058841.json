We'll see how it goes for the next three months. \nCampbell, to be sure, looks the part. He brings a firmer voice and a jutting jaw to the sideline. And, Lord knows, there's a needed place for each on this team considering the lackluster way it's played to date. \nPat your defensive players on the back after they've been constantly run over? Make apologies for players not giving full effort? Watch players run to the media about being worked too hard and then soften the practice load because of it? \nJoe Philbin was fired as Dolphins coach on Monday after posting a 24-28 record in three-plus seasons (2012-15). \nThat was Philbin's way. \nThere's no need to pile on him today. He is a decent man, with a good heart, who was overmatched for the job. He wasn't the first one to be guilty of that. He wasn't even the worst one, given Cam Cameron's 1-15 season as head coach of the Dolphins in 2007. \nOne of the bad parts of this new millennium with the Dolphins is witnessing the lowest moments of a coach's career. Dave Wannstedt. Nick Saban. Cameron. Tony Sparano. \nNow it's Philbin's turn in that lineup. If that list shows anything, it's that making a change doesn't guarantee anything. And the move to Campbell isn't even a change as much as a temporary shift. \nFootball isn't set up like the other sports to have shifts of leadership in midseason. That's why there are usually changes like this only near the end of failed seasons, as a franchise prepares for the next year. \nNo doubt Ross will have an eye on next year as this one plays out. No doubt he'll weigh Mike Tannenbaum's future as the team's executive vice president of football operations against whatever options are out there. \nTannenbaum will measure coaches, too. He's close with UCLA's Jim Mora and San Francisco 49ers defensive coordinator Eric Mangini. Will that matter? Where does this eventually go? \nThat's for tomorrow. Today, Philbin's out and it's Campbell's show now. \nThis is becoming a Dolphins tradition. Wannstedt resigned under pressure nine games into the 2004 season. Sparano was fired with three games remaining in 2011 and was replaced on an interim basis by the defensive backs coach, Todd Bowles. \nBowles, now the New York Jets head coach, provided the final evidence Sunday in London it was time for Philbin to go, beating his former team, 27-14. That's not to say Bowles should have stayed with the Dolphins. It's just to note you don't know at this point where all the pieces will land. \nThe Dolphins are in such a hole that the playoffs are a fantasy at this point. But Monday's move leaves the idea the team can still salvage some season. There are still talented players here. It's now on Campbell to see if they can show it on the field.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T21:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T22:09:50.827+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
