Both teams are undefeated in conference play. Croatan is off to their best start in years with their only loss coming to Pamlico in the first game of the 2015 season. Northside, who had to forfeit some earlier wins, is coming off a win over Dixon. A win for the Monarchs will put them on track for a possible conference championship. #1 East Lincoln at Newton-Conover Game Preview: Every week in the Southern District 7 2A Conference, teams better play their best. The conference could arguably be called the best 2A conference in the state. East Lincoln will come in behind the record-breaking duo of QB Chazz Surratt and WR Sage Surratt. Most people overlook the Mustang defense that has been playing lights out. Newton-Conover is a tough team to play when they play at home. Coach Matt Beam has a very gifted QB as well in Cameron Stanley. This game should have a lot of offense. Northeastern at Holmes Game Preview: A big battle in the Northeastern-Coastal 2A Conference between these two squads as both programs have been very successful the last few years. When you talk about Northeastern, you will always have a very athletic offensive squad. The Eagles can score a lot of points. Holmes is under a new coach this year in Paul Hoggard, but he is one of the top coaches in NC after leading the Richmond County program for several years. I look for Holmes to try to control the ball with their rushing attack to keep the potent Eagle offense off the field.
