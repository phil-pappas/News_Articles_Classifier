Image 8 of 8 Krautz, Nederland too much for Central 1 / 8 Back to Gallery \nNederland's Austin Krautz scored five touchdowns to help the Bulldogs overcome a 13-7 halftime deficit to defeat Central 35-20 and extend their winning streak over the Jaguars to five games dating back to 2011. \nKrautz scored four of his touchdowns in the second half, finding the end zone on runs of 13, 12, 6 and a 73-yard dash down the right side with 6:23 left in the fourth quarter to seal the win. Krautz also added a seven-yard touchdown reception from quarterback Mitchell Lebaron , who finished the game having completed 9-of-20 passes for 71 yards - midway through the second quarter. Video: Nederland's Krautz talks about performance, win over Central \n\"This was huge for the whole team,\" said Krautz, who finished the game with 231 yards on 28 carries. \"We had to win this game. We are on track to win a district title now.\" \nThe win moved Nederland to 4-2 overall and 3-0 in District 22-5A, setting up an undefeated matchup with Port Neches-Groves next Friday. With the loss, Central falls to 2-4 overall and 2-1 in district. \n\"We are on schedule,\" Nederland coach Larry Neumann said. \"Two teams were out here playing for a district championship (Friday). But we know it's not over yet.\" \nKrautz's first of four second half touchdowns gave Nederland its first lead of the game - 14-13 - midway through the third quarter. Central drove the ball into Bulldog territory on the ensuing possession, but a Tavian Mayfield interception on a pass attempt by Central quarterback Chris Boudreaux halted the Jags' momentum. Off the turnover, Krautz scored from 12 yards to give Nederland a 21-13 lead. \n\"I read the quarterback's eyes,\" Mayfield said. \"I grabbed the ball and just thought, 'go.' I'm just glad I could come up with a big play.\" \nThe Bulldogs went on to score the first 21 points of the second half to take control of the game after trailing for most of the first half. \nCentral had some big plays of their own, including a 49-yard touchdown reception by Delvin Bennett from Boudreaux in the first quarter. Central's Jawon Mitchell also returned a kickoff 85 yards to give Central a 13-7 halftime lead. \nBut when it came down to it, Krautz was just too much to handle. \n\"He pretty much did what he does every Friday night,\" Neumann said. \"He's not only a fast runner, but he's really a strong runner as well. He just keeps getting better.\" \nCentral running back Devwah Whaley finished the night with 24 carries for 109 yards, but was denied the end zone for the first time in district. Theodrick Foster 's nine-yard touchdown run in the fourth quarter was the only points Central scored in the second half. \nDThompson@BeaumontEnterprise.comTwitter.com/daveth89", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T07:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T00:03:52.757+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
