Respected. Distinguished. Those are just a few words that accurately describe the late Bert Jenkins -- a well-known basketball coach on the Mississippi gulf coast. \nJenkins passed away last week at the age of 90 following a heart attack. \nA memorial service was held Thursday at the gymnasium named in his honor, and now, in his memory. \nA big crowd of family, former players and coaches made their way to the home of the Gulfport Admirals to hear stories of Jenkins and his unmatched integrity. \nMany laughs and agreeable nods were shared, but it was Jenkins' character that everyone couldn't stop talking about. \nJenkins was a smart man when it came to the game of basketball and even football when he coached. He was a winner of seven state championships and 13 Big Eight Conference titles. \n(Copyright 2015 WLOX . All Rights Reserved.)
