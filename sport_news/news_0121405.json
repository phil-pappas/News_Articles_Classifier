Rowell, a senior co-captain, agreed it's “human nature” to allow your ambitions to run wild and start thinking two or three weeks ahead. After all, Pitt players break their pre-practice huddle with the words “ACC championship,” and that game isn't scheduled until Dec. 5. Still, setting long-range goals is only appropriate if the short term is not overlooked. That's why Rowell said, “The Orange is on the clock.” Pitt (5-1, 3-0) meets Syracuse at noon Saturday at Carrier Dome owning a three-game winning streak and high hopes. Pitt leads the ACC Coastal but still has a lot of work to do. “I cannot stress enough the importance of just this week,” Rowell said. “They're good. This is one of the best defensive lines we'll play. The offensive line has its hands full.” Pitt's players need to have their minds in the right place and assert dominance over struggling Syracuse (3-3, 1-1), which has lost three in a row. There is no such thing as a must-win situation for a first-place team so early in the season, but Pitt might need the cushion a victory can provide considering its subsequent opponents. ESPN is coming to town Thursday night, giving Pitt only four days to prepare for North Carolina (5-1, 2-0), which sits a half-game off the lead. After that, Pitt plays Notre Dame (6-1) at Heinz Field — possibly another prime-time game — before traveling to Duke (5-1, 2-0). That's three of the toughest games on the schedule. Perhaps Pitt's resiliency will be put to the test again after the Panthers won four of the five games it played without reigning ACC Player of the Year James Conner. No easy task, considering Conner rushed for 1,765 yards last season. It's taken three backs to replace Conner, and Qadree Ollison, Chris James and Darrin Hall are on pace to total 1,682. Players felt bad when Conner went down with a knee injury, but their sympathy was for a friend, not themselves. 's what we would have done with James.” jdipaola@tribweb.com or via Twitter @JDiPaola_Trib .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T07:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T07:56:27.018+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
