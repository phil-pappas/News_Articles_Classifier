LOUIS -- On the first postseason meeting between the Cubs and the Cardinals in 123 years of the rivalry, pitchers John Lackey and Jon Lester provided a duel worthy of the occasion.\nThe Cardinals provided enough offense to give Lackey the victory.\nLackey, a 36-year-old veteran of 22 playoff appearances, pitched 71/3 shutout innings to help the Cardinals to a 4-0 victory over the Cubs in the opener of the best-of-five National League Division Series on Friday night at Busch Stadium.\nLackey had a no-hitter through five innings before giving up one hit each in the sixth and seventh. He walked one and struck out five.\nStephen Piscotty hit a ground-rule double to right field off Lester with one out in the first, and Matt Holliday followed with an RBI single for a 1-0 Cardinals lead. Lester shut down the Cardinals until the eighth, when Tommy Pham added a pinch-hit solo home run in his first postseason plate appearance. Piscotty's two-run homer off Pedro Strop sealed the Cardinals' victory.\nLackey didn't allow a baserunner until he walked Kyle Schwarber with one out in the fourth, but Kris Bryant hit into a double play to erase the Cubs' progress. Lackey didn't allow a hit until Addison Russell singled up the middle to lead off the sixth inning. Russell reached third after a stolen base and a groundout, but Dexter Fowler flied out deep to right field to end the Cubs' threat.\nLackey escaped more trouble in the seventh after allowing a leadoff single to Schwarber, striking out Bryant and prompting Anthony Rizzo to hit into a double play at first. Bryant struck out with runners on first and third to end the game.\nLester gave up five hits, struck out nine and walked one over 71/3 innings.\n(c)2015 Chicago Tribune\nVisit the Chicago Tribune at www.chicagotribune.com\nDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.\nShare Comment", "external_links": ["http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/baseball/s-1735464&h=Cardinals+take+Game+1+of+NLDS+with+4%2D0+win+over+Cubs", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/baseball/s-1735464&hashtags=ArcaMax", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/baseball/s-1735464"], "published": "2015-10-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T06:00:17.453+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
