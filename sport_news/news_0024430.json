They don't know what it is.\nBut they are hazarding a guess. It's a \"swarm of megastructures.\"\nThat's right: odd blips of light visible through the Kepler Space Telescope could be something mammoth -- perhaps solar-energy panels of some sort -- constructed by space aliens.\n\"Aliens should always be the very last hypothesis you consider,\" Penn State astronomer Jason Wright told The Independent this week. \"But this looked like something you would expect an alien civilization to build. I was fascinated by how crazy it looked.\"\nHe's talking about a star system between the constellations Cygnus and Lyra that is giving off an unusual light pattern. The star has been named KIC 8462852.\n\"The light pattern suggests there is a big mess of matter circling the star, in tight formation,\" The Atlantic writes . \"That would be expected if the star were young. When our solar system first formed, four and a half billion years ago, a messy disk of dust and debris surrounded the sun, before gravity organized it into planets, and rings of rock and ice. But this unusual star isn't young.\"\nOne theory is that the light pattern comes from the \"break-up\" of a barrage of exocomets, but no one seems especially satisfied with that explanation. Yale University astronomer Tabetha Boyajian wrote an academic paper on the subject, cheekily titled \"Where's the flux?\" , in which she calls the light pattern, or \"object,\" \"both remarkable ... and unremarkable at the same time.\"\n\"It was kind of unbelievable that it was real data,\" she told New Scientist. \"We were scratching our heads. For any idea that came up there was always something that would argue against it.\"\nWashington Post reporter Joel Achenbach insists we shouldn't get too excited . This strange distant light pattern is \"what you expect the universe to throw at you, repeatedly: stuff you can't quite figure out on first glance.\"\nMission accomplished, universe. So far. The analysis has been going on for four years, but it has only just begun. We will continue to try to figure out the mystery of KIC 8462852 because we have to. As the acclaimed physicist Stephen Hawking has put it : \"It is important for us to know if we are alone in the dark.\"\n-- Douglas Perry", "external_links": ["http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/forget-water-on-mars-astronomers-may-have-just-found-giant-alien-megastructures-orbiting-a-star-near-a6693886.html", "http://arxiv.org/pdf/1509.03622v1.pdf", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/speaking-of-science/wp/2015/10/15/no-we-havent-discovered-alien-megastructures-around-a-distant-star/", "http://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2015/10/the-most-interesting-star-in-our-galaxy/410023/", "http://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/stephen-hawking-there-is-no-bigger-question-in-science-than-the-search-for-extraterrestrial-life-10402432.html"], "published": "2015-10-16T16:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T05:45:25.169+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
