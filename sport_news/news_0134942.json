(AP) - Kevin Albert Jr. danced through the hallways of his mom’s house in a white cap and gown the day he graduated from high school. \nThe 19-year-old was the first student to cross the stage at Brainerd High School on May 14, and he was so excited he danced across the stage, too. \nAlbert, a standout linebacker at Brainerd who wore No. 10, landed a full-ride football scholarship to a small college in Arkansas. On that graduation day, he couldn’t stop smiling. \nHe’d struggled to get that diploma, in and out of trouble, living in rough areas, hanging with a rough crowd. Police knew him as an associate of the Rollin 40 Crips. He’d been shot at. Robbed and forced to strip naked. A week after graduation, he was arrested when he punched a hole in a bathroom wall and his mother called police. \nBut over the summer, Albert moved to Little Rock, Ark., for a fresh start: new city, new friends. His older brother is a sophomore at the school, also playing football, studying to be a math teacher. The day Tracy Ellis dropped her sons off, she snapped funny photos in the car as they waited in a Subway drive-through. \nAll was right. \nBut after just a few weeks in college, Albert said he wanted to come back to Chattanooga. Ellis begged him not to. \n“Please don’t make this choice,” she told him. “Get back on the bus, go back to school.” \nHe returned to Chattanooga anyway. Ellis told him to find somewhere else to stay. He couldn’t stay with her. \n“I was trying to show him a little tough love,” she said, sitting in a chair on her front porch, eyes distant. “But I didn’t think it would be like this.” \nOn Sept. 29, two weeks after he returned, Albert was shot multiple times and died in the middle of Rosemont Drive near the Missionary Ridge Tunnel. He was in a car with other people who shot him and pushed him out, Ellis said. \n“He shoulda never come back,” said Gary Cross, a longtime family friend. He shook his head. “Not Lil’ Kevin. Not him.” \nIn the 15 years Sgt. Josh May has been on the Chattanooga police force, he’s known just two officers who’ve been shot, but the young people he meets on the street often see three friends shot each month. \n“They live in a completely different, alternative world than we live in,” he said. “It’s survival mode. They don’t see past Thursday. Most people don’t have a clue what these kids are going through every single day.” \nHe knew Albert. He was a good student, a good kid, May said. But sometimes, trouble just finds a kid.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T21:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T22:41:57.063+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
