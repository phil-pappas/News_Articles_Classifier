Hamilton schedule. \nIn front of the Acorns are four of the toughest teams they will face this regular season and to kick it all off is the toughest of them all: Oak Grove. \nIt’s no secret the Eagles’ game plan to win, either: Run Rasaan Fontenette. \nFontenette has 1,273 yards and 13 touchdowns on the ground. He accounts for all but 538 yards of Oak Grove’s offense. Basically, think Trevor Bearden from two years ago, but put him on a different team. \n“We’re wanting to stop him. Our whole defensive philosophy is stop him so we can win. We’re going to go in with the mindset that we’re the better team,” said coach Mike Gemo. \nOak Grove enters the game on a four-game winning streak, having outscored opponents 192-24 in that stretch. \nLO knows it has the capability to beat the Eagles, but the question is whether they will execute the game plan. \n“Outside our locker room everybody expects them to beat us,” Gemo said. “Our kids don’t believe that so we’re going to go out there and play a good game.” \nGemo said there were too many mistakes made in the Santa Teresa game that cannot be made against Oak Grove. \n“We have to fix them. We had too many penalties,” Gemo said. “The kids were revved up for that game and they got it, but we got to play with control.” \nStill, he’s confident his boys can match up tonight. \n“If we want to be a big cat, we have to go get it done,” Gemo said. “Our kids are taking on the challenge this week. They’re going to be ready. They’re focused. They’re up for the challenge and we’re excited for the challenge.” \nLive Oak for perhaps the first time this season will enter the game as an underdog. In polls looking at the Central Coast Section, Oak Grove is ranked higher. \nIt puts the Acorns in a unique spot. \n“I think there will always be a target on Live Oak’s back. We’ve got six wins already. We’re off two league championships in B League. People were always looking at us that they were going to get a win off of us. We take it very personal. We’re a better football team than everybody thinks we are.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T21:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T11:43:56.989+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
