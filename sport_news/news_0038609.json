Beckham will appeal the punishment, pointing out that he was not flagged for any unsportsmanlike conduct penalties in a game in which the Bills were called for four separate personal fouls among their total of 17 penalties as a team. \nThere is video showing Beckham throwing a quick jab at Bills safety Duke Williams during a fourth-quarter interception return after Williams seemed to seek out Beckham before taking him off his feet with a block. \n\"I get punched every single game, punched,\" Beckham said, using air quotes for emphasis the second time. \"Whatever it is, I get hit in my face every single game. Like I said, it is what it is, but we're playing football and these are grown men out here. I don't think anybody should be talking about what happened after they lost the game.\" \n\"We're 2-2, we beat the Buffalo Bills last week,\" he added. \"The past is behind you, can't really change it. It doesn't bother me, I'm fine. I'm fine every single day [and] I sleep like a baby at night.\" \nThe Giants have repeatedly defended Beckham and his expression of emotion on the field, and did so again Wednesday. His ascension from rookie phenomenon to league record-setter and one of its top playmakers has brought remarkable fame and respect after having just completed the 16th game of his professional career. \nAll of that has made Beckham a target of the opposition. \n\"Obviously I was disappointed because I think he's beyond and above a lot of that stuff, and I think he'll put it behind him,\" coach Tom Coughlin said. \"And he's an emotional guy. Hey, let's face it, I told him, 'I want you to continue to block the way you're blocking.' He flies around out there.\" \nBeckham, 22, said he stopped by Coughlin's office to chat early Wednesday morning after visiting with general manager Jerry Reese, whom Beckham said told him: \"Just keep doing your job, we love everything you do.\" \n\"It's tough to walk the line,\" Beckham said. \"You know that they're out there targeting you and they're trying to do things to you, as much as somebody wants to say that they're not, they are, and that's just the case. Like I said, we're out there to play football and that's all I came here to do, to play football and do whatever this team needs.\" \nGiants quarterback Eli Manning said Beckham \"plays hard, practices hard and he wants to be great and he's emotional about it. He takes it very serious and I think that's a good way to play football.\" \nBeckham reiterated Wednesday his praise for the Bills' defense, although the fallout from Sunday's game left him questioning their reputation as well. \n\"For a Bills team who I think is one of the best defenses in the league, could be one of the best teams in the league, just to hear remarks and stuff like that, it's kind of confusing, it kind of messes with my idea of their identity,\" Beckham said. \"And where do they go from here? I don't know. Like I said, it's all irrelevant, all words, all in the past. \n\"There's nothing any one of us can do about it. So we move forward to San Fran.\"  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T08:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T09:51:59.592+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
