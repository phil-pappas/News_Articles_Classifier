The Congress not only asked why Prime Minister Narendra Modi had decided to skip the convention, but also questioned why the event had been shifted from October 12, the day the law was enacted, to October 16. Led by Ahmad Patel, political secretary to Congress president Sonia Gandhi, the Congress today saluted the law saying it had given people power. “The phrase RTI ‘file kar doonga’ (will file a plea under the law) has become a symbol of people’s power. This transformative piece of law completes 10 years. Well done India!” tweeted Patel. — TNS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T04:19:43.573+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
