Advertisement Volleyball: Friendswood clips Clear Falls in four sets By Ted Dunnam Houston Community Newspapers \nMistakes and missed opportunities prove to be penal in the District 24-6A volleyball wars and almost no team in the league is immune to costly miscues. \nFriendswood, bouncing back from a tough five-set loss to Clear Brook, bounced back with tenacity to take a convincing 25-16, 22-25, 25-22, 25-15 win over error-prone Clear Falls Tuesday night in the Mustang gym. \nThe win improved fourth-place Friendswood to 4-4 in league play while third-place Clear Falls fell to 5-3. \n“This is a huge win for our program right now,” Friendswood head coach Kylie Kunefke said. “The kids battled all night, and I’m proud of them. \n“We didn’t sit back and wait – we made things happen.” \nThe Lady Knights, meanwhile, couldn’t build on the momentum of a second-game win as Friendswood repeatedly turned back Clear Falls’ best offerings. \n“Friendswood played a good match, but honestly we’re never going to win a match with that many errors,” Lady Knights head coach Lyndsay Hodges said. \n“When my best hitter is hitting out and my next best hitter is trying to do everything she can to make the sets work, and my passers on my defense can’t make anything work…we’re just not going to win. That’s the bottom line. \n“Friendswood played a well-put-together match. They stayed composed and were able to take advantage of the errors we made.” \nThe Lady Mustangs dominated game one, jumping to a 10-4 lead behind two kills each from Shannon Murphy and McKenna Fridye. Two kills from freshman Ashlyn Ross helped the Lady Mustangs build a 14-7 cushion. \nThe Lady Knights cut the lead to 20-16 on a block from Sophie Schaff, before Friendswood reeled off the final five points on a block winner from Sarah Thomas, an error from Clear Falls, and three kills from Murphy. \nGame two was close throughout, and Friendswood even built a 21-19 lead on a kill from Murphy and a dink winner from Kelly Colwell. \nFalls, though, proved to be stronger down the stretch as Briana Garcia, Carlen Dietz Schaff and Dunbar rallied the Lady Knights to the win to even the match. \nIn game three, Falls held as much as an 11-7 lead and still had the edge at 21-19. This time, however, it was the Lady Mustangs rallying for the win. \nMurphy and Thomas each produced winners to tie the game at 21 before a Falls error gave Friendswood a 22-21 lead. A Garcia kill tied the game at 22, but that’s when Friendswood took control. \nA hitting error from Falls gave Friendswood a 23-22 edge before Colwell slammed two straight winners to give Friendswood a 2-1 lead in sets. \nGame four got out of hand quickly for Clear Falls as Friendswood jumped to an 8-3 lead with Colwell and Murphy accounting for 5 of those 8 points. \nGarcia scored two straight points for the Lady Knights to make it 8-5, but Friendswood was in control thereafter. \nAfter a three-point run for an 11-5 lead, the Lady Mustangs would lead by no fewer than five points the remainder of the way. \nDown the stretch, Faith Marabella came up with two big kills and Thomas produced a block winner off Dunbar. Leading 19-13, Friendswood scored six of the final eight points to cruise to the win. \n“We flip-flopped some hitters, and tried subbing, but there are only so many subs in a day,” Hodges said. “Errors will be the death of you. \n“When you give away too many free errors that aren’t forced, you won’t win. \n“We didn’t make anything happen. That’s not taking anything away from Friendswood. They played well and deserved to win.” \nKunefke said her team is starting to show some killer instinct. \n“I was proud of them for not giving up,” she said. “Not finishing game...that’s been the thorn in our heel. \n“Sarah Thomas played exceptionally well, and I think everybody fed off that. Our middles were consistent and not scared of the challenge of putting up the big block. \n“Clear Brook played well and beat us on our home court, and we didn’t want to hold back and go to five tonight. It was a huge win.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-07T06:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T05:37:57.214+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
