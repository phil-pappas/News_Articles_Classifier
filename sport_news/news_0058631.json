Not because of what he did on the court, but the selflessness he continued to show off of it. With first-year coach Fred Hoiberg set to tip-off the regular-season opener on Tuesday with Nikola Mirotic and Pau Gasol in the frontcourt, that means Noah and Taj Gibson will play the role of reserves.\nNothing new for Gibson, but for Noah, he’s been a starter since midway through his second NBA season.\n“I’m down with whatever coach says is best for the team,’’ Noah said this week. “I’m a worker, never gonna stop working.\n“It’s not about me or Taj. It’s about what we can do to make this team better. It is what it is. We gotta go out there and find ways to make it work. It’s definitely an adjustment but at the end of the day it’s basketball. I gotta go out there and bring energy and do what I do.’’\nAnd he did that in exhibition play, especially off the bench his last two games, grabbing 15 combined rebounds in two Bulls (4-4) wins. Even better for Noah? The left knee looked to have some life to it, and that’s what earned him high marks.\nTHE STARTERS\nGuard – Derrick Rose – Better late than never for Rose, as he overcame Sept. 30 surgery to repair a fractured orbital bone, making his preseason debut in the finale and scoring eight points in 10 minutes. GRADE: Incomplete\nGuard – Jimmy Butler – The new face of the franchise struggled from three-point range, hitting just 2-for-15, but showed that he remains the Swiss Army Knife for the team, doing it all on both ends of the court. GRADE: B\nForward – Tony Snell – The third-year player won the starting small forward vacancy, at least until Mike Dunleavy (back surgery) is able to return, and showed that he can be another defensive stopper. GRADE: B-\nForward – Nikola Mirotic – Mirotic has the green light in Hoiberg’s offense, and wasn’t afraid to speed through it, shooting 15-for-39 (38.4 percent) from beyond the three-point line. GRADE: B\nCenter – Pau Gasol – Coming off a summer of international play, Gasol’s goal was to stay healthy this preseason. He started just five games, averaging 22.8 minutes per game, but had no setbacks. GRADE: B+\nKEY RESERVES\nForward – Taj Gibson – Considering Gibson was sidelined all summer recovering from offseason ankle surgery, he was very good coming off the bench, averaging just under 11 points and six rebounds per game in limited minutes. GRADE: A-\nGuard – Aaron Brooks – Is what he is, which is instant offense, and at times a defensive liability. GRADE: B-\nGuard – Kirk Hinrich – Like Brooks, brought very few surprises to the table. Hinrich did get out of camp healthy, so win-win. GRADE: B-\nForward – Doug McDermott – It’s all about confidence for the second-year shooter, and it still seems to come and go. GRADE: C+\nGuard – E’Twaun Moore – One of the surprising backcourt players of preseason, and could push Brooks and Hinrich for playing time. GRADE: A-\nForward/Center – Bobby Portis – Had some rookie moments, but served notice that he is the future for the Bulls frontcourt.
