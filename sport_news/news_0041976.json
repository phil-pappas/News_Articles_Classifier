Like when they help scorned women expose the philandering professional athletes who run around on them.\nWarriors sharpshooter Klay Thompson knows what we're talking about . The 25-year-old has been dating Instagram pro Hannah Stocking for about a year now and over the weekend she aired some dirty laundry that would have never found an audience without Twitter.\nAnd now we know he's a cheater.\nThis seems like a good time to offer some advice to guys like Thompson and Victor Cruz, who found himself in a similar situation last week . So here it goes: If you want to sample from the buffet of women willing to throw themselves onto a professional athlete's sheets, by all means, do it. Just don't tell one of them you're finished eating and secretly keep re-filling your plate. That makes you an asshole. And if the girl looks like Stocking, it makes you an idiot too.\nSTOP.
