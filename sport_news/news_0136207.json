CBS Sports 128: 1-25 | 26-128 \nFor the first time in the 2015 season, Ohio State is not the No. 1 team in the CBS Sports 128. The Buckeyes have seen teams like Utah and Baylor close the gap on No. 1 in the polls, and in our survey of CBS Sports college football writers and experts, both teams have jumped ahead of the Buckeyes. \nUtah is the new No. 1 in our rankings, followed by Baylor, Clemson and then Ohio State. TCU, No. 5 a week ago, rounds out the top five of the polls after a second-half comeback at Kansas State kept the Frogs perfect in Big 12 play.\nFlorida continued its climb up the rankings -- the Gators were No. 22 just two weeks ago -- to No. 7, one spot behind No. 6 LSU heading into Saturday's rivalry game in Baton Rouge. Michigan moved up eight spots to No. 9, jumping over Michigan State (down five spots to No. 13) as those two teams prepare for a highly-anticipated Week 7 matchup.\nNorthwestern was not penalized for the shutout loss to the Wolverines, hanging on in the Top 25 at No. 20. The result was the same for Cal losing at Utah -- in fact the Bears did not move at all in the rankings, hanging tight at No. 22.\nOklahoma State was another big mover this week, up eight spots to No. 15 after beating West Virginia on the road. Oklahoma, meanwhile, dropped out of the top 10, from No. 7 to No. 21, after losing to Texas in the Red River Rivalry.\nHere's a breakdown how each conference fared in the top 25 of the CBS Sports 128 (highest-ranked team in parenthesis).\nSEC: 5 (No. 6 -- LSU)\nPac-12: 4 (No. 1 -- Utah)\nBig 12: 4 (No. 2 -- Baylor)\nACC: 2 (No. 3 -- Clemson)\nAmerican: 2 (No. 23 -- Houston)\nIndependent: 1 (No. 12 -- Notre Dame)\nMountain West: 1 (No. 19 -- Boise State)\nMAC: 1 (No. 24 -- Toledo)\nHere are the biggest risers and fallers after Week 6: \nRisers: Utah State , 58 (+26), Rice , 82 (+25), Bowling Green , 48 (+22), Maryland , 83 (+18), UConn , 92 (+18)\nFallers: Oregon , 72 (-32), Virginia , 97 (-26), Syracuse , 86 (-25), Missouri , 61 (-19), Central Michigan , 93 (-18), Hawaii , 110 (-18)\nUtah is the No. 1 team in the CBS Sports 128.
