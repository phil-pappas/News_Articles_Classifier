I am at a loss as to who might not pass one of these background checks. What seems to be gaining traction is “keeping guns out of the hands of those who might use them for nefarious purposes.” School shootings come to mind. The perpetrators are usually mentally deranged so it would make some kind of sense to make sure that they don’t get their hands on a weapon. So who are these people that might get on a list? I am assuming that federal privacy laws will have to be altered and possibly mental health professionals might have to turn over the names of patients. At the same time we are talking gun control we are talking about the shoddy state of mental health treatment in the United States: depression, teen suicides, etc. I wonder how many will come in for treatment if they think that just going in to talk about personal problems might put them on a gun ownership prohibited list. Our returning vets suffer from sky high suicide rates and the military ranks are filled with a disproportionately high rural recruitment rate, gun-owning rural America. Will our vets opt not to treat PTSD because they might never be allowed to own a gun because they saw a mental health professional at the VA? Domestic violence is another thing that can get you on a gun prohibited list. Are there any provisions to punish a vindictive domestic partner who would use gun control to punish a used to be significant other? What provisions are there for appeals? Drug possession felonies are sky high and felons are prohibited from owning a gun and many times that is a barrier to getting a nonviolent kid back into the rural lifestyle of hunting or carrying protection while alone in the mountains. The devil is in the details and we need to know just what details you have in mind, Hillary.
