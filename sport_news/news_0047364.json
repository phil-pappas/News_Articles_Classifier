(AP Photo/Bill Kostroun) By The Associated Press The Associated Press \nThe latest from NFL games around the league on the fifth Sunday of the season (all times EDT): \n10:47 p.m. \nThe Giants say Odell Beckham Jr has a hamstring injury and his return is questionable. \nBeckham apparently was hurt scoring on a 17-yard touchdown catch that gave New York a 20-13 lead. He had seven catches for 121 yards. San Francisco tied it with 11:49 to play on a 5-yard touchdown pass from Colin Kaepernick to Garrett Celek. \nNew York lost middle linebacker Jon Beason with a concussion in the first half. \n___ \n7:30 p.m. \nAfter all those tight early games, including three that went to OT, the 4 p.m. ET slate was a bit of a snoozefest. \nThe most noteworthy aspect of the late slate was gleaned by a glance at the records three of the teams ended up with: The Denver Broncos are 5-0, the New England Patriots are 4-0 ... and the Detroit Lions are 0-5. \nIn the closest game, the Denver Broncos held on to beat the Oakland Raiders 16-10, even though Charles Woodson picked off Peyton Manning twice to become, at age 39, the oldest player with two interceptions in an NFL game. \nThe Patriots collected a 30-6 victory over the Dallas Cowboys, who lost their third consecutive game without injured QB Tony Romo. \nAnd the Lions — 0-16 again, anyone? — benched Matthew Stafford after three interceptions in a 42-17 loss to the Arizona Cardinals. At 4-1, Arizona now has a two-game lead over Seattle. \nJust one game is left Sunday, and it doesn't necessarily shape up as a classic: The 49ers (1-3) are at the Giants (2-2) at night. \n___ \n6:25 p.m. \nFor the first 17 years of their NFL careers, Charles Woodson never picked off Peyton Manning once. In one day, Woodson's done it twice. \nIn addition, at age 39, the Raiders' cornerback became the oldest player ever with two interceptions in a game. Junior Seau did it at 38 in 2007. \n— Josh Dubow reporting from Oakland \n___ \n6:15 p.m. \nDetroit's Matthew Stafford has been benched early in the third quarter after throwing his third interception of the game against Arizona. \nDan Orlovsky took the field with the Lions down 35-7, and what was left of the Ford Field crowd greeted the backup's arrival with a big cheer. \nOrlovsky hadn't played in an NFL game since 2013 — and he last threw a pass in 2012. \n— Noah Trister reporting from Detroit \n___ \n5:55 p.m. \nBroncos pass rusher DeMarcus Ware is done for the day against the Raiders because of a back injury. \nWare left on a cart in the first half and was originally called questionable — but the Broncos said after halftime that Ware will not return Sunday. \nWare leads the Broncos with 4 1/2 sacks. \n— Josh Dubow reporting from Oakland \n___ \n5:35 p.m. \nCharles Woodson finally got that long-awaited interception against Peyton Manning. \nWoodson picked off Manning in the end zone in the closing seconds of the first half of Oakland's game against Denver. \nThe defensive back had intercepted passes from 40 quarterbacks in his career before Sunday — but none against Manning, the player he beat out for the 1997 Heisman Trophy. \nWoodson and Manning are two of three active players from the 1998 draft, along with Matt Hasselbeck. \nWoodson became the third player with an interception at age 39 or older. Darrell Green and Clay Matthews Sr. are the others. \n— Josh Dubow reporting from Oakland \n___ \n4:50 p.m. \nThe Cincinnati Bengals and Atlanta Falcons both had to work overtime to get to 5-0. \nCincinnati beat Seattle 27-24 on Mike Nugent's 42-yard field goal that bounced off the left upright on its way in with about 3 1/2 minutes left in the extra period, leaving the two-time NFC champion Seahawks at 2-3. \nAtlanta got past the Washington Redskins 25-19 on Robert Alford's 59-yard interception return for a touchdown off Kirk Cousins. \nThe Green Bay Packers are also 5-0, thanks to a 24-10 victory over the St. Louis Rams, despite Aaron Rodgers' first interceptions of the season. \nThere already has been a third OT game on Sunday, too: Cleveland edged Baltimore 33-30 on a field goal by Travis Coons. That dropped the Ravens to 1-4, last in the AFC North, way behind the Bengals. \nOther results from the 1 p.m. ET games: \n— Chicago 18, Kansas City 17; \n— Buffalo 14, Tennessee 13; \n— Philadelphia 39, New Orleans 17; \n— Tampa Bay 38, Jacksonville 31. \n___ \n4:40 p.m. \nChiefs coach Andy Reid says that the preliminary diagnosis on Jamaal Charles' injury is a torn ACL in the running back's right knee. \nReid says Charles will have an MRI exam on Monday. \nCharles left Kansas City's 18-17 loss to Chicago in the third quarter. \n— Dave Skretta reporting from Kansas City, Mo. \n___ \n4:25 p.m. \nThe fans in Detroit are making their feelings known about NFL officiating. \nA decent number of Lions fans booed the first penalty announcement of Sunday's game against Arizona — even though it was an offside call on the visiting Cardinals. Detroit is still steaming over the ending of Monday night's game at Seattle, when officials gave possession to the Seahawks instead of calling an illegally batted ball in the end zone. \n— Noah Trister reporting from Detroit \n___ \n2:55 p.m. \nChiefs running back Jamaal Charles left in the third quarter against the Bears with an injured right knee. \nHe was hurt on a carry deep in Chicago territory, as he was cutting left at the line. \nCharles didn't put any weight on his right leg while being helped off the field by a trainer and teammate Justin Houston. \n— Dave Skretta reporting from Kansas City, Mo. \n___ \n2:45 p.m. \nAt halftime, neither Julio Jones nor Roddy White had a single catch for the Falcons against the Redskins. \nAnd it's been a rough day for Atlanta kicker Matt Bryant, too. \nAtlanta is struggling to establish its passing game as Jones, who led the NFL with 38 catches entering Week 5, appears to be limited by a hamstring injury. Jones was listed as questionable but started. \nJones had no catches on four targets in the first half. White, who this week complained about his diminished role and then had a meeting with coach Dan Quinn, didn't even have a first-half target. \nLeonard Hankerson, who has emerged as one of quarterback Matt Ryan's top options, left the game with a rib injury and was questionable to return. \nAnd to make matters worse: Bryant has matching missed field-goal attempts — one off the right upright, one off the left upright. \n— Charles Odum reporting from Atlanta. \n___ \n2:35 p.m. \nSuddenly, Aaron Rodgers can't stop throwing interceptions. \nThe Packers QB entered Sunday with a clean sheet this season: 11 TD passes, zero interceptions. \nAnd he hadn't thrown a pick at home since December 2012. \nNow he's thrown the ball to the Rams twice in one half. Trumaine Johnson got the second takeaway, after James Laurinaitis made a diving catch of a tipped pass for Rodgers' first interception of the season. \nSo with the first half winding down, Rodgers and Rams QB Nick Foles have matching stats: one TD, two picks. \n— Genaro C. Armas reporting from Green Bay, Wis. \n___ \n2:20 p.m. \nThe Buffalo Bills are running out of running backs. \nIn the second quarter against the Titans, Cierre Wood was carted to the locker room with an injured knee that will keep him out the rest of the game. Wood only carried twice for 3 yards when hurt. \nAlready, LeSean McCoy was missing his second consecutive game trying to heal up his injured hamstring, while backup Karlos Williams was out as he recovers from a concussion. \nWood's departure leaves Buffalo very thin at running back, with Boobie Dixon and Boom Herron. The Titans outgained the Bills 170-51 in total offense during the first half, with Buffalo rushing for only 23 yards. The Titans led 3-0 at halftime. \n— Teresa M. Walker reporting from Nashville, Tenn. \n___ \nThe Legion of Boom is back in business. \nFor the first time this season, Seattle intercepted a pass. \nIt was safety Earl Thomas who broke the drought for the group that includes Richard Sherman and Kam Chancellor, picking off Bengals quarterback Andy Dalton on a pass underthrown for A.J. Green in the end zone. \nThis also was just Dalton's second interception all season; both have come in the end zone. \n— Joe Kay reporting from Cincinnati \n___ \n1:50 p.m. \nEagles quarterback Sam Bradford's passes keep getting caught in the end zone — but the problem is that the Saints are the ones hauling in the football. \nThe Eagles had a first down at New Orleans' 12 when Bradford was picked off by Brandon Browner in the end zone. \nAfter Drew Brees took advantage of the turnover by throwing a TD pass for a 7-0 lead, Philadelphia's next possession ended this way: Devin Breaux intercepted Bradford's pass from the 14 — yep, you got it — in the end zone. \n— Rob Maaddi reporting from Philadelphia \n___ \nAaron Rodgers just threw an interception at Lambeau Field. \nRepeat: Aaron Rodgers just threw an interception at Lambeau field. \nHadn't happened in nearly three full years — since Dec. 2, 2012, when Vikings safety Harrison Smith picked him off on a flea-flicker. \nBut in the first quarter of the Packers' game against the visiting Rams on Sunday, a throw by two-time NFL MVP Rodgers was tipped at the line and linebacker James Laurinaitis made a diving catch for the interception. \n___ \n1:20 p.m. \nSo it IS possible to score a touchdown against Seattle's defense. \nCincinnati quickly ended the Seahawks' streak of not allowing a TD over their opponents' last 20 offensive series. \nAndy Dalton led Cincinnati 86 yards in seven plays after the opening kickoff, hitting an uncovered Tyler Eifert for an 11-yard touchdown pass. \nSeattle's D had allowed a grand total of only one field goal in the previous 20 offensive series, a run that started during a loss to Green Bay in Week 2 and covered victories over Chicago in Week 3 and Detroit in Week 4. \n— Joe Kay reporting from Cincinnati \n___ \n1:10 p.m. \nBills wide receiver Marcus Easley just saved Bishop Sankey and the Tennessee Titans from an ugly mistake to open their game. \nSankey muffed the kickoff, and the Titans were lucky that Craig Stevens recovered the ball at the Tennessee 2 — even though a couple of Bills thought they recovered the ball. \nStill, what could have been a big play to open the game for Rex Ryan's Bills turned into just the latest Buffalo bungle on a penalty call, because an official threw a flag to call Easley for being offside on the kickoff. \nThat forced another kick, and the Titans started their first drive at their own 23 rather than the 2. \n— Teresa M. Walker reporting from Nashville, Tenn. \n___ \n9:15 a.m. \nJacksonville Jaguars tight end Julius Thomas is expected to make his season debut at Tampa Bay. \nThe team says Thomas is \"likely\" to play against the Buccaneers (1-3) on Sunday. \nThomas practiced this week without a cast for the first time since breaking his right hand in the preseason opener Aug. 14. He had surgery Sept. 2. \nThomas caught 108 passes and 24 touchdowns the last two years in Denver. He signed a five-year, $46 million contract with Jacksonville in free agency in March. \nThe Jaguars (1-3) expect Thomas, when fully healthy, to be a significant part of the passing game. They need a proven playmaker to help take some pressure off second-year receivers Allen Robinson and Allen Hurns. \n___ \nAP NFL websites: http://pro32.ap.org and http://twitter.com/AP_NFL Copyright The Associated Press", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T05:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T07:43:40.893+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
