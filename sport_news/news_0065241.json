The most obvious connection stems from March 28, when Coyotes captain Shane Doan blasted Penguins defenseman Kris Letang into the boards at Consol Energy Center , ending Letang's season and possible bid for a Norris Trophy with a concussion. Letang downplayed the significance of Saturday night's game being the first meeting between the teams since that hit, although he did appreciate Doan reaching out at the time. “It's always going to be on my mind,” Letang said Saturday following morning skate at IceDen, the Coyotes' practice facility. “But you know what? It was a hockey play. It wasn't necessarily a dirty play. It's not something I' Defenseman Zbynek Michalek played in Pittsburgh from 2010-12 and now gets third-pairing minutes in Arizona. He scored the Coyotes' first goal during a 4-1 win at Los Angeles on Friday. Joe Vitale, a Penguin from 2010-14, was a healthy scratch Friday. Even Coyotes coach Dave Tippett played in Pittsburgh for a year. Meanwhile, Steve Downie spent only one year as a Penguin — last season — but he is never one to go unnoticed, whether playing with him or against him. Downie has been skating on Arizona's fourth line and made rookie Max Domi's first career goal Friday possible by clearing space. He even retrieved the puck for him afterward. In 2014-15, Downie scored 14 goals and racked up a league-high 238 penalties minutes, numbers that perfectly underscore the yin and yang of his game. “He's a guy you have to be aware of on the ice,” Letang said. “He's not only a guy who brings energy; he's a good hockey player. He makes plays.” An argument could be made that Saturday's game would show which Penguins Downie liked and which ones he did not. Coach Mike Johnston, however, said that wouldn't necessarily be the case. Downie play “Watching Downs play (Friday) night, I thought he played an effective game for them,” Johnston said. “We all know how Downs can be. He goes with the way the game's going. If he feels he needs to stir it up physically, he' Jason Mackey is a staff writer for Trib Total Media.
