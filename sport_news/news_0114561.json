Whether it’s Ray Rice only being suspended for two games after knocking his fiancee unconscious or the entire Patriots’ “Deflategate” scandal, which smacked Tom Brady with an over-the-top, four-game suspension, Roger Goodell and the NFL seem to make the wrong calls more often than not. As if those offenses aren’t bad enough, defensive end Greg Hardy returned to the league earlier this month after missing only four games due to domestic violence charges from May 2014. What did he do upon his return? He made comments such as “You seen [Brady’s] wife? I hope she comes to the game. I hope her sister comes to the game,” and about how he wants to see Brady “the same way I did last time I saw him, hopefully on the ground.” This obviously proves what a standup guy he is, yet the Dallas Cowboys and the NFL have welcomed him back with open arms. The video in which his statements were made was published on the NFL website without a single word of criticism, right underneath the NFL logo with its breast cancer awareness ribbon, an obvious showcase of its support of women. However, last week when Pittsburgh Steelers running back DeAngelo Williams asked the NFL if he could continue wearing pink accessories outside of October in memory of his mother and other women who have lost their battles with breast cancer, he was told that, if he did, he would be in violation of the league’s strict uniform policy that there was absolutely no exception to. His teammate, defensive end Cameron Heyward, was fined after Monday night’s game against the San Diego Chargers for adding the words “Iron Head” to his eye black in honor of his father, who lost his cancer battle in 2006. As someone who loves football and watches as many games as possible each week, it’s heartbreaking to know that an organization I once admired can’t seem to tell the difference between right and wrong. Instead of focusing on uniforms or the PSI level of a football, maybe the NFL should take a look in the mirror and realize that it’s the problem. If you can support women enough to dedicate an entire month to pink jerseys, cleats, gloves and spirit wear, maybe you can stop allowing players who represent your organization to beat women and come right back. Giving these players ludicrous punishments which inevitably get reduced or overturned because they’re deemed not appropriate in the first place and then turning around and fining players for wearing the wrong thing proves just how out of touch and hypocritical the NFL is. Higher standards need to be set for players and decision makers alike, because these inconsistencies in what is and isn’t accepted within the organization prove that something needs to change. I’ve already lost most of my respect for the NFL and if things continue to go down the path they are, I can pretty much guarantee that I won’t be the only one.
