(Photo: Justin Torner/For the Press-Citizen) \n1. DOWLING CATHOLIC (7-0, 4-0) \nLast week: 1 \nThe only team staying put this week is the one on top. The Maroons handled what they had to against winless Des Moines Roosevelt, with J.T Brown and Kurt Walding combining for 14-of-21 passing for 191 yards and four touchdowns, and no running back taking more than nine carries. Reserves should keep being rotated in following the 49-0 win as Des Moines North (1-7) is next. \n2. CEDAR RAPIDS KENNEDY (8-0, 4-0) \nLast week: 4 \nFew defenses across the state can best what the Cougars have done in district play, let alone in Class 4A with familiar opposition. Kennedy allowed Cedar Falls just 31 yards through three quarters of Friday's 21-7 win, and has allowed just 27 total points in its last six victories. Add in 38 more carries and 189 yards for senior Tyler Dralle and the Cougars are a force to be reckoned with. \n3. BETTENDORF (8-0, 3-0) \nLast week: 2 \nQuarterback Owen Ridenour has gotten outstanding support all season from a powerful run game, a sizeable offensive line and Bettendorf's stout defense. But in the 51-14 win over Dubuque Senior, the senior proved he's capable of carrying the load, going 11-of-14 passing for 147 yards and two scores and rushing 11 times for 96 yards and another touchdown. \n4. CEDAR RAPIDS WASHINGTON (7-1, 4-0) \nLast week: 7 \nInjuries have forced the Warriors into a quarterback carousel, but their early 27-0 lead at Iowa City High on Friday included back-to-back defensive scores. That will take some pressure off. The run game has been nearly as strong for last year's 4A runner-up, with Tavian Patrick rushing for 160 of the team's 306 yards in the district-clinching win . \n5. PELLA (8-0, 5-0) \nLast week: 6 \nSenior Josh Zemanek got to lead the Dutch in rushing against Saydel after taking just 10 carries all season. Pella plowed past yet another 3A foe — the total score from the last three weeks is 151-16 — with nine different players getting carries, led by Zemanek's 52 yards and a touchdown. \n6. WAUKEE (6-2, 4-0) \nLast week: 10 \nA last-second field goal took down Fort Dodge and gave the Warriors control of 4A-4. Waukee has beaten three previous Super 10 squads on its five-game win streak, with Skyler Crew's kick and 254 yards passing from Ben Ferkin making the difference in Friday's 31-28 victory. \n7. WEST DELAWARE (8-0, 5-0) \nLast week: 8 \nIndependence was an outstanding opponent, but it couldn't keep Coy Roussell down. West Delaware won the all-important battle of unbeaten teams in 3A-3 thanks to Roussell's 42-yard touchdown run with less than four minutes left. The top rusher in 3A was held to a season-low 89 yards, but the score was decisive in a physical 13-9 win. \n8. ANKENY (7-1, 4-0) \nLast week: NR \nThe winners of six straight have set up a tilt with Southeast Polk to decide 4A-1. Ian Faeth and Nathan Champagne each rushed in two touchdowns in a 49-12 win over Council Bluffs Thomas Jefferson last week, the third straight win for the Hawks by at least five touchdowns. Only Dowling Catholic is hotter in the CIML. \n9. W.D.M. VALLEY (6-2, 3-1) \nLast week: 3 \nFirst place in district play has slipped away, so the Tigers have to focus on moving on from Friday's painful loss to Ankeny Centennial . Rocky Lombardi completed 22 passes for 286 yards, but Centennial picked off the junior twice and forced a timely fumble. Valley has the talent to get back on track, but did the loss provide a blueprint for opposing defenses? \n10. ALBIA (8-0, 5-0) \nLast week: 9 \nAnother huge district showdown, another Albia blowout. No. 6 PCM was the next challenger for the top team in 2A and it got a heavy dose of the Blue Demons' dominance in a 42-6 game. Senior Carter Isley had his usual 177 yards and two touchdowns rushing, but added a 73-yard touchdown catch too. \nStarting in the 2015 season, The Register is ranking the best football teams in Iowa, regardless of class and school size.
