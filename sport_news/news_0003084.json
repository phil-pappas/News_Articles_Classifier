And Hawaii. Fresno State and San Diego State, too. And while we’re at it, UNLV should feel like it’s the team to beat as well. That’s just how the division stacks up this season. \nThe headline from this week’s Nevada-UNLV game is over the Fremont Cannon and what color it will be after Saturday’s game at Mackay Stadium. It’s easy to overlook an equally large story. The Wolf Pack kicks off conference play Saturday as it hunts for its first MW divisional or conference title. \nAnd sitting before Nevada (as well SJSU, Hawaii, Fresno State, SDSU and UNLV) is a golden opportunity. \n“Right now, there are a lot of people trying to figure out who that team is that has the best opportunity to win the West and who the team to beat really is,” UNLV’s first-year coach Tony Sanchez said. Coach Rolo's funny introduction to Nevada-UNLV rivalry \nThe MW’s West Division had a brutal non-conference run, going 2-13 against FBS teams while being outscored, on average, 35.3-17.3. Granted, a lot of these games were against Power 5 teams, but of the 18 divisions in the FBS, the MW West division ranks as the fifth weakest, per the Sagarin ratings. \nThis is the second straight season the West has been among the worst as it ranked as the third-weakest division in the nation last year. Nevada wasn’t able to take advantage of that situation, losing to Fresno State at home in the de facto West Division title game and allowing a 6-8 Bulldog team to win the West. \nTruly, there is no top dog in the West Division, no clear favorite and no obvious doormat. You could realistically paint a scenario in which any of the six teams in the division come in first or come in last. \nWould you laugh if I told you Nevada won the West this year? How about Fresno State? San Diego State? Hawaii? UNLV? There might be a laugh on UNLV, but the rest seem entirely plausible. \n“I think everybody on this side has a fair shot at it, and that includes UNLV,” Nevada’s Brian Polian said. \nThat’s why Nevada should feel like it’s the favorite. There’s no team the Wolf Pack should be scared of in the West, no team that’s clear-cut better than everybody else. And the Wolf Pack schedule is a big boost. \nSince the MW plays an unbalanced schedule, Nevada only draws three of the six teams from the Mountain. This year, the Wolf Pack avoids the Mountain’s three best teams (Boise State, Air Force and Colorado State) and plays Wyoming, New Mexico and Utah State, who are a combined 0-6 in non-conference play against FBS opponents. The schedule is set up for the Wolf Pack to win the West. \nAt some point, the West Division will improve. San Diego State will eventually find a quarterback to go with its typically strong defense. Fresno State will eventually get it rolling again. San Jose State, Hawaii and UNLV will eventually pick themselves off the mat, with that potentially happening this season. \nBut until those things happen, Nevada can’t let another opportunity pass. With the West weak, the Wolf Pack must strike. It must turn a favorable league schedule and a down division into some hardware. \nTo do that, Nevada has to play better than it has in the first month. The offense has to improve. The pass game must become crisper. The run game must grow more consistent. Nevada’s defense has to get better, too. It has to limit the big plays that come too often and continue to improve in the secondary. The penalties – Nevada averages seven for nearly 70 yards per game – need to disappear. Wolf Pack QB Tyler Stewart gets his shot to beat UNLV \nImprovements must be made, and if they are, Nevada can win the West, just like every other team in the West. There’s no Boise State standing in the way like all of the teams in the Mountain Division face. \n“Every team has a legitimate shot at it,” Sanchez said. “It’s going to come down to who stays the healthiest, whose quarterback’s is playing the best, which defense is creating the most turnovers and things like that. There are a lot of little things that will come into the fold on who wins this thing.” \nIf Wolf Pack fans want a reason to be optimistic, history will give you that. Nevada has a long history of special seasons in five-year increments. The Wolf Pack won the Big Sky in 1990, the Big West in 1995, the WAC in 2005 and the WAC again in 2010. Is another conference title in line in 2015? \nThe golden opportunity is sitting there. The question is whether Nevada will grab it this time. \nColumnist Chris Murray provides insight on Northern Nevada sports.
