However, Everton, beaten 3-0 at Manchester United last weekend, remained resolute with plenty of attacking intentions themselves as the rain drizzled down on the slick Emirates Stadium pitch.On 28 minutes, a cutback from Aaron Lennon through the six-yard box was only palmed away by Cech - but Everton defender John Stones could only hack the loose ball wide as it spun up off his shin.After soaking up plenty of pressure in the rain, Arsenal swept into the lead on 36 minutes.Ozil found himself in some space on the right and delivered a superb floating cross over the Everton defence for Giroud to steal in behind and send a backward header past Howard.Before Everton could regroup, they were 2-0 down.This time it was Santi Cazorla with the pinpoint ball in, whipping a free-kick on the left through the six-yard box - where Koscielny got in on the blind-side to nod in a second goal.Everton were, however, quickly handed a way back into the match a minute before the break.Barkley broke down left and drilled an angled shot goalwards from 25 yards, which took a wicked deflection off the trailing leg of Gabriel and flew past Cech.The match remained very open in the second half as both defences were stretched on the break.Giroud was inches away from a second goal on 68 minutes when Ozil delivered another slide-rule pass and the French forward lofted the ball over Howard, but was denied by the crossbar.The visitors were soon close to an equaliser when Lukaku got up to head a cross from Barry onto the top of the crossbar.As the clock ran down, Everton continued to press and Deulofeu found himself in space on the right side of a crowded penalty area - but Cech was out quickly to make a superb block.In stoppage time, Ozil was unfortunate not to add a third for Arsenal when his low 18-yard effort struck the base of the post.Barry was shown a second yellow card for a trip on substitute Kieran Gibbs as Everton finished with 10 men.
