(Overall record and previous week in parenthesis) PICK 6 AREA GAMES FOR A SHOT AT ANDY'S FROZEN CUSTARD 1. Webb City (8-0, 1) – The Ozark Tigers became the Cardinals’ 81 st straight Missouri victim Friday night, but as usual credit Coach Rod and the Webb City staff for a classy 35-7 victory rather than running it up in the 2 nd half. Nate Deadmond had a big game with a receiving touchdown, interception and kickoff return touchdown, but the best news was the healthy return of quarterback Tyson Roderique. The Cards already wrapped up a share of their 8 th straight COC Large title and will pick up the outright crown this Friday against Branson. 2. Lamar (8-0, 2) – Danny Embry and Stuart McKarus rushed for over 100 yards apiece as the Tigers racked up over 400 yards on the ground in a 41-0 shutout of Aurora Friday night. The win was the Tigers’ 33 rd in 35 games dating back to week 4 of the 2013 season, but it’s those two losses that weight heavy on their minds; both one possession defeats at the hands of Carl Junction. The “Brotherhood” gets one last shot at redemption this Friday as the host CJ for the outright Big 8 title and you can bet the streets of Lamar will be like a ghost town at 7:00 pm. 3. Skyline (8-0, 5) – The Tigers are noted for their high-flying passing attack, but on Friday it was the “getting and going” rushing attack that propelled the #3 team in Class 1 past the #2 team in Class 1 (Marionville) to a 58-37 Mid-Lakes Conference title clinching home victory. Dylan Mountain and Chipper Berry led the charge with 157 and 155 yards respectively. Coach Shelby’s cats can now turn their attention to districts where they are the top seed in a district that includes 8-0, 5 th ranked Lincoln. MOHAWK CHRONICLES: Week 8 Recap 4. Carl Junction (8-0, 4) – It feels like the Bulldogs have quietly been one of the most dominant teams in the state this season, rolling to 8-0 with a 63-28 Senior Night win over Seneca Friday night. Dominic Burnett found pay dirt four times and racked up 162 yards on the ground despite just six carries; now that’s production! The schedule has been soft to say the last for the Class 4 2 nd ranked Bulldogs, but that changes this week as they shoot for a third straight Big 8 title (in their farewell to the conference) as they visit four-time defending Class 2 state champ Lamar; a team they’ve beaten on the final play the last two seasons. 5. Kickapoo (8-0, 7) – There was some dissension in our office prior to the season on whether or not the Chiefs could live up to their potential and not only win the Ozark Conference but compete in the Class 6 playoffs. Well, they’ve done all of that and more. Friday night’s 49-21 win at Lebanon proved they are the real deal and locked up the district top seed. Malachi Stout rushed for three touchdowns, caught two more and added a return score to make it a clean half dozen touchdowns on the night. The Chiefs will host their way through the districts against the best Kansas City has to offer, but you can bet Coach Thompson’s team has its attention squarely on Waynesville this week after the Tigers upset the Chiefs last year costing them a share of the OC title. 6. MV-BT/Liberty (8-0, 8) – The Eagles haven’t just been winning, they’ve been dominating this season; winning by an average margin of 29 points per game, including Friday’s 47-13 win against a solid Salem team. The Eagles sealed up at least a share of the SCA title behind six more touchdowns from quarterback Josh Pruett, but they need to keep the pedal to the metal this week against Houston as Thayer and Mountain Grove still have a chance to share the title. Liberty has already locked up the district top seed and will be a heavy favorite. 7. Carthage (7-1, 9) – Since a season opening loss to Webb City the Tigers have passed every test with flying colors, including a 26-14 win against Nixa last Friday. Are they the best Class 5 team in Southwest Missouri? It would appear so, and they’ll have a chance to further solidify that statement with a regular season ending trip to Willard this Friday; a game they need to leap frog Sedalia Smith-Cotton for district top seed. 8. West Plains (7-1, 6) – Yes, the Zizzers were doubled up by Kickapoo, but playing up two classes on the road against a Top 10 ranked team I’d say that’s understandable. Last week the Zizzers bounced back with a dominating 43-21 win over Parkview. Just a trip to Rolla stands in their way of a fantastic 8-1 regular season, but with the district number two seed nearly locked up you can bet Coach Ary and this senior-heavy squad is thinking more than just a “good” season. Bring on CJ and Webb City! 9. Marionville (7-1, 3) – The Comets took their first loss of the season Friday night at Skyline and while there are no excuses you have to factor in several key injuries that left Marionville with just 21 players in uniform. I still think Marionville is the second best team in our area in Class 1, especially if they can get healthy by districts, but the gap is closing as Thayer, Lockwood, Jasper and Lincoln are nipping on their heels. 10. Monett (6-2, 10) – As much as I’d love to give this spot to any of the undefeated teams knocking on the door I still feel confident the Cubs are the top Class 3 team in our area. After all, those teams didn’t have to face Lamar and Carl Junction. Give me Cameron Witt, John Saunders, Michael Branch and that purple haze defense and I think you have a recipe for another district championship and maybe even a return trip to the semifinals. Reeds Spring has already locked up the district top seed and certainly has all the bulletin board material they need to avenge last year’s district championship loss on their home grass. Knocking on the door: Thayer, Lockwood, Reeds Spring, Mountain Grove, Bolivar, Jasper, Lincoln, Nixa Filed Under :", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T22:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T00:06:32.951+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
