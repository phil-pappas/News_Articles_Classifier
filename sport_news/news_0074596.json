It's Williams' fourth win on the Charles River and ended a three-year streak of no titles. \nCoach Kate Maloney's first varsity boat covered the course in 17 minutes, 25 seconds. The Ephs beat Mercyhurst (17:31) by six seconds. NESCAC rival Bates was third and Wellesley was fourth. \n\"I don't draw any straight lines. I don't think it hurts their confidence and their belief in themselves,\" Maloney said last night. \nWilliams last won on the Charles in 2011, and had also claimed wins in 2010 and 2008. \n\"I wasn't expecting this,\" said Maloney, whose first year at Williams was 2011. \"I wasn't surprised they were able to go out and generate some speed.\" \nLouisa Abel is the coxswain for the Ephs, and the boat was powered by Anne Tewksbury, Sophie Jannetty, Emily Strawn, Gemma Holt, Eileen Russell, Roberta Miller, Clara Beery and Katie Costantini. \nWILLIAMS MEN'S SOCCER \nAt Babson Park, Williams erupted for four goals in the first half and routed Babson 7-2. Advertisement \nMark Sisco-Tolomeo scored two goals for the Ephs (6-4-2). \nChristian Alcorn played the first half for Williams in goal, did not give up a score and made two saves. Bobby Schneiderman surrendered two second-half goals to Babson (7-6-2). \nGeoff Danilack and Mohammed Rashid each scored a goal and had two assists for the Ephs. High schools \nWAHCONAH GIRLS 2, HAMPSHIRE REGIONAL 0 \nSaturday night in Dalton, host Wahconah controlled much of the game, but needed two second-half goals to pull off the victory. \nJocelyn Hill broke the scoreless tie on a goal in the 56th minute and then with under four minutes to go, Amelia Dougherty set up Perin Genaway for the insurance tally. \n\"Our two goals were the result of strong efforts on the part of the goal scorers and Amelia Dougherty,\" Wahconah coach Pat West wrote in an email. \nThe Wahconah defense, led by Ashley Zink and Gianna Moncecchi helped limit the work goalkeeper Kayla Kowalczyk had to do. Kowalczyk made three saves as the Warriors had a 23-3 shot advantage. \n———", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T14:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T21:02:19.170+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
