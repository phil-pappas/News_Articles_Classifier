If he suffers no reaction Giteau is in line for his 100th cap. \n“Giteau didn’t train yesterday, but is OK to train today,” said Cheika. \n“The other two we read as we go. We have two sessions today so they will maybe do one of the two.” \nCheika will name his team tomorrow. \nMeanwhile, Scotland’s Ross Ford and Jonny Gray are out of the World Cup after being suspended on Tuesday for three weeks each for dangerous tackles. \nIt was the worst possible news for Scotland losing hooker Ford and lock Gray ahead of their quarterfinal against Australia at Twickenham. \nThey were cited after Scotland’s final pool match against Samoa. \nIf Scotland goes all the way to the final they only have three matches left. \nBoth players denied the charge and have 48 hours to appeal. \nDetails of the specific incidents have not been released, however, judicial officer Christopher Quinlan ruled “each player committed an act of foul play contrary to law. \n“Tackles involving a player being lifted off the ground and tipped horizontally and were then either forced or dropped to the ground must be dealt with severely by match officials and all those involved in the disciplinary process.” \nFord was accused of a dangerous tackle and Gray was said to have committed an illegal tip tackle during the 36-33 win that secured Scotland’s place in the last eight.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T19:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T01:44:23.254+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
