Residents of nearby Shiv Basti are quite annoyed at industrial effluents flowing out of Divya Pharmacy in a drain that passes through their area and finally falls into the Ganga. Perturbed at the indifferent attitude and inaction by Divya Pharmacy, Shiv Basti residents had also staged a protest outside the pharmacy gate. Raju, a resident, says the drain that passes through their houses is full of industrial effluents coming from Divya Pharmacy and finally flow into the Ganga. They face a constant threat of health hazards as Divya Pharmacy has neither fully covered the drain nor has it a sewage treatment plant. Meanwhile, despite repeated attempts the Divya Pharmacy manager was not available for comments. A security guard-cum-receptionist said they could not allow any outsider to enter the factory premises.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T06:01:20.057+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
