The Clippers will play the Hornets on Wednesday in Shanghai before returning to Southern California. \nSitting out exhibition games in China has become something of a routine for Paul, who sat out one of two games there against the Miami Heat in 2012 before being cleared to play after offseason thumb surgery. \nThe Clippers were also without Austin Rivers against the Hornets after the reserve guard told reporters he had five teeth knocked out inadvertently by an elbow from rookie Brandon Dawson in practice Friday. Rivers, who had the teeth reimplanted during a 2ï»¿1/2-hour surgery, is expected to sit out the next exhibition game as well. \nJeremy Lin scored 16 points for the Hornets. Lin, the first NBA player of Taiwanese descent, wore a new spiky hairdo and triggered cheers when he addressed spectators before the game. \nBut spectators saved their loudest roars for Michael Jordan when the Hornets owner was introduced late in the first half. Soccer Advertisement Earthquakes forward Chris Wondolowski was among players released from camp as the U.S. soccer team prepared for an exhibition against Costa Rica on Tuesday. \nA day after the Americans lost to Mexico in the playoff for CONCACAF's spot in the 2017 Confederations Cup, coach Jurgen Klinsmann announced his roster for the game in Harrison, New Jersey. \nOthers released from the roster were Michael Bradley, Clint Dempsey, DaMarcus Beasley, Matt Besler, Kyle Beckerman, Graham Zusi and goalkeeper Nick Rimando. \nTuesday's exhibition is the United States' final match before the start of qualifying for the 2018 World Cup. WNBA Shenise Johnson scored 15 points and Marissa Coleman added 14 to help the Indiana Fever beat the Minnesota Lynx 75-69 in Indianapolis, forcing a decisive Game 5 in the WNBA Finals. \nIndiana is 5-0 in elimination games this postseason and 9-2 since the 2012 playoffs, when it beat Minnesota for its lone title. \nGame 5 is Wednesday night in Minnesota. \nThe Fever had just one basket in the fourth quarter, a jumper by Johnson with 2:39 left that ended a long field goal drought and gave them some breathing room. They hit 15 free throws in the quarter to maintain their lead. \nMoore, who hit the buzzer-beater to win Game 3, led Minnesota with 20 points. Lindsay Whalen added 16. \nThis is the first WNBA Finals to go five games since 2009, when the Fever lost to Phoenix. Minnesota is trying to win its third title in five seasons. Miscellany Japan defeated the United States 28-18 to complete pool play in the Rugby World Cup in Gloucester, England. Despite winning three of four pool matches, Japan did not advance to the quarterfinals. \nNovak Djokovic defeated Rafael Nadal 6-2, 6-2 to win his sixth China Open title and improve his record at the Beijing tournament to 29-0.
