Seriously, I texted Torts this morning,” Hartley said after Wednesday’s practice at the Saddledome. “I have a long history with Torts. Cornwall and Rochester, Atlanta and Tampa Bay, over here and Vancouver … It seems that we’re like spaghetti and meatballs — we were always side by side. But now, it’s going to be friendlier. He’s on the eastern side, and I’m on the western side.” \nQuestion is, did Torts return that text? \n“I didn’t see yet,” said Hartley, whose squad has stumbled to a 1-5-0 start. “I was in many meetings. I had longer meetings than Torts this morning.” \nwes.gilbertson@sunmedia.ca", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T07:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T08:45:55.733+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
