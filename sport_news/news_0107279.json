We’re into the next round.” \nSouth Africa also has wall-to-wall television coverage of games, with a host of experts calling the matches from former Springboks coach Nick Mallett to ex-All Blacks skipper Taine Randall and retired England star Lewis Moody. \nHundreds of supporters have gathered around big screens across Johannesburg for a pre-match “braai” (barbecue) and plenty of beer. \nBut despite the crowds on match days the national mood has been more subdued than in 2011 when South Africa was widely expected to retain their title. \nFans have been encouraged to wear Springbok jerseys on Fridays and while many have, support has been lukewarm and far fewer national flags have been flying from offices, homes and cars than four years ago. \nThe Springboks’ 34-32 loss to Japan in their opening match in England also sent a huge jolt through the proud rugby nation. Many fans, meanwhile, said they couldn’t make the trip to England to support their side, blaming a fall in the rand. \nArgentina’s surprise run has also suffered from the time difference with England, with just a few Australian, British and Georgian expatriates spotted in Buenos Aires sports bars to watch the matches. \nA photo of Juan Imhoff diving for Argentina’s third try against Ireland shared the front page of the Ole sports daily on Monday with top football side Boca Juniors, who are close to claiming their 31st Argentinian title. \nAnd this Sunday when Argentina faces a tough clash with Australia, many Argentines will be more worried about a political scrum — the first round of presidential elections to see who will take over after 12 years under Nestor and Cristina Kirchner. — AFP", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T08:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T09:07:18.553+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
