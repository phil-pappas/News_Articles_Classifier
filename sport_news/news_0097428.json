However, the good news for the two-time champion is that the only man ahead of him in the world standings, Valentino Rossi, could only manage seventh place. \nMarquez's team-mate Dani Pedrosa was pushed on to the second row in fourth, alongside LCR Honda's Cal Crutchlow in fifth and Team Suzuki Ecstar's Maverick Vinales in sixth. \nRossi in seventh will be alongside Aleix Espargaro (Suzuki Ecstar) and his brother Pol in ninth. \nBrits Scott Redding (11th) and Bradley Smith (12th) are on the fourth row alongside Andrea Dovizioso.
