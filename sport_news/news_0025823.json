Their four losses are to four ranked teams. I believe, it was just pointed out to me, that those four teams are 19-1. So they've probably played the toughest schedule to this point of anybody in the country with a couple of tight losses to Cal and Oklahoma State. We understand they'll work hard and they'll play hard. There's a lot of good football players out there as you watch them and put on the tape. I know coach [Charlie] Strong and his staff do an excellent job. We've got to keep preparing to be our best. We're not even five games into [the season], so we've got to really push to make our improvement. I'm still really angry with our team, disappointed, on our lack of discipline. We've got way too many foolish penalties that will hurt us. We continue to have two turnovers a game, which can't happen. We've got to do some things across the board in every area to get better. That's what we're really going to focus on this week.\"\nOn his team's approach to preparing for games:\n\"They've been nothing but [serious about preparation] so far, so I don't expect that to change all of a sudden in one week. They're very aware. In fact, Ty [Darlington] stopped by my office yesterday and was just reminiscing two years ago and how bad they beat us. We're all very aware of it.\"\nOn Jerrod Heard's impact on the offense:\n\"He has [given the Longhorns a spark]. He's an exceptional player, an exceptional athlete. When you watch him he throws a nice ball, he runs. We're very aware of how talented he is. We'll have to play well against him.\"\nOn correcting that discipline issue he mentioned in his opening statement:\n\"More than anything it's their discipline. Players taking the attitude that they're going to do things the right way. If I have one beef with our guys it's that. They've got to have a mindset to do things right and have discipline in it. Hopefully they will.\"\nOn if he's concerned with the amount of hits Baker Mayfield has taken this year:\n\"It's always a concern. You don't want your quarterback to ever be hit. When they blitz as much as they did the other day, two things; a couple instances he [Mayfield] knows we don't have enough people there to block them. He's got to get rid of the ball. Some of it is on him. The other part, with him scrambling and moving around, it's going to happen on occasion. You just gotta try and limit it.\"\nOn if it's difficult to control social media use of the players:\n\"I don't try to. What matters to me is if you're sitting there reading comments from all these other fans at other schools, to me it's foolish. If that's what you need, whatever. Have at it. As long as the information you're putting out from your phone is your personal information, not team or anything about the team or anything associated with us because then it's like you just held your own press conference. That part of it is off limits. If you want to tell everybody you're at the grocery store picking up Twinkies, have at it. But if you're telling them what's happening in our building, now that's a problem.\"\nTwitter: @Josh_Friemel\nOn Twitter:\n @Josh_Friemel", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/Josh_Friemel", "https://twitter.com/Josh_Friemel"], "published": "2015-10-05T22:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T06:37:39.796+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
