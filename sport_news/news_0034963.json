Hopefully, we can carry this momentum forward with us and win some more games.”Region 5 champion Woodstock (24-5) will host Kennesaw Mountain in the second round beginning next Wednesday.The Lady Wolverines took Game 1 in walk-off fashion when Reese Dennis scored from second on a throwing error in the bottom of the seventh to break a scoreless tie.The inning began with Reese reaching base on an error. After Breanna Roper’s bunt single, Alisha House laid down another bunt that was fielded and thrown into left field.Woodstock had chances to score earlier in the game, but the Dacula defense prevented any runners from crossing the plate. A catch on a hard-hit line drive by Danielle Rubin left the bases loaded in the fifth, and a relay throw from center field nailed a Woodstock runner at the plate in the sixth.Dacula also had its chances, but Bishop proved to be too much for the Lady Falcons. She allowed just two hits while striking out 10, including two to leave the bases loaded in the fourth.As good as she was in Game 1, Bishop looked even better in the second, taking a no-hitter into the fifth inning before Dacula figured her out for three hits and two runs.Rubin, however, rescued her teammate.After entering the game with runners on first and third with no outs, the senior retired the next three batter to hold the Lady Wolverines’ 3-2 lead. Rubin maintained that dominance through the next two innings, allowing just one baserunner to secure the win.Offense came easier for Woodstock in the second game. A pair of doubles from Roper and Rubin gave Woodstock a 1-0 lead in the first inning, and Lexi Solorzano’s single in the third drove in Roper and House for a 3-0 lead.The game was played in front of a raucous home crowd that received warnings from umpires, but Dempsey said the crowd was a big help to her team.“The crowd was huge,” she said. “I want to give a big shoutout to all the fans who made it out. They’ve been out here all year, but for them to be out here late, in the cold and on a school night means a lot. It definitely helped us win.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T08:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T10:03:32.398+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
