It's unlikely the MSU senior will return to the field this season. \nRedmond was projected as one of the best corners in the country. ESPN's Todd McShay listed Redmond as a potential first-round NFL Draft pick. \nMississippi State would not comment on the status of Remdond. \nRedmond leads Mississippi State with two interceptions. He also leads MSU's cornerbacks with 25 tackles. \nTolando Cleveland and Cedric Jiles will be asked to fill the vacancy left by Redmond. Cleveland has started four games this season. He has 24 tackles, including 2.5 for loss. The junior also has a sack. \nJiles has 10 tackles. \nRedmond has played in more than 30 percent of Mississippi State's game and it is beyond the midway point of the season, so he can not request a medical redshirt. \nContact Michael Bonner at mbonner@jackson.gannett.com.
