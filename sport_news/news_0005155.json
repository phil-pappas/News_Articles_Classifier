Potts’ Doggie Shop on Fairview Street stayed open late and the players stuffed themselves with all the hot dogs they could eat. \n“All these memories are going to come back and everyone is so excited for this,” Kennedy said. \nThe 1975 team was inducted into Liberty’s Athletic Hall of Fame in January, allowing a smaller contingent of past players to gather again on Linden Street. \n“Everybody was so excited to see each other,” Kennedy said. “It was just great. It’s interesting to see how much the kids have changed.” \nThere was no shortage of fine players on that Hurricanes squad, of course, including Jim Stamatis, who won the Hermann Trophy (soccer's version of the Heisman Trophy) at Penn State and played professionally, Keith Jones, a captain who was lost to a broken leg, John Shireman and sophomore leading scorer Joey Kovacs. \nAfter Liberty’s triumph in ’75, Freedom had a runner-up finish in 1976; the Hurricanes placed second in 1977; and Freedom earned a co-state championship in 1983 after playing to a 16-overtime tie with Trinity. \nDistrict 11 didn’t celebrate another champion until Moravian Academy captured the Class A title last season. \nKennedy credits Bethlehem’s early success in the sport to the infrastructure and development provided by the Greater Bethlehem Youth Soccer League, a product of influential figures like Dr. Tom Fleck, Ed Csongradi and Charlie Garcia. \nThe Christmas City soccer formula didn’t stay unique to Bethlehem for long. \n“The greatest form of flattery is imitation,” said Kennedy, who retired from teaching at Liberty in 1999. “They (other Lehigh Valley schools) caught on and all of a sudden club soccer caught on like crazy.” \nThis year’s Liberty team isn’t doing badly for itself, either. The Hurricanes are 16-1 and the No. 2 team in the area, according to lehighvalleylive. Kennedy is excited to see Liberty in person. \n“They are for real,” he said. “They have a really good team; they’re fast; they’re talented … It should be a great game.” \nAnd a fitting night to honor a great team.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T18:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T02:39:13.897+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
