Here is the report card for Utah.\nUpcoming Games Utah Football Utah football stats & schedule Ore. St. @ Utah Rice-Eccles Stadium, Salt Lake City Oct. 31, 5:00 p.m. 6 Days 7 Hrs 31 Mins 52 Secs More Coverage Sunday Morning QB: Stars and stats from No. 3 Utah's 42-24 upset loss at USC LOS ANGELES â€” Being the \"team to beat\" in an elite conference week after week can take a big toll on a team. It certainly seemed to be the case for the No. 3 ranked Utah Utes on Saturday night as they faced the USC Trojans.\nThe Utes started the game solid, but they turned the ball over in some costly situations, and ran out of gas. The final score was 42-24 for USC.\nHere is the report card for Utah:\nOffense\nAs much as Devontae Booker is the battering ram of Utah's offense this season, the team is at its best when quarterback Travis Wilson plays well. Throughout his career as a Ute, Wilson has been known to at times have amazing games, while at other times he doesn't look like the same player.\nOn Saturday night, Wilson had one of the games where he really struggled, and the offense suffered because of it. He did throw for 254 yards and two touchdowns, but he also threw four interceptions in the game, one of which was returned for a touchdown. Wilson's fourth interception came in the closing seconds of the fourth quarter on a \"Hail Mary\" pass.\nUSC freshman linebacker Cameron Smith seemed to know exactly where Wilson wanted to go with the ball, as he caught three of the four interceptions.\nThe turnovers for Utah came at some really key points in the game, and it killed any momentum that the team had at the time. With Wilson not being a big threat throwing the ball, it was tough for Booker to make plays, as he ran for just 62 yards on 14 carries.\nBritain Covey had seven receptions for a career high 129 yards and two touchdowns.\nUtah was 3-11 on third-down conversions, and 0-2 on fourth down. It had 353 yards of total offense, but Wilson's interceptions nullified any progress they made on that front. There just wasn't much going for Utah offensively.\nGrade: D\nDefense\nUtah's defense has been stout all season, but it seemed very worn out against the USC offense. Trojans quarterback Cody Kessler completed 21 of his 28 pass attempts for 264 yards and a touchdown, and was able to find wide receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster all night long, as the wideout had eight receptions for 143 yards and a touchdown.\nDefending the run is where Utah's defense has excelled most of the season, but USC didn't have much of a problem moving the ball on the ground at all. The Trojans as a team ran for 116 yards and four touchdowns.\nOn a night where the offense really struggled, Utah's defense needed to be better than ever against the Trojans. It had to make plays and force turnovers, but it wasn't able to.\nThis was first game this season that the Utah defense did not force a single turnover.\nGrade: D+\nSpecial teams\nIn the return game, Covey had an excellent punt return early in the game, where he weaved and juked through a multitude of USC defenders until he was tackled near the end zone. The return set up a touchdown for Utah on the following drive.\nOther than that particular return, Utah had a fairly average night in the return game.\nPunter Tom Hackett had a solid night, punting five times for 216 yards, with three of his punts landing inside the 20-yard line.\nKicker Andy Phillips only attempted one field goal, which he knuckleballed in from 53 yards, a career long for him. Phillips also hit all three of his PAT attempts.\nGrade: B+", "external_links": ["http://deseretnews.sportsdirectinc.com/football/ncaaf-teams.aspx?page=/data/ncaaf/teams/team93.html"], "published": "2015-10-25T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T17:27:39.706+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
