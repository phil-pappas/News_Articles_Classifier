The survey suggests many stressed-out workers are under the impression that their managers aren’t concerned with their needs as caregivers, with 64 percent of respondents saying their employer is not attentive to the needs of working parents.\nBut Lissy suspects a lack of communication is to blame.\n“I don’t think managers are totally in the dark,” Lissy said. “They acknowledge these issues are out there but if they’re not hearing about them directly, they might not see them as big issues.” In fact, only a third of managers said they had concerns that working parents were struggling to balance work and life.\nEmployees clearly see work-life balance as a pretty huge problem, however.\nAlmost half of working parents said they were worried about managing their health, and 77 percent said their burnout had caused them to feel anxious or to get sick more often. This pressure could eventually lead to workers feeling unhappy at their company, and more likely to search for a new job.\nThe survey also showed that work-life balance is not just a problem for working moms, with more than half of dads (52 percent) reporting they were stressed about maintaining their work performance while being more present at home.\n“Working millennial dads have said they want to be engaged at work but they don’t want to be absentee parents like maybe their fathers were,” Lissy said. “This is not a gender-specific issue.”\nSo what’s the solution? It’s two-fold, Lissy said.\nStory continues after gallery.\nThe least and most fulfilling jobs, according to the people who hold them:\nPrevious -- of -- Next In a recent study, PayScale, a compensation research firm, asked workers if they thought their jobs make the world a better place. After 2.7 million people were surveyed, 55 percent of those who responded said their jobs are highly meaningful. But that percentage varied greatly by profession. Here are the 10 jobs in which the least people said they make the world a better place, followed by the 10 jobs in which the most people did. (Note that there are many ties.)
