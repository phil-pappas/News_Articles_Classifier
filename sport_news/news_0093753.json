The jokes at their expense have stopped. The masochism of their fans has given way to fresh optimism. But when the Mets take the field against the Los Angeles Dodgers on Friday night in the National League Division Series, it will also be a requiem for an enduring symbol of one of their darkest ages: Generic Sad Mets Fan.\nMaybe you remember him. If you’ve read anything even a little bit depressing about the Mets in the past eight years—in other words, if you’ve read anything about the Mets in the past eight years—chances are you have seen his face.\nHe’s a little bit scruffy. His hands are clasped over his head, above a blue rally cap. He is wearing a road gray Mets jersey. In some photos, he is frowning and staring at the ground, thoroughly absorbed by his own despair. In others, he is looking up, eyes shut, mouth open wide, writhing in almost theatrical agony.\nThe Mets Go to Los Angeles\nFrom Seinfeld to Rock to Stewart, Stand-Up Comedians Seem to Be Drawn to the Mets Harvey’s Excuse for Missing Practice Doesn’t Hold Water, but Mets Move On Dispelling the Myth of Home-Field Advantage in Baseball The images were captured on Sept. 30, 2007, the day the Mets completed their most infamous late-season collapse. The following morning, they were everywhere: in newspapers, on tabloid covers, online and on television. And for most of the past eight years, they have resurfaced every now and again, putting a familiar face on stories about the Mets’ woes and their fans’ misery.\nBut the team’s dramatic turnaround since the end of July, culminating in its return to the postseason, has made that face a relic. As a representation of the die-hard masses, Generic Sad Mets Fan is finally obsolete. No one is happier about this than Generic Sad Mets Fan himself.\nHis name is Seth Fleischauer. He’s 36 years old. He runs an education company in Los Angeles, just a short drive from Dodger Stadium. And he is no longer frowning.\n“It’s exhilarating to think that this chapter is finally closed,” he said this week. “My hope is that at some point, when you Google ‘Mets fan,’ I’m not the first hit that comes up.”\nThe day the photos were taken began promisingly enough. The Mets, who had been leading the NL East by seven games on Sept. 12, were now clinging to a first-place tie with the Philadelphia Phillies on the final day of the regular season. Fleischauer, then a third-grade public-school teacher in Brooklyn, began the game sitting in the upper deck overlooking right field at Shea Stadium. Then the Florida Marlins pounded Tom Glavine for seven runs in the first inning. By the middle of the game, many fans had already left.\n‘ My hope is that at some point, when you Google “Mets fan,” I’m not the first hit that comes up. ’\n—Seth Fleischauer With two college friends and two of his students, Fleischauer moved down to open seats behind the Mets’ dugout. Incidentally, the seats were also about 20 feet from a well reserved for news photographers. Toward the end of the game, as he stood up and recounted the day’s misery with his friends, he noticed one photographer facing him. Then another. And another.\n“The next thing I know, there are like 40 people taking pictures of me,” he said.\nFleischauer’s face perfectly summed up the feeling of every Mets fan. The next day, he was so ubiquitous that Regis Philbin picked up a newspaper with one of the photos on his television show and asked, “Who is this guy? He’s everywhere.” But what turned Fleischauer into Generic Sad Mets Fan was what happened in the years that followed.\nFor fans, the general feeling didn’t change much. The Mets blew a late lead in the standings again and missed the playoffs in 2008. Then they fell further into an abyss that they are only now climbing out of. Improbably, the photos remained in circulation, popping up here and there in unrelated, sad Mets fan stories.\nENLARGE Seth Fleischauer with his daughter Vida at an L.A. Galaxy game this year.

In 2012, when a Connecticut woman died, her family wrote in her obituary that she was a lifelong Mets fan, “though surprisingly, that wasn’t what killed her.” A few online news sites picked it up. The accompanying photo: Generic Sad Mets Fan.\nEven in July, when one sports blog wrote about a Mets fan who started a fundraising campaign called “Let’s Get the Mets a Hitter!” the main photo was of Fleischauer.\n“It was like a stamp on the Internet and then it just stayed there,” he said. “It’s definitely been something that endured.”\nFleischauer is like a lot of Mets fans. His father was a New Yorker who never forgave the Dodgers for leaving Brooklyn. He has remained a loyal, if sometimes distressed fan since that day in 2007.\nOn occasion, Fleischauer has also sought out other fans who can relate to him. He has exchanged Facebook messages with a Mets fan who was pictured on the front page of the New York Times after the Mets’ 2007 collapse. And just last month, he connected on Twitter with a fan whose teary face appeared on the cover of the Daily News after the 2008 collapse. At the time, the boy was 12 years old. He’s now a 19-year-old freshman at the University of Southern California.\nIf the NLDS goes to a Game 5 at Dodger Stadium, the two of them plan to attend.\nThey’ll be sitting together, full of hope and far from the cameras.", "external_links": ["http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KR422_SADMET_FR_20151008142632.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-08T22:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T00:37:31.779+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
