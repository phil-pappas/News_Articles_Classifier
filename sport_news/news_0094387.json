Don't think for a moment that the Giants didn't know what everyone was thinking after their nightmare performance in Philadelphia last Monday night. And don't think they didn't remember what happened a year ago, when a two-month spiral was sparked by one bad loss in the exact same place and time. Of course they knew. Of course they remembered. And of course they worried that it could happen again. But what makes this Giants team different — at least what made them seem so different on Sunday — is that they refused to be defined by the mistakes of their past. \nHere's a sampling of some of the other reaction following the win: The Giants were feeling awfully good about themselves after a 27-20 win over the Cowboys, and you certainly can understand their well-earned sigh of relief in the wake of a miserable loss six nights earlier in Philadelphia. That was one of the worst losses of the Tom Coughlin-Eli Manning era, and at least it didn't set off the avalanche of six more defeats that last season's 27-0 nightmare at the Linc precipitated. But let's be real here: The Giants were fortunate to beat a badly wounded Cowboys team that trotted out its third quarterback of the season Sunday — a quarterback who wasn't even with the team when Tony Romo suffered a collarbone injury that could turn out to be the undoing of the defending NFC East champions. — Bob Glauber, Newsday In fact, this was the week Tom Coughlin's Giants were supposed to come undone. Just like last year, they had started 0-2 and bounced back to win three straight before suffering a demoralizing loss in Philadelphia. That 2014 defeat started a seven-game losing streak and, at season's end, compelled owner John Mara to effectively issue a playoffs-or-else mandate for his head coach and general manager, Jerry Reese. The Cowboys followed the Eagles on the schedule this year, just like they followed them on the schedule last year. But this time Coughlin promised the beatdown in Philly would not define a season that would otherwise be his last. He was right. He had no choice to be right. — Ian O'Connor, ESPN.com Same opponent, same defensive back, same stadium, different receiver. The result, a hard-to-believe catch, may not have been identical, but it was pretty similar. For the second straight season, a Giants player made an acrobatic, one-handed catch against the Cowboys. Last year, it was Odell Beckham Jr. abusing Dallas cornerback Brandon Carr, and Sunday, it was Rueben Randle doing the same to Carr, making a 44-yard catch with the use of only his right hand on an Eli Manning bomb down the sideline. — Zach Braziller, New York Post Cowboys owner Jerry Jones thought it was ironic. Giants head coach Tom Coughlin viewed it as prophetic. All Dwayne Harris knew is that it was about time he took a kickoff, got the blocking he needed and returned it the length of the field for a touchdown...It was a painful reminder for Jones and the Cowboys, who selected Harris in the sixth-round of the 2011 draft out of East Carolina. After four years in Dallas where he was used primarily as returner, Harris signed with the Giants this offseason because they promised he'd get a shot to be a real receiver. Harris caught just 33 passes for 418 yards and three touchdowns with the Cowboys and felt his skills were being under-utilized though he returned two punts for touchdowns. — George Willis, New York Post", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T17:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T21:23:09.912+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
