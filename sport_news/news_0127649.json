From season story lines to who you're cheering for, our guide will have you prepped for the playoffs and sounding like you've been glued to any one of Canada's clubs in 2015. Story line of the season \nMontreal Impact : With apologies to Drake, the Impact started from the bottom, now they're here. Last-place finishers in 2014, there was nowhere to go but up for the Impact, who made a splash in July by signing EPL legend Didier Drogba, who has paid off handsomely . \nToronto FC : To be fair, it's been the same storyline for the past few seasons: end the playoff drought by any means necessary. The Reds have never made the post-season in their nine-year existence, but adding key pieces like Jozy Altidore and Sebastian Giovinco have secured Toronto's first foray into the playoffs. \nVancouver Whitecaps : The team only booked their spot in the 2014 playoffs on the final day of the regular season, and were bounced by FC Dallas in a controversial finish . This year, the young squad has another year of experience and sit near the top of the league standings. Star strikers \nThese are the men each team counts on to carry the offensive load through (what they hope to be) a deep playoff run.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T17:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T19:02:03.078+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
