Ranburne reels up another big win \nRanburne stayed on track for a top-two finish in Class 2A, Region 5 when the Bulldogs defeated traditional power Reeltown 24-20 last Friday in Ranburne. Now 5-1 overall and 3-1 in Region 5, the Bulldogs face a different kind of challenge on the road Friday when they travel to New Site to take on region foe Horseshoe Bend. Horseshoe Bend is 0-6 and the challenge is to avoid overlooking the Generals. \nBulldogs head coach Chad Young said prior to Wednesday’s practice that he has been up front with his players. \n“Horseshoe Bend has lost a lot of close games and they’ve been ahead in a bunch of those games they’ve gotten beat. They’re not a bad football team,” he said. \nComparative scores seem to support Young’s opinion. Reeltown edged Horseshoe Bend 12-0. Lanett defeated the Generals 33-25 and LaFayette won 52-31. \nTypically, Horseshoe Bend will run from the shotgun. Young said they are often 70-30 run to pass. \n“I think they’re going to try their best to run it and if they can’t they’ll throw more,” Young said. \nTwo of the biggest plays in the win over the Rebels were interceptions. Jordan English picked off a Reeltown pass near the Ranburne 5-yard line with just over a minute left in the first half and the Bulldogs were able to run the final 1:09 off the clock. The second half kickoff went to Reeltown. Aided by penalties against the Bulldogs, the Rebels were knocking on the door less than a minute into the third quarter when Logan Otwell made an interception at the Ranburne 1. \n“They were crucial,” Young said of the interceptions. “I think they were trying to surprise us by throwing in those situations. They’ve been doing that to people and catching them kind of off guard. I think we were prepared for it and ready for it.” \nAgainst Reeltown, the Bulldogs scored on the game’s opening possession. Their 74-yard drive took slightly less than four minutes and ended on a 15-yard run by Owen Smith. The first of Jake Howle’s three extra points put Ranburne ahead 7-0 with 8:09 still to play in the first quarter. \nReeltown knotted the score at 7-7 on a pass but Ranburne was on the move again when the first quarter ended. The Bulldogs had traveled from the Ranburne 41 to the Reeltown 32 in the final minute and 40 seconds of the first. On the second play of the second quarter, Josh Ralston took the ball on what appeared to be a jet sweep then pulled up and threw to Smith. Smith went out of bounds at the Reeltown 1 and Dalton Wiggins scored from there. \nThe Bulldogs drove deep into Reeltown territory later in the second quarter. When that drive stalled, Howle booted a 20-yard field goal with 2:40 to go before halftime. \n“The field goal to make it 17-7 before the half was big,” Young said. “Jake is a weapon. That put us up two scores at halftime instead of just 14-7.” \nThe interception by English kept Ranburne ahead 17-7 at intermission. \nAfter Otwell’s pick, the Bulldogs moved 77 yards and upped their lead to 24-7 on a 16-yard touchdown completion from Dylan Wiggins to Jake Burson with 10:19 left in the third. Ranburne advanced deep into Rebels’ territory twice thereafter. A fumble ended one threat and a missed field goal halted another. \nIn the fourth quarter, Reeltown made it 24-14 then scored again to cut Ranburne’s lead to 24-20. After the Bulldogs blocked an extra point attempt to keep it 24-20, Otwell recovered an onside kick at the Ranburne 48 with 2:13 to go and Ranburne ran out the clock. \nDylan Wiggins was 11-for-14 passing for 182 yards. Burson had four catches for 112 yards. Dalton Wiggins caught three passes for 31 yards, Landon Woodard two for 27 yards and Otwell one for six yards. Smith had a 6-yard reception on a pass from Wiggins and the 27-yard gain from Ralston. \n“I think we threw the ball as good as we’ve thrown it in a while,” Young said. “Our protection was really good. We had a lot of time. We kind of picked them apart early to get the big lead.” \nDalton Wiggins was Ranburne’s rushing leader with 70 yards on 17 carries. Dylan Wiggins ran 10 times and netted 65 yards. Smith had one carry for 15 yards and Otwell carried four times for 15 yards. \nFor the game, Reeltown rushed for just 69 yards. \nOtwell and Dylan Wiggins led on defense with 10 tackles apiece. Donovan Tullis, Riley Smith and Hunter McAdams each had had four tackles apiece. Dalton Wiggins, Owen Smith and Bailey McCormick each recorded three tackles. Blake Young, Logan Sibley, Ralston and Jordan Beal each had two tackles. Tigers one step closer to winning the region \nThree scores in the first 15 minutes of play propelled Cleburne County to a 29-14 win over visiting Jacksonville last Friday. Despite too many penalties and four turnovers, the Tigers won their fifth consecutive game. \n“I was very proud of our kids for finding a way to win when we weren’t playing real well as a team,” Cleburne County head coach Michael Shortt said Tuesday evening. “We were playing extremely well in spots. We played good on offense in spurts. We played good on defense in spurts. As far as a four-quarter ball game, we did not play that well. I give the kids all the credit for coming through and making the plays we needed to make to win the ball game. I always felt like we were in control but we never did come out and dominate like we wanted to.” \nNow 5-1 overall and 4-0 in Class 4A, Region 6, Cleburne County travels to Sardis (3-3, 2-2) for another Region 6 game Friday. Shortt said the Lions have been hit hard by injuries particularly to their corps of running back. Quarterback Logan Gaskin was 7-for-16 passing for 234 yards and two touchdowns in the Lions’ 21-19 win over White Plains last week. Austin Hallmark had four catches for 136 yards, including a 65-yard touchdown. \nShortt said he and his assistants have warned the Tigers not to be caught looking past Sardis to their Oct. 16 game against Saks. \n“What we have for motivation is, if we win this ball game the next week (at Saks) would be for all the marbles,” Shortt said. “It would be for a region championship so, if you want to play for a region championship and a chance to host, you’ve got to win this week.” \nAgainst Jacksonville, the Tigers opened the game by forcing a punt. They then moved 73 yards in five plays for a 7-0 lead with 8:37 left in the first quarter on Trevor Houston’s 12-yard run and Macain Carlile’s kick. A 38-yard run by Json Henson and a 28-yard Brock Swafford to Jeremiah Blake completion were the big plays along the way. \nCleburne County’s next possession became a 10-play, 67-yard scoring drive. With 4:24 left in the first quarter, fullback Mario Smith scored on a 10-yard run and Carlile made it 14-0. A 10-yard run by Kade Clark, a 12-yard run by Noah Ware and a 15-yard reception by Stashun Henson set up Smith’s scamper. \nWith 9:05 remaining in the second quarter, a 55-yard Swafford-to-Blake throw and run capped a drive that moved 77 yards in five plays. The extra point missed and the Tigers led 20-0. Jacksonville cut that lead to 20-7 with a 32-yard scoring pass midway through the second quarter. \nThe only points of the third quarter came on a safety when a high snap sailed over the head of the Jacksonville punter and he was tackled in the end zone. \nThe Tigers extended their lead to 29-7 with 9:45 left in the game on a 5-yard scoring run by Clark and Carlile’s kick at the end of a 58-yard, four-play drive. A 10-yard catch by Chad Brown and a 6-yard catch by Nick Dunston helped the drive. Jacksonville’s final score came with 7:11 to play. \nJson Henson ran 13 times for 150 yards. Clark gained 69 yards on 12 carries and Houston had 49 yards on 12 carries. Overall, the Tigers ran for 306 yards. \nSwafford was 8-for-14 passing for 136 yards with two interceptions. Blake made four receptions for 101 yards and Stashun Henson had two catches for 19 yards. \nWade Dasinger led in tackles with 11. Smith had 10 tackles in addition to his work at fullback. Brown and Austin Harler each had nine stops. Colt Funderburk recorded eight tackles. Matt Norton made seven tackles, Skye Jarrell five, Christian Hartley five and Josh Davis three.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T23:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T15:18:45.530+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
