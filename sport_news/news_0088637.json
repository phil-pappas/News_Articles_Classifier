From there, Missouri was stopped on three consecutive plays and forced to kick a field goal. The short series that gave Missouri a 3-0 lead proved to be the game in a nutshell.\nThe Missouri defense played phenomenally against a Georgia team averaging 37 points a game, allowing just three field goals to the formerly nationally ranked Bulldogs.\nUnfortunately, Mizzou could not muster a touchdown drive themselves and were held to just two field goals in a 9-6 defeat to their conference foes.\nIn the 14-year Gary Pinkel era the Missouri program scored fewer than 10 points in just eight games in, but with Saturday’s loss the team has failed to score double digits in three of their last five games.\nThe stagnant offense resulted in just 21 rushing yards on 22 carries. The passing game wasn’t much better, as freshman Drew Lock threw for just 143 yards on 11 for 26 passing.\nWith such poor production in both areas it’s hard to say that any personnel performed well, including an offensive line that’s struggled with consistency all season long.\n“It seems like they always had somebody unblocked. That’s not very good,” Pinkel said.\nWith quarterback Maty Mauk suspended indefinitely and large faction of key players on offense being inexperienced freshman or sophomores, Missouri’s offense looks as if it may continue to struggle throughout SEC play.\nDefensively, the Tigers have been top tier in the SEC for most of the season. Against a potent Georgia attack they proved that good defense prevails over good offense, holding the Bulldogs under 300 yards of total offense.\nThe Tigers were again led by senior linebacker Kentrell Brothers, who added 17 total tackles to his nation leading total of 96 on the season. Brothers has shown up in every game this season, averaging 13.7 tackles per game and leading a young defense to what could result in a top ten defensive ranking nationally.\nEven after holding one of the SEC’s most high powered offenses without a touchdown, the Tigers missed ample opportunities, including an Anthony Sherrils interception near the Missouri goal line that was reversed after review.\n “I had it, for sure. But we played them at their home, so it was a house call I feel,” said Sherrils.\nSeveral more passes bounced off the hands of Missouri defenders, leaving the defense on the field and creating more chances for a Georgia offense struggling to move the ball.\nWith every point being so crucial in a defensive battle, Missouri just didn’t make enough plays.\nThe loss dropped the Tigers to 4-3 overall and 1-3 in SEC play, essentially from contention in the SEC East and erasing their chance to win a third consecutive SEC East title.\nThe Tigers will now look to become bowl eligible, needing two more wins to do so.\nWith their offensive inabilities it’s difficult to chalk up any game as a victory, but they’ll have a great opportunity to reach the five win mark against Vanderbilt in week 8. The Commodores are just 2-4 on the season and winless in conference play and coming off a loss to a South Carolina team that Missouri defeated just two weeks ago.\nWith four games remaining against stiff competition after their matchup with Vanderbilt, the Tigers are no lock to make a bowl run, which would be a rarity under coach Pinkel and would seem to be a waste of the top flite defense of the 2015 Tigers.\nCopyright 2015 KCTV (Meredith Corp.)
