Indeed, the Falcons overcame a third set deficit to upset third-seeded Heyworth in the last quarterfinal match of the night Tuesday. The three-set victory vaulted Flanagan-Cornell into the semifinals of the Heart of Illinois Conference tournament. The Falcons will meet second-seed Tri-Valley Thursday. The Vikings defeated Tremont in the first quarterfinal. Also advancing to the semifinals was top-seed and defending state champion Dee-Mack, who handled El Paso-Gridley in the second quarterfinal. The fourth quarterfinal will take place Thursday with No. 4 Lexington facing No. 5 Fieldcrest in the 4:15 p.m. match. Flanagan-Cornell-Heyworth The Falcons rallied from a four-point deficit in the third set to get past Heyworth 25-13, 22-25, 18-16. It was a comeback that might be considered one of the best in the program’s history. “It was good to see us fighting to the end. It was a great finish,” Flanagan-Cornell head coach Kari Harms said. “Great” could be an understatement. The Falcons were down four at match point before charging back. Ashley Van Weelden delivered a kill, her first of the match, for a sideout to dodge the first match point by the Hornets. Alana Harms got the serve for Flanagan-Cornell recorded two points after two errors by Heyworth. A timeout came with the Hornets’ lead down to 14-13. Van Weelden made a block, one of her 8 in the match, to tie the set at 14-14. A set kill from Heyworth’s Amber Tomlin gave the Hornets a 15-14 lead and the serve. But Van Weelden’s final block of the night came when Mackenzie Koch’s tip was rejected at the net. This tied it at 15-15. Kelsi Scott’s second block of the set gave the Falcons a 16-15 lead. Heyworth stymied Flanagan-Cornell on its bid for the win with a sideout, but lost the serve when Ashley Farris, the leading hitter for the Falcons in the match recorded her ninth kill. Flanagan-Cornell made good on its second shot at match point when Madison Quattro’s attack went wide to send the Falcons into the semifinal round. Defense was the key as the Falcons blocked 10 attacks and dug up more than 20 Heyworth attacks. “I’m really pleased with the blocking tonight. We need to be stronger on defense and we’ve been focusing on that to complete our game,” Coach Harms said. “I thought Liberty (Vollmer) had some excellent and amazing digs. Ashley (Van Weelden) and Kelsi, even just touching it and slowing it up, the defense reacted well to the ball.” Page 2 of 3 - Flanagan-Cornell did not trail in the first set. Alana Harms served an ace to trigger a spurt that gave the Falcons a 17-8 lead. The first set ended when Sam Lyons’ tip landed for a kill.

The Bunnies did have a lead in the second set but the Knights were able to roll into the quarterfinals. “That second set, we were trying out some different options on serve receive,” FHS head coach Jennifer Bartman said. “After they got to point seven, the girls decided no more and they turned it on the swings started coming better. “I felt we were in control of the match the whole game.” Jaclyn Kalkwarf had 10 assists and Gwen Lohr-Fandel made 16 digs.
