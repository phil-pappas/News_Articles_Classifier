(AP) - Andy Dalton threw three touchdown passes and the unbeaten Cincinnati Bengals won their sixth straight to match the team’s best start to a season with a 34-21 victory over the Buffalo Bills on Sunday. \nWith star receiver A.J. Green covered much of the game, Dalton completed touchdown passes to Marvin Jones, Tyler Eifert and Jeremy Hill. Dalton finished 22 of 33 for 243 yards for Cincinnati, which was also 6-0 to start the 1975 and ‘88 seasons. \nThe Bengals broke the game open by scoring 17 points on their first three second-half possessions to build a 34-14 lead. \nThe Bills (3-3) were undone by injuries and several penalties that allowed the Bengals to enjoy an average drive start of midfield in the first half. \n___ \nBRONCOS 26, BROWNS 23 OT \nCLEVELAND (AP) - Peyton Manning shook off three interceptions and drove Denver in range for Brandon McManus’ 34-yard field goal with 4:56 left in overtime. \nManning took the Broncos from their own 12 to Cleveland’s 16 before McManus kicked his game-winner to make Denver 6-0 for the seventh time in franchise history. The Broncos only rallied thanks to their top-ranked defense, which came up big in overtime. \nAfter Manning’s third pick, Denver recorded two sacks to push the Browns (2-4) out of field-goal range. \n___ \nLIONS 37, BEARS 34 OT \nDETROIT (AP) - A win, finally. Matt Prater kicked a 27-yard field goal with 2:29 left in overtime, and Detroit won for the first time this season. \nMatthew Stafford heaved a 57-yard pass to Calvin Johnson to set up the kick for the Lions (1-5). Johnson finished with six receptions for 166 yards. \nThe Bears (2-4) had chances for a third straight comeback win. \nChicago’s Robbie Gould kicked a 29-yard field goal as time expired in regulation. The tying score was set up by Darius Slay getting called for interference after Jay Cutler’s 25- and 24-yard passes to Alshon Jeffery.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T00:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T01:52:53.984+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
