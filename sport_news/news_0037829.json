The former MVP and Super Bowl champ has fallen off the Great Divide at the tail end of his time in Denver. Thus far in 2015, he is a relative shell of the NFL star who will go down as one of the greatest to ever play the game, even if he doesn’t quite match up with his contemporary in New England.\nAlas, while the 39-year-old Manning struggles as he nears the halfway point of the Broncos’ schedule, Patriots quarterback Tom Brady, only a year younger, is poised to have one of the best seasons in his inevitable Hall of Fame career. He’s even talking about playing another 10 years before retiring.\nOh, sure, the notable rivals are a combined 11-0 to start the season, but Manning has gotten to 6-0 solely thanks to Denver’s suffocating defense, which leads all of football with 17 takeaways and four touchdowns through six weeks. The quarterback’s apparent football demise has been something of a running storyline since last January’s playoff defeat at the hands of his former team, the Indianapolis Colts, when Manning seemingly aged into Bubby Brister right before our eyes.\nTen months later, Manning is the second-worst rated quarterback (72.5) among starters in the NFL, and far and away the worst with at least 200 attempts (Houston’s Ryan Mallett has a QB rating of 63.6 with 147 throws). Manning has tossed seven touchdowns this season, just as many as Drew Brees, Russell Wilson, and…um, Jay Cutler. He’s also thrown an NFL-high 10 interceptions, including three— three —against the Cleveland Browns, who had all of one heading into their near-win against the Broncos last Sunday.\nBrady? Oh, he’s only the league’s top-rated quarterback (118.4), no matter what ESPN’s fuzzy math has to say on the matter. His 14 touchdowns trail only Green Bay’s Aaron Rodgers (15) for most in the NFL. The only interception he’s yet to throw shouldn’t really even count against him as it was entirely the fault of wide receiver Julian Edelman. No other QB with 100 or more attempts has a higher completion percentage (70.6) than Brady has managed this season.\nManning didn’t endure the offseason soap opera that Brady did, which has seemingly put a little extra juice in the latter’s competitive spirit and perhaps added a few names to his vindictive checklist. While both quarterbacks are inevitably nearing the end of their respective careers, their trajectories could hardly seem more different.\nThey’re pizza and avocado ice cream. Chicken parm and kale. Frosted Flakes and raw macaroons.\nThe old country boy and Tommy Hollywood couldn’t have any more different public personas, aside from the obvious similarity of being two of the best—and richest—quarterbacks in NFL history. Everyman Manning lends his likeness to every product this side of Viagra, while Brady reserves himself for the Tag Heuers and the Uggs or the world. Brady is married to a global supermodel, while Manning’s life seems to be something more out of the ABC Friday family sitcom lineup of the 90’s.\nSo, maybe it shouldn’t be a great surprise that they’re also differing in how they wind down their careers.\nManning’s is quite clearly over after this season. Perhaps sooner if Broncos head coach Gary Kubiak has the stones to supplant him with backup Brock Osweiler. Brady, meanwhile, is in the midst of his Middle Finger Tour through the NFL, and poised to win his second-straight Super Bowl and fifth overall, an achievement that would give him the most-ever for a quarterback.\nBut any Patriot fans taking glee from the happenstances in Denver might want to hold off.\nNot because Manning is headed for some sort of immediate resurgence. In fact, based on his borderline incompetence in cold weather, the next two months aren’t going to do him any favors in Colorado. But whether you consider him a superhero or not, Brady’s football mortality is coming eventually as well, and while it might surely be prettier than Manning’s, one only has to go back to early in the 2014 season for an inkling as to how it might begin.\nIt’s easy to forget that Manning was statistically among the best quarterbacks in the game last season, second only to Andrew Luck in touchdown passes (39 to Luck’s 40). His 101.5 rating was actually a couple points ahead of Brady (97.4). Of course, he fell off a cliff at the end of November. The Broncos still won three of four to close out the regular season prior to their gag job against the Colts on Jan. 11.\nBrady seems to trust his controversial personal trainer, Alex Guerrero, to ensure such a preciptous downturn never happens to him (let’s just say speed dial to the Norwood Papa John’s isn’t a priority at the TB12 clinic). His eating habits and training methods seem to have given him a regimen that is the model for 37-year-old athletes everywhere. But he can only do so much in fighting the inevitable.\nRight?\nAs for Manning, if he’s at the end, it’s not a bad way to go out.\n”Whatever stats people are looking for, we’ve got a great stat and that’s 6-0,” Denver tackle Ryan Harris said . “And No. 1 in the division.”\nFor now.\nBut in a quarterback-driven league, the Broncos simply can’t excel for long without a quarterback playing at a high level.\nAt least the same will never happen to Brady and the Patriots.\nRight?\nContact Eric Wilbur at: eric.wilbur@globe.com .
