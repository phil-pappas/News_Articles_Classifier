Damion Blythe is a senior captain for Clark Montessori but he hasn't played in one game this year. He has learning disabilities which affected an English project last year. He was given an incomplete but got extra time over the summer and earned a \"C.\" But the incomplete -- not the \"c\" -- went through to the Ohio Athletic Association which deemed him ineligible. Clark Montessori went to bat for him to no avail. A hearing Tuesday, Oct. 13, was suddenly canceled and Blythe will be able to play Friday against Summit Country Day for the first time this year. \nFollow us on Twitter @Local12 and LIKE us on Facebook for updates!
