We will be appealing this suspension immediately.\"\nThe Dodgers also said they supported his decision to appeal, which is expected to be heard before the third game of the series that is locked at 1-1 in New York on Monday.\n(Reporting by Tim Wharnsby in Toronto; Editing by Andrew Both/Greg Stutchbury)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T07:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T06:41:42.860+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
