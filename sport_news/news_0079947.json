Quarterback Ammon Olsen threw touchdown passes of 10, 40, and 32 yards and before some fans could even sit down it was already 21-0, T-Birds. \nAnd then the rains came. As the downpour intensified, people left to find cover, with some never returning, and really, they didn't need to. They had seen all they needed. Southern Utah coasted to a dominating 44-0 victory — its second straight shutout — to improve to 3-0 in the Big Sky Conference. \nIt was a good debut for T-Birds' offensive coordinator Justin Walterscheid as the offense put up 570 total yards, and Olsen tied James Armendariz's and Brad Sorensen's SUU record with five touchdown passes. \n\"For the first time having the title and the opportunity to call it, I knew he was really nervous about it,\" SUU head coach Ed Lamb said about Walterscheid. \"I'm just happy he was able to have so much success and players really rallied around him.\" \nThings couldn't have started better for the new OC, with SUU scoring touchdowns on three of its first four drives. But then the T-Birds went through a little bit of a lull. As the rain picked up it seemed to zap the energy right out of the stadium, and its effects were felt on the field. \n\"For about five minutes there it really started to rain hard and the wind picked up,\" Lamb said. \"And at that point we also had the wrong ball in the game, we had the opponent's ball, and our center wasn't sure if he should slow the game down and ask for the correct ball to be in the game. I think there was a stretch of five minutes of game clock where the weather affected it, but other than that, the rain was pretty light and the ball was dry.\" \nBut even the weather as an excuse, Lamb wasn't happy with how his team handled it. And it wasn't just the fact that SUU was held scoreless over the remainder of the first half, either. He brought the team in at halftime and said he thought the energy had fallen off. \nThey got it back in the second half. \n\"We kind of weathered the storm,\" Lamb said. \nBoth literally and figuratively. \nOlsen connected on touchdown passes of 48 yards and 50 yards in the third quarter to put things completely out of reach. The quarterback finished the night completing 27 of 40 passes for 421 yards. \n\"It starts up front and I had a lot of time today,\" Olsen said \"The receivers caught almost everything that went their way, even if it wasn't a great ball they still came down with it.\" \nJustin Brown led the team with 160 yards receiving and caught two touchdowns, and Mike Sharp had 154 yards receiving and three touchdowns of his own. \n\"We've had so many games where we felt like we were close but we didn't make the plays we need to,\" Olsen said. \"I just felt the receivers, the O-line and everyone was making plays.\" \nThe defense was, too. The T-Birds didn't collect a ton of takeaways (they finished with one), but they kept the Hornets at bay all night. Sacramento State finished with just 187 yards of total offense of the night, and Miles Killebrew blocked a field goal to keep the Hornets off the board. \nIn three conference games the T-Birds have given up just three points. They are indeed keeping the storm at bay. \nFollow Ryan Miller on Twitter, @millerjryan. 7 CONNECT 3 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://www.thespectrum.com/story/sports/college/southern-utah/2015/10/18/suu-football-t-birds-blank-sacramento-state-44-0/74166420/ TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T08:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T13:58:34.759+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
