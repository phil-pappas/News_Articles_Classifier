(AP Photo/Alex Gallardo) \nA look at what’s happening around the major leagues Thursday: \n___ \nWIN OR GO HOME \nThe final Division Series is to be decided with a deciding Game 5. The Mets and Dodgers face off in Los Angeles for a chance to play the Chicago Cubs in the Championship Series. The first pitch is scheduled to be thrown by Zack Greinke at 8:07 p.m. EDT. Jacob deGrom starts for the Mets. The NLCS begins at either New York or Los Angeles on Saturday. \nANOTHER ACE \nZack Greinke will try to match the gem thrown by Dodgers teammate Clayton Kershaw in Game 4 Tuesday. With the three-time NL West champions down 2-1 in the best-of-five series, Kershaw snapped his five-game postseason skid with seven impressive innings in a 3-1 win over the Mets at Citi Field. Greinke was the winner in Game 2, when Chase Utley keyed a seventh inning rally with a takeout slide that broke Ruben Tejada’s leg. \nENCORE PERFORMANCE \nMets shaggy-haired right-hander Jacob deGrom makes his second start in the Division Series. He beat Clayton Kershaw and the Dodgers in Game 1 at Los Angeles, striking out 13 to match Tom Seaver’s club record. \nCHANGE OF PLANS \nMets manager Terry Collins initially said Matt Harvey would not pitch again in the series after his Game 3 start to help limit his innings and protect his surgically repaired elbow. But on the flight to L.A., Harvey told Collins he wants to pitch if needed. “He said he’d be ready,” the manager said. \nGRAND(AL) PLANS \nDodgers manager Don Mattingly said All-Star catcher Yasmani Grandal is 50-50 to play because he tweaked his left shoulder in Game 3. Mattingly said the issue is whether Grandal can swing without pain; catching would not bother him. Grandal caught 26 of Greinke’s 32 starts in the regular season and was also behind the plate for the win in Game 2. \nDAY OFF \nThe Blue Jays and Royals have a day off after each won their deciding Game 5s. Toronto won a wild one over Texas, and Kansas City beat Houston behind Johnny Cueto to earn home-field advantage in the ALCS, which begins Friday night.
