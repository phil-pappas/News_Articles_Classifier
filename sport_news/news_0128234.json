Unfortunately for the Warriors, the success gained from that victory didn’t carry over into Saturday’s home game against Palisades . \nThe Pirates dominated Wilson from the get-go and cruised to a 35-7 Colonial League victory over the beleaguered Warriors at Smith Field. \n“We went back to our old ways,” said Senneca, whose team fell to 1-5. “We pick and choose what we want to do and I tell the guys you can’t win football games playing that way.” \nSenecca confirmed that junior quarterback Mike Glovas is out for the remainder of the season with a back injury. Sophomore Cameron Clark , who’s filling in for Glovas, and the rest of the offense struggled to get much of anything going, particularly in the first half when Wilson managed just three first downs. \n“Our defense was on the field entirely too long in the first half,” Senneca said. “We couldn’t sustain any drives at all. We put ourselves in bad situations.” \nThe defense kept it at a manageable 7-0 deficit with 4:40 left in the second quarter when freshman Ethen Aquino intercepted Palisades quarterback Austin Krauss with the Pirates on Wilson’s 17. \nPalisades (3-3) got into the end zone on its next series, however, on a 1-yard sneak by Krauss with nine seconds left in the half. The 14-0 deficit proved to be too big of a mountain for the Warriors to climb. \nThe Pirates tacked on another score in the third quarter before Wilson finally got on the board on a 9-yard touchdown pass from Clark to Jaykwon Jefferson . The 68-yard, 12-play drive was Wilson’s most sustained possession of the day. \n“We weren’t ready to play at all,” Senneca said. “We had no emotion, no energy. We played awful.” \nIf there was a bright spot for Wilson, it was probably sophomore running back Job Goodman , who rushed for 97 yards on 25 carries, including 8 runs for 53 yards on the Warriors’ scoring drive. \nGoodman had a huge game in the 21-20 win over Catasauqua, rushing for 169 yards and a touchdown on 29 carries. Clark chipped in with 109 yards on 20 carries and a TD in that game. \nThe Warriors found the offense much harder to come by against Palisades. \n“I don’t really take anything (positive) out of a loss,” Senneca said. “We took a step backward. We all show flashes at times. That’s the problem. We’re too inconsistent.” \nTom Hinkel may be reached at thinkel@lehighvalleylive.com . Follow him on Twitter @TomHinkelLV .
