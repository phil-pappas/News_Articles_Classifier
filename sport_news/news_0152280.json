Sharp, of Boulder, catches air in the terrain park at Eldora Mountain Resort in February. On Thursday, the U.S. Forest Service approved the resort's request to expand within its boundaries, but not, for now, outside of them. ( Jeremy Papasso / Staff Photographer ) \nHighlights of approved Eldora expansion \nTerrain: 188 new acres, including 163 tree-and-gladed \nLifts: Upgrades to the Corona and Challenge chairlifts \nSnowmaking: 25 acres of additional snowmaking coverage \nFacilities: New 16,000-to-20,000-square foot Challenge Mountain guest lodge and adding 300 seats to existing Lookout facility \nRead the decision: fs.usda.gov/project/?project=42285 \nWith ski season on the near horizon, the U.S. Forest Service on Thursday approved expansion plans for Eldora Mountain Resort — but for now, only within its existing boundaries. \nThe decision was seen as a shift toward meeting the concerns of expansion critics, after a draft ruling earlier this year did not advocate the resort staying within its current boundaries. \n\"This decision will allow the ski area to move forward with proposed improvements inside its existing special use permit boundary — such as replacing lifts, adding gladed terrain and new runs, improving snowmaking, and building and renovating restaurant facilities,\" a news release from the Arapaho and Roosevelt National Forests stated. \nThe decision defers all expansion outside the existing ski area special-use boundaries, providing an opportunity for Eldora to work with interested parties on the more \"controversial elements of the project,\" according to the release. Advertisement \n\"While the Environmental Impact Statement adequately disclosed the effects of these proposed projects, there were still environmental and social effects that could be better resolved,\" acting Forest Supervisor Ron Archuleta said in that same news release. \n\"I just felt like there was an opportunity for the stakeholders, the people who have an interest in Eldora ski area, to work together to come up with a refined proposal for expansion outside the existing boundary, before the Forest Service makes any decision regarding expansion,\" Archuleta said in an interview. \nEldora management has proposed to expand its boundaries by about 70 acres on the north, and 18 acres on the south. \nThe decision met less-than-rave reviews from resort officials. \n\"This decision is very different from the Draft Record of Decision and Final Environmental Impact Statement issued earlier in the spring and we are perplexed by it, particularly after dedicating significant capital and time for over six years to provide exhaustive details and thorough analysis to the Forest Service about the project, our efforts to mitigate and reduce impacts to wildlife and habitat, and improve services at Eldora Ski Resort,\" Jim Spenst, project manager for the Eldora Ski Resort Expansion Project said in a prepared statement. \n\"We will now begin to analyze our options, as this decision complicates the process moving forward. Regardless, we will redouble our efforts to work with the local community, county and Forest Service so that we can complete our project that will provide visitors the best possible skiing experience on the Front Range.\" \nA hope to see 'collaborative work' on expansion \nKey components of the expansion approved Thursday include about 188 acres of new trails and gladed ski terrain, upgrades to the Corona and Challenge chairlifts and about 25 acres of additional snowmaking coverage. \nAlso approved are the new 850-seat Challenge Mountain guest facility near the top of the Indian Peaks chairlift, plus renovation of the existing Lookout guest facility, boosting it from 3,000 square feet to between 7,700 and 9,700 square feet. \nA voluminous draft of the environmental impact statement on Eldora's plans had been issued by the Forest Service in February 2014, followed by a public comment period and a series of public meetings, at which public comment on the document was accepted. \nThose comments, including critical feedback from Boulder County commissioners who strongly urged that Eldora look for ways to improve strictly within its current boundaries — what many call the \"infill\" option — were weighed in producing the finalized environmental impact statement and draft decision. \nThe Forest Service issued both the finalized environmental impact statement, as well as a draft of its \"record of decision\" on the expansion itself March 17. That opened a 60-day window for objections to Eldora's plans to be registered. \nThose objections were heard at a public meeting July 17 in Fort Collins, and the tenor of that session did not leave environmentalists — many have coalesced under the banner of the Middle Boulder Creek Coalition — feeling optimistic. \nThe forest supervisor \"has already made up his mind to authorize the expansion,\" Mike Chiropolos, an attorney representing that coalition and the Sierra Club Indian Peaks Group, said in July. He also said at that time, not for the first time, that legal action by his clients was likely if the Forest Service decision gave Eldora's boundary expansion a green light. \nIssues raised by environmentalists included fears for resort encroachment on a wildlife migration corridor through the Middle Boulder Creek drainage on the resort's northern boundary, potential compromising of that watershed's health, and potentially degrading access to the Jenny Creek Trail by expanding its boundary on the south. \nIt was also in mid-July that Glenn Casamassa was replaced as forest supervisor for the Arapahoe and Roosevelt National Forest by Archuleta, who had previously served as deputy forest supervisor. \n\"The (July 17) objection meeting was an important piece of information that I considered when I made my decision,\" Archuleta said Thursday. \nAsked if there was a key factor that shaped Thursday's decision, Archuleta said, \"The pivotal point was pretty simple. It was just a desire to see if there was an opportunity for some collaborative work on expansion.\" \nHe offered no timeline for how fast that might occur. \nDecision called a 'short-term, win-win' ruling \nThe decision was well received by Boulder County officials, who had expressed misgivings about Eldora moving beyond its existing boundary. \n\"I think in Boulder County we're very pleased with the Forest Service decision,\" County Commissioner Elise Jones said. \"We think they took a very thoughtful approach to the issue.\" \nJones applauded \"the fact that it allows them to move forward immediately with improvements inside the boundaries, which will enhance the quality of the user experience for skiers and snowboarders, deferring the proposed actions outside of the boundaries, and that there is an opportunity for more collaborative problem solving to occur on that piece of the proposal.\" \nShe said county officials already have a meeting set for Monday with Eldora officials to discuss how the resort might proceed. \n\"Hats off to new Forest Service Supervisor Ron Archuleta for finding a short-term, win-win outcome,\" Chiropolos said in an email. \"Community members who use and love our National Forest appreciate that our public servants charged with stewardship are finally listening to residents and our elected local officials.\" \nHe also offered \"congratulations\" to Eldora management, saying, \"We look forward to working with the new general manager to explain why infill is the way to go -— not only as the best option for the forest and local residents, but also for Eldora's bottom line.\" \nEldora, located 21 miles west of Boulder, occupies about 1,204 acres of land. Of that, 524 acres are on Forest Service land, 220 acres are owned by the resort and 460 acres are on private land leased by Eldora in Boulder and Gilpin counties. Its elevations range from 9,200 feet at the base to 10,800 feet at the summit. \nEldora is going into the 2015-16 ski season with a new leader. \nIt was announced on Sept. 9 that Brent Tregaskis will be the new general manager. Most recently, Tregaskis was general manager at the Bear Mountain resort in the san Bernadino Mountains outside Los Angeles. \nTregaskis was taking over that position at Eldora from owner Bill Killebrew, who had been serving as acting general manager.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T09:00:35.718+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
