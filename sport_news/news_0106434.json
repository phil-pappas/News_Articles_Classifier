She participated in the February Soldier Ride ® Jacksonville .\nA new crop of riders will be in Jacksonville from November 19-22 .\nThis four-day event encourages participants to push their mental and physical boundaries through adaptive sports while bonding over shared experiences of service and sacrifice as they enjoy local flair.
