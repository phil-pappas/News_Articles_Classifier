Unlike last year, both the Eagles and the Cowboys are not very good. But the Cowboys, at least when healthy, have a chance to be very good. It's therefore a race to see how fast they can get healthy. \nThis week, the Cowboys play the Giants, who were taken apart by the Eagles last week. The Eagles attack featured one thing the Cowboys hope to have---pressure on the QB—and one thing they used to have. DeMarco Murray broke out of his slump, rushing for 110 yards and a touchdown. As far as the Cowboys are concerned, that's bad news. \nThe good news for the Cowboys is that as bad as Eli Manning was, Sam Bradford was probably a little worse. His 24 completions went for nearly 100 more yards than Eli's 24, but he had 3 INTs to Eli's 2. That's something the Cowboys can work with. It's starting to look like either Brandon Weeden or Matt Cassell may be, at least, not much worse than the guy helming their biggest divisional challenge. Not that Sam doesn't have more in the way of gifts than either of the Cowboys' QBs but right now his YPA and TD: INT ratio look just about the same. \nAnd this is where this weekend's game comes in. Wouldn't it be something if the major difference between a team which swung a big QB trade and signed the offseason's top RB and a team which had no established RB and its top two offensive options injured by the second game of the season, was defense? \nWhat the Eagles did to the Giants last Sunday is exactly what the Cowboys hope to be able to do this Sunday. With the likes of Greg Hardy, Sean Lee, Tyrone Crawford, DeMarcus Lawrence, and others—including a returning Randy Gregory , the Cowboys have all the tools to harass Manning into the same bad throws he made last week. Whether they will, against a guy who seems to be tough against the Cowboys even in his bad seasons, is another question. \nBut if they can, and if they do, it will go a long way to answering the question of whether the Cowboys can stay afloat in the NFC East until they get back some of the pieces they're missing on offense. It's not the season anybody expected, but it can still come out alright. \nRead more from Andrew on the Cowboys and Dallas Mavericks on Twitter @andytobo .
