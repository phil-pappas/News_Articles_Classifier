At first, I thought he was wearing a body suit, but after he ran past, (I could tell) he was buck naked.\" \nThis is not the first time a streaker has crashed a Hightstown home game. The Youtube video below captured a streaker called the \"Masked Avenger\" in video uploaded on October 30, 2010. \n\"I did have to laugh after the game and I was quite impressed with the athleticism of the kid to jump a high fence like that,\" said Steinert head coach Dan Caruso. \" As an educator and a football coach, though, it is a concern because you don't know what that kid was doing on the field. I spotted him right away and it was at a pivotal point in the game. I wasn't laughing during the game.\" \n\"I've never seen anything like it before,\" Gazdek added. \"The kid was pretty fast. He should be on the track team.\"The streaker made his in-the-buff dash just before halftime.\"I don't think it was anybody from Steinert because he had an escape route planned,\" Gazdek said. Here's the video from the 2010 streaker at Hightstown. We'll be on the lookout for this year's version.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T23:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T23:42:13.550+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
