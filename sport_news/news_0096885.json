And he was just as important on defense, recovering two fumbles – one for a score –and many more tackles to keep the Vikings in check. \n“It felt good cause everyone underestimates me,” Santos said. “I have to show them. And I have to play for (Diez), that’s my friend and my teammate. I had to do it for him.” \nVIDEO : Santos talks about passing test vs. Central Catholic \nSantos did just that, with physical runs and strong tackles that had shades of Diez all over them. \n“(Santos) was huge,” coach Jason Roeder said. “He’s gotta step in cause his buddy’s down. And he did that. He played both ways and he’s a tough-nosed kid. He’s turned into a great leader this year and I’m happy for him, the game he had tonight.” \nThe 5-foot-10, 220-pounder got in a groove on the Patriots’ second drive, which he capped off with a 4-yard touchdown run. \nSantos later gave Freedom the lead for good, 14-7, as he cut through the left side for a 26-yard touchdown. \nThe second half was Santos’ time to shine on defense. Seconds after Dom Harris strip-sacked Vikings quarterback Ethan Persa, Santos was there to pick up the loose ball and return it 22 yards for the score. \n“I just saw the ball and in practice, coaches tell me, ‘Scoop and score, scoop and score.’ So that’s what I did,” Santos said. “I just ran and kept running till I got the touchdown.” \nOn Central’s next possession, it was Santos again who got his hands on a fumble recovery near Freedom’s sideline. \n“Every time I see a ball on the ground, I’m just going to fall on it and it’s going to our ball,” Santos said. \nJoining Santos in the backfield was Jeremy Parker , who took seven carries for a gritty 18 yards. Junior quarterback Joe Young made a few big plays as well, the first one taking a mad scramble to gain 16 yards and the first down, setting up Santos’ first touchdown. \nYoung later connected with Jonah Gundrum for a 25-yard touchdown pass as Gundrum wrestled the ball away from a defender in midair before falling into the end zone. \nCordell Cotto hauled in Young’s second touchdown pass of the night, bowling over two defenders at the 5-yard line to get in for a 14-yard score. \nBut it all began with Santos, whose tough play early on showed the way to another win. \n“I felt good cause everyone was saying that was our first competition,” he said. “I was telling my team to go out and play physical, play hard and to get this win.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T06:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T01:52:59.164+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
