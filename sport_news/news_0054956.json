We were lucky to get the game on TV, I watched it from halftime. \n“But to see our supporters who stuck by me for the longest part of my journey, and have always been there to support me at this football club, that’s the reason why I wanted to come back.” \nGoodes said he knew he’d be protected and supported. \n“It was just a very special moment for me. As disappointing as it was to miss a game – and I hate missing games of footy – there was no way that I thought I’d come back from that. \n“But I’m glad I did because this football club means a lot to me, and it’s given me a lot of strength and a lot of good memories, memories I will always have with me. \n“There’s no bigger memory than to see the supporters and the love, and the way the boys played that day really showed how much I meant to them, which was really beautiful.” \nGoodes played the Swans last seven games of the season and coach John Longmire said he was one of the best performers in their two finals games. \nThe Swans announced on Friday that the club’s other retiring player, defender Rhyce Shaw, was joining their coaching staff.
