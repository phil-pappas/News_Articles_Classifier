(Photo: Tony Ding, AP)\n293 CONNECT 35 TWEET LINKEDIN 1 COMMENT EMAIL MORE ANN ARBOR, Mich. — Facing any in-state rivalry game, there's a balancing act between caring enough and caring too much. Put too much on one game, you risk overlooking opponents before or after. Don't value it enough, and the fan base gets furious.\nTwo coaches ago at Michigan, Rich Rodriguez was constantly criticized by fans and some media alike for \"not understanding\" Michigan's rivalry games, particularly the one against Ohio State. This stemmed from the fact he was not a \"Michigan Man.\"\nWhen Brady Hoke took over the program in 2011, he not only instituted two countdown clocks that the players walked by each day on their way to the locker room — one counting down to the Michigan State game and the other to Ohio State — he also started refusing to call Ohio State by its full name, opting instead for the gimmick of \"Ohio.\"\nThis season, Michigan's first under coach Jim Harbaugh, also includes games against Michigan State and Ohio State, but Harbaugh does not single them out. He got rid of the countdown clocks last winter and calls the Buckeyes by their proper name.\nUSA TODAY\nMichigan is streaking into relevance — and Big Ten contention\nHarbaugh and his players were asked on Monday — repeatedly — about Michigan State winning six of the past seven meetings with the Wolverines. The most common answer? \"The past is the past.\"\nThe most interesting iteration of that: \"The past?\" Harbaugh said. \"Think about the 'Lion King': Simba gets hit over the head, and he tells him, 'The past can hurt.' You can either run from it or embrace it and learn from it. I think that's exactly (the way) he said it. Those seem like very wise words.\"\nLater, Harbaugh checked to confirm the speaker of the phrase: Rafiki. \"Rafiki!\" he said. \"Wise words.\"\nUSA TODAY\nSmall shifts before big ones in the NCAA 1-128 Re-rank\nMichigan's players truly seem to have bought into this mantra about the past being, well, the past, just five days out from their game against the fourth-ranked Spartans. Though it's easy to spout cliches and say that they're taking it one game at a time, the Wolverine players seem to be doing just that — while also believing it. They said rivalry games have been de-emphasized from what they were in years past. \"You could say it was,\" fifth-year senior fullback Joe Kerridge said.\n\"From last year, it was,\" junior cornerback Jourdan Lewis said. \"Now, we're just taking it one day at a time. (Harbaugh) instills that in us every single day.\"\nSaid Kerridge: \"Taking down the clocks. Just looking at it game by game, week by week, day by day (now). I think that's something the team has believed in and put an emphasis on. What can I do today to get better?\"\nPlayers came so far as to admit that, yes, they'd like to be the top program in the state; that's important. Harbaugh did say because it's a trophy game, of course he wants to win the trophy.\nFollow the road to the 2015 College Football Playoff at The Football Four , our home to rate and debate the nation's best. But beyond that, there was simply a lot of praise for Michigan State, and a lot of talk about how the 14th-ranked Wolverines must continue to prepare and execute as well as they have been in recent weeks to have a chance to win Saturday's game.\nMostly, though, it's the same sort of thing they say every week. There were no additions to the war of words that's accompanied this rivalry since Mike Hart's infamous \"little brother\" comments back in 2007. And no more stakes thrown down into the ground before kickoff – so far.\n\"Looking at the Big Ten, there are a lot of great teams right now and you can never overlook a team,\" Kerridge said. \"You really have to focus on that week. It's a long season, but the weeks are short.\"\nTOP 35 HIGHEST PAID COACHES IN COLLEGE FOOTBALL\nFacebook Twitter Google+ LinkedIn Top 35 highest paid NCAA football head coaches Fullscreen Post to Facebook Posted!
