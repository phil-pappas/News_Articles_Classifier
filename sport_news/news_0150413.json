Plevy's hat trick was UMass' first since Michael Pereira did it in 2012 and the first by a freshman since Michael Marcou's three-goal game back in 2008. Plevy added an assist to finish with four points. \nPlevy's big debut wasn't finished, however. In game two Saturday night, the 5-foot-10 forward capped a four-goal third period by notching the game-winner with just over three minutes left to play in the Minutemen's come-from-behind 4-3 victory. \nShane Walsh scored twice in the comeback, with Steven Iacobellis adding a goal. Dennis Kravchenko finished with four points in game one (goal, three assists) while Walsh and Ray Pigozzi each added scores. \nHenry Dill started in net for the opener, making 39 saves and allowing the three Colorado College scores. Nic Renyard got the nod in game two, stopping 45 shots in his collegiate debut. HEA honors for Plevy \nPlevy's impressive UMass debut didn't go unnoticed. \nOn Monday, the freshman took home Hockey East rookie of the week co-honors alongside UConn's Maxim Letunov for his 5-point weekend. — Hockey East (@hockey_east) October 12, 2015 Congrats to @plevy14 -his 5 pt weekend helped us sweep- named @hockey_east rookie of the week. @UMassHockey — John Micheletto (@CoachMicheletto) October 12, 2015 \nAfter the disappointment of losing both Frank Vatrano and Brandon Montour to the professional level, the prospect of watching a first-year player with the potential of Plevy should be something UMass fans can get excited about this season. UMass getting votes \nOn the back of their strong 2-0 start, the Minutemen were among a handful of teams also receiving votes in this week's USCHO.com Division I poll . UMass grabbed five points, the same amount as Cornell and Maine and just ahead of Ferris State, Wisconsin and Brown. \nUMass is next in action Friday against Sacred Heart for the team's home opener at the Mullins Center. Puck drop is scheduled for 7 p.m. \nFollow MassLive.com UMass beat writer @Daniel_Malone on Twitter or reach him via email .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T23:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T01:22:33.549+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
