Newcastle is in the past, it's all over. I'm a man for the future, not to dwell on the past. It happened. \n\"Like I said at the time, I thought it was the right club at the wrong time for me and that was it. It was a decision made and you move forward. \n\"Since then, I have done pretty well since I have moved on, and now I am back up in the north east to try to make Sunderland the best I possibly can.\" \nAllardyce was coy when asked about the appointment of a number two, saying only that progress was being made, but refusing to name names. It is understood, though, it will not be Reid, with long-time associate Neil McDonald and Steve Round among those also being touted for the position.
