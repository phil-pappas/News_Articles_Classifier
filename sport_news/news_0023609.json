Morgan says there are currently no Federal Aviation Administration rules on drones. \nUK Police Chief Joe Monroe has said Wilson was operating the unmanned aircraft Sept. 5 outside the stadium when he crashed it into the suite level glass on the south side of the stadium. Several fans stood below, but no one was injured. The stadium was not damaged. \nAll content copyright ©2015 Pendleton Times-Post, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T14:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T15:29:31.118+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
