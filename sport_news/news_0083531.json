Kardashian's rep confirmed Friday that the message on the reality TV star's official app was posted by the family. \nIt read: \"As a family, we've decided to hold off on publishing content across our apps while we continue to support and pray for Lamar.\" \nShe also thanked fans for their kindness and understanding. The message was addressed to fans as a note from Kardashian. \nThe blog-like apps offer first-person postings with photos and advice. Announcing a posting black-out is a rarity for the family, who meticulously document their lives on various social media channels and on the \"Keeping Up with the Kardashians\" television show. \nMeanwhile, Odom's aunt and godmother is also thanking the public for its support, saying they're focused on his \"complete healing.\" \nPublicist Alvina Alston issued a statement Friday on behalf of JaNean Mercer, Odom's maternal aunt and godmother. \nThe statement said in part: \"No words can express the overwhelming gratitude we feel for the outpouring of support from around the world.\" \nAlston said Mercer is the sister of Odom's late mother who helped raise him in New York, where she still lives. Mercer and other family members are now in Las Vegas. \nThe statement said: \"His complete healing is paramount and our primary focus.\" Copyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
