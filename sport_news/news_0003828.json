Academy behind a school-record 263 yards rushing on 23 carries from senior running back Jay Harris. He also had two touchdowns in the victory from nine yards and 20 yards respectively.“It’s a credit to my offensive line who provided great blocking the entire night,” Harris said of his record-setting performance. “I wasn’t aware of approaching the record during the game. I was focused on the win.”The victory carried even more significance for the Lions since it was their first region contest of the season.“We faced a tough non-region schedule but now the team is ready to compete for a spot in the playoffs,” Harris said.“Our line got a big push up front and open up holes for Jay,” Lovett coach Mike Muschamp said. “Jay has a tremendous work ethic and a great attitude. As a coach, I love the example he sets for our team.”Harris’ rushing performance surpassed the previous mark of 260 yards set by former Lion and current Duke University player Zach Boden in the team’s 42-10 playoff win at Dade County on Nov. 29, 2010.Harris lists math as his favorite school subject and produces music, specifically hip-hop beats as a hobby. He plans to major in business upon entering college.The Lions will return to action on Oct. 9 in a home contest against Hapeville Charter.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T22:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T09:08:57.929+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
