Private burning shall only be allowed by the permission of local fire departments or local government.\nThe order is effective as of 6 a.m. on Oct. 16 and shall remain in effect until lifted.\nThe state-wide ban is in response to extremely dry conditions, abnormal emergency responses and adverse future weather predictions according to the Fire Marshal.\nThis ban does not apply to prescribed burns by the Department of Agriculture and Forestry, by those trained and certified by the Department of Agriculture and Forestry or by those who conduct prescribed burning as a “generally accepted agriculture practice” as defined by the Louisiana Right to Farm Law.\nViolation of the burn ban could result in criminal or civil penalties.\nCopyright 2015 WVUE .
