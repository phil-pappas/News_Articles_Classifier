A team with offensive talents such as Drew Doughty, Alec Martinez and Jake Muzzin expects more.\nLast season, Kings defensemen combined for 34 goals, or approximately one every 21/2 games. Only the Kings, Florida and Minnesota had yet to get a defenseman goal, and all had played at least six games.\nIt was even worse for the Kings, who also didn’t get a goal from a defenseman in the six-game preseason.\n“We’re trying,” said Muzzin, who led Kings defensemen with 10 goals last season. “I know myself, I have to do a better job at working to find (shooting) lanes and stuff like that. But sometimes we’re trying too hard to do too much and maybe simplify and just get it and shoot it and that’s the right play.”\nEntering Friday, Kings defensemen had attempted a total of 147 shots this season, but only 59 reached the net, compared to 46 shots that were blocked and 42 that missed the net. That’s not a great ratio.\nMuzzin knows better than anyone. He had attempted 36 shots, including 14 on goal, 12 blocked and 10 missed. For a defenseman, getting a shot blocked is particularly dangerous, because the opponent has the potential to pick up the puck and start a breakaway or an odd-man rush.\n“It’s tough,” Muzzin said. “(Shot blockers) are really good at getting in lanes and stuff like that. But it’s a challenge and you have to continue to work at it and improve at it.”\nGREENE TO IR\nThe Kings placed defenseman Matt Greene on injured-reserve with an upper-body injury. The move, retroactive to Oct. 13, is essentially for salary-cap bookkeeping purposes.\nGreene is already eligible to return from injured reserve at any time and could return during the Kings’ trip to Edmonton and Winnipeg on Sunday and Monday. Greene practiced again Friday, but Sutter indicated late this week that Greene was still experiencing pain from the undisclosed injury.\nThe Kings didn’t make any lineup changes Friday. Jamie McBain stayed in the lineup in place of rookie defenseman Derek Forbort, who missed Thursday’s game with an illness.\nSHOOTING STAR\nTanner Pearson led the Kings with a 17.6 shooting percentage last season, although Pearson’s season ended in January because of a broken ankle.\nPearson isn’t necessarily proud of his efficiency. He recorded just 68 shots on goal in 42 games last season, not a lot given that Pearson played a second-line role.\nPearson is now the Kings’ third-line left winger, but there are signs that he might become a more prolific shooter. In his first two games this season, Pearson recorded a total of only two shots on goal. But in his previous two games, entering Friday, Pearson totaled eight shots on goal.\n“When you shoot the puck, you want to try to create something,” Pearson said. “I don’t think I’ve taken nearly as many shots as I should. It’s probably even better to have a lower shooting percentage and take lots of shots and create more stuff.”\nPearson was still looking for his first goal of the season Friday. The ankle injury meant Pearson went eight months between regular-season games, but Pearson said he didn’t suffer any early season rust.\n“I think I felt pretty good,” Pearson said. “The exhibition games helped a lot, even though they’re not up to regular-season speed. Taking hits and giving hits was a good way to transition into it.”\nContact the writer: rhammond@ocregister.com", "external_links": ["http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/twitter-ico.jpg", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/fb-ico.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nwphzl-b88549294z.120151023210228000g96cp4ju.10.jpg", "http://assets.pinterest.com/js/pinmarklet.js?r=", "http://s7.addthis.com/js/250/addthis_widget.js#username=YOUR-ACCOUNT-ID", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/mail-ico.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nwphzl-b88549294z.120151023210228000g96cp4ju.10.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T17:12:56.086+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
