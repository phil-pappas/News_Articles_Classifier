(OzarksSportsZone.com) -- The Winona volleyball team is heading back to the Final Four with a quarterfinal victory against Miller on Saturday. The three-time defending Class 1 State Champion team won in straight sets, barely allowing the Lady Cardinals to reach double digits, 25-11 and 25-13. CLICK HERE FOR WINONA VS MILLER PHOTOS “We knew No. 22 (Jessica Estes) was a big weapon. But we really took care of business,” Winona head coach Francie McBride said. Miller head coach Tamara Landers said, “My girls played hard. They played tough. Winona has a great tradition. They’ve won three back-to-back state championships. It’s kind of hard to beat that. We were a little intimidated coming in, but we finally started kicking it in. It was just too late.” Miller’s key to the quarterfinals came from a win against the higher seeded Purdy team in three sets, 23-25, 25-18, and 26-24.“We were a little shaky in that first game, but once we started going we were going ,” Landers said. Despite the quarterfinal loss, Landers has a positive outlook for next year’s squad, even with team leader Jessica Estes graduating in the spring. “I’m just really proud of my girls,” she said. “We’re graduating three seniors, but my core group will be back. We’re excited for what the future holds for Miller volleyball.” Miller finished the season with a 14-15-3 record. SECTIONAL GAME Prior to the quarterfinal match, Winona battled some familiar faces that nearly ended the Lady Wildcats’ season. The Eminence Lady Redwings are one of Winona’s biggest rivals, as the teams are in the same conference, the same district, and the towns are only 11 miles apart.“We knew that was going to be the big game,” said McBride. “They’re such a talented team, a great team, and they played so hard. This meant everything for us. We really battled – mentally as well.” For this match, 25-19 seemed to be the theme. With the state title in mind, Winona quickly took the first set, 25-19. Eminence hasn’t been the Class 1 state champion since 2011, and battled back in the hopes of breaking the cycle. And sure enough, the Lady Redwings won the second set, 25-19. In a hard-fought third-set test, it was Winona who pulled out another 25-19 win to advance in the tournament. Specifically, it was Eminence’s Madison Keeling, Wendy Smith and Kimberly Rolen who threatened Winona’s chance to advance. McBride was pleased with her team’s strategy in conquering them. McBride said, “Some things we did really well. We had a great block up the first game, and I thought that made a difference. My girls just played their butts off. We didn’t let anything hit the floor defensively and we knew we had to play aggressive and hit the ball.” Winona, now 25-8-2, will travel to Cape Girardeau on Friday to compete against Bernie (24-8-2). New Haven and Santa Fe will also join them in the Final Four.“There’s a lot of scouting to do on Monday. We’re just going to get back to work. Maybe I don’t have the big guns that I’ve had in the past but they have the experience of being there and I feel like that’s an advantage,” McBride said.
