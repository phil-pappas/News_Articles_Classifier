We are fresh off of a bye-week and if you‚Äôre like me, you‚Äôve already got Weatherbug open on the weekly forecast with one thing in mind‚Ä¶ THURSDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL. Not only do we have the Auburn game to get us through this packed week, but then a historic Big Blue Madness on Friday! And with BBM comes Kentucky‚Äôs favorite rapper, Drake, who has the state buzzing over whether or not he‚Äôs going to make an appearance or dare I say‚Ä¶perform? I‚Äôll just be over here listening to all of his albums in hopeful preparation instead of listening in class, and dedicate this post to you, Drizzy. So while you, the BBN, waits for this amazing week in Kentucky sports (and utilize KSR to do so), let‚Äôs get some things covered. \n\nWe‚Äôve got Auburn on Thursday \nLike I mentioned, Kentucky football will face Auburn at our favorite Commonwealth Stadium this Thursday night at 7:00 p.m. Kentucky hasn‚Äôt beaten Auburn since 2009, but that‚Äôs probably not news to you. This is Kentucky‚Äôs first ESPN Thursday night game at home which is bringing in a serious crowd, seeing as tickets were sold out weeks prior to the matchup. We‚Äôve seen two sides to this Kentucky team, both strong and weak, and I know which one I‚Äôm expecting when the lights shine on CWS Thursday night. Left side, strong side! \n\nDrake Big Blue Madness on Friday \nI didn‚Äôt camp out for nothing! Friday night Kentucky fans will get to enjoy the 33rd Big Blue Madness either in person like myself, or live on television all the way through for the first time. With big recruits like Harry Giles, Marques Bolden and Rawle Alkins attending the event, we can expect this year‚Äôs event to be the best yet (Drake is rumored to be making a redeeming appearance). All we can do until Friday is try and predict what kind of ridiculous dance Matthew Mitchell is going to do and how many sorority girls will caption their pictures ‚ÄúI rock Kentucky blue on these ****‚Äù or ‚ÄúI need a girl from Kentucky‚Äù. \n\nUSA men‚Äôs soccer fell to Mexico last night \nOn a sadder note, Team USA couldn‚Äôt buckle down and get past Mexico last night in the CONCACAF Gold Cup, played in the Rose Bowl. The U.S. hasn‚Äôt beaten Mexico in the Rose Bowl in 21 years, leaving many wondering if that plagued the team. All I know is I stayed up until midnight on the edge of my seat watching Team USA answer every goal their opponents score until Mexico scored their third and final goal with two minutes to go, ending the match. All hope isn‚Äôt lost though, we‚Äôll get you in the next one Mexico. \n\nKentucky basketball is practicing live on television tonight \nGet your DVR set or get home from church early, I don‚Äôt really care, but one way or another you better have your eyes on Kentucky‚Äôs live practice tonight at 7:00 p.m. on ESPNU. This team is already looking amazing and after the pickup football game I watched at Big Blue Madness campout, the team bond these guys have is something you‚Äôll want to see. This is the return of Alex Poythress and the start of something new (insert Troy Bolton voice) for Kentucky. Tune in, or be square‚Ä¶or something else that rhymes. \n\nUK women‚Äôs soccer goes to Mississippi State tonight via UK Athletics \nWhile you watch the Cats on the big screen, check out the UK women‚Äôs soccer team as they head to Starkville, Mississippi to take on the Bulldogs on your computer! Kentucky is favored in the matchup as they‚Äôve shown many times this season their ability to dominate the field. With all of the Big Blue events going on this week, show our soccer ladies some love and cheer them on tonight by watching on the SEC Network+, Watch ESPN or ESPN 3. \n\nMatt Jones is already making moves on Kate Upton who will attend the Breeder‚Äôs Cup \nIt wouldn‚Äôt be a morning wakeup without something embarrassing Matt did over the weekend (or are those just my morning wakeup‚Äôs)? Any who, our own Matt Jones is putting the moves on blonde bombshell model/actress, Kate Upton, who will be attending the Breeder‚Äôs Cup according to Twitter. I‚Äôll let the Tweets do the rest of the talking. What hat am I going to wear?! üêé We are going to @BreedersCup ! Who‚Äôs coming with me? #AmericanPharoah #BC15 #GrandSlam pic.twitter.com/LzXMmxRv4R \n‚Äî Kate Upton (@KateUpton) October 10, 2015 I am totally available that day‚Ä¶ https://t.co/7Mji4s6c8j \n‚Äî Matt Jones (@KySportsRadio) October 10, 2015 \nLandon Foster is also attempting to get in on the action‚Ä¶ \n‚Äî Landon Foster (@BigBlueKick12) October 10, 2015 \nSo who will it be Ms. Upton? Article written by Kelsey Mattingly Drew Franklin is my spirit animal. @kelseyKSR One response to ‚ÄúDrake‚Äôs Sunday Morning Wakeup‚Äù ReedyCreekBuc October 11, 2015 at 9:04 am | Permalink | Reply \nForget running for congress!
