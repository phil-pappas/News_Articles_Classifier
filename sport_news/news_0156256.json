But the Mustangs, who have won a state-record 13 straight titles and 14 in 15 seasons, clearly are the team to beat.\nLAKE CENTRAL\nSchedule: Wednesday — Griffith vs. Highland, 5 p.m.; Gavit vs. Lake Central, 7 p.m.; Saturday — Championship, 1 p.m.\nOutlook: Lake Central has won 12 straight titles. A matchup between the Indians and Highland, which last won a sectional in 1999, could be a good one.\nMERRILLVILLE\nSchedule: Wednesday — Lowell vs. Crown Point, 5 p.m.; Kankakee Valley vs. Merrillville, 7 p.m.; Saturday — Championship, 6 p.m.\nOutlook: Crown Point shouldn't have much trouble winning its fifth straight title.\nHOBART\nSchedule: Wednesday — Portage vs. Hobart, 5 p.m.; Chesterton vs. Valparaiso, 7 p.m.; Saturday — Championship, 2 p.m.\nOutlook: Chesterton again has been the area's top team, and will be seeking its third straight title.\nSOUTH BEND ST. JOSEPH\nSchedule: Wednesday — South Bend St. Joseph vs. South Bend Washington, 5 p.m.; Michigan City vs. LaPorte, 7 p.m.; Saturday — Championship, 4 p.m.\nOutlook: South Bend St. Joseph has won five consecutive titles, but LaPorte has had an excellent season and could challenge.\nCLASS A\nRENSSELAER\nSchedule: Monday — Covenant Christian vs. Winamac, 4:30 p.m.; Wednesday — Hanover Central vs. Rensselaer, 4:30 p.m.; Saturday — Championship, 2 p.m.\nOutlook: The path could be open for Rensselaer to win its second straight title.\nWHEELER\nSchedule: Monday — Marquette vs. Andrean, 5 p.m.; Wednesday — Wheeler vs. Bishop Noll, 5 p.m.; Westville vs. Marquette-Andrean winner, 7 p.m.; Saturday — Championship, 2 p.m.\nOutlook: A realignment has beefed up this sectional. Wheeler has won four in a row, but Marquette and Bishop Noll could threaten that streak.\nBOONE GROVE\nSchedule: Monday — Boone Grove vs. Washington Twp., 4:45 p.m.; Tuesday — Hebron vs. Kouts, 4:45 p.m.; Wednesday — Morgan Twp. vs. Boone Grove-Washington Twp. winner, 4:45 p.m.; Saturday — Championship, 2 p.m.\nOutlook: Boone Grove and Hebron could be on a collision course.
