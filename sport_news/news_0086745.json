The Indians took on the Boston Red Sox in Game 1 of the 1995 American League Divisional Series, the first playoff game for the Tribe in 41 years. \nThe game featured two rain delays; Dennis Martinez vs. Roger Clemens as the starting pitching matchup; the confiscation of Albert Belle's bat after Boston manager Kevin Kennedy asked to have it examined; and a dramatic finish that saw the Tribe win, 5-4, in 13 innings. \nTony Pena's two-out home run to left field in the bottom of the 13th was the winning hit. \nIn recent interviews with Northeast Ohio Media Group, some of the key figures in the game recounted what it was like that night and how the game went down through their eyes: \nTom Hamilton, radio announcer: \"You remember the incredible electricity all season long and how it just kept building toward the playoffs. In a city that hadn't had a really good team since 1954. \n\"That was a good Boston Red Sox club. The (postseason) setup was not the same as it is now. You had the teams with the two best records playing in the first round. The Indians are facing Roger Clemens? Where's the reward in that for winning 100 games? \n\"You just felt if you lose Game 1 after such an incredible season, how is that going to set the tone for the rest of the series? And the last three games are in Fenway Park? Remember, this is Roger Clemens in his prime. It certainly wasn't an unrealistic thought that you could lose that first game and the entire complexion of that postseason might change.\" \nJohn Hart, general manager: \"We had such a phenomenal season. And now you look up and if we lose Game 1, three of the next four are in Fenway Park. All of a sudden we've got to win three of four or the magical season disappears. \n\"From the minute you know you're starting a best-of-five at home, you know Game 1 is going to be critical. On the heels of a magical season – it was like a college football atmosphere every night at our park, the love affair the fan base had with that team – we knew how big that game was going to be for weeks leading into the playoffs.\" \nCharles Nagy, pitcher: \"Not sure I remember a lot of the details of that game. That was a long night. The Red Sox were really good that year. They had a tough lineup. Short series. Roger Clemens on the mound. You couldn't help but feel nervous.\" \nDennis Martinez, at 40 years old, took the mound for the Indians against Clemens. \nMike Hargrove, manager: \"Dennis, being a veteran pitcher, we felt he was going to throw the ball where he wanted (regardless). They started Roger Clemens. So we knew it was going to be a close game. Do you play for one run? We didn't do that often that year. \n\"I had a lot of confidence in our offense. Felt if we could make Roger throw a lot of pitches early that we had a better than even chance. \n\"We had so many last at-bat wins that year. After a little while you start to believe.\" \nKenny Lofton, center fielder: \"I think the main thing was how we persevered. We had so many come-from-behind wins because we always felt we were always going to win. That was the attitude we brought to the ballpark. We stepped across the lines of the field and said, 'We're going to win. Bottom line, we don't care who's on the mound, we're going to win.' I think that was the attitude we had. \n\"I always look at it as, ninth inning, eighth inning or whatever, if we were down, you look in the stands and everybody was still at the ballpark. Not many people left. After a while people are like, 'There's a good chance they're going to come back.' The whole crowd would stay in the stands and it was awesome because you never knew when something special was going to happen with that team.\" \nThe Indians and Red Sox endured a pair of rain delays and entered extra innings tied, 3-3. Boston scored in the top of the 11th and Albert Belle responded with a game-tying home run in the bottom half of the frame. It produced one of the most iconic portraits in Cleveland sports history: Belle pointing to his biceps after Boston manager Kevin Kennedy had umpires confiscate his bat following the blast. \nHart: \"When Kevin Kennedy asked for Albert's bat, what went through my mind is that we were in their heads. They were paranoid. They thought we were stealing signs. That entire day, the league was out inspecting the ball park, the center field camera. We weren't doing anything like that. [Carlos] Baerga and Eddie Murray were just wizards at stealing signs.\" \nNagy: \"I was in the dugout. When Kennedy came out, I just remember thinking he was trying to get in Albert's head. I thought it was kind of bogus. But one thing I know for sure. I didn't work.\" \nHamilton: \"Albert's home run, in my mind, was the biggest of his career. Initially we didn't know what was going on when Kennedy came out. None of us had ever seen that happen in a game of that magnitude.\" \nBelle: \"It was after I hit the home run off Rick Aguilera. They confiscated the bat. After the game they immediately sawed it open and figured out there wasn't any cork. \n\"I was mad because they accused me of cheating. I told them, 'Hey, it's not about the cork in the bat, it's about the weight training and the long grueling hours I spent in the weight room.' At the time I did have some pretty big biceps and I was just showing them off.\" \nHargrove: \"After Albert hit the home run, I was absolutely livid Kevin Kennedy did that. We knew Albert's bats were clean so we weren't concerned at all. \n\"It was all gamesmanship. I think it said a lot about the way the Red Sox felt about us. I was screaming at Kennedy when he came out. I don't think we talked for two or three years after that.\" \nHart: \"Albert's reaction to [Kennedy] was priceless. It was like he was saying, 'Here's what's behind the bat.' Absolutely priceless. \n\"Look, nobody was happy that happened. I mean they took Albert's game bat, a bat he just homered with, and sawed it in half. But that was just the end of a long day where the league literally spent hours combing our ballpark.\" \nBelle: \"It just got us fired up after that. We went on to whup them two times after that and sent them home.\" \nTwo innings later, as the clock ticked past 2 a.m., Pena sent everyone home. The veteran catcher, who played 18 years in the big leagues, went to five All-Star games, won four Gold Gloves and played in two World Series, said his 13th-inning home run was the highlight of his career. He hit it on a 3-0 pitch from Zane Smith. \nHargrove: \"Tony was probably a step slower than me. If he gets on base there [via a walk] it might take two doubles to score him. So do I let him swing or have him take a pitch? That whole season I'd let my guys swing 3-0 a lot. I was undecided but leaning toward letting him swing away. One of the writers asked me later if I'd given him the green light or the red light. I said it was more amber than anything else.\" \nPena had replaced Sandy Alomar at catcher after Alomar was lifted for a pinch-runner. Pena was Martinez's personal catcher that season, but Hargrove elected to go with Alomar in Game 1. \nHargrove: \"Tony was as good a catcher as anyone. We came down on the side of Sandy being the better player when we made out the lineup for that game.\" \nBelle: \"We didn't know if he'd be swinging. I think he swung at a 3-0 pitch. Hargrove always told us \"unless the situation dictates it, we always had the green light. Just make sure it's a good pitch.' I think the opposing pitcher just laid it in there. He didn't think Tony would be swinging. He came up with a big hit. \n\"It just goes to show you with that particular team we had different heroes on different days and nights throughout the whole season.\" \nNagy: \"Tony gets the green light, swings and the ball just falls over the fence. I remember the excitement throughout the ballpark.\" \nOrel Hershiser, pitcher: \"What I remember most about that game is listening to the broadcast. Bob Costas is in the middle of some beautiful Vin-Scully-like story and he didn't realize Pena was at the plate. Then all of a sudden it's 'Pena, fly ball to left, game over' and he didn't get to finish his story.' That's what I remember the most.\" \nPena: \"I know Newman (third base coach Jeff Newman) gave me the take sign, but for some reason something told me, \"swing!'\" said Pena. \"As soon as I hit the ball, I knew it had a chance to go out of the ballpark. That was a team where everybody was pulling in the same direction. That was a team where everyone cared so much and we wanted to do well.\" \nHamilton: \"The way that game ended -- with Pena's homer -- that was a microcosm of the season. There were, what, 27 last-at bat wins in a 100-win season. Why would we expect Game 1 to be any different?\" \nHart: \"Tony is at the plate, 3-0 count, and you're thinking he's probably going to take a pitch. Next thing you know you're living one of those dream moments. Still gives me chills thinking about it. I'm driving down the road 20 years later [doing this interview] and I have a huge grin on my face.\" \nPena: \"If there is one moment in my baseball career that no one is ever going to take away from me, that is the moment. Nobody can take that moment away from myself and that one moment I will always remember. \n\"I get emotional when I talk about it.\" \n- NEOMG reporter Paul Hoynes and columnist Bud Shaw contributed to this post.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T13:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T13:30:15.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
