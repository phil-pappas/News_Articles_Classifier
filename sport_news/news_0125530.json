The footwear also protects feet from sharp objects, rough surfaces, biting creatures and other harm. The shoes enable the wearer to walk comfortably on land and in water. They increase the wearer's speed when swimming. Additionally, on land or sea, the footwear saves time and effort, and eliminates hassles and frustrations.\nThe original design was submitted to the Hollywood office of InventHelp. It is currently available for licensing or sale to manufacturers or marketers.
