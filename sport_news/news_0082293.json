Analysis: Nationals' Matt Williams was overmatched, inflexible in debut gig \n\"This was the first of the decisions we needed to make as we meticulously evaluate why the 2015 season didn't go the way we hoped,\" Nationals general manager Mike Rizzo said on a conference call Monday afternoon. \nWilliams constantly came under fire late in the season for his management of the bullpen, bunting philosophy and last week, how he handled a fight between Jonathan Papelbon and Bryce Harper in the dugout. \n\"Not one single incident was the tripping point of making the decision,\" Rizzo said. \nAsked about what characteristics he desires in the next manager, Rizzo cited \"leadership qualities, knowledge of the game and Xs and Os\" as important factors.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T22:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T05:49:56.701+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
