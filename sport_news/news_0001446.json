By Matt Law , European Football EditorFiled:   13:04 UK \nBarcelona vice-president Jordi Mestre has confirmed that the Catalan club will appeal the red card issued to Argentine Javier Mascherano in Sunday's La Liga clash with Eibar. \nMascherano was handed a straight red card in the 83rd minute of the La Liga contest, with referee Carlos del Cerro Grande's subsequent report claiming that the central defender had insulted the linesman's mother. \nMestre, however, has revealed that Mascherano has denied such accusations and the Catalan giants will now fight the decision. \n\"Mascherano says he didn't intend to insult the linesman, plus the referee's report is also wrong. We will appeal,\" Mestre told reporters. \nIf the card is upheld, Mascherano could miss Barcelona's next four league matches , including El Clasico away to Real Madrid at the end of November.
