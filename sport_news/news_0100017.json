Or if you haven’t coached something clean and effectively, how that can come back to haunt you.”\nPROVO — A gaffe made on special teams can dramatically change the course of any football game. It was a lesson demonstrated quite boldly last Saturday when Michigan State stunned Michigan after turning a muffed punt into a game-winning touchdown as time expired.\nLike many, BYU coach Bronco Mendenhall was tuned into the game, but missed the final dramatic play, choosing to go feed his horses with 1:43 remaining and Michigan appearing poised for the win.\nLater he learned of the outcome and was incredulous.\n“I’m in my truck to get a burger, a milkshake or something, and on the radio it has the score and I thought it was a mistake,” Mendenhall said. “So I went to my phone (to check) and I just couldn’t believe it. And then I saw the play and — holy cow, is that ever amazing.”\nBYU encountered its own special teams hiccup two weeks ago playing East Carolina. On a routine punt in the first quarter, assignment mistakes were made, allowing the Pirates to block the punt and return it for a touchdown.\nAlthough paling in comparison with Michigan's special teams' gaffe, it did give East Carolina an early 14-0 lead, forcing BYU into a comeback situation.\nIt was a mistake well-noted by Cougar coaches and something they've worked hard to prevent from happening again.\n“I think that block reminded all of us how fast a game can change,” Mendenhall said. “Or if you haven’t coached something clean and effectively, how that can come back to haunt you.”\nMendenhall has been pleased with the progress made on special teams through seven games played this season, stating, “Overall I think we’re solid and that we’ve played fairly consistently.\"\nInjuries mounting up: Mendenhall didn't release specific names of players dealing with injuries, stating on Monday that the injury list was \"significant.\"\nThe released depth chart offered some clues on who may be missing for Saturday's game against Wagner by not including offensive line starters Ryker Mathews, Lui Lapuaho nor Kyle Johnson on the two-deep roster.\nMendenhall noted that several more players may sit out this Saturday while acknowledging those injuries are at least coming at the right time considering all factors, including a game against a 0-6 FCS opponent.\n“I didn’t know the significance of the injury list until Sunday,” Mendenhall said. “This has been kind of the tipping point of numbers of injuries that have finally accumulated, so the bye after this game will be helpful.”\nEmail: bgurney@desnews.com \nTwitter: @BrandonCGurney", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T05:22:44.930+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
