Every Friday night, fans gather at stadiums across North Carolina to watch their favorite teams. \nThis week, Mother Nature has turned the game into an every-other-day-game for Randleman High School. After being shut out by Thomasville in Monday’s rescheduled game, the Tigers romped over Carrboro 57-0 at Charles R. Gregory Stadium in a game that was changed due to a scheduling conflict. \nNot bad for a two-week layoff and a month-plus away from home. \n“This week was interesting,” RHS coach Shane Handy said. “Tonight, we corrected some things that happened Monday night and played with confidence. They have players in spots who are very athletic. We just need to keep taking care of each other. A new season starts next week.” \nThe Tigers (2-3) outgained the Panthers 236-5 in the first half. Starting quarterback Bailey Welch, who only played the first half, completed 7 of 13 passes for 77 yards and two touchdowns, while notching seven carries for 47 yards and two scores. Starting receiver and backup QB Tanner McGee finished with a touchdown catch, run and throw, while Chad Norfleet led the ground attack with four carries for 79 yards and a score — all in the first half. \n“Bailey played a great game, running and throwing,” Handy said. “Our running backs gained some confidence. Tanner does a great job at wide receiver and he’s going to be a good quarterback. We need to get him prepared — you never know.” \nCHS (0-6), which has lost six starters to season-ending injuries, had three turnovers and three bad snaps on punts, adding to its woes. The Panthers rode junior running back Nate Oquaye, who finished with 22 carries for 83 yards. \n“We wanted to see where we were for Oct. 9 when conference starts,” CHS coach Melvin Griffin said. “This game helps us know where we stand. We’ve tried to eliminate people playing both ways, but we just have no depth. In the end, they were much quicker than we were.” \nThe Tigers scored on five of their seven first-half drives. \nRHS opened the game with an eight-play, 83-yard rumble capped by a 10-yard touchdown run by Welch. \nA bad snap on a Carrboro punt put the Tigers on the 12 for the next drive and RHS took advantage. Welch connected with Cyle Cassidy on the first play from scrimmage for a 14-0 lead with just over 7 minutes left in the first quarter. \nThe Panthers fumbled on the second play from scrimmage on the ensuing drive and RHS’ Nick Holder recovered the ball on the CHS 43. Three plays later, Norfleet rushed 8 yards into the end zone for a score. \nCHS managed a long drive to the RHS 36, but on fourth-and-14, Tyler Adams’ pass was intercepted by Umar Abdul Matin, putting the Tigers on their 17. RHS couldn’t move past its 37 and had to punt. \nFour plays later, CHS had another bad snap on the punt and the Tigers tackled punter Matthew Junker in the end zone for a safety and a 23-0 lead. \nAfter a 54-yard punt return by Norfleet, it took RHS three plays to score — on a 12-yard pass from Welch to McGee with just over 3 minutes left in the first half. Less than 2 minutes later, the offense then put together a four-play, 58-yard drive capped by a 9-yard TD run by Welch for a 36-0 lead. \nA bad snap put RHS at the Panthers’ 27 early in the second half. It took two pass plays for the Tigers to score, the second an 18-yard TD pass from McGee to Tre Brower that put RHS up 43-0 with just over 8 minutes left in the third quarter and allowed the officials to implement the running clock. \nCole Wyse added a 66-yard touchdown run less than 2 minutes into the fourth quarter, and McGee rushed 20 yards for a score with just under 2 1/2 minutes to play.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T06:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T09:13:27.893+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
