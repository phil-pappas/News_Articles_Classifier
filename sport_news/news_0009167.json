A A A \nThe West Ranch boys cross country team is out to prove they aren’t all bark and no bite this year. \nFor the second straight Foothill League meet, the highly ranked Wildcats proved why they’re the favorites and beat out perennial power Saugus on Thursday at Foothill League No. 2 at Central Park. \nAnd this time West Ranch did it even more convincingly, placing all five of its scoring runners in the top eight to put its score at 26 points compared to 56 for Saugus in second place. \nWith back-to-back league wins, the Wildcats are now in ideal position to claim its first Foothill crown in school history. \n“We’re so excited to be where we are right now, beating Saugus outright twice, that I think it would take a lot for us to not beat Saugus. I think the will is so there mentally among the guys,” said West Ranch senior Ryan Painter. \nThe girls’ race also saw the league’s frontrunner increase some distance ahead of second place. Five Saugus girls occupied the top six spots on the day to lead the Centurions to a jaw-dropping 16-68 point differential over second-place Hart. \nJunior Kaylee Thompson, making her varsity league debut with Saugus, won the race in 17 minutes, 38.34 seconds to lead the brigade of Centurions. After transferring from Valencia High School last school year, Thompson completed her CIF-mandated 30-day varsity sitout period last week. \n“It was definitely worth the wait,” said Thompson, who became the 10th straight Saugus girl to win a league meet. \nIt was fellow Centurion Ryan Tate who was the day’s best in the boys’ race, as he won by a good margin for the second straight league contest, in 15:04.18. \nTate and his Saugus team can now only split a league title with West Ranch at best. But even that would require a big surge in the final Foothill race on Nov. 5. \n“It’s going to be very difficult,” Tate said of the possibility of winning in the finals. “If we work hard and the confidence of our team is there, anything is possible.” \nGolden Valley’s Jonathon Bay took second in the race in 15:18.59. \nAfter that, five of the next six finishers were from West Ranch. In order, they were Tucker Welker (third, 15:28.69), Painter (fourth, 15:36.53), Preston Pope (fifth, 15:43.28), Jack Arnold (sixth, 15:44.06) and Justin Sherfey (eighth, 16:05.03). \nThe one in between the Wildcat pack was Saugus’ Jacob Crosson in seventh. \nThe Golden Valley boys were third place for the second consecutive league meet. Hart was fourth, led by Brandon Estrada’s 11th-place finish. Valencia was fifth, led by Spencer Makar in ninth, and Canyon was sixth. \nIn the girls race, Hart made the leap to second place after finishing third in the league opener. Golden Valley was third, West Ranch took fourth, Canyon was fifth and Valencia ended up sixth. \nAfter Thompson’s victory, teammate Mariah Castillo was next to finish in 17:50.31, followed by Ashley Heys in third (17:54.56), Sydney Suarez in fourth (18:03.56) and new-to-the lineup freshman Jacqueline Cascione in sixth (18:28.34). \nThe only girl who broke up the sea of Saugus blue was Hart junior Anely Avila, who was fifth place in 18:27.75. \nAvila said of keeping up with the league’s best: “I surged every mile so I was like, ‘OK, keep going, keep going, you got this. There was no backing down, and I did it.” \nGolden Valley’s Mykasia Simpkins finished seventh in 18:32.53, Hart’s Sophia Pearson was eighth in 18:36.15, Golden Valley’s Bianca Tinoco was ninth in 18:39.12, and West Ranch’s Sophia Hoelzel was 10th in 18:48.69.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T08:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T14:35:04.765+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
