But he also struck out four times in Monday’s win in a game started by Brett Anderson, hardly a Cy Young candidate.\nHis issues are bad enough that manager Terry Collins admitted the Mets “desperately” needed him to pick himself up.\n“There are times when he gets himself in situations where he thinks he’s got to hit home runs instead of just getting some line drives and getting some base hits and right now he’s not getting good pitches to hit,” Collins said. “And when he does, he might foul them off.”\nDuda struck out twice Tuesday and flied to center to end the game. The fly ball was a positive sign, according to Collins.\n“He finally got a ball off the plate that he hit pretty good,” Collins said. “But he’s a piece of our lineup that we desperately need to produce runs for us and right now he’s struggling.”\nIt’s hard to imagine the Mets pulling out a series victory with their top left-handed power source (at least until Daniel Murphy found his home-run stroke against the Dodgers) adding virtually nothing to the offense.\nDuda was bumped down a spot in the lineup to sixth against Kershaw. Before these rough four playoff games, Duda closed the regular season by going hitless in a dozen plate appearances, with a walk, a hit by pitch and six strikeouts.\nNow, he may have just one more game to put this slump behind him.\n“It’s definitely frustrating,” Duda said. “But you get over it and go to L.A. It’s a must-win game, but we’ve got to stay loose, stay positive.”\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google Whatsapp Email Filed under lucas duda ,  mlb playoffs ,  new york mets ,  terry collins", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T04:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T12:21:04.625+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
