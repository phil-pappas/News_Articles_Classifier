If that's not enough to fill your belly, go ahead and top it with a bacon cheeseburger or chipotle pulled pork! \nThere are also new places for fans to hang out before and after games, like the Wicked Tango Terrace on the suite level. \nIf you have a sweet tooth, look no further than the deep fried cookie dough pucks. \nYou read that right, deep fried cookie dough with raspberry dipping sauce. \nIt's out of this world. \nCheck out the video above for a preview of all the best new food options at the arena!
