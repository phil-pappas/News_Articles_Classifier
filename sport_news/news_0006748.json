After another double round of play today, two players will be left to battle for the championship on Thursday. \nSarah Davison, north Louisiana’s other standout, fell victim to some aggravating putting woes and lost her morning match 4-3 to Californian Whitney Britton. \nTonore admitted soon after the day’s second victory that her feet were numb but said, “but this is so much fun. It’s why you play. I had two tough matches and it feels awesome to know that I competed well enough to win.” \nIt won’t get any easier Wednesday for the West Monroe native who put her golf career on hold in 2004 until this year. She will tee it up at 8:10 a.m. against the defending champion, Margaret Shirley of Roswell, Georgia. This morning’s other three quarterfinal matches have Christina Proteau playing Paige Bromen at 8 a.m., Lauren Greenlief at 8:20 and Louisiana’s third representative, Kay Daniel of Covington, playing Whitney Britton at 8:30. \nAsked if she felt fatigue was grabbing her at any point in the afternoon match, Tonore said, “You know I was 3-up after 12 and then lost 13 and 14. On 15 I had a 4-foot par putt to halve and I seemed to lose focus over the ball and had to step back (she made the putt). I guess that was when I felt a little tired. But, really, adrenalin takes over on a day like this so I never felt fatigue would do me in.” \nIt was actually 27-year-old Rachel Smith of Mansfield, Texas, who nearly did her in with a power game and high flying irons that seemed to get more accurate as the day went on. \nStill, Tonore was up by one before a big putting mistake cost her the lead on No. 17, once again sending her to 18, where she won on Monday and had forced a playoff earlier in the day Tuesday. \n“Even when I lost 17, I told myself that good things had already happened for me twice on 18. I then hit one of my better drives of the day and hit a good iron to the middle of the green,” said the former LPGA player. \nAfter the two halved 18, they headed to No. 1 with the sun setting. Both hit the green, but Smith three-putted and when Tonore rolled in her par putt from just two feet, she had the match. \nDavison’s lost was a bitter pill to swallow after she had played well in qualifying, earning the No. 3 seed, and then won her opening match. \nThen came Tuesday. \n“I felt like I hit the ball well the entire round but I kept putting so much stress on myself with poor speed on my putts. It makes every hole a grind when you are putting poorly,” remarked the 2009 and 2013 Louisiana State Women’s Amateur champ. \n“Still, while I am disappointed to lose, I couldn’t be prouder of the way our community and our Squire Creek staff have answered the challenge of hosting this year’s national championship. I have heard a ton of compliments all week. It has been a great team effort by everyone around here,” she added.
