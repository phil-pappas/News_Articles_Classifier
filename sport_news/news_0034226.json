First, both teams knew the result could decide the division title. And Ameti was still feeling disappointed with how he'd played in the Golden Panthers' defeat of Hanover Park on Wednesday. \nAmeti resolved \"to come out and win it for my team.\" That's exactly what he did, scoring two goals as Pequannock defeated the upstart Bombers, 3-2 in double overtime. \nAmeti poked home the winning goal out of a crowd in front of the net with 4:47 left in the second OT period. \n\"I barely saw it,\" said Ameti, who also scored the Golden Panthers' first goal in the comeback victory. \"It was around the goal line, and I thought, 'I have to do this for my team, for us. ... We had to come together and play as a team. We kept pressuring and pressuring them, and that's what won us the game.\" \nThough Pequannock (11-6-1) had already beaten the Bombers, 3-1, three weeks ago, both teams spent the first half testing each other. The Golden Panthers spent much of the early going in its own defensive third, but Boonton's shots were off-target. \nThe Bombers were able to settle at halftime, playing the ball on the ground — and capitalized on their first opportunity. Sophomore Bryan Ohlott stole the ball, dribbled around a defender, drew out Pequannock goalkeeper Billy Troast, and scored on a low roller. \nIt was the first shot of the second half, four minutes in. \nThe Golden Panthers didn't sit back, and Ameti was soon able to take advantage of a Boonton mistake for his first goal. Senior midfielder Liam Lilienthal gave Pequannock its first lead 10 minutes later on a long shot from the left side that slipped just inside the far post. \nBoonton sophomore Grant Barrientos tied things up again. The defensive midfielder picked up a centering pass from Rakip Veliu, took one touch to settle the ball, and placed it just inside the left post. \n\"We made it far,\" Ohlott said. \"We were hoping for the conference, and it's still possible. ... I don't want to let that happen again. We're so close.\" \nPequannock can clinch the NJAC-Independence title by defeating Kinnelon on Monday. A loss or draw by the Golden Panthers, and Boonton (11-6-1) will clinch its first division title — an additional accolade in the program's first winning season since 1987. \n\"We worked so hard just to lose,\" Barrientos said. \"We've come so far to let it slip out of our hands in the dying minutes.\" \nStaff Writer Jane Havsy: 973-428-6682; jhavsy@gannettnj.com; www.dailyrecord.com/writerjane/ 1 CONNECT 1 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://dailyre.co/1S1yDzf TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T03:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T00:41:37.658+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
