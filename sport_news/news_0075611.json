EBay jumped 13 percent after reporting results that were well ahead of analyst expectations. McDonald's gained 7 percent after reporting sales gains. American Express sank 6 percent after its results fell short of forecasts. The Dow climbed 236 points to 17,406 as of 11:45 a.m. Eastern time. The S&P 500 increased 27 points to 2,046. The Nasdaq rose 68 points to 4,909. NEW YORK (AP) - McDonald's sales in the U.S. have edged up for the first time in two years. The world's largest burger chain saw a nearly one percent uptick in sales at established U.S. locations in the third quarter, and attributes the improvement to menu changes. The company has been trying to win back customers by adapting to changing preferences. Tweaks include swapping margarine out for butter on the Egg McMuffin, searing burgers and toasting buns longer. McDonald's has also said it will start using cage-free eggs. DETROIT (AP) - The UAW has approved a new four-year contract with Fiat Chrysler. Union members at Fiat Chrysler's U.S. factories voted 77 percent in favor of the agreement that covers 40,000 workers. It's the second time in a month Fiat Chrysler workers have voted on a contract. A previous deal was rejected because it didn't eliminate a two-tiered pay system. The new agreement gives raises to all workers and eliminates the two tiers over eight years. PEORIA, Ill. (AP) - Caterpillar is lowering its 2015 earnings forecast after revenue fell short of expectations in the third quarter. Weakness in the mining and oil and gas industries is weighing the company down. Last month Caterpillar announced another round of job cuts that could exceed 10,000 people through 2018. Its third-quarter revenue fell short of analyst estimates-- to less than $11 billion, compared with more than $13.5 billion for the same time last year. DALLAS (AP) - United Continental has posted a record third-quarter profit thanks to lower jet fuel prices. Net income was $4.82 billion for the period from July through September, including an income tax-related benefit of $3.22 billion. Without that and other one-time items, the airline said it earned $1.7 billion, or $4.53 per share. In announcing the earnings, the airline's new acting CEO renewed his predecessor's pledge to improve service and boost profit margins. Brett Hart was named acting CEO on Monday after Oscar Munoz suffered a heart attack. Â© 2015 Associated Press. All rights reserved.
