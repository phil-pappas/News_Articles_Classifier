He said he felt the hamstring grab while he was rounding second, and manager Joe Maddon said the rookie had a moderate strain.

Hopefully if everything plays properly and we have another opportunity to play in another round he might be available at that time, but for sure not this one.\" \nMaddon said they haven't made a decision on Russell's replacement for the NLCS roster, which must be submitted by Saturday morning. Reliever Jason Motte, who has been out with a right shoulder strain, is a possibility for this round, and Maddon said he likely will use four starters in the best-of-seven series. \nThe Cubs worked out for about two hours Thursday, with their young sluggers putting on another show during batting practice. But there was nothing like the drive Kyle Schwarber hit during the final game against St. Louis, a massive solo shot that settled on top of the scoreboard in right field.

The plan is to leave the ball there for at least the rest of the playoffs. \n\"It's pretty cool that it'll stay out there throughout this postseason,\" Schwarber said. \"Just a good honor. You know, it's, I just look at it as another home run.\" \nBaez, another one of those promising young hitters, replaced Russell in the NLDS, and hit a three-run homer in Chicago's series-ending 6-4 victory in Game 4. The 22-year-old slugger has big-time power, but he has struck out a lot during his brief time in the majors.

I want to believe that Javy is arriving at that same point,\" Maddon said. \"I think to hit a three-run homer in a playoff game like that against one of the best pitchers in the National League should boost your confidence.\" \nAfter Lester pitches in the opener Saturday night, Jake Arrieta will go in Game 2. Lester is 6-5 with a 2.66 ERA in 15 career postseason games, including 13 starts. \nArrieta threw a five-hit shutout in the wild-card game at Pittsburgh but had his worst start in months when he allowed four runs in 5 2-3 innings in Game 3 against the Cardinals. Lester hasn't pitched since the NLDS opener last Friday.

(AP Photo/David Banks) \n\"It's been a while since Jon's been out there, so it's good for him to get out there Game 1,\" Arrieta said, \"and I'll be ready for Game 2.\" \nArrieta, one of the favorites for the NL Cy Young Award, is up to 243 2-3 innings this year, easily cruising past his previous career high of 156 2-3 innings from last year. The right-hander threw a side session Thursday and said he is fine. \n\"I think the playoff atmosphere can drain you of energy mentally and you spend a lot of brain power throughout the day contemplating things, thinking about different scenarios and it can be taxing, and sometimes that'll translate into some physical fatigue,\" he said.
