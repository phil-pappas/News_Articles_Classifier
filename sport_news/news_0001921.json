His last three seasons ended early due to injury, and he hadn't played since January. \n\"It's coming, it's coming,\" he said. \"I'm still taste-testing some things, but I feel great.\" \nRAPTORS: Lowry missed the Raptors' second preseason game with a sore right groin, but there was no indication of any lingering effects as he scored 14 second-half points, including nine straight in the third quarter. \nLAKERS: Lou Williams scored 19 points against his former team. Julius Randle added 17. \nMISSING: Lakers guard D'Angelo Russell sat out with a bruised glute. The first-round draft pick was hurt in Tuesday's preseason game, a loss to Utah in Honolulu. Brandon Bass was held out after MRIs revealed a bruised left patella. \nSTAR WATCH: Bryant's line included three assists and three rebounds. Metta World Peace scored six points. \nUP NEXT: The Lakers will host Maccabi Haifa on Sunday night in their first preseason game at Staples Center. The Raptors return home to host the Minnesota Timberwolves on Monday night. \nThis story has been corrected to show that Carroll scored 18 points and Williams scored 19. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T08:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T08:44:50.147+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
