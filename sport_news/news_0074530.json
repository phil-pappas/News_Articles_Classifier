(Getty Images) \nThe abbreviated story of Game 2 of the National League Championship Series on Sunday night happened in the bottom of the third inning. With the Mets up 3-0 on Jake Arrieta and first base open after Curtis Granderson stole second, Cubs manager Joe Maddon elected to intentionally walk Daniel Murphy to face Yoenis Cespedes. Think about that for a minute. Cespedes, who hit 35 homers on the year and posted a .942 OPS since joining New York for the final 57 games of the season, was seen as the preferable batter to face in this scenario. So, Murphy took first and Cespedes proceeded to eke out an infield single between third and short that scored Granderson and gave the Mets a 4-0 lead that would prove insurmountable. \nNoah Syndergaard, all of 23 years old, was lights-out for 5 2/3 innings, striking out nine and allowing only three hits, a walk, and an earned run, and the subsequent parade of Mets relievers -- Jon Niese, Addison Reed, Tyler Clippard, and the nearly unhittable Jeurys Familia -- cleaned up with 3 1/3 scoreless innings to close out a 4-1 win in front of the second-largest crowd -- 44,502 fans -- in Citi Field history. \nYour browser does not support iframes. \nIt was a shockingly ineffective start for Arrieta, who had given four earned runs over his final 12 starts of the regular season combined (88 1/3 innings). He only allowed four hits to 19 batters over five innings, but his command was inconsistent. Between changeups and curveballs to lefties, only five of 16 pitches were strikes, which could be due to sequencing, but the Mets' hitters worked him hard and were patient with what he gave, forcing 94 pitches out of him through five. By the time the top of the sixth rolled around and the Mets still had their four-run lead, it made more sense to pinch-hit Arrieta with Tommy La Stella, who double-switched into the game at second base. The gamble didn't pay off, and the Cubs never mounted a rally that showed any promise. \nThe Mets' pitchers, through the first two game of this NLCS, have been the most compelling story. But a very small notch below them is Murphy, who is playing baseball on a whole other plane of existence right now. After David Wright's double in the bottom of the first put the Mets up 1-0 before Arrieta could even record an out, Murphy smacked a low, 80-mph curve just inside the right-field foul pole to put the home team up 3-0. It was, according to Baseball Savant's Daren Willman, the third-lowest pitch hit for a home run all season . And now Murphy has hit home runs in four consecutive playoff games -- one short of Carlos Beltran's all-time mark -- and tied Mike Piazza for the Mets' all-time lead in playoff homers with five in 15 fewer games (22 to 7) than it took Piazza. \nYour browser does not support iframes. \nThe BABIP gods weren't quite as down on the Cubs as they were in Game 1 , but Chicago could still only muster five hits against 99 strikes thrown by Mets pitchers. Granderson did rob Chris Coghlan of a homer in the top of the second with an extended glove over the right-field wall, but the Cubs -- beyond a Kris Bryant RBI double in the sixth that chased Syndergaard -- could not do anything offensively. \nThe good news is the mets can now get to go home to Wrigley for Game 3 Tuesday night. The Mets will throw Jacob deGrom, who won Games 1 and 5 against the Dodgers in the NLDS, while Chicago goes with Kyle Hendricks, who couldn't get out of the fifth inning in the Cubs' Game 2 win over St. Louis in their Division Series. \nIt'll be up to Hendricks and company to cool off the unstoppable offensive force that is Daniel Murphy, which sounds like such an insane statement to utter in public, but here we are. If Hendricks can't, this series may well be over by midweek.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T08:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T14:20:09.517+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
