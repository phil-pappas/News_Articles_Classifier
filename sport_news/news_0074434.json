However, both have bounced back and have an opportunity to improve their postseason seeding by locking up second place in Region 2-6A. Since suffering a pair of disappointing losses to Gallatin and Cane Ridge, along with a narrow overtime defeat at first-place Ravenwood, Mt. Juliet has strung together consecutive victories over Franklin County, Lebanon, Wilson Central, Overton and Antioch. Franklin has won four of its last five, and the Rebels, led by senior running back Lannom Craddock (860 yards rushing), have eclipsed the 400-yard mark in each of their last two wins. Mt.

Unfortunately for the Cavaliers, led by senior running back Vic Johnson (194.3 ypg), they’ll be closing out the regular season with a pair of Region 2-6A foes from Murfreesboro. Johnson will be facing an uphill battle this week, as Oakland, second in Class 6A, hasn’t allowed a 100-yard rusher since a Week 3 win over Siegel. The Patriots, also No. 2 in The Tennessean Midstate Top 10 , rolled to a convincing 43-14 over Riverdale a week ago, surrendering just 68 yards rushing. Oakland 34, Cookeville 17.

Since suffering a 42-30 setback to top-ranked Brentwood Academy on Sept. 18, the host Red Raiders, No. 2 in Division II, have strung together three straight wins, including an impressive 38-14 throttling of crosstown rival McCallie. MBA, led by standout running back Ty Chandler (1,352 yards rushing, 18 TDs), is coming off a much-needed bye after being rocked by Brentwood Academy 48-14. The Big Red suffered a 23-20 regular-season loss to Baylor a year ago, but the defending champion edged the Red Raiders 31-29 in last year’s Division II-AA semifinals.

In order to make it five of their last six, however, the Bulldogs, led by versatile athlete Ikenne Okeke (719 all-purpose yards, 3 total TDs), will need a win against a team from Murfreesboro — something Smyrna failed to do in 15 of its last 16 tries. Riverdale, which had its four-game winning streak snapped with last week’s 43-14 loss to Oakland, is looking to get back on track after managing just 245 yards against the Patriots while committing three turnovers.

The Cougars are tied with Henry County atop the Region 7-5A standings. The Hawks, fourth in 7-5A, also entered its bye on a high note, having throttled West Creek 41-0 the week before. Rossview quarterback Jordan Justice (1,146 yards passing, 17 total TDs) has been solid, but Centennial’s defense hasn’t allowed much through the air, at least not since its 49-6 Week 2 loss at top-ranked Independence.

Standing in the way, however, is a struggling Ensworth squad desperately in need of a win. The Irish are coming off a 45-7 throttling against top-ranked Brentwood Academy — their third 30-point loss of the season — while Ensworth has endured back-to-back defeats to BA and McCallie. The Tigers, led by senior Darius Morehead (827 yards rushing, 10 touchdowns), will need to close out their season with consecutive wins in order to avoid their first sub-.500 regular-season finish since 2005 — the team’s first year of competition.

(8-0, 5-0) \nWhen: Friday, 7 p.m. \nA region championship will be on the line when these two high-powered 6-1A unbeatens square off. Huntingdon, ranked second in Class 1A , is averaging 52.1 points — good enough for second in the state — and the Mustangs have outscored their first eight opponents by a combined 417-93. Aside from the team’s 28-27 Week 2 triumph over Scotts Hill, fifth-ranked Wayne County hasn’t encountered much resistance either. Quarterback Preston Rice completed 9 of 12 pass attempts for 225 yards and four touchdowns in last week’s 45-14 victory over McEwen, and the Wildcats have eclipsed the 40-point mark in each of their last six wins.

The Bears, led by senior quarterback Kyle Gilbert (1,518 yards passing, 14 TDs), will look to get back on track against dangerous Donelson Christian. The Wildcats carried a 10-point lead into the final quarter of last week’s game at Friendship, but the Commanders closed things out with 13 unanswered to a claim a 16-13 victory. DCA has dropped two of its last three, but sandwiched in between two losses is an impressive 20-17 win over three-time defending state champion Knoxville Webb. Davidson Academy 21, DCA 20.

(7-1) \nWhen: Friday, 7 p.m. \nBrentwood Academy, ranked 32nd nationally by MaxPreps, will face its third out-of-state opponent as University Christian makes the nearly 500-mile trip from Jacksonville, Fla., to Carlton Flatt Field. The Eagles, who’ve outscored their six in-state opponents by a combined 303-65, opened with a 48-6 win at Olive Branch (Miss.) before suffering their only loss a week later — 31-13 to Trinity (Ky.). The Christians, who compete in the Florida High School Athletic Association’s Class 2A, have scored at least 60 points in four of their first seven games and have twice eclipsed the 70-point mark.

If they can somehow pull off that improbable feat, MTCS will still need Monterey to lose its final two games at Clay County and at Jo Byrns. Nashville Christian, led by standout linebacker and Tennessee commitment Daniel Bituli, has outscored its previous two opponents by a combined 119-6, and the third-ranked Eagles haven’t lost to the MTCS since 2008.
