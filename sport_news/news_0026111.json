The Panthers answered back late in the first quarter after a blocked Mount field goal attempt. \nThroughout the game, the Lions and the Panthers traded touchdowns with the Lions maintaining the lead the entire game thanks to a made Shane Kelly field at the end of the first quarter. \nWith less than five minutes left in the game and the Mount only up three, Hanover's Zachary Donan fumbled the ball with Hannah falling on the ball to give the Lions the possession. That next possession for the Lions, Darius McDonald racked up 28 yards in three plays to score, giving the Lions the lead by 10. Mount St. Joseph retained the lead for the rest of the game. \nSTANDOUTS \nMcDonald finished with 94 rushing yards and two touchdowns on the day. Williams led the team in passing yards (266) and in rushing yards (110). Garrett Weaver continued to put up impressive numbers, having 99 recieving yards and two touchdowns. \n\nUP NEXTThe Lions travel to Franklin College (3-2, 3-0 HCAC) at 1:30 p.m. Saturday on Schueler Field at the Mount Athletics Complex. \n\nImage and information provided by MSJ athletics Related Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T20:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T01:21:22.470+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
