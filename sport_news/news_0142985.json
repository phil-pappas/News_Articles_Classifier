The win over the Huskies was sloppy and the score, 30-13, was not indicative of what actually transpired. The Cougars will need to clean up those mistakes to prepare for an East Carolina team that has looked pretty good this season. \nThis game will come down to which team can win the key statistical matchups. Here are what the Cougars and Pirates will focus on Saturday: BYU rushed for a season-high 174 yards against Connecticut \nDid the Cougars finally find a run game? The Huskies have a middle of the pack run defense that gives up around 170 rush yards/game. But yes, the Cougars finally established the run game and will need to continue to run the ball on the Pirates. \nAs I said in the KSL.com Campus Report BYU suffered 7 shoulder injuries against Connecticut \nBronco Mendenhall told the media that there were \"up to seven different shoulder injuries\" against the Huskies. He did not disclose who suffered the injuries, but at least one is wide receiver Mitchell Juergens. \nJuergens is a big part of the Cougars' receiving threat. He leads the Cougars in receiving yards with 324 on 25 receptions. That's impressive given last season Juergens finished with 28 receptions for 424 yards. Juergens will play a big role against the Pirates with his ability to open up the field for both the run game and the outside receivers. East Carolina will play 2 quarterbacks against BYU \nTwo-quarterback systems are usually frowned upon in college football, but the Pirates have found a way for its two signal callers to coexist. James Summers will most likely start and Blake Kemp will come in every other series or so. \nSummers is a dual-threat quarterback. For the season, Summers is 17-22 for 276 yards passing with three touchdowns. Where he's dangerous is with his legs. In his last two games, Summers has rushed 30 times for 254 yards and four touchdowns. \nMangum's freshman school record 365 yards passing against UConn \nComing into their matchup with the Huskies, the Cougars knew they were going to throw against a solid Huskie secondary. The Huskies are 27th in the FBS in passing defense, and they were rocked by a freshman quarterback. Mangum's 365 yards passing was amazing looking at how the Huskies' pass defense has been really good this season. \nMangum is currently on pace to set freshman school records in completions, passing yards and passing touchdowns. BYU is one of the worst punt return teams in the FBS, averaging only 3.9 yards/return. \nIs anybody else scared for Micah Hannemann's life when he doesn't call for a fair catch? It's a miracle he hasn't been knocked into the next state yet. Hannemann will catch the punt and fall forward, gaining about 4 yards. He either needs to learn how to call for the fair catch or maybe the Cougars need to find a new punt returner (paging Devon Blackmon).", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T17:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T20:16:17.899+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
