University of Nevada, Las Vegas had its first classes in 1959 — as a southern satellite of UNR.\nAcademics: UNR ranks 187th in the U.S. News and World Report’s 2016 list of national universities, while UNLV fails to crack the top 200. But UNLV’s College of Hotel Administration ranked second in DegreeQuery’s top colleges for hospitality and hotel management and it’s law school ranks 67th in the U.S. News and World Report’s annual rankings. UNR’s medical school ranks 88th for research in the U.S. News and World Report list. UNLV won’t have a medical school for another few years.\nSports: Both UNLV and UNR offer a combination of 16 total varsity sports between the schools’ respective men's and women's teams. With a 24-16 overall record and nine wins in the last 10 matchups, the Wolfpack have the edge on the gridiron. But with four Final Four appearances and a national championship in its basketball history, UNLV is the more successful school on the hardwood. UNR has yet to make it past the Sweet 16.\nAlumni: UNLV boasts alumni names like chef Guy Fieri, comedian Jimmy Kimmel and U.S. Congresswoman Shelley Berkley, while UNR alumni include San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick, businessman Sig Rogich and Nevada Governor Brian Sandoval.\nUNLV had 28,525 students in the 2014-2015 school year, per U.S. News and World Report. UNR had 19,934 students.\nCost of attendance: Practically identical. At UNLV, a year of tuition for in-state students costs $6,940, according to the most recent data from the U.S. News and World Report. Out-of-state students pay $20,850 per year and an additional $10,730 annually for room and board.\nAt UNR, a year of tuition for in-state students will run about $6,900, per U.S. News and World Report. Out-of-state tuition is about $20,810. Students can add room and board for an additional $10,250.\nScholarships: UNLV grants an average of $5,660 need-based scholarships to students, and $3,450 in non-need-based merit scholarships, per U.S. News and World Report. UNR hands out an average of $5,020 in need-based scholarships per student and an average of $2,620 in non-need-based awards.\nFuture: UNLV is set to open the state’s second medical school and a $56 million hospitality hall addition to its college of hotel administration, in fall 2017. Construction on UNR’s campus includes a $65 million business school building in southern Reno and a $57 million, 130,000 square foot dorm hall on campus, also to be completed in 2017.\nNone of this really matters when the two teams run onto the football field Saturday afternoon. The outcome of the game will be determined by X's and O's. Although it would be fun to hear UNLV quarterback Blake Decker yelling over his offensive line to the Wolfpack linebackers, \"Our law school is so much better than your medical school! Hut, hut.. hike.\"\nContact Chris Kudialis at ckudialis@reviewjournal.com or 702-380-4593. Find him on Twitter: @kudialisrj\nWho will win? UNLV gets chance to jump on...
