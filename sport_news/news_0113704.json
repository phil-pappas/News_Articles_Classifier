That was certainly the case as the Patriots all but gave the running game the day off (nine carries, four by quarterback Tom Brady).\n“We wanted to play fast to try and tire their defense down,” Amendola said. “We wanted to get in and out of plays fast, getting in and out of the huddle and going quickly, so that was our motive.”\nThe stats would seem to indicate that the Jets might have gotten fatigued in the final 15 minutes. Brady threw for 150 yards and two touchdowns in the fourth quarter alone, including an 8-yard heat-seeking missile to Amendola over the middle. Amendola was able to ward off a hit from free safety Marcus Gilchrist before bouncing into the end zone to put the Patriots up, 23-20.\n“It’s just a play we’ve been working on for a long time,” Amendola said. “They gave us the coverage that we liked and it ended up working out.”\nAs vital as Amendola’s touchdown was, his biggest contribution came on the final drive. He aggressively attacked a short Steve Weatherford punt at his own 21-yard line and returned it 11 yards to the 32 with 5:39 left. Usually, this is when receiver Julian Edelman comes to the forefront. But with Jets cornerback Darrelle Revis covering Edelman, Amendola became the go-to guy on the drive. He caught three passes for 31 yards, including a crucial 11-yarder on a third-and-10 from the Jets 33 to move the chains.\n“Danny made some great plays like he always does for us — big catches over the middle, big catch on the sideline,” coach Bill Belichick said. “He did a good job inside there like he always does, gave us field position in the return game as well.”\nTwo plays after the big third-down catch, Brady connected with tight end Rob Gronkowski on a 15-yard TD strike with 1:18 left to boost the lead to 30-20. The play loomed larger later when Nick Folk kicked a 55-yard field goal and the Jets recovered an onside kick with 18 seconds left.\n“They manned it up a lot on that last drive, specifically,” Amendola said of the Jets’ coverage. “We needed to score, had to score. (Gronkowski) made a great play right there at the end to get the ball in the end zone.”", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share?text=Danny+Amendola+shined+when+Patriots+needed+him+most", "http://www.adobe.com/go/getflashplayer", "http://static.eplayer.performgroup.com/flash/js/performgroup.js", "http://images.performgroup.com/namedImage/12637/install_flash.gif", "http://static.eplayer.performgroup.com/flash/js/swfobject.js"], "published": "2015-10-26T11:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T15:16:07.323+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
