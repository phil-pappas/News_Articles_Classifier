Dink here, dunk there -- a 7-yard out was stretching the field. \nThen Brees forgot all about that bum shoulder that cause him to miss last week’s game and remembered he’s a future NFL Hall of Famer. The Saints quarterback revived the organization with a thrilling (mostly the train-wreck type), much-needed victory against the Dallas Cowboys at the Mercedes-Benz Superdome. \nThe 26-20 triumph was punctuated by an 80-yard touchdown pass to (so far, little-used) running back C.J. Spiller on the second play of overtime – just moments after Brees’ masterful seven-play 68-yard drive at the end of regulation was rendered meaningless when Zach Hocker missed a potential 30-yard game-winning opportunity with 12 seconds remaining. \n“(After the miss), I did think maybe God intended No. 400 to be for the win,” Brees said. Saints offense finds spark in first win \nSpiller’s catch and run off a wheel route led to the 400th touchdown pass of Brees’ career and gave the Saints (1-3) their first victory of 2015. New Orleans also snapped a six-game losing streak inside this building. \n“Not being able to hit the field goal -- that can take the wind out of your sails,” Saints head coach Sean Payton said. “Tonight wasn’t perfect by any means, but we made enough plays.” \nFor perhaps a myriad of reasons (bad shoulder, shaky offensive line, covered receivers), Brees was unable to get the ball downfield against the Cowboys. However, No. 9 worked with what he had – leadership, guts and an impressive drive to win. \n“I just tried to keep the safety in the middle of the field and get CJ the ball and let him do the rest,” Brees said. \nMeanwhile, the Cowboys proved again life without Tony Romo and Dez Bryant simply isn’t easy. \nDallas’ Weeden did lead an eight-play, 91-yard game-tying drive late in the fourth quarter, but struggled to find big plays in a porous Saints secondary. \nTerrance Williams, who bailed the Cowboys out of regulation with an amazing diving catch in the end zone on fourth down with 1:51 left, was targeted 10 times by Weeden. He only caught three of those passes. \nWeeden finished 16 of 26 for 246 yards – including a 67-yard pass to Brice Butler -- and the TD. \nThe Cowboys and their fans had to be dreaming of what their superstars could have accomplished Sunday night, but that’s football. \nInstead, the evening transformed into a nightmare and things aren’t going to get easier. Saints defeat Cowboys in OT thriller \nSunday wasn’t a must-win game for the 2-2 Cowboys – it’s Week 4, so a little too early for that type of hyperbole. However, the NFC East is a mess. Washington and the New York Giants were victorious Sunday and Philadelphia dropped to 1-3. \nThe division is just bad enough to keep the depleted Cowboys in the hunt, but with high-powered New England, coming off a bye week, visiting the Metroplex on Sunday, and the Giants, Seattle and the Eagles after that, collecting wins against sub-par football teams is a must. And the Saints are just that. \nOf course, give Brees a chance to shut the door late and the Saints are anything but sub-par. \nBrees completed 33 of 41 passes for 359 yards and two touchdowns. He tried … really tried … to thrown an interception early, but three different attempts bounced off the hands or chests of Cowboys defenders. \nMaybe that Superdome magic is back. \nBrees hit nine different receivers Sunday. He completed one pass of more than 20 yards prior to the final drive in regulation. At one point he was on pace to need 50 completions to net 300 yards. But when the game was on the line, he came through in a big way. \nPhysically, this wasn’t the Brees this city has fallen in love with. But he grabbed another piece of the Big Easy on Sunday by being a winner. And that’s nothing new. \n“I felt good enough to get the job done,” Brees said. \nTwitter: @RoyLangIII 86 CONNECT 9 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://www.shreveporttimes.com/story/sports/nfl/cowboys/2015/10/05/brees-digs-deep-lifts-saints-victory/73363092/ TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T08:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T16:41:42.667+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
