He was taken to the hospital in serious condition.\nAuthorities notified swimmers and cleared Kailua, Lanikai, and Mokulua beaches.\nThis is the sixth shark attack in Hawaii this year and the second in as many weeks on Oahu. Earlier this month, a surfer lost most of his left leg after a shark attacked him off Oahu's north shore. One attack, which occurred in April on Maui, was fatal.\nAll shark attacks this year have happened in turbid or murky water.\nThere have been several consecutive days of rain on the windward side of Oahu, where the bite occurred.", "external_links": ["http://embed.newsinc.com/Single/iframe.html?WID=2&VID=29824589&freewheel=91223&sitesection=advance&height=349&width=620"], "published": "2015-10-18T08:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T12:16:19.696+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
