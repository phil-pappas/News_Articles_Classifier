He added a double and two singles and has hit safely in each of the Mets' nine postseason games.\nNew York, meanwhile, advanced to the World Series for the first time since a bitter Subway Series loss to the Yankees in 2000. This time, the Mets will face Kansas City or Toronto as they try to win their first championship since the amazin' bunch led by Dwight Gooden and Darryl Strawberry won it all in 1986.\nThat Mets' drought, of course, is nothing compared to that of the Cubs, who haven't won it all since 1908 and won't this year because of Murphy.\nSure, the Mets' aces pitched in. The Cubs' big bats failed to produce big results against starters Matt Harvey, Noah Syndergaard, Jacob deGrom and Steven Matz.\nBut Murphy's Babe Ruth impersonation has fueled the Mets - and this after he'd homered in back-to-back games just once in his six-year career. It's good timing, too, given his expiring contract.\nMurphy went 9 for 17 with four homers and six RBIs in the NLCS after going deep 14 times during the season. In nine playoff games, he has seven long balls and is 13 for 38 with eight RBIs.\nHe has also played sharp defense at second and made all the right moves on the bases.\nBut his work at the plate is what put the pennant in New York's hands.\nMurphy, a left-handed hitter who hit just one homer off a left-hander in the regular season, blasted one off Dodgers lefty Clayton Kershaw in Game 1 of the NL Division Series. Later in the series, he kicked his home-run binge into full gear, hitting a solo drive off Kershaw in Game 4, then homering off Zack Greinke in Game 5 to help New York to a decisive 3-2 victory.\nHe hit a solo homer off left-hander Jon Lester in Game 1 of the NLCS and a two-run drive off Jake Arrieta in Game 2. And when Murphy connected off Kyle Hendricks in Game 3 on Tuesday, that gave him homers in five straight playoff games, tying the mark set by Houston's Carlos Beltran in 2004.\nAnd then came the latest shot, a victory lap Murphy celebrated with his right fist aloft, trotting a familiar path as these up-and-coming Mets head into unfamiliar territory.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
