Lamar Odom remains on life support at a Las Vegas hospital, and it does not sound like his condition is improving.\nAdChoices The latest report from TMZ claims Odom’s condition has “deteriorated” since Wednesday. Doctors say the longer Odom remains in his current state, the less likely it is that he will recover.\nSources tell TMZ, Lamar did indeed squeeze Khloe (Kardashian’s) hand Wednesday night, which gave everyone hope, but Thursday morning doctors are saying it well could have been an involuntary movement.\nAs of Thursday morning, our sources say Lamar has shown no signs of consciousness or improvement. We’re told 4 organs, including his kidneys, continue to fail. Our sources say doctors have been clear … the fact that Lamar is not getting better significantly reduces his chances of survival.\nRev. Jesse Jackson visited Odom Wednesday and said doctors were encouraged by the signs of improvement Odom was showing . However, Jackson was quick to point out that Odom’s condition should still be considered “critical” and that he is not breathing on his own.\nA 911 call that has been released indicates Odom was doing cocaine while at a brothel in Nevada and using sexual enhancement pills in excess. A previous report claimed Odom had “ virtually every drug imaginable ” in his system and that he has likely suffered brain damage. There has been speculation that an episode of the Kardashians’ reality show may have pushed Odom over the edge .\nHopefully Odom takes a turn for the better, but his current situation sounds grave.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.yardbarker.com/", "http://larrybrownsports.com/basketball/lamar-odom-911-call-cocaine/278042", "http://larrybrownsports.com/basketball/lamar-odom-much-better-off-day-after-hospitalized/277896", "http://larrybrownsports.com/basketball/lamar-odom-overdosed-on-drugs/277893", "http://larrybrownsports.com/basketball/lamar-odom-off-rails-keeping-up-kardashians/277882", "https://w.graphiq.com/w/lcqvzKlU0cJ", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "http://www.tmz.com/2015/10/15/lamar-odom-condition-worsens-unconscious/#ixzz3oevoYdNJ"], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T03:45:45.311+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
