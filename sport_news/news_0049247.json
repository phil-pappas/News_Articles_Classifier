(AP) — Indiana lifted starting defensive lineman Darius Latham's suspension Friday, making him eligible to play Saturday at Penn State.\nLatham was suspended indefinitely last week as he waited for a resolution in a case before the school's student ethics office. That forced Latham to miss the Hoosiers' 34-27 loss to Ohio State, a game in which Ezekiel Elliott ran for a career high 274 yards and scored on runs of 55, 65 and 75 yards.\nThe statement issued Friday by Indiana (4-1, 0-1 Big Ten) did not say how the case was resolved — only that Latham traveled with the team and there would be no additional comments.\nLatham is tied for the team lead in sacks with two and tackles for loss with five despite missing two games.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
