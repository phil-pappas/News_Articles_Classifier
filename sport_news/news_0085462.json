Perhaps it was one of Michal Neuvirth’s 31 saves. Perhaps it was a little chip-out to keep the puck from being in the defensive zone. \nWhatever it was, it taught the Flyers that they’re capable of playing in close games late in the contest. \nLast season they were 16-10-18 in that scenario. So far this year, they are 2-0-1. \n“Everybody has to buy into the system and everybody has to do his job out there,” alternate captain Mark Streit said. “You’ve got to be able to execute and trust each other and the accountability, it’s got to be there for 60 mintues. Yeah, there’s gonna be breakdowns, there’s gonna be mistakes, but for the most time we’ve got to stay within the system, especially if you face teams like Chicago or Dallas on Tuesday. It makes everything so much easier if you’re out there as a unit instead of trying something on your own.” \nSo in the Flyers’ last two games, both wins, has it been hockey instinct or coach Dave Hakstol’s new system that has gotten them through it? \n“I think the guys are starting to get it,” alternate captain Wayne Simmonds said. “I think you’re starting to see our neutral zone has been really good for us. We’re stopping plays up and getting opportunities going the other way. We’re playing a pretty simple game. We’re getting pucks deep and we’re not turning it over in the neutral zone. That’s key. That’s huge. That’s where we ran into a lot of problems last year.” \nThe fact that the Flyers are playing well in that scenario this year is a confidence booster so far. Simmonds said on numerous occasions that last year the Flyers “found a way to lose” those games instead of win them. So far in the early season, they’re playing like they know they’re going to win. \n“I think it’s a building process,” Hakstol said. “We made some mistakes in the last 10-15 minutes of the 1-0 win against Florida but we also continued to play the right way. We got a save or two. We had a couple guys make second-effort type plays that allowed us to win that game 1-0. I think our group grew in confidence a little bit out of that. Same thing against Chicago. I think we just continued to play the right way. Little things have a way of building and growing.” Early standings look good \nEach of the Flyers’ last few coaches have been different in their viewpoint on players keeping a keen eye on the standings. Craig Berube preferred not to pay attention to it, likely in part because the Flyers had been so bad to start the season. His predecessor, Peter Laviolette, liked to break the season up into five-game segments and re-assess after that. \nNow that the Flyers have had a stronger-than-normal start, Hakstol is all about his players looking at where they stand. \n“I like reality,” Hakstol said. “You deal with reality. The standings, that’s a part of our reality on a daily basis. I don’t care if it’s Week 1 or it’s in the final week of the season. Every night you’re playing for something. It’s no different for any team throughout the league. Standings are a part of our life on a daily basis. You’ve got to know where you’re at to know maybe where you’ve come from and where you’re going.” \nThe Flyers are all too familiar with the feeling their division opponents, the winless Columbus Blue Jackets are having at 0-6-0. \n“It is still early and it’s only been a handful of games for teams,” defenseman Nick Schultz said, “but you start like that and you’re already behind and trying to climb back by like six, eight points a couple weeks into the season. It’s not a good feeling. You see a team like Montreal (the Canadiens’ 6-0-0 record is the best start in franchise history) and it’s the other side. (Columbus) is already behind by 12 points. It’s tough.” Loose pucks \nR.J. Umberger was a full participant in practice Sunday. With “nothing holding me back at all,” he is hoping to play Tuesday against Dallas. … Hakstol said it’s still too early to pick a starting goalie against the Stars, but expect Steve Mason to get the nod. He is 5-5-1 in 13 career games with a 2.69 goals-against average and .910 save percentage against Dallas. … Matt Read took line rushes Sunday on his old line with Sean Couturier and Simmonds. \nDave Isaac; (856) 486-2479; disaac@gannettnj.com .
