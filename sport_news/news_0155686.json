It arrived in an email from my boss at 11 a.m. \nIt detailed how our staff was going to cover the shocking and tragic news of the death of Evan Murray. \nThe Warren Hills star quarterback and three-sport athlete had died just hours earlier from a football-related injury suffered Friday night. It was later revealed his death was due to massive internal bleeding caused by a lacerated spleen.\nI was in Ohio at the time. It was just hours before kickoff for Bergen Catholic's game against St. Edward.\nThere I was about to cover a much-anticipated showdown featuring two nationally ranked teams. But the upcoming game, in that moment, felt so small, so futile.\nThe news of Murray’s death put things in perspective. Murray died playing a game he loved. At 17 years old. His whole life still ahead of him.\nI didn’t know Murray. Never met him, never saw him play. But he had passed far too soon. By all accounts, he was well-liked by everyone. He had an incredibly bright future.\nIn a period in time when concussions and player safety dominate football news cycles, Murray's death was another devastating reminder of how dangerous a game so many – myself included – have grown to love truly is.\nTonight, St. Joseph will take its crack at IMG Academy. Two of North Jersey’s best public schools – Wayne Hills and Pascack Valley – also will meet. \nAnd one of North Jersey’s most heated rivalries – Paramus Catholic at Bergen Catholic – is slated for Saturday.\nAll great games. All highly anticipated. All ones we can, and should, watch and enjoy. \nWarren Hills also will return to action Saturday against Voorhees. Some Blue Streaks players have told media outlets that's what Murray would have wanted.\nBut, as games resume this week, let's consider the bigger picture. These are still just kids playing football. \nMaybe going forward, we should be a little more wary of overly cheering those big hits – ones similar to the hits that reportedly cost Murray his life.\nRegarding players’ health and safety, hopefully coaches nationwide continue erring on the side of caution, maybe now more than ever. \nNo one was to blame for Murray’s death, officially ruled an accident. It was a tragic consequence of a physical sport. Hopefully, though, we don't have to experience another tragedy like this any time soon.\nBack in Ohio on Saturday night, Bergen Catholic had just lost to St. Edward. But, at that point, social media was providing constant reminders of how one exceptional young man had lost his life. \nPerspective. Don't take life for granted. Enjoy the games. Play hard. Cheer loud. But win or lose, remember ... it’s still just a game.\nMy condolences go out to the Murray family and the entire Warren Hills community.\nRest in peace, No. 18.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T04:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T10:32:45.622+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
