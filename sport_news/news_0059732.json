He and Jaye smiled as they took a selfie.\nPoint. Click. History.\nIn the background of Maddon's photo likely were champagne-soaked Cubs players celebrating a seismic 6-4 victory over the Cardinals with their families and each other. Cubs President Theo Epstein danced, albeit awkwardly, in public. A relieved-looking Chairman Tom Ricketts waved a white \"W\" towel. Kris Bryant hugged every stranger and posed for every picture. Closer Hector Rondon emerged from the clubhouse wearing goggles, Dexter Fowler with a bottle of beer in his back pocket as the biggest North Side party in years spilled onto the infield.\n\"Isn't this wonderful?'' Maddon asked his wife. \"I'll be right back.''\nMaddon, the man as responsible as anybody for the Cubs winning the National League Division Series, ducked away to fulfill his postgame media duties. On the way, Maddon got a pat on the back from actor John Cusack and gave a thumbs-up as the chants grew louder. Ducking into the visiting dugout and going down one of the ballpark's dank hallways, Maddon ran into Cardinals manager Mike Matheny. As the managers of the Cubs and Cardinals graciously shook hands before heading in opposite directions, the symbolism was hard to ignore.\n\"They're the standard-bearer so for us to be able to beat them tonight really is important to us as a franchise and organization,'' Maddon said. \"Everybody knows I grew up a fan of that group as a kid, so I just want to say, for us, believe me, it's special to be able to beat a team of that magnitude.''\nBehold the Chicago Cubs, NLDS winners — and suddenly World Series favorites.\nIt feels funny to read the last part of that sentence, but no more serious contender exists in the playoffs. No team still alive in either league posted a better regular-season record. Nobody will enter either League Championship Series with any more postseason momentum than the Cubs.\nIn a year the Cubs did something no Chicago baseball team had done since 1906 — clinch a postseason series at home — nothing seems impossible now, not even ending a 106-year championship drought that hasn't affected this team one iota. The youth and talent of these Cubs makes them curse-proof, immune to the quirks and idiosyncrasies that have befallen so many of their predecessors.\nMaddon makes his players live too much in the moment to be paralyzed by the franchise's tortured past. Nobody on a Cubs team with a core made up of players 26 or younger cares about Bartman, a billy goat or 1969. These aren't lovable losers as much as one of the most likable winning teams our city has seen in awhile. They haven't won anything yet, as Ricketts reminded everyone, but four months after the Blackhawks won the Stanley Cup, the Cubs have put themselves in prime position to make Chicago Title Town, 2015.\n\"I remember getting here and some people telling me this organization was maybe 30-40 years behind technology-wise, and the things Theo (Epstein) and Jed (Hoyer) did, and it starts with Mr. Ricketts, to turn this organization around, it's really nice for them,'' Anthony Rizzo said. \"Obviously, times weren't easy the last few years, but with all the talent we have, everyone knew the Cubs were coming.''\nThey officially arrived at 6:54 p.m. when Rondon struck out Cardinals rookie Stephen Piscotty to bring the Cubs within four victories of the World Series.\nThis is what happens when an organization hires the best people available, most notably Epstein and Maddon, and lets them do their jobs. This is what happens when potential catches up with production faster than anybody imagined. Much like the Bulls finally getting past the Pistons so their dynasty could start and the Hawks overcoming the Red Wings before they could win the Stanley Cup, the Cubs surpassing the Cardinals feels like the start of something special.\nThe Maddon Way — taking no batting practice, hitting the pitcher eighth and worrying about the process more than the outcome — trumped the Cardinal Way. It was only fitting that Rizzo, who boldly predicted in January that the Cubs would win the division, hit the sixth-inning home run off Kevin Siegrist that ultimately sent the NL Central champions home until spring training. That's not only how you back up big talk, that's how you build a legacy.\n\"I don't know how I got him,'' Rizzo said.\nBy the time Kyle Schwarber's blast an inning later hit the Budweiser sign in right field and looked likely to land somewhere near Lake Michigan, a party atmosphere replaced any remaining pensiveness at Wrigley.\n\"That's what you live to play baseball for,'' Schwarber said of the way the crowd of 42,411 reacted to his homer.\nNobody in the ballpark experienced any deeper emotions than Javier Baez, the shortstop pressed into duty when starter Addison Russell injured his hamstring. The way this Cubs season has gone, with a different unlikely hero every night, you just knew Baez was bound to have a big game. Almost on cue, Baez drilled an opposite-field, three-run go-ahead homer in the second inning that created a roar throughout Wrigleyville. His trip around the bases was as jubilant as his year has been turbulent.\nBaez was the first of the ballyhooed Cubs prospects to debut — he started 52 games in 2014 — but perhaps the slowest to develop. Shortly after the Cubs sent Baez to Iowa in April, the 22-year-old took a two-week bereavement leave to mourn the death of his sister, Noely, who died from issues related to spina bifida. Then in early June just as Baez began to hit his stride, he suffered a hand injury that knocked him out another seven weeks. For a young man who lost his father at 11, Baez developed a mental toughness that helps him persevere through difficult times.\nSo when Maddon stuck with his shortstop one night after he committed an error, Baez considered it more welcome than worrisome, a chance to turn adversity into opportunity.\n\"I talked to him before the game and I asked him to own the game like you do,'' Maddon said.\nBesides Baez, Maddon raved about a bullpen that used seven relievers after starter Jason Hammel left in the fourth — three of whom were discarded by other teams during the season. Was Justin Grimm striking out the side more clutch than Clayton Richard fanning Jason Heyward in the seventh with a runner aboard?\n\"Grimm set the tone but, up and down, they were all wonderful,'' Maddon said.\nTrevor Cahill perhaps was the most grateful reliever after Jorge Soler unveiled his cannon in the sixth. Soler made history at the plate in this series but provided the biggest highlight in the field by throwing out Cardinals catcher Tony Cruz at the plate trying to score on a sixth-inning RBI single off Cahill. Among the highlights from a historic game, that ranked near the top. But it's a long list.\n\"Nobody here today will forget they were here today,'' Ricketts said. \"That was pretty amazing.''\nAnd it felt like only the beginning.\ndhaugh@tribpub.com\nTwitter @DavidHaugh\nPrivacy Policy Major League Baseball Baseball Chicago Cubs Joe Maddon St. Louis Cardinals Tom Ricketts Hector Rondon", "external_links": ["http://www.tribpub.com/privacy-policy-and-your-privacy-rights/", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-561dced4/turbine/ct-cubs-haugh-spt-1014-20151013"], "published": "2015-10-14T06:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T14:29:20.500+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
