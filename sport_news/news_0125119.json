Meanwhile, he scored a 32 on his third attempt at the ACT. \nLet’s place his achievement in perspective: One out of 72 seniors (Class of 2014) participating in an ACT survey scored a 32, according to a report. \nSo pick a college, Cole. Any college. Academically, his options are as massive as his growing frame. \n“I didn’t expect a 32,” Garrison said of his ACT achievement. “(But) I figured I would do pretty well. I’m used to doing pretty well on stuff like that. Yeah, but I was somewhat surprised.” \nRELATED: ALABAMA ANNOUNCES ALL-STAR ROSTER FOR ANNUAL GAME AGAINST MISSISSIPPI \nGarrison ranks in the top five of his senior class at Clay-Chalkville. His favorite subject is science. He said his father, Kevin, has always pushed him to work hard at academics. If Cole excelled at something, Kevin made sure he continued to work hard at it. \nHe's just as relentless on the football field. No wonder he was named this week to the roster for the Alabama-Mississippi All-Star Classic. No wonder Cougars quarterback Ty Pigrome , receiver T.J. Simmons and others have helped their offense outscore opponents 342-93. Football now, medical school later \nIn college, Garrison wants to study anatomy. He’s interested in learning how the body works. After football, he wants to become an orthopedic surgeon. \nMedical school is in his future, so he’s primarily interested in undergrad programs that would allow him to transition to the college’s medical school after football. \nBecause of the Academic Progress Rate, which tracks the academic success and graduation rates of student athletes, colleges are paying more attention to their student-athletes in the classroom and study hall. In fact, most football programs have mandatory study hall sessions, with tutors available. That’s why Garrison said he feels comfortable balancing a challenging major and college football. \nGarrison said he’s aware that some college football programs prefer players focus on less-daunting majors. \n“I think if that time is utilized wisely, it wouldn’t be difficult,” he said. Garrison paused, changing his answer to, “Not impossible. Obviously, it will be difficult, even if you weren’t an athlete.” Bigger, stronger on the football field \nOn the football field, Garrison said he’s improved this season at moving his feet and playing with aggression – exploding off the line at the snap, staying low, utilizing his increased strength. \n“It’s a lot about effort,” he said. “Not that I wasn’t giving effort, but I’ve got more to give now. I’m making sure I finish plays really hard. And start plays hard.” \nClay-Chalkville’s offensive line is comprised of four seniors and one junior. \nGarrison’s football work ethic makes him an overachiever in the weight room, on the practice field. This season marks his first as a starter. He’s now played every position on the offensive line except center. \n“I knew he could play,” said Obed Ellis, offensive line coach at Clay-Chalkville. “He just had to get some experience. He’s done everything we’ve asked him to do, and more.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T22:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T00:24:53.609+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
