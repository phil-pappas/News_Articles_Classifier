At night, towering shelves of whiskey emit a warm copper glow over the 50-foot-long bar, tufted booths and a vintage phone booth where you can order Champagne. On a coaster, Smokey the Bear, retiring his namesake hat for a Paydirt one, advises \"only you can prevent Fireball.\" Like its sister bar, Paydirt is heavy on the whiskey (and whisky), with more than 100 different bottles, any of which can be turned into a pickleback with a $1 shot of Picklopolis brine. Cocktails, though often a smidge too sweet, range from brown, bitter and stirred to spicy tequila refreshers and junior Ramos Gin Fizzes. Beer buffs will feel at home, too, with 12 taps pouring everything from Rainier to Union Jack IPA. There's even a line dedicated to the Fernet Branca lover in your life.\nOrder this: Whisk(e)y\n2724 N.E.
