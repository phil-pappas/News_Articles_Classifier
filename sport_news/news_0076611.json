Seattle coach Pete Carroll said it would be done as soon as possible, although the move was not listed on the league’s official transactions report Monday. Once the suspension is lifted, Coleman could play Thursday night against San Francisco, but Carroll said the fullback has yet to be examined by team doctors following his involvement in the crash. “We did see him. We’ve also seen the videotapes of his meetings with the police, and so we feel like we are doing the right thing right now, obviously,” Carroll said. Coleman was suspended Thursday after his arrest for investigation of vehicular assault and hit-and-run. Police officers in the Seattle suburb of Bellevue said they arrested him because he left the scene of the two-car accident. Coleman was released from jail on Friday and King County prosecutors said they would wait until an investigation is complete before deciding whether to file criminal charges. Carroll said Coleman would have to be cleared by team doctors before the team even considers playing him against the 49ers.
