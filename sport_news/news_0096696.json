Officially, Hutcherson’s last score came in the third round of the 2012 Alabama high school playoffs. \n“They said I pushed off, I don’t think I pushed off, so me personally, I still count that as a touchdown,” Hutcherson said. \nThere’s little to debate on Hutcherson’s first touchdown as a Bulldog. The senior caught a 13-yard pass from Dak Prescott to push MSU’s lead to 35-16. It was his second catch of the drive and third overall in the game. \n“It felt good,” Hutcherson said. “I felt good and bad at the same time because all coach was preaching was don’t win the play, dominate the play and I barely got in.” \nDue to his size, many immediately compared the tight end to NFL all-pros Jimmy Graham and Rob Gronkowski when Hutcherson arrived on campus last year. \nDrops have plagued the Dadeville, Alabama native in his two years at Mississippi State. \nHutcherson didn’t catch a pass last season. He had two for nine yards in MSU’s first six games this year. \nHe has six receptions for 81 yards in his last two games. \n“It’s a matter of me getting my opportunities,” Hutcherson said. “Me just stepping up, filling the tight end role with Gus (Walley) being down.” \nWalley has missed the majority of the last four games with various injuries. Walley was MSU’s third-leading receiver through four games. \nHutcherson has started in Walley’s absence the last two games. The mental aspect of his game has finally caught up to his physical prowess. \n“Hutch got thrown into a bad situation last year,” MSU coach Dan Mullen said. “He’s probably a kid we would have loved to have redshirted last year. He got thrown in and had to go play some. I think you see him really starting to develop.” \nThere’s no timetable on when Walley could return. True freshman Justin Johnson caught two passes in his first collegiate drive, including a touchdown against Southern Miss. He’s only caught three since. \nHutcherson began the season as the third-string tight end. As Mississippi State, which checked in at No. 25 in the AP Top 25 on Sunday, heads into a bye week before closing out the season with four Southeastern Conference games, Hutcherson has emerged as a primary target. \n“We’ve pretty much got everything down,” Hutcherson said. “It’s just mental strain. That’s all it is. Mental strain and concentration.” \nContact Michael Bonner at mbonner@jackson.gannett.com.
