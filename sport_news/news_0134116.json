Last week’s foe, Purdue, was unanimously picked for last in the Big 10 West and started a freshman QB. Maryland was picked by some for last in the Big 10 East. UB is coming off a 24-21 home loss to Nevada.\nTrending: UB’s hope is to get some timely stops on defense and roll up at least 30 points on offense. Bowling Green’s defensive back seven is suspect. The best cornerback, senior Darrell Hunter, is out with an injury. The Falcons’ front four is good, especially DT Zach Colvin (No. 92) and DE Taylor Royster (33). Last year, Anthone Taylor rushed for 219 on the Falcons and Joe Licata passed for 134. UB needs a lot more than that from Licata this time.\nStat check: The forecast calls for 52 degrees, a scattered shower and 20 mph winds. Anything that might hinder BG’s offense is good for UB. One caveat: BG’s offense goes so fast, it usually gets more possessions with the wind than its opponent.\nStar gazing: QB Matt Johnson (No. 11) is the triggerman of the BG attack. He’s a sensational passer and he’s dangerous running the ball. The big threats to watch are: WR Roger Lewis (1), RB Travis Greene (8), WR Ronnie Moore (5), WR Gehrig Dieter (4) and WR Ryan Burbrink (17). UB’s offensive weapons are good, but Bowling Green’s skill players clearly are superior. Lewis has 30 catches for 559 yards and five TDs. Moore torched UB for 178 receiving yards last year. Bowling Green has more team speed than UB.\nAt stake: BG has won 12 straight MAC East games and is the strong favorite to win a third straight division title. UB’s seniors don’t want to go winless for their careers against the Falcons. But a loss here doesn’t really ruin UB’s hopes for a winning season.\nPrediction: Bowling Green 31, UB 25.\n-- Mark Gaughan", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T02:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T04:45:41.593+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
