(AP) - Justin Ellis is the first one to admit his absence along the Oakland Raiders’ defensive line the past two weeks has been hardly noticeable. \nThat’s because the Raiders’ run defense has gotten progressively better since Ellis went out with an ankle injury early in the team’s season-opening loss to Cincinnati. \n“Those guys have been playing good,” Ellis said Friday. “Stacy McGee, he’s been playing well, just as good as I could do it. Most of the (backups) on this line can do it just as much as the first string and sometimes better.” \nNot that Ellis is considered a weak link. \nIf anything, the player commonly referred to as Jelly by his coaches and teammates is one of the best run defenders on Oakland’s roster. \nEllis returned to practice this week and is expected to be back in the starting lineup when the Raiders play the Bears in Chicago on Sunday. \nThe timing couldn’t be better for Oakland’s defense. \nLinebacker Khalil Mack has been nursing a sore hip while defensive end Justin Tuck is dealing with a sore knee. Both are listed as probable. \nSafety Charles Woodson is questionable with a sore shoulder, while defensive lineman C.J. Wilson has a calf injury and has already been ruled out. \n“It’s always good to get people back,” coach Jack Del Rio said. “It’s always good to have people healthy.” \nOakland heads into the Chicago game with the 13th-ranked run defense, giving up 275 yards on the ground in the first three games. Almost half of that (127) came in the Week 1 loss to the Bengals when the Raiders got down early then fell apart defensively. \nEllis, a fourth-round pick in 2014 who started 14 games as a rookie, was injured on the seventh play of the game when his foot got stuck in the ground during a goal-line play. A pile of players rolled up on his ankle, and Ellis initially thought his season might be over before it really began. \n“I know it comes with the game but sometimes it throws you off a little bit,” Ellis said “It makes you discouraged a little bit because you worked so hard during the offseason and then, bam, it’s gone just like that.” \nHe’s back and fully healthy to rejoin a defense that has given up just 83 yards in its last six quarters. \nEllis credits McGee and Wilson for holding down the fort in his absence.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T00:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T01:17:19.414+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
