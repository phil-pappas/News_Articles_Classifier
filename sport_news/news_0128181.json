The Bears ended the NFL's longest active losing streak (eight games) and avoided their first 0-4 start since 2000.\nMore importantly, they earned a victory to show for their effort in the nascent stages of Fox and general manager Ryan Pace's program.\n\"It's a lot more gratifying when you win,\" Fox said after emerging from the locker room. \"I was really, really happy to see smiles in there.\"\nPhotos from Sunday's Bears-Raiders game at Soldier Field.\nCutler painted them on his teammates' faces with plenty of help on the final drive. Pass protection was the key, he said.\nHe hit 5 of 8 passes for 41 yards, with completions to four players. And the patchwork offensive line did its part against a Raiders pass rush with Pro Bowl credentials.\n\"We thought they were going to run a lot of games â€” and they did,\" said Matt Slauson, who switched from left guard to center on the fourth play of the game because Will Montgomery broke his left fibula.\n\"I know Jay was just ballin'. Our wideouts did a great job making plays. They showed up in a big way. Jay put the ball on them. As a line, we're just trying to not screw it up.\"\nTrailing 20-19 with two timeouts and 2:05 left in the fourth quarter, the Bears gained possession at their 20-yard line. Following a second-down sack on which Cutler went down to preserve his hamstring, they faced fourth-and-5.\nCutler averted defeat by squeezing a pass to tight end Martellus Bennett near the left sideline. Bennett was closely covered by linebacker Ray-Ray Armstrong, but the throw was pinpoint perfect.\n\"I always want to be the guy who's in position to make a play in that clutch moment,\" Bennett said. \"That's what tight ends do.\"\nThen third-year receiver Marquess Wilson took the stage. He dropped a first-down pass near the left sideline. But he responded with a 6-yard catch that converted third-and-3 and a 9-yarder that put the Bears in Gould's range.\n\"Jay's always talking to Q, and we always talk to Q, like, 'Hey, you need to learn how to let those plays go,'\" Bennett said. \"Today, he grew up right in front of our eyes, and he was able to put that behind him and make the next play.\"\nWilson's two catches were among the three on which Bears receivers got out of bounds to stop the clock on the final drive.\nRunning back Matt Forte said the Raiders were buzzing linebackers to the flat to try to protect the sideline. Cutler, meanwhile said their maligned secondary was playing conservative coverage.\n\"It looked that way because it was evident,\" Raiders two-time Pro Bowl defensive end Justin Tuck said. \"They did a good job of managing the clock there.\"\nForte carried the ball to center it at the Raiders' 32-yard line, and the Bears ran the clock down to seven seconds. Gould then met the game's decisive moment with confidence, breaking a dam that had restrained the joy of victory for 11 months.\n\"Hopefully we can build on this,\" Fox said. \"And I think we will.\"\nrcampbell@tribpub.com\nTwitter @Rich_Campbell\n Chicago Bears Jay Cutler Oakland Raiders John Fox Robbie Gould Martellus Bennett NFL Pro Bowl", "external_links": ["http://www.tribpub.com/privacy-policy-and-your-privacy-rights/", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-5612c31c/turbine/ct-week-4-photos-bears-vs-raiders-20151004", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-56127ce8/turbine/ct-super-sider-bears-raiders-spt-1005-20151004", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-56118e8e/turbine/chi-ct-bears-raiders42-ct0031497666-20151004", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-5612a969/turbine/chi-ct-ct-spt-1005-bears-raiders-29-ct0031498089-20151004"], "published": "2015-10-05T05:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T01:52:51.243+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
