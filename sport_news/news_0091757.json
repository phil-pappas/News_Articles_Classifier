This year's playoff run, which began with a bang in Pittsburgh, ended with a whimper at Wrigley Field Wednesday night as the New York Mets swept the Cubs out of the National League championship series with an 8-3 victory. The four-game sweep ended a postseason run that saw the Cubs beat the Pirates in an emotionally charged wild-card game before they defeated their Gateway Arch rivals, the St. Louis Cardinals, three games to one in the division series. The Cubs barely gave themselves a chance Tuesday night, even as a crowd of 42,227 exhorted them on. But the Mets took the starch out of the crowd by jumping on Cubs starting pitcher Jason Hammel with 4 runs in the first inning, when Hammel threw 38 pitches. Lucas Duda hit a 3 run homer off Hammel, who lasted just 1â…“ innings. Duda brought 2 more home with a double in the second. The Cubs came into this series flying high after knocking out the teams with the two best records in baseball. But they were shut down by a good Mets pitching staff. Before this season started, most fans would have accepted any kind of winning record from the Cubs, who finished last year 73-89. At the end of last season, first baseman Anthony Rizzo stated the team's goal to win the NL Central, a theme he sounded repeatedly over the winter. Manager Joe Maddon, who fell into the Cubs' laps last fall after he opted out of his contract with the Tampa Bay Rays, talked playoffs from the get-go. Before Wednesday's game, Maddon said this year's playoff experience will benefit the Cubs next year and beyond because their young players now know what's expected of them in the postseason. Barring injury, a young and talented Cubs team should be in position to contend for the next several years. \"It benefits the whole organization,\" Maddon said. \"It validates the scouting and development. It validates what we did in spring training this year just to get to this point to win over 100 games this year. \"Come on. Everything said and done, we've won over 100 baseball games this year during a regular season and postseason. That's not easy to do. I think everything that's occurred this year validates all that's been put in place prior to this year.\" As far as the NLCS goes, the Cubs were set up for success in the beginning, but they couldn't press their advantage of having their top pitchers ready while the Mets were forced to the limit by the Dodgers in their division series. Cubs starters Jon Lester and Jake Arrieta dropped decisions to Matt Harvey and Noah Syndergaard, respectively, in the first two games at New York. Kyle Hendricks started for the Cubs in Game 3 and lasted 4 innings in a 5-2 defeat at Wrigley Field. Maddon was pressed several times on whether he'd come back with Lester on short rest for Game 4, and each time he said no. Instead, he stuck with Hammel, who had only 2 quality starts since the all-star break. In the division-series clincher, he lasted 3 innings. Hammel became upset with Maddon more than once when Maddon removed him from games early, but the manager continued talking up his pitcher, even into Wednesday. \"First half all-star caliber almost,\" Maddon said. \"He really got off well. I was touting him for the all-star team in the beginning of the season. Very impressive stuff and command. Then he got hurt. He injured his leg. \"Coming back from that has not nearly been the same, primarily talking about command. If you look at the numbers on the gun, reading his fastball velocity, slider velocity whatever, they've been pretty much the same. It's just a matter of throwing it where he wants to.\" The Mets took a 6-1 lead into the top of the eighth inning. Cubs reliever Fernando Rodney struck out the first two batters he faced before waling David Wright. Daniel Murphy came up and blasted a 2-run homer to center field for his seventh postseason home run. He has homered in a major-league-record sixth straight postseason games. Kris Bryant brought the crowd back to some life in the bottom of the inning with a 2-run homer, a high drive to the bleachers in left-center.
