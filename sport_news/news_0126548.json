Last off-season, they were not in the running to retain right-hander Max Scherzer’s services before he signed a seven-year, $210 million deal with the Nationals. \nThis season, they traded Price, who is expected to get a contract close to Scherzer’s, and former president and general manager Dave Dombrowski said at the time that contract extension talks with Price’s camp had never progressed to a serious point because of the difference in dollars. \nAbout the team’s payroll, which was around $175 million in 2015, Avila said that in talking with longtime team owner Mike Ilitch, the Tigers would field a team with a “very highly competitive payroll, like we always have.” Addressing the off-season in our Talkin' Tigers podcast \nHe wouldn’t elaborate on whether the payroll for the upcoming season would be higher or lower, but said a payroll in the $189-200 million range was “ridiculous.” \nBut the starting rotation only represents one half of the team’s porous pitching in 2015 – the Tigers finished last in the American League with a 4.64 ERA – and said another priority would be adding at least a couple of bullpen arms and specifically, a closer. \n“The bullpen needs to be addressed,” Avila said. “That’s going to be a key.” \nHe classified the team’s search for a closer as a “tough task,” citing the lack of options on the free agent market – former Tiger Joakim Soria, also traded this season, is the only proven choice – and wouldn’t rule out acquiring an arm via trade or approaching pitchers that lack a lengthy track record. \n“These are areas we’re going to be experimenting and exploring with the use of analytics and scouts,” he said. “Can we come up with a couple names that have the potential to be closers? That’s really one area where it’s going to be very important because sitting here today, I don’t know that there’s an absolute closer right there that we’re locked in on. So we really have to explore every avenue.” \nAvila touched on a couple of internal options, saying he hoped right-handed reliever Bruce Rondon, who was dismissed from the team for “effort level” reasons late in the season, has learned his lesson. \n“I’m keeping my fingers crossed that the lesson is learned, and he comes back ready to go,” Avila said. \nHe threw arbitration-eligible right-hander Neftali Feliz into the mix but with a $4.12 million contract last season, his return seems unlikely. \nAvila said the team’s off-season talks have already started; externally with a couple of teams to gauge the trade market and internally about a contract extension for rightfielder J.D. Martinez. He characterized a split with son Alex Avila as “probable,” saying he felt the longtime Tigers’ catcher would find a better suitor on the free agent market, and sent this message to the rest of the league: \n“We’re open for business in the sense that if anything makes sense for us in a trade, we would do it,” he said. “It’s not like everybody is set in stone.” \nBut what is set in stone is the team’s plans to pursue a pitching upgrade. \nWhere they will find the pitching – on the free agent market or through a trade – and how much they will have to spend to get it remains unknown. \n“That would probably help us,” he said. \nIt is the obvious answer. \nContact Anthony Fenech: afenech@freepress.com.
