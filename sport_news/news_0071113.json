Accompanying Domi will be a 48-foot double-expandable trailer, filled with memorabilia and other interactive assets from Domi's long career. Sponsored by Mitchell Goldhar , founder of SmartCentres and a hockey enthusiast, the travelling interactive museum provides the ultimate fan experience, allowing hockey lovers to meet their hero, get a signed copy of his book, and explore never-before-seen facets of Domi's life.\n\"Tie is one of the most beloved hockey players of all time so this book and his fans deserve an exciting and innovative book tour to celebrate this milestone in his career,\" says Kevin Hanson , President and Publisher of Simon & Schuster Canada .\n\"Tie is a special person who was a dedicated teammate wherever he played,\" says Mitchell Goldhar . \"He has had an extremely successful transition from sports to business and we believe Canadians will relate to his story of perseverance, loyalty, and hard work. Canadians are not just hockey fans; we are fans of true Canadian-style success stories like Tie's.\"\nIn Shift Work , Domi recounts the ups and downs of his life on and off the ice, sharing with remarkable honesty his successes and mistakes. Raised by immigrant parents in Belle River, Ontario , Domi was a talented athlete in whatever sport he played, eventually focusing his sights on hockey. In his time with the Toronto Maple Leafs, the New York Rangers, and the Winnipeg Jets, Domi made a name for himself as a player who was always ready to take on anyone who dared to cross his teammates. An intensely human story, Shift Work shows Tie Domi as he is-a man driven to be the best at his job, a devoted father and friend, a valued and loyal team player, a magnetic personality, and an athlete of immense skill and courage.\nDon Cherry has lauded the book, calling it a winner that will appeal to all Canadians, not just hockey fans. Domi's former teammates are also championing Shift Work, including Mats Sundin , who said, \"Without Tie Domi at my side, I couldn't have accomplished what I did in Toronto .\"\nFor a list of tour stops and details please visit tiedomi.com, Twitter @thereal_tiedomi, and Facebook/TieDomi.\nSmartCentres are located in neighbourhoods right across Canada.
