He set up Shu Kurata with 20 minutes left but the midfielder's shot was blocked by Guangzhou goalkeeper Zeng Cheng. \nUsami then sent an effort just beyond the far post from the edge of the area as the contest entered the closing stages. \nThe Japan striker threatened again with six minutes remaining with another effort just wide. \nGuangzhou will travel to Dubai on Nov. 7 before hosting the crucial second leg two weeks later. \nGamba was looking to become the first Japanese team to reach the final since they won it in 2008. \nAll content copyright ©2015 Pendleton Times-Post, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T17:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T17:32:26.677+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
