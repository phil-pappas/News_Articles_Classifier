That’s our expectation,\" Lovullo said. \"We all know when you carry extra weight, it puts more stress on your joints. To be an infielder you have to be a little more agile.\" Lovullo wanted to make it clear that Boston has these year-end conversations with every player about conditioning. That also includes Pablo Sandoval. \"We’re keeping an eye on our athletes. We don’t just let them go home and do nothing,\" Lovullo said. \"They’re on a program they follow and they’re expected to follow. It’s part of being on the Boston Red Sox. You come to spring training ready to go.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T03:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T14:33:12.156+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
