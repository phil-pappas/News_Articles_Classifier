We knew it was going to be like that. We just needed to stay out in front.”\nHowever, things changed very quickly, with the Cougars scoring two touchdowns in the final minutes of the first half, and then rolling in the second half to a 47-8 triumph over the Warriors to claim the division crown in Nalen’s first year at the helm.\nWith 2:15 left in the second quarter, Kevin Sullivan capped a 96-yard drive with a 2-yard run to push the Cougars’ lead to 19-8. After a three-and-out for Blue Hills, the Cougars got the ball back on their 43-yard line with 1:13 left in the half. Led by Sullivan, Bishop Connolly moved methodically to the Warriors 31 with six seconds remaining. That’s when Sullivan made the game-changing play — escaping pressure and heaving a Hail Mary into the end zone, a prayer that was answered by receiver Harold Beckford, who out-jumped multiple defenders and came down with the touchdown for a 26-8 lead.\n“I was just excited to end the half on a good note,” Sullivan said. “We had to go through what we had to do. We had a clear game plan, and I think we executed it well.”\nSullivan was the hero for Connolly (7-0), after the senior finished with 122 yards and two touchdowns passing, and 68 yards rushing and two more scores. Cameron Reis added 151 rushing yards and a touchdown.\nWhen asked what changed the game so quickly, Nalen said, “We switched up our defense a little bit, changed some of the techniques. Our guys were consistently grinding, and just trying to not make mistakes, and wait for them to. It was just more of a consistency thing out of us rather than a change.”\nConnolly took complete control with a 56-yard touchdown run by Jay McClure on the first play of the second half.\nIt was a rough day for the Warriors (5-2). After taking an early 8-6 lead on a 43-yard touchdown scamper by Noel Francois, the Warriors could not get anything going against the Cougars defense. Blue Hills did have an opportunity to jump back ahead late in the first half, but the offense turned the ball over on downs deep in Connolly territory. From that point, the Warriors were shut down.\nBishop Connolly now looks ahead to next week, and looks forward to finding out who it plays in the playoffs.\n“This is definitely a stepping stone in the right direction” Nalen said. “There’s a lot of things we have to fix, though, but it’s a step in the right direction. We just have to keep going, and moving forward.”", "external_links": ["http://player.mediabong.net/se/56.js?url=", "https://twitter.com/share?text=Cougars+pull+away+to+claim+division+title"], "published": "2015-10-25T13:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T12:25:41.570+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
