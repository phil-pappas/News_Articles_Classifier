I guess everybody's different. Just depends from your character or your approach to tennis and generally to everyday commitments,\" he said.\n\"I thought I should always try to improve in every possible occasion. Every time I'm on the court I see things I can be better on. That's one of the reasons that I keep on getting that motivation to move on.\n\"Today was a great match. Obviously the fact that he served that high of a first percentage of serves in and I managed to break him twice says enough about the quality of the return that I had today. That was the key to win the match.\"\nNext up for the seemingly unstoppable Serb, who won three out of four Grand Slam finals this year to reach 10 major titles, is Spain's David Ferrer, who beat Taiwanese wildcard Lu Yen-hsun 6-3, 6-1.\n- Rafa's revenge -\nEarlier, life was a little trickier for Rafael Nadal as he was forced to come from a set down against America's Jack Sock before setting up a chance for revenge in the semi-finals against Fabio Fognini.\nThe out-of-sorts Spanish great, scrapping to recover his form after a tough year, was outgunned by Sock's howitzer forehand but he dug deep to see off the world number 30, 3-6, 6-4, 6-3.\n\"Yes, it was an important victory for me. Obviously I finished the match playing better than what I started. It's important because I came back,\" Nadal said.\n\"This year I lost a lot of matches when I had an advantage. So to have the chance to win a match when I start losing this one, so it's important for me, too.\"\nNadal, into his first hardcourt semi-final for more than a year, will now face Fognini, who has beaten him three times this season including in last month's US Open third round.\n\"He's a great player. When you play against a great player, especially if you don't play to your best, your chances are lower,\" Nadal said of the Italian, who beat Uruguay's Pablo Cuevas 6-1, 2-6, 6-2.\n\"If I am able to play my best tomorrow... I am going to have my chances. If not, it's going to be tough. It's simple. Sport is simple.\"\nIn the women's draw, Ana Ivanovic beat Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova 6-3, 7-5 to set up a semi-final with Timea Bacsinszky, who recovered from a first-set 'bagel' to beat Sara Errani 0-6, 6-3, 7-5.\nAgnieszka Radwanska beat Angelique Kerber 6-1, 6-4 to go into a semi-final clash with the in-form Garbine Muguruza, who halted the run of American qualifier Bethanie Mattek-Sands 6-1, 7-5.\n© Provided by AFP Rafael Nadal hits a return against Jack Sock in their China Open quarter-final in Beijing on October 9, 2015 Go to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-10-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T04:19:08.601+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
