It'll have nothing to do with an alleged curse created by a bar owner to sell cheeseburgers and beer. It will have nothing to do with a magician or a flamingo.\nJoe Maddon on Cubs' 'phenomenal' season, playing on the road Joe Maddon on Cubs' 'phenomenal' season, playing on the road.\nJoe Maddon on Cubs' 'phenomenal' season, playing on the road.\nSee more videos The wild-card game will be won or lost by the performances of the same players you've watched win 97 games, the third most in the majors, and nothing else.\nSo act however you want, and don't let anyone tell you it's the wrong way.\nIf it makes you feel better to burn candles, wear an Ernie Banks jersey and move your mother's picture next to the TV, go ahead and do it. If you want to moan about the injustice of a do-or-die postseason game after a 162-game season, feel free to rant. And if you want to use every painful playoff moment in history as a reminder of what might happen, that's your right as well.\nBut before you go into game-time mode, please review some of the pertinent facts:\n•The Pirates are the best team in baseball since May 9 (85-48), and Cole has allowed only one extra-base hit to the Cubs this year in four starts.\n•The Cubs are 46-19 (.708) since July 27 and ended the season with an eight-game winning streak.\n•Arrieta's 0.75 ERA in the second half was the best of any starter in baseball history, and he shut out the Pirates on two hits over seven innings just last week.\nDan Haren on 'awesome' Cubs season, retirement Dan Haren on 'awesome' Cubs season, retirement.\nDan Haren on 'awesome' Cubs season, retirement.\nSee more videos •Cubs hitters led the majors in strikeouts with 1,518 and were third from the bottom with runners in scoring position (.237).\n•Pirates closer Mark Melancon saved 51 of 53 games and their bullpen was the best in the majors. They're 84-1 when leading after eight innings.\n•The Cubs are 48-33 on the road, their best road record since 1945, and won three of four in Pittsburgh two weeks ago.\nObjectively speaking, these are two great teams and longtime rivals going head-to-head, and it figures to be a fascinating, low-scoring game in which every strategic move will be under the microscope.\nAny old kind of a run might win it, as Jack Brickhouse would say, which is why the Cubs were practicing their bunting Saturday in Milwaukee.\nIt's safe to say the Cubs are peaking at the right time, just in time for the Wrigley Field ivy to change colors. The Cubs will only see it if they beat the Pirates, and there is no reason they can't.\nMany, including former manager Lou Piniella, think if the Cubs manage to win Wednesday they can handle the Cardinals in the National League Division Series, based on how the teams played down the stretch.\nIf you want to look that far ahead and start planning the rotation, that's fine.\nBut the Cubs can only afford to look at one game, a mantra that has served them so well under Joe Maddon this year.\nOne of my favorite postgame moments this season occurred Friday night in Milwaukee when someone asked Arrieta his confidence level going into Wednesday's start.\n\"Pretty good,\" he said with a grin.\nThere's no one else you'd rather have in the driver's seat if you're a Cubs fan, so you also should feel \"pretty good\" heading into the game.\nBut if your heart gets broken again, well, you've already proved it mends.\npsullivan@tribpub.com\nTwitter @PWSullivan\n Major League Baseball Chicago Cubs Pittsburgh Pirates Gerrit Cole National League Ernie Banks Mark Melancon", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-5611b63f/turbine/ct-joe-maddon-on-cubs-phenomenal-season-playing-on-the-road-20151004", "http://www.tribpub.com/privacy-policy-and-your-privacy-rights/", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-5611c810/turbine/ct-dan-haren-on-awesome-cubs-season-retirement-20151004", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-56126ead/turbine/ct-sullivan-cubs-wild-card-spt-1005-20151004-thumbnail"], "published": "2015-10-05T06:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T01:50:13.844+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
