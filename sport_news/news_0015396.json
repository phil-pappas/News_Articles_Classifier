The Huskies led Hockey East in attendance in 2014-15, averaging 5,396 in 14 home games. Boston College (5,221) was second, UMass Lowell (5,120) third and New Hampshire (5,058) fourth. \nUConn sold out last season's home opener Nov. 9 and skated to a 1-0 victory over Boston College before a crowd of 8,089, which was capacity, with most upper-deck sections closed off. \nAuriemma, who attended the hockey team's victory over BC and has developed a good relationship with Cavanaugh, shared his thoughts on the scheduling conflict in an email. \n\"It is what it is,\" Auriemma wrote. \"It's a big weekend for us, both recruiting-wise and basketball-wise. It just so happens that that's the way the schedule falls. Sometimes you have complete control over how things go and other times you don't. This is one of those times where obviously we've got to do what's best for us. We all are tremendous supporters of what Mike and the hockey team is doing. But, sometimes you just have to deal with how the schedule works out.\" \nThe attendance loss on either side might be minimal, in that First Night have drawn a large student turnout and hockey games have not. \nUConn spokesman Mike Enright said there is a department-wide goal to avoid as many conflicts as possible. \n\"And we are usually able to,\" Enright said. \"Is it the perfect situation? No. Did we talk about it? Yes. Did we try to do it a thousand different ways? Yes. It's not an ideal situation but in this case there's no way around it.\" \nScheduling games at the XL Center for both sports is sometimes complicated because of the Wolf Pack's AHL schedule. The Wolf Pack play Saturday night at home, for instance. The First Night event is part of the kickoff to homecoming weekend, which includes the football team's home game Saturday at noon against South Florida. It wouldn't make sense for First Night or the hockey game to go head-to-head with that game. Also complicating a potential move for the hockey game, scheduled roughly eight months in advance, is that Arizona State plays Thursday at Quinnipiac and Saturday at Sacred Heart. \nThe hockey team will play all its home games at the XL Center this season. Last season, two were played in Bridgeport and another was played at the Taft School in Watertown. Smaller crowds there brought the overall attendance average down. The Huskies' XL average was 5,814. \nOf the XL atmosphere, Cavanaugh said, \"That's what I dreamed it would be. I didn't really actually think it was going to be that good. I heard —- we went to our [national coaches] convention —- almost unanimously, from almost every team that played at the XL Center, 'I can't believe the atmosphere and energy you had in that building.' It's a credit to our fan base and our marketing department and everybody who works to sell tickets.\" \nAs of Wednesday afternoon, Enright said, 2,700 hockey season tickets had been sold (up about 500 from last season) and 4,000 tickets had been sold for the Arizona State game. It is impossible to predict what the walk-up crowd will be. \nUConn was 10-19-7 overall, 5-2-4 at home. The biggest XL crowds of the season were the opener Nov. 9 against BC, a 5-2 loss to BU Nov. 22 (7,712) and a 4-1 loss to New Hampshire Feb. 20 (6,887). \n\"It's hard to describe, just unbelievable,\" senior alternate captain Shawn Pauly said. \"The fans all came out to support us and it was just a tremendous atmosphere. It definitely helped us a lot and I'm looking forward to our home opener and all the games we have there this year.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T23:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T12:02:19.018+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
