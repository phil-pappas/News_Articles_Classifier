The Observatory said it the army was advancing in Huwaija, one of several villages where heavy fighting was continuing.\nThe army and its allies have also been fighting to retake parts of the northern provinces of Hama, Idlib and Latakia seized by rebels in recent months, as well as insurgent areas north of Homs city, around the capital Damascus, and in the southern province of Deraa near the Jordanian border.\nThe Observatory reported fighting around the town of Talbiseh, part of a rebel-held enclave north of Homs city which has faced heavy bombardment by Russian jets for the last two weeks, and a ground offensive by the army and allied militias.\nThe monitor said that at least 72 people, including 31 children and women, were killed in the past 48 hours in the assault in Homs.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T16:55:01.898+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
