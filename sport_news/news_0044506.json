The Browns needed this victory . Boy, did they need this victory. The drumbeat of negativity was reaching migraine proportions after the 1-3 start. Some fans and talk shows were discussing one of the favorite topics in Cleveland, \"Should the Browns fire everybody, or just somebody?\" And then, there was the call for Johnny Manziel to play.\n2. But after this game where they kept coming back and won to in Baltimore and with Josh McCown setting passing records, at least everyone can take a deep breath for a week. The Browns are only 2-3, but they beat Baltimore. How about this? The Browns are 1-0 in the AFC North for the first time since 2004! That year, they opened the season with a 20-3 victory over Baltimore. It was the best moment of the Jeff Garcia Era.\n3. This game was significant in that they usually lose a game on the road where they fall behind, then catch up ... and can't hold a lead. But they kept scoring. And McCown kept throwing the ball all over the place. He was 36-of-51 passing for a team record 457 yards. That's right, no Browns quarterback ever threw for more yards in a game. Brian Sipe (444) and Bernie Kosar (414) are the closest.\n4. Veteran left tackle Joe Thomas praised McCown for a variety of reasons. Then Thomas was asked once again about McCown. He smiled and said, \"He's surprisingly mobile for being 50 years old.\" Later, asked about McCown, Thomas laughed and said, \"Put in Johnny!\"\n5. McCown's record-breaking three-game stretch -- no Browns quarterback has thrown for more yards in any three consecutive games than McCown -- has silenced the Johnny Manziel talk ... for a while.\n6. Thomas and several other members of the Browns said the Ravens were determined to take away the Browns running attack. San Diego and some other teams earlier in the year took the same approach. So the Browns have been throwing the ball ... a lot. But they also are throwing it to running backs Duke Johnson and Isaiah Crowell, those short passes almost serving as a form of the running game.\n7. Consider that Crowell caught a short toss from McCown, then rumbled 22 yards and leaped into the end zone for a touchdown with 3:03 left in the fourth quarter. Johnson and Crowell combined for eight catches and 93 yards. They ran the ball 22 times for 71 yards.\n8. New offensive coordinator John DeFilippo said one of his plans was to involve the running backs more in the passing game. Last year, the running backs combined for only 29 catches in 2014. Johnson and Crowell have already combined for 28 catches.\n9. Part of the reason that tight end Gary Barnidge often is open is because Travis Benjamin is now drawing lots of defensive attention when he goes out for deep passes. The middle of the field often is wide open because a safety is chasing Benjamin.\n10. You can dwell on how the signing of Dwayne Bowe (inactive) was a mistake, and you'd be right. But the receivers have been playing well. Very few dropped passes. McCown is not setting these records throwing to himself.\n11. Browns quarterbacks have thrown nine TDs compared to two interceptions. Their rating is 102.2. Most of those numbers belong to the \"50-year-old\" McCown, as Thomas called him. Actually, McCown is 36.\n12. McCown desperately needed a win as a starter. He was 1-10 with Tampa Bay last year. He was 0-3 with the Browns before this game. In 2013 when McCown filled in for the Bears, he played very well and was 3-2.\n13. Had the Browns lost, Mike Pettine would have had to spend more time explaining why he failed to use all his timeouts at the end of regulation. It was very poor clock management. When asked about it, Pettine's explanation was vague. He has to do a better job.\n14. Joe Haden left the game with a concussion . Pierre Desir filled in and played well.\n15. Medina product Kyle Juszczyk caught a touchdown pass and had three catches. The Ravens fullback from Harvard has caught 11 passes this season.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T03:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T12:29:34.464+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
