In the second-half we changed the shape but, more importantly, I changed the attitude. \n“We were more aggressive with our starting possession, we got more of the second ball and we passed more with a purpose. \n“We scored and they were reeling – on another day, with better finishing and better decision making around the box, we could certainly have got something from the game. \n“But what I would say is that, when you’re 2-0 down, it’s easy to be brave – and I need players who are going to be brave at 0-0 or when we’re 1-0 up. \n“We finished the game strongly and I am happy with that, but the first half was nowhere near good enough.” \nTony Diagne put Macclesfield ahead on the half-hour, netting from a corner after his first effort had been blocked by Kevin Toner.
