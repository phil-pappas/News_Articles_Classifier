The second time, Miller was fined for the celebration, which caught the attention of the authors themselves. \nNow, Key and Peele have donated an amount equal to the fine to Miller’s charity, Von’s Vision, which is devoting to providing eye care to low-income Denver children. Keegan and I gave Von Miller's awesome charity #Vonsvision the amount of his recent fine. You should too. Get kids glasses! #threepumprule \n— Jordan Peele (@JordanPeele) October 16, 2015 Preciate u @KeeganMKey & @JordanPeele for showing love to #vonsvision Thrust fine = 450+ pairs of glasses for kids!! pic.twitter.com/v337cJdgjY \n— Von Miller (@Millerlite40) October 16, 2015 \nGood for everyone involved. Now, perhaps, they could convince him to appear on the show next.
