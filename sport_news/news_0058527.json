Hinch has a “soft rule” when it comes to a rain delay during a game: If it lasts about an hour, he’ll usually remove his starting pitcher. \nGood thing it’s not a hard rule. \nHinch opted to keep Collin McHugh on the mound after a 49-minute stoppage Thursday night, and the soft-spoken righty responded with a resounding performance. He shut down the Kansas City Royals over six innings for a 5-2 victory in the opener of their AL Division Series. \n“We checked in with him a couple times, but he was never really coming out of that game,” Hinch said of McHugh, a surprise 19-game winner this season. “That wasn’t even his best tonight, and he got through a pretty good lineup and battled.” \nThree relievers took over and got the game to Luke Gregerson, part of Oakland’s wild-card collapse in Kansas City last year. He handled the ninth for a save. \nGeorge Springer and Colby Rasmus went deep for the homer-happy Astros, but they also scored via the same sort of small ball the Royals used in reaching the World Series last season. \n“Winning the first game was key,” Astros outfielder Carlos Gomez said. “We did that.” \nYordano Ventura (0-1) yielded three runs on four hits and a walk in two innings for Kansas City, but did not come back following the delay. Chris Young served up Springer’s home run with one out in the fifth, but tossed four otherwise solid innings of relief. \nGame 2 is Friday, when lefty Scott Kazmir takes the mound for Houston against right-hander Johnny Cueto in a matchup of pitchers traded days apart this past summer. \n“It’s a five-game series,” Royals manager Ned Yost said. “It’s not a death sentence to lose Game 1.” \nThe Astros, who struggled so mightily on the road this season, have apparently solved their woes just in time. They beat the Yankees 3-0 in New York in Tuesday night’s wild-card game, then took care of a Royals club built specifically for spacious Kauffman Stadium. \nHouston also made it the first time since 1970 that visiting teams won baseball’s first four postseason games, STATS said. The other two times it happened were 1906 and 1923. \n“Everyone knows we haven’t been playing the best on the road,” reliever Tony Sipp said. “To take one in New York and come here, it shows we’re a different kind of team.” \nThe Astros wasted no time getting Ventura in trouble, loading the bases with nobody out in the first inning. The hard-throwing ace settled down to retire the next three batters, but Rasmus and Evan Gattis provided RBI groundouts to give Houston a 2-0 lead. \nJose Altuve tacked on another run in the second with a single to right.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T07:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T10:08:57.171+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
