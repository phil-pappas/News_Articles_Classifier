The man was a subcontractor, Yale spokeswoman Karen Peart said.\nThe man's name was not immediately released, but fire officials said he was from Oregon and was a longtime worker for a company doing the work for the university, the Hartford Courant reported.\nMarcarelli said the man was stuck for an hour while crews worked to open the side of the chimney. They had to cut through a stainless steel liner to get him.", "external_links": ["http://www.courant.com/news/connecticut/hc-new-haven-smokestack-rescue-1018-20151017-story.html"], "published": "2015-10-18T05:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T07:16:21.218+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
