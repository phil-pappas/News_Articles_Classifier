Er, right?\nYou’d think so. But according to Rousey’s own mom Dr. AnnMaria DeMars , he’s a “terrible coach.” During a recent interview with L atiNation , DeMars was asked her opinion of Tarverdyan—and she didn’t hold back one bit.\n“I think Edmond is a terrible coach, and I will say it publicly,” she said. “I think he hit the lottery when Ronda walked in there. She was winning before she even met him. She probably won 99 percent of the judo matches she ever fought in. She had won the Junior Worlds when she was 17. She got a bronze medal in the Olympics. She got a silver medal in world championships. She was one of the top athletes in the world when she walked in there, and he wouldn’t even give her the time of day for months. Somebody like that is a terrible coach.”\nIf she’s so bad, though, why does Rousey keep him around? DeMars has a simple explanation for that.\n“I think she stays there because it’s like somebody who pitches a no-hitter when they’re wearing red underwear and then they wear that red underwear every day,” she said. “I think it’s superstition. I would caution anybody from going there. I think it’s bad he uses her to lure people in, and I told Ronda I’m not going to be quiet about this anymore. He’s a bad person.”\nYikes. Why don’t you tell us how you really feel?!\nEven if everything DeMars says is true and Tarverdyan is a bad person, it’s hard to blame Rousey for keeping him around. After all, she’s 12-0, so if it ain’t broke…\n .\n[ via For The Win ]", "external_links": ["http://ftw.usatoday.com/2015/10/ronda-rouseys-mom-calls-ronda-rouseys-coach-terrible-and-she-means-it"], "published": "2015-10-14T18:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T22:23:06.144+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
