But that wasn't even the highlight of the weekend for the Wildcats — it was their strong dance game. \n\nWe reported earlier that Northwestern's Jerry Brown may have the best assistant coach dance moves in college football after he was seen showing off his moves following the Wildcats' 16-6 season opening win against Stanford. \nHis players want to challenge him to a dance off, apparently. \nFreshman Steven Reese celebrated during the Wildcats' impressive 27-0 win over Big Ten rival Minnesota like only a child who was born in the 90s could do — \n\nCheck out that hip thrust. pic.twitter.com/5WyMViuyhY — #B1GCats Football (@NUFBFamily) \nNo matter what happens in the Big Ten race, we know one thing — \n\nOregon bounced back from its worst home loss since 1977 with a 41-21 win over Colorado, a team that is technically in the Pac 12, but that's just the beginning of this story. \nAbout a dozen football players also got stuck on an elevator at the team hotel. \nYou can go to the Twitter feed of Oregon wide receiver Devon Allen \nTrapped in an elevator chronicles chapter 2 pt. 5 I repeat I'm not on the elevator but about 12-15 of my teammates are! #savetheducks — DEVO ΑLLΕΝ 1⃣3⃣ (@DevonAllen13) \nTrapped in an elevator chronicles chapter 2 pt. 7 ladder coming in!! pic.twitter.com/DceFmYA8qq — DEVO ΑLLΕΝ 1⃣3⃣ (@DevonAllen13) \nTrapped in an elevator chronicles chapter 2 pt. 8 ladder only supports 300lbs.

And it should be noted that no actual Ducks were harmed during the print of this recap. Former Jazz guard Jeff Hornaceck hasn't aged a bit \nThe former Phoenix Suns and Utah Jazz standout and current Suns head coach led his team out to a throwback game for an intrasquad scrimmage at the team's old Veterans Memorial Coliseum on Saturday, and he showed up the rest of the coaches in the Western Conference in doing so. \nSince the game was a \"throwback game,\" Hornaceck decided to do the ultimate throwback — \nJeff Hornacek pulled out his 1992 Suns warmups (and washed them) to wear them for the return to the Coliseum. pic.twitter.com/ONu2eAIBPI — Paul Coro (@paulcoro) \nIt doesn't look like Hornaceck struggled to fit into his suit, either; he walked around in the clean, fresh suit that fit like a glove as he coached his team and interacted with fans. \nThe next stop may be for the Suns, who finished 10th in the West with a 39-43 record a year ago, to sign Hornaceck to a 10-day contract.
