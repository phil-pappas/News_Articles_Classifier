This isn't a new development, and there's little reason to believe that had changed at all in the more than a year since the German manager left Donovan off the 2014 U.S. World Cup roster. Not even when they labored through fake smiles and handshakes during Donovan's farewell match for the U.S. almost exactly a year ago, and not even after Donovan was brought in to help coach the U.S. Under-20 World Cup team.\nThe only thing surprising about Donovan's comments this week, telling ESPN FC essentially that Klinsmann should be fired if the U.S. loses to Mexico on Saturday, is the timing. The U.S.-Mexico match was set in stone more than two months ago, but Donovan dropped his bombs just days before the big match, serving up an unneeded distraction for the team he represented for so long, and many players who he called teammates for years.\nDonovan's comments weren't poorly timed because they might hurt Klinsmann's feelings — let's face it, Klinsmann probably laughed at them. No, they were poorly timed because of the distraction it already has turned into for a U.S. team trying to focus on winning a big game.\nAnything Donovan says about Klinsmann will be perceived as sour grapes for eternity. That doesn't mean Donovan shouldn't be allowed to speak his mind about Klinsmann as long as Klinsmann is coaching the U.S. That said, timing does matter, and there are times when Donovan's blunt commentary will sound even more like the tainted musings of someone with a vendetta.\nThe reality is Donovan's comments wouldn't have elicited the reaction they have if they had been said by pretty much anybody else. Donovan's opinion is a completely reasonable one, and one shared by many. Because it is Donovan, a polarizing figure in American soccer circles at this point, we saw a very emotional reaction, particularly from those U.S. fans who believe Klinsmann is doing a good job.\nThis isn't the first time Donovan's timing let him down. A year ago, almost immediately after the U.S. was eliminated from the World Cup, Donovan stepped up with scathing comments about the team, and basically said Klinsmann mishandled the showpiece tournament.\n“If you really look at the performances, there were some good performances by guys, some not-so-good performances by guys. As a whole, I think tactically, the team was not set up to succeed,” Donovan said of the U.S. World Cup exit in 2014. “They were set up in a way that was opposite from what they’ve been the past couple years, which is opening up, passing, attacking — trying to do that. And the team’s been successful that way. Why they decided to switch that in the World Cup, none of us will know.”\nDonovan is in an unenviable position. Throughout his career he has been willing to speak his mind, and his candor is part of the reason he has gained as many admirers as he still has among U.S. fans and journalists. Biting his tongue isn't something Donovan does often, so now here he is, retired and highly sought after for interviews to discuss the national team, and avoiding questions about Klinsmann is probably impossible\nDonovan hasn't backed down from his statements, and even took to Twitter to defend his right to speak his mind.\nSo I'm not allowed to have an opinion when asked a question? And if I answer truthfully, I'm bitter? https://t.co/6nVlYbYeFu\n— Landon Donovan (@landondonovan) October 6, 2015\nThere is no denying he did more than enough during his playing career to deserve respect and the right to voice his opinion, but at least in this instance, Donovan should have given a little more thought about the timing of his statements and the distraction it could become to the national team he starred on for so many years.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["https://t.co/6nVlYbYeFu", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "http://www.goal.com/en-us"], "published": "2015-10-07T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T17:19:29.335+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
