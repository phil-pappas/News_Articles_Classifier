Comment By Eric Avidon/Daily News Staff   By Eric Avidon/Daily News Staff Posted Sep. 30, 2015 at 6:00 PM By Eric Avidon/Daily News Staff Posted Sep. 30, 2015 at 6:00 PM CHESTNUT HILL — No name is more synonymous with Boston College football than Flutie. First Doug and Darren led the Eagles to places they’d never been before, and then Billy played for the Eagles in a career hampered by a broken ankle before it ever got under way. So less then two weeks ago when Troy — son of Darren, nephew of Doug, and cousin of Billy — was thrust into a battle to become BC’s starting quarterback after Darius Wade suffered a season-ending injury, his was naturally the name that drew the most attention. But there’s another young quarterback vying for the job, and thus far he’s proven to be just as worthy of winning it as Flutie. Jeff Smith, a true freshman, didn’t grow up in Natick, just a stone’s throw from the BC campus, and he doesn’t have a bloodline thick with BC marrow, but for the second game in a row he and Flutie are expected to split up the snaps when the Eagles travel to Duke on Saturday for their first road test of the season. “Jeff is a great runner and he throws it, but he’s just young,” BC coach Steve Addazio said Wednesday. “Troy has been here longer. Troy has a little better understanding of reading coverages and knowing the defenses, but it comes down to making plays, the guy who makes the most plays. ... We have to get some explosiveness, which is hard to do when you’re playing with quarterbacks that have no experience.” Flutie, a redshirt freshman, wasn’t heavily recruited by other schools, and when the offer came from BC he chose to embrace his family’s legacy. Smith, on the other hand, had offers from Wisconsin, Indiana, and Army — among others — and was being recruited by Northwestern. But after running for more than 1,000 yards in both his junior and senior seasons while playing quarterback at Central Catholic High in Clearwater, Fla., he was considered more of an athlete than an actual quarterback. BC, however, didn’t want him as a wide receiver or defensive back or returner. The Eagles wanted him as a quarterback — he also threw for over 2,000 yards as a junior and senior in high school. And when quarterback seemed like a crowded position during fall camp with five on the roster — all either first- or second-year players — Smith impressed enough to earn a spot as Wade’s co-backup alongside Flutie while fellow true freshman Elijah Robinson was converted to wide receiver. “It was a couple of different things,” offensive coordinator Todd Fitch said of the decision to move Robinson while keeping Smith at quarterback. “Just what we saw with raw talent throwing the ball, and where the two were at, we didn’t want two in that same class staying (at QB). Elijah had great makeup, qualities that we liked, but we just thought that long-term maybe Jeff had a bigger upside.” Page 2 of 2 - And when asked whether they envisioned Smith as a quarterback throughout the recruiting process, both Addazio and Fitch said they did. “He reminded me — maybe not size-wise — of Donovan McNabb, who we had at Syracuse,” said Addazio. “No one offered him as a quarterback and he ended up being a great quarterback. Jeff had offers to play quarterback. ... Jeff is on his way. He can throw the ball. He’s just a freshman. That’s his biggest problem right now.” Likewise, Fitch said, “Obviously there’s athletic talent there that you can take a guy like that, and if for some reason it doesn’t work out as a quarterback he has decent size, height, speed, so obviously you could potentially do something with him, but we never kicked it around that we were going to move him.” As the competition between Flutie and Smith progresses, the thinking is that Flutie is the better passer while Smith is the better runner. And while that’s true, Smith is not a novice when it comes to throwing the ball. He threw for a school-record 397 yards in a game during his senior year of high school, and amassed 4,359 yards through the air over his final two years at Central Catholic. Still, it hasn’t yet translated to the collegiate level. Smith has attempted just five passes and completed two, and is quick to tuck the ball under his arm and run rather than stand in the pocket and wait for routes to develop. And that’s where Smith knows he needs to get better. “I’m still trying to get better throwing the ball,” Smith, who was not made available to the media this week, said last Saturday after BC’s 17-14 win over Northern Illinois. “Right now, (I’m doing) read option kind of stuff.” Flutie has the name recognition, and clearly some significant skill as well. But Smith, too, has shown substantial skill since his arrival at the Heights less than two months ago. Which is why Addazio still has no idea who will eventually be BC’s starting quarterback this season. Or whether he’ll simply have two.
