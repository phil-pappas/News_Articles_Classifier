But he was a success from the very start, winning a 2014 summer series 5K at Takanassee Lake in Long Branch; maintaining that pace halfway round the world to win a 5K in Brisbane, Australia, early last summer; and now rising to the top of the heap in one of New Jersey's strongest competitive counties.\nAnd, even before he crossed the line to claim the gold medal in the 179-runner, 25-school field Tuesday at Holmdel Park, he couldn't help rejoicing. All smiles, all exuberance, he completed the rugged five-kilometer (3.1-mile) course in the best time of his life, 16:21; outran several expected to beat him over the line, and thus became OTHS's first Monmouth County champion since Lou Raffetto in 1998.\n\"Just off the last hill, that's where I surged,\" said Gindi, who improved from sixth place in 2014 (back of winner Aaron Barlev of Holmdel, now at Maryland) and then had 4:25 mile and 9:29 two-mile bests on the track.\n\"Jordan (Brannan of Colts Neck) started looking tired going up that hill, but I kept that pace the rest of the way.\n\"Physically, I felt amazing. Before it, I stretched every ligament I could. I even stretched some ligaments I couldn't think of. When I crossed the line, I felt complete happiness.\"\n\"Before the race, I showed him those (1998) Raffetto clippings,\" said Ocean coach Mark DeSomma. \"I told him he could win this, too. And, sure enough, he did.\"\nOne thing Gindi couldn't do, or come close to doing, though, was lead any school other than Christian Brothers Academy to the county team title. Colts Neck's Brannan (16:31) took runner-up honors, but CBA, led by third-placer Genaro Anzalone (16:42), packed its five scoring runners into the next six places to run with its 14th straight Monmouth crown and 46th all told since the meet's origin on the campus of Monmouth College (now University) in 1960.\nCBA won it despite resting many of its top runners, but Anzalone and teammates still rose to the occasion. \"Usually, I'm about number 10 on our team,\" said Anzalone, \"but everybody stepped up today. We're all aware of CBA's great history. Our job, always, is to keep it going.\"\nThere were no such upsets in the co-featured girls championship race.\nWith 2014 county champion Marin Warner of Holmdel now at the University of Pennsylvania, the path was clear for Red Bank Regional's Lauren Sapone, to ascend the vacated throne and win it all in 18:44. But dynastic Red Bank Catholic, led by 11th-placer Caitlin O'Hare, followed another familiar script by putting its five runners in the first 23 and leading the county team race for the eighth time in nine years and 18th all-time.\n\"I wasn't feeling that great but I knew that every person I passed was going to help us win as a team,\" said O'Hare. \"Every step we took was a step to our team's success.\"\nHowell junior Niamh Hayes (18:59) and Freehold Township senior Ciara Roche (19:24) were a distant 2-3 back of the Dartmouth-bound Sapone.\nThe girls team race was a lot closer than the boys event.\nWhile CBA (with a low-low 28 points and a five-man total of 1:23:46 and a 16:45.20 average) won decisively over Colts Neck (86), Middletown South (122), Middletown North (131), Manasquan (199) and 20 others, the RBC girls (with 78 points, a 1:43:58 total and 20:47.60 average) had tough challenges from Red Bank Regional (112), Rumson-Fair Haven (126), Freehold Township (130) and Middletown South (150).\nNo one has beaten the CBA boys in this meet since Red Bank Regional in 2001; the Rumson-Fair Haven girls (in 2011) were the last to top RBC's girls.\n\"I had great, great competition today, and that was really cool,\" said Sapone, a 4:52 miler during the track season who is RBR's first county champion since Christine Nelson in 2004.\n\"I went out with the leaders but didn't pull away until coming out of The Bowl (in the backwoods) with about half a mile to go. I ran a fair amount of mileage this summer and came into this season fairly healthy.\n\"It's all paying off now.\"\nHayes was happy with her second place.\n\"Especially after last year when I was still coming off appendix surgery and finished somewhere back in the 20's,\" Hayes said.\nMONMOUTH COUNTY CROSS COUNTRY CHAMPIONSHIPS\nBOYS 5K AT HOLMDEL PARK.\nTOP 20 TEAM SCORES:\n1.
