For the first time since 2003, Indian cagers made it to the quarterfinals of the biannual event at Changsha Hunan, China.\nDespite the 65-99 defeat against world No 31 Philippines, India progressed to the knockout stage having recorded two wins in the second round.\nWith India's quarterfinal berth hanging in balance, defending champions Iran did them a huge favour as they shut the doors on Palestine, handing them 46-point (94-48) drubbing in the last second round game. The result gave India a place in the last eight stage after the national hoopsters posted a thrilling three-point win over Palestine on Sunday.\nAt the end of the second round, Philippines, Iran, Japan and India advanced to the quarterfinals from Group E alongside Group F teams â€” China, Qatar, Lebanon and Jordan.\nIn their last league game of the second round against Philippines, Indian cagers started on a positive note but failed to keep the momentum going and suffered a 34-point defeat as India's bench failed to deliver. The quarterwise progress Philippines read 17-16, 19-26, 14-23, 15-34.\nWhile six Philippines players scored in double figures, Indian skipper Vishesh Bhriguvanshi posted a game-high total of 21 points and three assists. Lanky centre Amrit Pal Singh recorded his first double-double with 18 points, 13 rebounds. In form forward Amjyot Singh contributed 11 points and pulled five rebounds.\n\"One of our goals was to make it to the quarterfinals. We have done that and are happy with the result till now. We now will do our best to prepare ourselves for the quarterfinals,\" Bhriguvanshi told TOI.\nHaving finished 11th in 2013, India's best finish in ABC, however, was way back in 1967 and 1975 when they achieved the semifinal finish while made it to the quarterfinal stage in 2001 and 2003. In 1989 the team finished a creditable 6th.\nGiving full credit to the heroics of Amjyot and Amrit Pal in the championship so far veteran forward Yadwinder Singh said, \"We are ecstatic to reach quarterfinals and all the players have put in a lot of effort. Compared to teams in the past, the key difference has been the improved performance of our big men Amjyot and Amrit Pal.\"\nIn the quarterfinals to be played after a day's break on Thursday, India will face the challenge of hosts and world No 14 China.
