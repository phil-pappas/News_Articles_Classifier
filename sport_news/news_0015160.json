The Chargers suffered an excruciating loss to the Pittsburgh Steelers on Monday night, losing on Le’Veon Bell’s 1-yard run as time expired after blowing three leads.\nOr maybe 24, by itself. That’s the yardage of Michael Vick’s scramble, on third-and-6 from the Chargers’ 41-yard line with 36 seconds left, that put the ball at the 16 and put the Steelers in position to pull this off.\nThen there were 72, Vick’s TD pass to Markus Wheaton one play after a Chargers touchdown in the fourth quarter, and 70, the distance that Antwon Blake returned a Philip Rivers interception for a score in the third quarter.\nWant more? How about six? That’s the number of concussions that Chargers players have been either diagnosed with or suspected of, after center/guard Chris Watt left the game in the second half to be examined for a “head injury,” as the team put it.\nOr what about 12, and counting? That’s the number of offensive linemen the Chargers have already gone through in just five weeks. They used everybody they had Monday night, and by the end of the evening the guys on the field included two who weren’t even with the organization in Week 1, J.D. Walton and Kenny Wiggins.\nThat brings us to the number five: the number of holding penalties on Chargers linemen, one of which was declined. San Diego overcame two in its fourth-quarter touchdown drive, which was capped by Rivers’ second touchdown pass of the game to Antonio Gates for a 17-10 lead with 8:02 to play.\nThe others short-circuited first half drives that, under the circumstances, the Chargers certainly wish they’d had back.\nHere’s an intriguing number: 67,658, the announced attendance Monday night at Qualcomm Stadium. And another: 60, the estimated percentage of how many of those fans were rooting for the visiting Steelers.\nConsider: When Bell took a direct snap and went off left tackle for what eventually turned out to be the winning touchdown, the roar was huge. When the play was reviewed and upheld, the tape confirming that Bell got the ball into the end zone before Donald Butler drove his knee to the turf, the roar was even louder, Steelers fans twirling their Terrible Towels in delight.\n“It was like being on the road,” Rivers said.\nThe entire night, with the Chargers seemingly playing in Heinz Field West, pretty much confirmed suspicions going into the season that San Diego fans, fed up with the team’s flirtation with Los Angeles, wouldn’t need much temptation to sell their tickets to visiting fans.\nThis may as well have been the Chargers’ ninth road game. And 10, 11 and quite probably 12 are on the horizon, too, against the Raiders in two weeks, the Bears on a Monday night in November and Denver in December.\nRivers said his voice was hoarse from dealing with the noise of Steelers fans. Maybe the Chargers will need to start piping in noise during practices before home games, too.\nThere were some positive digits for the Chargers. Gates, in his return from a four-game PED suspension, caught his 100th and 101st career touchdown passes, a 12-yarder from Rivers on the first series in the game and the aforementioned 11-yarder that opened a 17-10 fourth-quarter lead.\n1 2 Next Page", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T09:20:19.703+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
