(Photo: AP) Kathmandu: Dozens of runners donned snow goggles and braved icy temperatures to participate in the world's highest marathon in the foothills of Mount Everest Monday, five months after a 7.8-magnitude earthquake devastated Nepal.\nThe annual Tenzing-Hillary Everest Marathon, which kicked off in 2003, is usually held in May to mark the anniversary of the first conquest of Everest by Tenzing Norgay and Edmund Hillary on May 29, 1953.\nBut organisers postponed this year's race to October after a massive earthquake hit the Himalayan nation in April, killing nearly 8,900 people and triggering an avalanche on Everest base camp that left 18 dead.\n\"We decided not to cancel the race entirely because we wanted to send a positive message about Nepal to the world and help revive our tourism industry,\" organiser Shikhar Pandey told AFP.\n\"Everest represents Nepal. We want to tell the world that Nepal is safe by successfully organising an event like this,\" he said.\nFifty-four people from countries including the UK, United States, Israel, Poland and Australia took part in this year's race, with half of the participants belonging to Nepal.\nRunners in trekking boots kicked off the marathon around 07:00 am (0115 GMT), with the snow-covered trails taking them from Everest base camp at a height of 5,364 metres (17,598 feet) to the finishing line about 2,000 metres below in the Himalayan town of Namche Bazaar.\nNepali soldier Bhim Gurung bagged first place by completing the marathon in four hours, one minute and 54 seconds. \"A race at this altitude is very difficult. I am very happy to have come first,\" Gurung told AFP.\nThe air at base camp contains only half as much oxygen as at sea level, leaving many runners gasping for breath on even the slightest incline along 42 kilometres of narrow, rocky mountain paths.\nWhile turnout was far lower than the 150 people who took part last year organisers said they were happy nonetheless. They describe the route, which weaves past Buddhist monasteries, yak herds and over suspension bridges, as \"probably the most adventurous trail run in the world\".\n athletics Tenzing-Hillary Everest Marathon Nepal earthquake Mount Everest Nepal earthquake: Death toll surpasses 8,000; many still missing Loading...

Photo: AP 7/25 Acrid, white smoke rose above the nation's most revered Hindu temple, where dozens of bodies were being cremated at any given time. 8/25 Aid groups received the first word from remote mountain villages — reports that suggested many communities perched on mountainsides were devastated or struggling to cope. 9/25 Landslides hindered rescue teams that tried to use mountain trails to reach those in need, said Prakash Subedi, chief district official in the Gorkha region, where the quake was centered. 12/25 With people fearing more quakes, tens of thousands spent the day crowding in the streets and the night sleeping in parks or on a golf course. Others camped in open squares lined by cracked buildings and piles of rubble. Helicopter blades thudded periodically overhead. 13/25 Nepal authorities said Sunday that at least 2,430 people died in that country alone, not including the 18 dead in the avalanche. Another 61 people died from the quake in India and a few in other neighboring countries. 14/25 At least 1,152 people died in Kathmandu, and the number of injured nationwide was upward of 5,900. With search-and-rescue efforts far from over, it was unclear how much the death toll would rise. 15/25 The capital city is largely a collection of small, poorly constructed brick apartment buildings. But outside of the oldest neighborhoods, many in Kathmandu were surprised by how few modern structures collapsed in the quake. 16/25 While aid workers cautioned that many buildings could have sustained serious structural damage, it was also clear that the death toll would have been far higher had more buildings caved in. 17/25 Aid workers also warned that the situation could be far worse near the epicenter west of Kathmandu. The U.S. Geological Survey said the quake was centered near Lamjung, about 80 kilometers (50 miles) northwest of Kathmandu. 18/25 As planeloads of supplies, doctors and relief workers from neighboring countries arrived at Kathmandu's airport, thousands of Indians lined up outside in hopes of gaining a seat on a plane returning to New Delhi. 19/25 The earthquake was the worst to hit the South Asian nation in more than 80 years. It destroyed swaths of the oldest neighborhoods of Kathmandu and was strong enough to be felt all across parts of India, Bangladesh, China's region of Tibet and Pakistan. 20/25 Nepal's worst recorded earthquake in 1934 measured 8.0 and all but destroyed the cities of Kathmandu, Bhaktapur and Patan. 21/25 Rescuers aided by international teams spent Sunday digging through rubble of buildings — concrete slabs, bricks, iron beams, wood — to look for survivors. Because the air was filled with chalky concrete dust, many people wore breathing masks or held shawls over their faces. 22/25 Hundreds of people in the western Kalanki neighborhood nervously watched the slow progress of a single backhoe digging into the rubble of the collapsed Lumbini Guest House, once a three-story budget hotel frequented by Nepalese. 23/25 Police officer RP Dhamala, who was coordinating the rescue efforts, said they had already pulled out 12 people alive and six dead. He said rescuers were still searching for about 20 people believed to be trapped but had heard no cries, taps or noises for a while. 24/25 Most areas were without power and water. The United Nations said hospitals in the Kathmandu Valley were overcrowded and running out of emergency supplies and space to store corpses. 25/25 India suffered its own losses from the quake, with at least 61 people killed there and dozens injured. Sunday's aftershock was also widely felt in the country, and local news reports said metro trains in New Delhi and Kolkata were briefly shut down when the shaking started. Other countries sending support Sunday included the United States, the United Arab Emirates, Germany and France.
