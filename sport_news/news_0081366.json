(AP) â€” Michigan State defensive back Jalen Watts-Jackson was released from the hospital Monday, a day after he had surgery on a hip he injured while scoring the winning touchdown against Michigan. A Michigan State spokesman said Watts-Jackson returned to the school's campus Monday. Watts-Jackson came up with a Michigan fumble on the final play of the game and returned it 38 yards to give the seventh-ranked Spartans an incredible 27-23 victory Saturday. The redshirt freshman appeared to land hard on his left hip while being tackled into the end zone by Michigan tight end Jake Butt. His surgery Sunday at the University of Michigan hospital lasted more than three hours.
