I mean, who brings toilet paper? Little things like that make your trip easier. It’s a good thing for us. If it helps us win, I’m all for it.”\nHe hadn’t availed himself of the durable American cloth since Thursday night’s arrival.\n“No, not yet — maybe when I get back [to the hotel],” Pace said. “At least I know I’ll have some familiar toilet paper.”\nBut Nick Mangold isn’t sure toilet paper was a necessary item on the packing list, which also included hot sauce, more than 300 electrical adapters and a set of giveaway keychains, according to the Times report.\nThe first question Mangold received from a British reporter Friday was if he used the local toilet paper on a July promotional trip across the pond. He said he had and had no issues.\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google Whatsapp Email Filed under calvin pace ,  new york jets ,  nick mangold", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T15:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T20:33:42.359+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
