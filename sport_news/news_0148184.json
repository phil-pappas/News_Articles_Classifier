Subban"], "text": "Report an error TORONTO - \nSitting in a private box at the Air Canada Centre, Marcus Stroman, like many of his Blue Jay teammates, wore a Maple Leafs jersey to opening night of the NHL season. \nBut there was one exception. \nSticking out in this sea of blue was Australian pitcher Liam Hendriks, who was decked out in Habs bleu blanc rouge for the Canadiens 3-1 victory over the Maple Leafs in the curtain raiser of the 2015-16 campaign. \nWhat gives here? Who put Hendriks up to this? \nLook no further than P.K. Subban, the Toronto-area native Leaf fans love to hate. \nMeeting with reporters afterward, Subban came clean. Indeed, he was responsible. \n“I got a Subban shirt for (Hendriks) today, so we did a little trade.” \nNice shout out to the Blue Jays from the Leafs. Don't stay out to late- there's a game tomorrow. pic.twitter.com/w1R7s2Ao20 — Nick Maiorano (@nickm1010) October 8, 2015 \n\nIn return, Hendriks gave the flamboyant Habs defenceman a customized “Subbanator 76” Blue Jays jersey, something Subban very much cherishes with the Jays poised to kick off their 2015 American League Divisional Series against the Texas Rangers at Rogers Centre Thursday afternoon. \n“It’s great,” Subban said. “I support them. These guys, they should be supported. They should be on the Jumbotron. We should be supporting them and being positive about all these guys because what they’re doing is great. \n“As someone being from Toronto, in 1992 and ‘93, I wasn’t really old enough to witness and appreciate some serious playoff baseball. This is an exciting time of the year for anyone who is a serious baseball fan. And it’s a great time of the year for anyone who’s from Toronto.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T06:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T07:11:26.495+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
