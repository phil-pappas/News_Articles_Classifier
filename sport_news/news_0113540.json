The freshman failed an NCAA performance enhancing drug test. Many reports claim it was the steroid-like drug, Ligandrol. \nThe Gators are hopeful they'll get their leader back. The experts, aren't so sure. \n\"I'd be stunned if they win the appeal,\" said ESPN college football insider Brett McMurphy. Florida QB Will Grier was suspended by the NCAA for using a banned substance. ESPN's Staff Writer Brett McMurphy comments on his story. WTSP \nMcMurphy, who spent time in Tampa as a college football writer for the Tampa Tribune, spoke in the 10News studios about the process of appealing a suspension like the one Grier is facing. \n\"What it means is he's out one calendar year. The rest of this year. The first six games of next year and if he ever tests positive for any banned substance through the NCAA his NCAA career is over,\" explained McMurphy. \nFlorida cannot release details of what substance Grier was caught with because of personal medical laws. \nThe 8th-ranked Gators (6-0) are off to the team's best start since 2012. Florida will face No. 6 LSU on Saturday.
