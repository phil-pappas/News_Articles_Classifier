Add in an own goal by Coe-Brown in the first minute that gave the Bobcats an unexpected early lead, and they were even more juiced. Behind a big first half, Oyster River carved out a 3-1 win Saturday over the Bears to close out the regular season. That means the Bobcats don't have to play again until next Saturday when they'll host a quarterfinal game. Lebanon losing last Wednesday opened the door for the Bobcats, who improved to 12-2 with their third straight win. \"We knew had to get a result,\" said Oyster River coach Charlie Crull, \"but we weren't hyper-focused on that. We were more focused on playing good soccer. You've got to be playing good soccer at this time of year, and we did that in spurts today.\" Oyster River led 3-0 at halftime, then withstood a furious comeback attempt by Coe-Brown in the second half. Griffin Luczek and KC Merritt scored in the first half for the Bobcats (12-2), and Jayson Cleveland countered for the Bears in the second. \"We knew we had to step it up and do something about it,\" Cleveland said. \"Any way possible.\" Coe-Brown had several chances to close the deficit even further in the second half, the best being a free kick by Cleveland from 20 yards that sailed just over the net with 13 minutes left and a save by OR keeper Liam Conrad on a dangerous throw-in by Ethan Barbeau with 10:25 remaining. Coe-Brown (10-5-1) dropped its last two games and is 2-4-1 in the last seven entering the tournament. The Bears will host a first-round game on Wednesday. \"The win's not there but it shows a lot of resilience heading into the playoffs,\" said Coe-Brown coach Christian Gompert. \"We needed that second half to uplift us and motivate us going into next Wednesday.\" Cleveland scored on a free kick from a tough angle in the 53rd minute to make it 3-1. But that was all the Bears could get past Conrad, who made five of his eight saves in the second half. The Bobcats received a gift just 37 seconds into the match when a ball served into the box by OR's Andy McQuade was inadvertently knocked into the net by a Coe-Brown defender. \"It's huge,\" Luczek said. \"It gives us momentum and the lead for the whole game.\" \"It can be very deflating,\" Gompert said. \"They got a lot of energy out of that. They came at us.\" Still leading 1-0, Oyster River nearly returned the favor later in the first half when Coe-Brown's Jake Dunkerley intercepted a poor goal kick and put a dangerous bid from point-blank range on Corbin LeBlanc (5 saves), who had to be alert. Less than four minutes later, Luczek made it 2-0 when he ran onto a ball from McQuade and beat Corbin to the short side. The senior co-captain nearly had another goal two minutes later, but Corbin turned aside Luczek's free kick from 25 yards. Luczek has six goals in the last three games, including a hat trick last Monday in a 4-0 win over Portsmouth. \"I don't think we played our best game today,\" he said, \"but we got a result.\" The Bobcats went up 3-0 on a goal by Merritt, a sophomore forward who finished a play that began with a long throw-in into the box. Senior midfielder Petter Sandvik almost padded the OR lead, but Corbin made a terrific diving save of a free kick from 22 yards. \"The first half was better than the second half,\" Sandvik said. \"The first half we played really good as a team. The second half something mental happened, and we let them come into the game.\" By Al Pike", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T06:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T19:45:45.474+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
