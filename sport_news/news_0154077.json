Lambert completed just 10 of 24 passes for 86 yards in a 38-10 loss to Alabama. Brice Ramsey also got some playing time, but he completed only one pass and had two interceptions. Richt said Sunday on a conference call that Lambert still has the job he won during fall practice after transferring from Virginia. The coach also confirmed that linebacker Reggie Carter is out for the season after undergoing shoulder surgery. He played in only one game this season. Receiver Isaiah McKenzie (left hamstring) and center Brandon Kublanow (sprained ankle) are questionable for Saturday's game against Tennessee. Georgia (4-1, 2-1 Southeastern Conference) plunged from eighth to No. 19 in the latest Associated Press rankings.
