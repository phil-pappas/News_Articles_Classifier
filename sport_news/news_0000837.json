Despite no wins, she's hanging around in the top 10.\n\"Pretty incredible for not winning a race,\" said DeJoria, who has five career wins, including three in 2014. \"We've tried some different things, different parts, to go faster. It's just my fourth year as a pro. So many things are new to me. I consider myself a very good driver.\n\"But in no way, shape or form, am I where I can be. I'm constantly evolving as a driver.\"\nShe's not your typical female Funny Car driver.\nDeJoria is a billionaire heiress, the daughter of John Paul DeJoria, who made his fortune with salon products and tequila. She's married to Jesse James, former reality TV series star and ex-husband to Sandra Bullock. DeJoria is transparent with her driving experience, chronicling her feelings on a blog at espnW.com. Her hobbies include snowboarding, riding dirt bikes and skydiving.\nDeJoria also has a philanthropic side. This month, her car is pink, in recognition of Breast Cancer Awareness month and to bring attention to her race team's program for free mammograms to female race fans, regardless of health insurance status.\n\"We wanted to do something active, something that was going to help -- not just wear pink things,\" she said.\nRealizing the cost of mammograms, she started working with the program three years ago at the NHRA Toyota Nationals in Las Vegas. She has partnered with Baylor Health Care Systems for a similar program at Ennis. Baylor officials will be at Texas Motorplex on Saturday and Sunday to ticketholders over the age of 40.\nIn Vegas, the mobile mammogram units parked at the end of the pit area.\n\"It was pretty profound,\" she said. \"Women were not just flying in for the race, but just to get that done.\"\nAs for this weekend on the track, DeJoria is looking forward to the weather at Ennis. The forecast calls for tempeatures in the low 80s this weekend. At the Keystone Nationals in Reading, Pa., in early October, the temperatures were mostly in the low 60s, which favors many drivers.\n\"Lately, we've been more consistent in the heat,\" she said. \"When it cools down, you're trying to find that gray area. You're either really fast and make a great run. Or you don't get down the track at all.\"\nDespite living in Central Texas for three years, DeJoria is still getting used to the Texas heat.\nWhile living in Venice, Calif., she visited her father, also an Austin resident, at least twice a year. \"I loved the mood, the music scene, the vibe and the people,\" she said.\nShe met her husband, a motorcycle enthusiast at a race in Austin, and they settled in on a 17-acre spread in Dripping Springs.\n\"I live literally and figuratively, a very fast-paced life,\" she said. \"So, it's nice to recharge, not be around around anyone and enjoy the family.\"\nTwitter: @tommycummings\nOn Twitter:\n @tommycummings", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/tommycummings"], "published": "2015-10-16T01:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T18:46:30.290+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
