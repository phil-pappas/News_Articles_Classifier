Alamosa, the No. 7 ranked Class 3A team in the state, stayed undefeated and swept the Wolverines 25-14, 25-18, 25-20. Jade Pascale, Brooke Kudelski and the Wolverines hung right in there with the tough Alamosa squad, and the Mean Moose had their hands full at the outset. Bayfield (5-7, 1-1 Intermountain League) jumped out to an early 6-2 lead and caught the home team off-guard. When they finally woke up, however, Alamosa’s girls (9-0, 3-0 IML) won the next eight points and ran away with the first set 25-14. Game two was a back-and-forth battle that saw Bayfield fight back to tie the set numerous times. Finally, Alamosa took a 15-14 lead, and Bayfield never caught them. Though game three was more of the same from the Mean Moose, Bayfield wouldn’t go down without a fight. The Wolverines overcame three match points and made Alamosa work hard for the final kill to keep its perfect record in tact. Bayfield’s next match is at 2:30 p.m. Saturday at Durango High School in a rematch of a five-set thriller that took place earlier this year in Bayfield. Durango came away with the victory in that match, and Bayfield will hope to turn the tables this time around.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T06:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T16:15:08.199+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
