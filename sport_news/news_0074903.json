VW in Europe and the United States declined comment.\nNO FURTHER PROVISIONS\nVolkswagen also declined comment on a report in weekly Welt am Sonntag, which said the car maker was not planning further provisions in the fourth quarter to cover the costs of the scandal.\n\"We will finish 2015 on the year-earlier level, there is no reason to scrap our outlook,\" the paper Quote: d an unnamed VW manager as saying.\nSeparately, daily Bild reported Chancellor Angela Merkel's office is looking into whether 6,000 Volkswagen temporary workers could be moved on to the government's \"Kurzarbeit\" short-time work programme.\nThe scheme allows companies to preserve jobs by reducing employees' hours when plant usage is low, with the government compensating workers for part of their lost wages.\nThe Federal Labour Office has ruled out the idea, already floated by Economy Minister Sigmar Gabriel, of including temporary workers in the plan, from which they would normally be excluded. But Berlin wants to be prepared for cost cuts at Volkswagen.\nA government spokesman could not immediately be reached for comment.\nWorks council head Bernd Osterloh had said earlier this month it was not yet clear whether the emissions scandal would affect jobs over the medium to long term. \"At this point, there are no consequences for jobs, neither for core workers nor for temporary staff,\" he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T17:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T21:16:25.348+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
