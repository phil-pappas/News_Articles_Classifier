Our intention is to make CDC's foodborne outbreak surveillance data easily accessible,\" according to a CDC news release.\nAn outbreak occurs when two or more people get the same illness after eating the same contaminated food. Many outbreaks occur if food is prepared or served by a food worker with improperly washed hands, the CDC says.\nThe redesigned CDC site contains data compiled on outbreaks caused by intestinal bacterial, viral, parasitic and chemical agents from 1998 to 2014.\nWhat if you get sick while eating someplace and want to know if there were contributing factors? For instance, was the food kept at room temperature for too long? Users can search by year, state, location of food preparation, or specific germ for answers to these and other questions.\nNew maps, interactive features, graphs and tables also allow outbreak searches by specific foods and ingredients. \"Quick stats\" are available, along with more in-depth information on numbers of illnesses, hospitalizations and deaths associated with these illnesses.\nIn the event of an outbreak, public health investigators can search for the foods and the germs associated with past outbreaks to help pinpoint possible contaminated food sources, the CDC said. Reporters and others can also use the database to understand recent or ongoing outbreaks of foodborne illness.\nMore information\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention offers their updated food safety site here ", "external_links": ["http://images.worldnow.com/Revenue/images/275529_G.jpg", "http://www.healthday.com/", "http://www.cdc.gov/foodsafety/outbreaks/index.html"], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T01:26:34.927+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
