There was a finding that Kwesi Nyantakyi should be investigated by the BNI for not accounting for 200,000 dollars that was paid by the state for the organization of a friendly match prior to the World Cup and that was the first time that I heard about that. \n'I think that to an extent some of the issues were taken for a joke, we were not looking beyond individuals; Kwesi Nyantakyi was looked at as an individual that must be crucified by all means and so some of the findings were personalized around him rather than the institution of football…and it is very unfortunate…of course if I did something wrong it must be pointed out but when you strenuously and deliberately try to find faults when none exists, it exposes you as a wicked person or someone embarking on a witch-hunting spree'. \ncredit: Starr FM", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T15:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T16:31:18.943+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
