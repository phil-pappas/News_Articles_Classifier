Line: Texas A&M by 7\nKEYS TO THE GAME\nMore bluster, or a breakthrough?\nThird-year Arkansas coach Bret Bielema has been easy to shoot spitballs at for two weeks running. He wondered aloud about the difficulty of Ohio State's schedule and verbally sparred with Texas Tech coach Kliff Kingsbury, all amid back-to-back losses. The Hogs had appeared to turn the corner at the end of last season with shut out wins over LSU and Ole Miss and a \"borderline erotic,\" as Bielema called it, win over Texas in the Texas Bowl. The Razorbacks need to recall some of that mojo.\nTrenchHogs vs. Sack-Happy Ags\nArkansas touts its 1,600-pound offensive line has the biggest around. And it's one of only five FBS teams to have not allowed a sack yet this season. On Saturday they meet the Aggies, who lead the FBS with 15 sacks. End Myles Garrett has an FBS-leading five and a half of them and is playing in his hometown. A&M also leads the FBS in tackles for loss (27).\nTake care of the ball!\nThe Aggies' turnover margin issues haven't caught up with them yet, but they don't want to keep taking that risk. A&M is already -2 in turnover margin for the season, losing the ball six times in three games (3 fumbles, 3 interceptions). In last week's win over Nevada, A&M lost a fumble near the Nevada goal line and an interception helped set up a Nevada field goal. The Aggies have gained four takeaways (2 fumbles, 2 interceptions).\nGetting it done in the red zone\nA&M is ninth in the SEC in red zone offense and Arkansas is 11th. The Aggies are 17-of-20 inside the 20, but that includes settling for four field goals and also losing a fumble. The Razorbacks are 9 of 14 in the red zone, also have a turnover and are just 5 of 14 in scoring touchdowns in the red zone.\nThe Razorbacks will win if ...\ndriven by back-to-back losses to Toledo and Texas Tech, they play better all-around, desperate to start anew as SEC play begins. Arkansas will need to get its ground game moving again behind running back Alex Collins. The Hogs take advantage of time of possession to help their defense against Texas A&M's sometimes potent offense.\nThe Aggies will win if ...\ntheir improved defense under new coordinator John Chavis holds up in its first SEC test, particularly against the run, A&M's biggest weakness a season ago. The offensive line gives quarterback Kyle Allen the room he needs to distribute the ball as he chooses.\nHOW THEY MATCH UP\nWhen Arkansas runs\nThe Hogs identity is still based on the run, even as they've tried to become more balanced. They rushed 43 times for 228 yards in the 35-24 loss to Texas Tech. Alex Collins carried 28 times for 170 yards. A&M's linebacking corps should be at full strength after an array of players missing time early, but are they ready for their biggest test yet? A&M has given up 161.7 rushing yards per game, 73rd in the FBS.\nWhen Arkansas passes\nSenior quarterback Brandon Allen has been efficient at times in going 62 of 92 for 916 yards, 6 touchdowns and two interceptions. But can he make big plays in the air when the pressure is on? He threw for 412 yards against Toledo, and Arkansas still lost, 16-12. He's missing receivers Keon Hatcher, Cody Hollister and Jared Cornelius to injury. Tight end Hunter Henry is a top target.\nWhen Texas A&M runs\nThe Aggies have made the commitment to run the ball more and better. Through three games, they've rushed 134 times for 681 yards (227 yards per game, 5.1 yards per rush). Senior Tra Carson (61 attempts, 292 yards, 2 TDs) has been asked to do most of the work with backup James White out with an undisclosed injury since the opener. They've delivered on the commitment but the execution can still improve.\nWhen Texas A&M passes\nKyle Allen has settled in, going 43 of 70 for 594 yards, nine touchdowns and two interceptions. He's got plenty of options, and can spread the ball around to Christian Kirk, Ricky Seals-Jones, Josh Reynolds and Speedy Noil. Arkansas couldn't force a single punt against a similar speedy offense against Texas Tech a week ago, though it did snag two interceptions. Arkansas has only one sack in three games and hasn't looked like the same unit that ranked in the top 10 in scoring and total defense last season.\nSpecial teams\nA&M's Speedy Noil and Christian Kirk cause opponents' big headaches on returns, with Kirk already returning a punt for a touchdown in the freshman's first collegiate game. Punter Drew Kaser is on pace to break the school career punting record. Arkansas kicker Cole Hedlund is 4 of 6 this season, missing a 37-yard attempt in the loss to Tech.\nIntangibles\nArkansas is 0-8 under Bret Bielema in games decided by less than 10 points. ...Arkansas hasn't won its SEC opener since 2010. ...Arkansas leads the SEC in third-down conversions (48.6 percent) and Texas A&M ranks third in third-down conversion defense (23.4 percent).\nPrediction\nTexas A&M 38, Arkansas 24: The Hogs make it close until late, but ultimately can't slow the Aggies, who break the game open on a couple of big plays.\nOn Twitter:\n @kHairopoulos", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/kHairopoulos"], "published": "2015-09-26T02:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T05:39:26.924+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
