GRAVES The Associated Press \nLouisville says it has launched an investigation into allegations that former Cardinals staffer Andre McGee paid an escort service to provide sex for recruits. \nThe allegations by Katina Powell are in an upcoming book from a publishing arm of the Indianapolis Business Journal. Some details of the book were published Friday on the Journal's web site and said that McGee hired Powell to provide strippers and prostitutes for recruits and some of their fathers during a four-year period. \nLouisville issued a statement Friday saying it learned of the allegations in August and immediately notified the NCAA. McGee left Louisville in 2014 to become an assistant at Missouri-Kansas City. The school and McGee could not be immediately reached for comment Friday afternoon. \n____", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T00:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T01:09:41.762+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
