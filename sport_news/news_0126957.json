The video uploaded on Tuesday shows the 43-year-old Liberal leader wearing a white desi kurta-pyjama and dupatta dancing to the tunes of Hadippa — the breakout theme song from the 2009 Bollywood film \"Dil Bole Hadippa\", Huffington Post Canada reported today. According to a party spokesperson, the footage of the Prime Minster doing the Punjabi dance was captured during an event organised by the India-Canada Association of Montreal in 2009. Trudeau is the son of the late Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, who swept to office in 1968 on a wave of support dubbed \"Trudeaumania.\" Trudeau served a total of four terms in the country's top office. His Liberal Party won a majority of Parliament's 338 seats in the elections held on Monday. More recently, Harper's wife Laureen showed off her own bhangra dance moves at a Conservative campaign event last week, the daily reported. The old bhangra video and Trudeau's youthfulness are attracting renewed interest in Canada after voters elected a majority Liberal government on Monday, unseating Harper's Conservative from nearly a decade in power. Indian-Canadians make up over three per cent of Canada's population of about 35 million and have become a significant political force. There were eight lawmakers of Indian-origin in Canada in 2011. — PTI", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T22:45:38.073+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
