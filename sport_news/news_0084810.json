I think so,\" Schweinsteiger said. \"The best strength here is the team spirit. But of course first of all we have to do our work.\n\"We lost the first match against PSV Eindhoven which was a pity. As the manager said we have to win our games at home.\"\nUnited will look to register their first win in Champions League Group B against Wolfsburg on Wednesday having lost their opening match away to PSV Eindhoven.\nSchweinsteiger, who joined United from Bayern in July, believes the Bundesliga side will find Old Trafford a difficult place to get a positive result.\n\"It's not easy to play here for the first time, especially in the Champions League,\" Schweinsteiger said.\n\"The supporters you can feel the power of them and it's good for us but we have to play well and that's the most important thing.\n\"When I came here the first time with Bayern Munich. We had it not so easy in the first 10 minutes so it was not easy but we changed the score at the end and got in the next round.\n\"It's a big stadium and a big honour to play here for United in that stadium especially in the Champions League.\"\nThe 31-year-old World Cup winner also revealed he has quickly adjusted to life at United and English football despite the differences with German football.\nHe added: \"The club and the people are friendly and of course of my team-mates made it easy for me.\n\"Of course I know the manager and the staff. Ok, no one really speaks German but that was not a problem for me.\n\"I am at an age where you can learn easily a new league and handle it. It was very easy. I feel very comfortable here and especially when I play at Old Trafford.\n\"I mean of course there is a difference to the Bundesliga but you also have a ball in the game. So if you can handle the ball you can handle the physicality of the Premier League.\n\"It's different because you have no winter break and a lot of matches. But to be honest I feel good because my body us working ok.\n\"I am looking forward to playing in all these matches. When you play here it's always a good atmosphere. It's a lot of fun to play football in the Premier League.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T17:14:01.960+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
