CWC took possession on their own 26-yard line after the opening kickoff. The first play was a handoff to Andrew Burnett who broke free up the middle for a 74-yard TD. Burnett added two more first half touchdowns on short runs which were set up by long completions from quarterback Jake Simon to Drew Lucas and Justice Stubblefield. Simon also added second quarter touchdown passes to Bryce Northcott and Lucas to give the Bulldogs a 34-0 lead at the break. The Bulldogs also scored on their first drive of the second half, this time on a highlight reel catch from Northcott. Burnett added a 52-yard third quarter touchdown run to complete the scoring for the Bulldogs before the JV players took over. The CWC defense also dominated on the night, maintaining a shutout while the first string was in the game. Several CWC records were set in the win. Junior Quarterback Jake Simon broke Chase Kittinger's school record for most passing yards in a game by throwing for 355 against the Foxes. Kittinger's prior record of 348 was set in 2005 at Elverado. Simon also broke his own school record with 26 completions in the game. His prior record was 23, set two weeks ago in Fairfield. In addition, Simon tied the school record for most attempts in a game at 36 (shared by Kittinger). Junior receiver Justice Stubblefield 11 catches was the most ever in a single game by a Bulldog player. The prior record of nine had been shared by Stubblefield and Nathan Hamilton. Stubblefield has also become the single-season leader for receptions with 41 (and has two weeks to go in the season). The prior record of 39 was set by Hamilton in 1998.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T07:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T09:34:15.793+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
