They had gotten drubbed earlier in the day and had been run ragged by a seemingly endless itinerary of events while serving as ambassadors for the NBA.\nThe thought of your own mattress, your own pillows, your own house – Blake Griffin and DeAndre Jordan had to have wanted to go home.\nBut, there was somewhere else they had to be.\nBleary-eyed and jet lagged, Griffin and Jordan got on a plane to Las Vegas.\nThe next day, Chris Paul followed.\nLamar Odom was in a hospital bed, fighting for his life, and his former teammates had to be there.\n“He probably has no idea we were there,” Griffin said. “But just to be there and to see him, hopefully he knows there’s a lot of guys that love him and want to see him do better, and want to see him get better.”\nIn 2012, the Clippers took a gamble on Odom, sending out Mo Williams in a multi-team trade to get the former Sixth Man of the Year back in a deal.\nHe was coming off a disastrous season in Dallas, which the cameras of his reality show, “Khloe & Lamar” captured.\nThe move to Dallas followed a summer filled with unthinkable tragedy. A day after attending the funeral for his 24-year-old cousin, a car Odom was riding in hit a motorcycle, which then went out of control, eventually killing a 15-year-old pedestrian.\nMonths later, his name was a part of the trade rumors connected to the nixed Paul-to-the-Lakers deal. He eventually landed with the Mavericks, but he never found a role amid sporadic production.\nHe didn’t finish the year with the team.\nStill, the Clippers wanted to take a chance on Odom, and he was thrilled to be back home. “Sometimes we go through things in life that hold us back. I put those things behind me,” Odom said after re-joining the Clippers. “It's time to move forward. It’s time to be fresh again.”\nIn between the smiles and the poses with his familiar Clipper uniform, Odom repeated what would eventually become a common refrain.\n“Hopefully, I can turn back the clock on the court,” Odom said.\n1 2 3 Next Page", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T07:23:36.761+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
