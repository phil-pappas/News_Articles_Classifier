They did not want to go to school and return to find no home.\n“They say, ‘Mama, why you say America is good? Why you say America is nice house?’” Farah said, pointing out the mold, rat holes and roaches.\nOne floor below, Osman Osman said he had the advantage of being able to look up his rights online.\nThe city of Seattle requires 60 days’ notice if a landlord is going to raise rents 10 percent or more. Osman said he first received notice of an increase of $82 from August to September, but the notice assumed he was paying an existing $575 a month instead of the $550 listed on his lease. The increase calculated on the mistaken baseline rent would have meant a 9.91 percent increase, just narrowly dodging the 60-day requirement.\nNow, his rent, like Farah’s, is $1,150 starting Oct. 1.\nOsman filed a complaint with the Seattle Department of Planning and Development in late August, about the living conditions. DPD told KIRO 7 they inspected one unit in September due to a complaint and required the landlord to make fixes.\nOsman said he then received a bill from the landlord for damages.\nAfraid he cannot come up with the new rent, he said, “I have to look for a friend of mine to share with. A place better than this, so I can survive. “\nA spokesperson for DPD said they are aware of the previous owner having a private inspector look at a different unit in July. That private inspector noted fixes that needed to be made and gave the building a “pass” under the Rental Registration and Inspection ordinance.\nDPD will be following up with that private inspector, as well as looking into the several other complaints they received in recent days.\nThe new company’s registered agent is Carl Haglund, who has many other real estate companies in the area. A lawsuit brought forth by a disabled tenant at a different location was recently settled for $60,000.\nThe city council is considering a few pieces of housing legislation designed to help in cases like this. Councilmembers Kshama Sawant and Nick Licata joined tenants Thursday to bring attention to their plight.\nWhile the current city law requiring relocation assistance only applies to landlords or owners who state intent to remodel or rebuild units, an owner could avoid that by raising rents first to encourage tenants to leave before remodeling. A revision to this ordinance is going through the council.\nAnother proposed ordinance would require owners of below-market units like this one to inform the city before putting the building up for sale. This allows the city time to work with non-profits on buying the building and preserving affordable units.\nA housing lawyer told KIRO 7 there would be nothing to stop a landlord from starting an eviction process. But tenants can argue in court that they do not owe the money due to unlivable conditions.", "external_links": ["http://w.sharethis.com/button/buttons.js"], "published": "2015-10-02T06:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T14:04:15.336+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
