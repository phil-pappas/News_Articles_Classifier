But it’s clear a 39-17 victory over the Saints on Sunday has Chip Kelly’s team feeling confident as it prepares to face the division leaders in prime time.\n“It’s a one-week season,” nose tackle Bernie Logan said. “We just have to go out here and dominate this game.”\nAnd this from Eagles safety Walter Thurmond on the prospect of playing against his former teammates: “I’m looking forward to playing this game. Anytime you have two teams that are so close in distance and competing and wanting to win the division and have great pride and great history in each organization, you want to play great and come out with the victory.”\nAnd finally, safety Malcolm Jenkins, who went beyond the X’s and O’s to sum up Monday night’s matchup: “We’re going to show up and see who can punch harder.”\nThurmond is on the other side of the rivalry, having spent an injury-shortened 2014 season with the Giants after Super Bowl success in Seattle. He tore a pectoral muscle in Week 2 last season, recording just two solo tackles in return for the one-year, $3.5 million deal to play cornerback.\nKelly signed the former Oregon Duck last March and moved him to safety, where he has thrived opposite Jenkins. He was also reunited with cornerback Byron Maxwell, a former Seahawk, who signed a six-year deal with $25 million guaranteed. Thurmond leads the team with three interceptions, offering the kind of impact the Giants had hope for. \n“I’m just making the most of the opportunities that have come my way and doing what I can to get some wins,” Thurmond said.\nStill, he admitted to being excited about matching wits with his former teammate and quarterback Eli Manning, whom he practiced against before missing the final 14 weeks of the season. \n“To know what the offense actually does and how Eli plays after seeing him every day in practice, I’m used to his ability to look off safeties and where he wants to go with the ball,” Thurmond said. That’s when he said, “I’m looking forward to playing this game.”\nWhy not? The Eagles (2-3) are coming off their best game of the season in beating the Saints. Kelly’s high-octane offense rolled up 519 total yards, while quarterback Sam Bradford easily played his best game, completing 32 of 45 with 333 yards, two touchdowns and two interceptions. DeMarco Murray led a 186-yard rushing attack with 83 yards, while Ryan Mathews added 73.\n“It felt like an offense that we’re used to being able to play,” offensive coordinator Pat Shurmur said. “Now we’ve just got to go back and recreate.”\nThe Eagles defense would like to re-create, too. Defensive end Fletcher Cox recorded three sacks and two forced fumbles, while Saints quarterback Drew Brees was sacked five times. \n“I think a few times I actually heard Brees cuss, so I know he was frustrated,” said Logan, who knows he must get to Manning, who has been sacked just four times all season.\n“He’s not a quarterback that’s going to sit there and hold the ball. When he sees an opening he’s going to take it, so we have to work our pass rush fast and get him out of the pocket.”\nJenkins discounts the notions the Giants have an edge in the division because they have the more decorated quarterback. \n“I don’t look at the Giants feel like they have an edge over us,” he insisted.\nDespite wins over the Jets and the Saints, the Eagles are 0-2 in the division and can’t afford a loss to the Giants (3-2). \n“You definitely get a little bit more juiced to play these games because you have to see them two times a year,” Jenkins said. “There’s not much you’re going to do to fool one another. “\nWe’ll see who can punch harder.\n  new york giants ,  philadelphia eagles ,  walter thurmond", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T00:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T08:20:03.282+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
