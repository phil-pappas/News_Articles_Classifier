We are planning a very special and exciting performance,” Hoch explained. “It will be a real thrill to have a chance to perform for the people of London.” \nIt’s the first time ever the band will travel internationally for a pregame show. \nBuckeye fans may have gotten a little taste last week of what’s to come during TBDBITL’s “British Invasion” themed show during halftime of the Penn State game. Watch all of the 2015 Ohio State Marching Band halftime performances \n“We are very excited to be bringing the Ohio State University to Wembley and can’t wait to see what they have in store for our fans,” said NFLUK Managing Director Alistair Kirkwood. “This will be very different to anything we have done at the International Series games before and we know that the band is planning something spectacular to celebrate and commemorate being in the UK.” \nThe NFL will cover all of the band’s travel costs for the London trip. Kickoff is scheduled for 9:30 a.m. eastern time. \nThe game will only be televised in the Buffalo and Jacksonville markets on CBS. However, for the first time ever, Yahoo! will stream the game for free to anyone with an Internet connection. \nHere’s what you can do to watch the game: Connect your device to the Internet.
