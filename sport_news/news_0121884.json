In 2015, they are just a Total Loss. \nWith a second straight home defeat, 3-2 to already-qualified Czech Republic, the Netherlands failed to reach the European Championship finals for the first time since 1984. And rubbing salt into that wound, neighbor and perennial rival Belgium moved top of the FIFA rankings and qualified as the Group B winner with a 3-1 victory over Israel. \n\"Let's be chauvinists today,\" Belgium captain Vincent Kompany said. \"The Dutch have crashed out and we're No. 1. Let's just be proud.\" While Belgium stars like Kevin De Bruyne and Eden Hazard are heading up, Dutch veterans like Robin van Persie, Arjen Robben and Wesley Sneijder are heading in the other direction. \nIn this topsy-turvy world, be assured of one thing — always count on Italy. With two goals late in the game, the Azzurri came from behind to beat Norway 2-1, and offer qualification on a plate to Croatia, which went through on a lone Ivan Perisic goal in Malta. The Scandinavians now face the playoffs. \nThere was no such hardship for third-place Turkey in the Netherlands' group. It beat Iceland 1-0 to take the automatic qualifying place for Euro 2016 as the best third-place finisher behind the Czech Republic and Iceland. \nJoining Norway in Sunday's playoff draw are Hungary, Ukraine, Denmark, Sweden, Ireland, Bosnia-Herzegovina and Slovenia. The two-legged series will be staged Nov. 12-14 and Nov. 15-17, with the four winners heading to France next year. \nGroup A \nThe Netherlands' elimination overshadowed all that happened in the group. \nDanny Blind's team slumped to possibly its worse defeat of a dismal qualification campaign on Tuesday, trailing the 10-man Czech Republic 3-0 in Amsterdam before two late goals provided a little consolation to fans who were already pouring out of the Amsterdam Arena. \nWith Selcuk Inan scoring the late winner in Turkey's 1-0 victory over Iceland, even a win for the Netherlands would not have earned a playoff berth. \n\"We have not been good enough,\" coach Danny Blind said. \nHapless defending was again the undoing of the Dutch as Pavel Kaderabek opened the scoring and Josef Sural doubled the Czechs' lead before the break. Even after Marek Suchy was sent off shortly before halftime and with Blind eventually opting for a five-man attack, the Dutch could only manage two strikes in the second half. Robin van Persie scored at both ends — his own goal giving the Czechs a three-goal cushion, before he netted his 50th international goal at the other end to make it 3-2 after Klaas-Jan Huntelaar's strike. \nIn the group's other match, Kazakhstan beat Latvia 1-0.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T19:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T08:15:27.825+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
