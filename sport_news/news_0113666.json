Millville had achieved 10 wins in a season just eight times in the program’s previous 22 years of existence. \nThe Thunderbolts’ success is all relative though. Compared with Lenape, their opponent in the opening round of the South Jersey Soccer Coaches Association Tournament last Friday, Millville is still earning its stripes. \nThe Indians, the tourney’s eight-time defending champions, toppled the Thunderbolts 2-0. Millville was making just its second-ever appearance in the event — the first coming last season. Millville girls soccer wins 11th straight over Vineland \n“I thought our girls really stepped up,” Sloan said. “Lenape scored early in the game, and I think it kind of took our girls by surprise again to step up to that level of play, but after they scored, we really turned it on, and we had some good scoring opportunities. They picked up the intensity. \n“Those teams are just used to playing intense soccer every game, every day of the week, and our girls aren’t quite used to that level of play all the time. It took a little time to get into it. We need to be prepared because in the Group IV playoffs, that’s what every team is going to be like.” \nLast year’s 1-0 loss to Eastern in the SJSCA tournament was a huge learning experience for the girls, and they used it to advance to the sectional quarterfinals, Sloan said. \n“We definitely need to take that next step,” he added. Millville girls soccer tops O.C. for 1st time since '11 \nIt won’t happen overnight, but invitations to the SJSCA tournament prove the Thunderbolts are on the right track. \n“It is very much an honor,” senior Amber Raines said. “I just think we’re all playing well and it’s showing. People are noticing us.” \nThat can be difficult in the Cape-Atlantic League. Millville was the only CAL school to make it to the event this season. \n“I think a lot of times we kind of get put on the back burner in South Jersey, but it’s nice to get recognized, obviously, and be able to go out and compete with some other top teams in South Jersey,” Sloan said. \nWhile the Thunderbolts aren’t quite at Lenape’s level yet, the recognition the team has received — from back-to-back SJSCA appearances to graduates Brandy Toso and Taylor Sergiacomi gaining All-South Jersey recognition last season — has only given the girls more belief. \n“It means a lot,” junior Abby Daigle said. “It kind of just proves to us that we work really well together, and it gives us confidence to finish the season strong.” \nDown one \nDelsea suffered a big loss during its 1-1 tie with Deptford on Oct. 7, as freshman forward Kayla Decesari broke her hip, ending her season. \nDecesari had a goal and nine assists and was a focal point of the Crusaders’ attack. \n“She was exploiting everyone’s back right side,” coach Misty Russo said. “It’s definitely an unfortunate loss. The other girls really have to pick it up.” Girls soccer notebook: Defense stands out for Schalick \nDelsea has managed to do that since Decesari’s injury, as the Crusaders have gone 2-1 over that stretch, including a huge 1-0 win over Deptford on Friday in which sophomore Cassidy McErlain scored her 13th goal of the season and senior Hannah Seabert made 10 saves for her fourth shutout. \n“It was a very important one because right now — knock on wood — we’re undefeated in the conference, and we have three conference games left, and I think if we win one of the three, we win it,” Russo said. \nThe Crusaders are at Penns Grove on Wednesday, Cumberland on Oct. 27 and host Schalick on Oct. 29. \nCorner kicks \nSchalick’s offense came alive last week as the Cougars scored seven goals combined in a pair of wins over Penns Grove (4-0 on Oct. 14) and Woodstown (3-0 on Friday). Schalick only had nine markers on the season entering the Penns Grove game. Mariana Heyel , Briana Peppitoni , Miranda Rodriguez and Grace Milone all found the back of the net for the first time this year. … Bridgeton won for the second time in four games on Friday, dropping Paulsboro 6-1. The Bulldogs, who started the season 1-8-1, got a hat trick from junior forward Sydney Angel , which gave her the team lead in goals at six. \nJosh’s Kickin’ Five* Millville (11-2) — Goalie Imani Gaines has stepped up of late, recording shutouts in three of the Thunderbolts’ past five games. Delsea (10-2-1) — The Crusaders suffered just their second loss of the season on Monday, a 4-1 setback to Pennsville. Vineland (4-9) — The Fighting Clan are 2-0 when freshman forward Gabby Perez finds the back of the net. The latest victory came on Monday, a 4-2 triumph over OLMA. She scored a pair in the win. OLMA (7-5) — The Villagers have alternated losses and wins over their past five games (2-3). Buena (8-6) — Aysiah Cintron and Gabrielle DeSousa have combined for 26 goals this season, more than Vineland, Bridgeton, Schalick and Cumberland have scored as a team. \n*Through Monday’s results \nJosh Friedman: (856) 563-5257; jfriedman2@gannettnj.com Area stats leaders", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T02:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T06:17:26.541+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
