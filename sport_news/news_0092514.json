Just days after being selected in the squad for the ODI series against South Africa, Mann smashed an unbeaten double hundred for Punjab in their Ranji opener against Railways (Group A) at the PCA Stadium in Mohali. By the end of the day, the hosts had piled up a mountain of runs (604/5) before declaring their first innings. Mann's unbeaten 201 runs came in just 205 balls with the help of 25 fours and five sixes. Punjab scored 339 runs on the second day. Wicketkeeper-batsman Gitansh Khera (102) also struck a century with the help of nine fours and a six. Before Mann scored the first double of the Ranji season, it was Uday Kaul (112) and Mandeep Singh (109) who had scored tons on a placid batting wicket. Skipper Yuvraj Singh (23) offered a simple return catch to Karn Sharma (1/115). Pacers Krishnakant Upadhhyay (0/121) and Ranjit Mali (1/149) bore the brunt of Mann's bat. The Mohali lad, playing his 29th innings off his 20th Ranji match, surpassed his earlier highest score of 157 against Karnataka at Hublee in the 2013-2014 season.
