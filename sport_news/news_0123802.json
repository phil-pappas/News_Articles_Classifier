So when the opportunity presented itself at White Oak on Friday night, the Eagles took full advantage of the opportunity they created for themselves. Coach Matthew Riggsbee’s team forced three crucial turnovers in the second half to change the momentum and come out with a 23-14 victory. “Our defense made the difference for us tonight forcing turnovers and playing well all night,” Riggsbee said. “We had two interceptions from Isaiah Yates, another from Sage Lilly, and a big fumble recovery from Justin Taylor. Anytime you get four turnovers you should win that game.” The Eagles play tough defense, but it was the triple option attack of WOHS coach Eric Leary and the Vikings who started the scoring with 3:11 left in the first quarter when running back Darrell Sephes took a speed sweep around the left side for an 11-yard touchdown run. The run for the two-point conversion failed. The Eagles answered on their ensuing drive with a touchdown drive capped off by running back Darious Abrams 2-yard plunge into the end zone with 11:40 left in the second quarter to give the Eagles a 7-6 lead. The Vikings then used a 34-yard pass from quarterback Morton Roop to senior Bobby Smith to set up shop inside the red zone. Smith ran for 113 yards before having to leave the game at halftime due to an undisclosed injury. Roop finished the drive with a 1-yard run on a quarterback sneak to give his team the lead 12-7. The Eagles were able to keep pace with some big plays in the passing game and some misdirection in the running game, driving the ball down to the 5-yard line before Abrams finished the drive with a touchdown run. The next Vikings drive stalled as time ran out in the half at the Eagles 18-yard line. “We felt good about the things we were doing,” Leary said. “We saw some things we felt like we could take advantage of and we were doing a pretty good job of that, but we just made a few too many mistakes. We took ourselves out of some good situations with penalties and we didn’t make enough plays to make up for that.” The opening drive of the second half came up short for the Eagles after a defensive stop by the Vikings, who took the ball over on downs at their own 6. But then the game began to unravel for the Vikings. A high snap on the Vikings punt attempt rolled out of the back of the end zone for a safety, giving the Eagles a 17-12 lead and the ball back on a free kick as a result of the safety. Page 2 of 2 - The Eagles used the extra possession to march right back down the field and finish this time with a touchdown run by senior Danny Harvey on an 8-yard run. Trailing 23-12 the Vikings went to the air to stay in the game, but the Eagles were ready, intercepting Roop on his final three pass attempts. “We had some penalties and made some mistakes that we try to preach and teach our kids against,” Riggsbee said. “We played hard, but we have to do a better job of playing hard and controlling our emotions.” The Eagles (8-1, 4-1) travel to Jacksonville next week while the Vikings(3-7,0-5) travel to Richlands (1-8, 0-4). “West Craven is a good team very fast and athletic,” Leary said. “We just didn’t have enough and it’s up to us to improve and keep getting better.” Leary said.
