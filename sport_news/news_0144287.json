Jeff Blashill will be motivated to the highest level and the locker room might react well to a fresh approach. Will they make it past the first round? Hey, Stanley Cup finalists have been bounced in the first round. But if they get there, I think the excitement will carry them to Round 2. \nStanley Cup finals: Lightning over Ducks in six. \nJeff Seidel: Yes \nJeff Blashill has won wherever he has coached, and this is a winning franchise with a winning culture. The veterans are already feeling rejuvenated under Blashill, but he will ride his young guns into the playoffs, the same players that gave this organization a Calder Cup. Blashill has a strong track record in one-and-done games, and that will propel the Wings past the first round. \nStanley Cup finals: Blackhawks over Lightning in six (again). \nDrew Sharp: No \nThe bigger streak lives on. But unfortunately for the organization, the smaller streak lives on as well. The Wings’ failure in getting past the second round is now six years old. It will be seven next spring. Worse, it will be three straight playoffs in which they failed to get out of the first round — and four times in five years. But at least they’re getting younger, right? \nStanley Cup finals: Blackhawks over Rangers in six. \nGeorge Sipple: Yes \nThe playoff streak didn’t begin with Mike Babcock. It’s not going to end just because he left town. New coach Jeff Blashill will guide the Wings into the second round, but the East has too many other good teams to expect a deeper run. \nStanley Cup finals: Ducks over Capitals in six. \nHelene St. James: Yes \nThis is a Wings team invigorated by two key veterans, a new coach, and motivated by two straight first-round exits. There is depth at every position, and a remarkable good opening night lineup considering Pavel Datsyuk is missing. The Wings have the elements to contend with anyone, so that one-and-done trend should end. \nStanley Cup finals: Ducks over Penguins in six.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T05:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T05:52:20.062+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
