It's the first game of the season, and we're just going to keep it simple.\" \nBeating Bemidji State, however, won't be an easy task. \n\"They're a tough, hard-working team,\" junior forward Dominic Toninato said. \"They're always going, they play physical, they play well defensively, and they get pucks deep. We've got to be ready to go from the drop of the puck.\" \nThe season-opening series is a home-and-home format for UMD, with Friday's game being played at AMSOIL Arena before the series shifts to Bemidji, Minn. for Saturday. \nFriday's game is scheduled for a 7:07 p.m. start and can be seen in the Northland on the My 9 Sports Network.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T02:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T10:39:09.176+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
