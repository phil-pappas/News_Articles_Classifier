Erdogan and other officials on Saturday opened a valve allowing water to flow through the 107-kilometer (66.5-mile) pipeline at a ceremony at the Mediterranean town of Anamur, before attending a second ceremony in Cyprus marking the water's arrival. Turkey says the water - aimed to meet the north's irrigation and drinking water needs for the next half century - could be shared with the Greek Cypriots once the island is reunified. Greek Cypriots have decried project as a Turkish ploy to further strengthen its grip on the islands north. Cyprus has been divided since 1974.
