(The Florida Times-Union, Will Dickey) \nIt was 12 minutes that Devinn Waters and the Mandarin football team will never forget, and 12 minutes that Sandalwood can’t forget soon enough. \nThe Mustangs took control of the district race with a savage second half of football on Friday night, blistering host Sandalwood 52-29. The win pushes Mandarin (7-0, 2-0 in District 1-8A) into sole possession of the top spot and an inside track to its first district title since 2004. How the Mustangs got there was a 12-minute span unlike any other coach Brian Braddock had been apart of. \nWaters scored on an interception return and added a back-breaking punt return for a score. There was a fourth-down touchdown pass. Then a field goal and a muffed punt that set up a short scoring run. \nBy the time Mandarin was done with a 31-point third quarter, doled out, ironically, at Sandalwood’s Woodshed, the Saints (6-2, 2-1) were already looking ahead at the other route to the state playoffs, likely as the district runner-up, barring an upset or two. \n“You can say all you want, but until it’s been done, you don’t know if you’re going to do it,” Braddock said of playing from behind in a high-intensity district game. “What do you say? That’s overrated. They did it.” \nMandarin was outplayed on both sides of the ball for most of the first 24 minutes, the exception being Waters’ first interception late in the half. But what happened over a 1 minute and 42 second span to open the third quarter erased every bit of momentum Sandalwood had going for it. \nThe Mustangs got a 17-yard touchdown pass from Tyler Greenlee to Aaron Adams on fourth-and-8 and blew things open from there. Waters picked off Eli Peters’ first pass of Sandalwood’s drive and took it back 35 yards for a score. And when the Saints were held to a three-and-out on their next drive and forced to punt, guess who was there again? \n“It was just so open, I just had to take it. I had no other choice,” Waters said. “I felt like it was a play that could change the game.” \nIt did, in a hurry. \nWith the ball curling toward the Mustangs’ side of the field, Waters came charging down the sideline and jumped up to pull the ball out of the air. Instead of falling down on it inside the 30, Waters was off, twisting in and out of traffic before diving to get the ball past the goal line. \n“I’m screaming, ‘poison, poison, poison’ on the sideline,” Braddock said. “To run over there and catch the ball the way he did, and then go score with it, is incredible. That’s one of the most incredible plays I’ve ever seen. That play was incredible. That changed everything.” \nAnd everything changed for the Saints, who saw a 21-7 lead evaporate in the span of 102 seconds. Sandalwood tried to counter, but was stopped on fourth-and-2 from its own 31, a mistake that resulted in a 28-yard Sinan Kantarevic field goal. The next series ended on a bad snap to the punter, a drive that gave Mandarin possession at the Sandalwood 8 and ended with Aundre Kearney’s 1-yard plunge. \n“The second half, to be honest, I couldn’t tell you what happened,” said Saints running back Logan Wright, who rushed for 145 yards and a touchdown on 25 carries. “Mental mistakes, really mental breakdowns. But we’ll get it fixed. All we’ve got to do is beat DeLand, and we’re back in business.” \nPeters rushed for three short-yardage touchdowns and was 16-of-32 passing for 229 yards, almost all of that coming in the first half. Mekhi Jackson rushed for 102 yards for Mandarin, and Greenlee was 13 of 25 passing for 184 yards. \nJustin Barney: (904) 359-4248", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T07:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T18:44:37.123+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
