But I thought we had some great chances in the second overtime.” \nWashburn (3-6-3, 2-3-1 MIAA) led 1-0 at halftime after Emily Stauffer scored on a penalty kick at the 19:30 mark. \nWU goalkeeper Kaitlin Minnich helped preserve the lead in the first half, recording four saves. Minnich kicked away a golden opportunity on a breakaway attempt for the Bearcats in the first half. \n“She was super big for us,” Jones said. “She saved us a couple times, for sure on that one-on-one situation.” \nNorthwest evened the score after Anna Holden put a foot on a loose ball at the 55:18 mark after a free kick was sent in from about 50 yards out. \nWashburn put up 20 shots and had nine shots on goal while Northwest had 14 shots with six on goal. \n“We hit the post a couple times, and the keeper (Elizabeth Lee) made some tough saves,” Jones said. “Overall, I was pretty happy with the result. I’m not happy we tied; I thought we could have won the game. But that’s just how soccer goes.” \nThe Ichabods finished the weekend 1-0-1, picking up a 1-0 win over Missouri Western on Friday night. \n“It’s the first time in a long time we’ve gone undefeated for a whole weekend,” Jones said. “We kind of feel good about that and will take the positive away from that. We didn’t play, necessarily, the greatest, but we didn’t play that bad. There’s a lot of positives to be taken away from today. We just have to keep building and keep getting better.” \nWashburn will begin a five-game road swing at Missouri Southern on Thursday. \nWASHBURN 1, NORTHWEST MISSOURI 1, 2 OT \nNorthwest Missouri 0 1 0 0 – 1 \nWashburn 1 0 0 0 – 1 \nNorthwest Missouri – Goal: Holden. \nRecords – Northwest Missouri: 2-6-3, 1-4-1 MIAA; Washburn 3-6-3, 2-3-1. \nRick Jr. Peterson can be reached at (785) 295-1290 or rick.peterson.jr@cjonline.com .Follow Rick Jr. on Twitter @RickiePeterson .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T01:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T04:39:39.497+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
