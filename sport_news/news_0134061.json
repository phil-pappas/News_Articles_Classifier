(Clare Becker — The Evening Sun) \nThe Biglerville High School soccer team took the field Thursday night. \nThis time, though, each player was holding a yellow carnation as they gathered in the center. \nThe flowers were a tribute to Meghan McKinney, a 23-year-old Biglerville alum, who died last week in a five-vehicle crash on Interstate 283. \nPlayers, coaches and members of McKinney's family held hands in a circle for a moment of silence. \nDanielle Cramer, head soccer coach at Biglerville High School, organized the tribute Thursday night before the soccer game. \nShe coached McKinney all four years, she said, and they still kept in touch. \n\"We had plans for the Friday after she passed,\" Cramer said. \nMcKinney, a Biglerville native, was big on sports, playing not only soccer, but field hockey and basketball, said her mother, Kim Killen. \nBut she was more than an athlete. She had a dream of owning an animal rescue. \nMcKinney worked at an Adams County pet store and took care of the dogs as if they were her own, Killen said. \nKillen found an old memory card from her daughter's camera with pictures of mission trips she took to India and the Dominican Republic. \n\"All I saw were photos of stray dogs,\" she said. \"She just wanted to save them all.\" \nOne of McKinney's friends from high school, Alysia Fair, said McKinney was a dog whisperer. \n\"My dog hated everybody but her,\" Fair said. Advertisement \nMcKinney also developed a love for nursing after graduating with an athletic training degree from Slippery Rock University in 2014. \nThis August, McKinney started a 16-month nursing degree program at Penn State Harrisburg, Killen said. She would have graduated in December 2016. \n\"She just got her stethoscopes a couple weeks ago,\" her mother said. \"She was excited to start her career; she was taking my blood pressure and everything.\" \nMcKinney was on her way to school the day of the crash, Killen said. Meghan McKinney's mother, Kim Killen, forms a circle on the field with loved ones and Biglerville staff and students during a moment of silence in remembrance of her daughter, Meghan McKinney, on Oct. 8. (Clare Becker — The Evening Sun) \nIt involved a pickup truck with a camper trailer, a commercial tractor-trailer and three other vehicles, including a Ford Escape driven by McKinney, according to a release from Pennsylvania State Police. The crash occurred on Interstate 283 in Lower Swatara Township, police said. \nKillen is thankful for the GoFundMe fundraising site that was started in honor of her daughter, but says she isn't taking a dime. \n\"That money will be given to animal rescues,\" she said. \"It's what Meghan would want.\" \nMcKinney left an impact on many people, including her eighth-grade math teacher at Upper Adams Middle School, Stephanie Staub. \nThe bond they formed left McKinney to visit her once a week, if not every day, while in school, she said. \nBut the visits continued even after McKinney left for college, stopping by whenever she came home. \n\"I have two boys, and she was kind of like my girl,\" Staub said. \"We were able to talk, joke, cry and laugh together.\" \nStaub could've been angry about something, but when McKinney walked in with \"one of the best smiles,\" she would feel better. \nStaub also remembers McKinney for her big bear hugs. \n\"I cherish the relationship we had. It was a privilege and an honor to have been part of her life,\" Staub said. \"She's one of those kids you'll never, ever forget.\" \nThe tribute Thursday ended with those on the field coming in for a sportsman-like cheer to start the game. \nAnd as hands raised on the count of three, the players shouted Meghan's name.
