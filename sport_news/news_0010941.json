By all accounts, 26-year-old Christopher Harper-Mercer relished the damage he inflicted on a teacher and classmates who never did him harm.\nThe ensuing madness, however, was a predictable stampede toward the assigned marks on a bloody stage and speaking parts in the latest campus tragedy.\nSome of those theatrics were simply misguided. Take the odd couples waving fitted sheets at a Roseburg church Saturday to block reporters' view of mourners leaving the memorial service for freshman Quinn Cooper.\nWas that sideshow somehow less distracting than the vigil of the six reporters across the street from the church?\nBut much of the fallout was just plain ugly, more pent-up anger in a perpetually depressed town:\nThe anti-Obama circus when the president arrived last Friday to console and embrace the survivors and their families at Roseburg High School.\nThe callous souls who flashed side arms in the wake of the massacre.\nThe Second Amendment scholars who play the victim each time a mass shooting prompts questions about risk and safety in a nation of 270 million guns .\nWhat is it about a gun that encourages this disconnect, this maddening illusion that we are only safe when – as Laurel Harper, the shooter's mother, wrote three years ago – the Glock case is full and the mags loaded?\nSafe where? Which college campus? Which movie theater? Which shopping mall?\nNine people were killed and nine others wounded in room 15 of Snyder Hall. I don't think any of us can grasp what it was like to confront the madness of that morning.\nTracy Heu, one of the survivors, remembers lying face down among her dead and dying classmates.\n\"The only thing I could think of was: Just be calm,\" the nursing student told the New York Times . \"Try not to make your chest go up and down so high. Because he's going to realize that you're still alive and he's going to make you stand up.\n\"And you stand up – that's it.\"\nIn the months to come, we will learn, once again, how a school, a community, and the wounded endure such a devastating rampage.\nYou don't move on. The parents who lost children in the slaughters at Columbine, Sandy Hook Elementary School and Virginia Tech have made that clear.\nYou can't close the hole in the remains of your life, says Peter Read , whose 19-year-old daughter, Mary, died in her French class at Virginia Tech in 2007: \"You can go forward, but you cannot move on.\"\nBut you can reassess what is necessary, other than the therapy of concealed carry, to make others safe as they wind their way through school.\nWe can ask whether the politicians are more focused on campus security or job security.\nWe can debate thoughtfully on how we might prepare for what we can't prevent.\nAnd we can dedicate ourselves to the part we each must play to rein in this recurring madness.\n-- Steve Duin\nsduin@oregonian.com\n503-221-8597; @SteveDuin", "external_links": ["http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/11/us/oregon-killings-amplify-crusade-of-virginia-tech-victims-father.html", "http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/special/nation/gun-homicides-ownership/table/", "http://newsbusters.org/blogs/nb/matthew-balan/2015/10/09/networks-hype-potential-nightmare-well-armed-anti-obama-protesters", "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/06/us/mother-of-oregon-gunman-wrote-of-keeping-firearms.html", "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/10/us/roseburg-oregon-shooting-christopher-harper-mercer.html?_r=0"], "published": "2015-10-14T01:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T06:15:11.487+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
