(AP) - North Carolina linebacker Joe Jackson has decided to stop playing football because of a neck injury. \nThe junior from Jacksonville, Florida, was injured in the opener against South Carolina. In a statement from the school Thursday, Jackson said he had consulted with his family and doctors to make what he called “a difficult decision” to stop playing football. \nJackson entered the season listed as the starting weakside linebacker and had four tackles in the opener. He played in eight games as a reserve last year. \nThe school also said redshirt freshman safety Cameron Albright would miss the rest of the season after having microfracture surgery on his right knee earlier this month. \nNorth Carolina (3-1) is at Georgia Tech on Saturday. \nCopyright © 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T02:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T03:33:03.501+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
