She declined to provide details.\nThe Providence Journal reports that LeBlanc’s name no longer appears on the football roster.\nIt’s unclear what led to the fight.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T00:03:58.734+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
