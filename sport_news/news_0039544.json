About 20 minutes before kick-off they went out on to the pitch and lined up to meet and welcome the teams. They then took their pitch-side seats, which were undoubtably the best in the ground, to help the game run smoothly and hopefully do their bit to help the Saddlers top the league. \nThe atmosphere around all four sides of the ground was fantastic from the beginning. \nThis was a real afternoon to remember with all of the 54 boys having a story to tell about something they heard or saw from their pitch-side seats. They were all buzzing at the end and are thrilled to have done their bit to help Dean Smith’s men reach the summint of League One. What do you think? Be the first to comment \nA signed Walsall ball and complimentary tickets were awarded to Reis Ballantyne-Bailey from Landywood School for showing a stand-out effort in training and marking his first time as a Walsall ballboy. \nMany of the children will return to Walsall in December to do the same job again when Walsall play Port Vale.
