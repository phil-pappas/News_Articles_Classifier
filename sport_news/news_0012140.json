The NFL told The Associated Press that it requested Twitter “disable links to more than a dozen pirated NFL game videos and highlights that violate the NFL’s copyright,” adding that it did not request that any Twitter accounts be disabled. The NFL sent 18 Digital Millennium Copyright Act notices regarding the Gawker-owned Deadspin account, said Gawker social media strategist Terron Moore via Twitter. Both suspended accounts regularly use GIFs of highlights from sporting events, including NFL games. The SB Nation account that was suspended, @SBNationGIF, specializes in such highlights. The main Deadspin account was down for roughly an hour before being re-activated around 8 p.m. EDT, while @SBNationGIF was still suspended.
