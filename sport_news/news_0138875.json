They let him go on about girlfriends and guns and posted video of it on DallasCowboys.com because who [expletive bleeped] cares? Women won’t see it.”\n Watch the entire segment above.\nIn his first media availability following his return from a four-game suspension stemming from a domestic violence arrest in 2014 , Hardy said he hoped to “ come out guns blazing ” against the Patriots on Sunday. He also referenced Gisele when asked about facing Brady.\n“I love seeing Tom Brady,” Hardy said Tuesday, via the Dallas Morning News . “He’s cool as crap. You seen his wife? I hope she comes to the game. I hope her sister comes to the game. [I hope] all her friends come to the game.”\nHardy was accused of choking his ex-girlfriend and throwing her onto a futon that had multiple firearms on it in May 2014. A judge in North Carolina found Hardy guilty in July 2014 of assaulting a female and communicating threats, but prosecutors later dismissed the charges in February 2015, before an appeal, when the ex-girlfriend did not make herself available to testify.\n2015 Patriots Schedule\nPrevious -- of -- Next Week 1: vs. Steelers, Thursday, September 10th, 8:30 p.m., NBC Globe Staff/Matthew J.
