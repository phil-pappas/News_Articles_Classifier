(AP) -- Desmond Morgan had nine tackles and an interception, part of a dominating defensive performance by No. 22 Michigan in a 28-0 rout of Maryland on Saturday. In winning its first Big Ten opener under Jim Harbaugh, Michigan (4-1, 1-0) picked off three passes and limited Maryland to 105 yards. It was the second straight shutout for the Wolverines, who have allowed a total of 14 points in their last four games. Morgan, a senior inside linebacker, picked off a pass in the first quarter and was a major reason why the Terrapins (2-3, 0-1) finished with 29 yards rushing after averaging 196 over their first four games. Michigan led by only 6-0 at halftime before pulling away with two third-quarter touchdowns. After Jake Rudock connected with Drake Johnson for a 31-yard score, wide receiver Jehu Chesson took an inside handoff and sprinted down the left sideline for a 66-yard TD. That made it 21-0, a deficit way too formidable for Maryland to overcome. \nCopyright Associated Press 2015.
