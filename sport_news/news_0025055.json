The residents invited Anup Kumar, one of the key members of Indian Kabaddi team, to kickstart the drive. \"We have initiated the festive season by conducting a cleanliness drive. If people clean their homes before the festive season, they should clean their surroundings too. We have also made an announcement to the residents to refrain from using crackers in order to reduce pollution and waste in the society,\" said Alka, former RWA president of Malibu Towne.\nAll condominiums in DLF 5 have also pledged to go green. \"Go green has been the theme in our society for the festive season for last three years. It is good that laser shows are organised instead of fireworks or effigy burning. As no paper is used, there is no trash,\" said Sagar Vinod, a resident of Princeton, a condominium in DLF 5.\nInterestingly, children from the societies are also enthusiastic about the go-green campaign. \"No crackers means no trash on the streets and no air pollution. Besides, this will discourage manufacturers to involve children in the production of crackers,\" said Antrisk Mehta, a 13-year-old resident of The World Spa, a condominium in South City I.\nMany societies have also given up the practice of effigy burning on Dusshehra. \"Every year, children get an opportunity to watch a spectacular laser Ravana show. There is no fire or smoke and thus it is safe for children as well as the environment. We are glad that other societies are also following the same,\" said a resident of Magnolias, a condominium on Golf Course Road.\nStay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device.", "external_links": ["https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.toi.reader.activities"], "published": "2015-10-19T11:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T01:49:28.952+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
