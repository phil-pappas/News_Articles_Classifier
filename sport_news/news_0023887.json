And yes, there he was, celebrating another win against the Browns. \nLittle about the past had anything to do with the latest heartbreak on the lakefront, however. This one was firmly rooted in the current, latest ineptitude that remains the Browns. \nPeyton Manning moved to 7-0 against them, and Denver to 4-0 in overtime against them, with a 26-23 win that should have never happened. Manning had three interceptions and a 53.3 quarterback rating. That would spell doom against most NFL teams. But the Browns again snatched defeat from the jaws of victory by, among other things: Going for two points instead of a near sure PAT kick with a 20-16 lead. I can see the arguments of going for 2, but it's over-thinking things. If they kick the extra point, they avoid overtime, where they would surely lose, and win 24-23. Immediately giving up a 75-yard TD pass, Denver's first offensive touchdown in 27 possessions, after taking their first lead in the fourth quarter. Getting burned was one of Ray Farmer's free agent signings, Tramon Williams. Over-thinking things on defense. Manning smartly took advantage of their constantly shuttling people in and out with a couple of quick snaps. Getting what should have been a game-winning interception in overtime from Barkevius Mingo at the Denver 39, and instead turning it into disaster by losing 18 yards on three plays. Getting in position for what could have been a game-winning TD, and instead basically settling for a tying field goal, based on the play calling. The real Josh McCown falling back to earth, as expected, with two bone-headed interceptions and one coming all the way back for a touchdown. Again allowing another 100-yard rusher (Ronnie Hillman had 111). \nThis was a day where the Browns' defense showed up for the first time this season. A lot of Hillman's yards came against a tiring defense on the final drive. The linebackers were splendid, Karlos Dansby picking off Manning twice and returning one for a touchdown where he tight-roped the sideline. 2014 draft pick Christian Kirksey made a couple of nice tackles in space, forcing Denver to settle for field goals. \nTravis Benjamin caught nine passes for 107 yards and continues to be a threat on punt returns. Gary Barnidge has been amazing and is a red zone nightmare for defenses. But like Peyton Manning being Peyton Manning â€” albeit a 39-year-old with diminishing skills - Josh McCown is still Josh McCown. \nAt some point, they're just going to have to give Johnny Football a try and see what he can do. And establish a running game. Robert Turbin appears to be a nice addition. But there's never anything consistent, and the quarterbacks and receiving corps aren't good enough to rely on like they have been. Especially against defenses as good as Denver's. \nThe Broncos might be a shaky 6-0, but they're 6-0 by knowing how to win close games and doing the little things. The Browns might be better than 2-4, but they're 2-4 by finding ways to lose close games, and not taking care of the little things. It's their trademark. \nSince its \"return\" in 1999, Cleveland has lost 42 times in the final minute of a game, or in overtime. Sunday was the 21st time during that span the Browns lost on the final play of the game. \nWith head-scratching draft picks, free agent signings, in-game decisions and general cluelessness, the current regime has done little to inspire any confidence among an embattled, yet loyal fan base. And the team continues to bank on that loyalty. It's almost like, \"hey, even if we're bad or mediocre, they'll still keep coming.\" At some point, maybe they won't. \nMaybe I should follow the philosophy of friend Jim Rudloff, who tweeted: \"Always toying with emotions. I refused to watch. Didn't want to ruin a great day.\" \ndweidig@newarkadvocate.com.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T13:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T20:37:38.745+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
