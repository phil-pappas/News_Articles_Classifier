Friday's open practice \nThe Jazz host their traditional open scrimmage Friday, Oct. 16, this year, with doors opening at 5:30 p.m. for a 6:30 p.m. start. No tickets are necessary, anyone is free to attend. \nBut this year's event has a new wrinkle: It's being described as an open practice, not just an open scrimmage. I asked Quin Snyder about what he plans on showing the fans. \n\"We're going to do a few things that we would normally do in a practice, and then we're going to scrimmage. So there may be some different situations. We'll probably play a scrimmage with small ball, so to speak. And we'll work on a few things, a few situations, a 2-for-1, a late game situation, things that we need to work on in practice and haven't had a chance to. It'll also be good for us to work on those things in front of people.\" \nThis is one of my favorite events of the year. Before becoming a media member, I used to line up early so I could get to sit in the front rows for Jazz action for free. Friday night is your chance to do the same. This week of practice is being called a 'second training camp' \nJazz swingman Joe Ingles summed it up: \n\"Obviously, we've gone to Hawaii, it wasn't a typical training camp. We trained for a couple days, then left for eight or nine days, and then we've kind of had a second training camp with having this week here. It's been good.\" \nThat may explain some of the lack of offensive execution we saw from the Jazz against Phoenix and Portland: They've only had a few days of practice, whereas their opponents had an additional week or so. We'll see if that excuse is a valid one Sunday, when the Jazz take on Portland again. It should be easy to notice any improvements. \nMeanwhile, Ingles said that the Jazz are coming along with the new parts of the offense that Snyder is introducing this year. \n\"The guys who were here last year have picked it up pretty easily, and we're just trying to help the other guys get up to that speed.\" Neto or Hood starting? \nSnyder, understandably, still doesn't want to commit to a starting lineup. I don't think he's even really decided on his ideal starters at this point. But he's hinted at some of what he's thinking about when making the decision: \n\"We may have guys coming off the bench that (become) our leading scorer. We may hide some youth in the starting lineup, where there's more support.\" \nEarlier in training camp, Snyder essentially admitted that he'll be starting Gordon Hayward, Derrick Favors and Rudy Gobert at the frontcourt spots, those being, overwhelmingly, the best choices at those positions. But the backcourt is still up in the air. \nWhile everyone on the Jazz is young, the \"youth\" on the Jazz that Quin's referring to has to be a fairly new player. That, to me, points to Raul Neto or Rodney Hood starting over their more established counterparts Trey Burke and Alec Burks. \nEssentially, don't be surprised if the Jazz don't start the \"Killer B's,\" Burke and Burks, in the backcourt this season. Grant Jerrett waived \nGrant Jerrett never really felt like a part of the roster. Jazz fans had barely seen him in action, and he hurt his shoulder in the first game of the Jazz's summer league. \nEven in the limited action we did see, Jerrett didn't look brilliant. He seems like a guy who works on paper: he's allegedly a good 3-point shooter, and he has decent length and athleticism for someone his size. But I've yet to see him make a positive contribution in the NBA. \nThat lack of impact meant that the Jazz had no problem waiving him Thursday, despite his guaranteed contract. In short, they'd rather use his roster spot on someone else, even though they'll have to pay that someone else and still pay Jerrett the $947,276 he's owed. \nNow, Chris Johnson, Jeff Withey, Bryce Cotton, Treveon Graham and Elijah Millsap will fight for the remaining three spots. My money's on Millsap, Withey and Cotton. Trevor Booker on his mask \nTrevor Booker is wearing a protective mask during gameplay after breaking his nose in a scrimmage in the Jazz's optional workouts before the season started, but he's not a fan of the situation. \n\"I'm ready to get out of this mask,\" Booker said. \nIt's slated to come off in time for the first regular season game, but in the meantime, Booker hates playing in it. \n\"If I look up, I can't see, if I look sideways, it's hard to see,\" Booker said. \"It's tough.\" \nWhen asked about NBA players LeBron James and Rip Hamilton who have successfully worn a mask, Booker said, \"LeBron isn't human anyway. I don't see why anyone would want to wear a mask for a whole season. And I don't see how Rip did it.\" Other notes: \nDante Exum's doing well, even walking around the Zions Bank Basketball Center without a noticeable limp. That's a great sign for someone who underwent ACL surgery on Sept. 3. According to Ingles, he's in good spirits. Former Chicago Bulls coach Tom Thibodeau was again at Jazz practice Thursday. He's not really acting like an assistant coach would, working with individual players, but just having conversations with coaches and players. Again, it's cool to see him around.
