The event has become a celebration of four local agencies joining forces for a day of community celebration and a continued evolution from the Great Pumpkin Day, which had been targeted more toward children, but was phased out in 2013.\n\"We went from it being a preschool and young children event to now something that appeals to all ages,\" said Glencoe Park District spokeswoman Erin Maassen.\nThus, Harvest Day was created and the litany of events includes a 5K race in the morning, kid-friendly options in the mid-afternoon and food, beverages – including wine and beer – and music blaring in the late afternoon at the Taste of Glencoe. Festivities are the culmination of collaboration by the Glencoe Park District, the Glencoe Educational Foundation, Glencoe Youth Services and the Glencoe Junior High Project.\n\"It's not to generate money,\" said Stacy Pritsker of the Glencoe Junior High Project. \"It is to generate relationships and celebrate.\"\nNina Spiliopoulos, who has lived in the village for 2 &frac12; years, was sitting on a bench with a friend and liked what she saw.\n\"I wanted to sample the tastings of the new restaurants and it is always good to get the kids out,\" she said. \"Some events are targeted for grammar school kids; this is more inclusive.\"\nThen there was the perspective of Diana Hakenen, who had been coming to the event for four years and also enjoyed the transformation.\n\"It's more festive,\" Hakenen said. \"Before it was for families with little kids, now it is for the whole community. Because of that, people who have the booths will have more visibility.\"\nWhile children are no longer the primary focus the focus, there was still plenty to keep them occupied. There was a makeshift pumpkin patch, plus haystacks, bubbles and a DJ to keep everyone involved in a safe environment.\n\"It's a good chance to bring the kids out here,\" said Glencoe resident Tom Bauer. \"The games give them something to do and everything is fenced in and that is not to keep the rabbits out.\"\nHowever, the day did not come without some challenges, as the iconic gazebo at Kalk Park has been fenced off due to deterioration. In addition, the cold, blustery conditions accompanied by some drizzle meant tents and bounce houses were not in place, deemed too dangerous. Plus, the event was supposed to run until 8 p.m., but it wound up concluding at about 5:30, according to Maassen, because of the poor conditions.\nWhile the hours may have been shorter than planned, the people still came by with some out-of-towners impressed with the fall party Glencoe is now hosting.\n\"We wanted to come down for the day to do some window shopping,\" said Katie May of Lake Forest, who arrived with her husband and 1-year-old daughter. \"It's very cute and family friendly.\"\nDaniel I.
