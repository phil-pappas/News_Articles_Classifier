Here are some highlights of his interview:\nOn what a defense needs to do to keep the team in the game:\n\"You've got to be able to hold serve do it [be efficient on offense] as well. I reflect back often, I said it on my radio show today, I reflected back to the bowl game with Michigan State and Baylor. Michigan State comes in [with] one of the top defenses in America and gave up 600 yards of passing to Baylor, but still won 42-41. They had theirs as well. It's challenging. You've gotta hold serve and you've gotta find ways to win as a team.\"\nOn not looking ahead to Texas:\n\"West Virginia is a really good football team. Dana has them playing very well. They always play physical, play hard. It's a good-looking team.\"\nOn Texas' loss:\n\"Good game. Bunch of big defensive plays. [The end] was just like last year with Michael [Hunnicutt] had a game or two where you feel for them. You put your arm around them. They're young people that do the best they can out there playing for their school. You just gotta let them know you appreciate them. They're doing the best they can.\"\nOn West Virginia's secondary:\n\"It's a really good group, like you said, led by [Karl] Joseph, their great safety. They've got good cover guys, good corners. They mix up their coverages. They'll man you up [by] rolling the corners up on both sides, or one side and the other. They mix it up. They're good players. You can tell they've got a lot of good experience in their defense and in their secondary.\"\nOn if the team sees 3-3-5 defenses at all:\n\"We saw it last year. Don't see it a lot, but we see it. We do it some now in our fifty front. So, you're seeing more of it. There's a lot of movement with it. You can blitz all different ways. As much as anything too is the spacing. You can rush three or rush six. You can drop eight or bring heavy pressure from it. It's pretty flexible maybe is the best way to say it.\"\nFollow Joshua Friemel on Twitter at @Josh_Friemel .\nOn Twitter:\n @Josh_Friemel", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/Josh_Friemel", "https://twitter.com/Josh_Friemel"], "published": "2015-09-29T00:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T06:15:19.571+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
