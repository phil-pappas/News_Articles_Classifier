He finished with 21 points, seven rebounds, five assists and five steals. \nAbejo, Gabisan and Umpad combined for 40 points, 19 rebounds and 7 assists. Patrick Yu had 13 points for the Magis Eagles, while Wayne Kirby Bersaluna scored 11 points and grabbed 11 rebounds and Pastor added 11 points. But Colonia struggled and finished with only nine points, 7 rebounds and five assists. \n\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-07T19:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T16:08:05.644+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
