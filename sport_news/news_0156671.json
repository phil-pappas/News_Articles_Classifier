John Hickenlooper signed an executive order Tuesday creating a commission to discuss native American high school mascots.\nThe group would include tribes, local community members and state agencies to find common ground, said Ernest House Jr., executive director of the Colorado Office of Indian Affairs.\nIn the last legislative session, a bill carried by state Rep. Joe Salazar, D-Thornton, that would have required tribal approval for public schools to continue using native American mascots passed in the Democrat-led state House but was killed by a Republican-led Senate committee.\nErlidawn Roy representing the Meskwaki, Ojibwe, Laguna Pueblo, and the Isleta Pueblo tribes, writes a message \"I am not your mascot\" on the face of LacyJay Lefthandbull, 7, from the Apache, Pueblo, and Lakota tribes, showing their support for HB15-1165. The House Education Committee hears testimony on HB15-1165 at the Colorado State Capitol, a bill that would require Colorado's public schools to get approval from American Indian tribes for use of American Indian mascots and names. ( Kathryn Scott Osler, The Denver Post ) House Bill 1165 would have created a subcommittee in the Colorado Commission of Indian Affairs to review the use of potentially offensive mascots.\nThe subcommittee or a tribe would have had the power to approve native American mascots, or the schools would be given two years to stop the use of the mascot or risk a $25,000-a-month fine.\nHickenlooper's order doesn't include penalties, House said.\n\"This is a different approach to having that discussion, he said.", "external_links": ["http://www.leg.state.co.us/clics/clics2015a/csl.nsf/fsbillcont/314A38D8983C619B87257D9000765C67?Open&file=1165_01.pdf", "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site36/2015/1006/20151006__mascots_legislature~p1.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-06T10:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-07T00:05:29.006+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
