Multiple sources told the Tribune that Montgomery will require surgery and he is expected to be placed on injured reserve.\nThe Bears signed Montgomery to a one-year contract on April 2 to replace longtime center Roberto Garza. The $950,000 contract was for the minimum salary benefit. Montgomery, 32, started eight games for coach John Fox, offensive coordinator Adam Gase and line coach Dave Magazu last season in Denver. Before that, he played for Fox and Magazu in Carolina. Montgomery has 75 career starts, and the prognosis for recovery is good.\nThe question now is what will the Bears do to replace Montgomery with 12 games remaining? They have two games remaining before a week off. There appear to be three options. Stick with Matt Slauson, who moved over from left guard in the win over the Raiders, and use Patrick Omameh at left guard. Promote rookie third-round draft pick Hroniss Grasu, who has been inactive for the first four games. Or sign a veteran and plug him into the lineup to keep Slauson at left guard.\nThere are a handful of experienced centers on the street right now, including Garza, former Bear Brian de la Puente, Dominic Raiola and Samson Satele, who the Bears showed some interest in back in March. Whatever decision the club makes, there is a good chance an offensive lineman will be signed to the 53-man roster.\n Chicago Bears Will Montgomery Oakland Raiders John Fox Roberto Garza Matt Slauson Samson Satele", "external_links": ["http://www.tribpub.com/privacy-policy-and-your-privacy-rights/", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-5612a42a/turbine/ct-will-montgomery-out-for-season-20151005"], "published": "2015-10-05T18:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T01:47:57.538+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
