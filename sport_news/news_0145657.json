Five innings might’ve been enough. The Yankees had a similarly inconsistent rotation, but they made the playoffs on the heels of a dynamic bullpen.\nBut after the Red Sox missed on Miller, they never replaced him.\nIt’d be one thing to build a strong starting rotation and then skimp in the bullpen, adding a $2-million player here, a minimum-salary-waiver-claim there. But the Red Sox purchased only scratch-off lottery tickets to fill their rotation and then did the same in the bullpen.\nThey spent about $20 million on their Opening Day relief corps, but almost 25 percent of that ($4.5 million) was used on Edward Mujica, a splitfinger-throwing set-up man that stopped throwing his split and was eventually let go. They spent $9 million on Uehara, who earned his salary with a 2.23 ERA and 25 saves, despite missing the final two months. And dropping $2.25 million on Tazawa was a no-brainer.\nBut to round out the pen, they insisted on trying to polish uncut diamonds, giving oft-injured Alexi Ogando a disappointing tryout, failing to help Robbie Ross Jr. or Craig Breslow return to their 2013 form, and showing no conviction in their desire to transition any of their young starters into relievers.\nWhat they ended up with was the 26th-ranked bullpen that finished with a 4.24 ERA.\nWhat went wrong\nThe Red Sox’ season might’ve been all over by the end of May. They had a myriad of problems and no part of the team deserved praise, but the most obvious black hole was in the starting rotation.\nFrom April 22 through May 31, the Red Sox went 13-24. Their starting pitcher failed to get out of the sixth inning in 13 of those 24 losses.\nThe bullpen crumbled behind them. Manager John Farrell was left with few options, trying everybody and anybody in mop-up duty, hoping his high-powered offense would stage a late-game comeback, though it rarely did.\nThe only pitcher with a true role was Uehara. The rest of the relievers were forced to be on their toes from the third inning on.\n“We were all kind of pressing because we started losing,” Ross said. “We were all trying to do the best we could to help each other and win games, but maybe it could’ve been pressure we were putting on ourselves.”\nNo matter who Farrell put on the mound, disaster seemed to follow. Roles were never established.\n“Uncertainty is certainly part of the job description for being part of the bullpen,” Breslow said. “But as the season goes on you hope those things work themselves out. Sometimes they don’t.”\nWhat went right\nEven at 40 years old, Uehara was still a force. His velocity tumbled but the results did not.\nIf he had to throw his 88-mph fastball to set up his almost-invisible splitter, he would. And while he missed the last two months after breaking his wrist while trying to field a line drive barehanded, Uehara’s presence was about the only thing that went right in the Sox bullpen.\nInterim manager Torey Lovullo made the best of the situation in the final six weeks. One reliever said the benefit to pitching for Lovullo was his communication. He told each reliever when he would be used and explained his decision to them after games.\nEven without Uehara, the Sox bullpen stayed afloat with a 22nd-ranked 4.47 ERA during Lovullo’s 48 games at the helm.\nHe showed more patience with his starters on the mound too, giving them an average of 101 pitches per start, though it’s easier to do that when the rotation posted a third-ranked 3.35 ERA with Lovullo. Under Farrell, starters averaged just 94 pitches per start with a 28th-ranked 4.88 ERA.\nWhat to do\nThe most obvious solution is to pour money at the problem.\nThe Red Sox must add a power arm to give the Sox options in the set-up roles. Perhaps they could bring back Jonathan Papelbon, who could be acquired on the cheap from the Nationals, who are dying to get rid of him after he choked franchise player Bryce Harper in a late-season dugout altercation. He brings a power arm who can handle the ninth inning, though Uehara would likely have to accept a set-up role in Papelbon’s absence.\nSince Papelbon left the Red Sox before the 2012 season, their bullpen has ranked 25th with an average velocity of 92.3 mph.\nThe Sox could benefit from a dominant lefty. Tommy Layne was useful, but the Sox need to give Farrell more options out of the pen. There’s no excuse in this age of matchups to have the platoon advantage in just 41 percent of their plate appearances. It was the second-lowest percentage in the majors this season.\nLong averse to signing big-ticket closers, the Red Sox might finally have to change their strategy. They need someone like Andrew Miller.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T19:09:29.103+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
