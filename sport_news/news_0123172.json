When police told him to stop, he \"got all in the cops' face and they told him not to do that; he started cussing them out and stuff.\"\nJail records show the actor was booked into the Travis County Jail and released on his own recognizance. No attorney was listed on the record.\nHe was arrested in the city's Sixth Street entertainment district, where the Austin City Limits festival is taking place through Sunday.\nHis publicist did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the arrest.\nLaBeouf previously made headlines with bizarre escapades — including yelling from the audience during a Broadway show and wearing a paper bag on his head to a movie premiere — and has been treated for an alcohol problem.", "external_links": ["http://www.kvue.com/story/entertainment/2015/10/09/shia-labeouf-arrested-downtown-austin/73694550/", "http://embed.newsinc.com/Single/iframe.html?WID=2&VID=29799537&freewheel=91223&sitesection=advance&height=349&width=620", "http://www.aclfestival.com/", "http://www.nola.com/news/index.ssf/2014/02/shia_labeouf_hits_red_carpet_w.html"], "published": "2015-10-11T00:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T10:02:48.211+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
