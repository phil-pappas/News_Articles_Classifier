Midfielder Fábio Rochemback was once caught on camera insulting Peseiro after being substituted — an incident that occurred with another player in Liedson a few months before.\nOne of Ahly's main problems under former manager Fathi Mabrouk was what was said to be his weak personality. After being affronted by Hussein El-Sayed and Moemen Zakareya, no action was taken against the pair.\nThe need for a strong personality to control the star-studded Ahly squad and restore order to the team has been a matter of major debate on social media between fans.\nVideos and footage have circulated since the announcement of his becoming Ahly coach showing him in less than favourable light.\n(For more sports news and updates, follow Ahram Online Sports on Twitter at @AO_Sports and on Facebook at AhramOnlineSports .)", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/AO_Sports", "https://www.facebook.com/AhramOnlineSports?fref=ts"], "published": "2015-10-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T15:03:33.941+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
