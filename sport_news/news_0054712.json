OU strutted into Fair Park, undefeated at 5-0, including a win over Notre Dame, and a two-touchdown favorite.\nTexas won 36-20.\n\"We thought we were going to beat them because they were having a down beginning, just like they are this year,\" OU junior linebacker Jordan Evans said this week. \"They proved us wrong.\"\nSo about UT's 50-7 loss last week at TCU ...\n\"The team we get at the Cotton Bowl is going to be completely different,\" OU senior center Ty Darlington said. \"It's going to be a dog fight.\"\nOU coach Bob Stoops also brought up the 2013 loss. And he also made sure to mention that Texas' four losses this season have come against opponents that are a combined 19-1.\n\"They've probably played the toughest schedule as anybody in the country to this point,\" Stoops said. \"I know coach [Charlie] Strong and his staff do an excellent job.\"\nOn Twitter:\n @kHairopoulos", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/kHairopoulos"], "published": "2015-10-07T03:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T06:04:24.342+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
