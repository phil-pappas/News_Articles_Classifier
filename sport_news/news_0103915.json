When you stepped out of the Toronto Blue Jays clubhouse late Friday night you could smell it, acrid and sour. Across the hall, the Kansas City Royals were celebrating their six-game victory in the American League Championship Series the way every baseball team celebrates, the way the Jays had celebrated three times already — by donning goggles and spraying champagne and beer around like everyone was on fire and needed to be put out. The smell wafted in the air, familiar, belonging to someone else.\nFor the Jays, this was the year everything changed. For 101 games they were fooling people into thinking they were the same old Jays: average, somehow. The three months after that were thrilling, giddy, hilarious, absurd. The memories should be thick. That seventh inning and Jose Bautista’s home run in Game 5 against the Texas Rangers, imperious bat flip and all , was the best thing Toronto has seen in sports since Joe Carter, full stop.\nAnd then against Kansas City, this towering team just got beat.\nAt the end there was bitterness over a home run that might have been a double, and about the way the strike zone inexplicably expanded in the top of the ninth, with merciless closer Wade Davis on the mound. With Dalton Pompey on third with no outs, a good contact hitter and an elite one — Dioner Navarro and Ben Revere — both watched pitches sail high and outside. Strike.\nRevere’s was particularly egregious. As Fangraphs noted, a 3-1 count results in a 1.050 OPS, and a 2-2 count results in a .585. All the Jays needed was a grounder, but the difference in the count shrinks major-league batters from Jose Bautista in his 43-homer, .447 on-base 2011 season to Aaron Hill in his .225-hitting, .270 on-base 2011 season. For Revere, it historically merely drops him from .993 to .635. There was grumbling about uncalled balks, too. “The strike zone went from here,” said one Jay in the clubhouse afterwards, holding his hands a plate’s width apart, furious — “to here,” he said, pulling the markers apart.\nBut that was the last stop on the road, in an utterly fabulous game. The Jays were 0-for-12 with runners in scoring position in Game 6 and 4-for-41 in their four losses, leaving 32 runners on base. The season ended with Bautista, the man of the hour and of the post-season, standing on deck.\nMaybe they deserved better. Josh Donaldson didn’t hit a ball harder all year than the one he smoked with two on in the fifth inning, and if he swings a fraction of a second later, it goes through a hole between shortstop and third. If he swings a couple fractions of a second earlier, the ball goes rocketing down the line. But he hit it in the precise way that he hit it, and the rocket found a glove. Baseball. It’s like Marco Estrada put it after Game 6: “We got very far, but with this team, we should have won the whole thing. It’s the way baseball is. The best team doesn’t always win. That’s just the way baseball is. It’s a crazy sport.\n“You just never know.”\nSo the clubhouse was quiet and angry and sad. The departing Mark Buehrle packed his bag and walked out and yelled, “See you guys all in spring training! Good luck!” and someone yelled back “Will you be with the Cardinals?” David Price was asked if he would be back and he said he didn’t know, but that he would “absolutely” be open to it. Whatever he said, Price was not entirely happy with his usage in the playoffs. He was a treasure for this team, on and off the field, disappointing playoffs and all. (Sports Illustrated’s Tom Verducci discovered Price was, indeed, tipping his changeup to hitters, which the Jays worried about in the Texas series). But a marriage is unlikely to be in the cards.\nMark Shapiro is in charge of this organization now, and his first order of business for the team’s new president has to be its general manager. Alex Anthopoulos’s architecture of this team was masterful. The entire lineup is under contract for next season, plus Devon Travis and Dalton Pompey and Michael Saunders. There is some work to do in the bullpen. The rotation will need to be rebuilt with Marcus Stroman at the helm, followed by R.A. Dickey and then questions. The farm system will need to be rebuilt after being looted for a second time in three years.\nAnd most of all, Shapiro will have to convince Anthopoulos that this remains his job, and Anthopoulos will have to convince Shapiro that it should be. It’s no sure thing. Again: Kansas City was great, but the better team doesn’t always win.\nBut the bigger question that Shapiro will need to answer, and Rogers will need to answer, is what does this team want to be? Does ownership want to continue to walk the upper-middle-class path, and act like a big market but not a really big market? Does it want to truly commit, as it should, and keep the deep, powerful well of fandom that was awakened this year? The Jays added a whole $8 million (U.S.) at the deadline, all in all. With the departing contracts, there should be money to spend. With smarts and vision, this doesn’t have to be as good as it ever gets.\nA beautiful run, and it ended on a warm, rainy autumn night in Kansas City.
