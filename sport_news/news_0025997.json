That list of one-loss team includes several Power 5 powerhouses who are very much in the hunt.\nMORE: SN's Dirty Dozen players | Week 6 photos\nWho are those one-loss schools? Here’s a list of the Top 10 one-loss teams through six weeks.\n1 Alabama (5-1)\n© Provided by Sporting News The Crimson Tide are not “dead, buried and gone” by any means. Alabama has outscored opponents 99-24 since the loss to Ole Miss, and Jake Coker is completing 65 percent of his passes in those wins. A visit to Texas A&M next week will let us know where the Crimson Tide stands in the SEC West race.\nALABAMA: Five things we learned in Tide's win\n2 Michigan (5-1)\n© Provided by Sporting News Back-to-back-to-back shutouts under Jim Harbaugh. Wow. Credit D.J. Durkin for molding a defense that allowed a FBS-best 6.3 points per game. Now an in-state showdown with Michigan State (6-0) will let us know just how real the \"Harbaugh Effect\" is in Ann Arbor. It’s going to be close, and it’s going to be chippy.\nMICHIGAN: Five things we learned Saturday\n3 Notre Dame (5-1)\nThe Irish's near-comeback against Clemson is still fresh in mind, and the schedule is negotiable. USC unloaded on the Irish 49-14 last season. It will be interesting to see if Notre Dame flips that script next week. From there, the road schedule includes trips to Temple, Pittsburgh and the regular-season finale at Stanford.\nNOTRE DAME: Five things we learned\n4 Ole Miss (5-1)\n© Provided by Sporting News Ole Miss still boasts the SEC's highest-scoring offense at 46.8 points per game. The Rebels still have the head-to-head win against Alabama, and they would be forgiven for the blowout loss at Florida if they run the table. Ole Miss has to duck a road test at undefeated Memphis next week before five straight SEC West games to close the regular season.\n5 Stanford (4-1)\n© Provided by Sporting News The Cardinal would be able to pass off the season-opening loss to Northwestern as a mulligan if they can run the table in the Pac-12. That chance continues Thursday against UCLA. The Cardinal have won the last seven meetings. If they can get to late-November, the last three games against Cal, Oregon and Notre Dame are at home.\n6 UCLA (4-1)\n© Provided by Sporting News The Bruins can spoil Stanford's plans with a road win on Thursday. Injuries have ravaged UCLA’s defense, but freshman quarterback Josh Rosen should continue to improve. Paul Perkins remains the go-to tailback. The Bruins can play their way back in against a tough Pac-12 schedule.\n7 Oklahoma (4-1)\n© Provided by Sporting News The Sooners have work to do after losing to an unranked Texas team for the second time in three years, but Oklahoma will have a say in the Big 12 race in November. Just look at those last three games against three unbeaten teams (at Baylor, vs. TCU, at Oklahoma State) .\nTEXAS VS. OKLAHOMA: What we learned\n8 Duke (5-1)\n© Provided by Sporting News The Blue Devils hung around with an 8-1 start last season before back-to-back losses in late November. Duke continues to play outstanding defense (9.3 ppg.) and it has a bye week to prepare for the meat of the ACC Coastal Division schedule. Would a one-loss Duke team — or North Carolina or Pittsburgh for that matter — somehow crash the College Football Playoff party?\n9 Cal (5-1)\n© Provided by Sporting News Jared Goff threw five interceptions against Utah, and the Golden Bears still had a chance to win at the end of regulation. Now, Cal won't have an easy out the rest of the way. UCLA, USC, Oregon and Stanford all remain on the schedule.\n1 0 Penn State (5-1)\n© Provided by Sporting News We could've gone with Boise State here, but Penn State has the benefit of the Big Ten spotlight. The Nittany Lions recovered nicely from a season-opening loss to Temple. Penn State allows just 14.3 points per game, and they could get in the outskirts of the conversation by going to Columbus and knocking off No. 1 Ohio State next week. Hey, Penn State is the only Big Ten team that has won at Ohio Stadium at night. Like the Buckeyes, Penn State faces Michigan and Michigan State in the final two weeks of the regular-season.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.sportingnews.com/list/4657820-notre-dame-navy-result-score-winner-stats-records-rivalry-all-time", "http://www.sportingnews.com/list/4657799-texas-beats-oklahoma-score-result-charlie-strong-jerrod-heard-baker-mayfield?iadid=HOME%20PAGEFront_List_3", "http://www.sportingnews.com/ncaa-football/story/2015-10-05/nick-saban-angry-at-media-alabama-football-not-dead-crimson-tide-sec-georgia", "http://www.sportingnews.com/photos/4657733-college-football-photos-pictures-week-6-oklahoma-texas-michigan-usc-washington/slide/364150", "http://www.sportingnews.com/list/4657829-dirty-dozen-college-football-baddest-players-leonard-fournette-dalvin-cook", "http://www.sportingnews.com/list/4657815-michigan-northwestern-shutout-defense-big-ten-jim-harbaugh-deveon-smith-pat-fitzgerald", "http://www.sportingnews.com/", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "http://www.sportingnews.com/list/4657825-alabama-beats-arkansas-score-final-nick-saban-jake-coker-derrick-henry"], "published": "2015-10-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T09:53:12.439+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
