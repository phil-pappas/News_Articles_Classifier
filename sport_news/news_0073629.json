Some people will think about it for a while. \n“As long as it drives you to become a better player and a better club, that’s the biggest thing. \n“It’s disappointing what we did. \n“But I don’t think we were overawed, over-anxious or over-nervous. \n“I thought we were ready to go. We just didn’t make the most of our opportunities.” \nWest Coast were made to pay for a series of fumbles, wayward goalkicking and poor decision making. \nForward Jack Darling dropped a crucial mark in the third quarter, while midfielder Luke Shuey fluffed some key opportunities that could have led to goals. \nHurn said the players had rallied around each other to ensure no one was too down on themselves. \nAnd he said there was a deep hunger within the group to go all the way next year. \n“There’s been no pact. But players deep down inside, they know we want to achieve something as a group,” Hurn said. \n“The biggest message is just making sure the players keep working hard and keep doing the basics well. \n“If we can do that, it will put us in good stead. Because if you just think it’s going to happen, sides catch you. \n“So you always need to keep improving.” \nWest Coast are likely to lose vice-captain Scott Selwood, an emergency for the grand final, who is tipped to join his brother Joel at Geelong next season. \nBut the return of Eric Mackenzie and Mitch Brown from knee injuries will help bolster West Coast’s defence.
