The Broncos checked in at No. 24 in the USA Today Coaches Poll and No. 25 in the AP Top 25. \nThe return to the rankings comes on the heels of Boise State's second defensive shutout of the season - a 55-0 drubbing of Hawai'i at Albertsons Stadium Saturday night. Shut out: Boise State pummels Hawai'i \nThe Broncos had been ranked early in the season, but fell out after losing to BYU in Week 2. Since that loss, Boise State has outscored its last three opponents by a combined score of 163-14. \nIt's worth noting that several other Group of Five teams (teams from non-power conferences) are ranked close to the Broncos in each poll. \nIn the AP poll, Toledo (4-0) is ranked at No. 24, one spot ahead of the Broncos. In the coaches poll, Memphis is ranked No. 25, one spot behind the Broncos. \nThe highest ranked conference champion from the Group of Five gets an automatic bid to one of the prestigious New Years bowl games. As the Group of Five representative last season, Boise State beat Arizona in the Fiesta Bowl. \nHere's more on the AP Top 25 from college football writer Ralph D. Russo: \nOhio State remained No. 1 in The Associated Press college football Top 25 and tied a poll record on Sunday, despite lagging support from the voters. \nMeanwhile, No. 2 TCU and No. 3 Baylor edged forward, No. 4 Michigan State slipped and No. 5 Utah and No. 6 Clemson took big jumps. \nAfter four top-10 teams lost on Saturday, the rankings were rattled and five teams received first-place votes. The Buckeyes received 38 first-place votes, their fewest this season after beginning as the first unanimous preseason No. 1. TCU has five first-place votes, Baylor received 10, Utah has seven and No. 9 Texas A&M has one. \nOhio State was the only team in the top 16 to have the same ranking this week as last. \nThe Buckeyes held off Indiana 34-27 on Saturday and have now been top-ranked 101 times, matching Oklahoma for the most in the 79-year history of the media poll. \nAP Top 25 Texas A&M (5-0) - 1009 Oklahoma (4-0) - 976 Toledo (4-0) - 87 Boise State (4-1) - 65 \nOthers receiving votes: Oregon 39, Duke 31, Houston 31, Temple 23, Memphis 19, Navy 19, Arizona State 15, Mississippi State 11, West Virginia 8, Texas Tech 4, BYU 3, Kansas State 1, Missouri 1 \nUSA Today Coaches Poll Texas A&M (5-0) - 983 Florida (5-0) - 755 Boise State (4-1) - 100 Memphis (5-0) - 68 \nOthers receiving votes: Oregon 64, Duke 59, West Virginia 31, Toledo 24, Kansas State 17, Temple 16, Arizona State 16, Mississippi State 14, Navy 12, Houston 11, Kentucky 6, Arizona 5, Missouri 4, Wisconsin 4, North Carolina 4, Indiana 2, Illinois 2 Oct 3, 2015; Boise, ID, USA; Boise State Broncos head coach Bryan Harsin shakes hands with Broncos fans after Boise State defeated Hawaii 55-0.
