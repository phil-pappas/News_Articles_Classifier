The former NBA star was transported by helicopter from Sunrise Hospital and Medical Center in Las Vegas around 5 p.m. Monday, according to a statement from Alvina Alston, publicist for Odom’s aunt JaNean Mercer. She did not say where he was taken in Los Angeles. The statement from the Mercer and Odom families thanked the hospital and Odom’s fans and said his estranged wife, Khloe Kardashian, his father and his two children from a previous relationship are with him. Kardashian posted a separate statement to her website saying Odom made “incredible strides” at the Las Vegas hospital and thanking the doctors and nurses “for their kindness and diligent work.” The family has received strength from the outpouring of support from Odom’s fans, she said.
