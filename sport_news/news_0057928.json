But the trend has also raised questions of equity from traditional accommodations, and state and local officials.\nEileen is showing us how to use the online reservation service Airbnb. Ordinary folks who are offering to rent a room, or their whole house to visitors worldwide. Eileen has just listed a room in her home for the first time.\nAirbnb was founded in 2008. It is based in San Francisco and reportedly has a net worth of $13 billion dollars. There are currently a million and-a-half listings worldwide, in more than 34 thousand cities and 190 countries. Eileen is checking out the hundreds of listings in Burlington. And that has created some concern for local Inns.\n\"Our main interest is we just want a fair playing field,\" said Larry Davis, owner of the Willard Street Inn. Prices for a room at this bed and breakfast start at $150. Some rooms on Airbnb in Burlington can be rented for under $100. Some include breakfast, some do not.\n\"The city and county have regulations -- and the state even -- for ensuring that safety requirements are met and room and meal tax are collected, and all things of that nature,\" Davis said.\nDavis says that includes paying for yearly systems inspections, and licenses and insurance. Something private home owners who are listed on Airbnb currently do not have to do.\n\"We understand Airbnb is an option for people and we are not advocating that that be taken away,\" said Cathy Davis with the Lake Champlain Regional Chamber of Commerce. \"While we have been blessed with great occupancy rates, everybody wants to come to Burlington, everybody loves vacationing in Vermont, and that is wonderful. There is a price, a competitive advantage, if you are not paying some of those expenses that a business is required.\"\nA big bone of contention is collecting the Rooms and Meals tax from those booking rooms. In Burlington it is 11-percent. nine-percent goes to the state, and two-percent goes to the city. Some Airbnb hosts are not collecting those fees and the tax department says they should be if a property is rented out for more than 14 days.\nNone of the Airbnb hosts contacted by WCAX wanted to be interviewed on camera for this story, but one woman did say she has been with Airbnb for two years now, she has a steady stream of customers, and she said she does collect rooms and meals taxes.\nThe Chamber says if hosts are regularly renting out space, they should have to follow the same requirements as others in the hospitality industry. The city of Burlington has been looking into Airbnb, to come up with solutions to problems with zoning and taxes.\n\"I have talked to the mayor a couple of times and they are making slow progress,\" Larry Davis said. \"I am pleased with the slow progress. All we are asking is those who want to be Airbnb hosts -- just play by the rules, get all the permitting and everything in place.\"\nThe Vermont Department of Taxes reportedly is also looking into Airbnb, contacting local property owners on the site to see who might owe rooms and meals tax.\nTuesday on the Channel 3 News at 6, Judy Simpson visits with an Airbnb host who says the money he makes helps pay his property taxes, which allows him to stay in his home.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T02:50:56.523+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
