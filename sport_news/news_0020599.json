Both offenses remained quiet in 30 minutes of sudden-victory overtime, prompting penalty kicks to determine which team would advance to the YAIAA semifinals. \nEven the typical five rounds of penalty kicks weren't enough to decide the game, as both teams made four out of the first five kicks. Both teams scored again in the sixth round, before Susquehannock missed to start the seventh round with a shot that went over the net. That's when Versace confidently stepped up and scored the winner. \nNortheastern faces the winner of the Dallastown-Fairfield quarterfinal game in the league semifinals on Tuesday. The Bobcats lost to the Wildcats once and tied them once during the regular season, and did not face the Knights.

I don't even like going into overtime. Our players didn't play at the highest level, I'm a little disappointed, but the good news is we did enough to get by and we can fix that for the next game.\" Northeastern", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T21:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T22:03:12.892+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
