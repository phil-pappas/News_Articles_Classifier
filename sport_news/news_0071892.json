So was a fourth cornerback, Ruhann Peele, with more game experience than Wharton.\nA fifth, Kam Lott, transferred on good terms.\nAs a result, secondary coach Darrell Wilson and defensive coordinator Joe Rossi are speeding up the learning curve.\n“I’m seeing a lot of this stuff for the first time,” Wharton said. “Each week I’m getting more and more used to it, feeling a lot more confident in myself and believing in the techniques Coach Wilson teaches me and the gameplan Coach Rossi puts out. The more experience, the better.”\nWharton and true freshman Blessuan Austin made their collegiate debuts in the season-opener and started side-by-side in the first six games, with Rutgers relying on its safety depth to fill the nickel and dime packages.\n“That’s why every kid comes to college,” Wharton said. “You want to be the starter. You want to make plays and everything. Whatever I can do to help the team. I’m happy with where I’m at.”\nBut Austin suffered an upper body injury when he took a knee to the head against Indiana. He did not return to the game and is questionable for Saturday’s game against No. 1 Ohio State.\nThe true freshman Adams took Austin’s place and gave up a 38-yard touchdown pass to start the second half. The only other cornerbacks on the two-deep are an even-less experienced true freshman (Ronnie James) and a minimally experienced fourth-year walk-on (Brian Verbitski).\n“My first game was a couple weeks ago and I know how I felt,” Wharton said. “For him to go in with such a great offense to make his debut, I know a lot of things were going through his head. I was just trying to calm him down a bit because he is a very good player.\n“We’re real close off the field. He looks at me like a big brother so I’m going to do everything I can to make sure he’s ready.”\nAdams played in four of the first five games but mostly on special teams. Wharton also is earning his stripes on special teams.\n“Isaiah has done an excellent job of contributing on special teams. One of the best kickoff coverage guys we have on the team,” Flood said. “Those are important snaps every time.”\nPerhaps sensing he needed to raise his game further with Austin out, Wharton made his first career interception during the game-ending string of four consecutive stops by Rutgers defense and four consecutive scoring drives by Rutgers offense.\n“They were running a lot of underneath routes and I let a couple get away in the first half,” he said. “Coach Wilson kept riding me and I knew it was coming again. I just played my man and I sprinted to the ball. Our D-line got a great pass rush and I did my job just to make the catch.”\nAgainst Indiana, Rutgers allowed 64 yards and no points in the final 20 minutes after giving up 563 yards and 52 points in the first 40 minutes.\n“It was crazy, but everyone on the sideline was composed,” Wharton said. “We’ve been through so much adversity that that’s just the beginning. We all felt like we could win when we’re playing to our full potential.”\nStaff Writer Ryan Dunleavy: rdunleavy@gannettnj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T00:39:15.788+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
