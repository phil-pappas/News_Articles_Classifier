Steve German Special to the Bee 1 of 21 \nBy Mark Billingsley \nBee Correspondent \nBoth teams have been on a collision course for weeks, but it’s the Dixon Rams who will be in the body shop for at least a week while the Capital Christian Cougars drove back to Sacramento Friday night with nary a scratch after denting, scraping and bashing the Rams. \nWith the 47-0 win, the 20th-ranked Cougars (7-0) take control of the Golden Empire League title chase while the Rams (6-2) are left looking for composure. \nA bevy of Rams’ unsportsmanlike conduct penalties put the Cougars in great field position and they took advantage of it on both sides of the ball. \nThe defending GEL champion Capital Christian racked up 445 yards of total offense, with 344 of that coming on the ground by seven different rushers. Freshman running back D’Marcus Ross led the way with 79 yards on eight carries and a 12-yard touchdown run on the second play of the game. \nCougars quarterback Jacob Norville finished with 101 yards and touchdown throws of 19 and 14 yards, both to Julian Leslie. Leslie also had a TD run of seven yards midway through the fourth quarter that hastened a running clock. \n“(Ross) is just unbelievable and he’s going to be a special kid,” Norville said. “And Leslie, wow, this is only his second game with us and he’s only just now jelling.” \nLeslie transferred from Oakmont High School and had to sit out the first five games of the season, Norville said. \nThe Cougars’ defense held the Rams to eight yards in the second half and 113 yards total for the night, which happened to mark the Rams’ seniors last game at Finney Field. \nAfter losing to Woodland 20-0, the Rams had won sixth in a row. Both teams scored 69 points last week, but Dixon only played the first half as West Campus forfeited after trailing 69-6 and suffering several injuries to an already small roster. Capital Christian was coming off a 69-0 win against Lindhurst. \n“It’s a lot of fun to play in this offense with so many weapons,” Norville said. “We have a great game plan every week and no matter what the defense does we can counter.” \nThe Cougars have outscored their last five opponents 276-40. \nMark Billingsley is a Carmichael-based freelance writer: editorwriter@att.net or @editorwriter001.
