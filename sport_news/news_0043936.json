It wasn’t part of the script. \nNeither was losing Josh Donaldson, who was lifted for a pinch-hitter in the fifth as a precautionary move after taking a knee in the head on a slide into second base in the fourth. Then Jose Bautista left after the eighth with a leg cramp. Both players are expected to be good to go Friday. \nTexas lost its third baseman early as well as Adrian Beltre was forced to leave in the third with lower back stiffness. \nDavid Price wasn’t sharp this day either, which no doubt will cause an avalanche of criticism directed at manager John Gibbons for skipping him in the last week of the regular season and having him enter Thursday’s series opener on 11 days’ rest. \n“I felt good, I just didn’t make pitches in the big spots when I needed to,” Price said. “We need shutdown innings at this time of the year and I didn’t do that today.” \nThe TSN turning point arrived in the fifth inning after Price hit Rougned Odor for the second time in the game and No. 9 hitter, catcher Robinson Chirinos followed by whacking the next pitch over the wall in left centre for a two-run homer and a 4-1 Rangers lead. \nTouch them all, Robinson, you’ll never hit a bigger home run. \nThe fifth was supposed to be a shutdown inning after the Jays squeaked out a run in the fourth on a 45-foot dribbler towards third by Edwin Encarnacion which snapped the Jays scoreless-inning streak this season against Texas starter Yovani Gallardo at 16.2 innings. \nPrice now has zero wins in six post-season starts and overall is 1-6 in 11 post-season games. Figure that one out. \n“It’s been seven years,” Price said since lone post-season win. “I want that monkey off my back. I expect to have better results out there on the field. I didn’t throw the ball like I’m capable of today.” \nALL THE RIGHT MOVES \nRangers manager Jeff Bannister had his players on the move in the third and employed a couple of hit-and-run plays that helped them take a 2-0 lead. With Odor on first after being hit by Price, he took off for second with Chirinos hitting a chopper to third. The only play for Donaldson was the force at first with Odor safely in scoring position at second. \nDelino DeShields came to the plate and, with Price in his windup, Ryan Goins broke back towards second with the back-door pick play from Russsell Martin on. When he moved, DeShields bounced a single in the vacated hole, scoring Odor. \nAnother hit-and-run with Shin Soo-Choo at the plate moved DeShields to second and he scored on a line-drive single to centre by Beltre. \nBannister squeezed two runs out of a hit batter and two singles by having his base runners on the move. \nA SIGN OF RUST \nOne of the questions surrounding Price going into Thursday’s opener was how he would respond to having 11 days of rest between starts. \nIn the opening inning, it didn’t look good as after retiring the leadoff hitter on a fly to deep centre, Price walked the next two Texas hitters, Beltre on a four-pitch walk. Of his opening 15 pitches, 10 had been balls. \nPrice though came back to induce Prince Fielder to ground into a room-service 4-6-3 double play to end the inning. A 17-pitch inning for Price. \n“Just battling nerves early on,” Price said. “I didn’t throw the type of game I expect myself to throw and that’s what happens.” \nNOT SO CANADIAN \nHey, aren’t we supposed to be the “nice” guys, the polite Canucks that always say please and thank you after taking a knuckle sandwich? \nThursday’s crowd was of a different ilk, however, as they lustily booed the members of the Texas Rangers upon pre-game introductions and drowned out the PA announcer with chants of “Let’s Go Blue Jays.” \nWhen the Jays took the field they stood and waved their rally towels — supplied free of charge — and screamed their lungs out. Good god, even Gibbons received a standing ovation. \nHow un-Canadian. \nLITTLE BIG MAN \nDue to the fact he’s just five-foot-eight, Marcus Stroman said he pitches with a chip on his shoulder, but that fearlessness he brings to the mound doesn’t extend off it. He admits he can get rattled. \n“I hate spiders. Yeah, there’s a lot of things that throw me,” Stroman, the Jays’ Game 2 starter, said. “I don’t like outdoors, I’m a city guy. I have this talk with (Mark) Buehrle all the time, I’m not a hunter, I don’t like bugs. I call Aaron (Sanchez) over if there’s a single moth or spider or cockroach at our place in Florida. He’s the one to kill it, not me. \n“But yeah, as far as sports-wise I feel like I’m able to, you know what I mean, keep my emotions in check and use the limelight as kind of a way to get up. I love it, I love it. You know what I mean, this is what you dream of when you’re a little kid and you’re playing in the backyard, I’m playing in the playoffs. This is why you play the game. I couldn’t be more excited. I’m not nervous. I’m not slightly nervous. I haven’t pitched in nine days, I’m excited to get out there and get on the mound and get going.” \nJust as long as he doesn’t find a spider or cockroach on the mound.
