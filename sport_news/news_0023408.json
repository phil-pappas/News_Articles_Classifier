The Judge’s daughter was questioned for around three hours at the UT police lines in Sector 26. She was last questioned on October 10 and was summoned for the second time today. The daughter, who was known to Sippy for a long time, was questioned by members of a special investigation team (SIT). UT SSP Sukhchain Singh Gill, head of the SIT, was also present during the questioning of the Judge’s daughter. Sources said she was told to answer those questions which the police were unable to ask during the previous questioning on October 10. She was asked in detail about her movements on the day Sippy was found murdered and the details given by her would be corroborated with scientific evidence. The police said there was no direct evidence against her that could provide any substantial lead to the murder. Sippy Sidhu, grandson of a former Justice SS Sidhu, was gunned down at a public park in Sector 27 on September 20. Assailants had pumped four bullets in Sidhu’s body. Family members of Sippy Sidhu had stated that Sippy had gone to meet a girl in Chandigarh on September 20. Deepinder Kaur, mother of the deceased youth, claimed that there were differences between Sippy and his one close female friend on the issue of marriage. Since the beginning, the Chandigarh Police have been working on three theories, including property dispute, personal rivalry and love triangle behind the murder of Sidhu. The police suspect that the assassination was a case of contract killing.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T04:02:41.380+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
