Terms like “service drop,” “masthead” or “alternate circuit breaker” may sound foreign to many people.\nIt helps to understand which parts of your electric service are owned by the property owner or the utility. If you know in advance who is responsible for repairs should your service be damaged during severe weather or flooding, you can save time and avoid delays in getting problems fixed.\nYou also should be aware that some work -- like major home improvement projects or installations that affect your electric service -- requires a permit and inspection.\nWhether you do it yourself or hire a contractor, it's always good to learn everything that's required before work begins.\nWeatherhead diagram\nRefer to this diagram and use the following information as an “Electric Service Cheat Sheet” for overhead service. Print and post this cheat sheet in your garage, basement or near your breaker box as a handy reference guide.\nPower outages and repairs\nSevere weather may cause widespread power outages and damage your electric service equipment.\nFor above-ground service, utilities are responsible for the supply line, called a service drop that runs from the utility pole to the premise. Your utility also owns the utility pole, transformer and the neutral lines within the right of way. This also includes the meter, even though it’s attached to your home or located in the basement.\nProperty owners are responsible for their mast, masthead (which is a weather insulator), service drop attachment to either mast or the structure, and meter base, which houses the meter and supporting components.\nThis equipment should be attached securely to the house or building. If you find damage, call your utility company immediately. They will send a line technician to make the area safe. If property owner equipment is damaged, you should contact a licensed electrician to have the repairs made. A list of approved electrical contractors is available on the Better Business Bureau website, www.bbb.org .\nOnce the repairs are complete and the necessary permit inspections have been made, the inspector will notify the utility to have the power restored. Your electrician should advise you of what inspections are necessary. For the Louisville Metro area, inspections fall under the jurisdiction of the Louisville Jefferson County Department of Construction Review .\nLEARN MORE: Find additional articles on energy-related issues from LG&E and KU\nInstalling new appliances or equipment\nProjects that involve a new electric circuit or wiring also require an electrical inspection. Typical examples include installation of a new central A/C unit, sump pump, light fixtures where they didn’t exist before and adding new electrical panels and breakers.\nWhether the property owner or a licensed electrician obtains the permit depends on who does the work. Consult your electrical contractor or local inspector for details.\nMore information\nYour utility can provide more information regarding electric service repairs and installations, including details about underground service.\nBecause your energy matters, this story was sponsored by LG&E and KU .", "external_links": ["https://lge-ku.com/", "https://www.scribd.com/doc/282646951/Weatherhead-diagram", "https://www.scribd.com/embeds/282646951/content?start_page=1&view_mode=scroll&show_recommendations=true", "https://louisvilleky.gov/government/construction-review/electrical-permits", "http://www.bbb.org/"], "published": "2015-09-29T23:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T08:34:07.217+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
