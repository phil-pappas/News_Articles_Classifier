These Oilers are playoff contenders, and the Kings treated them as such Sunday night.\nWith a grinding effort and an opportunistic late power play, the Kings won their fifth consecutive game and beat the Oilers 3-2 at Rexall Place.\nTanner Pearson scored a power-play goal on a close-range rebound with 3:26 remaining, after a point shot by Jake Muzzin pinballed around the Edmonton zone, but the action wasn’t finished.\nWith 3.8 seconds remaining, Edmonton’s dazzling rookie, Connor McDavid, had the puck on his stick and the net essentially empty, but Kings goalie Jonathan Quick lunged for the save. The puck (and glove) were within inches of being over the goal line, but video review in Toronto confirmed the on-ice no-goal call.\n“He’s done it before. It’s not like it’s something new,”’ Kings center Anze Kopitar said with a grin on Fox Sports West. “But it’s definitely a very nice feeling, when you’re hanging on in the last few seconds and he comes up with that. It just shows that he’s a world-class goaltender.”\nThe Kings needed the late goal to win, but trailed the game for less than two minutes. Jeff Carter scored six minutes into the first period and Kopitar scored a second-period goal as the Kings turned a one-goal deficit into a lead, then tried to hold on against the talented Edmonton forwards.\nWith 6:04 left in regulation, Edmonton’s Taylor Hall tied the score 2-2 with a power-play goal, when he deflected in a point shot by Ryan Nugent-Hopkins, but the Kings regained the lead 2:38 later.\nThe Kings have scored four power-play goals in their past three games. They had one in their first five games.\n“We’re just playing our game,” Kopitar said of the win streak, which has moved the Kings into a first-place tie with San Jose in the Pacific Division. “We’re playing solid. Our PK, and special teams in general, have picked up the pace. Obviously tonight was a big game from Tanner.”\nAfter three losses to start the season, the Kings seem to have returned to form. Clearly they took the Oilers seriously, as evidenced by some surprising line-combination tweaking by Coach Darryl Sutter.\nEven after four consecutive wins, the Kings swapped their first- and third-line left wingers, as Pearson moved up and Marian Gaborik moved down. The combination of Kopitar and Gaborik on the Kings’ first line had been a staple since the Kings traded for Gaborik in 2014.\nThe Kings tied the score 1-1 in the first period, when Carter picked up the rebound of a Milan Lucic shot and, from a tight angle, shot the puck off Edmonton goalie Cam Talbot and into the net. Then, with 6:24 remaining in the second period, Kopitar skated to the middle of the left circle and fired a wrist shot past Talbot.\nContact the writer: rhammond@ocregister.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T08:11:56.146+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
