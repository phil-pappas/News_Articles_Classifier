WADA says meldonium, also known as mildronate, was included in the updated list because of “evidence of its use by athletes with the intention of enhancing performance.”\nDeveloped in Latvia, meldonium has been used to treat ischemia, or lack of blood flow. Meldonium had previously been on WADA’s list of drugs to be monitored.\nWADA also says the international motorcycling federation, FIM, has been removed from the list of sports prohibiting alcohol as a doping agent.\nIt says FIM “will address the use of alcohol using their own regulations.” WADA says caffeine and nicotine were placed on the list of stimulants to be monitored in competition.\nThe updated list, approved on Sept. 16, comes into force on Jan. 1. — AP", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T22:22:42.336+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
