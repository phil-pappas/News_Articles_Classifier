Cozens on October 3,   Julia Mines plays a ball at the net for the John Jay volleyball team. — Scott Mullin photo \nGoing into the season, Coach Tom Rizzotti knew the John Jay volleyball team would be a work in progress. \nJudging from Friday’s impressive 3-0 sweep of Fox Lane, that work is progressing quite well. \nThe Indians (6-2) dominated every facet of the game to down the Foxes in a surprisingly easy 25-15, 25-19, 25-16 win. \n“We definitely played better overall. We still had a little dip, but they are fewer and far in between, which is all we’re shooting for,” said Rizzotti, who returned only two starters from last year’s Section 1 Class A champs. “We know we’re going to have those times where we’re not playing well, where we’re making too many mistakes. We’re still that team that’s growing. We just have to make sure like tonight we don’t let (the dips) last too long.” \nIn the first game, the Indians were powered by the hitting of Taylor McCarthy and Julia Mines. The scored was tied 11-11 when John Jay reeled off six straight points, five on Amanda Wien’s service, to go up 17-11. The Indians then won eight of the next 12 points to take the game. \nFive straight service points by Wien helped break game two open, giving John Jay a 16-8 lead. The Foxes fought back to within 21-19, but a big kill down the line by McCarthy, two hitting errors and McCarthy’s ace closed out the 25-19 win. \nGame three was close early on, until the Indians gradually began to pull away behind the hitting of Lauren Donohue and McCarthy. Three service points, including an ace, by Cate Bauer put John Jay up 16-10, and an ace by Alex Hall made it 20-12. After that, the Foxes never got closer than seven. \nMcCarthy finished the match with 18 kills, 14 digs and three assists, while Donahue had 11 kills. Julia Mines had eight kills and 20 digs. \nWien led the Indians with 16 service points (two aces), and had a solid game setting up John Jay’s hitters, with 29 assists. She also had 11 digs. \nRachel Cifarelli had three kills and one assist. Katie Mines had five assists and Sydney Rappa one assist. \nHall finished with 11 digs, followed by Bauer (seven digs) and Donohue and Katie Mines with two digs each. Cifarelli had one dig. \nMcCarthy and Susannah Ruotolo each had a block, and Cifarelli had a block assist. \nRizzotti said he wasn’t expecting his team to dominate a good Fox Lane team like it did. \n“I know (Fox Lane) took two games off Hen Hud. We never gave them the opportunity to get anything going. We were really aggressive today,” he said. \nOverall, John Jay had the look of a team whose pieces are beginning to fall into place. \n“We talked about it last year, we talked about it again this year. We’re going to win if we play as a team,” said the coach. “Everybody’s starting to find their place and find their job. When we can do that and everybody’s firing on all cylinders, we’re going to be a dangerous team.” Related posts:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T20:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T13:06:29.686+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
