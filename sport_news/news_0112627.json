It finally came with 5:51 to play. Jetta Owens got behind the Wildecats defense and one-timed a heavy left-footed shot from 12 yards that goalie Jenna Hutchison did well to get her hands on but couldn't keep out of the net. \nAfter collecting themselves during the brief break before overtime, the Wildecats gained possession and went to a strength with corner kicks a regular scoring option this season. None was bigger than Dunbar's service to McNamara. \n\"They set really high goals in the beginning of the season and this was one of them, and they knew they had to find something in them to get it and they did,\" Procida said. \nSenior captain and midfielder Rachel Lazris, who played a big role in controlling the middle of the field for most of the game, knew the Wildecats still had a win in them despite the late adversity. \n\"As a team, we just all kept encouraging each other to do our best and keep playing as hard as we could and when we got the goal scored on us, we didn't back down. Honestly, I knew from the bottom of my heart that we were going to win even after that,\" she said. \"It was definitely just keeping our heads and not letting that get us down because that gave them a lot of momentum. But the fact that we believed in ourselves is what helped us. It feels awesome.\" \nThe Wildecats got strong performances in the back from senior sweeper Annie Hudec and freshman left back Julianna Bonner, while Hutchison made six saves. \nIn staying persistent to tie the game late, the Raiders can take away plenty of positives heading into the postseason. In addition to Owens' fine finish, forward Victoria Huxtable was a dangerous threat up front and goalie Devon Bodziony turned back eight shots. \n\"We were hoping to continue on with our intensity. We kind of thought we had a little bit of an edge. We knew corners were going to be tough to defend and they were successful on it. We just couldn't mark them on it,\" Atholton coach Stephanie Stoutenborough said. \"Besides the first 15 minutes, we got 100-percent effort. To come back after being down for [nearly 60 minutes] is pretty amazing and to show that heart â€” I'm proud of them.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T04:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T06:10:18.530+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
