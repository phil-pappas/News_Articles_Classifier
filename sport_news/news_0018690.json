The link was live for about five hours Wednesday before Goose Island discovered the unauthorized purchases, Goose Island spokeswoman Megan Lagesse said.\nLagesse said a person who won the lottery shared a winning URL on the BeerAdvocate and Facebook websites; the brewery will match names of ticket holders to actual lottery winners to determine which tickets will be voided. People whose tickets will be voided, and money refunded, will be informed Thursday, Lagesse said.\nWinning the lottery allowed a person to buy a $40 ticket for Rare Day, as well as the chance to buy three $60 bottles of Rare, an imperial stout aged for two years in 35-year-old bourbon barrels that is a member of the brewery’s renowned Bourbon County series.\njbnoel@tribpub.com\nTwitter @joshbnoel\nPrivacy Policy ", "external_links": ["http://www.tribpub.com/privacy-policy-and-your-privacy-rights/", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-561fe12f/turbine/ct-bourbon-county-stout-lottery-to-buy-rare-20151015"], "published": "2015-10-15T20:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T02:29:49.362+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
