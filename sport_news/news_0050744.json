The 2015-16 season will see an almost brand new roster for the Golden Eagles as only two players returning for Minnesota Crookston played last season with returning starter Derrick Redd, Jr. (Sr., G, Menifee, Calif.) back in the fold, along with key reserve Jim Warmack (So., F/C, East Grand Forks, Minn.). The Golden Eagles also return two players who redshirted the 2014-15 season with Gable Smith (R-Fr., F, Lodi, Wis.) and A.J. Walton (R-Fr., G, Oak Hills, Calif.) looking to make an impact for the Golden Eagles. The rest of the roster is brand new for UMC as 10 new players were part of a strong first recruiting class for Weisse and his staff. The group included four players ranked among the Top 45 players in Minnesota including 24th-ranked Kobe Critchley (Fr., G, Roseville, Minn.), 34th-ranked Chase Knickerbocker (Fr., G/F, Annandale, Minn.), 35th-ranked Nate Lorenz (F, 6-7 210, Breckenridge, Minn.) and 42nd-ranked Connor Gamble (Fr., G, Stillwater, Minn.). The Golden Eagles also have local high school recruits Aaron Hollcraft (Fr., G, Crookston, Minn.) and Darin Viken (Fr., G, Fosston, Minn.) who make for a great base for the future for Golden Eagle basketball. In addition to the high school recruits, UMC also has four junior college newcomers who will look to compete for positions for the Golden Eagles. C.J. Polk (So., G, Milwaukee, Wis.), will have three years to play for UMC. Riley Rice (Jr., F, Mullen, Neb.), Xavier Hall (Fr., G, Woodbury, Minn.) and Ben Grygiel (Jr., F, Rockford, Ill.) will have two years for Coach Weisse’s program. Point Guard One of the main two point guards who will compete for playing time will be freshman Critchley, who helped lead Roseville High School to a 23-6 mark last season. Crichley was among the top assist men in the state of Minnesota last season with 180 assists as a senior. Junior college newcomer Hall will also compete with Critchley for time. He was also one of the state’s top three-point shooters, making 47 last season. The North Platte Community College product had 25 assists and 27 steals as a sophomore last season and will compete for time. Also look for combo-guards Polk and Gamble to be solid options at the point guard spot. Shooting Guard Polk, another North Platte Community College product, will be a top player at the shooting guard spot for UMC. Polk averaged 9.1 points and shot 39.5 percent from beyond the arc last season as a freshman at North Platte. Polk helped the Knights to a 24-9 mark and a spot in the Region IX Tournament. As a prep, he was ranked the 12th-best player in the state of Wisconsin. Joining Polk at shooting guard will be prolific high school scorer Gamble, who averaged 20.4 points per game as a senior. Hollcraft will also push for time at shooting guard. The two-sport athlete, who also is on the baseball team, was a 1,415 career point scorer at Crookston H.S. and also set the mark for career rebounds at CHS. Also look for Redd to be a player who can move in and play the shooting guard position. Page 2 of 3 - Wing/Three-Guard The leader at the three-guard position will be Redd, who is back for his fifth season with the Golden Eagles after redshirting as a freshman. Redd will be the leader for UMC as he is the lone senior and lone returning starter. He averaged 11.4 points and 3.7 rebounds as a junior, leading the team in scoring. Redd improved his three-point shooting at a 32.2 percent clip and was a 76.8 percent free-throw shooter. Also look for one of Minnesota’s top scorers in 2014-15 to compete for time off the bench in Knickerbocker, who averaged 27.3 points per game as a senior and connected on 65 treys. Redshirt Walton will also be a key player off the bench. The California native was Weisse’s first recruit to UMC. He averaged 15.7 points and 7.2 rebounds as a senior and will look to add his athleticism to the back court. Local product Viken, who averaged 20.1 points per game at Fosston High School will also compete for time on the wing. Power Forward The 4 will be a competition between junior college recruit Grygiel and redshirt freshman Smith. Grygiel was a 35.2 percent three-point shooter and 83-percent free throw shooter as a sophomore at Rock Valley College. Grygiel averaged 12.8 points and 6.2 rebounds last season at Rock Valley College. Smith redshirted last year for the Golden Eagles. The Lodi, Wis., native put on 45 pounds last season and is up to 215. He helped lead his high school team to a 26-2 mark as a senior. He averaged 9.3 points per game for Lodi High School during the 2013-14 season. Knickerbocker also has the ability to play the power forward position. Center UMC has three players who will compete for time at the 5. Warmack is the returnee at the position after averaging 3.6 points and 2.0 rebounds per game, while appearing in all 27 games off the bench for the Golden Eagles. He will be joined by Lorenz, who averaged 19.4 points and was among Minnesota’s top rebounders with 269 on the season. Also in the fray at the position will be another North Platte Community College Product Rice, who averaged 3.3 point and 3.9 rebounds for the Knights during the 2014-15 campaign. Coaching Staff Weisse leads the way for the Golden Eagles after helping lead UMC to a 7-20 mark in his first season. The five conference wins was the best the team has had since the 2000-01 season. Weisse is very familiar with the NSIC after three years as an assistant at Minnesota State University Moorhead. He is a product of the Bo Ryan coaching tree after playing under Ryan at University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, where he was actually Ryan’s first-ever recruit. Weisse is joined by fellow Wisconsin-native Bryan Beamish, who was elevated to the lead assistant coach position after serving in the second assistant role last season after a year as a graduate assistant at University of Miami. Beamish is joined as an assistant by newcomer Blaise Davis, who spent the last two year’s at Dakota County Technical College after playing at Carleton College. Both members of the staff are very familiar with the Midwest region in recruiting and understand Coach Weisse’s coaching and recruiting philosophies.
