Va. – It’s time for the Oklahoma State offense to turn the corner this season. \nDespite the consistent inconsistencies that have plagued it all year, the OSU offense finds itself undefeated – by the skin of its teeth – and getting two weeks to work on things and prepare for a feeble opponent in Kansas. \nThe large reason the Cowboys find themselves unbeaten through six games is the play of the defense, which came up big in overtime to stop a surging West Virginia offense that scored 24 points in the second half. But much like last year’s squad, the defense can only do so much before opponents are able to exploit OSU’s Achilles’ heel. \nGlenn Spencer’s defense even spotted the Oklahoma State offense a touchdown when defensive end Emmanuel Ogbah recovered a fumble in the end zone for the game’s first score. \nThe OSU defense gave its counterparts plenty of chances to turn this game – just like several before – into a lopsided affair. The Cowboys forced four takeaways, exceeding the magic number three Spencer wants each game, but it was counteracted with three turnovers – all interceptions by Mason Rudolph – and a safety against the Oklahoma State offense. \nThe most alarming part of the offensive woes is just how bad things are in the running game. \nThrough three quarters Saturday, Rudolph was the leading rusher with 42 yards – thanks to a 40-yard run which set up Oklahoma State’s only touchdown of the second half. Rudolph finished as OSU’s leading rusher for the game with 48 yards. \nCowboy coach Mike Gundy has stated almost weekly, he wants a balanced attack with 150 yards rushing. But there is a big difference between desire and capability. \nThe best looking running back on Saturday for Oklahoma State was Rennie Childs, who only got seven carries in regulation but also had an impressive 31-yard catch and run. \nChilds was the featured back in the overtime, picking up 16 yards on three carries. It may be time to give Childs – who hits the hole, if there is one created by the offensive line, a lot quicker than starter Chris Carson – the chance to start and prove he can be the workhorse out of the backfield. He finished as the top running back with 34 yards and ran for 3.4 yards per carry, to Carson’s 1.5 on 14 rushing attempts. \nIf Oklahoma State wants to contend in the Big 12, the Cowboys are going to have to decide what they want to do with the run game – give Childs a chance, or scrap it altogether. \nThey will have two weeks to figure out what that offense will look like in a tune-up against Kansas before the brunt of the conference schedule in November. If the Cowboys can figure it out, another conference crown could be in their future. \nJason Elmquist is sports editor of The Stillwater News Press.
