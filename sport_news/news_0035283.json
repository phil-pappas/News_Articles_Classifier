Against Great Falls CMR, senior running back Kendrick Schell broke his leg and senior safety Brexton Frost sustained concussion. Senior wide receiver/defensive back Jack Sherman is out with a broken fibula. \nFrost was cleared and played Thursday. He returned a kick 85 yards to tie the score at 7-7 at 3:49 of the second quarter. \n\"The biggest thing is I feel so bad for these young men whose season has ended due to injury,\" Skyview coach Ron Lebsock said before the game. \"They are who we are playing for tonight.\" \nWiechman said the Falcons, two halfbacks, Dalton Macy and Austin Carothers, are sophomores. Macy rushed 11 times for 82 yards. \n\"Macy really stepped up and had no varsity experience,\" Wiechman said. \"He stepped up in practice and had good reps.\" \nLebsock said practice has been \"normal. The next guy in line steps in and does the job.\" \n\"That's how it is,\" he said. \"You can stand around and cry, but you have to move on.\" \nThe Falcons had their chances against Missoula Big Sky. The teams traded punches throughout the game. But in the end, the running of sophomore quarterback Levi Janacaro and senior running back Michael Banna proved too much to overcome. \nIn his second career start at quarterback, Janacaro rushed 23 times for 152 yards and Banna went 24 times for 113. \nJanacaro said he usually splits time with Tyler Ogilvie under center, but Ogilvie was pressed into wide-receiver duties due to an injury. It was the second straight start at QB for Janacaro. \n\"My first time my nerves were crazy,\" he said. \"I have butterflies, but once the game gets going and you have a drive or two, you settle down and play offense. It's not as bad as everyone says it is. It's fun.\" \nNow, Skyview readies to face Senior (6-1) at 7 p.m. Oct. 23 at Daylis. \n\"We have to start to prepare for Senior,\" Wiechman said. \"It's a good game and crosstown rivalry and we have to prepare for them.\" Tags", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T07:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T07:50:24.541+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
