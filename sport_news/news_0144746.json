Image 18 of 18 Quarterback Russell Bellomy has left the UTSA football program 1 / 18 Back to Gallery SAN ANTONIO â€” Senior quarterback Russell Bellomy has left the UTSA football program, a spokesman confirmed Saturday morning.\nUTSA (0-4) plays UTEP (2-2) tonight. Kickoff in the Conference USA opener for both teams is set for 7 p.m. central time in El Paso at the Sun Bowl.\nA newcomer this season, Bellomy played three games, all in relief.\nThe 6-foot-3 transfer from Michigan hit 4 of 10 passes for 39 yards without an interception or a touchdown, and he also rushed seven times for 21 yards.\nRELATED: UTSA emphasizes clean slate heading into UTEP\nBellomy is the second UTSA quarterback to quit the team in the last month. Sophomore Austin Robinson's departure was announced on Sept. 4.\nTheir departures leave four quarterbacks in the UTSA camp: Blake Bogenschutz, Dalton Sturm, Manny Harris and Jaylon Henderson.\nBogenschutz, a redshirt freshman, is the starter. Sturm, a sophomore walk-on, is the backup according to the team's latest depth chart.\nHarris and Henderson, both freshmen, have not played, but that could change if UTSA suffers any more attrition at the position through injuries.\nTrying to snap two streaks: When the Roadrunners kick off against the Miners at the Sun Bowl, they'll be trying to break two losing streaks.\nNot only have they lost four in a row to start the season for the first time in their five-season history, they have also lost seven straight road games.\nRELATED: UTSA coaches happy Kevin Strong Jr. stayed true to his word\nLast year's road woes: UTSA hasn't won on the road since it defeated Houston 27-7 on opening night last season.\nAfter beating the Cougars, the Roadrunners lost road games to Oklahoma State, Florida Atlantic, Louisiana Tech, Rice and Western Kentucky.\nThe streak reached seven with losses this season at Arizona and at Oklahoma State.\nRemember when? When UTSA won on at South Alabama to open the 2012 season, the team started on a 13-game road roll, during which it went 9-4, including the victory at Houston.\njbriggs@express-news.net\nTwitter : @JerryBriggs", "external_links": ["http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/34/70/17/7570408/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/36/65/14/8082193/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/40/04/53/8407773/5/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://www.expressnews.com/sports/college_sports/utsa/article/UTSA-emphasizes-clean-slate-heading-into-UTEP-6546081.php", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/34/70/17/7570411/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/34/70/17/7570407/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/34/70/17/7570412/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/40/07/35/8419197/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/34/70/17/7570408/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/34/70/17/7570406/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/34/70/17/7570407/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/36/64/55/8080197/5/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/34/70/17/7570410/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/40/04/53/8407773/5/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/34/70/17/7570409/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/36/65/14/8082193/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/34/70/17/7570403/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/34/70/17/7570406/3/920x920.jpg", "https://twitter.com/JerryBriggs", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/34/70/17/7570409/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/34/70/17/7570411/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/36/64/55/8080197/5/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/34/70/17/7570412/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/34/70/17/7570405/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/40/07/35/8419193/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/34/70/17/7570410/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/40/04/53/8407775/11/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/34/70/17/7570405/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/40/07/36/8419203/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/40/04/53/8407775/11/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/40/07/35/8419193/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/34/70/17/7570404/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/40/07/35/8419197/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/40/07/36/8419203/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/34/70/17/7570403/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/34/70/17/7570404/3/920x920.jpg", "http://www.expressnews.com/sports/college_sports/utsa/article/UTSA-coaches-happy-Kevin-Strong-Jr-stayed-true-6543366.php"], "published": "2015-10-03T19:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T20:55:51.547+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
