Dhoni hammered 92 not out and skilfully marshalled his bowlers to secure a series-levelling 22-run win against South Africa in the second one-day international on Wednesday. South African batsman Faf du Plessis conceded his team allowed India to regain the momentum during the Indore ODI.“That’s the most disappointing thing from team perspective. We had India on the ropes - 2-0 in the T20s and 1-0 in the one-dayers. We got nice momentum behind us, but now we have given them a sniff,” Du Plessis said on the eve of the match.“One-all in the series and they will be confident again winning. But in saying that I don’t think both teams have played their best cricket. We have both been firing at around 80 per cent. I think both teams would be inclined to play some better cricket.” Du Plessis said his team allowed Dhoni to rescue the hosts out of a precarious position and an opportunity lost to go 2-0 up in the ODI series. “I think we played well into MS’s hands. He had time to bat. He could just knock the ball around and be there at the end on 60 and he could then play an open, aggressive game. We made an error there to make it easy for him,” said du Plessis. Dhoni smashed 92 off just 86 balls and batted with the lower order to rally his team from 124 for 6 to a fighting total of 247 which his bowlers and fielders did well to defend.“There was quite a bit of pressure on him. He was biding his time with six wickets down. If you give a good player like that an opportunity to get into his tempo he will make use of it. MS is a very good hitter and when he’s on 50 it’s very difficult to bowl to him,” added du Plessis. The South African player said even after that his side had a great chance at 130 for 2 but neither he nor J P Duminy batted through to take the team home.“Then we were in a great position at 130 for 2 with myself and JP batting, and one of us should have been there to win the game. It was disappointing that we had lots of starts but could not get the team across the line.” What was impressive about the win was the way the bowlers defended a target of 248. “The spinners and pacers are complementing each other really well. In the last match, the spinners struck well at the start and the medium pacers finished things off towards the end. As a team you get a lot of confidence if the spinners get you wickets when the medium pacers fail to do so and vice versa. All bowlers need to support each other,” said Indian pacer Bhuvneshwar Kumar. He picked up three wickets at crucial junctures of the game in the second ODI. However, the batsmen have yet to fire apart from Rohit Sharman and Ajinkya Rahane who has struck two half centuries in a row since coming in at No. 3. Shikhar Dhawan and Suresh Raina have yet to strike form while Virat Kohli last hit a half century on February 15 during India's World Cup opener. With Ashwin expected to be sidelined again, Harbhajan Singh can expect to play alongside left-arm spinner Axar Patel who claimed career-best figures of 3-39 in the last match.
