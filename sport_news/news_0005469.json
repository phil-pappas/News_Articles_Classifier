Why?” he asked. \nWhen it was put to him that it was because Rooney is one of United’s star players, Van Gaal told his interlocutor: “Then you have to write it down. It is your opinion.” \nThe result left United in fourth place in the table, two points behind City and second-place Arsenal and below third-place West Ham United on goal difference. — AFP", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T01:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T01:35:34.593+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
