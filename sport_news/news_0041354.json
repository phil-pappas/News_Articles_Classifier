Simply put, a win will make all five teams playoff eligible, while a loss will bring the 2015 season to a close. \n\"It's a double-edged sword in my opinion,\" Nekoosa coach Jason Becker said. \"If you hype a game like this up too much it can backfire, but if you don't make it clear what the game means, you aren't preparing the kids either. \n\"We haven't hid from what the Westfield game means for us. It's not up to anyone other than us whether or not we win the game and make ourselves playoff eligible.\" \nOnly Rapids is at home, making the task at hand slightly more difficult for the other four teams. On the plus side, all but Pittsville are playing teams that have struggled all season. \nThe Panthers travel to Stratford a team they haven't beaten in quite some time, but anything can happen. Pittsville has, however, won three straight Marawood games and four of their last five games. Port Edwards, Nekoosa and A-F are playing teams with a combined three wins. \n\"This is certainly a game you hope to win and you need to be prepared,\" Becker said. \"I'm sure Westfield would love to beat us and end our season.\" \nDespite riding a three-game VFA-South skid, the Raiders are in a position to make the postseason due in part to a new conference rule that counted the second VFA crossover game as a league game. \n\"When it was discussed, I thought was a good idea and certainly wouldn't hurt any teams and it has helped us,\" Rapids coach Tony Biolo said. \nThe Raiders also caught a break when they got a win back from Oshkosh West. The Wildcats played with an ineligible player were forced for forfeit the games that the player participated in.

For us, the playoffs start a week early.\" \nThe vision is clear for these five teams. Now the task is to put it all together for one last game. The 48 minutes they play Friday will determine whether they get another week of practice and a 10th game. \nMark Massoglia can be reached at 715-423-7200, ext. 4736 or mark.massoglia@gannettwisconsin.com .
