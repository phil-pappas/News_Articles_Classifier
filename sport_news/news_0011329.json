The Mets manager instead was saving him to pitch in case Game 5 went to extra innings, and now he is the NLCS Game 1 starter.\nRemember when he had innings limits?\nBecause Collins had Noah Syndergaard warm up four times and ultimately pitch the seventh inning Thursday night in the Mets’ 3-2 clincher victory over the Dodgers, the righty was removed as the logical option to start NLCS Game 1 against Jon Lester and the Cubs on Saturday.\nCollins was leaning strongly toward using Syndergaard in relief Thursday, so already was plotting to start Harvey on regular four days’ rest if the Mets advanced.\nHarvey worked five innings and earned the win in Monday’s Game 3. That took him to 194 ¹/₃ innings in a season when his agent, Scott Boras, insisted the righty’s surgeon, Dr. James Andrews, and other prominent doctors believed exceeding 180 innings put Harvey in a danger zone for re-injury.\nBut Harvey apparently has embraced the idea of pitching regularly for as long as the Mets are in the playoffs, which means at least Game 1 — and theoretically Game 5 — against the Cubs. And then, if the Mets move to the World Series, at least one and possibly two more starts there.\n“It’s a huge honor,” Harvey said of getting the NLCS Game 1 nod. “I am very excited about it. I was a little disappointed in my last start, so getting another chance to go back out there and start us off right is everything I want.”\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google Whatsapp Email Filed under matt harvey ,  mlb playoffs ,  new york mets ,  noah syndergaard", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T04:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T12:13:22.865+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
