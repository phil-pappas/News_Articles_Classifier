It was closed Monday night for Game 3 of the ALCS, too, even though it was 57 degrees at first pitch â€” that's 12 degrees warmer than it was for Game 2 at Citi Field in New York for the Mets-Cubs NLCS game on Sunday. \n\"I was in New York on Saturday night and 12 degrees was not enough,\" Commissioner Rob Manfred said Tuesday. \nMajor League baseball determines if the roof will be open or closed for postseason games, and Manfred was at Rogers Centre for Game 4. He said it was raining earlier on his way to the ballpark. \n\"Why would you take a chance with a game this important. Now, whether it actually rains enough to interfere with play who knows but, again, when you have a roof why would you take a chance with it,\" he said. \"My general thinking on things like this is things like this is that the individual clubs locally know best what should happen in their stadium.\" \nThe Blue Jays were 38-14 with it open and 11-14 closed, and 4-0 with a combination of the two. \nCopyright 2015 KCTV (Meredith Corp.) and Associated Press.
