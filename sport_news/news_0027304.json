The Arizona native has played well in 2015, with Saturday no exception, but having freshman Kyler Murray on the bench is a difficult fact to ignore.\nEven more difficult to ignore is the performance Allen displayed Saturday against Nevada. In the first half alone the sophomore went 15-of-20 for 203 yards and 2 TD passes as well as another rushing TD on the ground.\nThe offensive line showed signs of weakness, forcing Allen to be more mobile in the second half. On the day he finished with 18 completions on 31 attempts for 270 yards and four passing (five total) touchdowns before giving way to Murray.\nMurray provides an excellent change-of-pace option for A&M. Saturday provided proof that this team most certainly belongs to Allen.\nA&M defense strong on third down: The A&M defense has Aggie fans referencing the \"Wrecking Crew\" for the first time in years as new defensive coordinator John Chavis has rejuvenated the squad on that side of the ball.\nCoach Brian Polian's Wolf Pack did not convert a third down until the third quarter of the game. On the day, they converted just four times on 16 attempts.\nA.J. Hilliard and Zaycoven Henderson returned to the team after serving two-game suspensions while senior tackle Julien Obioha played for the first time this season after undergoing an appendectomy.\nThe Wolf Pack managed to reel off a few long plays thanks to missed assignments from the Aggies, but overall, the A&M defense is far from the liability it has been in the past.\nGreat note from @tom_hart : Nevada simulated Myles Garrett's first step in practice by having DEs line up offside.\nâ€” Travis Haney (@TravHaneyESPN) September 19, 2015 Sophomore Myles Garrett of Arlington picked up 3.5 sacks on the afternoon including back-to-back sacks to force a punt in the fourth quarter. The Aggies managed 535 total yards while the Wolf Pack were held to 359.\nThe Aggies also recorded 16 tackles for loss on the afternoon.\nPlaying the full 60 minutes: While the Aggies have managed to avoid any true threat to their undefeated record thus far in the season, it has been a tale of two halves to say the least in 2015.\nA 21-point fourth quarter gave the Aggies a comfortable victory to start off the season against Arizona State after scoring 14 in the entire first half. Last week against Ball State, A&M was outscored 20-7 in the second half in a 56-23 win.\nAfter creating a 24-10 halftime lead on Saturday, the Aggies allowed the Wolf Pack to stick around in the second half. Nevada pushed the score to as close as 41-27 before ultimately falling in the contest.\nKirk is special: Freshman WR Christian Kirk had another big game for the Aggies, leading the offense with six catches for 120 yards including a 48-yard reception that was part of a three-play, 78-yard scoring drive for the Aggies that took just 1:07.\nKirk also took three kick returns for 72 yards to give him 192 total yards on the day.\nAnother performance of note was running back Tra Carson. The RB carried the rock 22 times for 137 total yards.\nA&M WR Josh Reynolds caught two of Allen's four TD passes on the day, good for 55 yards receiving.\nNext Up: With the victory, the Aggies claimed victory in their 19th consecutive non-conference game win.\nThe streak is good for the longest current run in the nation with the last loss occurring all the way back in 2011 with a 42-38 loss to Arkansas. During the streak, A&M has now defeated at least one member from every current FBS conference, with the Mountain West being the last to fall.\nThe streak will be put on pause as the Aggies take on Arkansas, now an SEC opponent, next week in Dallas to begin conference play. The game is currently set to begin at either 6 or 6:30 p.m. on Sept 26. The Aggies currently claim a three-game winning streak against the Razorbacks.\nFollow Brandon Wheeland on Twitter: @BrandonWheeland\nMORE TEXAS A&M COVERAGE\nHairopoulos: Garrett puts teeth in A&M's D; Ags overcome 'bad football' in 44-27 win over Nevada\nTexas A&M-Nevada notebook: Brandon Williams becomes Aggies' first two-way player since '70s\nFive Thoughts: Kyle Allen has five touchdowns; Myles Garrett 3.5 sacks in No. 17 Texas A&M's 44-27 victory over Nevada\nPhotos: Texas A&M dances day away in win over Nevada\nClick here to visit the Texas A&M page\nOn Twitter:\n @BrandonWheeland", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/TravHaneyESPN/status/645271787740069888", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesports/2015/09/19/photos-texas-dances-day-away-win-nevada", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/09/19/texas-nevada-notebook-brandon-williams-becomes-aggies-first-two-way-player-since-70s", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/09/19/five-thoughts-kyle-allen-five-touchdowns-myles-garrett-35-sacks-17-texas-ams-44-27-victory-nevada", "https://twitter.com/BrandonWheeland", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/texas-aggies", "http://twitter.com/brandonwheeland", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/09/19/hairopoulos-garrett-puts-teeth-ams-d-ags-overcome-bad-football-44-27-win-nevada", "https://twitter.com/tom_hart"], "published": "2015-09-19T22:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T14:42:48.330+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
