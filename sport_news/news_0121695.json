But he was hit, the ball popped free, Watts-Jackson caught it, avoided a few defenders in the final yards and made it into the end zone. \n\"A mistake was made,\" Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh said somberly. \"Mistakes were made. It's very unfortunate circumstances.\" Michigan State wide receiver R.J.

Michigan (5-2, 2-1) lost for the first time since opening the season with a setback at Utah. \nThe Wolverines were seconds away from sealing the win after Sione Houma ran for two TDs, Kenny Allen kicked three field goals and forcing the Spartans to turn the ball over on downs with 1:47 left at its 45.

(AP Photo/Carlos Osorio) \nThe Spartans had only one timeout left and used it after the next snap. Michigan had two and Harbaugh used both, including one with 10 seconds left to set up the final punt and discuss all options. \n\"If you go for it, you leave them with a Hail Mary opportunity,\" Harbaugh said. \"We could protect and throw a long pass. We ran through the scenarios and felt like the best decision was to punt. They didn't have any returners. It was a matter of punting it. We messed up.\" \nMichigan State moved the ball up and down the field against a team that had shut out three straight opponents, picking up 386 yards — mostly through the air — and 20 first downs.

Punter and backup quarterback Tyler O'Connor ran 7 yards on a fourth-and-8 from the Michigan State 31, turning the ball over on downs. \nMichigan took advantage, moving to a 17-7 lead early in the third quarter on Houma's 1-yard run. \n___", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T03:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T04:07:36.595+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
