Huh/AP Blackhawks fans welcome Patrick Kane as he continues to be the center of an ongoing sexual assault investigation. CHICAGO — Patrick Kane’s situation entering Wednesday night’s NHL opener against the Rangers remained uncomfortable, unusual and uncertain.\nUncomfortable because the Blackhawks’ star winger is under investigation for allegedly raping a woman at his Hamburg, N.Y., home in August. Unusual because Kane is in Chicago’s lineup despite the accusations. Uncertain because, while Kane has not been charged with a crime, the Erie County district attorney’s office continues to deliberate on whether to present to a grand jury.\nSo it was interesting to see none of this kept Kane from fielding questions openly at his United Center locker on Wednesday morning. He did not run from inquiries about how he is balancing his off-ice concerns with his on-ice responsibilities.\n“I feel good when I get to the rink, to be honest with you,” Kane, 26, said with a look of relief in describing his mental state. “That’s kind of like my little getaway from everything — coming here, being with the guys, playing hockey, doing the things that I love. So when I’m here I just try to focus on that.\nFOLLOW THE DAILY NEWS SPORTS ON FACEBOOK. \"LIKE\" US HERE\n“I’m excited to be playing hockey,” he added. “So I’ll just try to focus on that and let the other stuff handle itself.”\nKane’s actions could be perceived as staying poised in a difficult circumstance. Or they could be perceived as stubborn and defiant, like Kane’s September training camp proclamation that, “I am confident once all facts come to light I will be absolved,” before he dodged questions.\nTwo weeks ago, the investigation grabbed more headlines in the strangest twist yet. The accuser’s attorney, Thomas Eoannou, announced an empty evidence bag had been left in the doorway of the accuser’s mother’s home, only to recuse himself from the case the next day because “misrepresentations were made” in the mother’s claim of tampered evidence.\nEoannou’s announcements forced police and Erie County D.A. Frank Sedita to take the uncommon step of addressing an ongoing case publicly to clarify evidence had not been compromised and the mother seemingly had carried out a “hoax.”\nThe NHL is tracking the Kane investigation and undoubtedly would discipline him in a worst-case scenario. The Blackhawks and Kane clearly are trying to proceed normally, but nothing is normal or comfortable about an investigation with such serious allegations.\nOn Wednesday, Blackhawks coach Joel Quenneville praised Kane’s “good approach” and said his forward is “focusing the right way.” But Quenneville noticeably, and understandably, squirmed when asked if Kane’s approach might be tested when the team plays on the road in front of less-forgiving fans.\n“I couldn’t say,” Quenneville said. Then the coach’s eyes darted around the crowd of reporters surrounding him, anxious to change the subject.\nRelated Stories Rangers open season with 3-2 win over Blackhawks", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/NYDNSports"], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T10:42:46.207+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
