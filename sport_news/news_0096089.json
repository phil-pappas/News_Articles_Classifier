And that's what happens when you know you need to score three to win a game every single game, suddenly you can feel the anguish.\n\"They certainly have to step up to the mark because at this moment in time if he can get them anywhere near the top four he will be a miracle worker, he really will be.\"\nLiverpool is 10th in the Premier League standings on 13 points after winning three of its opening nine matches.\nThe Merseyside club is eight points adrift of leaders Manchester City and four behind West Ham, who occupy the fourth and final Champions League spot.\nMcManaman added: \"The manager's only been here a week so you can't necessarily blame him for the team's performance because he put out arguably his strongest side but it lacked a lot of intensity.\n\"The first two results haven't been great but you just hope that he's going to get a lot better, but the fact he has to wait until January to bring any of his own players is a long way off. And there's a lot harder games than tonight going to come up in front of him.\"\nLiverpool's next test comes at home to Southampton in the Premier League on Sunday.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "http://www.goal.com/en-us"], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T17:13:07.589+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
