It's unfortunate. Had this been Peyton Manning or Aaron Rodgers inadvertently captured naked on NFL Network cameras instead of Andrew Whitworth, Cincinnati's elite offensive tackle, I think the national reaction to a privacy invasion would have been quite different.\nWhitworth took to Twitter as his only defense after an interview with Adam Jones showed several Bengals players naked from behind.\n\"Why do I have to explain to my kids their dad is naked on TV? @nflcommish? @nflnetwork? Time for a media policy change,'' he tweeted.\nI can't argue with him at all. In fact, it might be surprising to learn that a lot of media people hate going into locker rooms to do their jobs after NFL games. You could include all leagues in this, I suppose, but really it's the size of NFL rosters (and players) and the crush of media covering their games is what makes the locker room situation so unworkable from our side and such an invasion of privacy from theirs.\nIf you're talking MLB or the NBA, this really isn't an ongoing issue beyond the fact that visitors' basketball and hockey locker rooms tend to be built unnecessarily small simply to inconvenience those teams.\nThe first Cowboys game I ever covered offered the best interview situation for the media and neatly avoided any privacy issues for the players. Simply put, the Cowboys closed their home locker room starting in 1978 as their answer to dealing with the issue of female reporters.\nIf that sounds insensitive, it wasn't. Or at least their response proved to be fair for everyone. Players were required to show up in a large room directly across the hall from their locker room. Some came in robes, some came in football gear. Some had already dressed.\nYou had Harvey Martin at a podium here, Billy Jo Dupree at a podium there, Tony Hill talking over in that corner. Whether you were looking for video or for Quote: s, it was ideal. On that first visit, I remember seeing the late Frank Luksa talking quietly with Tony Dorsett by himself. So I dare say that the great veteran reporters were still afforded the opportunity to get some one-on-one time.\nIn today's NFL locker room, there's still some time and space for the occasional one--on-ones but you're not going to get today's Tony Dorsetts by yourself too often.\nMeanwhile, the players must deal with a policy written long before every reporter walked into the locker room with their own video cameras. They're called phones. The incident with Whitworth was accidental on the part of the NFL's own network. It's happened before. Ask former Cowboys tackle La'Roi Glover about it.\nThose are just the accidents. It's not hard to conceive of someone getting credentialed who has other things in mind.\nWhitworth went on to make another obvious but important point.\n\"If I was a woman, this would be a completely different subject, and it would be a complete firestorm,'' he said.\nI don't know anyone who's arguing with that. No one is barging into the U.S. Open locker rooms after a 10-minute cooling off period to interview Maria Sharapova and Serena Williams draped in towels.\nIn a perfect world, every NFL team would create a room with podiums to copy what the Cowboys did throughout the '80s until they were forced to reopen their locker room. All we want is access and a few minutes, we really don't care if it's right next to a steam-filled shower with towels and athletic tape all around our feet. Of course, you would have to create a system in which the players actually have to show up or face fines.\nAnd from the players' side, although Whitworth is one of the few to speak out, it's an unpleasant atmosphere at best. The idea of \"they can wear a towel\" is usually spoken by those who've never seen what a visitors' NFL locker room is like, how the players are hurried to shed their pads, shower, change, dress and get to the bus while conducting interviews in a whirlwind of cameras and equipment carts.\nI'm trying to imagine covering myself with a towel while explaining to strangers every day why I've just lost to Woody Paige again and when I think that will change.\nOn second thought, I'm trying to remove that image.\nTwitter: @TimCowlishaw\nwhy do I have to explain to my kids why their dad is naked on tv? @nflcommish ?? @nflnetwork ??
