(AP) - Falcons center Mike Person, who left Sunday’s win over Washington with a sprained ankle, is expected to miss Thursday night’s game at New Orleans. \nFalcons coach Dan Quinn says “it’d be tough” for Person to return from the injury in a short practice week. \nJames Stone, who took over at center against Washington, is expected to start against the Saints. Gino Gradkowski will be Stone’s backup. \nQuinn said Monday he thinks wide receiver Julio Jones and linebacker Justin Durant will play against the Saints. Jones played through a hamstring injury in the 25-19 overtime win over the Redskins. Durant missed the game with an elbow injury. \nPerson, Durant and Jones did not participate in Monday’s practice. \n___ \nAP NFL website: www.pro32.ap.org and AP NFL Twitter feed: http://twitter.com/AP_NFL \nCopyright © 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T02:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T03:14:09.890+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
