So, all in all, they gave us a full calendar year of entertainment.\nWhen the 2015 season started, the team clearly wanted to put an end to the “only in even years” nonsense. To, at the very least, make the playoffs and attempt to defend their title rather than watch from the sideline. That didn't happen, in part because of injuries — including a startling number of concussions — in part because of reliance on a questionable rotation, and in part because of the calendar, which takes a toll. \nAll 162 games matter. Getting swept by Colorado at home in April? Two losses to Miami in May? The loss at Philadelphia in June? Who knows which games could have made the difference? (Yes, getting swept at Dodger Stadium a month ago was the biggest culprit).\nBut the season held plenty of revelations, mostly in the form of young men promoted to the big leagues long before their due date, who handled the situation with coolness and maturity. And that’s a good sign for the future.\nKevin Frandsen , who first came up with the Giants during the dog days of the end of the Barry Bonds era, told me how impressed he is with the Giants’ young players. He was with them with Triple-A Sacramento and, in recent days, with the Giants. He says they are professional, mature, high-quality people. So team vice president and head of scouting John Barr should take a bow because his system continues to reliably produce a certain type of player.\nThe Giants need more, of course. They need depth. They need outfielders. And they need to bust open their well-stocked vault and pull out the cash for a top-line pitcher: a David Price or Zack Greinke or another who can give the Giants another stud besides Madison Bumgarner at the top of the rotation. The Dodgers emphasized a point the Giants learned when Tim Lincecum and Matt Cain headed their rotation: Two aces are better than one.\nThe Giants have the money. They have needs. They have an even-year coming. Time to get busy.\nAnn Killion is a San Francisco Chronicle columnist.
