The setter has amassed 188 assists and 37 aces this year with the Knights who have won 14 matches through Oct. 1. Pace Academy has also earned wins in all six of their Area 3AA matches this campaign, securing an area championship.“The year has gone better than expected with a new group of players,” Botsch said. “We lost half of our team from last year. We had a hard start to the season figuring out the dynamics of the team. Recently, we’ve played well and its exciting.”Botsch credits activity on the court for her individual success.“I’ve gotten older and gained more experience which has made me a better player,” she said.“Meghan is one our leaders on and off the court as a co-captain,” Pace Academy coach Anna Bush said. “She spends more minutes on the court than anyone else on the team. She quarterbacks the team so our team success is directly tied to her.”With the Knights securing the top spot in its area and the state playoffs beginning next week, the team continues its preparations with hopes of a long postseason run.“We have a solid core of juniors which Meghan is a big part of,” Bush said. “We’ve had good leadership and a strong season overall. We’ve learned about ourselves and that’s showing in the latter part of the season.”Botsch plays for the Tsunami club volleyball team and is a service leader for Emmau’s House, an organization at Pace Academy that helps children in need in the community. She lists math as her favorite subject and plans to pursue a career working with children in the future..The Knights’ first-round opponent in the Class 2A state playoffs will be determined later this week.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T01:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T17:43:55.459+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
