And who knows what might happen? Misfortune. Drama. Disappointment. As a season of great expectations is about to get underway, the Ducks don’t want to get on their bad side.\nFinally, after every other team has opened its schedule, theirs is about to begin Saturday night in San Jose against the rival Sharks. The irony is they’re attempting to be the last one standing. And everyone else sees it that way.\nThere is a common thread running through the many media outlets that do the NHL season prediction thing. The Ducks will take the Western Conference and play for the Stanley Cup. And, to the opinion of many, they’ll hoist it for a second time and first since 2007.\nDucks coach Bruce Boudreau is armed and ready to toss his figurative bucket of cold water on that.\n“We haven’t won a game,” said Boudreau, who is in his fifth season as coach. “We haven’t done anything. People that are surmising or whatever the word is, what we’re suspposed to do. We’ve got to worry about ourselves on the ice and everything else will take care of itself.\n“Yeah, nothing’s there until it’s there. We’ve got to earn our way to the playoffs yet before we can start thinking about following up on that.”\nIt doesn’t stop the perception that this is a Cup-or-bust season for the Ducks.\n“It’s scary. It’s actually scary that too many people are picking us,” Ducks owner Henry Samueli said Friday. “You don’t want that pressure. It’s not fair to the players, not fair to the coaches.\n“You just want them to focus on winning the next game and move on. Get into the palyoffs first, that’s always the first goal. And then try for a deep run.”\nOther top contenders have their questions. The Ducks have theirs but it appears that they have fewer.\nChicago has the talent to repeat. But the Blackhawks lost defenseman Johnny Oduya to free agency and dealt scoring forwards Brandon Saad and Patrick Sharp. And there is the hovering sexual assault investigation over star Patrick Kane.\nThe Kings? Missing the playoffs has the two-time champs motivated but they’ve let some locker-room leaders walk and have a suspect defense beyond Drew Doughty. St. Louis is deep but still has to wonder if goalies Brian Elliott or Jake Allen can bring it a Cup. Calgary, Nashville and Winnipeg must prove they’re more than a nice story.\nDucks general manager Bob Murray replaced veteran defenseman Francois Beauchemin with Kevin Bieksa, gritty secondary scorer Matt Beleskey with Carl Hagelin, young forwards Kyle Palmieri and Emerson Etem with veteran experience (Shawn Horcoff, Chris Stewart and Mike Santorelli).\nThe rest of the defense is intact, as is the goaltending. And they still have nearly $8 million of cap space to address any issues that crop up during the season.\n“The pieces are definitely in place,” defenseman Cam Fowler said. “But that’s all they really are right now, pieces. I’m sure there’s been teams along the way, you look at them on paper and everyone picks them to win. But it doesn’t work out that way.\n1 2 Next Page", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T05:41:43.880+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
