Greg Abbott after he prematurely celebrated the Houston Astros winning the AL Division Series over the Royals.\nWith Houston up four runs and six outs away Monday from finishing off Kansas City, the office of the Republican governor tweeted congratulations to the Astros for advancing to the AL Championship Series. The Royals then rallied in the eighth inning and forced a decisive Game 5 with a 9-6 victory.\nThe tweet has since been deleted.\nFans and the major newspapers in Texas accused the governor of jinxing the Astros with his tweet.\nAbbott, who is an avid Twitter user, responded to the gaffe by telling Astros fans to unfollow his office and stick to his personal Twitter account. He tweeted: \"No predictions. Just support.\"\nHey @Astros fans. Unfollow --> @GovAbbott . Follow the REAL Greg Abbott right here. No predictions. Just support.\n— Greg Abbott (@GregAbbott_TX) October 12, 2015 Abbott spokesman John Wittman said the deleted tweet was sent by a staffer and declined further comment.\nKansas Gov. Sam Brownback quickly pounced on his fellow Republican's faux pas.\nCongrats to the #Royals ! Not so fast, my friend, @GovAbbott . See you Wednesday. #TaketheCrown pic.twitter.com/SV1wb6Iadl \n— Sam Brownback (@govsambrownback) October 12, 2015 Game 5 is Wednesday at Kauffman Stadium in Kansas City. The stadium is just a stone's throw from Independence where Truman hailed from.\nAnother tweet involving the Royals also made sports headlines Monday. The Kansas City Police Department declared it was a crime when Major League Baseball replay officials decided that Terrance Gore was out while stealing third.\nThat call on Gore was a crime.\n— Kansas City Police (@kcpolice) October 12, 2015 \nCopyright 2015 KCTV (Meredith Corp.) and Associated Press.
