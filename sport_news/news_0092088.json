Here are some highlights.\nOn if he sees Texas A&M as a possible playoff contender:\n\"I do if they can continue to be explosive as they are on offense running the football. I think that's kind of one of the things that has kind of gone under the radar watching this football team. I know everybody is talking about their defense and improvement under John Chavis and that's legit and how Kyle Allen is playing and that's true too. But I really believe the SEC especially is a line-of-scrimmage league, especially in that division in the West. It's hard to go week-in, week-out if you can not at some point establish some sort of consistency up front at the line of scrimmage. So I think the job that new offensive line coach Dave Christensen has done in kind of reestablishing a more physical mindset, I think has shown up on tape early this year. And I'm really interested to see when A&M gets into the SEC schedule against some of these defenses with fabulous front-sevens if they can be more physically dominant. If they can, then I think there really is a legit shot that maybe Texas A&M could be one of those surprise final-four teams.\"\nOn if Texas Tech has a chance to upset TCU this weekend:\n\"I think they do I think riding that emotion after a big win. I'm not so sure how many people really thought that Texas Tech would, A, win the game against Arkansas and, B, win the game as handily as they did even though Arkansas did struggle the week before. I think that Kliff Kingsbury has really injected a confidence over the years that he's coached that team and I think heading into a massive showdown with TCU, which I think you can expect to be a massive shootout. I mean, set your gasporme clock for four-and-a-half hours. There could be as many as 120 passes set in that game, one I'm very excited to see especially now that Trevone Boykin has played so much better these last two weeks. There were a lot of people who were really down on TCU after their road win over Minnesota, which I didn't really understand. I watched the game; Trevone Boykin missed two wide-open guys in the end zone which he hits every other Saturday. I still like TCU in that game but no doubt about it with a confident Texas Tech team I think they could give them a run and I think that could be one of the big shakeups early this season in college football.\"\nOn if he considers Baylor the favorite in the Big 12 after all of TCU's injuries:\n\"I still like TCU. I know they were very young coming into the season defensively, there was a lot of inexperience but when I think about a Gary Patterson-coached team, I kind of classify them in the same category as an Ohio State or an Alabama with respect to reloading on that side of the football because of how good Gary Patterson is. And even though Dick Bumpas left the team as the defensive coordinator I just think they do such a good job recruiting guys, developing guys, even if they're young putting them on the field and excelling. I know they've had injuries at key positions, there's no doubt about it, but I just think the team is playing with a chip on its shoulder, not just from getting snubbed last year out of the College Football Playoff. It's not like they went and blew up Ole Miss and forgot about it. I really think that's something they're going to carry with them for the rest of the year. Without playing a Big 12 championship game with a weak non-conference schedule certainly TCU after what happened last year understands how big of a game that is if and when they play against Baylor. I still think now, as good as Oklahoma's looked early in the Big 12 and as good as Baker Mayfield's looked, I still like TCU in the Big 12.\"\nOn his takeaways from Texas' loss to California:\n\"Well I think you have to look at positives and I think you have to look at the things they finally did well (like) the offensive explosion with Jerrod Heard running and throwing the football and the tempo at which they were able to play at and how they were able to stay balanced in adding a new element and dimension. As a player it's never easy to lose and especially when you fight and you go through the momentum shifts and the comeback they did in the fourth quarter. I think it was 20 points and to get yourself in position to beat what has become a steadily-improving and I think legitimate Cal team and I think it's disheartening (for Texas players). It's easier for a coaching staff and I think it is easier for fans maybe to see the light and maybe the trajectory that this team is on. Certainly it's hard for seniors in that locker room that know this is their last chance, every win counts for whatever goal you set in front of you whether it is bowl game, Big 12 championship, playoff, whatever it is, those games hurt, there's no doubt about that. But I would urge Texas fans and especially the players inside that locker room to try and find the positives in that performance, at least on offense, because they've come a long way from where they were in South Bend three weeks ago.\"\nOn Twitter:\n @SportsDayDFW", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/SportsDayDFW"], "published": "2015-09-25T06:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T05:40:15.832+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
