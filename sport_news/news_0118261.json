(Photo: AP) \nSAN DIEGO — Ian Kennedy struck out 11 in what was likely his final start with San Diego and Yangervis Solarte hit a two-run homer for the Padres, who beat Milwaukee 3-1 in their home finale on Thursday. \nThe Padres underachieved this year, extending their postseason drought to nine seasons despite a roster overhaul that included adding stars such as Matt Kemp, Justin Upton, Wil Myers, Derek Norris and James Shields. San Diego will finish with a losing record for the fifth straight season. \nKennedy (9-15) is eligible to become a free agent. He was stellar, allowing only one run and five hits in six innings, with no walks. His only mistake was allowing a leadoff homer in the sixth to pinch-hitter Shane Peterson. \nCraig Kimbrel pitched the ninth for his 39th save. \nMyers left the game with a sore left wrist. Before the game, the Padres said Upton has a strained neck. Although Upton hasn’t been ruled out for the season’s final series at the Los Angeles Dodgers, there’s no reason for him to play. Kemp won’t play again due to a strained right middle finger. He was hurt Tuesday night. \nSolarte homered to right off Taylor Jungmann (9-8) in the third, his 14th. Cory Spangenberg was aboard on a leadoff walk. \nSpangenberg hit an RBI single in the fourth. \nJungmann allowed three runs and four hits in three innings, walked four and struck out two. \nMilwaukee’s Michael Reed was thrown out by rookie right fielder Travis Jankowski trying to score from second on Hernan Perez’s single to end the third. \nUP NEXT \nBrewers: RHP Ariel Pena (2-0, 3.91 ERA) is scheduled to start the opener of the final home series against the Chicago Cubs, who counter with RHP Jake Arrieta (21-6, 1.82). \nPadres: Casey Kelly (0-1, 9.00) is scheduled to make his second start of the season when San Diego opens its final three-game series against NL West champion Los Angeles at Dodger Stadium on Friday night.
