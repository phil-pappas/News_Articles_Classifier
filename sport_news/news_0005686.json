Heck, you barely finish in the top half of your office fantasy league. But you have watched the Red Sox over these past six months, so you're used to watching Miley complete at least five innings, give up between two and four runs, and win as often as he loses. As surely as the sun rises and sets, that's what Miley does every fifth day from April through September.\nAnd if you're the Red Sox, there should be a certain comfort in that.\nIn a season in which high-profile -- and highly paid -- additions Hanley Ramirez, Pablo Sandoval and Rick Porcello did more harm than good, Miley was pretty much what the Sox expected, almost down to the last drop. In his 32nd and final start of the season, he sailed through four innings before encountering trouble in a three-run fifth.\nAnd while it was the low end of Miley’s usual performance range -- only five innings, four runs allowed -- it also could've been much worse. Miley left the game tied by getting lefty-hitting Didi Gregorius to fly out with the bases loaded, and the Red Sox wound up winning, 9-5, albeit six innings later.\nTo paraphrase a pop star by the same surname, it was Miley being Miley.\n“We won,” Miley said. “It probably wasn’t the way I wanted to finish, but I was able to battle out there and keep it at four (runs).”\nBut here’s the biggest thing: For a fourth consecutive season, the 28-year-old lefty topped 29 starts and 190 innings (he finished with 193-2/3), putting him in a class of only nine pitchers who have hit those statistical markers four years running. The others: Mark Buehrle, Madison Bumgarner, R.A. Dickey, Cole Hamels, Felix Hernandez, James Shields, Jordan Zimmermann and old friend Jon Lester.\nNot bad company.\nIndeed, think of Miley as the anti-Clay Buchholz. While Buchholz is liable to pitch like one of the best starters in baseball for two months every year, he's also bound to spend a month or two (or three) on the disabled list. Miley's 4.46 ERA isn't going to win any Cy Young awards, but spread out over nearly 200 innings, it's going to keep you in plenty of games, which is all anyone really asks of a middle-of-the-rotation starter.\nNow, ask yourself this: Who would you rather have -- Buchholz or Miley?\nIt isn't crazy to say Miley.\nEven advanced metrics are torn on the subject. According to Baseball-Reference.com, Miley entered last night with a 2.8 WAR, tied with Buchholz for the best among Red Sox pitchers. (Rookie lefty Eduardo Rodriguez was close behind at 2.5 WAR).\nAnd there's a decent chance the Red Sox will have to choose between Miley and Buchholz this winter.\nIn all likelihood, the No. 1 item on president of baseball operations Dave Dombrowski's offseason agenda is finding a No. 1 starter. With the Marlins, Dombrowski signed Kevin Brown as a free agent. With the Tigers, he made trades to acquire Max Scherzer, Doug Fister and even David Price. The Red Sox lack a proven ace, and Dombrowski understands the importance of having one.\nBeyond that, 22-year-old Rodriguez is all but guaranteed a spot in the 2016 rotation after becoming the first Red Sox rookie to post a sub-4.00 ERA in at least 20 starts since Casey Fossum in 2002. Dombrowski loves power pitchers, and right-hander Joe Kelly, arbitration-eligible for the first time this winter and with as much upside as anyone on the Sox' staff, fits that description.\nAnd if Dombrowski had an inclination to trade Porcello, it's doubtful he would be able to find a team willing to take on the four-year, $82.5 million extension that kicks in beginning next year.\nThat would leave young lefty Henry Owens, Miley and presumably Buchholz to compete for one spot. The Sox will almost certainly exercise their option on Buchholz' contract, but that doesn't mean they can't still trade him, especially with a $13 million salary that will make him relatively affordable given the rising price for pitching. There would be interest in Miley, too, considering he's under control for $6.17 million next season and $8.92 million in 2017.\nSo, it could well come down to this: Would you rather have Buchholz' All-Star-level performance for about 100 innings next season or Miley's durable, steadily unspectacular reliability for 200 innings?\nAt least with Miley you would know what you’re getting.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T19:30:39.361+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
