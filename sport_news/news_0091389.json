There was nothing the former Bournemouth man could do to keep out Vokes' brilliant 25-yard volley, but luckily the crossbar came to the Millers' rescue.Despite having Camp to thank for keeping them in it, the Millers could have gone into the break on level terms as Tom Heaton - named in Roy Hodgson's England squad yesterday - had to be at his best to keep out a low Matt Derbyshire effort.Rotherham offered plenty of bluster after the restart and had a golden chance to get level in the 53rd minute as Jonson Clarke-Harris robbed Darikwa, but his lay-off to Tony Andreu was slightly behind him and the on-loan Norwich man could not make a proper contact with his shot.They continued to control the game, though, and their reward came in the 75th minute as they levelled with a goal-of-the-season contender.Chris Maguire spread the ball out to the left, Joe Mattock laid off to Ward and he arrowed an unstoppable effort from 25 yards into the top corner, which even Heaton could do nothing about.But their joy was short-lived as Burnley hit back five minutes later when Vokes poked home from close range after Camp could not hold Scott Arfield's effort.The Millers could not find a repeat of Ward's quality and the Clarets saw it out for a second away win of the campaign.
