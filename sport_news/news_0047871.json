Seven clubs are 3-0, while six others sit at 2-1.\nAdChoices Life is good if your team has two or three wins. But over half the league isn’t feeling quite as giddy as Week 4 approaches.\nHere is one bright spot for every team sitting at 1-2 or 0-3:\nBaltimore Ravens (0-3): WR Steve Smith\n© Jeff Haynes/AP Photo Baltimore Ravens wide receiver Steve Smith signals during an NFL game against the Cleveland Browns at the FirstEnergy Stadium in Cleveland on Sept. 21. The 36-year-old has started his final NFL season ranked third in receiving yards (349) and fifth in receptions (25).\nChicago Bears (0-3) : OLB Pernell McPhee\nOnly two 3-4 outside linebackers—Von Miller and DeMarcus Ware—have more total pressures than the 18 produced by Chicago’s prized free-agent acquisition.\nCleveland Browns (1-2): P Andy Lee\nCleveland dealt for the veteran punter this past offseason, and he’s delivered the NFL’s best net punting average (47.6 yards) and the second-best average (54.3) through three games.\nDetroit Lions (0-3) : RB Ameer Abdullah\nThe rookie running back doesn’t have huge yardage totals (82 rushing, 72 receiving), but he’s found the end zone in two of his first three games.\nHouston Texans (1-2): LB Jadeveon Clowney\n© Thomas B. Shea/Getty Images Jadeveon Clowney #90 of the Houston Texans looks at the score board on the sidelines while the Houston Texans play against the Atlanta Falcons in a pre-season NFL game on August 16, 2014 at NRG Stadium in Houston, Texas. He’s still working his way back as a pass-rusher, but the former No. 1 overall pick has been a monster against the run—just ask Doug Martin .\nIndianapolis Colts (1-2): WR Donte Moncrief\nThrough three games, the second-year receiver is out-producing Andre Johnson by 10 catches, 149 yards and three touchdowns.\nJacksonville Jaguars (1-2): LB Paul Posluszny\nThe veteran linebacker leads the NFL in total tackles (34), and his interception of Cam Newton represents Jacksonville’s only takeaway this season.\nKansas City Chiefs (1-2): S Eric Berry\nTight end Travis Kelce is slowly becoming Gronk 2.0, and Justin Houston remains a pass-rushing animal, but Berry beating cancer and returning to the NFL as a difference-making player is still the best story of 2015.\nMiami Dolphins (1-2): WR Rishard Matthews\n© Alan Diaz/AP Photo Miami Dolphins wide receiver Rishard Matthews, left, pulls a pass intended for cornerback Brent Grimes on July 27 in Davie, Fla. Miami drafted DeVante Parker, traded for Kenny Stills and signed Greg Jennings, but it’s Matthews who leads the Dolphins in receiving yards (262), touchdowns (three) and catches over 20 yards (four).\nNew Orleans Saints (0-3) : LB Hau’oli Kikaha\nThe rookie leads New Orleans in sacks (two) and forced fumbles (two), and he’s been surprisingly good against the run.\nNew York Giants (1-2): WR Odell Beckham, Jr.\nHe’ll play his 16th game in the NFL in Week 4. His 15-game numbers: 110 catches, 1,574 yards and 15 touchdowns.\nPhiladelphia Eagles (1-2): RB Darren Sproles\nThe jitterbug back has rushed for 53 more yards than DeMarco Murray, caught more passes than any Eagle save for Jordan Matthews and also returned a punt for a touchdown.\nSan Diego Chargers (1-2): WR Keenan Allen\n© Getty Images MINNEAPOLIS, MN - SEPTEMBER 27: Keenan Allen #13 of the San Diego Chargers celebrates after catching a pass for a touchdown against the Minnesota Vikings in the second quarter at TCF Bank Stadium on September 27, 2015 in Minneapolis, Minnesota. (Photo by Adam Bettcher/Getty Images) After a somewhat disappointing sophomore season, Allen has 29 catches in three games—putting him on pace to haul in 155 in 2015.\nSan Francisco 49ers (1-2): RB Carlos Hyde\nThe second-year back has just 94 rushing yards over the last two weeks, but he’s still third in the NFL with 262 over the first three weeks.\nSeattle Seahawks (1-2): WR Tyler Lockett\nThe rookie has more combined return yards (344) and return touchdowns (two; 105-yard kick return, 57-yard punt return) than any player in football.\nSt. Louis Rams (1-2): DL Aaron Donald\nIf any player can reach Watt-like levels on defense, it’s probably Donald—who is the highest graded player at Pro Football Focus through three weeks.\nTampa Bay Buccaneers (1-2): DE Jacquies Smith\n© Wesley Hitt/Getty Images Drew Brees of the New Orleans Saints is hit by Jacquies Smith of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers during the first quarter of a game at the Mercedes-Benz Superdome on Sept. 20 in New Orleans. The 25-year-old defensive end leads the NFL in sacks (four), putting him on pace for 21 in 2015.\nTennessee Titans (1-2): QB Marcus Mariota\nThere have been a few bumps in the road, but no one could have expected the former Heisman Trophy winner to play this well (eight touchdowns, 109.2 passer rating) to start his rookie season.\nWashington Redskins (1-2): TE Jordan Reed\nRookie running back Matt Jones looks like a keeper, but Reed’s 241 receiving yards rank third amongst tight ends, and only Gronk has more catches over 20 yards.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["https://vine.co/v/eQ71QX9ubJ0", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-09-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T11:20:26.692+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
