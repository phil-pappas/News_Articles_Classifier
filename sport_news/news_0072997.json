And then, as he was walking out the door, he said, 'Dad, I got this.' \"\nHours later, Benny Walls' no-nonsense approach paid big dividends for St. Joseph's Prep in its Catholic League Class AAAA football opener against archrival La Salle.\nWalls broke free for a pair of long touchdowns at running back, and the Hawks pulled way from the Explorers down the stretch and easily triumphed, 49-24, before a packed and energized crowd at Plymouth Whitemarsh.\n The 6-foot, 205-pound senior was also involved in seven tackles - six solos - at free safety. Projected to play defensive back in college, he has scholarship offers from Boston College, Syracuse, Temple, and Rutgers.\nEarly in the second quarter, Walls found daylight near the Prep's sideline and raced to a 66-yard score that put the quick-starting Hawks ahead, 28-7.\n\"Our left tackle [Charlie Holsopple] pushed a guy down and created an opening for me,\" said Walls, who carried six times for 82 yards. \"Our O-line made it easy for me all day.\"\nThe Prep (4-2 overall) allowed La Salle to rally by committing three turnovers. The Explorers (3-3) turned two of them directly into scores and closed the once-sizable gap to 28-24 on Matt Savage's 36-yard field goal midway through the third quarter.\n\"It's uncharacteristic of us,\" Hawks coach Gabe Infante said of the miscues. \"But we're very inexperienced. We have some young guys playing key roles for us.\"\nIn the final seconds of the third quarter, Walls grabbed a left-side screen toss from Kevin Shaw, found space along the same sideline, and left a pack of defenders in his wake en route to a 68-yard tally.\nWalls transferred to the Prep from Camden Catholic before last school year. His father and uncle, Kevin, shined in hoops at Camden. Kevin Walls averaged 44.8 points in his senior year, including 81 in one game, and went on to play at Louisville.\nOf his father, Benny Walls said, \"He supports me in everything I do. Whenever I get tired or lazy, he makes sure I get back on track. I don't know what I'd do without him.\"\nThe Hawks' D'Andre Swift carried 22 times for 158 yards and a pair of fourth-quarter touchdowns.\nJunior tailback Syaire Madden sparked La Salle's comeback with touchdown bursts of 10, 4, and 7 yards.\nSt. Joseph's Prep 21 7 7 14 - 49\nLa Salle 7 7 10 0 - 24\nSJP: Darryle Simmons 27 pass from Kevin Shaw (kick failed)\nSJP: Joe DuMond 9 run (DuMond pass from Shaw)\nLS: Syaire Madden 10 run (Matt Savage kick)\nSJP: Terrence Greene 89 kickoff return (Alex Talbot kick)\nSJP: Benny Walls 66 run (Talbot kick)\nLS: Madden 4 run (Savage kick)\nLS: Madden 7 run (Savage kick)\nLS: FG Savage 36\nSJP: Walls 68 pass from Shaw (Talbot kick)\nSJP: D'Andre Swift 13 run (Talbot kick)\nSJP: Swift 39 run (Talbot kick)\nrobrien@phillynews.com\n@ozoneinq\nwww.philly.com/ozone", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T07:29:40.124+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
