Jim Bunning. \nWhen the talks take place far away from the roar of Commonwealth Stadium, they are much longer and more detailed and Towles can compare notes with his grandfather about what it's like to have every move scrutinized, every decision dissected. \n\"He's been through everything possibly that could be in Congress and the Senate, and the House, and Major League Baseball,\" Towles said of his grandfather. \nAnd what have those talks yielded? \n\"There's always going to be people who want to see you fail and the higher up you get, the more people care about it,\" the UK quarterback concluded. \nWatching and learning from Bunning probably has helped Towles navigate the choppy waters of being a Kentucky kid and starting quarterback for the state's flagship university. \nBut as Towles has learned, not much can prepare a person for that. \n\"You want to convince yourself that you know what it's going to be like, but you can't,\" he said Tuesday, just a few days after he helped UK bounce back from a 14-point deficit with seven minutes to go and top Eastern Kentucky 34-27 in overtime. \nThe game was kind of a microcosm of Towles' inconsistencies since winning the position last fall. The junior completed just 52.6 percent of his passes in the first half as the offense sputtered, including two interceptions. \nIn the second half, Towles led the Cats, who will face Auburn on Thursday night at Commonwealth Stadium, on three straight scoring drives. He completed 82.6 percent of his passes after the break, connecting on 19 of 23. \nThose throws, those huge throws, including the game-tying pass to Dorian Baker on a fade route on fourth-and-3 with the game on the line, are the reason that Kentucky's coaches offered a high vote of confidence for the junior quarterback from Fort Thomas. \n\"The kid has made some big boy plays this year. Huge,\" offensive coordinator Shannon Dawson said of Towles, who is second in the Southeastern Conference in passing plays of 20 or more yards with 22 of them. The junior quarterback has nine plays for 30-plus yards. \nBoth Dawson and head coach Mark Stoops have fielded questions from fans and media alike about replacing Towles. \nAnd both Stoops and Dawson made it clear Tuesday that this bye week would not be spent reassessing the quarterback position. \n\"I think it's pretty clear where I'm at on it, or we would've made some changes during the game,\" Stoops said of calls for backup Drew Barker to get in the game. \"I'm very glad I didn't, because I like the result, I like the outcome of that game.\" \nDoes Towles need to get more consistent? \"Absolutely,\" Stoops said. \"Just like every other position on our team.\" \nSome of the reason for Towles' inconsistencies rest on his fellow inconsistent teammates playing for a young offense that didn't play a single senior on Saturday. \n\"There's a lot of things that go into it,\" Stoops said. \"Nobody likes to talk about those things anymore. It's always on the quarterback. That's what I told the team: Fortunately we won the game or there would've been a big bull's-eye on a lot of people, and starting with me.\" \nDawson said he's never waffled in his support of Towles, who is sixth in the league in passing yards per game with 230.6 and seventh in completion percentage at 61.5. \nThe offensive coordinator described the throw Towles made to Blake Bone while running to his right and throwing the ball across his body to find Bone nearly 40 yards away as impressive. \n\"I haven't been around too many people who can make that throw,\" Dawson said. \nHe wondered aloud when people would stop picking apart the quarterback. \"I don't understand where all the question marks come from; they're definitely not from me.\" \nTowles was happy to hear he had his coaches' seal of approval, noting that they're the only voices he listens to about football. \n\"If I'm not getting it done, then I expect as with any other position that there should be a change,\" Towles said. \"I'm a Kentucky fan and if I'm not the person that's going to make this team the best it is then I don't need to play.\" \nAnd in the meantime, he'll look into the crowd for a fellow Kentucky fan who understands the scrutiny even better than the quarterback.
