The Tiger men scored 682 points, winning the meet with ease over second place Missouri State (365 points). On the women’s side, the Tigers scored 711 points, far ahead of Drury University, which scored 346. \nThe meet started out with the women’s and men’s 200-yard medley relay. For the women, junior backstroker Nadine Laemmler, senior breaststroker Abby Duncan, senior butterflier Anna Patterson and sophomore Rachel Hayden won the event with a time of 1:42.42. Mizzou relay teams also finished in second, third and sixth place. \nJust like the women, the Tiger men had relays finish in first, second, third and sixth in the relay. The winning team consisted of senior backstroker Dillon Love, junior breaststroker Fabian Schwingenschlogl, junior butterflier Andrew Sansoucie and junior freestyler Michael Chadwick. \nIn the 200-yard freestyle, sophomore Kira Zubar brought home the win for the Tiger women. Freshman Mikel Schreuders won the men’s race, finishing with a time of 1:39.91. \nCoach Greg Rhodenbaugh said that Schreuders’ swim is very promising. \n“It was the first time I’ve had someone break 1:40 in the first meet,” he said. \nSansoucie was also impressed with the freshman’s time, describing his teammate as a “monster.” \nThe men’s 200-yard individual medley was the first event of the day where a non-Mizzou swimmer won an event. After Ross’ win for the women, Missouri State senior Uvis Kalnins won the men’s race. Schwingenschlogl finished in second place. \nDrury junior Wen Xu took the women’s 50-yard freestyle, beating Mizzou freshman Maddie Gehrke by over two-tenths of a second. Chadwick won the men’s event with a time of 20.27, almost a half second ahead of Sansoucie. \nSansoucie, however, would earn himself a first place finish in the very next event. The junior won the 100-yard butterfly with a time of 48.88. Sansoucie felt that his swim was a big step forward from where he was in past seasons. \n“I think if you looked at least the physical shape that I was in last season or two seasons ago, I would’ve put up much slower times and it would have hurt a lot more,” he said. \nIn the same event, sophomore Erin Metzger-Seymour won the women’s race by over one second. \nSophomore Hannah Stevens picked up her first victory of the day in the women’s 100-yard freestyle. In the men’s event, Chadwick found himself victorious for a third time, winning with a time of 44.20. \nZubar continued to dominate in distance events. She won the 500-yard freestyle and was the only woman to finish under the five minute mark. On the men’s side, Lindenwood senior Sylwester Borowicz-Skoneczny narrowly beat Mizzou junior Nick Davis. \nThe Truman State Bulldogs defeated the Tigers in the women’s 200-yard freestyle relay. The Mizzou team of Hayden, Gehrke, freshman Aurore Jacolin and Stevens took second. On the men’s side, sophomore Jordy Groters, junior Christian Aragona, Sansoucie and Schwingenschlogl teamed up to win the event for the Tigers. \nStevens earned her second victory of the day in the 100-yard backstroke, finishing just ahead of Laemmler. \n“Hannah Stevens always stands out … she brings a lot of energy to the team in the pool and out of the pool, so that’s definitely something we need,” Ross said. \nFor the men, junior Carter Griffin won the event for the men, finishing with a time of 49.80. \nRoss had another strong swim in the women’s 100-yard breaststroke, finishing in second place. Duncan won the race with a time of 1:00.56. \nSchwingenschlogl wrote his name into the Mizzou record books in the men’s 100-yard breaststroke. He posted the eighth-fastest time in Mizzou history for the event and was victorious by nearly two seconds over teammate Eddie Mapel. \nThe Tiger swimmers wrapped up the day by winning both 400-yard freestyle relays. Patterson, freshman Courtney Evensen, Metzger-Seymour and junior Ellie Suek earned the win for the women. Chadwick, Schreuders, senior Levi Hanks and Griffin finished first on the men’s side. \nMizzou swept the diving events. Freshman Kyle Goodwin won the men’s 3-meter competition, while sophomore Alexa Beckwith took home the women’s 3-meter title. Senior Clark Thomas won the men’s 1-meter diving event and freshman Payton Conrad took first for the women. \nThe Tigers are back in action against Tennessee on Thursday, Oct. 15 at the Mizzou Aquatic Center.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T08:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T10:03:57.626+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
