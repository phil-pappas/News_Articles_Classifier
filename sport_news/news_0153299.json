PGA 1 day ago John Holmes © Provided by PGA\nAs long as there are people with imaginations, there will be new variations of golf. The newest one I've run across: Drone Golf. Yes, that's playing golf using a drone. Drone golf is the invention of a man named John Mendonca, a retired electrical engineer who lives in Las Vegas and has been tinkering with the concept at Las Vegas Country Club. \"I always loved remote control stuff, and this is even more fun,\" Mendonca told KLAS-TV in Las Vegas . WATCH: 5-year-old has winning game and personality | Korda sisters \"power up\" for wins The object of his game is pretty simple. You equip a drone with a cup big enough to hold a golf ball, then fly your drone over a golf hole. When you think your drone is directly over the hole, you have the drone drop the ball. There's no putting or anything after you drop. Your score is determined by the number of inches your ball comes to rest away from the flagstick. It's just that simple. And that's why his slogan for his game is \"Fly – drop – win.\" Mendonca is still developing his concept for the game, and so far has restricted it to the practice range at Las Vegas CC. He does, however, have some big ideas. \"I hope to have a professional drone golf association,\" he told the TV station, \"where people from all around the world can come to compete for prize money.\"\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.pga.com/news/golf-buzz/korda-sisters-both-win-tournaments-after-powering-teebox", "http://www.pga.com/news/golf-buzz/5-year-old-jason-soong-has-winning-golf-game-and-winning-personality", "http://www.lasvegasnow.com/news/game-using-drones-to-play-golf-hopes-to-take-off-in-vegas"], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T03:58:54.498+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
