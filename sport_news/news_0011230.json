The Pioneers’ goal narrowed the Tigers’ lead to 2-1, but a controversial penalty kick put the match away for the Tigers as La Grande came away with a 3-1 win. Edgar Facio fired the Pioneers’ first blast three minutes into the match. But Tigers goalkeeper Jon Gonzalez batted it away. On the ensuing corner kick — the first of three first-half Pioneer corner kicks to none for La Grande — the Tigers’ 6-foot, 6-inch defenseman Kale Weis headed it away. A down-field pass along the left side from Cristian Miramontes to Blaine Kreutz set the Tigers up in the 13th minute. Kreutz put his left foot shot into the right corner and the Tigers grabbed a 1-0 lead. Miguel Rodriguez, despite being whistled for offsides on more than one occasion, proved to be a Pioneer threat. He won a corner in the 25th minute, created a threat off a Miguel Perez deep throw in the 23rd, and blasted a shot off the side of the net with 8:30 left in the half. Rodriguez battled to another Pioneer corner with less than two minutes left. La Grande defended the Pioneer corner and the Tigers took the 1-0 advantage to intermission. “We let them live,” Pioneer coach Jose Garcia said. “They came back and beat us. We should’ve finished it earlier.” The Tigers’ Weis played a deep ball down the left side for Kreutz to open the second half. Kreutz beat Pioneer goalkeeper Andres Urbera to the ball and Kreutz fired his second goal of the night into the right corner of the net for a 2-0 Tiger lead with 39 minutes left. In the 44th minute, Rodriguez controlled the ball in front of the Tiger net, but his shot was blocked. The Mac-Hi pressure remained and Kristopher Carillo blasted a shot over the net seconds later. Mac-Hi kept coming, as the combination of Rodriguez-to-Ezri Correa-to-Juan Salazar resulted in a Salazar blast that Gonzalez made a diving one arm save in the 69th minute. Mac-Hi goalie Humberto Villagomez, who entered the match in the second half, blocked a howitzer off the foot of Kreutz in the 63rd minute to keep the Pioneers close. The Pioneers broke through as Rodriguez found Salazar on a break-away feed, and Salazar buried his shot into the lower-right corner and Mac-Hi was within 2-1 with 7:46 to play. “You can’t win games like that,” Garcia said of missed opportunities. “We should’ve had two early goals and just kept pressuring them. We should’ve done a lot better. Once we blocked their speed on the sidelines, they couldn’t do much.” In a match in which the officials seemed to be under fire all night, it finally turned ugly with a benches-clearing incident with 5:38 left. Both coaches restored order, just to see one last controversy. With 2:59 to play, La Grande’s Michael Ebel fired a shot that was blocked in front of the Pioneer net. As the ball appeared to roll out of the 18-yard penalty area, Mac-Hi was whistled for a foul and the Tigers were awarded a penalty kick. Ryan Adams blasted home the PK and the Tigers iced the 3-1 win. “It was outside the box,” Garcia said. “It was a foul, (but it was outside the box). I’m not complaining, it’s part of the game, but it shouldn’t be like that. The referees made big mistakes. Somebody needs to take care of this.” Mac-Hi hosts Baker at 4 p.m. Thursday.
