(Photo: KYLE GRANTHAM/THE NEWS JOURNAL) \nKelly said the team has been in contact with the NFL about contingency plans as has Washington. The exact path of Hurricane Joaquin is not exactly known yet, but some models have it striking the Washington, D.C. area late Sunday, while others have it veering off to the East. \n\"There's been nothing told to us,\" Kelly said. \"Today's a normal Thursday [practice] as if we're playing Sunday at 1 o'clock.\" \nThen he added: \"I obviously understand it. If it does hit in some of the manners that it could hit, it could really affect everybody _ people attending the game, all the other stuff. We're big on if we can't control it, and obviously no one can control the weather, then we'll adjust accordingly.\" \nOne scenario mentioned the possibility of changing the Eagles' and Washington's bye week to this week, then playing the game during Week 8, on Nov. 1, when both teams were scheduled to be off. But that seems unlikely because it would violate the collective bargaining agreement that says players can't practice during the week off, which they're doing this week. \nThere is a precedent for moving a game to another city. That happened last season when a snowstorm dumped as much as six feet of snow in Buffalo, forcing the game against the Jets to be moved to Detroit. \nIn 2010, a snowstorm forced the Eagles to postpone their game against the Minnesota Vikings until Tuesday. \nKelly even mentioned the game against the Lions in 2013, when he said the predictions were for a dusting of snow after halftime. Instead, about eight inches fell, most of it before halftime. \nEven if the game in Washington goes on as scheduled, wind and rain will still be a factor, something Kelly said he takes into account in the game plan. \n\"We watch the weather more than anything,\" he said. \"You're always trying to get updates, kind of see where you are. Are you preparing for wind? Are you preparing for rain? Part of it, then, becomes on game day, you have to figure it out because which way is the wind blowing.\" \nIn other news: \n>>Kelly would not confirm that inside linebacker Kiko Alonso had arthroscopic surgery to determine the severity of his partial ACL tear. The NFL Network reported that the procedure determined that Alonso will be able to return in about a month after rehab. \n\"If a player wants to talk about what goes on with him, that's entirely up to the player,\" Kelly said. \"I'll give you an update of when he's in, when he's out, when he's back. That's going to make my life a lot easier. If you want to talk to Kiko when he gets back, that'll be great.\" \nKelly said Alonso will return Friday after spending the past few days in Florida with Dr. James Andrews. The media doesn't have access to the Eagles on Friday. \n>>Kelly said inside linebacker Mychal Kendricks (hamstring) was a full participant in practice Wednesday, but can't say yet if he'll play against Washington. The same is true for running back DeMarco Murray (hamstring), who was limited Wednesday. \n>>As for defensive lineman Cedric Thornton, Kelly said his progress from a broken hand \"surprised some people,\" but it's too soon to say whether he'll play. \n>>Both WR Riley Cooper (knee) and S Chris Maragos (quad) returned to practice Thursday after missing the previous two days. \nContact Martin Frank at mfrank@delawareonline.com .
