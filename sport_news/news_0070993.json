Cambridge, Creek reach WIAA Mike Klawitter | Leader sports editor Daily Jefferson County Union \nMARSHALL — Cambridge High School football head coach Mike Klingbeil took a long, deep breath in the Marshall High School football field’s east end zone as if a tremendous weight had been lifted off his shoulders. \nThe Blue Jays needed to beat the Cardinals to get themselves in the WIAA Division 6 playoffs, and they did it very convincingly with a number of senior players involved in the victory. \nRunning back Josh Owens rushed for 172 yards and two touchdowns, quarterback Steven DeForest threw touchdown passes to J.T. Parish and Caleb Martin, and defensive players such as P.J. Jarlsberg and Pat Holden made life miserable for Marshall quarterback Adam Wehking as the Blue Jays romped to a 35-7 victory. \nKlingbeil said making the playoffs was a major accomplishment for Cambridge, which ended the regular season with a 3-2 Capitol South Conference record and 5-4 overall. \n“Our kids really looked forward to this game. It’s a big rivalry game for us,” he said. “It’s an exciting time for us to get a victory here. We very rarely win here, and the guys stepped up to the challenge and we got a big win tonight.” \nThe Blue Jays will play at Cuba City Friday night in the post-season’s first round. \nThe game looked like it would be a major task for the Blue Jays. Marshall was 4-0 in conference and earlier in the season, Cambridge had been manhandled by the larger, physical offensive and defensive linemen of league opponents Waterloo and New Glarus/Monticello. \nYet, the Blue Jays were able to dominate the Cardinals, although they got off to shaky start as Marshall recovered the ball on an onside kick on the opening kickoff, and Cambridge fumbled the ball away on its first possession. \nWehking and the Cardinals then orchestrated a good drive, moving the ball up to the Cambridge 28. Yet, the Blue Jays recovered a fumble, and two plays later, DeForest hit Parish with a 68-yard touchdown pass for a 7-0 lead. Klingbeil said that play seemed to tip the game in Cambridge’s favor. \n“We needed something good to happen,” Klingbeil said. “We didn’t want to be our own worst enemy and have self-inflicted wounds. That play got us the momentum and energy we needed, and gave us some confidence.” \n“It was a big boost,” Parish said. “We knew it was going to be tough coming out, and that first score was big for us.” \nThe Blue Jays added another touchdown just before the end of the quarter as Martin snared a pass from DeForest along the right sideline and danced 39-yards into the end zone. \nThe second quarter was scoreless but Cambridge let a scoring opportunity slip away as an 18-yard Marshall punt gave the Blue Jays the ball on the Cardinals 36-yard line. Owens was able to get the ball into the red zone on a 14-yard run, but on the next play, he fumbled the ball away and Marshall recovered. \nYet, Owens would make up for that as he scored Cambridge’s third touchdown on a 2-yard run at 1:31 of the third quarter to give the Blue Jays a 21-0 advantage. \nFive minutes into the fourth quarter, Owens broke free for a 36-yard touchdown. \nMarshall responded with a 37-yard scoring pass from Wehking to Mares, but Martin recovered the Cardinals’ onside kick to give Cambridge the ball at midfield. \nAfter chewing some time on the clock with three rushing plays, junior punter Brendan Jarlsberg boomed a kick of nearly 50 yards that was downed at the Marshall 1-yard line. \nSeveral plays later, Jarlsberg intercepted a Wehking pass at the 25 and tallied Cambridge’s fifth touchdown of the night and a 35-7 lead. \nThe Blue Jays gained 327 yards total offense. DeForest was 9-of-15 passing for 155 yards as Parish led receivers with six catches for 104 yards. \nThe Cambridge defense made itself at home in the Marshall backfield with Holden making seven tackles, four of them for loss of yardage, and two sacks. \nP.J. Jarlsberg and Martin both had 10 tackles, and DeForest recorded five. \n“When a team spreads it out and is a little more balanced, we match up better,” Klingbeil said. “We were able to cover their pass receivers and put some pressure up front.” \n“We knew they were going to be good,” Owens said about his success of running the ball against the Marshall defense. “I just depended on my O-line. They hit hard, but it really wasn’t that tough.” \nWehking completed only 9-of 25 pass attempts for 177 yards and threw two interceptions for Marshall, which had to settle for a share of the conference crown with Waterloo as both teams finished with records of 4-1. The Pirates shut down New Glarus/Monticello Friday night 21-0.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T17:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T01:57:51.213+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
