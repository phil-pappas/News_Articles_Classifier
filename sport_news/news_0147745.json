If this was Ervin Santana’s farewell, if his first season with the Twins is finished no matter what happens this weekend, next week and beyond, at least Twins fans seemed happy to forgive and forget. It’s the hometown All-Star that they have a problem with these days. Santana did everything he could Friday to qualify his team for playoff games he’s barred from taking part in, keeping a tense game tied at Target Field until the eighth inning. But Glen Perkins, unhittable back when Santana was ineligible but now limping to the finish, allowed two of the three hitters he faced to smack run-scoring hits, and Kansas City rode that brief offensive outburst to a 3-1 victory that all but extinguishes the Twins’ postseason hopes. The loss, combined with an all-but-given Houston victory at Arizona — the Astros handed Dallas Keuchel a 5-0 lead in the first two innings Friday as the ace lefthander looked for his 20th victory of the season — meant the Twins were two games behind the Astros with two games to play in the chase for the second AL wild card. Any Twins loss or Astros victory will keep the Twins from the postseason for a fifth consecutive season. On top of that, the Los Angeles Angels pulled out a 2-1 victory at Texas, putting them one game ahead of the Twins and keeping them a game behind the Astros. So the Twins could catch the Astros and still miss out on the postseason. After all the buildup, all the glee over playing meaningful games on the season’s final weekend, the Twins’ high hopes ebbed away with a relative whimper. Playing against a Royals team preparing to defend its American League title, the Twins managed only four hits against soft-tossing righthander Chris Young, and none after three second-inning singles delivered the lone run. Young retired 15 of the final 17 hitters he faced, the only exceptions a pair of harmless walks. The Twins collected a pair of eighth-inning singles off reliever Ryan Madson once Young departed, but one was erased on a double play and the other was stranded when Miguel Sano, while fans beseeched him to tie the game with one swing, swung through a third-strike changeup. Young, 36 and getting by with guile, hardly fits the profile of a season-stopper, but he has been terrific against the Twins all season. In two Target Field starts this year, the journeyman gave up five hits and one run over 12⅔ innings. Santana matched him, however, despite putting the leadoff hitter on base four times. Once it bit him, when a leadoff double to Jarrod Dyson turned into a run when the Twins couldn’t turn a double play as he crossed the plate. Overall, Santana gave up four hits in seven innings, but the last one was critical: A single by Alcides Escobar to lead off the eighth inning on Santana’s 110th pitch. The chilly announced crowd of 31,534 offered a loud ovation for Santana as he left, his season probably complete after an 80-game suspension, 17 starts and an ERA that stands at exactly 4.00. But the runner he left on was the Twins’ downfall. Perkins took over, and trouble followed quickly. Ben Zobrist walloped Perkins’ first pitch off the bullpen fence, scoring Escobar with the tiebreaking run. After Aaron Hicks made a running catch of an Eric Hosmer line drive, Mike Moustakas laced a single to right field that ricocheted off Torii Hunter’s glove in right field. The hit sent Zobrist to third, the error brought him in, and the runs proved deadly to the Twins’ postseason hopes. And it was just the latest indignity to befall Perkins, whose season-opening streak of 28 consecutive saves seems so distant now. He has allowed runs to score in five of his nine September appearances, posting an 8.22 ERA in the month.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T06:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T06:18:04.126+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
