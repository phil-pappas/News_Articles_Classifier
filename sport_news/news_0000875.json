I'm just going to try to do my best to continue the process and the growth in their careers and the growth of the Red Sox as we move forward.”\nManager John Farrell was enthusiastic about Amaro's characteristics, one being his eagerness to help.\n“When Dave came in and felt like there was a need to mix things up, to change things and add a different mix to our staff you start to go back through and think about the potential candidates,” said Farrell, who played with Amaro in Cleveland. “But having known certainly Ruben as a former teammate and reading there were some articles written on his potential interest in getting back to the field (I) lobbed a call to him. Other than knowing Ruben's intelligence from who he was as a player, we're talking about someone who had to learn all three outfield positions as a former infielder. The steps he went through as a player certainly has given him an incredible reference point to go back to to begin to teach and to help others. It's his personality, it's his intelligence.”\nAmaro, 50, spent the last 10 years as Philadelphia's GM. He was the assistant GM when the Phillies won the World Series in 2008 and was the GM when the Phillies fell to the Yankees in the 2009 World Series. The Phillies dismissed him last month.\nAmaro played for eight seasons between 1991 and 1998 with the Phillies, Angels and Indians. He was a career .235 hitter with 16 home runs and 100 RBI in 485 games.\nAmaro is the son of Ruben Amaro Sr, an 11-year major leaguer and together they are the only father-and-son combination to play for the Phillies. A graduate of Stanford University (human biology major), Amaro played on the school's College World Series championship team in 1987.\nAmaro replaces first base coach Arnie Beyeler, who was not retained by the Red Sox at the season's end. All other coaches will be returning.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share?text=Ruben+Amaro+Jr.+eager+to+begin+%27unusual%27+move+to+Red+Sox+1B+coach"], "published": "2015-10-26T22:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T23:02:00.113+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
