Related Links Area Roundup: Seneca girls make history on golf course \nThe Lady Irish shot a 428 at the Elks Golf Club in Pontiac on Wednesday, placing third in the regional and moving on to the Woodridge Sectional. \nNatalie Hamilton led Seneca with an 18-hole score of 101, followed by Randi Rohder (105), Taylor Vroman (109) and Sam DeGraaf (113). Heather Vroman and Faith Hacker are the other team members to advance. \n“These girls played very well on a tough course that had a lot of break in the greens, and the greens were extremely fast,” Seneca coach Todd Yegge said. “They persevered. We were behind after the first nine holes, sitting in fourth place, but the girls fought back and played extremely well as a team on the back nine. \n“Coach (Bryan) Erickson and I are extremely proud of these girls and how the girls program has been developing with the dedication of this senior group (Hamilton, DeGraaf and Heather Vroman) that has been with us for all four years. Their work has been paying off and we will see how they do on Monday.” \nFOOTBALL \nDeKalb sophomores 28, Morris 0: Morris had a good opening drive on offense, as the Redskins had the ball the entire first quarter, but were unable to score.
