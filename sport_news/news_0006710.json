Featuring the latest synthetic turf technology, the prestigious training academy has set new benchmarks in quality, durability and performance for the region’s top playing surfaces.\nThe sports turf, called Xtreme Turf DX, is manufactured by Act Global at their USA facility under ISO 9001 quality standards. Featuring an exclusive MN Global yarn blend, developed in collaboration with Bonar Yarns, the system will greatly exceed the needs of a top international stadium. It has already been featured in several notable facilities, including Canada’s Montreal Olympic Stadium and CSV Apeldoorn in Netherlands.\n“We are pleased to offer Ho Chi Minh City University our latest and most advanced synthetic turf, suitable for top talent at this important training facility,” said Daniel Clapham, regional sales manager for Act Global. “We are constantly researching, testing and refining our systems to ensure players receive the best in class technology and playing surfaces.”\nThe new pitch will be used more than 50 hours per week by some of the country’s top athletes for training and matches. The dual-fibre system offers an ideal balance of player comfort and resilience, with durability testing exceeding FIFA’s standards by more than six times.\nThe pitch was completed with exclusive regional partner Hoang Nguyen Company, a leading installer for top-end football fields in Vietnam. The synthetic turf was finished with performance infill imported from Genan in Denmark, before passing stringent field testing to be certified to elite FIFA Two Star level. This is Act Global’s fourth FIFA Certified field in partnership with Hoang Nguyen.\nAs a FIFA Preferred Producer for Football Turf, Act Global has been a leader in bringing high-quality artificial turf to Vietnam and throughout Asia.
