Comment Posted Oct. 26, 2015 at 12:01 AM Micah McVicker Follow @@McVickerARD Posted Oct. 26, 2015 at 12:01 AM SHAWNEE — Jamie Hawkins and Kirstyn Jolly earned medals for their individual performances, and Dickson took home a team championship Saturday. Coach Jennifer Mays-Krimmer’s program earned the State Academic Champions Trophy, as Dickson posted the highest GPA among all Class 3A girls teams. Hawkins, Jolly, Sarah Huhman, Clary Donica, Landri McClure, Meredith Hendry and Aly Goss achieved a 3.951 GPA between them. “It shows what a great responsibility these girls have taken on themselves,” Mays-Krimmer said, “to not only be athletes and spend the time they do working on the sport(s) they are a part of, but also that they take their classwork seriously. They’re never late to class. They’re always turning their assignments in on time. They always make sure to take care of their classwork just like they take care of their athletics. “I think that was a big accomplishment for them.” On the course, however, the Comets placed third with 112 points, four behind Prague, whose 108 points earned them runner-up honors. Huhman (13:10.81) finished in 21st position, Donica (13:34.34) crossed the line in 35th position and McClure (13:53.97; 53rd) rounded out the Comets’ Top 5. “Going into the state meet, I told coach Linlee Blevins that I would be pleased if we had gotten in the top 3,” Mays-Krimmer said. “That would show me that we were ready to take it to another level, that we were competitive, that we were not shrinking from the challenge. “I think the girls had their expectations set very high, and that meant a lot to me as a coach.” Hawkins is the lone senior. Goss and Jolly are juniors. Donica and Hendry are sophomores. McClure and Huhman are freshmen. “We were very excited about the third-place finish,” Mays-Krimmer said. “Initially, when the girls saw it, they asked ‘What should I have done individually that would’ve gotten us to second place, so that we would’ve gotten a trophy?’ They really took that very hard. It means so much to me that you care enough that you’re disappointed.” Mays-Krimmer added this program has taken a great many steps forward in the last half-decade. This season, the biggest stride involved confidence, believing in their ability, which parlayed into results. “We’ve come so far this year,” Mays-Krimmer said. “Those girls are already looking to next year and saying, ‘When we come back, we’re going to have an even better showing.’ “I was excited about that.” BOYS Clinton Bland won All-State honors due to his sixth-place finish, and Dickson placed fifth as a team with 139 points. Page 2 of 2 - “I think we ran excellent,” Dickson coach Bryce Bell said. “Top to bottom, we dropped times from the last time we were there (two weeks ago) with nearly every single individual. We ran our best on the biggest stage, and I couldn’t be more proud of those guys.” Jeremiah McMahan (17:55.18) finished in 24th, while Clinton Bland (18:02.18) placed one spot behind his fellow junior. Senior Chance Herriott (19:00.56) finished in 52nd place, while Austin Parker (19:07.56) rounded out the Comets’ top 5, finishing 61st overall. Silo placed fourth with 130 points. Bell believes his program took its biggest stride forward by believing in themselves. “They learned from their own experience that they have the potential to be very good,” Bell said. “They have embraced that, and pushed themselves harder than they’ve ever pushed themselves before. That was a huge factor as to why we were as successful as we were this year. “I’m proud of these young men and the effort that they’ve put forth this year. Looking forward to the upcoming track season, and a chance to go back next fall and place as high as possible.” Micah McVicker", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T06:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T07:48:14.494+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
