We have an opportunity to go 12-4. We have to get on that path.\"\nManning, who finished 41 of 54 for 441 yards and one interception, connected on two of his three touchdown passes in the second half.\nThe Giants had led 13-6 at halftime, with Odell Beckham Jr. catching five passes for 89 yards. He finished with 121 yards on seven catches.\nTwo of Beckham's longest receptions were directly responsible for New York's first 10 points.\nHis first was a 49-yard grab that set up the first of Josh Brown's two field goals, then he made a 31-yard catch to set the stage for running back Shane Vereen's two-yard touchdown reception to make it 10-3.\nBrown added his second field goal, a 41-yarder, to give the Giants a 13-3 lead with 4:02 left in the first half.\nThe 49ers' only points of the first half came on their opening and final drives, both field goals by kicker Phil Dawson.\nBoldin finished with eight catches for 107 yards.\nHyde gained 93 yards on 21 carries, and Kaepernick was 23-for-35 for 262 yards and two touchdowns with no interceptions.\n(Compiled by Greg Stutchbury)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T10:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T10:12:29.916+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
