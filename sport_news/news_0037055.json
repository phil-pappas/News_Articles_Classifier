The Pittsburg Purple Dragons put up five first half goals while holding on for a clean sheet in a 7-0 win over the Field Kindle, of Coffeyville, Golden Tornado on Thursday night in Pittsburg. Starting off fast, it didn’t take long for Pittsburg to score first, off a free kick in the ninth minute as Jose Ayala headed it into the left side of the net. From that point forward, the Purple Dragons kept up the momentum for the rest of the game. It was the second meeting between the two Southeast Kansas League schools, with Pittsburg winning both contests. With the win, Pittsburg improved to 10-2. “It’s always hard to play a team the second time around but tonight, we saw the fruition of a lot of things that we have been working on in training,” said Pittsburg head coach Sean Lauderdale. “That’s what gave us the decisive win tonight. It was correcting mistakes and giving Coffeyville a new look and that’s what attributed to our success.” Frander Marroquin scored off a duel with Coffeyville’s goalkeeper Nick Porter in the 15th minute to double the lead. An attempt by Coffeyville in the 17th minute was thwarted by Pittsburg goalkeeper Sullivan Lauderdale’s clearance. It wasn’t long until Lukas McConnell turned it into a goal off the counterattack to give the Purple Dragons a three-goal lead. “We played horrible,” said Field Kindley head coach Jayson Etter. “We didn’t play as a team. We had no passing. We had maybe two shots on goal.” A free kick by Coffeyville resulted in another goal opportunity by Jazon Marroquin whose eventual shot was punched away by Porter to save a goal. Jeffery Solis’s shot over the crossbar was the Golden Tornadoes' first shot of the game. An offside call was recalled by the line judge after a cross pass resulted in a goal by Jazon Marroquin for the Purple dragons in the 22nd minute and the Purple Dragons built a 4-0 advantage. “It’s like we came out sleeping,” Etter said. “We weren’t awake. We weren’t ready. We had no passing.” The Purple Dragons earned their first corner kick of the game in the 24th minute from the left side but it was headed out of the box by Coffeyville. “We came out fast and hard,” Pittsburg's Sean Lauderdale said. “We were moving the ball well. we put their defensive line under a lot of pressure. We just wanted to keep that pressure up for the first half.” Page 2 of 3 - After a long shot was saved by Sullivan Lauderdale, Frander Marroquin beat two Coffeyville defenders in a foot race and eventually Porter, with a 26th minute goal. Two consecutive saves by Porter cancelled out a Pittsburg scoring opportunity. “Nick was awesome,” Etter said. “There was nothing that he could’ve done about the four out of five goals that were scored. (Pittsburg) played better than us. They had more goals, more runs and better shots.” In the 29th minute, Jazon Marroquin limped off the field with an injury and was replaced by Isaias Diaz. As the Purple Dragons kept attacking, Brice Camp’s cross from the right of the box with halftime looming was safely picked off by Porter. The Golden Tornado conceded a corner in the 34th minute after a shot went off the legs of Porter but Pittsburg couldn’t capitalize off the opportunity. After limping for several minutes, Coffeyville’s Kevin McDonald was taken out of the game late in the first half. A one-on-one shot in the 38th minute by Pittsburg somehow failed to clear the line and the Golden Tornado’s second shot on target went into the hands of Lauderdale and Coffeyville was left still searching for their first goal of the night. Coffeyville began the second half in control. They threatened with an attack that ended with Lauderdale having to reach to knock the ball clear. Soon after, they earned a throw in that was close to the Pittsburg goal. “I had to fire them up somehow in the second half,” Etter said. “I told them at halftime that it was 0-0. We had to start off fresh. We had to start off tough and play like we love the game.” But Coffeyville still couldn’t find the back of the net. Chad McNeal took Porter’s place in the net at the start of the second half. He had a finger tip save off a PHS free kick that almost turned into a CHS opportunity on a counter attack, as Sullivan Lauderdale had to kick the ball away. Coffeyville kept control of possession for most of the second half as Pittsburg’s defense was challenged more but didn’t concede. “I can’t say enough about my defensive line this season,” Sean Lauderdale said. “They’re working so well together. It’s one of the strongest defensive lines that I’ve seen in our area. They’ve worked hard and have done a great job.” It wasn’t until the 63rd minute when Pittsburg’s long awaited sixth goal finally came when Maldonado fired a shot in the far left corner of the net past McNeal. Page 3 of 3 - Carlos Calderon’s shot in the 70th minute made it 7-0. In the 72nd minute, McNeal was helped off the field after picking up a calf injury and was replaced by Porter. Trying to capitalize off a deflection by Porter, Ivan Walter’s shot went wide over the net in the final five minutes of the game. Frander Marroquin ended up with five shots with four of them on target while Jazon Marroquin had seven shots total and four on target. Maldonaldo ended up with two shots total, both of which were on goal. McConnell also had two shots total with both of them on target. Sullivan Lauderdale ended the night with seven saves.
