(Kevin Richardson/Baltimore Sun video) Mike Preston Contact Reporter The Baltimore Sun Defensive coordinator Dean Pees is the least of Ravens' worries, @MikePrestonSun writes. \nI love all of these people questioning Ravens defensive coordinator Dean Pees. I would like to sit some of them down and ask what type of defense the Ravens should run. \nI'd like to go through situations with them and personnel issues. I'd like to know when they would blitz or bring pressure, or even know if they knew the difference between the two. \nWhat I have seen from Pees in the past couple of weeks is a coach who has tried everything. And the reason the Ravens struggle is not from what is being called, but from lack of talent. If the Ravens had a strength, believe me, he would stay with it. But they are lacking, so Pees is in a no-win situation. The Ravens can't consistently get enough pressure up front, so he has to bring more pressure. \nWell, that's great if you have cornerbacks who can cover, but the Ravens don't have a shutdown corner on the roster. Nope, and please, don't mention Jimmy Smith in that role again. \nTo bring pressure, you really need cornerbacks who can press up on receivers and be physical at the line of scrimmage. The Ravens don't have those types of cornerbacks. either. So, that's why the Ravens play so far off receivers. They at least want to make a team go eight to 12 plays down the field instead of giving up one big play for a touchdown. It's logical, and makes sense to me. That strategy almost got them to the AFC championship game last season.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T15:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T16:38:45.805+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
