And we hit a lot of no doubters, but we can also get some cheapies in Toronto. \n“Our whole division has great parks ... this is definitely different. You're not going to get any cheap ones. The gaps are bigger, you can get more doubles. \n“(The Royals) are a perfect fit because they can run down some balls down in the outfield with the best of them. And they're a speed team, because they know you're not going to hit a lot of home runs necessarily and they're good at manufacturing runs. \nGibbons also expressed confidence in Jays first baseman Chris Colabello's ability to have an impact on the series. \n“I liked the way he was swinging it in the previous series,” Gibbons said. “We need offence and he's been a big part of that all year. He's in a groove right now. \nMeanwhile, if some in the baseball world were surprised that David Price didn't get the start for Game 1, Royals manager Ned Yost is not among them. \n“Nothing surprises me,” Yost said prior to the Royals batting practice in advance of Friday's Game 1 of the best-of-seven series. “Gibby has a good plan, like we feel we have a good plan. And there's reasons for everything that a manager does. I guarantee you, Gibby's got a good reason for it.” Sponsored Links", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T02:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T02:36:00.753+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
