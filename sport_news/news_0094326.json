(AP) - X-rays on the left hand of quarterback Matthew Stafford came back negative and defensive back Rashean Mathis was cleared after going through the concussion protocol.\nThat's the good news for a struggling Detroit team.\nCoach Jim Caldwell updated the status of Stafford and Mathis on Monday, with the Lions set to travel to London for Sunday's game against the Kansas City Chiefs. Detroit lost 28-19 to Minnesota last weekend, and Stafford was knocked around by a pass rush the Lions couldn't handle.\nStafford threw for 256 yards and two touchdowns, but he was sacked seven times.\nMathis went through the concussion protocol, but Caldwell said it was determined he did not have a concussion.\n\nOnline:\nAP NFL website: www.pro32.ap.org and www.twitter.com/AP_NFL\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
