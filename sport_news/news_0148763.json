(Paul Beaty / AP) Tribune wire reports Contact Reporter \nRamogi Huma and Kain Colter refuse to allow one decision to derail their mission to unionize college athletics. \nOn Monday, the two former college football players who now represent the College Athletes Players Association walked into the NCAA's own backyard and stated their case at Indiana's AFL-CIO state convention. \nHuma said a decision from the National Labor Relations Board against a football players' union at Northwestern is a hurdle for his organization, which has been backed by the United Steelworkers for 15 years. But he said it's not an outright loss. \nHuma and Colter have renewed their fight to get NCAA, school and conference officials to abide by stronger concussion protocols, provide long-term health care and make sure recent changes involving stipends and multi-year scholarships become legally binding. \nAssociated Press", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T23:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T21:47:07.188+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
