COMMENT BELOW\nHe has some big voices in his corner such as Ricky Ponting and Steve Waugh who felt Australia dropped him too soon when his nine-Test career was truncated two years ago.\nBurns has opened for Australia in 50-over cricket and the selectors must now decide whether he is the man to replace Chris Rogers whose old fashioned grit became a cherished commodity in his 25-Test career.\nBurns’ main rival is West Australian Cam Bancroft whose steadiness is considered an ideal replacement for Rogers.\n“It is good to see that competition but it would not hurt Cam at all if he missed out,’’ Bichel said.\nJoe Burns (R) and Usman Khawaja cross while playing for the CA XI. Source: AFP\n“He has been doing reasonably well for Western Australia at the top of the order but Burns has been getting runs as well and is my first choice around those two. “Burns has been in the system for 18 months with Australia A and making his Test debut last season.’’\nBurns has a century and three half centuries from his last five bats and is making it difficult for Australia to leave him out.\nHe also has scores of 58 and 66 in his second and last Test, against India at the SCG in January, innings which seemed certain to land him an Ashes tour berth tour until Adam Voges’ outstanding form surge pipped him on the line.\nVoges seems likely to hold his place despite failing when Australia needed him most on the Ashes tour.\nAustralia’s selectors will view the first two days of day-night, pink ball Sheffield Shield games this week before picking the team.\nThe side is close to being settled with unfulfilled talent Shaun Marsh one of the few fringe-dwellers capable of making a major play for late consideration if he can post a big score.\n@craddock — cmail\nOriginally published as Why Bichel backs Bulls duo for Gabba Test", "external_links": ["http://resources1.news.com.au/images/2015/10/26/1227583/098349-3a65913a-7bb9-11e5-b858-124d84ad5405.jpg", "http://www.couriermail.com.au/sport/cricket/usman-khawaja-and-joe-burns-have-done-enough-to-win-selection-for-gabba-test/story-fnii0bxd-1227583097894", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/external?url=http://content4.video.news.com.au/foxsports/prod/archive/2015/10/26/DVU_261015_CRI_MISBAH_UL_HUQ_FAKE_SWEEP.jpg&width=650&api_key=kq7wnrk4eun47vz9c5xuj3mc"], "published": "2015-10-27T02:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T14:11:33.598+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
