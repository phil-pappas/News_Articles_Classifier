Now that James is back, it doesn’t really matter.” \nCourtney has been cleared to make his long awaited return this weekend after breaking five ribs and puncturing his lung in a freak pitlane accident in August’s Sydney round. \n“He’s been out for a little while and been itching to get back,” Tander said of Courtney. \n“It’s good to see him back. It’s good for the team.” \nThe driver merry go round is in full swing after Nissan confirmed on Thursday they would release Moffat at season’s end, sparking speculation he will replace David Wall at Volvo next year. \nNissan cited lack of sponsorship for not being able to offer Moffat a drive next year. \nMoffat achieved the Nissan team’s best results in his three-year tenure – their sole race win at Winton 2013 and last year’s Bathurst 1000 second placing with Taz Douglas. \nAnd former Bathurst champ Davison is expected to cut ties with Mercedes and next year link with Holden’s Tekno Autosports, backed by the same garage as dominant outfit Red Bull. \nTekno’s Shane van Gisbergen has already signed to drive a third Red Bull car in 2016.
