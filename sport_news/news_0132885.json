(Photo: David Guralnick / Detroit News) \nCONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Ann Arbor — If it had been his decision, tailback De’Veon Smith would not have missed the game at Maryland.\nBut he couldn’t exactly argue with coach Jim Harbaugh, who told him it would be best to stay home, get treatment and get his right ankle sprain healed.\n“I thought I could play,” Smith said after Michigan’s 38-0 victory on Saturday against Northwestern. “I was practicing a little bit. I was physically in a position to play. Coach Harbaugh told me, ‘We don’t need you this week, just sit out and get healthy.’ ”\nSmith returned to the lineup against the Wildcats and had 59 yards rushing on eight carries. He was one of seven backs who had carries, including freshman running back Karan Higdon and fullbacks Joe Kerridge and Sione Houma.\nMichigan also showed variety in its passing game. Tight end A.J. Williams had four catches for 48 yards, tight end Jake Butt had three receptions for 40 yards, receivers Jehu Chesson, Drake Harris, Amara Darboh and Maurice Ways had catches, as did Smith, who had three for 19 yards.\nThe Wolverines rushed for 201 yards and had 179 yards receiving.\n“It does help when you spread the wealth to everybody,” Smith said. “You can’t really prepare for that. You don’t know who’s going to be having the ball, who’s going to be looked at the most.”\nSmith continues to lead the Wolverines in rushing with 77 carries for 390 yards and four touchdowns. He also has a receiving touchdown.\n“It was good to have De’Veon back,” Harbaugh said. “We didn’t want to put too much on him. Looked like he had no rust at all. He looked really good.”\nangelique.chengelis@detroitnews.com \ntwitter.com/chengelis", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T01:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T06:10:43.585+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
