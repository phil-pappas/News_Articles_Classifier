He's also blind.

Unable to see, but with a clear view of the big picture. \n“Being here with you guys really means a whole bunch to me,” he told the team. “I emailed every single football coach in the Missouri Valley Conference. Two emailed me back. Only one person has ever called me back: Coach (Joe) Glenn from South Dakota.” \nWeiler is a sports administration grad student at Western Illinois. He was in bed as a 10-year-old listening to a radio broadcast of an Indiana-Illinois basketball game and decided that talking about sports and being part of sports was what he wanted to do with his life. \n“If I did a play-by-play broadcast, it would be awful,” he told the players, getting a big laugh. “Nobody would know what was happening. But there is no reason I couldn’t be analyzing what would be happening on the court or the field.” \nHe reeled off a few bars, metaphorically speaking, of how a Weiler commentary might go if he was on the radio that minute. He told the players there’s nothing in the world that is sufficient compensation for not being able to see, and he passed around the national basketball championship ring that Rick Pitino gave him after Louisville won a national title in 2013. Freshman runs for 90 yards vs. Leathernecks \n“Coach Pitino told me I changed his life,” Weiler said. “If the Cardinals won a national championship not only would he give me a piece of the net, he’d get me a national championship ring. Then they beat Michigan 82-76.” \nHe got the ring and a piece of the net that sent Louisville to the Final Four. Weiler acknowledged Pitino has had his ups-and-downs in public life, but the gesture from the coach was a huge one. \n“Every day when I wake up I always put on my national championship ring first,” Weiler said, “because it gives me the opportunity to think about all the things that I’ve had to overcome.” \nWeiler talked about needing help to get through a day and he mentioned his helpers individually. Summer Tracy has a blind brother and sister, Marloes van Eijkelenburg is a friend from The Netherlands who is also getting a masters in sports administration. Shannon Gilbert, Anna Askins and Lauren Rozman were also there and often assist him in all the little things everyone else takes for granted. \n“He’s considered disabled because he’s blind,” Gilbert said. “He’s capable of doing so much more than anyone could imagine. He can walk on our campus from one end to the other by himself without anyone with him. I could never do that.” \nWeiler will be sitting at lunch and he’ll say something like “It’s 11:42, we should get going.” No watch and he can’t see a clock. \n“It’s like ‘Bryce, how do you do that?’” Tracy said. “He says he just knows.” \nIt was listening to sporting events on the radio, specifically XM radio, that really ignited Weiler’s passion for sports and for connecting with people in the world of sports. He sat on the bench for home games at the University of Evansville, where he earned his undergraduate degree. He learned how to make free throws, upwards of eight out of 10, during that time. He has reached out to well-known broadcasters and coaches alike and whether or not he makes a career of broadcasting, he’s set on a career in sports. Argus Leader Sports Picks of the Week \n“I can show students the value of, first of all, going to sporting events to support the team,” he said. “But second of all, to have the experience in college of being part of something bigger than themselves. I’m excited about doing that.” \nIt is trite to compare the issues of a football team to the hardships endured by someone who has been blind from birth, but there is value in watching a young man address his handicap head-on. Do you want to get to know Coach Pitino? Well, find his email and tell him you want to talk to him. Do you want to be a part of radio broadcasts with well-known broadcasters? Well, send some more emails, make some calls, keeping moving on your aspirations. \n“We can all learn something from my friend Bryce,” Glenn said. “Sharing time with him meant a lot to all of us.” \nAfter Weiler completed his talk, he walked with Glenn to the lobby. Glenn saw a piano in the hotel restaurant – has this guy ever walked by a piano without playing it? – and knocked out the USD fight song for Weiler. \n“Bryce, I’ve known a few blind guys in my life before you,” Glenn told him as they continued walking. “But they were all wearing striped shirts.” \nSaturday night after the Coyotes lost to Western Illinois, after the perfunctory questions you ask about what went wrong and why these things went wrong, quarterback Ryan Saeger got a question about listening to Weiler. \n“It’s obvious Bryce is a great man,” the quarterback said. “He has an inspiring story. It says a lot about Coach Glenn, too, to bring Bryce in and talk to us. Coach Glenn was the only one in the league to reach his hand out and allow Bryce to come in and talk to the team. Wins and losses – that’s part of the game – but it means a lot to me that we have such a great guy leading us, a great guy teaching us how to become men.” 21 CONNECT 10 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://argusne.ws/1RG4buy TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T02:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T05:54:09.485+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
