Wide receiver Jakeem Grant recently said that this year's team isn't the same 4-8 squad from last year.\nA home game in Lubbock against the No. 3 team in the nation should be a good litmus test for that claim.\nRecord: 3-0, 0-0 in Big 12\nLast: Defeated Arkansas, 35-24, on Sept. 19\nKey number: 33 percent: Texas Tech's third down conversion rate (4-12) from last year's 82-27 win by the Horned Frogs. This year the Red Raiders have converted 56.7 percent of third downs (21-37).\n1. Patrick Mahomes' running ability\nMahomes has quickly erased any memory of quarterback controversies in Lubbock. Through three games he's thrown for more than 1,000 yards, completed 66 percent of his passes and tossed nine touchdowns. Like his coach when he was at Tech, he can sling it.\nBut one part of Mahomes' game that might get overlooked is his ability to scramble to extend a play or run the ball himself. He's second on the team with 129 rushing yards on 21 carries. He also has four rushing touchdowns.\nMahomes may not have much experience under his belt, but a patchwork TCU defense might be in the same boat.\n2. The other wide receivers\nJakeem Grant gets the credit that he deserves as Tech's do-it-all guy. Through three games this year he already has 526 all-purpose yards (287 receiving, 236 on kick returns). The Red Raiders are going to get him the ball one way or another. But there are a couple of other wideouts that can't be forgotten.\nWith a defense that was healthier in last year's matchup than it is now, the TCU defense was able to limit Grant to two catches. Devin Lauderdale snagged three of his own for 81 yards and a touchdown, while Ian Sadler nabbed one for 18 yards himself.\nTCU may be able to limit Grant's touches receiving this year, but that means younger and less experienced players are going to have to matchup with Lauderdale and Sadler. A 5-11 and 197 pounds, Sadler is a pretty big receiver to cover out of the slot. Reginald Davis is another receiver to watch out for. He averages 22 yards per catch as Tech's deep threat. And if that wasn't enough, speedy running back Justin Stockton is a shifty pass-catching back that has incredible speed out of the backfield.\n3. Start of the second half\nIf this game is close starting the second half, the third quarter could go a long way in deciding the winner of this one. Through three games this year, the Red Raiders' have outscored opponents 41-3 this year in the third quarter. The three combined points in those three games is by far the least Texas Tech gives up per quarter.\nMeanwhile TCU has outscored opponents 196-59 in the third frame. The Red Raider defense may not be the most feared unit in the Big 12, but they have showed that they can limit production coming out of the half. TCU and Trevone Boykin should be a good test to see if Tech's defense (under a new defensive coordinator) has improved.\n4. Tech's rushing defense\nOpponents average 257.3 rushing yards per game, which is the fifth most yards given up per game in the nation, against the Red Raiders' defense. And opponents have racked up that many yards when they've tailed Texas Tech. A year ago, Aaron Green needed only six touches to eclipse the 100-yard mark against Tech.\nTCU's Gary Patterson has also said he wants Boykin to be smarter running the ball by sliding more. Could that make the Heisman hopeful run less?\n5. Time of possession per drive\nBaylor may get all of the Big 12 hype for one of the league's most explosive offenses, but Tech shouldn't be overlooked. According to teamrankings.com , the Red Raiders have the second lowest time of possession per game this season at just over 21 minutes a game. That can be a double-edged sword for the Red Raiders. Scoring quickly could mean quick points, but it also means that the defense is out on the field for the majority of the game. Which means Boykin will have the ball in his hands.\nThat means Kingsbury has a decision to make. Does he run the ball and keep the ball away from Boykin or does he attack a defense that is missing seven (!) key pieces, including cornerback Ranthony Texada?\nFollow Joshua Friemel on Twitter at @Josh_Friemel .\nOn Twitter:\n @Josh_Friemel", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/Josh_Friemel", "https://www.teamrankings.com/college-football/stat/average-time-of-possession-net-of-ot", "https://twitter.com/Josh_Friemel", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/z-mhy_mI7WM", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/chuckcarlton/2015/09/20/carlton-texas-tech-gaining-confidence-grant-red-raiders-4-8-team"], "published": "2015-09-24T07:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T03:13:09.934+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
