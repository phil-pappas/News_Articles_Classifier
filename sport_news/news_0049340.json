The pink tie-dyed socks were been donated to South Philadelphia High School for their Breast Cancer Awareness game on Oct. 8. \nA 2015 Eagles Care partner, the Family Lives On Foundation of Exton, Pennsylvania, supports the lifelong emotional well-being of children whose mother or father has died. The Family Lives On Tradition Program supports parentally bereaved children and teens in continuing traditions they shared with their deceased parent. \nDuring the NFL season, Monday is typically reserved as a day off for the team. Many Eagles players, however, use this opportunity to enhance the quality of life for residents in the Delaware Valley through the Eagles Care Community Monday initiative. \nOn Sunday, Oct. 11, the Eagles will host the New Orleans Saints at Lincoln Financial Field.
