We also asked a renowned international commercial law firm to investigate,\" Niersbach said. \nFIFA was plunged into the biggest crisis of its 111-year history in May, when 14 soccer officials and sports marketing executives were indicted in the United States on bribery, money laundering and wire fraud charges involving more than $150 million in payments. \nImage: Replica of the FIFA World Cup trophy \nPhotograph: Sean Gallup/Getty Images Source: Â© Copyright 2015 Reuters Limited.
