They want clients to know that the one thing that won't change is that they are always welcome.\n\"There used to be some of them would act embarrassed and I said ‘why?’ This is why we are here and we could all be in this position sometime, and when you are able to help, help,” said Sheridan.\nThe Food Pantry is part of a program called just basics that runs a variety of different efforts to make sure people in the region get the food they need.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T13:13:22.962+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
