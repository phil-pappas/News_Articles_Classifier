For me, I believe it is not yet over. \n\"The gap is not yet wide and we still have six games to go, so I believe six matches is such a long time before the final winner could emerge,\" he stressed. \nDescribing the victory over Enyimba in Owerri on Sunday as important, Ejike told completesportsnigeria.com that the players were not under pressure to deliver. \n\"For us players, we were confident of beating Enyimba so there was no question of us being under pressure. \n\"If you ask me, I would say it was the officials, yes, our own officials who were under pressure. \n\"In the last two seasons, Enyimba have not been a problem for us in Owerri so we knew that right there on the pitch, we'd do our best to win and we did just that.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T12:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T13:20:04.660+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
