(Image Source: Scott Halleran/Getty Images) \nHere’s a look at the Thursday Night Football matchup between the Houston Texans and the Indianapolis Colts: \nSeries: Colts Lead 22-4; Streaks: Colts won past 5; Last Meeting: Colts 17, Texans 10 (12.14.14) \nTime: 8:30 PM ET; TV: CBS (Jim Nantz, Phil Simms & Tracy Wolfson) \nSpread: Texans -4; O/U 41 \nInjury Report: Colts: Out: ILB Jerrell Freeman (groin), RB Tyler Varga (concussion), OLB Bjoern Werner (hamstring); Questionable: S Mike Adams (neck), DT Henry Anderson (foot), CB Vontae Davis (foot), QB Matt Hasselbeck (illness), QB Andrew Luck (right shoulder); Probable: TE Dwayne Allen (ankle), RB Frank Gore (foot), DE Kendall Langford (back), CB Greg Toler (neck) \nTexans : Out: S Quintin Demps (hamstring), ILB Akeem Dent (hamstring), RB Jonathan Grimes (hamstring), WR Cecil Shorts III (shoulder), WR Nate Washington (hamstring); Questionable: S Lonnie Ballentine (knee), OLB Whitney Mercilus (thigh), RB Chris Polk (knee); Probable: OT Duane Brown (hand), ILB Max Bullough (shoulder), OLB Jadeveon Clowney (shoulder/knee), ILB Brian Cushing (foot), RB Arian Foster (groin), CB Johnathan Joseph (hip), QB Ryan Mallett (chest), OT Derek Newton (ankle), S Eddie Pleasant (thigh), OG Xavier Su’a-Filo (calf), NT Vince Wilfork (ankle) \nWhere They Stand: The Indianapolis Colts stand where they always seem to be, atop the AFC South. It’s been a rocky start, but with back-to-back division wins in the past two weeks, the Colts have pulled to even at 2-2. However, Indy’s -21 point differential is the worst in the NFL by a team that doesn’t have a losing record. The Houston Texans are one of 12 one-win clubs heading into Week 5. While most of those teams are considered unlikely division contenders, Houston can move into a first-place tie with a win tonight in what appears to be a very wide-open AFC South. \nThe Colts: With 15-straight wins against the AFC South, Indy can set an NFL record for the longest winning streak in divisional games. In his career, QB Andrew Luck is 5-1 against the Texans, with 1,385 yards, 14 TDs, three INTs and a 90.4 rating. Luck missed last week’s win over Jacksonville with a shoulder injury and backup Matt Hasselbeck stepped in. The 17-year veteran completed 63.8 percent of his passes for 282 yards (just 6.9 YPP) and a TD. In his past nine divisional games, WR T.Y. Hilton has caught 50 passes for 896 yards (18 YPC) and two scores. Complementing Hilton’s breakaway speed is youngster Donte Moncrief and veteran Andre Johnson . Johnson (1,019 receptions) is six catches from passing Isaac Bruce for eighth all-time, while Moncrief has scored in three of four games this season. RB Frank Gore is averaging 4.2 YPC and has seen his touches increase each week. ILB D’Qwell Jackson is coming off a 17-tackle game against the Jags and he has a team-high 47 stops this season. OLB’s Robert Mathis , Erik Walden and Trent Cole have one sack between them and the defense needs more from their edge pass rushers. Matching up with the opponent’s top WR, CB Vontae Davis (6 PDs) is one of the league’s best cover men. K Adam Vinatieri is the team’s all-time leading scorer and the first player with 1,000 points with two franchises. \nThe Texans: QB Ryan Mallett will be making his first divisional start on Thursday night. He is completing just 51.8 percent of his passes for 5.26 YPP, with three TDs and three INTs. He was pulled in last week’s game after going 12 of 27 and Week 1 starter Brian Hoyer stepped in and played well (17 of 30, 232 yards, 2 TDs) in garbage time. Despite how they performed in Week 4, Mallett remains the starter. Whoever is at QB, WR DeAndre Hopkins is emerging as a legitimate No. 1. Hopkins is coming off consecutive 100-yard games and has 56 catches for 816 yards (14.6 YPC) and five TDs in his past nine games. However, they will be without WR’s Cecil Shorts III (six receptions for 87 yards and a TD last week) and Nate Washington . In three career home starts, RB Alfred Blue has rushed for 227 yards and he will continue to lose carries to Arian Foster , who made his season debut last week (8 carries, 10 yards, fumble). Not many teams have the face of their franchise on the defensive side of the ball…the Texans are one of those teams. DE J.J. Watt has put up 15 sacks, two forced fumbles, a fumble recovery, a safety, six passes defensed and a TD reception in his past nine games. He’s no Johnny Come Lately, leading the NFL with 61 sacks since 2011. At the next level, ILB Brian Cushing is coming off an 11-tackle effort to give him a team-best 33 on the season. You better think twice when challenging CB Johnathan Joseph , who is tied for the most INT-TDs in the AFC since 2006 with five. He has a team-high six PDs this season. \nPrediction: Both teams come in banged up on a short week, which could make for a very ugly football game tonight. The biggest injury of all is to Andrew Luck, who will miss his second-consecutive start. Not only is Luck out but also backup Matt Hasselbeck didn’t have a full week of practice and he’s at less than 100 percent. Facing J.J. Watt is a daunting task for a shaky offensive line like Indy’s but despite Watt’s four sacks, only five teams have fewer than Houston’s six. If the Texans front seven steps up this could be a blowout. Houston has underwhelmed this season but they will come out on top against an Indy team that is simply not capable of winning consistently without their franchise quarterback. \nScore: Texans 23, Colts 13 \nDaniel Mogollon is a member of the Pro Football Writers of America and the Football Writers Association of America.
