I never voluntarily joined the UT nation.\nBut I was born into it, and could no more leave it than I can change my own DNA. I don’t “love” UT — to Quote: Scout Finch, one does not love breathing — but it is an inescapable condition of my existence.\nAnd so, with a fully involuntary reflex, I view the University of Oklahoma as an inherent enemy. Lions and jackals; cobras and mongooses. It’s the natural order of things. When you’re born burnt orange, it’s a lifelong condition.\nThe first home I can recall was a plywood-sectioned apartment of almost comical squalor in west Austin. It was a unit ($35/mo.) offered by UT to married students and their families, part of a row of repurposed Army barracks originally built as troop housing during World War II.\nThe young families, living in communal academic poverty, shared a single, unifying secular religion: Longhorn football. There was no other sport, no other team, no other obsession that came close.\nIn our neighborhood, when babies were old enough to wave bye-bye or play peek-a-boo, their little starfish hands were trained to make the “hook ’em” sign. “The Eyes of Texas” was our identifying anthem, learned as soon as we mastered speech, and taught by the older kids to the younger ones.\nOur hero, the greatest celebrity any of us could name, was Darrell Royal. Once, when I saw him at some public gathering or other, I shyly asked to take his picture with my little Instamatic camera.\n“Well, how about if we get a picture together?” he asked kindly, handing the camera to an assistant. I was dazed, stunned. I still have the faded snapshot: Coach Royal, young and vigorous; me, a timid pie-faced child. It was a moment of pure bliss.\nDarrell Royal was our Santa, the boys in burnt orange his loyal reindeer. Royal was our Paul Bunyan, Bevo his trusty blue ox. To a kid growing up in Austin, Texas, they were living myths we saw on our balky black-and-white TV set — or, when my parents had tickets, from the student secton.\nMy mother wept when the Longhorns lost. Now that I think of it, she still does.\nIn our house, “Aggie” was an insult, a pejorative: Aggies tracked mud in the house and belched at the dinner table. If you spilled chocolate milk on the sofa, you were an Aggie. Aggies, as I understood the term, were loutish and uncouth.\nSooners, however, were an alien tribe. They were barbarians from a dark foreign empire, and their overlord was a malignant deity called Barry Switzer. Once a year, they invaded Texas, and Longhorns met them on the field of battle in Dallas. In good years, Switzer and his savage horde were driven back to a distant, barren land I imagined to be as hostile and windswept as the Mongolian steppe.\nIn bad years, my mother wept.\nAt this late date, I probably owe an apology to OU and its students and possibly the entire state of Oklahoma for my inbred bias. But it’s hard to shake: As the argument so often goes, it’s the way I was raised.\nMy brother, a successful grown-up man of 50, feels it too. At the age of 9, he was given a pee-wee-size Longhorn football uniform, complete with helmet and pads, which he refused to take off for four solid days. After he cut his foot and bled all over it, he let it out of his sight only long enough to be laundered.\nHe didn’t attend UT either; he’s a devoted fan of his own alma mater, Louisiana State University. Yet he unconsciously refers to the Longhorn football team as “we” or “us” — somewhere in the back of his well-educated noggin, he’s still wearing his treasured costume, and will never take it off.\nEven as I outgrew the mythology, Longhorn culture permeated our lives. My eighth-grade history teacher had been the center on the 1969 national championship Longhorn team, a personal friend of the martyred Freddie Steinmark. A kid who would become a first-team All-American defensive tackle was a few years ahead of me in high school.\nSo it’s pointless to tell me the tradition is dead, that Saturday’s contest is a pitiful mismatch, that (what used to be called) the Red River Shootout is as dead as the Southwest Conference.\nYes, I can look at the facts and comprehend the reality.\nBut I cannot change what I am.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T19:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T21:07:42.876+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
