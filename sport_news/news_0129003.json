Posted: Tuesday, October 13, 2015 9:57 pm Field Hockey: Selinsgrove comes alive in second half to down Midd-West By Chris Nagy/The   SELINSGROVE – Don’t look now, but it seems like the Selinsgrove Field Hockey team is putting it all together just as the playoffs approach. The Seals showed the teamwork and intensity that is needed to advance deep into the playoffs Tuesday as they blanked Midd-West 6-0 in a Heartland Athletic Conference Division I showdown under the lights. \"It was a team win tonight,\" said Selinsgrove coach Cathy Keiser. \"We showed a lot of teamwork tonight.\" And the Seals (11-2, 6-0 HAC-I) also showed the little things that make a good team a championship team. \"We have been working on our passing and receiving all season,\" said Keiser. \"We have stressed to them to work to get open when they don’t have the ball and the girls have also started to think a pass ahead. \"It really came together tonight.\" Lexi Horst opened the scoring halfway through the first half off of a rebound but then showed she could also pass as she put a perfect ball right onto the stick of Tessa Hoffman, who lifted it over Midd-West’s Sierra Walter to make it 2-0 at half. Selinsgrove held a 7-0 edge in shots and a 6-0 edge in corners at the break. \"I was feeling really good about where we were at half,\" said Midd-West coach Jodi Sheaffer. \"I was pleased with the way we were playing.\" But the second half was a different story as Selinsgrove came out and took it right to the Mustangs (9-5-1, 5-4). \"Selinsgrove came alive in the second half,\" said Sheaffer. \"The passes were beautiful and we needed to do a better job marking.\" Hoffman had a goal taken away on a corner as she was a step outside the circle but just minutes later Megan Khan delivered a perfect pass to Erin Reed to make it 3-0. Hoffman added an assist to her goal later in the second half as she slid the ball across the middle to a wide-open Jess Smith to make it 4-0. With 12 minutes left, Cameron Shay got a rebound off the pads of Walter and banged it home to make it 5-0 and at the point Keiser started to substitute freely. Roni John put the capper on the scoring with four minutes left. Walter, who is normally the JV goalie, got the start in cage and played well stopping 11 shots. \"Sierra played awesome,\" said Sheaffer. \" She stopped almost every initial shot. \"She stepped up tonight.\" As did the Selinsgrove the defense anchored by Lindsay Trusal, Abby Batchelder and Kayleen Long. Midd-West did not have a shot or corner on the night as Seals goalie Keely Roadarmel had a front-row seat watching her defense turn away what few threats the Mustangs could muster. \"Our defense has really started to work together,\" said Keiser. \" If one has problem, another one is right there backing them up. We have a great support system on defense. \"And when the ball gets in the circle, they get it out with intensity.\"  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T04:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T11:53:11.568+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
