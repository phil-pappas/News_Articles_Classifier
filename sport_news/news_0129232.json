(AP) - Mississippi government buildings are continuing to fly flags at half-staff to honor those killed or wounded in a mass shooting at an Oregon college.\nGov. Phil Bryant has extended his order for public buildings to lower the Mississippi and U.S. flags.\nHis original order called for flags to fly at half-staff from noon Friday until sunset Monday. That is extended until sunset Tuesday, to match the timeline in a federal order issued by President Barack Obama for U.S. flags to be lowered at federal buildings.\nNine people were killed and seven others were wounded in the attack Thursday at Umpqua Community College in Roseburg, Oregon.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
