The 52 points are the most Boise State has ever allowed as a ranked team. \nThe Broncos (5-2, 2-1) served up four fumbles and three interceptions in the first half, including Evans' touchdown return that made it 45-10 at halftime. \nUtah State's Kent Meyers threw for 157 yards and a career-high three touchdowns and added 63 yards rushing and a touchdown. Hunter Sharp caught two touchdown passes. Houston 42, Tulane 7: Greg Ward Jr. ran for three touchdowns and threw a scoring pass to help the No. 24 Cougars beat the Green Wave in New Orleans. Playing as a ranked team for the first time since 2011, Houston (6-0, 3-0 American Athletic) won by at least 21 points for the fourth time this season. \nDespite three starting offensive linemen sitting out with injuries, Houston piled up 461 total yards, including 239 on the ground. Ward passed for 222 yards and ran for 77. \nHouston held Tulane (2-4, 1-2) to 262 total yards and forced 11 punts. BYU 38, Cincinnati 24: Tanner Mangum threw for 252 yards and two touchdowns, and the Cougars (5-2) scored 21 straight points in the fourth quarter to beat the Bearcats (3-3) in Provo, Utah. Advertisement Down 17-3 late in the first half, BYU tied it at 24 in the fourth quarter on Algernon Brown's 2-yard run. Francis Bernard set up the touchdown with a 40-yard run. \nThe Cougars took their first lead on the first play of their next possession. Mangum found Nick Kurtz wide open down the field for a 53-yard touchdown. Michigan State-Michigan: As well as Michigan is already playing under new coach Jim Harbaugh, it would be easy for the Wolverines to get a little ahead of themselves. It's all a bit surreal, the idea that Michigan State is undefeated and yet Michigan is favored to beat the Spartans this weekend. \n\"I'm sure there's going to be attempts to build the game up, but we're working and not worrying,\" Harbaugh said this week. \nThe 12th-ranked Wolverines could try all they wanted to block out the hype, but Michigan's resurgence has raised the stakes for Saturday's home game against seventh-ranked Michigan State. This is now much more than just a chance for Harbaugh to spoil the Spartans' unbeaten run. The winner of this matchup -- whoever it is -- becomes a clear contender for a Big Ten title and a spot in college football's playoff. \nMichigan State (6-0, 2-0 Big Ten) is unbeaten, while Michigan (5-1, 2-0) hasn't lost since its opener at Utah.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T08:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T08:13:35.211+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
