He reached the 300-mark with a swinging strikeout of Melvin Upton Jr. to end the third.\nKershaw concluded the regular season with 301 strikeouts, joining former Arizona teammates Randy Johnson (2000-02) and Curt Schilling (2002) as the only pitchers since 2000 to record 300.\nHe joined mentor Sandy Koufax as the only Dodgers to reach the mark. Koufax last did it in 1966.\nKershaw received a standing ovation from the crowd in his final tuneup before the Dodgers open the NL Division Series at home against the New York Mets on Friday.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
