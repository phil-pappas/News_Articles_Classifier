Even in dominant pitching performances, a dramatic drop in performance is typically expected the third time around the lineup, according to Stats LLC. With the average OPS for teams scoring two or less runs for a 9-inning game at .505, a “good” start is classified as when hitters’ OPS the first two times around was less than .505, the league average when a pitcher limits teams to two runs or less in a game.\nENLARGE Royals manager Ned Yost can turn to three ace relievers—Kelvin Herrera, Ryan Madson and closer Wade Davis (36 combined Ks in 20.2 postseason innings)—to shorten the game. That is a good thing because most Kansas City’s starters are unable to sustain success the third-time around. This season, Edinson Volquez has allowed the on-base plus slugging percentage of hitters to practically double in this scenario. And the declines of Yordano Ventura and Chris Young are even more extreme. Johnny Cueto has proven most resilient but has struggled overall since his mid-season trade to the Royals and gave up eight runs in two innings in his last playoff start.\nConversely, Mets manager Terry Collins is wise to stick with Jacob deGrom and Matt Harvey when they’re pitching well. Their declines are small enough to still make them better options than anyone in the Mets bullpen other than closer Jeurys Familia. But no matter how well Noah Syndergaard’s pitching, Collins should be quick to remove him. Even when his stuff is nearly perfect to start the game, hitters end up hammering him for a .949 OPS the third-time around.\n—Michael Salfino", "external_links": ["http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/MO-AA090_WSA24_NS_20151025194312.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-26T03:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T05:06:06.991+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
