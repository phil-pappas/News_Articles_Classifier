Forget the fact that he’s 41, his desire (is) to play baseball the right way — to be respectful of Major League Baseball, to be respectful for the other players, and the game itself.”\nAlthough his role was to be the Marlins’ backup outfielder, Suzuki ended up pacing the club in games played with 153.\nHe stole the show in Sunday’s season-finale, pitching the eighth inning of a game Miami lost 7-2 to the Phillies at Citizens Bank Park.\nTaking the mound was a long-held ambition, but it’s as a hitter that Suzuki established himself as one of the game’s greats, in Japan and North America.\nIn 2001, he became the first Japanese position player in Major League history, debuting with the Seattle Mariners and earning American League Rookie of the Year and Most Valuable Player honors.\nHe opened his US career with 10 straight seasons of more than 200 hits. In 2015, he had 91 hits in 398 at-bats, posting a .229 batting average with 21 runs batted in and 11 stolen bases. — AFP", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T08:36:20.420+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
