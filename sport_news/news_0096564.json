Anthony Martial whose handling of the ball gifted CSKA atoned for his error when he stooped to nod home an Antonio Valencia cross. \nAhmed Musa continued to trouble the United backline and Ander Herrera was booked with 10 minutes left on the clock for a foul on the former Kano Pillars forward. In other games on the night, PSG and Real Madrid played out a goalless draw in Paris, just like last season’s losing finalists Juventus at home to Borussia Monchengladbach. Manchester City got a last-gasp winner through Kevin De Bryune as they defeated Sevilla 2-1 at the Etihad, while Galatasaray came from behind to beat Benfica 2-1. \nWednesday results \nMalmo FF 1 – 0 Shakhtar Donetsk Paris Saint Germain 0 – 0 Real Madrid CSKA Moscow 1 – 1 Manchester United Wolfsburg 2 – 0 PSV Eindhoven Atletico Madrid 4 – 0 FC Astana Galatasaray 2 – 1 Benfica Juventus 0 – 0 Borussia Moenchengladbach Manchester City 2 – 1 Sevilla", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T00:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T04:50:10.314+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
