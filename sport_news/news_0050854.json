Hicks also was encouraged to hear about Patterson's percolating sponsor and advertising negotiations, deals that could boost Texas' annual athletic department revenue beyond $200 million.\nHicks, however, had read media reports and heard alumni grumbling about Patterson's growing disconnect from the Texas fan base.\n\"I told him he needed to hire a senior person who could be his right-hand person to communicating everything he was doing, to the fans,\" Hicks recalled Tuesday, about two hours after news broke of Patterson's firing.\n\"I think it's a tragedy,\" Hicks said. \"I haven't changed my mind about Steve Patterson. I think he's one of the smartest athletic executives in the country. I think he has the fatal flaw of not being a good communicator.\"\nLast Tuesday, it was announced that former IHOP and Applebee's communications director Kevin Mortesen would become Chief of PR for Texas athletics in October.\nToo late, it turns out, to save Patterson, if in fact he was rescuable.\n\"I think he hired two great coaches, which is what an athletic director is supposed to do,\" Hicks said, referring to second-year football coach Charlie Strong and first-year basketball coach Shaka Smart. \"I think we'll get the benefit of that for many years, along with some of these longterm contracts with advertisers and sponsors.\n\"I'm just sorry for Steve that he won't be here to enjoy it. It's his own fault.\"\nPatterson's tenure lasted just 22 months, which believe it or not is not the shortest for a Texas athletic director.\nBill Ellington was athletic director for only 20 months, from January 1980 to September 1981. His departure, however, was of little shock because he was near retirement age when he succeeded Darrell Royal as athletic director.\nThat was an era in which coaches often doubled as administrators. Royal was Texas' football coach from 1957 to 1976 and athletic director from 1962 to 1980. Ellington had been a longtime assistant coach under Royal.\nWhen it came time for Texas' athletic council to select Ellington's replacement, it was widely assumed that assistant athletic director T. Jones would get the job.\nInstead, the council selected fifth-year Kansas State athletic director DeLoss Dodds, a former track coach, of all things.\nMany viewed Dodds' selection as another case of political interference, in the aftermath of former regent Frank Erwin and regent chairman Allan Shivers strong-arming the 1976 hiring of football coach Fred Akers over Royal's choice, Mike Campbell.\nIn a 2010 interview with The News , Dodds recalled that en route from Manhattan, Kan. to Austin in 1981 he stopped in Dallas to meet with Ellington.\n\"DeLoss, you've only got two problems,' Ellington told him. \"Football and basketball.\"\nHe was referring to Akers and basketball coach Abe Lemons, but, more than that, the alumni and fan divisiveness that affected the entire athletic department, especially its two marquee programs.\nDodds, who on Tuesday did not return a phone message to The News, said in the 2010 interview that it was a shock to come from an atmosphere of acceptance in his home state of Kansas to getting second- and third-guessed at Texas.\nDodds said he quickly realized he had to \"build relationships from the ground up\" in Austin. That and his ability to operate UT's massive and ever-expanding department in the black enabled Dodds to remain on the job for 32 years.\nThe replacements he hired for Lemons (Bob Weltlich in 1982) and Akers (David McWilliams in 1986) didn't pan out, nor did McWilliams' successor, John Mackovic. Still, Dodds endured, becoming the most powerful athletic director in the country after hiring football coach Mack Brown in 1997 and basketball coach Rick Barnes in 1998.\n\"You know, we had such a wonderful honeymoon with the great job by DeLoss Dodds,\" said Hicks, a Texas regent from 1994 to 1999 who was instrumental in courting Brown from North Carolina. \"DeLoss hired Mack. DeLoss hired Rick Barnes. Everything worked great.\n\"Unfortunately, everybody just kind of got old.\"\nIn November 2013, West Virginia athletic director and Texas Law School honors graduate Oliver Luck was considered the front-runner to replace Dodds. The selection of Arizona State AD Patterson was a surprise, but at least he wasn't an \"outsider,\" having been an undergrad at Texas from 1976 to 1980 and 1984 Law School grad.\nLike Dodds, Patterson inherited two significant problems _ again, football and basketball. His hires of Strong to replace Brown and Smart to replace Barnes were generally lauded.\n\"When you try to transition from one era to the next era, it's a challenge,\" said Hicks, whose brother Steve is vice chairman of Texas' board of regents. \"People want the best of the feel-good aspects of the last era, but they want to win.\n\"By the way, that's what it's all about. As soon as we start winning, everything will be fine. We just have to win.\"\nUsually, athletic directors primarily are judged on their coaching hires and ability to run a profitable program. Hicks noted fan complaints that Patterson was too focused on revenues, adding \"I don't understand, because that's what he's supposed to do.\"\nHicks, though, understands that communicating to fans is a significant aspect of the Texas athletic director's job, a part in which Patterson by all accounts earned a failing grade.\nHicks is adamant, though, in his believe that Texas fans, interim athletic director Mike Perrin and whomever's hired to succeed him will reap for years to come the benefits of what Patterson tried to accomplish in Austin.\n\"There's nothing really to do now except smooth things over,\" Hicks said. \"And hopefully next time we'll find a better fit.\"\nMore on split of Texas, Steve Patterson\n(Eric Gay/AP)\nCarlton: Steve Patterson provided blueprint of what not to do as Texas athletic director\nTexas AD Steve Patterson out after two years with Longhorns\nSherrington: With AD out, no sure things at Texas for Charlie Strong, others\nPossible Texas AD candidates include Mack Brown and Big 12 competitors\nTom Hicks calls Steve Patterson's firing 'a tragedy,' but his own fault due to 'fatal flaw'\nNational reaction: Ex-Longhorns lobby for Mack Brown to replace Steve Patterson as Texas AD\nTexas president Greg Fenves sends email to Longhorn faithful, pledges support for Charlie Strong, Shaka Smart\nNational Analyst: Steve Patterson was 'too arrogant' for Texas\nOn Twitter:\n @townbrad", "external_links": ["http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/09/15/national-analyst-steve-patterson-arrogant-texas", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/09/15/tom-hicks-calls-steve-pattersons-firing-tragedy-fault-due-fatal-flaw-inability-communicate", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/09/15/carlton-steve-patterson-provided-blueprint-texas-athletic-director", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/texaslonghorns/2015/09/15/possible-candidates-texas-ad-job-include-mack-brown-big-12-competitors", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/texaslonghorns/2015/09/15/sherrington-pattersons-legacy-texas-one-acidic-relationships", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/texaslonghorns/2015/09/15/texas-ad-steve-patterson-fired", "https://twitter.com/townbrad", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/09/15/texas-ad-steve-patterson-resigns-mike-perrin-serve-interim", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/09/15/longhorn-players-media-react-texas-ad-steve-pattersons-firing"], "published": "2015-09-15T20:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T13:42:33.552+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
