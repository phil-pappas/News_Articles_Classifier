The Bruins had beaten the Thrashers and Jets 13 consecutive times in Boston. \nOndrej Pavelec made 29 saves for the Jets. Mark Scheifele, Blake Wheeler and Drew Stafford scored in the second period to give the Jets a 3-1 lead. \nDavid Pastrnak stickhandled along the left side before wristing it past Pavelec to make it 3-2 early in the third. But less than 4 minutes later, Thorburn sneaked through the defense and put a bouncing puck past Rask to make it 4-2. Petan deflected a puck off his skate and into the net midway through the final period to make it 5-2. Alexander Burmistrov added an empty-netter \nDavid Krejci also scored for Boston, and Tuukka Rask made 26 saves. \nSENATORS 3 \nSABRES 1 \nBUFFALO, N.Y. — Kyle Turris scored twice and Ottawa won a coach’s challenge to overturn a Buffalo goal in the Senators’ victory over the Sabres. \nThe game’s outcome was essentially decided with 9:26 remaining, when Buffalo’s Evander Kane scored on a wraparound that would have tied it at 2. Senators coach Dave Cameron challenged the goal, and a video review showed Sabres forward Zemgus Girgensons was offside when Buffalo entered the zone. \nCraig Anderson made 26 saves for the victory.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T06:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T07:03:00.786+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
