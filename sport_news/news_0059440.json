Comment Posted Oct. 8, 2015 at 8:46 PM Updated at 8:54 PM Posted Oct. 8, 2015 at 8:46 PM Updated at 8:54 PM They took a significant step forward at the offensive end last season with noticeable improvement from the previous year. After finishing 25th in the NBA with only 96.2 points per game in the 2013-14 season, the Celtics jumped into the 13th spot last season by averaging 101.4 points. It marked the first time since the 2008-09 season that the Celtics scored more than 100 points per game, and the increased offense was one of the reasons why they went 24-12 to finish the year. The acquisition of guard Isaiah Thomas in late February boosted the Celtics’ scoring capabilities as he averaged a team-high 19 points in 21 games after being traded to Boston by the Phoenix Suns. Now, the Celtics are trying to find ways to be even more productive on offense in order to climb above .500 in the 2015-16 season that opens on Oct. 28. Six players averaged double figures a year ago with Avery Bradley (13.9), Jared Sullinger (13.3), Brandon Bass (10.6), Kelly Olynyk (10.3) and Tyler Zeller (10.2) following Thomas. The Celtics’ offense worked in large part because of improved ball movement, which was also on display during two wins in Europe to open the preseason this week where the team averaged 117.5 points in two wins. The Celts shot 56 percent and had 31 assists in a 124-91 win over Olimpia Milano on Tuesday, then had 26 assists on 41 baskets in a 111-96 victory over Real Madrid on Thursday. Bradley led the way with 17 points, Thomas added 15, rookie Terry Rozier scored 14 points in 16 minutes and David Lee chipped in with 13 points and 11 rebounds. The addition of Lee, a proven scorer who came from the champion Golden State Warriors in a summer trade, will give the offense a boost with his shooting and passing, but Thomas should be the leader once again. He provided a spark in the final six weeks, but the Celtics had their problems at the offensive end while getting swept in the first round by the Cleveland Cavaliers, who made a point of clamping down on Thomas. Finding reliable alternatives when teams zero in on Thomas, who made 33 percent of his shots in the series against the Cavs and hit just 3-of-18 3-pointers, will be a key this season. “Spacing and getting the ball up the floor and having shooters around him is going to be important,’’ said coach Brad Stevens last week. “We need makers around him. That’s the bottom line. Are you a big enough threat to the other team?’’ Marcus Smart, who averaged 7.8 points as a rookie, is expected to contribute more this season. “I just want him to take good shots,’’ said Stevens, whose team has the weekend off after spending six days in Europe. “A good shot for him is a shot in the paint, in rhythm off the catch, an open three. Page 2 of 2 - “Marcus has done a very good job of handling the ball when he’s been asked to do that for us. Making sure he continues to take care of it and picks the right time to take the right shots is a big step for him.’’ Depth is a strong point of the Celtics, so there should be little drop off in point production when Stevens turns to his second unit where Thomas figures to be again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T04:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T06:26:17.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
