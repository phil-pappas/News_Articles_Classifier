(Jim Gensheimer/Bay Area News Group) ( Jim Gensheimer ) SpartanCentral blog SAN JOSE -- San Jose State needs to reverse a defensive trend Saturday in a potential season-changing home game against New Mexico. \nThe Spartans have the top-ranked pass defense in the Mountain West Conference but are the worst at stopping the run. \nThat won't do if San Jose State is serious about earning a bowl invitation for the first time in the Ron Caragher era. \nThe Spartans (3-4, 2-2, Mountain West) need to win three of their final five games to become bowl eligible. A loss at Spartan Stadium to run-oriented New Mexico would make the climb K2-steep. \nIt's difficult to imagine San Jose State could win three of its final four. After a bye next week, it has home games against Brigham Young and Boise State, schools that received votes in the latest Associated Press rankings. The Spartans also have tough trips to Nevada and Hawaii. \nFirst though is New Mexico (4-3, 2-1), which runs the triple-option offense while lining up in a Pistol formation. The Lobos run 70 percent of the time, having rushed on 200 more plays than they've passed. \nNew Mexico averages 254.6 yards per game rushing with an offense that ranks 12th nationally. The Lobos gain on average 5.2 yards per carry. \n\"I know in this program as we go forward we have to be different,\" New Mexico coach Bob Davie told reporters this week. \"We have to have a uniqueness. We have to keep our identity. We can't be like everybody else.\" \nThat means the Lobos are a triple-option franchise like the undersized military academy teams. \nThree New Mexico players have gained at least 400 yards on the ground this year, including sophomore quarterback Lamar Jordan.

The Spartans are ranked 116th nationally out of 127 schools on run defense. \nIt didn't work so well against triple-option Air Force in a 37-16 defeat last month. \nCaragher and his players understand the challenge after struggling to handle the triple option the past two seasons. \nBut they hope to show a big improvement against New Mexico because of experiences with the unorthodox lineup. Success could hinge on unheralded practice players who were asked to simulate New Mexico's offense this week. \nThe coaches stressed precision tackling, knowing New Mexico can move the ball quickly. \n\"Often, it is a one-shot deal,\" Caragher said. \"You don't have a whole team pursuing when playing teams that do a good job of cut blocking.\" \nThe Spartans will need to show equal discipline on the other side of the ball, too. New Mexico tries to rattle offenses with a blitzing defense that has 20 sacks this year. \n\"New Mexico has got a complicated scheme -- same as San Diego State,\" Spartans offensive line coach Adam Stenavich said. \"A lot of different looks and a lot of different blitzes. It's going to test us.\" \nThe line took a step backward last week with quarterback Kenny Potter getting sacked four times by San Diego State. \nAnother bad performance could doom San Jose State. Stenavich has asked the line to perform with consistency. For instance, the big blockers helped the Spartans gain 543 yards against Fresno State. But they also allowed a season-high six sacks. \n\"That's not good enough,\" Stenavich said. \"That's not our standard.\" Contact Elliott Almond at 408-920-5865.
