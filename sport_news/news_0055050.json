(Coach) Pett harps on it, but he is right. Every play matters. You look back through these games and there are one or two snaps here and there. \n\"I told you the other day: there was a snap that I really focused on that I feel like would have changed the game for me. Every snap matters. I think that is the idea. Getting all 11 guys on both sides of the ball playing with that kind of focus and going 'This might be the one,' I think it will be the difference in winning close games.\" \nFollowing Monday's film session, McCown said he was \"working on\" getting over the loss to the Broncos, one in which he threw a pair of interceptions, including a turnover as the Browns were near midfield with just 44 seconds to play in regulation. \nBut on Wednesday, McCown showed the resolve of a quarterback who poured his frustration into preparation. \n\"On the day off, take some time and spend some time with my family and you move past it,\" McCown said. \"You just move through it. You work through all the stages of grief, so to speak, after a loss. You go through all these different stages and then, you have to move on. Wednesday is the day. When you hit Wednesday or really Tuesday night when some of the past plays start coming in, then you start studying and getting your mind around these guys. \n\"For me, Monday evening to Tuesday, I start to study the tape a little bit. That really helps to move on. At the end of the day, we have 10 more of these. We have to be able to move on. We have to be able to move our focus onto the Rams and take it one week at a time. I cherish these opportunities, so I think the Mondays that don't go well, it stings more for me maybe because of my age and our situation and the way the defense played. \n\"All of those things considered were why it hurt so bad. We are moving on. We gained a lot of good things. The defense played lights out. We need to bring these two things together where (the defense is) playing at a high level and (the offense is) playing at a high level. That is the type of football team we want to be. In order to do that, we have to focus and move on and not drag and linger on from that loss.\" \nMcCown especially does not want the loss to the Broncos to linger into this week, as another setback would drop the Browns to 2-5 and 4.5 games behind the front-running Cincinnati Bengals in the AFC North Division standings. \n\"You just put all the study hours you can and just go out there and make sure you are as prepared as possible,\" McCown said. \"There is a huge difference between (3-4 and 2-5). We understand that. At the same time, you can't let that be suffocating to where you go out and grip the ball too tight because we have to get to 3-4. \n\"You still have to go out and play. It is finding that balance. I think finding that balance in that is the preparation. You find that balance in your preparation. If you go out there and feel prepared, then you give yourself a better chance to have success.\" Read or Share this story: http://on.wkyc.com/1S3T7r9 TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T11:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T11:20:45.777+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
