Her hair is adorned with flowers, matching the embroidered blossom on her jacket. “Follow me,” she commands. There is a mild nip in the air. Shimla is dressed up to romance the evening ragas. The renovated Gaiety Theatre has changed the cultural landscape of this hill town. Putting the theatre back to its past glory was part of the celebrations commemorating 150 years of the foundation of Shimla. The state exchequer may have become poorer by Rs 11.48 crore in the process, but it has enriched the lives of its denizens since it opened to public in 2014. From national-level theatre festivals to ballet shows, people are now spoilt for choice. The second Shimla Classical Music Festival, a five-day bonanza (October 7-11) organised by the Himachal government and the Indian Music Society, brought maestros from both the vocal and instrumental world of music to what was once called the Queen of Hills, but is now a congested town where human traffic has to be controlled by the traffic police on weekends. The melodic strains of bansuri, or flute, played by the locals often echo through the hills, but the notes of Raga Yaman from the flute of Pandit Hariprasad Chaurasia, on the opening day, cast a hypnotic spell on the audience. The way gopis would forget their chores listening to Krishna’s bansuri, the audience lost sense of time. Panditji chose Yaman, a romantic raga played in the evening, to evoke longing and tranquility at the same time. In the hands of the maestro, the raga, considered to be rather basic, unfolded complex patterns and permutations of rhythm and musical notes. His innovative art of playing classical ragas on the flute expands the expressive possibilities of the raga, and he does so using unique techniques. Panditji’s music is not confined to Hindustani classical; he has collaborated with different disciplines of music globally, which was evident in the playfulness and the ease with which he created phantoms of melody, meandering his way effortlessly through the musical maze. The accompaniment on tabla and pakhawaj made the charm of the raga addictive. On the second day, santoor maestro Pandit Shiv Kumar Sharma chose another evening raga of an unusual character, where the tonic is not harmonically well-defined — Raga Marwa. This too is among the basic ragas of Hindustani music. The maestro created an alchemy of sound on the instrument of 100 strings, once considered unfit to play the intricacies of classical music. The modifications carried out on the instrument by Pandit Sharma introduced a new chromatic arrangement of notes, the genius of his playing techniques adding to the aural appeal of the instrument. Both artistes chose instruments of folk music to take these to a new level. Their popularity proves that it takes a genius to present complex sounds in easy discernable notes, which even the uninitiated can appreciate. Pandit Sharma rightly commented, “You need not understand music, you just feel it.” And the audience felt elated by the touch of the melody of 100 strings. Vocalist Pandit Ulhas Kashalkar entered the stage along with tabla accompanist Pandit Suresh Talwalkar. This was a new statement of equality. Traditionally, the accompanists would enter the stage before the main artiste. Even the microphones of the accompanists were set low-key. Once, Ustad Zakir Hussain removed the microphone in protest, for keeping the volume of tabla lower than the sound of the sitar while accompanying the late Pandit Ravi Shankar at Shanmukhananda Hall in Mumbai. This, even when Pandit Ravi Shankar was among the first musicians to give tabla accompanists a place of eminence in his concerts. Pandit Kashalkar, trained in three gharanas of Jaipur, Gwalior and Agra, is not yet a star like Pandit Sharma and Pandit Chaurasia, but only a very few vocalists in India can match his magical combination of the cerebral and emotive aspects of music, and of innovation and discipline in his concerts. The near-absolute creative freedom of his renderings mesmerises the connoisseurs. He is known for singing obscure ragas, but in Shimla, he chose to sing Marwa, which was played by the santoor maestro just a day before. In his first-ever concert in Shimla, he mesmerised the audience. The frail vocalist’s mellifluous voice turned out to be a dynamo, a powerhouse of notes, as the concert progressed. He used his voice like an instrument, perfectly under his control. In beet gayi raina tumhare karan (in vilambit khayal), the different ways of rendering tumhare expressed shades of pathos, surrender, anger and complaint. The powerful rendering of tans was not allowed to kill the sophistication of either the expressiveness, or the balance between his technical virtuosity and aesthetics. He pushed the boundaries of his art, the meend (slide) and gamak in varying rhythms, used in his tans to create an impression of a flag fluttering in the wind. He let the raga unfold its splendour through his voice; the raga sings him. He is constantly attempting to go further, which helps him approach the raga in new ways, to re-imagine it. Later, the maestro sang Hameer, a raga of vigorous, dramatic gait. The audience was in awe, their appreciation palpable. The audience profile for classical concerts is changing. Among the majority of old people, there was Ribhav, who attended all concerts. Just 10, he is learning music. Young girls sitting behind me Google search Nishat Khan’s (the artiste for the fourth day of the festival) lineage on their smartphone. The festival is introducing them to a different culture of listening by giving classical music centrality in the cultural sphere. Listeners like these upload YouTube clips of the concert even before it’s over, expanding the scope of music. The nephew of the legendary late Ustad Vilayat Khan, sitar player Nishat Khan comes from the Imdad Khan gharana, but combines several styles: gayaki, dhrupad and tantri. He chose a raga of the rainy season, Miyan ki Malhar. His music is delicate and complex, weaving a filigree of sounds. Like a perfect-sound architect, he shapes and designs the aural space with his instrument. His innovative skills are complemented by technical richness and superb taiyyari. Nishat has collaborated with several masters of western classical music, jazz, flamenco, etc. His brilliant artistry was, however, somewhat eclipsed by his showmanship. In the times of stiff competition and shrinking space for classical arts, the dilemma of playing to the gallery or sticking to the purity of art, at times, kills both. The festival concluded with a standing ovation for Pandit Jasraj, who regaled the audience with devotional compositions like Shivastakam, Om namo bhagwate vasudevaya and Mata kalika, revealing the character of the ragas in the detailed elaboration, and embellished with rich technical aspects of his gayaki. When the sublime emotional quality of the Sangeet Martand’s voice renders Sanskrit texts of great saint poets in classical ragas, it evokes ancient memories. The transformative musical passage ended with the need to control the crowd. It was hard for the organisers to check autograph-seekers. That is music to the ears. vandanashukla10@gmail.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T04:20:40.445+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
