Bonanni has a team-leading 58 goals this season for the No. 5 Cardinal, 14-6 overall, 0-3 in the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation. Bonanni is eight goals shy of tying Tony Azevedo's Stanford and MPSF scoring record of 332 goals, set in 2001-04. Stanford hosts UC Santa Barbara on Saturday at 4 p.m. Bonanni spoke to Daily News reporter John Reid on Tuesday. \nDN: Do you think about being close to becoming Stanford's all-time leading scorer? \nBB: I try not to think about it. I'm putting whatever I need to do to help the team first. The record doesn't matter much to me. \nDN: How is the team doing this year? \nBB: We're constantly striving to get better. We won't be satisfied until we are holding up that championship banner. We have a ways to go. \nDN: Do you have a chance to win the national title? \nBB: We aren't out of it, yet. We need to rally to come together. It depends on the way we perform. \nDN: What happened in last year's NCAA's? \nBB: We lost in the semifinals to USC in double-overtime. It was hard. \nDN: You went to high school at Mater Dei in Los Angeles. Isn't that a basketball school? \nBB: They were really good in basketball, but we were good in water polo, too. We won CIF all four years I was there. \nDN: Do you think about this year being your last year at Stanford? Advertisement \nBB: It pops into my head a lot. Thinking about it doesn't help anything. If anything, I use it as motivation to fire me up. I'll think about it when it is over. \nDN: What do you plan to do when you leave Stanford? \nBB: I immediately go play with the U.S. National Team. I'll eventually play water polo overseas. \nDN: Have you made the U.S. Olympic Team for the 2016 Olympics? \nBB: We're all fighting for a spot. We should know in a few months and that will make it less stressful. I have to stay on top of my game. \nEmail John Reid at jreid@dailynewsgroup.com ; follow him at twitter.com/dailynewsjohn .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T17:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T10:22:19.602+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
