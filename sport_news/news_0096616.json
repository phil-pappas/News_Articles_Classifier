Coach: Buzz Williams. \nConference: Atlantic Coast. \nKey returners: Justin Bibbs, the top returning scorer (11.4), played for the USA Basketball Under-19 team this summer and is expected to take on more of a leadership role this year; Seth Allen, a Maryland transfer who averaged 13.4 points two years ago but sat out last season; Devin Wilson (6.5 ppg), the too unselfish point guard who needs to be more consistent in driving the lane, getting fouled and getting the Hokies points. \nWho left: Adam Smith, the top scorer and top 3-point shooter, and reserve guard Malik Muller, the team's No. 3 3-point shooter. \nThe Skinny: The Hokies are still longer on potential than proven results, but Williams has sold them on his way, often the first and most important step in building a program. Developing consistency from the underclassmen being asked to do a lot is a top priority for the future. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T21:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T22:02:25.829+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
