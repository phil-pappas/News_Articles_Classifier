Stanley Milgram (Peter Sarsgaard) designs a psychology experiment that still resonates to this day, in which people think theyre delivering painful electric shocks to an affable stranger (Jim Gaffigan) strapped into a chair in another room. Despite his pleads for mercy, the majority of subjects dont stop the experiment, administering what they think is a near-fatal electric shock, simply because theyve been told to do so. With Nazi Adolf Eichmanns trial airing in living rooms across America, Milgram strikes a nerve in popular culture and the scientific community with his exploration into peoples tendency to comply with authority. Celebrated in some circles, he is also accused of being a deceptive, manipulative monster, but his wife Sasha (Winona Ryder) stands by him through it all.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T06:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T18:05:41.988+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
