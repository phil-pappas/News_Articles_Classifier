Julie Lemaire leaves ESU softball post for position in Florida By Corbin McGuire corbin@emporia.com emporiagazette.com | 0 comments \nThe pictures and plaques behind her desk help tell the story of Julie LeMaire’s time as Emporia State’s softball coach, which ended Tuesday when the school announced she accepted the head coaching position at Nova Southeastern in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. \nTwo-time MIAA Coach of the Year, MIAA championships — both regular season and tournament; nearly all of her accomplishments with the Hornets could be found somewhere on the wall in her office. Those tell very little of why leaving was so difficult, however. \nLook at LeMaire, specifically at her wrist, where she wears a bracelet supporting the cause of a player’s mother, and her pain to pursue another challenge becomes synonymous with leaving family. \n“I’ve become pretty attached to Emporia,” she said, adding that the players she recruited are “really like family to me.” \nHer timing is far from ideal for the state of ESU’s program, which lost seven seniors to graduation from the 2015 team. MIAA Player of the Year Stephanie Goodwin along with MIAA Defensive Player of the Year Taylor Zordel were among those lost to graduation. \n“October is the least ideal that you can have other than in the spring,” LeMaire, who spent four seasons at ESU, said of leaving. “That was a challenge in making that decision, but I think Emporia is going to be in good hands regardless of who takes over. It’s a phenomenal program. They’re going to excel and they have great young ladies who are here right now.” \nAfter meeting with the team Tuesday, LeMaire said Zordel and Kaitlyn Caston, both student-assistants, would help guide the program through the rest of fall activities until a replacement is found. \n“Everybody goes through coaching changes, and they’re in a great position,” LeMaire said of ESU’s current roster, which holds zero seniors heading into 2016. “They’re in a program that people want to be a part of and they’re in a program where they’re going to get a lot of good people trying to guide them. \n“If they just stay true to themselves and work hard for the next person coming in, they can be successful under anyone.” \nLeMaire accumulated a 164-65 record at ESU, including three trips to the NCAA Tournament, two MIAA regular season titles and one tournament championship. \n“Of course I was surprised and selfishly disappointed for our program,” ESU Athletic Director Kent Weiser said, “but I have great respect for her and understand that as you go through life your job is a part of it and your family life is a part of it.” \nFormer Nova Southeastern coach Lesa Boneè announced her resignation in late August, after 13 seasons with the program that included more than 400 wins. \nLeMaire, who started her coaching career as an assistant at nearby Lynn University (Fla.), was more than familiar with the Sharks’ notoriety as a program in the Sunshine State Conference. \n“Ever since I was at Lynn, we used to call it the ‘sleeping giant,’” LeMaire said of her new destination, almost a literal stone’s throw from the ocean. “It’s a very easy place to recruit to in terms of location and young kids, and I think that it’s always been somewhere that, in the back of my mind, I would consider as an opportunity and a place to excel.” \nOnce the job opened up, LeMaire was informed of it and approached Weiser about pursuing the “new challenge.” \n“It was a quick process, but at the same time not an easy one,” she said. “It’s just somewhere that I’ve always thought that if it did open up that it would be a place that I would look into and see.” \nThis opportunity, LeMaire added, wouldn’t be possible without ESU and the city of Emporia. \n“Being in Emporia has opened up so many avenues for myself as a coach,” she said. “Obviously it was an extremely tough decision for me to leave Emporia State. I’ve loved my time here. It’s been a great place for me to excel and meet phenomenal young ladies who have affected me on and off the field. It’s just been a great experience.” \nWeiser said the search for ESU’s next coach was already in the works, though rushing into hiring someone is the last thing he intends on doing. \n“What I absolutely will not do is just turn the keys over to somebody just to babysit the program,” Weiser said. “It’s too good and everyone has worked too hard to have something like that happen. The next person that comes in will have the ability and the drive to continue to build, and not just take over a great program. Let’s get back to the World Series. \n“Let’s keep the GPA up near the highest in the country, and lets go back to the World Series and win it this time. That’s what we’re looking for and I think we’re going to find those people.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T17:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T15:52:20.168+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
