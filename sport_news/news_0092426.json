PHOTOS: The Ohio State Marching Band in London \nThe team loaded onto buses and headed to downtown London for a parade down Regent Street. \nEarlier this year, interim director Christopher Hoch said the NFL requested the band execute a London-themed show. “(The NFL) left the creative elements up to us. We are planning a very special and exciting performance,” Hoch explained. “It will be a real thrill to have a chance to perform for the people of London.” \nIt’s the first time ever the band will travel internationally for a pregame show. \nBuckeye fans may have gotten a little taste last week of what’s to come during TBDBITL’s “British Invasion” themed show during halftime of the Penn State game. “We are very excited to be bringing the Ohio State University to Wembley and can’t wait to see what they have in store for our fans,” said NFLUK Managing Director Alistair Kirkwood. “This will be very different to anything we have done at the International Series games before and we know that the band is planning something spectacular to celebrate and commemorate being in the UK.” Watch all of the 2015 Ohio State Marching Band halftime performances \nThe NFL will cover all of the band’s travel costs for the London trip. Kickoff is scheduled for 9:30 a.m. eastern time. \nThe game will only be televised in the Buffalo and Jacksonville markets on CBS.
