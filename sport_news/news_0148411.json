And that’s the worst feeling a franchise can have.\nO’Brien benched Mallett (Michigan) for Hoyer (Michigan State) with the Texans trailing the Atlanta Falcons, 42-0, late in the third quarter, three weeks after yanking Hoyer for Mallett in an opening loss to Kansas City.\nConfused? So is O’Brien.\nMallett was 12 of 27 for 150 yards and an interception before being lifted for Hoyer, who tossed two fourth-quarter touchdowns with the game well out of reach.\n“I am disappointed in me as a head coach ... it starts with me,” O’Brien said.\n“We’ve got to run the ball, throw the ball, catch the ball,” said Mallett, who was brutally inaccurate. “Every phase of the game, we’ve got to do better.”\n“That’s Coach’s job to make that decision,” Hoyer said. “We’ll be ready to go either way.”\nMallett finished with a rating of 46.8, while Hoyer was 17 of 30 for 232 yards with the two TD passes and a 103.8 rating, all in garbage time.\nLocal ties\n• Former Lion and current Miami Dolphins defensive tackle Ndamukong Suh had three tackles. Suh, who signed with the Dolphins for $114 million as a free agent in March, has 10 tackles and no sacks through four games. (Related: Did Suh intentionally kick Ryan Fitzpatrick in the head? )\n• Oakland Raiders safety Charles Woodson (U-M) tallied five tackles, and he added an interception for the second straight week. Woodson leads all active players with 62 career INTs, and ranks tied for ninth all-time, along with Dave Brown and Lions Hall of Famer Dick LeBeau.\n• Cincinnati Bengals cornerback Darqueze Dennard (MSU) had six tackles and a pass defensed.\n• Orchard Lake St. Mary’s graduate and Jacksonville Jaguars receiver Allen Robinson caught four passes for 80 yards.\n• Kansas City Chiefs veteran wideout Jason Avant (U-M) caught four passes for 43 yards.\n• Houston Texans rookie receiver Keith Mumphery (MSU) had seven receptions for 56 yards.\nJoin us Monday night for a live blog of the Lions-Seahawks game .
