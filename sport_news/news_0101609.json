Then I realized he wasn't joking around. Then I started freaking out and started yelling at (athletic trainer) Jimmy (McCrossin). It wasn't a fun moment. The whole team was pretty worried.\"\nFortunately, Raffl was well enough to walk into the dressing room and tell his teammates he was \"fine\" during the second intermission. The Flyers are calling it an upper-body injury.\nCopyright © 2015 Score Media Ventures Inc. All rights reserved.
