The team said in a statement Coppolella has agreed to a four-year contract through the 2019 season, a term that will include the Braves' first three seasons at their new SunTrust Park.\nThe promotion was expected. Coppolella has worked with Hart since October 2014 in all duties normally handled by a general manager, including player evaluations and contract negotiations.\nThe 37-year-old Coppolella is in his ninth season in the organization. He focused on the player development, amateur scouting and international scouting departments this year.\nGiants: Reliever Jeremy Affeldt is retiring after the season, not a surprise move for the 14-year veteran as he turns his attention to family and further involvement with several causes he has worked with for years. The left-hander announced Thursday this would be his last weekend of baseball as the reigning World Series champions end the year without a playoff berth. Affeldt, 36, was the 2014 World Series Game 7 winner at Kansas City and is completing an $18 million, three-year contract. Affeldt, who allowed no runs in two-thirds of an inning in San Francisco's 3-2 loss to the Dodgers on Thursday, began the day with a 43-46 career record and 3.97 ERA in 772 appearances spanning 9242/3 innings with 28 saves. He joins right-hander Tim Hudson heading into retirement, and both will be recognized during games Saturday and Sunday against Colorado.\nRoyals: All-Star center fielder Lorenzo Cain has a sore right knee and was out of the lineup for the Royals' series finale against the Chicago White Sox . The AL Central champions also were without Alex Rios on Thursday night after he was scratched because of a stiff back. Paulo Orlando got the start in center field, and Jonny Gomes was in right. Manager Ned Yost says Cain and Rios are day to day. Cain is batting .303 with a career-high 16 homers and 71 RBIs in 139 games.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T06:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T09:49:13.948+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
