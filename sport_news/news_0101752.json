York Road reported that an elderly female resident who lived independently had not been seen since Friday. Following a well-being check, detectives determined that the 86-year old Elmhurst resident was the woman struck by the train.\nPolice had sent out a description of the woman, estimated her age at between 60 and 70 years old. She was wearing blue jogging pants and a white nightgown with a lace bow, as well as size 7 shoes. She was carrying a Lina purse that held only a key on an orange ring and glasses, but no identification, according to police.\nPolice had sent out statewide alerts to all law enforcement agencies to immediately notify Elmhurst of any missing persons who match the description of the victim. Police Chief Michael Ruth said patrol cars also had a visible presence at locations which are known to have independent senior housing and made in-person notifications to elderly care facilities in town.\nElmhurst police continue to investigate the incident.\nMegan Graydon is a freelance reporter for Pioneer Press.\n Elmhurst", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-561fc030/turbine/ct-elh-train-victim-identified-tl-1022-20151015"], "published": "2015-10-15T17:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T19:09:44.574+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
