That’s really good. And their team is really good.”\nMillburn’s stable of stellar hitters includes the 2015 NJSIAA state singles champion, Stephanie Schrage, who defeated Gibbs by scores of 6-1 and 6-1 to provide the Millers an early 1-0 lead in the title match.\nIt's a result Gibbs plans to use as motivation heading into the offseason.\n“We’re not losing anyone for next year,” the junior said. “So this is motivational in a way. It shows us how much we need to focus and how hard we need to work in the offseason to get to where we need to be to win this match next year. … We’ll have another opportunity if we put in the work.”\nAfter Millburn’s Anna Mandel and Elizabeth Gray earned a hard-fought 6-4, 7-5 victory over Jaimee Ratkoski and Natalie Cipriano, the Millers clinched the TOC crown at second doubles as Sydney Zirlin and Izzy Wuang recorded a 6-2, 7-6 (7-5) win over Victoria Vought and Emily Kong.\nAn early second singles victory by sophomore Alexandra Wojciak (6-4, 6-2) and a third singles win from Rita Vought accounted for both Hornets points.\n“It’s encouraging to see how we played, because it was definitely a closer match than last year,” said Vought, another Holmdel sophomore who battled back to defeat Joanna Atwater 2-6, 6-3, 10-6. “We can see the gap between our programs decreasing. And I think that next year, if we continue to work hard, we can win it.”\nA happy birthday: Wojciak clinched the first point of the match for Holmdel with her 6-4, 6-2 decision over Alexandra Pritsker, closing out her 2015 season with a perfect 23-0 record in team competition.\nIt was the proper way to celebrate a birthday, as Wojciak turned 16 on Wednesday.\n“The season didn’t finish up the way we wanted,” Wojciak said, “but if we can’t win as a team, I’m happy that I could do my part and do something good as an individual.”\nIf Holmdel was to be competitive in this TOC title match, a victory by Wojciak was going to be imperative, and the sophomore delivered, feeding on the pressure that came with that notion.\n“As a team we were looking to Rita (Vought) and I, and hopefully one of the doubles teams, to clinch points today,” Wojciak said. “And knowing that I had to have a point, I think that sort of pressure can negatively affect a lot of players, but it makes me more focused.”\nWith Wednesday’s result, Wojciak is now 2-0 on her birthday in her scholastic career, after earning a 6-3, 6-1 first singles win as a freshman over West Windsor-Plainsboro South’s Caroline Zhou in the 2014 TOC semifinals.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T16:10:14.347+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
