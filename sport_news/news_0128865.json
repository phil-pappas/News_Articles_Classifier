(Photo: screengrab.deadspin.com) \nCONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE WZZM-TV reporter Jamal Spencer should have waited until the final whistle before doing a live remote outside Michigan Stadium Saturday.\nHe described how the Wolverines defense was able to shut down Connor Cook and Michigan State and how the Paul Bunyan Trophy was back in Ann Arbor for the first time since 2012. Of course, quite the opposite happened as Michigan State's Jalen Watts-Jackson recovered a fumble and raced into the end zone with no time left to lift the Spartans to an improbable 27-23 victory.\nThe in-studio host for the Grand Rapids station was able to clean up after Spencer, explaining how the fumbled snap led to the last-second TD for MSU and there would be a corrected report at 11 p.m.\nDeadspin.com was first to report on the on-air mistake . Spencer offered his mea culpa via Twitter.\nNot the first time I've made a mistake in my career and it won't be the last.
