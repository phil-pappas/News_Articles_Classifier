Truett-McConnell (Ga.) is projected to finish second with 78 points, while Milligan (Tenn.) is third with 78 points. Bryan (Tenn.) (68 points) and Reinhardt (Ga.) (64 points) round out the top five. \nMaking up the second five are: Tennessee Wesleyan (56 points), Bluefield (Va.) (49 points), Point (Ga.) (25 points), Montreat (N.C.) (20 points) and St. Andrews (N.C.) (19 points). \nThe Bulldogs will look to win their third consecutive regular-season and tournament championship in the AAC. Union is 33-3 in AAC play during their last two championship runs. \nBurton and the Bulldogs are coming off an historic 2014-15 season, which saw the Bulldogs accomplish many milestones. Union finished with a 30-5 overall record, went 17-1 in league play and advanced to the round of 16 in the NAIA Division II National Championship Tournament with a 64-58 win over Northwestern Ohio. \nUnion finished ranked 11th in the final NAIA Division II Coaches' Poll of the 2014-15 season. Also, the Bulldogs at one point had NAIA Division II's longest winning streak, which ended at 21 games (a school-record). \nLast year's team was hit hard by graduation as the Bulldogs only return four players from a season ago. Returning for the Bulldogs are AAC Defensive Player of the Year Gerrard Newby (JR/Lexington, Ky. ) and AAC First-Teamer J.D. Tucker (SR/Charleston, S.C.). The duo were also members on the AAC All-Defensive Team. \nThe Bulldogs will open the 2015-16 campaign on Oct. 27, as they host Boyce (Ky.) in Robsion Arena beginning at 7 p.m. \n2015-16 AAC Men's Basketball Preseason Poll 1.
