There are no competition laws that restrict certain high schools from dominating one sport and not another, so Lincoln can achieve greatness in any sport it chooses.\nThe familiar chants of \"We're going to The Garden\" were replaced with \"We're going to Yankee Stadium \" yesterday after top-seeded Lincoln - a traditional basketball powerhouse - showed that it's also a force to be reckoned with in football.\nThe Railsplitters subdued a feisty Campus Magnet team, 22-14, in a PSAL Championship division semifinal game on Saturday to reach the title game at Yankee Stadium. The school's basketball coach, Dwayne (Tiny) Morton plans to be in attendance to see his alma mater play for a championship in the Bronx . Lincoln's football coach, Shawn O'Connor , has arranged to have Morton address the football team on Monday.\n\"He knows about winning championships,\" said O'Connor, who has been to the Garden in four of the past five seasons to see Lincoln win a city championship in basketball. \"He can talk to the kids about what it takes to win and how not to let the distractions get in the way, about staying focused. We're a big family at Lincoln. We all support each other.\"\nLincoln was supposed to host Jefferson in basketball on Dec. 7, but the contest was pushed back to not interfere with the football title game, which is scheduled for 5 p.m. that day.\n\"I want to see them win it all,\" Morton said. \"This is a big deal for the school.\"\nTwo years after finishing 1-8, Lincoln (9-0) has a chance to complete its first undefeated season since 1993 when it faces No. 2 Fort Hamilton at the Stadium. The Tigers eliminated the Railsplitters in the quarterfinals last season and are also trying to go undefeated.\n\"This is big for the school and big for Lincoln football,\" said Lincoln quarterback Andrew Vital , who ran for two touchdowns and passed for another on Saturday. \"This shows what kind of football program Lincoln has.\"\nLincoln went ahead 14-6 with 1:49 left in the third quarter when tight end Ishaq Williams caught a 56-yard touchdown pass from Vital.\nAfter falling behind even further, the Bull-dogs still had a chance to tie the score late in the fourth quarter before Lincoln's defense saved the day. With nearly four minutes left, Vital fumbled the ball after absorbing a big hit. Campus Magnet's Marlan Sabb recovered on the Bull-dogs' 44-yard line. But a sack by defensive tackle Wayne Williams on third-and-10 stalled the Bull-dogs' drive, leading to Campus Magnet turning the ball over on downs after Wavell Wint and Leonard Duzant collided trying to haul in a pass.\n\"I told Andrew not to worry about it when he came to the sideline after the fumble,\" said Williams, who finished with five tackles, two sacks and an interception that led to Lincoln scoring a touchdown to go ahead 22-6 early in the fourth quarter. \"Coach always tells us that we have the No. 1 defense. We bend but we don't break. We always have confidence that we can shut down the other team.\"\nThat confidence was put to the test several times since Campus Magnet refused to go down quietly. The Bull-dogs appeared to be in tatters after Vital scored on a six-yard keeper following Williams' interception with 11:47 left. But Campus Magnet quarterback Scott Gadsden found Allen Antoine for a 56-yard touchdown to cut the deficit to 22-14 with 9:33 left.\nAfter Wint and Duzant collided, Lincoln regained possession with 1:25 left and only had to run out the clock. The intended plan was for the Railsplitters to take a knee on three straight downs, take a delay of game penalty on fourth down and punt the ball to run out the clock, O'Connor said. But the Railsplitters ended up taking a knee on all four downs, giving the ball back to Campus Magnet with three seconds left on the Lincoln 33.\nWith one final heave, Gadsden fired the ball downfield in the direction of Wint, who was blanketed by defenders. The ball was batted away and Lincoln survived.\n\"We should never have snapped the ball on fourth down,\" O'Connor said. \"We were going to punt in that situation. Thankfully, the defense held them.\"\n\"This has been an emotional journey for the seniors, all the way back from 1-8 to where we are now,\" O'Connor added. \"It's just the result of a lot of hard work and perseverance.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T10:01:11.646+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
