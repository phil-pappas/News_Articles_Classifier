Halep has not beaten the Russian in five meetings, but said Saturday: “I know how to play against her now.” \nAgnieszka Radwanska of Poland and Italian veteran Flavia Pennetta are the other players in the Red group, while Muguruza tops the White group featuring 2011 champion Petra Kvitova of Czechoslovakia, Germany’s Angelique Kerber and Czech Lucie Safarova. \nPennetta, who shocked Serena at Flushing Meadows in September, will be making her first singles appearance at the WTA Finals after winning the 2010 doubles title with Gisela Dulko of Argentina. \nPennetta announced her retirement this year after the US Open but subsequently said she may compete in the 2016 Rio Olympics. \nThe WTA Finals features the top eight singles players competing for the Billie Jean King trophy and the top eight doubles teams gunning for the Martina Navratilova trophy. \nThis year’s event boasts a record $7 million in prize money.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T08:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T08:04:07.875+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
