Defensive tackle Sheldon Richardson’s four-game suspension is over.\nRichardson’s suspension for violating the league’s drug policy ended Monday. The Jets have a roster exemption that gives them about a week to make a roster move to add Richardson, coach Todd Bowles said.\n“It gives us an extra weapon, extra depth down there,” Bowles said. “He’s a Pro Bowl player. He’s a heck of a player. We’ve got to get him back in football shape and get him in the rotation and keep moving forward .”\nRichardson still faces charges in Missouri for resisting arrest and traffic violations for his July arrest when he was clocked doing 143 mph . He was scheduled to have a pre-trial hearing Monday, but that was delayed until Nov. 9 at his attorney’s request.\nThe NFL has not given Richardson any additional discipline. That may not come until next year if the league waits for his case to be adjudicated.\nBowles said he is not worried about incorporating Richardson into the defensive-line rotation despite strong starts from Muhammad Wilkerson and Leonard Williams.\n“No, you don’t have a challenge finding places for good players to play,” Bowles said. “You just play him.”\nBowles said it was too soon to tell if any of the injuries players suffered in Sunday’s game would cause them to miss the team’s game with the Redskins on Oct. 18.\nLB David Harris (quad), Williams (ankle), safety Calvin Pryor (knee bruise) and RB Bilal Powell (groin) all left the game and did not return.\nThe NFL ruled Dolphins DT Ndamukong Suh did not kick Jets QB Ryan Fitzpatrick in the head intentionally in Sunday’s game.\n“I have not even watched the game yet to be honest,” Fitzpatrick said. “I don’t know. I think they came out and ruled it was unintentional. So, I have no worries.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T00:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T05:34:43.231+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
