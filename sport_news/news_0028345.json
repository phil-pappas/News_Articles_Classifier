Guard Trey Freeman likes the Monarchs' chances this year as well.\n\"Our energy and enthusiasm, that might be better than last year,\" Freeman said prior to the start of practice this week. \"The intangibles, I feel like we have.\"\nTangibles, too. Enough to be picked to finish second and get three of the 14 first-place votes in a poll the league's coaches released Wednesday.\nAlabama-Birmingham, with five starters returning from a team that won the conference tournament, was picked first, collecting the other 11 votes for first.\nODU, which finished 27-8, cracked the AP top 25 for the first time and reached the semifinals of the NIT, brings back three starters and five of its top eight scorers. They'll be joined by three newcomers and three players who sat out last season.\nFreeman, a Kellam High graduate and Campbell transfer who was voted the league's Newcomer of the Year last season, leads the charge. The 6-foot-1 senior averaged 16.9 points and 3.6 assists last year and was voted to the 10-member preseason all-conference team.\nUAB placed senior guard Robert Brown and sophomore forward William Lee on the preseason squad, and will once again enjoy the advantage of having the C-USA tourney in its home city. But three years after winning just five games, ODU is positioned to have a say in the league race as well.\n\"I know we're going to go hard,\" Freeman said, referring to preparations for the season, and the challenge of blending new players into the system. \"We might make a lot of silly mistakes, but we're going to make them going 100 percent.\"\nConference USA men's basketball poll:\n1. UAB (11) 2. Old Dominion (3) 3. Middle Tennessee 4. UTEP 5. Louisiana Tech 6. WKU 7. Rice 8. North Texas 9. Marshall 10. FIU 11. Charlotte 12. Florida Atlantic 13. UTSA 14.
