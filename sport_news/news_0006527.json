Football Monday, October 26, 2015 comments Tweet This past summer, Harvard coach Tim Murphy and Dartmouth coach Buddy Teevens played a round of golf at Halifax Country Club with their old Silver Lake High football coach, John Montosi. Asked yesterday where Montosi planned to sit for Friday night’s highly anticipated matchup between the Crimson and Big Green, Murphy said, “He told me he’ll probably sit in the end zone.”\nFar from being a Hatfield-McCoy feud, the contest pits lifelong pals who will coach the two remaining Ivy League unbeatens under the lights at Harvard Stadium. Harvard has not lost in 11 night games at The Stadium, although Dartmouth poses a huge threat to that mark.\nHarvard and Dartmouth both enter at 6-0 overall and 3-0 in Ivy play. Harvard is riding a 20-game win streak, second longest in the country behind Ohio State (21). Dartmouth is on a nine-game run, capturing eight of those contests by a margin of 21 points or more. Harvard is coming off a 42-7 dismantling of Princeton, while Dartmouth edged Columbia by a 13-9 score. Harvard has its last 14 league games, while Dartmouth has beaten six straight Ivy foes.\nThe Crimson, who lead the series, 68-45-5, have won 11 straight against the Big Green, but Murphy is wary of this game for several reasons.\n“Dalyn Williams might be the best quarterback in the country at our level. He’s a do-it-all type of player. He reminds me of Russell Wilson. He can beat you with his feet and he’s an accurate passer and they have an outstanding offensive line,” Murphy said about the Big Green star. “That being said, everyone has heard about the Harvard defense, and I’m not trying to hype them, but Dartmouth might have the best defense we’ve seen in our league in two decades. They lead our league in rushing defense (63.0), pass efficiency (161.7), pass defense efficiency (98.0), and interceptions (nine).”\nOne area where Harvard must shore things up is ball security. After turning the ball over just once through the first five games, the Crimson fumbled the ball four times Saturday against the Tigers, losing two.\n“I think our guys take great pride in ball security,” Murphy said. “It’s practice. It’s execution. This won’t be a problem for us down the stretch.”\nSaturday’s win over Princeton marked the 50th time in the Murphy era that Harvard has held an opponent under 10 points.\nRed hot Crusader\nHoly Cross junior Peter Pujals has a hot hand. Last week’s Gold Helmet Award winner has thrown for 866 yards and 10 touchdowns the last two weeks. In Saturday’s 42-0 thumping of Lafayette, Pujals was 27-of-36 for 358 yards and six touchdowns, one TD pass shy of the school record.\nFour of the TD tosses went to junior Brendan Flaherty of Beverly, tying a school record. Pujals (175-of-290, 1,998 yards, 19 TDs this season) was presented the annual Dr. Eddie Anderson Trophy for being named the MVP in the family weekend game. . . .\nNice bounce-back win for Tufts , which won at Williams , 30-15, for the first time since 1981, when coach Jay Civetti was two years old. Junior Chance Brady of Haverhill, whom Civetti describes as “tough as they come,” lugged the ball 27 times for a career-high 162 yards and two TDs. Junior Willie Holmquist booted a 37-yard field goal, his 10th of the season to match a school mark.\nOff and running\nCongrats to Salve Regina junior Sam Pascale, who rumbled for 265 yards to set a team single-game rushing record, and scored twice on 33 carries in a 35-6 win against Nichols . . . . Bates fell to Middlebury , 41-27, but Bobcats senior receiver Mark Riley of Needham (10 catches, 117 yards, TD) and senior quarterback Pat Dugan of Westford (career-high 217 passing yards, two TDs) had big days. . . .\nU Mass may be struggling, but senior wideout Tajae Sharpe leads the nation in receptions with 77. Sharpe has 877 receiving yards and four touchdowns while facing the likes of Colorado, Temple, Notre Dame and Toledo.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share?text=Old+buddies+to+battle+for+Ivy+crown", "http://player.mediabong.net/se/56.js?url="], "published": "2015-10-26T11:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T08:03:23.421+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
