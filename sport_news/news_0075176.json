The company can build a tower up to 38 feet tall on that property without a conditional-use permit. \nThe vote to deny the permit for the 11th Street site was 4-3. Verizon could build a tower up to 50 feet high on that property. \nSee more in Friday's issue of the Baker City Herald.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T22:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T22:26:09.794+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
