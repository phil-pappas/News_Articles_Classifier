This was confirmed by Sangrur Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Pritpal Singh Thind here today. However, the SSP was of the view yesterday that the Army man was killed in the police cross-firing as the police had to retaliate when he started firing towards the policemen, who were asking him to surrender. Dr Jagmohan Singh, medical specialist at the Civil Hospital, Dhuri, who today conducted the postmortem examination, said during the postmortem a wad (a part of bullet) was found in the left side of his chest. He said, “A wad is found only from the body when a bullet is fired from a very close range. It seems that the Army man had shot himself with his own rifle.” Dr Jagmohan said close-range shots were also found from the bodies of Jagdeep’s sister-in-law Gurpreet Kaur and Harmandeep Singh, grandson of Labh Kaur. However, pellets were found from the body of a woman villager while no bullet was found from the body of Labh Kaur as her skull was completely blown off, he added. Meanwhile, three of the five persons, who were killed yesterday, were cremated today following the postmortem examination. Gurpreet Kaur (30), sister-in-law of Jagdeep Singh, was cremated at her paternal Punnawal village (Dhuri block), while Hasanpur resident Karnail Kaur (50) and Jagdeep Singh were cremated at Hasanpur village. Dhuri Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP) Nahar Singh said as per information Jagdeep Singh’s aunt Labh Kaur (70) and her grandson Harmandeep Singh (17) would be cremated on the return of Labh Kaur’s husband Labh Singh from Australia to India on Thursday or Friday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T04:04:09.361+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
