He has been in the recovery stage and the Indian team wanted him to take extra two weeks of rest and hence he did not play in the first two rounds of Ranji Trophy,\" Sanjay, former Tamil Nadu gloveman, said. \"With hamstring, you have to be very careful and not take chances as you never know when it can recur.\"\nVijay's fitness will be closely watched by the Indian team management as he has been in splendid form of late, scoring runs consistently for India in Tests over the last couple of years. Vijay will be a vital cog for India in the Tests against South Africa. The four-match series begins on November 7 and that will allow Vijay two matches (vs Mumbai from October 15-18 and vs Railways from October 30-November 2) to prove his fitness.\nVijay sustained a niggle during the ODI tour of Zimbabwe in July and missed the warm-up game and the first Test in Sri Lanka.\n\"To get into match fitness, you got to do a lot of other stuff to get there,\" Vijay had told wisdenindia.com in a recent interview.\nAfter missing the Galle Test, Vijay said he was \"100% fit going into the second Test but the sad thing was that in the second innings, the second over, I tweaked the same hamstring again. I had fielded for 100-plus overs, so I thought I was good. But unfortunately, when I played (Rangana) Herath in the second over of the second innings, I got a feeling that I was not 100%. I batted on (he made 82 in three and a quarter hours) and fielded for some time, but I couldn't hold on,\" he told the website.\nA fully fit Vijay will be good news for Test captain Virat Kohli and team director Ravi Shastri as they would like to continue the momentum gained in Sri Lanka against the formidable South Africans next month.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T15:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T06:17:53.764+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
