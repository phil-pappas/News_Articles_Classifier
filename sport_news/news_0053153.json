Joe Murphy / Getty Oct 21, 2015 at 2:29a ET 0Shares \nBrad Stevens might be the smartest human being on the planet. It just so happens that he also loves basketball, and decided to coach in the NBA. The Boston Celtics are more than appreciative. Joining them are Stevens' colleagues, who, according to one scout, copied some of his plays last season: I’ve been in the league a long time, and I’ve watched a lot of college coaches come in. Maybe 90% of them don’t make it. Brad Stevens made the smoothest adjustment I’ve seen. In the last two or three minutes, they won more games than anybody in the league. I know there are coaches in this league that copy his ATOs [after timeout plays] and end-of-game plays.\" \nThis is amazing. The Celtics didn't even have a top-10 offense last year, but that lackluster execution can be attributed to their below-average talent more than anything else. \nStevens is a miracle worker, and when Boston finally gives him some real players (which he may have this season), the whole league will be in serious trouble.
