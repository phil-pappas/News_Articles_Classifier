Smith Henrik Lundqvist and the Rangers can't take advantage of a tired Jets team, falling 4-1 on Tuesday night. It's back just in time for Halloween to scare the kids: It's the Rangers' power play.\nAlain Vigneault's Blueshirts suffered their first loss of the season Tuesday night at the Garden, 4-1, to the Winnipeg Jets, thanks to five unsuccessful second period power plays that culminated in Jets center Bryan Little's game-winning shorthanded goal.\nThe Rangers (3-1-0) lost the entire special teams battle. Winnipeg (3-1-0) scored twice on its power play and once shorthanded, including goals by Little in the late second period shorthanded and early third on the power play to snap a 1-1 tie. Winnipeg added an empty-netter in the final minutes.\nMats Zuccarello scored the Rangers' goal playing on their only effective line, with Rick Nash (assist) getting his first point of the season and Derick Brassard playing a mostly strong game. But they couldn't get several desperate third-period chances to go, while Henrik Lundqvist ran out of ways to bail his team out.\nThe Jets were playing on the second day of a back-to-back after falling to the Islanders in Brooklyn, 4-2, on Monday afternoon, but the Rangers couldn't take advantage of tired legs.\nBryan R. Smith Mats Zuccarello scores Rangers' lone goal on Tuesday. The Blueshirts outshot Winnipeg by a wide margin, 41-29, but Jets backup goalie Michael Hutchinson made it look easy, partly because the Rangers made it easy for him with little traffic at the crease.\nForward Kevin Hayes had one of his sloppiest and worst games as a Ranger. The power play generated eight shots on goal, but it was sequences like Hayes' long hold of the puck, refusing to shoot or pass and losing any playmaking lane, that stalled any possible momentum.\nChris Kreider was out of control and all over the place, unable to make plays.\nRookie defenseman Dylan McIlrath made his season debut for scratched veteran Dan Boyle and moved the puck early on some simple smart plays, but the game's speed seemed to overwhelm him on several occasions. He committed a few turnovers and saw just two shifts for 52 seconds of ice time in the power-play heavy second period.\nBryan R. Smith Chris Kreider goes airborne in the first period of Tuesday's loss to the Jets. Brassard's line looked better, but the Rangers center lost the key face-off in his defensive zone that led to Little's game-winning goal. And Nash and J.T. Miller fled the middle of the ice. Despite a Derek Stepan shot block, Little gathered with time and finished.\nThe Garden was back to its quiet, disappointed self even when the score was 2-1. The Jets were physical and chippy. And when the refs called the penalties, the Rangers couldn't capitalize.\nThe shine is off an undefeated start, and the Blueshirts need to get better- much better.\nRelated Stories Rangers undefeated but still flawed entering Jets game Henrik Lundqvist pulling for Matt Harvey, Mets vs. Dodgers Lundqvist, Lindberg lead Rangers over Blue Jackets, 5-2", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T06:01:13.580+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
