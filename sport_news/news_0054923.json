Comment Posted Oct. 8, 2015 at 11:27 AM » RELATED CONTENT • Brookfield @ Putnam County - District Softball The Brookfield Lady Dogs softball team is taking part in the Class 2, District 16 tournament this week at Putnam County High School in Unionville. The Lady Dogs are the five seed, and opened against Putnam County. The Lady Dogs won this contest 8-1, pulling the upset against a team that had bested them recently. “It feels good to have all of our players back, and that all the girls are playing at the top of their game at this time of year,” said Head Coach Julee Reese. “Morgan [Ewing] pitched a great game, held them off, and ept them guessing for most of the game. I am really proud of the way we ran bases and played together tonight.” Brookfield jumped out to a 1-0 lead in the top of the first. Morgan Ewing would double home Gabrielle Corf, scoring her from first with two outs. The Lady Dogs added two more in the second, with Jacey Vestal tripling home Sammie Gordon, and Sydney Wilbeck singling her home. This game would remain with a 3-0 Brookfield lead, as Ewing pitched a no-hitter going into the sixth inning. Putnam would plate one run in that inning to close the gap to 3-1. Ewing would end the game with a one-hit win, striking out 11 Putnam County batters. The Lady Dogs exploded in the top of the seventh, scoring four insurance runs. Corf drove in Wilbeck, Ewing drove in Alex Duncan, Corf stole home, Khaylee Dixon singled in Ewing, and Gordon singled home Karissa Kearns. “I feels good to keep going,” said Ewing. “Our team stepped up tonight, and I hope we can keep this going against Trenton.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T19:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T09:54:48.618+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
