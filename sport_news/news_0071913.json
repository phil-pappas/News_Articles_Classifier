We try to get our big [center Jahlil Okafor] going, and allow him to create other stuff. . . . It's just nothing about being forgotten. It's about getting everything flowing.\"\nWhile Covington stood out, the Sixers starter who is most spoken about experienced some rookie growing pains. \nOkafor was held to two points on just 1-of-6 shooting to go with four rebounds, one assist, and four turnovers in 16:56. The 6-foot-11, 268-pounder, who missed his first five shots, didn't play in the fourth quarter. His minutes are being restricted because of a sore knee. \nThe 19-year-old had a hard time getting to his desired spots on the floor while drawing crowds. Then he was stripped a couple of times once he got there. Part of the problem is that Okafor, the third overall pick out of Duke, is given no room to move even on the court as the primary offensive threat. Teams are doing everything possible to stop him, forcing another Sixer to beat them. \n\"I have to work on my entire game,\" Okafor said. \"I'm just trying to keep making progress. . . . It's preseason. So I'm trying to work everything out.\" \nHis only points came on a reverse layup over Brook Lopez with 8:28 left in the third quarter. \nHollis Thompson scored 17 points in a reserve role, while Isaiah Canaan added nine points and eight assists. \nJerami Grant had three points while starting in place of Nerlens Noel at power forward. Noel missed the game after bruising his lower back and left knee in Thursday night's 115-114 victory over the Cleveland Cavaliers. \nThe second-year player rode an exercise bike and iced his back before Saturday's game. He will be reassessed after receiving treatment Sunday. His status for Monday's game against the New York Knicks at Madison Square Garden is up in the air. \nFormer Sixer Thaddeus Young had nine points in 25 minutes for Brooklyn. Thomas Robinson, another former Sixer, missed the game with a sprained right wrist. \nRobinson embraced Sixers coach Brett Brown during Brown's pregame media availability. Then Young hugged his former coach near the Sixers bench before the game. \nChester product and Nets rookie Rondae Hollis-Jefferson scored two points before suffering a game-ending sprained right ankle in the third quarter.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T08:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T08:46:22.605+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
