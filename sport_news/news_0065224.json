It feels great.\" \nHughes' first pick gave the Knights excellent field position, and Cole Retter punched the ball in from a yard out to put the Knights on the board. Connor Bray ran the 2-point conversion to make it 8-0, but the score remained the same for the majority of the first half. \nUntil Hughes struck again, snagging a punt from about midfield and returning it for a score with less than a minute remaining in the half. Bray ran for 2 again, and the Knights held a 16-0 halftime lead. \n\"Truthfully, in the first half, I thought we played pretty well defensively, for the most part,\" Lincoln coach Phil Renforth said. \"… (W)e played most of the whole second quarter 0-0 with them, until the punt return, … I'm just disappointed that we gave up so many points in the second half because I thought overall, our defense played pretty well.\" \nThe first play from scrimmage in the second half was a 55-yard touchdown from Hughes, and Jacob Auger later ran in from 5 yards out, along with a 2-point conversion from Retter made it 30-0. \nFreshman Tanner Wilson took over at quarterback in the final quarter and scampered in from 14 yards out while Griffin Bry scored the final two-point conversion for the final score. \nThe Knights won their first TEC title in 2013, going 6-1 and sharing it with Winchester. \nThe Falcons are the last team mathematically alive to share the TEC title, but the Falcons need help from Randolph County rival Union City, which visits the Knights next Friday while Winchester plays at Centerville. \n\"I'll be honest with you, it's been great to clinch tonight, but this team doesn't want to stop there,\" Northeastern coach Mike Roeder said. \"I think that next week is the game they want to win and they don't want to share it.\" \nHughes had three interceptions and Auger had one while Dakota Green blocked a punt and Gunnar Adams recovered. Harrison Rice and Bray each had a hand in a quarterback sack as the Knights completed their first shutout of the season since last October. \n\"We just do our jobs, and when we do our jobs, things go all right,\" Green said. \nKNIGHTS 38, \nNortheastern 8 8 14 8 -- 38 \nLincoln 0 0 0 0 -- 0 \nFirst Quarter \nNE- Retter, Cole 1 run, 7:05 (Bray, Connor run) \nSecond Quarter \nNE- Hughes, Alec 49 punt return, :", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T06:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T17:46:36.531+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
