(Ben Margot) \nCLEVELAND, Ohio â€“ The Cleveland Cavaliers insisted this wouldn't be an issue. General Manager David Griffin said for this group of veterans, it wouldn't be a concern. \nWell, according to the team's superstar, that's not reality. \nSunday following practice LeBron James said there was an ' elephant in the room ' when it comes to the lengthy stalemate between the club and restricted free agent Tristan Thompson. \nEven if the Eastern Conference champs are capable of handling such an off-the-court disturbance, James has absolutely no desire of testing that out. He wants his guy in camp. Thompson is the final piece in working towards their goal of bringing a title to Northeast Ohio. \nThis situation, on this team, at this juncture, is inexcusable. \n\"The last thing you need is a distraction when you're trying to make a championship run and we have that right now,\" James said adamantly. \"It's unfortunate for both sides that we're going through it right now as a team. It's not an excuse. We will be ready to go, but hopefully something happens in the near future.\" \nHis meeting with Thompson at a wedding in Miami prompted him to plead in an Instagram photo of the two with the caption saying, \"Get it done!!!! Straight up. #MissMyBrother @realtristan13.\" \nJames seeing Thompson in person reminded him of how valuable and durable the double-double machine is to the success of the team. \nKevin Love and his recovering shoulder still isn't cleared for full contact, Timofey Mozgov is right around 60 percent after a summer knee scope and Anderson Varejao is still working his way into shape from an Achilles tear. \nAs for the perimeter players, Kyrie Irving still hasn't practiced. Iman Shumpert is sidelined for 3-4 months with his wrist injury. \n\"I would love to see us just get full at some point, hopefully it's not February, March,\" James said. \"Hopefully it's more late December, January, obviously, to see what time of team we can become. We won't reach our full potential until March, and that's OK. That's when you should start peaking, but you'd like to see what you're capable of doing earlier than that.\" \nMeanwhile, a healthy, more chiseled Thompson continues to work out in South Florida instead of with his teammates. At this point, it's not about who gets over on who. It's about doing what's right and getting the job done to preserve what is considered to be a tight-knit group of guys. \nThompson is not the most popular figure among Cavalier fans right now. He's being accused of being greedy for not accepting the offer of a reported $80 million over five years. The major criticism is that he's holding up a force that's destined for greener pastures. But his camp will make the same case: Why are the Cavaliers holding this up? \n\"It's nothing personal. This is a business,\" James explained. \"Our fans are the reason we play this game and we love our fans, but they have never been a part of the business side. They continue to push our game to new heights because of their support and I'm all for the fans, but they've never sat in the room across the negotiation process. \n\"It's hard for me to kind of say how they should feel. They want what's best for their team and our fans are the reason we play this game and we love them for sure.\" \nIt appears James is starting to press the issue. Patience is running thin. This is supposed to be Cleveland's year. This is the deepest roster he's been a part of during his professional career. His prime is diminishing by the day. He'll turn 31 in December. \nOpportunities can't be wasted. \nThis contract dispute has become absurd, considering what's at stake. The city of Cleveland has a chance at a feat that will live on for ages. James said \"both sides\" are to blame for this. Tristan isn't the only one holding out. It's a two-way street. \nIt's time to break bread. This has gone on long enough.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T03:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T05:56:25.759+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
