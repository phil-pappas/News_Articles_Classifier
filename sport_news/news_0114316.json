(Ben Solomon | Rutgers Athletics) Comments \"He's one of the best forwards in the country.'' - Rutgers coach Dan Donigan on Jason Wright \nMotivated by a next-to-last place finish in its inaugural Big Ten campaign, the Rutgers men's soccer team is on the doorstep of a regular-season conference championship in its second go-around this fall. \n\"Obviously we've only been in the league for two years,'' Rutgers coach Dan Donigan said. \"Last year was an embarrassment to ourselves. And this year we have a chance to prove to everybody who we are and what we're made of. We have an opportunity to fight for a regular-season title in this conference. So we're pumped about that, and we want to try to do our best. Simple as that.'' \nThe Scarlet Knights took a huge step toward that goal Sunday, taking over first place in the Big Ten standings by topping No. 18 Ohio State at Yurcak Field. \nWith its sixth straight triumph, Rutgers improved to 10-4-1 overall and 4-3-0 in the Big Ten. Their 12 points in the standings place them atop the league standings with one game to play in regular season. \nPLUS: Q&A with Rutgers men's soccer coach Dan Donigan \nWith Big Ten goal (13) and points (29) leader Jason Wright, Miles Hackett (6 goals) and JP Correa (4 goals) pacing the attack, with Mitch Lurie, Drew Morgan and Tyler Morris spearheading the defense and with David Greczek pitching six shutouts in net, Rutgers is riding its longest winning streak since 1997. \nIn Sunday's 1-0 win over Ohio State, Wright scored the game-winner in the 74th minute after taking a rebound off a saved shot by Miles Hackett. \n\"He's one of the best forwards in the country,'' Donigan said of Wright, a sophomore forward from Jamaica. \"I don't think I'm going out on a limb saying that. He's only a sophomore but the kid has shown tremendous maturity and growth as a player. It also helps when you have a good supporting system around you. And I think Miles Hackett, JP Correa, Erik Sa, Mitchell Taintor and Brian Hawkins â€” all those guys have added tremendous support for Jason. \n\"But he's gotta take a little bit of the credit as well. Not everybody goes out there and scores the goals and creates the havoc that that kid causes. He's a tremendous talent and he's a tremendous player.'' \nOne year after posting a 6-12-1 mark in its first Big Ten season, Rutgers has reached the 10-win plateau for the first time since a 2011 campaign that ended in the third round of the NCAA Tournament. \n\"Last year, unfortunately we did it to ourselves,'' Donigan said. \"When you're able to get some positive results in this conference, even if it's a couple of wins, you're going to be fighting to host a (Big Ten) quarterfinal game. That's how competitive this conference is. We only have nine teams so everybody beats up on everybody in a course of a soccer season.'' \nALSO: Rutgers men's soccer team hoping for reversal of fortunes \nDonigan understands his Scarlet Knights haven't accomplished any of their goals yet. A Nov. 4 game at Maryland (after a non-league showdown with Nebraska-Omaha at Yurcak Field Sunday) awaits but he says the conference crown is theirs for the taking. \n\"I think what we've found out is the Big Ten, it's a whole different level,'' Donigan said. \"In this conference, it's just the physicality, the maturity of the players, it's just another level in my opinion. We made a couple adjustments quite honestly. I think our kids have grown from their experience within this past year being in this conference. It's allowed us to learn and correct some things, and then take that new approach into our performance on a game-to-game basis. \nMORE : Rutgers honors Carli Lloyd for World Cup soccer win \n\"I'm not saying it happens overnight. We still have some things to improve just from a recruiting and personnel standpoint. But what our guys have done in terms of the maturity they've shown in the past year, I'm very, very proud of them.'' \nKeith Sargeant may be reached at ksargeant@njadvancemedia.com .
