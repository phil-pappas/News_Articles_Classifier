Pittsburg football dropped 42 points in the first half against Ark City and continued to roll, beating the Bulldogs 56-0 Friday at Hutchinson Field. The Purple Dragons had touchdowns in all three phases of the game in their win over ACHS in front of the home crowd. The offense had three different players score in the first half, while the PHS special teams and defense got in on the scoring with touchdowns in the second quarter. “It was as complete a game that we’ve played all year,” Pitt State head coach Tom Nickelson said. “I was very, very proud of their effort, execution and what they did. It was just a great team win for us. Pittsburg’s Chiantia Allen scored both the special teams touchdown and the defensive touchdown, with a 65-yard punt return as well as a 55-yard pick-six for a score. “He hit a gear that he hadn’t hit for a while,” Nickelson said. “He had a pretty major hamstring injury last year and tried to keep playing through it and kept re-injuring it. He’s physically been healthy for a while, but when you do that, it takes you a little while to trust it again. He cut it loose tonight and showed how fast he actually is. I think that’s going to carry through the rest of the year.” The Purple Dragons moved to 6-0 after the blowout win over Ark City. PHS’ defense was dominant against the Bulldogs, specifically in the opening half when the first string was on the field the entire half. They held Ark City to 21 rushing yards and 47 passing yards — 38 of which came on one play — while forcing a pair of turnovers in the first two quarters. “I thought they played very, very well,” Nickelson said. “Our linebackers did a really good job of reading their pulling guards. We felt if our defensive line could control the line of scrimmage, our linebackers could fill the holes and they did a great job … That was a complete team effort that took everybody doing their jobs.” The Purple Dragons used their final game before district play begins to prepare for the Kansas City schools they will see in the coming weeks. “We wanted to have confidence in all three phases of the game versus a spread team like this,” Nickelson said. “We wanted to be clicking and have a lot of confidence moving forward.” PHS quarterback Spencer Turnbull finished the game a perfect 6-for-6 passing for 144 yards. He added 52 yards on the ground. Page 2 of 2 - “His passes were on the money. It was either our guy was going to catch it or no one was going to catch it,” Nickelson said. “Hopefully, we got a little more confident in our passing game tonight.” Running back Sherrick Rogers finished the night with 96 yards rushing with a pair of touchdowns. Rogers had 48 yards receiving for the Purple Dragons. Dante Menghini had 59 yards on the ground, with two scores and a fumble for PHS. Zack Roark had 51 yards receiving on a pair of receptions in the win. After forcing a Bulldog three-and-out, PHS went on a seven-play, 70-yard drive to put the first touchdown on the board when Rogers took the ball on a sweep left and ran to the far pylon for a 9-yard touchdown. The Purple Dragons extended their lead to 14-0 after Turnbull faked the end around on the read option and took the ball up field, dodging would-be tacklers on the way to a 9-yard touchdown run. With 11:24 left in the game, Rogers had his second rushing score of the game when he took the handoff left for an 8-yard touchdown to push the PHS lead over the Bulldogs to 21-0. Allen pushed the PHS lead to 28 points with his punt-return touchdown following the Purple Dragons’ defense forcing the Bulldogs into a three-and-out on their ensuing possession. Allen struck again late in the second quarter when he intercepted Bulldogs quarterback Hunter O’Toole’s pass and put a spin move on a Bulldog defender at the sideline to evade the tackle, sprinting his way to the goal line for the score. The defensive touchdown sent the Purple Dragons into the locker room with a 42-0 lead. Menghini scored on a 3-yard run with 7:10 left in the third quarter, and Sherrick Rogers added a 63-yard gallop for a score at the end of the period to push the lead to 56-0.
