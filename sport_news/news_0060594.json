We don't speak for him. We are just thankful for the support he gave us,\" Woodfill said.\nFormer Houston Astros star Lance Berkman also opposes the ordinance and has filmed an ad for the campaign.\nThe ordinance, passed last year by the Houston City Council , bans discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity in the nation's fourth-largest city. It aims to protect gay and transgender people against discrimination in employment and public places.\nConservative activists said voters, not councilmembers, should decide whether Houston has such an ordinance and succeeded in a petition drive to put the question on a ballot. Mayor Annise Parker and other defenders of the law say a repeal would damage the reputation of the city, which hosts the 2017 Super Bowl.\nMcNair said he doesn't tolerate discrimination of any kind and believes the city could rewrite a stronger ordinance that would give protections for \"all Houstonians.\"\n___\nFollow Paul J.
