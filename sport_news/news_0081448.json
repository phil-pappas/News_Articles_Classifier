Edmonton scored 22 unanswered points to defeat the Lions after B.C. held a 23-7 lead in Jennings’ first start, on Sept. 26. \nTedford said the decision to go with Jennings has to do with his rapid progress and the readiness of Travis Lulay, who returned to practice from a partially torn MCL.“Travis is probably 90 per cent, but Jon is playing as well as any quarterback in the league right now,” Tedford explained. “We’re going to stick with him.” \n“We have to make sure we don’t take the second half lightly and go out there and finish business,” Jennings added. \n‘AWFULLY SPECIAL’: Back in the day, special teams were called suicide squads, and there was nothing sophisticated about that segment of the game. All guts, little glory. But now, with no full-blown wild men anymore, special teams play is more sophisticated and strategic, as the Blue Bombers demonstrated by schooling the Lions in that important art. A blocked punt, a blocked convert, a fumbled kickoff return and two gimmick plays in punt formation were instrumental in the Blue Bombers’ come-from-behind win. \nCo-ordinator Chuck McMann called the Lions’ special teams play Oct. 3 against Saskatchewan “awful.” Saturday was worse. \n“I wish I knew the reasons for the breakdowns,” he said. “We need to be more mentally alert. It was really disheartening to have a game in hand and have it taken away. If the guys didn’t understand the importance of special teams before, they do now.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T05:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T07:34:24.657+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
