Thursday night was not one of those times, however, mostly because of poor defense, but in part because Krejci also helped put the puck past his own goaltender. Krejci gave the Bruins a 1-0 lead in the first period, but they dropped their season opener, 6-2, to Winnipeg at the Garden. Over the previous four seasons, the Bruins went 40-8-4 when Krejci scored at least one goal, but this loss snapped the Bruins’ three-game winning streak in season openers. Because of groin and knee injuries last season, Krejci played only 47 games, tying the 2012-13 lockout season for the fewest games of his career. The 29-year-old Czech also scored just seven goals, his fewest since his rookie season in 2007-08. The Bruins missed Krejci last season, going 16-13-6 without the veteran playmaker compared to 25-14-8 with him. So Bruins fans were thrilled to see Krejci score the team’s first goal of the season Thursday. David Pastrnak stole the puck from defenseman Ben Chiarot behind the Winnipeg net then skated into the corner and tossed the puck out in front where it hit off Chiarot’s stick. Krejci picked it up and flipped a backhander past goaltender Ondrej Pavelec for an unassisted goal to put the Bruins up, 1-0, at 5:36. “I tried to get there,” Krejci said, “hope for a rebound and that’s what happened. I moved back in and it was pretty easy to put it in the back of the net.” “We missed him last year,” Bruins coach Claude Julien said, “and it’s nice to see him get off to a strong start.” But Krejci’s goal turned out to give Boston its only lead. The Bruins made too many mistakes on defense and Krejci made a couple of them. In the opening minute of the second period, Krejci turned over the puck on the power play, but Tuukka Rask stopped Andrew Ladd on a breakaway. Then with 14:43 left in the third, Krejci reached in from behind to get a stick on the puck and redirected it when Chris Thorburn was credited with beating Rask to boot Winnipeg’s lead to 4-2. “Yeah, it’s just kind of a tough night,” Krejci said. “I got a stick on it and it just went in. So it’s tough luck.” The Bruins defense clearly missed captain Zdeno Chara, who is out with an upper body injury, and Dennis Seidenberg, who is out with a back injury. The six goals were the most allowed by the Bruins in a season opener since an 8-3 loss in Florida on Oct. 6, 2006.
