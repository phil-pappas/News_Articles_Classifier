(Photo: Mike Dornbirer/News Journal) Buy Photo \nThe Bucyrus Redmen earned their second win of the season in dramatic fashion. The Wynford Royals, Galion Tigers and Colonel Crawford Eagles all continued to roll. And the Buckeye Central Bucks’ playoff hopes took a hit. What a Week 9 it was. \nBucyrus Redmen 32, Ridgedale Rockets 27 \nThe Redmen got a much needed win on Friday night. The win keeps them from the basement of the Northern 10 Conference and a good starting point for their offseason plans. Some good things happened as well as some bad, but the only thing that matters is the W. \nIronically, it was the run game that got the Redmen going. It has been the Achilles’ heel for the Redmen all season long. A lack of a run game has made the Redmen a one-dimensional team all season, but the Redmen have found it the past couple of weeks. \nThis week it was Bailey Johnson. The Redmen also flipped the script and returned a kickoff for a touchdown. Bucyrus went on a streak that lasted about three weeks of giving up a kickoff return. \nPlayer of the Game: Johnson was the difference maker in the contest. He finished with 146 yards on 24 carries and two touchdowns. \nStat of the Night: Bucyrus freshman Harley Robinson returned a kickoff 77 yards for a score in the fourth quarter. \nWynford Royals 47, Buckeye Central Bucks 6 \nThe Royals continue their dominance over the entire N10. The numbers are staggering. Since the birth of the N10, Wynford has yet to lose a conference game. They have only really been challenged once in a 14-13 win at Carey last year. \nThey showed why they are still the kings of the N10 Friday night knocking off the Bucks in a blowout. \nThe Bucks playoff hopes took a serious hit on Friday night. They were clinging to the No. 8 spot in their region and the loss will likely knock them out of that spot. They Bucks are in a must-win situation in Week 10. A win could propel them back in the picture. \nZach Hoffman was yet again masterful for the Royals. He paced an offense that racked up 475 yards of total offense, 346 on the ground. \nAthen Moyer did something not many football players have been able to do all season on the Royals. The Bucks running back piled up over 100 yards on the stingy defense, 113 to be exact. \nPlayer of the Game: Hoffman was the easy choice. He ran for 212 yards and four touchdowns. He threw for 129 yards and two more scores. His passing scores were to Braxton Tea both times. \nStat of the Night: Bucks quarterback Grant Loy completed a 68 yard pass to Brice Brenneman for the Bucks lone score. \nColonel Crawford Eagles 38, Upper Sandusky Rams 20 \nThe Eagles were one of those teams in control of their own destiny. Friday night, the Eagles sealed the deal. A win over the Rams should cement the Eagles as a playoff team and possibly a lock to host their first-round game. \nThe voting committee is going to have a very tough decision to vote on N10 Player of the Year with the performance Eagles quarterback Will Kirkpatrick turned in. His four total touchdowns paced the offensive juggernaut to another win. \nHe connected on just five passes to two different receivers. Owen Adams caught three of them for 69 yards and a score, and Brock Cotsmire caught just two for 111 yards including a 90 long. \nPlayer of the Game: Again, a no-brainer Will Kirkpatrick earns the honors. He completed 5-of-8 passes for 180 yards and a score. He also ran for 179 yards and three touchdowns. \nStat of the Night: The Eagles fumbled the football five times but only lost one of them. \nGalion Tigers 62, North Union Wildcats 21 \nThe Tigers began the season shutting out opponents in three consecutive ballgames. They are looking like an offensive powerhouse at the end of it. \nThe 62 points marks the second time in two weeks the Tigers put up over 60 points on an opponent after dropping 70 last week. With the offense outburst, Chase Cooke has seemed to finally found his groove at the Tigers quarterback. \nA big help to the development of Cooke has been running back Drake Barnett. The power back turned in another game-breaking performance. \nPlayer of the Game: It is impossible to pick between Barnett and Cooke, so they both get the honors this week. Cooke was 10-of-12 passing for 289 yards and a touchdown. Barnett ran the football 16 times for 144 yards and four touchdowns. \nStat of the Night: The Tigers hung a 34 spot in the second quarter alone. Barnett scored three times in the quarter. \nMohawk Warriors 70, Crestline Bulldogs 13 \nA week after the Bulldogs broke a losing streak dating back to Week 3 of 2013, they had to go up against the Mohawk Warriors. It resulted in a 57-point loss. \nJC Clark tried to follow up his performance from last week with another great outing. He ran for 43 yards on Friday. \nPlayer of the Game: For the Bulldogs, JR Wolfe gets the honors by throwing for 74 yards and running for nine more including an 8-yard scoring run. It was the only offensive touchdown of the night for Crestline. \nState of the Night: Davon Triplett returned a fumble 16 yards for a Bulldog touchdown.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T19:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T23:10:33.817+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
