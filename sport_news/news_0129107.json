Most Popular By Dylan Montz, correspondent October 18, 2015 | 6:33 pm \nAMES — In two plays, Joel Lanning made a statement with his play that he wouldn’t necessarily verbalize later that night. \nSimply put: Lanning gives the Cyclones another dimension to an inconsistent offense that could use a spark. \n“It’s not my call how many snaps I get or anything,” Lanning said. “It is what it is. Obviously I’m in there for what I’m supposed to do and I executed the play so hopefully it was good enough for them.” \nLanning played just two plays — consecutively in the first quarter — in Iowa State’s 45-21 loss to No. 3 TCU, including a 74-yard touchdown pass to receiver Allen Lazard. The other play was a one-yard run, but when the Cyclones (2-4, 1-2) allowed 31 unanswered points, Lanning stayed on the sideline. \nIowa State coach Paul Rhoads said Lanning’s snap count “will be a part of our Sunday analysis” and didn’t elaborate on the sophomore any further. Last week against Texas Tech, Lanning orchestrated the ISU offense throughout much of the fourth quarter in a game that was all but decided, but his throw to Lazard against the Horned Frogs (7-0, 4-0) was his first touchdown pass. \n“I don’t really know when they’re making a call for me or anything,” Lanning said. “I just stand right there and when they call my package I just run in there and run the play. Maybe I was expecting it a few more times in the game, but it is what it is and not a big deal.” \nThe decision to not go back to Lanning isn’t the lone reason Iowa State couldn’t put together a scoring drive after the first quarter, certainly. The Cyclones had 262 yards of offense in the first 15 minutes and 199 in the final 45 and converted just 3-of-12 third downs. \nRhoads’ decision making in the first quarter was reminiscent of his early years at Iowa State when he faked a punt on the first drive that set up an ISU score. In stark contrast, a decision to punt on fourth-and-three from the TCU 45-yard line — down 10 points — in the second half left many scratching their heads. \n“For 15 minutes offensively, we were executing at a high rate,” Rhoads said. “Defensively against a very high-powered offense, we were competitive with key stops and a big turnover finally. Special teams had some big plays and could have had another opportunity there to really have a big play and give us field position to get some momentum.” \nStill, first-quarter success gave spectators a glimpse of what the Cyclones could accomplish on offense if it can gain consistency. \n“If we finish games it can change the whole outcome of the season,” said receiver Quenton Bundrage. “If we would have finished this game, who knows what the score would have been or if we could have had the W.” \nl Comments: montzdylan@gmail.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T01:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T21:18:28.367+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
