New Castle is 1-8. \nThis is the first meeting between the teams since 2013 when the Trojans announced they were leaving the NCC for the Hoosier Heritage Conference. \n\"They (the players) know this is a ball club that has struggled at times during the course of the season, but is capable of doing some things and does have some very good players,\" Holeva said. \n\"They have some pretty good athletes. They like to stretch the field vertically on you. They like to run a lot of jet sweep and that kind of stuff. Defensively they are very similar to us. They run a 4-4 base with limited blitzing. ... We have to be ready to pick up whatever they throw at us.\" \nNew Castle's lone win this year came on Aug. 28, 7-3 over Rushville. \nThe Trojans have lost seven straight games since then, including last week's 28-22 loss to Greenfield-Central to close out the regular season. \nCody Werking leads New Castle's rushing attack with 483 yards. Quarterback Dalton Engle has thrown for 727 yards and nine touchdowns, six of them to Brady Renner. \n\"We want to be physical, fly to the football and tackle,\" Holeva said. \nRichmond is coming off a 55-21 loss to NCC champion Kokomo last Friday. \nJordan Christian has thrown for 1,211 yards and 12 touchdowns for the Red Devils while Jawuan Claiborne has 544 yards rushing and six touchdowns and teammate Park Holland has 466 and eight. \nDre Davis leads Richmond receivers with 407 yards and four scores. \n\"We've shown bits and pieces of being explosive as a team, but we haven't been very consistent on the offensive side of the ball,\" Holeva said. \"Being consistent and taking care of the football and executing are what we want to see on the offensive side.\" \nThe RHS-New Castle winner will face either Delta or Greenfield-Central on Oct. 30 in a semifinal. Richmond would be the home team with a win Friday. \nJay County faces Mt. Vernon and Connersville takes on Pendleton Heights in the other half of the bracket. \n\"I think as the season has progressed, we've gotten better at some things,\" Holeva said. \"We're going in with the hopes of trying to be better this week than we were last week. \n\"It's an exciting time for us. It's what every team in the state of Indiana plays for this time of year.\" \nJosh Chapin: (765) 973-4463 jchapin@pal-item.com or twitter.com/JoshChapinPI \nAt a Glance \nWhat: Richmond at New Castle in Class 4A Sectional 22 \nWhen/where: 7 p.m. Friday at New Castle \nRecords: RHS is 5-4; New Castle is 1-8 \nLast meeting: RHS won 49-3 in 2013 at Lyboult Field \nSeries: RHS leads 72-22-3", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T23:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T01:34:52.111+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
