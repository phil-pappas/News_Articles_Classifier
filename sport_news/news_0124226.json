But after exiting that game, Lynch didn't play against the Lions last Monday or Sunday against the Bengals.\nIn his place, rookie Thomas Rawls has thrived as the Seahawks' feature back. Against the Bears, he averaged 6.5 yards per carry and racked up 104 yards. Against the Lions, he was shut down along with the rest of the offense, but he responded by carrying the ball 23 times for 169 yards and a touchdown against the Bengals. And that means the Seahawks can afford to ease Lynch back into the fold, considering Rawls figures to snag a few carries as long as he continues to produce like he has been.\nSo far this season, Lynch is averaging just 3.4 yards per carry and has failed to reach the end zone. The Seahawks are also struggling to find their footing, winning just two of their first five games. Beast Mode will be back against the Panthers.
