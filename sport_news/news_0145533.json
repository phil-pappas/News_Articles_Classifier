He only had nine broken tackles, however, and averaged less than two yards per attempt after contact (1.87), so it’s no surprise he hasn’t locked down the running back position full time. \nHis performance last week against the San Diego Chargers was encouraging: he totaled 125 yards from scrimmage on 15 touches, including a 53-yard reception and a 32-yard run. However, the Chargers are second to last in rushing yards allowed per carry (4.9) this season. This week they face the Baltimore Ravens, who allow 3,9 yards per carry, 11th best in the NFL. \nPlus, Duke Johnson Jr. continues to get a bigger role in this Browns offense. Since McCown replaced Manziel 2 games ago, Duke Johnson has 17 passing-game targets & 27 touches. Played season-high 61% of snaps last week. \n— Evan Silva (@evansilva) October 6, 2015 And although he was stuffed, Duke Johnson also got critical late-game goal-line work over Isaiah Crowell last week against the Chargers. \n— Evan Silva (@evansilva) October 6, 2015 \nOpportunity is everything in fantasy football, and right now Johnson is being featured more in the passing game and is having more success all phases. \nFor example, Johnson has been asked to run a pattern 76 times and has made 15 catches for 117 yards. Crowell has just 44 snaps in route with five catches and 75 yards. \nJohnson has averaged 2.5 yards per carry after contact, breaking 10 tackles on 31 attempts. Crowell’s numbers are 1.8, four and 49, respectively. \n“Anytime you have a back that can be a first or second down back between the tackles, and a guy that you can also split out your number one wide out and hit him on a vertical route, that puts a lot of stress on a defense,” said coach Mike Pettine said of Johnson. “He certainly will be a big part of our plans moving forward. That’s a pretty good glimpse of how we’ll be using him.” Neil Greenberg analyzes advanced sports statistics for the Fancy Stats blog and prefers to be called a geek rather than a nerd. sports Success!
