His first didn’t come until the third quarter.\nBoth teams have byes next week, as usual for teams playing in London. Miami (1-3) will face lots of questions about its poor performances thus far.\nFitzpatrick threw for 172 yards in the first half, including a 58-yard completion to Brandon Marshall on the first play. Marshall had 107 yards receiving by halftime and finished with 128 for the Jets (3-1).\nThe hard-running Ivory scored the first touchdown from 3 yards to start off his ninth career 100-yard game. Fitzpatrick later completed a 10-yard TD pass to Eric Decker in the second quarter and Zac Stacy rushed in from the 2 in the third.\nNick Folk converted all three extra points and added field goals from 22 and 48 yards. But he missed a 40-yard attempt.\nThe Jets ended up with 207 yards rushing, including 34 from Fitzpatrick, and 425 total yards on offense. Ivory’s 166 yards were the most by a Jet since Thomas Jones ran for 210 in 2009.\nBesides controlling Suh, the Jets got some help when Dolphins cornerback Brent Grimes went out with a right knee injury in the first quarter.\nThe Jets gave the Dolphins some hope, though, with 14 penalties for 163 yards. And Miami’s first score, in the second quarter, came with plenty of aid from New York’s secondary.\nRyan Tannehill threw deep to Jarvis Landry, and Darrelle Revis was called for a 36-yard pass interference. On the next play, Tannehill threw to Jordan Cameron, but Marcus Gilchrist was whistled for another pass interference, good for 22 yards.\nTannehill found Jake Stoneburner on the next play for 8 yards make the score 13-7.\nTannehill ended up with 198 yards and two touchdowns on 19 of 44 passing. His second score was a 10-yard pass to Kenny Stills in the fourth quarter.\nBut the Dolphins failed to come up with the big play, going 0 for 12 on third downs and 0 for 4 on fourth downs.\nIt was the 12th regular-season NFL game at Wembley Stadium, the home of England’s national soccer team. It was also the first of three scheduled for this season. Buffalo will take on Jacksonville on Oct. 25, and Detroit will face Kansas City on Nov. 1.\nIt was the first time the Jets played in the NFL’s International Series, the third time for the Dolphins. They lost the first game in 2007, 13-10 to the Giants. Last year, the Dolphins beat the Oakland Raiders 38-14.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T02:16:19.890+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
