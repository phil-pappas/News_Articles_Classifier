(Photo: Erich Schlegel, USA TODAY)\n4 CONNECT 6 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Phil Simms has a pretty good sense of what the past few months have been like for Tom Brady, whose fourth Super Bowl victory as the quarterback of the New England Patriots was overshadowed by the phenomenon that became Deflategate.\n“My God, he won the Super Bowl and all he deals with the whole offseason is, ‘Hey, Tom, what about the footballs?’ “ Simms, the lead analyst for CBS, told USA TODAY Sports this week. “And on top of that, people are whispering behind his back. What a terrible injustice.”\nSimms, the former New York Giants star, followed the twists and turns of the NFL’s case against Brady and the Patriots that dominated pro football’s news cycle since February.\nYet even Simms, with all of his enthusiasm in following the game, got burned out by a case that still lingers with the NFL appealing the decision by a federal judge to vacate Brady’s four-game suspension.\nUSA TODAY\nPelissero: Colts' woes can be traced back to Deflategate\nIn case you missed it, the NFL punished Brady for being generally aware that the footballs used by the Patriots in the AFC title game were deflated – and for failing to fully cooperate with the investigation.\n“If it’s true, it’s a big deal,” Simms said. “If not, it’s a terrible thing to have out there in the court of public opinion.\n“It got to a point where it was, ‘We’ve got to move on.’ “\nBrady has seemingly done just that. He’s off to one of the most efficient starts of his career. In leading the Patriots to 4-0, he leads the NFL with a 121.5 passer rating that is bolstered by his 11 TD passes without an interception, and 72.5% completion rate.\nAnd with the footballs undoubtedly inflated to legal levels, Brady won the NFL’s Offensive Player of the Month award for September.\nNow an AFC title game rematch against the Indianapolis Colts looms on Sunday night at Lucas Oil Stadium, fueling more conversation about the effects of Deflategate.\nOne thing for certain: Despite the controversy, Brady’s stature remains high in the fraternity of quarterbacks, judging from the reaction of some of the league’s greatest passers.\n“He’s just having an amazing season,” Hall of Fame quarterback Warren Moon told USA TODAY Sports. “I knew he would. He’s so fiery, so competitive. He’s proving a point. ‘No matter what you think of me, I can play it as well as any quarterback ever has.’\n“I’m sure that every game he plays in, I’ll bet the officials are told, ‘Make sure there’s nothing funny with the footballs.’ I’m sure they’re still trying to get him. I’m sure the league does not like the way they came out of this. This is showing them, ‘I can play, no matter what.’ ”\nMoon doesn’t doubt one of the key findings from the investigation led by attorney Ted Wells, which concluded that Brady was at least “generally aware” of alleged efforts by two Patriots staffers (a full-time assistant equipment manager and a game-day locker room attendant) to deflate footballs.\nThat conclusion, in addition to the revelation that Brady apparently destroyed a cellphone as the investigation progressed, painted – outside of New England -- the face of the NFL’s most successful franchise of this millennium as a cheater.\nUSA TODAY\nMatt Cassel no quick fix for Cowboys' offensive woes\nThe former star quarterbacks, though, are hardly that hard on Brady.\n“I always thought the infraction was like a traffic citation,” Hall of Famer Steve Young told USA TODAY Sports. “But what I think of Tom, it hasn’t detracted from that.”\nAdded Moon: “I guarantee you he had some knowledge. Those guys (handling the footballs) are not going to do it if it’s something he doesn’t like. Whatever they’re told, they got it done. But I don’t think it’s that big of an advantage.”\nSimms likens deflated footballs to a corked bat, or a basketball made easier to handle.\n“Where do you draw the line?” Simms asked.\nThe quarterbacks agree that wherever the line is drawn, Deflategate was blown out of proportion.\n“A federal case over freaking air in the ball?” Moon said. “It became a thing where both sides dug in and wouldn’t budge.”\nConsidering the millions of dollars spent on the investigation and legal fees, Moon surmised, “That would have fed a lot of homeless people.”\nYoung acknowledges the appeals process, and the possibility that Brady might someday be punished if the lower court’s ruling is overturned (although Judge Richard Berman may still rule on other components of the case).\n“Maybe it won’t ever be resolved,” Young said. “Honestly, I’m not interested in the (legal) issue. I’ve kind of set it aside. But what’s being accomplished on the field…he just marches on.”\nAlthough Young marvels at what Brady is accomplishing at his age – “He’s 38!” he says – he is more impressed by his mental discipline. Young doesn’t take for granted Brady’s ability to find purpose in honing his game in his 16th season through the turmoil.\n“This guy is remarkable in his ability to stay focused,” Young said. “Most people get distracted, or use it as an excuse. Tom is like, ‘Give me more. I can handle it all.’ “\nDan Fouts, another Hall of Fame quarterback, is similarly impressed. Mentally, Fouts likens Brady to a “steel trap.”\n“You always hear, ‘My safe place is on the field, in practice, in the locker room.’ That’s so true,” Fouts told USA TODAY Sports. “That safe place gives you the chance to focus on your job.”\nSomeone asked Simms recently whether he thinks the start that Brady has had is fueled by motivation extracted from Deflategate.\nSimms laughed.\n“Part of his success and his great accomplishments over the years…the word is determination,” Simms said. “He found the perfect partner in Bill Belichick. I know they look different, but they are so much the same person.”\nUSA TODAY\nFor Josh Johnson, NFL life is a daily uncertainty\nSimms mentioned to Brady an exchange that he had with Belichick, who bemoaned the lack of perfection during a dominant Patriots performance. The coach was wasn’t happy with the tackling on defense, or with the lack of big plays in the passing game.\n“You only scored 50, but you need to hit more passes downfield,” Simms told Brady.\nThe response from Brady, as Simms recalled it, came with a grin.\n“Yeah,” Brady said, “I know.”\n“That never, ever ends,” Simms said. “Bill will say to him, ‘Yeah, you had a great game, a great season. Now I need to see it in OTAs. They are the greatest plodders in history. Unemotional. It’s another work day.”\nWith or without Deflategate.\nFollow NFL columnist Jarrett Bell on Twitter @JarrettBell\nVIDEO PLAYLIST: LATEST FROM THE NFL NFL Monday Hot Reads: What we learned in Week 5 | 02:27 USA TODAY Sports' Tom Pelissero takes a look at the lessons learned from NFL Week 5.
