The big play took a lot of the pressure off the favored Lions and they were able to gain control from there. \nTop performer : Junior forward Mayv Clune assisted on Pearce's goal and then scored on a powerful backhand to give the Lions a 2-0 lead with 12:35 left. \nWhat it means : Southern Lehigh gave Moravian a great battle for 40 minutes but the Lions have so much strength and balance across the field and are tough to match up with. Moravian will be favored to win the District 11 Class AA Tournament, although Southern Lehigh may still have something to say about that down the road. \nTom Hinkel may be reached at thinkel@lehighvalleylive.com .
