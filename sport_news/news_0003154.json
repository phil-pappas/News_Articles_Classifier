(Image Source: Mark Zerof/USA TODAY Sports) \nThe AFC has three undefeated teams, the New England Patriots, Cincinnati Bengals and Denver Broncos. Here’s a look at how they got there. \n-The Cincinnati Bengals (4-0): The last time Cincy was 5-0 was 1988, they won 12 games and made it all the way to the Super Bowl that season. \nPivotal Pieces: He has often been criticized in his career, but QB Andy Dalton is off to a fantastic start. The TCU product is averaging 10.2 yards per pass with nine TD passes to just one INT for an AFC-leading 123.0 passer rating. Dalton benefits from having a star wide out like A.J. Green , as well as a balanced offense. \n“With running backs Jeremy Hill and Giovani Bernard , that’s pure power and then pure speed. That’s what you want in the backfield,” says former NFL wide receiver and NFL Network analyst Nate Burleson. “When you have complementary players at the wide receiver position, at the running back position, it gives Andy Dalton the confidence in knowing they can go out and beat anybody.” \nThird-year man Bernard is tied for third in the AFC with 297 rushing yards and Hill leads the conference with five rushing touchdowns. \n-The Denver Broncos (4-0): When you think of the Broncos you think of QB Peyton Manning , however they are winning more with defense than offense this season. The Orange Crush leads the NFL in passing defense (185.3 YPG) and total defense (275.5 YPG), while ranking second in scoring D (17.2 PPG). \nPivotal Pieces: The Denver secondary is loaded with playmakers like CB’s Aqib Talib and Bradley Roby , as well as S T.J. Ward . It was Talib who had the game-winning TD (51-yard INT RT) in their 19-13 Week 1 win over Baltimore, while Roby scooped up a fumble and returned it to the painted area in the final seconds of their 31-24 W over Kansas City. This past Sunday it was Ward who sealed their 23-20 win over Minnesota with a strip sack in the game’s final minute \n“For a long time when you mentioned a team that Peyton Manning was on it was purely offensively,” says Burleson. “But that Broncos defense is stepping up. They have guys on every level that can make plays.” \nWhat makes their defense so good is their ability to create turnovers and get to the QB. The Broncos lead the NFL with 18 sacks and their 11 forced turnovers are second in the league. \n-The New England Patriots (3-0): While Peyton Manning is leaning heavily on his defense, the way Tom Brady won Super Bowls early on in his career, the Pats are the league’s most explosive offense four weeks into the season. New England leads the NFL with 39.7 points and 446.3 yards per game. Their 119 points match the 2000 St. Louis Rams for the most through three games by a defending Super Bowl Champ. \nPivotal Pieces: It’s all about Brady. He’s just the second player in the history of the NFL to throw for 1,100-plus yards (1,112) with nine TD passes and no INTs in his team’s first three games. Peyton Manning—yes, those two are forever linked—was the first in 2013. \n“ Tom Brady is one of the most efficient quarterbacks in this league,” says Burleson. “The Patriots figure out the weaknesses of each team and then they exploit those weaknesses. They don’t just attack. They exploit the weaknesses of every defense they face.” \nWith two TD passes in New England’s 51-17 Week 3 win over Jacksonville, Brady became just the fifth quarterback in NFL history to crack the 400-TD pass plateau. \nDaniel Mogollon is a member of the Pro Football Writers of America and the Football Writers Association of America.
