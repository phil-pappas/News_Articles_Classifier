Game 3 win gives Mets a leg up and some payback against Dodgers 1 / 1 Back to Gallery NEW YORK — With big hits rather than beanballs, the Mets wiped out the Dodgers and took the lead in their testy Division Series.\nCurtis Granderson drove in five runs with two doubles off the wall, Travis d’Arnaud and Yoenis Céspedes homered, and New York’s dangerous bats busted loose for a 13-7 victory Monday night that gave the Mets a 2-1 advantage in the best-of-five NL playoff.\nBefore a crowd of 44,276 in the first postseason game at Citi Field, the Mets broke their postseason scoring record as public enemy No. 1 Chase Utley watched from the Los Angeles bench. New York quickly erased an early three-run deficit and made a winner of Matt Harvey in his playoff debut.\n“The greatest retaliation is winning,” Mets outfielder Michael Cuddyer said.\nBack in the postseason for the first time in nine years, New York can reach the NL Championship Series with another win at home Tuesday night behind rookie pitcher Steven Matz .\nTrying to save the Dodgers’ season, Clayton Kershaw will start on three days’ rest.\nUtley is the subject of scorn in New York after his takeout slide Saturday broke the right leg of Mets shortstop Ruben Tejada at Dodger Stadium. Utley was eligible to play but didn’t after appealing a two-game suspension from Major League Baseball over the play.\nAmid speculation the Mets would seek revenge, manager Terry Collins said before the game Harvey was told not to.\n“I thought our guys responded very, very well,” Collins said.\nHarvey labored through five innings in his first outing since missing a mandatory postseason workout.\nFormer A’s lefty Brett Anderson took the loss. He was tagged for six runs and seven hits in three innings.\nThe Dodgers peppered Harvey with four straight singles in the second inning to build a 3-0 lead. But the Mets responded in the bottom half with four runs, the big blow a bases-clearing double from Granderson to give them the lead for good.\nUp 7-3 in the fourth, Céspedes took an admiring look at his three-run drive in the fourth off Alex Wood that soared an estimated 431 feet into the second deck in left field.\nThat gave the Mets a 10-3 lead and fans turned their focus to chanting “We want Utley!” and “Where is Utley?”\nMets vs. Dodgers\nMETS LEAD Series, 2-1\nGame 1: New York 3, L.A. 1\nGame 2: Los Angeles 5, N.Y. 2\nGame 3: New York 13, L.A. 7\nGame 4: Los Angeles (Kershaw 16-7) at New York (Matz 4-0) 5:07 p.m. Tuesday TBS\nGame 5: (if needed) at Los Angeles: 5:07 p.m. Thurs.
