Chelsea gives public backing to Mourinho 1  /  2 Back to Gallery LONDON (AP) â€” Chelsea has taken the unusual step of publicly endorsing its belief in manager Jose Mourinho following the team's disappointing start to the season.\nChelsea released a statement Monday, saying that Mourinho \"continues to have our full support\" and he is \"the right manager to turn this season around and that he has the squad with which to do it.\"\nIn a dreadful start to the defense of its title, Chelsea is 16th in the 20-team Premier League after winning two of its first eight games. The Blues lost 3-1 at home to Southampton on Saturday.\nChelsea has also lost one of its first two group games in the Champions League .\nOn Sunday, Liverpool fired manager Brendan Rodgers and Dick Advocaat resigned as Sunderland manager.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T11:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T17:17:30.758+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
