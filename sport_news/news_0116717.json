These have resulted in seizure of 74,846.359 tonnes pulses so far. Total 6,077 raids have been conducted by the states after the amendment in the Central Order under Essential Commodities Act,\" an official statement said.\nAs a result of the de-hoarding drive, the states have reported declining trends in the prices of pulses, it added.\nOut of 74,846.35 tonnes of pulses seized so far, the maximum of 46,397 tonnes have been recovered from hoarders in Maharashtra followed by Karnataka at 8,755.34 tonnes; Bihar at 4,933.89 tonnes; Chhattisgarh 4,530.39 tonnes; Telangana 2,546 tonnes; Madhya Pradesh 2,295 tonnes and Rajasthan 2,222 tonnes.\nDal prices have risen across the country due to a shortfall in domestic output by 2 million tonnes in 2014-15 crop year on account of deficient and unseasonal rains.\nMoreover, the supply in global markets is also limited.\n\"The Centre has asked the state governments to have meeting with millers, wholesellers and retailers to make pulses available in retail markets at reasonable prices,\" the Consumer Affairs Ministry said, adding that few states have already moved in this direction.\nIn a communication to the states, union territories, the Centre said the distribution of pulses at reasonable prices through ration shops by some states has helped stabilising the prices and asked other states to consider this step.\nAs per the Consumer Affairs Ministry's data, retail prices touched as high as Rs 210 per kg on Friday. Urad was selling at Rs 190 per kg, moong dal at Rs 130 per kg, masoor dal at Rs 110 per kg and gram at Rs 85 per kg.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T15:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T06:04:28.151+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
