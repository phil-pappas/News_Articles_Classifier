Political conflicts take their toll on the economies of Libya, Iraq, and Syria, said Ahmed, with the latter's GDP contracting by half during its conflict, and Yemen's by a quarter.\nIn addition, Lebanon and Jordan are facing economic burdens due to the region's refugee crisis.\nOn the other hand, oil prices are expected to remain lower than before their recent plunge.\nAccordingly, oil-exporting countries have been severely damaged, recording losses of $360 billion in 2015.\nBut oil-importing countries benefited from the plunge in oil prices ,with gains amounting to $12 billion in 2015, which balanced the growth rates in the region.\nAs such, oil-exporting countries grew at a slower pace in 2015 than previous years, recording 2.5 percent compared to 2.7 percent in the previous year, while oil-importing countries grew more than in previous years with an average of 2.6 percent in the current fiscal year, compared to 1.8 percent in the previous year.\n\"Generally, growth has not changes. What has changed is the distribution of growth in the region,\" said Ahmed.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T15:06:52.895+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
