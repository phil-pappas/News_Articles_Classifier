In the video, Crowley can be heard saying Manziel “hit me a couple times.” Crowley, who officers noted was intoxicated at the time, declined to press charges.\nManziel, meanwhile, who spent part of the offseason in an alcohol rehabilitation facility, admitted he, too, had been drinking alcohol earlier in the day, but he denied hitting Crowley. He said he grabbed her once to stop her from jumping out of the moving vehicle.\nIn one of the most interesting moments of the video, Manziel’s teammate lineman Paul Kruger arrives to the scene apparently just by happenstance. Crowley goes on to complain “it’s not fair” that he was there. Kruger, meanwhile, tells police, “She’s not the right one he should be with.”\nOn Friday, shortly after news of the incident first broke, Manziel and Crowley both said they were still together, however. They took to social media to chalk the incident up to a simple couple’s argument.\n“Colleen and I got into a dumb public argument on the way home Monday afternoon,” Manziel tweeted Friday . “It probably looked more interesting than it was and I know I would stop and check if I saw a couple arguing on the side of the road. It was embarrassing but not serious and when we talked to the police and they realized everything was alright and I was sober, we went home together and everything is fine.”\nCrowley added on Instagram, “J & I are good.”\nAccording to Manziel in the dash cam video, the dispute began when Manziel said he wanted to pick up another friend. Crowley objected and tossed his wallet out of the vehicle’s window.\nThe NFL has not released a timeline about when it might decide on the matter.\n[ Bill Cowher says he would cut Manziel ]\nThe Browns, meanwhile, have decided to keep Manziel listed as active for now.\n“We’ve dealt with it, it’s not like we ignored it,” Coach Mike Pettine said at a Monday afternoon press conference (via the AP) . “Until we had all the information from the police and when the league concludes their report we’ll have a more total picture of what happened. But given the details that we had, we made our decision based on the details we had in hand.”\nThe Browns are set to take on the St. Louis Rams on Sunday.", "external_links": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/9bxtQw8TuDQ?feature=oembed", "https://twitter.com/JManziel2/status/655165925822480384", "http://bigstory.ap.org/urn:publicid:ap.org:e3c85e146b634b5a8945014226f1bd36", "https://twitter.com/@marissapayne"], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T21:57:12.209+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
