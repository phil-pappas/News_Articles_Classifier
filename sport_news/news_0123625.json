It was early August in Terminal 4 at JFK Airport, hardly the softest landing spot for the first leg of Evgeny Medvedev ’s journey, and his ride to his new home had gotten stuck in traffic. He understood the steep challenges—culturally, linguistically, athletically—that awaited his arrival in the United States. Now, feeling the thick summer air, much hotter than where the 33-year-old had spent his entire professional career in Russia, it all felt real.\n“He don’t know what hit him,” says Slava Kuznetsov , the professional skating coach who eventually plucked Medvedev from the airport and drove him to the Philadelphia Flyers ’ practice facility in southern New Jersey. “Everything just, like an avalanche, hit him hard.”\nWitness, then, the difference made in two months. On Monday night, Medvedev debuted at home during the Flyers’ 1–0 win over Florida when he joined a first-period rush and helped clear space for Brayden Schenn’s eventual winning goal.\nLater, once he finished his standard 20-minute postgame workout, Medvedev returned to an otherwise empty Wells Fargo Center locker room, sat at a teammate’s stall, offered a handshake and said, in friendly and rhythmic English, “Hello. Good to meet you.”\nNHL Blackhawks’ Russian phenom Artemi Panarin making an instant impact by Jeremy Fuchs", "external_links": ["http://video.nhl.com/videocenter/embed?playlist=2015020035-X-h", "http://twitter.com/@Alex_Prewitt"], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T04:17:39.483+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
