We knew we had to go into this game with the correct mind-set.\"\nCBA (8-8-1) advanced to Monday's quarterfinal and will visit No. 1 Ballston Spa.\n\"This is our sectional game,\" Keith said. \"It's been our goal to win for three years.\"\nSince Crisafulli's return, the Brothers are 5-0-1. He's scored at least one goal in five of the six games he's played in.\n\"He's a terrific asset to the team,\" CBA coach Steve Freeman said. \"He brings an added dimension. I'm so happy for him. He's playing well and he's healthy.\"\nCBA and Niskayuna (7-9-1) were scoreless until Crisafulli headed in a free kick by Keith to provide his team a 1-0 edge 14 minutes into the game.\n\"Noah always looks for me on free kicks,\" Crisafulli said. \"I followed the ball in the air and luckily I was in the right position and was able to head it in.\"\nThe score remained intact until Niskayuna senior Noah Daviero leveled the game midway through the second half.\n\"I was nervous,\" Crisafulli said. \"I didn't want to end my season.\"\nWith 12 minutes remaining in the game, Keith found Crisafulli, who sent a shot over the head of Silver Warriors goalie Joe Romano for the winner.\n\"Noah and Matt play year-round together,\" Freeman said. \"They complement each other very well.\"\nFollowing a Niskayuna red card, Keith added an insurance goal with 1:20 left to play on a free kick.\n\"That was a great feeling,\" Keith said. \"What's better than that? Great foul won by Matt.\"\nBrothers goalie Joe Lauria stopped five shots. Romano made five saves for Niskayuna.\nCBA will have its hands full on Monday against Ballston Spa.\nThe Scotties, who defeated the Brothers 4-1 in sectionals last season, are 16-0 and ranked No. 4 in the state.\nBallston Spa handed CBA a 5-1 loss back on Sept. 26.\n\"Their defense is good, their offense is good ... there's nothing bad about them,\" Keith said. \"We'll have to bring our 'A' game.\"\nFreeman said, \"They're terrific. Super experienced. For us, it's a matter of can we compete for the first 10 minutes and kind of go from there.\"\njkoehler@timesunion.com • 518-454-5411 • @JKoehlerTU", "external_links": ["http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/55/27/8836607/5/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/55/27/8836602/5/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/55/30/8836608/5/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/55/27/8836604/5/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/55/30/8836608/5/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/55/27/8836603/5/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/55/27/8836606/5/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/55/27/8836601/5/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/55/27/8836605/5/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/55/27/8836603/5/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/55/27/8836607/5/920x920.jpg", "http://timesunion.mycapture.com/mycapture/remoteimage.asp?backtext=Back%20to%20Times%20Union&image=http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/55/27/8836604/5/628x471.jpg", "http://timesunion.mycapture.com/mycapture/remoteimage.asp?backtext=Back%20to%20Times%20Union&image=http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/55/27/8836607/5/628x471.jpg", "http://timesunion.mycapture.com/mycapture/remoteimage.asp?backtext=Back%20to%20Times%20Union&image=http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/55/30/8836609/5/628x471.jpg", "http://timesunion.mycapture.com/mycapture/remoteimage.asp?backtext=Back%20to%20Times%20Union&image=http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/55/27/8836606/5/628x471.jpg", "http://timesunion.mycapture.com/mycapture/remoteimage.asp?backtext=Back%20to%20Times%20Union&image=http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/55/27/8836603/5/628x471.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/55/27/8836605/5/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/55/30/8836609/5/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/55/27/8836601/5/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/55/27/8836604/5/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://timesunion.mycapture.com/mycapture/remoteimage.asp?backtext=Back%20to%20Times%20Union&image=http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/55/27/8836602/5/628x471.jpg", "http://timesunion.mycapture.com/mycapture/remoteimage.asp?backtext=Back%20to%20Times%20Union&image=http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/55/27/8836601/5/628x471.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/55/27/8836602/5/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/55/30/8836609/5/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/55/27/8836606/5/920x920.jpg", "http://timesunion.mycapture.com/mycapture/remoteimage.asp?backtext=Back%20to%20Times%20Union&image=http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/55/27/8836605/5/628x471.jpg", "http://timesunion.mycapture.com/mycapture/remoteimage.asp?backtext=Back%20to%20Times%20Union&image=http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/55/30/8836608/5/628x471.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-23T07:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T08:31:25.649+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
