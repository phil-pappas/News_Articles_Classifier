This is absolutely incredible. To win for club and country is a dream come true.\"\nWatch: Lauren Holiday, FC Kansas City talk about winning the NWSL championship FC Kansas City's Lauren Holiday, Vlatko Andonovaki and Amy Rodriguez talk about winning the 2015 NWSL championship title.\nShortly after the U.S. Women's National Team won the 2015 FIFA Women's World Cup in July, Holiday, who is only 28 years old, made the surprising announcement that she would be retiring from professional soccer at the end of the year.\nWhile Thursday marked Holiday's final professional game, the midfielder will play in the remainder of the USWNT's victory tour games before officially hanging up her cleats.\n\"I don't think I'm done with soccer, like I don't love the game anymore, that I'm not passionate about it,\" Holiday said. \"It's more so that there are other things I want to do... There are other passions that I have and that I want to explore.\"\nAs FC Kansas City prepared for Thursday's championship game, Holiday's imminent retirement was on the mind of every Blues player.\nThough they tried not to speak about it directly with Holiday in the days leading up to the game, the Kansas City players desperately wanted to bring home a second championship for their beloved midfielder.\nHoliday has been a huge part of FC Kansas City since 2013, when she earned NWSL player of the year. The Blues recently announced that they would be retiring Holiday's number 12.\nWatch: Seattle Reign's Megan Rapinoe and Laura Harvey talk about falling in the NWSL Championship Game Seattle Reign midfielder Megan Rapinoe and coach Laura Harvey talk about Seattle's 1-0 loss to FC Kansas City in the NWSL Championship Game.\n\"It's going to be weird when she's not right behind me on the field or that player giving me that pass, but I'm excited for her to enjoy retirement,\" said forward Amy Rodriguez, Holiday's roommate and best friend. \"She's got a passion for so many other things beyond soccer that I'm excited for her to go see and experience.\"\nWhile she said she feels physically capable of competing for FC Kansas City and the U.S. Women's National Team through another World Cup cycle, Holiday said she knows it's time for her to move on. She plans to spend more time with her husband, Jrue Holiday, who is a point guard for the New Orleans Pelicans, and pursue the other interests in her life.\n\"I've never had that chance to explore,\" said Holiday, a devout Christian. \"I am passionate about a lot of things. I'm passionate about women, empowering women. I'm passionate about kids and just helping people, serving people. I want to serve.\"\nThe world-renowned midfielder earned her first cap with the U.S. Women's National Team in a game against Germany in January 2007. Holiday went on to earn two Olympic goal medals with the national team and was a key piece of this summer's Women's World Cup-winning team.\nWhile Carli Lloyd's hat trick earned the headlines following the USA's World Cup win in July, it was actually Holiday who scored the game-winning goal against Japan in the World Cup final.\n\"It's sad to see her go, especially at such a young age,\" Seattle Reign midfielder Megan Rapinoe said. \"Selfishly, I want her to keep on playing. I think she's such a fantastic player, one of the best players I've ever played against and played with.\"\nEven though Holiday knew she would be playing in her final professional game Thursday, she tried not to let the emotions get to her in the days leading up to the match.\nBut after the game and after hoisting yet another trophy, tears finally filled Holiday's eyes.\n\"The winning is absolutely wonderful, but the friendships are what I am going to cherish the most,\" Holiday said. \"That's what I'm going to take away and that's what I'm going to miss.\"\n-- Jamie Goldberg | jgoldberg@oregonian.com\n503-853-3761 | @ jamiebgoldberg", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/Jamiebgoldberg"], "published": "2015-10-02T05:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T10:11:17.583+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
