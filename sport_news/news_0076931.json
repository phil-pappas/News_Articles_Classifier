Indianapolis Colts coach Chuck Pagano answers some of your questions Dana Hunsinger Benbow , dana.benbow@indystar.com 8:46 p.m. EDT October 19, 2015 \"We all buy into the plan; that's the way it is,\" Indianapolis Colts quarterback Andrew Luck says a day after the ill-fated, fake punt play against the New England Patriots on Oct. 18, 2015. Clark Wade/IndyStar The Colts sent out a tweet asking for fans' questions for coach Pagano. You can imagine what kind of questions they got.

And Chuck Pagano can answer the questions he wants to answer. \nAfter the Indianapolis Colts sent out a Twitter offer early Monday asking fans to tweet in questions for the coach to answer on his \"Colts Monday Night\" radio show, the questions poured in. They were mean and nasty. They came from depressed fans. They came from outraged fans. \nThey wanted to know if Pagano would be fired for the fake punt play (Griff Whalen snapped the ball to Colt Anderson on fourth-and-3 from the Colts' 37) Sunday night against the New England Patriots. They wanted to know who called that play. They wanted to know if Pagano had started packing his bags to leave town. They wanted to know if the Three Stooges would be calling the next Colts' game plays. \nBut during the fan question segment of the show on \"The Fan\" on WFNI-AM (1070) and -FM (107.5), just three fans' questions were asked (easy questions). Then, the show's host and Colts announcer Bob Lamey veered into his own line of questioning -- without any mention of another fan's name. \nThe three fan questions that made the cut and Pagano's answers … \nFrom Jeffrey S.: Why did Griff Whalen snap the ball on the fake punt? \nPagano: \"From a communications standpoint, I didn't do a good enough job with all 11 players that were on the football field. Again, we've looked at it extensively, we've talked about it enough. We looked at it today and now it's time to put that one to bed and move on.\" \nFrom Sarah of Indianapolis: I know you don't believe in moral victories, but do you feel like your team played better against New England than you have against them in recent years? \nPagano: \"Yeah. Again I go back and I think, you know, this team can play with anybody and we've beaten some outstanding football teams over the years...We beat a Denver team, a Seattle team and a San Francisco team all in the same season. So, I feel like this team can play with anybody. We were right there. We came up a little bit short, but we'll learn from it and we'll grow from it.\" \nLandon from Indianapolis: What was your assessment of how Andrew Luck played last night after missing those two games? \nPagano: \"Again, you know, don't want to beat a dead horse, but he played well. He made great decisions. He spread the ball around, targeted 10 different receivers. Again, over 300 yards passing, three touchdowns, no interceptions...He did a nice job.\" \n(The following was published prior to Monday night's radio show.) \nPerhaps Monday was a bad choice. One night after Sunday night, less than 24 hours after the Indianapolis Colts tried that ill-fated, fake punt play — a play that didn't just irk fans, it caused many of them to turn against their team — perhaps this wasn't a good night. \nA good night for what, you ask? A good night for the Indianapolis Colts to ask fans to send in questions for coach Chuck Pagano to answer on the radio. \nThe offer came in a tweet from @paganoshow, retweeted by @colts: \"Tweet your questions for Coach Pagano here and have them answered tonight on @Colts Monday Night starting at 6 on @1070thefan .\" Tweet your questions for Coach Pagano here and have them answered tonight on @Colts Monday Night starting at 6 on @1070thefan — Chuck Pagano Show (@PaganoShow) October 19, 2015 \nYou can imagine the kind of questions they got for the coach one day after Griff Whalen snapped the ball to Colt Anderson on fourth-and-3 from the Colts' 37. . @PaganoShow @Colts @1070thefan I apologize in advance for what's about to happen to your mentions sir — Simon your head (@reverendmalibu) October 19, 2015 \n\"Coach, can you tell us what child won the 'you get to call a play' contest on that fake punt?\" \n\"Do you consider the fake punt a success because no one died (that we know of)?\" @PaganoShow @PFTCommenter @Colts @1070thefan did you intentionally run the worst play in history or was that by accident?", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T04:50:27.788+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
