(AP) - President Barack Obama has nominated Emily Gray Rice to serve as U.S. Attorney for New Hampshire.\nU.S. Sens. Jeanne Shaheen and Kelly Ayotte said Thursday they would support Rice, who would need to be confirmed by the Senate.\nShaheen said she recommended Rice because of her background as a professor at the University of New Hampshire Law School, her work as a trial lawyer and her career in the New Hampshire Attorney General's Office. Ayotte said she has a long history of leadership.\nRice would replace acting U.S. Attorney Donald Feith.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
