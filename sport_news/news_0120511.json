(THE CANADIAN PRESS/Peter Power) Ticats need Mathews to take command of QB role \nHAMILTON — Hard to argue with Anthony Woodson’s take on life in the Canadian Football League. \n“The more you can do, the harder it is for them to get rid of you,” the Hamilton Tiger-Cats running back said on Tuesday after practice at Tim Hortons Field. \n“My biggest thing is when I do get the opportunity to play, hopefully the coaches see it is as nothing changes, that there is no difference between me and the starter.” \nWoodson demonstrated as much on Sunday in Montreal during the Ticats’ 23-11 victory against the Alouettes. As Michael Ford went out with a lower-body injury, Woodson stepped up, finishing with 38 yards on 12 carries and 20 yards on one catch. \nFord will remain on the sideline on Friday night when the Ticats visit the B.C. Lions in Vancouver, though head coach Kent Austin indicated the injury was not expected to be a long-term problem. \nWith that in mind, Woodson normally would be leaned on more heavily. The indication however is that the team’s No. 1 running back, C.J. Gable, will return to the active roster. Gable suffered an elbow injury on Aug. 3 against the Toronto Argonauts and hasn’t played since, missing the past 10 games. \n“Unless there is a setback, he looks like he is ready to play,” Austin said. “We will see. I don’t anticipate any issues, but you never know.” \nLinebacker Simoni Lawrence, who also departed the game in Montreal because of injury, practised Tuesday. \nWoodson can be plugged in at various spots and on special teams. That versatility is what Austin found attractive in the off-season, signing Woodson after the Calgary native spent last season with the Argos. \nWhile Woodson doesn’t get the headlines, his ability to move around the field seamlessly is vital. \n“When we have had to thrust him into multiple roles ... that is why we brought him in, to be the guy who can catch the ball, he can carry the ball out of the backfield, he can protect the quarterback,” Austin said. “He has done a good job for us.” \nA fourth-round pick by the Winnipeg Blue Bombers in 2010, the 27-year-old Woodson was traded to the Argos during the 2013 season. If he has found a permanent football home in Hamilton, it will have been with the help of his father, Tony, who had a CFL playing career that included stops in Calgary and Ottawa. \n“It’s like having a football encyclopedia next to me,” Woodson said. “I was able to learn how to be a professional and how to be a football player, things I have to do off the field to prepare. That is really what I took from him.” \nAdvice comes in the form of phone calls between the two on a regular basis, and the younger Woodson has started to look ahead to his post-playing days, though he wants his career to continue as long as possible. \nWoodson has a business degree in petroleum land management from the University of Calgary. \n“That was another big lesson I learned from my dad,” Woodson said. “When he was done with his career, which ended through injury, it was kind of a sudden. He had to work two or three jobs and it was a grind for him for the first bit. He has always preached to me to be prepared when my career comes to end. \n“You have six months (a year) to live your dream — play football and get paid doing it — and then you have six months to train, continue to prepare, but you also have some free time to look into other endeavours for when your career ends.” \nRight now, Woodson’s focus is on what happens between the whistles. \n“It’s always good to get the shot,” Woodson said. “When I get in there I’m just trying to keep the offence running like it is supposed to. I just want to do my part.” \nEARLY DEPARTURE \nVisits to the beautiful city of Vancouver have been ugly for the Hamilton Tiger-Cats in recent years. \nHamilton has lost their past three road games against the B.C. Lions, with the most recent victory coming on July 22, 2011. In their past 10 trips to the West Coast, the Tiger-Cats have returned home with a win on just three occasions. \nThe team is scheduled to travel on Wednesday night for the game on Friday night at BC Place. \n“We’re going out a night earlier to get them acclimated (with the three-hour time difference),” Ticats head coach Kent Austin said on Tuesday. “They need to take advantage of that and be pros about their preparation.” \nThe Tiger-Cats own the third-best offence in the Canadian Football League, averaging 378.7 yards a game. By contrast, the Lions allow an average of 389.5 yards a game, the second-most in the CFL. Only the Saskatchewan Roughriders (411.8 yards a game) are worse. \nWhat does Austin expect from the Lions when Hamilton has the football? \n“I wouldn’t talk about it,” Austin said. “We don’t talk about what we are anticipating seeing.” Sponsored Links", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T03:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T06:16:36.484+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
