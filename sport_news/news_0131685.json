It was Oregon’s first loss to a Northwest team since 2007. The Huskies host Oregon at 7:30 p.m. Saturday. One Husky fan is starting a #FreeAzeem campaign on Twitter. Austin Meek of the Eugene Register-Guard: Oregon is in denial and isn’t scaring anyone any more. The Ducks had won 100 games in a row when leading by 10 points. Oregon’s future is in jeopardy . WSU added insult to Oregon’s defeat on Twitter . Utah held on to beat Cal at home. Cal’s Jared Goff threw five interceptions in the loss. Arizona State ran away from Colorado , 48-23. A mad college football season got madder Saturday. From what I can find — this is 1st time since at least '96 that #Wazzu and #UWHuskies have won on same wknd as double-digit underdogs\n— Tim Booth (@ByTimBooth) October 11, 2015 \n\nMy AP Top 25 ballot:\n1.
