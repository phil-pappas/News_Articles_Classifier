We are so depleted, and I’m so proud of our guys for stepping up. I know we can look ugly, but we’re finding a way. Wins are wins.”\n>> Videos | Football highlights from around central Ohio \n>> High-school football results, box scores from Week 6 \nThe task is more difficult with starting quarterback Gavin Lyon out indefinitely because of a sprained right (throwing) shoulder. But backup Daniel Kreuzer connected with Andrew Wallace for a 78-yard touchdown, Benny Snell ran for an 8-yard score and the defense came up with four stops in the second half as the Warhawks defeated the Jaguars 14-9 at Bradley.\nSomehow, Westerville Central (6-0, 3-0) is in first place in the Ohio Capital Conference Cardinal Division and second to 2014 state champion Lakewood St. Edward in the Division I, Region I computer playoff standings.\nThe defense came to the rescue against Bradley. It delivered a stand at the Warhawks 6-yard line that resulted in a missed field-goal attempt, sacks on third down by Chima Ibezin and Daniel Rucker that ended drives and a breakup of a fourth-down pass by David Rucker with 1:13 remaining.\n“We’re prepared to play every game,” linebacker Colin Robertson said. “We trust in each other every single play. Everyone does his job. We never let down because we’re workers. We take a lot of pride in what we do. We think we’ve got the best defense in central Ohio.”\nWallace and Robertson stopped the ball carrier cold on third-and-goal for a 4-yard loss near the end of the third quarter, and Bradley missed a 27-yard field-goal attempt.\nOn third-and-4 at the Jaguars 48 in the fourth quarter, Ibezin sacked Chance Levitt for a 9-yard loss.\nOn the next possession, Daniel Rucker broke through the line to tackle Levitt for a 7-yard loss on third-and-9, dropping him at the Warhawks 38.\nFinally, David Rucker, playing cornerback, got a hand on the ball and ripped it away from receiver Derek Dunnagan on fourth-and-7 near midfield.\n“I played it 5 yards off the line because I knew it would be something short,” David Rucker said. “When he broke, I followed him. He caught the ball, but I ripped it out. Coach just told us to come up with a play.”\nKreuzer, a Wright State baseball recruit who was on Westerville Central’s state-tournament baseball team, was exceptional in the first half in leading two touchdown drives for a 14-0 lead. He completed passes of 10, 11, 16 and 9 yards on a 70-yard touchdown drive that ended with an 8-yard run by Snell with 9:21 left in the first quarter.\nThen Kreuzer threw over the middle to Wallace for a 78-yard touchdown with 1:50 left in the first half. Wallace stopped at the 30, cut back to the sideline and outran the defense to the pylon.\n“That was a perfect pass,” Wallace said. “Daniel and I go back to pee-wee football, and we have chemistry. We had been working on that play the entire week. Daniel put the ball right there. I stopped and cut because my sophomore year, I got tackled from behind. I didn’t want that to happen again.”\nmznidar@dispatch.com \n@MarkZnidar", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T14:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T04:21:07.007+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
