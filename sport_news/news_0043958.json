That was followed by Waynesville tossing up a Hail Mary on third-and-10 that was tipped by three different players before falling into the hands of a Waynesville receiver for a long touchdown. Those two plays ended up being the deciding factor as the Lakers lost 42-21. \n“It’s hard,” Shore said. “Because I feel like if you look at the stats, the last games we’ve run the ball real well and we’ve thrown the ball real well. Our percentages have been great and, man, we just come out and we were ready, we’ve got no excuses. The kids have practiced hard, they were ready mentally and physically and we just cannot seem to buy a break. Waynesville made some really good plays on us and we could not seem to come up with anything. You hate to say bad luck, but that’s what it looked like.” \nEven with this string of bad luck, the Lakers are standing tough. \nOffensively, they’re firing on all cylinders. Jay Griffin has blossomed into a star in the Lakers’ backfield with 744 yards and nine touchdowns. Dyllan Decker has improved every week as their quarterback. He threw for 194 yards against Waynesville and only threw four incompletions. He’s found a great target in Michael Terry, who added 146 yards last week. Tonight, they have an important matchup against Joplin. \n“Our record may not reflect it, but we are certainly in the mix for being a better football team and having a chance to win some games here and go on a little run,” said Shore. “(This game is a) big factor in how the point totals come out to who we’re gonna play in districts. If we can win the next two games, we might end up with that third seed, which would mean a home game in the first round of the playoffs.” \nJoplin is is 5-2 record and have put up huge wins in the last two weeks. Quarterback Colby Cornett has thrown for 1,622 yards and 13 touchdowns, while adding 476 yards and five scores on the ground. His top target is Zack Gaudette, who has 650 yards and four touchdowns. \nCamdenton struggled in the passing game last week, but Shore is looking forward to another chance to be tested. \n“I’m excited about that,” he said. “If we’re gonna be as good as we need to be, then we need to get tested in that area again and, quite frankly, it’s another good chance to get better.” \nCornett is going to be the main focus this week for the Lakers. He’s the main running threat for Joplin to go along with his ability to throw, so Camdenton will need to limit him as much as possible. \n“”He’s a factor. Watching him on film he can run it and he can throw it,” Shore said. “He’s got a lot of ability to evade the rush as well, so he’s definitely a dual threat guy and we’ll have to stop him to have a chance to really hold down their offense.” \nIf Camdenton can slow Cornett, its offense is playing well enough to get back to 4-4. Joplin is going to load the box against the run, but Decker’s continued improvement gives them a chance to move the football even if their running game is slowed down. But, at the end of the day, they’ll need to have some of those toss up plays go their way. \n“Just getting a play made,” Shore said. “Getting a big play, whether it be a pick off or a touchdown, unexpected though a trick play or something, just getting a play and having something go our way to get a little momentum.” \nCamdenton at Joplin - Updates on Twitter: @lkrathletics .
