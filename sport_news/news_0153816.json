The Spartans' confidence should be high today when they host the Northern Valley's other state power, No. 2 NV/Old Tappan.\nSenior hitter Maria Bellinger, the coach's daughter and reigning Record Player of the Year, led a third-set charge in which Paramus (7-0) opened a commanding 15-2 lead. Bellinger had nine of her match-high 18 kills in the finale.\nParamus' third set marked a significant turnaround from a second set in which NV/Demarest (6-2) led from start to finish with senior hitter Veronica Corcoran delivering eight of her 16 kills.\nAlthough Paramus and NV/Demarest are among New Jersey's top 10 teams, both suffered lapses of confidence in key moments. The Group 3 Spartans and Group 2 Norsewomen must overcome that to make deep runs in Bergen County and state tournaments.\n\"We were a little bit of a roller coaster emotionally, and it's really about the pressure situation. It's not about a skill set,\" coach MariaElena Bellinger said. \n\"We work real hard on this stuff in practice, and the breakdowns are not happening for physical reasons. They're happening because of mental pressure in big-game situations.\"\n\"We have things that we have been working on that are not physical that we need to fix,\" NV/Demarest coach Beth Powell said. \"And when you get in a game that like that, if you don't have all that fixed, things started to steamroll, and we've got to find a way to battle, and we didn't.\"\nNV/Demarest did an exceptional job in the first two sets to keep Bellinger from dominating. Norsewomen sophomore Ellen Hamlin had a match-high 16 digs, with most of them coming against Bellinger.\nParamus took command in the third set with a 13-0 run during which Bellinger had five kills and a block and senior middle Rianna McNamee served the last 11 points.\n\"At first if was definitely frustrating,\" Maria Bellinger said of the first two sets, \"but once everybody on the team picked up and we changed our mind-set and got our energy back, and we took the momentum back, I wasn't worried about it.\"\n\"It's kind of been Demarest, Old Tappan, [top-ranked] IHA; it's been more of a mental hurdle for us over these past few years than anything else,\" MariaElena Bellinger said. \"They're great programs, they're great teams, but so are we, and it's time for our team to realize that.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T04:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T10:33:24.124+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
