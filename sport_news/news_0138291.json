The 5-foot-11 cornerback will be in uniform and is expected to play on Saturday when the Tar Heels play host to Virginia. Hughes was suspended indefinitely, along with teammate M.J. Stewart, for an incident that happened at a fraternity house in Chapel Hill on Oct. 4. North Carolina coach Larry Fedora cited “a violation of team rules” as the reason for the suspension. Stewart was charged with a count of misdemeanor assault and battery. Hughes is charged with a count of misdemeanor assault inflicting serious injury and has a court date scheduled for Nov. 19. Hughes returned to practice Wednesday. “I have reinstated Mike Hughes today and he will play against Virginia this week,” Fedora told reporters. “M.J. Stewart will be reinstated on Sunday and he will play against Pitt the next week.” Fedora said he lifted the suspensions “based on everything I know at the time.” Both missed the Tar Heels’ 50-14 win over Wake Forest this past Saturday. Corner Hughes has played in five games this season and has three tackles and a pass breakup. Hughes was ranked the No. 3 corner back in North Carolina while at New Bern. He was named to the all-state team and played in the Shrine Bowl of the Carolinas. As a senior, he passed for 1,263 yards and 10 touchdowns and rushed for 1,355 yards with 22 touchdowns. Hughes guided New Bern High to an undefeated season and an NCHSAA 4A state championship in 2014.
