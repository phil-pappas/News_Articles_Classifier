A brilliant take from the restart by center Ciaran Hearn sparked an attack finished by left wing DTH Van Der Merwe for his third try of the tournament.\nTheir tails up, Canada attacked the French lines again and pouring forward, Aaron Carpenter picked up from the base of the ruck to score.\nHaving seen its 17-point advantage whittled down to five, France went back to the driving maul to pile over and restore some order with prop Rabah Slimani the man to emerge with the ball.\nCanada held their own for long spells after the break, adding to French frustrations with Nathan Hirayama’s two goals closing the deficit to six with 25 minutes left.\nMichalak nosed France further ahead again and it was French forward power that finally won the day with Pape scoring from the base of the ruck before good handling allowed Grosso to touch down in the corner.\nCanada dominated Italy for long spells before losing by five points on Saturday and coach Kieran Crowley said he was proud of another fine performance. — Reuters", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T04:32:53.684+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
