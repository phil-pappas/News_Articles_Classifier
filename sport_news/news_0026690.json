The Pats knew this was a realistic possibility all week, but Hightower was at least able to get through three practices on a limited basis.\nThe feeling here is the Patriots want to preserve Hightower for a crucial upcoming stretch against AFC East opponents. Though it's too early to know right now if Hightower will be ready next week, the Pats host the Jets and Dolphins in a five-day span, and the Jets boast an especially physical running game.\nHightower, who is the play-caller in the huddle and has been credited by teammates as the brain of the middle of the defense, has 2.5 sacks and one pressure this season, and quarterbacks are 3 of 6 for 28 yards when targeting him.\nHightower played through a torn shoulder labrum for the final two months of the 2014 season and made the Patriots' final tackle of Super Bowl XLIX before Malcolm Butler's clinching interception, so his proven track record of toughness yielded optimism that he might play through the current injury.\nFor now, the Patriots and Hightower preferred to be cautious.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T01:33:05.502+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
