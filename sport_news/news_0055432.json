It wasn't Matt's best year. It wasn't my best year. As an organization, it wasn't our best year. All of us, together, feel the disappointment.\"\nWilliams is gone after only two seasons in his first job as a skipper in the majors. Last year, he was voted NL Manager of the Year after the Nationals finished with the best record in the league. In February, the Nationals exercised his 2016 contract option.\nBut he presided over a 2015 season filled with defeats, discord and the embarrassing spectacle of a dugout dustup between NL MVP front-runner Bryce Harper and teammate Jonathan Papelbon during a game the day after the team was eliminated from playoff contention.\nWilliams said he had no idea of the extent of the skirmish until much later in the day. Even though he was, of course, in the dugout at the time, Williams said he hadn't been aware of exactly what happened — including that Papelbon grabbed Harper by the throat. None of his players or coaches told him about it right away, and he said he hadn't asked to know more.\n\"Not one single incident was the tipping point of making a decision with Matt Williams,\" Rizzo said. \"Like I said during the season, (we were) going to take his whole body of work into consideration.\"\nThe Nationals also said Monday they will not renew the contracts of the seven members of Williams' staff: bench coach Randy Knorr, pitching coach Steve McCatty, hitting coach Rick Schu, third base coach Bobby Henley, first base coach Tony Tarasco, bullpen coach Matt LeCroy, and defensive coordinator Mark Weidemaier.\nKnorr, who was a candidate for manager when Williams was hired, could be considered for that post again, Rizzo said.\nBefore Sunday's season finale against the Mets, Rizzo said the Nationals were \"not going to let people twist in the wind\" — and, true to his word, the house-cleaning began quickly. He said he met with Williams in the Nationals Park manager's office Monday morning to deliver the news.\nRizzo said the hiring process would begin Monday afternoon.\n\"We're going to bring in a group of people with diverse backgrounds, diverse experiences and diverse skill sets. And I think that's something we did not do last time. Last time we brought in managing candidates with little or no managerial experience,\" Rizzo said.\nBefore the season began, no one was shy about predicting big things for Washington — not even the Nationals themselves. But the team fell apart in the second half.\nWilliams' string of open-to-second-guessing bullpen choices didn't begin in 2015 — they were front-and-center during Washington's NL Division Series loss last season. He also tried to deal with a long list of injuries, including to half of the everyday lineup for long stretches: Jayson Werth, Ryan Zimmerman, Anthony Rendon and Denard Span. The ideal lineup was available for only two games all season.\n\"We had some things that went sideways and we had a whole bunch of injuries, and not much you can do about that except adjust and move on,\" Williams said Sunday.\nHis departure begins an offseason of significant change for a team that won division titles in 2012 and 2014 but could not win a playoff series.\nAt least 20 percent of the roster is pretty much guaranteed to be gone. Two homegrown building blocks, right-hander Jordan Zimmermann and shortstop Ian Desmond, are expected to leave via free agency, along with leadoff hitter Span and right-hander Doug Fister. Drew Storen is expected to be traded after losing the closer's job to Papelbon, then faltering badly.\n\"It's got a chance to be drastically different next year,\" Werth said, \"so that's tough.\"\n___\nFollow Howard Fendrich on Twitter at http://twitter.com/HowardFendrich\n2 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Copyright 2015 The Associated Press.
