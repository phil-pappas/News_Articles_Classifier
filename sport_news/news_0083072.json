So it’s understandable that fans would go to the game even though it’s at the same time as Game 1 of the NLCS for the Cubs.\nFortunately, the Cubs and Blackhawks have a fun little relationship. During intermissions, the Blackhawks are playing the Cubs game on their video board.\nIntermission is as entertaining as the live game. pic.twitter.com/e3aQkj2ecA\n— Mark Lazerus (@MarkLazerus) October 18, 2015\nThis isn’t the first time the Blackhawks were more than willing to help fans enjoy both games. During the season opener they played the Cubs Wild Card game.\nThe Blackhawks are returning the favor after the Cubs did pretty much the same thing during their Stanley Cup run. During a rain delayed Cubs game, the Blackhawks game was played live on the video board.\nFans who chose to go to the United Center may have made the right choice. While the Blackhawks have taken a 2-0 lead over Columbus, the Cubs have fallen behind 4-1 in the seventh inning against the Mets.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/MarkLazerus/status/655568730957549568", "http://t.co/e3aQkj2ecA"], "published": "2015-10-18T05:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T05:48:57.722+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
