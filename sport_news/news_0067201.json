Nothing will change this weekend. \n\"It's a different ball-game when you are playing South Africa in a World Cup play-off game. It means so much more. It's a huge challenge.\" \nCarter, meanwhile, has hailed his fellow All Blacks superstar Richie McCaw as \"a legend of the game\" ahead of McCaw reaching another career landmark. \nMcCaw will captain New Zealand for a World Cup record 12th time in Saturday's game. \nEarlier this year, McCaw became the most-capped player in rugby union history, with the Springboks clash set to be his 147th Test. He has also skippered the All Blacks on more than 100 occasions. \nAnd Carter, who will quit international rugby after the World Cup to join wealthy French club Racing 92, believes McCaw is one of a kind. \n\"He leads the team fantastically well. He is an inspiration, a player that really motivates this side because of his actions,\" Carter added. \n\"You see him at training. He is first out, and last to leave. His work ethic is fantastic. \n\"Out on the field, he is the first guy to put his body on the line, and when you are working so closely with him, it inspires you to do the same. \n\"To have such longevity in this demanding game goes to show his professionalism, his drive and desire to play at this level. I feel honoured to play alongside this legend of the game.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T06:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T20:14:25.926+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
