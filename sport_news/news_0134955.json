Center Mitch Smothers is 6-3, 322; left and right guards guards Sebastian Tretola, 6-5, 334 and Frank Ragnow, 6-5, 312; and left and right tackles Denver Kirkland, 6-5, 340, and Dan Skipper, 6-10, 331. \nOn the defensive front, few come any bigger than Alabama ends A’Shawn Robinson, 6-4, 312, and Jarran Reed, 6-4, 313, and nose guard Darren Lake, 6-3, 315. \nClint Stoerner said the Alabama offense vs. Arkansas defense battle could wield the biggest influence of all. \nA 4-year Arkansas letterman and 3-year starting quarterback 1997-99, Stoerner has joined the SEC Network as an analyst. So he had seen a lot of film on coach Bret Bielema’s Razorbacks and coach Nick Sabam’s 16-point favorite Crimson Tide before addressing the Northwest Arkansas Touchdown Wednesday at Mermaid’s Restaurant. \n“It’s going to be Arkansas’ defense,” Stoerner said of the unit whose success or failure is apt most to determine the game’s outcome. “I have yet to see that front really be an impact in a game. They have done a good job statistically but you are fixing to face a downhill running game with a back (Alabama’s Derrick Henry) 6-3, 230 or whatever (actually listed 242). That’s going to be a whole different. The key to me is Arkansas’ front seven vs. this running game.” \nAlabama quarterback Jake Coker, 79 of 139 for 976 yards and nine touchdowns vs four interceptions, isn’t throwing it as well as Arkansas quarterback Brandon Allen, 93 for 141 and 1,360 yards and eight touchdown passes against three interceptions, but Coker has better receivers to throw to and is afforded better protection by the Alabama line than the Vols that Arkansas defeated last week in Knoxville. \nAnd with the exception of a 43-37 loss to Ole Miss, Alabama’s offense dug much of the Tide’s problems that game committing five turnovers, Coker is complemented by one the annually best defenses in college football. Alabama’s front seven savaged then No. 8 Georgia, 38-10 last Saturday in Athens, Ga. and stopped Arkansas’ running game the last three years while beating the Hogs, 52-0, 52-0 and 14-13. \nThat 14-13 score does show Arkansas caught up considerably to Alabama last year. \nAnd Allen’s vast passing improvement, even minus out for the season injured receivers Keon Hatcher, Jared Cornelius and Cody Hollister but with Drew Morgan, 155 and 110 receiving yards the past two games, complements the Razorbacks reestablishing their running game the past three games. \nArkansas junior tailback Alex Collins has exceed 150 yards rushing each of his last three games and freshman running back Rawleigh Williams netted 100 against Tennessee. “I don’t know that he’s going to go for that,” Stoerner said of Collins running 150 plus on Alabama. “But I don’t know that you need that. I think they can run it effectively.” \nLast year’s dominating defenses made it virtually a running game standoff when Alabama edged Arkansas by one point in Fayetteville. \nBielema said, “It’s a tremendous task, but a good opportunity to find out where we are at. I think our kids are excited to get over there and see what we can do.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T06:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T08:10:40.560+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
