Yet, it was a letter written in English that changed their mind about their son playing football. Makarov is a junior for Rocky Bayou’s football team. That, though, is not how most think of the outside linebacker, running back and wide receiver. He is from Kazakhstan, a country south of Russia and east of the Ukraine. His family is Russian. His parents speak Russian. The family of 10 moved to the United States six years ago. He even has the nickname of “The Russian” among his teammates. When Makarov’s parents said “no more” to football before the 2015 season – their belief it was too dangerous – it was a crushing blow. It hurt his teammates just as much. “We did it because he was a true brother and a big spiritual leader for our team,” said senior lineman Ian Hall, who was part of the group that penned the letter. “We also knew he loved the game and wanted him to be able to play again.” So they decided to do something. “I forget however many of our seniors – and some of our juniors – wrote hand-written letters to his parents,” Rocky Bayou coach Josh Childers said. “They don’t speak English. Mark didn’t know about it. So one of his older brothers translated it from English to Russian and his parents broke down in tears.” The words had enough of an impact to change the parents’ minds, something Makarov believes wouldn’t have happened without the letter. This continued the incredible journey from the streets of Kazakhstan to the structure of football. “They were so against it,” he said. “They didn’t want me getting injured for the rest of my life.” If you know Makarov, you know a soft-spoken, humble kid with deep roots in his Christian faith. His father is a pastor for the Ark of Salvations Ministries Incorporated, which has a mostly Russian congregation. However, Makarov “didn’t have a good childhood.” The youngest of four brothers and second youngest of seven siblings, Makarov would serve as a lookout while older kids from his home town, Kaskelen, drank alcohol or smoked cigarettes. “Because we were so much on the streets,” Makarov said, “we didn’t have a TV and we’d get into the wrong stuff. “I was the checker. I was too small to do any of it.” While that one was surely something Makarov needed correcting, the battle to play football was something he sincerely wanted to win. Page 2 of 2 - Makarov finally got the chance in eighth grade. With zero experience playing this American-centric game, he possessed certain gifts that nudged him toward success. He is a 6-foot-2 kid weighing only 185 pounds, but without an inch of body fat. With only around 200 all-purpose yards and close to 20 tackles, Makarov doesn’t rise to the top of stat sheets. Childers, though, considers him “the best open-field tackler” he’s ever seen, from playing days and coaching ones. “Watching him from the time he was an eighth-grader on our middle school team,” Childers said, “he didn’t know what to do but he saw someone with the ball and would go after them and wreck the guy. “He’s a very compact person. His shoulders are tight. He is a strong kid in the weight room. He is a perfectionist. You see guys cheating on the bench press or clean and jerk. He is a by-the-book guy.” If you see Makarov playing Friday in a big North Florida Football Conference showdown with Munroe, you’ll watch a physically gifted athlete with an interesting past. And you’ll see him running, blocking and tackling alongside his teammates, the same ones who refused to let him be taken from the sport he now enjoys.
