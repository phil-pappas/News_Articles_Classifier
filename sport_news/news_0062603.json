Hingle-USA TODAY Sports) CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nNEW ORLEANS -- Drew Brees showed he can still look like the quarterback New Orleans fans came to know and love. \nDuring an early touchdown drive, he hit his receivers in stride on short passes and threw the ball downfield, exposing holes in the Dallas secondary. He sidestepped a pass rusher before firing a strike over the middle to Benjamin Watson for 21 yards and sold a fake handoff before flipping a simple three-yard pass to Josh Hill in the end zone. \nBrees appeared to cap off his performance by setting up what should have been an easy game-winning kick for Zack Hocker. When that didn’t work, Brees finished off a much-needed 26-20 victory himself by hitting C.J. Spiller in stride down the right sideline for an 80-yard touchdown. \n“I looked up at the jumbotron to make sure there was nobody coming,” Spiller said. \nIt could be just the spark New Orleans had been looking for through its first three losses, when the Saints failed to reach 20 points twice with Brees and couldn’t keep up with Carolina despite an impressive 310-yard day for Luke McCown. Inconsistency and two turnovers per game kept the offense from finding much of a rhythm. \nThose problems didn’t go away entirely Sunday night, although New Orleans narrowly managed to avoid giving the ball away. Twice Cowboys defenders dropped easy interceptions, and a few fans at the Superdome could be heard booing after a three and out early in the third quarter. \nThose boos quickly turned to cheers after the Cowboys put 12 men on the field for a punt return, allowing Hocker to kick a game-tying 51-yard field goal. Brees responded well and finished with 279 yards, despite three sacks and heavy pressure for much of the first half. \n“I’m sure when he looks at the film there’ll be some throws that he looks at and he’s frustrated with,” Payton said. “I thought early on he got hit a little bit too much for my liking and it was important that there was some balance in the running game.” \nFixing those problems enabled the Saints to overcome a 10-7 halftime deficit thanks to a mixture of short passes and productive running. Ingram stepped up at the end of a go-ahead touchdown drive in the fourth quarter by breaking loose for 15 yards before a nine-yard run into the end zone on the following play. \nWillie Snead showed his value as a possession receiver with six plays for 89 yards, including two third-down conversions. But the Saints continue searching for the type of explosive receivers that have propelled the offense in the past, although they believe Spiller could grow into the role. \nThe challenges will be tougher during a tricky four week stretch, starting next week at Philadelphia. Undefeated Atlanta awaits the following week before a trip to Indianapolis and a visit from the New York Giants, both of whom are 2-2.
