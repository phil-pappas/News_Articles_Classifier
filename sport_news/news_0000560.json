A deflection off the hands of well-covered receiver Josh Doctson ... no biggee. A carom grabbed by running back Aaron Green as he deftly tip his toes to make sure he did not gloss over the back of the end zone ... no biggee. \nThis is the Big 12. And this is how football is played. Teams score. By any means possible. \nThe laterals Texas Tech used for a 40-yard gain on the final play against TCU, after time had expired, actually one-upped the improbable touchdown grab by Green. The sandlot slicker left the Red Raiders just 10 yards short of paydirt and capped a 1,357 yards worth of combined offense. \nGary Patterson wondered just how a play like that can be practiced. \nYet in virtually the same breath, the TCU coach affirmed he understands the practice of playing football in the Big 12. \n“Been here (at TCU) 18 years, outscoring people for 12 ballgames. Why not? Everybody else has been doing it,” said Patterson, who has long taken pride in fielding stout defenses. \n“I’ve been having to do it with defense and winning 17-10. How about we go nine and ten ballgames and outscore people. That would be nice. You guys kill me. If I win 17-10 I have no offense. Now I win 55-52 and you’re going to say we’re going to have to ride (Josh) Doctson and Trevone (Boykin).’’ \nSure looks that way ... as hard as it might be on the baby aspirin Patterson takes for his ticker. \nEveryone, including me, expects TCU to fade from contention in both the Big 12 and College Football Playoff, because of the injuries that have decimated its defense. \nYet the Frogs may just have enough firepower to outscore the rest of the league. \nOffense continues to make the Big 12 spin heads. A couple of weeks ago, Bill Snyder was asked about his team’s defensive prowess. The Kansas State coach expressed satisfaction, but noted it would not be long before the Wildcats faced opponents “that come at you at the speed of light.’’ \nSnyder has never marched to the Big 12 drummer. He attempts, patiently, to defuse high-powered attacks. \nHe must do so again this year, hoping that inexperienced playmakers on offense can do enough to consistently move the chains and consume time, making extended possessions a part of K-State’s defensive strategy. \nThe approach is an anomaly. Most coaches in the league, including David Beaty in his first year at Kansas, have adopted the snap it-and-bust it mentality. \nTo build such attacks, typical recruiting quotas are discarded and more receivers added to the mix. The running back position, contrary to some opinion, is not neglected either. \nReductions, instead, are often made in defensive personnel, leaving coordinators on that side of the ball shorthanded. That makes it hard to man positions with the talent and depth needed to stop high-powered attacks. \nThat’s one reason Beaty smartly addressed the need for KU to build its walk-on program. It is why Snyder has fortified numbers by stockpiling walk-ons for years. \nIn spite of all the desire walk-ons possess and all the instruction coaches provide, the fights they wage in the Big 12 are not always fair. \nIn the case of KU, Beaty’s attempt to build depth with walk-ons will take time and cannot yet be evaluated. \nIn the case of K-State, this appears one of those seasons where the Cats are building for the future, yet doing so with walk-ons (past and present) at key spots. Their leading passer, Joe Hubener, leading rusher, Justin Silmon, and leading receiver, Kody Cook, all joined the program without scholarships. \nTrevone Boykin, the TCU quarterback who was a previous candidate for the Heisman Trophy, did not walk on. Seth Russell, the Baylor quarterback who stepped in this year to drive that pre-assembled dragster, did not walk on. Samaje Perine, the Oklahoma running back who broke the FBS single-game rushing record last year, did not walk on. \nAll are part of swift offenses that validate the national perception that no defense is played in the Big 12. \nIn the end, however, someone will win the title with a defensive unit that gains some acclaim at the end of the season. No one, however, seems too quick to copy Snyder’s approach and make games more manageable by milking clock. \nIt’s a good strategy, though. And if enough strides are made with the offense this season, K-State may be in position to contend again in the Big 12 next year. \nDoing things a bit differently. \nKevin Haskin can be reached at (785) 295-1159 or kevin.haskin@cjonline.com .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T21:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T21:14:57.977+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
