After a delay of 2 minutes, 32 seconds, the play stood and fans continued to throw objects on the field.\nToronto Mayor John Tory tweeted, \"Don't hurt each other or our city over this. We can prove ourselves in more ways than one. #ComeTogether\"\nThings devolved further in the bottom half as the Rangers made three errors to load the bases with none out.\nTexas then requested a review on next play, when Ben Revere grounded into a force at home. Dalton Pompey slid hard into catch Chris Gimemez, who was standing on home plate. Umpires upheld the ruling.\nBut after Sam Dyson replaced Cole Hamels, Josh Donaldson drove in a run on a forceout and Jose Bautista hit a long homer to put Toronto up 6-3.\nWhen on-deck batter Edwin Encarcion turned to the crowd and gestured for them to stop throwing objects on field, Dyson misunderstood Encarnacion's actions and the players had words, causing the benches to clear.\nTwenty police officers lined the outfield and many more were stationed down the lines during the delay.\nBenches cleared a second time after Troy Tulowitzki popped out foul to end the inning.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
