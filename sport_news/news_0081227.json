Cox, 25, is expected to play Saturday against Baylor. The Capital-Journal \nLAWRENCE — For Kansas senior running back Taylor Cox, the time has finally come. \nThis Saturday, it will be two years and 26 days since Cox last suited up and took the field at Memorial Stadium. Cox’s last two seasons ended early due to injury. \nIn 2013, Cox played in the first two games before suffering a season-ending injury. In 2014, Cox saw his season cut short once again when he tore his Achilles in a non-contact drill during fall camp. \nFast forward to Week 5 of the 2015 season, and it is finally time for the 25-year-old to make his return. \n“We’re excited about the old man getting back out there,” offensive coordinator Rob Likens said. “I always joke with him saying I played against him in high school.” \nKU coach David Beaty said Cox will provide more than just his physical talents on the field, praising Cox for his leadership from the sideline as well. \nThe 2015 season is Cox’s sixth year of college football and his fourth at KU. While he hasn’t played in more than two years, he knows the system as well as anyone on the team. \n“I think Taylor’s like 30 years old, so he brings a different maturity about him,” defensive coordinator Clint Bowen said jokingly. “The kids look up and respect him, knowing he’s been through a lot and has worked hard to get back.” \nAfter getting off to a hot start on the ground in the first two games, KU has failed to reach 65 yards rushing as a team in its last two contests. \nIn 2012, Cox’s only full season at KU, he rushed for 464 yards on 91 carries for 5.1 yards per carry. Cox is ready and eager to get back and help the team in any way he can. \n“I think (Cox) just cherishes one play at a time,” Beaty said. “I was watching him (Monday) ... we were running him down on kickoff a bit, he was breathing heavy, and I was like, ‘Man you’re not used to doing this,’ and he said, ‘No coach, but you can run me 50 times. I’m ready to do this.’” \nKU has had a number of running backs in the last few seasons, but none have meant as much to the program recently as Cox. Bowen said it means a lot to the players and the program to see him fight back and get healthy the way he has. He said his return will give the team a much needed boost of morale. \nJunior quarterback T.J. Millweard said the team has missed Cox on the field. “You can’t replace a guy like that.” Millweard said, adding that Cox’s leadership on the field is unmatched. \n“He’ll make a bigger impact than people see on the surface,” Beaty said. “He’s a guy that those guys respect. We’re going to continue to need that as we grow forward.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T00:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T02:35:20.789+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
