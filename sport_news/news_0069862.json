And the way that the Sharks played in Wednesday's season-opening 5-1 romp over the Los Angeles Kings at Staples Center ... well, it certainly raised expectations. The aggressive system of new head coach Pete DeBoer was evidenced all over the ice. It is the way he wants to play every game. It was the way the Sharks came out of the gate Saturday night in a swift-paced first period against Anaheim. It probably is a very fun way to play. \n\"It means going after pucks quickly instead of waiting and reacting,\" confirmed Ward before Saturday's faceoff. \n\"One guy initiates that, and then the rest pick it up,\" said third-line forward Tommy Wingels. \"You want to play fast.\" \nBut the system is not without risks. \nPressuring the puck can lead to overcommitting, which can lead to a puck being sprung free to an opponent and creating an odd-man rush the other way. Pressuring the puck can sometimes lead to more assertive hard hits, leading to more penalties. \nThe first issue can be handled with good goalie play to stymie the odd-man rushes. The second issue can be overcome by an excellent penalty kill. \nThe most critical risk about constant aggressive pressure, however, shows up long term over the course of a game and a season. Being aggressive for 60 minutes can mean more tired legs in the third period and worn-down players in the season's second half -- and even more so for players who log heavy minutes. \n\"You can't play pressure hockey unless you have depth,\" DeBoer said after Saturday morning's warm-up skate, speaking about the necessity of thrusting more minutes on the third and fourth lines. \n\"We're going to have to continue to manage that as the season gets tougher,\" DeBoer said. \nThe penalty kill also must stay solid. It was among the bottom one-third in the league last season but so far looks much improved. \n\"No matter what system you're playing, your team is going to look good when you do that,'' said veteran Sharks defenseman Marc-Edouard Vlasic. \nSharks fans are pretty amazing folks. Despite all the disappointments, they filled the building again Saturday. As the team lined up along the blue line for pregame ceremonies, the crowd cheered every player as he was introduced. \nThere was not one discouraging shout for Patrick Marleau, who had a substandard 2014-15 season. Doug Wilson, the general manager and the franchise's first captain in 1991-92, has taken a ton of heat from the Sharks proletariat for his recent decisions and deals. But there were no boos for Wilson's picture when it flashed on the scoreboard television screen as part of a pastiche showcasing former Shark players. \nOctober is wonderful that way. Could this be the year? As always, it is until it isn't. And for now, it still is.
