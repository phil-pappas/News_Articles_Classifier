I knew I didn't have it.\" \nAn MRI exam could not determine the extent of the injury, which is why Alonso went to surgeon James Andrews for further evaluation. That's why he had arthroscopic knee surgery. \n\"They went in there and cleaned it out,\" Alonso said. \". . . Like when you take a car for a cleaning.\" \nAlonso said he was hurt while he was running on his third-to-last play against Dallas. He remained in the game for two more plays before he told the medical staff his knee bothered him. The training staff took him out of the game. \nAlonso, who missed all of last season with a torn ACL and had tendinitis during the summer, said he does not know if the injury will linger. \n\"Hope not,\" he said.

The only players to miss practice were Alonso, linebacker Mychal Kendricks, and defensive end Brandon Bair.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T16:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T16:31:46.692+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
