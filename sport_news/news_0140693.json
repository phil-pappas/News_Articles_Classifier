I don't know nothing about that,\" Dansby said of the report. \"If it's anonymous, tell it. Who are they? If it's so anonymous, if somebody said that, if they're able to tell him, they should be able to tell the coaches and try to make adjustments if that's how they feel. \n\"We playing ball. That's all I know. Like I said, this is brand new to me. I didn't know nothing about it. I didn't know the story came out, but that's crazy. I came in with the defense. That was never a concern.\" \nAlthough Dansby has been in the NFL for more than a decade, he believes younger players should not have a problem adjusting to the Browns' defense. \n\"They've been doing it all their life. You know what I'm saying?\" Dansby said. \"You get to this level, it's like you've got a PhD in what you're doing, so you've got to be on top of your game. You're always being evaluated, year in or year out, so it ain't about what you did last year, it's about what you're going to do this year. \n\"This is your job, man. This is what you do all day, every day, so you've got to apply it. You've got to apply all the information. Like they say, 'Knowledge is power,' right? This information, man, you've got to soak it up and be able to apply it on the field.\" \nBrowns coach Mike Pettine added, \"We've been running these calls not just here in Cleveland but other places. A lot of the stuff we're doing is Day One install. I think guys start to press and search for answers, and if that gets into their head, and they feel like they're thinking too much, we try to de-clutter, defensively. \n\"You simplify it. You break it down to win your one-on-one match up. When in doubt, whip the guys' tail across from you. Then, we'll find a way to make it right behind you. We don't teach defense like a golf swing -- put your thumb here, put the ball located here and you want to get the club. That's not how we coach it.\" \nDespite what the statistics show, Dansby believes he and his teammates are making plays \"all over the field,\" and that the scheme has a proven track record of success, or teams like the Kansas City Chiefs, Buffalo Bills and New York Jets would not be utilizing a system similar to that of the Browns. \n\"We just gotta stay solid, continue to work together, continue to work hard,\" Dansby said. \"This is the ultimate team sport. It takes everybody. Everybody has to be on the same page at the same time in order for us to stop the run, and that's just what we've got to do. \n\"We've just got to be more sound. We've just got to work on techniques, continue to press. We can't stop doing what we're doing. We've got to continue to try to press forward and make plays, gotta be opportunistic. You might get an opportunity to get there, you gotta get there. You can beat the one-on-one, you gotta win. The quarterback getting it out of his hand fast, if he holds onto it one more second, little bit tighter coverage, you might get that sack. It's a game of inches, man. \n\"(We've) gotta find a way to win, gotta find a way to make that one play, to either change the momentum or continue to have success on different plays, play in and play out. It's just part of it, part of the process.\" 2 CONNECT 1 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://on.wkyc.com/1LUtFn1 TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T20:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T20:57:33.493+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
