On a night when the soccer Spartans were short-handed, goalkeeper Isaiah Killinger made two remarkable stops late while Alex Redding stepped up and netted both goals Monday as the duo helped deliver Moberly a 2-1 overtime victory against Warrensburg at home. While this 2015 campaign has had more than its fair share of player injuries, causing most of the jayvee games be cancelled due to the Spartans having a lack of available players, Moberly boys’ soccer coach Chris Buckman said the low body count was a result of some of his players choosing to violate team rules and were disciplined by becoming spectators on this occasion. “Warrensburg played very physical. I applaud their effort. They had a lot of fight in them, and did a good job keeping pressure on us,” said Moberly coach Buckman. “We began the game playing a little sluggish. Maybe us not having school today had something to do with it because they did not seem focused.” Tuesday evening, the Spartans (5-11) travelled to play at conference rival Mexico (11-7), and come Thursday Moberly will celebrate Senior Night with Fulton being the opponent. With 3:55 remaining in regulation Monday, Warrensburg’s Ben Sachs was about 8-yards in front of the goal line when he struck the ball hard, sending a bullet into the chest of Spartans sophomore goalkeeper Killinger as he made his diving stop. The ball trickled out of his hands and was gently rolling toward the end line when Killinger had the insight to belly-flop himself forward to smother the ball just a fraction before it crossed the goal line for a Tigers score. Killinger’s second effort kept the game tied at 1-1, giving the Spartans an opportunity to pull out a win. However, Killinger made another remarkable stop in overtime that gave his Moberly squad a second chance. Warrensburg and the Spartans were fighting for control of the ball for some time about 5 yards in front of Killinger when a Tigers’ player unleashed a hard shot within the frame that was deflected by Killinger as he dove to the ground. As quickly as Killinger fell, the 6-foot-1 Spartan rose to his feet even faster to stop a rebound header that ended up stopping in front of Killinger’s nose when he grabbed the ball with both hands. Four minutes later when there was 3:02 remaining, Redding sent Moberly fans home happy and kept his teammates from running sprints later in the evening. The game-wining goal in overtime was set up when senior co-captain Drinnen Holloway played the ball to Redding about halfway in the middle of the 18m box, and he quickly flicked it his right finding Alex Hull. With Hull not having a shot opportunity, the sophomore midfielder made a wise decision and returned the gift. Page 2 of 2 - “One of their players moved to Alex so he rolled the ball back to me. I took the ball, dribbled it up about three or four yards when I saw a guy coming across and I cut it to an open spot where I placed my shot toward the left area of the goal for the score,” said Redding. “The ball went right through the keeper’s hands. “Once I saw the ball hit the net I was thinking oh my gosh we just won the game so I started running around to celebrate.” Warrensburg (5-9) pressured the Spartans early and often during the first half of play. The Tigers were first to score when Mason Janvrin broke free on a run and found an open spot between the posts to score just three minutes into the contest. “The challenges we faced was that they had players who could run pretty fast and they took advantage of their speed early to score on us,” said Redding. “We made an adjustment later and were able to get players back to assist and defend better the rest of the game.” “Towards the end we did a better job of getting together to make an offensive strike, and setting up to take a better shot.” During the 14th minute, Redding put Moberly on the scoreboard with his first goal of the night, tying the game, and Thomas Hall is credited with the assist. Coach Buckman said his Spartans seemingly played with more fervor and energy from the last six minutes of regulation and through overtime. Passes across midfield were much sharper and Moberly maintained better ball possession and took more shots. “I wasn’t too pleased. They knew if the game was not on the line then they were going to be after the game was over,” coach Buckman said. “I was expecting Warrensburg to put up a good fight, but coming into this game I also thought this was a game was one within our grasp and one that we should win.” By Chuck Embree", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T21:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T03:15:44.777+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
