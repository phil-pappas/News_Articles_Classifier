Just look at where all the key plays came from.”\nJunior quarterback Keeshawn Ramsey, making his second start in place of injured Josh Jones, plunged over right guard from a yard on third-and-goal with 4:16 left to break a seemingly endless tie.\n“The line was getting pretty good penetration as the game went along and that seemed like the best way to get it in,” Ramsey said. “We got just enough push to help me get across.”\nMiranda praised the effort of Ramsey, who also threw a 12-yard touchdown pass to Malik Crockett on a rollout play late in the first quarter.\n“He showed a lot of athleticism and kept a lot of plays alive for us,” he said. “For just his second start, he did a tremendous job.”\nIgniting the seven-play, 80-yard drive was a 49-yard run down the sideline by freshman running back Savon Edwards Jr., whose father starred for the Warriors in the 1990s and now is an assistant coach.\n“Savon offers a change of pace running style that might have caught them off guard,” Miranda said. “That was just a huge play in terms of field position and momentum. It had been pretty much a stalemate up to that point.”\nBoth teams seemed mired in third-and-long situations, and the defenses took advantage.\n“Yardage was tough to come by, but we just had to keep grinding away and stay focused,” Edwards said. “I had a really good block on that run. I should have scored, but I’m glad we were able to punch it in and come away with the win. This was a game we really needed for the City and for our playoff hopes.”\nThe snap on the extra-point attempt was botched, but 250-pound kicker Quincy Colvin — hobbling on an injured knee — had the presence of mind to pick up the ball and steamroll up the middle for the two-point conversion.\nEastmoor (5-3, 4-1) needed a defensive stop in the waning moments to post its ninth straight win and 11th in 12 games against Independence (6-2, 4-1).\nAided by a 33-yard pickup by running back Ronnie Kuipers and two fourth-down conversions, the 76ers drove deep into Eastmoor territory.\nOn the latter, Jeremiah Jackson converted a halfback pass of 12 yards on fourth-and-8 to the 7-yard line. But on the final play, quarterback De’Zhan Townsend flipped a quick sideline pass to Kaa’Von Parker that was stopped for 2 yards, and the clock expired before the 76ers could get back to the line.\n“They tried really hard to spread things out on us, but fortunately we held on that end,” Ramsey said.\nKuipers, who entered with 1,348 yards and a 10.2-yard average, was limited to 132 yards on 13 carries. Much of it came after halftime when both teams’ defenses were visibly gassed.\nTownsend scored Independence’s only TD on a 2-yard run early in the second quarter.\n“You’ve got to prepare for their concept and that’s a challenge in itself,” Miranda said. “They get up to the line quickly with unbalanced sets, a lot of misdirection and different personnel handling the ball, and they do it well. Hats off to my defense for holding them at the end and for not letting Kuipers break a big one.”\nsblackledge@dispatch.com \n@BlackiePreps", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T02:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T06:55:15.450+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
