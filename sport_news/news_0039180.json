Hawk Harrelson will only call 78 road games, opening day and 2 Cubs games at US Cell next year.\n— Spiegel & Goff (@SpiegelAndGoff) October 5, 2015\nThe change was attributed to Harrelson’s desire to stop commuting to Chicago from his home in South Bend, IN. for every game. The three games Harrelson will still broadcast from Chicago will likely be three of the most watched home games of the season.\nThere were no details given on what Harrelson’s role would be if the White Sox were to reach the playoffs.\nSunday night’s White Sox game concluded the 31st season Harrelson has broadcasted for the team. Throughout his time in Chicago, Harrelson has been recognized both locally and nationally for his work.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/MLBBruceLevine", "https://twitter.com/SpiegelAndGoff/status/651071458555396096"], "published": "2015-10-05T19:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T23:00:12.072+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
