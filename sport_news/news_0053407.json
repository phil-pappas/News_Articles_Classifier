This piece was pursued and executed independent of that business relationship. Sports Illustrated also has a partnership with DailyMVP, another daily fantasy sports provider.\nIt was only a few weeks ago when the daily fantasy sports industry was flying high. Through an aggressive—if not excessive—advertising campaign, DraftKings and FanDuel had become almost fixtures of NFL television broadcasts. These two companies had also negotiated strategic partnerships with major pro sports leagues and global media companies that gave powerful interests a stake in DFS’s continued success. The law, it seemed, also worked in the favor of DraftKings and FanDuel: the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act of 2006 (UIGEA) exempted fantasy sports from a federal ban on Internet gambling so long as the fantasy games required skill and knowledge rather than luck. To be sure, DFS was not marketable in 2006—and thus DFS was likely not contemplated by Congress and President George W. Bush when they considered UIGEA legislation. Also, a handful of states have since restricted DFS games, which is permissible under the UIGEA. Still, as of a few weeks ago, the law mostly painted a favorable landscape for DraftKings and FanDuel to thrive.\n• Report: FBI, Justice Department investigating daily fantasy sports\nTimes sometimes change fast. In the case of DFS, times seem to be changing at warp speed. In a stunning sequence of events, allegations that a DraftKings employee, Ethan Haskell, used information unavailable to other DFS participants to turn a $25 entry fee on FanDuel into a $350,000 prize have spawned a fast-moving reconsideration of whether DFS constitutes illegal gambling. This reconsideration is playing out in multiple legal forums, each of which poses different risks for DraftKings, FanDuel and the future of the DFS industry.\nRisk of criminal law exposure\nBy far, the most troubling legal worry for those who work at DraftKings and FanDuel is the possibility that they could be charged with crimes. While various civil challenges might be brought that threaten DFS companies and their employees with monetary damages and business disruption, there is nothing more threatening than the risk of incarceration.\nNFL What a federal grand jury could mean for daily fantasy sports companies by Michael McCann", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/McCannSportsLaw"], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T01:23:01.075+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
