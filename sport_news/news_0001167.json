They also clinched their third straight conference championship. So what if they were dismantled by Rockford Lutheran and new Illinois rushing king James Robinson in Week 1? This is a much-improved team that has good reason to be proud of a flawless conference record. Plus, don’t look for a letdown in Week 9. They’ll face crosstown rival Quincy Friday night for the first time in 30 years. Prairieland-Black – Rushville-Industry The reign of Abingdon-Avon is finally over in the Prairieland-Black. Many thought that this year’s team wasn’t like the A-Town teams of old, and they turned out to be right. In fact, it was the Rockets who broke the Tornadoes’ 19-game conference winning streak in a 25-18 Week 4 win. A Week 6 loss to then-winless Lewistown let the other teams in the conference have a chance to steal the crown. However the Rockets took care of business the following week against South Fulton. Now Coach Hebb’s rushing attack is looking to move to 7-2 and improve their seeding in the 2A playoffs. Lincoln Trail – Stark County It’s been a dream season for the Rebels. A flawless 9-0 regular season is looking like a forgone conclusion with the way they’ve dismantled nearly everybody on their schedule. Their closest game was a 21-14 victory over second-place Annawan/Wethersfield, who will most likely be placed in 2A for the playoffs. Meanwhile, Stark County has been ranked in the top 10 of the 1A rankings the entire season. The offense has been a juggernaut, averaging 43.5 points per game. On the other side of the ball, the defense has been dominant, allowing under 9 points per game. The real challenge will come when they have to face the best teams from the northern part of the state in the playoffs. Lena-Winslow, Dakota, Galena, and defending 1A champ Forreston are a few teams the Rebels could see in the state quarterfinals or semifinals.
