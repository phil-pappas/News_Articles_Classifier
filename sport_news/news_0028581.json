You had to know where you were on a map. Were you fifty feet from this pole or this intersection to where your jurisdiction started? We just really wanted to get rid of all that grey area.”\nHe says the police department's boundaries haven't been adjusted for at least two decades.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T02:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T07:29:54.748+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
