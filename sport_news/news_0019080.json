We are all friends and began surfing here at the inlet together back in the ’80s,” Pasonski said. \nIn the Men’s Open division, Melbourne High School team member Chauncey Robinson prevailed, bringing home one of nine division titles for Brevard. He was also the back-to-back winner of the U-18 division. \n“I’m stoked,” Robinson said. “I am looking forward to leading the Bulldogs to victory at the NSSA (National Scholastic Surfing Association’s) high school event this year. The waves, though much smaller than the last few weeks, of course, were really fun.” \nIn the U-12 division, Cocoa Beach 11-year-old William Hedleston earned the right to be chaired to the beach and a first-place trophy that stood almost his height. His smile was enough to show his satisfaction for his efforts. \n“I’ve gone back and forth with these guys in a lot of different events, they are all good surfers. I am thankful for this win here,” he smiled. He also took third in the U-14 division. \nOn the female side, 10-year-old Zoe Benedetto, who noted she has won every local ASF chapter event throughout this season in the U-12 division, showed why she deserved to win this championship event as well. Her rides to the beach, maneuvering the waves with clever cutbacks, had all judges putting her in first throughout the heat. \n“You just have to believe in yourself,” she said. “I plan on competing in NSSA as well this season. I love to surf.” \nRachel Presti, 13, a familiar Space Coast face and name, as well, was the winner of both the U-14 and U-16 divisions and took third in the U-18. She will be headed next week to California again to support the ISA (International Surfing America) team, one in which she will be an alternate competitor. She will also be looking forward to surfing the annual Ron Jon Beach and Boards Festival WSL Junior Women’s pro next spring again. \nRounding out the top winners for Brevard were Lauren McClean Holland, who was first in the Ladies division and Randy Nolan, who took first in the Senior Men’s division. \nNolan, who ministers to youth at several Brevard locations, said he was thrilled to have won his first ASF Championship title. \n“I used to compete years ago, and decided to get back into it just recently, so I am really stoked. The folks who run this event here are great and the vibe is awesome,” Nolan said. \nASF Championships results", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T04:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T08:13:00.833+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
