They’ve got a great back in Terrell Sutton and I think they’re going to get him involved in their game play. \n“If they can establish the run, I think it sets up the rest of their packages. We have to play together.” \nWhat the Argos have done well of late, at least in beating the Ottawa RedBlacks, involves pass drops and zone drops, spacing and tightening the window for quarterbacks when attempting throws. \nNo facet of the Argos’ game is far from complete, including the defence, but the unit has been overlooked with QB Trevor Harris throwing as well as he has been, with Chad Owens heading back to Montreal following a punt-return major in Toronto’s first visit to Ottawa and then in the next game, producing that one-handed diving touchdown reception for the game-winner. \nBecause of injuries, Jones has had Brandon Isaac, Cory Greenwood, Vincent Agnew, James Yurichuk, Matt Black and Thomas Miles line up next to him this season. \nIsaac is back at strong side with Miles unofficially replacing Greenwood, who played at Concordia but remains out of the Toronto lineup following his second concussion this CFL season. \nWhen Jones needs a break, Brian Rolle enters the game. \n“Brian came in when I got a little bit winded (in Ottawa) and that’s because I don’t want to let my team down,’’ said Jones. “We work together. Being on special teams and then on defence, that’s part of the game and I understood last year (Jones’ first in Toronto). It’s part of the job.” \nAnd right now, Jones is doing his job well. \nCUMMINGS AND GOINGS \nEuclid Cummings is quietly coming of age as a dominant CFL defensive lineman, getting better each time he steps on the field, becoming more comfortable in his role and responsibilities. \nIn Ottawa, he produced a career-first, a two-sack game as the Argonauts emerged with a late-game win at TD Place Stadium. \n“I’m feeling good,’’ said Cummings. “We’ve got five games left and you can start to see the light at the end of the tunnel. It’s time now to focus in more and get this win.” \nThe Double Blue play the host Alouettes on Monday afternoon, one of those matchups where records mean nothing. \nMontreal has shown it can beat the CFL’s elite when the offence is moving the football and avoiding turnovers, when specials teams are solid and when the team’s defence is dominating opponents. \n“I’m thankful for the two sacks and finally my hard work is starting to come out — but I just have to string games together,’’ said Cummings. \n“It’s not about performing in one game. The key is play well over the next five games.” \nFour guys rushing, players being rotated, a defensive line that has anchored the defence in recent weeks, the Boatmen can go a long way in wrapping up a post-season berth if they can put constant pressure on the Montreal quarterback on Monday. \nIT’S ALL ON THE LINE \nOne doesn’t have to look far to find the heart and soul of a football’s team makeup when all that’s required is a quick glance at the offensive line. \nAt the end of the day, football remains a game won in the trenches, the best teams usually separating themselves from the competition based on the strength of their line play. \nIn Toronto’s past two games, both wins over the RedBlacks, both games played in Ottawa, the Argonauts’ defensive line was asked to contain QB Henry Burris rather than pad stats by going for sacks. \nWhile the Argos aren’t exactly a run team, the offensive line did provide enough protection for Double Blue QB Trevor Harris, who enters Monday’s game in Montreal by coming off a five-touchdown performance. \nToronto lost starting right tackle Chris Van Zeyl with a calf injury and all kinds of options have been explored. \nWhile nothing is ever etched in stone, Greg Van Roten has now surfaced as a possible starter against the Als. \nVan Roten, who played for the NFL’s Green Bay Packers, has a high football IQ and he’s very versatile having started the season as Toronto’s starting centre when veteran Jeff Keeping was unable to play. \nVan Roten was initially pencilled in as Toronto’s starting guard, but he can play all positions. \nVan Roten and Tyler Holmes are the only offensive linemen to start every game for the Argos, who face a big test against Montreal’s well-rested and desperate defence, a unit that is more than capable of rising to the occasion. \nVan Roten and Holmes are arguably the leading candidates to emerge as Toronto’s top offensive lineman when members of the media soon begin voting on the various awards.
