A family of four gets a bird’s eye view of the bright reds, yellows and oranges in the Pocono Mountains on Camelback Mountain Resort’s Treetop Flyer scenic chair lift.\n“We wanted to get away for the weekend and there were lots of fun activities for the kids to do, so we decided to give it a try,” said visitor Carly Pfeffer.\nIt’s essentially a ski lift ride up the mountain in Tannersville, said Kelly Joffe of Camelback Mountain Resort Marketing.\n“Right now, it’s a beautiful time of year because the leaves are changing over, and it’s really nice, especially on a day like this,” Joffe said.\nFor $5, you can hop on and enjoy the view. It’s about a 16-minute round trip, with a stunning view from the top. This is the first fall season that Camelback has opened its ski life for guests to enjoy the fall foliage, and so far, it’s been a huge hit. Resort officials say they’ve also built fall getaway packages, including a room, breakfast and other outdoor activities, such as Segway treks.\nThe scenic ride runs every weekend through early November.\nCopyright 2015 WNEP via CNN.
