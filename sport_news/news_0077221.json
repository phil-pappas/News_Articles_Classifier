Belvidere coach Josh Costantino looked a little bit like the cat that caught the canary when discussing the County Seaters’ first touchdown, a 65-yard pass from junior quarterback Jake Thornton to senior tight end Jordan Allen on Belvidere’s second play from scrimmage. “They put nine men in the box against us last season and we decided that if they gave us that same defense again we were going to have a play for it,” Costantino said. “We were happy to see it, and we had that play ready all week.” Allen released off the line with no defender on him and was in his own area code when he caught the pass utterly alone to romp in with a score that set the tone for the game. \nBig plays Belvidere’s bane. On a night when a lot went right for Belvidere, Costantino didn’t like how Roselle Park scored – a 65-yard run and 35-yard pass. “Every game we have played we have given up big plays,” he said. “We can’t keep letting that happen.” Nine penalties on the County Seaters didn’t thrill Costantino, either. \nCounty Seaters have an answer. After Roselle Park had closed to within 27-14 late in the third quarter on that 65-yard TD run, Belvidere may have looked the slightest bit wobbly. But instead, the Seaters went on an 80-yard drive for the clinching score. Junior fullback Zack DeLuca converted a 3rd-and-1 and two 4th-and-1s on the march, which was capped by Thornton’s 5-yard TD pass to senior halfback Tommy Madeo who was wide open. “(Belvidere offensive coach Bob) Merle Sr. made a great call getting me the ball there,” Madeo said. “After they scored we pulled it together and and had that 80-yard drive.” \nStrange moment. Late in the first quarter Roselle Park head coach Terrance Hanratty made the odd call of the night. Belvidere faced 2nd-and-15 at its own 32, and Thornton completed a 6-yard pass to Madeo. But the County Seaters were flagged for illegal use of hands, which would have resulted in second down and at least 20. But Hanratty declined the penalty, leaving Belvidere in 3rd-and-9. DeLuca charged up the middle for 10 yards and a first down and the Seaters went on to score their second touchdown. That may well not have happened had Roselle Park taken that penalty.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T08:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T02:21:21.210+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
