Brown and South Meck \nCharlotte Catholic, up to No. 2 in poll, eyes return to 4A title game Mallard Creek running back Chancery Bowman (right)has been a major contributer in the Mavericks’ success this season. Jeff Siner jsiner@charlotteobserver.com i Order Reprint of this Story \nAt the start of the 2015 high school football season, I thought Observer-area teams would have a real shot at winning state championships in multiple classes. \nAs the season reaches its midway point, I still feel that way. In fact, I think the chances now are even better. \nMallard Creek began the season as the N.C. 4AA favorite, and despite a somewhat surprising loss at Duncan Byrnes (S.C.) -- when the Mavericks allowed 21 points before most fans got comfortable in their seats and ultimately lost 31-29 on a late field goal -- the Mavericks are still the favorite. \nMallard Creek has come out fairly cleanly through one of the toughest schedules in recent memory and is getting healthy. In a span of about six weeks, the Mavericks played three national powers. Another tough game, against Sweet 16 No. 7 Hough, is ahead Friday. \n▪ Charlotte Catholic reached the 4A state championship game in December 2014, and the Cougars started this season No. 5 in the Sweet 16. They’re now at No. 2, led by one of the best defenses we’ve seen at the school. Catholic has allowed 20 points in five weeks. \nIn South Carolina, No. 3 Rock Hill Northwestern looks like a 4A state title contender, and 3A South Pointe -- which beat No. 8 Vance and was a dropped 2-point PAT from beating Northwestern -- looks like a favorite to repeat as state champion. \n▪ As always, there have been surprises. Coach Mike Newsome’s A.L. Brown team was unranked when the season started and an afterthought in the MECKA 8 championship discussions, where it seemed like a two-horse race between Vance and Mallard Creek. \nBrown upset Vance Monday 31-14 and has risen to No. 4 in the Sweet 16. \nSouth Meck, unranked when the season started, has climbed to No. 6. The Sabres haven’t been 6-0 in 26 years. \n▪ There are three other Sweet 16 teams that were unranked when the season began: No. 13 Davidson Day (6-0) has surprised coach Chad Grier, particularly on defense; No. 14 Monroe, filled with talented skill players, will be a state title contender in the 2A class (again); and No. 15 Concord has won five in a row since it gave A.L. Brown its toughest game in Week 1. Brown’s performance since then shows just how strong the Spiders are. \nWertz: 704-358-5133; Twitter: @langstonwertzjr \nObserver Sweet 16 at midseason \nTeam (Class)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-07T18:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T03:14:40.393+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
