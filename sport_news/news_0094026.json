Even after falling on her uneven bars routine at the world championships, the veteran British gymnast praised her team.\nBritain led the team standings after its qualifying session, posting the highest score on three of the four events. And on bars, where Downing and sister, Ellie, both fell, they were second.\nAlthough Russia unseated them atop the leaderboard by the end of the night, Rebecca Downie couldn’t be too disappointed. Once happy to make a team final at the world championships, the Brits are in position for potentially their best finish yet.\nThere’s still another day of qualifying here at The SSE Hydro — and one that includes strong American and Chinese teams, at that — but Britain’s performance Friday all but assures the team of a spot in Tuesday’s final.\n“The whole team GB as a unit, it’s so strong, so close and just willing each other on,” said Downie.\nUSA TODAY\nAge only a number for 40-year-old gymnast Oksana Chusovitina\nIt’s something fellow veteran Ruby Harrold echoed.\n“We still do have doubts,” she said. “We try not to think of ourselves as the best because things do happen. But knowing that you’ve got a strong team and personally we know that we can deliver definitely helps.”\nIn their first major international competition on UK soil since the London Olympics, the women’s team showed just how far it had come in that time. British gymnastics improved in large part thanks to those Games, but in the years since it has shown that that wasn’t a one-off.\nThe program that saw funding cuts after Athens benefited from an increase in cash and a more centralized national program before the London Olympics. Success there served as a precursor for this quadrennium.\nAmanda Reddin — the longtime coach of Beth Tweddle, the country’s most successful gymnast ever — took over the national program after the Olympics. That funding has led to a nutritionist, sport psychologist and strength and conditioning coach.\n“Everybody plays their part,” said Downie. “Everybody now is kind of looking for those extra 1 percent to 10 percent step that make that performance even better.”\nWhile the British men were quicker to achieve success internationally, the women have become a factor in recent years and might have their deepest team yet.\nThe women finished fifth and sixth, respectively, in the 2011 and 2014 worlds. At the European championships last year, the team took silver. At this year’s European championships, Ellie Downie was the first Brit ever to medal in the all-around, taking bronze.\nNow, with worlds on their home turf, they’re in position for even more. The top eight teams qualify their spot for the Rio Olympics next year.\n“Our whole team’s very strong now,” said Amy Tinkler, who had the top all-around score for the Brits. “I think it’s strongest team Britain’s had, and potentially we could have had five people go for all-around there.”\nThat showed Friday. Despite the falls on bars, the Brits were composed and proud of what they’d done. Making the final, should their results hold, is now the expectation rather than the exception.\n“There’s been a few turning points,” said Harrold, “but overall we’re building and we’re developing.”\n2 CONNECT 8 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/190185afd1cb995a7ebca52709ef36f1c4143163/c=0-277-3280-4650&r=537&c=0-0-534-712/local/-/media/2015/10/23/USATODAY/USATODAY/635812126063479328-AFP-545651692-76957827.JPG", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/10/23/USATODAY/USATODAY/635812126063479328-AFP-545651692-76957827.JPG", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/b2e9b23cd767d8a10443c055f0220c24d0200e88/r=266x400/local/-/media/2015/10/23/USATODAY/USATODAY/635812126063479328-AFP-545651692-76957827.JPG", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1LSDG4c&mini=true", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/f74d20a0d317508d13ac18b5440bf177ec5c376f/c=465-0-2795-2330/local/-/media/2015/10/23/USATODAY/USATODAY/635812107350535374-EPA-BRITAIN-SCOTLAND-GYMNASTICS-76949353.JPG", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1LSDG4c&text=Strong%20worlds%20showing%20a%20sign%20of%20British%20gymnastics%27%20post-London%20progression&via=usatoday"], "published": "2015-10-24T00:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T00:07:26.011+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
