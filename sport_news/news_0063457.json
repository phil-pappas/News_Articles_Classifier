At the time they were considering a private member’s motion from an NDP MPP to ban random and arbitrary carding, also known as street checks.\n“It’s a historic day,” said Margaret Parsons, executive director of the African-Canadian Legal Clinic, who watched the debate in the legislature.\n“This is a monumental shift in our province,” said Parsons, who has worked to end carding. She repeatedly paused to compose herself when talking to the Star outside the legislature.\n“We have been around for 21 years. We have been fighting on this issue since the day our doors opened, in July 1994.”\nEarlier in the legislature, Naqvi moved quickly during debate to address the motion from NDP MPP and deputy party leader Jagmeet Singh.\n“We as a government stand opposed, Speaker, to any arbitrary, random stops by the police simply to collect information when there are no grounds or reason to do so,” Naqvi said. “We have heard from the community that street checks, by definition, are arbitrary as well as discriminatory and therefore cannot be regulated; they must simply be ended. The province agrees that these types of stops must end.”\nAsked later, outside the legislature, if Premier Kathleen Wynne, who was not at Thursday’s debate on the issue, supports the ban of carding and random street checks, Naqvi emphatically said, “What we’re doing is our government’s position under the leadership of premier Kathleen Wynne.”\nNaqvi, who at the beginning of the summer began a provincewide consultation to bring in new regulations for carding and street checks, has come under fire for trying to regulate a practice that critics believe is unconstitutional and must end.\nSpokespersons for two Ontario police forces downplayed the impact of Naqvi’s statement. “Nothing that the minister has said clashes with what Chief (Mark) Saunders has said,” said Toronto police spokesman Mark Pugash.\nStaff Sgt. Dan Richardson of Peel police said that “Chief (Jennifer) Evans has never supported the random or arbitrary stopping and collection of information from our citizens” but that street checks are valuable under five circumstances defined by Peel police.\nProgressive Conservative member Randy Hillier (Lanark-Frontenac-Lennox and Addington) called the Liberal government’s public consultations, led by Naqvi, a “facade.” He was one of eight MPPs who said inside the legislature that the practice must end. Many described how carding has devastated members of their communities and led to a breakdown of relations between racialized groups and police forces.\nAsked outside the legislature to confirm that his government will end the practice, Naqvi said, “Absolutely. It’s unacceptable and we will put an end to it.” He said regulation banning random street checks will be in place by the end of the fall, will become part of the Police Services Act, which governs Ontario’s police forces, and will include:\nStronger guidelines for police who conduct street checks as part of an investigation or because of suspicious activity. Rules guaranteeing that charter rights are protected for anyone who is checked. Clear rules on how police can collect carding data, use the data, as well as the length of time the data can be stored. During provincial consultations people said one of their biggest concerns was having no idea how their personal information was being used by police and how long it was being kept. Carding is a practice that involves officers stopping citizens and storing their details in a police database. Data shows that in Toronto, Mississauga, Brampton and London, black individuals are more than three times as likely to be carded than whites. The data also shows that other visible minorities are disproportionately stopped.\nAnyone who is being carded can legally walk away from police.\nBut critics argue the practice violates Charter rights that protect against unlawful search and seizure and detention, as well as provisions of the Ontario Human Rights Code. Singh, who says he has been carded by police, represents a riding in Brampton and singled out Peel’s Evans when he read out his motion in the Legislature.\n“In my region, Peel Region, the Peel police services board met . . . and voted to suspend the practice of street checks in the Region of Peel. (That vote) was championed by two of the mayors of two of the largest cities in our province (Mississauga’s Bonnie Crombie and Brampton’s Linda Jeffrey).”\n“Chief Evans said, ‘No.’ ”\nAt the time, Evans provided six examples of crimes that were solved with help from street-check data, but admitted her force has “no system” to prove the practice works. Data shows that between 2009 and 2014, Peel police conducted 159,303 street checks and black people were three times more likely to be stopped than whites.\nSingh said that if police boards are powerless and police chiefs refuse to listen to their citizens, “the province has to take action.”\nToronto police long resisted its board’s calls for action on carding, until former chief Bill Blair suspended the practice in January. Toronto Mayor John Tory, who sits on the city’s police board, defended the practice but when faced by public outrage in June reversed his position and said it had to go.\nNaqvi was asked what will happen if police forces do not comply with the ban or the other regulations his government will bring in.\n“They will have no option but to comply with the regulation.”\nMore on thestar.com\nRepublicans fail to tarnish Hillary Clinton at Benghazi hearing\nOntario MDs plan charter challenge against provincial government", "external_links": ["http://static.freeskreen.com/publisher/52/freeskreen.min.js"], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T07:13:29.095+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
