Joining them in the Sac-Joaquin Section Division III Tournament next Monday at Bing Maloney Golf Course in Sacramento are Sierra and Kimball.“We’re hoping to do well as a team,” said Lancers coach Brian Goulart.“I’ll take 426 next week (in the divisional sectional),” he added.East Union smoked the field thanks to the efforts of Brooke Riley (69), Brittany Conijn (87), Rebecca Leonard (89), Natalie Cowan (89) and Allie Tojii (92).All five placed in the top 12 individually in the six-team field.No surprise that Riley sizzled, carding several birdies and an eagle on the par 5 No. 6.She had an impressive drive, leaving her 150 yards shy of the target. After an 8-iron shot on to the green, Riley delivered on the 12 footer.Her score may have been even better if not for a couple of bogeys.Riley, who also earned league MVP for a fourth straight year, gladly took the medalist honor and team title.“Our goal this year is about the team,” she said.Conijn provided the big boost thus far. “She’s been very consistent as of late,” Goulart said.He also praised Leonard, who like Riley and Conijn, is a senior.Kimball took second with a 474.But it was the battle for the third and final team spot that drew plenty of interest. In the end, the Timberwolves (492) won out, finishing one stroke better than Central Catholic (493) and three ahead of Oakdale (495).“We knew it was going to be close,” Sierra coach Jack Thomson said.His top player McKenna Doyle helped pave the way by firing an 84. Individually, she tied Maya Crooms of Kimball for third, with Taylor Stewart (82) of Oakdale taking second place. “McKenna is a very good golfer. She’s played very well this whole season,” said Thomson.The Timberwolves’ Kayla Wilson (90) and Legacy Barnes (91) also finished among the top 12.Among the players advancing to next week’s event are Stewart, Gianna Van Kloveren (Central Catholic), Jen Morrow (Central Catholic), Emily Lehman (Central Catholic) and Sedonia Estacio (Central Catholic).Manteca High (583) also played in the VOL event.“We’re a young team so this was a good experience for us,” said Buffaloes coach Andrea Hiatt.Her top player was senior Danica Hunt, who fired a 105.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T11:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T00:18:08.336+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
