I’m harnessing that into something positive.” \nTwo weeks ago, Brees missed his first start due to injury since joining the Saints in 2006. Neither he nor the team is about to admit his sore shoulder might be limiting the star, but the Saints’ record would seem to indicate otherwise. Matt Cassel no quick fix for Cowboys' offensive woes \nSurprisingly, though, the Saints' passing attack remains potent. New Orleans averages 302 passing yards per game, third best in the NFL. Though he has played in one fewer game, Brees’ six touchdowns this season match those thrown by Falcons quarterback Matt Ryan. \nBut no matter how much emphasis the Saints emphasize the pass, they must answer for a defense that ranks last in the NFL with 409 yards allowed per game. New Orleans has been sloppy with protection, too. Brees has taken more hits at this point in 2015 than at any similar point in his career, and the Saints’ turnover margin of -5 leaves them tied for 28th in the league. \nStill, Brees insisted no one in New Orleans is pushing the panic button despite going 0-2 in the NFC South and in danger of falling further behind with a loss to Atlanta. Week 6 fantasy football rankings \n“I really haven’t stressed about it that much,” Brees said. “I feel like the plays will come. You just got to keep plugging away, keep dialing them up, and good things will start to happen.” \nNew Orleans would appear to have one thing in its favor: since 2006, the Saints have won prime time games at home at an impressive 81% clip. The team’s lone win this season came in just that situation, a Sunday night overtime victory over the Dallas Cowboys in Week 4. \nPHOTOS: Best of NFL Week 5 Steelers running back Le'Veon Bell (26) dives across the goal line to score the game-winning touchdown on the final play against the Chargers.
