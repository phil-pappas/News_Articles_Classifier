Sunday, 24th April 2005. United are trailing 0-1 to Newcastle at Old Trafford. A 19-year-old Rooney is having a torrid game. Shortly before the 57th minute, the striker is booked for a late challenge. Perplexed, he yells at the referee Neale Barry as the game continues. As he’s jogging and shouting alongside Barry, the ball then falls to him from a defensive header. On pure instinct, Rooney charges towards it and thumps it from 25 yards flush into the top left corner. United went on to win the game 2-1. \nThis is Wayne Rooney. Visceral, pugnacious, strong, quick, acrobatic; the fictional making of a perfect striker that’s stepped out of the comic book. Since arriving at Manchester United in 2004, Rooney has scored 10+ Premier League (all following stats are PL-based) goals every season and averages 0.49 goals per game (gpg). \nRooney is the last remaining player of the squad that greeted him when he joined Old Trafford in 2004. \nBut he is not the same player. \nPerhaps it was the departure of Sir Alex Ferguson in 2013, whose relationship with Rooney was acrimonious at the time, which triggered the trough the 29-year-old is now in. \nIn the last three seasons under SAF, Rooney scored 50 goals @ an average of 0.56 gpg. Since SAF’s departure, he has scored 30 goals @ 0.43 gpg. \nIn the last couple years of SAF’s tenure, he began to deploy Rooney in a deeper midfield role; realising the centre-forward had lost parts from his utility belt of striking attributes. \nWayne excelled in a position which complimented his long-ball distribution, reading of the game and eagerness to win back the ball. \nThis is where Rooney began to mature as a player and person, which, for the sake of his game, was the worst thing that happened to him. \nDavid Moyes arrived in 2013 and saw the new, polished characteristics in the player he coached as a feisty teenager at Everton. \nHe toyed with Rooney’s position in a woeful season which saw David de Gea, Ryan Giggs and Rooney (17 goals @ 0.59 gpg) carry the club towards any standard of credibility. \nThen came the summer of 2014. New Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal made Rooney United captain on Tuesday, 12th August. 16 days later, England manager Roy Hodgson named Rooney England captain. \nThis was now a man with responsibility, not only off the pitch – where he has two young boys, and a third child on the way – but on it too. \nAs a captain you should restrain yourself from outbursts of rage; be a collected figure to which teammates can turn - just ask Roy Keane. \nRooney doesn't suit such specifications. \nLast season LvG received much criticism for playing Rooney in midfield, citing it as the reason why he struggled for form and goals. By spring, he was back playing up front, but his presence was still nullified, most noticeably in the 4-2 derby win over City, where Gary Neville described him as a “silent dominator” in his Sky Sports column. \nThis season LvG has backed Rooney in a centre-forward position, confident he can deliver 20 goals for the season, but one in seven so far doesn’t vindicate that confidence. \nWatching Rooney up front now is frustrating. He always wants one more touch (think Kyle Walker’s OG first day of the season), he rarely strikes the ball well first time, and his decision-making when running with the ball on the counter attack usually ends with the opposition in possession. \nHe is not the player he once was. And this is not a criticism of him at all; Rooney is not finished by any means. He'll still produce a few breathtaking moments here and there, because he still has that innate ability. \nOne thing that hasn't changed is Rooney's quarrels with the officials. As a captain, he's somewhat obliged to talk with them now, which he does, a lot. \nLet's just hope that next time he's shouting at the referee, a ball falls invitingly from 25 yards out.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T12:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T20:12:18.902+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
