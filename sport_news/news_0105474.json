(AP) - NASCAR will use the lower-downforce rules package preferred by drivers next season. \nThe base package announced Wednesday was used at Kentucky Speedway and Darlington Raceway this summer as NASCAR tried different ideas while trying to improve the racing. Drivers were overwhelmingly in favor of the package that reduced downforce and made the cars more difficult to drive. \nThe 2016 package will feature a 3.5-inch spoiler, a 0.25-inch front leading splitter edge and a 33-inch radiator pan. It's identical to the package used in the August race at Darlington. The package used at Kentucky in July had a 25-inch radiator pan. \nThe base package will permit track-specific tire combinations and drive train configurations. NASCAR wanted that flexibility to produce the best racing for various track lengths and layouts. \n(Copyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
