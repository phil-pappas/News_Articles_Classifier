The Houston Texans quarterback situation is once again a question, and head coach Bill O’Brien isn’t ready to name a starter.\nAdChoices According to ESPN’s Tania Ganguli, O’Brien didn’t commit to either Ryan Mallett or Brian Hoyer after the Week 5 loss to the Indianapolis Colts.\n“Brian, I thought, did a good job tonight, but we’ll talk about it. I haven’t even talked to the staff yet about it. We’ll sit down and review the film. I thought Brian did a good job though.”\nHoyer earned the initial starting nod, but Houston’s quarterback situation has been like a roller coaster. After the veteran’s porous start in the season opener, O’Brien turned to Mallett, who remained under center until the Atlanta Falcons took a 42-0 lead in Week 4.\nAlthough Mallett was named the starter for Thursday, he temporarily exited the field due to a chest injury. But, that quickly turned temporary when Hoyer guided the Texans offense more efficiently than Mallett had.\nHoyer finished 24-of-31 for 312 yards and two touchdowns, but his final throw of the outing swiftly swung the competition door completely open. For no good reason, Hoyer lofted a third-down prayer over the middle of the field, which Indianapolis intercepted and soon sealed the game.\nO’Brien and the Houston staff have a couple extra days to finalize a decision before the Texans take on the Jacksonville Jaguars on Oct. 18.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.yardbarker.com/", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/13842468/houston-texans-coach-bill-obrien-commit-starting-quarterback-loss-indianapolis-colts"], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T03:27:46.490+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
