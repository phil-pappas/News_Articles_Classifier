It's one of the few things in these parts that feels exactly as it did 40 years ago. Or 60 years ago. Or 80 years ago. You don't really get that vibe at AT&T Stadium in Arlington.\nIt feels the same, yes, but this one may feel very different as well.\nSure, Texas fans know what it's like to wake up early, come to the Cotton Bowl and see their team take a beating at the hands of Bob Stoops' Oklahoma Sooners.\n63-14 in 2000 ... 65-13 in 2003 ... 55-17 in 2011 ... 63-21 in 2012.\nAnd, by the way, all of those Longhorns teams were ranked in the top 15 at the time.\nNeedless to say, the team Charlie Strong brings to the Cotton Bowl on Saturday is unranked and unlike most anything the Red River Showdown has seen. Texas is 1-4 this season, has won one of its last seven games and has not held an opponent below 28 points in that stretch.\nIf the Longhorns lead the Big 12 in anything, it's Twitter fights among their own players, which all began with freshman cornerback Kris Boyd retweeting from his phone at halftime of a game Texas was trailing by 37 points Saturday in Fort Worth. Yes, Boyd's still on the team. Yes, Boyd is expected to start, which gets to one of my two problems I have with Strong's leadership of this team.\nTexas is 7-11 under Strong, and, yeah, that's awful. Mack Brown's worst two-year stretch, the one that began his downward spiral to an inglorious exit, was 13-12. If Strong gets to 13-12 by the time the Longhorns are walking off the field Dec. 5 in Waco, he should get a lifetime contract.\nThe record's bad, but where is the discipline on this team? For a man whose list of rules includes sitting up front in classrooms and not wearing headphones in class, how is being on your phone to tweet about joining the Aggies OK?\nLeaving the field after the embarrassment of that 50-7 defeat at TCU, defensive coordinator Vance Bedford checked with a media member to see if what he heard was true, to see if Boyd had been on Twitter at halftime responding to a tweet about joining the Aggies. He was told it was true.\nYou would expect a disciplinarian like Strong to use this as a teaching moment, to set an example for all future Longhorns under his watch.\nBoyd's penalty?\nUhh, basically nothing. Bedford said this week that Boyd getting called out on social media was \"all the punishment he needs.\" Strong made an odd, vague statement saying that players shouldn't be on their phones at halftime.\nInteresting. It seems maybe Charlie Strong is not so different from coaches everywhere. If you're a good player and you're needed, you get to play by a different set of rules.\nBoyd is one of several true freshmen playing key roles for this team. Oklahoma will go up against plenty of redshirt freshmen as well, not to mention an offensive coordinator (Jay Norvell) learning on the fly after being dismissed from Stoops' staff after last season.\nYou could call Texas a work in progress if there were signs of progress. But whatever was represented last year by that November run through West Virginia, Texas Tech and Oklahoma State -- all one-sided games in the Longhorns' favor, by the way -- is long gone.\nAbout the best that Longhorns fans can hope for is to be grumbling about the officiating (Oklahoma State) or the kicker (UCLA) and not the disastrous performance of the players and coaches (Notre Dame, TCU).\nHere's the other puzzling part. Strong's background is defense. He knows what it takes to build a winning unit. Even at this game a year ago, the hits the Longhorns defense was laying on OU gave fans a reason to hope.\nWhere did all of that go?\nTexas ranks 67th in total defense, allowing more than 400 yards per game. Texas ranks 113th in scoring defense, surrendering 38.2 points per game.\nIf you're short on skill players or missing a strong quarterback, offense is tough to manage. Scheme, effort and coaching adjustments can go a long way in constructing a good defense even before you recruit the players that can give you a great defense.\nLonghorns fans are asking how Strong's second defense can look this porous.\nAnd worst of all, Longhorns fans are showing a strong lack of interest in this great rivalry. Who can recall the last time more than 2,000 tickets in the Texas half of the stadium were still available 48 hours before kickoff?\nI checked a popular ticket resale site and could not readily find tickets in the OU end of the stadium. You want to sit on the burnt orange side? Pick a section.\nLike I said, Texas' fans have seen stuff that was something like this in recent years. But never quite like this.\nIf you want to see something new Saturday at the State Fair, it doesn't have to be the deep-fried bacon cheeseburger basket.\nTwitter: @TimCowlishaw.\nMore Texas Longhorns stories\nÂ\nTexas Longhorns\nCoach:Â Charlie Strong, second season with Texas (0-1 against Oklahoma)\n2015Â Record:Â 1-4, 0-2 in Big 12\nLast:Â Lost to TCU, 50-7, on Oct. 3\nUT's defensive struggles especially painful for Strong\nLonghorn football stars serve as backups for Bevo Partyâ™s star attraction\nCotton Bowl tunnel can be 'surreal' experience in Red River Showdown\nTexas, OU Heisman winners Earl Campbell and Billy Sims will be on hand\nTexas prediction: Sooners, Mayfield too much for Longhorns in Red River Showdown\nFive things Texas fans should know about No. 10 Oklahoma: Mayfield brings fierce passing offense to Cotton Bowl\nUT's strong confident QB Heard will bounce back after tough game vs. TCU\nForeman's success won't reduce role for UT running back Johnathan Gray\nUT's Heard on Horns' social media spat: I'm gonna get their phones and delete their Twitter'\nSherrington: Charlie Strong might be the right coach for Texas if he gets enough time\nCarlton: Tweets lead to Longhorns chirping\nTexas Twitter war: Longhorn players fight on social media\nTexas quotable: 'It's time for us to pull this team together'\nBest in Texas breakdown (10/5): Longhorns well behind in-state rivals; SMU remains a mystery\nNational reaction: Longhorns are scary bad; collateral damage on recruiting\nCarlton: Playing days prepared Mike Perrin for challenges as interim Texas AD\nCould it get any worse for Longhorns?
