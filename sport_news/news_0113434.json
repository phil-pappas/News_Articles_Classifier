You talk about the maturity he has being a freshman out there … I think that’s really important.”\nGaskin, the former O’Dea High star, has 79 carries for 498 yards — 6.3 yards per carry — and five touchdowns. Coaches have lauded Gaskin’s patient running style and natural vision.\n“The thing that’s most surprising for me is just a guy who was on a bus to go play Seattle Prep a year ago is now out there playing (well at this level),” Bhonapha said. “And his maturity level — the game is not too big for him, he doesn’t get full of himself; he just takes it all in stride and continually tries to get better day after day.”\nMost Read Stories Seahawks’ Fred Jackson crashes car; Cops say no evidence of drag racing Fugitive felon, linked to motorcycle gang, captured in Lynnwood after 4-month hunt Oregon alum to abusive Huskies fans: This rivalry doesn't need you Loss of middle-income jobs seen as threat to region’s competitiveness Seattle Seahawks Monday injury report: Nine players sit out Unlimited Digital Access. $1 for 4 weeks. Against Oregon, the 5-foot-9, 192-pound Gaskin had a 72-yard TD run; he also had a 78-yard TD run against Sacramento State last month.\n“For him to have a couple breakout runs is nice for me,” Bhonapha said, “because it’s just bonus. But I really think … where his strength is, is really fighting to get those extra tough yards. That’s where Myles is a different player.”\nPer UW’s team policy, freshmen generally are not available for media interviews.\nIMG_0511 Adam Jude : 206-464-2364 or ajude@seattletimes.com ; on Twitter: @A_Jude .
