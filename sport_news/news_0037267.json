He was replaced by 22-year-old Javier Baez, who homered in the series-clincher and will likely start at shortstop in Russell’s stead. Starlin Castro also has significant experience at shortstop, but has slotted in comfortably at second base for Chicago.\nChicago will be able to add another player to its roster for the coming series against the winner of Thursday’s game between the Mets and Dodgers. Russell would be eligible to return for the World Series, if healthy.\nThe NLCS begins on Saturday at 7:30 p.m. ET. Jon Lester is slated to start Game 1 for the Cubs.\n- Jeremy Woo\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.si.com/", "https://twitter.com/120Sports/status/654725820645138432", "http://www.si.com/mlb/2015/10/15/chicago-cubs-jon-lester-nlcs-game-1-starter-jake-arrieta-game-2", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T03:53:52.948+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
