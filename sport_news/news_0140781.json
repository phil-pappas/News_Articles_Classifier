Here are some highlights.\nQuestion: Could you picture undefeated LSU vs. undefeated A&M at the end of the season?\nKate Hairopoulos: H . Don't think it's likely both will be undefeated. LSU has to go to Alabama and Ole Miss. A&M goes to Ole Miss and hosts Alabama. Too much in the way. But I think the game could be important. A&M gets the bonus of playing South Carolina and Vandy out of the East. LSU gets South Carolina this year, in addition to its annual meeting with Florida out of the East.\nQuestion: Does Alabama's loss change your opinion of A&M's chances to take the West?\nKate Hairopoulos: Doesn't really change, more confirms that the SEC West is up for grabs. Now, we all should know better than to count Bama and Saban out at this point.\nQuestion: The Aggies don't have a bye the rest of the season -- think that will play a factor in some of the later games? It's gonna be tough to run the gauntlet without a break.\nKate Hairopoulos: Actually, they do have a bye on Oct. 10, the week before Alabama, so that works to their favor. But the Aggies have definitely focused more on taking care of their bodies and recovery than a year ago. I'm writing about it for Saturday, because the Arkansas game a year ago is when they really got beat up and the three-game losing streak followed. A&M hired a yoga instructor to take the players through yoga every Sunday - just picture that! I'll also write about some other changes they've made along those lines.\nQuestion: How do you feel about these late-season non-conference games the SEC seems to adore? I guess Western Carolina will be a nice break, but it's kinda lame.\nKate Hairopoulos: You're right, they basically add in an extra bye week before the end of the season. System has worked for SEC, but it is hard not to roll your eyes at the games when other teams are playing meaningful games in November.\nQuestion: Want to share your predictions for the weekend?\nKate Hairopoulos: I predict Texas A&M rolls Arkansas 42-21, and Bielema says something stupid after the game.\nCLICK HERE TO VIEW THE FULL CHAT\nOn Twitter:\n @kHairopoulos", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/kHairopoulos"], "published": "2015-09-24T04:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T05:45:46.251+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
