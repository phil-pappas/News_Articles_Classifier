At the end of five years, if the employee lives in the house and works on the campus, the money would be forgiven.\nNext month, Mounier will meet with a leadership group of employers at the Anschutz Medical Campus to pitch her proposal.\nWhile there have been initial discussions with campus officials, there has been no financial commitment. Mounier hopes employers will realize the benefits. The program could help reverse the extremely low homeownership rate in a part of the city that is economically depressed. \"I can't see anybody on the campus not seeing the value of this,\" Mounier said. \"Just the PR value alone ... Think of attracting a doctor for the faculty and he can go to the University of Wyoming or come here and we've got this program and they don't. Where's he going to go?\"\nAdvertisement Lilly Marks, vice president for health affairs for the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, said the school is focused on a program to hire people from the neighborhood .\nThe program faces financial issues because the university has restrictions on how it can spend its money. Mournier is looking for a $500,000 commitment for the initial year.\nSince opening about 10 years ago, the campus is home to more than 23,000 employees and students, and that number is expected to grow. Yet 96 percent of workers commute from Denver and the Front Range.\nThe major employers include CU Anschutz (with five health professional schools), the University of Colorado Hospital and Children's Hospital Colorado, as well as bioscience research laboratories and incubators. The Veterans Affairs medical center under construction will bring more jobs.\nMounier and Farrell had proposed the Live Where You Work boundaries at a 2-mile radius from the center of the campus. But after visiting similar programs in other parts of the country, they decided expand it to include much of north Aurora.\nIn the 80010 zip code, which includes the campus, the homeownership rate is at 36 percent and tenant occupancy is at 64 percent.\nIn the updated Live Where You Work boundary, there are about 24,000 single-family homes, but only 45 are for sale, Farrell said.\nOver the last five years, home values have increased by more than $100,000 in some instances. This project isn't about affordable housing for low-income residents, Farrell said. Instead, it's about giving employees help in buying a house closer to campus.\nBut finances are a concern, Marks said, given that CU's general operating fund comes from taxpayer money that can't be used for employee housing benefits.\nInstead, a private donor may be needed.\nThat's what happened at Mercer University in Macon, Ga. The campus has had a similar program for the past 10 years. The university receives much of its funding from the Knight Foundation and offers up to $20,000 for a down payment for full-time employees to purchase a house in the College Hill neighborhood.\nMercer spokesman Larry Brumley said about 50 homes have been purchased in that historic neighborhood. To ensure the area doesn't become gentrified, the county froze property values so longtime homeowners wouldn't be forced out by rising tax costs.\nGabrielle Gibson is a certified nurse's aide at University of Colorado Hospital. The single mother rents near South Buckley Road and East Mississippi Avenue, a 7-mile commute that can be tricky with traffic and construction of the new light-rail line along Interstate 225.\nGibson welcomes a program that would ease her commute or even allow her to walk to work. \"It helps people that can't afford to own a home, people like me, and gives them more stability,\" she said. \"I definitely would be interested. That would be perfect.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T19:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T14:05:48.324+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
