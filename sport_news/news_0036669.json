He also ranked among the Top 5 assists leaders (3.3 apg) in the Colonial Athletic Association with a 1.38 assist-to-turnover ratio. \n“We are really disappointed for Joe,” CofC Head Coach Earl Grant said. “He worked extremely hard in the spring and summer improving his skill level, athleticism and strength to get ready for the upcoming season and to lead our team. I know he will be in good hands with our medical staff during his surgery and recovery.” \nChealey’s experience on the floor will be missed having played in 60 career games with 42 starts for the Cougars. Last season, he recorded his first career 100+ assist season (109) and knocked down a career-high 30 points at Charlotte – the most points scored in a single game since former CofC standout and Olympian Andrew Lawrence in 2012. \nA business administration major at The College, Chealey had a career-best 12-game double-figure scoring streak going towards the end of last season – a stretch where he averaged 14.3 points per game through the CAA Tournament Quarterfinals. He also shot a team-best 75.8 percent from the free throw line which was the 11th-best percentage in the league.
