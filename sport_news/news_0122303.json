Among the most prominent figures in the early celebration were veterans Alex Rodriguez, CC Sabathia and Carlos Beltran.\n“We know the downside of having older players, but there’s also some good things. There’s perspective, there’s leadership and in times like this when things are a little rocky we’re able to rally the troops,” said Rodriguez, who didn’t overlook the kids who became a big part of the Yankees 2015 saga.\n“If you think of all our rookies, they’ve all shown tremendous respect and poise. They’ve been an integral part of this team,” he said.\nSaid Sabathia: “Those guys have brought the youth and the fun back to the clubhouse.”\nTwo of those guys, first baseman Greg Bird and second baseman Rob Refsnyder, played big parts as each slugged a homer in the 4-1 victory over Boston at the Stadium Thursday to clinch an AL wild-card bid.\nA jubilant Rob Refsnyder high-fives teammates after hitting a solo homer in the eighth inning of the Yankees’ 4-1 playoff-clinching victory on Thursday night at the Stadium. Photo: Charles Wenzelberg “It’s just great to have been able to come up and contribute,” said Bird, the lefty whose shoulders accepted much of the burden when Mark Teixeira was lost for the season.\nWhat felt even better was hitting his 11th homer, the most by a Yankee rookie since Robinson Cano hit 14 in 2005.\n“A special feeling,” Bird said. “Just a special feeling.”\nRefsnyder has evolved into a second-base platoon with lefty swinging Dustin Ackley, but he could not even venture to guess what awaits in the playoffs. Like teammates around him, he wanted to savor the moment.\nAnd savor his homer, the second of his career, which came on the first pitch he saw in the eighth inning to put the Yankees up 4-1.\n“I can’t really put it in to words,” Refsnyder said. “It’s just really cool. Honestly, it’s my first year in the big leagues. It’s just cool to be able to share the moment with some guys I played with, guys I’ve admired throughout my career.”\nWhile the veterans appreciate what the rookies have brought to the club, those youngsters appreciate what the vets provided to them.\n“A wealth of knowledge, what they’ve accomplished in their careers is incredible and to the core they’re awesome guys and I’ve had so much fun watching them,” Refsnyder said.\nModal Trigger Yankees veterans: Rookies 'integral part of this team' Posted: October 2, 2015 View Thumbnails Previous Next Advertisement Dellin Betances and John Ryan Murphy jump for joy as the Yankees clinch.
