Comment Posted Oct. 24, 2015 at 11:20 AM Updated at 8:55 PM Posted Oct. 24, 2015 at 11:20 AM Updated at 8:55 PM â€¢ 1975 RED SOX REVISITED: Winning a pennant, ending a dynasty When the New York Mets adopted their no-time-like-the-present mentality this season, they turned to their well-stocked minor league system for trade bait. Top prospects, particularly pitchers, were required to trade for the high-quality proven major leaguers the Mets wanted to add to their roster in order to go for the gold in 2015. Thanks in large part to Tommy Tanous and his staff, the Mets' farm indeed had the expendable personnel to land Kelly Johnson, Juan Uribe, and Tyler Clippard. The trade for Yoenis Cespedes was engineered using prospects signed just before Tanous arrived in 2011. \"This was about going for it now,\" said Tanous, a Swansea native and the Mets' director of amateur scouting since 2012. The Mets have gone and gotten it, winning the National League East, beating the favored Dodgers in a fifth and deciding road game in the divisional playoffs, and then sweeping the favored Cubs 4-0 to land their first World Series berth since 1986. New York faces the Kansas City Royals starting Tuesday in K.C. \"We certainly got hot right at the right time. It's been unbelievable,\" Tanous said. \"It's a joy. You wake up in the morning and ask what's the game tonight. Now there's only two teams left. I've been on the other end before, where Oct. 3, the season's done.\" A Case High graduate and a resident of Barrington, R.I., Tanous has been director amateur scouting since 2012. In his first year with the Mets, he was a special assignment scout, involved in evaluating both pro and amateur players. Tanous said he's not indifferent to seeing players he has scouted and signed get traded, but scouts can't let that part of the business tear their hearts out. \"It hurts to see them go, but in the end all that matters is what happened on the big league club,\" he said. And Tanous can look at the Mets' roster and see where some of his boys have contributed. Kevin Plawecki, a 2012 draft choice, got the call-up in April when starting catcher Travis d'Arnaud was injured and the rookie caught 73 games with a top-notch pitching staff. He remains on the playoff roster. Tanous drafted current starting left fielder left fielder Michael Conforto. And when starting shortstop Ruben Tejada suffered a broken leg in Game 2 aganst the Dodgers, the Mets brought up 2012 draft choice Matt Reynolds. \"You feel incredible,\" Tanous said. \"You feel proud of what you and your staff have done.\" What the scouting staff can largely do now is watch. Tanous has attended a bunch of home games at Citi Field, where he has an office. He sometimes is accompanied by four of the biggest Mets fans in New England, his wife Beth, a Providence attorney, and sons Sam, 14, Gabe, 10, and Luke, 8. Page 2 of 2 - Tommy may be the least hearty of the Tanous crew. During Game 2 against the Cubs, a cold night, Tanous told his wife they could go to his office to watch the rest of the game but she insisted they stay in their outdoor seats in the Pepsi Porch area. For Mets road games, the clan gathers in front of the television at the Barrington home where, Tanous said, there is a dog pile on the couch after each win. Luke Tanous is an especially big fan of pitcher Jeurys Familia. When the Mets' closer comes into the game, Luke, his dad noted, can be counted on to say, \"There's something very familiar about this guy.\" Email Greg Sullivan at gsullivan@heraldnews.com.
