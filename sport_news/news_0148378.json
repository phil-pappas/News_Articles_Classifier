But according to Brees himself, who is dealing with a shoulder injury, there's no way he's not suiting up Sunday night.\n\nThe latest from SportsLine Power Ratings: Are the Falcons for real? \n\nOn Thursday, Brees appeared on Ellen and when host Ellen DeGeneres asked Brees if he was going to play on Sunday, Brees confirmed that he is, in fact, planning on playing.\n\"Yeah, I do. I'm very confident I will be able to,\" Brees said . \"I practiced today. I feel good. So we'll see how it progresses. But there's not anything that's going to keep me off the field this Sunday.\"\nBrees injured his shoulder during the Saints ' Week 2 loss to the Buccaneers and didn't play against the Panthers this past Sunday. Without Brees, long-time backup Luke McCown has taken over quarterback duties.\nBut the Saints are quickly falling out of contention, losing their first three games of the season. On Sunday night, if Brees can play, the Saints should like their chances, as the Cowboys are also dealing with their own quarterback woes. The Saints are expected to face Brandon Weeden .\nAnd that means if Brees isn't good to go by Sunday, we'll be forced to watch McCown and Weeden duke it out on national television.\n\nDrew Brees likes his chances to play this Sunday.
