We’ve got a lot of money invested in ballplayers. The players themselves have tremendous playing opportunities in terms of what they can earn. And I think it’s important that we protect them.’’\nManfred began contemplating a rule change this summer, and it was reinforced in September after Pittsburgh Pirates infielder Jung Ho Kang suffered a broken leg when Chicago Cubs outfielder Chris Coghlan aggressively slid into him, breaking up a double play. And, of course, the incident Saturday night in Game 2 of the NL Division Series, when Los Angeles Dodgers second baseman Chase Utley was suspended two games for his slide that broke New York Mets shortstop Ruben Tejada’s leg.\nThe appeal hearing will be Monday in New York, Manfred said, although MLB tried to have the hearing much earlier.\n“We actually went in front of John McHale, the hearing officer,’’ Manfred said. “We argued for a hearing date (Tuesday) or (Wednesday). The union wanted longer time to get ready and John decided that he would give them until Monday in order to get ready.\n“Look we have a process and the process has worked pretty well in terms of handling these sorts of disputes so we’ll be ready to go on Monday.’’\nManfred hopes that in the next collective bargaining agreement there will be a provision that expedites the appeal process in the postseason.\n“We haven’t had a suspension in the postseason for a very long time,’’ Manfred said. “I think what this current situation has brought to light is that we may have a little difficult scheduling issue that a little shorter frame time would help us. And I’m sure that will be a topic that we’ll talk to the MLBPA about the next time we’re around them.’’\nAnd once Utley’s hearing is complete, Manfred said, he hopes they can start negotiating an agreement on the slide rule.\nI think it’s a natural follow-up to the home-plate change,’’ Manfred said. . You know, we had the situation in Pittsburgh with the player there that, again, sort of brings it into focus how damaging it can be to a club and obviously to the player.\n“The sentiment we’re getting from clubs is, a change in this area makes sense and that it’s important to protect what are very valuable assets.’’\nYet, he realizes it will be difficult, particularly after coming up with the home-plate collision rule that prohibits baserunners from deliberately running over catchers.\n“I hate to admit this,’’ Manfred said, “but I think the way we had to work through the home-plate situation gives you a feel for how difficult it is to write that kind of rule, that involves in-game action and an important part of the game.\n“This is one where, obviously, we’re going to be having a lot of conversations with the union about it. And making predictions about how those conversations go, and how it will be rolled out, I think is a bad idea for me. This is a topic we’re interested in and we want to talk about.’’\nMajor League Baseball still is discussing expanding the netting at ballparks to protect fans, but has yet to produce a resolution.\n“We are engaged in really detailed examination of 30 different ballparks and how they are laid out,’’ Manfred said, “where balls are going into the stands, where bats are going into the stands, what we would have to do from a netting perspective in order for it to be effective.\n“We’re looking at the different materials that are available for netting. I know this sounds crazy but there have been real advances in netting and how you see through it. The biggest challenge for us is that our ballparks are really different.’’\nThe netting issue will be fully discussed at the November owners' meetings in Dallas.\n“The netting issue is not a one-sided issue,’’ Manfred said. “There’s a big issue on one side, which is fan safety. It’s paramount for us. On the other side of it is, you’re changing the ballpark experience. And it’s not that you want to pick one over the other, but you want to find a way to balance the two that’s appropriate.\"\nManfred also said that there is no consideration on adjusting the playoff format after the St. Louis Cardinals, Pittsburgh Pirates and Chicago Cubs finished with the three best records, but are playing one another, assuring only one NL Central team reached the NLCS.\n“I am really comfortable with the playoff format that we have now,’’ Manfred said. “It is an unusual circumstance to have three teams like the three teams in the National League Central to be as good as they were, to win as many games as they did. I understand why people are asking the question. Having said that I think it is a mistake to rethink the playoff format based on what we’ve seen this year.’’\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.usatoday.com/sports/", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T10:47:39.139+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
