Chinese stock markets were also up, extending Thursday’s 3% gains. The blue-chip CSI300 index finished the day 1.3% higher while the Shanghai Composite Index rose 1.2%.\nIn London, the FTSE 100 has climbed 45 points, or 0.7%, to 6240.75 within the first five minutes of trading.\nFacebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 7.53am BST 07:53\nGood morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business.\nWall Street and Asian shares rallied overnight as the minutes of the last US Federal Reserve meeting suggested an imminent interest rate hike was unlikely. European stock markets are set to open higher, with gains of 0.9% predicted for Britain’s FTSE 100 index, 1.4% for Germany’s Dax and France’s CAC 1.3%.\nThe minutes of the Fed’s 16-17 September meeting showed the US central bank thought the strengthening American economy warranted a rate hike soon, but was concerned that inflation could get stuck at low levels. Policymakers concluded that it was “prudent to wait” for more evidence, amid growing fears over the global economic slowdown.\nThe minutes said:\nAfter assessing the outlook for economic activity, the labor market, and inflation and weighing the uncertainties associated with the outlook, all but one member concluded that, although the U.S. economy had strengthened and labor underutilization had diminished, economic conditions did not warrant an increase in the target range for the federal funds rate at this meeting.\nIn part because of the risks to the outlook for economic activity and inflation, the committee decided that it was prudent to wait for additional information confirming that the economic outlook had not deteriorated and bolstering members’ confidence that inflation would gradually move up toward 2 percent over the medium term.”\nLondon Capital Group said in a note:\nEuropean equities are set to rally as central banks give into the bulls’ demands for dovish monetary policy to rescue them from their current plight. The Fed Minutes underlined the global economic slowdown and the potential to threaten the US economic outlook.”\nUpdated at 7.59am BST\nFacebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F4d688%2Fsgp&amp;hl=en-GB&amp;wwc=1", "https://www.facebook.com/dialog/share?app_id=180444840287&href=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F4d688%2Fsfb%23block-56176617e4b01bef45f1aee3&redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F4d688", "https://www.facebook.com/dialog/share?app_id=180444840287&href=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F4d688%2Fsfb%23block-56175de2e4b01bef45f1aed7&redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F4d688", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Stocks%20rally%20as%20Fed%20minutes%20suggest%20no%20rush%20to%20raise%20US%20rates%20-%20live&url=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F4d688%2Fstw%23block-56175de2e4b01bef45f1aed7", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F4d688%2Fsgp%23block-56175de2e4b01bef45f1aed7&amp;hl=en-GB&amp;wwc=1", "http://www.pinterest.com/pin/find/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fbusiness%2Flive%2F2015%2Foct%2F09%2Fstocks-rally-as-fed-minutes-suggest-no-rush-to-raise-us-rates-live", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&title=Stocks+rally+as+Fed+minutes+suggest+no+rush+to+raise+US+rates+-+live&url=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F4d688", "http://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Stocks%20rally%20as%20Fed%20minutes%20suggest%20no%20rush%20to%20raise%20US%20rates%20-%20live&url=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F4d688%2Fstw%23block-56176617e4b01bef45f1aee3", "https://www.facebook.com/dialog/share?app_id=180444840287&href=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F4d688%2Fsfb&redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F4d688", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Stocks%20rally%20as%20Fed%20minutes%20suggest%20no%20rush%20to%20raise%20US%20rates%20-%20live&url=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F4d688%2Fstw", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Fgu.com%2Fp%2F4d688%2Fsgp%23block-56176617e4b01bef45f1aee3&amp;hl=en-GB&amp;wwc=1"], "published": "2015-10-09T16:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T10:12:13.763+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
