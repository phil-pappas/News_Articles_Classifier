The Bruins had beaten the Thrashers and Jets 13 consecutive times in Boston.\n Ondrej Pavelec made 29 saves for the Jets. Mark Scheifele, Blake Wheeler and Drew Stafford scored in the second period to give the Jets a 3-1 lead.\nDavid Pastrnak stickhandled along the left side before wristing it past Pavelec to make it 3-2 early in the third. But less than four minutes later, Thorburn sneaked through the defense and put a bouncing puck past Rask to make it 4-2.\nDavid Krejci also scored for Boston, and Tuukka Rask made 26 saves.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T05:35:14.895+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
