We could have easily gone south, but these boys came together as a team and a game like this is a testament to their character.” \nIt didn’t look pretty in the beginning for Unioto as it fumbled the opening kickoff and Piketon recovered. However, the Sherman defense forced a turnover on downs after a Piketon incompletion. \nFrom there, the Shermans marched down the field and Clay Edler found Erique Hosley for the two-yard touchdown pass, capping off an 11-play, 67-yard drive that gave them a 7-0 lead with 6:30 left in the first. \nUnioto looked to add another score before the first quarter ended, however, Edler’s pass was picked off in the end zone and returned to the 24-yard line. Piketon would ultimately cash in on the turnover as Devon Brewster found Gabe Birkhimer on fourth down for the three-yard score. Brewster would find Matt Carrico for the two-point conversion, giving Piketon the lead 8-7 with 10:06 to play in the first half. \nUnioto responded on the following drive as Edler, on third and 23, scrambled out of the pocket to extend the play and find senior J.T. Turner for a 38-yard touchdown pass. Following a successful point after attempt, Unioto regained the lead 14-8 with 7:30 left in the half. \nPiketon had an answer back on the following drive. Devon Brewster capped off a seven-play, 71-yard drive by calling his own number from one-yard out for the touchdown. The two-point try was no good, tying the game 14-14. \nThe Shermans had the final say in the quarter, as Edler dropped back to throw, tucked it down and out ran the Piketon defense for a 68-yard touchdown run to put Unioto ahead 21-14 with 4:20 left in the half. \n“He really made some big plays when we needed him to,” Metzler said. “That run was so huge. We needed a boost and he gave us that and more.” \n“I know I’m not the fasest guy in the world,” Edler said. “But it’s all about heart and effort and you just have to keep your legs moving. All credit goes to the guys up front for creating those holes for me to run through. We had two new guys step up who haven’t played on the line all season and they did an incredible job tonight. I haven’t been hit very much this season and that’s credit to all the guys around me for making me look good on the field.” \nThe Shermans tried to push their lead before the half, but Edler was picked off by Riley Harris, who took the ball all the way back to the Unioto 18-yard line. Piketon couldn’t capitalize and went into the break down a score. \nAfter the break, not much action was seen. Both teams drove up and down the field, but penalties halted their respective drives, resulting in a scoreless third quarter. \nUnioto controled the ball for the majority of the fourth and proceeded to melt some clock before Edler found the end zone for the his second rushing touchdown of the game, this one from three yards out, pushing the lead to 28-14 with 5:50 still to play. \nHowever, Piketon responded in a matter of seconds. Following the kick off, Brewster hit Birkhimer streaking down the middle of the field for his second receiving score of the game, this one from 55 yards. Brewster found Travis Veach for the two-point conversion, making the score 28-22. \nPiketon would end up forcing Unioto to punt and the ball would be downed at the one-yard line with 2:17 remaining in the game. \nThe Sherman defense came through as they would bat down Brewster’s fourth down throw to end the game and preserve the win. \nEdler led the Shermans passing for 219 yards with two touchdowns and two intercepts. He also tacked on 16 rushes for 145 yards and two scores on the ground. Turner, on his final game at home, had a career night hauling in eight catches for 132 yards and a touchdown. \nBrewster led the Redstreaks, going 19-of-34 passing for 257 yards and two touchdowns. He added 12 rushes for 43 yards with a touchdown. Gabe Birkhimer had six catches for 75 yards and two touchdowns. Matt Smith had 10 rushes for 86 yards. \nUnioto will wrap up its season Friday when they travel to Adena. \nPiketon will host Paint Valley on Friday.
