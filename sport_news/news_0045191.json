The two started their official partnership in 2012 when Rodgers was first featured as Prevea's voice of wellness.\n\"Our partnership with Aaron and the way we care for patients is truly unique in the health care industry,\" said Ashok Rai , MD, Prevea Health President and CEO. \"Instead of paying actors to tell people what we will do to them once they're already sick, we have this incredible opportunity to partner with a sports star in a campaign designed to improve wellness. Prevea offers some of the area's most advanced specialties to care for the sickest of patients when they need us, but Aaron shares our overall belief that the community is best served when we focus our communications on increasing our area's overall quality of life.\"\nNow in their fourth year of working together, Rodgers and Prevea recently produced and launched a new campaign focused on helping people get ahead of their own wellness by mapping out their health plan. The communications encourage viewers to visualize \"healthy\" as a destination – a great place to be.\n\"A big part of why I love our partnership is that people see how much Prevea cares about them,\" said Rodgers. \"Prevea is changing the way people look at health care, and I'm happy to be part of that process. I hope that I'm able to give back in a way that players in Green Bay have done before me. As a veteran in the league, I feel it's my responsibility to pass on knowledge.\"\n\"Health is paramount to Aaron's success, which makes this partnership with Prevea so authentic,\" said Rodgers' marketing agent Mark Steinberg , partner, Excel Sports Management. \"Both are pillars in Wisconsin , and together they will continue to champion the well-being of the community.\"\nClick here to watch \"Get There\" and click here to watch \"What's It Mean\" – Rodgers' latest commercials with Prevea.
