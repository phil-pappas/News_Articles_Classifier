Since we’d all seen the Dodgers and Kershaw fail in similar situations before, I figured why believe anything will be different until given a reason to believe.\nIt’s the same logic I applied in May to the Ducks’ Game 7 against the Chicago Blackhawks in the NHL’s Western Conference finals.\nThe Ducks then went out, fell behind 4-0 barely halfway through the game and made me look like a genius for having the ability to forecast something so obvious Pat Haden wouldn’t have missed it.\nThen again, I’m something of a hockey expert, knowing the sport well enough to understand Barry Melrose must be taken seriously, even if his hair appears to be the discarded pelt of a weasel.\nKershaw, though, boldly and impressively made new history Tuesday, producing seven brilliant innings as the Dodgers stretched this National League Division Series to its limit with a 3-1 victory.\nTalk about providing a reason to believe! Maybe, before the start of the 2016 Stanley Cup playoffs, the Ducks should sign Kershaw. I have no idea if he can even stand up on skates, but, honestly, he couldn’t be any worse than the Ducks have been when facing elimination, right?\nI’d like to tell you I have an undeniable grasp on what will happen Thursday, a very clear vision of which team will advance to the NL Championship Series to face the Chicago Cubs.\nBut, before the season began, I had the Cubs finishing fourth in their division, my prediction of a Cardinals-Red Sox World Series also now unlikely to occur without the intervention of baseball-loving space aliens.\nBack in April, we asked six of our staff members to forecast this season. I’m not interested in embarrassing any specific individuals here, but I will mention that none of us had the Mets even making the playoffs.\nBaseball, with its randomness and oddities and volatility – and that’s just in the Dodgers’ bullpen – can be an almost impossible sport to predict. I sincerely believe this newspaper, in seeking preseason wisdom, would have been justified in polling six chickens.\nIn a more blunt assessment, each one of us had the eventual AL West-champion Texas Rangers finishing last in the division.\nOne of us had Kansas City, the team that ended up with the AL’s best record, last in the Central, too. Again, I’m not interested in embarrassing any specific individuals here, so I won’t mention that it was Pedro Moura or that he can be mocked directly at pmoura@ocregister.com.\nThe Dodgers are favored in Game 5, which speaks to their starting pitcher, Zack Greinke, and their standing as the home team.\nBut they were favored in Game 1 at Dodger Stadium, as well, and that didn’t stop the Mets’ Jacob deGrom from outpitching Kershaw and making the Dodger hitters look like baffled game show contestants.\nHeck, Pat Sajak is routinely spotted at Dodger Stadium and maybe now we know why, his presence Thursday perhaps, for the home team, representing a wheel of misfortune.\nOf particular note in Game 1, Carl Crawford appeared to have no chance against deGrom, which actually was better than Adrian Gonzalez, who, versus the New York righty, worked three of the emptiest full counts in baseball history, each ending in a strikeout.\nI’m tempted to pick the Dodgers, sure, figuring the people in Las Vegas establishing the odds for sporting events know this stuff pretty well. Or at least well enough to retain the majority of their fingers. How else could they keep typing?\nYet, I can’t get past the image of deGrom, his fastball exploding toward home plate amid all that hair erupting from beneath his cap, fooling Andre Ethier into a Game 1 swing that was halfhearted but fully pathetic.\nSo, I’m going to go with the Mets, in a tight game decided in the final two innings. Possible New York Post headline: “Chase Chased; Fracture This, Utley!”\nI’m going to go with the Mets against the Cubs in an NLCS that will be immediately preceded by a million questions – and only one answer – about Mattingly’s future.\nFrankly, I feel awfully good about this prediction, almost as certain as I once was about the Cardinals beating the Red Sox in a World Series matchup that will never happen.\nContact the writer: jmiller@ocregister.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T06:26:12.380+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
