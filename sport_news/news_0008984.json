A well-timed pass from senior defender Scott Sherin to Kasperowicz, who one-timed it into the net from 10 yards away, pulled Wayne Valley into a 1-1 tie with 27:21 to go in the second half. Then Peter Leva, a senior midfielder, assisted on Kasperowicz’ goal that put the Indians, 2-1, with 22:05 remaining. \nThat’s the way it looked like it would wind up until fifth-seeded Clifton (10-4), which had a seven-game winning streak snapped, began applying intense pressure in the final 10 minutes. The constant flurries in the offensive zone paid off when sophomore defender Carlos Mesa rebounded in a 5-footer inside the circle to knot it at 2-2 with 2:48 remaining. \nWayne Valley then got a couple of good chances early in the overtime and looked to have won it on a chip from 12 feet away by Minnella with 6:48 to play in the first 10-minute sudden death overtime. But the goal was waved off for a foul inside the box called by the linesman, keeping the score at 2-2. \nHowever, with 3:15 remaining in the initial extra session, Kasperowicz ended the suspense with his game-winning effort off an assist by senior midfielder and co-captain Stas Lembryk. Lembryk, who had been superb all day with accurate long throw-ins, again employed his signature long pass from out of bounds. The ball went into the box, and Kasperowicz was able to run to it and score. \n“We have 14 seniors on this team and we want to extend this run as long as we can,” said an elated Kasperowicz. “This is one we’ll remember for awhile.” Clifton had defeated Wayne Valley, 2-1, in double overtime Oct. 8 in a Big North interdivisional game, setting the stage for the big overtime victory by the Indians on Saturday. \nHAWTHORNE CHRISTIAN 5, WAYNE HILLS 1 : Senior forward Rene White scored three goals and had an assist to lead the second-seeded Defenders (12-2) past the sixth-seeded Patriots (9-4) in the other semifinal. Hawthorne Christian thus qualified for its first Passaic County championship in any sport — boys or girls — and will take on Wayne Valley for the title on Saturday at Clifton Stadium at noon. \nWhite scored a goal with 1:05 to play in the first half off an assist from David Falcon to tie the score at 1. He scored with 27:28 remaining in the second half to give the Defenders the lead for good at 2-1 off an assist from Frank Generoso. Generoso had a goal and an assist, and David Falcon had two assists for Hawthorne Christian. \nEmail: mills@northjersey.com  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T07:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T16:11:01.854+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
