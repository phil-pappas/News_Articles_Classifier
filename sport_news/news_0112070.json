(Joe Hermitt / Associated Press) Daniel Gallen Contact Reporter Penn State beat writer @audsnyder4 answers a few questions about Saturday's Maryland-Penn State matchup. \nAudrey Snyder is the Penn State football beat writer for the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. With Maryland set to face Penn State this weekend at M&T Bank Stadium in Baltimore, she was kind enough to chat on the phone for a while about the upcoming matchup and answer some questions about the Nittany Lions. \nWith everything that happened last year and with all the recruiting/divisional implications surrounding this game, do you have a sense of how the team is approaching this game or how it feels about it? \nYou need to look extra good in games like this when you’re in this area. Kids in Maryland want to see that Penn State looks like a legitimate 5-2 game — even though if they’ve watched any of their games, they would see that’s not the case. … [Recruiting Maryland has] been a big part of their footprint here for years, and you’ve got to do a good job to recruit that area and show that you can develop the talent you had. This will be their second NFL stadium this year. Penn State played Temple at Lincoln Financial Field in Philadelphia in the season opener. They also played in MetLife Stadium two years ago when they opened up the season against Syracuse. \nPenn State is 5-2 this season, but it doesn’t really feel like it. What are some of the issues with this team? \nThe offense is the main issue right now, but the other stuff from the outside that probably goes under the radar, Penn state’s special teams, specifically punting, has been pretty bad. They started the Ohio State game with one punter and went back to another punter. These guys aren’t getting great hang time. You have an offense that can’t move the ball and then you have a special teams unit that can’t pin guys deep. They’re losing the field position battle. You’ve got two kids punting who walked on because when they had the sanctions they didn’t want to use one of their coveted scholarships on a punter. The special teams have been a problem.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T19:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T11:22:13.602+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
