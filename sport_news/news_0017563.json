By Jocelyn Sheets Newton Daily News \nGRINNELL — Rachel Rhoads has had a strong first season running in the high school cross country ranks. The Newton High freshman earned all-conference honors placing fifth in Monday’s 2015 Little Hawkeye Conference meet. \nRhoads ran the varsity girls’ 5K course at Grinnell’s Ahrens Park in 20 minutes, 13 seconds for fifth place. The top 15 finishers in the varsity races earn All-LHC honors. \n“Rachel really went for it today and fought hard. She held on to second place for a long time,” Newton girls’ head coach Rachelle Tipton said. \n“To get fifth as a freshman, with that tenacity, is very promising for her conference and overall career. Overall, this was a great meet. The girls pushed through the wind and competed well.” \nBoth the girls’ and boys’ team championship were decided by one point. Pella’s boys and girls were trying to defend their team titles. They didn’t. A pair of sophomores won the conference individual championships. \nIn the girls’ division, Dallas Center-Grimes edged out Pella, 46-47, to win the LHC championship title. Oskaloosa was third with 79 followed by Grinnell with 72 points. Newton’s Cardinal girls finished fifth as a team with 118 points. Norwalk placed sixth with 158 points and Pella Christian was seventh with 184 points. \nFor the boys’ competition, Grinnell claimed the team title with 40 points with Dallas Center-Grimes in second with 41 points. Pella finished third with 47 followed by Oskaloosa with 103, Norwalk with 160 and Pella Christian with 167. Newton’s boys were seventh with 180 points. \nDCG sophomore Lexi Smith is the LHC girls’ champion, running the race in a winning time of 19:11. Sophomore Thomas Clower of Grinnell won the boys’ title in 16:30. \nNewton sophomore Tessa Keeton posted a personal-best time of 22:09 for 24th to lead at three-runner pack by the Cardinals. Freshmen Caelyn Briley and Abbie Barr were 25th and 26th, respectively, in 22:18 and 22:25. \nJunior Ellie Horn took 38th in 25:57, and junior Michaella Cope ran a personal-best 25:12 for 45th. Senior Grace Coen, who was a two-time LHC meet champion, did not run to defend her individual championship. \n“Tessa returned to run a terrific race, she got out well and led in our pack. These girls, and Ellie, keep giving their best and turning in solid races,” Tipton said. “Michaella had another outstanding race. She’s been battling some soreness this season, but keeps coming back strong. All of the girls in the junior varsity race ran lights out.” \nJunior Katherine Thorpe was 30th in the junior varsity race in 24:48 with sophomore Rylie Bakalar in 44th in 26:25. Jordyn Soule, a junior, placed 51st in 27:04 and senior Annie Hurt ran 66th in 29:35. All four had personal-best times for the 5K race. \n“We get Katherine, Rylie, and Jordyn back next season, and look forward to full seasons from Rylie and Jordyn,” Tipton said. “Annie finished her cross country career tonight in grand fashion. She joined last year, but battled an injury for most of it, and then had a new distance this season. She is a hard working athlete and a great leader on the team. If that isn’t enough to show how much she will be missed on the team, the tears from teammates at the finish line do.” \nThe Cardinal boys were led by sophomore Jack Callaghan, who finished the 5K in 17:53 for 20th. Sophomore Bradley Portner was 37th in 19:05, just ahead of junior Noah Sander, 19:23, in 38th. \nFreshman Adam Hunter placed 41st in 20:01 followed by sophomores Dylan Main and Ross Hull in 44th and 45th, respectively, in 20:35 and 20:58. \nNewton seniors Zach Theis and Chase Dykstra ran in their final Little Hawkeye Conference meet. Theis finished 47th in the varsity race in 21:12. Dykstra led the NHS junior varsity runners, taking 63rd in 20:47. Also in the junior varsity race for NHS were freshman Larkin Christy in 82nd at 22:16, sophomore Blake Robson in 97th at 23:06 and junior Spencer Elbert in 99th at 23:27. \nThe Newton varsities prepare for the Class 3A state qualifying meet Oct. 22 at the Iowa State cross country course in Ames. \nNewton’s middle school cross country teams ran Monday in Grinnell.
