Monday changed that. \nMike Abdalla's goal with a minute to play in the first half broke a tie and goalkeeper Matt Tibbetts made 10 saves as the Millionaires knocked off North Division-leading Pittsfield, 3-1. \n\"I asked the players before this game started 'Do you believe you can win this game?' I told them if you didn't, then we need to go home right now,\" Lenox coach Dave Pugh said. \"They responded with 'Coach, we can win this.' \n\"They came out from the very start and they played that way.\" \nTibbetts had a quality game between the pipes for the Millionaires (8-3-1, 2-3 in the North). He made 10 saves, and the only goal scored by Pittsfield deflected off a Lenox defender while the Millionaires were trying to clear a ball out of the box. \n\"This is great. This is a great win,\" said the goalkeeper. \"PHS is a great school. They're really highly ranked in D-I. This will really motivate us for the rest of the year.\" \nNic Baruch scored an insurance tally for the Millionaires, who will face Pittsfield again a week from yesterday. \nThe win was costly for Lenox as Lenox's Matt Heim, who tied the game on a first-half penalty kick, injured an ankle in the second half. Heim may miss Thursday's game with Westfield Technical, the former Westfield Voke. Advertisement \nAfter opening the 2015 season perfectly, the Generals (8-2, 3-1) have lost two straight games. There may still be plenty of time for head coach Andrew Antil's team to right the ship, but that didn't make the outcome any less disappointing for the PHS coach. \n\"I think that all together, we didn't show up for 80 minutes. We had a couple of good rushes here and there,\" said Antil. \"They went to the ball. They went to the ball as a team and we didn't.\" \nThe scoreless tie turned into a 1-0 Pittsfield lead when the Lenox defense couldn't clear the ball out of the box in front of Tibbetts. The ball deflected off a Millionaire defender and Tibbetts had no chance to stop it. \nSeven minutes later, Lenox's Luke Murphy crossed the ball to Joe Bouvier. Bouvier passed to Heim, whose shot was deflected inside the box by a defender's hands. Heim was awarded a penalty kick and shot low to the right corner, beating PHS keeper Jon Bile. \nThe Generals stormed right back but Tibbetts made a kick save on a shot by Pittsfield's Louis Higuera. \nThen at the 38:53 mark of the half, Zi Santos came down the right side, crossed the ball and Abdalla finished to make it 2-1. It gave the Millionaires some momentum at the break. \n\"It did, because we came out strong in the second half,\" said Abdalla. \"That goal set us up for success.\" \nBaruch's insurance goal came on a shot from the top of the box that curled away from Bile and into the net between the keeper and the left post. \n\"We've wanted a game like this because, No. 1, we felt we could win a game like this,\" said Pugh. \"But, two, to win a game like this, it cements in our players heads that they are good players and we are a solid team.\" \n———", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T06:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T14:41:18.688+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
