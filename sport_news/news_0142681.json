These orders were passed by a special bench of the NGT yesterday in Shimla while hearing a petition filed by Baljeet Singh Bhateria, a resident of Palampur. Bhateria, in his petition, told the NGT that there was a complete ban on the mining and quarrying activities in the Neugal river and other tributaries of the Beas. But, still a large scale of illegal mining and quarrying was going on unchecked in Palampur region. In his petition, Bhateria stated that illegal mining activities had also posed a serious threat to various irrigation and drinking water supply schemes of the Irrigation and Public Health (IPH) Department, which get water from the Neugal river. The petitioner also told the court that he had brought the matter to the notice of the state Forest and Mining Department and requested to stop illegal mining, dismantle the roads constructed by the mining mafia to the reach the river bed and impound vehicles involved in the mining activities, but to no avail. He requested the NGT to intervene in the matter. After hearing the petitioner, the court directed the state government, particularly the state Forest and Mining Department, to file a status report before the NGT bench to be held in Shimla on December 5. The People’s Voice had been fighting for the past two years against illegal mining. KB Ralhan and Daleep Sharma said People’s Voice would approach the NGT on the issue soon.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T00:12:55.955+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
