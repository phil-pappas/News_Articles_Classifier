But why? To me, his legacy is simple. It comes down to one word —\"fun.\" And this is how he should be remembered. \nHe made football a blast for everybody involved: The players who played for him; the fans who rooted for him; the media who covered him; the TV audience who watched him. \nMore than any other coach, the Spur-Dog is responsible for college football and the SEC becoming the TV cash cow it has become today. Spurrier's arrival at UF in 1990 coincided with college football exploding on television. And Spurrier was the fuse. \nGator Nation adored him; everyone else abhorred him. His \"enemies\" mocked him with nicknames like \"Steve Superior\" or \"Stevie Wonder\" or \"The Mouth of the South\" or \"Darth Visor.\" His supreme confidence in a fraternity filled with cliché-spewing, cookie-cutter coaches amped up rival SEC stadiums to ear-splitting, tobacco-spitting levels. His pizzazz and panache; his color and candor made him a rock star in a profession filled with lounge singers. He was a young, charismatic Elvis; everyone else was Burl Ives. \nHe surprised us by quoting Sun Tzu and Attila the Hun; he shocked us by benching Heisman-contending quarterback Terry Dean and replacing him with freshman Danny Wuerffel. His emotional sideline antics and epic visor tosses became SportsCenter staples. His quips and cracks about his opponents —\"Free Shoes University\" and \"You can't spell Citrus with UT\"— made us laugh. And his offenses — his amazing, wide-open, \"we don't need a good punter cuz we don't plan on punting much\" offenses — made us marvel. \nSpurrier didn't coach like, act like or talk like anybody else in the profession. He was the opposite of Bear Bryant, the only SEC coach with more victories than him. The Bear once said, \"I ain't never had much fun. I ain't never been two inches away from a football. Other guys go fishing or hunting or golfing, and all I want to do is be alone, studying how not to lose.\" \nFor some reason, I just can't picture the Bear soaking up the sun, suds and surf on the weekend before a big game against Auburn. But Oklahoma coach Bob Stoops has often told the story about when he was Spurrier's young defensive coordinator at UF two decades ago. It was an open weekend before the mega-matchup against Tennessee, and Spurrier and Stoops were frolicking in the waves at the HBC's favorite place in the world — Crescent Beach. \n\"Stoopsy, you think those Tennessee boys are body-surfing right now?\" Spurrier said gleefully. \nTwo years ago on the weekend before South Carolina came down to play UCF in Orlando, Spurrier again was at Crescent Beach with his wife and family. When I reached him on the phone and asked him what he was doing, he replied with a chuckle: \"Me and my grandkids are going to take the boogie boards out and catch some waves.\" \nBut, sadly, it was another game against UCF earlier this season when Spurrier first started to sense it. When his Gamecocks trailed the winless Knights 14-8 at halftime, Spurrier admitted during his farewell news conference that he knew his team and his time were done. \nEven his final act as coach on Tuesday was refreshingly different than that of his peers. I've heard critics say Spurrier \"quit\" on his team by resigning midseason, but I say he's actually helping his program. Spurrier, who called himself a \"recruiting liability\" on Tuesday, is doing South Carolina a favor by not hanging on until the bitter end. He doesn't want airplanes flying over the stadium with \"Fire Spurrier\" banners; fans calling for his ouster on message boards; recruits flocking to rival schools. \nHe's always taken great pride in the fact he's never been fired as a head coach, and he never wanted to get forced out like his old rivals Bobby Bowden and Phil Fulmer. He wanted to walk out the door, not get shoved through it. \n\"It's time for me to get out of the way and give somebody else a go at it,\" Spurrier said Tuesday. \nAdded his daughter Amy Moody as she fought back tears: \"There's no exit strategy in coaching. You either get fired or you have a heart attack. My dad didn't want to go out like that.\" \nInstead, he goes out like this. \nFun and done. \nA national treasure riding his golf cart into the sunset at Crescent Beach. \nBye, bye, Mr. American Pie. \nIs this the day the music died? \nOr can you still hear Lee Ann coming from the car speakers of the coach who taught us to get out there on that floor and boogie your butt off. \n\" Don't let some hell bent heart leave you bitter, \nWhen you come close to sellin' out reconsider, \nGive the heavens above more than just a passing glance, \nAnd when you get the choice to sit it out or dance. \nI hope you dance. \nI hope you dance.\" \nmbianchi@tribune.com.
