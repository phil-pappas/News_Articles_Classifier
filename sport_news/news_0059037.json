Gonzalez and Diskerud were dropped based on form. \nOthers from the 35-man preliminary roster who were dropped were goalkeeper Bill Hamid; defender Greg Garza; midfielders Joe Corona, Alfredo Morales and Lee Nguyen; and forwards Alan Gordon, Aron Johannsson, Jordan Morris and Bobby Wood. \nGarza and Johannsson also are injured. Morris is with the U.S. Under-23 team at Olympic qualifying. \nDefenders Fabian Johnson and DaMarcus Beasley have returned from injuries that caused them to miss a pair of September exhibitions and could start at outside back. Timmy Chandler, another outside back, was left off the 35-man roster because of an injury. \nKlinsmann hinted some of the veterans on the roster for the game at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California, may not be around for the Confederations Cup. Among the players 32 or older are Clint Dempsey, DaMarcus Beasley, Jermaine Jones, Kyle Beckerman and Chris Wondolowski.
