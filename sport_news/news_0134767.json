The Dodgers have yet to announce their starting rotation for the series, but the Mets will most likely have the unenviable task of going up against two National League Cy Young contenders: Clayton Kershaw and Zack Greinke. \nKershaw became the first major league pitcher in 13 years to record 300 strikeouts in a single season after whiffing seven San Diego Padres batters in just 3.1 innings in his final regular-season start on Sunday. The 27-year-old lefty finished his campaign 16-7 with a 2.13 ERA, 0.88 WHIP and 301 strikeouts. \nAs impressive as those numbers are, the right-handed Greinke has just as good -- if not better -- than Kershaw. Greinke, who started for the National League in the 2015 All-Star Game in Cincinnati, ends the regular season 19-3 with a major-league best 1.66 ERA and a 0.84 WHIP. \nPLUS : Everything you need to know as Mets begin preparing for Dodgers \nFacing Kershaw and Greinke would be challenging under any circumstances, but the Mets will likely have to battle the duo in the shadows at Dodger Stadium, to boot. \nThe Mets will counter with their own stable of young power arms, but as David Wright pointed out on Sunday, no team in the majors currently has a better 1-2 punch than the Dodgers. \n\"I think as deep as we are with our pitching, I don't think anybody in baseball really has a Kershaw and Greinke,\" Wright said Sunday. \"We're going to throw out there some good arms against them, but when you look at the back of the baseball card of those two guys, that's about as good as it gets.\" \nWhile some hitters might try to work counts in an attempt to elevate an opposing pitcher's pitch count and expedite their exit from the game, Kershaw and Greinke throw far too many strikes to make that an effective approach, Wright said. \n\"If you want to start 0-2 that sounds like a good plan,\" Wright joked. \"I think that you can't go in with the game plan of trying to take as many pitches as possible because, again, you're not going to have much success. I think your best chance is just going up there being prepared.\" \nWith the potential for low-scoring games, Wright emphasized that the Mets will have to play solid defense and take advantage of every scoring opportunity that surfaces. \n\"We know offensively runs are going to be at a premium, so we have to do a nice job of not giving them extra outs,\" he said. \"Granted, we haven't exactly been lighting up the scoreboard lately, but we've shown that we're capable of winning games offensively. So just stick to the game plan and do what you're accustomed to, don't try to go up there and change anything.\" \nMaria Guardado may be reached at mguardado@njadvancemedia.com .
