It’s not really new to us anymore. We can always improve.” \nThe Firebirds (4-3, 1-0 in districts) switched to a “50” defense during the offseason, a change from their usual 3-5-3 base defense. \n“The goal of our ‘TNT’ up front — tackle, nose and tackle — is to protect the linebackers, keeping a certain gap free,” FSHS coach Bob Lisher said, “then not letting people free release to the linebackers so they can go over the top and get to where they need to be and strike. We’re getting better and better with that with our up-front people.” \nFree State’s biggest challenge will be stopping Manhattan’s dual-threat quarterback, Ian Trapp, a transfer from Ellsworth. Trapp has rushed for 968 yards and tossed for another 649 yards this season. \nThe Indians (4-3, 0-1) have lost their last two games, falling in overtime against rival Junction City and tumbling, 41-14, against Topeka High. \n“He has similar tendencies as the quarterback from Olathe North as being able to run and throw,” Lisher said of Trapp. “Our kids understand the fact that we had trouble tackling him a little bit. He’s a pretty good quarterback. Our emphasis is still playing our base defensive schemes with a few wrinkles but doing it better than we did last week.” \nTorneden said the defense “realized our potential” during Free State’s loss to Lawrence High on Sept. 18. \nWith the defensive linemen clogging running lanes, linebackers Sam Skwarlo, Jay Dineen, Drew Tochtrop, Paul Bittinger and Nathan Spain have blown up plays in the backfield. \n“The first couple of weeks took us awhile to get used to our new assignments and our new responsibilities,” Bittinger said. “I think our confidence is pretty good. Our linebackers do a great job of keeping the gaps closed.” \nFSHS probable starters \nOffense \nLT — Chase Houk, jr. LG — Jay Dineen, jr. C — Garrett Swisher, sr. RG — Sam Hambleton, jr.
