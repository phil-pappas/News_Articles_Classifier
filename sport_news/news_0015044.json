That led to ethnic and political violence.\nThe candidate who placed third in the first round of the 2010 election, Sidya Toure, on Monday also withdrew from the electoral process.\nIt was unclear if the politicians will remain removed once the results are given. Guinea's election commission said full provisional results have been postponed until Friday.\nDiallo's announcement comes after Guinea Justice Minister Cheick Sako called on Guineans, especially politicians, to refrain from inciting violence or undermining the country's laws, saying unrest will be punished by the law.\nInternational Criminal Court prosecutor Fatou Bensouda has said the court is following developments in Guinea closely to see if any unrest falls under its jurisdiction.\nViolence before the Oct. 11 presidential vote killed at least three people. There have been some reports of unrest outside the capital since the vote and after opposition leaders said they wouldn't recognize results because of allegations of voting fraud.\nThe government of Conde, who is favored to win the election in a second round, denied that there was fraud.\nGuinea has endured decades of corrupt dictatorship since independence from France in 1958. In 2008, after the longtime strongman died, a military coup led to tumultuous rule until the junta's leader agreed to go into exile.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T06:43:14.611+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
