Mostly new roster. \nSame ol' streak. \nSecond-ranked Addison swept Ranburne to clinch its 14th straight state tournament appearance and later topped No. 4 Ider in a tight three-setter to advance to the Class 2A North Super Regional championship match Saturday at the Von Braun Center. \nThe Bulldogs (46-13) are slated to face either third-ranked Falkville or Mars Hill Bible at 7:30 p.m. in the title tilt. They've already swept Falkville three times this season in area action. \nAddison moved one step closer to its fourth consecutive super regional crown with an easy 25-12, 25-11, 25-16 victory over Ranburne. \nIder proved to be a considerably tougher test, but the Bulldogs did just enough to pass, winning 25-23, 25-11, 25-22. \nSadie Brock brought the power with 19 kills and 11 digs between the two matches. Callie Brewer chimed in with 12 kills, 24 digs and two aces, while Abbie Chambless went beast mode at the net for 10 kills and 10 blocks. Taylor Erb tacked on nine kills, five aces and 14 digs. \nAnna Tuggle was good for eight kills, four aces and two blocks in the Ider match. Ragen Yarbrough put the perfect touch on 30 assists. \nA win Saturday night would hand Addison the North's top seed at next week's state tournament. The Dawgs would face the South's fourth seed at 12:30 p.m. Wednesday at the Birmingham CrossPlex. \nAddison is seeking its third state title in a row, second straight in 2A, eighth overall and first under Kayla Woodard. \nWoodard is in her first year atop the Bulldogs after spending two falls as an assistant for Pam Wilkins, whom she played for before enjoying a productive career at Mississippi State. \nCheck back to see how Addison fared in the super regional championship match. \n% Rob Ketcham can be reached at 256-734-2131, ext. 138 or at robk@cullmantimes.com.​ Sign Up / Sign In With your existing account from... {* loginWidget *}", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T01:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T03:02:28.081+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
