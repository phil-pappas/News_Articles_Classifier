These recent shifts in sound are seen on tracks such as “Moving Day,” “Falling,” “Night Drive” and “Blood Moon,” to name a few. Even though the new album deviates from the standard sludge and riffs the genre is mired in, Cope and Pleasants are not afraid to embrace change.\n“We know that coming into every album, there’s going to be somebody who’s not going to be sure about that change,” Cope said. “You can’t expect the whole world to change with you and with us, every record does come out slightly different.”\nPleasants backed this statement by adding, “We didn’t really have the whole debut album, where everyone went nuts over it: (our catalogue) has just been growing and growing.”\nAnd over the past year and a half, Kylesa has grown in leaps and bounds, adding bassist Chase Rudeseal and second drummer John Edwards to the lineup.\n“Chase and John are the best fit we’ve had in a while and we’ve really been able to hear it live,” Cope said, speaking on the revolving door the band seems to have with bassists and additional drummers. Pleasants jumped in, adding, “They’re definitely the hardest working.”\nKylesa embarked on a full U.S. tour starting Oct. 6. They will be making a special stop Oct. 9 at their hometown stage, The Jinx, with support from Inter Arma, Indian Handcrafts and Irata. Come watch a new chapter unfold for some of our favorite local rockers.\nIF YOU GO\nWhat: Kylesa with Inter Arma, Indian Handcrafts and Irata\nWhen: 9 p.m. Oct. 9\nWhere: The Jinx, 127 W.
