Just one team in major league history has ever come back from an 0–3 deficit in a best-of-seven series: the 2004 Red Sox . Those Red Sox and these Cubs have a few things in common—Theo Epstein, a first-year manager, an infamous championship drought—but shooting the moon is not an advisable strategy against a team as talented as this year’s Mets .\nMets at Cubs\nSeries: NLCS Game 3; Mets lead 2–0\nStart Time: 8:07 p.m. ET\nTV: TBS\nStarting Pitchers: Jacob deGrom (2–0, 1.38 ERA) vs. Kyle Hendricks (0–0, 5.79 ERA)\n• This battle of sophomore righthanders looks like a mismatch, but the Cubs have owned deGrom this season, beating him twice in two confrontations and scoring eight runs, seven earned, in 10 1/3 innings against him. Even more notably, both of those games came before Chicago added Kyle Schwarber to the lineup on a permanent bases and before Starlin Castro turned his season around with his move to second base. Coming off a Game 5 start in the Division Series in which he was clearly not sharp and now 25 1/3 innings past his previous career high, deGrom is hardly a sure thing heading into this game.\nMLB Video Behind but not discouraged, Cubs ready for uphill battle in rest of NLCS by Jon Tayler", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/cliffcorcoran"], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T05:12:31.265+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
