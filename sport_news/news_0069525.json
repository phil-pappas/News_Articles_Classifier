The $50 million President's Plaza was first proposed in 2006. It's to include a mix of residential, retail and hospitality space. It's been delayed by a strained relationship between City Hall and the developers. Allender on Monday announced a proposal to get the project moving again after more than a month of talks involving the mayor's office, City Council leaders and developers. The City Council will need to approve. Â© 2015 Associated Press. All rights reserved.
