This week, we worked on our red zone offense and once this quagmire came, we decided the best thing for us to do is get in our goal-line offense and put the ball in 22's (Aguero's) hands.\"\nThe rain came down hardest in the first half, slowing both teams. Hardin Valley's best possession of the opening quarter was its first chance with the ball.\nThe Hawks (4-3, 2-2 Region 1-6A) alternated carries between Tim Fizzell, Aguero and quarterback Mihir Barot. After slogging through the mud picking up a few yards at a time, Barot squirted loose on a keeper and charged down the seam for 59 yards. He was caught at the 10-yard line, but Aguero scored on a 2-yard run over the right tackle.\nWith less than two minutes left in the first quarter, Hardin Valley lost the ball and Jefferson County (3-4, 1-3) put together it's best drive of the half. The Patriots pushed the ball downfield with runs from Michael Ealy and Dalton Morgan, but stalled at the 30 and turned the ball over on downs.\nWith momentum after the stop, Hardin Valley picked its way downfield, settling for a 22-yard field goal from Andrew Foster to take a 10-0 lead.\nJefferson County came to life when the rain let up in the second half. Quarterback Austin Jenkins led a scoring drive to open the third quarter, tossing a short screen pass to Ealy with blockers in front. Ealy raced 33 yards for a touchdown.\n\"We had chances, but we were our own worst enemy,\" Jefferson County coach Kenny Cobble said. \"You can't come out against a good football team and have to play them and play yourselves.\"\nHardin Valley opened its playbook later in the quarter, with Aguero finding Jeremiah Russell for a 40-yard touchdown pass. Aguero also tossed a 20-yard halfback pass to Jason Love.\nJefferson County's Jenkins threw a 2-yard TD pass to Noah Carter in the fourth.\nAdam Greene is a freelance contributor.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T08:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T13:33:39.956+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
