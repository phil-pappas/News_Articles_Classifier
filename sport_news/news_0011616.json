And it didn't help matters when they lost to their bitter interstate rival Florida State, after they posed as bullies to the Seminole's top kicker at the start of that game on October 10th.\nGoing into today's game versus Clemson , the 'Canes were 4-2. Things went from mediocre to worse than imaginable today as they were getting smoked 28-0 by halftime. And Miami fans in the stands at the game were even so pissed that they started scrapping with each other.\n#Miami fans scuffling in the stands. Lots of people being ejected. #Clemson up 28-0. pic.twitter.com/vcj0SMuNp3\n— Sefton Ipock (@SeftonIpock) October 24, 2015 The final score of the game was a whopping 58-0 (yes, 5-8 to zero!), and this was a topic of discussion amongst notable alumni like NFL greats Warren Sapp and Leon Searcy . Here's their two cents on the job that The U's head coach Al Golden is doing.\nThank U ABC! #FireHim\n— Warren Sapp (@WarrenSapp) October 24, 2015 Well the mascot leads US out of the smoke?, I guess it's his team. #AlGottaGo pic.twitter.com/BiAYEFSNOU\n— Warren Sapp (@WarrenSapp) October 24, 2015 Why is Al the only coach on our sidelines without the U on Him? #SomebodyHelpMeWithThis\n— Warren Sapp (@WarrenSapp) October 24, 2015 That face you make when Miami down 21-0 pic.twitter.com/6aPc2PRqaD\n— Leon Searcy (@leonsearcy72) October 24, 2015 Time to head in a new direction as a program, enough is enough & I sat back & have been patient & quite long enough.\n— Bryant Mckinnie (@BryantMckinnie) October 24, 2015 But-but-but-but WAIT, IT GETS WORSE!\nI'm so embarrassed! @CanesAllAccess I would take his headset at halftime!! Do not wait until end of season, make a statement dammit\n— Joaquin Gonzalez (@Joaquin_UMOL73) October 24, 2015 SLAMMED! And if you're a Miami fan, this victory dance by Clemson's football squad to Drake's \"Hotline Bling\" will make you even madder because you and the 'Cane faithful just got Meek'ed real HARD!\n BroBible ]", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/hashtag/Miami?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/SeftonIpock/status/657972224494837764", "https://streamable.com/e/nnc8", "https://twitter.com/BryantMckinnie/status/657990297297752064", "http://www.brobible.com/sports/article/miami-fans-are-fighting-each-other-in-the-stands/", "https://twitter.com/CanesAllAccess", "https://twitter.com/leonsearcy72/status/657961081902534656", "https://twitter.com/WarrenSapp/status/657972194836918273", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/SomebodyHelpMeWithThis?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/Joaquin_UMOL73/status/657974235059503104", "https://twitter.com/WarrenSapp/status/657960420528009216", "https://twitter.com/WarrenSapp/status/657961429824327680", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/Clemson?src=hash", "https://t.co/BiAYEFSNOU", "https://t.co/6aPc2PRqaD", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/FireHim?src=hash", "https://t.co/vcj0SMuNp3", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/AlGottaGo?src=hash"], "published": "2015-10-25T00:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T04:22:26.172+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
