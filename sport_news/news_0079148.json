Winning it in overtime: After marching down the field with the game tied at 21, Taylor Bertolet missed a kick for the Aggies which would have secured a 24-21 victory in regulation.\nInstead, a five yard run by Tra Carson helped set up a 20 yard strike to the corner of the end zone from A&M QB Kyle Allen to Christian Kirk to give the Aggies a 28-21 lead.\nAn A&M secondary that struggled at times during the contest came up huge in overtime. Senior defensive back DeVante Harris batted down a fourth down pass to convert the lead to a final score and keep the Aggies undefeated at 4-0.\nArkansas dominated the ground game (232 to 65 yards) and time of possession (39:28, 20:32), but ultimately came up short in OT.\n2. Physical play: AT&T Stadium in Arlington played host to the 2015 installment of the Southwest Classic on Saturday. The crowd of 67,339 watched as the Aggies took on a Razorback team facing a 1-3 start to the season with a loss.\nAs expected, the Razorbacks played as if their season depended on it while A&M had flashes of productivity but an overall flat game for the majority of the contest. Moving the chains proved to be an issue for sophomore QB Kyle Allen and the A&M offense, going just 2-9 on third down conversions in regulation.\nThe Arkansas offensive line helped guide the Razorbacks to 232 rushing yards and gave QB Brandon Allen ample time to go through his progressions.\n3. Red Zone struggles: A&M claimed a 3-3 mark inside the 20 yard line on Saturday evening in regulation, but managed to come away with just field goals on two of the attempts.\nSenior Taylor Bertolet split the uprights from both 22 and 23 yards to take the Aggies from a 10-7 deficit to a 13-10 lead before Arkansas RB Alex Collins scored from four yards out late in the third quarter to put the Razorbacks back in front. In both instances, it appeared A&M could come away with a touchdown before ultimately stalling out.\nIn the fourth quarter, Rawleigh Williams III increased the lead for Arkansas with a four yard rushing score that brought the score to 21-13.\nIt took 57 minutes and change for the A&M offense to find the end zone from the red zone, with Tra Carson punching in the two-yard score followed by a successful 2-point conversion to tie the score at 21.\nDespite the struggles, the Aggies get the last laugh scoring the final points of the game from the 20 yard line.\n4. QB Play: Passes flew early and often at AT&T Stadium with the majority finding their intended targets.\nBrandon Allen started the game 13-13 for Arkansas before launching his first incompletion (an INT) on one of his few mistakes in the contest. His counterpart, Kyle Allen, also managed a solid day of passing with 21 completions on 28 attempts for 358 yards.\nWhile the completion percentage remained respectable, Kyle Allen's decision making seemed slightly slower than normal. The Arkansas defense forced him outside of the pocket and his comfort zone early and often en route to tallying up two sacks and consistent pressure.\n5. Christian Kirk continues to impress: After a mental mistake from Kirk on a punt return had the Aggies starting a drive from inside their own five yard line, folks wondered how the freshman WR who has had a strong start to 2015 would respond.\nIt didn't take long. After Kyle Allen connected with Jeremy Tabuyo for seven yards, Ricky Seals-Jones for 11, and Josh Reynolds for 36, the QB hooked up with Kirk on a 44 yard touchdown pass to cap off the four play, 97 yard drive.\nKirk had eight receptions for 173 yards and two touchdowns on the evening. His biggest reception of course being the 20-yard TD in overtime to give the Aggies the victory.\nConference play continues for the Aggies as they return home to Kyle Field next week with a contest scheduled for Oct. 3 against Mississippi State.\nNo. 14 Texas A&M 28, Arkansas 21\nFull coverage Visit the Texas A&M page\nHairopoulos: Instant replay ... like in 2014, Aggies rally, top Arkansas in OT 28-21\nDeja blue: Arkansas' Bielema sees losing trend continue with another OT loss to A&M\nTexas A&M quick hits: Aggies post first sack vs. Arkansas this season; Razorbacks hog the ball\nFive thoughts: Red zone struggles for A&M, but freshman WR Kirk continues to impress\nPhotos: Hugs for Reveille; lots of tailgate action before Aggies rally to top Arkansas 28-21 in OT\nOn Twitter:\n @BrandonWheeland", "external_links": ["http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/09/26/hairopoulos-instant-replay-like-2014-aggies-rally-top-arkansas-ot-28-21", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/09/26/deja-blue-arkansas-bielema-sees-losing-trend-continue-another-ot-loss", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegephotos/2015/09/26/photos-hugs-reveille-lots-tailgate-action-aggies-rally-top-arkansas-28-21-ot", "https://twitter.com/BrandonWheeland", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/texas-aggies", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/09/26/texas-quick-hits-aggies-post-first-sack-vs-arkansas-season-razorbacks-hog-ball", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/09/26/five-thoughts-14-texas-comes-behind-defeat-arkansas-razorbacks-28-21-overtime"], "published": "2015-09-27T05:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T06:00:16.026+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
