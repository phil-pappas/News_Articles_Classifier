The manufacture of cricket balls is regulated by a cricket law of first class level. Being the nucleus and spirit of the game, a cricket ball has the power to make or break a game. In the market, manufacturers have made an assortment of cricket balls available, which vary in colour, size, quality and price. But it is very necessary to select a cricket ball with features which are essential for a perfect game and provides a long usage. Some of them are-1. The CoreAn ideal cricket ball must always possess the traditional combination of three to five alternating layers of wrapped cork strips and string that have been wound very tightly. The blend of these two elements ensures that the cricket ball bounces perfectly and remains in shape.2. The outer coveringA piece of pre-dyed superior quality leather should be cut into two or four pieces and then reassembled to form the outer layer of a good quality cricket ball. When talking about the four-piece outer construction consisting of the seam between two parts, this feature should be present in test match quality balls. The seam should ideally be stitched on the inside with high precision, which will ensure that the border of the seam is almost invisible. To maintain consistency in shape it is essential that while manufacturing, the seam must have been rotated by 90 degrees. Moreover, a high pressure device should be used to mould each section of leather to its hemispherical shape by squeezing it.3. The SeamThe seam, being one of the most vital features of a cricket ball, is one of the key points that decide its quality. Six lines of stitching constitute the seam meant to bind the two hemispheres of leather together. The ideal thickness of the string ensures that the seam remains functional as it decides the kind of movement the ball will show in the hands of the bowler. A properly functional cricket ball to be used for test matches must contain between 78 and 82 stitches while balls used for training and lower levels of play may have only 55 of them.4. The FinishTo ensure finer quality, cricket balls are supposed to be covered with thin layers of polish for imparting the recognize able shine, and to keep the bounce and feel of the ball intact.5. Quality of the materialCricket balls made of high quality leather sourced from Scotland or Switzerland and hand-stitched by expert craftsmen are considered to be of the best quality.6. Size and WeightAn ideal cricket ball can be identified by the fact that it has been made in adherence to the manufacturing guidelines and has the specific size and weight prescribed by those laws.
