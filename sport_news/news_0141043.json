The Pirates won and finished a game ahead of the Cubs for the top wild-card spot.\n\"I think it's kind of interesting, actually,\" Maddon said. \"I think it's kind of cool. We've got something to deal with here, obviously. It definitely will affect strategy, game in progress.\"\nThe situation reminded Maddon of 2011, when he was managing Tampa Bay. The Rays won that day to make the playoffs, with the Boston Red Sox (run by now-Cubs President Theo Epstein) completing an epic collapse.\n\"We broke badly in that game, 7-0,\" Maddon recalled. \"I was worried about using my bullpen because I thought at least if the Red Sox had lost we'd have a playoff the next day, and I'd have my bullpen fresh. So I didn't use the bullpen until we started coming back in the game. Then I started bringing regular relievers in. Then, of course we eventually won. That game was concurrent with ours at that time. So you're able to look at all that.\n\"If they all start at the same time and there's something hanging in the balance, it matters. It matters to be able to look at the scoreboard and try to figure out what you want to do.\"\nThe lineup card: Joe Maddon was asked if he had made out his lineup for Wednesday night's wild-card game against the Pirates.\n\"I'm getting closer,\" he said. \"I would say probably 90 percent mentally I feel good about it. I still want a thing or two to talk about.\"\nTeam President Theo Epstein and general manager Jed Hoyer drove up to Milwaukee for Sunday's game. No doubt roster decisions for the wild-card game were discussed, but no announcement was forthcoming.\n\"Close, pretty close,\" Maddon said. \"The original meeting with all the coaches helped a lot. These last couple days may have helped solidify some last-moment decisions. I don't think it's going to be a difficult decision when we get there (to Pittsburgh) because we've done work in advance of the moment.\"\nThe century mark: First baseman Anthony Rizzo finished the season with 101 RBI, the first time he reached at least 100 for a single year. Rookie third baseman Kris Bryant fell just short, finishing with 99 RBI. Bryant did single once and walk three times Sunday.\n\"What good at-bats by him today,\" Rizzo said of Bryant. \"Just shows he's an unselfish player.\"\nRizzo finished with a line of .278/.387/.512 with 31 home runs.\n\"Especially the last two years, just being very consistent, that's the biggest thing,\" he said. \"You're going to go through ups and downs. I've said it all year. It's baseball. You're going to have good times. You're going to have bad days. Just staying consistent all throughout the year is really important to me. It's important to this team.\"\nRizzo said he was looking forward to facing the Pirates. The Cubs will send their ace pitcher, Jake Arrieta, against the Pirates' top guy, Gerrit Cole.\n\"We played tough games against Pittsburgh all year at their place, at our place,\" he said of the Cubs winning 11 of 19 games. \"We're a really, really loose bunch. We're excited for it. We're excited for it top to bottom.\"\nRelated Article\nChicago Cubs do their part, but Pirates will host wild card Get great articles like this sent to your inbox!
