It would be the perfect thing to happen to me personally, being a local lad and having the fondness I have for the club. \n“Football is a funny old game, it’s about opinions. But if the opportunity did arise, I’d be delighted.” \nEdwards feels he left Shrewsbury under a cloud after a contract dispute, explaining: “I felt like when I left I went through the back door rather than facing everyone and saying my goodbyes. \n“It got to January and I was out of contract in the summer and I hadn’t heard about a new deal. \n“I was playing regularly and when the first contract offer came, it was nowhere near what other first-team players were getting. \n“At that time, my only real message to the manager Gary Peters was to see what division we were in next season before I made my decision. \n“We were in the play-offs and there was a lot of pressure from the manager to sign a new contract and I wanted to get the season out of the way and then we’d talk. \n“I got offered an ultimatum. We were in the play-off final so it was a case of ‘if you don’t sign your contract, you’re not playing at Wembley’ sort of thing.
