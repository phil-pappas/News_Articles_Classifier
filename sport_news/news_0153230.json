Honestly, I don't read any of them. I don't worry about it because I am just worried about this week. You can't worry about the past. The game is over with so now, we are on to Denver.\" \nT wo plays before hauling in a touchdown late in the fourth quarter against the Chargers, Barnidge made a catch in tight coverage while falling out of bounds. Barnidge tipped the ball with his right hand and then, corralled it as he fell to the field. Although the official on the sideline ruled the pass incomplete, the Browns quickly challenged the call. \nA video review showed Barnidge had a knee and his left elbow down in bounds, thus causing the officials to overturn the call on the field and put the Browns first-and-goal inside San Diego's one-yard line. \nDuring the Browns' 33-30 overtime win over the Ravens at M&T Bank Stadium Sunday, Barnidge caught an 18-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Josh McCown and gave the team a 22-21 lead with 12:23 to play in the fourth quarter. \nOriginally, Barnidge went up for the jump ball with a Ravens defender and the pass was batted toward the ground. However, Barnidge felt the ball hit him in the calves, and he pulled it through his legs at the one-yard line. Realizing he had not been touched by a defender, Barnidge had the presence of mind to stretch the ball across the goal line for the touchdown. \n\"Actually, I have only seen it the time on the field,\" Barnidge said. \"I haven't watched it since. Everyone else tells me about. We watched it going over the film, but that was the only other time I have seen it. \n\"The game is over. We won. There is no need to dwell on the past. Now, we are going onto the next week. You have to keep doing it. You can't rely on the past.\" \nBecause of his production over the last two weeks, which includes a combined total of 214 yards and two touchdowns on 14 receptions in addition to the improbable catches, his teammates and coaches are looking forward to what is next for Barnidge. \n\"I just can't wait to see what happens,\" McCown said. \"He's on a roll now and he tends to do something every week, so we'll see. I'm sure it'll be good whatever he does. I don't know if he's got to catch it with his shoes or something, but he'll figure out something new. That's the good thing about Gary. He's been consistent and he's played at a high level and he's certainly been a big factor in why we've been able to do the things we've done offensively.\" \nOffensive coordinator John DeFilippo added, \"Nothing surprises me with Gary anymore. It really doesn't. Like I always say, Gary's preparation and the way he handles his business in this building, it's not a surprise Gary's having the success he's having. \n\"Gary's a very humble guy. I don't know how he views himself. The way I view him is I think he's a much better athlete than he gives himself credit for. I really do. I think from Day One, he's shown tremendous ball skills and he's able to separate. Gary has a great understanding of leverage on defenders. He's not afraid to make contact with a defender while keeping his outside shoulder free if he knows he's making an out-breaking move.\" \nAlthough Barnidge jokingly admitted the next highlight could be making a catch with his hands \"so I don't have to worry about it,\" he plans to do \"whatever they ask me to do\" to help the Browns knock off the previously unbeaten Denver Broncos, who come to FirstEnergy Stadium with the NFL's top-ranked defense. \n\"You've just got to know no matter what, what position you're at or anywhere, you have to be ready to step up any time your number's called because you never know what's going to happen,\" Barnidge said. \"Last year, when Jordan (Cameron) got hurt, I think our whole tight end room stepped up and we didn't lose any slack in that area, so I think you've always got to be ready. \n\"Honestly, I feel like I'm good at helping other guys as part of our team. We have a great tight end room in general, so we help a lot of other guys, make sure everybody's getting things. I have the veteran leadership as well. Playing eight years, that helps.\" Read or Share this story: http://on.wkyc.com/1RKM1rp TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T22:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T22:56:26.329+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
