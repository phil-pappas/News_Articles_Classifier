(release) â€“ For the second time this season, a Carson-Newman football player has been named the AstroTurf South Atlantic Conference Special Teams Player of the Week. \nJustin Long (Kingsport, Tenn.) snags this week's honor after blocking two Newberry field goals to help the Eagles to a 27-20 victory over the Wolves. \n\"It's great,\" Long said. \"It's something most teams take off, but we emphasize giving effort and trying to get in there for a block. The guy beside me (fellow defensive lineman) Brian Bembry emphasized us getting a push and getting off the ball quick. I'd say it worked out in the long run.\" \nLong's first block came as time expired in the first half. The junior surged through the middle of the line and got his extended right paw on Ryan Janssen's 36-yard attempt to preserve the Eagles' 20-14 lead at the time. \nTwo drives later, Newberry marched its way down to the Eagles' eight only to have their drive stall out. This time with All-American punter Kyle Clark in the game for the kick, Long once more lurched through the heart of the line to deflect Clark's 25-yard attempt and preserve the 20-20 score. \nLong joins kicker Carson Wise (Blacksburg, Va.) as SAC Special Teams Player of the Week honorees this year. It marks the first time since 2012 that Carson-Newman has brought home special teams player of the week honors in the same season. All-America kicker Curt Duncan earned special teams player of the week honors four times during his junior season. \nLong and the rest of the Eagles will be on display Saturday at 1:30 at Wingate. Coverage for the Eagles' matchup with the Bulldogs begins at 12:30 on the Eagle Sports Network on Joy 620 (WRJZ-AM, Knoxville), Mountain Country 106.3 (WPFT-FM, Sevierville) and online at cneagles.com/live.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T02:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T05:33:50.268+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
