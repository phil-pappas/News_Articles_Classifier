An extra point for qualifying on pole gave Jota a two point lead going into the four hour race on Sunday. A thrilling race ensued, with the Greaves trio Jon Lancaster, Bjorn Wirdheim and Gary Hirsch battling hard against fellow championship contenders Jota and TDS Racing. The closing stages of the race were tense, with just points between the three teams. The Greaves crew finally brought their Gibson home in second place to take them to the top of the championship points and claim the 2015 European Le Mans Series title. The Jota Sport Gibson finished 4th at Estoril, four points behind in the championship table, resulting in third place overall in the championship. Huge congratulations to everyone at Greaves Motorsport for winning the LMP2 ELMS title, it was well deserved after a hard fought season, said Gibson Sportscar Manager, Jim Hibbert. Both Greaves and Jota Sport battled it out with our Gibson 015S during the five race season and they finished just four points apart. We look forward to more exciting races in ELMS next year and working with the teams once again. Gibsons Operations Director, John Manchester, added This is a fantastic achievement for Gibson Technology and to have won the ELMS for a third time with our engines and chassis is testament to our hard working and talented staff at Repton. This has been an amazing ELMS season and I would like to thank all of our teams for their efforts in making this possible. PaddockTalk Perspective", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T00:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T01:56:17.456+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
