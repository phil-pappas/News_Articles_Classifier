He's facing a pliant South Carolina defense that is allowing 170 yards rushing per game. That number is skewed by the UCF game in which the Gamecocks allowed 26. The average rushing yards in the other four against North Carolina, Kentucky, Georgia and Missouri is 206.\nIn five games, South Carolina has allowed four backs to gain at least 98 yards rushing.\nHere are the milestones Fourneette can hit Saturday and keep scrolling for a look at his game-by game career stats and the national standings:\n100 yards: Will mark the 6 th consecutive game with at least 100 yards. LSU record is nine by Charles Alexander (1976-78).\n102 yards: Will put his career total at 2,000.\n136 yards: Will give him 1,000 this season, the fastest player to that number (5 games) in LSU history.\n171 yards: Will surpass his 13-game season total of 1,034 from last season.\n200 yards: Will be his 4 th consecutive 200 yard game, breaking his own SEC record.\n245 yards: Will give him a new career-high for a game.\n251 yards: Will establish a single-game LSU rushing record, currently held by Alley Broussard vs. Ole Miss, 2004.\n266 yards: Will put him into top 10 for LSU career rushing yards with 2,164, passing No. 10 Brad Davis (1972-74) at 2,163.\nFournette game-by-game rushing\n2014\nOpponent Att.
