(AP) — Quinton Flowers rushed for a South Florida quarterback-record 201 yards and three touchdowns Saturday, helping the Bulls beat SMU 38-14 for their first three-game winning streak in four years. \nUSF (4-3, 2-1 American Athletic Conference) also matched its victory total for all of last season. SMU (1-6, 0-3) has lost five straight during a stretch in which the Mustangs have yielded 240 points. Game ball to...Quinton Flowers. What a game!!! pic.twitter.com/BD944EkUuD — USF Football (@USFFootball) October 24, 2015 \nWith leading rusher Marlon Mack sitting out with a hamstring injury, Flowers broke USF's single-game rushing record for a quarterback on his first carry of the second half. Matt Grothe ran 146 yards against Connecticut in 2007, and Flowers nearly matched that with 142 on 13 attempts while building a 17-7 halftime lead. \nThe sophomore carried 10 more times in the second half to become the eighth player in USF history to top 200 yards rushing. \nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
