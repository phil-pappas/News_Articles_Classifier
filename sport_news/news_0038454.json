Game 1 of the ALCS is Friday night. \nJose Bautista hit a three-run homer to cap an event-filled, 53-minute seventh inning that took a turn when catcher Russell Martin's throw back to the pitcher deflected off batter Shin-Soo Choo and allowed the tiebreaking run to score. \nThe Blue Jays filed a protest after an umpire review ruled Rougned Odor was allowed to cross home plate. Toronto fans pelted the field with debris during the 18-minute delay. \nThe Rangers started the bottom half by making three straight errors and Toronto rallied.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T07:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T14:23:11.689+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
