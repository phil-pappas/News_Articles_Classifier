Related Content Packers TE Quarless placed on IR \n“Pretty fashionable,” Adams said Wednesday. \nWhether the boot allows Adams’ injured left ankle to heal sufficiently before Sunday’s game at San Francisco remains to be seen, and considering he went into Monday night’s game with the injury and then aggravated it against the Chiefs, it’s probably not a good sign that he’s wearing such footwear. \nNevertheless, Adams said he hasn’t given up hope of playing and said that the injury is not the high-ankle sprain that has been reported by some outlets. \n“It’s low. It’s just a regular one,” Adams said. \nAs for the boot, Adams said the medical staff is “just trying to keep it stabilized and make sure I don’t hurt it any more. It got a little tweaked [in the game], but it’s day-to-day. It’s preventative for the most part. I don’t want to do anything worse to it.” \nAdams originally injured the ankle Sept. 20 against Seattle during the first half. He ended up returning to the game in the second half but was clearly hobbled. He did not practice Wednesday and is one of 12 players listed on the team's injury report. \nCopyright 2015 by Channel 3000 . All rights reserved.
