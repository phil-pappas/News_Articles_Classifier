We're very similar and very different at the same time.\" \nThe upbeat mood of the fire ceremony contrasted with the palpable anger at a protest earlier in the day by a small group of Brazilian indigenous people denouncing what they said was poor organization and unnecessary spending on the games. \nAbout a dozen protesters decried the event's more than US$14 million price tag, saying the money provided by several government sources as well as the United Nations would have been better spent improving the conditions of Brazil's impoverished indigenous peoples. \nNarube Werreria said she saw the event as a bid to cover up the real situation of Brazil's beleaguered indigenous populations. \n\"The government is using the event to cover our eyes and say everything is all right here,\" said Werreria, a state government employee from the Karaja tribe, whose lands are near Palmas. \"But everything is not all right.\" \nEstimated to have numbered from between 3 million to 5 million in pre-colonial times, Brazil's indigenous people now make up just 0.5 percent of the country's 200 million-strong population. They face rampant poverty and discrimination and clash frequently with farmers, ranchers and illegal miners eager to oust them from their ancestral lands. \n\"In Brazil, soy plants are better treated than Indians,\" Cacique Doran, a leader of the Tupi Guarani people, shouted at the protest.
