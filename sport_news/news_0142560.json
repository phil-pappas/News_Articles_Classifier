At 5-9, 315 pounds, Dyer can naturally clog up a hole, but he's far more than a wide body. As a two-time state powerlifting champion in the super heavyweight division, Dyer isn't going to be pushed around. “Cedric is hard to move inside,” Sterlington coach Jason Thompson said. “The biggest thing with Cedric is he keeps the offensive linemen off the linebackers and they love him for it. He can tie up two or three blockers. He's such a demanding presence on the defensive line, the offense has to account for him.” Thompson says Dyer doesn't mind mixing it up in the trenches. “He's an anchor,” Thompson said. “Once he gets his claws on you, you aren't going to move him.” Dyer's fierce play on the fieldbelies his low-key demeanor. “Cedric is a quite giant,” Thompson said. “He's very similar to (outside linebacker) Luke Temple, who I was talking about a couple of weeks ago. He's well-respected by his teammates and coaching staff because of his day-to-day work ethic.” On or off the field, Dyer goes about his business the same way. “He's a super kid and a good student,” Thompson said. “This is my third year here and I haven't had a single discipline problem from Cedric on the football field or in the classroom. He's a pleasure to coach and a pleasure to be around. He's the kind of kid you want your program to be known for.” Sterlington opens District 2-2A play at home Thursday (Oct. 8) at 7 p.m. against Ouachita Christian. FIRST QUARTER NOWN: When did you start playing football? Cedric Dyer: When I was 8 years old, I played for Sterlington's YMCA team. NOWN: What memory stands out from your first season? Dyer: I remember Jaylan King running quarterback sneaks. He used to score 100-yard touchdowns off quarterback sneaks. NOWN: What are your favorite and least favorite aspects of football? Dyer: My favorite part is just playing the game on Friday night. My least favorite part is all the running we do. NOWN: What has been the key to the Panthers' success this season? Dyer: Hard work and giving 100 percent effort on every down. SECOND QUARTER NOWN: What is the biggest improvement you have made since last year? Dyer: I'm a lot stronger and faster than I was last year. Page 2 of 2 - NOWN: How big of a difference has it made to have the entire defensive line back with a year of experience? Dyer: We have a chemistry now. No matter if they are playing defensive end or defensive tackle, we have to know what each position is doing, so the chemistry is important. NOWN: What challenges does OCS' offense present for the Panthers' defense? Dyer: They are the best team we have played, so far. They're well-coached and they're especially good on the offensive line and at the running back positions. We remember the embarrassment we took in the jamboree with all the missed tackles. I think that's what brought us together as a defense. NOWN: Which teammate has been the most pleasant surprise this season? Dyer: Leo Robinson. He's surprised everybody the last few weeks. He's worked hard and is leading our team in interceptions. THIRD QUARTER NOWN: What is the hardest you have ever been hit? Dyer: Last year, when we played Oak Grove for the district championship, somebody came up to me on a trap and cleaned my head. NOWN: What is the hardest hit you have ever delivered? Dyer: I'm not really a hard hitter, but once I hit you, you're going down. That's just the way it works. NOWN: Do you have a pregame ritual? Dyer: I listen to music before every game. I listed to hip hop and a little bit of everything to get me hyped for the game. NOWN: How has powerlifting impacted your play on the football field? Dyer: It's helped me in all aspects of the game because without strength, you don't have anything as a defensive lineman. You're going to get driven off the ball 10 yards on every play. FOURTH QUARTER NOWN: What's it like to win state in powerlifting? Dyer: Winning a state championship is the best feeling in the world. We have to make it three in a row this year. NOWN: Outside of sports, what is something you hope to accomplish during your senior year? Dyer: I just want to go to a four-year college, play football and major in game development. NOWN: Why game development? Dyer: I just love video games, and I would rather have a job I love than one I hate. NOWN: Who's the best video gamer on the team? Dyer: That would be me. Jaylan King can give me some competition, though.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T10:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T19:49:51.943+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
