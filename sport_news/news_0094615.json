It allows potential passengers to use a smartphone application to connect with drivers of vehicles for hire.\nSo I downloaded an Uber application to my phone and requested a ride.\nMoments later a Volkswagen pulled to the curb and I hopped in.\nThe driver immigrated to the United States from Colombia. During the day, he works as a valet parker and in the evening he drives his family’s car for a couple more hours to help make ends meet.\nAs he drove me to my hotel, he showed me pictures of his seven kids and gushed over the opportunities he has found in this nation.\nAnd one of those opportunities is Uber.\nIt’s a typical immigrant story: Work hard, compete and make things better for your children.\nBut competition is something Chicago’s highly regulated taxicab industry is working hard against.\nCab owners purchase or lease pricey medallions issued by City Hall.\nAnd they must abide by a slew of regulations, which companies like Uber have managed to avoid.\nThe answer to this unfair situation is to create a level playing field for the cabbies.\nEliminate the pricey medallion licensing system, reduce barriers to the market and slash regulations.\nThis benefits consumers as well as taxi drivers by bringing prices down.\nUber is part of a new economic concept called “the sharing economy.”\nAnd it’s here to stay.\nFor example, a coworker of mine has quit staying in hotels. She logs onto Airbnb and selects a room from among those offered by private homeowners who rent out extra space.\nAs one might expect, motel owners hate this competition.\nTough luck.\nWe should encourage, rather than discourage, competition.\nIn a refreshing free-market move this year, the Illinois General Assembly embraced a portion of the sharing economy by allowing for investment crowdfunding of businesses.\nLet’s say you want to start a barbershop but don’t want to borrow from a bank to get your business going. You can sell portions of the ownership of your business over the Internet to finance the endeavor.\nIt’s sort of like the New York Stock Exchange only for smaller businesses.\nAs you may have guessed, not all bankers are keen on this idea.\nBut it has given opportunities for people to start a business who otherwise might not be able to.\nUber, Airbnb and investment crowdfunding are just some of the latest examples of how the marketplace thrives on competition.\nWhen competition doesn’t exist, entrepreneurs will find a way to create it.\nAnd that benefits customers.\nThat’s the beauty of the free enterprise system.\nScott Reeder is a columnist with Illinois News Network, a project of the Illinois Policy Institute.\nEmail: sreeder@illinoispolicy.org .\nFollow Scott Reeder on Twitter at: @scottreeder\nSend letters to: letters@suntimes.com", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/ScottReeder", "https://ssl.gstatic.com/ui/v1/icons/mail/images/cleardot.gif"], "published": "2015-10-13T19:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T22:07:00.895+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
