MATT MASIN, STAFF PHOTOGRAPHER Related article » ANAHEIM – The objective is as simple as it gets for the Ducks, and yet it hasn’t been simple at all for them.\nScore a goal. Win a game.\nThe inability to do either in a wholly unexpected 0-3-1 start – the worst since 2008-09 – has launched a refrain that’s being bandied about. What’s wrong with the Ducks?\nIt is a question those involved aren't pondering.\n“I don’t think we’re thinking that broad,” defenseman Kevin Bieksa said. “I think we’re thinking, let’s score a goal the next game. Let’s try to win a game. We understand that it’s still early in the season. But yet we still have a sense of urgency that we have to get this thing going.\n“Sure, we played a good game last game and we controlled the game. Even the Vancouver game, I thought we controlled for the most part and had pucks in their end. But we got to start getting some production now, and we got to start putting pucks in the net.\n“We got to start winning games.”\nThere is angst aplenty. The offense that has generated one goal – a Sami Vatanen slap shot – in 285 minutes and none in the last 163 minutes and four seconds. Even the 2003-04 team that start 0-4 had two goals to its name.\nThe Ducks are now bewildered and tried to search for answers Saturday, particularly after a 3-0 loss to Colorado in which they attempted 92 shots. Sixteen of them missed the net while the Avalanche blocked an astounding 41 and Reto Berra stopped the other 35.\n“It’s weird,” winger Andrew Cogliano said. “You see four or five guys go through slumps at a time maybe and have a tough time scoring. To have 12 forwards especially not score a goal in four games, it’s unheard of, really.”\nThe Ducks will score another goal. That’s guaranteed. The unknown is when, and they’re counting one Sunday against Minnesota to get them going.\n“I kind of believe there would be pressure release everywhere,” Ducks coach Bruce Boudreau said. “I think the fans are dying to cheer for a goal. You can see it.\n“We can’t get frustrated. If this is the worst streak we go through all year, then we will be better for it when we come out of it. Especially if we come out of it playing the right way.”\nThey’re hurting in other ways as well. With two of their defensemen landing on injured reserve Saturday, the Ducks called up Shea Theodore and Korbinian Holzer from their American Hockey League team in San Diego.\nTheodore, selected 26th overall in the 2013 NHL draft, could be making his NHL debut on Sunday against Minnesota. The Ducks sidelined defenseman Simon Despres after Despres was on the receiving end of a questionable hit to the head by Colorado's Tyson Barrie in the second period Friday night.\n1 2 Next Page", "external_links": ["http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nwec9u-b88543595z.120151017202557000gj1cl160.10.jpg", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/twitter-ico.jpg", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/fb-ico.jpg", "http://assets.pinterest.com/js/pinmarklet.js?r=", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nwec9u-b88543595z.120151017202557000gj1cl160.10.jpg", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/mail-ico.jpg", "http://s7.addthis.com/js/250/addthis_widget.js#username=YOUR-ACCOUNT-ID"], "published": "2015-10-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T07:25:10.549+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
