The game will still be played at New London High. PUTNAM — Everything went right for Quinebaug Valley early on Friday night. Three Prince Tech fumbles turned into three Pride touchdowns, and the Falcons shot themselves in the foot with penalties that wiped out their best plays. But once the turnovers stopped coming, things got rough for Quinebaug Valley as Prince Tech rusher Vincent Ruff ran wild for 298 yards and four touchdowns and the Pride surrendered 42 unanswered points in a 49-19 defeat. Easy touchdowns Prince Tech’s (3-1) first two drives ended in fumbles inside the Quinebaug Valley (3-2) red zone, resulting in touchdown runs of 3 and 10 yards by Jeremee Perez on the first play of each drive. Prince Tech answered with a touchdown of their own and forced a three-and-out on the ensuing Pride drive. But the Falcons fumbled the punt, resulting in another Quinebaug Valley drive in opponent territory, concluding with a 33-yard pass from Chuck Innes to Kyle Loomis for a touchdown. “We were definitely confident coming out, first quarter scored two touchdowns,” Innes said. “We just struggled throughout the game. We got up on our horse, we’re like ‘hey, we got this thing’ and kind of let down our guard a little bit.” The Quinebaug Valley offense struggled after Perez aggravated a bruise on his hamstring, limiting the senior to defense and punting duties. “I think that the team wasn’t really limited without me because I believe in my team and that we can do anything with a lesser player. We’re a strong team and we have (good) backups,” Perez said. Asermelly praised the efforts of his players, shouldering the responsibility for the lack of production. “We made the decision, because it kept tightening up, to play him only on defense (and special teams) and that left us a little short-handed, but other guys stepped up,” Asermelly said. “Unfortunately we couldn’t sustain a drive in the second half due to my play calling.” After the game, Perez said the hamstring felt a little sore, but he was confident it would improve during the bye week. Perez seemed more bothered with sitting on the sidelines than any discomfort caused by the hamstring. “It was really frustrating, one of the worst nights that can happen to a player is being hurt and on the side,” Perez said. 2-rusher attack The Pride gave up more than 300 yards on the ground, mostly by Ruff and Vernon Mcalmont, who ran for 68, including a 43-yard TD to cap Prince Tech’s first drive in the third quarter. Page 2 of 2 - “I went to a camp with (Mcalmont), he was pretty quick and we just had a few bad plays,” Perez said. “(Ruff) was a pretty big running back, but as like all people say ‘the lower you go the easier to tackle,’ and we were just hitting high.” Asermelly said he knew the defense would have its hands full with the Prince Tech running attack. “We knew he was darn good, and that was no mystery,” Asermelly said. “(Ruff) and “(Mcalmont) are very good running backs and good running backs are good for a reason — they get their yards.” It wasn’t pretty, but Asermelly was still proud of his team’s effort. “I’m proud of the way our guys played all four quarters,” Asermelly said. “They played without fear as far as what I saw. A lot of the details in terms of personnel on and off the field isn’t that visible to the fan or the reporter, but we know what personnel did what (Friday) and we can be proud of their individual efforts.” By Jason Levy The Bulletin The Bulletin By Jason Levy The Bulletin Posted Oct. 9, 2015 at 10:54 PM Updated at 11:07 PM", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T07:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T15:28:25.357+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
