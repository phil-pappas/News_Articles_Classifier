(AP Photo/Tony Gutierrez) Posted: Monday, October 5, 2015 2:33 am AP Top 25 Heat Check: If not Ohio State, who should be No. 1 Associated Press | \nIf not Ohio State than what team should be No. 1 in the AP Top 25? \nThat was the question of the week after four top-10 teams lost and both Ohio State and Michigan State had narrow victories. There was no obvious answer. \nPoll voters shook things up on Sunday, though not enough to satisfy many fans. Support for the Buckeyes has dwindled with almost every passing week. Ohio State has gone from being the first unanimous preseason No. 1, receiving 61 first-place votes, to getting 38 first-place votes on Sunday from the media panel. \nNo. 2 TCU got five firsts. No. 3 Baylor had 10. No. 5 Utah had seven. One voter, Josh Kendall from The State in Columbia, South Carolina, put No. 9 Texas A&M at the top of his ballot. \nSo what to make of this clutter? \nIf a clearly better alternative was available, Ohio State wouldn't be No. 1. The problem: What team has that resume? \nHeat check goes searching for No. 1 \nNo. 1 Ohio State \nTurnovers and sloppiness have kept a couple of the Buckeyes' games closer than they should have been. That's not an excuse. Ohio State might still be the most talented team, but they have not played the best. \nHeat check: Too hot. \nNo. 2 TCU \nThe Horned Frogs beat Minnesota by one score on the road, which sounds a lot like beating Indiana by one score on the road, and needed a minor miracle to beat Texas Tech. \nHeat check: Too hot. \nNo. 3 Baylor \nIf you're going to play sketchy competition, which the Bears have mostly done so far, be dominant. The Bears have mostly done that, too. \nHeat check: Too hot. \nNo. 4 Michigan State \nThe Spartans have started quickly and snarled in the second half of a several games, including this past Saturday at home against Purdue. Their victory against Oregon is not aging well. \nHeat check. Too hot. \nNo. 5 Utah \nThe Utes are getting a lot of love with their road win against No. 18 Michigan, which hasn't lost since, and historic beat down of the Ducks in Eugene, Oregon. Performances against Utah State (24-14) and at Fresno State (45-24) were more pedestrian. Why not the Utes at No. 1? \nHeat check: Too cold. \nNo. 6 Clemson \nBoth of the Tigers' victories against Power Five teams (Notre Dame and at Louisville) were one score games. \nHeat check: Too hot. \nNo. 7 LSU \nNever mind the fact the Eastern Michigan hung around for a few quarters on Saturday. The Tigers were trying to work on their passing game. It didn't go particularly well. Road wins over Mississippi State and Syracuse are solid. \nHeat check: Too hot. \nNo. 8 Alabama \nIt would be a lot easier to dismiss that loss to Ole Miss if the Rebels didn't just get waxed by Florida. Great win against Georgia, though. Based on talent, the Tide is a top-three team. Based on resume, why is Alabama ahead of Florida? \nHeat check: Too hot. \nNo. 9 Texas A&M \nAggies have wins against Arizona State, Arkansas and Mississippi State. Pretty good, though none have come on the road. \nHeat check: Too cold. \nNo. 10 Oklahoma \nYes, Tennessee is tanking, but all true road wins are positives and the Sooners dismantled West Virginia on Saturday. \nHeat check: Too cold. \nNo. 11 Florida \nThe Gators didn't look like much getting to 4-0 with close wins against East Carolina, Kentucky and Tennessee. Then they looked like national title contenders against Ole Miss. \nHeat check: Too cold. At the least the Gators should be ahead of Alabama. \nNo. 12 Florida State \nBeat Wake Forest and Boston College and were pretty meh doing it. \nHeat check: Too hot. \nThe value of that Stanford win is soaring. \nHeat check. Too cold. \nSo which was the fluke? Beating Alabama or getting humiliated by Florida? \nHeat check: Just right, though the Rebels should be at least ahead of Alabama. \nNo. 15 Notre Dame \nThe value of that Georgia Tech win is plummeting. Impressive in a loss to Clemson, but still a loss. \nHeat check: Just right. \nNo. 16 Stanford \nSince Week 2, the Cardinal have been an offensive juggernaut, beating foes by an average of 42-19. Wherever Northwestern, Stanford should be a spot or two behind. \nHeat check: Too cold. \nLosing at home to Stanford not looking so bad. Winning at Arizona State looking better. \nHeat check: Too hot. \nWell, if Utah is No. 1 and the Wolverines only loss was at Utah ... \nHeat check: Too cold. \nBest win? South Carolina or Vanderbilt? \nHeat check: Too hot. \nNo. 20 UCLA \nThe Bruins did what the Bruins tend to do when things are going well, losing as a favorite at home on Saturday to Arizona State. But voters were punitive in the punishment. \nHeat check. Too cold. \nThe Cowboys have won some crazy games and gotten some crazy breaks. \nHeat check: Too hot. \nNo. 22 Iowa \nThe Hawkeyes' 5-0 start is highlighted by road wins at Wisconsin and Iowa State and last-second 57-yard field goal that beat Pitt. It's not exciting, but it's 5-0. \nHeat check: Just right. \nCal's 5-0 start has been exciting, but that doesn't make it any better than Iowa's. \nHeat check: Just right. \nNo. 24 Toledo \nThe Rockets have ridden a victory against Arkansas to their first Top 25 appearance since 2012. \nHeat check: Too hot. \nThat last-minute loss to BYU is going to sting all year. \nHeat check: Too cold, flip-flop with Toledo. \n___ \nFollow Ralph D.
