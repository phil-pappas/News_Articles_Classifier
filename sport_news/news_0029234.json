Doing so requires good field vision, football intelligence and arm strength. But just as important to a quarterback’s success is a part of the equation that receives less attention: footwork. In order to get the ball where it needs to be – and to remain upright long enough to deliver it – a signal caller must have good footwork. Former NFL and Mount Union quarterback Jim Ballard, now a quarterback coach who works with local high school and college players, learned the importance of footwork during his playing career and now passes those lessons along to his students. “Anybody who works with me knows that we work from the bottom up. Your arm strength doesn’t matter if your footwork isn’t right,” Ballard said. “I always tell my guys that your feet will take your arm where it needs to be.” Footwork plays into the quarterback position in many ways. Whether a quarterback takes snaps under center or in the shotgun, he must drop back to throw the ball. Drops can be three, five or seven steps and each requires sliding one’s feet quickly and not getting crossed up. Once a quarterback finds the right depth, he must reset his feet to form a good throwing base. Of course, the process is rarely that simple. Pass rushers are working to get up the field and pressure the quarterback, so there often is little room to set up or step up for a throw. Ballard’s message to quarterbacks is to understand where they need to step against a pass rush. “Tackles are taught to keep guys inside and not let them get outside,” Ballard said, “so if a quarterback steps outside, a lot of times he’s going to step right into a pass rusher. So what you need to do is maybe step back inside, slide forward and then throw.” Coventry senior quarterback Jaret Skaggs, who set a single-season record for touchdown passes in 2014, has come to understand the vitality of good footwork but didn’t always realize the need for it. “My freshman year, that was the least of my worries. Like any freshman, it was all about how far we can throw the ball and how many touchdowns we had,” Skaggs said. “As I matured, I realized how important footwork is to being a quarterback. In watching a lot of film with my dad, he’s always talking about footwork.” Manchester offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach Jason France has worked with several different types of quarterbacks over the years and uses a variety of drills to help them get their steps down. He has seen wave after wave of young quarterbacks come up with exactly the mindset Skaggs described. Page 2 of 2 - “They’re all thinking how hard can I throw it, how far can I throw it, but getting footwork down is very important for us ... guys that put the work in freshman and sophomore years,” France said. France noted that he take players from other positions such as receiver or running back and converts them to quarterback because of need at the position. He doesn’t believe it’s possible to take a player with no athletic ability and refine his footwork enough to make him a great quarterback, but he uses drills involving cones and blocking pads to develop the right thought process and movement in and out of the pocket. One of the ways Ballard helps quarterbacks process information and get their feet set correctly is putting the field on a clock. Twelve o’clock is straight ahead, six o’clock is directly behind a person and the rest of the field is slotted accordingly. Knowing where they are and where receivers are on the clock can help a quarterback properly align his feet for a throw. A quarterback could have a powerful arm, but if his feet aren’t the right width apart and in line, that power is minimized. Additionally, improper foot alignment can alter the throwing angle and trajectory of the ball, causing a pass to sail off target. Having worked with some of the best current and former high school quarterbacks in the area, Ballard has seen the need for quarterbacks of all styles and offensive backgrounds to master foot movement. For Skaggs, going to college camps during the summer has helped him better his footwork. Those camps include many drills that focus on taking the right steps. Coventry does a drill in practice that forces its signal callers to throw quick passes with their feet in the right place and their hips properly rotated into position. Quarterback coaches such as Ballard attempt to build those skills as the basis for the rest of the game and for those looking to lead winning teams and earn college scholarships, it’s all part of the dance.
