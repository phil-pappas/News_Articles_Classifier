I think tonight we kind of got a chance to take a breath,” Jefferson City head coach Ted LePage said. “We executed very well at times, I thought we played very well at times and I think we played special teams well at times. And then there were some low moments, but the nice thing was our kids worked through them.” \nThe Jays (6-1) jumped out to a two-touchdown lead in the first quarter. Confluence Prep brought the score to 14-6 with a Marvin Williams 3-yard run in the second quarter following a Gunnar See interception. \nSenior running back Denzel Wilson went to work with two touchdown runs from 14 and 11 yards out to put the Jays up 28-6. \nThe Jays’ defense then forced the Titans to a three-and-out and one of their eight punts on the night. See quickly connected with junior wide receiver Adam Huff for a 42-yard touchdown to give the Jays a 35-6 lead headed into halftime. \nJunior running back Rashaun Woods took most of the second-half snaps while Wilson took the rest of the game off. Woods — who scored the second touchdown of the game on a 2-yard run — fumbled on the first play of the second half. \nJunior tight end Allan Roettgen reeled in a 59-yard reception early in the third quarter. Roettgen was the Jays’ leading receiver with four catches for 101 yards and the touchdown. \nWoods took a handoff to the left side and ran into the end zone untouched for his second touchdown with 2:49 left in the third quarter. \nSophomore quarterback Michael Ellinger played the fourth quarter for the Jays. He led the offense to six-play, 30-yard drive that ended with an 8-yard Ellinger scamper for the final score of the game. Junior running back Carson Ridgeway tallied five carries for 14 yards. \nSenior tight end Ramsey Floyd got his first career start and caught a touchdown from 8 yards out to put the Jays on the board first. \nJunior defensive back Isaac Moreland had an interception for the Jays. \nJefferson City will host undefeated Battle (7-0) next Friday at Adkins Stadium. Kickoff is scheduled for 7 p.m. \nNotes: The Jays have won five straight games. … Leading receiver Daniel Ellinger missed the game for precautionary reasons with dizziness and a potential concussion, according to LePage. … Wilson rushed 10 times for 68 yards and two touchdowns. He has scored in all five games that he’s played in and brought his season total to seven headed into the final two regular-season games. \nSee also:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T08:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T12:42:53.654+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
