As part of the judgment, Congemi agreed to pull the advertisements that said Roberts failed to pay taxes, while Roberts agreed to pull an ad that cited ethics violations on Congemi.\n“I think it's a huge victory. Anytime you can get your opponent to take off ads he's been running that are untrue, I think it's a big victory for us,” Congemi said.\n“The biggest issue that they could try to create during this campaign has been proven factually false, and that's important to get that across,” Roberts said.\nWhile the issue over whether Congemi can claim that Roberts did not pay his taxes seems to be over, it may not mean the end of mudslinging, much to the chagrin of Councilman Roberts.\n“ It was our intent from the beginning to stick to the issues in this campaign, there's a lot of work to be done in Jefferson Parish, it's our hope that we can continue to stick to the issues. We've agreed to pull that ad down, we're hoping for the next two weeks we can stick to the matters at hand,” Roberts said.\nBut just minutes after the court decision, Congemi’s campaign sent in a new ad, that still calls Roberts a tax cheat.\n“You know, we're gonna run ads until the end of the election and tell the truth about Councilman Roberts,” Congemi said.\nWhile the mudslinging may only be amended for now, at least one councilman isn’t planning to get dirty.\n“I think I'm doing fine, I'm doing just what I'm supposed to do, I've been in this a long time, you put your signs out, you go door to door, you get your message out, you finish up the last week or so and that's what I'm trying to do,” Jimmy Lawson, who’s running for council against Congemi and Roberts, said.\nCopyright 2015 WVUE.
