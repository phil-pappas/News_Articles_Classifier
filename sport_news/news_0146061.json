I think they pride themselves on being tough and it really showed Friday night.” \nThe Pirates trailed at halftime, 21-18. They tied the score in the fourth quarter on a 21-yard Jesse Barnes field goal, and took a 28-21 lead on a 28-yard TD pass from Ben Klutts to Mason Grimm. Metro answered with a TD of its own, tying the score to eventually send the game into overtime. \nBoth teams scored TDs in the first overtime and each were able to kick PAT’s. Metro had the ball to start the second overtime and scored a touchdown, but the PAT kick attempt was blocked by Poteau’s Hunter Young, keeping Metro’s lead at six. \nThe Pirates tied the score on a 9-yard TD run from Roger Barcheers. Barnes came on to kick the extra point, and although the ball glanced off the upright, it went over the crossbar for the decisive point. \nBarcheers finished with 341 yards on 51 carries and four TDs. Klutts passed for 221 yards on 19 completions. Ten of those catches went to receiver Austin Skelton, who tallied 113 yards. \nPoteau’s defense also forced five turnovers and recorded five sacks in the win. \nTimely Pick \nThrough four games, Sallisaw’s defense had yet to intercept a pass. The Black Diamonds finally got an interception last week, and it helped turn their game around. \nWith Sallisaw holding on to a 24-19 lead early in the fourth quarter of its game against Tulsa Central, Dalton Jasna’s pick stopped a potential scoring threat. The Diamonds then cashed in on the turnover with a score, and got another scoring play later as they pulled away for a 34-19 win. \n“We’ve practiced getting to the ball in the secondary, just relaying to our kids, ‘Hey, we need turnovers, turnovers, turnovers,’ and finally it happened at a big time in the game,” Sallisaw coach Scott Bethel said. “They were only down by five points and he got that interception, and I think that’s kind of what turned the game around in the second half. It was a big play for us.” \nSallisaw’s defense also got a boost from linebacker Clay Glass, who led the team in tackles last season. Glass finished with 20 stops, five coming from behind the line of scrimmage, and Bethel said those 20 tackles were the third-most for a single game in school history. \n“Clay was all over the place,” Bethel said. “That was one of his best games he’s played up to this point. He fit into the right places when he needed to and he’s the type of kid who plays hard on every down, and it paid off for us the other night.” \nQuarterback J.R. Williams passed for 150 yards and a TD while adding a rushing TD. Hunter Capehart rushed for 59 yards and two TDs, while Cooper Carr caught six passes for 59 yards and a TD. Edwin Castor also booted two field goals, including a 46-yarder, and was perfect on all four of his PAT attempts. \nBulldogs Still Surprise \nMuldrow remains one of the surprise teams in the area. The Bulldogs, who had a total of one overall win last season which came out of 4A-4 play, picked up a district road win at Stilwell, prevailing 26-8. \nThe Bulldogs also got a boost from sophomore quarterback Braden Gleason, who was taking over for senior Dalton Sharp, who is out for the season with an injured fibula. Gleason completed 20-of-25 passes for 254 yards and a TD while rushing for 66 yards and a TD. \n“For a sophomore kid getting his first start, I thought he came in and handled the pressure real well. … He did a great job and I talked to our offensive coordinator and said he went through all of his reads and everything before he threw the ball and when anybody wasn’t there, he pulled it down and took what he could get,” Muldrow coach Terry Jones said. \nReceiver D’Ovion Benton-Coleman caught seven passes for 120 yards and two TDs. \n“D’Ovion had over 100 yards receiving and two touchdowns, and I think those kids are doing a good job of catching the ball when it’s thrown to them, and they’re doing a great job of running after the catch,” Jones said. \nJones added the Bulldog defense bent but didn’t break. Stilwell took advantage of an early interception and scored but Muldrow kept the Indians off the scoreboard the final three quarters. \n“They got down inside of our 10 maybe once and inside the 20 about three times and we were able to hold them out,” Jones said. “We bent but we didn’t break but we’ve got to get a little better defensively between the 20’s and we’re giving up too many big plays.” \n3A-8 Standouts \nSeveral players in 3A-8 turned in some impressive performances last week. \nPerhaps the best showing came in a non-district game. Roland quarterback Manuel Bunch passed for 295 yards and two TDs on 19-of-26 completions, while rushing eight times for 183 yards and four TDs in a 62-27 win at Tulsa Rogers. \nBunch was also in on 12 tackles on defense. Kedrick Thomas caught six passes for 108 yards and a TD, as well as recovering a fumble on defense. \nStigler improved to 2-0 in 3A-8 with a come-from-behind 28-26 win against Idabel, scoring 22 of those points in the third quarter after trailing 20-6 at intermission. \nPanther quarterback T.J. Spearman completed 7-of-10 passes for 120 yards and also added 133 yards on 20 carries and a TD. Stigler also accumulated exactly 400 yards of total offense. \nLeading the Panthers on defense was senior linebacker Quontez Jim, who had 15 total tackles, 10 of those solo. He also recovered a fumble. \nMeanwhile, Heavener picked up its first win in 3A-8 play, downing Valliant 27-15. Sophomore tailback Connor Place gained 194 yards on 36 carries and had three TDs in the Wolves’ win, while on defense, seniors Luke McGee and Bryce Tolleson each were in on 16 tackles and the two combined for three sacks. \nTigers On The Prowl \nCentral could easily be 5-0 if not for a one-point loss to Panama in Week 2. But coach Jeremy Thompson likes the way the Tigers — who improved to 2-0 in A-8 play with a 46-21 win at Quinton — have been playing. \n“We’ve had a few games where we felt like we had gotten off to a slow start, but what really shows about our kids is how hard they work throughout the week and the condition they’re in,” Thompson said. “If you went through (the scores), you’ll see that we’ve pulled away from a lot of people in the fourth quarter and that’s a credit to them, because whenever you’re able to do that, it shows that they’re working hard and they’re playing tough for four quarters. \n“They’re resilient, they keep plugging away on every down and it’s definitely a total team effort with these guys and they’re playing for each other.” \nThe Tigers are also being led by returning quarterback Wesley Busch, who has passed for more than 1,000 yards while rushing for nearly 700 yards.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T13:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T15:07:20.445+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
