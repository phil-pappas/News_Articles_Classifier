It’s a great school. She’s very academically focused. It will be a very good fit for her.” \nJenks is an eight-time state champion in track and field. She owns the all-time Iowa best in the 1,500- and 3,000-meter races. \nAt the state meet last May, Jenks captured the 800, 1,500 and 3,000 meters and was fifth in the 400-meter hurdles. \nShe has won the 1,500 and 3,000 three times each and is a two-time champion in the 800. \nJenks won the Class 4A state cross country title as a freshman, but has not run cross country since. She swam at Linn-Mar through her first three seasons of high school. \nl Comments: (319) 368-8857; jeff.linder@thegazette.com Your Next Articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T04:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T21:59:09.272+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
