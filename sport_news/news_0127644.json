Bessler adopted the bomb-sniffing dog when they returned home to help him cope with post-traumatic stress disorder, USA Today reports . Nine-year-old Mike also suffered from PTSD.\n>> Read more trending stories\n\"I raised him and trained him as a puppy, and the ability he has to sense some of the issues that I have with seizures, with my PTSD, my TBI (traumatic brain injury) and severe anxiety disorders, how he can calm me down just by him being in my presence,\" Bessler told the Gazette . “He can help take the focus and help change the focus of what’s going on with me and help me calm down or relax me.”\nBut Bessler is now in mourning after police say a 59-year-old bicyclist shot and killed his four-legged friend.\nAccording to the Powell Tribune , Bessler was out of town last Saturday when the man rode past Bessler's property. The bicyclist told police that the dog attacked him, and he had to use his bike as a shield. He eventually grabbed his revolver and shot the dog, which ran away, police said. The man was not injured.\n“(The man) said he was genuinely in fear of his life and well-being, and the dog was ‘definitely in full attack mode and not backing down at all,’” Park County Sheriff’s Office spokesman Lance Mathess said, according to the Tribune .\nBessler said he doubts the bicyclist is telling the truth because the dog was shot in the rear.\n\"In my mind, it’s inconsistent with a dog that’s attacking somebody,\" Bessler told the Tribune .\n“I believe the gentleman just shot the dog on my property,\" he added. \"I don’t buy his story.”\nAuthorities continue to investigate the case.\nFor now, Bessler is collecting money to give Mike a burial with military honors. A GoFundMe page titled \"RIP Major Mike – Hero Service Dog\" has raised more than $10,770.\n\" We are a community coming together to mourn the loss of a brave military service dog who deserves the honor to be laid to rest with a military funeral and burial. ... Please help us fund a funeral that will do this military war veteran the respect he deserves.\" the page reads .\nRead more here.\nA military K9 who became his veteran handler’s service dog was shot and killed in Wyoming. http://t.co/fwYwXmKoO5 pic.twitter.com/2QUz12fb6r\n— New York Daily News (@NYDailyNews) October 17, 2015\nTrending on Facebook\nWoman's body hanging from fence mistaken for Halloween decoration Kidnap victim uses Google to save himself Half-eaten fish comes back to life, jumps on plate The latest: 7 things to know about Lamar Odom's hospitalization $2 junk-store find turns out to be $5M Billy the Kid photo More popular and trending stories", "external_links": ["http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2015/10/17/veteran-asks-military-burial-combat-dog-shot-and-killed/74122170/", "http://billingsgazette.com/news/local/retired-military-k-who-served-in-iraq-shot-killed-in/article_1ec0d928-fc7f-5565-9152-e174e388f38b.html", "https://twitter.com/NYDailyNews/status/655438212651970560", "http://www.powelltribune.com/news/item/14141-service-dog-retired-military-k-9-killed-in-weekend-incident", "https://www.facebook.com/CMGNationalNews", "http://t.co/fwYwXmKoO5", "https://www.gofundme.com/ew6cjw7k", "http://t.co/2QUz12fb6r"], "published": "2015-10-18T14:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T14:59:44.580+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
