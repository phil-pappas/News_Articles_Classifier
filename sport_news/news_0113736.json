Fayetteville State routs Saint Augustine's 40-18 to keep CIAA title hopes alive By Bret Strelow - Staff writer \nFayetteville State receiver Tavon Gatlin sprinted across the goal line and pointed directly at former teammate Kasunn Williams, who had risen from his front-row seat in the end-zone bleachers. \nThey embraced and engaged in a choreographed salute, making sure to celebrate that Williams' prediction of a three-touchdown performance had come true. \nThanks to a fourth-quarter outburst, the Broncos' big-picture goal is still attainable. \nPHOTOS: Fayetteville State vs. Saint Augustine's \nFayetteville State beat winless Saint Augustine's 40-18 on a homecoming Saturday at Jeralds Stadium, outscoring the Falcons 27-0 in the fourth quarter and prolonging its hopes of reaching the CIAA championship game. \nThe Broncos (4-4 overall, 2-1 Southern Division) close the regular season against Livingstone, which dropped into a second-place tie with Fayetteville State on Saturday, and Winston-Salem State, which improved to 3-0 in the division by defeating the Blue Bears 23-21. \n\"We needed to win this game for next week to matter,\" Fayetteville State coach Lawrence Kershaw said. \"We've got to win next week for the last game to matter.\" \nFayetteville State had struggled some of late, holding on to beat winless Shaw 36-29 and losing 37-20 at Johnson C. Smith. Jovahn Williams' 30-yard touchdown pass to Jordan Turkvant pushed St. Aug's (0-8, 0-3 division) ahead 18-13 late in the third quarter Saturday, but the Broncos scored 21 points in a span of 2 minutes, 22 seconds to take control. \nEarly in the final period, quarterback Derek Bryant (20 of 28 passing for 332 yards and four touchdowns) connected with running back Andre Montgomery for a 24-yard gain and Maleek Gorham for a 21-yard gain before finding Chris Hubert for a 34-yard touchdown. \nFSU quickly forced a punt, and Gatlin sprinted past the defense before hauling in a deep pass on a 57-yard touchdown that brought Williams to his feet. \n\"He told me, 'Go for three,' and I was like, 'I've got you,' \" said Gatlin, who also had a 22-yard touchdown catch in the second quarter and a 7-yard touchdown reception in the third quarter. \"When I got that third one, I pointed right to him because he knew it was going to happen.\" \nDarius Jeffers intercepted a pass at midfield on the third play of the Falcons' next series and weaved his way to the end zone for a touchdown that gave Fayetteville State a 34-18 advantage with 8:55 remaining. The Broncos extended their lead on Darreal Hamlett's 1-yard touchdown run, which capped a 55-yard drive that followed Jalen Sowell's lengthy return of an end-zone interception. \nAfter Fayetteville State fell behind 18-13, its defense forced consecutive three-and-outs and recorded two takeaways in a stretch of four possessions. \n\"We just played our game at the end,\" Jeffers said. \"I think people thought they were just going to come in here and lay down, so it took a reality check when we got down. As it came to the fourth quarter, we knew we had to play to win this game.\" \nAfterward, Kershaw held up a game ball that will be signed by Fayetteville State's players before being presented to the family of former FSU head coach Kenny Phillips, who died of cancer Friday afternoon. \nA moment of silence was observed at halftime to honor Phillips, who led the Broncos to three CIAA titles from 2000-2012. \n\"He's the winningest coach in Fayetteville State history,\" Kershaw said. \"I competed against him when I was the offensive coordinator at Virginia State, and he put this program on the map. We just want to honor him because he did a great job here.\" \nStaff writer Bret Strelow can be reached at strelowb@fayobserver.com or 486-3513.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T01:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T11:33:44.492+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
