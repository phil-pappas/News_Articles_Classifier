Although the top four teams earned their second highest percentage of the vote of any week this season, that doesn't mean there is much more clarity.\n\"I think the hardest part right now is the fact that some of the teams I think are the best/hottest have one loss already,\" said panelist Nicole Auerbach of USA TODAY Sports. \"While I do strongly believe we will have one- and perhaps two-loss teams in the Playoff when it is selected in December, it's tough to take them over undefeated teams right now.\"\nAuerbach considered Alabama, Michigan and Stanford for her top four, but stuck with unbeatens Baylor, Ohio State, Utah and LSU. One panelist gave Alabama a No. 3 seed vote, but none included Michigan or Stanford this week.\nThe Playoff Projection is in its third year. Its panel is based on the College Football Playoff selection committee's model and includes Auerbach and the WWE Hall of Famer Ross, former FBS coaches Tommy Bowden, Rich Brooks and Jim Grobe, former FBS athletic directors Bill Byrne and Jim Livengood, Michigan State men's basketball coach and football aficionado Tom Izzo, and USA TODAY Sports college sports staff members Paul Myerberg, George Schroeder, Eddie Timanus, Daniel Uthman and Dan Wolken.\nEach panelist enters a four-team ballot, with four points awarded for a No. 1 vote, three for a No. 2, two for a No. 3 and one for a No. 4.\nThe projection is purely a mock selection with no bearing on the Playoff selection committee's decisions.\nCOLLEGE FOOTBALL VIDEO PLAYLIST\nCOLLEGE FOOTBALL VIDEO PLAYLIST USC begins its search for a new coach | 01:47 USA Today Sports' Jason Armesto discusses potential candidates who could fill the head coach position at USC.
