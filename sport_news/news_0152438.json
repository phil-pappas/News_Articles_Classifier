The guidelines issued by the government allow telecom operators to share even traded spectrum, which means a company can sell the right to use spectrum to other company and later share the same spectrum. “All access spectrums, including traded spectrum, shall be sharable provided both licensees are having spectrum in the same band,” the guidelines issued by the Department of Telecom said. Access spectrum is airwaves used for transmitting wireless signals on mobile devices from mobile towers. The guidelines will help in effective utilisation of the airwaves, reduce call drops and improve quality of calls as a company which has less number of customers in a circle can share it with another that has large number of subscribers under a business agreement. The spectrum sharing is allowed only among two telecom operators in the same frequency band within the same telecom circle. — PTI", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T08:16:19.872+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
