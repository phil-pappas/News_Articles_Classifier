The Flames were forced to share a Tri-City Athletic League championship with St. Mary’s after an overtime loss on the road last season, and lost to Davis in the Sac-Joaquin Section Division I semifinals. So, Lodi’s 11-8 win over St. Mary’s Wednesday at Tokay High wasn’t just a statement, but a cathartic experience for its returning players. “It means the world to us,” said Flames senior Colin Porter, who scored a match-high five goals. “We’ve been training to beat St. Mary’s and Davis all year. We didn’t want to share (the TCAL). It should’ve been ours. We’re here to take it back this year.” While Porter handled most of the scoring in the middle of the game, senior teammates Matt Vanderlans and Noah Carniglia took care of the beginning and end. Vanderlans notched the game’s opening goal on a rocket, and soon after, went on a long run, stopped on a dime and softly lobbed the ball over the Rams’ goalie for a 2-0 edge. In the fourth quarter, Carniglia's high shot, which caromed downward off the crossbar and in, put Lodi ahead for good with 3 minutes remaining. He then sent a lob pass to Porter, who turned instantaneously and flung it in for some padding. Carniglia added one more by faking out the goalie and scoring on a deep shot to his right, splashing the water in celebration. “He creates openings and he gets the ball to people,” said Colin Porter, son of Lodi coach Courtney Porter. “He’s a valuable asset to our team.” The Porters weren’t the only family connection on-hand Wednesday. Lodi goalie Reiss Mahoney is St. Mary’s coach Shane Mahoney’s younger brother. “It’s fun, it creates even more of a rivalry. You don’t ever want to lose to your younger brother,” said Shane Mahoney, also the Rams’ girls coach. “I’m happy for him. He played a great game.” Courtney Porter was proud with Lodi’s ability to bury St. Mary’s when it needed to. “Our fourth quarter was really strong, which we’ve struggled with,” he said. “Shane does an outstanding job with his program, and we knew we’d be in a dog fight.” Behind Porter, Carniglia added three goals and Vanderlans had two. Luis Araya paced the Rams with four goals and Matthew Hosmer scored two. St. Mary’s girls calm under duress The Rams girls squad opened the evening by beating the Flames 9-8. Madasonne Butler, a senior who scored a match-high five goals, delivered the final dagger. In an 8-all tie, St. Mary’s goalie Baleigh Schipper fired a long pass to Butler. Butler recovered the ball in rhythm, turning immediately and scoring without setting herself. Lodi had scored two consecutive goals and was on the precipice of a comeback before Butler’s strike. “Because it’s such a long pass, the momentum on it is really nice. Just turning around and chucking it, not really looking. It’s just a perfect play,” Butler said. Behind Butler, Olivia Navarro and Hailey Williams scored two goals each for St. Mary’s. Olivia Grim led the Flames with four goals, and McKenna Martin had two goals. — Contact reporter Thomas Lawrence at (209) 546-8272 or tlawrence@recordnet.com.
