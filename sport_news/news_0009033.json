Railway sources said after the departure of trains at 6:40 am and 8 am from Banihal, the train which arrived from Srinagar at 9 am was not allowed the return journey reportedly following directions of the divisional administration. Police sources said the decision was taken in view of the commotion and bandh in the Kashmir valley following death of the trucker. Shops and business establishments remained closed on Monday in Banihal town while hundreds of irate youths took out a procession in the market braving the downpour. No untoward incident was reported from any part of Ramban district. Movement of Srinagar-bound vehicles, particularly trucks and those not from Kashmir, was restricted on Sunday afternoon.
