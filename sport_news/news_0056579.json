(AP) - Mike Grella scored in 7 seconds for the fastest goal in MLS history and the New York Red Bulls beat the Philadelphia Union 4-1 on Sunday to earn the top seed in the Eastern Conference playoffs.\nGrella raced to the ball and attacked the open lane after flat-footed midfielder Michael Lahoud allowed the initial backpass to roll past him. With Steven Vitoria backpedaling, Grella juked left and sent a left-footed shot deflecting off the defender and past goalkeeper Andre Blake. Tim Cahill scored the previous fastest goal at 8 seconds in the Red Bulls' 3-0 victory over the Houston Dynamo on Oct. 20, 2013.\nGrella also scored in the 17th minute to give New York (17-10-6) a 3-0 lead.\nWright-Phillips added his 16th goal of the season on a right-footed volley in the fourth minute. Kemar Lawrence scored his first MLS goal to make it 4-0 just before the half.\nThe Red Bulls are tied with FC Dallas in the Supporters' Shield race for the overall regular-season title with one game left. Next Sunday, New York is at Chicago, and FC Dallas will finish at home against San Jose.\nSebastien Le Toux scored for the Union (9-17-7) in the 55th minute.\nMore coverage Download FREE Philly Sports Now app for iPhone!
