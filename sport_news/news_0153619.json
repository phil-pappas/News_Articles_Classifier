But at least for a few hours Thursday night, Mike Vick was a \"star\" quarterback in the NFL again. \nIn Pittsburgh, of all places. \nNo, it wasn't the Michael Vick Experience or the video game version of a quarterback that he was another lifetime and two years in Leavenworth ago. \nAt 35, Vicks's best days are clearly long behind him. But as long as he still has that left arm and he still has those feet, Vick can still make some plays, even throw a block too. Maybe not as many plays as he used to but enough. \nOn Thursday, Vick did enough to win. \nThe Steelers' defense, which should have dealt arch-rival Baltimore a death blow, did enough to win. \nKicker Josh Scobee did not. Punter Jordan Berry also did not. And thus, the Steelers dropped an excruciating 23-20 heartbreaker to the Ravens in overtime at a stunned Heinz Field on Thursday night, a loss Vick called \"probably the toughest of my career.\" \n\"We had our chances to win the game,\" he said. \"I had plays that I could have made but didn't and it's disappointing.\" \nPlaying in place of injured starter Ben Roethlisberger, Vick threw for a modest 124 yards, completing 19 of 26 passes with one touchdown and no interceptions. He ran the ball nine times for another 33 yards and, most importantly, didn't fumble. \nThose passing numbers aren't going to be confused with Roethlisberger on his worst day, but for the Steelers those will need to be winning numbers. They have to be. \nSave for the missed kicks, the short punts and a few tackles, the Steelers would be wise to copy this game plan and repeat as necessary for the next 4-to-6 weeks. Rely on a defense that is starting to make big strides and use Vick in moderation. \n\"Trying to fill in for Ben is a difficult task but I was up for it,\" Vick said. \"I was excited about it. I haven't felt this type of pain in a long time. \n\"For me, it's all about gaining more confidence from this point on. Continuing to try to get better in every facet of the game.\" \nVick was neither game manager, the ultimate backhanded compliment, nor gunslinger but he played within himself. After a sluggish start, offensive coordinator Todd Haley allowed Vick to play to his strengths. He was able to get out of the pocket and make throws on the run. He was able to find receivers, all of them. \nThe Steelers rode running back Le'Veon Bell early -- and again late for a big 21-yard gain in the final minutes of the fourth quarter but they weren't afraid to put the ball in Vick's hands either. Even when they shouldn't have. On a crucial fourth-and-1 in overtime, where Bell's services were needed, the Steelers threw. Vick air-mailed a toss to Antonio Brown, the best receiver in the game, and the Ravens were able to get Justin Tucker in range for a 51-yard game-winner. \n\"That one is going to haunt me for a long time,\" Vick said. \nActually, Vicks' best play may have been a critical block on Ravens cornerback Jimmy Smith that paved the way for Bell on an 11-yard touchdown run late in the first half. \nAs expected, Antonio Brown's run of 75-yard receiving games went out the window. Vick connected with six different receivers, including under-utilized rookie Sammie Coates, but Brown needs to be a bigger factor moving forward. He had just five receptions (nine targets) for 42 yards, his lowest output since the final week of 2012. \n\"We didn't find ways to put the ball in the hands of the best player on our team,\" Vick said. \"Not to take anything away from the other guys, but he's a very dynamic player. He has to be involved.\" \nWith apologies to Peerless Price, Warrick Dunn, Alge Crumpler and those teams Vick starred on in Atlanta, this is the best offense that Vick has worked with. \n\"I embraced it and had a good time,\" Vick said. \"It all came down to one final play for me and I didn't convert.\" \nVick was better than adequate Thursday night on an offense that is not as powerful as it was a week ago. He needn't be the 2005 Vick. He just needs to be the best 35-year-old version of Mike Vick. \nOn Thursday, he was. And it wasn't enough.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T06:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T08:43:18.541+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
