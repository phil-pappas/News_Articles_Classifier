The pass was ruled incomplete, however. Porter finished with one catch for 11 yards. Max Faulkner Star-Telegram TCU receiver Ty Slanina tries to work past the pursuit of Texas Tech’s J.J.

Max Faulkner Star-Telegram 1 of 2 \nAsked to describe the trust level between him and quarterback Trevone Boykin, sophomore Desmon White said, “It’s getting there.” \nNo time like the present. \nTCU can use all the developing trust it can find between Boykin, one of the best quarterbacks in the country, and the receiving corps, which began the season as one of the deepest spots on the team but now is having the same problem as many other areas on the team — it’s getting hurt. \nThe Horned Frogs have Josh Doctson, who caught a school-record 18 passes last week and leads the nation in receiving yards. But there was a reason he was used so much. \nKolby Listenbee sat out the Texas Tech game and was limited for much of practice this week. Emmanuel Porter and Ja’Juan Story got banged up in Lubbock and also weren’t 100 percent in practice. Ty Slanina is recovering from a shoulder injury against SMU that still threatens the rest of his season. \nWe’re not asking them to jump over a building. We’re not asking them to do anything impossible, really. We’re just asking them to make routine reads, communicate, be you. \nTrevone Boykin on the young TCU receivers \nThe Frogs dug so deep last week at one point they sent out three true freshman as trips receivers on a second-half drive — Kavontae Turpin, Jarrison Stewart and Tony James. \nOrdinarily, that wouldn’t be necessary. But remember, TCU began the year already missing Deante’ Gray, who is going to take a redshirt year for an extra 12 months’ recovery from knee surgery, and Cameron Echols-Luper, who transferred out less than two weeks before the opener. \nThe fourth-ranked Frogs still have plenty of bodies at receiver as they get ready to play Texas at 11 a.m. on Saturday at Amon G. Carter Stadium. But some of those bodies are having to learn on the run as a Big 12 championship race begins. \n“We’re not asking them to jump over a building,” Boykin said. “We’re not asking them to do anything impossible, really. We’re just asking them to make routine reads, communicate, be you — you don’t have to be bigger than yourself — and just go out and try to make plays.” \nTCU ranks second in the nation in passing yards per game, 401.5. \nThat has been Turpin so far. He caught touchdown passes against Stephen F. Austin and SMU and has been a part of the offense from the first game. \nStewart, a freshman from Mesquite Horn, emerged last week as the biggest contributor off the bench. Boykin targeted him eight times in Lubbock, and he caught five passes for 88 yards, four for a first down. \n“He catches everything that’s thrown his way,” White said of Stewart, who caught 20 touchdown passes last year in high school. \nWhite, who missed a game with his own injury, caught four passes last week. Starting in Gray’s spot, the sophomore from DeSoto has 10 catches for 134 yards. \nIt’s not plug-and-play. But two years into the Air Raid, the Horned Frogs are better positioned with experience and numbers to make up for injuries at receiver. \n15 Players who have caught a pass this season for TCU, led by Josh Doctson. Eight have caught a touchdown pass. Three are freshmen. \n“It’s execution,” coach Gary Patterson said. “You’re not changing the game plan every week. There are certain plays against certain coverages; you’re not going to run different within that play call. You may run the route different because of the way they’re playing the coverage. I’d be doing an injustice to say, yeah, you can plug in a guy and go; that’s not what they tell me.” \nJaelan Austin, a freshman from South Grand Prairie, has played in the last three games. \nCharlie Reid and Preston Miller each caught a pass against SFA. \nAndres Petties-Wilson, reinstated from a team suspension linked to an arrest on assault and robbery charges, practiced this week. \nTCU has passed for greater yards each game this season: \n246 at Minnesota \n454 vs SMU \n503 at Texas Tech \n“They know they’re going to have to step up,” White said. “They know their time is coming. They’re going to prepare well. Coach is going to get them ready, and they’re going to come in and make some plays. They make plays in practice all the time.” \nBoykin still has an experienced playmaker in Josh Doctson. But he has used 14 other pass-catchers this year. \nIf he has to use more, he will. They have already been told. \n“We have a lot of young guys, and we preached all week that young guys play big roles,” Boykin said after the Tech victory. “Guys like Turp out there making plays, J-Stew out there making plays. And really, they’re just routine plays. We do it all the time in practice. It’s just about executing when the lights are on.” \nNo time like the present. #FrogNation - Episode 3: The Legacy Reid Ryan, son of Hall of Fame pitcher Nolan Ryan, is now president of the Houston Astros, but his ties to TCU and North Texas run deep. In this episode of #FrogNation, meet the son of a legend who is making a name for himself in the big leagues. \nNo. 4 TCU vs. Texas \n11 a.m. Saturday, WFAA/Ch. 8 \nThree things to watch \n1. Where are the takeaways? TCU hasn’t come up with one in two games. Before that, there was a 27-game streak with a takeaway. A year after going plus-18 in turnovers, the Frogs are plus-1 after four games. \n2. The Pierson effect. Gary Patterson said his veteran defensive tackle is going to improve week by week as he rounds into form. The Frogs have missed his leadership and emotion. \n3. A Doctson encore. After catching 18 passes for 267 yards and three touchdowns last week, what can the eye-popping senior receiver do this week? Maybe a repeat is too much to ask. Or is it? \nHead to head", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T21:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T22:01:52.253+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
