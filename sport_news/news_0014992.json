He's everything you want character wise from a football player. So I think that you kind of trust that he's going to keep working on it and get better. And listen, at some point if it continues to be a problem, certainly there may be some drastic steps have to be taken as far as limiting carries or those kinds of things. But I think you've got to trust that he's going to get it fixed, at this point anyway.\"\nAbdullah fumbled away a handoff on the Lions' second offensive series last week against the Cardinals and lost a kick return out of bounds in the second quarter.\nThough the Lions retained possession on a replay review of Abdullah's second fumble, Lions coach Jim Caldwell benched Abdullah for the remainder of the game.\nCaldwell said today that Abdullah's fumble issues are correctable, and have nothing to do with the smaller-than-average hands some teams dinged him for in the scouting process.\n\"I believe it's correctable,\" Caldwell said. \"He's a young guy. If you look at his trend when he went through similar issues early in his career in college, I think I made the same statement the other day, it's like a broken record, that he went from (having six) at one point to three his senior year, so I do believe that he can trend in the right direction.\"\nAbdullah fumbled eight times and lost six of those as a sophomore at Nebraska and five times with five lost as a junior. Last year, he fumbled four times and lost two in 264 rushing attempts.\nThe Lions put Abdullah and all their running backs through a fumble drill during the individual portion today, and Lombardi said Abdullah just has to focus on keeping the ball high and tight to his body, even when he's trying to make juke moves.\n\"I think that if he's got that ball held, five points of pressure all those things, not that he'll never, ever fumble the ball, but he won't have a fumbling problem,\" Lombardi said.\nContact Dave Birkett at dbirkett@freepress.com.
