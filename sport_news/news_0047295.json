Bastrop (4-2, 0-1) trailed only 17-16 after Jerry Powell found Josh Doaty all alone in the right corner of the end zone with 10:30 to play in the second quarter. Top-ranked Neville (5-0, 1-0) countered with a nine-play, 71-yard drive. With the Tigers facing third-and-eight Jaiden Cole threw to Deshun Roberson for 15 yards and a fresh set of downs at the Bastrop 38. Cole took care of the final 38 yards with his feet, running for 28 yards around the left edge before scoring the first of his four touchdowns on a 5-yard scamper. Charlie Barefoot's PAT pushed the Tigers' lead to 24-16. Barefoot then boomed the kickoff into the end zone for a touchback, forcing the Rams to start from the 20. Two plays later, Will Anders shot into the backfield on a blitz, leading to Ben Nola's pick-6. Nola's 5-yard return put the Tigers up 31-16 with 5:24 remaining in the half. Bastrop pressed into Neville territory on its next series, but was unable to convert on fourth-and-short. Taking over at its own 33 with exactly 2:00 on the clock, the Tigers needed just four plays and 54 seconds to get back on the board. Cole's 40-yard completion to Josh Diarse put the Tigers in business at the 20. On the next snap, Cole started to his right, cut up the middle and raced to paydirt. Cole's third touchdown of the half enabled the visitors to carry a 38-16 bulge into the break. Both teams went three and out to start the second half before the Tigers put the game out of reach midway through the third period. Donald Jenkins' 9-yard run capped a five-play, 55-yard drive as Neville's lead swelled to 45-16. Continuing to compete, the Rams countered with a seven-play, 83-yard march. Travion Burks started the series with carries of 16 and 12 yards. Neville then drew flags for a personal facemask and unsportsmanlike conduct before Powell's 2-yard run closed the deficit to 45-22 at 5:36 in the third quarter. Keeping the ball on the ground, the Tigers killed nearly seven minutes on their next series until Anferne Robinson stopped a fourth-and-one running play for no gain at the Bastrop 26. Taking a lateral to the left side, Bastrop wide receiver Alontae Alford hit Travez Moore on a 50-yard pass at the Neville 24. However, the drive soon stalled and Neville took over on downs at the 22. Receiving the opening kickoff, the Rams got off to a dreadful start. Backed up to the 5 after being flagged for a block in the back on the return, the Rams soon punted from their own end zone. Page 2 of 2 - A short punt with a backwards bounce enabled Neville to start from the 18 before settling for Barefoot's 31-yard field goal. Regrouping, the Rams put together a five-play, 79-yard drive to take the lead on their second possession. Powell completed an 18-yard toss to Al “Fig” Dowles Jr. and a 25-yard pass to Josh Doaty off the scramble as the Rams crossed midfield. Burks then carried for 12 yards and Powell kept for 23 before sneaking in from the 1. Bastrop's only lead would be short-lived. Corey Straughter's 45-yard kickoff return to the 33 and an unsportsmanlike conduct flag against the Rams helped set up Cole's 12-yard run as the Tigers went up 10-8. Bastrop went three and out on its next series as Rashard Lawrence and Robinson stuffed a third down running play for a loss of one to bring on the punting unit. Two plays later, Cole split two defenders at the line of scrimmage and sprinted 67 yards for the touchdown, widening the spread to 17-16. The two sides then traded turnovers as Cole Tracy intercepted a pass for the Tigers and William Lewis recovered a fumble for the Rams on the final play of the first quarter. After Lewis' fumble recovery, Bastrop covered 54 yards on six plays to draw within 17-16. Bastrop plays its next two on the road, at Tioga on Friday and Franklin Parish on October 23. Notes: Cole rushed for 251 yards on 20 carries and completed 4-of-5 passes for 69 yards. … Alcorn State head coach Jay Hopson attended the game. The Braves, who had an open date on October 10, return to action at home against Grambling on Saturday, October 17.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T03:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T14:30:37.785+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
