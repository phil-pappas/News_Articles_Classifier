Cowboys coach Jason Garrett has maintained that Weeden had a “good” performance in place of injured starter Tony Romo but that said that the team failed to take advantage of some opportunities on the outside in the passing game. \n“Obviously you guys (media) are beating a dead horse talking about throwing the ball underneath,” Weeden said Wednesday. “That was our plan all along. You look back, were there a couple times maybe I could have thrown the ball to outside receivers given the plays that were called? There were maybe one or two that I could have thrown out there.” Which 3-0 NFL team has best chance to go undefeated? \nWeeden attempted one imperfect pass to tight end Jason Witten on a seam route. He appeared to have a few opportunities to find receiver Terrance Williams on the outside but opted not to throw that way. \nWeeden said he hasn’t necessary read or heard outside criticism of his decision making in the game. But he’s aware of the criticism for not throwing more downfield. \n“Everybody that’s asked me a question, that’s been the question,” Weeden said. “I never thought in my 31 years of life that I would be asked if I checked the ball down too much. That’s not how I play football. I was 22 of 26 with completions.” Week 4 fantasy football rankings \nWeeden said Atlanta’s defensive philosophy - loading the box and not surrendering the big play – made it challenging to find ideal opportunities to throw downfield. Except for what he called the “bone-head play” – a second-quarter interception – Weeden thought he played fairly efficiently. \n“The strength of me is throwing the ball on the boundary,” Weeden said. “Or throwing the ball (down) the field and throwing those comebacks and stuff. That’s my strength. I’ve played a lot of football games and I’ve never been criticized for checking the football down. That’s not really me. If you watched me play going back to college or, shoot, even high school, I’m stretching it.” \nWhen asked if the scrutiny of his performance is a classic of the media nitpicking a quarterback, he said, “Yeah, you guys are good at that, man.” \nFollow Eric Prisbell on Twitter @EricPrisbell .
