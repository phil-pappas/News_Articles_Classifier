PETERSON\nAP Sports Writer PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) - Amy Rodriguez scored off a header in the 78th minute and FC Kansas City sent midfielder Lauren Holiday into retirement with a 1-0 victory over the Seattle Reign for the National Women's Soccer League championship game Thursday night.\nRodriguez scored off a cross from Heather O'Reilly. Just moments later there was a scary moment when Holiday went down and a stretcher was brought on to the field.\nHoliday walked to the sideline on her own and eventually returned for the final minutes of her last competitive game.\nHoliday announced plans to step away from the game in July, shortly after winning the FIFA Women's World Cup with the U.S. national team, but she vowed to first finish out the season with her NWSL club.\nIt was the Blues' second straight championship. The two also met in the final match last season, with Kansas City winning 2-1.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
