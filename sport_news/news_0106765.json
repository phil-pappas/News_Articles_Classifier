FLORIDA STATE (6-0) \nPaul Johnson’s Tech teams drive ’Noles batty: 300 yards rushing, 32.5 points per game in four meetings. \n3. PITTSBURGH (5-1) \nIn only 31 games, WR Tyler Boyd has moved to the top of team’s career receiving list with 204 catches. \n4. DUKE (5-1) \nBlue Devils play four of their last six games on the road, beginning with this week’s short trek to Blacksburg. \n5. NORTH CAROLINA (5-1) \nOffense is purring like a high-end sports car. And the defense is steadily improving. \n6. MIAMI (4-2) \nQB Brad Kaaya hasn’t thrown an interception in an ACC game this season and has only one overall. \n7. LOUISVILLE (2-4) \nSchedule is favorable for a late fall run to bowl eligibility. \n8. VIRGINIA TECH (3-4) \nMost-penalized team in the ACC and special teams so-so. That’s not Beamer Ball. \n9. GEORGIA TECH (2-5) \nLooks pretty hopeless against the Seminoles but at least got its run game going in loss to Pitt. \n10. N.C. STATE (4-2) \nOnly Virginia has gained more turnovers than the Wolfpack’s measly five. \n11. VIRGINIA (2-4) \nPrior to beating Syracuse, had not scored 44 or more in an ACC game since routing Miami 48-0 in 2007. \n12. WAKE FOREST (3-4) \nTook a giant step backward by giving up 50 points, 538 yards to Tar Heels. \n13. SYRACUSE (3-3) \nReally needed that win against Virginia before facing Pitt, FSU, Louisville, Clemson in succession. \n14. BOSTON COLLEGE (3-4) \nRepeat after me: Defense does not win games. Defense keeps you in the game until the offense wins it. \nGarry Smits The Times-Union", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T01:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T18:18:08.984+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
