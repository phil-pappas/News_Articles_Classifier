He arrived at Dick's Sporting Goods Park on a team bus after a night at the team hotel. Instead of burgundy and white, Serna was decked out in red, white and blue.\nThe 21-year-old Brighton native and his U.S. under-23 national team teammates were preparing to take on Panama in an Olympic qualifying match Tuesday night on the Rapids' turf.\n\"This game is probably going to be one of the most special games I've played so far,\" Serna said. \"It's always an honor to play with your national team, but to be able to play here in front of the Colorado Rapids fans and my family ... this is definitely going to be a game I'm looking forward to.\"\nSerna said he expects about 20 people from his family and his girlfriend's family to attend Tuesday's match — a treat, because they rarely, if ever, get to see him play for the Stars and Stripes.\n\"We are very happy to have Dillon with us and we are sure that he's happy to be home,\" said Andi Herzog, the Americans' U-23 coach who thanked Serna for the sunny Colorado skies Monday but joked about the lack of snow and mountains in Commerce City.\nTeam USA is under added pressure this time around — having failed to qualify for the Olympics four years ago in London — but Serna said during this Olympic cycle the focus has been on one game at a time.\n\"We haven't really talked about what the last cycle did,\" Serna said. \"None of us were a part of that.\"\nAdvertisement The Americans are out to a tremendous start, opening the group stage with a 3-1 victory over Canada and a 6-1 shellacking of Cuba. Those wins ensure Team USA a spot in the semifinals Saturday at Rio Tinto Stadium in Salt Lake City, where a victory produces an Olympic berth for the Rio Games in 2016.\nFor Serna, the jersey colors aren't the only difference. His spot on the field has changed too. Herzog plays the Rapids midfielder at left fullback.\n\"He has been a skilled left back for us for several camps and has already made a difference for us from the left-back position in this tournament,\" Herzog said.\nIt's a position where Serna is beginning to feel comfortable, even if his preference is to attack.\n\"That's one of the things Andi likes about me,\" Serna said. \"I'm able to get forward and can provide a little bit of an attack and provide the width on that side.\"\nSerna played the full 90 minutes at left back against Canada on Thursday in Kansas City, Kan., drawing praise from fellow defender Matt Miazga.\n\"He's very composed, so he helps us on the ball when we want to build out, very clean on the ball,\" said the New York Red Bulls center back. \"He has a great left foot, so he can definitely switch the ball around. And he's a very confident player.\"\nSerna has shown flashes of that confidence during a choppy season with the Rapids, interrupted by national team call-ups. He has scored three goals in 15 MLS games (eight starts) for Colorado.\nFor now, though, Serna is focused on making it to the Olympics in Brazil.\n\"It doesn't matter who we're playing against. I think we're one of the top teams in the tournament,\" Serna said. \"If we do what we need to do and play how we're capable of playing, I think there's a good chance we can win this tournament.\"\nDaniel Boniface: 303-954-1104, dboniface@denverpost.com or @danielboniface", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T17:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T08:28:50.146+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
