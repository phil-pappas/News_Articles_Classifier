Isley had three interceptions on defense as the top-ranked Blue Demons stayed unbeaten. \nAlbia led 42-0 at halftime, and it was 56-0 after three quarters. \nCMB’s Brady Stover, Brad Ritter and Hunter McWhirter missed the game due to injuries, and the four players who were suspended earlier this season missed their third straight game. \nNate Bishop finished 14-of-29 through the air for 89 yards, while Braydon Aker completed 5-of-7 for 58 yards. CMB threw three interceptions on the night. \nGunderson’s 47-yard touchdown run was his only carry of the game, but he led the rushing attack. Gunderson had seven catches for 89 yards. \nCharles Robertson led the defense with six tackles, while Gunderson had five tackles. \nIsley’s first touchdown covered 40 yards and he made it 14-0 with a 4-yard touchdown run and 22-0 with an 18-yard scoring run. His fourth touchdown run was a 23-yarder late in the second quarter. \nBlake Bayer had one touchdown pass for Albia, and it was a 48-yarder to Tony Leshen in the second quarter. Bayer also had a 29-yard touchdown run. \nAlbia (7-0, 4-0) piled up 435 total yards in 35 plays and held the Raiders to 240 yards in 66 plays. The Blue Demons, who locked up a postseason berth and a top-two seed in the district, rushed for 358 yards and averaged 11.5 yards per carry in the win. \nCMB (5-2, 2-2) will try to get back on track Friday when it heads to Alleman to face district rival North Polk. The game will have playoff implications as the Comets are 3-1 in district play following their 48-0 win over Davis County on Friday. \nAlbia 22-20-14-7—63 \nAlbia — Isley 40-yd run (Isley run) \nAlbia — Isley 4-yd run (Bassett kick) \nAlbia — Isley 18-yd run (Bassett kick) \nAlbia — Sinnott 18-yd run (Bassett kick) \nAlbia — Leshen 48-yd pass from Bayer (Bassett kick) \nAlbia — Isley 23-yd run (kick blocked) \nAlbia — Sinnott 53-yd run (Bassett kick) \nAlbia — Bayer 29-yd run (Bassett kick) \nCMB — Gunderson 47-yd run (pass failed) \nAlbia — Crall 32-yd run (Bassett kick)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T19:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T02:36:06.635+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
