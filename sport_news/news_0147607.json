(AP) - Jordan Morris scored a pair of goals, the second off a steal and feed from Wil Trapp, to give the United States a 3-1 victory over Canada on Thursday night in the opener of Olympic qualifying.\nMorris also scored in the first minute off a cross from Jerome Kiesewetter, while Luis Gil tacked on a penalty kick for the U.S. in extra time to put the game away.\nCanada got its lone goal from Michael Petrasso after a corner kick in the 80th minute.\nIt was a solid start for the Americans, who stumbled against the Canadians four years ago and ultimately failed to survive the group stage of qualifying for the London Games. It was the second time in the past three Olympic cycles that the U.S. failed to advance.\nCanada has not participated in the Summer Games since 1984.\nThe U.S. plays its second game in Group A on Saturday night against Cuba, which managed a 1-1 draw with Panama earlier in the day. The final group matches will be played next week in Colorado, with the top two teams from each group advancing to the semifinals Oct. 10 in Utah.\nThe two finalists qualify for Rio, and the third-place team faces Colombia in a playoff.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
