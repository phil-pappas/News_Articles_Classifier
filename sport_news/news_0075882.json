(Photo: Matt Kryger / The Star) Buy Photo \nCHICAGO – Yogi Ferrell admitted it was tough to say goodbye to sophomore forward Emmitt Holt, who was dismissed from Indiana’s men’s basketball program in August after he was cited for illegal possession of alcohol. \nBut IU’s senior guard also said he and his teammates support their coach and their administration in efforts to curb off-the-court issues that have plagued the Hoosiers for the past year and a half. \n“We all wanted Emmitt there, but the decision that they made, we’re gonna be behind it,” Ferrell said. \nHolt and freshman forward Thomas Bryant were both cited for illegal possession of alcohol by Indiana State Excise Police in late August. That followed the May dismissal of Devin Davis and Hanner Mosquera-Perea , following Davis’ citation for possession of marijuana under 30 grams. Mosquera-Perea was present at the time of the citation. \nDavis’ charge was dropped in September. \nFerrell wouldn’t go into much detail when talking about improving team discipline, but he said it has been addressed. \n“We’ve dealt with it internally and moved on from it,” Ferrell said. Hoosiers basketball coach Tom Crean addresses the media in Chicago at Big Ten Media Day. \nBielfeldt brings maturity \nThe addition of Michigan grad transfer forward Max Bielfeldt has helped Indiana shore up post depth that would otherwise be in short supply following those three aforementioned dismissals. \nJohn Beilein, Bielfeldt’s coach for four years in Ann Arbor, said the Hoosiers can expect a “mature” player, with Final Four experience. \n“He’s (been) on three NCAA tournament teams. Two of them made significant runs,” Beilein said. “He knows the culture of a winning program.” \nBielfeldt was Michigan’s sixth man of the year last season, averaging 5.1 points and 3.6 rebounds per game over 30 games. \nThe Wolverines struggled all season with injuries, losing Caris LeVert and Derrick Walton for significant periods of time. Without Bielfeldt, Beilein said an up-and-down season could’ve been much worse. \n“We wouldn’t have been 16-16 without Max Bielfeldt. We would’ve been 10-20 or something,” Beilein said. “He’s gonna be a great addition, just a solid guy, mature, no issues. (IU) coach (Tom) Crean can just coach him every day and not worry about anything you should worry about with younger players.” \nIRVIN READY TO STEP UP \nA back problem has temporarily sidelined 2013 IndyStar Mr. Basketball Zak Irvin, who’s entering his junior season at Michigan. But Beilein expects the former Hamilton Southeastern star to be back to 100 percent by conference play, if not earlier. \nWith LeVert and Walton ailing, Irvin shouldered a larger load last season, averaging 14.3 points per game. Beilein said he expects even more out of his junior guard this winter. \n“I’m looking forward to a guy you would not equate with being an excellent passer coming in, has become a great all-around player,” Beilein said. “He’s embraced that.” \nFollow Star reporter Zach Osterman on Twitter: @ZachOsterman.
