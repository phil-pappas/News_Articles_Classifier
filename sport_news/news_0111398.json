When you've got vegetable scraps from other dishes, save them in a gallon-sized freezer bag and toss in the freezer. When the bag is full it's time to make broth.\nSo what should you put in your broth bag? Here are some favorite additions:\nCarrot peels, nubs and leafy tops Parsley stems Leafy tops and the base of celery stalks Dark-green leek tops Broccoli stalks Onion tops and skins Which scraps should you avoid? Anything that might impart a strong flavor, such as cilantro or cabbage, or those that would give the broth a strange color, such as beet peels and tops. Also, you don't want to add any vegetable scraps that are old and rotting. You wouldn't eat vegetable mush, so why would you want to make broth out of it?\nTo make broth, transfer the frozen veggie scraps to a soup pot, top with 8 cups of water and a few flavor enhancements (bay leaves, whole peppercorns, a few dried herbs, a teaspoon or two of salt). Bring everything to a boil, reduce heat to low and simmer, covered, for about an hour.\nWhen the broth is done cooking, strain it through a fine-mesh sieve to eliminate any particulates or tiny vegetable bits. And don't throw those spent veggie scraps into the trash. While they've been exhausted of their flavor by now, they can be added to your compost pile to make mulch that will nourish next season's vegetable garden and future batches of homemade vegetable broth.\nAnd here's the real reward: Two quarts of delicious homemade broth that will taste better than anything you buy at the grocery store. The cost? We're talking pennies for the few additional seasonings. Compare that to the cost of two cartons of the store-bought stuff.\n-- Grant Butler\ngbutler@oregonian.com\n503-221-8566; @grantbutler", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/grantbutler"], "published": "2015-10-26T13:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T20:19:05.010+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
