I’m excited about the future of Iowa wrestling.” \nBrands is a three-time Big Ten Coach of the Year, has won four conference titles and three NCAA Championships since becoming the head coach in 2006. \n\"We have high expectations for this program, and I know our fans, administration, and campus leaders share those expectations,” Brands said in a written statement. “Being a part of Hawkeye wrestling is a privilege, and as head coach it comes with a responsibility that I take very seriously. We’ve got work to do.\" \nBrands has coached nine NCAA individual champions, 50 All-Americans, and 70 academic All-Big Ten honorees. \nBrands and the Iowa Hawkeyes are preparing to open the 2015-16 season with the \"Grapple on the Gridiron\" on November 14.
