The Blackhawks raised the banner for the franchise's sixth NHL title during a colorful pregame ceremony. All-Star winger Patrick Kane, the subject of a sexual assault investigation in western New York, heard loud cheers when he skated onto the ice for the Cup celebration. Kane has not been charged and has said he expects to be exonerated. \"It seemed that the crowd was supportive,\" Kane said. \"In this situation, you don't really know which way it's going to go, one way or another.\" Canadiens 3, Maple Leafs 1: Carey Price made 36 saves, and Montreal beat Toronto, spoiling Mike Babcock coaching debut with the Maple Leafs. Babcock made the first coach's challenge in NHL history and was successful in overturning a goal. Babcock challenged Jeff Petry's apparent goal in the second period, arguing that Tomas Plekanec interfered with Bernier. Canucks 5, Flames 1: Daniel Sedin had a goal and two assists for Vancouver in a rematch of last April's Western Conference quarterfinals. The Flames won that series in six games. Canucks goalie Ryan Miller made 29 saves. Blues: St. Louis signed forward Scott Gomez to a one-year contract. The 35-year-old Gomez, a 15-year NHL veteran, attended training camp on a professional tryout.
