Thank you for making me work harder.\"\nBacsinszky will move into the top 10 when the new rankings are released on Monday and paid tribute to her coach Dimitri Zavialoff, who also used to coach Switzerland's reigning French Open champion Stan Wawrinka.\n\"I actually want to dedicate this tournament to someone,\" an emotional Bacsinszky said.\n\"I came from really, really far away, I almost retired two years ago, and this man over there, my coach, Dimitri, thank you for helping me every day.\"\n(Reporting by Julian Linden in Singapore; editing ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T15:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T15:57:42.060+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
