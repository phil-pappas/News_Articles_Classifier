Interception No. 5 came with 7:24 left when he underthrew Kenny Lawler and was picked off by Dominique Hatfield at the Utah 18-yard line. \n\"We're going to have to show how we respond to this,\" Goff said. \"It was the first big test for us. Unfortunately, I played terribly.\" \nThe Bears could not overcome six turnovers in the showdown of the Pac-12's two remaining unbeaten teams in front of a capacity crowd of 47,798 at Rice-Eccles Stadium. \nCal (5-1, 2-1 Pac-12) was trying to reach 6-0 for the first time since 1950. \nThe Utes (5-0, 2-0) scored 17 points off Cal turnovers. \n\"Well, that was a tough one,\" Cal coach Sonny Dykes said. \"Our kids played really hard. I'm disappointed for them. We just made too many mistakes to win the football game. We turned the ball over six times, but (Utah) had a lot to do with that.\" \nCal got the ball one last time at its own 5-yard line with 4:52 left, and Goff made the Utes sweat. He converted three third-down plays to extend the drive, using his arm and his legs to move to the Utah 21. \nBut on fourth-and-5 with 26 seconds left, Utah's Boobie Hobbs stepped in front of Darius Powe to knock down Goff's final pass of the night.

In his 30th career start, he suffered a nightmarish game. \nHe finished 25 for 47 for 340 yards with two touchdowns. \nDykes said Goff \"just struggled a little bit tonight.\" \n\"We all wanted to win really badly, especially Jared,\" Dykes continued. \"Sometimes when you want to win really badly, you might try to do a little too much.\" \nInstead of Goff, the game's star was Utah running back Devontae Booker, who rushed for 222 yards and two touchdowns, surpassing 2,000 yards for his career. \nThe Bears have next week off, then play at No. 20 UCLA on Thursday, Oct. 22. They return home to play USC on Halloween before visiting Oregon the following week. \nCal still needs just one more victory to become bowl eligible for the first time since 2011. \n\"We'll look forward to getting it right the next game,\" Bears defensive end Kyle Kragen said. \nA 4-yard touchdown run by Tre Watson with 2:03 left in the third quarter got the Bears within 27-24. Utah stretched its lead to 30-24 on a 39-yard field goal by Andy Phillips with 12:07 left. \nThe Bears, who had turned the ball over just 10 times in five previous games, gave it away five times in the first half. Four of those were interceptions by Goff, who hadn't thrown more than two in a game since his debut as a freshman against Northwestern in the 2013 opener. \nESPN reported that no other FBS quarterback in the nation had thrown four in a game this season. \nThe first of Goff's picks went through the hands of target Kenny Lawler, but the others were his fault: one thrown into tight coverage, another on an underthrown deep pass to Bryce Treggs and the fourth on a tipped screen pass. \nCal survived its first three turnovers, allowing the Utes to cash them in for just three points. But Goff's last two picks of the half set up two touchdowns in a span of 1 minute, 39 seconds. \nUtah's Travis Wilson threw a 54-yard TD strike to wide-open cornerback-turned-receiver Cory Butler-Bird with 3:26 left before Booker scored on a 4-yard run for a 24-10 lead with 1:47 remaining. \nGoff rallied the Bears, completing five straight passes -- including a 50-yarder to Stephen Anderson -- to cut the deficit in half on a 1-yard TD toss to Darius Powe with 26 seconds left. \nCal running back Daniel Lasco, who had played just one half over the previous three games because of a hip injury, fumbled on his first carry and did not play again. oct. 22 game Cal (5-1, 2-1 Pac-12) at UCLA (4-1, 1-1), 6 p.m. ESPN", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T10:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T11:01:54.439+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
