Three others were unharmed, local authorities said.\nSeveral emergency vehicles were dispatched to the scene.\nPrime Minister Manuel Valls, Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve and Transport Minister Alain Vidalies were also on their way to the site, according to the transport ministry.\nIt had not been ruled out that Hollande might cut short his visit to Greece to visit the crash site.\nValls expressed his \"emotion in the face of this very heavy toll\" on Twitter, and promised his \"support to the families of the victims\".\nThe coach, which was carrying 49 passengers and a driver, had departed early Friday from a village near the site of the accident to take its elderly passengers out on an excursion.\nPierre Henri-Brandet, spokesman for the interior ministry, told BFMTV that four people \"were extremely severely injured\" -- two with burns and two with head injuries.\n\"It's an incredible tragedy with an extremely heavy toll.
