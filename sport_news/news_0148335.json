Should Australia lose to England but beat Wales, Gatland's side could still fail to make it out of the group. \nIt was hard work for Wales at the Millennium Stadium, but they managed to score two tries through Gareth Davies and Scott Baldwin, while Dan Biggar was once again on song with the boot, contributing 13 points. \nFiji crossed once, through Niki Goneva, while Ben Volavola managed eight points from the tee. \nDavies, try-scoring hero against England, opened the scoring for the home side when a ruck had been set up on the base of the Fiji uprights and after throwing the dummy, the scrum-half dived over to hand his half-back partner an easy conversion. \nFrance, meanwhile, are top of Pool D after a 41-18 win over Canada in Milton Keynes on Thursday night. \nFrance only have one pool game remaining, against Ireland in what is likely to be the match that decides who finishes top, provided Ireland beat Italy in their penultimate pool match.
