(AP) — Scott Hosch threw for a career-high 437 yards and two touchdowns, and ran for another score as Harvard beat Princeton 42-7 on Saturday. \nIt was the third-highest single-game passing total in Crimson history. \nHosch opened the scoring with a 2-yard run early in the second quarter for Princeton (6-0, 3-0 Ivy League) and found Ben Braunecker for a 5-yard TD to give the Crimson the lead for good at 14-7 before half. \nPaul Stanton Jr. had two third-quarter rushing touchdowns, and Hosch found Andrew Fischer for 14 yards to make it 35-7. Stanton finished with 119 yards rushing and has 36 career rushing touchdowns, second-most in school history. \nChad Kanoff threw for 203 yards with one interception for Princeton (4-2, 1-2). \nPrinceton’s score came on John Lovett’s 2-yard touchdown pass to Nick Peabody at the end of an 11-play, 70-yard drive. It was the first touchdown against the Crimson’s defense in 12 quarters.
