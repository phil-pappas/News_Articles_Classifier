The local types asked him about being on the other side of the Boston-New York rivalry of which he hasn’t been a part for five years.\nAnd the new Celtic got a nice ovation when we was announced with the starting lineup, though we’re grading on a curve here because so few were in their Madison Square Garden seats early for this titanic preseason tilt.\nLee is still a bigger than average deal here. The franchise slogan of “Once a Knick, Always a Knick” wears well on him — not as well as on Walt Frazier or Patrick Ewing, but significantly better than on, say, Renaldo Balkman.\nIt’s clear New York still has feelings for David Lee. And he returns the affection.\n“I love the city,” Lee said. “I love the city just as a place to be, even apart from basketball.\n“You know, I had some up and down times with the Knicks, but I somehow left here on good terms. I’m not sure too many players do that. But I think the fans here, similar to Boston fans, appreciate somebody that plays hard and gets the most out of what they’ve been given. I think I embodied that a little bit.”\nThe good terms remained even after Lee went for 28 points and 10 rebounds in his first game back in Madison Square Garden as a Warrior.\nHe departed in the summer of 2010, getting wrapped into a sign-and-trade with Golden State that netted the Knicks Anthony Randolph, Kelenna Azubuike, Ronny Turiaf and two second-round draft picks. The move was tied to the acquisition of Amare Stoudemire.\nThat was the offseason in which New York was saving up all its money for LeBron James — and we all know how that worked out.\nLee was an All-Star in his last season here, a nice climb from his arrival as the last pick of the first round in 2005.\nAfter getting limited time as a rookie, Lee averaged 14.7 points and 10.7 rebounds over his last four years in New York. And while he has increased his range in later seasons, he was mainly a hard hat workman in the paint as a Knick, which had to further endear him to the locals.\nThe kid from St. Louis who played his college ball in Gainesville, Fla., embraced the big city.\n“Playing sports in New York is like nothing else,” Lee said. “There’s the increased pressure, especially from the media and stuff like that. It’s a completely different ballgame here.\n“For some guys, I think it’s tough, and you see them be more productive players elsewhere in the league, where I really tended to thrive on it here. I think it made me really focus on the idea that you’re only as good as your last game here.\n“I’ve had times where I was averaging 25 points a game in a month, and you have one game where you have 15 points, and they write that you’re not consistent. That’s kind of what you get, for better or for worse. But early in my career I learned to thrive under that pressure. It was a great learning experience for me playing here in New York.”\nCeltics assistant coach Walter McCarty was a Knick for just one season (5.5 minutes per game in just 35 outings), coming here as the 19th overall pick in 1996. But he’s still recognized when he walks around Manhattan.\n“Playing in New York is a lot of fun,” said McCarty, who was traded to the Celtics in October 1997. “It’s awesome. Everyone here knows who you are, and they’re welcoming.\n“There’s a lot of perks that come with it. I was just here for one year, but you’re meeting guys like Tommy Hilfiger and Spike Lee and developing those kind of relationships. It’s an awesome place to play.”\nOnce a Knick, etc…?\n“I only played a year, so I feel like I’m a Celtic,” said McCarty.\nLee is now in his sixth year as a non-Knick, but he apparently made quite an impression here.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T07:41:12.529+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
