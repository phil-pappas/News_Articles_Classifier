Will Knight once again led the way for the Eagles, finding the end-zone four times in the victory. Smyrna led 22-0 after one quarter thanks to a Nolan Henderson touchdown pass to Donte Ritchie, and rushing scores from Henderson and Knight. Knight had the only Smyrna score in a second quarter that saw the Golden Knight get back into the game with three scores, two touchdowns from KiAnte’ Sturgis, and one from John Morris cutting the Eagles lead to 34-21 at half time. Smyrna’s defense would shutout the Golden Knights in the second half while the offense continue to go to work scoring 24 more points in the half to win going away.
