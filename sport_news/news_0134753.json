Kevin McCarthy, the idiotic California Republican who fulfilled Hillary Clinton's wildest Benghazi fantasies:\nHe'd whisk himself away to a medieval island fortress prison off the coast of France.\nAnd there, he would crouch upon the floor of his cell and voluntarily put his head into an iron mask, have it welded shut by some drooling jailer named Claude, and never be seen or heard from again.\nUnfortunately, in the universe we've been condemned to endure, McCarthy insists upon appearing in public, hoping to rehabilitate himself, clinging to his fevered dream of becoming speaker of the House of Representatives.\nGOP chairman on McCarthy's comments: 'Kevin screwed up' Tribune wire reports The chairman of the committee investigating the 2012 Benghazi attacks said Wednesday that House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy \"screwed up\" when he suggested the probe was useful in driving down Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton's poll numbers.\nRepublican Rep. Trey Gowdy...\nThe chairman of the committee investigating the 2012 Benghazi attacks said Wednesday that House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy \"screwed up\" when he suggested the probe was useful in driving down Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton's poll numbers.\nRepublican Rep. Trey Gowdy...\n(Tribune wire reports) But how could he even be considered after what he said the other day, giving a fading Hillary Clinton — thought by most Americans to be untrustworthy or a liar — what she desperately needed: a get-out-of-Benghazi-free card.\n\"Everybody thought Hillary Clinton was unbeatable, right?\" McCarthy, who was lined up to be the next speaker, said on Fox News. \"But we put together a Benghazi special committee, a select committee. What are her numbers today? Her numbers are dropping. Why? Because she's untrustable. But no one would have known any of that had happened had we not fought.\"\nWithin seconds, Hillary's meat puppets pounded away, asserting the Benghazi committee had been discredited, that it was all partisan and political, that it had been unmasked by a leading Republican as just another anti-Hillary witch hunt.\nThe New York Times editorial of Wednesday, with characteristic pro-Clinton thunder, said as much, parroting the Democratic talking points, saying the committee should just close shop.\nThe Democrats' path is clear: To defend Hillary, until they can make a better deal with someone else.\nIf the leading Republican candidate for president, one considered a scheming liar by most Americans, had been secretary of state during the Benghazi disaster, and if Democrats had the majority in Congress, what would they do? The same thing.\nSo is there a political aspect to the Benghazi hearings, just as there is with any other public hearing organized and performed by human beings?\nThe New McCarthyism Kathleen Parker The lede to this column is a deep, guttural groan that originates in the throat and expands into the lungs before collapsing in the pit of the stomach.\nHow do you spell hmmmgrrrungh?\nWhat else is there to say about House Republicans' inability to get something right? And I say this with compassion,...\nThe lede to this column is a deep, guttural groan that originates in the throat and expands into the lungs before collapsing in the pit of the stomach.\nHow do you spell hmmmgrrrungh?\nWhat else is there to say about House Republicans' inability to get something right? And I say this with compassion,...\n(Kathleen Parker) Of course. Politics is always at play. Ask Vice President Joe Biden. Politico.com the other day wrote of how he personally, carefully, cynically leaked the story of his dying son asking that Papa Joe run for president and save us from the depredations of the Clintons.\nAnd I didn't even see Hillary's fingerprints on the Politico.com piece.\nTo say that politics shouldn't be at play in a political theater is dangerous baby talk, or the self-deceit of an eager meat puppet. But it's also true that politics is how lead actors, such as Mrs. Clinton, are held to account.\nAnd there hasn't been any real accounting for Benghazi. Four Americans were killed, including the U.S. ambassador. Team Obama held the faces of the weeping families and said they'd get to the bottom of it.\nYears later, America doesn't know exactly why Ambassador Chris Stevens was in that crap town in Libya, what his mission was, what really happened and why it was all so expertly stepped over by the politicians.\nOne thing we do know: The violence didn't stem from that ridiculous video that the president and Mrs. Clinton blamed.\nYou can imagine Hillary appearing before the committee Oct. 22 and telling Congress what she told them the last time about Benghazi:\n\"What difference, at this point, does it make?\"\nFrowning and posturing on the \"Today\" show with Savannah Guthrie, being handed laugh lines, pounding the table theatrically, playing the wounded Hillary confounded by mean Republicans — that isn't being held to account.\nTestifying before Congress is being held to account, especially a committee she may have lied to, run by a former federal prosecutor, U.S. Rep. Trey Gowdy, the South Carolina Republican who's been noting all the inconsistencies and half-truths that have been coming out about her email business.\nGowdy told The Washington Post that McCarthy had apologized to him repeatedly.\n\"Yes, he's apologized as many times as a human can apologize. It doesn't change it. It doesn't fix it. The only thing you can say is, instead of listening to someone else's words, why don't you look at our actions?\" Gowdy said.\n\"Kevin is a friend, which makes the disappointment, frankly, even more bitter.\"\nSo McCarthy went back on the air, back to Fox News, hoping to clean up his mess.\n\"Now, I did not imply in any way that that work is political,\" he said. \"Of course it is not …\"\nBecause we don't live in a universe where we could clap the iron mask on McCarthy, the next best thing he could do is take a lonely walk in the woods.\nAnd when he resurfaces like some fugitive in a bad TV series, he should find meaningful, apolitical work; perhaps as a gardener at a Trappist monastery, or as a foreman in a Flamin' Hot Cheetos factory.\nJust anywhere, anyplace, where people keep their mouths shut. Trappists have their vow of silence. It's possible that people talk at the Flamin' Hot Cheetos factory, I don't really know, but it would make sense to keep your mouth shut in a place with such fiery fumes.\nPersonally, I like him going to the Cheetos factory, bringing discount bags of Flamin' Hot Cheetos home to munch on, silently, in a one-room apartment, weeping uncontrollably while watching Fox News, whispering, through a mouth crammed with Cheetos, \"I coulda been speaker. I coulda been speaker.\"\njskass@tribpub.com\nTwitter @John_Kass\n Kevin McCarthy Hillary Clinton Trey Gowdy U.S. Congress Christopher Stevens Joe Biden", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-561572ad/turbine/ct-kevin-mccarthy-benghazi-20151007", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-560f05d4/turbine/ct-mccarthy-benghazi-hillary-clinton-parker-perspec-1005-20151002", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-56159840/turbine/ct-house-speaker-kass-met-1008-20151007"], "published": "2015-10-08T01:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T06:00:21.170+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
