Last fall, St. John Vianney opened 10-0 before losing to Delbarton in an NJSIAA Non-Public Group III semifinal.\n\"We thought we'd score more than this tonight, but we knew we would score with the wind at our backs and that we were gonna throw the ball,\" St. John Vianney head coach Derek Sininsky said. \"Obviously, Anthony and Marcque really hooked up on that pass play.\"", "external_links": ["http://www.hudl.com/athlete/3018934/anthony-brown-jr", "http://www.hudl.com/athlete/3271475/tyler-tedeschi", "http://www.hudl.com/athlete/2728805/marcque-ellington"], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T08:05:18.276+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
