The deadline for submitting it is Nov. 2.\nThe survey is part of a broader effort by Con Alma, which also has a research team conducting interviews and looking at “secondary data,” such as reports and other information, Duggan said.\nMeanwhile, the New Mexico Health Exchange, which oversees the state’s health insurance marketplace, will commission a separate survey to find out what motivates people to buy insurance. Results will be used to tailor the way it reaches out to urban and rural residents, including tribal members living on reservations.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T01:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T07:34:20.734+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
