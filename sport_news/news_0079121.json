(Photo: The Enquirer/Sam Greene) Buy Photo \nThe video is 100 percent truth, and it reveals perfection. Two possessions, 14 plays, 160 yards, two touchdowns. Seven plays and 80 yards each, symmetrical tributes to the quarterback the Bengals believe Andy Dalton is becoming. \nThese were the first two drives last Sunday against the Kansas City Chiefs . They roll out silently on a screen in Bengals quarterback coach Ken Zampese's office at Paul Brown Stadium. I've asked what is different about Dalton in 2015, on the field. \nHis off-field presence is obviously changed. Looser, more confident, a glide to his stride. Call it what you like. I'm not a football expert, but after 27 years here, I'm a decent study of personalities. Dalton's has undergone a makeover. \nHow does that translate to Sundays? Zampese lets the video run. \n\"I've got a free (pass rusher) coming at me. I'm just going to draw him to me and (throw) one over his head,'' says Zampese, describing the first play of the game. Bengals tight end Tyler Eifert jogs in motion left to right. Chiefs linebacker Tamba Hali comes full blast off Dalton's right side. Dalton lofts the ball over Hali's head. Sixteen yards. \n\"Andy has a backyard element to him that shows a feel for the game,'' Zampese says. Bengals' Andy Dalton drives Hue Jackson's Mystery Machine \nThird-and-2, Bengals 44-yard line: Dalton in the shotgun, fields a groundball snap. \"They have Hali and (Justin) Houston in there,'' says Zampese, two of the best pass rushers in the league. \"They put three other D-linemen in the game, to make sure there's 1-on-1 (matchups) across the board.'' \nNo double-teams to slow the rush. Dalton picks up the grounder, sees a backup Chiefs safety in man-to-man coverage against A.J. Green (the football version of stealing a baby's candy) and hits Green with a pass between the numbers for a 36-yard gain. \"Scrambling around, having your wits about you, then dropping a dime. That's a positive,'' Zampese says. \nThe implication is clear: In previous years, maybe Dalton gets flustered, takes a sack or makes a bad decision. This time he picks up the ball, knows who's covering Green because he saw it at the line of scrimmage before the snap, then calmly delivers a deep ball. Doc: Bengals' Andy Dalton comes of age in Baltimore \nReasons for Dalton's improvement are offered in general terms. Zampese says the QB worked harder in the offseason. The offensive staff met with Dalton after last season and said, in Zampese's words, \"We're not going to get past this unless we change what we're doing.'' \nVague references are made to the influence Dalton's wife Jordan has had on what Zampese calls \"the process.'' Marvin Lewis mentioned recently that Jordan Dalton is part of \"the team.'' In a pre-draft interview with Sports Illustrated in 2011, the interviewer asked Dalton his favorite hobby. \"Spending time with Jordan,'' he said.
