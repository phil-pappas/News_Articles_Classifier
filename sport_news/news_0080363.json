The win lifted a giant weight off of the Golden Bears shoulders, but all it did was make this week's game even bigger. \nBoth Vestal and Johnson City enter this Friday's game at 1-1 in the division. The winner will finish in second place and get to host the Class A sectional semifinals. \nWBNG E-News - Sign Up For Our Newsletter! \nComing off a win over their rivals, the Golden Bears hope they can carry over some of their play from last Friday night to this week. \n\"If we could bottle it up and carry it on to the next three weeks, we just want to be playing good football right now,\" said head coach Tank Anderson. \"A lot of guys have bought in to what we're trying to do and the guys that are hurt, guys have stepped up. Everyone is contributing and that is a key factor. To have a successful season you've got to get good efforts from guys that haven't played much and get an opportunity to make a play. That's what we did.\" \nFriday's game between Vestal and JC is at Johnson City at 7 p.m. To submit a comment on this article, your email address is required.
