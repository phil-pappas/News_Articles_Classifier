That quick start couldn't help Central pick up its first win of the season, however, as Sandburg won, 55-19.

With 5:54 left in the first quarter, Central led 13-0. \nThe tide turned when Sandburg scored the next 55 points. \nThe Eagles had a 14-13 lead at the end of the first quarter, 21-13 at halftime and 41-13 going into the fourth. Sandburg (5-1, 4-0) scored twice more in the final quarter to start the running clock. \nJoliet Central (0-6,0-4) found a way to the endzone on hard running from Ernest Grant, who dove from the 1-yard line. Grant led all rushers with 142 yards on 25 carries, 117 coming in the second half.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T07:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T16:49:17.744+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
