We've steadily improved on playing together.\"\n  Washington State (5-2, 3-1 Pac-12) beat Oregon in Eugene two weeks ago and tacked on another impressive road victory behind the arm of Falk to remain in the thick of the Pac-12 North race.\nThe sophomore completed 47 of 62 passes and had the most passing yards ever against Arizona, breaking the mark of 511 yards set by Arizona State's Ryan Kealy in 1998.\nMarks caught eight passes for 97 yards, the last one a 9-yard touchdown that put the Cougars up 45-35. Washington State recovered an onside kick to hold on for its first three-game Pac-12 winning streak since 2003. The Cougars also are 5-2 for the first time since opening that same season 7-2.\n\"Every game it seems like we're talking about this is the game and I guess when you're winning the pressure keeps getting higher and higher,\" Marks said. \"Every game I feel we're solidifying ourselves and being what we thought we were.\"\nArizona is quickly becoming less than it expected.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T18:53:07.526+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
