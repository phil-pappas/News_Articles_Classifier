This current French team, once again beset by internal strife, is a shadow of the one that produced the stirring comeback in 1999, where flair and risk-taking were its hallmarks. Under Saint-André, France has none of the panache the coach himself displayed in his playing days. Instead its game is based on its formidable pack — led superbly by Thierry Dusautoir and Louis Picamoles — doing the damage and backs carrying hard into contact. It’s a shame when you consider the match-winning potential the exciting Wesley Fofana has, if only he got the ball more often and space to work in. Prediction: New Zealand. Ireland vs. Argentina This is likely to be the closest of the quarterfinals and, again, there is not much difference in the playing styles of the two teams. Dominance in the forwards is a key feature and they like to use the scrum and lineout as the platform for attack. Ireland has perhaps the more pragmatic, less risky approach, while Argentina is now much more confident in its abilities to launch counterattacks from inside its own half than it used to be. Nicolás Sánchez and Juan Martín Hernández give the Pumas dual playmakers in the back line and the wingers Juan Imhoff, Lucas González Amorosino and Horacio Agulla have profited. Ireland, which has already lost its hugely influential captain and lock Paul O’Connell and back-row forward Peter O’Mahony to injury, and flanker Sean O’Brien to suspension, is also sweating on the fitness of Jonathan Sexton, who will be a huge loss if he is ruled out with a groin injury. Flyhalf Sexton is the conductor. He is astute at knowing when to kick for territory, when to carry the ball to the line himself and when and how to bring his other backs into play. Argentina has a good history against the Irish at the World Cup with victories in 2007 and 1999 and a narrow 16-15 defeat in 2003. Prediction: Argentina. Australia vs. Scotland Australia is in the best form of any World Cup team so far. The Wallabies have won by scoring tries. They have won on the back of dogged defense and shown that their scrum is no longer their Achilles’ heel. Star fullback Israel Folau has been underwhelming in pool play, but flyhalf Bernard Foley has not. He gave a master-class performance against England, showing he can set up and score tries as well as kick his goals. Australia has not shied away from the bruising confrontation at the breakdown, and in David Pocock it has one of the best turnover exponents in the game. But Australia has also shown skill in moving the ball quickly and putting players in space, and if it can lay the platform upfront against the Scots, it will probably have too much speed and strength for them to cope with. Scotland’s most recent success against Australia came on a cold, wet and windy night in Newcastle, New South Wales, in 2012. In an attritional match Greig Laidlaw kicked a late penalty for the 9-6 victory. It is hard to see the Scots getting another win this weekend, although they showed enough against Samoa to suggest they will at least push Australia. Scotland’s strength has been to stick to what it knows. It has played for territory and used the scrum and lineout to launch attacks. Laidlaw has kicked his goals. But with two key players — lock Jonny Gray and hooker Ross Ford — suspended for the match (pending an appeal) — it’s hard to see another upset in the cards. Prediction: Australia.
