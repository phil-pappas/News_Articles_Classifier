Defending NASCAR champion Kevin Harvick needed to win or face elimination; win he did. Harvick led 355 of 400 laps at Dover, which left some questioning how the No. 4 car was so good. Eyebrows were raised after the race when some of his competitors claimed Harvick's celebratory burnout was an attempt to cover up illegal modifications made to the car .\nMORE: Best images from Monster Mile at Dover | Charlotte betting preview\nHarvick denied any wrongdoing. He is looking for less drama at the end of this round, which consists of races at Charlotte, Kansas and Talladega.\n\"I think if you can win in a first‑round situation, you can definitely put yourself in a position to get those guys on the team that mental break they need,\" Harvick said Tuesday at a Chase media day. \"You want to do all that you can do at Charlotte and Kansas just because you don't want to lead into Talladega, as much as you can try, just for the fact that there's so much out of your hands.\"\nThe Chase standings have been reset with all 12 eligible drivers now holding 3,000 points. After the Contender Round, eight drivers will advance to the Eliminator Round before the final race at Homestead-Miami Speedway on Nov. 22.\nThe Xfinity Series will join the Sprint Cup at Charlotte, while the Camping World Truck Series will take a week off before returning with the other two series at Talladega on Oct. 24.\nTV schedule (all times Eastern) Thursday, Oct. 8\n1:30 p.m.: Sprint Cup practice, NBCSN\n3 p.m.: Xfinity Series practice, NBCSN\n5:30 p.m.: Xfinity Series final practice, NBCSN\n7:20 p.m.: Sprint Cup qualifying, NBCSN\nFriday, Oct. 9\n3:30 p.m.: Sprint Cup practice, NBCSN\n4:45 p.m.: Xfinity Series qualifying, NBCSN\n6:30 p.m.: Sprint Cup final practice, NBCSN\n8 p.m.: Xfinity Series Drive for the Cure 300 (200 laps, 300 miles), NBCSN\nSaturday, Oct. 10\n7 p.m.: Sprint Cup Bank of America 500 (334 laps, 501 miles), NBC\nSprint Cup: 2014 Bank of America 500 race recap Harvick dominated the race, but the the real fireworks spilled over from the track into the garage.\nBrad Keselowski hit Denny Hamlin's car on the cool-down lap and the two drivers had words after the race, with Hamlin having to be restrained by his crew.\nKeselowski also hit the cars of Matt Kenseth and Tony Stewart on pit road after the race, igniting a fight with Kenseth and the two teams. Kenseth chased down Keselowski and leaped at him between two haulers. The two crews scuffled and had to be pulled apart as Kenseth was restrained.\nJeff Gordon finished behind Harvick, followed by McMurray, Joey Logano, Kyle Busch and Kyle Larson.\nCarl Edwards will go for the season sweep of Charlotte as will his Joe Gibbs Racing team. Hamlin won the (exhibition) All-Star race at the 1.5-mile track a week before Edwards’ victory in the rain-delayed Coca-Cola 600.\nShould Edwards, Hamlin, Kyle Busch or Kenseth win, it would mark the 11th win for Joe Gibbs Racing in the past 15 Sprint Cup races.\n2014 Bank of America 500 race results (Start position in parentheses)\n1.

Lines were painted on the track to avoid any confusion about where the lead driver can hit the throttle when coming to the green flag.\n— Of the 113 points races run at Charlotte Motor Speedway, dating to June 1960, the winner has started in the top five 64 times. On 15 of those occasions, the winner also started from the pole.\n— Team Penske’s Joey Logano and Brad Keselowski have made the Contender Round of the Chase for the second straight season.\n— Hendrick Motorsports boasts a track-record 18 Charlotte victories.

Elliott is second in the standings, 24 points behind Buescher, and Smith is third at 36 points back.\nThe series is ending this season on the same five tracks on which it ended last season, Elliott (8.8) and Smith (12.0) had better average finishes at those tracks than Buescher (12.8). That may not be enough, however; Buescher has held the points lead for 19 consecutive races.\nFour drivers will be pulling double duty at Charlotte, racing both Friday and Saturday: Kahne, Kyle Busch, Keselowski and Austin Dillon.\nCamping World Truck Series The Truck Series will be back in action Oct. 24 at Talladega Superspeedway with the Fred’s 250 powered by Coca-Cola.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.sportingnews.com/nascar/story/2015-10-06/kevin-harvick-cheat-at-dover-nascar-side-skirt-chase-standings", "http://www.sportingnews.com/", "http://linemakers.sportingnews.com/article/4657434-nascar-odds-charlotte-betting-lines-bank-of-america-500-favorites-harvick-kyle-busch", "http://www.sportingnews.com/photos/4657260-dover-aaa-400-photos-monster-mile-chase-kevin-harvick-wins-danica-patrick-jimmie-johnson-trouble/slide/362664", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "http://twitter.com/CLTMotorSpdwy/status/651831359846154240?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T14:47:07.639+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
