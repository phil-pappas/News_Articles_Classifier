Senh Duong (Founder) San Francisco Chronicle , Saturday - 10/10/2015 - 01:00 AM \nTight end Vernon Davis, who hasn’t missed more than two games in a season since he was a rookie in 2006, will miss his second straight game Sunday because of a knee injury. On Friday, head coach Jim Tomsula didn’t mention Davis when he opened his news conference by providing updates on the 49ers’ injured players. In other injury news, left tackle Joe Staley (knee) and wide receiver Quinton Patton (concussion) are listed as questionable. After playing just 54 snaps in the first three games, Jimmie Ward returned to the slot-cornerback role he had last year as a rookie and played 63 snaps against the Packers. Ward, a first-round pick, primarily covered Packers wide receiver Randall Cobb and limited him to five catches and 44 yards. Giants wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr., who has 115 catches, 1,622 yards and 14 touchdowns in the first 16 games of his career. The injury delayed his training-camp debut this summer, but Ward said his health wasn’t why he averaged just 18 snaps in the first three games.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T08:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T09:09:57.929+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
