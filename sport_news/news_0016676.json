He was examined by doctors Sunday but no prognosis was announced.\nCoach Jim Caldwell said Monday in his weekly press conference that Levy was evaluated again by team medical staff earlier in the day but didn't reveal whether Levy might miss more games in the short term or be shut down for the remainder of the season.\n\"Obviously the doctors will make that final determination when they look at him closely and make an evaluation and see where he is,\" Caldwell said.\nDETROIT NEWS\nCaldwell on Ford family: 'They're not happy'\nBefore the season, Levy signed a four-year extension worth $33.8 million beginning next year, but played only the first two preseason games before missing the next six weeks because of the hip injury.\nWith Levy back, the Lions deactivated linebacker Kyle Van Noy — a move that Caldwell explained was because of the needs on special teams.\n\"(It's) simply because of the fact that Levy was back and you can only keep so many linebackers up,\" Caldwell said, \"and when you look at it from a special-teams standpoint, he's still a valuable part of our team, but with his role on special teams, some other guys are a little more prominent.\"\nWhen asked about whether he was concerned with Van Noy's development, Caldwell said that players come into their own at different times.\n\"It takes a little time,\" he said. \"It took Levy a few years to get to the point where he was a consistent guy; that's the norm.\"\nRod.Beard@detroitnews.com \nTwitter.com/detnewsRodBeard", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T16:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T21:48:37.824+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
