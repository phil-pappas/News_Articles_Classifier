Western Branch trailed the second-ranked Tigers by two points with 1:42 left with the ball on the Oscar Smith 14. Facing fourth-and-2, the Bruins opted not to go for a go-ahead field goal. Instead, they stuck to their running game, which had been successful for much of the night. But linebacker Keshon Artis stopped running back Brandon Byrd for no gain with 1:36 left to help the Tigers beat Western Branch 23-21 and extend their streak to 79.\n\"My other linebacker, Dekireon Turner, called out the play and we just slid over and I just saw the hole and I filled it,\" said Turner, a sophomore. \"We know there's going to be adversity, but you have to fight through it and not give up until the game is over.\"\nLast week, a punt return for a touchdown in the final minute helped Oscar Smith rally past Indian River.\n\"I'm worn out; I'm spent,\" Tigers coach Richard Morgan said with a chuckle. \"That's two weeks in a row that they left everything on the field.\"\nOscar Smith and Western Branch traded scores in the first half. The Tigers did it with a touchdown run from Kourtney Johnson and a TD pass from quarterback Shon Mitchell to Larry Chapel. The Bruins scored twice on runs by running back Keith Bryant.\nThe Tigers struggled to slow down Bryant and Byrd, forcing Morgan to switch up his defensive front in the second half.\nOscar Smith forced Western Branch to punt to start the third quarter. The Tigers ended up getting a 21-yard field goal from Cameron Luster to take a 17-14 lead.\nWestern Branch, however, took the lead in the fourth quarter on Byrd's 5-yard touchdown with 9:45 left.\nOscar Smith battled back when Mitchell threw a 17-yard touchdown pass to Josh Gray, but the Tigers missed the extra point, making it 23-21 with 4:37 left.\nWestern Branch responded by marching to the Oscar Smith 14, where it faced fourth down.\n\"We had been gaining yards,\" Bruins coach Greg Gibson said of his decision to go for the first down. \"That's my call. I felt we were moving the ball and they made a good play. That's the way it goes.\"\nMorgan thought the Bruins might go for the field goal, but understood Gibson's decision.\n\"They were getting 5 to 6 yards a clip for awhile, so it was a good call to go for it,\" he said. \"Our kids just made a great play.\"\nThe close call was little solace for a dejected Western Branch team.\n\"There are no moral victories in the football,\" Gibson said. \"We had a chance, but we didn't convert on fourth down. But the kids fought hard, though.\"\nLarry Rubama, 757-446-2273, larry.rubama@pilotonline.com , Twitter: @LHRubama\n[X] Click a thumbnail to view the full-size image.

Oscar Smith has won 79 consecutive regular-season games. After losing to Hickory in 2006, the Tigers won one game that season, then rattled off eight straight 9-0 seasons in the district. Oscar Smith's six wins this season give them 79.
