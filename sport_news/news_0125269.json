When he booked that date for the show, the Buckeyes' game with Penn State had not yet been set for prime time. \nHe wasn't disappointed. \n\"It went better than expected,\" he said. \"We had close to 1,000 fans, and I think they enjoyed us bringing in a couple of bigger names (representing Strong Style Martial Arts near Cleveland) from Ohio.\" \nIn some corners, Longood was losing his fight in the second round until he was able to execute a takedown and work on Young from the ground, locking in an arm bar for the submission with 43 seconds left in the five-minute round. \n\"I'm just trying to finish any way possible,\" said Longood, 26. \"Arm bars seem to be more common lately.\" \nIt was his fourth straight win at bantamweight, raising his record to 3-0 as a pro and 10-0 overall in Mansfield. But he's got a ways to go to get his streak to where the Buckeyes' streak is now. \n\"There's nothing like going in there and winning for my city and performing for my family and friends, especially the RFO,\" Longood said. \"I'm fortunate to call Mansfield home.\" Buy Photo \nRevelation Fight Organization founder/promoter Matt Trukovich leaves the cage with a signed photo of himself presented by fighters and supporters during Saturday's Big Guns 17 MMA show in Fairhaven Hall. Next August will mark the 10th anniversary of the RFO. (Photo: Mitchell Pe Masilun/News Journal) \nLongood now lives and works in Columbus, representing the Ronin Training Center in the cage. \n\"There are opportunities to fight all over Ohio, including Columbus,\" Longood said, \"but RFO is my home and I know how Matt and (his wife) Melissa treat their fighters. I feel safe with them.\" \nLongood, who had to drop some 30 pounds from his usual walking weight to squeeze into the bantam class, said this was his toughest cut yet. Which made the pizza and milkshake afterward taste particularly good. \n\"I didn't have both of them at the same time,\" he said with a laugh, \"but I would have if I could have.\" \nIt was Longood's first fight since he won by arm bar submission in the main event of the Big Guns 15 show in March. In that sense, it was deja vu. But this fight was more challenging because of everything he overcame in addition to the battle put up by Young. \n\"I would have liked to stay busier, but injuries kept me out of the picture a little bit,\" he said. \"I hurt my collarbone in that last fight that kept me out for a couple of months and then, after I came back from that, I had some other injuries I had to fight through. \n\"I went into this fight not very healthy, with a bad left shoulder and sprained ankle. I always feel fortunate to get a win, but I knew this one would be really tough because of everything I was up against.\" \nThis show was both challenging and rewarding for Trukovich as well. In the process of putting together what he initially called a \"Super Bowl\" card, Trukovich lost eight fighters because of injuries or other issues. He scrambled to get what was originally a 16-fight show back to 14, only to lose one of his pros, Strong Style rep R.J. Buck, 10 minutes before his bout with local favorite \"Karate\" Mike Williams. \nBuck, who has dealt with knee issues, separated his knee while throwing a kick in the warm-up area. \n\"It was a totally freak thing, and he was the biggest ticket seller on the card,\" Trukovich said. \"It was a bad stroke of misfortune.\" \nThough he felt Buck's pain, Trukovich's was eased considerably moments later when he was called into the cage to receive a framed photograph of himself signed by fighters and supporters in gratitude for all his RFO has done for the sport. It caught Trukovich by surprise. \n\"Right after I found out what happened to Buck they pulled me into the cage,\" he said. \"It was quite a roller coaster of emotion.\" \nSaturday's show had something to please everyone's tastes. Fans of quick strike attacks were treated to one knockout and three TKOs — one of the latter by lightweight pro John Gunther (3-0), who represented Strong Style and used to fight locally for the now-disbanded Fight Farm.

(Photo: Mitchell Pe Masilun/News Journal) \nFor those who prefer their drama drawn out, five of the eight amateur fights went beyond the first round and three were unanimous decisions, including Gemma Sheehan's win over Allison Ainley in the only female bout. \nNext August will mark the 10th anniversary of the RFO. \nShows such as this one and Big Guns 16, held in the Akron suburb of Tallmadge in August, have re-energized Trukovich. The show in Tallmadge drew attention from Fox 8 News in Cleveland. He hopes to keep doing one show there to complement three local shows each year. \n\"My goal was to do 10 years and be done, because it's a lot of work,\" Trukovich said. \"But it's starting to pick up momentum. The shows are bigger and better, and we're getting noticed by sponsors. So I don't see us stopping anytime. The fighters, when they presented me the picture, told me not to stop. We've got a lot more to accomplish.\" \njspencer@nncogannett.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T13:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T15:28:22.056+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
