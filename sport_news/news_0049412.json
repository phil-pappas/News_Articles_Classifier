LOUIS -- The Chicago Cubs, who adopted mostly a \"big ball\" approach this season by mashing 171 homers and finishing next to last in the National League in sacrifice bunts at 32, played the smallest of \"small ball\" for most of the second inning Saturday in which they scored their first runs (five) of the series.\nOwing to an impressive Cubs bullpen effort and much stouter defense, those early marks proved to be enough for a 6-3 series-tying win over a suddenly power-dominant Cardinals team in Game 2 of the National League division series.\nBut, with runners at first and third and one out in the Chicago second, the Cardinals, leading 1-0 after Matt Carpenter's first-inning homer, had manager Joe Maddon and his Cubs backed into a corner. Or so they might have thought.\nMaddon had made his pitcher, Kyle Hendricks, the No. 8 hitter, the first starting pitcher to be listed as the No. 8 hitter in a postseason game. So the Cardinals pitched around No. 7 hitter Miguel Montero, issuing a one-out walk.\nThen, the Cubs went into nickel-and-dime mode.\nHendricks bunted toward the mound and Austin Jackson, seeing contact, sprinted from third to the plate. Cardinals left-hander Jaime Garcia, whose back was slightly turned away from the plate when he gloved the bunt, would have had to backhand a flip to catcher Yadier Molina and decided against it, with no surety of getting Jackson. But, after deliberating what to do next, Garcia, now flat-footed, winged a throw past first baseman Brandon Moss.\nJackson scored and the other runners wound up at second and third.\nIn the spirit of the moment, Maddon squeezed again with Addison Russell, his shortstop who was hitting ninth. The bunt went to the right of the mound, where Garcia, tracking it down, had only a play at first as Montero scored.\nDexter Fowler bounced a single over the head of Garcia, scoring Hendricks, and then Jorge Soler, who had doubled in the first, lined a two-run homer.\nEarlier in the inning, Jackson, who had been kept alive when second baseman Kolten Wong's double-play relay squirted away en route to somewhere in the vicinity of first base, stole third off Garcia, whose day soon would end when he departed with a stomach virus.\nHendricks, relieved by left-hander Travis Wood, left early himself after allowing three homers, including back-to-back, 400-foot-plus drives by Wong and Grichuk in the fifth. Hendricks struck out seven.\nWood, with 21/3 spotless frames, gained the win as the Cubs positioned themselves for a chance to go ahead in the best-of-five series when they send red-hot right-hander Jake Arrieta against the Cardinals' Michael Wacha in Monday's late afternoon third game at Wrigley Field in Chicago.\nAll three Cardinals runs came on homers as Matt Carpenter homered in the first before Wong and Grichuk, who was pinch hitting, homered in the fifth.\n(c)2015 St. Louis Post-Dispatch\nVisit the St. Louis Post-Dispatch at www.stltoday.com\nDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.\nShare Comment", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/baseball/s-1735855&hashtags=ArcaMax", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/baseball/s-1735855&h=Cubs+even+series+with+6%2D3+victory+vs%2E+Cardinals", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/baseball/s-1735855"], "published": "2015-10-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T14:20:46.845+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
