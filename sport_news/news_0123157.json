Cranes were used to lift the barrier sections off the car before Sainz was placed into an ambulance on a stretcher. He was conscious and moved his arms.\nThe session was red-flagged immediately after the crash with more than 20 minutes remaining and canceled shortly afterward.\nÂ© (AP Photo/Luca Bruno Ferrari driver Sebastian Vettel of Germany steers his car during the first free practice at the 'Sochi Autodrom' Formula One track , in Sochi, Russia, Friday, Oct. 9, 2015.
