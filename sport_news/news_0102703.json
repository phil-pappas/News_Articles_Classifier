Perhaps mindful of the joy that Sevilla had found on the flanks during their 2-1 Champions League defeat at City on Wednesday, United looked to move the ball wide quickly, with Antonio Valencia — preferred to Matteo Darmian at right-back — squandering two early crossing chances.\nMartial again lined up wide on the left for the hosts and he offered a threat each time he took possession, drawing fouls from Fernandinho and City skipper Vincent Kompany that each yielded bookings. At the other end, Raheem Sterling had a shot blocked by Phil Jones, while as the half drew to a close Yaya Toure saw a free-kick deflected off-target and then headed wide from the corner.\nWayne Rooney, playing the day after his 30th birthday, did not get a sniff up front for United and was required to leave the pitch for treatment after a clash of heads with Kompany, who returned to City's starting XI after six weeks out with a calf injury.\nUnited reached half-time having failed to register a single attempt at goal.\nIn the second half, Ander Herrera saw a shot deflected behind and then had a strong penalty appeal turned down after getting his foot caught between Sterling's legs, while Chris Smalling's looping header was almost turned in by Morgan Schneiderlin.\nShortly after, Marcos Rojo's halfway-line interception unintentionally turned into a through-ball for Juan Mata, but Joe Hart sprinted from his line to clear.\nSeeking an out-ball, Pellegrini sent Jesus Navas on for Sterling -- his hat-trick against Bournemouth last weekend a distant memory -- while for United, Lingard and Marouane Fellaini replaced Mata and Bastian Schweinsteiger. City's next change was more surprising, with talisman Toure giving way to centre-back Martin Demichelis, who took up a role in midfield.\nWhen one of the goalkeepers was finally tested, David de Gea had no trouble gathering a tame curler from Navas, but Lingard went closer minutes later when he hared onto Martial's delicately flighted pass and used the outside of his right foot to send a volley against the bar.\nUnited belatedly tested Hart in the 88th minute, but the England goalkeeper showed sharp reflexes to claw away Smalling's shot from Fellaini's knockdown.\nMeanwhile, Harry Kane scored a hat trick to propel Tottenham to a 5-1 rout of Bournemouth. Hosts Bournemouth took the lead through Matt Ritchie after only 49 seconds, but Tottenham equalized through Kane's first goal from the penalty spot in the ninth minute.\nMousa Dembele put Tottenham ahead eight minutes later and Erik Lamela then tapped in Kane's cross for Tottenham's third goal. Kane converted a cross from Christian Eriksen for his second goal of the game. He completed his hat-trick after Bournemouth goalkeeper Artur Boruc parried the ball to his feet from Toby Alderweireld's header.\nOn Saturday, French duo Olivier Giroud and Laurent Koscielny headed Arsenal to a 2-1 victory over Everton by seizing on porous defending twice inside two minutes in rainy London.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T11:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T05:26:45.132+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
