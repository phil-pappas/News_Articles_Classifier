The Golden Bears sacked Falk seven times and hit him twice more. All of those sacks, 2 1/2 by Kragen, made it necessary for Falk to attempt longer passes to get back the lost yardage, which in turn gave the Cal defense more time to rush the quarterback. 8 : Difference maker \nWSU forced the Golden Bears into third-and-10 with nearly two minutes left. Cal needed to risk stopping the clock with a pass, or likely give the ball back to WSU by running the ball and forcing a timeout. Cal converted when Goff squeezed a pass through the defense to receiver Trevor Davis, who gained 12 yards and a first down. WSU didn’t get the ball back until 20 seconds were left.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T10:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T12:40:15.237+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
