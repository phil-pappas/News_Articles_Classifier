(Photo: 13News Now) CONNECT TWEET   \nNORFOLK, VA -North Carolina A&T running back Tarik Cohen rushed for 152 yards and a touchdown and also threw a scoring pass, helping the visiting Aggies pull away for a 27-3 win over Norfolk State on Saturday afternoon at Dick Price Stadium. The Aggies (4-1, 2-0 MEAC) remained unbeaten in conference play while handing NSU (2-4, 2-1) its first MEAC loss of the season. The Spartans also had their two-game win streak snapped in the process. \nA&T led 10-0 at the half on the strength of Lamar Raynard's 26-yard first-quarter TD pass to Malik Wilson and Cody Jones' 30-yard field goal in the second quarter. But the Spartans got right back into it on their first drive of the third quarter. Quarterback Greg Hankerson Jr. hit DeAndre Sangster for a 58-yard gain into Aggie territory. Cameron Marouf capped the possession with a 28-yard field goal to bring NSU within 10-3 with 10:44 left in the third quarter. But A&T's Tony McRae returned the ensuing kickoff 53 yards into NSU territory. Five plays later, Cohen scored on a 3-yard TD run to double the Aggies' lead. \nThe Spartans went three-and-out on their next drive, and A&T continued to add to its lead. On 4th-and-2 from the NSU 6, Cohen took a pitch from Raynard and lobbed a 6-yard TD pass to Denzel Keyes to increase the Aggies' lead to 24-3 with 4:56 left in the third quarter. Jones tacked on a 38-yard field goal later in the quarter as A&T outscored the Spartans 17-3 in the period. Neither quarterback had much success throwing as both defenses played well. A&T's Raynard, who didn't start the game, played most of the way and completed just 10 of 23 passes for 118 yards. Hankerson completed 11 of 28 for 129 yards and was sacked seven times. \nCohen, the preseason MEAC Offensive Player of the Year, carried 36 times en route to his 152 yards and also caught four passes for 27 yards. For NSU, Gerard Johnson had a team-high 36 rushing yards, Markice Street made a team-best four receptions and Sangster had three catches for 83 yards. Jeremy Taylor had two of the Aggies' seven sacks. Angelo Keyes had three tackles for loss and one sack. \nDeon King led NSU's defensive effort with a game-high 15 tackles, 1.5 for loss. Anthony Smith had 10 tackles and Brandon Walker chipped in with nine. Chris Lee and Walter Brantley had one sack apiece. D'Metrius Williams intercepted a pass and deflected two others.  //on.wvec.com/1LooziF TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T01:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T01:57:04.634+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
