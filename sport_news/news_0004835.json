EAST at AMES \nAbout East (4-3, 1-2): These Scarlets shouldn't have any animosity from last year's odd cancellation in this game; they just need a win. Thomas Jefferson helped put East back on track in Week 7, allowing efficient offense, defensive momentum and big plays such as Gerald Sama's two punt-return scores. Now, coach Greg Schoon's team has to carry that on the road. \nAbout Ames (2-5, 1-2): This isn't the season the Little Cyclones imagined, but it's still salvageable. Southeast Polk shut down the Ames run game last week — 35 carries for 79 yards — and pulled away late. Seniors Micheal Agabaje and Colby Shane have kept up their production and will have to keep leading this young team to ensure an eighth straight playoff berth. \nC.B. THOMAS JEFFERSON at No. 7 ANKENY \nAbout Thomas Jefferson (1-6, 1-2): The return to central Iowa comes against the highest-ranked opponent of the season. The Yellow Jackets lost 41-14 at East last week, unable to muster much outside of their downhill run game. Fixes might start with special teams: T.J. has allowed three punt return touchdowns in the last two games. \nAbout Ankeny (6-1, 3-0): The fifth win in a row was maybe the most convincing one yet for the Hawks. Sophomore Drew Hill opened the scoring last week at Sioux City North with a punt return, and he and Chris McLeod each finished with two touchdowns. It's all working for Ankeny right now. \nSOUTHEAST POLK at SIOUX CITY NORTH \nAbout Southeast Polk (4-3, 3-0): The offense that managed just 30 total points on a 0-3 start is averaging 49 per game in district play. The Rams ran wild on Ames last week as quarterback Thomas McLaughlin paved the way for 622 total yards, throwing for 244 and three touchdowns and rushing for 109 more. \nAbout S.C. North (1-6, 0-3): Six straight losses are tough to swallow. Ankeny added a bitter pill last week, outgaining the Stars in the first half, 311 yards to 15. Both of Deion Clayborne's scores came after halftime, when 128 yards to receiver Tavian Williams had little impact. District 2 \nSIOUX CITY EAST at D.M. NORTH \nAbout S.C. East (4-3, 1-2): A welcome win would lock up another playoff spot. The Black Raiders have lost back-to-back outings following a four-game win streak, including last week's 28-21 defeat at Lewis Central. Quarterback Connor Koza showed his ability, throwing 39 times for 287 yards, but three picks undid the effort. \nAbout North (1-6, 1-2): This season is already a success for the Polar Bears. Snapping the 30-game losing streak against Roosevelt last week means North can focus on learning over the last two weeks, and building on the run game that has shown promise. Quarterback Noah Lane had 185 yards and two touchdowns rushing in the emotional Week 7 win.

ROOSEVELT \nAbout Dowling (6-0, 3-0): Coach Tom Wilson came away from last week's 35-15 win over Johnston with plenty to correct and fix. The Maroons will have two weeks to implement those ideas — cleaning up the passing game and utilizing defensive depth — and stay healthy. \nAbout Roosevelt (0-7, 0-3): How crushed will coach Mike Holland's team still be from its loss to North? The Riders played all four city rivals this season and were swept by a combined 17 points. Zayne Smith and Korbin Blankenship continue to make the run game go, and will need to move the chains against Dowling. \nC.B. LEWIS CENTRAL at JOHNSTON \nAbout Lewis Central (5-2, 2-1): This second-place showdown was made possible by Kenny McMahan's 70-yard go-ahead touchdown run against Sioux City East last week. The Titan defense forced turnovers when it got pushed back and needs similar production against a grinding Johnston offense. \nAbout Johnston (5-2, 2-1): Outside of Gannon Svestka's kick return and a pair of interceptions, the Dragons didn't move it much against Dowling last week. It was Johnston's first tough district test, and there's talent and time to hold on to home-field advantage and find the right answers. District 3 \nD.M. LINCOLN at D.M. HOOVER \nAbout Lincoln (4-3, 2-1): The young, thin and patchwork offense was finally locked down by Centennial last week, but the Rails are still in the driver's seat for third place and a playoff spot in coach Derek Summy's first year. The defense has hung tough, and Lincoln was narrowly put on the continuous clock for the first time. \nAbout Hoover (4-3, 1-2): Someone has to win the Sioux City West at Council Bluffs Abraham Lincoln game, so the Huskies could use this win to safeguard a playoff spot. Dom Marschel had 225 yards and two touchdowns receiving in Hoover's win over the Lynx last week. \nANKENY CENTENNIAL at No. 2 W.D.M. VALLEY \nAbout Centennial (5-2, 3-0): It's about time for the big game on Centennial's district slate. The Jaguars have blasted their last three opponents — sophomore Chance Gibbons scored four touchdowns in Week 7 — and are coming off a shutout of Lincoln. Just how much have they improved from non-district play? \nAbout Valley (6-1, 3-0): Since losing to Dowling, the Tigers have outscored their opponents 186-25. Continuous clock and reserve players have been heavily involved. That's helped create balance when the starters are in, sharing touches and reps that should benefit Valley's health and depth. Register reporters Chris Cuellar and John Naughton look at the top matchups across the state. District 4 \nMASON CITY at INDIANOLA \nAbout Mason City (1-6, 0-3): The two-point conversion could have made District 4 a mess and turned the Mohawks into the party-crashers of Week 7. Instead, down 21-20 to Urbandale with 2:02 left, the try failed, and Mason City has to regroup from a painful almost. \nAbout Indianola (3-4, 0-3): No time is left for moral victories. The Indians have lost three straight and qualifying for a fourth consecutive postseason is in jeopardy. They kept fighting and didn't turn it over at Waukee last week, but the run game was shut down and the playoffs were pushed just out of arm's reach. \nMARSHALLTOWN at URBANDALE \nAbout Marshalltown (3-4, 1-2): Senior receiver and punter Seth Heinrichs was the busiest Bobcat in last week's shutout loss to Fort Dodge, catching five passes in the struggling offense. The defense has to offer some help; Marshalltown has forced just two turnovers in district play and only Kyler Ladehoff had more than five tackles. \nAbout Urbandale (4-3, 2-1): If the close call at Mason City doesn't scare the J-Hawks, the potential for a fourth-place slot should. Urbandale ran just 40 offensively plays last week, with Vernon Cheatem and Alex Newberg taking 21 of them on the ground for 111 yards and two touchdowns. \nNo. 4 FORT DODGE at No. 9 WAUKEE \nAbout Fort Dodge (7-0, 3-0): This is the regular-season matchup that can make all the hard work and all the blowouts worth it. Fort Dodge is finally getting a ranked foe, fresh off a 42-0 demolition of Marshalltown that included 281 rushing yards by Sam Cook. The best Dodger season in decades could be even better with a win. \nAbout Waukee (5-2, 3-0): Kayde Penn scored three touchdowns and Adam Rose had 117 receiving yards and two scores just one week after Daniel Ray rushed 42 times for 260 yards. The Warriors haven't allowed more than 14 points in a district game. It's fair to say Waukee's offense and defense are finding their way, and this huge tilt will see just how far they've come.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T21:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T11:02:43.406+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
