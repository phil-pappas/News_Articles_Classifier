PETERSON AP Sports Writer   10:01   10:01   \nPeople: \nTexas (1310) \n\nMajor League Soccer dubbed the last day of the regular season \"Decision Day\" for good reason. \nWith 10 matches in the span of some four hours, there were six playoff spots still up for grabs, as well as two knockout-round byes, and the Supporters' Shield winner still to be decided. \nThe Eastern Conference playoff field was set following Sunday's early matches. Toronto FC benefited from an expanded postseason field, earning the sixth and final playoff spot in the conference. It is the team's first trip to the playoffs in nine years. \nEthan Finlay scored twice and the Columbus Crew routed visiting D.C. United 5-0 on Sunday to secure second place and a knockout-round bye. \nThe Montreal Impact beat Toronto 2-1, with Didier Drogba scoring twice inside a minute early in the second half, to earn the third seed. The two teams will meet again in the knockout round on Thursday in Montreal. \nNew England earned a spot as the fifth seed with a 3-1 victory over New York City FC. The Revolution will play fourth-seeded United on Wednesday at RFK Stadium. \nExpansion Orlando City FC fell 1-0 at Philadelphia. The Lions went into the game with a very slight chance to make the playoffs, but they needed New England to lose while making up an eight-goal differential. \nThe New York Red Bulls, playing in a later match at Chicago, had already secured a playoff berth in September and were guaranteed the top seed in the East regardless of the outcome of the regular-season finale. \nBut the Red Bulls were still wrestling with FC Dallas for the Supporters' Shield when the day started, and won the award for league's best overall record with a 2-1 victory over the Fire. \nDallas, which had secured the top seed in the West, defeated San Jose 2-1 to knock the Earthquakes out of the playoffs. \nThe Vancouver Whitecaps also earned a knockout-round bye with a 3-1 victory over Houston. \nDarlington Nagbe scored twice for the Portland, which defeated Colorado 4-1 to finish in third place. The Timbers will host sixth-place Sporting Kansas City on Thursday night. \nKansas City edged Los Angeles 2-1, sending the fifth-seeded Galaxy to fourth-seeded Seattle for a knockout match on Wednesday night. The Sounders beat Real Salt Lake 3-1. \nThe winners of the knockout-round matches go on to face the top seeds in a two-legged playoff. \nThe Decision Day games were clustered together with just two starting times — 5 p.m. and 7 p.m. EDT — for the first time. \nAll content copyright ©2015 Pendleton Times-Post, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T04:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T04:08:03.080+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
