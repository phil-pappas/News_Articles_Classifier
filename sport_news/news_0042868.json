(Getty Images) \nThe National League, for the last 11 years, has been primarily dominated by three teams: The Giants, Dodgers and Cardinals. Other teams have won the World Series, namely the Phillies in 2008. (The Dodgers haven't actually won one, a factoid their fans are perhaps a bit familiar with.) But these three franchises have been the established order. Only once since 2004 has the NL Championship Series not involved any of those teams. Of those 11 years, here's how many times each of those teams have been in the NLCS: \n• St. Louis Cardinals: 7 (three wins)• San Francisco Giants: 3 (three wins)• Los Angeles Dodgers: 3 (zero wins) \nIt has not been a particularly enjoyable decade for parity in the NL. In the American League, just about everyone has gotten a turn in the ALCS; the only teams who haven't in the last 11 years are the Twins, the Mariners and the Blue Jays (assuming you don't count the Astros, who played in the 2004 and 2005 NLCS). But in the NL, it has been the big three. If the Cardinals were to somehow come back against the Cubs in the NL Division Series, they themselves will have played in 11 of the last 20 NLCS. That doesn't leave a lot of room for interlopers. \nThe Mets and Cubs have been to the NLCS a combined one time in the last 11 years, the Mets' brutal 2006 NLCS loss to the Cardinals. Their last decade has been virtually nothing but pain. After that loss, the Mets collapsed down the stretch to miss the playoffs entirely the next two seasons, and they hadn't returned until this year. The Cubs, before 2015, have made the playoffs only twice since the infamous '03 Bartman game, and the last time they made it, they were swept in '08 (by the Dodgers, naturally). \nAnd now, starting at 4:30 p.m. ET Tuesday, all that can be turned upside down. The Cubs, after hitting six freaking homers on a wild, windy night at Wrigley, can advance to their first NLCS since 2003 if they can top the Cardinals one more time. And the Mets, in front of a lunatic crowd that might have matched that Pittsburgh Wild Card Terrordome crowd of 2013, can do the same thing if they can figure out how to beat Clayton Kershaw for the second time this series. \nNaturally, this disrupting of the established precedent is making the Cubs and Mets extremely popular. Both teams are young and exciting, with fan bases who have waited a long time for something to cheer about. And their opponents' success has led to exhaustion and resentment, particularly in the case of the Cards, who are being cheered for in the NLDS by St. Louisans and a few surrounding areas and virtually no one else on earth. This is the best story going in sports right now. \nAnd it can all be settled tonight, in front of the home crowd. The Mets play their second-ever playoff game at Citi Field. The Cubs attempt to clinch their first-ever postseason series at Wrigley Field, an astounding fact considering Wrigley Field is more than 100 years old. This is the pivot game, the one when the team that lacks home-field advantage attempts to clinch the series at home to avoid hopping back on a plane for a decisive Game 5. How does this typically work out? Let's take a look at the last 16 times this game has happened, and who won. We do not have to go far: It literally happened twice Monday. \n• 2015 ALDS: Rangers up 2-1 on Blue Jays at home; LOST, 8-4.• 2015 ALDS: Astros up 2-1 on Royals at home: LOST, 9-6.• 2014 NLDS: Giants up 2-1 on Nationals at home: WON, 3-2.• 2014 NLDS: Cardinals up 2-1 on Dodgers at home: WON, 3-2.• 2013 NLDS: Pirates up 2-1 on Cardinals at home: LOST, 2-1. (Lost Game 5 in St. Louis)• 2013 NLDS: Dodgers up 2-1 on Braves at home: WON, 4-3.• 2011 ALDS: Tigers up 2-1 on Yankees at home: LOST, 10-1. (Won Game 5 in New York)• 2010 ALDS: Rangers up 2-1 on Rays at home: LOST 5-2. (Won Game 5 in Tampa)• 2008 ALDS: Red Sox up 2-1 on Angels at home: WON, 3-2.• 2006 NLDS: Cardinals up 2-1 on Padres at home: WON, 6-2.• 2006 ALDS: Tigers up 2-1 on Yankees at home: WON, 8-3.• 2005 NLDS: Astros up 2-1 on Braves at home: WON, 7-6.• 2004 NLDS: Astros up 2-1 on Braves at home: LOST, 6-5. (Won Game 5 in Atlanta.)• 2003 NLDS: Cubs up 2-1 on Braves at home: LOST, 6-4. (Won Game 5 in Atlanta.)• 2003 NLDS: Marlins up 2-1 on Giants at home: WON, 7-6.• 2002 ALDS: Angels up 2-1 on Yankees at home: WON, 9-5. \nWe'll see what happens in the two ALDS Game 5s on Wednesday, but one thing is undeniable: Going up 2-1 nearly always wins you the series when you're the team that's home in Game 4. Of those last 14 times it has happened, the team trying to clinch at home has won the series 13 times. Nine times they went ahead and won in Game 4; four times they went on the road and won Game 5. \nThis is to say: The Mets and the Cubs are in extremely enviable positions right now. Even if you take context out of it -- who's pitching, who's healthy, what the home-field crowd is like -- 13 of the last 14 times this has happened, the team in their position won. \nNow, that context matters. Both the Mets and the Cubs arguably have the pitching disadvantage Tuesday. The Cubs send out Jason Hammel, easily their worst starter, against John Lackey, the dominant Game 1 starter who is pitching on three days' rest. The Mets will start rookie Steven Matz to face none other than Kershaw, also on three days' rest. The Dodgers arguably have the (slight) pitching advantage in a theoretical Game 5 at Dodger Stadium, with Zack Greinke against Jacob deGrom, unlike the Cardinals, who would be facing Jon Lester with … well, no one seems to know, exactly. And with the crowd hyped up to nuclear levels at both Wrigley Field and Citi Field on Tuesday, one would think the time is right for them both to clinch at home, in front of their fans, desperate to lose their minds while they can. It is all set up for them now. And if recent history is any guide, even if those teams lose Tuesday, they're still in good shape. They have taken a stranglehold of control of this series. Which means they've taken control of the National League. \nThe Mets and Cubs have been stepped on for a decade now by the Cardinals, the Dodgers, the Giants -- and even the Phillies. On one day, in full display of their screaming supporters, they can take the power back. It could all change today. The gears of change grind slowly. But they do grind. \n* * * Email me at leitch@sportsonearth.com ; follow me @williamfleitch ; or just shout out your window real loud, I'll hear you. Point is, let's talk.
