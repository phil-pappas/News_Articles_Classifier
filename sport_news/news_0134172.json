Sophomore quarterback Sean Holland has played well both running and throwing for the Panthers, who were also bolstered last week by the return of back Collin Morrow. South's best chance may be to control the ball and play keep-away from Gervais & Co. rather than get into a shootout. \nNashua North (2-2) at Man. Central (3-1) \nWHEN: Friday, 7 p.m. \nWHERE: Manchester's Gill Sta­dium. \n2014 Result: Did not play. \nLAST WEEK: Manchester Central beat Concord, 27-17; Nashua North topped Nashua South 47-27. \nFYI: There's a lot to consider for this one. First, North has estab­lished that Devin Leonard is a major weapon on offense after his 252 yards on the ground against South. But the Little Green defense shut out Concord in the second half last week after being down 17-7 at the half. Also, Central may try to take the ball out of Leonard's hands with long drives - it chewed up nearly the final nine minutes of its win last Friday. Watch out for Central QB Anthony DiMauro,who tossed two TD passes last week. This is not the same Little Green that got blown out by BG in the opener. \nBishop Guertin (2-2) at Alvirne (0-4) \nWHEN: Friday, 7 p.m. \n2014 RESULT: Bishop Guertin 32, Alvirne 14 (regular season); Bishop Guertin 27, Alvirne 9 (playoffs). \nLAST WEEK: Bishop Guertin 54, Keene 8; Goffstown 51, Alvirne 14. \nFYI: The road continues to get tough for the injury ravaged Broncos, who will be pressed to keep up with Guertin'sup-tempo style, although possible wet weather may slow BG's pace. Cards quarterback Jordan Hiscoe and receiver Nick Lorden con­tinue to be a formidable pair, hooking up for three TDs last week. The Broncos have been outscored 99-20 their last two games. It may be a night again for some of the Broncos' younger players, including Kishon Chapman (two TD runs last week). \nPinkerrton (4-0) at Merrimack (3-1) \nWHEN: Friday, 7 p.m. \n2014 RESULT: Pinkerton 37, Mer­rimack 0. \nLAST WEEK: Pinkerton 35, Lon­donderry 20; Merrimack 37, Dover 18. \nFYI: This will be a big adjustment for the Tomahawks, having played a small Dover team last week and then having to deal with one of the state's best teams with plenty of depth. 'Hawks QB Justin Grassini continues to have a good junior season (318 yards, three TDs last week) while the Astros are led by senior running back Brett Datillo. All he did last week in the Astros' 17th straight win over Londonderry was rush for 169 yards, 73 on a TD run. \nDIVISION II \nSouhegan (3-0) at Windham (4-0) \nWHEN: Saturday, 2 p.m. \n2014 result: Windham 35, Souhe­gan 20. \nLAST WEEK: Souhegan 50, Hollis Brookline 7; Windham 38, Sanborn 21. \nFYI: The Sabers are having one of their best starts to a season in recent memory, led by the rushing Joe Nogueira and Cam Kinney. But Windham will be a big step up from facing a young, undermanned Hol­lis Brookline team. It's still about a month to go in the regular season, but one might argue the winner here has the inside track on the eventual top spot in the South conference. \nMilford (3-1) at Lebanon (4-0) \nWHEN: Saturday, 6 p.m. \n2014 RESULT: Milford 35, Lebanon 14. \nLAST WEEK: Milford 27, Pelham 6; Lebanon 45, Kingswood 14. \nFYI: The Spartans, after losing to Souhegan, got back on track last week with a good ground game led by Mark Madigan's 123 yards. But the name to remember for the traveling Spartans is Lebanon's Ryan Milliken. All he did last week was rush for 195 yards and two scores plus enjoy an 85-yard kickoff return. \nJohn Stark (1-3) at Hollis Brookline (1-3) \nWHEN: Saturday, 2:30 p.m. \nWHERE: Hollis Brookline High School. \n2014 Result: Hollis Brookline 7, John Stark 6. \nLAST WEEK: Souhegan 50, Hollis Brookline 7; Monadnock 20, John Stark 10. \nFYI: The Cavaliers are hoping to have a few more players than they did last week against Souhegan, when injuries cut the roster down to 29. The Generals are no pushover, as they lost to Milford by just a touchdown and put up 27 points on Windham and scored 56 in their lone win vs. ConVal. Stark led Monadnock 3-0 at halftime; their only TD came from the arm of backup QB Cooper Gorski, who came in due to injury in the second quarter. Thus, they've shown they have some depth. \nDIVISION III \nCampbell (1-3) at Epping-N'market (1-3) \nWHEN: Saturday, 3 p.m. \n2014 Result: Campbell 29, Epping- Newmarket 6. \nLAST WEEK: Bow 46, Epping-New­market 6, Winnisquam 35, Campbell 21. \nFYI: Epping-Newmarket's attack is modest, led by top rusher Alex Toribio (222 yards in his first three games), and Jeremy Epso (7.7 yards a carry). Hunter Hannon continues as the Cougars' main threat, throwing for 118 yards and two TDs last Friday while running for 79 yards.
