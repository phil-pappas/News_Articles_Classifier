(JOE SONGER) Comments \nHoops on the Haasephalt has drawn thousands of UAB basketball fans over the last three years, but Blazer men's basketball coach Jerod Haase didn't want to get complacent with the event. \nThursday's version, the fourth, will be different. First off, the location will change from a parking lot to UAB's Campus Green. The main event starts at 7 p.m. and WBC heavyweight champion boxer Deontay Wilder will be the featured guest. A makeshift basketball court will be put together to show off the men's and women's teams, band and spirit groups in various ways. \n\"Haasephalt has taken a life of its own,\" said Haase, going into his fourth year as UAB's head coach. \"I will say that it was important going into this year that we keep the name but rebrand the product. \n\"The product, I felt, had gotten a little monotonous, will certainly be some elements that are the same but really we're trying to give it a different feel and a different flair. I think to this point, we've done that.\" UAB head coach Jerod Haase previews preseason practice Haase returns most of his team from last year's NCAA Tournament team. \nMembers of the UAB men's and women's team will be introduced. There will be a 3-point shootout involving members from both teams, and a few men's players will compete in a slam dunk contest. \nBut this is Homecoming week at UAB, so moving the location was essential. \n\"It is something that we want to give a new look and a new feel for it,\" Haase said. \"Being on the Green on the center of campus is important. The biggest thing is that it's new and fresh and an exciting start to the season.\" \nRELATED: UAB picked to win Conference USA \nThis will be women's coach Randy Norton's third time to showcase his team at the event. Like everyone else, he's trying to figure out how Haase will make his grand appearance. He's come in on a mustang, helicopter and motorcycle in the last three seasons. \nHaase joked that he'd come down from a Goodyear blimp this year. Or was it a joke? You'll find out at Haasephalt. \n\"I have no idea how he's coming in this year,\" Norton said. \"It's a great event and now that they've built it around Homecoming week, I'm really excited to get the fans and students and all the teams and programs there. It's a great way to get both of our seasons started.\" \nFireworks will cap off the evening. Wilder, coming off his 11 th round TKO of Johann Duhaupas in Birmingham last month , will be a slam dunk contest judge. \nThis is also a big recruiting event for UAB. Sophomore preseason all-conference standout William Lee was at the 2013 event, and junior forward Tyler Madison committed at the first event. \nOther featured guests and dunk contest judges include former UAB basketball standout Mo Finley, Jerod Haase's son Gavin and ABC 33/40 meteorologist James Spann. Lauren Sisler of CBS42 will serve as event emcee.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T01:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T05:21:40.953+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
