He was one of a few players to sprint inside to either escape the cold or get their hands on the barbecued pork that was being served up inside the locker room.\nRobinson, who partially tore his pectoral muscle in the spring, had just spent the morning running on his own then watching his teammates practice without him, which has been his routine for a couple of months now.\n“It hasn’t been hard but of course you don’t really enjoy it,” the 24-year-old said. “You just try to get better and I can’t wait to get back out there.”\nRobinson might not have to wait much longer. He could join his Vikings teammates on the Winter Park practice fields as early as next Wednesday.\nAccording to NFL rules, the Vikings are able to remove Robinson from the PUP list next week if they feel he is healthy enough to resume practicing. Once they do, they have three weeks to add him to their 53-man roster.\nTechnically, the Vikings get a five-week window, which starts next week, during which to remove Robinson from the PUP list. But Robinson, who he feels “pretty good” today, is optimistic it will happen soon, saying, “We’ll work on getting cleared next week when I’m able to come back.”\nIf the Vikings choose to add Robinson to their 53-man roster, they will then have to make a corresponding roster move. They have six cornerbacks on the roster right now. One is Jabari Price, who has yet to dress this season.\nIn addition to Robinson, center John Sullivan could return to practice next week, too. Sullivan, who had back surgery in September and was placed on short-term injured reserve, is eligible to resume practicing next Wednesday, though he is unable to suit up for a game until Week 9.\nOlder Post Getting to know the Chiefs with veteran beat writer Adam Teicher", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T21:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T23:16:23.323+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
