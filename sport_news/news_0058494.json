That was the day his fading Washington Redskins lost to the Buffalo Bills 24-7 at Ralph Wilson Stadium, the day Buffalo’s last-ranked offense outgained his team 432 yards to 169. A low point? Abandoned puppies have better days. “I've been frustrated a lot before, but this was one of the lows,’’ Spurrier said. “It seems like we lost our fight, lost our drive.\" Spurrier always was good at reading his gut. His Redskins would finish that year 5-11, prompting him to resign after just two seasons in the NFL, leaving $15 million of his then-record-for-a-head-coach $25-million contract on Daniel Snyder’s desk. But the NFL’s loss was college football’s re-gain. Let’s face it. Steve Spurrier was never a great NFL quarterback and he wasn’t a great NFL head coach. But he was a great college quarterback (Heisman Trophy winner at Florida in 1966) and he was a great college coach (turning Duke, Florida and South Carolina into winners). And how fortunate we all were that Spurrier returned to the college game, putting the South Carolina Gamecocks back on the map these past 11 seasons picking up where Lou Holtz left off. And how we’re going to miss the fun-loving \"‘ol' ball coach.'' As is his nature, Spurrier, 70, abruptly resigned late Monday, bringing to an end one of football’s most successful and colorful playing and coaching careers that has spanned more than half a century. With so many coaches of his era – heck, every era – afraid to say what’s really on their minds, Spurrier – always the life of the party -- let it fly like the footballs in his “Fun and Gun’’ offense at Florida during the 1990s. Today, writers who covered him and opponents he coached against, guys who had their noses tweaked plenty, are remembering with fondness his many one-liners, all made in the spirit of gamesmanship. He once said Florida State University (FSU) stood for “Free Shoes University.’’ He called Georgia coach Ray Goff, “Ray Goof.’’ He said Tennessee quarterback Peyton Manning returned for his senior year because “he wanted to be a three-time star of the Citrus Bowl.’’ He even suggested that if Nick Saban wanted to be known as the greatest college coach of all time, he’d have to win a national title at someplace other than Alabama which never hurts for top talent and has won titles under four other coaches. Saban didn’t necessarily agree with everything that spewed from Spurrier’s mouth, but he respected that Spurrier had the courage to say it. \"A lot of times, it probably needed to be said,\" Saban told ESPN’s Chris Low. Spurrier’s coaching accomplishments speak for themselves. A record of 228-89-2 at three schools with one national title (1996, Florida). A total of 208 SEC victories, second only to Bear Bryant’s 292. A nine-time coach of the year in the ACC and SEC. The first person to win a Heisman and coach a Heisman winner (Danny Wuerffel). Three 11-win seasons at South Carolina, which isn’t exactly, well, isn’t exactly Alabama. And while he didn’t succeed in the NFL, he sure sent a lot of players to the NFL – 104, including 27 currently in the league. The numbers, however, aren’t what Spurrier’s legacy is about. It’s about the fact that he gave every team he ever coached its swagger (even the Redskins). And that he kept it fun. Leave it to Spurrier to make his short, to-the-point resignation news conference on Tuesday an uplifting event. “First of all I’m resigning, I’m not retiring,’’ he said. “I doubt if I’ll ever be a head coach again, but maybe coaching a high school team or something, so don’t say retired completely from coaching.’’ Some will always look down on any coach who quits on his team midseason. But I can give Spurrier a pass. That’s because he was true to himself and true to his school, telling people for years that at his age, he’d step aside if his team was no longer responding to his coaching. With the Gamecocks at 2-4 and 0-4 in the SEC, that time had arrived. “It was just two years ago when we were fourth in the nation … and somehow or other, we’ve slid and it’s my fault, I’m responsible, I’m the head coach and it’s time for me to get out of the way and have someone else have a go at it,’’ he said. He said at his age he had become a liability on the recruiting trail, even though any 17-year-old kid and his parents would still be awestruck to be looking at the Steve Spurrier sitting in their living room sipping a soda. So rather than be shown the door, Spurrier reached for the door knob. And showed us what being accountable looks like, something in short supply in the sports world. “Back in 2004, I was the best coach for this job, but not today and that’s the cycle of coaching,’’ he said. “Sometimes you run your course and it’s ready to pass to the next guy. That’s where I am today.’’ It’s a sad day, and a happy one. Spurrier admitted that he envisioned going out on the “shoulder pads of my players’’ after a final bowl victory. But that’s for the movies. And he has no complaints. And just to prove he never takes himself too seriously, Spurrier thanked his wife of nearly 50 years, Jerri, for NOT being there when he said goodbye. “It’s time to move on and my wife Jerri – who is the biggest reason for my success as a head coach -- she has a class today,’’ he said. “She’s getting her degree in psychology in December, so she didn’t have time for this silly little press conference we got going on right now.’’ There have been lots of football coaches. There was, make that is, only one Steve Spurrier. Some high school is going to get one heckuva of an ol' ball coach. \nSouth Carolina head football coach Steve Spurrier speaks at a news conference to announce he is resigning on Tuesday at the University of South Carolina, in Columbia, S.C. Spurrier said he felt he needed to step down now because he doesn't believe there is accountability with players if they know the coach won't be back next year. He also said he was a recruiting liability.
