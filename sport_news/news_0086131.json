(Photo: Duane Rankin/Advertiser) \n\"I don't need it.\" \nYes you do, President Boyd. Yes you do. \nAlabama State president Gwendolyn Boyd said during a deposition on July 9 regarding Reggie Barlow's wrongful termination lawsuit that she didn't need to have background or knowledge about NCAA compliance when asked by attorney Donald Jackson if she did. \nIt's more fun to keep up with first downs, touchdowns and victories, but a university president must know NCAA rules to know what to watch, monitor and observe. It helps prevent a university from being in the situation Alabama State is in right now. \nASU has confirmed it's conducting an internal investigation on the football program at the request of the NCAA regarding allegations it had spring practice this year under first-year coach Brian Jenkins when it couldn't due to low Academic Progress Rate results. Those APR results happened under Barlow, who coached eight seasons at ASU before being fired three months after signing an extension. \nThis comes after former players and assistants at Bethune-Cookman when Jenkins coached there alleged mistreatment of players, improper benefits and excessive practices in a Montgomery Advertiser article in February. Through the deposition, it was also revealed the NCAA is investigating Bethune-Cookman for alleged rules violations during Jenkins' final season in 2014. \nWhen you have a coach who has those type of allegations hanging over his head, regardless of how success he has been, you must stay on top of everything he and his staff do on your campus. Everything. Boyd saying she doesn't have to know background or knowledge of NCAA rules is careless because violating NCAA rules can set a program back years, and schools can't afford that because it costs schools millions to maintain a program. \nSo Boyd can show up for an open practice all smiles as she did during preseason camp this year, but she better start learning the ins and outs of NCAA compliance. \nIn the depositions, Boyd initially said ASU is in the Southwest Atlantic Conference, when it's in the Southwestern Athletic Conference. She later says in the deposition calls it Southwest Athletic Conference. So that's closer, but not quite correct. \nThe average football fan may not have known that either. Boyd should, but when your attitude toward something is what Boyd's appears to be based on the deposition, is this really a surprise? She can't solely rely on her staff to know everything because if it all hits the fan, everyone looks at the person in charge. \nASU athletic director Melvin Hines also stated in his deposition that allegations of exceeding the weekly 20-hour practice time limit during Barlow's final semester (Fall 2014) were part of the internal review. So all of this is under Boyd's watch. \nNow you could say Boyd has more important matters to worry about than who's practicing when and how long they're practicing, but if Jenkins and his staff are found guilty of the allegations regarding spring ball, Boyd should take charge of the situation. \nThe NCAA isn't going to let ASU conduct a lighthearted investigation. So Boyd should be right in there and take a leadership role in finding out what's been going on with one of the most important components of university. \nAs is the case throughout the country, there are very important and influential people who don't have a clue about microbiology or forensics, but they care about football, especially down here in the south. Even studies have shown students enroll at schools because of the football program. \nFootball generates millions of dollars. Football is something people take pride in because it's a representation of the university to people as a whole. No offense, but you couldn't fill a football stadium to see an art exhibit no matter how talented the student is. \nNow ASU football is out there once again for the wrong reasons. For ASU's sake, I hope its president at least cares about that.
