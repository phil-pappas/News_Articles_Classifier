Related Rainbow Warriors improve to 2-1 on... \nAs popular as football is to watch, less high school students are signing up to play. \n\"It's probably based on safety concussions, all the things that are coming out,\" said Rich Miano, a former high school football coach. \nFootball's been taking a lot of hits lately. Three high school deaths on the mainland and two varsity teams on Oahu are done for the season after a combination of injuries, lack of players and inability to compete. McKinley High School had two games this season, losing by a combined score of 168-to-nothing. \n\"They need to make sure schools are in their proper divisions so that it's a safe game, it's a competitive game, and then everybody wins,\" said Miano. \nAnuenue head coach Kelii Pio Adams pulled the plug on the season even before it started. Many of the players on the varsity squad were only freshmen. \n\"It was best for the students, the kids. A lot of them are young,\" said Adams. \nMore and more parents are leery of the violent nature of the sport. The state's trying to make it safer, requiring training for coaches and trainers before the season kicks off. \n\"Hawaii does a great job. There's athletic trainers on the field, there are doctors on the field, but there are other states that do as good, but yeah, the game needs to become safer,\" said Miano. \nSafer tacking techniques are part of the overhaul. \n\"I think it's going to lead to more injury prevention, proper tackling, because local boys like to hit with their heads,\" said Adams. \nEven with safety precautions in place, it's ultimately up to the student and parent to decide whether or not football is the right sport. \n\"It will always be a collision sport, not a contact sport,\" said Miano. \"And when you're talking collisions, you're talking potential injuries.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T06:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T06:34:58.234+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
