Kind of this was our second game this week, and we played two days ago, had a really good game, came from behind and Yuma Catholic is really good.” \nRadic said his T-birds played the Shamrocks in a tournament game at Lake Havasau High School earlier this season. \n“We knew if we didn’t step it up and play our best game, it would be really tough,” Radic said. “But, I’m really proud of the girls because they started to play smart from the first point to the end of the game, they never laid down, they played like they were the best team.” \nThe 17-2 overall Arizona Interscholastic Association Division IV, Section III Lady T-birds remained undefeated in their section at 4-0. Yuma Catholic is now 7-7 overall, and 1-3 in Section III, according to aiaonline.org and maxpreps.com .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T10:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T11:04:29.875+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
