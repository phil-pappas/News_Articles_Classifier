It's just go out and play and quiet him with the way we go out and win on Sunday. That's what we want to do.''\nWhat made Manziel, who will start Sunday against the Tennessee Titans, so upset? Here's what Hoge said on Monday's SportsCenter:\n\"He's so sloppy fundamentally,'' Hoge said. \"He was reckless at A&M, he's reckless in the NFL. He doesn't play in structure. He doesn't understand concepts and it was very evident in this game. Missed a lot of hots (hot reads). If you go to the throw, why would the ball sail inside vs. outside. If you watch his footwork, because really the guy he's going to is the guy he should (go) to. It's man on man and you've got the ball and it's third down. This is open in the NFL, but watch his footwork, watch how sloppy it is.\n\"He doesn't have a strong enough arm anyway, that's why the ball sails to the outside. Then the reckless aspect of it. He is protected across the board here. There is no reason to run. You know it's third and long, but you have a better shot throwing it within the structure and design of the play than you do in running. Even during the course of the game, do remember the one throw where (Brian) Hartline made a great catch, they blitzed him. He was supposed to throw it hot. The tight end was wide open and he runs.\n\"It's very elementary: He's not gotten better in two years.''\nAsked if the problems can be corrected, Hoge said, \"No. It comes down to this: Here's what was happening in that game. He fell back to what he trusts. His instincts. What is his instinct, and you're never going to change that.\n\"That is who he is. He's going to run. That's what he's believed in, he's won a Heisman Trophy for, and that's what he's going to go to when he needs it the most, when you need structure, you need discipline to come out, he's going to be erratic and reckless and run. And that's never going to change.\n\"Cincinnati, Pittsburgh and Baltimore, they love the plan that Cleveland's under. Keep going down that plan. Because all you do is set your organization back one more year by babysitting this guy as your starting quarterback so keep doing that for the other team. But if you want to move on, cut bait, get another guy in there and go in another direction -- immediately. Cut bait. Move on.\"\nOn Twitter:\n @SportsDayDFW", "external_links": ["http://www.cleveland.com/browns/index.ssf/2015/09/johnny_manziel_5.html", "https://twitter.com/SportsDayDFW"], "published": "2015-09-19T02:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T14:56:55.669+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
