Tied 14-14 at the half, Huntingdon (4-1, 2-0 USA South) scored 35 straight points to open the second half and pick up its third straight win. “We started fast and were playing well and then we hit a little lull in the second quarter and they got back in the game,” Huntingdon head coach Mike Turk said. “But we were able to get things going again in the second half. “We have some work to do on our execution, but we’re getting there. We’re playing hard and that will help you win games. We’re going to enjoy this win on the bus ride back, but when we get back to Montgomery in the morning, we’re going to be focused on getting ready for LaGrange.” The Hawks did most of their damage with the running game, rushing for 396 yards and seven touchdowns on 51 carries. The 396 yards are the second most rushing yards in a game in Huntingdon history. The Hawks rushed for 414 yards against Principia in 2008. Huntingdon rushed for 392 yards earlier this season against Louisiana College. “We still have a lot we have to improve on, but we ran the ball effectively today,” Turk said. “We played well and were able to handle them up front. That was a concern going in, but from the start of the game, we were able to have success running the ball.” Running back John Iwaniec scored on a 6-yard run and Jay Ware scored on a 5-yard run in the first quarter to give the Hawks a 14-0 lead. In the third quarter, tied 14-14, quarterback Luke Bailey connected with Darius Dawsey for a 32-yard touchdown play. Bailey, Iwaniec, Ware and Vic Jerald closed the scoring for Huntingdon. Bailey made it a two-touchdown game with a 20-yard touchdown run in the third quarter before Iwaniec capped a 60-yard drive with a 1-yard touchdown run. In the fourth quarter, Ware scored on a 13-yard run and Jerald scored on runs of 2 and 40 yards. While the ground game was keeping Ferrum (1-4, 1-1 USA South) off balance, the Huntingdon defense forced three turnovers and limited the Panthers to 299 yards of offense. Senior defensive back Anthony White accounted for all three turnovers with three interceptions. The three interceptions tied the Hawks’ single-game record set by Keith Anthony against LaGrange in 2009. White now has nine career interceptions and is tied with Bryan Wells as the Hawks’ third all-time interception leader. “A. White came up with three interceptions tonight and all of them were big,” Turk said. “All three of those turnovers led to points. The second one was especially big. We had just gone ahead by 14 points and they were driving into our territory. A. White picked it off at our 8-yard line and returned it to near midfield. That was a big swing. “Their quarterback (Troy Helton) is a good player and he made some plays, but overall I was proud of the way our defense played. We had a good plan going in and the kids executed it. In the second half especially, we were able to stop them and have field position in our favor.” Senior linebacker Jake Green led the defense with nine tackles and two tackles for loss. Freshman linebacker Trey Hayes added seven tackles and senior defensive lineman Heath McCray finished with six tackles. Offensively, Bailey led the Hawks with 104 yards on 10 carries. Iwaniec added 88 yards on 13 carries, followed by Ware with 71 yards on 11 carries, Lorenzo James with 70 yards on nine carries and Jerald with 69 yards on seven carries. Bailey finished with 160 yards passing. Nick Haas led the receivers with three catches for 52 yards. Freshman kicker Chris Young was 8-for-8 on extra points. Huntingdon hits the road again next weekend, traveling to LaGrange on Saturday for a 5 p.m. game.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T07:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T17:18:58.641+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
