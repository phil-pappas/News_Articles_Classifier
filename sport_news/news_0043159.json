Players Gaby Bedrosian and Ema Bandazian and team manager Kristina Bedrosian also shared their family stories: \nGaby and Kristina Bedrosian \nThe Bedrosian sisters’ ancestors were fortunate to live in modern-day Armenia, which bordered what is now Turkey – the site of most of the atrocities in the Ottoman Empire. But like many Armenians, they assisted their countrymen in peril. \nGaby and Kristina’s great-grandmother, Nazloo, smuggled guns, hand grenades, ammunition and anything else that could help – hidden under her dress – into Turkey, according to the family. Nazloo’s son, his wife and their 4-year-old son also ventured to help. \nNazloo’s son and his wife were killed, but her grandson survived. He was taken in by an Arab family and lived with it for three years. \nAfter the genocide, Nazloo sent a search party of relatives into Turkey, and they were able to locate her grandson. He spoke only Arabic, but was able to recite the Lord’s Prayer in Armenian. \nGaby and Kristina Bedrosian's mother, Liliana, was Armenia's top amateur tennis player and a member of its national team in 1993 before coming to the United States. Liliana wound up playing collegiately at Virginia Commonwealth. She now is the director of the Park Ridge Tennis Academy, and her husband, George, is the president. \nEma Bandazian \nDetails of Bandazian’s great-grandfather, Khoren, are sketchy. The memories were apparently too painful to share, as he almost never spoke of them. \nWhen the Turks came into his family’s home region of Kharpert, Khoren was 8 years old and attending school. A Turkish woman who was a friend of the family took him out of school to protect him. The rest of his family was either killed or abducted. Among those who lost their lives were his parents and great-grandparents. \nEventually, Khoren was smuggled to Beirut, Lebanon. He made his way to France, New York City and finally Virginia, where he lived to the age of 86. \n— Bob Shwalb  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T08:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T19:51:31.525+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
