In addition to the eventual winning bid of the visor, Pinkel will also donate $1,000 to the Rainbow House in Columbia. The emergency shelter is aimed at providing support for victims of child abuse and neglect. Fun story on Coach @GaryPinkel 's visor: http://t.co/ZGcER36LoW Bid now to win his from Saturday's win: http://t.co/ygYvGZDC5n #MIZ ! â€” Mizzou Football (@MizzouFootball) October 5, 2015 \nThe eventual winner of the bidding will receive a considerable amount of compensation in regards to the Missouri football program. The VIP Fan Experience will include a behind-the-scenes tour of the Missouri Athletic Training Complex, a meet and greet autograph session with Pinkel and multiple players, and a partaking in dinner with the team. \nThe sport of football can often bring people together for a good cause, and Pinkel is demonstrating the premise with this gesture.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T20:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T21:03:48.949+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
