The grounds that we play at are smaller.” \nMatching up against the greater physicality of sides in League One and below could be the answer, and although the early rounds may not necessarily draw the crowds, there’s potential to play in front of some big numbers in the latter stages.

Going all the way to a Wembley final with the kids, what better way to replicate it? \n“The under-21s league will return back to what it used to be, which was really competitive football. I think we’ve lost a little bit of the edge by trying to replicate it, but we’re missing something in between. If rules are done like that, it would lift the clubs. \n“So I can understand the gaffer’s frustration and I can understand it having a foot in both camps because the Premier League is a ferocious beast at the moment and it gets bigger and bigger every year, the players get better and better every year. Tactically, there’s no room for error, and that’s why the young lads have to be at such a good standard.” \nDespite the manager’s misgivings over the under-21s league, Moore says Pulis is watching the youngsters with a close eye and, once a week, they get thrown under his gaze in a game against the first team. \n“The gaffer does like them in there,” said Moore. “He’s getting a good look at them. It comes towards the end of the week, and they get half an hour or an hour in front the of the gaffer.” \nAnd no wonder. James Shan’s team are currently on an unbeaten run of 11 games stretching back to last season. But there is still a huge gap to bridge. “There have been times this season that I’ve put the 21s against the first team and our lads are blowing because the first team are that good with the ball. \n“They’ve got their hands on their knees, bent over, having chased the ball for the last 40 minutes and I say ‘look at them now, they’re ready to go again, could you do that all week and then play against opposition on Saturday? Who are probably better? There’s your standard’. \n“And then it hits the message home where you’ve got to get to. Not to say that they cant get there.” \nMore involved with the first team since Pulis took over, the 41-year-old played under the Welshman at Portsmouth in 2000. \n“I’ve just helped out as and when to be honest,” he said. “That’s why you’ve been seeing me in and around the first team as well which has been good.” \nBut the crux of Moore’s job is getting the under-18s and the under-21s to make the jump into the first team. And it’s one he’s thoroughly enjoying. \n“That’s been the thing really, trying to educate the boys physically, mentally, and tactically with what’s needed when you get up into that first team,” he said. “As a player, I was once a scholar and a reserve team player so you kind of understand the mindset needed to get into it. Now I’m a coach, you can relay to the players on a day to day basis to bridge the gap to get into the first team, so it is a good position and I’m really enjoying the role.” Receive daily email updates from the Express & Star \nWe'll send a morning digest of the day's biggest news and sport stories straight to your inbox.
