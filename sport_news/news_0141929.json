Tom Coughlin stepped to the podium following his team's 30-27 victory over the 49ers Sunday night and wasted no words expressing relief in picking up a win in a game that was dedicated to ailing tight end Daniel Fells.\n\"Thank God we were able to get him a game ball,\" Coughlin said. \"That was some football game there tonight.\"\nFells, 32, missed the game as he stayed in a local hospital to be treated for a MRSA infection. He has been hospitalized for more than a week, and Coughlin last visited the veteran in his room Saturday at 7:30 a.m. Coughlin noted that Fells was keeping his spirits up, sitting upright, with his wife, and smiling at the time. He was placed on injured reserve last week, and tight end Larry Donnell believed that Fells was watching him from afar as he caught the game-winning touchdown in the back of the end zone with 26 seconds left against the 49ers.\n\"To have a guy from his room come up there and make that catch at the end of the game,\" Coughlin said, \"that was incredible.\"\nCoughlin and the team dedicated the game to Fells beforehand. Fells, now in his eighth season, had offered the offense a veteran presence as he caught six balls for 60 yards in the season's first three games. He was the best all-around option at tight end, solid in blocking and receiving. Coughlin noted that Fells had his first full night's sleep Friday into Saturday, and that he slept well again the next night.\nMRIs had come back clean in recent days. The NFL Network previously reported he underwent multiple surgeries on his foot.\n\"Hopefully he'll continue in that direction, and go home and see his kids\" Coughlin said.\nDonnell mentioned that he would be calling Fells after leaving the locker room. Donnell and Manning had worked on the play all during the week as Donnell knew he would have to take on a greater role with the offense. Donnell caught the ball after the linebacker covering him turned his back toward Manning.\n\"It just feel good,\" Donnell said, before mentioning his thoughts were with Fells. \"That's my boy. It just feels good to get him [THE WIN]. I'm gonna tell him that I love him.\"\nRelated Stories Eli Manning leads Giants down field for 30-27 win over 49ers Odell Beckham Jr. hurts hamstring, return is questionable Osi Umenyiora: Giants need Jason Pierre-Paul", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T08:10:54.819+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
