Thomas Foket then pulled the Belgians level by rifling a shot high into the Valencia net five minutes from the interval.\nThat equalizer revitalised the visitors and Valencia was second-best for much of the second period. However, a Jose Gaya drive from the left struck Mitrovic in the six-yard box and bounced over the line to spare the hosts' blushes in the 72nd minute.\nThe result sees Valencia remain three points adrift of Group H leader Zenit - which beat Lyon 3-1 - while Gent is still without a win in this year's competition.\nValencia dominated the early stages, but wild efforts from Andre Gomes and Santi Mina saw its initial pressure go unrewarded.\nSels arrived at the feet of Mina to deny the hosts a simpler shot at goal from close range after nine minutes, before Shkodran Mustafi - almost completely unmarked in the box - headed narrowly over from a corner.\nValencia eventually made the breakthrough when Feghouli bundled the ball over the line after Paco Alcacer had got a touch to Joao Cancelo's cross from the right.\nAnd the Spanish side would have been further in front had Sels not produced a superb double save - diving to his left to keep out a Gomes strike before recovering to turn Dani Parejo's follow-up behind.\nThe resulting corner led to a chance for Aderlan Santos in the center of the box, but Sels was again on hand to make the save from the defender's low drive.\nAlthough Gent did make the occasional foray into the opposition half, the threat was limited. That was until Foket got on the end of a delightful Renato Neto ball over the top and powered a left-footed effort high beyond home goalkeeper Jaume Domenech.\nAlcacer lifted the ball over Sels and the crossbar early in the second period, but Valencia's first-half dominance seemed to have deserted it. Indeed, Gent had Valencia rattled and looked capable of pulling off an upset against its more fancied La Liga opponent.\nBut Valencia got lucky. Cancelo's cross from the right bounced off the top of the crossbar and fell to Gaya, whose effort went in off the unfortunate Mitrovic.\nDomenech made a strong diving save to deny Thomas Matton as Gent attempted to restore parity and, though they continued to press, Hein Vanhaezebrouck's men were left to reflect on a missed opportunity to claim a memorable point - a dismissed stoppage-time penalty shout for a Danilo challenge on Kenny Saief rubbing salt in the wound.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "http://www.goal.com/en-us"], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T08:50:19.759+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
