Blair Walsh hasn't been able to stop his pattern of missed kicks. The defense, so good against the run the previous two weeks, surrendered a devastating 72-yard touchdown on Sunday. In a game on the road against one of the best teams in the league, the Vikings (2-2) just couldn't quite get over that hump. \nThey've started their bye week now. Their next game is Oct. 18 against Kansas City. \nOnline: \nAP NFL website: http://www.pro32.ap.org and http://www.twitter.com/AP_NFL \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T01:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T01:52:12.574+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
