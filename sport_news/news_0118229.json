Staff photo by Kelly J. Huff slideshow KENNESAW — Kennesaw State football coach Brian Bohannon is still kicking himself for what happened at Dayton last weekend.After jumping out to a 13-0 lead, and having a 20-7 advantage with the ball in the first half, Bohannon is still reliving parts of the game that resulted in a 31-27 win by the Flyers — and the Owls’ first loss as a program.“I watched the tape of the game as soon as I got on the bus,” he said. “I watched it again when we got back.“We should have won the game.”Considering no one could have predicted how Kennesaw State would play its inaugural season, that in and of itself is an indication of how well the team is progressing. Dayton is a program that had won a couple of national championships as a Division III program before moving to the Football Championship Subdivision — and one that rarely loses a game at home.Keeping that in mind, Bohannon admitted two things.First, he knew the Owls needed a loss to move forward. The team wasn’t going to go undefeated in Year 1, but now he gets to see how it responds to a defeat before Big South play starts in two weeks.Second, despite the room for improvement, he’s happy, but not satisfied.“At 3-1, I don’t think you could be disappointed (with the start),” Bohannon said.Like any coach, Bohannon is waiting for that one game where all three phases — offense, defense and special teams — perform at a high level together. Considering the makeup of the team is mostly freshmen and redshirt freshmen, he said that may not happen this year.Bohannon, however, said he has seen glimpses — 49 unanswered points against East Tennessee, a pair of fumble recoveries for touchdowns against Edward Waters and the opening play against Dayton, when Chaston Bennett went 80 yards for a touchdown.It is those kind of performances that have led to numbers that betray the fact the Owls are a fledgling, start-up program. ► Through its first four games, Kennesaw State is fourth in the FCS, averaging 324 rushing yards per game.► The Owls are one of five teams in the FCS not to allow a sack.► The team is 12th in the FCS, averaging 39.8 points per game.► The defense is third in the FCS in pass defense (130.5 ypg.), No. 7 in total defense (273.5), No. 6 in turnovers gained (10) and No. 9 in interceptions (6).“We’ve seen the football team grow in certain areas,” Bohannon said. “Just not all at the same times.“If we can continue to learn from good and bad, we can become a good football team.”That last statement is as close as Bohannon would come to characterizing the Owls at this point.“We don’t talk about wins or losses,” he said. “We just talk about getting better each week.”What Bohannon will say is the team’s start made his 2½ years as head coach — before finally getting to take the field — was absolutely worth the wait. And the reaction he, his staff and the team has received has been overwhelming.Bohannon said he is still trying to answer congratulatory emails from people around the country that have reached out to him over the last month.“The feedback, energy, enthusiasm has been through the roof,” he said. The early success, in addition to some national publicity with the team having its game-ending fumble return against Shorter being seen on ESPN, has also led to potential recruiting opportunities. “In the grand scheme of things, you have to outrecruit yourself every year,” Bohannon said. “The other stuff, all the stats and stuff out there, create a buzz. Is that good for the program? Absolutely.”Bohannon said he is most interested in how his team responds against NAIA-level Point next week at Fifth Third Bank Stadium, and he is eager to see what improvements the team makes. He thinks the jump will be large, and it will give him a better idea of whether the Owls will be able to compete in the Big South. “I think league play is going to pique their interest,” he said.It will also be the first of seven straight weeks of football to close out the inaugural season.“It’s been fast,” Bohannon said. “It’s really flying by, but it’s going to be a grind on the back end (of the schedule).” John Bednarowski is sports editor of the Marietta Daily Journal.
