He was back there for a portion of Monday's practice despite leading the team in scoring with three points in four games playing right wing.\nFlyers coach Dave Hakstol did a lot of experimenting with his third line during Monday's practice ... so much that it's hard to tell for sure who will play where in Tuesday night's 7:30 p.m. home game against the Dallas Stars.\nALSO: 5 Flyers who need to pick up game: Simmonds not getting many chances\nHakstol rotated four players in and out on the line — Scott Laughton, Sam Gagner , Schenn and R.J. Umberger, the latter of whom is healthy after missing two games with an upper-body injury.\nGagner and Schenn each got looks at center and both wing positions.\nAs practice went on, Hakstol most often was using Laughton at center with Schenn at left wing and Gagner on the right wing.\nThe Flyers won their last two games with Gagner and Schenn flip-flopped on the line with Laughton at center.\nSchenn switched from left wing to right wing late last season after Wayne Simmonds broke his leg, then finished with four goals and eight points in seven games.\nMeantime, it's looking like Umberger will sit as a healthy scratch for Tuesday's game, which will the Flyers' first in six days.\nUmberger skated on the fourth line during Friday and Sunday's practices, which led to speculation that right wing would sit out Tuesday's game.\nMeantime, it appears Steve Mason will return in goal after missing two games for a personal issue.\nThe giveaway?\nMason spent most of practice in the goal furthest from the Flyers' dressing room, the one he's always in when he's starting.\nHere is the lineup the Flyers used in practice:\nFORWARD LINES\nGreen jerseys: Michael Raffl, Claude Giroux, Jakub Voracek.\nRed jerseys: Matt Read, Sean Couturier, Wayne Simmonds.\nWhite jerseys: Brayden Schenn, Scott Laughton, Sam Gagner, R.J. Umberger.\nGray jerseys: Chris VandeVelde, Pierre-Edouard Bellemare, Ryan White, Vinny Lecavalier.\nDEFENSE PAIRS\nNick Schultz, Mark Streit\nMichael Del Zotto, Brandon Manning\nEvgeny Medvedev, Radko Gudas\n(Extra: Luke Schenn)\nRandy Miller may be reached at rmiller@njadvancemedia.com .
