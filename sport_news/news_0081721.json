He wants to do well. \n\"He has got a run in the team after not playing much this season and he wants to impress. It was a bit too much enthusiasm I would probably say. \n\"It looked like one that he could have got away with, but when you are on a yellow card you always run the risk. \n\"It is difficult against teams like West Ham with 11 men, never mind 10. We were disappointed with the result.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T16:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T20:16:50.520+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
