Cillessen hurt his back in the warmup and Krul suffered a season-ending knee injury late in the match. Krul's club, Newcastle, says he ruptured the cruciate ligament in his right knee.\nFeyenoord goalkeeper Kenneth Vermeer and Southampton's Maarten Stekelenburg are joining the squad. Blind also added Paris Saint-German defender Gregory van der Wiel, who was suspended for the 2-1 victory in Astana.\nIf they are to win a playoff berth, the Dutch must beat the Czech Republic in Amsterdam on Tuesday and hope that Iceland beats third-placed Turkey.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T18:40:52.262+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
