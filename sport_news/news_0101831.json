Here are a few highlights.\nIs this (letdown against Colorado) on the young-ish core getting drawn into the emotional ups and downs? The coaching for lack of preparation/in game calming or adjustments? The key to this team winning is not abandoning the game plan in the face of adversity.\nHeika: \"I actually thought a lot of the veterans abandoned the game plan. Lindy Ruff tries to help with changes, but sometimes that only makes things worse. It was a combination of both players and coaches not displaying poise. They are trying to learn from it, so we'll see if they do.\"\nTale of two teams, game 1 was definitely a 60 minute compete and game 2 felt like a flashback to last year. Hard to blame Antti as we gave them multiple prime scoring chances. We also tweaked our D early last year (acquiring Demers, who looks awful right now with a -2 and even in game one). I know its early, but do you see us making any moves to shore up the D?\nHeika: \"Because of where this team is with the kids, I think they want to be patient. They have two youngsters as healthy scratches and five guys in the AHL who they think can play in the NHL. Plus, Demers, Jordie Benn and Goligoski can become UFAs in the summer. This could very much be a defense in transition, so I don't think Jim Nill wants to make a trade right now. I think he wants more information. That said, the pending UFA status makes it possible to speculate that Demers, Goligoski or Jordie Benn are available for the right return. It's a tricky situation, to be sure.\"\nWhat are your thoughts on goal tending (against the Oilers on Tuesday)? I think with the showing Nemo Lehtonen had (good not great) we may be seeing Kari Niemi for the first time this year. What are your thoughts on that? Also what have they been working on with Kari do you think?\nHeika: \"I think Kari will start. Both Kari and Jeff Reese are evasive when I ask for specifics, so I'm not sure. I think Reese is working to clean up details in and around the net, particularly how Kari guards his posts.\"\nDo you think Kari is ready for Tuesday versus Edmonton? How was the team atmosphere after the game Saturday?\nHeika: \"Very solemn after Saturday. I thought Kari was ready for preseason, but the results were not good. So now, I have no expectations of him. We just want to wait and see.\"\nThe Stars are spending more money than anybody else on goalies right now. What's your early take on Antti Niemi? Do you think it's a real possibility Niemi or Lehtonen will be traded prior to trade deadline, or is 1A-1B the thing all season?\nHeika: \"The problem with any trade talk is that if either or both are playing poorly, then nobody will want them. If they are both playing well, then the plan is working and you wouldn't want to break it up. I don't see them trading Niemi, so you have to focus on Lehtonen for any potential trade talk, and he has three years left on his contract at $5.9 million. That's tough to trade.\"\nWhat has happened to this Stars team these past games? We looked great in the season opener, and have started to stumble a bit.\nHeika: \"Welcome to the roller coaster that is Stars hockey. Keep your hands and feet inside the ride at all times. This is a risky team learning to play team defense. There will be inconsistencies.\"\nDo you think our 2015-2016 Stars are going to be more like Thursday's Stars or Saturday's Stars?\nHeika: \"My guess is more like Thursday...but...Saturday allows the doubt to creep in.\"\nWhat is with Lindy Ruff's lines? Will we see Benn-Seguin-Sharp; Nuke-Spezza-Hemsky? Are players' hips hurting more than we realize?\nHeika: \"The hip thing is tough to assess. Ales Hemsky looks good. Jamie Benn is struggling a bit. I think Val Nichushkin is a 20-year-old kid still trying to learn the NHL and his hip is not a factor. The lines (Monday at practice) were: Benn-Seguin-Eaves, Roussel-Spezza-Sharp, Janmark-Eakin-Hemsky, Moen-Fiddler-Nichushkin/Sceviour. I think he wants some grit and defensive presence on every line.\"\nWill we see our top line being used in a checking role more often this year to shut down opposing top lines?\nHeika: \"I believe that is the plan, but if they move Cody Eakin down, then the top line could get fewer defensive assignments going forward. That said, Lindy Ruff still wants sound two-way hockey.\"\nMike, lots of people get bent out of shape about Ruff's line juggling. Does he really do it more than the average NHL coach?\nHeika: \"When he is winning, Ruff doesn't change much, so he is pretty consistent there. I think fans would just like more patience when they are losing.\"\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FULL CHAT.\nOn Twitter:\n @MikeHeika", "external_links": ["http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/dallas-stars/chats/2015/10/05/mike-heika-answers-stars-questions-2-pm-monday-oct-12-ask-questions-now", "https://twitter.com/MikeHeika"], "published": "2015-10-13T03:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T11:11:06.611+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
