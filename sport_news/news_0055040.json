In a curious move, the Boston Red Sox will reportedly hire former Philadelphia Phillies general manager Ruben Amaro Jr. as their first base coach.\nAdChoices Amaro, whose tenure as the Phillies GM ended in September, will join John Farrell’s staff next season, according to the Boston Globe’s Nick Cafardo .\nIt appears former Phillies GM Ruben Amaro Jr will become Red Sox first base coach.\n— Nick Cafardo (@nickcafardo) October 24, 2015\nIt’s certainly a surprise, as Amaro has been an executive ever since he retired as a player and has no coaching experience. Not only that, but he was a poor executive widely blamed for turning the Phillies from constant contenders into a last place team loaded with bloated contracts and aging, undesirable players, with a long list of bad personnel moves to his name. He also notably called out Phillies fans for not understanding the game.\nOf course, Amaro won’t have to make any personnel decisions in this capacity, and someone that experienced was always going to land somewhere. It’s just an odd fit for both team and individual at first glance.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.yardbarker.com/", "https://twitter.com/nickcafardo/status/658003538501607424", "https://twitter.com/nickcafardo/status/658003538501607424?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-10-25T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T11:32:55.851+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
