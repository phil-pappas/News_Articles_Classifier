Another player was incorrectly credited with the pickoff in Sunday’s story. \nMaryland fires head football coach \nCOLLEGE PARK, MD. \nRandy Edsall has been fired as Maryland’s football coach after the team’s third straight lopsided defeat. \nThe dismissal, announced Sunday, comes in the middle of Edsall’s fifth season with the Terrapins. Maryland is 2-4 and mired in a three-game skid in which the Terps have been outscored by a combined 122-34. Including an earlier defeat against Bowling Green, Maryland’s four losses have come by an average of four touchdowns. \nOffensive coordinator Mike Locksley will take over on an interim basis. Maryland has an open week before facing Penn State in Baltimore on Oct. 24. \nEdsall went 22-34 after taking over for Ralph Freidgen before the 2011 season. He accepted the job after going 74-70 in 12 years at Connecticut. \nUSC football coach takes leave of absence \nLOS ANGELES \nSouthern California coach Steve Sarkisian is taking an indefinite leave of absence after athletic director Pat Haden determined that the troubled coach is “not healthy.” \nHaden announced the decision in a hastily called news conference Sunday after Sarkisian didn’t attend practice. \n“I think it’s the right thing for our team, and I’ve always got to do what’s right for our team and for our school,” Haden said. \nOffensive coordinator Clay Helton will take charge of the Trojans (3-2, 1-2 Pac-12), who have lost two of their last three games. USC visits No. 14 Notre Dame (5-1) on Sunday. \nHaden wasn’t specific about the reasons for Sarkisian’s absence, only saying that “it was very clear to me” that the second-year USC coach was unwell. Haden asked Sarkisian to take a leave during a phone conversation. \nSarkisian publicly apologized before the season after he showed up drunk at the Salute to Troy pep rally and made a slurred public statement. \nDodgers’ Utley suspended 2 games \nNEW YORK \nLos Angeles Dodgers second baseman Chase Utley has been suspended two playoff games by Major League Baseball for his takeout slide that broke New York Mets shortstop Ruben Tejada’s right leg. \nIn handing down the penalty Sunday night, Major League Baseball executive Joe Torre called it an illegal slide. Umpires ruled it a legal play Saturday night. \nTorre says after a thorough review from all angles, he concluded Utley’s slide merited a penalty. \nUtley said he intends to appeal. \nStaff/wire report", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T07:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T09:17:28.870+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
