He spent two months in a psychiatric ward before being found mentally fit to stand trial.\nHis lawyer Mihkel Gaver, who plans to appeal the sentence, said during the trial in the eastern city of Tartu that there was no question Vahur committed the crime.\nBut he argued that the teacher's behaviour towards his client had been \"offensive\" and claimed Vahur was \"temporarily outraged\" when his \"suppressed emotions surfaced\".\nProsecutor Kaire Hanilene argued however that there was nothing to indicate that Sarap had provoked Vahur or harassed him in the past.\nShe said Vahur planned the murder methodically and has since failed to show any sincere remorse.\nShe is mulling an appeal of her own in the hopes of securing the maximum sentence of 10 years in jail.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T23:15:36.049+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
