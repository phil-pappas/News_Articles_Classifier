Kivit, 20, of the 400 block of South Northwest Highway, was charged with aggravated reckless driving after police say he fled at speeds close to 90 mph before crashing his car at Devon and Cumberland avenues in Park Ridge, injuring four people on June 3.\nCook County Circuit Court Judge Jeffrey Warnick allowed Kivit to be taken off electronic home monitoring at the Skokie courthouse on Oct. 14.\nBut Warnick also told Kivit's parents to forbid their son from driving and also told them to place all their vehicle keys \"under lock and key\" so their son could not access them.\nKivit had been placed on electronic monitoring after the crash as a condition of his bond, authorities said.\nPolice said Kivit was driving his red 1996 Chevrolet SUV at high speeds east on Devon and didn't stop when police activated their lights and siren about seven to nine blocks west of Cumberland.\nThey said Kivit ignored the police, running a red light at Devon and Cumberland and colliding with a 2014 Audi that was driving north on Cumberland.\nA reconstruction of the crash determined that Kivit's SUV was travelling at a speed of between 79 mph and 90 mph at the time of the crash, investigators said.\nKivit and three others were seriously injured in the crash.\nOn Wednesday, Kivit's defense attorney asked Warnick to allow his client to be taken off electronic monitoring. Warnick agreed, but said Kivit must obey all other conditions of his bond and not drive for any reason.\n\"I'm glad the parents are here in court today,\" Warnick said.\nProsecutors argued against taking Kivit off electronic monitoring, saying that people were seriously hurt in the high speed crash — including Kivit, who suffered a traumatic brain injury. Some are still recoving from their injuries, prosecutors said.\nKivit, who was in court on Wednesday but did not speak, is due back in court on November 30.\nThe officer who chased Kivit's vehicle, Mark Vallejo, was fired Oct. 6. Park Ridge Police Chief Frank Kaminski said the chase was \"unauthorized.\"\nBrian L.
