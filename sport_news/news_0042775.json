A win may not even be enough because a B.C. Lions victory over the visiting Winnipeg Blue Bombers on Saturday would eliminate the Riders from the playoff race for the first time since 2011. \nThat’s all big-picture stuff for the Riders. Their focus remains on Friday’s game and letting whatever happens afterwards unfold. \n“Just win, man, and that’s all we can focus on,’’ Riders linebacker Macho Harris said. “You just have to win and let the chips fall where they will fall. I always look at it as the next game being the most important game. I look at this game as having a lot of weight. We need to approach it like that and make the best of this opportunity.’’ \nA win today and a Lions loss on Saturday wouldn’t make it any easier down the road for the Riders. They would still have to see what happens Oct. 17 when a Lions win at Commonwealth Stadium against the Edmonton Eskimos would knock the Riders out of the playoff chase while on their bye week. The Riders would be eliminated before they even returned to practice. \n“We just have to control what we can control,’’ Harris said. “We can’t control who wins between Winnipeg, B.C. or whoever. We just have to hope for the best.’’ \nThe best would be the Riders winning each of their remaining four regular-season games and hoping that B.C., and Winnipeg and the Montreal Alouettes lose out. The Alouettes could cross over into the West Division for the playoffs. \nA successful run by the Riders is unlikely for many reasons. \nFor starters, the Riders carry a league-worse 2-12 record into today’s game against the 8-5 Tiger-Cats. Moreover, Saskatchewan hasn’t won a road game since Sept. 7, 2014 when it beat the Blue Bombers 30-24. The road-losing streak was extended to 11 games — including an 18-10 loss in the 2014 West Division semifinal — as a result of last Saturday’s 46-20 loss to the Lions. \n“That doesn’t change our attitude because we already had the attitude that we had to play every game like it’s our last,’’ said rookie defensive tackle Andre Monroe. “I felt that has been the motto since I got here. It’s not as if now is the nitty gritty because it has been down to the nitty gritty every week.’’ \nThe Riders are down to the nitty gritty as a result of their showing earlier this season. They have been close, having lost seven regular-season games by four points or less. \n“I’m not necessarily a gambler, but when you look at stuff to happen that consistently, you have to wonder what’s going on,’’ said quarterback Kevin Glenn. “Still, as football players and as competitors, you can’t worry about that kind of stuff. Any time you think about that kind of stuff, that’s when you get sidetracked from the important thing. That’s to play well. When you play well, most of the time things happen in your favour.’’ \nNOTES: Riders centre Dan Clark is out for the remainder of the season after being placed on the six-game injured list on Thursday. Clark suffered a concussion during Saturday’s loss to the Lions. Corey Watman is to replace Clark on the active roster … The CFL announced Thursday that Clark had been fined an undisclosed amount for a chop block on Montreal’s Alan-Michael Cash during a 33-21 win over the Alouettes on Sept. 27 … The Riders released defensive back Antareis Bryan, defensive lineman David Hunter, linebacker Jonathan Willard, kicker Brett Lauther and wide receiver Devin Wilson from the practice roster on Thursday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T15:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T18:58:04.098+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
