Cueto tosses gem as Royals beat Astros 7-2 in ALDS clincher KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) - Johnny Cueto knew the Kansas City Royals had wagered much of their future on him, trading away a bevy of prospects in late July so that he could pitch in moments like this.The decisive game of a playoff series, their season on the line.He responded with a masterpiece on his biggest stage yet, eight dominant innings Wednesday night that allowed the resilient Royals to rally once more for a 7-2 victory over the Houston Astros that sent them back to the American League Championship Series. \"I woke up today on the right foot,\" Cueto said. \"As soon as I woke up, I felt something magic, that this was Game 5 and I had to show up for everybody, for this team and the fans.\"Cueto allowed two hits, a single by Evan Gattis followed by Luis Valbuena's second-inning homer, before retiring the final 19 batters he faced. He struck out eight without a walk in the kind of clutch performance the Royals expected when they got him from the Reds.When Wade Davis breezed through the ninth, the Royals poured onto the field to celebrate.\"Johnny Cueto was unbelievable,\" Royals manager Ned Yost said. \"He knew the magnitude of this game. I think we all did. And he came out from the first pitch and had everything going.\"The defending AL champs will host the Toronto Blue Jays in Game 1 on Friday night. The teams have met once before in the ALCS with the Royals winning in seven games in 1985 - they would go on to beat the St. Louis Cardinals for their only World Series triumph.\"They're a great team,\" Davis said. \"It'll be a fun series to watch.\"The Royals trailed the Astros 2-1 in the fifth when Alex Rios led another comeback with a go-ahead, two-run double. Eric Hosmer and Ben Zobrist also drove in runs, and Kendrys Morales capped the festive night with a three-run homer off Dallas Keuchel in the eighth to put it away.Collin McHugh (1-1), who won the divisional series opener for Houston, allowed three runs in four-plus innings. His bullpen fared little better just two days after it blew a four-run, eighth-inning lead to send the series back to Kauffman Stadium for Game 5.\"The good version of Johnny Cueto is really tough,\" Astros manager A.J. Hinch said. \"Hats off to him. He pitched a great game. ... We didn't scratch much off him.\"Nothing, actually, after the second inning. And even that came thanks in part to a rare series of lapses by the Royals defense that briefly quieted a charged Kansas City crowd.With two outs in the second, Gattis sent a slow hopper down the line that third baseman Mike Moustakas fielded cleanly. But with plenty of time, his throw across the infield went wide, and first baseman Hosmer had the ball pop from his glove trying to make a swipe tag.On the next pitch, Valbuena sent his two-run homer streaking into the Astros bullpen.It wasn't until the fourth that Kansas City got a run back, on back-to-back singles by Cain and Hosmer. But by the fifth, the Royals had figured out McHugh's darting curveball.Salvador Perez was hit by a pitch, and Alex Gordon hit a ground-rule double to right. Hinch brought in Mike Fiers in relief, and Rios sent a double bouncing down the chalk of the third-base line, scoring two runs and giving the Royals the lead.Following a sacrifice bunt, Zobrist's lazy sacrifice fly made it 4-2.That was plenty of support for Cueto, who was acquired from the Reds for a package of left-handed prospects just before the July 31 trade deadline precisely for moments like this.Mixing quick-pitch fastballs with hesitation changeups, Cueto made the Astros look foolish most of the night. He jawed with Houston outfielder Carlos Gomez, strutted around like a Wild West gunfighter, and had the unmistakable swagger of an October ace.After all, Cueto was finally proving that he was one.\"After the homer he settled in. He was able to use deception, quick-pitch, slow us down and disrupt our timing,\" Astros slugger George Springer said. \"He's got electric stuff.\"Cueto's star turn came after going 0-2 in his first four postseason starts, including a forgettable outing in Game 2 against Houston. He allowed four runs in six innings in that game, though Kansas City's offense and its stingy bullpen ultimately bailed him out.There was no need for any help this time. Cueto was good enough on his own.\"Tonight was Cueto's night,\" Hinch said. \"We didn't get a baserunner after the second, is that right? By my book. I thought the crowd got behind him, and he pitches with emotion. He rose to the occasion. This was his night.\" By Ian Harrison The Associated Press TORONTO - Jose Bautista wiped out the need for protests or umpire reviews with the Toronto Blue Jays' biggest home run since Joe Carter's historic shot.Toronto earned its first trip to the American League Championship Series since Carter's World Series-ending drive in 1993, overcoming one of the craziest plays in playoff history when Bautista hit a three-run homer after three Texas Rangers errors for a 6-3 victory Wednesday in the deciding Game 5 of the Division Series.\"It's the most emotionally charged game that I've ever played,\" Bautista said.The Blue Jays became the third team to win a best-of-five series after losing the first two games at home. The 2001 Yankees also did it against Oakland, and the 2012 Giants did it against Cincinnati. Both of those teams went on to reach the World Series.\"The odds were against us but I don't think these guys ever thought we were out of it,\" Blue Jays manager John Gibbons said.Toronto, who led the majors in homers this season, will play the Royals, who beat Houston in Game 5 of their series, a rematch of the 1985 ALCS. Game 1 is Friday night in Kansas City.\"It doesn't really matter, we're just happy we're going to the next round,\" Blue Jays slugger Josh Donaldson said. \"Whoever we play is a very, very good opponent.\"Bautista's homer capped an event-filled, 53-minute seventh inning that took a turn when Toronto catcher Russell Martin's seemingly routine throw back to the pitcher deflected off batter Shin-Soo Choo and allowed the tiebreaking to score.\"That was crazy,\" Blue Jays starter Marcus Stroman said. \"With all that happened, we did a good job of keeping our emotions in check.\"The Blue Jays filed a protest after an umpire review ruled Rougned Odor was allowed to cross home plate. Toronto fans pelted the field with debris during the 18-minute delay.The Rangers started the bottom half by making errors on three straight groundballs, and Toronto rallied. Benches cleared twice in the Blue Jays' half of the inning.Roberto Osuna got the final five outs for his first postseason save.Osuna turned toward the outfield after striking out Wil Venable, looked to the sky and was mobbed by his teammates as jubilant fans rocked the Rogers Centre.After Edwin Encarnacion tied it 2-all with a second-deck drive off tough-luck loser Cole Hamels in the sixth, Odor led off the seventh with a single and went to third on a sacrifice and groundout.With Choo up, Martin's throw back to reliever Aaron Sanchez deflected off Choo and dribbled toward third base.Home plate umpire Dale Scott initially ruled it a dead ball but, after Rangers manager Jeff Banister questioned the call, the umpires huddled and Odor was sent home. Martin was given an error.\"I just caught the ball and threw it back very casually and it hit his bat and then next thing you know run scores,\" Martin said. \"It's never happened in my life before. It's just one of those moments, and it created an opportunity for us to do something special.\"Scott acknowledged making a mistake with his initial ruling. \"I was mixing up two rules,\" he said. \"If there's no intent, if he's not out of the box, that throw is live.\"In the seventh, Bautista hit a towering drive into the second deck, glaring as he stood at home plate to admire his go-ahead drive, enthusiastically flipping his bat away.With some fans continuing to litter the field, Encarnacion turned to face the crowd and appealed for calm, lifting his bat and helmet over his head. Dyson took exception and walked over to confront Encarnacion, leading to both dugouts and both bullpens emptying.\"I told him Jose needs to calm that down, respect the game a little more,\" Dyson said.During the scrum that was quickly dissolved, 20 Toronto police officers stood across the outfield, while others gathered along the foul lines. Police later took position on the roof of the Rangers' first base dugout before the bottom of the ninth.Encarnacion and Chris Colabello both singled when play resumed, but the bat-around inning ended when Troy Tulowitzki fouled out. Dyson made contact with Tulowitzki as he walked off, leading benches to clear again, with Texas catcher Chris Gimenez shoving Tulowitzki.Texas opened the scoring in the first when Delino DeShields scored on a fielder's choice by Prince Fielder. Choo homered off Marcus Stroman in the third to make it 2-0.Choo's homer was the first for the Rangers since Odor connected off David Price in the seventh inning of Game 1.Toronto cut the deficit in half in the third on Bautista's two-out double.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T08:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T09:54:13.880+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
