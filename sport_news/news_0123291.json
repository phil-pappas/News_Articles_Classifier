The Bulldogs downed Donoho in the 1A final back in 2013 before defeating Providence Christian in the 2A title match last season. \nThose triumphs, however, came under Pam Wilkins, who resigned back in January. Fortunately for Addison, it hasn’t missed a beat under new coach Kayla Woodard, who played for Wilkins and Mississippi State prior taking on an assistant role at the school in 2013. \nAs respective area tournament champs, Good Hope, Addison and Holly Pond drew area tourney runners-up for Friday's first round of the 1A-6A North Super Regional. \nThe Raiders duke it out with Elkmont at 6:45 p.m., the Bulldogs take on Gaston at 6:45 p.m. and the Broncos mix it up No. 6 Madison Academy at 12:45 p.m. in the 3A bracket. \nSt. Bernard (1A, Area 11 RU) and West Point (5A, Area 14 RU) have tall orders versus Brilliant and No. 8 Alexandria, respectively. The Saints take the court at 11:30 a.m., while the Warriors play at 10:15 a.m. \nThe event wraps up on Saturday, with squads needing a pair of victories between both days of action — the semis, finals and third-place match are solely for seeding purposes — to advance to the Elite 8, which is slated for next Wednesday and Thursday at the Birmingham CrossPlex. \n% Jake Winfrey can be reached at 256-734-2131, ext. 136 or at jwinfrey@cullmantimes.com.​ Sign Up / Sign In With your existing account from... {* loginWidget *}", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T03:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T08:08:47.755+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
