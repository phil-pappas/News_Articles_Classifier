( Jeremy Papasso / Staff Photographer ) \nPreceded by her sister Taylor Simpson and still teammates with younger sister Gabby, Cierra Simpson is part of a growing family legacy with the CU volleyball team. In the past four games Cierra Simpson twice has reached a career-high in digs, recording 31 in a five-set loss against No. 1 USC on Oct. 9 and matching that mark this past weekend against Cal. \nQ : Did you and your sisters grow up talking about going to school together? \nSimpson : It was one of those things that ended up working that way. We never talked about it. Originally, all three of us wanted to go out of state. But it was the best decision I've ever made. \nQ : Did Taylor try to dissuade you from going to CU? Or did you dissuade Gabby? \nSimpson : It actually was the opposite. I was originally committed to another school. When Taylor decided to come here there was a little pressure from her. I just went back to high school days, getting to play with my sisters, and said, 'Man, that was such a fun experience.' As far as Gabby, we never directly put the pressure on her, but her coming to watch us play, I think she could see we were having a lot of fun. \nQ : What are the best and worst parts of having a sister on the team? \nSimpson : The best part is you always have someone to vent to. I wouldn't really say there are any worst parts. Yeah, you're going to get into it because you're sisters, and sometimes that's hard from an outsider's standpoint, but we do a good job of containing that. We haven't had any complete blowouts. They say the middle child is the peacekeeper, and I totally feel like that's the role I play in my family. Advertisement \nQ : Both your parents played college basketball. How did volleyball become their kids' sport of choice? \nSimpson : All three of us were basketball players to begin with. My mom played volleyball her first two years of college, but then she transferred and played basketball. One day my mom was like, 'Hey, girls, want to try volleyball?' My dad went, 'What are you doing? These girls are going to be basketball players. Why are you doing this?' Now he loves it and is so into volleyball. I really think playing basketball before fully committing to volleyball really helped us out athletically in so many ways. I'm so grateful we had the opportunity to do that. \nQ : You personally have been on a hot streak of late on the court. As an athlete, can you recognize when you're in that sort of zone? \nSimpson : I really do, but I try not to pay attention to the numbers. It's a big mental thing for me. But stuff like that gives me a lot of confidence. My coaches are pumping so much confidence into me and I can't thank them enough. I'm definitely the kind of player where if I'm not confident, I'm not going to be able to perform my best. When I feel like I'm rolling, it's good. \nQ : Any pregame rituals or superstitions? \nSimpson : I wear the same shirt whenever I come (to the gym) for a game. It's a blue CU shirt. I try to do everything before a game in the same order. I listen to the same songs. I write these things on my wrist. A smiley face to remind me to smile and be happy because I'm playing a sport I love. A heart and 'TG' to remind myself to love the grind. It's kind of dumb, but I like it. It gives me routine, and I need routine and organization in my life.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T22:09:56.861+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
