DraftKings and FanDuel employees have access to both things, neither of which is public,\" the federal lawsuit charges. \nThis week, both sites permanently banned employees from playing on any fantasy sports site. But until then each had allowed employees to play on rival sites. \nIt came to light recently that a DraftKings employee who had access to confidential data won $350,000 in a FanDuel contest. \nThe suit cites a report on ESPN that employees of DraftKings had won at least $6 million playing games on FanDuel. \nNew York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman announced this week his office has launched a probe into the practices of the two services. DraftKings and FanDuel also announced they had hired outside firms to conduct probes of their practices and security measures. \nBut both FanDuel and DraftKings insist their investigations show that the employee who won $350,000 did not benefit from insider information when he won that prize. \nNeither FanDuel nor DraftKings had an immediate response to the suit. \nCopyright 2015 by CNN NewSource .
