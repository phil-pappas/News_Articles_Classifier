Reynolds Stadium calls for rain. It’s a coincidental joke considering the two teams playing inside that day, their preseason expectations and the spoils hinging on the outcome. \nArkansas and Auburn will kick-off at the unusually early hour of 11 a.m. in a game that likely will determine last-place in the Southeastern Conference’s Western Division. The hour is generally reserved for the least-appealing conference games of the week in the SEC. Bigger games get the later hours – usually primetime. \nThe Tigers (4-2, 1-2 in SEC) and Razorbacks (2-4, 1-2) deserve the start time given their mediocre front-halves of the season. Neither has lived up to the expectations self-made this summer and even before. Both inside and outside each program the thinking existed double-digit-win seasons were on the horizon. Possible SEC championships, and therefore possible College Football Playoff spots, were in the balance. Those were best-case scenarios, but even the most average of predictions had eight wins for Arkansas and nine or 10 for Auburn. \nNow, Saturday’s loser is unlikely to make a postseason bowl game, nevermind be among those final four teams with a shot at a national championship. Arkansas faces two ranked SEC teams and two more SEC teams to which the Razorbacks lost last year after this week. Auburn has three ranked teams and Georgia. \nToss that in with the peripheral Bret Bielema-versus-Gus Malzahn stuff and it might be the most anticipated game for Arkansas this year. \n“It’s just one of those things,” Bielema, the Arkansas coach, said. “I think it’s important for the fans and it’s important for us.” \nBielema made sure it wouldn’t be just another game in August while speaking with fans and donors at the team’s kickoff dinner reception before the season. He was playing to the audience, as he is apt to do, when he said “It doesn’t need to be said in here how much I hate Auburn.” The game has been circled in households ever since. \nBoth teams have significant weaknesses. Auburn hasn’t been able to slow down anyone except Mississippi State running the ball or anyone at all on third down (14th out of 14 teams in the SEC). The Razorbacks are the fourth-worst team scoring in the red zone in all of FBS and have the last-ranked pass defense in the conference. \nIt’s not a pillow fight as there strengths, too – Arkansas’ offensive balance, Auburn’s rushing game – but it’s hardly where either Bielema or Auburn’s coach Malzahn expected to be this summer. The Tigers were actually picked to win the entire SEC. But considering the predicament each team finds itself in at this point, Bielema figures a hard reset is in order. \n“There is some carryover, but not as much as one would probably think,” Bielema said. “From our point of view offensively going against their defense, they’re just so much different from where they were a year ago. It’s almost like a clean matchup of two new coaches or two new programs.” \nAuburn has already discarded its starting quarterback from the beginning of the year. Jeremy Johnson, picked second-team All-SEC, was removed from the starting role after three starts. Auburn went 2-1 in those games, but the wins were seven points over Louisville, seven over Jacksonville State and a 24-point loss to LSU. Johnson threw six interceptions in his 72 attempts. \nSean White has started the team’s most recent three games and holds the same record as Johnson. And while he has just one interception in 65 throws, he also has zero touchdowns. The Tigers are reliant on running from the backfield as its offensive attack. \nPeyton Barber, the sophomore who has more than half the Auburn carries this season, is good. He spearheads an Auburn rushing game that’s fourth in the league. His 650 rushing yards are behind only four healthy SEC players, including Arkansas’ Alex Collins. \nBut Collins is coming off his worst game of the season. In fact, in Arkansas’ 27-14 loss to Alabama two weeks ago, before the Razorbacks’ bye week, the team registered just 220 yards of total offense. Forty-four of those came on the ground. It was the worst output overall since Arkansas lost to then top-ranked Alabama in 2012, 52-0. \nIt also forced the issue on the back-half of the Arkansas schedule. A 4-2 finale over the last six games is a must for the team to return to bowl eligibility. And while it’s a long way from where they wanted to be, it would buy a little more time in the rebuild. \nAnd it wouldn’t just be a fan base’s most bragable win, it would also be, even if just a little bit, the coach’s, too. \n“I spent a lot of time flying back from Alabama as a 2-4 coach saying ‘How do I spin this? How do I put it in perspective of where I want to be and where we can get?’” Bielema said. “And the bottom line and the truth really comes down to what you’re made of and what you’re all about.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T02:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T08:45:01.565+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
