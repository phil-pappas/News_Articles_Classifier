Petan is smaller than most, more skilled than many.\nBut after providing one of the game-changing moments in Tuesday pre-season outing against Ottawa – his drive to the net drew a penalty that produced the power-play goal with some five minutes to go as the Jets came back from a 3-0 deficit to win – he's so close to making the team he can taste it.\nNot that he'd ever dare to whisper such a thought. Heck, he might not even allow himself to think it.\n“Yeah, you don't want to say it too quickly,” Petan told a morning-after media scrum that was bent on prying some excitement out of him. “But... hopefully it'll be good.”\nSomeone asked it another way: is he able to unpack now (figuratively speaking -- he'll play in Winnipeg either way, with the Jets or the AHL Moose)?\n“I don't know,” the 20-year-old said. “I don't want to say anything. Obviously you want to think positive about yourself. I'm just waiting.”\nThe product of the WHL's Portland Winterhawks will have to sweat it out a little longer.\nBecause Paul Maurice isn't ready to give Petan a permanent stall in the NHL dressing room just yet, saying it's a tad too soon for that.\n“Yeah, we've got a couple more games,” the coach said.\nThere was a time a player like Petan had to make a team on a so-called skill line. Coaches never used to lock a 5-foot-9 playmaker with hands of silk in the fourth-line cage with the muscle-heads.\nBut times, thankfully, are changing in the NHL.\n“The fourth line was always structured as physical guys or penalty killers,” Maurice said. “Nic's a power play guy. So that's the big difference. He handles the puck and moves the puck in that manner. He's got real good awareness ... his reads are pretty solid defensively.”\nThat last part is critical.\nPetan wouldn't make this team if Maurice thought he'd be a defensive liability.\n“A lot of times you get a real skilled player who hasn't spent any time playing any defence – he's been out there for that one reason only,” Maurice said. “Those guys sometimes can be hard to integrate. You've almost got to wait for them to be ready to play in the one role they've trained for. Because he's got a pretty good awareness of the defensive side of the game gives him a little bit of an advantage.”\nThe offensive flair is what intrigues, though.\nEspecially with the switch to three-on-three overtime, where acres of open ice create all kinds of possibilities.\nPetan was one of the better Jets on Tuesday, and he didn't register a point.\nBut he did get nearly three minutes of power-play time, right up there with Mark Scheifele and Mathieu Perreault.\nSafe to say the Jets have never carried a power play specialist on the fourth line before.\n“It's a great opportunity,” Petan said of potentially chipping in up and down the roster. “It's very diverse. You can use me anywhere. But for my line right now, with (Andrew) Copp and Thorby (Chris Thorburn), I feel comfortable on it.”\nThat's about as close as he'll come to saying he's close to making the NHL his first year out of junior.\nIn an interview earlier in camp, Petan acknowledged he's allowed himself to go there.\n“It crosses your mind, for sure,” he said. “Everybody's got to have a mindset like that. Whatever happens happens, but it definitely crosses your mind over summer when you're working hard -- you want to make that push right away.”\nMost players don't. Most spend at least a season in the AHL.\nTuesday, Petan made his push.\nAnd while he got hauled down on the play at the Ottawa net, losing his helmet in the process, he's still very much on his feet in the play for an NHL gig.\nWith his head on straight.\n“Each game now I'm starting to find myself have some more space,” Petan said.\nHe wasn't talking about a permanent space in the Jets dressing room.\nBut he might be soon enough.\npaul.friesen@sunmedia.ca\nTwitter: @friesensunmedia\nPAUL FRIESEN\n20-year-old forward Nic Petan making strong case to make Winnipeg Jets out of training camp\nBy Paul Friesen , Winnipeg Sun First posted: Wednesday, September 30, 2015 02:12 PM EDT | Updated: Wednesday, September 30, 2015 05:26 PM EDT\nHe'd grabbed the puck in the slot and passed up the shot.\nBut after weaving around the net and finding himself alone on the side boards, Nic Petan made his move: straight for the net and a job with the Winnipeg Jets.\nNot all rookies are created equal.
