Sharif in his speech from the floor of the United Nations General Assembly on Wednesday presented a four-point peace initiative, which included taking steps to demilitarise Kashmir. Both the factions of Hurriyat, the one headed by moderate Mirwaiz Umar Farooq and the other by hardliner Sayed Ali Shah Geelani, said what they “infer and understand” by demilitrisation was withdrawal of troops from both sides of the Line of Control. Sharif, in his “four-point peace initiative”, also proposed Pakistan and India to formalise and respect the 2003 understanding of a complete ceasefire in Kashmir and on LoC, and called for its monitoring by the UN observers. He further said Pakistan and India should reaffirm that they would not resort to the threat of force under any circumstances. While calling for “taking steps” to demilitarise Kashmir, Sharif suggested Pakistan’s agreement to “mutually” withdraw troops from the Siachen glacier. Appreciating Sharif for “advocating the cause of Kashmiri people” at the United Nations, senior separatist leader and chairman of hardline faction of the Hurriyat Conference, Geelani said he supported the demand for removal of troops and called for “complete withdrawal of Indian troops” from Jammu and Kashmir. Geelani said in his UNGA speech Nawaz Sharif “represented emotions, sentiments and thoughts” of Kashmiris. The separatist leader, however, criticised the world body, saying that even though 18 resolutions have been passed by the UNO on Kashmir, it has failed to implement them. Asked whether the party would call for withdrawal of troops from the other side of the LoC as well, hardline Hurriyat spokesman Ayaz Akbar said: “PM Nawaz was talking in terms of the UN resolutions on Kashmir and it is understood what we mean from withdrawal of troops from J&K.” The UN resolutions on Kashmir call for withdrawal of troops by both Pakistan and India, followed by a plebiscite. Nawaz Sharif’s “four-point peace imitative” appears a modified version of General Pervez Musharraf’s four-point Kashmir formula, which Geelani had openly opposed. Meanwhile, terming Sharif’s speech as “encouraging”, moderate Hurriyat leader Mirwaiz Umar Farooq urged India to respond positively to the “four-point peace initiative” proposed by the Pakistan PM. Mirwaiz, who has been a strong votary of the Musharaf’s four-point formula on Kashmir, also called for “withdrawal of troops” from Kashmir and termed it as a “longstanding demand of the Hurriyat”. He said withdrawal of troops was in fact part of the suggestions the amalgam had proposed a few years ago to build an atmosphere of confidence and pave the way for dialogue on Kashmir. “The speech by Sharif is encouraging in a sense that it calls for withdrawal of troops from J&K, which is akin to our longstanding demand of withdrawal of troops from both sides of the Line of Control,” Mirwaiz told the Tribune, when asked if he supported withdrawal of troops from the other side of the fence.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T08:20:50.076+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
