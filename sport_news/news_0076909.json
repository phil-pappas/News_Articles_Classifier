Butler had a tough life growing up, which Nick Friedell detailed for ESPN.com last season.\nBut the Bulls’ leading scorer in 2014-15 doesn’t dwell on it.\nBryan Smith did a feature on Butler for Chicago Magazine , and in it, the former Marquette standout revealed an interesting motivational technique:\nStill, he loathes reliving the past—so much so that he has removed the rearview mirror on his car (yes, really) as a symbolic reminder to never look back. His coach at Marquette University, Buzz Williams, says Butler was so sensitive about his upbringing that he swore Williams to secrecy while playing for him.\nNow, nobody can question Butler’s decision to never look back. Things are going well for him—being a mid-20-year-old and signing a contract worth $95 million must be sweet.\nBut the rearview mirror? Be careful, Jimmy. At least double-check those side mirrors.\n[h/t Chicago Magazine ]\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.chicagomag.com/Chicago-Magazine/November-2015/Jimmy-Butler/", "http://espn.go.com/nba/story/_/id/11931211/jimmy-butler-unusual-path-becoming-star", "http://bleacherreport.com/", "http://bleacherreport.com/jimmy-butler", "http://sports.yahoo.com/news/sources--jimmy-butler-agrees-to--95-million-contract-with-bulls-034711922.html", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T13:46:58.957+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
