Jon Reed, Home Town’s director of operations, explained local acquisition will allow the organization to provide a full complement of services.\n“This makes us a completely well-rounded agency,” Reed said, “and we are very much looking forward to expanding our service to the people of Independence and beyond.”\nReed said the Independence-based services will continue to operate out of the medical office building currently located on the hospital campus at 900 W. Myrtle, and that most co-workers on staff with Mercy Home Health and Hospice have agreed to continue employment with Home Town.\nDebbie Shinkle, who is also Home Town’s Administrator, explained that Home Town also has hired other staff from Mercy Hospital who were not formerly employed in the home health and hospice service. “We want to keep as much talent and resources in Independence as possible,” she said.\n“We expect the transition to be seamless for patients and families,” Reed said. “Our intent is to provide the same level of personal, compassionate, quality care they have experienced thus far.”\nDay explained the transfer of home health and hospice services is the first of several announcements to come related to solutions for continued health services after Mercy exits the community at the end of 2015.\nMore information on home health and hospice services available by calling 620-332-3215, or 1-888-387-1160.\n###", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T01:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T21:51:31.218+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
