The Jets improved to 4-1 and look ready for their challenge against division rival and undefeated New England on Sunday. \nBut Rich Cimini of ESPN.com cautions that New York will have to play even better to have a chance against the Patriots. Across the room stood veteran guard Willie Colon, who has been around the block more often than most Uber drivers. He's not shy on confidence — he can out-swagger just about anyone when he feels like it — but he also recognizes the enormity of the challenge. The Patriots are good, very good, and they can make you look bad, really bad, if you forget to pack your A-game. \n\"When they smell blood,\" Colon said, \"they kill.\" \nThe Jets should heed Colon's words, and they should use their 34-20 win against the Washington Redskins as Exhibit A on how to prepare for the Patriots: If they repeat what they did against Redskins — not show up for the first half — they will get punched in their licked chops. \nHere's a sampling of some of the other reaction's following New York's victory: This is the best start the Jets have gotten off to since 2010, when they started 5-1. That was the last year they made the playoffs. Critics will say the Jets have played a soft schedule, but now they get their toughest test. Tom Brady and Co. are on their Deflategate revenge tour. Can Bowles and the Jets stop him? \"They are the Super Bowl champions, so just leave it at that. Licking our chops,\" said defensive lineman Sheldon Richardson, who had three tackles and a half sack in his first game of the season. — Brian Costello, New York Post Darrelle Revis was a hired gun in New England last season and he and the Patriots each got exactly what they wanted. Revis was paid $12 million and earned his first Super Bowl ring. The Patriots ended a 10-year drought of no rings for Bill Belichick and Tom Brady and might not have done it without Revis. It was the most successful one-year rental in the NFL's free agent era. But Revis Island is back with the Jets and when he returns to Gillette Stadium next Sunday in a first-place Jets-Patriots showdown, he's once again on the other side of the bitter rivalry. — Gary Myers, New York Daily News Todd Bowles is so understated, so self-deprecating and so unwilling to shine a light on himself that you don't necessarily view his team through the prism of the coach's personality. He's not particularly quotable, comes off as dry and often humorless in his news conferences and rarely raises his voice to the public or to his players. Unlike, say, another coach who occupied the same place on the Jets' sideline the previous six seasons...But make no mistake about the Jets' current coach: Despite his low-key personality, he has a remarkable grasp of the sport and already has had a profound impact on this team. — Bob Glauber, Newsday Before the game started, Richardson received a few friendly taps on his helmet from the his defensive linemen, who all told him: \"It's time to eat.\" It wasn't quite a steak dinner, his performance, but it was rewarding nevertheless after missing four games for violating the NFL's substance abuse policy. Richardson also was charged with resisting arrest and multiple traffic violations for allegedly driving 143 mph in July in Missouri, but the trial is ongoing, and he has yet to be further disciplined by the league. Richardson said it was hard for him watch the team while he was away — he was allowed to attend team meetings, but not practice until this past week — but that was a distant memory Sunday afternoon. — Zach Braziller, New York Post Chris Ivory is backing up Brandon Marshall's big praise. The Jets receiver raised some eyebrows last week when he said Ivory was the best running back in the league, but then the bruising Jets back went out and posted another monster game in the Jets' 34-20 win over Washington Sunday. Ivory ran for 146 yards and a touchdown and added 50 yards receiving. \"Everyone, they laughed at me,\" Marshall said. \"There was a couple guys, I wish I could remember all their names, and they laughed at me when I said 'Ivory's the best.' And he is. And he proved it again today.\" — Seth Walder, New York Daily News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T18:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T20:58:32.163+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
