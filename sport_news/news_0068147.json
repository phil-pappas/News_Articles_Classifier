however, when that 10th-grader is so advanced at this stage of the game that he already can dominate at least key segments of a game, well then he's certainly worth talking about now. \nVito Campanile, Seton Hall Prep's first-year head coach, has already seen quite a bit of Montclair High sophomore sensation Danny Webb to fully realize that he has to be concerned about how to stop the Mounties' best weapon as two of the more high-profile teams in Essex County prepare to do battle this Saturday, 1 p.m., at Woodman Field, in a key Super Essex Conference-American Division showdown. \nCampanile is as serious about studying a football scouting report and devising a game plan as his dad, Mike, was at Paramus Catholic back in the 1980s and '90s, and his brother, Nunzio, currently at state power Bergen Catholic. \nAnd although it has been a surprisingly rough 0-4 start to the season for MHS, the fact is the young team has shown flashes of brilliance at times, and most of those bright moments have involved breakaway runs either from the line of scrimmage or on kick and punt returns by Webb. \n\"I saw him against Union City [34-28 Mounties' loss] and I'm thinking, 'Wow,' this kid can really play,\" Campanile said. \"What he did in that game [4 TDs, including runs of 40 and 38 yards]was truly dynamic, and it was something I haven't seen done by a sophomore back since I played against Rashidi Brown [of Hackensack] back in my senior season [1992].\" \nCampanile was an all-state QB for Paramus Catholic in '92 playing for his dad, while Brown was etching his mark as a back to watch and would later become a unanimous first-team all-state selection while playing for current Don Bosco Prep coach Greg Toal at Hackensack in '94 and leading the Comets to a third straight sectional playoff championship. \nHe went on to begin his college career at Clemson before coming home to finish up playing for Jersey City State. \nAs the SHP coach can easily see now, some 23 years after being haunted by the memories of his Paramus Catholic team trying to slow down Hackensack's sensational Brown, is that Webb is a featured back to be very concerned about on what is always an athletically-endowed Mountie football program. \n\"Montclair always has talented kids, and they've got other very good players that we have to be concerned about on Saturday, but Webb is a definite game-changing type of kid, and we have to work hard to try and eliminate the big play against them.\" \nSHP has lost four in a row to MHS and hasn't beaten the Mounties since All-Essex running back Kevin Monangai (Villanova & Philadelphia Eagles) and defensive lineman Connor Wujciak (senior starter at Boston College) were the stars for one of the better recent Pirate editions. \nThis SHP squad (3-1), along with its enthusiastic new head coach, possesses one of the state's top quarterbacks in Princeton-bound Zach Keller, who bounced back from an injured hand suffered in a Sept. 19 loss to St. Peter's Prep, to fire away for a school-record tying 4 TD passes along with 225 yards through the air in last Friday night's 37-12 win over East Orange Campus. \nCoach John Fiore's staff is going to have to come up with a number of ways to try and disrupt Keller's efficiency; however, on the other side of the field, Campanile and company know that they will have their hands full with Webb. \n\"He's compactly built and strong despite not being very tall [5-foot-7] and is just so quick and elusive,\" said the first-year SHP head mentor. \"I didn't see (2011 all-state QB) Khalif Herbin play at Montclair, so I can't compare the two, but it's obvious that Webb has the potential to be a very dynamic a player as well, which makes me think back to Rashidi Brown because Webb is simply the best sophomore back I've seen since him.\" \nWhere it may not be fair as of yet is to compare Webb to other Mountie running backs of the past 35 years is in saying how he stands with a number of players who had big senior years. Off the field, he hasn't yet been featured in \"Faces In The Crowd\" in Sports Illustrated like the late Mountie back Chris Frasier was as a Montclair Cobra in the late 1970s, or has he been in a photo on the cover of SI as ex-MHS all-stater Brandy Wells was as a safety for Notre Dame as he covered a Michigan receiver in the mid-1980s. \nThe best MHS running backs since 1980, such as Wells' teammate James \"Boo\" Overbey (who was a star in the memorable 1982 Thanksgiving Day Mounties' comeback win over Passaic and Craig 'Ironhead' Heyward), Nikki Kemp (member of a Wisconsin Rose Bowl championship team), the late Justin Ashe, Rikki Cook, Alvin \"Ace\" Bowen and Julian Cruz all had splendid senior seasons and Webb hasn't had an opportunity yet even as a junior back for the Mounties. \nThere have been other very competent Mountie running backs in the past 35 years (Alton Long, Terrance Garrison, Jace Brooks, Omar Liggins, Anthony Perna, Shawn Plummer and Anthony Nesbit also come to mind), but Webb has a chance to be mentioned with the best of them, if he remains healthy and continues to simply do what he's doing now for a Mountie team that certainly needs his running prowess (670 yards rushing at 8.4 yards per carry, 7 TDs; 6 receptions for 88 yards, plus six kick returns for 160 yards, including a 93-yard TD, and also three punt returns for 94 yards, all in just the first four games this fall). \n\"Montclair is six plays away from being 4-0 and Webb has been sensational,\" said Campanile. \"Hopefully, we can slow him down on Saturday, but we know that we will have our hands full.\" Â© 2015 North Jersey Media Group Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T19:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T02:33:15.346+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
