Comment Posted Oct. 9, 2015 at 9:25 PM Updated at 9:30 PM Posted Oct. 9, 2015 at 9:25 PM Updated at 9:30 PM FOXBORO – Seven points for the Patriots and the Cowboys. Here are seven things to keep in mind as the 3-0 Patriots aim to remain unbeaten with a win against the 2-2 Cowboys at Dallas’ AT&T Stadium on Sunday afternoon: Now that’s a first – The game will mark the Patriots’ first at “Jerry’s World”– AT&T Stadium, home to Jerry Jones’ Cowboys since 2009. The Patriots’ last trip to Dallas was on Oct. 14, 2007, when Tom Brady threw what was then a career-high five touchdown passes (he exceeded that with six at Miami the very next week) in a 48-27 win at Texas Stadium. The two teams haven’t met since Oct. 16, 2011, when Brady’s 8-yard touchdown pass to Aaron Hernandez with 22 seconds to play gave the Pats a 20-16 victory at Gillette Stadium. ‘Dezimated’ by injuries – It’s already been a season of bad breaks for the Cowboys, whose offense has been decimated by injuries. First, wide receiver Dez Bryant (broken right foot) went down in Week One. Then, quarterback Tony Romo (broken left collarbone) went down in Week Two. That’s left the Cowboys with Brandon Weeden – 5-18 lifetime as a starter in the NFL, loser of his last 10 starts and with more interceptions (29) than touchdown passes (28) in his career – throwing to wide receivers Cole Beasley and Terrance Williams, and Jason Witten, the team’s durable and dependable tight end. The injuries continued to mount in last Sunday night’s 26-20 overtime loss at New Orleans when Lance Dunbar (torn anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee), a pass-catching threat out of the backfield and return man, was lost for the season and wide receiver Brice Butler (hamstring) and linebacker Sean Lee (concussion) were knocked out of the game. On the defensive side of the ball, the Cowboys are getting some reinforcements in the persons of defensive end Greg Hardy and linebacker Rolando McClain, both of whom served four-game suspensions from the league at the start of the season. There’s the beef – The Cowboys boast what Patriots head coach Bill Belichick calls “the best offensive line in the league.” In left tackle Tyron Smith (2011), center Travis Frederick (2013) and right guard Zack Martin (2014), that line features three former first-round draft picks of theirs who went to the Pro Bowl last year. On a local note, Bridgewater’s Marc Colombo, who is in his first year as an offensive assistant on head coach Jason Garrett’s staff, is actively involved in coaching the line. Life on the run – A year ago, DeMarco Murray ran away with the league’s rushing title. Page 2 of 2 - The Cowboys no longer feature Murray – signed by the Eagles during the offseason, he’s running into his own problems in Philadelphia – but with Romo out, Weeden in, with that offensive line and a Patriots defense that ranks 23rd in the league against the run in town, they’ll want to be well grounded with Joseph Randle, Darren McFadden and Christine Michael in the backfield on Sunday. No ‘D’ in Dallas? – The Dallas defense has allowed 26 points (twice) or more (39 once) in three of its four games to date. It’s not that the Cowboys are particularly bad in one area – they’re top 10 against the run (ninth) and slightly below par (tied for 19th) against the pass – but they’re allowing points (25.3 per game) at a rate an offense quarterbacked by Weeden can’t match. At times last Sunday night they were rendered utterly defenseless by Drew Brees and an uptempo offense, the Saints quarterback, who was playing with a lame rotator cuff, picking the Cowboys apart to the tune of 33 completions in 41 attempts for 359 yards and two TDs with no interceptions, numbers a healthy Brady no doubt finds inviting. Mr. Octobers – October hasn’t been a trick-or-treat month for Bill Belichick’s Patriots. It’s been an unmitigated treat. The Patriots have gone a league-best 45-16-0 (.738) in October since Belichick took over as their coach in the year 2000. They’re also 11-4 coming off a regular-season bye under Belichick, as the current team is, although two of those losses have come in the past four years. Their aims are true – In the Cowboys’ Dan Bailey (90.2 percent, first) and the Patriots’ Stephen Gostkowski (87.1 percent, third), the game features two of the three most accurate field-goal kickers in NFL history (at 89.9 percent, Baltimore’s Justin Tucker is second). If you’re watching at home and this one comes down to a field goal at game’s end, leave the room. It’ll be good.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T05:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T08:34:31.501+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
