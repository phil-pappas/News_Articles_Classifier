(AP) - Due to the extremely dry conditions in the state, State Fire Marshal H. Butch Browning and Agriculture and Forestry Commissioner Mike Strain have issued a burn ban for all of Louisiana.\nThe vast majority of the state is in extreme drought. In a news release Thursday, Browning and Strain said a cease and desist order is in effect for all private burning. They said private burning shall only be allowed by permission of the local fire department or government.\nThe order is effective at 6 a.m. Friday and shall remain in effect until lifted.\nThe statewide burn ban is in response to extreme dry conditions, abnormal emergency responses, and adverse future weather predictions.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
