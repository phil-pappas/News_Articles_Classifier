But it was Bason’s software product, which helps keep children safe from online dangers such as cyberbullying and online predators, that won over the crowd along with investor and Guild Hall co-owner Clegg Ivey.\n“I was so impressed with what Brian had to say about Bark that not only are we going to give Bark status as one of (The Guild ) portfolio companies, but I’m ready to write a check for $50,000,” Ivey said to a booming round of applause.\nThe Bark software is subscription-based and scans through children’s social media posts, text messages and emails for any sign of cyberbullying or predators and sends alerts to both the child and the parent if something is detected, so parents only see flagged content. If a threat is detected, the software recommends solutions on how to handle the situation.\nBason said it serves as a less invasive way for parents to know that their children are safe without snatching phones and computers away.\n“What we’re trying to do with Bark is introduce a smarter technology to solve the problem...,” Bason said earlier in the evening during his presentation.\n“Parents see the problem, and they’re spending millions each year on these kinds of products, but the problem is that the existing solutions simply don’t work... A lot of them are very invasive and solely focused on the parent’s experience and not at all on the child — and we think that’s fundamentally wrong. The child needs to be an active participant in this process.”\nJacob Heider, who co-owns the Guild Hall with Ivey, said that they were excited to see where Bark was headed.\n“They’re doing some really innovative stuff... It’s clear that doing nothing isn’t an option, and you don’t have to be a genius to know that being super invasive isn’t good for a child’s development...,” Heider said. “We’ll help them work on their marketing, app design or whatever they need. We like to help people build their companies.”\nCurrently, Bark is in the beta-testing phase, but a full launch is expected in early 2016. After the initial shock wore off, Bason said he was feeling fantastic.\n“We’ve raised $550,000 now,” he said. “I’m just a little happy right now.”", "external_links": ["http://sav-cdn.com/sites/all/themes/savannahnow/images/blank.gif", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/14812948.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/14812948.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-15T18:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T10:08:45.328+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
