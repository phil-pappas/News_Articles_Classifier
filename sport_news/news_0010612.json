(UTSports.com)-- The Vols are hopeful that a focus on the small things could lead to a big result this week as Tennessee head coach Butch Jones has preached a return to basics in UT's preparations for a big SEC showdown against Georgia at Neyland Stadium. \n\"In terms of moving forward with Georgia, kind of our theme this week [is] getting back to the basics, the fundamentals, the fine details of what it takes to play winning football,\" Jones said. \"We've been talking to them all week about D & D. Not down and distance, but discipline and details. For us it's our eye discipline, it's running our feet on contact. We know we're going to be challenged this week with two very, very special running backs coming in here.\" \nRising to that challenge could be aided by the prospective returns of defensive back Stephen Griffin and defensive lineman Kyle Phillips. Both players had been limited so far this week due to injuries, but Jones provided an optimistic update on both players. \n\"Stephen Griffin did practice [yesterday],\" he said. \"He has been limited but we fully anticipate him being ready for the game. \n\"Probably the most positive story is Kyle Phillips. Kyle Phillips will practice today after going through some rehabilitation with his shoulder. It's very stable. It's very strong, so that's been a positive. Kyle is going to practice today and we'll see how it goes.\" \nOther personnel updates from the day include:-Offensive lineman Brett Kendrick and wide receiver Marquez North both practiced on Tuesday. Both were limited in practice but are hopeful to be available on Saturday \n-Offensive lineman Dylan Wiesman also practiced on Tuesday and is expected to be ready for Saturday \n-Wide receiver Alton Howard has been dismissed from the team due to a violation of team rules \n-Tennessee and Georgia are slated for a 3:30 p.m. ET kickoff on Saturday. The game will be televised on CBS. \nDiscipline and DetailsWith No. 19 Georgia - and outstanding Bulldog running backs Nick Chubb and Sony Michel - coming to town on Saturday, Vols coach Butch Jones has encouraged a return to fundamentals from the Tennessee defense as it looks to temper another stellar SEC rushing attack. To drive that point home, Jones has introduced a new theme: discipline and details.\"We've been talking to them all week about D & D. Not down and distance, but discipline and details,\" Jones said. \"Defensively, we cannot give up big plays. But it's back to the basics, the fundamentals.\"Stopping those big plays, particularly against the run, will be predicated on Tennessee's ability to make tackles. Defensive back Cameron Sutton addressed that issue on Wednesday. \n\"At the end of the day we've just got to get the guy down to limit explosive plays,\" he said. \nFellow DB Brian Randolph echoed those sentiments, saying tackling must improve for the Vols to be in a position to win. \n\"We've definitely got to do a better job of tackling, angles and leverage to the ball,\" said Randolph. \"We've got to stop the run, tackle their backs, and get off the field on third down. \n\"Everyone's trying to help everyone get better. We're focused on the details and discipline. We're not that far off.\" \nVersatility Is Valued On O-LineWith starting UT right tackle Brett Kendrick battling back from injuries, there is a possibility that the Vols will have a different starting offensive line on Saturday. Tennessee has started the group of Kyler Kerbyson, Jashon Robertson, Coleman Thomas, Dylan Wiesman and Kendrick in all five games this season. \nRobertson, who starts at left guard, played some snaps at right guard last week against Arkansas and says that UT's offensive linemen are prepared to play multiple spots along the line. \n\"Each week, Coach Mo (offensive line coach Don Mahoney) does a good job of rotating guys in practice for potential scenarios as far as if this guy goes down or this guy goes down or whatever it is,\" Robertson said. \"So we practice those types of situations throughout each day.\" \nRobertson and his fellow starters are confident in their teammates on the bench. \n\"As an offensive line, throughout the game and throughout the season it's going to take all of us,\" he said. \"Whoever that guy is that comes in and plays with us if Brett isn't able to go, we trust and believe in him and we'll be ready to go.\" \nWide Receiver UpdateThe wide receiver position has been somewhat of a revolving door early in the 2015 season. Student-athletes have missed time due to injuries, but the team is slowly getting healthy. \nAfter missing the game against Arkansas, Marquez North practiced with the team this week and is questionable for Saturday's game against Georgia. \nJohnathon Johnson has been limited in the work he can do, but he is getting closer to a return. \n\"I think Von Pearson is starting to get back to regain his old form. He's done some good things in practice,\" said head coach Butch Jones.Despite missing those three individuals for different periods of time as well as Jason Croom and Vincent Perry, the team still has a lot of talent and drive at the position. \n\"The individuals that have been there have done an exceptional job. They've been remarkable in their preparation,\" said Coach Jones \"They're a prideful group. They take great pride, and what's happened is they have to know a number of positions. We can't just concentrate on knowing one position. A lot of these individuals have to know all three and four positions in our offense.\" \n\"We're still teaching a youngster in Jauan Jennings how to play wide receiver. Josh Smith has done a very good job of mentoring and guiding. I thought Josh Smith probably had his best practice he's had all year. He finally looked 100-percent healthy. He looked smooth in and out of his breaks, caught the ball exceptionally well,\" Jones continued. \n\"Josh Malone has been another individual who really has been a model of consistency. I've been so proud of him. He's really improved his game. We have to get him the football, but he's worked exceptionally hard - his effort, his blocking, his fundamentals, his details. He's done a great job.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T01:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T06:51:22.960+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
