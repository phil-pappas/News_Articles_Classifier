Wide receiver Ruben Randle did a little tribute to his injured teammate after am 11-yard second-quarter touchdown. \nThis right here is the salsa, Cruz's patented touchdown celebration. Rueben Randle with a tribute to Victor Cruz #Salsa https://t.co/IsOHCDkZ6y — Giants Daily (@NYGDaily) October 4, 2015 \nIt's a touching tribute considering Cruz was supposed to return and play this week for the first since tearing the patellar tendon in his right knee last year. But Cruz has been struggling with a calf injury, and suffered another setback on Wednesday during his first practice in six weeks. He had a platelet-rich plasma (PRP) injection on Thursday. \nJordan Raanan may be reached at jraanan@njadvancemedia.com . Follow him on Twitter @JordanRaanan .
