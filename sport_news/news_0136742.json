Not exactly big fans of Giants wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr. \nMultiple Bills players blasted Beckham to The Buffalo News on Tuesday , calling the star receiver a \"prima donna\" and accusing him of constant trash talk and throwing multiple punches in the Giants' 24-10 win over the Bills this past Sunday at Ralph Wilson Stadium. \n\"I don't know what's up with him,\" cornerback Stephon Gilmore told The News' Tyler Dunne . \"He acts like nobody's supposed to hit him and you're supposed to let him catch the ball. He's weird. He gets mad when you play physical with him. He's weird. \n\"He's different. It's kind of like you're playing your little brother and he gets mad at you for being too physical with him — throwing a tantrum. I'm like, 'Man, we're playing football. It's a physical game. ... He's a prima donna. He feels like he's on top of the world and nobody's supposed to do anything to him.\" \nPLUS : Beckham's unbelievable statistics through first 16 games of career \nGilmore later added, \"His world is based on hype and that one catch. Everybody sees that, everybody knows him for that and people don't really look at the film and watch him and really don't know what type of player he is.\" \nLeading up to his second season, Beckham acknowledged on multiple occasions he needed to work on controlling his emotions on the field . After he mixed it up with Jaguars defensive backs in a preseason game - teammate Victor Cruz said he felt the Jacksonville defenders were unfairly \"gunning\" for Beckham - Beckham acknowledged his style of play, and personality, could rub opponents the wrong way. Beckham he needed to \"turn the other cheek\" in confrontational situations. \n\"It's going to be a test all year. It's just something that you're going to have to deal with,\" Beckham said. \nBut the Bills are accusing him of doing the exact opposite in this case. According to the report, Bills middle linebacker Preston Brown said his fourth quarter unsportsmanlike conduct penalty was a result of his retaliating after Beckham had punched him. \n\"That's what he does. He'll get away with it,\" Brown told The News. \"He's the 'golden boy' of the league. He's on the cover of Madden. Sometimes, you get away with stuff like that.\" \nThe Bills allege Beckham then punched safety Duke Williams several plays later. \n\"A guy like that,\" Williams told The News, \"you expect him to be a stand-up guy but I guess it is a part of his game. He likes to throw cheap shots here and there and gets away with it. I guess it's his thing. ...Right in front of the referee and he threw a jab at me and ran behind his teammates. He ran away. I'm just like, 'Wow. That's crazy.'\" \nVideo of the Williams play in question can be seen below: \nJames Kratch can be reached at jkratch@njadvancemedia.com or by leaving a note in the comments below.
