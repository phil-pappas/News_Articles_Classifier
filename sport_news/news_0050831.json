Nearly 66,000 heavy commercial vehicles enter Delhi daily. It is stated before us that low toll tax is an incentive for heavy vehicles to pass through Delhi rather than taking alternate route which will reduce pollution…\n“It will be in our considered view, appropriate to direct the check posts to charge transport heavy vehicles entering Delhi as their final destination or enroute to other places entering from Sonipat to pay environmental compensation in addition to toll tax payable,” a bench headed by Justice Swatanter Kumar said.\nThe bench noted that the charges payable by heavy vehicles at toll tax in Delhi was Rs 600 while in Haryana it is varied from Rs 930 to Rs 1,550 depending on the kind of trucks entering the state.\nThe bench also made it clear that all vehicles destined for places other than Delhi shall be diverted at Panipat to take alternate route via NH-71A and NH-71 and exit at Bawal in Haryana.\n“The trucks which are not destined to Delhi and have not taken alternate route would not be permitted to enter the capital and would be returned to Panipat to take alternate route,” the Tribunal said.\nIt also directed that the additional amount collected in form of environment compensation by the check posts would be paid to Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) which will maintain a separate account.\n“The collected amount would be used for improving the ambient air quality of the capital,” the bench said.\nIt also directed Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) and DPCC to purchase or arrange instruments for checking emission of moving overloaded heavy vehicles.\nDuring the proceedings, advocate Bhakti Pasrija Sethi, appearing for Supreme Court Women Lawyers Association (SCWLA), submitted before the bench that higher charges on vehicles would not have any impact on reducing air pollution.\n“They can pay more tax and still cause pollution. How can we deal with the issue of air pollution this way,” she asked.\nThe green panel reteirated that all its earlier orders, including ban on 10-year-old vehicles, would continue to be in force “without any change” and directed all concerned authorities to carry out its orders in true letter and spirit.\nThe NGT also asked the Joint Commissioners of Delhi and Haryana Police (Traffic) to deliberate on alternate route from Gurgaon and Ghaziabad.\nThe green bench directed the Haryana government and National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) to expedite the work on Eastern and Western Peripheral Expressways to ease traffic congestion in the capital.\nAdditional Solicitor General Pinky Anand, appearing for NHAI, told the Tribunal that work has been awarded on the Eastern Peripheral Expressway and work on the project would start shortly.\nThe bench is deliberating on mechanism to devise an alternative route for commercial vehicles passing through the city to decongest the roads and reduce vehicular emissions.\nOn August 31, a meeting was held in the Delhi Police headquarters here where an alternate route via NH-71A and NH- 71 (Panipat-Rohtak-Jhajjar-Bawal) was proposed.\nDelhi Police had said that this new route suggested by NHAI was four-lane and hence adequate to cater to the traffic of more than 50,000 PCUs (passenger car units).\n“The distance of the diverted route i.e through Panipat- Rohtak-Jhajjar-Bawal diversion is 166 km whereas the distance for route through New Delhi is 174 km,” it had said.\nTwo days ago, the Supreme Court, in a case related to air pollution, had asked the Centre and Delhi government to respond to a plea seeking levy of ‘pollution compensatory charges’, along with toll tax, on commercial vehicles plying in the national capital.\nFirst Published on October 07, 2015 8:42 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T04:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T01:15:54.209+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
