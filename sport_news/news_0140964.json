Logano's post-Daytona 500 celebration was used as inspiration. Photo by Jared C. Tilton/Getty Images \nThat's pretty close. There are two other corn mazes next to Logano's - one in the shape of the Shell logo and the other promoting 811, the national call before you dig phone number. \n\"I was blown away by what I saw,\" said Logano. \"The maze is incredible and I have never seen anything like before, nor would I have ever imagined being a part of something like this when I started racing. I think it's very cool that it is symbolic of our Daytona 500 win. That was a pretty big surprise and something I'll always remember. I'm pretty sure I'd get lost inside that thing.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T20:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T20:56:44.265+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
