A little thing called World War II got in the way and service in the U.S. Army in Europe took priority. But thanks to the Cubs 6-4 victory over the St. Louis Cardinals on Tuesday that put them in the National League Championship Series, Gutierrez could get a second chance to see his favorite team in the Fall Classic. \"It's been great after so many years of suffering with them,\" said Guitierrez of this fun Cubs season. \"I've never left them. I like them.\" Gutierrez first visited Wrigley Field in 1943 when as a member of the military, he took a girl named Ramona to a Cubs game on a blind date. A few years later they married and raised eight children in Galesburg. His devotion to the Cubs took a partial detour, however. He admits to becoming a Cleveland Indians' fan in the early 1950s when that team - led by pitchers Mike Garcia, Early Wynn, Bob Lemon and Bob Feller - enjoyed a run that included a World Series appearance in 1954. But working first for CB&Q railroad and later 30 years for Maytag, Gutierrez fell under the spell of the Cubs. \"When we didn't have a TV, I'd lie on the floor and listen to the games on the radio,\" he recalled. Gutierrez also made regular trips to Wrigley Field with family and friends and became a big fan of players like Ernie Banks, Billy Williams and Ron Santo. Later, his list of favorites grew to include Ryne Sandberg and Andre Dawson. Most recently, he's grown to appreciate the Cubs' new generation. \"I like that (Addison) Russell. He kind of came out of nowhere,\" said Gutierrez. \"I like (Kris Bryant) and (Anthony) Rizzo, too. \"I'd almost given up on (Starlin) Castro but when they brought in those minor leaguers for him, it kind of straightened him out.\" And he has plenty of respect for the Cardinals. \"To me the Cardinals are a great team because of (Yadier) Molina,\" said Gutierrez. \"To me, he's been as good as Johnny Bench.\" Despite his love for the Cubs, that devotion hasn't been shared by most of his family. One of his sons follows the White Sox, another the Brewers. His wife Ramona, who passed away in 2009, often kept her team loyalty under wraps. \"I remember once she asked me who my favorite team was,\" said Gutierrez' son David, \" and I said the White Sox. \"She said to me, 'I think you're in the wrong house.' \" Gutierrez said he doesn't get that riled up over the Cubs anymore. Page 2 of 2 - \"I'm comfortable with them,\" he said. \"I don't get upset any more being that I'm older. \"I like what the new people have done with them.\" And does he think the Cubs will make the World Series? \"They've got a good chance,\" Gutierrez said. \"I'm a little nervous but I think they will make it. \"I'd like to see them in a World Series.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T06:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T12:23:05.789+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
