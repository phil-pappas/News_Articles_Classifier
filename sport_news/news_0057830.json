Well, all you have to do is take a recent history check to find the answer. \nPerhaps most impressive is that P’burg has continually thrived on the big stage in bad weather. The Stateliners’ last three sectional titles – Ridge (34-7 win in 2009), Mendham (39-0 in 2013) and Colonia (28-21 in overtime in 2014) – were all played in horrible weather conditions. \nFurthermore, P’burg celebrated a 3-0 overtime win over Easton in a snowstorm on Thanksgiving in 2010. That happened to be former coach Bob Stem’s last game. \nIt’s also worth pointing out that P’burg knocked off Easton again last year – 19-15 – after another snowstorm pushed the game back two days. \nFriday’s game didn’t start out so well as Stateliners junior quarterback Danny Fisher was intercepted on the first play from scrimmage. But P’burg’s defense quickly restored order, got the ball into the offense’s capable hands, and it wasn’t long before the Stateliners were on their way to another convincing win in the muck and mire.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T06:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T01:52:29.136+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
