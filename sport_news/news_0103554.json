The Dodgers are 3-6 in those games, having now lost five consecutive Kershaw playoff starts.\nThe numbers are remarkable really, among the most unlikely statistics accumulated by a pitcher famous for producing unlikely statistics. Kershaw, in October, has become a splintered ace.\nSome of his nine postseason starts have been very good, a couple of them have been very bad and a few, like this latest one, have fallen somewhere in between.\nAgainst the Mets, he permitted only Daniel Murphy’s homer leading off the fourth before three walks unraveled his seventh inning, leading to the Mets’ other two runs.\nManager Don Mattingly pulled Kershaw with the bases loaded and the score still only 1-0 with two outs in that seventh.\nReliever Pedro Baez immediately fell behind David Wright, the most veteran of New York’s hitters, and eventually surrendered Wright’s game-clinching two-run single, and maybe you’ve read before about the Dodgers’ bullpen failing in these sorts of situations.\nSome folks will question Mattingly’s decision to remove Kershaw, who, to that point, had thrown 113 pitches. After all, questioning Mattingly has become one of the great postseason traditions in Dodger history.\nBut I’m not going to do that here, given how Kershaw was struggling to find the strike zone. I would, however, wonder about Mattingly’s choice of Baez over, say, Chris Hatcher. I’d also note that more than Mattingly, Baez was the one who really failed.\nKershaw had spent stretches of this night making New York’s hitters look silly, repeatedly striking them out with curveballs that short-hopped catcher A.J. Ellis.\nThe Mets batted .155 against left-handed curveballs this season, which was the worst in baseball and another sign this sport one day will be rendered less thrilling than long division.\nYet, ultimately, Kershaw’s impact Friday was compromised greatly by deGrom, who easily was the best starting pitcher on the field.\n“I thought about the fourth or fifth inning, he started to settle in a lot better,” New York manager Terry Collins said. “I think he was making better pitches.”\nEn route to seven shutout innings, the right hander kept doing things that made Mets’ history. At one point, he equaled a record held by Dwight Gooden. Later, the name Tom Seaver was mentioned.\n“What made Jacob so great tonight,” Murphy said, “was that he not only matched up pitch-for-pitch (with Kershaw), but he was able to go deeper in the game.”\nThe Dodgers struck out 13 times in all, frequently blown away by deGrom’s upper-90s fastball, swinging at fumes and, unfortunately for L.A. fans, consistently making contact.\nThe Dodgers got a leadoff double in the second from Justin Turner and a leadoff single from Turner in the fourth and did nothing with either.\nTheir greatest threat against deGrom actually was delivered by Kershaw, who drove a ball deep to left-center that was run down by Yoenis Cespedes to end the fourth inning with two runners on.\n“Obviously, a lot of just velocity,” Mattingly said of deGrom, who entered this game overshadowed by Kershaw but didn’t exit that way. “He beat us with that a lot.”\nAs dominant as both starting pitchers were Friday, this game somehow didn’t feature a 1-2-3 inning until the bottom of the fifth, a half-inning that, in honor of deGrom, I’ll rename here the bottom of the filth.\nHe smoked Carl Crawford with a 96-mph four-seam, five alarm fastball that was closer to the bill of Crawford’s helmet than the strike zone. He then retired Howie Kendrick on a routine ground ball back to the mound. That brought up Corey Seager, who was so fooled by a deGrom curve that his halting swing looked fractured.\nSo that’s how it went on a night when Clayton Kershaw started for the Dodgers in October. So many of us were left writing about the opposition. Again.\nSome day, this has to change, no? Some day, the best starter going has to finish on top, right?\nContact the writer: jmiller@ocregister.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T09:31:05.165+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
