She was the one to help out when an elderly family member was sick, and to stay late even when a co-worker told her to go home.\nMcMurtrey was among those wounded during Thursday's fatal shooting at the community college in Roseburg, Maddie Chane and her sister Aly Chane confirmed to The Oregonian/OregonLive.\n\"She's always been a caregiver,\" Maddie Chane said. \"She's always there when someone else needs her. Now it's her time to have people there for her. \"\nOn Thursday morning a gunman opened fire during a writing class at Umpqua Community College, killing nine and wounding several before shooting himself.\nMcMurtrey was also in the writing class that morning, Aly Chane said. She said her aunt was shot eight times, hit in the arm and abdomen.\nOur full coverage of the shooting is available here.\nMcMurtrey is recovering in a Springfield hospital following multiple surgeries and started physical therapy Saturday, Aly Chane said. She has spoken some short sentences and was able to see her two daughters, ages 5 and 7, on Sunday.\nMcMurtrey grew up in Portland and moved to Roseburg after getting married. Aly Chane said she spent part of her summer with McMurtrey and her family, taking the girls to swim lessons at the community college while McMurtrey worked on taking a math class.\nThe two sisters have since launched a GoFundMe account to help cover medical bills. As of Sunday night, more than $11,670 had been raised.\n\"She wanted to go back to school for her kids,\" Maddie Chane said. \"I wanted to take this really horrible thing and try to make it a really great thing. It's honestly all we can do.\"\nAly and Maddie Chane haven't yet spoken with their aunt, but said she was in shock when she awoke in the hospital. She clearly remembered what had happened, they said.\n\"It's amazing she survived,\" Maddie Chane said. \"Everyone around her is praying for her.\"\nMcMurtrey's GoFundMe account is one of several set up to help survivors of the shooting and the families of those who were killed.\nOne for Chris Mintz, who is reported to have been shot several times after charging the shooter , has raised more than $746,000. His family asked contributors to consider donating to other accounts as well in a post on the fundraiser's site.\n--Laura Frazier\nlfrazier@oregonian.com\n503-294-4035\n@frazier_laura", "external_links": ["https://www.gofundme.com/xd569d7w", "https://twitter.com/frazier_laura", "https://www.gofundme.com/s75ge9y4"], "published": "2015-10-05T05:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T12:37:24.276+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
