Logano took the lead when Greg Biffle had to pit for fuel eight laps from the end, then held on through two restarts to win for the sixth time this year and the 11th time in the past 61 races. While winning three consecutive NASCAR Sprint Cup Series races is not that unusual – Kyle Busch did it earlier this season – this is the first time a driver has swept all three races in a Chase round. In addition, Logano is the first Ford driver to win three straight since Rusty Wallace in 1994. “I am so proud of this team. Three in a row is unbelievable,” Logano said. “It’s amazing. I guess dreams come true. We just have to keep this dream rolling. We have momentum, that’s for sure.” Logano will be joined in the next round of the Chase for the NASCAR Sprint Cup by Carl Edwards, Jeff Gordon, Kurt Busch, Brad Keselowski, Martin Truex Jr., Kevin Harvick and Kyle Busch, who grabbed the final spot over Ryan Newman by only three points. In addition to Newman, Denny Hamlin, Matt Kenseth and Dale Earnhardt Jr. were also eliminated from championship contention. One of the 11 desperate drivers vying for a victory in order to advance, Earnhardt Jr. finished second, only a few inches behind Logano. “Just fell about the width of the splitter short,” said Dale Jr, who posted his 12th top-five finish and 16th top-10 in 32 starts at Talladega Superspeedway. “I’m not going to be too upset about it. I did everything I could. I’m proud of myself and proud of my team.” Earnhardt Jr. was running outside the top 25 with less than 60 laps remaining following a pit-stop penalty. But he worked his way back into the lead barely 20 laps later and ended the day having led a race-best 61 laps. “I’m real happy with how we ran today,” Earnhardt Jr. said. “I’m more proud of the drive I had today than the two wins (earlier) this year. The two wins came a lot easier than this second place did. We got shuffled out and I didn’t know if I could get back up there.” Jeff Gordon, the six-time winner who ties Earnhardt Jr. for second on the all-time win record at Talladega Superspeedway, finished third in his final race at the track. The four-time NASCAR Sprint Cup Series champion is retiring at the end of this season. “That was intense. That was wild. That was crazy,” a smiling Gordon said afterward. “I had a lot of fun out there today. It was so much fun to have a race car that strong and battling up front.” Keselowski finished fourth, followed by Edwards in fifth, Paul Menard sixth, Truex seventh, Clint Bowyer eighth, Ricky Stenhouse Jr. ninth and Kurt Busch 10th.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T03:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T15:05:12.836+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
