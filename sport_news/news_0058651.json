The win pulled Walla Walla (7-3-6 overall, 5-3-4 in the East region) out of a little funk, which had seen the Warriors suffer two losses and only muster a tie in three matches since last winning, Oct. 7 at North Idaho. The win also kept WWCC second in league standings ahead of Columbia Basin, which edged North Idaho on Wednesday. Meraz-Rodriguez tallied his first goal at the second minute, taking advantage of an assist from Gil Guizar. Treasure Valley managed to tie the score midway through the first half, but Meraz-Rodriguez found the back of the net again shortly before intermission and the Warriors stayed in front the rest of the game. Walla Walla goalie Francisco Flores made six saves. The Warriors will next play Saturday at home against North Idaho.
