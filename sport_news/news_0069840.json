Filed: Sunday, October 11, 2015 at 17:06 UK Last Updated: Sunday, October 11, 2015 at 17:08 UK \nNorthern Ireland striker Josh Magennis has stated that Scotland should follow his nation's example and stick with current head coach Gordon Strachan . \nThe 25-year-old feels that Scotland should give time to Gordon Strachan as Northern Ireland did with Michael O'Neill , who guided the country to Euro 2016 with a 3-1 victory over Greece on Thursday. \n\"I think Scotland are doing the right thing if they offer Gordon a new contract, because it takes time,\" Magennis told BBC Sport . \n\"When Michael first came in, it was hard for him to get across what he wanted. We do have a lot of quality individuals who have played an extreme amount of games in the Premier League - Jonny Evans , Steve Davis , Gareth McAuley , Chris Brunt , Roy Carroll , the list goes on. \n\"But there's one thing we have that other teams might not have in abundance and that's the willingness to fight for each other until the death.\" \nKilmarnock striker Magennis, who dropped to the bench for Northern Ireland's clash away to Finland on Sunday, notched his first international goal in the win over Greece.
