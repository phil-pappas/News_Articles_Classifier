More > KANSAS CITY, MO (KCTV) - \nParty like it's the ALDS. \nThe Kansas City Royals announced Friday that they aren't making any changes to their roster for the ALCS. \nThat means speedster Terrance Gore can again change the game by coming into the late innings as a pinch runner. Jonny Gomes who the Royals traded for this summer will remain on the bench as an inspirational leader. \nGore hadn't been caught stealing in the big leagues until Monday's game against the Astros, and that took a controversial official review. \nThe Royals send out Edinson Volquez as their starting pitcher while the Blue Jays counter with Marco Estrada. \nThe umpires are Tony Randazzo, Laz Diaz, John Hirschbeck, who is the crew chief, Hunter Wendelstedt, Dan Iassogna, Jeff Nelson and Jim Reynolds. \nDiaz was attacked by a fan when the Royals played the White Sox in Chicago in 2003. \nFirst pitch is scheduled for 7:07 p.m. at Kauffman Stadium.
