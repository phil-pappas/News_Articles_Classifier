(Photo: Vaughn Wilson/FAMU Athletics) CONNECT 4 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE First quarter: NCCU 10, FAMU 3 \nFAMU managed to take its first drive for a score, but the Rattlers still trail North Carolina Central after one quarter at Bragg Memorial Stadium. \nColby Blanton's 46-yard field goal gave FAMU an early 3-0 lead, but the Eagles immediately drove the ball down the field for a field goal of their own. NCCU then used prime field position that followed a blocked punt to score its first touchdown of the game. \nRedshirt freshman running back Dorrel McClain took the ball in for the score from two yards out. \nCarson Royal got the start for FAMU and hasn't shared time with backup quarterback Kenny Coleman yet. Pregame \nFlorida A&M (0-5) begins a three-game stretch of home games with North Carolina Central (1-3). The Rattlers (13 points per game) are still struggling to move the ball and are coming off a loss to Savannah State. NCCU is ranked No. 3 in scoring in the MEAC (28 points per game). Just the facts: FAMU vs. NCCU preview box Players to watch \nRB Devondrick Nealy: Devondrick Nealy has struggled on the ground (2.1 yards per carry), but always finds some way to spark FAMU's offense. He's a leader on and off the field, and it'll likely be his job to get the Rattlers going today. \nNCCU safety C.J. Moore: I don't usually pick players who aren't on FAMU's roster as people to watch, but Moore is coming off a stellar performance against Bethune-Cookman (11 tackles, two hits for losses and two interceptions) that earned him MEAC Defensive Player of the Week honors. FAMU's quarterback play has been shaky all season, so he's looking to earn another weekly award. \nSafety Jacques Bryant: Bryant has quietly lived up to his preseason All-MEAC billing. He leads the Rattlers with 40 total tackles, has knocked down two passes and has an interception. He's been all over the field this year, he'll have his hands full against an offense that scores on 93 percent of its red zone attempts. FAMU head coach Alex Wood: ‘We need to keep working at it’ Bold predictions \nMalcolm Bell will throw a deep pass that'll get picked off by Bryant. Bell doesn't throw deep often, and more often than not he makes plays with his legs, but he'll try and test the Rattlers' secondary at least once. \nNealy will have a rushing touchdown of at least 10 yards. The Rattlers' ground game has struggled all season and things won't get much easier against NCCU's rushing defense, which is ranked fourth in the conference. Still, Nealy plays with a lot of heart, and I can see him breaking through NCCU's stout front seven. \nFAMU will score twice in the second quarter. For whatever reason, the second quarter has been awful fo rthe Rattlers this season. The team has scored just once all season in the second quarter. If FAMU wants to make this one competitive, it'll have to score and carry some momentum into halftime. FAMU AD Overton: Coaches need time Forecast \nClouds should roll through Tallahassee when the Rattlers kick off at 5 p.m., but there's only a 15 percent chance of rain, and that chance tapers off later in the evening. Temperatures will start in the mid-80s, but drop to the low 70s.
