Supreme Court this week, alleging city Coun. Kerry Jang defamed him in a news story about “The Living Stones” project.\nThe court document claims the city breached its contract by eliminating the project and refusing to return the memorial stones.\nConceived by Kirkham, the project was to see 62 plaques installed at the last-known locations of the missing or murdered women.\nOnly four plaques were ever installed and three were taken away earlier this year over what a city spokesman called a lack of consensus among the women’s families.\nThe three removed plaques commemorated the lives of Georgina Papin, Marnie Frey and Brenda Wolfe, all women murdered by serial killer Robert Pickton. A plaque honouring Cara Ellis has not yet been removed.\nKirkham has cited Quote: s in an October 2013 news story, in which he alleged Jang said the city was looking at taking over the project, and it couldn’t “rely on (Kirkham) anymore.”\n“Kirkham and the Living Memorial Stones project has been brought into public scandal and contempt, suffered, and will continue to suffer, grave damage to his character and reputation,” the statement said.\n“Kirkham has suffered distress and embarrassment as a result of the City of Vancouver’s (Coun. Kerry Jang’s) statements.”\nNeither Jang nor the media outlet are named as defendants in the notice but both are referred to in the lawsuit. Named as defendants are the City of Vancouver and the Public Art Committee.\nKirkham also alleged the “censorship” of the project is a charter violation.\nNone of the allegations have been tested in court, and the city was unavailable for comment.\nJang said in an email he was unaware of the lawsuit and declined to comment because it’s a legal matter.\nIn additional to the general, special, aggravated and punitive damages, Kirkham is seeking injunctions restraining the defendants from publishing any defamatory comments.\nHe is also seeking courts costs and wants an apology.\nNote to readers: This is a corrected story. A previous version said all four memorial plaques were removed.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T23:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T12:45:50.395+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
