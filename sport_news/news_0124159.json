Ordinary rechargeable batteries earned a poor reputation with consumers who found they needed to pre-charge them before their initial use, that they lost power when not in use and they traditionally powered devices for less time than an alkaline battery. They also rarely appeared on preparedness” lists because they used AC chargers that rendered them as useless when there is no AC power available from the 'grid'.\nDisposable single-use alkaline batteries have been the ‘go-to’ choice for emergency preparedness consumers since their market introduction over 50-years ago. But their single-use nature has kept them from being used by mobile device manufacturers. A smartphone consumer would need to buy a 4-pack of alkaline batteries daily in order to keep a smartphone powered for example. Meanwhile mobile battery technology evolved by leaps the past 5-decades and now reliably powers smartphones with years of rechargeable juice.\nSo why not cram that same rechargeable juice into an AA battery as well? That is exactly what the makers of the new JUICE® RePlay batteries did in creating new hybrid batteries that merge the convenience of alkaline with the rechargeable juice of mobile batteries. Changes to the internal construction of the battery along with creating new USB Charge Systems like those used by smartphones resulted in the viable new JUICE® REPLAY design.\nThese changes overcome previous limitation to yesterday’s ordinary disposable and rechargeable batteries. JUICE Replay batteries ( http://www.juicereplay.com/ ) and chargers were created to replace disposable AA, AAA, C or D size batteries. For those seeking even more JUICE®, the Extreme RePlay batteries and USB Smart Chargers offer double the power and faster charge times than the regular JUICE® REPLAY batteries. The results include:\n No need to pre-charge the batteries. They are ready to use right out of the pack. Power higher-drain devices up to 4 times longer than regular alkaline batteries. Recharge in 40-Minutes then Replay them again up to 1,000 times or 5-years. Plug USB Micro Cable into any USB port just like a smartphone to charge.\nDue to their superior charge retention they also will not lose their juice when not in use like ordinary rechargeable batteries. Most mobile devices need to be recharged after 3-months of non-use prior to being able to use them again. Whereas JUICE® RePlay batteries will retain 80% of their charge after 2-years of non-use with enough juice to power a device before being recharged. Due to their USB Charge design they are ideal for off grid solar charging. All this plus superior cool weather performance versus alkaline combine to offer off grid consumers a viable alternative.\nAn Indiegogo Campaign ( http://bit.ly/1MZnWOP ) was launched coinciding with National Preparedness Day featuring the newly designed JUICE® Replay Hybrid batteries. The Campaign, seeks funding to help bring its products to market and achieved over 40% of its funding goals in the first two-days of its scheduled 35-day run at the time of this release. A $27 Family Bundle with 4-JUICE RePlay Starter Kits is part of the reward perks being offered to campaign backers. Each Starter Kt in the Bundle includes 4-JUICE® RePlay batteries plus a USB Charger and Micro Cable. This works out to only a $6.75 average Starter Kit cost. JUICE® Extreme RePlay bundles are also available.\nSolar Panels, USB Chargers and Power Banks to help power or charge mobile devices and the JUICE® RePlay batteries when off the grid and Personal hydration and multi-tools complete the LEAP OFF GRID reward offerings. These rewards range from a $375 Leap Off Grid Preparedness Kit to bundles as low as $15 with $5 component costs. The design and prototyping has been completed. The Indiegogo Campaign was launched to help fund the initial production run and offers products from this anticipated production run as the reward perks to its campaign backers.\nFor media inquiries please contact either media(at)leapoffgrid(dot)com or brent(at)leapoffgrid(dot)com\n //www.prweb.com/releases/leapoffgrid/indiegogo/prweb12998904.htm\n ", "external_links": ["http://leapoffgrid.com/", "http://www.juicereplay.com/", "http://bit.ly/1MZnWOP", "http://www.prweb.com/releases/leapoffgrid/indiegogo/prweb12998904.htm"], "published": "2015-10-03T13:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T12:38:41.849+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
