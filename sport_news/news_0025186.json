He wouldn't be able to resume spraying until July 2017. The agency also proposed fining Owen and his company $1,480. The decision can be appealed.\nThe state waived a $20,000 fine against Owen earlier this year after he protested its penalty for the 2013 Curry County incident. He didn't respond to calls for comment.\nThe penalties are a sharp turnaround from an agency that botched its initial response to the Douglas County incident. The Department of Agriculture at first refused to investigate after Dena Reynolds called in July 2014 to complain about chemicals drifting onto her property and giving her headaches.\nThe agency didn't send an investigator for eight months – dispatching someone only after The Oregonian/OregonLive asked why no one initially investigated and Reynolds again complained.\nReynolds said she was heartened by the proposed license suspension, even though she remains frustrated by the way the state handled her complaint. Spraying companies \"might now say we need to be careful and follow the rules,\" Reynolds said. \"I hope that happens.\"\nThe Department of Agriculture has long been criticized by residents affected by off-target sprays for failing to aggressively enforce state laws designed to protect them. That appears to be changing, something advocates say is overdue.\n\"They really had the spotlight turned on them in the state legislature this year,\" said Lisa Arkin, executive director of Beyond Toxics, a Eugene advocacy group. \"I think it was a wakeup call for the agency's leader that the culture was completely off the mark.\"\nIn the last month, the department also suspended the license of another company, Applebee Aviation, whose questionable practices were exposed by timber whistleblower Darryl Ivy . The state took Applebee Aviation to court to stop it from continuing to spray while its license was revoked. A Washington County Circuit Court judge on Monday extended a temporary injunction prohibiting the company from spraying for another 30 days.\nAfter initially proposing an $1,100 fine and short license revocation, the state last week said it would suspend Applebee's ability to spray for a year and fine it $40,000. The state found that Applebee had sprayed four times in the last month while its license was suspended.\nBruce Pokarney, an Agriculture Department spokesman, said the agency's enforcement actions haven't been based on any internal decision to be stricter, but rather the specific circumstances of each incident.\n\"In both cases, [the department] worked closely with the Department of Justice and determined that license revocation was an appropriate regulatory action,\" Pokarney said.\nThe state agency is also pursuing records of a 2012 spray involving Owen in Curry County that it initially refused to examine. That incident, featured in an investigation by The Oregonian/OregonLive , was one of several red flags the agency ignored before 20 people complained about being sprayed a year later.\nIn the incident, Curry County resident Jim Sweeney saw a helicopter spraying in high winds near his house and called the state to complain. Sweeney said he could smell the chemicals for weeks and developed a cough that wouldn't go away for months.\nNeither the Department of Agriculture nor the state Department of Forestry fully investigated. Though companies have to maintain records of their spray operations for three years and provide them to the state when requested, the agencies had not requested them.\nNow, with that three-year window about to lapse, the Department of Agriculture has given Owen a Monday deadline to provide the records.\n— Rob Davis\nrdavis@oregonian.com\n503.294.7657\n@robwdavis", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/robwdavis"], "published": "2015-10-19T22:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T06:09:32.622+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
