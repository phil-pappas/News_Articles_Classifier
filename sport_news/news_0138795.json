Toppings matter, of course, but the baseline for critiquing pizza is on merits of dough and cooking method. Think about it this way: If you don't have a good crust, you don't have a good pizza, no matter what's on top.\nIn Naperville, the 3-year-old Fiamme adheres to the strict guidelines of Neapolitan crusts: double-zero flour, an 800-degree brick oven that produces blistering pies in less than two minutes. But I'm drawn to the restaurant because of a seldom-seen variant called montanara, or pizze fritte â€” or, in more alluring terms, fried pizza.\nWhat happens here is pizza dough gets flash-fried for 45 seconds before getting finished in the oven for 75 seconds. That quick fry puffs up the interior and gives the pizza a crisp chew, reminiscent of Native American fry bread. It also adds a richness that reminds me of a buttery breadstick. Fried pizza: It's a wholly Italian concept that seems wholly American. Fiamme, 19 N. Washington St., Naperville, 630-470-9441 , fiammepizza.com . There are two pizzas listed under the \"pizze fritte\" heading, but the fried option is available with any toppings.\nkpang@tribpub.com\nTwitter @pang\nPrivacy Policy Dining and Drinking Entertainment", "external_links": ["http://www.tribpub.com/privacy-policy-and-your-privacy-rights/", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-562a5722/turbine/ct-fried-pizza-fiamme-naperville-pizze-fritte-montanara-food-1028-20151023"], "published": "2015-10-23T18:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T00:13:28.101+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
