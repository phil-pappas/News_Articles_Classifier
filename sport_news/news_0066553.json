Seconds after calling an old friend for an on-air interview on Monday, WNYE-FM radio host Vinny Aceto had a scary epiphany, not unlike realizing you’ve left the stove on after hustling off to work.\nThe recording device that tapes his interviews had stopped working, and audio from the previous 30 minutes of his show was lost. Or so he thought.\n“Steve, I got to go. Call you back,” Aceto said, slamming the phone down and sprinting out of the tiny basement recording studio. Moments later, he returned.\n“None of it was recorded,” he said.\nAceto frowned and pressed his well-coiffed head against the wall behind the desk where he performs his weekly radio show “On the Sidelines,” the only program in the city devoted exclusively to high school sports.\nOn Monday, Aceto delivered what he said would be the final show of a 24-year run, to be broadcast Friday at 1 p.m. on 91.5 FM. The task of putting together an hour-long program — booking guests, taping and editing it, all by himself — had become too much for him, he said, especially when coupled with his duties as a full-time engineer at the station in downtown Brooklyn that operates under the Mayor’s Office of Media and Entertainment.\nAceto had also grown disillusioned with the mounting commercialization and professionalization of high school sports, saying, “It’s lost its innocence.”\nAs a result, he’s hanging up his headphones after the airing of Friday’s show.\n“After 24 years, I don’t know what else I can do,” Aceto said during a break on Monday. “There are so many different outlets for a student-athlete to be recognized, whether it’s the newspaper, internet now. And it’s really difficult to be one person and to put something like this together. A one man show at this point — can’t do it, and I never thought I’d say this, but I’ve lost the passion. I lost passion that I’ve been bringing here for 24 years and before that as a little kid.”\nAceto had some key figures on with him to mark the final program, from Bryan Durr — a former radio host who first allowed Aceto to do short updates on his show in 1989; to Alex Best — his former on-air partner; to Steve Peretzman — a former Lincoln football coach who sparked Aceto’s romance with high school sports by allowing him to roam the sideline as a statistician when he was a high school sophomore.\nJoe Malone, a former PSAL baseball commissioner who helped Aceto and the station gain broadcast rights to the city title game at Yankee Stadium, will also be on, as will Murry Bergtraum girls basketball coach Ed Grezinsky and Daily News sports reporter Roger Rubin, who will discuss media coverage of high school sports.\nGrezinsky was surprised, and disappointed, to learn that Aceto would be signing off.\n“He will be sorely missed,” said Grezinsky, who worked as a color commentator with Aceto for PSAL championship basketball games in his early days as a coach. “He really provided a service to the kids and coaches in the city that wasn’t there before him. He really did his homework and put his heart and soul into it.”\nThat passion was on display on Monday, as Aceto struggled to read a statement he had prepared as the final words of his show. He appeared to be overcome with emotion.\n“So for the last time, for everyone at Radio NYC, I’m Vinny Aceto, reminding you to be a part of the game,” he read. “Get off the bench! And I’ll see you, on the sidelines!”\nAnd with that, Green Day’s “Time of Your Life” blasted through a speaker.\nMoments later, Aceto returned from the control room down the hall with some good news.\n“Everything was recorded,” he said, letting out a deep sigh before smiling. “Now you see what I go through every week?”\nmabramson@nydailynews.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T18:32:10.132+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
