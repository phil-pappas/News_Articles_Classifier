Spartans sweep victory over Rossville on Senior Day By Stephen Coleman stephen@emporia.com emporiagazette.com | 0 comments \nThere may not be an abundance of seniors on the 2015 Emporia High volleyball team, but senior day on Thursday was still another display of the Spartans’ success. EHS was announced this week to have moved up to the sixth-ranked team in 5A and the Spartans responded with a three-set sweep over Rossville, 25-15, 25-17, 25-11. \n“It was senior night, I just felt like they handled everything well,” EHS head coach Carly Spicer said. “We brought up the conversation, we’re hosting sub-state. This is a big game for us, just being on our court because we haven’t played a lot of home games and they took initiative and played well, I thought.” \nThe first set opened in tight fashion, but as soon as Emporia established a two-point advantage, Rossville struggled to catch back up. With the score 12-10, the Spartans broke away on a 10-1 run to pull away for the 25-15 victory. \n“We’ve really learned how to connect with each other and play as a team better,” said senior Emma Harmon of the team’s improvement to the tune of a vastly improved 26-5 record. “This win definitely helped out ... so it feels great.” \nThe second set started quite differently but ended in similar fashion. The Spartans opened with a 6-0 run, but Rossville fought back to take the lead at 16-15. Emporia High closed it out again as Allie Christensen and Kelsey Gordon created a strong attack as well as a defensive presence on the net. \n“Both did a great job,” Spicer said. “I would also add Lexie Longbine in the back row and Emma Harmon, (they help) take over and start some passing every time and they start out the offense.” \nThe third and final set was all Emporia. Rossville fought to rally early, but the Spartans’ pressure was too much, pulling away to finish with the 14-point margin at 25-11. \nGordon led the Spartans with 13 kills, while Christensen had eight and Mikayla Simons had nine. Jennica Smith tallied 26 assists on the night. \nFor the Spartans, however, when they were able to work with a lead, they played more relaxed. They had extensive runs of at least 6-0 in all three sets. \n“It’s huge to get those runs like that,” Spicer said. “In the beginning I’m like ‘we need to pull away.’ It’ll ease up the pressure on us and we can control our side and play our type of ball game.” \nThe Spartans host a 10-team tournament on Saturday, with their first match scheduled for 8:30 a.m. against Lawrence in pool play. EHS will also play Maize, Washburn Rural and Bonner Springs before bracket play begins.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T17:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T02:46:26.281+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
