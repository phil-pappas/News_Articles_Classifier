Blue and orange sections.\n*** Gus Malzahn: \"I'm very excited for our team and our coaches. That was a big win.\"\n*** Why punt on fourth-and-1 at the end? \"We felt like we could pin them down, they had zero timeouts, their field goal kicker had been banged up...\"\n*** Defense makes plays when they need to make them? \"The Carlton Davis was big, there's no doubt.\"\n*** On QB Sean White: \"Our offensive line did a good job giving him time.\" Had some explosive plays.\n*** Daniel Carlson: \"He does practice punting. He's just a full-time kicker and that's helped him.\" ... Not a lot of kickoffs returned this season. \"He's one of the best kickers in the country.\" The 52-yarder would have been good from 62 yards, says Malzahn.\n*** He feels they're doing a good job on returns.\n*** Tight ends? They're young. \"We rotate a couple of guys\" and H-Backs are \"more of a factor\" this year than the tight ends.\n*** Lull in third quarter against Kentucky. What's up with that? \"The main reason was third down. We had one that was a bang-bang deal\" with Ricardo Louis and another throw behind Louis. \"Those are the two big plays that stand out in our mind.\"\n*** More on Louis' 154 yards: \"It's his time.\"\n*** Fan question: Arkansas running back Alex Collins is good. \"What are the plans, special or otherwise, to slow this guy down?\" He will be a focal point, Malzahn says. \"He can hit anywhere on the field. ... The speed to get to the perimeter is really something, too.\"\n\"They have multiple running backs we feel are talented.\"\n*** Arkansas quarterback Brandon Allen: \"They've got a lot of trust in him.\" Running game helps him and makes it challenging.\n\"They do a very good job within their scheme. They're very good at stopping the run.\"\n*** AL.com question of the week is from John in Huntsville: Kentucky had eight men on the field when you were preparing to kick. Any sort of audible if that happens to take advantage? \"In all phases, we usually have certain situations and answers but ... \" that \"was very unique, but we were very committed to kicking the ball and pinning them back.\"\n*** Physical game coming up at Arkansas, opines an AL.com fan: \"We'll end up seeing. We like playing physical football, too.\"\n*** Different feeling going home: \"It's always different. That's where I grew up.\" ... It's always a little bit different but you have a job to do. It's a very tough place to play.\"\n*** Difference for Arkansas is Brandon Allen at quarterback. Experience is really helping.\n*** \"Very few teams across the country will improve this time of year.\" But Auburn has opportunity. He say this team is improving and you can see it in practice.\n*** Keys to a win Saturday: Stop the running back, run the ball, protect the football.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T08:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T07:38:50.977+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
