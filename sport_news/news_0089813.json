Both have already made contributions to the side in this tournament and I’m sure they’ll continue to contribute in spades.” \nCheika’s aim since he took over as coach a year ago was to put together a playing system that squad players would be able to slot into when necessary. \n“We’ve been working hard over the last 10, 11 months to get real depth in all positions,” he said. \n“I know Pocock and Folau are great players but I really believe in the guys who are coming into their positions. That’s something we want to build on.” \nIn the other change to the side, Rob Simmons comes into the second row for Dean Mumm to fix a lineout that struggled at times in the epic pool victory over Wales last week. \nSimmons, who started the pool games against Fiji and England before losing his place for the Wales match, said the rivalry with Mumm had been good for both players. \n“We’ve been pushing each other and we help each other out from week to week too, on how we’re going to run the lineout and things like that,” the 26-year-old said. \n“There’s been a bit of competition and Cheik’s selection has been keeping us on our toes.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T23:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T04:47:07.641+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
