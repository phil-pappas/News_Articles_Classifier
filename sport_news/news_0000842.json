(AP) -- La Verdad will return on short rest for the $1 million Breeders' Cup Filly & Mare Sprint on Saturday at Keeneland. \nTrainer Linda Rice decided Sunday to wheel the 5-year-old back into action only one week after her 3 3/4-length win against New York breds in the $150,000 Iroquois Stakes at Belmont Park. \nLa Verdad, 6 for 6 this year, is slated for retirement as a broodmare at the end of the season - a factor in the Breeders' Cup decision. \n\"She's going to move on to her new career soon,\" Rice said. \"Any way you look at it, there's not a lot to lose. It's all upside. The only thing she is missing is a Grade 1 victory, and we're going to give her a chance.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T22:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T00:18:43.856+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
