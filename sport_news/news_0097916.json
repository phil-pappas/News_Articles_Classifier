It is good to have got back and not really feel too far away from it. \n“We have taken four points from two games and kept a clean sheet at Fulham and that is something I am proud of.” \nAnd the defender said he aims to help develop younger players in the dressing room despite himself being only 25. \n“I have always been told I have an old head on young shoulders,” he laughed.
