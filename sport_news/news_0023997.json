(AP Photo/John Raoux) \nHOUSTON (AP) — The Houston Texans have flip-flopped between Brian Hoyer and Ryan Mallett throughout the early part of this season. \nThat indecision at quarterback appears to be over now after Hoyer’s strong performance in Houston’s win over the Jaguars on Sunday. \n“He’s our quarterback,” coach Bill O’Brien said. “We’re going to stick with him. He’s playing really well. He’s playing at a high level, and we’ve got a lot of confidence in him.” \nHoyer made his second start this season on Sunday and it was the first time he both started and finished a game. \nHe won the starting job out of camp, but was benched during the season opener after struggling early in that game. But Mallett had a tough time in his three starts and Hoyer took over in the last two of them before regaining the starting job last week. \n___ \nAP NFL website: www.pro32.ap.org and AP NFL Twitter feed: www.twitter.com/AP_NFL Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T01:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T01:56:18.703+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
