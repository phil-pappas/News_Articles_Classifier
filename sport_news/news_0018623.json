Having rejected a contract extension on improved terms, Mark and his agent made it clear he was keen to explore options elsewhere and in these situations, it is better for all parties to find a solution professionally.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T17:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T20:13:02.672+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
