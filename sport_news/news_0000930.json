The Aggies hadn't won in Fresno since 1980 and hadn't beaten Boise State since 1997. \n\nThe Aggies have not faced a running back as good as San Diego State's Donnel Pumphrey since week two when they took on Hiesman contender Devontae Booker and Utah. Head coach Matt Wells is very aware of Pumphrey's skill and the depth of the Aztecs back field. \n\"Probably not arguably; I don't know how many people will argue with that. He is really good,\" Wells said. \"We have not played San Diego State yet (since joining the MW), but we have seen them on cross tape quite a bit in the last couple of years. With the other two running backs, this may be the best running backs group in the Mountain West. I know a lot about (Rashaad) Penny since we tried to recruit him. He's a great kickoff returner and has a great skill set. He catches the ball out of the backfield. On paper, he's the third running back, but they're using him quite a bit. That's a really deep group.\" \n\nIt will be critical for the offensive line to control the line early. I will help establish a rush game against a stout defense and allow Kent Myers and the rest of the skill positions to get into an early rhythm. The Aztecs are only giving up an average of 94 yards on the ground and only 293 total yards each week. Wells spoke to the challenge that the Aztecs defense presents. \n\"They're two similar defenses in terms of tough guys, in terms of stopping the run first, getting a lot of hats to the box and trying to outnumber offenses in the run game,\" he said. \"They're trying to stop the run just like we are and I think we're both very similar in that. We're both very aggressive and very multiple on defense, \n\nWells spoke after the Fresno State game about how important it is to create your own energy when playing on the road. \n\"One of the things we talked about was playing physical and starting fast right out of the game, and I thought we did that,\" he said. \"When you go on the road, you have to create your own energy and your own juice, and that was a big point for us during the day before and the day of, to talk about that.\" \nFacing a tough road test Friday night, the Aggies can't afford to come out flat against a very good San Diego State squad. Finding an offensive rhythm and making big plays on defense will help get the Aggies rolling and make it tough for the Aztecs to stop them.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T23:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T07:24:04.364+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
