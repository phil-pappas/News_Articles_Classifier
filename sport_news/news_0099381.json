The rosters were due before the start of Game 1 on Friday night at Kauffman Stadium. Toronto manager John Gibbons indicated Thursday there wouldn't be much different, if anything, from the squad he used against Texas. That means left-hander Aaron Loup is part of the roster after he missed the final two games of the divisional round with a family issue. The Royals decided to keep speedster Terrance Gore and outfield substitute Paulo Orlando on the roster they used against Houston. That means Jonny Gomes will remain off the roster.
