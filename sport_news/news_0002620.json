Everything happens for a reason and here we are.”\nForget February, there would have been some pretty long odds on Flores playing anywhere in the postseason as recently as the end of July.\nBut it’s much easier for Flores to put his season in perspective in late October than it would have been at almost any other point of 2015.\nPrior to this unexpected postseason run, the most lasting image of the Mets’ season was that of Flores openly crying on the field during a 7-3 loss at home to the Padres when he learned he had been traded — or so he thought.\nNews leaked while the game was still going that he was to be sent to Milwaukee, with Zack Wheeler, in exchange for center fielder Carlos Gomez.\nWhat Flores didn’t know was the trade was pending physicals. The Mets were eventually scared off by a hip injury to Gomez and the deal fell through.\nTwo nights later, still a Met, Flores hit a walk-off homer in the 12th inning to beat the Nationals.\n“Sometimes I still think about that trade,” said Flores, who stayed in Queens, while the Mets ended up sending a pair of minor leaguers to Detroit in exchange for Yoenis Cespedes. “And I think, ‘Where would I be now if I had been traded?’ If that happened, I’d have gone to play in Milwaukee and then I’d go home and watch the World Series.”\nIt wasn’t the last time Flores made the most of a second chance.\nPrior to Tejada’s injury, Flores had played just one full game since Sept. 19, as Terry Collins opted for Tejada’s defense over Flores’ bat.\nBut with Tejada out for the postseason, Flores was back on the field and hasn’t left.\n“I know Ruben is excited for me and the rest of the team,” Flores said. “He wants to be here. No one wants to miss something like this.”\nAnd Flores isn’t, even if he’s playing a much different role than he anticipated when he once believed his season would be over by now.\n“I’m a baseball fan, so I would have watched,” Flores said. “Last year, I watched Kansas City and the Giants. This time, I would have been a little sad if the Mets were here and I was home, but I know I would have had to see it.”\nHe’ll have a better view from shortstop.\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google Whatsapp Email Filed under mlb playoffs ,  new york mets ,  wilmer flores ,  world series", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T04:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T12:55:58.828+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
