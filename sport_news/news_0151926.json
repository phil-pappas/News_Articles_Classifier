This gives them homefield advantage in that game as well as the ability to line up whatever pitcher (probably Masahiro Tanaka ) they want on the mound. Currently there are still four teams (the Houston Astros, Texas Rangers, Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim and Minnesota Twins ) who could end up being their opponent.\nTonight's victory also happened to be the 10,000th in team history, making the Yankees the first team in the American League to reach that mark (though to be fair it's not like, say, the Rays were around in the early 1900s). It was won by a guy (pictured above) who was developed through somebody else's farm system, became a star, and then came to the Bronx for a lot of money. In other words it was pretty appropriate.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T06:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T12:23:02.493+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
