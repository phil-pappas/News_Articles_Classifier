But what a pretty prairie it is out here at Soapstone Prairie Natural Area. \nThe rolling fields of blonde sideoats grama wave in a golden shimmer as the sun descends on this warm mid-October Monday. Three-leaf sumac hangs on to its fall color, displaying vibrant, campfire-like shades of orange and red. \nThe 11.7-mile Cheyenne Ridge Trail takes me through brown buffalo grass, climbing, weaving and descending in and out of dry washes and across narrow rock outcroppings and gorgeous redrock ridges. \nLike Pawnee National Grasslands, you won’t be blown away by the scenery from the parking lot, but the deeper you go into this 28-square-mile natural area, the more beauty you’ll find. \nYou’ve probably heard about Soapstone Prairie thanks to a pair of furry animals that call, or soon will call, the 18,728 acres near the Wyoming border home. \nIn September 2014, 42 endangered black-footed ferrets were released onto the prairie, and earlier this month, 17 more of the cute critters joined their comrades at Soapstone. \nAs cool as that is, the natural area’s big headline animal is the 10 bison that, come Nov. 1, will roam 800 acres of this shortgrass prairie. The future - and at one time past - home of the bison is visible from Soapstone’s entrance road and the recently realigned Cheyenne Rim Trail. \nI think of the bison during my ride on the singletrack trail, imagining the 30 million 1,500-pound mammals that used to freely roam North America’s plains. What a powerful, majestic animal. \nI wouldn’t want to come up close to one. \nLast month, the first 3 miles of the Cheyenne Ridge Trail were rerouted to avoid any bison-biker-hiker-horseback rider conflicts. \nWhew. Buy Photo \nSoapstone Prairie Natural Area, north of Fort Collins, offers great mountain biking on several miles of trails. (Photo: Stephen Meyers/The Coloradoan) \nComing around a bend, I see a herd of pronghorn antelope 50 yards away, grazing on a hill. The squeaks of my brakes spooked the sleek, fast animals, and after a short stare down, they gallop away. \nMy destination on this mountain bike ride is adjoining Red Mountain Open Space’s Big Hole, a striking geological feature. You’re riding along through the grassland, when, bam, you arrive to a scene of gorgeous redrock and a dry wash floor featuring millions of years worth of uplift, folding and erosion. \nBy this time, the wind and the trail’s rolling hills leave me zapped, even though I want to explore more. \nThe opportunity is there for an epic day of mountain bike riding. \nThe Cheyenne Rim Trail continues into Red Mountain Open Space, where you can ride all the way into Wyoming’s Big Hole Open Space. Cheyenne Rim also connects with the Canyon Trail, which takes you into the eastern portion of Soapstone Prairie. \nPerhaps the best part? \nThe lack of people. \nIf you’re into finding solitude and a remote experience, Soapstone Prairie is your place. I encounter one person - a horseback rider - during my ride. \nJust remember, this is the unforgiving plains, where storms can arrive with no notice, temperatures can greatly and quickly fluctuate and you’re more than an hour away from emergency services. The conditions are so harsh, the natural area is closed December through February. \nSo go now to experience the most natural of Fort Collins' natural areas. \nSoapstone Prairie Natural Area \nWhere: 25 miles north of Fort Collins.
