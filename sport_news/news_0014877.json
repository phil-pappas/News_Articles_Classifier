I read the article in the Sammamish Review and was outraged to say the least when I saw this, and I quote, “I do not want to be showering with someone like that,” said one Sammamish resident in a call to the Sammamish Review. “I certainly don’t want my children or grandchildren exposed to that.” \nTypical response I would only expect out of the average Sammamish resident. Seriously?! I must say “that” is a human being with feelings and blood and a heart. So in dealing with this on a case-by-case basis I’m ashamed of you David Mayer. From my perspective I believe all lives matter and deserve the same respect. \nIf this person who said these things doesn’t like it then she can take herself to another facility. I’ve been a resident of Sammamish for 10+ years and believe me, not by choice. If I had it any other way I would move away but unfortunately I’m stuck for the time being. \nI think what needs to be taught here is a lesson to all in tolerance. \nJulia A.
