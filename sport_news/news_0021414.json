But after back-to-back overtime victories over the Rangers Sunday afternoon and the Arizona Coyotes Tuesday night, the Devils have captured five of a possible six points in their last three games.\nThe excitement was evident in Travis Zajac's celebration after he scored his first goal of the season. Mike Cammalleri said sarcastically that he was \"pretty impressed\" by Zajac's celebration but wondered if the center might have injured himself celebrating.\n\"Exceptional. I thought he played well,\" Cammalleri said of Zajac's performance. \"We all have a lot of respect for the way Travis plays the game. He plays a lot of hard minutes every night. Seeing him finish on the offensive side was great.\n\"Pretty impressed with his celebration, too. I thought it had great enthusiasm and energy, although we're a little worried about his body after it. See how he comes out of it. Get some ice packs out.\"\nThen there was Adam Larsson , the defenseman who is starting to show that he can do everything, including breaking up a Coyotes rush in OT, heading up ice and burying the puck on Zajac's pass for a 3-2 Devils win.\n\"It was an awesome feeling. I don't score a lot of goals,\" Larsson said. \"It was good for the team to win another in overtime.\"\nRELATED: Devils make it two in a row with OT win over Coyotes Larsson described the winning sequence.\n\"We broke up the play in the defensive zone and came up 3-on-1,\" he said. \"I passed to Stemper ( Lee Stempniak ) and somehow it bounced to Trav on the far side. He made a great pass to me, so I just banked it in.\"\nZajac said of Larsson: \"Great play up until the pass he made. No, he's a heads-up player. Three-on-three you just have to try and capitalize on your opportunities.\"\nThat brought another smile to Larsson's face.\n\"That was a bad pass from me, actually,\" the young defenseman said.\nZajac finished with a goal and two assists and was plus-3 while winning 17 of 25 face-offs.\nLarsson led all Devils in ice time with 23:55, was plus-2 and blocked three shots.\n\"What's been surprising with him is his professionalism,\" coach John Hynes said of Larsson. \"He's an everyday guy. He's really focused and he has the details around the game in order. He's very fit, he takes care of himself and he has a lot of attention to detail off the ice. He watches his shifts and it's all on his own initiative as a young player. Then you see his talent level.\n\"I think that consistency and professionalism has really helped him get off to a good start this year. It has been real impressive to watch this as a coaching staff.\"\nIt's very early, of course, but it's been almost as impressive to see the Devils refuse to be pushovers. Reason for them to smile.\n* * *\nWinger Tuomo Ruutu, scratched from the last two games, was wearing a walking boot on his right foot. Although he was moving quickly without much trouble, Ruutu clearly has an issue with his foot.\nRich Chere may be reached at rchere@njadvancemedia.com . Follow him on Twitter @Ledger_NJDevils .
