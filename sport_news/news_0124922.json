The junior and outside hitter had delivered a powerful kill to send the Lincoln volleyball team to match point. But Thompson, ever a calming force, turned around nonchalantly to give high fives to her teammates. The match-winner, however, was a different story. Thompson smacked an ace, leaping into the air with a single fist pump to celebrate, as Lincoln beat rival St. Mary’s 25-17, 25-21, 20-25, 26-24 in a Tri-City Athletic League match Monday at Morelli Gym. The Trojans are currently alone atop the TCAL. “She’s quiet, and she’s always going to be quiet. But everybody depends on her,” Trojans co-coach Garren Allala said, about the returning All-Area first-team pick. “If you’re not pulling your weight, she’s going to let you know.” Lincoln (15-8, 5-0 TCAL) leads St. Mary’s (24-5, 4-1) by a full game, and Tracy (15-7, 3-2) by two games in the TCAL standings. It’s the first time the Trojans have beaten the Rams on the road in 11 years, when current Chavez coach Dodd Pinkham was Lincoln’s coach. Pinkham was in-attendance Monday night. “It’s very humbling. It’s not every day you beat St. Mary’s at their own place,” Thompson said. “We’re going to take this one in, and use it for next time.” That “next time” is Oct. 28 at Lincoln in the regular-season finale. Should the Trojans run through the second half of their TCAL slate unbeaten, too, it would be the first season without a league championship for the Rams since 2004. “I’m so ridiculously proud of them. To come in here and win at St. Mary’s is a tough thing to do: everybody knows that,” Allala said. “They showed a lot of composure, a lot of maturity. They’ve really, really evolved in the last two weeks.” St. Mary’s carried all of the momentum early in Game 4, after avoiding a sweep in Game 3, taking leads of 8-3 and 9-2. The Trojans hung around, winning seven of eight points later on, punctuated by five kills from precocious sophomore Kennedy Greenwood. Greenwood posted 13 kills and 15 digs, complementing Thompson’s team-high 19 kills and 23 digs. St. Mary’s senior Ngozi Nwabuzoh, another All-Area first-team selection, had a match-high 22 kills, with 18 digs. A year ago, senior Jahlaina Williams was the one-two punch with Thompson in the Trojans' attack. Now, Thompson is the veteran, and Greenwood is learning rapidly alongside her. “Even though she’s new, she’s really catching onto the game,” Thompson said of Greenwood. “And she really knows how to execute when we need it.” Lincoln pushed St. Mary’s to match point the first time when junior setter Charissa Payne walloped an ace that landed on the back line. The Rams wouldn’t die, as Adri Baysinger had an ace of her own and Nwabuzoh unleashed a potent kill for a 24-all tie. That’s when Thompson took over. “I think we let some opportunities throughout all four games kind of go past us,” St. Mary's coach Jayne McHugh said. Sophomores in Angel Lambert had seven kills for the Trojans, while Neena Dimas added 21 digs. Rams senior Megan Culligan had 23 assists and junior Sydney Marks had nine kills. St. Mary's travels to West and Lincoln heads to Lodi to continue TCAL play, both at 6 p.m. Wednesday. “I try to keep a game face. Because if I get too rattled, then things go wrong, in my opinion,” Thompson said. “When it’s all over, that’s when it’s time to celebrate.” — Contact reporter Thomas Lawrence at (209) 546-8272 or tlawrence@recordnet.com.
