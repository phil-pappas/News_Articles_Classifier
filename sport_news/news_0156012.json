(AP) - Fire officials are trying to determine what sparked a large grass fire in Terry.\nThe fire Thursday afternoon charred 115 acres.\nFirefighter Jason Whittington tells WAPT-TV ( http://bit.ly/1QOcxiD ) that it doesn't take but a second for a fire to spread, especially with it being so dry and high winds.\nThe Terry Fire Department said it doesn't know what sparked the fire but someone was bush-hogging in a pasture area off of Green Gable Road. Authorities said they evacuated three businesses near the blaze.\nFirefighters built a fire wall to keep the flames contained in one area. Officials say smoke will continue to be seen because firefighters laid foam on the fire to keep it from spreading any further.\nInformation from: WAPT-TV, http://www.wapt.com\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
