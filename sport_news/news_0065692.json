(Lindsey Wasson/The Seattle Times) Petersen: \"I think this is a tough job and you just feel bad for the whole situation, for everybody.\" By Adam Jude Seattle Times staff reporter \nWashington coach Chris Petersen said he has sympathy for USC coach Steve Sarkisian, who was placed on indefinite leave Sunday and will reportedly seek treatment for alcohol. \n“I don’t know everything that’s gone on down there. I’ve heard a few things,” Petersen said Monday, when asked about Sarkisian. “And I think half the time everybody piles on and doesn’t really know the full story. I think this is a tough job and you just feel bad for the whole situation, for everybody.” \nPetersen’s Huskies upset Sarkisian’s Trojans, 17-12, in Los Angeles on Thursday night. \n“It’s a hard enough job when you’re doing well,” Petersen said. “And then (when) something doesn’t go right in your situation and then everybody piles on, I think it’s very tough. Everybody’s got their opinion now and I don’t think everybody knows exactly everything that goes on to have an opinion like that.” \nSeahawks coach Pete Carroll said Monday morning on 710 ESPN Seattle that Sarkisian’s situation “breaks my heart.” \nUW athletic director Scott Woodward submitted a statement to The Seattle Times. “It is evident that Steve is dealing with a serious personal matter and we wish him the best in facing whatever challenges lay ahead,” the statement from Woodward read.
