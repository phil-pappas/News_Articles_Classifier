Lions for the third and final playoff spot in the West Division, while the Red and Black need one more win to give an Ottawa team its first CFL playoff berth since the Rough Riders accomplished the feat in 1994.\nIf the RedBlacks prevail on Friday night at TD Place, it will shine an even brighter spotlight on Winnipeg and its inability to progress like Ottawa has. If the Bombers win, however, it will move them closer to their first playoff berth since 2011.\nThat's why this is a massive clash, even when you remove the playoff implications. The RedBlacks (8-6) have already gone from two wins in their inaugural season to eight this year, and they still have four games to play. The Bombers, meanwhile, can't win two in a row and continue to spin their wheels at 5-10.\nNo wonder the Winnipeg Football Club issued a press release Thursday morning saying it was freezing 2016 season ticket prices and reducing parking pass costs. If Ottawa wins on Friday night, more Winnipeg fans will want to know why the RedBlacks were able to turn it around so quickly but not the Bombers.\nIt's easy to see why the RedBlacks have improved; they went out and signed receivers who could actually catch the ball. Ottawa's starting receiving corps on Friday night will be completely different than the dismal one that faced Winnipeg last October. Twelve of Ottawa's other 19 starting positions feature the same players as last October.\n“Just to have the right group in place, have the right leadership group as far as coaching staff and management group, they've allowed this team to grow in this direction,” RedBlacks quarterback Henry Burris said Thursday. “It's because of their vision this has now become a reality.”\nGeneral manager Marcel Desjardins signed free agent receivers Brad Sinopoli, Greg Ellingson, Chris Williams and Ernest Jackson, and all have made significant impacts. The RedBlacks also inked import left tackle SirVincent Rogers, and they have surrendered 13 fewer sacks than the Bombers in one fewer game.\nBombers general manager Kyle Walters spent quite a bit of money as well and made his fair share of free agent moves, but the results haven't been there.\nThere are those who believe the RedBlacks were able to turn it around because they were an expansion team and had plenty of cap room for their second season, but Burris and Bombers quarterback Matt Nichols have both been through similar turnarounds with other established teams to shoot down that notion.\nBurris was with Hamilton when the Tiger-Cats went from 6-12 in 2012 to the Grey Cup in 2013 after a 10-8 regular season. He was also in Calgary when the Stampeders turned a 7-11 record in 2007 into 13-5 and a Grey Cup championship in 2008. Nichols was in Edmonton when the Eskimos went from 4-14 in 2013 to 12-6 under new head coach Chris Jones last year.\n“If you have the right people in the right place it can happen a lot quicker,” Burris said. “The difference here, just like in Hamilton, we had a young team that first year together.”\nIt can be done, but the current Bomber regime has been unable to duplicate that success and its shortcomings will be further magnified if the Bombers lose on Friday night. Winnipeg head coach Mike O'Shea hasn't done a complete analysis of why Ottawa has turned it around so quickly, but he said they're a different team this year because of Burris.\n“I know they have a new offensive co-ordinator (in Jason Maas), but if you look at Henry himself he's playing some of the best football he's played,” O'Shea said. “Therefore their offence produces more points, they stay on the field longer, their defence is more rested, and their special teams are more rested.\n“The simple answer is it runs through Henry. I'm sure there's a deeper explanation in all that, too. Coach (Rick) Campbell's a good coach, right? So I'm sure they had a plan and a length of time it would take.”\nThere's no word on how long the Bomber turnaround is supposed to take, but a fourth straight campaign out of the playoffs will have more fans looking to spend their entertainment dollars elsewhere – even if season ticket prices are remaining level.\nThey can move closer to that elusive post-season berth on Friday night by producing their first winning streak in nearly 15 months.\n“It's a playoff game,” O'Shea said. “We're treating them all like that going forward. It's the sense of urgency you have to have. We're still not out of the woods yet, obviously. We want to win the rest of our games going into the playoffs and give ourselves the best shot of getting to where we want to be.”\nkirk.penton@sunmedia.ca\ntwitter.com/PentonKirk\nBLUE BOMBERS\nFriday's clash between the Bombers and RedBlacks is massive for both organizations\nBy Kirk Penton , Winnipeg Sun First posted: Thursday, October 15, 2015 08:20 PM EDT | Updated: Thursday, October 15, 2015 08:23 PM EDT\nOTTAWA – One game does not tell the entire story of two organizations.\nThe Bombers and RedBlacks, however, are meeting at the most interesting of times.\nThe Blue and Gold are in a dog fight with the Montreal Alouettes and B.C.
