BONAVENTURE — Though St. Bonaventure’s men’s soccer team received a second-half goal from senior Jimmy Barrios, visiting Davidson pulled out a 2-1 victory in double overtime on Wednesday at the Marra Athletics Fields Complex. \nDavidson broke a 1-1 deadlock in the 106th minute when a Bonnies foul set up a free kick for the Wildcats. Nathan Marder was able to push the ball to Cort Coxhead who fired his shot through a scrum of players in front of the net for the game-winner. \nThe Bonnies fell to 1-12-1 (0-3-0 Atlantic 10) while Davidson improved to 4-6-3, 1-3-0. \nWildcats goalie Matt Pacifici made four saves while Shane MacNamara scored his third goal of the season for Davidson. \nBonnies goalkeeper Bobby Diaz made five saves in his 86-plus minutes of work, but left with just over three minutes remaining in regulation with an injury. Freshman Luke Iacobellis took over in net and made the save on Davidson’s only shot on goal during the first overtime. \nWOMEN’S VOLLEYBALL \nPitt-Bradford 3, D’Youville 0 \nBRADFORD, Pa. — UPB (9-13, 3-2) picked up its fourth straight victory, sweeping D’Youville College (3-17, 0-4), 25-15, 25-15, 25-23 on Wednesday night at KOA Arena in an Allegheny Mountain Collegiate Conference victory. \n“We were focused from start to finish and that’s extremely important in order to pick up a key conference victory,” Pitt-Bradford coach Tom Roof said. “I was happy with how our team responded in such a crucial game.” \nKirsten Platz led the Panthers with eight kills and three blocks. Alma Turpin added six kills while Christina Rauh finished with six kills, 24 assists and eight digs. Mandy Finch had a team-high 17 digs and Alexis Dhayer chipped in with nine digs. \n“We put it all together tonight,” Roof said. “It all starts with a good pass, and we had plenty of those tonight.
