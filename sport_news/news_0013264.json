While Raikkonen managed to limp home in fifth, the race stewards deemed him at fault for the collision and he was subsequently hit with a 30-second timed penalty. \n\"I don't really get the point of doing moves like that on the last lap,\" said Bottas, who has finished on the podium only once this season. \n\"It's very disappointing to lose P3 in the last lap and end up with zero points. I had fought back to a podium position and then somebody just crashed into me. What can I say? It's just disappointing. \n\"I'm a little bit surprised by Kimi's move. There's a fine line between aggressiveness and just going for it, and what happened on Sunday was just too much.\" \nRaikkonen, whose Ferrari team lost out on the constructors' championship to Mercedes after his penalty resulted in him being demoted to eighth, claimed after the race that the collision was nothing more than a racing incident. \nBut Bottas, writing in his Williams blog, dismissed his countryman's version of events. \n\"I don't think it was a standard racing incident,\" he added. \"I didn't see anyone there next to me and I was in front, quite clearly ahead, and taking my line. Then suddenly, already at the apex, I felt someone hit me. \n\"The fact Kimi got a penalty doesn't matter really to me. I'm never getting those points back. One thing I know for sure: I was not at fault, so I am happy about that at least, but it doesn't really help at the end of the day.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T09:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T20:23:09.586+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
