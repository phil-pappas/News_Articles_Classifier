But we have to win games.”\nNew 49ers coach Jim Tomsula and his staff have been trying to make Kaepernick a pocket passer, a plan that before Sunday night had drawn criticism for taking away one of Kaepernick’s best assets — his legs.\nBut with the Giants missing six key defensive players due to injury (middle linebacker Jon Beason was the latest victim, exiting early in the first quarter due to a concussion), Kaepernick had more than enough time to get comfortable with his dropbacks.\nThe result had to be encouraging: Kaepernick completed 23-of-35 passes for 262 yards and two touchdowns. Best of all, the Niners’ Turnover Machine played mistake-free football for four entire quarters.\nThat was in sharp contrast to San Francisco’s previous two games, which featured five Kaepernick interceptions and no TDs. Included in that wreckage was a pair of pick-six interceptions by Kaepernick thrown at the start of a 47-7 loss to the Cardinals in Week 3.\nAnd to think: The Giants came in hoping Kaepernick would stay in the pocket because they thought it would make him less of a threat.\nEven as a single threat, though, the Giants had trouble all night containing Kaepernick. He carried just three times for 23 yards but still gave the Big Blue defense fits.\nBeckham saved his best for last, too, directing the Niners on a pair of touchdown marches in the fourth quarter that tied the game and then gave San Francisco the lead.\nKaepernick’s first clutch play in the fourth came with 11:53 left, when he hit tight end Brent Celek with a 5-yard TD pass to tie the game 20-20.\nAfter the Giants took a 23-20 lead with a 24-yard Josh Brown field goal, Kaepernick promptly marched San Francisco downfield again to set up a two-yard scoring dive from Hyde to give the Niners a lead they thought would hold up.\nIt didn’t — Larry Donnell’s circus catch with 21 seconds left capped the Giants’ comeback — but at least for one week, Kaepernick’s legion of critics couldn’t pin this one on him.\n“I’m never going to accept losing,” Kaepernick said, “and never going to be happy with a loss.”\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google Whatsapp Email Filed under colin kaepernick ,  new york giants ,  san francisco 49ers", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T05:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T09:19:53.666+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
