I was surprised.”\nAnd not surprisingly, the move didn’t work, as Cespedes singled in Curtis Granderson from third and the Mets were on their way to a 4-1 win over the Cubs in Game 2 of the NLCS.\nThe decision by Chicago manager Joe Maddon wasn’t all that crazy, either, considering the run Murphy has been on this October.\nThe second baseman got Citi Field shaking early on Sunday, ripping yet another homer, this one a two-run shot off Arrieta in the bottom of the first to put the Mets up, 3-0 after David Wright’s RBI double made it 1-0.\n“All of a sudden you look up after eight to 10 pitches and two batters, we’ve got a 1-0 lead and David [Wright’s] in scoring position,” Murphy said. “I’m really looking to hook something to the second baseman or first baseman.”\nInstead, he hooked it into the right-field seats.\nIt was Murphy’s fifth homer this postseason and they have come against the likes of Clayton Kershaw and Zack Greinke of the Dodgers and Jon Lester and Jake Arrieta of the Cubs.\nAll this from a guy that hit just 14 homers in the regular season, a career-high.\n“As a teammate and as a hitter, very rarely do you see somebody get this hot against average pitching,” Wright said. “Then you throw in that it’s [Clayton] Kershaw, [Zack] Greinke twice each, [Jon] Lester, [Jake] Arrieta. I mean, that’s impressive. I said it after the Dodgers series, he’s about as locked in as I’ve seen a hitter and he’s carried that out now for, what’s it been, seven games? That’s quite a feat, especially in the playoffs against this pitching.”\nMurphy put it simply.\n“I definitely am seeing the ball well right now,” Murphy said. “So, that’s nice.”\nFor the free-agent-to-be, it’s the end of a considerable journey that manager Terry Collins has seen a lot of.\nAs the team’s field coordinator before he became the manager, Collins watched Murphy when he was rehabbing one of his knee injuries.\n“I didn’t know him,” Collins said of Murphy, who was still a young player basically without a position. “On our travels I’d go to St. Lucie to see our teams down there, and Dan Murphy’s at the Rookie League game in the morning and the St. Lucie game at night. And all he talks about is baseball, so I’m not shocked that Dan Murphy is aware of every single pitch that happens during the game.”\nAll that watching may have paid off during these playoffs, as he’s dominated some of the best pitchers in the game.\n“Dan Murphy likes baseball,” Collins said. “He loves to play baseball. There are people in our game who do this because this is what they can do best. … Dan Murphy is a baseball player. He loves baseball. He talks baseball 24/7, and that’s what I liked about him.”\nAnd these days, Collins and his team have a 2-0 NLCS lead heading to Chicago and Murphy is a key reason why.\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google Whatsapp Email Filed under chicago cubs ,  daniel murphy ,  mlb playoffs ,  new york mets ,  nlcs ,  terry collins", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T07:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T13:15:29.032+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
