Sabdo was efficient in the passing game and didn’t turn the ball over, making his first varsity start for the injured Corey Cooper at quarterback. Trey Owens, Cam Hutchinson and Solomon Beligotti had two rushing touchdowns each for Havelock (9-0, 4-0). Richlands (1-8, 0-4) stayed in the game until about midway through the first quarter. Roman Eddleman had a 35-yard field goal and Ben Jackson’s 27-yard touchdown pass to Ryan Cayson drew the Wildcats within 21-10 with 4:17 left in the quarter. However, Owens scored on a 28-yard touchdown run 1:15 later, and Beligotti’s 26-yard score and Hutchinson’s 4-yarder in the fourth quarter put the game away for the Rams. Owens scored on a 10-yarder to open the contest for Havelock, and after Khalil Barrett intercepted Jackson, Hutchinson found the end zone from 2 yards out as the Rams led 14-0 in the first quarter. Tiaseer Cruz recovered a Havelock muffed punt return to set up Eddleman’s field goal early in the second, but Beligotti scored with 36 seconds left in the half, giving the Rams a 21-3 halftime lead. “I think they played a whole lot better tonight than they have the last couple of weeks,” Richlands coach Justin Snider said. “I think they feel like they’ve got nothing to lose when they line up against a team as good as Havelock is. “I felt like the kids played well and played hard. There just comes a point that our lack of numbers and their ability to two-platoon kind of gets the best of you.” Richlands 0 3 7 0 -10 Havelock 14 7 7 12 -40 First Quarter H – Owens 10 run (Mills kick), 9:37 H – Hutchinson 2 run (Mills kick), 3:34 Second Quarter R – FG Eddleman 35, 11:55.
