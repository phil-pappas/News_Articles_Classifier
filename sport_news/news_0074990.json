From France?” he asked.”People are getting more money and an easier way to come. We will find competition and if strategically we will say we don’t deal with aliyah” it will be difficult to operate.\nDuring a 2009 overhaul, in which chairman Natan Sharansky unveiled a new strategic plan, the Agency closed down its Aliya Department, consolidating its functions together with other shuttered bureaus.\nSpeaking in a similar vein, board member Karma Feinstein said that Director of Aliyah and Absorption Yehuda Scharf and his department must be empowered and provided with more resources, despite the agency’s budget falling year on year.\n“This can’t be regardless of a strategic decision,” she said.\nIt was “not a good strategic decision to get out of the aliyah business,” another delegate added, although he added that he believed that the agency was going back into it.\nDuring the meeting, Eckstein’s name was bandied about, with delegates arguing over whether he was a partner or an “enemy.”\n“We have an increasing level of cooperation with the Immigrant Absorption Ministry,” which includes funding, said committee chairman Dr. Danny Lamm of the Australian Zionist Federation.\n“We are doing more and more and you mustn’t throw out the baby with the bathwater. We continue to do the work and the number of olim goes up.”\nAccording to Lamm, in country’s such as Ukraine, the Jewish Agency does much of the work and the IFCJ comes in at the last minute to offer financial inducements to immigrants to come through their framework.\n“We never left aliyah,” Lamm told the delegates, calling it “a ridiculous assertion.”\nSpeaking to the Jerusalem Post , Lamm said that the Jewish Agency has “always led the way with aliyah” and that it would continue to do so.\n“Now Eckstein has set up a fund for aliyah and from my perspective the ultimate importance is that we have more immigrants and as long as we can work together to advance aliyah that is all that matters.”\nWhile the budget for aliyah has fluctuated over the last several years there has been “no reduction” in the growth of aliyah programs and in fact there has been an expansion, he continued, stating that fundraising from outside bodies has “enabled an expansion of programs” catering to the younger and more educated immigrants coming in the twenty first century.\n“Far from aliyah being dead it has grown and it is reflected in the numbers,” he said, projecting more than 32000 immigrants for 2015.\nDuring the meeting, Scharf stated that pending a government decision on those remaining in Ethiopia, it would be possible to reopen aliyah from that country almost immediately. Two years ago the government celebrated what it termed the “end” of Ethiopian aliyah. However, there remain relatives of olim who have not been permitted to come and there is increasing pressure on the government by activists to allow them entry.\nOne of the key issues for the current board meeting was Jews from the former Soviet Union, who, combined, comprise “almost half of worldwide aliyah” at 47 percent of all immigrants, according to Roman Polonsky, the director of the agency's unit for Russian speaking Jews.\nHe noted that more Jews came from Russian than Ukraine despite the ongoing military conflict and economic collapse there.\nDescribing graphs marking immigration from Ukraine as reminiscent of the “temperature of a very sick man,” Polonsky pointed out that the numbers spike and drop according to the state of the conflict.\n“It drops when there is hope for a ceasefire and there are sharp increases when this collapses,” he said.\nOver twelve hundred Jews from the conflict zone in eastern Ukraine have passed through the Jewish Agency’s Mayak refugee center outside of Dnepropetrovsk.\nThe profile of new immigrants from the former Soviet Union is increasingly that of young and educated professionals who are Jewishly involved, he continued. Half are under age thirty five.\nAccording to the agency, while funding for the Russian Speaking Jewish unit is down, the Ukraine crisis has brought in more funding from outside sources and increased government cooperation.\nAddressing members of the committee tasked with dealing with the issue, Sharansky stated that in country’s such as Germany that are many Russian speakers who are not halachically Jewish but are showing interest in reconnecting but that there is a finite time frame in which to reach out to them.\n“They are still open to being part of the Jewish people but who knows how long,” he said.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T01:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T18:51:51.420+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
