Mayfield is putting together some impressive numbers after sitting out last season following his transfer from Texas Tech. He's thrown for 1,382 yards and 13 touchdowns threw four games and has added four scores with his feet as well. Mayfield is careful with the ball, too, only throwing three interceptions in 135 passing attempts this season.\nSamaje Perine, sophomore running back. Perine is not finding his way to the end zone the way he did as a freshman when he rushed for 21 touchdowns but the back is still grinding out yards for the Sooners. He is averaging 4.6 yards per carry in a reduced role beside Mayfield but against Texas' porous run defense Perine could be poised for a big game.\nSterling Shepard, senior wide receiver. Shepard does a lot of damage out of the slot for the Sooners. He leads the team in receptions (20) and receiving yards (321) and is tied for the team lead in receiving touchdowns (three). He is also the Sooners' primary punt returner.\nEric Striker, senior linebacker. Striker is a dangerous player on the Sooners' defense. He is a strong pass rusher from the outside linebacker position, leading the team with 2.5 sacks and an additional two quarterback hurries. He does a good job at outside contain, funneling the runners into the inside backers on OU.\nZack Sanchez, junior cornerback. Sanchez is the Sooners' ball hawk on defense. Last season he picked off six passes and added an interception earlier this season in addition to four passes defended. Sanchez is also capable of blitzing off the edge and making plays in the backfield.\nDede Westbrook, junior wide receiver. A newcomer to Oklahoma after spending two seasons at Blinn Community College, Westbrook is making his mark in Norman already. He earned a starting job right out the gate and already has 17 receptions for 282 yards and a touchdown.\nDominique Alexander, junior linebacker. Alexander is leading Oklahoma with 40 tackles in four games so far this season. He is doing a good job of getting into the backfield and causing havoc in the run and pass game. Just don't expect to see him making a lot of plays on thrown balls.\nDurron Neal, senior wide receiver. Neal is another piece that makes a lot of plays for OU in the pass game but what separates him from Shepard and Westbrook is the same thing that separates Neal from everyone else: His blinding speed. Neal is OU's primary downfield threat and could cause serious issues for the Texas secondary.\nCharles Tapper, senior defensive end. Tapper is a major disruptor off the end for Oklahoma. He has 16 tackles on the season to go with two for loss, a forced a fumble and a pass blocked at the line of scrimmage. His big performance against West Virginia put the senior over 100 tackles for his collegiate career.\nSteven Parker, sophomore safety. Parker is one of the younger players on the Sooner defense and he does a little bit of everything for head coach Bob Stoops. So far, Parker's 2015 stat sheet reads like this: 17 tackles, two tackles for loss, 1.5 sacks, two pass breakups and a quarterback hurry.\nOn Twitter:\n @SportsDayDFW", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/SportsDayDFW"], "published": "2015-10-06T07:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T13:34:37.071+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
