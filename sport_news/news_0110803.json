Each and every one of us.\nrelated advertisement Needing to assist\nDuncan Keith's teammates know they'll have to work harder until he returns from knee surgery. Keith does it all on both sides of the ice and is particularly good at igniting the offense. Here are his assist numbers and league rank among defensemen over the last six seasons:\nSeason Assists Rank\n2014-15 35 T-17\n2013-14 55 1\n2012-13* 24 T-5\n2011-12 36 T-11\n2010-11 38 T-13\n2009-10 55 2\n* Lockout-shortened season (48 games)\nSource: NHL.com They know this because no single player can replace what Keith does on the ice, which is basically everything. We're talking all-world defender, power-play leader and offensive jump-starter from the back end all rolled into one.\n\"We're up for the task,\" said Trevor Daley. \"When you lose a 25-plus minute guy, that's a big part of your team, especially what Duncs brings. I don't think there's a guy in the league that can replace that guy.\"\nKeith's presence will certainly be missed when opponents are pressuring goalies Corey Crawford or Scott Darling. But it's his vision to spot an open teammate 60, 70, even 100 feet down the ice that is also second to none.\nIn the last five full seasons, Keith has averaged 43.8 assists and has always finished in the top 17 among defensemen in that catergory. Two years ago, no defenseman had more assists that Keith's 55.\n\"Maybe that's something people don't talk about enough -- is our defensive core that enables everyone else to play their game,\" Jonathan Toews said Tuesday. \"I think every team in the league has skilled forwards who can â€¦ put points on the board. But our D-men make everything work in the back end and in the offensive zone as well.\"\nDavid Rundblad is going to get his chance, and Trevor van Riemsdyk and Viktor Svedberg can expect their minutes to increase.\nBut the key to the next month might just be Trevor Daley and Brent Seabrook.\nWhen Daley was acquired for Patrick Sharp in the off-season, many people pointed to his 16-goal campaign last year and thought he could bring that offensive pop to Chicago. The question is whether or not that season was an anomaly as Daley averaged 6.8 goals a season in the five full years prior to 2014-15.\nHe also has only eclipsed the 20-assist mark twice in nine years.\nDaley said Wednesday that he doesn't feel any more pressure to produce and that even with Keith in the lineup, he was looking to ignite the Hawks' offense.\n\"I'm still working towards that and trying to create that,\" Daley said.\nSeabrook, meanwhile, has averaged 8.3 goals the last four full seasons and was on pace for 13 in 2012-13 when the NHL played just 48 games. He also has 13 goals in his last 62 playoff games.\nThe 6-foot-3, 220-pound veteran has a nasty shot and might be unleashing it more over the next month.\n\"Losing Dunc, it's going to be a huge but guys have to step up,\" said Seabrook, who has also averaged a solid 29.4 assists the last five full seasons. \"He's obviously a great player.\n\"What he's able to do with the puck, the amount of minutes he's able to eat and still be productive, and be one of the top defensemen in the league, playing that many minutes -- it's pretty special.\n\"It's tough to replace but we have to continue to be ready and fill in.\"\n Sports", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share"], "published": "2015-10-23T03:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T06:38:34.589+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
