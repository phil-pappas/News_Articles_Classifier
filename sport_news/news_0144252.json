(Josh Folck | For lehighvalleylive.com) By Josh Folck | For lehighvalleylive.com on October 19, 2015 7:22 PM, updated October 19, 2015 7:33 PM \nLast year, things didn't go too well for Liberty tennis players Samantha Peterson and Madelyn Conrad in the District 11 Class AAA doubles finals as they lost to the powerful Poje sisters of East Stroudsburg South 6-0, 6-1. \nBut everything that came out of that losing experience wasn't bad for the Hurricanes duo. \nIn fact, a year later, it helped the senior pair turn in their own dominating performance to capture the gold. \nUsing last season's experience as a springboard, the Hurricanes posted their own 6-0, 6-1 victory over Freedom 's Natalie Sinai and Kaitlyn Swint on Monday at Lehigh University's Lewis Tennis Center. \n\"Losing last year really motivated us to practice together, work on strategy, work on our strokes and I think it really paid off,\" Conrad said. \nThey also had a big experience edge over freshman Sinai and junior Swint, who never was past the first round of districts before. \n\"Just nerves in general. We've been here before. We know what it's like so we're not as nervous as maybe they were coming into this,\" Peterson said. \nThe Liberty duo, the top seed, looked ready from the start, winning the first nine games with relative ease. The only game the Patriots pair could capture was the fourth one of the second set. \n\"I think they played beautifully,\" Liberty coach Leo Schnalzer said. \"They had a lot of confidence. They were having fun. They executed their ground strokes, their volleys. Samantha did a beautiful job on her ground strokes and serves. Madelyn, heck of a backhand volley a lot of times.\" \nIt was all Hurricanes in this renewal of the Bethlehem rivalry. \n\"It's great to play our rivals, especially beat them. It was fun playing them,\" Peterson said. \nThe Liberty pair will move into the state tournament on Nov. 6 in Hershey. \n\"I think we'll use the same strategy we've been using,\" Conrad said. \"Good net play. Good strokes. Good communication. We'll practice a lot.\" \n\"Just be aggressive and confident,\" Peterson said. \"Going into every match thinking we can win. I might be a little nervous but try not to let the nerves get to you. Just play well.\" \nThe title was the first district girls tennis doubles championship for Liberty since Rachel Hoffman and Katherine Noack captured gold in 2009. \nIt also give the two seniors another accomplishment in their impressive careers at Liberty. Along with the doubles finals appearance last year, Peterson was a runner-up in the singles tournament in 2014. Conrad won the Eastern Pennsylvania Conference tournament at No. 2 singles over the weekend. \n\"They're great kids. They deserve everything they've got,\" Schnalzer said. \"They work really hard, not only with the high school team but they also work really hard with their individual private coaches. And you don't develop that style and that play overnight. That takes a lot of time and a lot of practice.\" \nLiberty will play in the district team tournament quarterfinals on Tuesday, traveling to Parkland for a 3 p.m. match. \nIt will be another chance for best friends Peterson and Conrad to play with their teammates as their senior seasons are coming to a close. \n\"We have a great team,\" Peterson said. \"We've all gotten so close over the years. Our coach is awesome. He's been great all four years. It's kind of sad that it's over but I'm happy we get to continue at states and keep our season going a little longer.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T02:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T02:55:49.457+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
