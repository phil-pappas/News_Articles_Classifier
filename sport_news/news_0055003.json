Join me for the pros and the cons of Kentucky’s third loss of the season… \nPros \nLet’s try to find some positives. It won’t be easy. \n— Austin MacGinnis is money. Kentucky’s kicker went 3-for-4 on the night and his one miss was from 48 yards. If not for a UK timeout to avoid a delay of game penalty, MacGinnis would’ve been a perfect 4-for-4 on the evening, with that 48-yarder splitting the uprights before it was negated. He drilled his first attempt at the 48-yard bomb after Mark Stoops called a timeout; a timeout that led to a chewing of the officials’ asses on the sideline. Hashtag Angry Stoops. \n— The young guys got some playing time. We saw the debut of Drew Barker , some carries by Sihiem King and an all-freshmen secondary late in the game. It was big to get those guys on the field for some experience against a good team like Mississippi State, and their snaps, though limited, will go a long way toward their development. \nI’m a huge fan of King. Really liked what he showed us with his three carries for 31 yards. \n— Chris Westry picked off Dak Prescott. A lot of the talk leading up to the game was about Prescott’s almost 300 pass attempts without an interception. That streak came to a close last night when Kentucky’s Westry got up and took one away from the Bulldogs for his second career interception, both coming on the road in big games. We’ve only seen Westry for half of a season, but he’s already being talked about as a player who can be great, not just good, in Kentucky blue. Potentially one of the best to ever play corner at UK with what he’s shown us in his young career. \n— Boom Williams is really good. \n— We almost had a football game going into the half. Then, Mississippi State scored two touchdowns in a minute and it was over. But there was some hope at one time, early in the game. \n— C.J. Conrad got involved. Fans begging to see more of the freshman tight end were given just that last night. Conrad caught six passes for 56 yards, UK’s second best numbers in both categories. Hope to see more of him in the future. He can really bust up defenses. \n— The team’s attitude seems positive moving forward. Mark Stoops said, “I’ve felt a heck of a lot worse than I do right now,” following the 26-point loss. “There’s not one bit of panic. That’s a good football team that beat us. We’ll go back to work, believe me.” \n— And the biggest pro of them all: We don’t have to go back to Starkville for another two years. I hope everyone who went last night survived. And learned their lesson. Cons \nOh, the cons. So many of them to list. Add the ones I don’t hit in the comments section. \n— Matt Elam did not fill Melvin Lewis’ shoes. No one expected Elam to be Lewis in his first career start, but the hope was he would play well. He did not play well, unfortunately. He did not do much of anything. Elam still has a long way to go before he’s ready to play in this league. Zero technique right now. \n— Dak Prescott had all day in the pocket. Kentucky did not put any pressure on State’s quarterback. He was able to sit back and pick the defense apart all night long. The knock on Prescott is he can’t throw, but even I could’ve thrown for 300 yards with that much time to pick out a target. \n— Starkville. \n— The end of the first half sucked the life out of Big Blue Nation. Touched on this up top, but it can’t be said enough: the game ended in the final minutes of the first half. A 10-7 Kentucky lead turned into a 28-10 deficit, with 14 of those points coming in the span of one minute. Ball game. \n— If there was any hope left in the second half, Ramsey Meyers’ personal foul demolished it. Kentucky had a first-and-goal from the three-yard line, down only two scores late in the third quarter. A touchdown would’ve made it a one possession game and the end zone was only one big push from the offensive line away. Then one of those offensive linemen, Ramsey Meyers, was flagged for a stupid, idiotic, inexcusable, what-the-hell-are-you-doing personal foul for swinging at a defenseless defender after the play. The penalty pushed the offense back to the 19-yard line and forced UK to settle for a field goal, rather than getting back in the game. \n— Dorian Baker dropped another pass. At least it wasn’t in the end zone this time. And he wasn’t the only one dropping balls. I believe four of Towles’ first five incompletions were dropped passes . \n— Have I mentioned how terrible Starkville is? \n— Kentucky had no shot with three turnovers . We knew the Cats would need to win the turnover battle to have any chance at victory. Mississippi State won that battle, 3-1, and Kentucky isn’t a good enough team to win on the road with three turnovers. \n— Jason Hatcher did not play. As is the case with Melvin Lewis, missing Jason Hatcher was detrimental to the defense and a big part of the problem with the nonexistent pass rush. \n— The line of scrimmage was lost on both sides of the ball. It wasn’t just the D-line getting manhandled by the Bulldogs, Kentucky’s offensive line was pushed around all night, too. Towles faced constant pressure as State’s back line of defense dropped back and waited. \n— Ramsey Meyers’ penalty was really, really bad. I can’t imagine what Mark Stoops had to say to him after the game. I bet he used several swear words. \n\nTennessee this week. Let’s put this behind us and get up for the Vols. Huge week ahead for the program and for the city of Lexington. \nGo Cats. Article written by Drew Franklin I can recite every line from Forrest Gump, blindfolded.

Ha ha. The Rest of the story October 25, 2015 at 7:19   \nLooking at the Cons one must look no further than the sidelines and those who coach there. UK football is being run by coaches trying to figure out how to coach. Well to much inexperience there to give the talent on this team a chance win against teams with no more talent than they have. This is painful to think that a staff that can recruit the best players ever at UK cannot coach them to win and prepare them ahead of the game. As for next week UT will totally destroy the Cats and will not be a game worth watching by halftime. I predicted this game and cannot see any difference next week either as yet again UK nose dives the second half of the year in what will be their easiest SEC schedule they will likely ever have. Willie Wilson Paducah October 25, 2015 at 7:58 pm | Permalink \nDo you agree that Matt Elam was as bad as the clown from Madisonville said? I saw him fighting off many double teams — a sign of respect from opposing squads, and a situation where him occupying two linemen SHOULD open up the opportunities for the other d linemen and linebackers. Lil jimmy October 25, 2015 at 7:27   \nDon’t see any pros at all. Tommycatsfan October 25, 2015 at 7:41 pm | Permalink \nPros: we are one game closer to the end of this season. \nCons: we are only 5 days away from the beatdown from UT. But we are better so maybe they won’t beat us by 55 like they did last year. With all of our improvements and great strides, I think we can keep it to about 45 this year. If we keep improving at this rate, we should be able to tie them in about 10 years. Eshelby October 25, 2015 at 7:32   \nI posted this on an earlier thread, but i think it needs to be said again. \nWorst game of the year no doubt; a lot of people need to remember that prior to Stoops’ arrival, this type of ass kcking was the norm, now it’s an outlier. People also need to realize that we will likely lose the next two as both Tennessee and Georgia have exponentially more depth, talent, and experience than we do; that’ll change in the next couple years. After 9 games we will likely be 4-5 and our fans CANNOT quit on this team; the last 3 games are all “winnable” and we can finish 6-6 and even 7-5. Fill the stadium EVERY game let’s stay behind this young team. Going to a bowl is 15 extra practices and a HUGE need for this team’s continued development. GO BIG BLUE!!! \nPS: all you morons complaining about Stoops are the same idiots who wanred Rich brooks fired after he went 3-8 in his 3rd year. And brooks took over a better team than stoops did. Willie Wilson Paducah October 25, 2015 at 8:02 pm | Permalink \nYeah, and then Brooks went on to win all those SEC championships and those two national championships and those four New Year’s Day bowl games — oh, wait, no, that was not him. If you were satisfied by what Brooks did, that says more about you than about the guys you are throwing names like moron at. Rich was the B Team and there is no reason we can’t get a coach in here who can do it. Another Barnhart bomb. Shelby October 25, 2015 at 8:30 pm | Permalink \nSo, you’ll only be happy with SEC and national championships? Wow, takes a helluva lot to make you happy. I’ll be pretty damned pleased if we can just make a bowl game every year–let’s get to that level before we demand an SEC or national title huh bro? We’ve gotten better EVERY year stoops has been year; if you can’t see that, you’re blind. Jesus Effin' Facepalming Christ October 25, 2015 at 9:42 pm | Permalink \nWow… Pump the brakes there, Willie Wilson Paducah…. Good grief, you act like we’re Florida or Tennessee or LSU. Let’s just be happy we aren’t LAST. LIKE WE’VE BEEN FOR BASICALLY THE LAST 5 YEARS!!! BluKudzu October 25, 2015 at 7:35   \nPros: nice looking uniforms Cons: the entire football program leon singleton October 25, 2015 at 7:36   \nElam looked no worse then the others and Barker needs to start. Willie Wilson Paducah October 25, 2015 at 8:04 pm | Permalink \nBarker’s QB rating versus State: 94 Towle’s QB rating versus State: 88 The numbers say you are correct — as do Pat’s three SEC losses and repeated collapses. CATandMONKEY October 25, 2015 at 8:29 pm | Permalink \nBarker is a good QB. He earned his rating in garbage time against 2nd string players. Leon continues to be captain of the douche canoe. The Pros? October 25, 2015 at 7:36   \n1. Only 10 days before the first basketball game. 2. Potentially Chris Westry and the place kicker. 3. The football team allows you to practice booing for when Pitino (if still there) brings Louisville to Rupp Arena. \nNo other Pros can be seen. The Rest of the story October 25, 2015 at 7:39   \nIt is a shame that UK is only the third best team in the state, simply because of being out coached by lesser teams. Amazing how Jeff Brohm has that WKU playing at such a high level with third rate talent. No excuse for this and fans need to start examining where the real problem is. I love Mark Stoops but his team is being underprepared and poorly coached on every level. Where will that 6th win come from as I cannot see this team at this time beating anyone left other than that one non conference cupcake game. Even Vandy with a much better than the Cats can field will beat this team. UK Football being very good or great October 25, 2015 at 7:42   \nThis will always be the exception versus the norm. We’ll all root for them to be better than they are, but this type of program will continue through generations. Going to games, teaching your children and grandchildren to be UK fans in general will always be the norm. However, expecting the football program to be SEC title contenders perennially is a whimsical dream. REALLY!!!! October 25, 2015 at 7:43   \nNo wonder we are pathetic. Here is this article, only about UK football, and our fans still want to talk about little brother UofL. No wonder we are always the laughing stock of the SEC UK Big Board Update October 25, 2015 at 9:00 pm | Permalink \nGet lost, cats paw. I’ll take 4-3 in the SEC over 3-4 in the ACC any day. You may want to look in the mirror before calling anyone or anything ‘pathetic’. BigBlueTrue October 25, 2015 at 10:24 pm | Permalink \nCould not agree more! This is still a young team that is improving. I have been a UK football fan for over 40 years and Mark Stoops is the best coach we have had since a guy named Bryant coached here. bb October 25, 2015 at 7:43   \nI’ve learned my lesson. Took the missus to the game in Starkvegas as an anniversary gift. Hemmed in on every side by headache inducing cowbells, it felt so good (and silent) when we had the early lead. Sadly and miserably it didn’t stay that way. Watching no fight in our boys all night made for an early exit (my wife felt sorry for me). On the way I told her no more Miss. St. vs UK games for us. It usually ends with with her exhilarated and me miserable. Plus, nothing’s worse than a house divided. From now on for my own sanity and happiness and, for her, room to gloat and enjoy the wins, we are only going to UK or Miss. St. games where were can both trash the other team. Starkville is the worst, but the fans were awfully nice. Catlogic15 October 25, 2015 at 7:50   \nCon: Jesse Palmer’s quote after Miss St’s two late first half drives: “It looked like Miss St was playing against air”. How embarrassing. Larry October 25, 2015 at 8:10   \nDrew you are right on with your assement of the game. I agree with you 100% Mark Stoops and his offensive coach I hope explained to Towels why he was taken out and Barker came in. If not they may have destroted the kid. He looked really hurt on the side lines. And before some ass hole L fan tries to start some crap, Kentucky can only win this year on the back of Patty Ice. He needs some blocking up front and for some guys to catch the damned ball. One more item. I forgot who wears #1 on the defense, but he should go home and play about 3 years more high school ball. He was flat out terrible. I will guarantee his ass is sore after watching how many times he just watched the play. I know Timmons wears #1 on offense, but really he doesn’t show up much either. To be as good as he was heralded. He looks like he always has a case of the red ass about something. Hopefully we do better with them damned orange sucking volunteers.. jim October 25, 2015 at 8:46 pm | Permalink \nIf our only hopes are on the back of Towles, then we have no hope. 4 of 7 games no passing TD, more interceptions than touchdown. Good lord we are doomed. Nickname non-sense October 25, 2015 at 8:23   \nPatty Ice? Juice? And UK fans make fun of little brother fans because they call some of their players by nicknames………….. CATandMONKEY October 25, 2015 at 8:36 pm | Permalink \nWe make fun of little brother because, well , Louisville. I read every post on KSR and have seldom seen us solely making fun of them strictly for nicknames. There are so many reasons to make fun of UofL that nicknames is probably 27th on the list. \nUK beats UofL by at least 9 this year in Commonwealth. Sidney October 25, 2015 at 8:28   \nDrew, I’m glad you put Matt Elam as the top issue. Let’s be blunt: the coaching staff should be absolutely ashamed that they haven’t gotten that young man in better shape and taught him healthier nutritional habits–not only for this team, but just so he can live a healthy life. Few rational observers actually believe Elam is 360 lbs, as listed. He came here at 394, looks no smaller than he did when he arrived (I think he looks larger), and can’t play more than six snaps consecutively. Even if you DO believe his listed weight, that means his BMI is still comfortably in the morbidly obese range. Does that sound like an elite athlete to anyone? \nWe have FIVE football strength and conditioning coaches at UK totaling nearly $600,000 in salary. Given the number of personnel, and the year and a half they have had to work with him, is it not reasonable to think someone would have come up with a nutritional, exercise, and monitoring plan that would put him on the path to success? It’s shameful, and their failure to honestly address this problem now has the team in a position where every remaining opponent will target this young man. I wish him luck, but the coaching failures have put him at a real disadvantage. Jesus Effin' Facepalming Christ October 25, 2015 at 9:26 pm | Permalink \nNice bow tie. Methinks you should keep all opinions about football coaching to yourself going forward. inside info2 October 25, 2015 at 9:45 pm | Permalink \nElam came in to Lexington with BMOC disease. Hopefully Saturday night’s game will bring his massive ego down a notch or two. Although I don’t think he played quite as bad as Drew thinks. He was double-teamed on several plays. SinceStollField October 25, 2015 at 8:32   \nThe Cats better get the offense cranked up because the Vols are coming to town with the same quarterback and running back who put 50 points and over 500 yards of offense on them last year. UK’s defense sure hasn’t improved (75th in total defense last year and 76th this year) since last November, as we all saw against MSU. Joe October 25, 2015 at 9:40   \nBeing a UK football fan is like Charlie Brown kicking the football with Lucy holding. She always removes the ball after convincing Charlie she won’t.
