I'm so grateful for what the Cutinellas did. A year ago, I couldn't climb a flight of stairs. Now, I'm running again.\"\nHill's mother, Gail Tyus-Hill of Washington, D.C., said that without receiving Thomas' heart last year, her daughter \"might not have survived the weekend.\"\n0:57 Suffolk Vigil held for high school football player Kelli Cutinella, who had been in communication with all of her son's organ recipients, said she and Hill, who now lives in Manhattan, made plans to meet at the New York City Tunnel to Towers event, though they hadn't talked about running together.\nFind scores, schedules and stats Search Or\nSelect a sport in fall Nassau county schools\nBadminton Boys Cross Country Girls Cross Country Field Hockey Football Golf Girls Gymnastics Boys Soccer Girls Soccer Girls Swimming Girls Tennis Boys Volleyball Girls Volleyball Suffolk county schools\nBoys Cross Country Girls Cross Country Field Hockey Football Golf Girls Gymnastics Boys Soccer Girls Soccer Girls Swimming Girls Tennis Boys Volleyball Girls Volleyball Private schools\nBoys Cross Country Girls Cross Country Field Hockey Football Golf Girls Gymnastics Boys Soccer Girls Soccer Girls Swimming Girls Tennis Boys Volleyball Girls Volleyball \"It just happened, and we stayed right by each other,\" Kelli said. \"It was amazing to me. This was Thomas' favorite run and I knew he was with me.\"\nLife has changed irrevocably for the Cutinellas since Thomas' death, which his father said was caused by \"a helmet-to-helmet hit on a play he never saw coming.\"\n\"We don't blame anyone,\" Frank Cutinella said. \"We'll never blame the coaches; we'll never blame the player; we'll never blame the refs. But I do think we need to make changes to the sport. That's a reality.\"\nThere are many haunting reminders for Frank and Kelli. \"No holidays together. No birthdays. Seeing him pass his road test or go to his prom. It's those things,\" a tearful Kelli said. \"And then seeing his peers go through it. I'm excited and happy for them but it just reminds me that Tom's not here for those things.\"\nFootball LI mourns student lost in 'freak accident' Those things include the simple act of dining out, when Frank and Kelli, who have two other sons and a daughter, can no longer ask for a table for six. \"It's horrible. It's a reality. But that's just a small part of it. We did everything as a family of six,\" Frank said. \"That's just one of the many, many challenges we have to move forward with our lives.\"\nAn overriding element to the past year has been Kevin Cutinella returning to the sport that took his brother's life while he watched on the sidelines as a substitute on last year's Shoreham-Wading River team. A 15-year-old junior, he is a starting linebacker/running back this season.\n\"I probably would have preferred that Kevin didn't play,\" Frank Cutinella said. \"But he's a young man and I support his decision. He's played since he was 6. Tom started when he was 7. I would do anything to have my son back, so of course I would never have introduced Thomas to the sport. But, like myself when I was a young boy and a teenager, he fell in love with football. I can't take that away from him.\"\nFrank Cutinella misses the days when he spent hours on the couch in the den, watching college and pro football games on TV with Thomas. In fact, he has lost his passion for football.\n\"I don't watch college games anymore. I'll sit with the family if they are watching an NFL game, but football will never be the same for me,\" he said. \"Football has no meaning for me now, other than watching Kevin play. It's hard for me to watch.\"\n1:32 Football Superintendent: HS player's death 'freak accident' Subscribe to Newsdayâ€™s high school sports weekly newsletter for the latest stories, scores and photos about Long Island high school sports events.", "external_links": ["http://admin.brightcove.com/js/BrightcoveExperiences.js", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?sz=4x4&iu=/5819/cblvsn.nwsd.videogallery&ciu_szs=300x250&impl=s&gdfp_req=1&env=vp&output=xml_vast2&unviewed_position_start=1&url=/long-island/suffolk/vigil-held-for-high-school-football-player-1.9461318&correlator=1443811574317", "http://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/handlebars.js/1.0.0/handlebars.min.js", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?sz=4x4&iu=/5819/cblvsn.nwsd.videogallery&ciu_szs=300x250&impl=s&gdfp_req=1&env=vp&output=xml_vast2&unviewed_position_start=1&url=/sports/high-school/football/superintendent-hs-player-s-death-freak-accident-1.9458510&correlator=1443811574344"], "published": "2015-10-02T06:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T21:45:39.641+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
