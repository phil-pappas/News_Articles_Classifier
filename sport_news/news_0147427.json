Posted: Friday, October 2, 2015 11:24 pm Panthers ground and pound way to victory over Eagles By George Bremer | The Herald Bulletin Herald Bulletin Posted on Oct 2, 2015 \nELWOOD — High winds, cool temperatures and intermittent rain seemed to be a recipe for a low-scoring rivalry game Friday night. \nBut Elwood running backs Jake Wilson and Zane Boyer had other ideas. \nThe duo led the way as the Panthers rushed for 469 yards and scored 19 first-quarter points en route to a 49-34 victory over Frankton. The game snapped a three-game winning streak for the Eagles and put Elwood back over .500 in Central Indiana Conference play. \n“We ran a lot of unbalanced formations and overpowered them,” Panthers coach Marty Wells said. “Then they made some adjustments, and we started to run inside to where they made the adjustments.” \nWilson and Boyer were the perfect one-two punch to execute that strategy, and quarterback Greyson Savage directed the whole show like a maestro. Wilson rushed for 263 yards and three touchdowns on 33 carries — his second consecutive 200-yard performance against Frankton — and Boyer added 137 yards and three more scores on 18 attempts. \nBoyer also caught a 37-yard touchdown pass on Savage’s lone completion. \nFrankton (4-3, 3-2 CIC) answered with big outings by quarterback Travis McGuire and wide receiver Maurice Knight but couldn’t overcome a sluggish start. The Eagles went into the teeth of the wind for the entire first quarter and gained just 11 yards of total offense. \nThings got rolling for Frankton in the second period, but only after Savage and Boyer hooked up on the scoring pass that gave the Panthers a commanding 27-0 lead with 11:49 remaining in the first half. \nThe Eagles got on the board with a 42-yard touchdown pass from McGuire to Knight, as the wide receiver stiff-armed a defender to the ground around the 20-yard line, following a personal foul against Elwood (3-4, 3-2) that extended the drive. \nPenalties were a constant thorn in the side for the Panthers, who were flagged 14 times for 107 yards. \n“The kids aren’t stupid,” Wells said. “But some of the penalties were.” \nElwood handed Frankton three first downs by penalty and helped the visitors claw back into the game. \nThe Eagles cut the deficit to 27-16 with 3:57 to play in the half on a 1-yard run by Isaiah Delph and 2-point conversion pass from McGuire to Knight. Delph supplied the 2-point try after the first touchdown on a run up the middle. \nThe Panthers responded with a nine-play, 53-yard drive capped by a 6-yard touchdown run from Wilson to extend their advantage to 33-16 at the break. \nElwood then essentially put the game away with a five-play, 61-yard drive to start the second half. Boyer scored on a 2-yard run, and Kaine Stone added the 2-point conversion run for the only points of the third quarter. \nIt was sixth touchdown for the Panthers on their first seven drives. \nWilson started the scoring with a 10-yard touchdown run on the opening drive, and Boyer added scoring runs of 2 and 13 yards to put Elwood ahead 19-0 after the first quarter. \n“Both kids ran the ball well tonight,” Wells said. \nMeanwhile, McGuire and Knight got the job done for the Eagles through the air. McGuire completed 15 of 27 pass attempts for 235 yards and two touchdowns, and Knight caught 11 passes for 178 yards and both scores. \nThe final points came on a 67-yard catch-and-run for Knight with 1:30 remaining in the contest. McGuire also scored on a 1-yard scamper around the end and a 65-yard jaunt during the final period. \nElwood’s only points of the fourth quarter came on a 26-yard run by Wilson with 5:32 remaining. \nFrankton hosts conference leader Eastbrook (7-0, 5-0) next week. The Panthers face another rival with a trip to Alexandria (3-4, 2-3). \n“We’re going to see the same style of offense, maybe with some different looks,” Wells said. “But they want to get the ball up into the air, too. I thought our secondary did a better job today. But they always say the best pass defense is the pass rush. Our strength since Day 1 has been the front seven, and they dominated tonight.” Sign Up / Sign In With your existing account from... {* loginWidget *}", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T06:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T09:35:23.760+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
