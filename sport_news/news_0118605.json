We hope she can rejoin the team soon.”\n Mitchem had appeared in 18 matches this season with three starts, two at middle hitter and one at opposite, with 51 kills and 33 blocks A.gains the Anteaters she recorded a career-high seven kills, two service aces, and 13 digs along with three blocks for a career-high 10.5 points.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T01:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T01:37:50.149+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
