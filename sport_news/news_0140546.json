It wasn’t even a field, more of an open area.\n“The turf is hotter, but you don’t have to worry about spraining an ankle.”\nCole chuckles about it now, but it’s an indicator of how far the program has come.\nHe was among the initial players who signed up to play for coach Todd Loveday when Northview started a football program two-and-a-half years ago. Now he’s helping lead a group that is on the cusp of a Class 3A state playoff berth in its maiden varsity season.\nThe Cougars (4-2, 2-1 Region 1-3A) hope to take a step toward clinching a spot in the postseason when they play host to Chuckey-Doak (4-2, 2-1) on Friday at 7:30 p.m.\n“We’re spoiled a little bit now,” Loveday said. “In our first year, we played a freshman schedule and middle school schedule. We coached two teams. We practiced at the same time. If our freshmen were on offense, our middle school would practice on defense. That first year’s group of middle schoolers and freshmen are the core of our team right now.”\nLoveday, a Sevier County graduate who played at Carson-Newman before serving as Smoky Bears defensive backs coach for 14 years, didn’t establish any long-term goals when he took the job, his first as a head coach. He methodically hired a staff over a two-year period, filling it with ties from the county and his alma maters.\nThe staff held its first practices on the playground at Northview Elementary, and played games on youth-league fields before turf was installed last season.\nPigeon Forge donated its old weight room, which Northview used until it could fund a field house and weight facility, and Loveday’s staff sought to nix the program’s developmental curve by implementing heavier offseason weight training the past two years.\nWhile area teams were vying for playoff spots, the Cougars were counting the days to the beginning of the 2015 season.\n“We basically just wanted set a consistent work ethic day to day to day, and we didn’t want to sway much from it,” Loveday said. “We had a short-term plan: We wanted to win a freshman game, then we wanted to win a (junior varsity) game. The entire time I was thinking Year 3.\n“We don’t have any seniors, and we knew we were going to be a year behind in the weight room, especially up front. I geared up all my strength programs a little bit.”\nDividends have been paid this season.\nNorthview won its first varsity game on Aug. 21, beating Cloudland 47-36 in its season opener.\nAfter a loss to Pigeon Forge, it posted consecutive wins over Volunteer and Claiborne in early September, and capped the month with a gritty loss against reigning Class 1A state runner-up Coalfield on Sept. 25.\n“I remember two times this year specifically thinking on the sideline,” Loveday said. “We played at Sevier County against Seymour in the jamboree, and I saw our level of competitiveness really raise up for one quarter. We looked like we were a step faster. We were hitting just a hair harder. I remember at that time, I thought: ‘Alright, we can start letting some reins off these guys, have some fun and play some football.’ The other time was against Coalfield. That was a physical football game, and our guys didn’t fold.”\nQuality personnel has eased the transition for Northview, among four teams tied for second in the region.\nLoveday considers Cole, whose brother Zach played at Catholic, a college prospect, and sophomore quarterback Justin Howard has provided a spark on offense.\nThe versatile 5-11, 198-pound athlete is practically a veteran by now. He began perfecting the Cougars’ multiple offensive system as an eighth grader.\n“It felt like there was a ton of pressure, initially, but once you start hitting your stride, you realize what you can do,” Howard said.\n“Our first varsity win at Cloudland, we started off great and know we can keep going.”\nChris Thomas covers high school sports.
