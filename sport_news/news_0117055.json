Image 13 of 13 Shaker football steamrolls La Salle 1  /  13 Back to Gallery Troy \nThe Blue Bison trampled yet another Class AA opponent.\nShaker High controlled the line of scrimmage and had six different players score touchdowns in a 55-0 thrashing of La Salle on Friday.\nThe Blue Bison offense showed no signs of letting up in racking up a fifth victory without a loss on the season.\n\"We're satisfied with the result, but not content with some of the sloppy mistakes we made tonight,\" Shaker coach Greg Sheeler said. \"It's a good win, but we have a long road to reach the goals we set for ourselves at the start of the season.\"\nShaker (5-0, 3-0 Liberty Division) dominated on the Cadets' Homecoming Night and scored its first touchdown with only two minutes gone in the game.\nIn a sign of things to come in the game, Andrew Bolton raced 45 yards for that score and effectively set the tone.\n\"Our offensive line did a great job and when they do that, it makes all us in the backfield look good,\" Bolton said. \"We feed off the line's energy and it's easy to score points when we've got the blocks.\"\nBolton scored a second touchdown on a 17-yard run two possessions later, and Brendan MacPhee busted through the line for a 54-yard score as the Blue Bison raced out to a 21-0 first-quarter lead.\nQuarterback Wahid Nabi tossed two touchdown passes in the second quarter, one to Edwin Shields and another to Mike Stiso, as Shaker pushed the lead to 35-0 at the half.\n\"We're very fortunate to have some extremely talented players on the roster,\" Sheeler said. \"We've got some good depth this season and have a lot of confidence in their abilities to execute what we teach.\"\nMacPhee added a three-yard TD run in the third quarter, while Kwasi Addo and Cole Nestler also found the end zone for Shaker.\n\"Our number twos and threes, they can pick up and do whatever we need,\" Bolton said.\nBolton finished the game with 79 yards on six carries, MacPhee had 70 yards on three attempts and Ryan Duda gained 53 yards on five rushes.\nNabi completed seven of nine passes for 102 yards and two touchdowns.\nDefensively, Brandon Barlow had two sacks and Kyle Kessler had an interception for the Blue Bison.\nThe Cadets (2-3, 2-1) had to wait until midway through the second quarter for a first down.\nAmir Young led the offense with seven carries for 21 yards in the loss. La Salle had 47 yards rushing and 13 passing.\nEric Houghtaling is a freelance writer.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T02:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T06:49:18.009+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
