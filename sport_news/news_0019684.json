She was in the Philadelphia area, with more appearances later in the day, as part of a 20-city tour to promote her book, It's Your World: Get Informed, Get Inspired & Get Going.\nThe book, published by Penguin Random House, encourages young people to think about challenges and how they can overcome them.\nClinton also appeared Tuesday night in Haverford with Germantown Academy freshman Katherine Commale, whose efforts to raise money and awareness to fight malaria in Africa is featured in the book.\nAMY Northwest was chosen by the School District and the mayor's office to host Clinton.\n\"I tell [students] all the time that you can do anything you put your mind to,\" said Jodan Floyd, the principal at AMY Northwest. \"To hear it from someone who has made changes on so many things at a young age has impact.\"\nUsing a PowerPoint presentation, Clinton shared stories from her book about teenagers who changed the world for the better. That included, she said, Haile Thomas, an American teenage chef who made meals for her family and went on to become an advocate against childhood obesity.\nUsing her own life as an example, Clinton spoke of her years in the White House and on the campaign trail while her father was president. One experience, she said, helped her learn about bullying. Referring to a time when she was called \"the family dog,\" she said she learned through the support of her friends and family \"that bullying was all about the bully.\"\nSpeaking up for yourself and defending your beliefs was at the core of Clinton's talk.\n\"She does understand how hard it is for kids to get their word out and believe that we can do it, that we can bring change to this world,\" said James-DuJon Byfield, an eighth grader.\nNikira Thompson, also in the eighth grade, said it was sometimes hard for kids to get adults to \"believe that we can change the world.\"\nClinton said she was pleased when she began the tour last month in New York to learn that so many young people wanted to get involved. She also was in middle school, she said, when she felt that urge.\n\"When I started the tour, I was surprised at how the kids referenced things from the book and talked about what they wanted to do so they can change the world,\" she said.\nClinton visits Massachusetts on her next stop.\nAs for her changing the world, Clinton said she was not interested in becoming president. But she is eager to see how the 2016 race turns out.\n\"We would have to wait to see what the vice president will do,\" Clinton said of whether Joe Biden will challenge her mother in the Democratic primary.\n\"But I love my mom,\" she said. \"I certainly think she's the best person to lead our country.\"\nkwilliams@philly.com\n@KRWilliams610", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T10:39:46.716+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
