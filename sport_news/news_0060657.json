You know?\" \nDiggs coached at South Carolina, The Citadel, and Air Force before becoming the head coach at Morgan State in 1991. \nToday, most people just call him “Coach.” \nLiving with the disease, he’s received support from the local chapter of the National Multiple Sclerosis Society. Chapter officials find his attitude so remarkable; it rewarded Diggs with a special ride in a Porsche Carerra, leading up to the local chapter’s annual fundraising event, the MS Mille . \nDiggs was diagnosed with MS in 2000. \nIn 2009, he was elected to Shippensburg University’s Athletics Hall of Fame . Diggs was the first Shippensburg football player to rush for 1,000 yards in one season in 1974. \n\"Not once have I ever said to God, 'Why me?''\" he added. \nDiggs chooses to look on the bright side; knowing his condition could actually be worse. \n“Don’t look at what could happen. React to what does happen.” \nPictures used in this story are provided by Shippensburg University; Morgan State University.
