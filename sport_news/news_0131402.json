Some vendors rush and scurry; his approach was more methodical. When Cubs owner Tom Ricketts walked past and high-fived fans directly above Spiegel, the beer man merely ducked his head and continued to count out exact change.\n\"I love the Cubs. I love Wrigley Field. What's not to like?\" asked Spiegel, of Buffalo Grove, gesturing out to the familiar green expanse of the field and the flags snapping in the dimming blue sky.\nFor vendors like Spiegel who have worked at Wrigley for decades, the Cubs' playoff run brings both financial and personal rewards. During Monday night's victory, the exuberant crowd was electrified with each Cubs homer, setting off corresponding waves of beer sales. For as long as this run goes, some of the game's unsung heroes — Wrigley Field's vendors — are enjoying what is essentially bonus baseball after an already banner sales season.\n\"It's probably been one of the best (sales) years ever,\" said James Mack, a 56-year-old South Sider who's been a Wrigley vendor for 33 years.\nThis Cubs team feels different than others in the past, even those that made the playoffs, Mack and other vendors said. The young players seem unfazed by past losses and supposed curses, generating an unprecedented level of excitement from the fans.\nAnd that's good for business.\n\"Everything's flying tonight,\" Mack said. \"Tonight will be busy — start to finish.\"\nEven Cards, White Sox fans may appreciate Joe Maddon's Cubs leadership Phil Rosenthal You don't have to know or like baseball to appreciate the way Cubs manager Joe Maddon has led them this season. You don't have to like the Cubs. Dare it be said, you can even be a Cardinals or White Sox fan.\nEffective leadership, wherever one might hope to find it, sadly has become as elusive as...\nYou don't have to know or like baseball to appreciate the way Cubs manager Joe Maddon has led them this season. You don't have to like the Cubs. Dare it be said, you can even be a Cardinals or White Sox fan.\nEffective leadership, wherever one might hope to find it, sadly has become as elusive as...\n(Phil Rosenthal) Most of the vendors interviewed declined to talk money, though one beer seller who asked not to be identified said the take-home pay on a busy night can exceed $400. The vendors pay for the beers, by the case, and then earn a commission and tips throughout the game.\nFor some of them, the experience of working at the ballpark is worth more than the money, and many have other jobs. Spiegel, for example, works full time as an account manager for an electronics company. Mack said he recently took up screenwriting.\nAlan Murdoch, 67, of Arlington Heights, is a retired high school teacher on his \"13 t h campaign\" as peanut vendor. A season ticket holder since 1976, Murdoch said the peanut gig was like having an extra ticket. On Monday night, his wife and son were in the family's season-ticket seats, as he worked the lower rows along the right field line.\n\"I always wanted to play center field,\" Murdoch said. \"Now I'm selling peanuts.\"\nRoad trip to St. Louis: The cost of a day at Busch Stadium Corilyn Shropshire No Wrigley Field playoff tickets?

The light crowds in May signaled the low expectations of the fan base, he said, but that's all changed.\n\"The city's embraced it now,\" Murdoch said. \"It's a thread that binds a lot of people together coming out of some harsh economic times.\"\nShouldering a bag of Cracker Jacks and ropes of red licorice, Ed Puckett climbed the concourse ramp between innings. Puckett, 55, said he was expecting only a .500 team this year.\n\"This is amazing,\" said Puckett, who lives on the North Side. \"I hope they go all the way.\"\nBefore the bottom of the fifth inning, Sam Gomez emerged from the supply room on the main level with a full tray of Bud and Bud Light to sell to the masses. Gomez, 44, lives on the Southeast Side and has worked at Wrigley since 2003, previously selling Old Style before that beer was phased out.\nA die-hard Cubs fan, Gomez also takes much pride in his work, he said.\n\"We're part of the game for the fans,\" Gomez said. \"I treat it like that. No matter how long you've been here, you've got to try to keep that fresh mentality.\"\nGomez said he works as many as 70 games a season and estimates that he walks at least 3 to 4 miles per game, tightly maneuvering through crowds with a case of beer on his chest and nimbly stepping out of jams.\n\"A lot of people don't realize, you have to be a master of anticipating people's moves, while balancing and pouring beer,\" Gomez said as he ascended the stairs of the right field terrace.\nAs he poured beer for a customer, Gomez faced the field and glimpsed, as everyone else did, Cubs slugger Kris Bryant launch a two-run homer into the left field bleachers. The crowd burst into a deafening and joyous roar. Gomez beamed and allowed himself a brief \"Wooo!\"\nAlmost immediately after that moment, the cries for beer rained down on Gomez.\n\"Sam, when you get a chance,\" a grinning fan called out. \"When you get a chance, Sam.\"\nWhen Cubs first baseman Anthony Rizzo went deep right afterward, Gomez was soon retreating to the supply room for more beer. \"I love it,\" he said, wiping sweat from his brow.\nIt was tougher sledding for the water vendors.\nNearing the seventh-inning alcohol cutoff, a vendor with a booming voice called out: \"C'mon, guys, it's still just Monday. Spare yourself the headache.\"\nWaving bottles of water in the air, he got laughs but no takers.\nAfter a minute or two, he moved on.\ngtrotter@tribpub.com\nTwitter @GregTrotterTrib\nCopyright © 2015, Chicago Tribune Chicago Cubs Wrigley Field Tom Ricketts St. Louis Cardinals Kris Bryant Business", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-56183d3b/turbine/ct-rosenthal-cubs-cardinals-1011-biz-20151009", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-5616b9fa/turbine/ct-cubs-cardinals-prices-1009-biz-20151008", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-561d47f6/turbine/ct-cubs-wrigley-field-vendors-1014-biz-20151013"], "published": "2015-10-13T21:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T23:30:27.303+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
