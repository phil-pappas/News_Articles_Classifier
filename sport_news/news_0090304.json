He had asked manager Robin Ventura earlier in the day about his contract after learning that several other coaches had contracts running through the 2016 season.\nParent is the first of Ventura’s staff this year to be dismissed after high offseason expectations faded into a third straight losing season. Parent said he didn’t think that he was taking the fall for a failure that could be placed on many.\n“I’m accountable for what I had to do,” Parent said by phone Friday morning. “I thought I did a pretty good job at this. If it wasn’t enough, that’s fine.”\nParent, who was a catcher for 13 seasons in the majors, was a minor-league manager, including in the Phillies system from 2010-11, before his tenure with the Sox. He joined the Sox after Ventura was hired in 2012.\nHe said he hopes to remain in baseball.\n“That’s what I do,” Parent said. “I retired (before). Being retired was boring.”\nPrivacy Policy Chicago White Sox Robin Ventura", "external_links": ["http://www.tribpub.com/privacy-policy-and-your-privacy-rights/", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-560ebc0b/turbine/ct-white-sox-fire-mark-parent-20151002"], "published": "2015-10-02T20:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T21:05:27.017+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
