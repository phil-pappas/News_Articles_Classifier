(AP) - Shanty Creek’s hilly terrain is a mixed blessing; the slopes thrill skiers and snowboarders barreling downhill but pedal bikers feel the burn. \nThe uphill grind can steer bikers home early or to hitch shuttle rides, said Chris Hale, Shanty Creek’s vice president of sales and marketing. \n“A lot of times our guests will rent a bike and they take a half-day rental or a full-day rental and they’re back within an hour,” Hale told the Traverse City Record-Eagle ( http://bit.ly/1Oq7p5d ). \nNovice cyclists wishing to traverse its seven-square-mile territory can now rent Haibike electric, or e-bikes, with pedal assistance so visitors can ride downhill from Shanty Creek’s fitness center to downtown Bellaire and get back up under their own steam. \nThe bike plugs into the wall, charging a motor controlled by the cyclist. The bikes feature four degrees of assistance - Eco, Tour, Sport and Turbo - available to riders traveling slower than 20 mph. \nHale expects the e-bikes to boost Shanty Creek’s bike rental program, which has likely suffered for the resort’s hills. \n“Most casual tourists aren’t exactly riding the Tour de France,” he said. \nThe bikes are good for older cyclists or those new to the sport, and they still allow riders to get good exercise because they can turn battery assistance on and off as needed. \nBut they may not be fit for trails. The Bureau of Land Management in the mountain biking Mecca of Moab, Utah restricted all motor-assisted bicycles - electric, gas or diesel - to motorized trails only. \nBrad Gerlach, Friends of Glacial Hills trail manager, said he has yet to see e-bikes show up on Glacial Hills Pathway and Natural Area in Bellaire. The bikes aren’t allowed on the mountain bike trails, which are reserved for non-motorized use. \n“The problem with e-bikes is that the amount of torque that can be applied on an uphill climb can damage the trail bed,” Gerlach said. “Even the least powerful e-bike has much more torque than a world class mountain biker.” \nThat additional torque could wear away mud and expose sand on the trail, making it difficult for future riders to pass. \nNorthern Michigan Mountain Bike Association vice president Don Clewley agreed - motorized vehicles, even those powered by a battery - shouldn’t be allowed on human-powered trails. \nHe cited safety concerns, too, since the bikes could allow riders to ride beyond their skills. \n“It’s kind of like a shortcut,” Clewley said. “If they ride out beyond their abilities because they’re using a motorized apparatus, they haven’t had time to develop the skills. If they’re rolling downhill gaining speed they’re probably going to make mistakes.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T07:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T08:07:52.185+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
