That year, Winston and Mangum, both seniors in high school, shared the Elite 11 MVP award. Four years later, Winston, who is now the quarterback of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers after being selected No. 1 overall in the 2015 draft, owns a lot more accolades, including a national championship, the ACC Player of the Year award, the 2013 Heisman Trophy, and the 2013 AP National Player of the Year award. \nMangum, on the other hand, is just getting his collegiate career started as the much-talked-about freshman who took over for BYU when senior Taysom Hill went down with another season-ending injury. \nYoung, the former BYU and 49er great and NFL Hall of Famer, said he trusts Dilfer’s judgment and is now waiting to see if his assessment pans out. \n“I can’t wait to see how that goes,” he said. “I had that in my pocket, and now I get to see all the elements he was talking about. I think he’s going to get good really fast. I’m very excited.” \nYoung, who is a seven-time Pro Bowler and three-time Super Bowl champion, said that serving a mission for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints might delay Mangum’s development, but it won't derail it. \n“That DNA doesn’t disappear,” he said. \nThe desire to compete is also something that doesn’t evaporate, even when the body breaks down. \nAs thrilled as Young is to see what Mangum is capable of as the leader of BYU’s offense, he’s heartbroken for Hill. \n“I saw such growth in him,” Young said of Hill. Watching him early in the Cougars' first game against Nebraska, the Hall of Famer said he saw a special season for Hill and BYU. \n“I turned to whoever I was watching the game with and said, ‘This kid could win a Heisman,'” Young recalled. “He’s gotten so much better and improved his game so much.” \nYoung said doesn’t know what Hill will decide, but if he was in his shoes, he’d apply for that medical redshirt and return for one more collegiate season. \n“My gut reaction is that I would return,” Young said. \nBut whether Hill feels the same way or not, Young believes Hill will get another chance to play football. \n“I think he’s too dynamic not to try,” he said of whether he thinks Hill would try to declare for the NFL draft. “I think he’d always wonder about being hurt. And (the injury) won’t keep him from having an opportunity. He was too dynamic for someone not to give him a shot.” \nYoung discussed BYU’s quarterbacks just a week before he returns to Utah as part of the Forever Young Foundation’s Give Salt Lake event on Oct. 13-14 at the David Eccles School of Business at the University of Utah. The two-day workshop brings business leaders together with nonprofit providers and community leaders in hopes of helping each find ways to be more efficient in serving those in need. \nThe event is an expansion of what the Forever Young Foundation, which has an almost perfect rating from Charity Navigator and was named one of the top charities of 2014 by The Huffington Post, has done for many years. \nThe foundation advises nonprofits and community leaders on how to help their charities operate more like businesses. \n“People get into philanthropic work because they have a vision and they’re service-minded,” he said. “They may not necessarily have the business acumen to go create a success financially. Even the fundraising arm has to operate like a business. The program we’ve offered (through Forever Young) helps charities get better at business.” \nAfter doing that for 10 years, they decided bringing those same types of entities together in a two-day event might help even more charities and community leaders, while assisting businesses in finding ways to more effectively incorporate giving into their business plans. \n“A lot of companies want to institutionalize their giving,” he said. “That’s why we’re bringing in for-profits, so they can better understand questions like, ‘How are they going to engage in the philanthropic world?’” \nNonprofits, on the other hand, need to understand how a better business plan will support their charity’s goals. \n“How can I be better, more efficient in my vision so the business part is more efficient so we can actually serve the vision of our nonprofit,” Young said. “I think this will actually spur conversations between business and nonprofits.” \nThe event has a long list of very successful businessmen and businesswomen, who’ve also found ways to partner with charities, including Robert C. Gay, who has helped run companies like General Electric, Bain Capital and Huntsman Gay Global Capital. Another keynote is Spencer Zwick. \nOne unique aspect of the event is the pitch session, where charities can present their ideas to a panel that will award $25,000 grants to those with the best vision. \n“It’s not meant to be as harsh as ‘Shark Tank,’ but to give nonprofits a chance to pitch, ‘What’s my idea, my goal?’ And hone their vision, put a structure around how they fundraise, how they are going to scale, and have them really start thinking about best practices.” \nThe event includes work sessions, master classes, panel discussions and the pitch competition, as well as a gala. All proceeds raised go to support nonprofits in their philanthropic endeavors, and there are a number of ways for-profit companies, community leaders and charities can participate.
