The RedHawks' mark falls to 1-4, 0-1 MAC, while the Golden Flashes improved to 2-3, 1-0 MAC. \nAfter being shut out for three quarters, the RedHawks put together an impressive rally in the fourth quarter with two touchdown scores. They entered Kent State territory with less than two minutes to play before the Golden Flashes sealed a victory with an interception of senior quarterback Drew Kummer with 1:02 remaining in the game. \nKummer finished the game 19-for-48 with 315 yards and one touchdown. Redshirt junior Rokeem Williams and sophomore tight end Ryan Smith led the RedHawks with five catches each. \nOn the ground, redshirt freshman quarterback Gus Ragland picked up a team-leading 75 yards on 14 carries in spot duty for Kummer. Freshman kick returner Maurice Thomas garnered 120 yards on special teams, including a 38-yard return in the first quarter. \nThe Golden Flashes earned quick points in the first quarter with a pair of Shane Hynes field goals on their first two drives. The freshman kicker connected from 38 and 28 yards out to give Kent State an early 6-0 lead at the 6:59 mark of the opening period. \nFollowing a Miami drive that stalled after entering Kent State territory, Golden Flashes wide receiver Antwan Dixon scored on a 75-yard reverse play. With Hynes' extra point, Kent State had stretched its lead to 13-0 with 6:59 remaining and they would take that score into the locker room at halftime. In the third quarter, junior quarterback Colin Reardon connected with wide receiver Ernest Calhoun for a 44-yard touchdown pass that improved Kent State's tally to 20-0 with 6:52 remaining in the period. \nKent State resorted to a conservative running attack following the touchdown and Miami's defense was able to make stops heading into the fourth quarter. \nThe RedHawks finally made it onto the scoreboard after Smith's one-yard touchdown run, his third of the season. Senior kicker Kaleb Patterson hit the extra point to make it 20-7 Kent State at the 5:36 mark of the fourth quarter. \nOn the ensuing drive, Miami's defense forced a fumble by Reardon and took over at their own 35-yard line. After a critical fourth-down conversion by Kummer, a pass interference penalty on the Golden Flashes placed Miami in the red zone. The RedHawks took advantage with a 2-yard touchdown pass from Kummer to redshirt freshman tight end Nate Becker in the back of the end zone. A successful Patterson extra point made it a 20-14 game with 3:15 remaining. \nA Miami stop on third down led to a punt that set it up at their own 27-yard line with 2:12 remaining in the game. Kummer led the team into Kent State territory before throwing the game-clinching interception after being hit at the 1:02 mark of the fourth quarter. \nMiami will remain on the road next Saturday when it takes on Ohio in the Battle of the Bricks in Athens, Ohio. Game time is scheduled for 2 p.m. and it will be broadcast live on ESPN3. \n*Information provided by Miami University Related Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T23:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T03:42:57.147+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
