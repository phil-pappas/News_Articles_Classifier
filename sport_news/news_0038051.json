Rogers Centre was almost silent. The only sound was the rhythmic crack of the bats as his Blue Jays teammates took batting practice. Martin was in an exceedingly positive mood, talking about how he had spent the day before the decisive game of Toronto’s American League division series playing video games and tuning out the baseball world. “Did the Dodgers win?” he asked someone sitting with him on the bench. “What happened in the Cubs game?” Martin created a vacuum in his approach to playing in his own game later on Wednesday, and it did not include watching any baseball. OCT. 14, 2015 Martin, though, became a spectator of Game 5 of the American League division series against the Texas Rangers . He went from being the central figure in what might have become one of the most infamous gaffes in baseball history — along with Mickey Owens’s dropped third strike, Merkle’s Boner and Bill Buckner’s error — to cheering his teammates along with millions of fellow Canadians, watching an unfathomable seventh inning unfold.

In the top of the seventh his toss back to the pitcher hit the bat of Shin-Soo Choo. The ball rolled onto the field, allowing Rougned Odor to score the go-ahead run from third base (after lengthy arguments between managers and umpires, several replays and ugly disorder from the fans.) “There’s two ways to handle it,” Martin said. “You either feel sorry for yourself, or you do something about it.” Martin and the Blue Jays chose to do something about it. Fittingly, he led off the bottom of the inning with a routine ground ball to shortstop and catapulted himself down the first base line. Shortstop Elvis Andrus misplayed the ball — the first of three consecutive errors in the inning — and Martin was safe. He said it was as hard as he had run down the line all season. “I’m thinking, ‘I better do something,’ ” he said. “I mean, I knew what I did.” Martin reached second on an error by Mitch Moreland and then was removed for a pinch-runner. He took a seat in the dugout and watched as history unfolded — another error, a bloop out that made the score 3-3, and then one of the best moments of his life: Jose Bautista blasting a three-run homer that hit the facing of the second deck and then flipping his bat toward the Rangers dugout like a defiant matador tossing aside his cape as Rogers Centre exploded in joy. Now, Martin would never be remembered as a villain in his country. “I don’t know if it’s karma or something out of our control that helped us in that moment,” Martin said. “But, 1-1 pitch, and he crushed it. He knew it, we knew it; the whole stadium knew it. The place went nuts. Magical moment, one of the best moments of my life.” \nAdvertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T23:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T23:53:38.360+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
