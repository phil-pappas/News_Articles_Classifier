Glovin, stationed near the right post, got favorable position and banged it past Ludlowe goalkeeper Caroline Serniak, setting off a wild celebration as Warde fans stormed the field. \n“It was a blur. I knew there were something like, 10 seconds left and we had to get the corner off,” Glovin said. “Claire put a great … she couldn’t have put a better ball in there and I knew going in that I was going to get a head on this and I did and it just snuck in the net.” \nAs emotional as the victory was for Warde, which remained undefeated at 12-0-1 heading into Saturday’s showdown against St. Joseph, it was equally devastating for Ludlowe, which gave the defending Class LL runner-up all it wanted (and more), taking a tie right down until the final seconds. \n“This was a hard-fought game by both teams, they really went at it,” said Ludlowe interim head coach Peter Nikac , who took over this season for Kate Dawson , who’s out on medical leave. “I told the girls that short of winning, to lose in the last three seconds … not bad.” \nWhile Ludlowe, which had won seven straight going into the Warde game, had the better chances in the first half, it was the Mustangs that got the first goal as Hannah Allen controlled a cross from Teresa Andres and beat Serniak in the 19th minute. But two minutes into the second half, Ludlowe pulled even as Elizabeth Dailey controlled the ball in the box and chipped the ball over Mustangs goalkeeper Mollie Kerrigan to tie the game at 1-1. \n“They wanted it. At halftime they all knew that there was no way that they (Warde) should have scored,” Nikac said. “They knew it and they said they were going to go right at them and get that goal back. And as soon as they got it, that lifted them up. They wanted more.” \nAnd the Falcons almost got it. But Kerrigan robbed Ludlowe’s Peyton Brown from point blank range with 20 minutes to play, a save that would have put the Falcons in front. \n“Mollie is the backbone of the team,” Warde head coach Tom Cunningham said. “Just her leadership alone is tremendous. And she makes big stops. When it comes down to a big situation you can definitely count on her.” \nOver those final minutes, both sides went back and forth like boxers, looking for the tiebreaker. Warde got the corner, Pullen put the ball on goal and Glovin headed it home. \n“Anna has been tremendous with a lot of our free kicks and corner kicks,” Cunningham said. “She’s a good target for us and she gets up there.” \n“I had a feeling that I was going to get a head on it and I just snuck it inside the far post,” Glovin said. “It was just a matter of getting it in time and thank God it went in.” \nWARDE 2, LUDLOWE 1 \nWARDE 1 1—2 \nLUDLOWE 0 1—1 \nRecords: Warde 12-0-1, Ludlowe 7-4-1.
