Special photo by John Silas slideshow MABLETON — With defense and ball control, Pebblebrook ended a 10-game losing streak against region opponents.Gianni Montgomery rushed for two touchdowns and J’uan Weary returned an interception for a score as the Falcons shut out Campbell over the final three quarters, on the way to a 27-6 victory at Falcon Stadium on Friday.Pebblebrook’s last win against a region opponent was against Kennesaw Mountain on Nov. 1, 2013, when the Falcons were still in Region 4 .“First region win in a long time for this school,” Pebblebrook coach Kevin Saunders said. “It’s good for the kids and good for the seniors. They’ve worked hard.”Even though Pebblebrook (3-3, 1-2 Region 3 ) dominated the ball for much of the second half, it still led by just eight points early in the fourth quarter. Then, with a chance to extend the margin, Tre Wright, who rushed for 117 yards on 26 carries, was stopped at the goal line on fourth-and-1 with just over 7 minutes to play.But Pebblebrook’s defense stepped up again, forcing Campbell quarterback Jawan Nobles into four consecutive incompletions and giving the ball back to the offense at the Spartans’ 33-yard line. Three plays later, Montgomery, who finished with 73 rushing yards, essentially sealed things with a 19-yard sprint to the end zone after taking an inside handoff for a 21-6 lead.“We moved the ball and spread the ball around well,” Saunders said. “Our counters looked good (Friday).”Aaron Young ended Campbell’s next interception with an interception, which Jacobe Burke turned into six more points on a 30-yard pass to Malik Matthews to finalize the scoring.In the first half, Pebblebrook took the lead just seconds into the game when Weary caught Nobles’ tipped pass and returned it 30 yards for a touchdown with 11:05 remaining on the clock.“I thought our defense played well,” Saunders said. “Our kids played really hard and that was something we needed to get us over the hump.”Campbell (2-4, 0-3) responded on its next possession. Facing third-and-5 just inside Falcons territory, Nobles lobbed a pass to Michael Lyons, who stayed on his feet just long enough to complete a 48-yard touchdown catch. Campbell, however, missed the extra point and trailed 7-6.After a pair of empty drives by both teams, Pebblebrook rebuilt its lead midway through the second quarter when Montgomery took an inside handoff and raced 25 yards to the end zone for a 14-6 advantage.“We were really physical at the point of attack, so I really thought that was good, and no turnovers either,” Saunders said. “When we don’t turn the ball over, we are pretty good.” Share This Article | similar stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T09:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T02:00:35.652+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
