The Golden Bears, behind a goal and an assist from Madeline Beaulieu, defeated Chenango Forks, 2-0, Monday to win their second straight STAC title. \nBeaulieu, a senior, opened the scoring 10 minutes, 18 seconds before halftime on a gorgeous goal from probably 30 yards. She helped to double Vestal's lead on a pretty pass to Alivia Meyer with 16:05 to go in the second half. Between those plays, Beaulieu won numerous 50-50 balls and showed off her speed on both ends. \n\"We talk about not taking a play off,\" Vestal coach Bill Stepanovsky said of Beaulieu. \"She's surely an example of that. She's involved when the ball is in motion and she has a purpose.\" \nStill, from the get-go, these young Blue Devils — when starting lineups were announced before the start, nary a Forks senior made her way to midfield — took it to Vestal. \nForks junior McKenna Williams hit the outside of the netting on a shot from the right side 30 seconds into play. Thirty seconds later, Brooke Maietta dribbled in free on the right side and drove a shot just over the crossbar from right side. Another shot with 27 minutes left in the half forced Vestal goalie Jessica Powell to make a two-handed save above her head. \n\"It's always unfortunate when you have opportunities, no matter what stage of the game,\" Forks coach Chris Walsh said. \"You work really hard during the season to make those payoff and they know it.\" Buy Photo \nVestal's Victoria McKnight and Chenango Forks' Anastasia Rusnak battle for the ball Monday. (Photo: Jeff Miller / Correspondent Photo) \nStepanovsky sounded impressed by the Blue Devils' early surge. \n\"We talk about playing close to your marks, and we didn't do that,\" he said. \"That's a very good team. You let them push the ball, and they'll make you look silly.\" \nWith 26½ minutes left before halftime, Stepanovsky subbed in five players, and that's about the time the Golden Bears started to gain control. \nWith a little over 18 minutes left in the half, freshman Victoria McKnight lined a shot that Forks goalie Hannah Fuller caught over her head.

(Photo: Jeff Miller / Correspondent Photo) \nVestal's next chance resulted in the game's first goal. \nMcKnight had possession in the middle, about 25 yards out. She then passed back to Beaulieu on the right side, at least 30 yards from the goal. Beaulieu settled it before her right foot made pure contact with the ball. The laser to the upper-90, far post left Fuller no chance. \n\"I saw the pass coming to me,\" Beaulieu said. \"I was just really trying to focus on keeping it low, drive it to the far post and it went in. It felt good coming off my foot.\" \nAdded Walsh: \"If you're going to make a shot, you're going to earn it. Our keeper is fantastic. They're not going to come easy, but there was no taking that away. It was a beautiful goal.\" \nHalftime shots showed Vestal with a 5-4 edge in shots, both sides had one corner kick and Fuller stopped four shots to Powell's three saves. \nLopsided best describes what occurred after halftime. \nRachel Wallace, one of 11 Vestal seniors, blasted a shot off the far post from the left side and teammate Sydney Regan shot over the crossbar on the rebound with 29½ minutes remaining. \nFuller, who finished with eight saves, ventured far off her line to bat away a dangerous crossing pass with 17½ minutes to go before Vestal's pressure finally paid off about a minute later. \nBeaulieu and Forks' Williams battled for possession on the right side, with Beaulieu finally winning possession. She then raced toward the end line before sending liner to the center of the box, about 10 yards from the goal. Meyer barely had to move, heading it inside the left post with 16:05 to play. \n\"I tried to keep it away from the goalie when I crossed it and (Meyer) made great contact,\" Beaulieu said. \"It was a beautiful goal.\" \nVestal continued to press and if not for some quality work from Fuller and her defenders, the Golden Bears could have had two or three more goals. \nFuller made a diving save with 6:40 left, just pushing a shot past the right post, Forks defender Robin Confer headed a shot off the line and Olivia McKnight's rebound attempt smashed off the right post with 5:50 remaining. \nNext for Vestal is the Section Four Class A title game against Johnson City at 5 p.m. Oct. 30 at Waverly. The Golden Bears will be in search of their sixth straight sectional championship. \n\"This doesn't happen too often. To go 16 games without allowing a goal is pretty impressive,\" Stepanovsky said. \nForks (13-2-1) is back at it Tuesday against visiting Chenango Valley in a Section 4 Class B quarterfinal. The Blue Devils are seeded second in the bracket behind Seton Catholic Central. \nOn Twitter: @PSBRob 11 CONNECT 4 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://press.sn/1LHrcfF TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T07:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T17:40:43.162+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
