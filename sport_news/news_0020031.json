However, to call him a rookie would be inaccurate. Since the age of 5, Gordon had been achieving glory behind the wheel. His decades-spanning career saw him battle NASCAR greats, from inaugural NASCAR Hall of Fame inductee Dale Earnhardt to todayâ€™s current superstars. The NASCAR Hall of Fame is proud to display a career retrospective featuring nine iconic race cars from his open-wheeled beginnings through his final NASCAR Sprint Cup Series season. Admission is $19.95 for adults, $17.95 for seniors and military, $12.95 for children 5-12 and free for children younger than 5.
