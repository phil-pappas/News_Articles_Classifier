We weren’t perfect, but we did a decent job. They’ve played the same way since the September workouts and the six days of practice. We’ve changed up with our power forwards so many times that you could see everybody hesitating last night saying ‘oh, what am I supposed to do on this one?’ We were just way behind the play.”\nVan Gundy said deciding on a base defense and keeping the principles easy to understand should help.\n“Hopefully, we’ve straightened it out,” he said. “We’re not worried about game-planning for Brooklyn or Milwaukee or anybody else. We just want to get our stuff and if (opponents) they can exploit it for now they can exploit it. We’ve got to have a base we can go to.”\nInterchangeable parts: Expect to see Marcus Morris a lot at power forward during the season. Also, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope and Jodie Meeks could see some limited time in the backcourt together in a pinch.\n“You’ll definitely see Marcus at the four,” Van Gundy said. “Jodie’s an explosive offensive player. He didn’t have his best game defensively, but he came in and worked on it and did a good job today.”\nInjury update: Starting point guard Reggie Jackson (sore Achilles tendon) practiced and could be available for Thursday's game against Brooklyn. Backup center Aron Baynes, who had right ankle surgery before the start of training camp, went through two-thirds of the practice.\n“No new injuries,” Van Gundy said. “We didn’t go much full court, but he (Jackson) did go, so that was good. I don’t anticipate Aron playing. I want him to get through a practice where he doesn’t have to pull himself out. Reggie, we have to see how he feels in the morning. There’s a possibility he could play.’’\nBrandon Jennings (Achilles tendon) did some shooting on the side. As he walked off the floor, he threw up a shot over his head and it went it.\nPraising another Reggie: Reggie Bullock was on the floor in the second half because he has made a good impression at the defensive end and is in the mix.\nThe 6-foot-7 forward from North Carolina had four assists and three rebounds in his 18 minutes of action in the loss to Indiana .\n“In practice coach wants me to be all over the floor,” Bullock said. “He knows what I can do at the defensive end. That’s what I try to do; practice and transfer it to the game. It’s great that the coach has confidence in me to put me out there with his best five defensive players. I felt like we pushed the intensity when we were out there and forced some turnovers and knocked down shots. It was all about us playing together, it wasn’t me by myself. We were bonding and trying to help each other out if somebody messed up. My strengths are shooting and defense. My teammates know I can shoot the ball, but I’m only going to shoot when I’m open.’’\nHelping out: Van Gundy said shooting coach Dave Hopla has already paid dividends.\n“He has helped (Stanley Johnson) a lot,” Van Gundy said. “I think he has helped Andre (Drummond). I think guys like working with him. He has shown Stanley a lot of film on his shot and other really good shooter’s shots so he can see the difference.’’\nJohnson was the last player to leave the court, working with Hopla on his jump shot.\nLittle tired: After trying to chase down Indiana All-Star forward Paul George, Van Gundy said Johnson was a little tired at today's practice.\n“Thirty-three minutes and your first NBA training camp ... is different,” Van Gundy said. “The pace of the game is different than what he had in college. The people you are playing against and the amount of things that you have to know and remember. He’s good. In his first week because of injuries we used him in four positions.”\nJohnson finished with 26 points.\nContact Perry A. Farrell: 313-222-2555 or pafarrell@freepress.com.
