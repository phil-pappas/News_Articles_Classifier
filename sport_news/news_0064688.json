Filed: Saturday, October 24, 2015 at 00:58 UK Last Updated: Saturday, October 24, 2015 at 00:59 UK \nFiery Newcastle United striker Aleksandar Mitrovic has acknowledged that he must rise above Sunderland's riling tactics in Sunday's North-East derby at the Stadium of Light. \nThe 21-year-old's past has been a talking point in the build-up to the Wear-Tyne clash after previously being sent off twice for Anderlecht in Belgian derbies with Club Brugge, with one of his red cards being for a headbutt. \nThe Serbian, a £13m signing in the summer, also saw red within 16 minutes of the 1-0 defeat by Arsenal in August, but the marksman - who scored in last week's 6-2 demolition of Norwich City - is confident that he can make headlines for the right reasons on Wearside. \n\"I want to stay on the level,\" he told the club's official website. \"I know they will try to provoke me, but I will keep my head strong and try to score goals and help my team-mates. \n\"There will be a lot of passion at the next game, but I do not want to make the same mistake that I did against Arsenal and do something stupid. \n\"It is a derby. I am only 21 but I have played in a lot of big derbies, big games, and I can say I know how to play these games and score goals in them. I hope I will continue with my goals and score in my first game against Sunderland.\" \nMagpies boss Steve McClaren recently backed his man to keep his cool .
