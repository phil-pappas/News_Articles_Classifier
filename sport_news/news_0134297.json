In June in Massachusetts, Langer successfully defended his Senior Players Championship title for his fifth senior major victory. \nThree strokes behind defending champion Michael Allen and Scott McCarron entering the round, Langer had eight birdies and one bogey Sunday to finish at 12-under 204. \nDunlap shot a 68. Allen and McCarron, making his seventh start on the tour after turning 50 in July, each shot 70 to tie for third at 8 under. \nLanger earned 270 Charles Schwab Cup points to pull within 66 points of leader Colin Montgomerie with two events left. Montgomerie tied for 15th at 3 under after a 72. Jeff Maggert, 39 points behind Montgomerie, withdrew during the second round because of a lingering left calf injury. \nCopyright © 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T00:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T01:54:34.084+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
