Posted Oct. 24, 2015 at 12:20 AM Updated at 12:22 AM Posted Oct. 24, 2015 at 12:20 AM Updated at 12:22 AM PENSACOLA — The District 1-5A race became something of a jumbled mess after Friday night’s action, with Mosley’s 20-7 loss to Pensacola contributing to the chaos and keeping all five teams in the playoff mix heading into the last week of the district season. The Dolphins (4-4 overall, 1-2 in district) couldn’t take a step forward in their quest for a return to the state playoffs, falling in a defensive struggle to the Tigers, who avoided elimination. Pensacola opened the scoring with a touchdown to go up 7-0 with 2:33 left in the first quarter, then got a 70-yard punt return to set up a short touchdown drive to make it 14-0 with 7:35 to halftime. Destin Coates’ 8-yard touchdown run brought Mosley back to within one possession midway through the third quarter, but the Dolphins were unable to mount another serious threat. The Tigers’ last score came on the final play of the game when a desperation attempt by Mosley quarterback PeytonCalhoun was ruled a fumble and returned for a touchdown after time expired. Despite the loss, Mosley coach Jeremy Brown said he was happy with the way his players competed. “I thought we played really well,” Brown said. “The kids played hard, played their butts off. Sometimes two really good teams play and both play well and one team has to win and one team doesn’t. But I thought the kids played well. It was one of those games where somebody was going to have to make a big play on special teams or hit a long run and we weren’t the team to do it. They did it on special teams and that was the difference. “I feel like we’re in the toughest 5A district in the state, definitely most competitive and evenly matched.” Coates led Mosley with 21 rushes for 90 yards and a touchdown, while Jimmy Daniel had 16 carries for 54 yards. Calhoun completed 6 of 17 passes for 117 yards, with Alonzo Johnson catching three for 37 yards. Ezra Gray had four catches for 27 yards. With none of the five District 1 teams with more than two wins or two losses, all five still are alive for the playoffs, with Arnold the only league team that has finished its district schedule. Both Bay and West Florida can clinch playoff berths with wins over Mosley and Pensacola next week, though there exists two potential three-way shootout scenarios and another in which all five teams finish 2-2. “When you play the last district game of the year and you still have a chance to be in it, everybody is going to come ready to play,” Brown said. “I feel like we’ll get Bay High’s best effort and they’ll get ours, and I think West Florida and Pensacola will give it their best, too.” By THE NEWS HERALD", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T08:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T09:50:39.406+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
