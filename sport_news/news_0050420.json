He was very, very accurate,” Faith Lutheran coach Vernon Fox said. “He stayed in the pocket, kept his eyes down field and delivered some good balls.”\nMarshall carried the ball 10 times for 164 yards, and Alec Netski had four catches for 74 yards and a touchdown.\nAfter dropping its opener, Faith Lutheran (6-1 overall, 5-0 Sunset League) has won six straight games.\nRay Brewer can be reached at 702-990-2662 or ray.brewer@lasvegassun.com .
