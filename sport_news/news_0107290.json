(AP) - Kentucky has been picked to win the Southeastern Conference men's basketball crown, even if the Wildcats won't have much of the roster from their Final Four run last year.\nKentucky received 406 points from the panel of SEC and national media. The poll was released Wednesday. It's the 11th time since 1998-99 the Wildcats were voted preseason favorites.\nKentucky forward Skal Labissiere, among six freshmen on its roster, was picked for the preseason all-conference team along with teammate Tyler Ulis. Another freshman, LSU forward Ben Simmons, was chosen as SEC player of the year. He joins former Kentucky forward Julius Randle as the only players picked to win the award before playing their first college game.\nVanderbilt was second in the poll, followed by Texas A&M, LSU, Georgia and Florida.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
