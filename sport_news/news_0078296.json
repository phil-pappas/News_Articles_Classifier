In the 2nd singles, senior Kim Yi lost in straight sets to Liya Davidov, 1-6, 1-6. And in the 3rd singles, sophomore Sanjana Ratakonda also fell in straight sets to Bianca Lieber, 1-6, 5-7. \n“It’s been a great season,” Krupnick said. “We’re 13-2, so we are really feeling good about how we played all season. We still have three more matches and all three matches that we have left are in the conference.” \nIn the first doubles match, sophomore Allie Gregorek and freshman Melissa Mao were defeated by Jessica Reich and Elise Kim, 4-6 and 1-6.
