Talking about his match-winning knock, Dhoni said he was in two minds when he was left stranded with the tail. “It was an opportunity to make runs. Though I scored runs and we won the game, I usually don’t want such an opportunity to come,” the skipper said. “You want your top-order to perform. I felt we needed partnerships at that point of time. Once we lost (Ajinkya) Rahane and a few other wickets, I was thinking of playing the big shots as I was not sure how long the lower order would survive. “But then I decided against it and looked to play a few more deliveries. The good thing with batting first is, whatever you score, the opposition has to score those runs. Keeping it simple was important and that’s what we did,” he said. Though happy with the series-levelling victory, the skipper believes the team has the ability to perform better. “Overall not a convincing win, but a good win nonetheless. We’re not playing to the best of our abilities, not even 80 percent,” the 34-year-old said. The skipper defended the lack of consistency at the top and the failure of Suresh Raina to contribute lower down the order. “The top-order has been scoring loads of runs in the last two-and-a-half years, so the lower-order hasn’t got much chance to bat,” he said. “Besides Suresh Raina, there’s nobody else who wants to go out in a situation where he has to go for his shots right away. Dhoni was fantastic with his captaincy: Harbhajan Veteran off-spinner Harbhajan Singh on Wednesday praised MS for displaying fantastic captaincy skills while leading the team to victory against South Africa. “Dhoni was fantastic with his captaincy. The wicket was nice to bat on and the ball was turning only when you bowled it slower,” said Harbhajan. “We felt we were 30 runs short and Dhoni said in the huddle that if we kept up the energy and saved 25-odd runs on the field, we could do it.” — Agencies", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T11:33:23.337+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
