Texans' Foster returns after leaving with injury 1 / 2 Back to Gallery HOUSTON (AP) â€” Houston running back Arian Foster has returned after leaving in the second quarter against Indianapolis with an unspecified injury. Foster was injured Thursday night on a hard hit with about 4 minutes left in the second quarter. He remained on the field for a couple of minutes while trainers looked at him before walking off the field. He came back in two plays later and carried the ball for no gain before going to the locker room. He was back on the field for Houston's first drive of the second half. It was Foster's second game this season after he missed Houston's first three games after groin surgery. ___ AP NFL website: www.pro32.ap.org and www.twitter.com/AP_NFL Most Popular", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T05:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T05:37:06.501+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
