Off the court, Bernardy works with horses through a community 4-H program, learning handling and riding skills to improve with her own two horses. \nQuestion: Other than volleyball, what other activities are you involved in? \nAnswer: I became really involved in 4-H and (Future Farmers of America), FFA since my freshman year in high school and 4-H since I have been in sixth grade. . . I ride horses, it’s called gaming, just like barrel racing. Then I show pigs at FFA. \nQ: What started you wanting to ride horses? \nA: I have two horses of my own. Two quarter horses, both mares, their names are Mary and Lady. . . My mom had horses growing up and she passed that down to me. It was really fun to experience that, it’s just you and your horse getting better. . .To have 4-H members encouraging you and supporting you, you have friends and you build friendships in the club and outside the club. It’s something bigger than yourself and I really like that. \nQ: What has been the best part of your high school career on the Meridian volleyball team? \nA: I have been playing with this team for four years and the highlight has been that we have improved so much as a team, our technique and our dynamic and chemistry. I have been playing with the same group of my friends since fourth grade and it has been really fun to play with the same team for as long as I have. \nQ: What is your favorite place to go in Bellingham? \nA: My favorite place to go in Bellingham would have to be AB Crepes, that is a really fun place to go with friends during the weekend. My (favorite crepe) would have to be the strawberry banana Nutella one. \nQ: What is your least favorite class in school and why? \nA: Math, just because I have never been a very good mathematician but it has always been something I hoped to get better at. \nQ: If you could meet anyone from history, who and why? \nA: From just taking history this year in school, Anne Frank because of what she had to go through and all of the diaries that she wrote. \nQuick hits \nFavorite movie: Good Will Hunting \nFavorite song: Two Weeks by Grizzly Bear \nFavorite author: Peg Kehret", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T06:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T20:26:07.036+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
