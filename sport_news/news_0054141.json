(Photo: Ben Twingley) \nPensacola High's present situation is unique. \nThe Tigers (3-4, 0-2) are winless in District 1-5A, yet still have a shot at making the playoffs. \nEach of the five teams in 1-5A have at least one loss in district play, and each team holds one more district contest after this Friday night. \n\"Our district is so tough, it's like every game comes down to crunch time,\" PHS coach Mike Mincy said. \"It comes down to tackling well and who has the least turnovers and penalties. Tomorrow night (vs. Mosley) won't be any different.\" \nThe Tigers will host Mosley at 7:30 p.m., in a must-win game for PHS as a loss would result in elimination from the postseason. \nThe majority of Mosley's games this season have been close contests, as the Dolphins score an average of 25.1 points-per-game while allowing 22.8 ppg. \n\"Mosley is very physical, very athletic and very-well coached,\" Mincy said. \"They pose a lot of problems to us. But our coaches have worked hard to get a good game plan and our kids have bought into it.\" \nPHS will aim to get its offense going under dual-threat QB Sederick Smith. \nSmith averages 154.5 pass yards-per-game, 58.1 rushing yards per game and combined for 14 touchdowns through his first six games. \nIn the five-team District 1-5A, the amount of possible outcomes are greater than any other district in the PNJ coverage area. \nBoth playoff spots are still open in 1-5A, and Arnold has the ability to clinch playoff berth with a win over West Florida. \n\"We don't have to tell our kids, they know it's do or die this week,\" Mincy said. \"It's almost been like a playoff atmosphere around our field house this week. All year, our team has just controlled the things that we can. They've done a very good job of focusing and getting ready for our next game.\" \nWant to Go? \nWho: Mosley Dolphins vs. Pensacola High Tigers. \nWhere: Pensacola High.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T06:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T10:40:01.124+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
