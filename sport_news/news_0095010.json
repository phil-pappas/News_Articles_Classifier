It was CU's third win against a ranked opponent this season, a ledger that includes an early home win against then-No. 9 Florida State and a road win two weeks ago against then-No. 22 Oregon. \n\"It's a great feeling, to be honest,\" Austin said. \"We've been trying to beat them for four years now, so to finally get that win is great. Now we have to carry it on to all the other games.\" \nCU received consecutive kills from Joslyn Hayes and Gabby Simpson to break a 23-23 tie late in set 1 and take an early advantage. The Buffs took command of the match late in set 2, breaking a 25-25 tie with consecutive points from Hayes and Nicole Edelman to take a 2-0 set lead into the break. \nStanford avoided the sweep with a 25-23 decision in set 3, but the Buffs refused to wither and steadily pulled away throughout the second half of the fourth set.

Alexis and I have been playing against most of those starters for a long time. They're all great players, but it definitely feels good to get that win.\" \nAfter pushing No. 1 USC to five sets at home last weekend but then following that effort by getting swept by UCLA, the Buffs responded admirably over a weekend that also included a Friday night victory against Cal. The Buffs improved to 12-8 overall and, more importantly, 4-4 in what is arguably the toughest volleyball conference in the nation. \n\"I look at the last four matches, and I know (UCLA) didn't go the way that we wanted, but there's really good volleyball being played,\" CU coach Liz Kritza said. \"People that know the game a little more understand that some of the things these young women are doing are truly exceptional.\" \nGabby Simpson paced the CU attack with a career-high 25 kills while Austin added 17. Edelman's 50 assists marked the fourth time in six games she has reached the 50-assist mark, and Cierra Simpson's 16 digs led a solid team-wide defensive effort that saw four CU players record at least 10. \n\"I think we were more aware of what we needed to take care of and making sure we didn't have lulls in our play,\" Edelman said. \nPat Rooney: rooneyp@dailycamera.com or twitter.com/prooney07 \nColorado 3, Stanford 1 Stanford (11-5, 5-3) 23 25 25 21 CU (12-8, 4-4) 25 27 23 25 \nKills — Stanford : Hodson 22, Lutz 15, Howard 13; CU : G.
