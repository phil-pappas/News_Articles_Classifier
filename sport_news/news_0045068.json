Pentland told the New York Post he was not coming back, after being informed of the decision last week by general manager Brian Cashman.\nThe Yankees ranked second among AL clubs in runs scored this season, but their lineup faltered badly in September – culminating in a shutout loss in the AL wild-card game against Houston. Meanwhile, Mets hitting coach Kevin Long – fired by the Yanks after last season – has his team in the NLCS.\nAssistant hitting coach Alan Cockrell could be elevated to replace Pentland, with Class AAA Scranton/Wilkes-Barre hitting coach Marcus Thames – a former Yankees outfielder – a possibility for promotion to the big-league staff.\nMike Harkey, recently let go by the Arizona Diamondbacks as pitching coach, is a candidate to replace Tuck. A close friend of Girardi’s, Harkey served as Yankees bullpen coach for six seasons before landing in Arizona.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T04:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T08:38:42.587+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
