I kind soul, he’s never one to get flustered. Not only was he flustered at halftime, he was flat out angry. \nKentucky’s first half was abysmal. The offense had a 60-yard run from Boom Williams to setup a score to tie the game at 7-7, but that was only an apparition. Boom only carried it one more time until the second half . Towles wasn’t terrible, but made an unforgivable red zone mistake. The defense looked like they hadn’t prepared for an uptempo offense over the last 10 days , making haphazard substitutions with players getting in place seconds before the snap, allowing a bad Auburn offense to move the ball effortlessly. \nWith 2:00 minutes to go, we thought the half would at least end with the Cats down 10, with the a chance to close the gap and get the ball back to start the second half. Instead, the offense fell to pieces and gave the ball back to Auburn. Auburn got a field goal on that final drive , giving them the 3-points needed to get the win. \nAs bad as the first half was, the Cats had their moments in the second . Kentucky immediately moved the ball effectively, taking the ball 75 yards in 3:11 for a fantastic Boom Williams’ touchdown. The defense forced a 3-and-out, and the Wildcats were back in business. But then, they began missing opportunities. \nKentucky could have used the early momentum to take a one or two-score lead, instead they dropped passes, committed crucial penalties, keeping them behind until the very end. The defense made the stop they had the make, opening the door for Juice Johnson to make another gutsy catch. They made the questionable move to run the ball, before going deep to Jeff Badet. He fought for the ball with the defensive back, right around where Stevie Got Loose. Just like Stevie, the ball got loose and he couldn’t hang on. On the final play, Towles was sacked when Auburn brought the house against Kentucky’s 5-wide receiver look. \nThe last drive had good moments, and some head-scratchers, just like the entire game. @UKFootball Missed Juice on an End Zone Interception \nThe offense had the game looking like it was going to turn into a shoot-out. After Auburn scored quickly for the second time, Kentucky came charging back thanks to a couple of amazing catches by Juice Johnson. His one-handed catch will rival the best of the best from this season . Unfortunately, it didn’t lead to a score. Pat had two guys running slants into the end zone. Instead of going to the hot hand, he forced it to his go-to guy Dorian Baker. \nI’m always ready to defend Pat, but even he cannot defend this decision. \nIt was the first time the Cats failed to convert in the Red Zone all season, leaving vital points off the scoreboard. Missed Touchdown to Take the Lead \nThe lead was there for Kentucky to take halfway through the 3rd quarter. Feeling froggy, the Cats went quick on the snap, narrowly getting the first down on a 4th and short. The next conversion came on a 3rd and long scramble from Patrick Towles. It wasn’t pretty, but they were getting the job done. C.J. Conrad made a play that caused Commonwealth to go WILD, carrying three Tigers four yards or more on his back to turn an average play into a first down. After another good play, there was a flag for illegal substitution. Conrad made another nice play, but on 3rd down, Dorian Baker couldn’t make the same tough catch he made to beat EKU. Instead of blowing the roof off the stadium by taking the lead, they only hung in there, the story of this game. A Missed PI in the End Zone \nThere are some bad calls, and then there are some bad calls that cost you points. Just like the previous drive I spoke of, it started ugly before gaining promise. Backed into their own end zone on 3rd and 22, Patrick Towles dropped a dime to Juice for a gain of 39. The drive catalyst had Kentucky moving smoothly into the red zone. \nOn what could have been a score, the ref decided otherwise. I hate blaming refs, but it took four points off the board. Mark Stoops let the refs know he was displeased. Special Teams gave them Free Yards \nAuburn rarely started a drive inside their own 30-yard line. Austin MacGinnis’ injury limited him to field goal duty, leaving kickoffs to Miles Butler. Auburn’s returners were never uncomfortable, totaling 155 yards on returns. Landon Foster is another perplexing story. I don’t know what has happened, but he only averaged 35 yards a kick. To be fair, he saved the best for last, coincidentally leading to a defensive stop. Juice Johnson was Incredible \nEverybody had ups and downs, except for Juice. The man made big play after big play after big play in between the safeties. After big hits across the middle of the field took him out of the EKU game, he did not hesitate to take a lick from the safety for his first reception. From then on, he didn’t slow down. Juice had a career-high 9 catches for 160 yards , the most receiving yards by a Wildcat since Chris Matthews pulled in 177 in 2010. \nAnd yes, he somehow caught this. @UKFootball \nKentucky football has become the same story, just a different day. They make highlights, then head scratchers. One-handed catches are great, but only having 8-men on the field for the game’s final punt return are embarrassing enough to balances out the awesomeness. \nWhat we’re left with: 2:12 with the ball on the UK 15. 3 points to overtime, 7 for the win. There was a great play or two, but it wasn’t a great drive. Kentucky lacks completeness . \nOne day, the gun Kentucky is using to shoot themselves in the foot will finally run out of ammo.

However, I feel like there is one huge glaring weakness on this team…Defensive Line. They are simply not good enough to get UK over the hump. I also think Matt Elam is perhaps the most overrated player I can ever remember to come out of Kentucky. When Big Melvin went down and Elam came in, he was absolutely terrible. Honestly,with UK’s front four, we get absolutely ZERO pressure on ANY quarterbacks we play. This will continue to be UK Achilles heel until Stoops can actually recruit some SEC caliber guys there. Every other group we got some players, but the D-line is an absolute abysmal joke.

The kicking game is scraping the bottom. fatbrat October 16, 2015 at 12:29 am | Permalink \nThe backup kicker is not SEC level. I see high school kickers driving the kickoffs out of the end zone every Friday night. Foster has truly lost his ability but the backup is even worse. pithuahua October 16, 2015 at 12:36 am | Permalink \nI can’t understand why Quinn starts over Harmon. Quinn is not a good tackler or a cover guy. Must have a good personality. leon singleton October 16, 2015 at 12:19 am | Permalink | Reply \nKentucky looked like the Keystone Cops tonight. Old Coach John October 16, 2015 at 12:20 am | Permalink | Reply \nUK coaches (Head Coach – Defensive Coordinator – Offensive Coordinator) make too many mistakes and get ‘out-coached’ in nearly every game. Too bad. Sorry BBN. How do you have a bye week and yet your defense is so poorly prepared? DJ Eliot is a joke, and yes, he has a supporting cast around him. NOTE TO DJ, you can;t win games giving up 30+ a game, and I thought you had learned that last year. What good is talent if you can’t utilize it, or coach it, or prepare and motivate it to play to game and win? Tired of hearing our coaches admit they were ‘out-coached’ and made bad calls. Coaches having to take the blame game after game after game says something about the coaches. Brent October 16, 2015 at 12:20 am | Permalink | Reply \nAs disappointing as the loss was, I don’t really think it’s fair to even mention the possible PI in the end zone. I just don’t see a penalty on the play. The only possible way is if 18 grabbed Baker on the jump, and you can’t see it from that angle. But even if he did, you’re looking at Baker needing to completely turn around and take 5 extra steps to get the ball. Even if you’re arguing that the contact from the jump knocked Baker off balance, you’re disregarding the fact that the defender has equal right to the ball. 18 clearly was going for it, but the throw wasn’t close and it definitely wasn’t catchable. There was a little contact when both turned for the ball, but that was if anything initiated by Baker.

I’m tired of the marketing, “This is the year!!” Bullshit. Same ol same ol Kentucky. Maybe we’ll make it to the music bowl this year. Whoop Whoop!! Who cares. The QB blows and our D is soft as pudding nothing new… I’m tired of buying into the hype every year. UK should have moved to the ACC when they had the chance. We will NEVER compete for the SEC title. If you disagree, pass the pipe! Thank God for basketball… I’m tuning out football once again and ready to roll with Cal… UK football just sucks!

Both the players and staff have it. But we have great young talent that is learning on the fly in the SEC and is 2 plays from being highly ranked and undefeated. I will take this over the previous several years where 2 plays into the game you knew it was over as we were down 7-0 and just hoped to lose by less than 30.

The defense has actually played very well this year. They have stepped up and allowed us chances to win games. We would have normally been blown out a few times by now. The coaching and play calling needs to get a little better as well as balls thrown behind receivers. I know we have always talked about next year but I do believe we are moving in the right direction. Yes, the SEC is brutal. GO CATS.

Argue all you want but the administration has gone all in in with this football team and coaching staff. In return, we have seen a poor product on the field. Bummer… I expected more from the Stoops staff. I can deal with losing a close game but there were so many errors in the 4th quarter. How much more time do you need to prepare for a weak Auburn team?! Their freshman QB destroyed our D.

But for sure Stoops has made steady improvements every year. Yes they beat themselves again, but isn’t that a characteristic of bottom feeder climbing out of the hole? They looked like a legitimate SEC team for much of the game.
