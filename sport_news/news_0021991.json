He'll be the focal point for the Rebel defense Saturday as much he was the focal point of discussion Monday.\nThe unbeaten Tigers (5-0) will play 13th-ranked Ole Miss (5-1) at 11 a.m. Saturday at Lynch will be attempting to lead the Tigers to their 13th straight victory to extend a school record. Memphis, ranked 22nd in this week's Amway Coaches Poll, is playing as a ranked team against another ranked team for the first time.\n\"(Memphis) is a quality, quality football team,\" Ole Miss coach Hugh Freeze said. \"They are playing with great confidence and have what a lot of us desire in a really sound, good quarterback. He's one of the better ones I've seen on film.\n\"He takes care of the ball. He puts it where it needs to go. He can make all the throws. He's a very, very talented kid with good players around him.\"\nFor the season, Lynch has completed 71 percent of his 146 passes with 10 touchdowns and no interceptions.\n\"Paxton is the leader of that offense,\" said Ole Miss defensive back Mike Hilton. \"He gets that offense rolling. Everything goes through him.\n\"What really stands out to me is that when he's under pressure he'll stand there and make the throws and take hits. We've got to make sure we get a lot of guys get a lot of pressure in his face. But he's really good at making those types of throws.\"\nThe Tigers have lost six straight to Ole Miss. They last defeated the Rebels, 20-13, in 2004 in Oxford.", "external_links": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/4oSjmyhP2C4"], "published": "2015-10-13T22:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T00:37:56.970+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
