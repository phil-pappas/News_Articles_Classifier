Georgia converted one more than did Missouri and thus won the game, 9-6. Here are the grades for Georgia's win against Missouri: \nQuarterback: C- \nGreyson Lambert again graded out at a C- for a second week in a row, passing for 178 yards while completing 23 of 32 passes. Despite his 72 percent completion ratio, Lambert only had three passes that gained 15 yards or more. The big problem for Lambert is being able to read through his progressions and not key in on one receiver. This is well documented in other report cards, but it is starting to become a trend that is not going away. On more than one occasion, Lambert locked in on his throwing target, while other receivers were wide open. Lambert was intercepted on the first play from scrimmage after the ball bounced was tipped, and while he can't be blamed for that, Missouri defenders dropped three other passes that could have been intercepted. The offense runs through Lambert and if he is not playing up to par, it normally reflects across the rest of the offensive positions. \nRunning Backs: C- \nSony Michel got his first start of the season and it was not one of his best performances at Georgia. Michel rushed for 87 yards on 26 carries averaging only 3.3 yards per carry. Keith Marshall rushed for 24 yards on five carries, and Brendan Douglas finally saw time at running back, amassing 24 yards on nine carries. Between the three running backs, they rushed for 120 yards on 45 carries and no touchdowns. The longest run of the game came on a 12-yard run up the middle by Marshall in the third quarter which started a drive that resulted in a field goal. Overall, the running backs didn't have much room to work with because Missouri loaded the box and dared Georgia to beat them with the passing game. The running back corps has their work cut off for them the rest of the season without Nick Chubb, but the off week should help them before they head to Jacksonville to face the Gators. \nWide Receivers and Tight Ends: B+ \nThe wide receivers were not the problem in Georgia's offense on Saturday, although they could have blocked better in the run game. Malcolm Mitchell continues to be Lambert's favorite target, hauling in a team high seven catches for 49 yards. The star of the wide receivers was not Mitchell this game though; it was true freshman Terry Godwin. Godwin caught six passes for 78 yards and looks like he is going to have an excellent career in Athens. Jeb Blazevich, Shakenneth Williams, and Reggie Davis all had one catch each. The wide receivers and tight ends were notable to get yards after the catch, but that lies more on Lambert's shoulders and some passes that were underthrown. Georgia did spread the ball out to numerous receivers which is a good sign moving forward. Morgan's late 34-yard FG lifts Georgia past Missouri 9-6 \nOffensive Line: D \nThe offensive line looks like a completely different unit when they're pass blocking compared to run blocking. The pass blocking looks like the line that everyone thought Georgia would have coming into the season, whereas the run blocking has been more suspect. Brandon Kublanow was nursing a bad ankle and Mark Richt mentioned on Sunday that his guards were not playing to their potential. Lambert was sacked twice, and on one of the sacks both left tackle John Theus and right tackle Kolton Houston were beat by speed rushing defensive ends. Besides the sacks, Lambert looked to have a lot of time in the pocket to make plays. On the other hand, the running backs didn't have much room to run, which was demonstrated by the 2.6 yards per carry for the running backs. The Missouri defense is one of the best in the SEC, there is no questioning that, but the Florida defense is even better, and if Georgia wants to win that game, the blocking will have to improve. \nOverall Offense: D \nThe offense was not able to produce a touchdown all game, and the average yards per play was not anywhere near where it should be. The offensive line was not able to move the Missouri defensive line, which made it difficult for the running backs to gain yardage. The offense has work to do, but the good thing for Georgia is that they have the playmakers to turn these offensive woes around, and it all starts with a good showing against the Gators in Jacksonville. \nDefensive Line: A \nWhat a difference a week makes. The defensive line which graded out at a D+ last week against Josh Dobbs and Tennessee turned right around and played one of, if not their best, games as a unit against Missouri. Missouri rushed for only 21 yards on 22 carries, and could not move the ball on the ground at all. Sterling Bailey had a sack and 1.5 tackles for loss, and Trenton Thompson had two tackles to his name. This game was not about individual stats for the defensive line, but instead about a great group performance that completely shut down Missouri's mediocre offense. What was mote impressive was that the line was missing veterans Chris Mayes and John Atkins due to injuries and started true freshman DaQuan Hawkins. \nLinebackers: A+ \nThis is the type of performance that breeds confidence amongst the entire linebacker group. Jake Ganus had nine tackles, one sack, and one tackle for loss. Leonard Floyd also had a sack, and had two tackles for loss. Davin Bellamy had another great game filling in for the injured Jordan Jenkins, tallying six tackles and a sack. The linebackers played with discipline and even looked good in the situations where they had to drop back in pass coverage. Overall, this is the type of game that many thought the linebackers would be able to achieve on a consistent basis the entire year. \nSecondary: A \nAfter two terrible performances, the secondary looked like a completely different unit against Missouri. Drew Lock, Missouri's quarterback, only completed 11 of his 25 passes for 143 yards. While true freshman Juwuan Briscoe only had a pass deflection on his final stat line, he did look like a rookie. His instincts are keen, and he should be a staple in the secondary for years to come. Fellow true freshmen Rico McGraw and Johnathan Abram joined Briscoe on the field to create what has to be one of the youngest secondary units in the nation. Sophomore Malkom Parrish also had a solid game with two tackles and a tackle for loss. Missouri did have three passes that were completed for longer than 24 yards, but other than those three plays, the secondary had Missouri's wide receivers on lockdown for most of the game. \nOverall Defense: A \nAfter having 38 points scored on them in the two games prior to Missouri, Georgia came out and made a statement only giving up six points. The defense came out strong right from the beginning having to overcome adversity after Lambert threw a pick that put Missouri on the one-yard line, and they held the Tigers to only a field goal. This was a hungry defense wanting to avenge their last two terrible performances and it did just that. This is the game the defense needed to have before the bye week. The game film should rebuild confidence before playing the Gators in a contest that should determine who gets to play in Atlanta for the SEC Championship. \nSpecial Teams: B+ \nThe special teams unit also improved drastically over last week's performance. Godwin looked fearless returning punts and he put Georgia in better field position on the three he returned. Reggie Davis only had one chance to return a kick and he looked more than capable of handling the duties until Isaiah McKenzie is back from his injury. Marshall Morgan did miss a field goal attempt, but redeemed himself by scoring all of Georgia's points and by kicking the game winning field goal. Morgan scored on kicks of 29, 24, and 34 yards. The only questionable call was the decision to attempt an onside kick, but had it had rolled past the ten yards needed for the kicking team to recover the ball, Georgia would've had it as the move caught the Tigers completely off guard. Collin Barber but three punts inside the Missouri 20-yard line and Georgia's kick coverage team was vastly improved over last week.
