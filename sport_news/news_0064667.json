(AP Photo/Nati Harnik) \nLINCOLN, Neb. (AP) — Clayton Thorson’s 37-yard touchdown pass to Dan Vitale and Jack Mitchell’s third field goal gave Northwestern an eight-point lead in the fourth quarter and the Wildcats hung on to beat Nebraska 30-28 on Saturday. \nThe Wildcats (6-2, 2-2 Big Ten) bounced back from consecutive losses to Michigan and Iowa in which they were outscored 78-10 and handed Nebraska (3-5, 1-3) its fifth loss by five points or less. \nMitchell’s 27-yard field goal put Northwestern up 30-22, but the Huskers drove 75 yards in eight plays to pull within two points. Tommy Armstrong’s two-point pass to Stanley Morgan Jr. fell incomplete, and Northwestern’s offense was able to run out the final 4:18. \nThorson passed for 177 yards and ran for a career-high 126, with 117 coming on two carries that led to scores. Armstrong passed for 291 yards and a touchdown. \nThe Huskers have their most losses since going 5-7 in 2007 under Bill Callahan. \nNebraska’s defense mostly shut down the Wildcats through three quarters. Northwestern went three-and-out on five possessions, had a four-play series and had another one end with Thorson sacked for a safety. \nThe Huskers led 22-20 on Drew Brown’s 48-yard field goal to start the fourth quarter. Northwestern went ahead with an extended long drive that saw Thorson convert a couple of third-down passes before he hit Vitale with a pass along the sideline for 37 yards. Vitale dived into the end zone, with the play withstanding a video review. \nAfter Nebraska went three-and-out, Mitchell kicked the field goal that put the Wildcats up by eight points. \nArmstrong hit Brandon Reilly for 37 yards on a fourth-and-6 before he ran in from 3 yards to make it a two-point game, but he couldn’t convert on the try for two points. \nOn the ensuing possession, Thorson and Justin Jackson connected for 28 yards on a third-and-3, and the Wildcats were able to run out the clock. \nJackson carried 14 times for 40 yards and had two catches for 55 yards. \nArmstrong completed 24 of 49 passes but had one intercepted and returned 72 yards for a touchdown by Nick VanHoose. \nAnthony Walker made 13 tackles and Dean Lowery had 10 stops, including six for losses and two sacks for the Wildcats. \nNebraska ran 87 plays from scrimmage to Northwestern’s 57.
