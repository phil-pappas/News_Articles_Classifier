COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. Virginia swimmers Courtney Bartholomew and Leah Smith have been named to the American squad that will compete against Europe’s best in the seventh Mutual Omaha Duel in the Pool, set to take place Dec. 11-12 in Indianapolis, USA Swimming announced. In addition, Virginia coach Augie Busch has been selected as a women’s assistant coach for Team USA. “I am so happy for Leah and Courtney to be selected to the U.S. Duel in the Pool squad,” Busch said. “Anytime you are called on to represent your country in international competition, it is a complete honor, which is exactly how they see it. I am humbled and fortunate to have been named to the coaching staff and I very much look forward to the experience. What gets me the most excited, however, is the thought of seeing these terrific young women perform on such a memorable stage in Indianapolis.” Bartholomew, a senior from Holland, was a 2014 U.S. National Team member and is a 12-time All-American and an eight-time ACC Champion. She earned first-team All-American honors in five events in 2015, including second-place finishes in the 100 back, 200 back and the 400 medley relay, fourth place in the 200 medley relay and fifth place in the 200 IM. Smith, a junior from Pittsburgh, has been named to the U.S. National Team each of the last two years (2014-15) and was part of the American squad at the 2015 FINA World Championships, where she captured gold with the 4x200m free relay. She also earned two gold medals at the 2015 World University Games, claiming first in the 4x200m free relay and the 400m free. At UVA, Smith captured NCAA titles in the 500y free and 1,650y free in 2015.
