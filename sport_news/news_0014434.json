I thought he was really in rhythm. He had some strong throws. Some of those hit me pretty good. I think maybe last week might have freshened up his arm a little bit.”\nSudfeld finished the day going 32-for-42 with 464 yards passing, nearly breaking the single-game school record of 480 yards, and five total touchdowns, four passing and one rushing.\nBut it was the two interceptions that turned Sudfeld’s return from historic to heartbreaking.\n“We threw it well today,” Sudfeld said. “Guys were getting open, protection was good. But then I just made two bad decisions at the end.”\nWhen the Hoosiers took a 52-33 lead into the fourth quarter and were looking to drain the clock, a snap went over senior punter Eric Toth’s head and was recovered by Rutgers for a touchdown, bringing the IU lead to 52-39.\nStarting its second drive of the quarter with 14:50 to go, Sudfeld took the Hoosiers down the field on two consecutive junior receiver Ricky Jones first downs.\nBut on third-and-9, Sudfeld was flushed from the pocket and forced to throw off-balance, resulting in a throw that did not lead intended-receiver Jones enough and was intercepted by Isaiah Wharton deep in Rutgers territory.\nThe Scarlet Knights drove down the field following the interception, and running back Robert Martin ran in his third touchdown to cap off a 68-yard drive and bring the Hoosiers’ lead down to 52-46.\n“On that crosser, I didn’t really see it,” Sudfeld said. “I guess I didn’t lead him enough or maybe should have put a little more on it. I guess it kind of floated.”\nWith Rutgers within one score, after having been up by 25 points earlier in the game, IU needed to put together a scoring drive. But on the first play, Sudfeld underthrew the ball on a deep route to junior receiver Mitchell Paige. It was intercepted by Anthony Cioffi in Rutgers territory again.\n“We got the look we wanted on the post,” Sudfeld said about his second interception. “The safety came down on the run fake, so I thought it was one-on-one with the safety on his back. I got hit as I threw it and stalled a little when I threw it, so I kind of underthrew it. I’ll never make that mistake again.”\nFollowing the interception, Rutgers drove down the field once again, stalled to a third-and-1 and Rutgers running back Paul James found a seam for 40 yards and a touchdown, pulling the Scarlet Knights into a tie with the Hoosiers 52-52.\nAfter an IU three-and-out in the next drive, Rutgers ran 13 plays to the IU 9-yard line and kicked the game-winning field goal as time ran out, winning 55-52.\n“We are a mature team,” Sudfeld said after the loss. “We were just exposed tonight. We got too cocky on the sideline, and we weren’t able to make a play when we needed to or stop anybody when we needed to.”\nWhile IU had a 5-2 record dead to right, it will take a 4-3 record to East Lansing next week as it takes on top-10 Michigan State.\n“Everybody is disappointed with it,” Sudfeld said about the loss. “But we’re not going to dwell on it. It’s up to me as the leader of the team to make sure we have a fresh focus this week, because we have a great opportunity this week.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T05:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T06:49:18.537+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
