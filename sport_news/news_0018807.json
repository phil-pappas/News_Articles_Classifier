The charging document does not identify the drug Stamos was allegedly using.\nStamos was arrested on June 12 on suspicion of driving under the influence and was hospitalized for a possible medical condition.

If convicted, the actor faces six months in jail.\nBeverly Hills police declined to identify the drug Stamos had allegedly taken before his arrest.\nThe charges come at a busy time for Stamos, 52, who is working on a reboot of \"Full House\" for Netflix and has a Fox sitcom, \"Grandfathered,\" which premiered on Sept. 29. The show centres on Stamos' character, who discovers he has a son and infant granddaughter he never knew about.\nStamos' publicist, Matt Polk, declined to comment on the charges.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T21:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T20:20:20.937+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
