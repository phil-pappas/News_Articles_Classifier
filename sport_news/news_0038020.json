The FBI denied Manning's 2014 request to release the records under the Freedom of Information Act, claiming they may be relevant to a pending or prospective law-enforcement proceeding.\nManning argues that her 2013 court martial should render that exemption moot, since any further prosecution of her in federal court would constitute double jeopardy, barred by the Constitution.\nManning is appealing her conviction and undergoing gender therapy while serving 35 years in military prison at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T06:52:02.963+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
