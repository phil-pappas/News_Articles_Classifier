A substantial number of former Judges, The Tribune spoke to, insist it’s too early to comment on the Supreme Court verdict. But they are firm that the verdict will prevent corrosion of judiciary; and the collegium system, indeed, needs to be made more transparent as ruled by the Apex Court Bench. Welcoming the judgment, Supreme Court’s former Judge, Justice Kuldip Singh, says the verdict will go a long way in bringing about greater transparency and accountability in the system, evident from the fact that the Bench has fixed a date in November for suggestions, on improving the system, from the Bar, the government, the petitioners and anyone else having something to say. “It’s foolproof, if it is transparent and accountable,” says Justice Kuldip Singh. “There is no alternative. You see the Judges know who all are good and fit for appointment as sub-Judges, High Court Judges, and even Supreme Court Judges. The Judges are the best selectors”. Welcoming the verdict, former Chief Justice of the Allahabad High Court, Justice S.S. Sodhi, says the National Judicial Appointments Commission (NJAC), as proposed by the government, had inherent in it the potential of political considerations playing a role in the appointment of Judges. “This judgment, therefore, is to be welcomed to preserve the independence of judiciary”. Describing it as apt and correct, Supreme Court’s former Judge, Justice Ashok Bhan, says greater transparency in the system is always appreciable. A collegium member for three years, Justice Bhan says the State even under the collegium system has its say at all stages of appointment. Recommendations are forwarded to the Chief Ministers and report from the Intelligence Bureau is also sought before the matter is placed before the collegium. The names travel to the Law Ministry, the Prime Minister’s Office and the President before the elevation takes place. The executives’ say in the matter is also evident from the fact that almost 80 per cent of the times the names are dropped upon objections by it, adds Justice Bhan. Not in favour of the NJAC, Justice Bhan says the possibility of a name not finding favour, just because the lawyer argued a case against a politician at an earlier point of time, could not be ruled out under the new system. A part of the collegium system in Chandigarh and Mumbai for nearly four years, Supreme Court’s former Judge, Justice H.S. Bedi, says he is not in a position to comment on the judgment without going through it. But says the collegium system was “misused tremendously”. “After all, the Judges in the collegium too are human beings,” he says. Justice Bedi adds the system undeniably needs to be made more transparent; and the basic guiding principle should be preservation and appreciation of merit. Former Chief Justice of Karnataka and Kerala High Courts, Justice N.K. Sodhi, says any institution is as good or bad as the people managing it; and that is true for the collegium system as well. But, obviously, far more transparency is always welcome. Andhra Pradesh High Court’s former Chief Justice, Justice Manmohan Singh Liberhan, too, is unwilling to comment on the judgment. But he feels the collegium system was worthless. Justice Liberhan also believes transparency in the system of appointment of judges would expose the judiciary to unwarranted and uncalled for criticism. “Otherwise also, judiciary loses its respect, if it’s transparent”.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T21:52:04.473+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
