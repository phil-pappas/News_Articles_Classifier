Stewart and freshmen cornerback Mike Hughes have been indefinitely suspended from football team-related activities due to a violation of team rules related to an incident that occurred on Oct. 4 in Chapel Hill. \nStewart was also suspended in 2014 for UNC's season opener against Liberty due to violating team policy involving an off-field incident during fall training camp. \nThe pair will both miss the team's game this weekend against Wake Forest, the university said in a press release. \n“We have been aware of this situation since the night of the altercation and have been working closely with the University and Chapel Hill Police to gather relevant information,” head coach Larry Fedora said. “We hold our players to a high standard and M.J. and Mike will face the consequences for their involvement.” \nStewart tallied 20 tackles and led the team with three interceptions and four pass breakups. He played in 12 games last season as a true freshman for Carolina and recorded 26 tackles, four pass breakups and two interceptions. \nHughes recorded three tackles and one pass break up in five games for the Tar Heels this season.
