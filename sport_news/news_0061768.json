In his first 13 games against the Lions, Peterson ran for 100-plus yards eight times and scored 11 touchdowns on the ground.\n- Larry Lage reporting from Detroit\n___\n9:30 a.m.\nKevin Harlan and Rich Gannon typically call games for CBS, but on this particular football Sunday, their microphones say \"NFL on Yahoo.\"\nThe league is experimenting with streaming the matchup between the Buffalo Bills and Jacksonville Jaguars from London. With kickoff at 9:30 a.m. EDT, it is available only through Yahoo outside of the teams' home cities, not just within the United States but around the world.\nThe NFL wants to figure out whether there's significant money to be made in distributing games \"over the top\" - streaming them directly to fans. Yahoo and other tech companies such as Google and Apple could be future partners in how the league broadcasts the sport, to go along with its traditional deals with the television networks.\nViewers in Buffalo and Jacksonville are able to watch Sunday on their local CBS stations. Everywhere else, anyone with an Internet connection can see the game for free. The stream is available on any device through various Yahoo properties, including Tumblr, and the NFL's website and app.\nFans are still able to watch on their televisions if they own connected devices or sets.\n___\nAP NFL website: www.pro32.ap.org and www.twitter.com/AP_NFL\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T18:21:12.289+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
