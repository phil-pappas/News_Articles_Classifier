If we can stick with Samoa for the first 60 then for the last 20 we should be able to come home pretty well.” \nJones, who has an excellent World Cup pedigree having guided Australia to the 2003 final and been an adviser to the triumphant Springboks in 2007, said that judging from the team selected by his Samoan counterpart, it was obvious the Pacific islanders are going for brute force over subtlety. \n“They’ve picked an interesting team, they’ve left out their acknowledged fetcher (Jack Lam) and picked a very big back row,” said Jones. \n“So there’s no secret as to how they’re going to play.” \nJones and Japan’s outstanding skipper Michael Leitch concurred that having shaken off the fatigue and mental effects of the 45-10 whipping they took at the hands of Scotland, a few days after the Springbok victory, there would be no excuses offered if they lose. \n“The team is in excellent condition,” Jones said. \n“The only thing we’re worrying about is the injuries we got from the Scotland game. \n“We just need to manage those injuries. \n“But apart from that, the physical conditioning of the players is first class. We don’t have any excuses for the game.” \nSamoa: Tim Nanai-Williams; Ken Pisi, Paul Perez, Johnny Leota, Alesana Tuilagi; \nTusi Pisi, Kahn Fotuali’i; Failfili Levave, TJ Ioane, Ofisa Treviranus (capt); \nKane Thompson, Teofilo Paulo; Census Johnston, Ole Avei, Sakaria Taulafo \nReplacements: Motu Matu’u, Viliamu Afatia, Anthony Perenise, Jack Lam, \nVavae Tuilagi, Vavao Afemai, Mike Stanley, Rey Lee-Lo \nJapan: Ayumu Goromaru; Akihito Yamada, Male Sau, Harumichi Tatekawa, Kotaro \nMatsushima; Kosei Ono, Fumiaki Tanaka; Ryu Koliniasi Holani, Michael \nBroadhurst, Michael Leitch (capt); Hitoshi Ono, Luke Thompson; Kensuke \nHatakeyama, Shota Horie, Keita Inagaki. \nReplacements: Takeshi Kizu, Masataka Mikami, Hiroshi Yamashita, Justin \nIves, Amanaki Mafi, Hendrik Tui, Atsushi Hiwasa, Karne Hesketh \nReferee: Craig Joubert (RSA)  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T01:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T01:55:12.672+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
