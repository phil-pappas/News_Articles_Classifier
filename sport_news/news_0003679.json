The offense was particularly anemic Tuesday against Vancouver, managing a mere 15 shots in a 3-0 loss that gave the Kings their worst start since 1969-70. \n\"We're just not doing the things that we've got to do to get the quality chances and the shots,\" top-line center Anze Kopitar said. \"Whether that's not coming in with position or recovering the puck the way we should, we're playing too soft.\" \nKopitar and notable offseason addition Milan Lucic are both minus-three without a point. Seven-time 30-goal scorer Marian Gaborik also has none and Jeff Carter owns just one assist. \n\"Absolutely there's a sense of urgency. We need some production out of those guys,\" coach Darryl Sutter said. \nA challenging schedule may have contributed to the early struggles, as the Kings' first three opponents -- San Jose, Arizona and Vancouver -- are a combined 9-1-1. \nAnother tough assignment lies ahead. After going an NHL-best 28-9-3 over the final 40 games of last season, Minnesota (3-0-0) has begun this one with its best start since opening 2008-09 with four consecutive wins. \nThe Wild stayed undefeated with Thursday's 4-3 victory over Arizona that started a three-game trip. Zach Parise and Thomas Vanek scored 58 seconds apart in the first period and Mikko Koivu stretched the lead to 3-0 in the second. Devan Dubnyk stopped 25 shots in his first meeting with the Coyotes since his mid-January trade that sparked the team's second-half run.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T17:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T17:31:17.533+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
