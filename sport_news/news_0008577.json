John Locher AP 1 of 3 Order Reprint of this Story ROCK HILL \nOn the eve of tickets becoming available for the Democratic presidential forum at Winthrop University, the venue for the nationally-televised event has been changed. \nThe forum featuring the leading contenders for the Democratic presidential nomination will now be held in Byrnes Auditorium on the Winthrop campus. \nThe S.C. Democratic Party announced the venue change in a press release Thursday, just 24 hours before public tickets become available for the Nov. 6 event at firstinthesouth.com . Tickets will now be made available for free on a first-come, first-serve basis. \nThe forum was originally scheduled for the Winthrop Coliseum, but was changed to Byrnes “to better highlight the University's main campus and to provide a more welcoming environment for Forum guests,” the party said. \nLast month, the auditorium hosted a rally for Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders that nearly filled the building to capacity. Byrnes seats 3,500. The coliseum, on the other hand, has an official capacity of 6,100. \nThe top three contenders for the Democratic nomination – Sanders, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley – have committed to appear in separate interviews with moderator Rachel Maddow, to be broadcast on MSNBC starting at 8 p.m. \nOther candidates have also been invited to appear, including Vice President Joe Biden, who has yet to announce his candidacy. \nThe forum will be held three weeks after the Democrats held their first televised debate of the 2016 campaign. Only six debates between the candidates have been scheduled leading into the primary season, making the Winthrop forum one of the few opportunities to see all of the candidates on stage together. \nTickets for the forum will go on sale at 9 a.m. Friday. The South Carolina Democratic primary is scheduled for Feb. 27.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T17:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T00:49:19.039+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
