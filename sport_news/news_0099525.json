Don't look for your team on network, cable or DirecTV this Sunday. The Bills-Jacksonville Jaguars game, being played in London, can be seen only through a live stream carried by Yahoo. The NFL is promoting this as an exciting foray into the digital media landscape, and part of the league's strategy to increase the international appeal of America's favorite sport. Yahoo trumpets its partnership with NFL as an experience \"designed for the modern fan.'' \nThat may be so -- unless you happen to be on the wrong side of the digital divide. Fans without smartphones, high-speed Internet connections or computers will have to resort to that 20th century marvel, radio. ( K-Rock , FM-100.9, broadcasts Bills games in Syracuse and Utica.) \nYahoo promises fewer commercials , which may make for a speedier game. The ads are sold out, Yahoo announced, without saying how its ad rates compare to the networks. You can be sure the company will recoup the $20 million it paid to the NFL for the privilege of streaming the game. \nThe NFL-Yahoo deal is an interesting experiment. The league would be foolish not to follow its audience to the web. But it had better be careful not to move so fast that it leaves the bulk of its TV audience behind.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T14:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T21:18:19.192+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
