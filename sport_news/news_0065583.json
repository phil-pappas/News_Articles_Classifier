Ancelotti is a big name and can only manage at a select few elite, big name clubs. It just so happens that Chelsea (where Ancelotti previously managed) is off to a terrible start and Blues Manager Jose Mourinho is currently under fire. Although Chelsea ownership has given Mourinho a vote of confidence, there’s still plenty of speculation about how warm Mourinho’s seat might actually be. Mourinho has even said that Chelsea can “sack him if they want.” As for Ancelotti, he was linked to Liverpool before they announced the hiring of Jurgen Klopp. Although yesterday Ancelotti said the Reds actually never contacted him. Ancelotti’s name also came up when Manchester United sacked David Moyes, but they of course went with Louis van Gaal instead. Whenever there’s talk of Manuel Pellegrini being on the hot seat, again Ancelotti’s name often comes up. However, it doesn’t appear that the former Real Madrid boss will be taking over a giant Premier League club any time soon. At least not Chelsea. \n“I don’t think Mourinho will be sacked, absolutely not,” Ancelotti said to Goal . \n“He has changed little from last season and he’s at a club that he knows very well. Plus, the club knows Mourinho very well.” \n“Jose is one of the top coaches of all time and if anyone can turn it around he is the person.” \n“I believe that it’s mainly a problem of motivation at Chelsea. From a technical point of view, the team is the same as the one that dominated the league last year. But their motivation levels have dropped.” \n“They had a terrible start and they need to rediscover their drive. The Champions League, in this instance, can help them, because it could give them an injection of confidence and help them rediscover the right determination.” \nChelsea will likely not sack Mourinho, even if they miss out on the top four. Because after all, as The Special One himself put it, he’s entitled to one down year. Paul M.
