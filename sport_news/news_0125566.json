This might have been true in a couple of ways during Tuesday night’s NLCS Game 3, but definitively so in the top of the sixth inning, with the Mets clinging to a 3–2 lead.\nWith two outs and a man on first, Mets shortstop Wilmer Flores lined a 93-mph two-seamer from Trevor Cahill to right. The ball came off the bat with as much sink as it had come in, and was rapidly tumbling to the turf as it approached rightfielder Jorge Soler . He initially thought to dive at it to catch the ball in the air, but then thought better of it. Too late: The ball darted under his half-hearted backhand and rolled in the direction of the wall with what seemed like acres of grass separating it from either Soler or centerfielder Dexter Fowler . It would surely have given the Mets a 4–2 lead. It’s not beyond the realm of possibility that Flores, though he is slow, might have come all the way around to score.\nMLB Video Mets ride Murphy, deGrom to NLCS Game 3 win over Cubs by Jon Tayler", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/@SI_BenReiter"], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T22:03:20.151+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
