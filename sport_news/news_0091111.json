(AP) — Panthers coach Ron Rivera says defensive end Jared Allen will start Sunday night against the Philadelphia Eagles. \nAllen, the NFL’s active career sack leader, missed last week’s game against the Seattle Seahawks with a pinched nerve in his back. Allen suffered the injury in his first game with the Panthers against Tampa Bay prior to the bye week. \nThe Panthers have ruled out rookie linebacker Shaq Thompson (knee), defensive end Dwan Edwards (hamstring), fullback Richie Brockel (hamstring) and offensive tackle Daryl Williams (knee) for this week. \nRivera says linebacker A.J. Klein and cornerback Teddy Williams have cleared the concussion protocol and will play against the Eagles. \n___ \nAP NFL website: www.pro32.ap.org and http://twitter.com/AP_NFL Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T20:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T20:34:02.874+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
