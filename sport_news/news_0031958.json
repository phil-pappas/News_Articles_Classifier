Parrish \nDemocrat Editor \nI have been asked a lot of questions since Friday’s game. While the subject matter is rather depressing, I admit I like being regarded as a know-it-all. \nYou may have seen the Facebook query as to when the last time Booneville was 1-4. The answer was 1980, which was also the last 1-5 and 1-6 before you ask. \nWhen was the last time Booneville lost to Danville? That same 1980 season. The 1981 year the Little John brass would not honor the second year of the contract and Booneville had a nine game schedule \nI was also asked if Friday’s 64 points allowed was the most in a conference game. The answer is probably yes. That’s because Booneville hasn’t given up 60 or more since 1943 when Mansfield won 60-0. \nThe 1943 season was obviously not a great one, it’s the only winless season on record and because of World War II the schedule was abbreviated to four games so I’m not certain there was a true conference. \nAnother inquiring mind wanted to know if Hayden Fennell set a passing record. No, the 169 he had in the air is impressive, but it is the 11th best single game, but three of those were by at least two passers. \nOddly, I wasn’t asked if that was the biggest offensive game in history. The answer is both yes and no. Yes if you mean in terms of points because the 117 total points tops the 110 from last season’s playoff, 63-47 win over Hoxie. \nIt’s no if you mean in terms of yardage. The two teams combined for 991 yards but that is actually only the third most. There were 1,098 yards in the 56-48 win over Ozark in 1999 and 1007 in a 48-25 win over Mansfield last year. That Hoxie game from the last paragraph had 990 yards of total offense.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T13:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T17:51:27.346+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
