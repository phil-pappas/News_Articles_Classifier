We won and we deserved it,\" added Ferretti, who will be replaced by Juan Carlos Osorio as coach after Tuesday's friendly against Panama.\nA huge Mexican contingent at the Rose Bowl brought a festive atmosphere to an aging venue that hosted the 1994 World Cup final and green, white and red Mexican flags were continually waved above a sea of sombreros in a crowd of 93,000.\nEARLY THREAT\nForward Javier Hernandez was an early threat for the visitors with surging runs down the right and opened the scoring in the 10th minute after latching on to a cross from Peralta, who was given space by a superb backheel from Raul Jimenez.\nHowever, the U.S drew level just five minutes later when defender Geoff Cameron struck with a diving header off a Michael Bradley free kick, sparking deafening roars from the U.S. fans watching from behind their home team's goal.\nTempers frayed in the 34th minute after Peralta, looking to slide in on a through ball, went in hard on U.S. goalkeeper Brad Guzan, and the Mexican was yellow carded after a goalmouth melee involving several players.\nMexico began the second half in attacking mode, earning three early corners before the ever-present Hernandez squandered a golden opportunity to score in the 59th minute when he failed to put away a low cross from Jimenez.\nRoared on by chants of 'USA USA USA', the home team created a few chances of their own and the sellout crowd was treated to plenty of end-to end action before the match went into extra time and Mexico sealed the win.\n\"A loss is always difficult to swallow, especially when there's a lot at stake, said U.S. coach Juergen Klinsmann.\n\"It means you have to work even harder to turn the results around and make things happen.\n\"I told the guys, 'Heads up because you gave everything you had out there.' Coming back twice against Mexico and playing very openly is impressive, but it was not enough unfortunately.\"\n(Editing by Greg Stutchbury)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T09:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T08:38:34.182+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
