That is the next challenge.\" \nKlopp was given a rapturous welcome on his first appearance at Anfield and the German appreciated the depth of affection. \nHe said: \"It was one of the best moments for me. I felt everything positive tonight and then I concentrated on the game. \n\"Usually I don't hear too much during the game and it works for me. \n\"But when you come for the first time in a new house, normally you have a present. \n\"I am not quite satisfied with my present tonight but it was only the first time and I will come again.\" \nDespite him not being entirely happy with the result he knows his side will improve. \n\"The team is not full of self-confidence and maybe they got a little bit lost,\" he said. \n\"But we came back. Against 10 it's unthinkable sometimes. They had no counters, they stayed deep and we had to find solutions and we couldn't. \n\"We had lots of shots on goal, 35 I think, but only nine for the goalie.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T08:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T20:12:43.598+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
