It is not good for English football,\" Van Gaal said. \n\"It is not good for the clubs or the national team. I think you should change it. England haven't won anything for how many years? Because all the players are exhausted at the end of the season.\" \nVan Gaal believes the strength of the Premier League, making every game tough to win, is also a problem in terms of winning European trophies on top of domestic success. \n\"It is harder these days,\" Van Gaal added. \"The Premier League is the most difficult league to win because of the high level of the teams. You cannot beat any team easily. \n\"Every team is a challenge. It is a rat race and then you have to play also in the Champions League. It is not so easy and that is why English teams over the last few years have not won the Champions League because of the difference in the leagues.\" Promoted Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T07:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T19:40:26.512+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
