Bosson shot a 76 on Day One before carding an 83 on Day Two for a two-day total of 159. CONNECT 6 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nSUNBURY - To find the last time a Coshocton Redskin appeared in a state golf tournament, you'd have to travel back to 1994. \nNow, 21 years later, senior Gage Bosson finally provided water to that drought by placing third among all individual qualifiers in Friday and Saturday's Division II OHSAA State Golf Tournament. \n\"I've only been in the 80s once this year so I've been pretty consistent,\" Bosson said. \"I made first team ECOL, districts again this year and got to state for the first time in my last year. So that's something to be proud of. It's a really big accomplishment, and it's been my goal since the beginning of this season.\" \nAfter Friday's action, Bosson walked away after carding a 76 — tied for the lead among qualifying individuals. \n\"(Friday) went really well,\" Bosson said. \"I wasn't missing a putt. I was in the zone and chipping went great as well. That helped a lot.\" \nHowever, with delays because of frost, the element of wind and temperatures below 40 degrees, Saturday was a bit different as Bosson shot an 83. \n\"(Saturday) started out pretty good,\" Bosson said. \"But I guess the cold weather got to me. I finished pretty strong (Saturday) on the front with a 40 but didn't finish as strong as I wanted to on the back. But it is what it is. This course is very different. It's lengthy out there, and I thought the greens rolled nicely so everything ruled true. But the weather wasn't bad the whole way. You just had to fight through it.\" \nDuring Friday and Saturday's action, Bosson shot par 21 of 72 times with four birdies. \nOverall, Bosson's two-day total stood at 159, just behind Bishop Fenwick's Miles Jena (158) and Bishop Hartley's Chris Williard (154). \n\"Coach (Kevin) Kittell has helped me a lot. He's always talking me out of a bad shot and everything like that,\" Bosson said. \"And my teammates were here to support me both days as well so I was thankful for that. But I feel very proud of myself. I never thought I'd get here. All my hard work has paid off.\" \nAs for teams, Bexley was crowned state champion with an overall two-day team total of 617. It was followed by Canton Central Catholic, which shot a 627. \nIndividually, Bexley's Cameron Karmia and Dayton Oakwood's Connor Quigley were co-medalists, both shooting a 143 — Quigley tied the second-lowest overall individual one-round score Saturday by carding a 67, or five under par. \nBosson's total of 159 put him at 14th overall, individually. \ndwebb@nncogannett.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T04:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T11:41:30.474+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
