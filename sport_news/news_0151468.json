Bradley was bumped all the way up to second for Thursday's series finale with the Yankees, taking over Dustin Pedroia's customary spot on a night off for the second baseman. \"I just wanted to see how it looked,\" interim manager Torey Lovullo said. \"It gives the lineup a little bit of balance. I just like the idea of Mookie [Betts] hitting ahead of him, maybe hitting some fastballs to the short right field porch. And just wanted to see what it looked like and how it played out.\" Bradley has slumped of late, with just nine hits in his last 68 at-bats. That’s mitigated the incandescent streak he had the month before, and his season numbers reside at a .254 average, .338 on-base percentage and .512 slugging percentage. \"He deserves that opportunity,\" Lovullo said. \"He’s having a really good offensive season. It’s nothing that’s written in stone. It’s Dustin’s spot when Dustin returns, but I just wanted to see what it would look like and how he would respond to it.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T02:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T10:20:27.541+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
