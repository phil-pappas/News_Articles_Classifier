Mitchell, along with co-defendants Dimeyeon Cole, Menyard McAfee and Raymond Winters, were charged in 2013 after investigators found evidence linking them to an extortion scheme, according to a news release from the Cook County state's attorney's office.\nAt the time of the killing, according to the release, Mitchell was a leader of the Black Souls street gang and devised the plot after he found out Green and his brother had access to a lot of money. On June 18, 1999, Mitchell, Cole, McAfee and Winters kidnapped Green from the store, bound him with tape and drove to an abandoned apartment on the west side of Chicago, according to the release. They called Green's brother to demand money in exchange for Green and warned him not to involve the police, prosecutors said.\nAfter Mitchell told the three to go back to the store to determine whether Green's family had contacted police, they said they saw what they thought were two unmarked police cars, the release said. They contacted Green's brother again, telling him to \"make arrangements for your brother,\" then drove to Gary, beating Green in the back of the van they drove, the release said.\nAfter arriving in Gary, Mitchell and Cole dragged Green out of the van, and Mitchell shot him twice in the head, the release said.\nWinters and McAfee pleaded guilty to the crime and are serving sentences; Cole is awaiting trial, according to the release.\nMichelle L.
