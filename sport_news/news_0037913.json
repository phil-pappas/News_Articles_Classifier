Sometimes, people, sometimes old-school people will say olds-school things that they used to say back in the 50s. But it’s not allowed anymore, in 2015, to talk like that. \n“The old school bar is now closed. You need to respect and work with everybody.” \nAubut, 67, resigned on Saturday after a week in which three women came forward with allegations of sexual harassment. \n“I would like to take this opportunity to apologize to those who may have been offended by my behaviour,” the former chief executive officer of the Quebec Nordiques said in a statement. “I realize that my attitude could at times be perceived as questionable by some women and could have caused them to feel uncomfortable.” \nAccording to a statement released Saturday by the COC, the original complainant, a female colleague, has asked for her complaint to be withdrawn. As a result, an investigation headed by Francois Rolland, the former chief justice of the Quebec Supreme Court, has been suspended. \nA third-party investigation into the other complaints will move forward. \n“It has been a horrible time for us the last few days,” Brassard said. “At first, it started with a complaint within the COC and rapidly it became a Pandora’s box, where every day was something new happening. \n“The first and foremost thing is to make sure the team is OK, the group is good and the employees are comfortable. We don’t want anybody to hide anything and maybe regret a few years from now that they didn’t say anything.” \nAs the week went on, Brassard found himself fielding questions about why he never said anything about Aubut’s alleged conduct with women. \n“Marcel, the former president, was a guy who everybody knew sometimes was a little awkward,” said Brassard, who has attended numerous public functions over the years with Aubut. “Sometimes, he was awkward in the way he walked, in the way he dressed, and the way he spoke to the public. \n“But the problem is, I never noticed anything (in terms of harassment). I heard some stories, but no facts. No nothing.” \nUnder Aubut, the COC made huge gains in sponsorship. Just last week, the professional services company Deloitte announced a 16-year partnership extension. \nThe question remains whether the Aubut scandal will affect the bottom line. \n“If we lose a sponsor, we’ll be the ones responsible for it,” Brassard said. ‘We’ll have to face it. We’ll have to deal with it. \n“But also in the end, it’s also a great opportunity to show our sponsors we can make a difference and lead the discussion on this topic.” \nOn Saturday, the COC publically thanked the original complainant for her “incredible courage” in coming forward. \nBrassard hopes other women (and men) hear about her experience and speak out about their own experiences in the workplace – no matter how frightening that may seem. \n“Very few women talk about these things,” Brassard said. “It really matters that we show the example to the whole country that it’s not taboo anymore to do that. \n“We know that it’s tough as a woman, because sometimes, when you decide to speak about things like that, it can mean you lose maybe 25 to 30 years of a career. And you’re scared to lose all of that work and then maybe just being left over when the story is over. \n“The COC needs to be an example and that’s the most important thing at this time.” \nThe COC is expected to name a new president within days. \nvhall@postmedia.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T09:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T00:36:52.128+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
