Girls' soccer: Patrignani's OT goal lifts Vineland \n“The first half, if they could’ve kept their possession and first touch, we were still doing the things we needed to do,” coach Amy Ardito said. “(Mainland) plays through the middle and we could’ve exploited their outsides, and we play to the outside, we play soccer in, out, in, out, moving the ball back and forth, and we could’ve exploited that better with our possession rather than playing to them. \n“We were playing a little nervous. It was 1-0 at halftime. If we could’ve capitalized on the things we talked about, it would’ve been a different game.” \nVineland appeared on the right path when the second half kicked off, as the Red and Gray had their most consistent attack of the afternoon. \nBut when Alyssa Nanni’s direct kick clanked off the crossbar in the opening 10 minutes, momentum shifted. \nMainland’s Emily Ziereis made it 2-0 in the 56th minute, and Lexi Miller put away her own rebound soon after to push the lead to 3-0. Kailyn Gallagher’s marker with less than two minutes to play was just icing on the cake. \n“I could see their body language, and I said to them, sometimes mentally I feel like in their minds they say oh here we go again,” Ardito said. “Rather than getting mad and wanted to put the ball in the back of the net, I think that’s a mental thing and I think that’s something they have to learn through experience.” \nPatience also comes with experience, and the Fighting Clan have lacked that on the offensive end over their current four-game losing streak, forcing the ball into bad situations. Vineland has scored just four goals during that stretch. \n“It’s tough because I feel like we’re always back on our heels because the other team is pressing us so hard ,and when we get that little glimpse of hope to score and it doesn’t happen, it’s a little bit discouraging,” junior forward Sarah Patrignani said. \n“Everyone’s feeling some type of struggle,” Milam added. “We’re not all connecting, we’re not all on the same page. We’re all on a different page and that’s the most important part of the team. We all have to be on the same page and we’re losing that right now and we lose it a lot when we get down.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T02:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T23:47:21.504+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
