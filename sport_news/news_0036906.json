Turnovers, leaky defense and bad decisions hung goalie Tuukka Rask out to dry and earned the B’s a 6-2 defeat at the hands of the Winnipeg Jets.\nThis is a work in progress, especially with the Bruins’ depleted defense, but one can only hope they are quick learners.\nThanks to a disastrous second period, the B’s trailed 3-1. David Pastrnak cut it to a goal just 1:25 into the third when he beat Ondrej Pavelec with a shortside wrister.\nBut the Jets pushed it back to a two-goal bulge at 5:17 when the Bruins were caught deep in the offensive zone and Chris Thorburn scored on a 2-on-1.\nThe Jets then all but put it out of reach at 9:51 when Nicolas Petan deflected an Andrew Copp shot past Rask for an insurmountable 5-2 lead.\nCoach Claude Julien pulled the goalie early, but the Alexander Burmistrov added an empty-netter to complete the rout.\nBefore the puck was dropped to begin the season, the only thing certain about the Bruins was the uncertainty.\nNot only were they introducing five new skaters to the lineup, and welcoming back a few more short-timers, they were beginning the season without their captain Zdeno Chara (upper body, day-to-day) and Dennis Seidenberg (back, out till next month), their top defensemen.\nTo their credit, the new-look B’s came out flying, dominating the Jets in the first period, outshooting them 14-6 and jumping to a 1-0 lead.\nOne of the newbies, Zac Rinaldo, got the ball rolling with a rollicking first shift, laying a big hit and taking a punch to the back of the head from old friend Mark Stuart. That should have been called, but Rinaldo drew one when Adam Lowery tripped him at 1:54.\nThe B’s did not score on the power play but it established their momentum, and they took the lead at the 5:36 mark. Pastrnak stole the puck from defenseman Ben Chiarot and circled the net. He tried to center it, but it went off Chiarot and right to David Krejci, who went to his backhand and beat Pavelec.\nThe B’s had several chances to double the lead but didn’t. On the best chance, Krejci set up new linemate Matt Beleskey with a beautiful pass in front, but Beleskey fanned.\nThe B’s went on the power play with 36 seconds left in the period when Burmistrov caught Patrice Bergeron with a check to the head. Bergeron, who has been concussed multiple times in his career, did not go down, but was as angry as you’ll see him. He went right at Burmistrov, taking a roughing penalty, which was matched by Lowry’s roughing.\nIt was not a good looking power play to start the second, and the B’s were lucky to preserve their lead. A Krejci turnover at the offensive blue line led to an Andrew Ladd shorthanded breakaway, but Rask turned it away with ease.\nBut the B’s couldn’t hold it for much longer. The Jets tied it up at 5:36 when, after Joe Morrow’s pass from the defensive zone was picked off in center ice, Dustin Byfuglien took the puck down the right wing and passed back to Mark Scheifele in the middle. With a Jet cutting in front, Scheifele fired a hard wrist shot over Rask’s blocker.\nThe Jets had effectively weathered the Bruins’ first-period storm and were pushing back. They took the lead at 9:17. Ladd stripped defenseman Matt Irwin of the puck behind the net and dished it out front to a wide open Blake Wheeler, who made it 2-1 with a shot over Rask’s blocker arm.\nThe Jets took 3-1 lead at 17:39 after hemming in the Ryan Spooner line and the Irwin-Zach Trotman pairing. Lowry found Drew Stafford at the side of the net for an easy goal.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T11:04:44.837+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
