He shifts his weight to one side, glad to have his right knee free of a brace, and talks about his future.\nTwo weeks until he can jog and start learning his new playbook. Three months until he graduates high school and can participate in football activities fully. Ten months until he'll be active and healthy again for a season.\n\"I do pretty well every day of the week,\" Culpepper said, \"except Friday night.\"\nFor Culpepper, one of the most highly touted commits in Syracuse's 2016 class, senior year can't end soon enough. He received early offers from Florida, Clemson and Ohio State, and threw for 2,016 yards and 20 touchdowns as a junior before pledging to the Orange in June on an unofficial visit.\nThen the three-star prospect and No. 30 pro-style quarterback in his class, per 247Sports.com's composite rankings, tore his ACL playing 7 on 7 in July.\nHe'll be 10 weeks removed from surgery on Tuesday and is counting down the days until he can do more than complete his physical training and play catch.\n\"The ACL's at the point where I feel ready to take the next step and start running around,\" Culpepper said, \"but they're telling me, 'You've just got to trust us; the graft is weak.'\"\nThe second day after the surgery was the hardest for Culpepper. That's when the nerve blocker wore off from his procedure and he began to feel the screws that were placed in his leg.\n\"I've never been in so much pain in my life,\" Culpepper said.\nHe stayed in his house for the first four days, mostly resting in bed, before leaving the house for dinner with his girlfriend on Day 5.\nCulpepper started rehabilitating soon after, focusing on quad exercises and leg lifts while he watched his Plant teammates prepare for the season without him.\nFamily and friends provided support for Culpepper, including his father Brad Culpepper's former teammate at Florida, Kirk Kirkpatrick, who sent videos of professional stars thriving after ACL tears like Adrian Peterson.\nRex helped call a touchdown during a preseason game against Venice High School. He noticed Venice's lone safety rotating toward Plant's trips set and called for a slant-and-go on the back side.\nJudge Culpepper, Rex's younger brother who platooned at quarterback early in the year, hit Whop Philyor for a 79-yard touchdown.\n\"That was really special to me,\" Culpepper said.\nThe first Friday night of the season, though, was extremely difficult. Plant's offense looked \"like a chicken with its head cut off in a 42-8 loss to Colquitt County.\nThe Panthers lost again two weeks ago, 21-3 to Armwood, in a game that Culpepper couldn't help but feel like he could've changed if he was healthy.\n\"When we're winning, it's great,\" Culpepper said, \"but when we're losing, that's when it hits the hardest.\n\"… It gets hard for me on the sidelines. It hits me in waves. Sometimes helping out makes it even worse.\"\nCulpepper spends most practices throwing to a receiver for a couple hours, but he's careful not to move around much or plant too hard on his back foot. At games, he bounces around from the sidelines and the stands, where he watches with his father.\nThe days have become longer as he slowly moves toward an early graduation this winter.\n\"It's gotten to the point where being at this school without football, I just feel a lot less happy,\" Culpepper said. \"I miss the things I used to hate like signing in (at the front desk) in the morning. I used to think about that like, 'God damn I've got to wake up early.'\n\"I wish those things still mattered to me. Now I don't have to get up early because I'm not going to play.\"\nCulpepper maintains his focus through rehabilitation, weekly phone calls with SU offensive coordinator Tim Lester and the three hours he spends each Saturday watching the Orange play.\nCulpepper, who attended part of SU's 45-24 loss to USF this Saturday before leaving for Plant's homecoming, said he's already been sent Syracuse's playbook. Once he signs a financial aid agreement within the next two weeks, he and Lester will be allowed unlimited contact and can start preparing for his January arrival.\n\"That stuff means a lot to me,\" Culpepper said. \"It gives me something to look forward to.\"\nHe's watched current freshman Eric Dungey take the reins of the Syracuse offense and is eager to arrive and compete.\n\"I can only control myself and how hard I work.\" Culpepper said. \"I think that if I keep up what I'm doing and keep working hard every day, when I'm good to go in January I'll be able to give him a fair competition.\"\nThe distraction from his agonizing Friday night routine lasts about 12 minutes. As a light rain starts to fall Saturday evening, Culpepper walks back into the locker room Four more regular season games to go.\nContact Stephen Bailey anytime: Email | Twitter", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/stephen_bailey1"], "published": "2015-10-12T23:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T19:02:07.441+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
