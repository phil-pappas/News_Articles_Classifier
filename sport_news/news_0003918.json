Brendan's body was found around 9 a.m. Tuesday in the woods near South Park Drive and Cooper Street, about half a mile from his father's Haddon Township apartment.\nD.J. Creato, 22, reported his son missing from the apartment in a 911 call around 6 a.m. Tuesday. That stirred an automated police call to residents about the disappearance and a frantic search of cars, yards, and garages.\nEmachah, recalling conversations he said he had with the family after the disappearance, said Brendan had slept on a couch next to the front door, while the boy's father slept in the bedroom. Emachah said the Creato unit is on the second floor and that a person must initially enter a door on the first floor to get inside the building, which has seven units.\nCreato's mother lives a block from her son's apartment and had dropped Brendan off at the apartment sometime before 10 p.m. Monday, Emachah said.\nHe said Creato, who went to sleep afterward, woke up around 6 a.m. for work and noticed Brendan was missing. He first called his mother, then 911, Emachah said.\nEmachah said that Brendan knew how to open the apartment door but had never done so while unsupervised.\nSince that morning, questions and rumors have spread in the Westmont neighborhood about who - if anyone - is responsible for Brendan's death. At a vigil Tuesday, two other friends of the Creato family, Bernadette Ferraro and Donna Duca, said police had questioned D.J. Creato but that he was not involved in his son's death.\nEmachah, also, said Friday that Creato had been questioned earlier in the week, and that he was cooperative.\nNo arrests have been made in the case.\nOn Thursday, Creato answered the door at his parents' house but said he wasn't speaking to reporters.\nEmachah described Creato as \"extremely shy\" but bright, and a helpful worker at his father's Haddon Heights business, Creato Windows & Doors L.L.C.\"They keep saying he sounds calm [on the 911 call], to me he sounds pretty desperate,\" Emachah said.\nBrendan's mother, Samantha Denoto, and Creato do not live together, friends of the family have said.\nAs of 6 p.m. Friday, $16,000 had been raised on a gofundme.com page to help pay for Brendan's funeral. Those services had not yet been scheduled as of Friday afternoon, Emachah said.\nMeanwhile, some Haddon Township residents made plans to commemorate Brendan and express solidarity with his family.\nLibby Henry, 46, who does not know the family, arranged with a florist to have blue bows with a black streamer made for people to hang outside their homes. The colors of the bows symbolize the death of a young boy, Henry said.\n\"We're all feeling so helpless and shocked,\" she said. With the ribbons, she said, \"the family can see that we're all behind them just to support whatever they need and that we won't forget him.\"\nAt Haddonfield Floral Company on Friday, the phone was ringing constantly for orders of the ribbon, said designer Kathy Dallman, who was expecting to sell several hundred. She said many workers at the shop are mothers.\n\"It's very sad,\" she said. \"We're actually crying when we take the phone calls from people.\"\nThe shop is donating $2 of the $10 price of the ribbons to Brendan's family, she said.\nOther events during the weekend will also try to comfort the family.\nOn Saturday, a yoga and body prayer event is planned for 8:30 a.m. at the corner of South Park Drive and West Drive. After the yoga session, those who attend will walk toward the woods where Brendan's body was found. On Friday, stuffed animals lay against several trees there.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T04:25:50.435+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
