A burgeoning field of study called risk assessment is also making a difference.\nMass shootings \"are very preventable,\" Scalora said. \"In a lot of cases, there are warning signs.\"\nRead the story: Stopping mass shooters: Experts share lessons since Thurston\nThat story reflects on an Oregon school shooting in 1998.
