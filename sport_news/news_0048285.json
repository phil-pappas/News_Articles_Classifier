The Wheat Kings won the 2015 playoff series in five games, including three that were decided by a single goal. \nThe loss extended Brandon’s winless streak in shootouts to seven games. The last time they won was Nov. 15, 2014, when Braylon Shmyr scored on his team’s eighth shot. \nHead coach and general manager Kelly McCrimmon said his team played well early in the fast-paced, physical contest, although penalty trouble in the second period proved costly. \n\"I thought our first was very good,\" McCrimmon said. \"We had the 2-0 lead and did a real good job defensively not giving up any chances against. The discipline in the second period with six straight minors, obviously that changed the game. From there it was a much different game.\" \nBrandon took the lead late in the first period with two quick goals. \nTanner Kaspick banged in a rebound after Tyler Coulter’s wrap-around attempt bounced out to him with two minutes left in the first. Just 25 seconds later, Duncan Campbell scored his first of the season when, on a two-on-one, he elected to rip the puck past Edmonton starter Patrick Dea. \nThe lead wouldn’t last, with Edmonton capitalizing on all three power-play opportunities they had in the first five minutes of the second period, getting goals from Aaron Irving, Brett Pollock and Luke Bertolucci \nBrandon tied it midway through the second period when overage defenceman Macoy Erkamps, trailing the play, wristed a shot over Dea. The potential momentum was lost just 11 seconds later when the Wheat Kings took the fifth of their six consecutive minors in the period. \nBrandon also had a goal waived off late in the second after the puck had squirted between the legs of Dea when the referee judged that he had blown the whistle before the puck went over the goal line. \nBrandon dominated the third period and overtime, outshooting Edmonton 20-3, but were unable to pull ahead. \nEdmonton forward Colton Kehler was the only one of six shooters to score, with Nolan Patrick coming closest for Brandon when he rang a shot off the crossbar. \nNo Brandon shooter has scored in the two shootouts this season, with the other coming in opening night against the Swift Current Broncos. \nCampbell said shootouts are a funny thing. \n\"It depends on the day, it depends on the goaltender, how he plays the shot,\" Campbell said. \"Anything can happen. It’s not really something that you can predict.\" \nLike McCrimmon, the 19-year-old Brandon product said the team’s loss could be traced back to three costly minutes in the middle frame when the Oil Kings took the lead. \n\"Starting in the second, we ran into some penalty trouble, stopped moving our feet and ran into some penalty trouble,\" Campbell said. \"We lost momentum and that just changed the whole look of the game.\" \nEven the overtime session was odd, with Wheat Kings defenceman Kale Clague taking a hooking minor and Edmonton being whistled down for one of their own 70 seconds later for too many men on the ice. \nOil Kings head coach Steve Hamilton said he thought his team played a hard, structured game against a Wheat Kings team he called \"loaded with talent.\" \n\"Full marks to our goaltender, he was good for us tonight, and we caught a little bit of offensive flair on the power play for three or four minutes and found a way to hang,\" Hamilton said. \"We’ll certainly take the two points.\" \nThe two teams don’t meet again until Jan. 1, 2016, when they play in Edmonton. \n» pbergson@brandonsun.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T08:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T09:22:24.969+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
