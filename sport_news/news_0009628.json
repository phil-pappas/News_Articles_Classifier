Now coach Dick Umile wants to see what the Wildcats can do without it. That was his immediate takeaway from the Wildcats’ season-opening, 7-3 win over AIC at the Whittemore Center. “There was a lot of stress involved in that game,” Umile said. “I was not happy with the way we played, especially for two periods. We got the win, but we’ve got a lot of work to do. They got too many scoring chances off faceoffs. We lost faceoff draws, and we didn’t block shots when it went to the point.” Umile’s displeasure with the overall team defense slightly overshadowed the offensive production from the first line of junior Tyler Kelleher, sophomore Andrew Poturalski and senior Dan Correale, who picked up where they left off last season. The trio combined for four goals and 10 points Saturday night. Kelleher finished with two goals and two assists, including the go-ahead tally at 8:51 of the second period. It was the second of four unanswered goals by the Wildcats that transformed a 2-1 deficit into a 4-2 lead. “Pots and TK are pretty skilled,” Correale said. “Pots is pretty fast and TK is pretty shifty, so that kind of plays to our advantage and challenges defenses on the outside. It kind of worked out that way tonight.” Poturalski had a goal and three assists, and Correale added a goal and an assist. UNH went ahead to stay, 3-2, on Correale’s no-look pass to Kelleher in the second period. “I think we all think the game well,” Kelleher said. “I think that’s the No. 1 thing. We all have pretty good skills. Correale’s pass behind the back was pretty sweet. He didn’t even see me.” Freshman defenseman Matt Dawson had a goal and an assist in his first college game. Jason Salvaggio and Maxim Gaudreault also scored for UNH, which outshot the Yellow Jackets 33-29, including 10-6 in the third period. “Give them credit for winning the game and finding a way to score goals,” Umile said. “We played a decent third period, but I was not pleased with the way we played the first two periods.” The Wildcats fell behind 1-0 and 2-1 before getting untracked offensively. They were outshot in the second period, 15-13. “We can obviously work on stuff and tighten things up on the back end a little bit,” Correale said. “There’s always room for improvement on that. We did a lot of improving on that last year, and it took until the end of the season. Hopefully we can get it figured out a little earlier this year.” “We had a couple mistakes and the puck ended up in the back of our net,” Kelleher said. “I think we’ve got to fix that up going into next weekend.” UNH hosts St. Lawrence on Friday night and Clarkson on Saturday night before playing its next six games on the road. “It’s a season opener and we haven’t been practicing a whole lot,” Umile said, “but we’ve got to play better defensively. They were getting behind us and we were allowing shots in the slot with nobody on them. We need to do a better job there.” By Al Pike", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T07:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T11:36:40.870+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
