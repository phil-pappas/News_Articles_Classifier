Early Birds: Chip Kelly on Fletcher Cox, defense vs. Saints, and Sam Bradford's speech Zach Berman Posted: Tuesday, October 13, 2015, 1:08 PM \n1) By this point in Fletcher Cox’s career, a good performance is the standard – not the praiseworthy occasion that puts Cox into the consciousness of football fans. He has performed at a high level before, and he’ll perform at a high level again. That’s why coach Chip Kelly did not need any puffery to describe Cox’s outing in Sunday’s 39-17 win over the New Orleans Saints, when Cox had three sacks, two forced fumbles, and one fumble recovery. \n“It's what Fletch has done here since we've been here,” Kelly said. “I think he's just starting to get noticed what he probably should have gotten before. …You go back to last year, and an opponent is talking about going in, getting ready to play us, and they're talking about Fletcher's name. \n“So, he was close in a couple of our earlier games, really close a couple times in the Washington game to getting some sacks. …It's just [Sunday] it kind of all came together for him, but I still remember him picking up and scoring one against Jacksonville [last season]. I mean, he's made some really big plays; this wasn't his first big game for us. But, it's something that we've become kind of accustomed to because of the type of player Fletch is.” \nCox is carving a reputation as one of the best defensive linemen in the NFL, and he’s still only 24. His four sacks this season already match last season’s total, and his two forced fumbles set a career high. At 6-foot-4 and 300 pounds, Cox has rare athleticism for a player at his position. That was apparent when he was able to recover his own forced fumble after sacking Drew Brees. \n“To make a play like that, not only does he force the play, he gets a sack, he causes the fumble, and then recovers the fumble,” Kelly said. “It was a really big play for us, especially at that point in time in the game, too, but I think that's the type of player he is. And I think -- we keep seeing him getting a little bit better every week, so that's a good thing for us as we're moving forward here.” \n2) The Eagles defense limited the Saints to one touchdown for more than 59 minutes, forced four turnovers, and recorded five sacks. It was an impressive performance, except for one part: X-plays – those big plays that hurt the Eagles last season. \nThe Eagles allowed seven plays of 20 yards or more, including a 46-yard catch and a 59-yard catch. Kelly did not let his defense off the hook when asked about it Monday. \n“We probably gave up too many X-plays,” Kelly said. “We've got to really kind of clean that up, but I think our guys did a really good job in red-zone defense. You know, they scored the one where we were just misaligned. …But, I thought overall our defense did a really good job in the red zone of preventing them from really scoring.” \nThe Saints’ first touchdown also came on a defensive miscue. The Eagles made the wrong call, and linebacker Jordan Hicks did not know whether to line up on the tight end in a miscommunication. \n“It was the wrong call, so instead of the discussion about it being the wrong call, play the call because it's not a wrong call if we all line up the right way,” Kelly said. \n3) Kelly downplayed Sam Bradford’s pregame pep talk to the offensive players. Bradford is not known as the most vocal player, but Kelly said he has spoken up before. Kelly said he wouldn’t “make a real big deal out of” what Bradford did. \n“Obviously the guys that speak also have to be able to back it up,” Kelly said. “Sometimes they say ‘the empty barrel makes the most noise.’…There’s a lot of guys who talk all the time and they don't perform. It's a matter of kind of matching it up. But I know our players listen to Sam and have a good feel for Sam.” More coverage", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T19:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T21:01:47.379+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
