Vernon, 8-0, in South Seven Conference boys soccer Tuesday night at Wildcat Stadium. Newman was assisted twice by Jared Baysinger and twice by Conner Riem. Jackson McPhail and Jio Lopez also scored for the Wildcats, who also had a header goal by Newman nixed by an offsides call. Jacob Rice had three saves in goal for the Wildcats. Marion is now 16-4-1 overall and finishes at 7-0 in the South Seven Conference. Now the Wildcats turn to the postseason and face a different path than ever before. Rather than be placed in the Carbondale Regional like usual, Marion heads north to the Columbia Regional to face Troy Triad next Tuesday at 7 p.m. after Columbia plays either Centralia or Mascoutah. Meanwhile, at the Carbondale Regional, the winner of Salem and Mt. Vernon takes on Waterloo with Carbondale facing Herrin-Carterville in the other semifinal match.
