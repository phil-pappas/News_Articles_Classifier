Jefferson City (8-1), however, has reeled off seven straight victories to wrap up regular-season play and haven’t showed signs of slowing with an average margin of victory of 28 points. \nThe Jays’ latest blowout victories were against Rockhurst (55-20) and Battle (44-14) in what are traditionally closely contested matchups. \nThe Jays enter district play as the No. 3 seed, while the Bruins come to town at No. 6. Francis Howell and Blue Springs South earned the top two seeds, respectively. \nFor Jays’ head coach Ted LePage, the main thing he wants to avoid is a repeat of the 2013 season, when the Jays beat Rock Bridge in the regular-season finale, before Rock Bridge promptly ended their season the following week. \n“We have a history of this with them,” LePage said. “And so being kind of a historian, we try not to forget what’s happened in the past because if we don’t change from the past, we’ll never change. So we’re trying to look at it from two years ago and see how we can correct it and make it better for this team.” \nRock Bridge quarterback Karson Ringdahl is out for the year after suffering an ankle injury against Jefferson City. \n“Their offense by losing their quarterback has hurt a little bit,” LePage said. “. … But they’re really leaning on (running back Nick) Collins a lot more.” \nThe Bruins have since used two quarterbacks in sophomore Trevor Twehous and junior Logan Rueter. \nThe Jays will look to stop Collins. Although Collins was slowed for 21 yards on 10 carries in last week’s loss to Winton Woods (Ohio), he rushed 22 times for 167 yards the first time these two teams met. \n“There’s going to be a lot of things we do differently,” LePage said. “One thing, we’re going to play better. We didn’t feel like we played well the first time around. Our players took that personal watching film this week on both sides of the ball. We went and watched the Rock Bridge film, and that wasn’t a very good game for us. … We’ve tweaked some things that we saw that they exploited.” \nLePage is confident in the improvement on the defensive side of the ball. \n“I think our defense is playing more ravenous than it has all year. The last two weeks have just been outstanding watching them really play and gain confidence,” he said. “So, I think going into this game, we’re going to have to play a strong defensive game and calculate chances when we can on offense. \n“That motivates you the second time around to show them that we’ve gotten better.” \nLePage believes getting out to a fast start is imperative against a Rock Bridge team that just two years ago was in the state championship game. \n“We’ve got to go out and start fast,” LePage said. “Any kind of change of momentum can definitely swing in a hurry. … They’re a little scary because they are very good defensively. They defended us as good as any team all year. And I know 31 points is a lot, but they did a very good job defensively. We are going to have to do a better job executing this time around offensively.” \nBeside the four-point win at Rogers (Ark.), the Bruins held the Jays to the closest margin of victory (10) of the season. \n“You just know this is a team that any point in time is explosive as any team in the state of Missouri,” LePage said. “From that aspect, you just go into it preparing your team for what your team can do. \n“They’re always in the game and that’s something we have alerted our players about. We’ve got to play four quarters of football. We have to play solid in all three phases of our game.” \nThe Jays’ goals that were set in December still stand 10 months later. \n“Let’s play,” LePage said. “The goal is we want to win our first district game. It has been very mapped out for the since December. There’s nothing new for them, there’s nothing outstanding. The goal at hand is to win our first playoff game, which is Week 10. For the past 10 months, that has been the objective.” \nJefferson City hosts Columbia Rock Bridge - Updates on Twitter: @AdamBurnsJC .
