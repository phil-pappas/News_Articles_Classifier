Comment By Craig Gilvarg/Daily News Staff Milford Daily News By Craig Gilvarg/Daily News Staff Posted Oct. 25, 2015 at 8:00 PM By Craig Gilvarg/Daily News Staff Posted Oct. 25, 2015 at 8:00 PM A year ago, Kevin DeWall was standing on the opposite sideline. Before taking over as the head coach at Endicott College this season, he spent the previous 12 years working as the offensive coordinator at Hobart, building the team’s offense into a Division III powerhouse. The teams met Week 2 last season. DeWall’s offense was clicking that day, his nationally ranked Statesmen coming away with a 28-18 victory. But there was one player on the Endicott defensive line that demanded his attention. “I just remember preparing for big number 90,” said DeWall. “I remember he was a very good player.” No. 90, he would come to learn, was Franklin native Craig Anderson, an imposing and versatile 6-foot-2, 250-pound defensive lineman for the Gulls. And, as suggested by last year’s first impression, he’s been one of DeWall’s best players this season. Endicott has rallied from an 0-3 start to bring its record to 3-4 — and, more importantly, 3-1 in the New England Football Conference — and Anderson’s play has been crucial to the effort. The junior captain, moving effortlessly between defensive tackle and defensive end in any given game depending on the team’s scheme, has 29 tackles through seven games, including eight for a loss, and leads the Gulls with 7.5 sacks. Most importantly, with his team in desperate need of a spark, something to get its season back on track, Anderson came through with the best performance of his career. It would have been easy for the Gulls to hang their heads after opening with consecutive losses to Framingham State, Hobart, and St. Lawrence. The offense wasn’t scoring points, the defense was having difficulty stopping anyone, and things were looking bleak. The saving grace for Endicott was that all three losses came outside of league play, meaning its foremost goal — winning the NEFC championship — was still very much alive. And so, in Week 4 against Nichols, in its first conference action of the season, Anderson helped his team turn its season around. “We talked about a fresh start for everybody as we moved forward,” said DeWall. “We believe that the offensive and defensive lines really have to set the tone for our success. We have much more experience and depth on defensive line. Craig and a few of his peers, those guys said, ‘Hey, we’re 0-0,' and they went out that day and performed at a high level.” Not just a high level — a record-breaking level. The Endicott defense set a program record that day with 10 sacks in a 42-14 dismantling of Nichols. Anderson, for his part, set a single-game program mark with four of those sacks. For his performance he was named the D3football.com Defensive Player of the Week. Page 2 of 3 - “We definitely took a lot of pride in that performance,” said Anderson. “I feel like the defensive line is one of the strong points of our team. We have a young program, but to set any sort of program record is definitely something you have to take pride in.” More importantly, it put Endicott on a roll. The Gulls came back the next week with a critical 31-27 victory over MIT, with Anderson chipping in with five tackles. “I try to be a good role model not only off the field but on the field,” said Anderson. “So coming up with a performance like that felt great, especially when we needed it the most. We might have been a little down after starting 0-3, but after getting that big win against Nichols, it got us charged up a bit. We came out against MIT with a lot of energy.” And though they fell to St. Lawrence a week later, Saturday’s victory over Maine Maritime puts the Gulls right in the hunt for the conference title — no small accomplishment given everything they’ve had to overcome. Before the season, Endicott’s previous coach, J.B. Wells, stepped down from his position to take the head coaching job at Bowdoin. By the time spring workouts arrived, DeWall was still in the process of filling out his staff. The team was still without offensive and defensive coordinators. He would have to lean on the team’s captains to help encourage his new players to buy in. “I think it takes a different type of maturity, a different type of understanding to say, ‘You know what, I’m going to embrace this opportunity,’” said DeWall. “He saw it as a new start, a new chance, a new challenge, and we’re excited with what he’s done up to this point. “We’re going to continue to guide him and mentor him, but also challenge him because we think he can really be a special player.” Anderson, while acknowledging the challenges posed by the turnover, also admits that it's helped encourage a competitive atmosphere. “It hasn’t been easy learning a new defense every year,” said Anderson. “It has been challenging not just for me, but for everybody; you want to try to have a little bit of continuity. You’re in the same boat as the freshman, all the positions are up for grabs, everyone has to compete, there are no spots. Coming into camp it’s an open roster. You have to prove yourself again to a new coach, which I think is a good thing. Page 3 of 3 - “In a lot of programs some people feel entitled and we don’t have that here, because we’re always competing, always challenging for spots, and always having to prove yourself.” Anderson’s spot, though, seems quite secure. Against Maine Maritime on Saturday, which boasted the fifth-ranked rushing offense in Division III, he had three tackles and half a sack while helping to hold the Mariners to 283 rushing yards — a considerable amount, but more than 60 yards under their season average — in the win. And with matchups against Western New England, Curry, and Coast Guard, the Gulls are right where they want to be — in control of their own destiny. “We need to keep everybody focused and keeping morale up is definitely important,” said Anderson. “You have to go out and practice every day. Our coaches are really good at keeping us competing with one another and keeping energy up and it’s important for us as captains to keep that up in the locker room. We can’t have anyone being negative in any way. We want to keep everyone focused on our main goal, winning the league, because that’s very much a possibility.” Honor Roll The following athletes either from the local area or who attend local colleges received awards for their performance over the past two weeks: Hopedale’s Theresa Pereira (Lesley, Women’s Tennis, NECC Rookie of the Week); Greg Peschel (Framingham State, Football, MASCAC Defensive Player of the Week); Alycia Rackliffe (Framingham State, Women’s Volleyball, MASCAC Player of the Week); Sudbury’s Will Twyman (Brown, Football, Ivy League Defensive Player of the Week); Framingham’s Rachel Wagner (Southern New Hampshire University, Women’s Tennis, Northeast-10 All-Conference).
