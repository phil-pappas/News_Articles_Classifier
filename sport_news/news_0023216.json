We really knew what we had to do on defense, and we took it personal what happened last week. So we did what we had to do to get the win.\" \nParkland needed to produce a bunch of stops to outlast the Red Rovers. The Trojans headed into the fourth quarter holding a 7-3 lead, a lead that came courtesy of a 17-play, 98-yard touchdown drive that bridged the first and second quarters. \nCross helped the Trojans pull further ahead with back-to-back big passes. He first hit Nick Suriel for a 26-yard gain before he hooked up with Yeboah for a 33-yard touchdown pass with 10:46 to go. \nFaces in the Crowd at Parkland v Easton football game Friday, October 16, 2015 (DONNA FISHER / THE MORNING CALL) \nCross and Yeboah connected again for a 5-yard touchdown pass on a fade with 1:46 left. That put the game out of reach and capped a big day for both players. \nCross made his verbal commitment to Boston College public via his Twitter account Friday morning. While he is slated to play cornerback when he joins the Eagles, his play at quarterback led Parkland on Friday night. He threw for 140 yards and three touchdowns, and also ran 23 times for 95 yards. \nYeboah finished with five catches for 59 yards. He also picked off two passes, playing his part in Parkland's big defensive night. \nDiGirolamo, Frank Guida, David Hohman, Marios Delis and Noel Brouse were among the other Parkland defenders who seemed to be around the ball all night. Easton averaged just 4.5 yards per play against the Trojans. \n\"That's what we talked about all week, that the defense was going to set the tone for this football game,\" Parkland coach Jim Morgans said. \"They did. They played the way they were capable of playing.\" \nEaston's execution was not on the same level as Parkland's. The Red Rovers committed 10 penalties for 70 yards in addition to their five giveaways. Many of their penalties came in crucial spots, leading to a loss that probably knocked them out of contention for the EPC South title. \nParkland's EPC South hopes remain in play. The Trojans trail division-leading Freedom by one game and host the Patriots next week. \nThey would love to repeat their defensive performance from Friday when they face Freedom. \n\"It showed that our team was a resilient team and we can bounce back after a loss and face adversity,\" Cross said. \"The defense came out here tonight with the mindset that, 'We have to stop them. This is going to be a defensive slugfest.' \n\"That's what it was, and we took it to them.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T05:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T06:23:50.651+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
