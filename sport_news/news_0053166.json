Dave Johnson Contact Reporter djohnson@dailypress.com In its last three games, Hampton University's defense is allowing only 3.7 yards per play. \nHAMPTON — Oddly enough, the first sign came in a 45-31 loss to North Carolina A&T on Oct. 3. You'd never guess it from the score, but Hampton University's defense played pretty well that day. \nTwo of A&T's touchdowns came on returns — one punt, one fumble recovery. The Aggies' four touchdown drives covered a combined 73 yards with three of them starting inside the HU 15. \nA&T had more yards in punt returns (203) than it did from scrimmage (187), which is how the Aggies handed the Pirates their most-lopsided loss of the season. \nBut that day sparked a turnaround in HU's defense, which has played three solid games in row going into Saturday's trip to No. 16 William and Mary. In that stretch, the Pirates have allowed 240 total yards a game — and 3.7 yards per snap. \nIn the last eight quarters, HU's defense has scored more touchdowns (two, both on fumble recovery returns) than it's allowed (one). \n\"Our defense is playing lights-out, and that's been keeping us in games,\" Pirates quarterback David Watford said. \"When we can't move the ball or we're making too many mistakes, our defense will come back. \n\"Like against Delaware State, they had a scoop-and-score. Against Morgan State, a scoop-and-score. They help us out.\" \nHU (4-3) played its best defensive game of the season in Saturday's 20-10 win over Morgan State. The Bears came in averaging 30 points and 230 rushing yards a game in their three MEAC wins. Against HU, all they got was a field goal (along with a punt return for a touchdown) and 108 yards on the ground. \n\"Really, the defense as a whole has come together,\" said freshman defensive end Darien Williams, who had five tackles behind the line of scrimmage Saturday. \"It's a bond. Everybody's on the same page.

We take that to full advantage and try to do our best every time we step on the field.\" \nMichael Ketchum, HU's defensive coordinator, sees player development as also making a difference. \n\"We've had two freshmen, Darien Williams from Tallwood and Devan Johnson from Georgia, who have started playing quite a bit,\" he said. \"That's given us more rest at our linebacker position, which is really nice. \n\"And we've avoided injuries. As the season goes on, if you can avoid injuries, you're likely getting better when other people aren't.\" \nHU will have its toughest test yet on Saturday against W&M, which has scored 72 points in its last two games — both wins against ranked teams. The Tribe (4-2) has proven runners in Kendell Anderson (705 yards) and Mikal Abdul-Saboor (386), a quarterback (Steve Cluley) who has thrown 144 consecutive passes without an interception, and an offensive line that has been exceptional. \n\"The key for them is their offensive line and giving those guys room to run,\" Hampton coach Connell Maynor said. \"We've got to do it up front, get some penetration, get off the blocks, and don't let those guys get started. Get them before they get 4, 5 yards down the field.\" \nSaturday is homecoming at Zable Stadium, as it was last week at Morgan State. And as it will be next week at South Carolina State. That's right, HU has been scheduled as the homecoming opponent in three consecutive weeks. \n\"We're taking it personal,\" running back Chris Dukes said. \"We're using that for motivation to play good, sound football.\" \nNOTES: HU is 2-14 all-time against the CAA, including a 31-28 loss to Richmond in week two. The Pirates are 0-5 against William and Mary and lost 42-14 at Armstrong. … HU hasn't had four wins after seven games since 2011, which also was its last winning season. … Watford has thrown at least one touchdown pass in each of HU's seven games this season. … Hampton has outscored the opposition 117-62 in the first half but has been outscored 94-67 in the second. … HU is giving up an average of 23.2 yards per punt return. \nJohnson can be reached by phone at 757-247-4649. \nNEXT GAME \nWHO: Hampton (4-3) at No. 16 William and Mary (4-2). \nWHEN: 3:30 p.m. Saturday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T23:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T01:50:39.311+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
