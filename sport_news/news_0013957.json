MMAWeekly.com confirmed the news with multiple independent sources after MMAJunkie.com first reported the change. \nThe 33 year-old is now ranked No. 3 in the official heavyweight rankings after winning three of his last four fights, so this fight had potential title implications in the division, though he himself had recently admitted that he'd probably \"need to get more popular\" before the UFC would hand him a title shot. \nThe fight card should draw well in an MMA-starved Dublin. \nPrior to this performance, Miocic suffered a heart-breaking decision loss to former champion Junior dos Santos following their thrilling back-and-forth war in main event of UFC on FOX 13 in December. \nThere are just 11 days to go but the UFC are still hopeful that Rothwell will stay on the card, with a replacement for Miocic being sought at the moment. \nMiocic has only fought once this year, during which he broke a UFC record by striking Mark Hunt 361 times en route to claiming a TKO victory in the fifth round at UFC Fight Night 65 in May.
