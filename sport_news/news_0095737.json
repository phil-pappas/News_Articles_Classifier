Not to take anything away from Cincinnati, as they’ve been very good, but better teams than it have entered The Ralph as road favourites before leaving with an undesired result. We also catch Cincy in a sandwich spot after a jubilant win over Seattle and with a trip to Pittsburgh on deck. Bengals are away after two at home and they’ve covered only one of past five in this situation. The Bills have some hurts, including QB Tyrod Taylor, but a marginal drop off to EJ Manuel is not enough to deter us from this strong home side. \nTAKING: BILLS +3.5 \nTexans (1-4) at Jaguars (1-4) \nLINE: JACKSONVILLE by 1 \nMaking a case for the Jaguars has its challenges. Luckily, we don’t have to for this one as all we need to do is fade the inept Texans. If Houston isn’t receiving a bunch of points, we’re simply not interested. Bill O’Brien continues to flip flop his quarterbacks. Brian Hoyer is the preferred choice this week. He is likely more capable than Ryan Mallett, but that’s equivalent to Curly being more capable than Moe. Granted, the Jaguars don’t win much, but we do see improvements. QB Blake Bortles has talent. The young quarterback will have key off-season acquisition TE Julius Thomas starting his first game after returning to action last week after a pre-season injury. Jacksonville has been traveling for three consecutive weeks. They return home where they won their last game. No reason they can’t do same here. \nTAKING: JAGUARS –1 \nBears (2-3) at Lions (0-5) \nLINE: DETROIT by 3 \nWhy spot points with the only winless team in the NFL? If they win and cover, good luck to them, but they don’t deserve our endorsement. QB Matthew Stafford’s mental makeup has to be questioned after being pulled in last week’s whipping by Cardinals. Stafford has just six touchdown passes on the season compared to eight interceptions. While his play has been subpar, a weak offensive line has not protected him well and also failing to allow for a run game. The Lions are currently dead last in rushing, averaging a measly 48.8 yards per game, which is 21 yards per game below the 31st-ranked team. The Bears are showing some fight and against a familiar foe, they should compete throughout in this one. \nTAKING: BEARS +4 \nCardinals (4-1) at Steelers (3-2) \nLINE: ARIZONA by 3.5 \nBacking the Cardinals over the past couple of seasons has provided a second income for some. Arizona is now 15-6 against the spread since the beginning of 2014, continually cashing in at these small prices. Bucking the trend may not seem wise, but sometimes situations dictate the more prudent way to go. Spotting road points and covering in consecutive weeks is demanding. Beating up on the Lions in Detroit last week is much different than accomplishing the same here. The Steelers are loaded with talented players. Even with backup QB Michael Vick forced into action, Pittsburgh has won two of three while losing in overtime to rival Ravens. The Men of Steel have also been money makers, currently on a 7-0-2 run dating back to last season. \nTAKING: STEELERS +3.5 \nDolphins (1-4) at Titans (1-4) \nLINE: TENNESSEE by 2 \nDo we throw all of Miami’s woes out the window simply because it hired a new coach and other staff? Seems the wait and see approach might be best as the Fish had issues outside of their awful work ethic. The team has been plagued by poor play up front on the offensive side. Miami ranks 28th in total offence and 31st in rushing. QB Ryan Tannehill is rarely afforded time to pass and the ground game is not being afforded chances. These things take time to fix. The Titans aren’t exactly a team to fear but they’ll have the luxury of being home for a third consecutive week while their guests return from a trip to England. A home win seems in order. \nTAKING: TITANS –2 \nPanthers (4-0) at Seahawks (2-3) \nLINE: SEATTLE by 7 \nIt’s not often you get to take a full touchdown with an undefeated and rested team facing a sub .500 club. We’re not proud. We’ll gladly accept. Anyone that’s seen the Seahawks this year knows that they are not the same powerful team we’ve witnessed over the past two seasons. They’re good, just not that good. Not blowout good. The offence seems to consist mainly of a Russell Wilson scramble and improvised plays. The Seachickens clearly have not utilized TE Jimmy Graham properly as they expect Graham to be as much a blocker as receiver but that’s not his thing. The Panthers play a similar style to Seattle, relying on a strong defence and an athletic quarterback to make plays. Matching up well, there’s little reason to believe that either team pulls away from the other. \nTAKING: PANTHERS +7 \nChargers (2-3) at Packers (5-0) \nLINE: GREEN BAY by 10.5 \nUnless you’ve been under a rock, you know how dominant the Packers have been at home. We won’t get into it other than to say they are near unbeatable at Lambeau Field. However, no team is bulletproof including this Green Bay bunch. They’ll likely win but there are an abundance of points being offered here. While QB Aaron Rodgers is co-best quarterback in the league, no pivot brings more game than Philip Rivers. The veteran thrower leads the NFL in passing yards with 1,613 to go along with an incredible 71.3% completion rate. It’s not often you can take double-digits with a quarterback possessing those kind of credentials. While the Chargers are flying west on a short week, they’ve been profitable following a Monday nighter, covering seven of past eight. \nTAKING: CHARGERS +10.5 \nRavens (1-4) at 49ers (1-4) \nLINE: BALTIMORE by 2.5 \nDidn’t these two just meet in the Super Bowl? A quick three seasons later, it looks as if both team’s best football is in the rear view mirror. Despite equally inept records, we’re more inclined to lean to the visitor here. Baltimore has blown four 4th quarter leads in its losses. Most of it due to the inability to stop the pass. That threat barely exists with the Niners, a team averaging just 178 yards per game threw the air, good for 31st overall. Before last Sunday night’s loss at the Giants, San Fran had been outscored by a combined 107-28 in a three-game skid. The Niners aren’t rolling over but at a short price, we have more confidence in John Harbaugh’s group than we do in a rookie head coach’s. \nTAKING: RAVENS –2.5 \nPatriots (5-0) at Colts (3-2) \nLINE: NEW ENGLAND by 9.5 \nThe Colts may act like world-beaters against AFC South teams but against a team like the Patriots, they are mere fodder. Indianapolis’ three wins have come against the Texans, Titans and Jaguars. Facing teams from New England’s division, the Colts lost to both Buffalo and the Jets — both with Andrew Luck at quarterback, both by double digits. Barely squeezing by Blake Bortles, Ryan Mallett and rookie Marcus Mariota, the Colts now get Tom Brady. Deflategate stemmed from a playoff game between these two. The Pats are angry. Indy can’t do anything about it. This is a weaker version of the Colts than in previous years. If the last four scores between these two were 45-7, 42-20, 43-22 and 59-24, all in New England’s favour, you may want to shield the kids from seeing this one. \nTAKING: PATRIOTS -9.5 \nGiants (2-3) at Eagles (0-5) \nLINE: PHILADLEPHIA by 4 \nTiming might be right for the Eagles as the Giants appear to be reduced to mere gnomes with their myriad of injuries. Still, not anxious to give away these points with a Philadelphia team that has had more than its fair share of struggles. Beating up on a leaky Saints defence does not suddenly give the Eagles credibility. QB Sam Bradford has been as shaky as the leaves on the trees while counterpart Eli Manning is having a standout season, ranking among the top throwers in the league. The G-Men were embarrassed in here last season to the tune of 27-0 in a Sunday prime-timer. That’s not supposed to happen within this division as the disparity between first and worst is marginal. Look for some payback. \nTAKING: GIANTS +4", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T02:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T04:08:33.686+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
