Tyrod Taylor (knee) tried to convince coaches, but not ready. \n— bob holtzman (@BobHoltzmanESPN) October 17, 2015 \nTaylor suffered a sprained MCL on a horse-collar tackle in last weekend’s win over the Tennessee Titans. There were reports earlier this week that he could miss multiple games because of the injury, and that the Bills were checking the passport status of possible backups with a trip to London looming next weekend. \nManuel, who lost the Bills’ quarterback competition to Taylor in training camp, received most of the reps with the first-team offense during practice this week. He has started 14 games over his three-year NFL career, with 16 career touchdown passes and 12 interceptions. After spending the first 17 years of his Post career writing and editing, Matt and the printed paper had an amicable divorce in 2014. He's now blogging and editing for the Early Lead and the Post's other Web-based products. sports Success! Check your inbox for details.
