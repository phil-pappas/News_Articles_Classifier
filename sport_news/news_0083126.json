(AP) - Randy Edsall has been fired as Maryland's football coach after the team's third straight lopsided defeat. \nThe dismissal, announced Sunday, comes in the middle of Edsall's fifth season with the Terrapins. Maryland is 2-4 and mired in a three-game skid in which the Terps have been outscored by a combined 122-34. Including an earlier defeat against Bowling Green, Maryland's four losses have come by an average of four touchdowns. \nOffensive coordinator Mike Locksley will take over on an interim basis. Maryland has a bye this week before facing Penn State in Baltimore on Oct. 24. \nEdsall went 22-34 after taking over for Ralph Freidgen before the 2011 season. He accepted the job after going 74-70 in 12 years at Connecticut. \nRumors of Edsall's dismissal began last week, shortly before Maryland lost 49-28 to No. 1 Ohio State on Saturday.
