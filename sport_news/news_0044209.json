I'm going to have to give it a bigger, 'You don't have Romo.'\" \nWeeden's best moment in three starts for the Cowboys, including one last season, was a tying 17-yard touchdown pass to Terrance Williams in the final 2 minutes. \nBut he never got a chance to have the next breakthrough — a victory — because Brees never let Weeden get the ball again. \nHis most recent win as a starter was Dec. 9, 2012, against Kansas City in his rookie season with Cleveland, where he spent two seasons after getting drafted in the first round. \n\"I've had my face beat in but I'm there Wednesday ready to go,\" said Weeden, who has just 23 starts despite turning 32 next week because he spent five years in pro baseball before playing at Oklahoma State. \n\"Maybe that goes back to baseball, but I have a pretty short memory. I wasn't blessed with much, but I was blessed with a short memory.\" \nWeeden will get at least one more start Sunday against the Patriots (3-0). But the Cowboys have at least four more games following their bye without Romo, who broke his left collarbone in a Week 2 win over Philadelphia. \nDallas traded for Matt Cassel after Romo's injury, and he's getting closer to taking over the backup role from Kellen Moore, who hasn't played in a regular-season game. Cassel had 71 starts over seven seasons with New England, Kansas City and Minnesota. \nCoach Jason Garrett called Weeden after the trade to tell him the coaching staff was behind him, and Garrett hasn't hinted at any erosion in that support. \n\"He has a great demeanor about him,\" Garrett said. \"He works hard trying to understand what we are trying to do each week. He's engaged with his teammates. He has handled all aspects of it really, really well.\" \nWeeden isn't showing any strain from the scrutiny of several weeks as the Cowboys' starter — rather than just the one week a year ago in a loss to Arizona when Romo had a back injury. \n\"I do a good job of blocking everything out,\" he said. \"Is there pressure that comes with this position? Shoot yeah. It's the most pressure-packed position in all of sports. It's backing up Derek Jeter when he was in New York. That's about as big as it gets. \n\"If you let that pressure build on you and think about it worrying you, there's no way you can go out and function on Sunday.\" \nOh, and for anybody wondering, he quit paying attention to Twitter when he was a rookie with the Browns. \n\"I remember the people that talked ... never had a picture of themselves,\" Weeden said. \"It was some cartoon or something, and it was always probably a 12-year-old kid who never played quarterback. I'm 32 years old. I don't need a 12-year-old telling me how to play quarterback.\" \nAnd he's not worried about his owner calling him \"limited.\" \nOnline: \nAP NFL website: http://www.pro32.ap.org and http://www.twitter.com/AP_NFL \nFollow Schuyler Dixon on Twitter at https://twitter.com/apschuyler \nAll content copyright ©2015 Pendleton Times-Post, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T02:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T03:24:30.420+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
