German lawyer Elmar Giemulla told the dpa news agency on Sunday that 100 of his clients from 39 families gave him the go-ahead to pursue legal action in the U.S. at a Saturday meeting. Prosecutors believe the Airbus A320 was intentionally crashed by its co-pilot, killing all 150 people on board the Germanwings Barcelona to Duesseldorf flight. Lufthansa has offered around 100,000 euros ($108,000) per family, depending on its size. Giemulla says the offer is far too low. Giemulla says he will talk again with Lufthansa before filing any suit.
