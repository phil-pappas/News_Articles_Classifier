It feels great (to be back on the PGA Tour).\n\"It's been a while and I've put a lot of hard work in. I'm just looking forward to what's to come.\"\nAmerican world number five Rickie Fowler, the highest-ranked player in the field, opened with a one-over 72 on Thursday, but bounced back with a 65 that featured an 80-foot putt for eagle at the 13th to move within six shots of the lead.\n\"It's nice to have a tee time tomorrow,\" Fowler said after ensuring he would make the cut.\n\"I didnâ€™t hit the center of the (club) face a whole lot yesterday. (Today I) made a couple of good swings, got things going, made a few putts.\"\nBig-hitting compatriot Finau had the shot of the day when he holed out with his second shot from 235 yards at the par-five 13th.\nFinau was not far away from a second albatross two holes later when he drove the green at the par-four 15th where his ball landed a few feet left of the pin.\nHe birdied the hole, but double-bogeyed the next and, with one hole left, will miss the cut unless he birdies the 18th hole on Saturday morning.\n(Reporting by Mark Lamport-Stokes in Los Angeles; and Andrew Both in Cary, North Carolina; Editing by Ian Ransom )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T06:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T06:41:49.586+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
