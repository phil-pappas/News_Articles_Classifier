It's good to get past this obstacle and move forward.\" \nWilliams' 16-14 win over Bates was the Ephs second-ever win at Farley-Lamb Field, and their first win on home turf since beating Bowdoin in the 2014 season opener. \n\"Any time you win, it always feels good,\" Williams coach Aaron Kelton said. \"Our business is about trying to be perfect all the time. \n\"It feels great, but when you watch the film it was like, man we left a lot of plays on the field and didn't execute the way we wanted to.\" \nBut it's back on the road Saturday for the Ephs, who will board buses for an early-morning foliage drive to Vermont. The Ephs will play at Middlebury in a battle of 2-1 teams. \n\"I think this is a pivotal game for us,\" said the senior linebacker. \"I think we can build off this momentum and carry it into Middlebury.\" \nWilliams will have an opportunity to break another streak on Saturday. The Panthers have won the last three games against Williams, two of them coming in Williamstown. \nMiddlebury lost its first game of the season last week, as 3-0 Amherst scored a 24-7 win. The Panthers gave up three unanswered touchdowns against the Lord Jeffs. Advertisement \nThe Panthers throw the ball extremely well. Matt Milano is the top quarterback in NESCAC and No. 2 in passing efficiency. Two of Milano's receivers, Conrado Banky and Ryan Rizzo, are in the top 10 of receiving yards per game \nThe last win against Bob Ritter's Panthers came in 2011. In that game Marco Hernandez ran for 133 yards and Tom Wohlwender added 122 yards in a 48-28 win. \nLast week against Bates, the Ephs had 46 yards in net rushing yardage out of 355 yards in total offense. The Williams head coach said that while he might not expect to see 255 yards rushing out of two backs, he does want to see the ground game get better. \n\"We just have to be more consistent,\" he said. \"We have to have a better balance. Then I think we'll be able to score more points. \n\"We've got to do a better job of running the football.\" \nOne thing Williams has done well in two out of three games is throw the ball. \nSenior quarterback Austin Lommen is fourth in NESCAC in passing. He has completed 65-of-105 passes for 687 yards, three touchdowns and four interceptions. He was 31 of 47 for 309 yards, a touchdown and two picks against Bates. \nAnd because of Lommen's passing, senior wide receiver Darrias Sime is tied for third in the conference in receiving. Sime has caught 17 passes for 158 yards and a touchdown. He is only five catches behind league leader Nick Vallas of Bowdoin. \n\"I definitely think a lot of opportunities have opened up, especially in our passing game,\" said Sime. \"It's definitely nice, as a receiver, to get more touches and see the ball spread around amongst the guys.\" \nWilliams has been in the middle of the pack offensively all year. Through three weeks, the Ephs are seventh in the conference in scoring offense, seventh in passing offense and seventh in rushing offense. Sime said that it has been a little frustrating to leave chances on the field. \n\"We want to capitalize on every opportunity we have, especially in the red zone,\" said Sime. \"While 16 points isn't a lot, we're happy to take them and we're looking forward to taking advantage of more opportunities.\" \nContact Howard Herman at 413-496-6253.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T06:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T10:29:34.294+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
