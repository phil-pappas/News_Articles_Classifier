It was rolling backward at a low rate of speed, away from the crash site in the area of Singleton and Williams roads, according to Gwinnett County police.\nOne officer even chased the moving ambulance Sunday night, and that’s when he realized there was man in the driver’s seat, Channel 2 Action News reported.\nThe man, later identified as Brandon Demarcus Moore, allegedly drove the ambulance backward down a hill, somehow missing pedestrians and other vehicles, according to police. Officers were able to use their patrol cars to block the ambulance, which left the road and crashed into a brick sign.\nBrandon Demarcus Moore (Gwinnett County Sheriff’s Office) Moore allegedly refused officers’ orders to exit the ambulance, so officers broke the driver’s side window of the vehicle. When Moore got out, officers were shocked at what he was wearing. Rollerblades.\nMoore allegedly kicked the officers with the rollerblades before officers got him to the ground and removed them. He told officers he was part of the “recon unit” of the fire department, according to police.\nOnce free of rollerblades, Moore was arrested and charged with theft by taking, interference with government property, entering an auto and obstruction, Gwinnett jail records showed. At the time of his arrest, Moore was on probation for a prior arrest, booking records showed. He was being held without bond Thursday night.", "external_links": ["http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/img/photos/2015/10/15/ac/c9/Moore.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-15T15:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T03:01:13.198+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
