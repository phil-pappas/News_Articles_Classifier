The Better Oregon campaign , as it's called, has set its sights on real money.\nAccording to the Legislative Revenue Office (LRO), the Better Oregon measure can be expected to raise $2.65 billion a year, amounting to a 26 percent increase in state general fund revenues. \"I don't know of anything of that magnitude\" that has ever been enacted in Oregon, says LRO's Paul Warner. And yet, early polling shows it's supported by a strong majority of Oregon voters.\nThis is labor's long-awaited opportunity to reverse the erosion of business tax effort in Oregon that began with the passage of the property tax limitation measures in the 1990s. Real money of this magnitude will enable the state to fully fund its aspirational Quality Education Model for K-12 schools and pay bills coming due for PERS and Medicaid. And yet it looks like a nominally small tax on large corporations, set at 2.5 percent of a company's sales of goods and services in Oregon that exceed $25 million a year. What's not to like in all of this for progressive voters who will dominate the turnout in a Presidential election year?\nThat depends on questions yet to be answered about who will ultimately pay this tax, its disparate impact across industries, its lack of offsetting adjustments and exemptions and how the money it raises will be spent.\nWho pays: Some taxes are absorbed by the owners or shareholders of a business; some are passed on to consumers. A sales tax levied on consumer purchases is clearly in the latter category. So too is a tax paid by businesses based on their sales to consumers. That's because it's a tax on business receipts, not profits, which makes it less easily absorbed by owners and shareholders.\nHow much of the Better Oregon tax would be passed on to consumers? We don't know – yet. LRO is updating its analytic models to capture the pass through effects of business taxes in different industries. And Warner reminded me that taxes of this type have a compounding effect, as they are imposed at each step of a process that may include the sale of raw materials to a manufacturer, the sale of a finished product to a wholesaler and its final sale to a consumer. In the Better Oregon measure, that could generate a cumulative tax impact on the final transaction in the range of 4 percent to 8 percent, depending on whether half or as much as all of the tax impacts were embedded in the consumer price.\nDisparate impacts: Not all Oregon sales are treated equally in the state tax code. Oregon corporations that provide services, such as software, accounting or engineering, have their transactions counted as Oregon sales, even when they are serving customers in other states. Those that sell tangible goods such as groceries and appliances get to log their sales where they occur. Large Oregon exporters of tangible products will pay the tax on a tiny portion of their overall sales. Those providing services will pay the tax on 100 percent of their sales.\nLack of offsets: Most big revenue-raising measures in the past have included offsetting reductions in other areas of the tax code, such as tax relief for low-income families, homeowners and renters. Sales tax proposals have invariably exempted food and medicine. But the Better Oregon measure provides no such offsets or exemptions.\nSpending: The Better Oregon measure commits all of its new revenue to education (through grade 12), healthcare and senior services. But petitioners are already claiming that money can be moved around to help higher education, and the Better Oregon website claims that the measure will enable \"investments in core infrastructure.\" Ultimately, it will be up to the Legislature to decide how the money is spent or given back in tax breaks.\nBetter Oregon's measure could be better. But polling shows it may be good enough for voters on first impression, while opponents vow to make sure every voter takes a second look. This could be another scorched earth battle ending in an all-too-familiar status quo. Alternatives to that scenario will require leadership, negotiation and compromise on both sides – which may be the best way to realize real money for a better Oregon.\nTim Nesbitt writes on public affairs, has served as an adviser to Governors Ted Kulongoski and John Kitzhaber, and is past president of the Oregon AFL-CIO.
