Families made the drive all the way downtown to pick up their Astros postseason gear. \n\"Go Astros! What more can you ask for?\" said Ramirez. \"This is our team, our guys in our backyard, yay!\" said Torrez. \"We're coming.\" \nThe postseason t-shirts are selling fast and that has the folks at Trademarks working overtime to meet demand. They're printing 700 shirts an hour. \n\"Thousands and thousands,\" said Todd Longenecker. \"We're going to be here all night long.\" \nIt'd been a while since they had fired up these printers for the hometown team. \n\"Much better,\" said Longenecker. \"I've had to print for the Mavericks before and that made me sick to my stomach.\" \nBut now it's all about the Astros as they get ready for that first postseason match up of 2015, a wild card battle with the New York Yankees in the big apple. \n\"There's going to be so much emotion,\" said Torrez. \"I still got chicken skin on my arms and legs. They're playing with house money and they're winning.\" \nThat game is scheduled for Tuesday at 7 p.m. on ESPN.
