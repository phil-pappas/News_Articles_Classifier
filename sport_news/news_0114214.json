Tanev took a pass from Alex Burrows and beat Petr Mrazek through the screen for his first goal of the season. Ben Hutton drew the second assist on the goal for his fourth point of the year.\nVancouver doubled the lead at the 8:02 mark of the second period with a very similar goal to their first one. Burrows sent a pass into the slot for Sutter, who snapped home his third goal to make it 2-0.\nDetroit was outshot 23-11 through 40 minutes but quickly got back on track in the third period. Teemu Pulkkinen cut the deficit in half by beating Ryan Miller five-hole on a breakaway at the 4:25 mark, and then 2:34 after that, Tomas Tatar scored on the powerplay to tie the game.\nDaniel Sedin took a penalty just 13 seconds into overtime, but the Canucks were able to kill it off to give themselves a chance to score the winner. The teams traded chances before Nyquist beat Miller with a quick shot from the left side to give Detroit the extra point.\nThe Canucks have lost the first four games of their five-game homestand and are now 0-2-3 at Rogers Arena this season. Vancouver finishes the homestand on Tuesday against the Montreal Canadiens, who have won all nine of their games this season in regulation.\nCanucks | hockey | Local Sports | nhl", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T05:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T23:56:52.472+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
