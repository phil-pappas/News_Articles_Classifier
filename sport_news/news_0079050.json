Powell was run over during a kickoff. And with top kicker Austin Hardin also dealing with a leg injury, coach Jim McElwain has few, if any, other options on his roster. \nSo Florida took to Twitter “looking for walk-on kickers.” The team asked for any interested and eligible students to visit the football office by 4:30 p.m. Monday for a tryout. \nThe good news for the Gators (6-1, 4-1 Southeastern Conference) is they are off this week before playing rival Georgia (5-2, 3-2) in Jacksonville on Halloween. So they have extra time to get healthy or get a walk-on up to speed.  //on.flatoday.com/1RT7tuo TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T16:27:01.916+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
