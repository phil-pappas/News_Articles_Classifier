I've been playing in an era where we are very lucky and we appreciate that as footballers. \n\"Most of us come from council estates and working class. You have an opportunity to lead a good life and finances are not going to be a problem for me. That wasn't an issue for me coming here.\" \nEx-Chelsea and West Ham star Cole has played just once for Villa this season and has made just three league starts in 16 appearances since joining on a two-year deal in 2014. \nAnd Cole, who became a father for a third time on Sunday, revealed he dropped down to the third tier because he wants to play again. \n\"I just want to play football, regardless of the level, proper football, competitive football. I want to play for the right time and the right manager who plays the right way. I'm just excited to play a game,\" he said. \n\"I'm sure once I get the cobwebs off I'll be back to myself and looking forward to it. \n\"I've not really thought about the ideal scenario. One thing I have learnt is you only think of the next game. \n\"I know it's boring but anything could happen. I'm just excited I've got a game to play tomorrow. There's seven games in the 35 days and we'll review it after then.\" \nCoventry boss Tony Mowbray added: \"He came to us, it's not something I went chasing. The boy wants to play football and he still has part of his illustrious career to go.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T16:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T20:16:44.308+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
