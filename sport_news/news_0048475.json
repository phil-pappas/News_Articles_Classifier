It blew it vs. Florida. It blew it early against Arkansas. On Saturday, Tennessee was the team roaring back from a deficit ... and watching the other team blow it.\nGeorgia couldn't hang on to a three-touchdown first-half lead and Reggie Davis let a potential game-tying touchdown bounce off his hands late in the fourth quarter, opening the door to a 38-31 Volunteers win that will dramatically ease the pressure on the embattled Butch Jones.\nIn a game that will be widely remembered for Nick Chubb's serious knee injury on the game's opening play from scrimmage , Davis's 75-yard punt return for a touchdown gave the Bulldogs a 24-3-point lead in the second quarter. But aided by a Georgia fumble on a kickoff return, Tennessee scored two quick touchdowns before halftime to cut the lead to 24-17.\nWith the game tied 31-31 and under six minutes to play, quarterback Josh Dobbs -- the Vols' leading rusher with 118 yards -- powered in from 5 yards out for the winning touchdown. Georgia's last-gasp drive moved from its own 1 to the Tennessee 23, but the Bulldogs' final throw to the end zone fell incomplete.\nThe win ends the Vols' three-game losing streak against FBS teams and evens their record at 3-3, while Georgia drops to 4-2 -- and in a season in which it was widely expected to return to Atlanta, just 2-2 in the SEC. \nHere's how Tennessee made it happen:\n1. Josh Dobbs was the best player on the field. Dobbs has been far from perfect this season, particularly down the stretch of the Vols' series of agonizing losses. But he shone against the Bulldogs, hitting 25-of-42 for 312 yards and three touchdowns in the air, and adding 118 yards and two massive touchdowns on the ground. He's still going to have the occasional clunker by QB rating, but Jones and first-year play-caller Mike Debord let Dobbs get more aggressive throwing down the field, and the move paid dividends both in the passing game and in opening up more space for Dobbs in the rushing department.\n2. Georgia's defense wasn't good enough. The Bulldogs were much better in the explosiveness department, averaging 7.2 yards per-play to Tennessee's 5.8 and getting long touchdowns out of both their defense and special teams. But the Vols hadn't scored more than 27 points in three tries against FBS opponents, and they finished with a massive 26-to-15 advantage in first downs and a 512-438 edge in total yardage. With the game on the line, the Bulldogs allowed a Tennessee offense that had been dreadful in the second half all season to go 78 yards in eight plays for the deciding touchdown. \nGeorgia defensive coordinator Jeremy Pruitt has has some success since taking over for Todd Grantham in 2014. But he's had his whiffs, too, and given his unit's talent and the Vols' struggles entering this game -- particularly when throwing the ball -- this has to go down as a massive failure. \n3. Butch Jones got aggressive. Arguably the biggest drive of the game came late in the second quarter, when the Vols faced 4th-and-4 at the Georgia 47 ... and converted. Then they faced fourth-and-8 on the Georgia 39 ... and converted with a 39-yard touchdown pass to cut Georgia's lead to 24-10. One fumbled Georgia kickoff later, Tennessee had put a second touchdown on the board and what looked like a sizable halftime deficit was just one score.\nJones has been widely criticized for being too conservative with the Vols' leads; perhaps it helped that he finally had to get desperate enough to become a more aggressive game manager? \n4. The fourth-quarter breaks finally went the Vols' way. However big of a role the Vols played in their own demises recently, it still takes a certain amount of ill fortune to blow three 13-point leads in four weeks. And it looked like nothing was going to change when Leonard Floyd returned a fumble 96 yards for a first-quarter Georgia score.\nBut in the fourth quarter, the Vols first saw a perfect throw by Greyson Lambert bounce off of Davis's hands with nothing but the end zone in front of him, then watched Trevor Daniel's punt on the Vols' ensuing possession bounce sideways out of bounds at the 1. Both were tremendous strokes of luck that had an enormous impact on the game's outcome, and if you're a Vols fan, after Jones' previous run of one-possession losses there's not much else to say other than \"It's about time.\" \nJosh Dobbs led Tennessee to a must-have win.
