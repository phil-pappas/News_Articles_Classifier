Meyer ) \nThe Raiders turned it over on downs on their ensuing possession, watching a 13-play drive end when a fourth-and-19 screen pass to Marcel Reece netted just 4 yards. \nOakland pulled within 16-10 with 1:40 to go when Janikowski made a 50-yard field goal. The Raiders sent him out there for the kick right after getting a 48-yard pass interference call on Denver. \nThe game's fate was left up to the onside kick, and Demaryius Thomas easily fielded the kick to secure the Broncos' win. \nThe Raiders lost despite keeping Peyton Manning out of the end zone and intercepting him twice, both by veteran safety Charles Woodson. They were Woodson's first interceptions in nine career meetings with Manning and give him 64 for his career, tying him with Ed Reed for sixth on the all-time list.

Two plays later, with the offensive line giving Carr loads of time, he hit a wide open Clive Walford for a 33-yard gain that reached the Denver 3. On second-and-goal, the Raiders used play action to perfection and Carr flipped a 3-yard touchdown pass to fullback Reece. \nThe Broncos threatened to take the lead late in the first half, navigating their way to the Oakland 9. A 41-yard pass from Manning to Bennie Fowler was the big play in the sequence. \nBut on third-and-5 from the 9, Malcolm Smith pressured Manning with a blitz and rookie linebacker Neiron Ball had good coverage on tight end Owen Daniels, who never tracked the ball, and it was intercepted in the end zone by Woodson.

( Nhat V. Meyer ) \nDenver's Von Miller made a big defensive play of his own early in the third quarter when he blew past Austin Howard and sacked Carr, forcing a fumble that he recovered. But the Raiders defense steadied and limited the Broncos to a 20-yard field goal by McManus. The Broncos took the lead a possession later with a 52-yard field goal by McManus. \nThe Raiders seized some momentum late in the third quarter when Woodson picked off Manning again. Manning tried to target Thomas, and Woodson flew over the top to make the leaping interception. \nOakland drove to within field goal range, but Janikowski missed again, this time going wide left on a 40-yard kick.
