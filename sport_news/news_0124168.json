Is today the day the University of Massachusetts football team finally gets into the win column? As far as I'm concerned, they'd better . If UMass can't beat Florida International at home, well... I'm not sure how well that bodes for the team's overall prospects this season. \nKickoff is set for 3 p.m. No television option this week, so I'm hoping many of you will decide to join us right here for all the action. \nBelow, you can follow along with our updating live blog as we take you through the afternoon with my real-time Twitter updates that will appear in the comment section below. \nBe sure to join in on the discussion!
