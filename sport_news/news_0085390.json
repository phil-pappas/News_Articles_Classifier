When empty, it can compress fully for easy storage, NASA said.\n\"The simplest tasks on Earth can be quite challenging, and even dangerous, in space,\" said Niki Werkheiser, NASA's In-Space Manufacturing project manager.\n\"Being able to 3-D print technical parts, as well as the lifestyle items that we use every day will not only help enable deep space travel, but can make the trip more pleasant for astronauts,\" he said.\nNASA, in partnership with the American Society of Mechanical Engineers Foundation, which managed the competition, announced the winners of the Future Engineers 3-D Space Container Challenge yesterday.\nThe winning designs focused on making life in space a little more comfortable for astronauts, NASA said.\nThe 3-D Space Container Challenge asked students to design models of containers that could be used in space.\nThey could range from simple containers that could be used to hold collected rocks on Mars or an astronaut's food, to advanced containers for experiments that study fruit flies.\nStudents across the US spent part of their summer using 3-D modelling software to design containers that could be 3-D printed, with the ultimate goal of advancing human space exploration on the International Space Station, Mars and beyond. â€”PTI", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T08:16:01.100+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
