They'll make some evaluation and see where he is.\" \nLevy left the second quarter of Sunday's 42-17 loss to the Arizona Cardinals after aggravating the hip injury that sidelined him for nearly seven weeks. \nHe said after the game that he didn't think this injury was as bad as the strained muscle he suffered Aug. 24. But he was scheduled to visit with doctors today. \n\"I was feeling really good up until there was one play where I felt it tweak a little bit,\" Levy said. \"But up until that point, it felt good. It’s just something I got to keep managing. Hopefully, it’s not as bad -- it doesn’t feel as bad as the first time. But we'll see.\" \nThe Lions signed Levy, their leading tackler last year, to a four-year, $33-million contract extension in August that, at the time, made him the highest-paid 4-3 outside linebacker in the NFL. \nLevy suffered his injury about three weeks later, in a practice after the Lions' second exhibition. He went without a tackle in 17 snaps in his season debut Sunday. \nCaldwell said whatever decision the Lions make when it comes to Levy will be a medical one and won't have anything to do with simply protecting their investment. \n\"We look at every situation purely from a medical standpoint and what's best for the young man,\" Caldwell said. \"Can he function and perform and do his job, plain and simple?\" \nContact Dave Birkett at dbirkett@freepress.com.
