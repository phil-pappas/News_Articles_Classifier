Since Monday, the Dodgers , Cardinals and Blue Jays have officially clinched their divisions, leaving only home field advantage battles on the table in the National League. But in in the AL, the West and both wild-card spots remain in play, with the possibility of tiebreakers and Game 163—even 164—play-ins.
