In the first two quarters, led by the passing of Eli Manning and the powerful bursts up the middle by running back Andre Williams, the Giants had dominated the Buffalo Bills .\nBut near the midpoint of the fourth quarter, the Giants’ offense had been sputtering for more than an hour. The team’s defense had bailed out the offense on at least two occasions, with a goal-line stand and another stop at their own 10-yard line. But in the fourth quarter, the Bills had broken through to draw within 6 points of the Giants, reviving their loud home crowd.\nWithout a momentum-changing play, the Giants would be looking at a 1-3 record. But they were able to rescue their season with the kind of momentum-changing play they have missed in the fourth quarter.\n Jets 27, Dolphins 14: Jets Cross Atlantic and Cruise Past Miami Dolphins OCT. 4, 2015 Tyrod Taylor Goes from a Protégé to a Productive Quarterback OCT. 3, 2015 With Longer Kicks, Extra Points Lose the Dullness of Dead Certainty OCT. 3, 2015 N.F.L. Week 4 Scores and Highlights On a third down-and-3 from their own 49-yard line, Manning tossed a pass in the flat to running back Rashad Jennings, who deked past Buffalo linebacker Nigel Bradham to get to the sideline. He then eluded another would-be tackler and scampered downfield. Finally, Jennings burst past Bills safety Bacarri Rambo and jogged into the end zone with a 51-yard touchdown.\nContinue reading the main story NFL Week 4 Scores, highlights and analysis from this week’s games.\nDevonta Freeman's Three Touchdowns (Again) Lead Falcons to Victory Analysis: Giants Need to Keep Running the Ball Cousins Scores Accidental Rushing Touchdown for Redskins Jets Are 3-1 After Beating Dolphins in London Follow the latest NFL Week 4 scores on Facebook or Twitter or by email . A little pass, one that traveled no more than 7 yards in the air, became the score the Giants desperately sought, a game-clinching touchdown in a 24-10 victory. And the Giants, who began the season with two dispiriting losses after two fourth-quarter collapses, had pulled off an upset on the road and evened their record to 2-2.\nDown by 16-3 at the half, the Bills controlled the football for most of the third quarter. At one point, they held the ball for 13 successive plays, advancing from their own 31-yard line to the Giants’ 12-yard line. A big play in the Buffalo drive was a 28-yard defensive pass interference call against Giants cornerback Jayron Hosley. But the Bills also committed a costly penalty: a 36-yard touchdown scramble by Taylor was nullified by a holding penalty.\nWhen the Bills regrouped and advanced to the Giants’ 10-yard line, the Giants’ defense came up big again with defensive end Kerry Wynn slicing past two Buffalo lineman to corral Bills running back Karlos Williams in the backfield for a 7-yard loss.\nEventually, the Bills lined up for a 30-yard field goal. Buffalo place kicker Dan Carpenter missed the kick left of the uprights.\nPhoto Buffalo Bills running back Karlos Williams had little room to run against the Giants in the first half on Sunday. Credit Gary Wiepert/Associated Press The Giants’ defense made another stand early in the fourth quarter. The Bills had a third down at the 2-yard line when Buffalo quarterback Tyrod Taylor ran around the right end. Wynn chased after Taylor, knocking him out of bounds at the 1-yard line. Buffalo Coach Rex Ryan went for it on fourth down with Taylor throwing a swing pass to Williams, who was stopped short of the goal line by Dominque Rodgers-Cromartie and linebacker J.T. Thomas.\nThe Giants opened the scoring on their first drive of the game, something they did in their previous game, a victory over the Washington Redskins.\nThe Giants’ possession benefited from a defensive pass interference penalty, one of several penalties by the Bills in the first half. Manning also completed consecutive 8-yard passes to Odell Beckham Jr. When the drive stalled, Josh Brown kicked a 47-yard field goal to give the Giants a 3-0 lead.\nAdvertisement\nContinue reading the main story Advertisement\nContinue reading the main story Later in the first quarter, a 52-yard punt by Buffalo’s Colton Schmidt pinned the Giants back on their own 4-yard line. A running play lost yardage and Buffalo ended up with good field position after a poor punt by the Giants’ Brad Wing. A couple of effective runs by Karlos Williams led to a 51-yard field goal by Dan Carpenter which tied the score, 3-3.\nContinue reading the main story Sports Newsletter Get the big sports news, highlights and analysis from Times journalists, with distinctive takes on games and some behind-the-scenes surprises, delivered to your inbox every week.\nIn the final minutes of the first quarter, Giants linebacker Devon Kennard made a brilliant play, running along the sideline with Buffalo tight end Charles Clay and turning back to intercept a pass from Buffalo quarterback Tyrod Taylor.\nManning quickly threw to Dwayne Harris for 11 yards, and on the next play, fired a crisp pass into a narrow opening in the Bills’ defense over the middle for a 21-yard touchdown pass. Giants kicker Josh Brown missed his first extra point of the season when his attempt hit the right upright and deflected back onto the field.\nIn the second quarter, the Giants mounted one of their best drives of the season. Taking over at their own 24-yard line, the Giants offensive coordinator Ben McAdoo called a running play on three of the first four plays. Andre Williams gained 14 yards on two rushes and Rashad Jennings burst through the middle for a 14-yard run. At the end of that play, the Giants rookie tackle Ereck Flowers drew a 15-yard personal foul penalty on Buffalo defensive end Jerry Hughes.\nThen it was back to the run. When the drive appeared to stall at the Bills’ 34-yard line, Brown kicked a 44-yard field goal. But an illegal formation penalty on Buffalo gave the Giants a first down. Three plays later, and after another defensive holding penalty, Manning threw to wide receiver Rueben Randle for an 11-yard touchdown.\nRandle was open largely because the Bills linebackers had been drawn closer to the line of scrimmage by the many successful rushing attempts by the Giants.\nBrown converted the extra point for a 16-3 lead that the Giants took into halftime.\nLoading...
