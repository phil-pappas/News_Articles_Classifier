NCCU fit the bill last season when the Eagles finished the regular season with a 16-0 record in conference play, and earned their second consecutive MEAC regular season title. \nNCCU received 14 of the 26 available first-place votes from the ballots of conference head men’s basketball coaches and sports information directors for a total of 316 points. Hampton was selected second in the poll with nine first place votes (297 points), followed by their arch-rival Norfolk State (283 points) who finished second in the regular season standings during the 2014-15 season. \nAlong with the preseason poll, the conference office also released the Preseason All-MEAC Teams and redshirt senior guard Dante Holmes (Baltimore, Md.) was voted to the Second Team. \nHolmes was named to the All-MEAC Third Team last year as all five NCCU starters earned conference honors. During the previous season, Holmes started all 33 games and was on the floor for an average of 28.3 minutes per game. He put up career-high 10.4 points per game and led the team in steals at 1.3 per game. \n2015 MEAC Men’s Basketball Predicted Order of Finish (As voted on by the Conference’s Head Men’s Basketball Coaches and Sports Information Directors) \nNorth Carolina Central (14) 316 points Hampton (9) 297 points Maryland Eastern Shore 249 points Howard (1) 235 points North Carolina A&T State 163 points Morgan State 159 points S.C.
