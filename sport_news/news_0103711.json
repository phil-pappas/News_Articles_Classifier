The Chicago Blackhawks lead the best-of-seven games series against the Tampa Bay Lightning 1-0. Game 2 is scheduled for Saturday night. (AP Photo/Chris Carlson) A person familiar with the move tells The Associated Press that the Chicago Blackhawks have placed high-priced forward Bryan Bickell on waivers.\nAdChoices The person spoke on the condition of anonymity because the Blackhawks did not include Bickell as part of their roster moves Friday.\nIn making the move, the Blackhawks free up $4 million that Bickell's contract represents against their salary cap.\nBickell is a rugged forward who was the focus of trade speculation this summer. Bickell signed a four-year, $16 million contract after helping Chicago win the Stanley Cup championship in 2013.\nHis production dropped off last year when he finished with 14 goals and 28 points in 80 games. Bickell experienced vertigo, which forced him to miss most of Chicago's Stanley Cup final series against Tampa Bay.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://ap.org/", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T06:47:16.612+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
