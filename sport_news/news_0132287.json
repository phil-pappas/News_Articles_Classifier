After he won his Listed race at Haydock, I remember Frankie saying he didn't even know he was a racehorse and that can happen from time to time - sometimes it's just their talent getting them through. \n\"But then he went to Newmarket and had to knuckle down and have a real race to win his Group Two. \n\"Hopefully he's continuing to improve and if he is, hopefully he's the one to beat on Saturday.\" \nOne potential worry for connections is the forecast of heavy rain on Saturday morning, but Herbert is hopeful it will not scupper Foundation's participation. \nHe said: \"I haven't spoken to John about it, but I doubt it (soft ground) would stop him running. \n\"Very extreme ground would be a concern, but I know we'd definitely rather have it soft than too quick. \n\"He's shown he can handle good to soft ground. Strange things can happen when the ground gets very soft, but what will be will be.\" \nHerbert has been involved with a Racing Post Trophy winner before, with the Royal Ascot Racing Club-owned Motivator prevailing in 2004 before claiming Epsom glory the following summer. \nFoundation's owners include former Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson, who is expected to make the journey to Town Moor this weekend. \n\"It's more than exciting for everyone involved, we've got a good team going to Doncaster and we'll see whether he's up to winning a Group One at this stage of his career,\" said Herbert. \n\"It would be amazing if he can end the season as an unbeaten Group One winner, that would be fantastic, but Group Ones are always very hard to win. \n\"Our jockey is in brilliant form and John's horses have just been in incredible condition all year. \n\"Whatever happens this weekend, we know we've got a very nice horse to look forward to.\" Promoted Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T14:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T19:40:27.549+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
