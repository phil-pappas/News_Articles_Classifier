Indianapolis was still down six points when it occurred, the offense had been stalling, and I'd rather an aggressive play call than a passive one when facing the Patriots. And it might not matter. The Colts play in the worst division in football and will be just fine. \nThe Pick : Colts 34, Saints 24 \nMinnesota at Detroit: I hate when the NFL makes two divisional opponents play twice in the first eight weeks of the season. That's the case here, as these two are having a rematch of a game they played on Sept. 20 in Minnesota. In that one, the Vikings knocked around Matt Stafford and Adrian Peterson ran wild. I don't see much changing on Sunday. C'mon, NFL. This game couldn't have been played in, say, Week 14? \nThe Pick: Vikings 23, Lions 16 \nPittsburgh at Kansas City: The best story in football might be the guy starting at left tackle for the Steelers. Alejandro Villanueva played wide receiver for the United States Military Academy, where he left and served three deployments as an Army Ranger and was awarded a Bronze Star. When he returned back stateside, he was 6-foot-9, 290 pounds, and signed as an undrafted guy by the Eagles . Fast forward to Sunday, and with Beachum down, he'll be starting, protecting Landry Jones' blindside. Incredible story. I'm all about this Steelers team. Jones and Villanueva! \nThe Pick: Steelers 20, Chiefs 16 \nCleveland at St. Louis: Bold prediction of the week time. Todd Gurley is going to run for 200 yards on Sunday. Cleveland has allowed eight runs of 20-or-more yards and three runs of 40-or-more yards this season, while Gurley has five rushes of 20-plus and two of 40-plus this season. He's had another week to rest his knee with the bye, and the Browns defense has now given up 181 yards and 152 yards on the ground in consecutive weeks. It's Gurley Week in America. Start him in your DraftKings, Fan Duel, Draft Ops, DraftDay, FunFace, FaceBook, DraftBook leagues! \nThe Pick : Rams 27, Browns 19 \nHouston at Miami: This game doesn't scream \"Must Watch!\" but for two teams who've looked awfully bad at times this year, a win gets them both right back in the playoff mix. I appreciate what Dan Campbell's done in Miami. He's brought a certain toughness and edge to a team that was downright lifeless. I think the Dolphins rattle another one off on Sunday, and are suddenly 3-3 and in the playoff hunt. \nThe Pick: Dolphins 28, Texans 23 \nNew York Jets at New England Patriots : The irony of this Jets team is that it's a squad Rex Ryan dreamed of. Great up front on D, even better in the defensive backfield, and an offense that pounds it on the ground and limits mistakes in the air. As good as they've looked, I can't see them coming into Foxboro and winning. The Patriots had their first challenge last week and they withstood it. I'd say this could be a hangover game, but the Patriots are like you're one friend from college who never stops -- they're simply immune to hangovers. \nThe Pick: Patriots 31, Jets 17 \nOakland at San Diego: The Chargers had chances to win each of their past two games in the final seconds, but ended up unlucky losers. I just can't pick against Philip Rivers this weekend. He's playing too well to drop a third straight heartbreaker. If he had beaten the Steelers and Packers he'd be in the MVP conversation. \nThe Pick: Chargers 31, Raiders 24 \nDallas at New York Giants : The NFC East isn't the best division in football, but it might be the most interesting. Everyone always says Eli Manning \"owns\" the Cowboys. That's wrong. He's 3-7 in his last 10 against Dallas, and I think Matt Cassel finds a way, here, on Sunday. That's with or without Dez Bryant . \nThe Pick: Cowboys 27, Giants 22 \nPhiladelphia at Carolina: Are the Panthers for real? We'll find out in the next three weeks, with games against the Eagles (who blew them out on national television last year with Mark Sanchez under center), Colts, and Packers. I think they are for real. Carolina's won 12 of its last 15 games that have been decided by seven points or less. Here's another. \nThe Pick: Panthers 24, Eagles 20 \nMONDAY \nBaltimore at Arizona: The Ravens originally planned to stay out in the West Coast in between the San Francisco and Arizona road affairs, but after losing on one of these extended road trips between Denver and Oakland in September, they scrapped it. It's been forever since the Ravens (1-5) were irrelevant. I don't see how they turn it around. We're almost in November. \nThe Pick: Cardinals 30, Ravens 20 \nReader Email of the Week: \nPeter, \nYou said you'd take Cardale Jones if he'd entered the NFL Draft last year. Well, now he's been benched and hasn't looked all that dazzling. Did he make the wrong decision last year, going back to school? Who is the most famous fan for every NFL team? \nRick T., San Mateo, California \nCardale Jones hasn't looked great, and now he's a 24-year-old quarterback who'll likely be riding the pine for the rest of the season. That said, I think he's going to be OK come 2016 NFL Draft time. I had him going in the second round if he came out a year ago and that came from conversations with scouts who hadn't seen much of him on tape. I still think he could be a top-60 pick and I don't think this experience will end up crushing him in the end. Look, he'll be invited to the Senior Bowl, where he'll get a chance to show his stuff for scouts up close and personal, and the quarterback class isn't exactly a knockout group as is. Jones is still pretty raw, still a physical presence, and still a tempting NFL Draft prospect. If you ask me, there was no great harm in him going back to school -- benched or not. \nWeek 7 Cheat Sheet Trivia Answer of the Week: Rodgers passed Johnny Unitas in reaching 30,000 career passing yards with fewest pass attempts in league history.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T23:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T23:24:37.011+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
