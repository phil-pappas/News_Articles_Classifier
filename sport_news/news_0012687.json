Competitors dive from top of scenic Tianmen Mountain \nThat ledge is where the competitors would be diving from.And the 16 participants are all smiles before taking to the edge of the structure, as they try to become champion of the World Wingsuit League event.Two-time champ Julian Boulle and Noah Bahnson would compete in the final -- with the pair diving from this cliff 14-hundred meters above the ground -- and traversing through the valley below the popular tourist attraction.If you are wondering, the sport requires at least 500 sky diving experiences, before making the transition to fly in a wingsuit.Some competitors can average speeds of 160 kilometers per-hour.The pilot that takes the shortest time to finish the route is the winner. Bahnson does so in 33.271 seconds, beating Boulle by about a hundredth of a second, to earn his first title at the China Grand Prix.
