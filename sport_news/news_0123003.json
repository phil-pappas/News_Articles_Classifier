Boyle has struggled to start the year, just as he did for most of his past regular season, his first on a two-year, $9 million free-agent deal he signed that includes a no-move clause.\n“He hasn’t been as good as I’d say last year in the playoffs,” Vigneault said of Boyle. “But today had more to do with seeing Dylan than how Dan had played so far.”\nVigneault finally gave Kevin Klein some time on the power play, with the right-handed defenseman with the big shot getting 3:19 on the man-advantage that promptly went 0-for-5. Klein has been here since coming over in a trade during the 2013-14 season, but got just 6:27 of total power-play time in 65 games last year.\nAs for what took so long to get him on the power play, Vigneault made a joke.\n“I’m not the smartest guy in the world,” the coach said before the game. “I thought last year, he was playing real well, and he got some important production for us. Didn’t see that aspect on the power play. I don’t know, maybe I smartened up. I can’t tell you. But I tried it a little bit [this preseason], and we’re going to give it a try.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T07:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T03:14:43.691+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
