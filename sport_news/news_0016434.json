The editor of Food and Wine put this little list together , and it got me thinking: which sandwich would every ACC coach be? Well, at least until the laughter subsided at the visual of this. \nBest of The Morning Show (Oct. 15, 2015) \nSTEVE ADDAZIO, BOSTON COLLEGE: Chipped beef \nAddazio strikes me as the minimalist type. If a common military meal isn’t good enough for you, then what are you saying about our troops? Besides, he might say, food should be efficient and used as fuel rather than deliciousness. Get in line, get your watery chipped beef on a sandwich and be grateful he’s not giving you gruel. Now run the dang football, dudes. \nDABO SWINNEY, CLEMSON: Melt \nOther elements of a melt – the meat, the bread, the other condiments – often get little to no credit. It’s all about the cheese, you think. But really, all elements of the sandwich must work together in unison in order for the product to work. There can be too much cheese, for instance, or too much of a particular condiment. You can over or undercook the melt. Dabo doesn’t mind letting the cheese part of the sandwich shine while he’s the real sandwich artist. \nDAVID CUTCLIFFE, DUKE: Barbeque sandwich \nSometimes, sandwiches aren’t filling enough. But that’s not the case with a barbeque sandwich. Even if you get one that’s not all that great, barbecue is a really hard thing to mess up, so it’s usually at least a solid meal. Cutcliffe has certainly made meh ‘que into pretty solid fare with his teams at Duke. And when you get the right mix of good meat, savory bread and the perfect sauce, a barbeque sandwich can go from an okay meal to a really darned good one. At least you can almost always trust it to be good enough. \nJIMBO FISHER, FLORIDA STATE: Steak sandwich \nIs a steak sandwich a practical choice? No. You convince yourself you don’t need a steak sandwich; it’ll be too filling. No way it’ll be as good as it sounds. But that’s what Fisher has been at Florida State. As much as you try to talk yourself out of liking his teams, they’re still the cream of the crop of the ACC and that sandwich is filled with a month’s worth of sheer protein and game control. \nPAUL JOHNSON, GEORGIA TECH: Club sandwich \nLike Paul Johnson, there are layers to this sandwich. Usually three of them, in fact. (GET IT?! TRIPLE OPTION?!) Also like Paul Johnson, it’s somewhat underappreciated and filled with a lot more substance than you think. Don’t let all that bread fool you. I also imagine Johnson eating this sandwich and silently cursing to himself as the meat falls out onto his brand new shirt. \nBOBBY PETRINO, LOUISVILLE: Slider \nThis is the sandwich choice for the discerning diner who can’t decide. Just get one of everything! Ultimately you end up not that full and wishing you’d ordered the full version of one of the other sandwiches while not liking the others that much. Next time you go to the restaurant, you go back to the sandwich you had before. Louisville is the simple-but-savory hamburger that Petrino wanted all along rather than the chicken with wasabi mayonnaise or whatever. \nAL GOLDEN, MIAMI: Philly cheesesteak \nThis has elite ingredients, but isn’t always executed very well. That’s the same with Golden’s teams at Miami. Sometimes, you’re just in the mood for this sandwich. Way more often than not, though, it leaves you feeling full, sick or both and you think, what a waste of these delicious ingredients that should make for a better sandwich. Then you start to resent the sandwich. Then you fly banners suggesting the sandwich be fired. \nLARRY FEDORA, NORTH CAROLINA: BLT \nThe base ingredients for a BLT sound amazing: bacon, lettuce, and tomato. What’s not to like? Well, not much. But the actual sandwiches tend to vary in quality. Go one place, and the BLT could end up being two slices of bacon, limp lettuce and a bad tomato. Go another place, and it could be piles and piles of crispy bacon with fresh lettuce and a juicy tomato. That’s kind of North Carolina under Fedora. He could be a flimsy BLT that loses to Wake and leaves you hungry and angry, or a juicy delicious BLT that rolls over bad competition and gets wins over teams like Duke and Georgia Tech on the road. \nDAVE DOEREN, NC STATE: Reuben \nThis might be the saltiest sandwich ever made: corned beef, sauerkraut and swiss cheese topped with thousand island dressing on rye bread. But man, is it full of sustenance. Doeren, like this sandwich, can be a bit salty and hard to swallow at times, but ultimately what he’s offering you is good. You could potentially do better, sure. But maybe you order the lobster roll and it ends up being gross and you’re like, wow, why didn’t I get that Reuben? Why did I want to get so fancy? I should have just been more prudent and ordered the Reuben. It takes time to get used to but once you, you have yourself a great meal. \nPAT NARDUZZI, PITTSBURGH: Sloppy joe \nHe’s a really good coach, and his teams aren’t sloppy – at least, not that we’ve seen. This is less about Narduzzi the person and more about the temporary nature of Pitt’s head coaching job. Just as quickly as you sit down to eat a sloppy joe, half of it is all over your plate, your hands and even your face. Or your pants. And you think to yourself, was this worth it, only for this sandwich – which once seemed delicious and promising – to be spilled everywhere and wasted? It’s fleeting, the joy you feel. And that’s what it will feel like when Narduzzi inevitably leaves for another job because Pitt has no luck. \nSCOTT SHAFER, SYRACUSE: Bologna sandwich with light mayonnaise on whatever bread is on sale \nA hard-nosed man, Shafer has no time or tolerance for your frou-frou sandwiches. I imagine his wife asking him what kind of sandwich to pack him and he says, “Whatever you’ve got in the house. But don’t put any of that cous cous in my lunch box. I don’t eat any of that junk and the other coaches make fun of me.” Shafer eats his sandwich while he watches Syracuse game film and mindlessly chews as he lets that salty taste of bologna distract him from the pain. Then he checks his desk for stray kiwis because ever since that story came out, he has a bunch of comedians on staff all of a sudden. The distracting ennui of bologna is Scott Shafer. \nMIKE LONDON, VIRGINIA: Airplane sandwich \nYou’re in the airport, and you think to yourself, I don’t need to get junk food to take on the plane. I’ll just eat what they serve. It can’t be THAT bad. So you get on the plane and your stomach is rumbling. Then they announce they’ll serve food soon. Thank god, you think. And then they start taking your order and your choices are something you don’t like or a sandwich. The sandwich looks tasty on the menu, and really, you have no choice. So you order the sandwich, convincing yourself it will be good. A mouthful of stale bread later, you’re kicking yourself for not ditching the sandwich idea and going for a better option, even if it is a quick fix. Just, anything but this sandwich because it isn’t working for you. And now you’re stuck with just this sandwich. \nFRANK BEAMER, VIRGINIA TECH: Chicken salad \nBeamer has often make chicken salad out of chicken…well, bad teams he’s had in the past. It’s how the Hokies have kept this bowl game streak alive. But way too much work goes into making chicken salad for it to be worth it. When you buy it somewhere – and there are rare exceptions to this, of course – it’s never as good as you’ll imagine it’ll be, or it always has one ingredient in it you’ll like. You keep it around in your refrigerator and you forget that it’s there until it’s time to throw it out, and you don’t get rid of it until it’s long since gone bad because maybe you’ll use it for something only you never do because you’re already tired of it. It’s good when you do eat it but you never really crave it, and you eventually get tired of it if you have it all the time. \nDAVE CLAWSON, WAKE FOREST: Turkey sandwich \nBear with me here. A turkey sandwich by itself sounds pretty boring. But you can build on that base of a turkey sandwich. You can change up the type of bread. You can toast the bread. You can add all kinds of condiments. You can add as much meat as you want. You can make it with sliced deli turkey or leftover Thanksgiving turkey. The possibilities are endless, but a turkey sandwich is only boring and unimaginative if there’s not limitless potential for it to be a better sandwich. \n(Also, it’s a non-offensive sandwich.)
