It's just exciting to have big games like that and want to win so bad. I think both countries want to be able to flex their muscles, and want to be able to have bragging rights.\" \nDempsey and his U.S. teammates were already anticipating the next chapter in this lively rivalry when they went through a workout Thursday under picturesque California sunshine on the UC Irvine campus. \nThe slumping Americans face Mexico on Saturday at the sold-out Rose Bowl in a one-game playoff for a spot in the 2017 Confederations Cup in Russia, a prelude to the 2018 World Cup. \nWhile Mexico had a raucous summer that included its Gold Cup triumph and the firing of coach Miguel Herrera, the U.S. team reaches Pasadena in need of a landmark victory. Their worst Gold Cup finish in 15 years is just part of an unimpressive year that has Landon Donovan suggesting coach Jurgen Klinsmann should be fired if the Americans don't beat Mexico on Saturday. \nThe Americans don't appear to see it as a make-or-break moment for a team that does not start World Cup qualifying until next month. They seem more excited about the chance to play a big-time game with real stakes against their closest rivals in front of a frenzied, bipartisan Southern California crowd. \n\"Just the tension that's involved in it, the passion from both sets of supporters, from the players, it just goes so far back,\" U.S. striker Jozy Altidore said. \"The game means that much more each time it's played. I think this will be one of the biggest ones to date.\" \nNobody in either jersey has forgotten that these teams met on the same Rose Bowl turf four years ago in the Gold Cup final, and that Mexico rallied from an early two-goal deficit for a riotous 4-2 victory. That loss led to the departure of U.S. coach Bob Bradley, and the Americans are 3-0-3 against Mexico since Klinsmann's tenure began.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T19:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T08:05:17.766+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
