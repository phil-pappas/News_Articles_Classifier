With the victory, Taft improves to 7-1 overall and 3-1 in the South Sequoia League. It didn't take long for the Wildcats to get on the scoreboard. On the fourth play of the opening series, Josh Sailor raced 50 yards for a touchdown at the 10:24 mark. Wasco followed by spending most of the remaining minutes of the first quarter driving before capping it off with a one yard run for the score with 1:58 left in the quarter. Taft struck again early in the second quarter when Sailor raced 17 yards for the touchdown with 9:44 remaining. The Wildcats caught a break soon after the touchdown was scored. Wasco had to punt the ball after their drive stalled, but the punter touched his knee and ball to the ground at the Wasco 4-yard line. Two plays later, Tevin Howell completed a 3-yard pass for a touchdown. Wasco continued the explosion of points three plays into their drive with a 42-yard run. Taft countered three plays into their next series when Howell completed a 42-yard pass play for the score. All totaled, the two teams combined for 21 points in a span of 2:29. Taft had a chance to add on to their lead at the end of the first half when they drove to the Wasco 37. However, Wasco recovered a fumble with about 42 seconds remaining to end the threat. Scoring trailed off in the third quarter with Taft putting up the only points on Howell's completion of a 33-yard pass play. Wasco narrowed the score in the fourth quarter with a 3-yard run early in the quarter. The Tigers had a chance to close the gap some more by recovering the onside kick. Wasco advanced the ball down to the Taft 9-yard line but that was as close as they got to scoring.
