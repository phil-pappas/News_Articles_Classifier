Photo: Dale G. Young/Detroit News via AP University of Michigan fans are still reeling from Saturday’s loss to Michigan State that came courtesy of a last-second mistake by University of Michigan punter Blake O’Neill. He fumbled the ball in Michigan’s final play , leading to a State touchdown and a final score of 27-23.\nAfter the game, O’Neill was served up a giant glass of haterade on social media, so much that the University of Michigan athletic director had to publicly urge people to stop the verbal assaults, which included death threats.\nBut how can people hate on arguably the most beautiful man in college football?\n#mcm Michigan punter Blake O'Neill! Come on he made one mistake get over it because he has done so much with his life already at the age 22 and have you not seen him he is a gorgeous man!! #newcrush #12 #GoBlue \nA photo posted by taylorturpening16 (@taylorturpening16) on Oct 19, 2015 at 10:09am PDT \nO’Neill joined the team this year and hails from Melbourne, Australia, where he played amateur Australian rules football — but, more importantly, modeled his way through his undergrad studies in Oz.\n“I was a little budding Zoolander,” the 22-year-old said at a press conference earlier this year, according to the Detroit News .\nThe 6-foot-2 hunk — who’s working on his master’s in sports management at Michigan — has posed in magazines , walked the runway and even stripped down for a cheeky Bonds underwear commercial.\n\nIn a January interview with fashion site StylehunterMan , O’Neill said his goal is to travel the world while modeling.\n“The beauty of modeling is the ability to hone your craft in almost any city of the world,” he said.\nA little interview I did with Peter Mack of Stylehunter is up and about online, check it out #Viviens @viviensmodelmgmt @stylehunteraust @swickly get that shirt back on! \nA photo posted by blakewoneill (@blakewoneill) on Jan 16, 2014 at 2:22am PST \nFor now, he’s honing the craft of American football on the field. Sure, he’s got a lot to learn, but — with puppy dog eyes like his — you can’t be mad for too long.\nWould hazard a guess September 12, 2015 was the first time two Aussies have played off in the Big House… Ever.
