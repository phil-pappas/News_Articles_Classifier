This time it's top running back Josh Ferguson who will likely be sidelined Saturday at Iowa with a right shoulder injury.\n\"I'm not optimistic, but I wouldn't put anything past him,\" Cubit said of Ferguson.\nBut the likely reality?\n\"You just go the next guy,\" Cubit said. \"It's always going to happen in college football. You just move on.\"\nFerguson, who has 381 yards on 71 carries, was scheduled to see a doctor Monday afternoon for further evaluation.\nFreshman Ke'Shawn Vaughn has already been broken into the role for the Illini (4-1, 1-0 Big Ten). He took over in the third quarter against Middle Tennessee when Ferguson was out with leg cramps and again in Saturday's upset victory against Nebraska after Ferguson was injured near the end of the first quarter.\nVaughn rushed for 98 yards on 24 carries against the Cornhuskers and has 325 yards on 76 carries with two touchdowns this season.\n\"He's reading his holes really well,\" Cubit said. \"Overall he works hard, he's smart, good vision. He's a determined young man.\"\nThe concern will be not overusing Vaughn. Henry Enyenihi , a junior-college transfer, will serve as the backup after playing in a limited capacity in four games, gaining 58 yards on 18 carries.\n\"(Vaughn) can't go out there with 30-some reps,\" Cubit said. \"(He'll) just wear down. Henry's got to give us some time.\"\nThe Illini are already without receivers Mikey Dudek and Justin Hardee , who have not played this season because of injuries.\nSorry refs: Cubit said he talked to Big Ten officials coordinator Bill Carollo about the error in the Nebraska game that resulted in confusion over the downs for Illinois.\nThe College Officiating Consortium acknowledged the error in marking the down and distance properly.\n\"They've got a hard job,\" Cubit said. \"We all make mistakes.\"\nStruggling special teams: Yes, Taylor Zalewski kicked the game-winning 51-yard field goal to beat Middle Tennessee. But he missed attempts of 41 and 51 yards against Nebraska and is 6 of 11 this season. He also struggled with kickoffs Saturday, but Cubit said the strong winds were a factor.\nCubit didn't sound ready to replace Zalewski.\n\"I can't go out there and doubt him,\" he said. \"The kid won the Middle Tennessee game for us. That's how we coach. I tell them how good they are. Go out and get it done. If they don't, they'll get another shot.\"\nsryan@tribpub.com\nTwitter @sryantribune\nCopyright Â© 2015, Chicago Tribune College Football Illinois Fighting Illini Nebraska Cornhuskers Iowa Hawkeyes", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-5612ce58/turbine/ct-illini-rb-ferguson-doubtful-against-iowa-20151005"], "published": "2015-10-06T00:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T01:47:23.249+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
