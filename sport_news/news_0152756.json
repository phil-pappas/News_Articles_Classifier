The professional basketball player was about to give a handout to a man asking for money when police officers took him to the ground and arrested him, a former teammate testified Wednesday. (AP Photo/Seth Wenig) \nWhen asked by defence attorney Alex Spiro to describe his character, he said it was, \"of the highest order.\"\n\"Thabo is of the highest character,\" he said during brief testimony in Manhattan Criminal Court.\nThe Swiss national is charged with misdemeanour obstructing government administration, disorderly conduct and resisting arrest charges stemming from a confrontation with officers outside a trendy Manhattan nightclub early in the morning on April 8. He has pleaded not guilty.\nOfficers testified this week that Sefolosha and former teammate Pero Antic repeatedly disobeyed their orders to move off the block and away from a crime scene that had been established following the earlier stabbing of another NBA player, Chris Copeland, and two women.\nOne of the officers also said Sefolosha lunged at an officer with his arm extended but was intercepted before making contact, eventually taken to the ground and arrested.\nSefolosha has testified that he was complying with orders and moving up the block as a particularly aggressive officer screamed profanities at him.\nHis attorney has argued that his client was singled out by the officer, who is white, because Sefolosha is black.\nSefolosha testified Thursday that he was trying to give money to a panhandler before entering an awaiting car when he was grabbed by police. He said his leg was kicked in the scuffle and he was taken to the ground, handcuffed and hauled to a police precinct. He suffered a fractured right leg, which forced him to miss the playoffs.\nThe case is the second one involving high-profile athletes accusing New York Police Department officers of wrongdoing this year. On Wednesday, the city agency charged with investigating police misconduct substantiated claims by former tennis star James Blake that an officer used excessive force when he took him to the ground last month after mistkaing Blake for a fraud suspect.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T16:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T00:09:34.350+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
