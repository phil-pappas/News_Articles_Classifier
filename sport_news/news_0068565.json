Charlie Riedel AP i Order Reprint of this Story WACO \nAt the midpoint of a record-setting season, Baylor receiver Corey Coleman considers himself “blessed and thankful” that an opposing coach has dubbed him the best player in college football. \nBut he would prefer to tap the brakes, at least temporarily, before fully embracing the handle bestowed Saturday by West Virginia coach Dana Holgorsen. Holgo went all-in after Coleman’s three-touchdown performance in a 62-38 rout of the Mountaineers allowed the junior from Richardson Pearce to establish Baylor’s single-season standard for touchdown catches (16) ... with six games still remaining in the regular season. \n“Every time I strap on the pads, I feel like I have to be the best player out there, and the best for my team. So we can win and do what we do,” Coleman said during Monday’s news conference. “Everyone has their opinion. But you can’t change the way you see yourself. If you look in the mirror and say, ‘I’m the best player,’ nobody can change what you think of yourself.” \nSo, does he agree with Holgorsen? Is Coleman truly “the best player in college football,” as the West Virginia coach suggested? \n“I’ll let y’all know at the end of the season,” Coleman said, smiling. \nBaylor coach Art Briles requested a similar stay on a public pronouncement Monday because the best player in college football is supposed to win the Heisman Trophy. \nBriles’ loyalty in that race remains divided at this juncture between Coleman, who leads the nation in TD catches (16) and scoring (16 points per game), and quarterback Seth Russell, who leads the nation in passing efficiency (210 rating), TD passes (27), yards per completion (18.5) and points responsible for per game (32). \nI’ll let y’all know at the end of the season. Baylor WR Corey Coleman, on whether he considers himself the best player in college football. \nBaylor’s dynamic pass-and-catch tandem will be back in action Saturday when the second-ranked Bears (6-0, 3-0 in Big 12) meet Iowa State (2-4, 1-2) at McLane Stadium (11 a.m., ESPN). \nAlthough Briles indicated he would prefer to delay Heisman hype for Coleman until “after 12 games,” he stressed that no one at Baylor is surprised by Holgorsen’s sentiments. \nNor is anyone surprised Coleman (5-foot-11, 190 pounds) has emerged as one of three players in FBS history to begin a season with six consecutive 100-yard receiving games that included at least one TD catch. The other two (Oklahoma State’s Justin Blackmon, Texas Tech’s Michael Crabtree) went on to win the Biltenikoff Award, given to the nation’s top receiver. \n“He’s a special player. The way he’s come out of the gates, this is not earth-shattering news to us,” Briles said. “It’s his passion, it’s his energy, it’s his toughness and it’s his skill level that allows him to separate himself from other people. But if you don’t have talent, then you’re still going to be normal. He’s got all that with talent.” \nDuring Coleman’s four years on campus, which included a redshirt season in 2012, Briles said he’s seen the former high school quarterback improve as a route-runner and a student of the game. He’s also become more accountable, Briles said, while “handling his emotions better.” But his competitive streak remains unchanged. \n“Corey just doesn’t lose. Ever. At anything,” offensive tackle Spencer Drango said, reflecting on his teammate’s intensity that extends to sessions of rock, paper, scissors in the Baylor locker room. “Even if he loses, he never loses [in his mind]. He has that drive of never losing and it carries over to the field.” \nColeman acknowledged that, if Drango ever throws “scissors” on top of his “paper,” an automatic rematch ensues. \n“He’s got to play me until I win,” Coleman said. “I don’t take losing well. I just want to win and I don’t think anything’s wrong with that.” \n16 TD catches through six games for Coleman, most in any season by a Baylor receiver \nAs long as Coleman continues to lead the team in receptions (41), touchdowns (16) and all-purpose yards (918) while averaging 21.4 yards per catch, the Bears’ opportunities to lose will be few. Rival coaches readily identify him as a key factor in keeping the Baylor offense balanced and productive while topping the 60-point mark in five consecutive games to tie an NCAA record. \nKansas coach David Beaty said Coleman is “as dynamic as anybody I’ve seen” in college football, primarily because of his explosiveness and top-end speed. Texas Tech coach Kliff Kingsbury said he shares Holgorsen’s sentiment about Coleman’s upside. \n“He’ll catch the ball at a dead stop and then outrun your entire defense,” Kingsbury said. “And he tracks the ball very well on those deep balls.” \nAsked if he’s decided about entering next year’s NFL Draft, Coleman said: “I haven’t thought about that. I’m really just being the best I can be for my team.” \nIn the estimation of Holgorsen, that makes him the best player in college football. Even if the folks at Baylor are reluctant to echo those sentiments. At least for now. \nNo. 2 Baylor vs. Iowa State \n11 a.m. Saturday, ESPN", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T02:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T03:17:07.909+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
