(AP) Safeway will be the title sponsor of the PGA Tour event in Napa for the next five years, and it will stay at Silverado. \nIt replaces Fry's Electronics, which still had one year left on its contract. \nFry's first became involved with the PGA Tour in 2006, and the following year it sponsored tournaments in Las Vegas and Arizona. The Frys.com Open had been at CordeValle in San Martin before moving to Silverado last year. \nThe plan had been to hold the event at The Institute, a private course in San Martin. A clubhouse still has not been built while waiting for regulatory approval. \nThe Safeway Open is expected to be the opening event for the 2016-17 season. 0", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T02:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T02:16:24.970+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
