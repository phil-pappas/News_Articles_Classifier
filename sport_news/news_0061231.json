He is strong in contact, good under the ball and he can also kick.” \nSavea shares the record with South Africa’s Brian Habana and Lomu for the most tries in single World Cup tournament — eight — and that could go when Habana and Savea meet on Saturday. \nBut at the start of the Rugby Championship, when coach Steve Hansen used an extended squad to find his World Cup ensemble of 31, Savea was on the fringes. \nHe committed the cardinal sin of turning up for training out of condition and was rejected for the first two games against Argentina and South Africa. \n“He turned up overweight,” Hansen said then. \nThree weeks of intensive running saw Savea force his way back into the line up for the final game against Australia. \nHansen was pleased. He wanted Savea back, having already rated him better than Lomu. \n“Jonah was a great player but I think Julian has got more to his game than Jonah,” the coach said in 2014. \nBut there was no mistaking the similarities when Savea used his immense bulk — 192cm and 107kgs — to take the short route to the line against France, running over Noa Nakaitgaci and Scott Spedding on the way. \nSavea, a humble person, is not comfortable with the comparison. \n“I’ve always said that no one can come close to Jonah, he’s amazing,” Savea said. \n“I watched him in every home game in Wellington running over people like little kids. It’s awesome to be compared to him but I’m just doing my job as best I can.” \nAs the Springboks pore of replays wondering how they can stop The Bus they can take heart that he has not scored against them in five previous Tests. \nLomu never managed to score against the Springboks in 12 internationals.
