There’s no way last weekend actually happened, is there? It can’t truly, genuinely, honestly be possible that every one of last season’s top-four teams actually won their games, can it? You’re really trying to tell me that Arsenal, both Manchester teams and Chelsea all picked up three points in their Week 9 matchups? Impossible. Somehow, it took eight weeks in this strange and unpredictable season for all the English Premier League’s heavy-hitters to get their acts together at the same time, but it’s finally happened. The question, then, is whether the third weekend of October was an anomaly or whether life in England is finally getting back to normal. We’ll have a better idea after this weekend, but here’s five games to watch. 1. It’s derby time Depending on how Arsenal does, the winner of this weekend’s Manchester derby will likely be sitting atop the Premier League table when Sunday turns to Monday. Manchester City currently occupies that lofty perch with 21 points, but no one at United should feel too bad about themselves as they sit in third with 19 points. Neither Manchester club has lit the world on fire so far, but in a season where mediocrity’s reigned supreme, it’s been enough. And honestly, it’s a Manchester derby. The supporters are going to go nuts, and there’s sure to be some sort of controversy. It’s a must-watch no matter what. Manchester United vs. Manchester City, Sunday, 8 a.m., TSN 2. The inevitable letdown If you’ve spent any time watching Arsenal over the past, oh, 100 years or so, you’ll know the Gunners tend to fall into a pattern. They win a few games convincingly enough that supporters buy into the idea that their team might be a contender, and then it all comes crashing down to earth. Prepare for impact, folks. After beating up on Watford last weekend in a 3-0 drubbing, Arsenal defied the odds in the Champions League with a 2-0 win over Bayern freaking Munich. Arsene Wenger’s squad is riding high, but if history tells us anything, it’s that this weekend’s match against Everton will put an end to all the good vibes floating around North London. Arsenal vs. Everton, Saturday, 10 a.m., SportsnetWest 3. Rise or fall Everyone loves a Cinderella story, but imagine how much better Cinderella’s rags-to-riches tale would have been if she’d had to fight her doppelganger for the glass slipper at the end. The winner gets the prince, while the loser’s stuck with a black eye and a long walk home with only one shoe. Who wouldn’t see that movie? That’s essentially the story with this weekend’s game between Crystal Palace and Leicester City. We’ve talked about them a lot in these pages, but both teams are a ton of fun to watch, and with Leicester in fifth and Palace in sixth, they’re exceeding expectations. A win would keep the dream alive, but the loser will likely drop into mid-table obscurity for the time being. Leicester City vs. Crystal Palace, Saturday, 8 a.m., TSN 4. Even better You know what’s better than the aforementioned Cinderella story? West Ham. The Hammers are on a crazy roll to start the season, and after beating up on Palace last weekend and earning themselves a 3-1 win, they’re only four points back of the Premier League lead. Unfortunately, with parity ruling the day — or season — in the Premier League this year, West Ham is also only four points up on 10th-place Liverpool. A loss to Chelsea this weekend wouldn’t be devastating, but a win would provide a whole lot of comfort. West Ham vs. Chelsea, Saturday, 8 a.m., TSN4 5. What a Klopp! Liverpool didn’t exactly light the world on fire in Jurgen Klopp’s debut as manager last weekend against Tottenham, but a 0-0 draw isn’t a terrible result, all things considered. It’s going to take a while for Klopp’s strategies to really take hold, but impatient Liverpool supporters are going to be agonizing over every setback. This weekend’s matchup with Southampton is no easy task -- the Saints are actually two places ahead of Liverpool in the table, in eighth -- but offers Klopp the chance to soothe nerves around the club.
