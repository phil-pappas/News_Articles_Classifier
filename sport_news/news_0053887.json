He was inactive with a hamstring injury. Mychal Kendricks, who missed the previous two games with a hamstring injury, returned to the lineup and started with Jordan Hicks. \nWide receiver Riley Cooper was also active, even though he was questionable with a knee injury. Cooper did not appear to play his full workload early in the game. Miles Austin was the starter. \nThe Eagles also missed wide receiver Nelson Agholor (ankle) and linebacker Kiko Alonso (knee) because of injury. Both players were declared out Friday. Defensive lineman Brandon Bair was questionable with a groin injury and was among the inactives, but he was the odd man out on the defensive line earlier this season, too. \nThe healthy scratches were quarterback Thaddeus Lewis, cornerback Denzel Rice, and offensive lineman Tanner Hawkinson. Sturgis from deep \nKicker Caleb Sturgis hit a 52-yard field goal in the first half for the Eagles. It was his longest kick since coming to the Eagles on Sept. 29. After a rough start to his tenure, Sturgis stabilized - the 52-yarder was his seventh consecutive made field goal. He missed a 50-yard try wide left in the fourth quarter. . . . Ryan Mathews' 63-yard touchdown run in the third quarter was the longest run of his career. Mathews' previous long was a 51-yarder on Nov. 17, 2013.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T05:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T06:03:06.394+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
