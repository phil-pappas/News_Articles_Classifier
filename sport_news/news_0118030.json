Photos from the annual Black & Blue Rivalry football game between Prescott and Bradshaw Mountain High Schools on October 23, 2015 in Prescott. The Badgers beat the Bears 30-13. Watch the videos Ken Sain Special to The Courier Prescott High School was in control for most of Friday's football game against rival Bradshaw Mountain, but with 5 minutes and 54 seconds to play in the fourth quarter the Bears narrowed the lead to 16-13.Bradshaw Mountain has been a second half team all season and Prescott hadn't scored in the second half to that point, so the game was in doubt.A wiggle later, it was over.Junior running back Christian Setter scored on the game's next offensive play, running 78 yards for the game-clinching touchdown to give the Prescott Badgers a 30-13 win.The victory means that the Badgers are scheduled to play host to Mingus Union next Friday for the Arizona Interscholastic Association Division III, Section VIII championship.\"Obviously I think the 78-yard run was the backbreaker,\" said Prescott coach Cody Collett said. \"It's 16-13 with 6 minutes left, if they stop us and get the ball back, who knows what happens.\"Collett said it was a wiggle that set Setter free.\"One of the amazing things he did on that run, is they had the angle to catch him, and he did a little stutter and kept going, it was one of the sweetest moves I've seen in a football game,\" Collett said. \"We call that a wiggle, if you wiggle it slows them down ... they don't know where you're going. If you keep going fast and they can get the angle. It was a beautiful run.\"It was one of three beautiful touchdown runs for Setter, who scored on a 50-yard run in the first quarter taking the ball in the wildcat formation and sprinting down the Bradshaw sideline to put the Badgers up 6-0. And he added a 30-yard run with 2:03 to play for the game's final score.Setter rushed 22 times for 189 yards and the three touchdowns. That put him over 1,000 yards rushing for the season (he's at 1,087). The victory gave Prescott (7-2, 2-1 in section) possession of the Esse Quam Videri 19 Cup, the rivalry's trophy that honors the Granite Mountain Hotshots and an 18-5 lead in the all-time series with their rivals.\"It comes naturally,\" Setter said of his wiggle. \"I was just running, doing what I know best, just run.\"Bradshaw Mountain (6-3, 2-2) struggled offensively on a wet, muddy field. The Bears were limited to 3 yards of total offense on their first two drives.\"Coach [Brandon] Johnson was here for 20 hours, so please make sure you put that in the paper,\" Collett said. \"That son of a gun was here for 20 hours putting together a game plan. That guy is a hell of a defensive coordinator and our defensive staff did a hell of a job.\"Another Prescott player who had major contributions was senior Derek Knotek, who scored the game's second touchdown on a 45-yard reception that he bobbled for about 10 yards until he finally caught it and was able to elude a lunging defender for the score. But his biggest contribution came as a punter, where his long kicks gave Prescott an edge in field position.Bradshaw Mountain score on a 16-yard Gunner Bundrick-to-David Otero touchdown pass in the final minute of the first half and then on a 3-yard Bundrick run in the fourth quarter.The Bears, the defending section champions, gave the ball away four times, twice on fumbles and twice on interceptions.Setter said he's looking forward to playing Mingus for the section title.\"It comes down to that game, either we win, or we don't go to the playoffs, so in my opinion that game is more important than this game was,\" Setter said. Badgers overwhelm Bears on sloppy Shepard field By DOUG COOKThe Daily Courierdcook@prescottaz.comPrescott High's football team gained a measure of revenge on rival Bradshaw Mountain Friday night, Oct. 23, defeating the Bears 30-13 to stay alive in the Division III, Section VIII title hunt while eliminating the two-time defending champs from contention.Not only did the Badgers take back the Esse Quam Videri 19 Cup - named in honor of the 19 Granite Mountain Hotshot firefighters who perished in the Yarnell Hill fire in 2013 - by avenging a 29-7 loss to the Bears in 2014.More importantly, they resuscitated their playoff hopes. If Prescott defeats section-leading Mingus Union Oct. 30 at home, the Badgers will win the section and earn an automatic berth. Mingus crushed Flagstaff on Friday, paving the way for an exciting match-up for all the marbles next week.On an evening that Prescott running back Christian Setter stole the show with three long touchdown runs that ultimately defeated Bradshaw, one aspect that couldn't be overlooked was a wet, muddy and cold Bill Shepard Field on which the typically high-scoring Bears couldn't move the ball.Bradshaw committed five turnovers on the wet turf, including three fumbles and two interceptions.\"They killed us,\" Bears center R.J. Aguilar said of the cough-ups. \"That's basically it. They killed us.\"Yes, it's true - the Badgers possess a stingy, opportunistic defense and a rushing offense that doesn't rely much on the pass as two-time defending section champion Bradshaw. But the grass field's conditions, affected by soaking rains in the area this past week, seemed to play directly into Prescott's hands.\"It was terrible,\" Aguilar said afterward as he trudged across the field. \"It's hard to walk. My feet were being dragged down by the mud the whole time. The ball was drenched every time it was put down.\"And yet, somehow, PHS led only 13-6 at the end of the third quarter. It was a defensive stalemate until 6 minutes left in the final frame, when the Bears pulled within a field goal of Prescott, 16-13, on a 2-yard TD run by Bradshaw quarterback Gunner Bundrick that was aided by a couple of questionable pass interference calls.Ultimately, the contest came down to the very next play from scrimmage, when Setter ran up the middle of the field, 78 yards to pay dirt on first down from Prescott's own 22. Setter's shifty moves on a muddy middle of the field were nothing short of sweet, as he cut to the right sideline and into the end zone.With Prescott leading 23-13, Bradshaw was forced to pass and didn't muster much. An overthrown ball to wideout David Otero on third-and-long eventually led to the Bears going for it in their end of the field and giving the ball back to Prescott on downs.\"The field is a big reason why we couldn't even play our game, pretty much,\" Bundrick said. \"About 50 percent of the time, the ball was unthrowable. ...But no excuses.\"The Badgers, who played a superb field-position game the entire evening behind talented punter Derek Knotek, needed only four plays to seal a victory, as Setter scored from 30 yards out with 2:03 left for a 30-13 advantage.After the game, Bradshaw coach David Moran got into a bit of an argument with Prescott coach Cody Collett at midfield, apparently regarding the Badgers' late exchange of game film this week.He may have been more upset about the field conditions.\"They wetted it and let the grass grow - it was high grass,\" Moran said. \"That game should have been moved to Bradshaw because of the field conditions. This wasn't because of the rain. But we'll move on.\"Bradshaw was eliminated from winning the section title, but not from the state playoffs. If the Bears can beat No. 8-ranked Maricopa next Friday, they very well could make the playoffs for the third consecutive year.\"We just go in tomorrow, we watch film, learn from our mistakes and start preparing from there,\" Aguilar said of Bradshaw's plans.Prescott has been trying to get back to the postseason since 2012, and they soaked up every ounce of their home-field advantage Friday.Granted, Bradshaw didn't do itself any favors by committing several penalties. The Bears were missing starting senior offensive linemen Dillon Rogers and Cameron Davis, who were ruled ineligible for the Prescott game. That meant seniors Zack Latham (right guard) and Sethe Tomsick, and Raul Gomez (left tackle) were pressed into service Friday.Bradshaw senior offensive/defensive lineman John Trout, a team co-captain, said the Bears had a great week of practice leading up to the big game, and that everyone was focused and working hard. He said on Thursday, Oct. 22, that the key for Bradshaw's offense was he and his line mates being verbal, while focusing on their timing and recognition of different defensive packages.That may have worked to a degree, but in the 23rd annual \"Black & Blue\" rivalry series game, the D-III No. 26-ranked Badgers (7-2 overall, 2-1 section) had just enough to dump the No. 14 Bears (6-3, 2-2).\"Obviously you never want to lose to these guys or anything, but we try to move forward to next week and see what we can do to make it to the playoffs,\" Aguilar said. \"It's not going to stop us. We're a good team.\"Follow Doug Cook on Twitter @dougout_dc", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T10:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T11:19:59.951+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
