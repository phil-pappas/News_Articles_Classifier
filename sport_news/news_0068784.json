I think that in all senses, he was the perfect player to arrive to our team.” \nCity trailed for only six minutes, Adil Rami’s own goal cancelling out Yehven Konoplyanka’s 30th-minute opener, and yet prior to a late surge by the Premier League leader, it was the Spanish side which looked the more likely winner. \nBut after an opening 1-2 loss to Juventus, City has now come from behind to win twice, having beaten Borussia Moenchengladbach 2-1 on its previous outing courtesy of a last-minute Sergio Aguero penalty. \nIn Group B, Anthony Martial gave away an early penalty and then scored the equalizer as Manchester United, which faces City in a league derby on Sunday, came back to draw 1-1 with CSKA Moscow. \nWolfsburg’s 2-0 win over PSV Eindhoven in the night’s other group game leaves the German team top with six points, two points ahead of United and CSKA, with PSV last on three points. \nIn Group A, Cristiano Ronaldo and Zlatan Ibrahimovic struggled as Paris Saint-Germain and Real Madrid played to a lackluster 0-0 draw in Paris. \nWith two earlier wins for each, Real and PSG have seven points. Malmo reached three points by defeating pointless Shakhtar Donetsk 1-0 at home. \nIn Group C, it was: Atletico Madrid 4, FC Astana 0; and Galatasary 2, Benfica 1.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T19:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T03:58:15.596+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
