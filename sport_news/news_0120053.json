Haskin spent two seasons with at Independence (Kansas) Community College before transferring to Tennessee State. \n“Brandon is a big, physical lineman with indoor football experience,” Shock head coach Adam Shackleford said. “He has the athleticism to be effective in both the pass and run game for us and should make a great addition to our roster.” \nDotson (5-10, 200, Sacramento State) played nine games for the Nebraska Danger of the IFL last season. After being released by the Danger, Dotson joined Shackleford with the IFL’s Tri-Cities Fever. Dotson, of Carson, California, played two seasons at Golden West Junior College in Huntington Beach, California, before transferring to Sacramento State of the Big Sky Conference. \n“Austin is a playmaker, plain and simple,” Shackleford said. “We will use him in several different ways offensively as he has deep-threat capabilities with his speed and is a terrific screen and ball carrier. I am looking forward to working with him for a full season.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T02:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T06:55:55.997+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
