Watching a win go right through their hands against what may very well be the least talented team in the Big Sky Conference was nothing but disheartening for a UND program that has made great strides this season.

Watching a win go right through their hands against what may very well be the least talented team in the Big Sky Conference was nothing but disheartening for a UND program that has made great strides this season. Going into the games, it appeared the Bengals only chance at a win was to have a phenomenal game through the air against a lackluster North Dakota secondary. Well that was the case as Idaho State went crazy through the air gaining 427 passing yards and scoring four touchdowns. UND once again had a nice day on the ground racking up 270 yards. But, it wasn't enough as Idaho State earned the 37-31 victory. Despite it being a successful year so far for the University of North Dakota, last Saturday's loss is an excellent showing of the inconsistency all season long. As impressive as the team looked in wins against Wyoming and Portland State, the squad has looked extremely average in close wins over Drake and UC Davis (not to mention its two losses). Another key to point out is that UND has not looked good at home this season. The team's best outputs have come on the road. That is good news this week for North Dakota as the squad will travel to Ogden, Utah to face Big Sky foe Weber State. On paper, it's a very even matchup. The Wildcats and UND both sit at 2-1 in the conference. Each squad has gotten beaten up on the road to North Dakota State, but the teams have bounced back to have nice starts in the Big Sky. The difference is the momentum going into the contest. UND, just a week after being ranked in the top 25, comes into the game battered and embarrassed. The team lost starting quarterback Keaton Studsrud late in last week's game and he remains questionable for this week. Last week, the team just couldn't come up with any stops when it needed to against Idaho State. Now, North Dakota faces a team coming off a gigantic triumph. Weber State upset Montana on the road 24-21 in overtime last week. The Wildcats are one of the more balanced teams in the Big Sky racking up 952 yards through the air and logging 919 yards on the ground. Weber State has shown the ability to pass the ball and look for the them to go through the air early and often Saturday. UND must figure something out with their secondary. It's going to be an extremely tight game. I look for Weber State to again pull out a very close victory. While my heart says North Dakota 23-17, my heads predicts Weber State will win 27-21 in overtime.
