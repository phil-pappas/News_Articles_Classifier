I'm not going to comment anymore on that. I'm going to let Coach comment on that,\" McCown said. \"I was throwing the ball. I thought it was a pass, but the guy hit my elbow and I just felt something in the back of my shoulder there.\" \nMcCown's injury came after he completed 26 of his 32 attempts for 270 yards without a touchdown or interception, and rushed for 21 yards on four scrambles, but fumbled twice and one of his turnovers led to a Rams field goal. \n\"All of them, they're never easy to take,\" McCown said of the loss. \"As competitors, obviously we don't want to lose Again, the defense really played well for the most part and gave us opportunities. It just seemed like we were shooting ourselves in the foot as far as just the way we started the game. We were just fighting out of holes all day. \n\"It's hard to be a good offensive football team when we're doing those things, so whatever we've got to do throughout the week in our preparation to be better, we've got to do that, find a way to get it fixed and for me, I'll do everything I can looking at the tape and in preparation to make sure that it doesn't happen because we've got to be better.\" \nIn McCown's absence, second-year quarterback Johnny Manziel completed four of his five attempts for 27 yards and rushed for a gain of five yards. \n\"I just had a weird feeling last night with the way that this defense was, the way the D-line was, that something might happen, so I was more than prepared and was pretty excited to get back in there,\" Manziel said. \"Obviously, it was late in the game, but nevertheless, it was good to get in. \n\"I feel like we let an opportunity to slip away when we needed to come out and get a win.\" \nSunday's loss to the Rams was not the first time the Browns had to turn to Manziel after McCown suffered an injury. \nMcCown suffered a concussion on the first drive of the regular season in a 31-10 loss to the New York Jets, and Manziel played seven straight quarters, the last four of which came in a start, and victory, over the Tennessee Titans at FirstEnergy Stadium. \nIn that start, Manziel completed eight of his 15 attempts for 172 yards with two touchdowns. However, he was sent back to the bench when McCown cleared the NFL Concussion Protocol one week later. \n\"Obviously, early in the year, I got a chance to start, come in whenever Josh was out, and did some good things, and since then, I haven't gotten a chance to get back out on the field,\" Manziel said. \"Obviously, I've been continuing to shore up everything, continuing to learn, and I felt like the progress through the season has been really well as far as scout team, as far as getting the reps in practice that I do. If Josh goes out and is out for an extended period of time, I think I'll be able to step in and try to make something happen. \n\"It was obviously a little disheartening. It was tough to go back from being the starter, getting all the reps and then, going back into being the backup. I think I handled it just fine and adjusted just fine. I've learned a lot from the position I've been in these past couple weeks with Josh being there. \n\"I think my football knowledge, my football IQ has gone up more this season, more being with this staff, being with Josh and especially having Austin (Davis) in the room as well. That's a really smart quarterback room with (coach) Kevin O'Connell in there, so even though I'm not playing, even though it's disappointing, I'm continuing to learn more and more about this game, more and more about this position that I didn't know in the years past, so that's all you could ask for in the role I was in.\" Read or Share this story: http://on.wkyc.com/1N1NkCu TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T07:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T08:02:52.913+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
