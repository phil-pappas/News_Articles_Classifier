They were impressive, and we had to change the way we played,” Scotland's Kiwi coach Vern Cotter said. \nEngland closed their disappointing tournament as the first main hosts top go out at the pool stage with a 10-try, 60-3 win over Uruguay in Manchester. \nThe Uruguayans were out of their depth yet showed that there has been some progress since they lost 111-13 in 2003 against the England team that won the title. \nToday is the last day of pool action and the pick of the day's four games is at the Millennium stadium where France and Ireland are battling for top spot in Pool D. The losers will face New Zealand in the quarter-finals while the winners take on Argentina. — Reuters", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T05:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T05:16:41.850+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
