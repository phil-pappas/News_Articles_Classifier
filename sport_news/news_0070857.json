Yeah, High Lighter,this is the Schotty Fence,with the Psycho-QB No-Schott-Fence, come on!And negatory on the tally of touchdowns there, High Lighter.You might just say I took over our playbook and kicked it up;it's better that way.Uh! How'd we do it?Oh, well, we kicked it once, kicked it twice, missed it once, kicked it thrice, and ran it up the middle a really great deal.Oh, and they kicked it once, missed it once, kicked it twice, and did some stuff and got stuffed by our defense a really great deal. \nOn a side note, for Hate Week, I'm planning on doing a series of 5 Disney songs that I'll label--of course--\"Disney Dawgs.\" Someone requested some Elton John, so I'll be doing a heart-warming parody called \"Can You Feel the Hate Tonight.\" Please feel free to request other potential Disney songs to parody in the comments. I make no promises as requests tend to be hit or miss for me, but I'll take them under advisement.
