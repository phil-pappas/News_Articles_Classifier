Curtis’ record-setting day was the spark the eighth-ranked Eagles needed as they led top-ranked Lindsey Wilson from the start and picked up one of the biggest wins in the team’s young history. Staff photo by Katherine Frye slideshow WALESKA — No. 8 Reinhardt started fast and pulled away late to beat No. 1 Lindsey Wilson 42-28 on Saturday in front of a record-setting homecoming crowd of 2,374 at Ken White Field.The Eagles (8-0, 3-0 Mid-South West) jumped out to an early lead as Niagel Curtis capped the game-opening drive with the first of what would be a team record five rushing touchdowns. Then, the defense forced Lindsey Wilson (6-1, 1-1) into a three-and-out, and Ryan Thompson found Tyler Bradley for a 46-yard touchdown pass to give the Eagles some breathing room.“We haven’t been able to do it too much this year,” Reinhardt coach Drew Cronic said, “but it was nice to get out to an early lead. I’ll take it when we can get it. I think we surprised them early with some of the sets we ran, but they made some adjustments later. That’s why the fast start is important.”The 42 points was more than double what Lindsey Wilson had allowed against any other opponent this season, and the most since the Blue Raiders’ previous meeting with Reinhardt — a 52-48 win for the Eagles last Sept. 6 in Columbia, Kentucky.While Lindsey Wilson never recovered from its early deficit, it did not go quietly. Quarterback Dylan Beasley threw for 375 yards and two scores, and Cory Davenport picked up 72 yards on just four carries. Hunter Lovell hauled in four passes for 116 of the Blue Raiders’ 509 total yards.The biggest difference between the teams was how they performed in clutch situations, with Reinhardt holding the advantage on both sides of the ball.The Eagles were 9-of-16 on third downs, 3-of-3 on fourth downs and scored on all five trips to the red zone. Lindsey Wilson, meanwhile, was only 5-of-13 on third downs, 1-of-3 on fourth downs and scored just 10 points on four trips inside the 20.“I don’t know if we played our best game,” Cronic said. “We gave up some big plays, and we gave up a lot of yards. But, on the biggest plays, we really showed up. Those are the money downs, and numbers don’t lie. We outperformed them there.”Those conversions allowed Reinhardt’s offense to stay on the field for 93 plays, during which the Eagles racked up 573 total yards — 327 rushing and 246 passing.Thompson continued to show why he has commanded the lion’s share of the snaps at quarterback this season, completing 15 of 22 passes for 246 yards with no interceptions. His favorite targets were Aaron Kennedy, who had five catches for 48 yards, and Bradley, who caught five balls for 126 yards.“We’re more balanced when we play better teams because we have to be,” Cronic said. “When a team is good, they’re going to be able to slow down what you do best. They did that a little bit, so we had to throw it. Those guys really made some plays for us.”Reinhardt may have had to lean on its passing game at times, but it did not abandon the run. Curtis gained 129 yards on 23 carries, and L.J. Stegall carried the ball 12 times for 68 yards. Deonte Dennis and Thompson also chipped in with 57 and 34 rushing yards, respectively.Reinhardt will have next week off to recover before returning to action Nov. 1 for a trip to Campbellsville University in Kentucky, in a game that could decide the Mid-South West title. Campbellsville, which played Cumberland Saturday night, will be coming off a game with Lindsey Wilson.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T07:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T03:12:36.879+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
