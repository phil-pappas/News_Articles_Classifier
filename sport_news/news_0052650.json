Although neither team struggled to gain ground, both lacked the finishing touch, and the first quarter ended 0-0. \nNo scoring drought plagued the Blue Streaks after the break. Harrisonburg got off the mark immediately with Rodney Morris scoring their first touchdown just 52 seconds into the second quarter. Jose Gonzalez-Cavazos stuck the extra point for a 7-0 lead. Harrisonburg wasn’t done, however, and senior Abner Johnson added to their total on a 27-yard reception with 7:41 remaining. The Streaks went into halftime ahead by a total of 22-0. Raekwon Smith added a 75 yard return in the fourth quarter and Malachi Simmons nabbed another for a final score of 42-0. \nSophomore Anthony White shone the brightest for the Blue Streaks. The quarterback scored off an 11-yard run in the second quarter and ran a 58-yard touchdown in the third quarter. \nHARRISONBURG", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T05:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T06:44:37.483+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
