Businesses and homes have been hit, including Speeder & Earl's. Thieves have targeted the coffee shop three times over the last few months.\n\"Obviously we're upset about it and I think more for us there is a certain sense of violation that comes along with getting broken into like that. It's not really anything you want to walk into at six in the morning either,\" said Matt White, the manager of Speeder & Earl's.\nPolice tell WCAX News they are working on leads. In the meantime, Speeder & Earl's is installing a new security system.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T09:28:26.122+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
