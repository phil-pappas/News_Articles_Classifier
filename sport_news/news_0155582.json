I have no doubts he is my best right-back, and that he has to improve in some aspects of his game this season. Simple as that,\" Mourinho told his press conference when asked about the 31-year-old's poor form. \n'Ivanovic likes to speak with me, and Ivanovic likes to speak with me about his mistakes, and is not crying. He's not crying, he's not a prima donna, and I'm critical with him. We speak about what he has to do to try and improve,\" the Portuguese tactician added. \nMourinho's defense of Ivanovic continues to cast doubts about the future of Ghanaian left back Baba Rahman who is still considered unready by the Portuguese manager, meaning Cesar Azpilicueta will continue at left back. \nRahman joined the Blues this summer from German side, Augsburg and was assured of a regular first team football at Stamford Bridge but has yet to make a Premier League appearance for the English champions, the Black Stars defender only playing for Chelsea in their UEFA Champions' League match day one 4-0 victory over Maccabi Tel Aviv on September 16 as well as the Carling Cup 4-1 win at Wallsall last week. \nIn fact, Baba Rahman only flirt with the Premier League was as a benchwarmer in their 2-1 home defeat to Crystal Palace on August 29, as well he was also on the bench in the UEFA Champions' League match day two defeat to Porto in Portugal on Tuesday.
