(AP) - A lawyer for a Mississippi woman accused of attempting to join the Islamic State wants to delay her Oct. 26 trial.\nTwenty-year-old Jaelyn Delshaun Young of Vicksburg recently changed lawyers, hiring the firm of prominent Jackson attorney Dennis Sweet III.\nIn a Thursday federal court filing, Terris Harris asks a judge for the delay, saying he needs to investigate evidence he just received from prosecutors.\nHarris writes prosecutors don't object to a delay.\nYoung and 22-year-old Muhammad Dakhlalla of Starkville each pleaded not guilty to charges of aiding terrorists. The couple were arrested Aug. 8 before boarding a flight with tickets for Istanbul. Authorities say they contacted undercover federal agents in May, seeking online help in traveling to Syria.\nHarris declined to comment Thursday. Prosecutors didn't respond to emails seeking comment.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
