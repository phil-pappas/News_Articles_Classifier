In 31 minutes of action, Cunningham not only scored 31 points, but also, pulled down four rebounds and handed out three assists. \nIn addition to Cunningham, center Anderson Varejao (10 points), guard/forward D.J. Stephens (11) and guard Matthew Dellavedova (13) scored in double figures in the loss. \nEarly in the game, Varejao came off the bench, and then, knocked down five of his seven shots from the field, en route to a 10-point performance in the first quarter. In addition to his 10 points, Varejao pulled down three rebounds and handed out an assist in just over six minutes of action. \nVarejao's assist came when he took a pass from Dellavedova while rolling to the hoop, and skipped a pass into the left corner of the floor, where Cunningham caught the ball, squared himself up to the hoop and buried a 23-foot three-point shot, which gave the Cavaliers a 22-13 lead over the 76ers with 3:48 to play in the first quarter. \nIn the final 61 seconds of play in the first quarter, Varejao made a trio of jump shots, including back-to-back attempts from 20 and 17 feet, respectively. \nThe Cavaliers followed up the solid first-quarter production with more offensive prowess in the second period. \nWhile the 76ers struggled shooting the ball and made only nine of their 23 attempts, the Cavaliers converted 12 of their 23 shots, including a three-of-eight mark from three-point range, which allowed Cleveland to hold a 34-30 edge in scoring in the second quarter and take a 65-54 lead into halftime. \nCunningham caught fire for the Cavaliers in the second quarter, and converted four of his five attempts from the field, including one of his two three-point shots, and made six of his seven shots at the free-throw line, en route to scoring a team-best 15 points in the period. \nThe Cavaliers built their lead over the 76ers to 15 points, 89-74, by outscoring Philadelphia, 24-20, in the third quarter. \nAlready up by 11 points heading into the third quarter, the Cavaliers ballooned their advantage to 17 points, 71-54, with three quick baskets out of the halftime break. \nAfter small forward James Jones buried a 20-foot jump shot on the opening possession of the third quarter, fellow forward Richard Jefferson stole a ball, and later, caught a pass from Dellavedova before pulling up for a 16-foot jumper. Point guard Mo Williams staked the Cavaliers out to the 17-point lead when he buried an 18-foot pull-up jumper of his own with 10:29 to play in the period.
