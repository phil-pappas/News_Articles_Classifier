It's altitude with an attitude.\"\n\"A team on the rise,\" eh? I suppose when you're at the bottom, there's nowhere to go but up. With a record of 66-92, Colorado entered Thursday night's game 22K games out of the National League West. And with just three games remaining, it's just running through the motions as Colorado closes out its fifth consecutive losing season.\nIt's been a frustrating year to follow, to say the least.\nSo, for science, I decided to indulge in a 750mL bottle of the proprietary red blend while watching a game to see if it improves the experience — as the description states, \"with a wine like this, nothing can bring you down.\" If my math is correct, drinking the entire bottle is roughly the equivalent of consuming just less than a six-pack of Fat Tire.\nAdvertisement Warning: Do not try this at home. I am a professional.\nThursday night, Rockies at Diamondbacks. My couch isn't quite the party deck, but it is awfully comfy.\nThe Rockies score early. But Arizona puts two on the board at the bottom of the inning. Why did DJ LeMahieu make that grab in the first to allow a run? It doesn't make sense.\nUnlike the wine's fruity aroma, which carries over into the flavor. The first sip is sweet and is rich but not overly bold. A mild bite hits in the back of my palette.\nThe second and third innings fly by as quickly as the first two glasses of wine as the pitchers seem to be settling into their rhythms.\nTo bring a taste of the ballpark to my home, I have a plate of diced bratwursts accompanied by cubed pepperjack cheese and apples. The wine becomes sweeter with the bratwursts. Any and all bitterness is gone. Just a gentle sweetness that complements the meats.\nThe bitterness subsides in the game as well. Top of the fourth, Wilin Rosario with a stand-up double. He goes on to score on a wild pitch. Rafael Ynoa cranks a double, driving in Kyle Parker — 3-2 Rockies.\nThe apple, while delightful on its own, does not complement the wine at all. Its sweetness overpowers the wine's, leaving only bitterness.\nThe Colorado Rockies are one of 19 MLB teams with its own vintage of wine. (Joe Nguyen, The Denver Post) Arizona comes back to tie the score 3-all. End of the fourth. This is turning into a good game.\nAs the third glass is poured, the pepperjack cheese goes incredible well with the wine. The cheese balances the fruitiness of the wine and brings a spiciness to the front of the palette.\nRosario comes up big in the top of the fifth, driving home Charlie Blackmon to give the Rockies another lead. But the rally disappears as quickly as the food I prepared. What's this I'm hearing about a churro dog on TV?\nWATCH: Fans focused on selfies, churros instead of Rockies-DBacks\nArizona ties the score in the bottom of the inning, but at this point, my focus is turning to the hunger in my belly. Ynoa with another double in the top of the sixth, scoring Parker to give the Rockies a 5-4 lead.\nA heaping spoonful of honey sates the appetite. Pairing with the wine, it's certainly sweeter, but surely it's the honey that's carrying the flavor at this point.\nEmbarking on my fourth and final glass in the top of the seventh inning, the Rockies score yet again as Tom Murphy drives Nolan Arenado home. But I'm out of food. That's taking priority. Another bratwurst goes on the pan.\nLightheadedness starts to enter in with the fourth glass. The bitterness also becomes more pronounced at this point.\nArizona scores on an inside-the-park home run. And then add three more in a four-run seventh inning to retake the lead. D-Backs 8-6 heading into the eighth. Good game.\nThe bratwurst and cheese rebalance the wine.\nAnd the game. Not much happens in the final two innings. At least, I think not much happened. Things start getting blurry by this point.\nFatigue starts setting in midway through the fourth glass of wine. The desire to finish it diminishes — as does the desire to continue watching this game — replaced by a want to sleep. The wine did its job of taking the pain of watching the Rockies give away yet another game this season.\nIt's 10:51 p.m. The game is over. Rockies lose. Again. I'm going to bed.\nCHEW ON THIS • MLB reporter Patrick Saunders' more eloquent telling of the Rockies' loss to the Diamondbacks .\n• Broncos scramble to patch their offensive line with signing of Tyler Polumbus , columnist Mark Kiszla writes.\n• The Broncos' defensive transformation extends beyond just the field.\n• Q&A with Broncos receiver Bennie Fowler .\n• Johny Hendricks won't be fighting at UFC 192 .
