An inventor, from Sarasota, Fla., thought there needed to be a better way, so he invented the FISHING ROD HOLDER. The FISHING ROD HOLDER offers a hands-free way to use a fishing rod. In doing so, it eliminates the need to place the rod on the ground. It also ensures that the hands are free for other tasks like baiting the hook and eating. The invention features an accessible design that is convenient and easy to use so it is ideal for use by fishing enthusiasts. Additionally, the FISHING ROD HOLDER is producible in design variations and a prototype is available.\nThe inventor described his inspiration for the invention. “I am a fisherman and I thought there needed to be a better way to hold a fishing rod when landing a fish in waist deep water, so I created my prototype.”\nThe original design was submitted to the Tampa office of InventHelp. It is currently available for licensing or sale to manufacturers or marketers.
