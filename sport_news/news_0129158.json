The case was then referred to the city attorney's office.\n\"We feel, as a program, he’s missed a quarter of his season and shown remorse for the actions that he’s taken,\" Coach Jim Mora said on Sept. 22 when he announced Adams' reinstatement. \"He’s accepted responsibility. He’s accepted the consequences. He’s apologized profusely to his team, his teammates, this staff, and he’s come back with a great attitude.\n\"So we’re going to move forward that way. If things change, we’ll adjust.\"\nA UCLA spokesperson declined to comment on the development.\nAdams is scheduled to be arraigned in Los Angeles Superior Court on Nov. 16.\nThe 5-foot-8 junior started in last week's 56-35 loss at Stanford. Last season, he was an All-Pac-12 first-team selection.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T04:56:40.276+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
