Tai, who is the Hong Kong Open and World Superseries Finals champion, is one of the most reputed players on the circuit, notching wins over the world's best players. In recent times, she has de feated Saina thrice. \n\nBut when the world No.13 is on song, she seldom cares for the reputation of a player and on Thursday, the lanky shuttler from Hyderabad steamrolled Tai in just 34 minutes. Tai hardly troubled Sindhu in the match. Using her smashes to great effect and moving well on the court, Sindhu broke free at 4-4 in the first game and never looked back. She continued in the same vein even in the second. \n\nSindhu will now face former world champion Wang Yihan of China late on Friday. Incidentally, it was Sindhu who had dethroned World No.1 Yihan in 2013.She followed that victory by defeating several top stars. But is often criticised for not justifying her talent.
