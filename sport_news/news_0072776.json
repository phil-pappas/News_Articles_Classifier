(Photo: photo provided) 1 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nWhat was expected to be announced at the end of the year was revealed Wednesday. \nPurdue plans to spend $60 million to upgrade its out-of-date football facilities, expanding Mollenkopf Athletic Center and centralizing into a single location various needs to help the struggling program climb out of the basement in the Big Ten standings. \nThe project is pending approval by the board of trustees at its December meeting. But since university President Mitch Daniels, board president Michael Berghoff and athletic director Morgan Burke made the announcement, consider it a done deal. \nThe project, which is called the Purdue Football Performance Complex, is expected to break ground in May 2016 and be completed in August 2017. \nThe timing of the announcement came during Purdue's bye week. The coaching staff has been on the road recruiting and is probably facing questions about the team's 1-6 record, including a five-game losing streak heading into the Oct. 31 matchup against Nebraska at Ross-Ade Stadium. \n• BOILERS XTRA : Get all your Purdue news in the palm of your hand \nIn his third season, coach Darrell Hazell is 5-26 overall and 1-18 in Big Ten games. \n\"It should be helpful in signaling that the board and this administration cares about winning in football,\" Berghoff said. \"We care about academic excellence, we care about operational excellence and there's no reason that can't extend to excellence in football and every sport. That message has got to help Darrell.\" \nThe existing training areas offer inadequate space and few effective recruiting tools. Mollenkopf Athletic Center was built in 1989 and has limited instructional and support space, including the weight room, coaches offices, meeting rooms and locker room space. \nWhile Hazell has lost 26 of 31 games and the team hasn't shown enough progress to please the fan base, Daniels said the facilities aren't helping. \n\"I'm convinced this is a necessary step,\" Daniels said. \"There are other times for evaluation and personnel and so forth, but if we don't have this kind of infrastructure in place, I don't think Knute Rockne goes undefeated here.\" \nAmong the highlights: \n• About 110,000 square feet will be added to the north side of the existing facility. \n• A three-story complex will combine locker rooms, state-of-the-art workout equipment, coaching offices, film rooms, a player's lounge with study space and team meeting rooms. The facility will sit between Ross-Ade Stadium and the outdoor and indoor practice fields. \n\"It speaks to the importance of football around Purdue. That's what we need. We're behind in terms of those facilities and we need to catch up,\" Hazell said following Wednesday's practice. \nPopulus, a firm specializing in the design of sports facilities and will oversee the project, provided Purdue a comparison about how it stacks up with other Big Ten programs along with Notre Dame. Purdue ranked in the average/OK and below average/bad in 12 of the 18 categories. \nDon't look for Purdue to make the jump from last to first in the facility arm's race by the time the project is completed. That isn't the goal. \n\"We didn't start out the conversation by saying we wanted to go from last to first,\" Berghoff said. \"We said we all want the football team to work out all at once in the weight room when they want to and not have to schedule it around other sports. We want to have a facility that allows the football team to meet as a group all in one location in the team meeting room. We want to have a facility that allows the coaches to each have an individual office and not share offices. \n\"We don't want a facility with a barber shop. We want to be competitive in the middle, appropriate, and we're fortunate enough that we've got enough other reasons to become a student-athlete at Purdue that we don't have to have the facility carry the load.\" \nThe construction of the Football Performance Complex will be prioritized over plans for renovations of Ross-Ade Stadium's South End Zone. \nThe new complex will be financed using donations and revenue from the Big Ten Network partnership and other media contracts. The Big Ten's new television contract starts during the 2017-18 school year. \n\"We're very confident we can do this with a combination of revenues we can already see and donor interest,\" Daniels said. \nFormer quarterback Drew Brees donated $1 million last summer following a football summit in San Diego. \n\"You can treat that like the first installment,\" Daniels said. \nSaid Berghoff: \"We have folks who have strongly indicated interest; (they) haven't written a check yet, it's not deposited but it wouldn't be unlike Drew's commitment for a $1 million, except it's from people who aren't famous like Drew.\" 1 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://indy.st/1LOlI2R TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T15:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T19:50:28.984+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
