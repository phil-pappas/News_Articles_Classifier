The latest benefactor of this loophole was North Central Missouri Conference rival Hannibal and the Class 4 8th-ranked Pirates used Moberly’s weakness to its advantage here last Friday night at Dr. Larry K. Noel Spartans Stadium. Hannibal generated nearly 610 total yards of offense including 540 attributed to its running attack,and also would take advantage of five Spartan turnovers as the Pirates pillaged Moberly winning 56-13. “Our guys competed and fought. It came down to Hannibal making more plays than we did. Hannibal obviously is a very talented football team and they played like it,” said Moberly first year head football coach Cody McDowell. “There were times we did some good things, but obviously we did not do enough of those good things. We’re need to regroup and get ready for our game coming up next week at Boonville.” Hannibal running back Shamar Griffith ran roughshod through would-be Moberly tacklers as the five-foot-six, 155-pound junior bounced his way off bodies while using his speed and agility to rush for 308 yards and score four touchdowns on 19 carries. His touchdown runs went for 6, 93, 2 and 36 yards respectively during the first half. After he ran twice for a gain of 13 yards early in the third quarter, Griffith took to the sidelines for the remainder of the evening. Griffith now has roughly 1,500 rushing yards and has 22 touchdowns to his name this campaign. That’s more than twice the number of rushing yards and six visits to the end zone more than what Moberly has collected as a team this season. “He runs hard and he does not go down by arm tackles. There were times we got him, but many times we didn’t,” McDowell said. “He is one of those players who runs hard and is very shifty, making it hard to get a good hit and square up on to make a good tackle.” Hannibal (7-0, 5-0 NCMC), who has defeated Moberly 15 out of the last 17 meetings, provided a forecast of what was to come from the get-go. Upon receiving the opening kickoff and starting at their own 23, their first five snaps of the football went for rushing first downs. On fourth-and-5 from the Moberly 16 yard line, senior quarterback Jerry McBride threw a touchdown pass caught by Devon Thomas at 8:56. The completion would be the only one out of four attempts made by McBride. He also ran 10 times for 74 yards, and Will Sewell rushed for 96 yards on three carries to help pace the Pirates rushing attack. Hannibal had another touchdown reception when a pitch was made to tailback Trevor Watson and he surprised the Moberly defense with his pass to Josh Arnold. It resulted in a 43-yard touchdown with 9:30 remaining in the second quarter to extend the lead to 28-0. Page 2 of 3 - Despite trailing by four early touchdowns, the Spartans (2-5, 2-2 NCMC) put up a fight to climb back into the contest by scoring on its next two possessions. Moberly’s first scoring drive began at its own 20. From the shotgun quarterback Drake Davidson took the third snap of this series, took one step right and quickly aired the football some 40-yards as if telling junior wide receiver Ryan Boulware “here it is, now chase and catch it.” The speedy junior did not disappoint as Boulware ran past Hannibal defensive back Collen Brummell, making an over the shoulder catch that resulted in a 74-yard Moberly touchdown at 8:02. Place kicker John Heimann made good on his one of two PATs and Moberly trailed 28-7. As good as Hannibal performed, the Pirates had some hiccups of their own by fumbling the ball over three times. On the ensuing kickoff, the Pirates fumbled the ball and it was recovered by Moberly junior Alec Bates at the Hannibal 37. After Davidson misfired on three successive pass attempts the Spartans were facing a 4th-and-10 situation when a timeout was called. In lieu of punting, hoping to pin the Pirates inside the 5, the Spartans executed another play having two players in the backfield to provide Davidson extra pass protection. Receiver Gavin Stoddard ran a passing route taking him toward the middle of the field not far from the line of scrimmage when Davidson was flushed from the pocket forcing him to scramble. As the Pirates defense converged toward the Spartan signal caller, Stoddard made a cut upfield and Davidson found him for a 37-yard touchdown pass with 7:30 remaining. The extra point failed as Moberly trimmed its deficit to 28-13. “We had the wrong personnel on the field for something we wanted to do. We called the timeout to make sure we got it right before we would probably end up scrambling around on the play,” said coach McDowell. “It (touchdown pass) was a little momentum boost, but then we kind of lost it after that. It’s one of those deals where once we find it, we need to learn to keep it. That’s one of those things we have been battling this season.” Hannibal added two more scores and took a 42-13 lead into halftime. Moberly received the second half kickoff, and on the second play from their own 34, Davidson’s pass went into the chest of McBride and he returned the interception 42 yards untouched along the Hannibal sidelines and past the pylon. McBride’s pick-6 touchdown gave the Pirates a 49-13 command and initiated a running clock for the remainder of the game. The Pirates finished the scoring outburst with a 50-yard rushing touchdown from sophomore Kevin Campbell during the fourth quarter. Page 3 of 3 - Davidson ended up completing 11 of 26 passes for 216 yards, two touchdowns, and he threw two interceptions in the game for Moberly. Boulware made two catches totaled 82 yards and Stoddard also finished with a couple of receptions for 43. Matthew Fulks had three catches that totaled 53 yards. Josh White had a 27-yard reception and Heimann came down with one that went for 10 yards. Kolten Hess had two receptions that netted 11 yards. The Spartans only generated about 55 total rushing yards with 34 of it arriving in the fourth quarter. Freshman running back Chance Richards and sophomore backup quarterback Nick Gelina each rushed four times garnering 22 and 12 yards respectively. Heimann rushed eight times for a gain of 15 yards.
