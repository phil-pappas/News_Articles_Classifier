(AP) - Mississippi has set a historic marker at the courthouse where the founder of the nation's largest predominantly African-American Pentecostal group once preached from the steps.\nCharles Mason founded the Church of God in Christ in 1897 in Lexington, Mississippi, after falling out with the African-American Baptist community in Jackson.\nAfter preaching outside the Holmes County Courthouse and other spots in Lexington, he established St. Paul Church of God in Christ there. It's considered the mother church of the denomination, which is now based in Memphis, Tennessee.\nMississippi state archives official Jim Woodrick tells The Commercial Appeal ( http://bit.ly/1hLSfu4 ) the marker is among more than 1,000 approved since 1949.\nInformation from: The Commercial Appeal, http://www.commercialappeal.com\nCopyright redistributed.", "external_links": ["http://bit.ly/1hLSfu4"], "published": "2015-10-19T01:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T04:19:20.441+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
