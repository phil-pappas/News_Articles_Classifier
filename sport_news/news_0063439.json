So he made his team watch some of the tape of that game. \n“We talked about us versus us,” Sherrock said. “Were we going to get frustrated and allow the game to frustrate us or were we going to be patient and continue moving the ball? They showed a lot of maturity and trust in each other.” \nThe Cougars, seeded No. 1 for the first time, broke through Logan’s defense in the second half with three goals for a 4-0 victory. The Cougars face second-seeded Shawnee at 7 p.m. Monday at Tecumseh in the sectional final. \nShawnee (8-5-5) defeated Bellefontaine 3-0 Thursday behind a goal and assist from Alyssa Garberich, the leading scorer in the Central Buckeye Conference. The Cougars beat Shawnee 4-1 on Oct. 5. \n“Anytime you play Shawnee you have to be worried about Alyssa Garberich,” Sherrock said. “She’s got a great foot. She can score from anywhere. Within 40 yards of the goal, she’ll take a shot.” \nThe Cougars (11-3-3) didn’t try to attack Ben Logan (6-10-2) down the middle like they did in the first meeting. Instead, they kept the ball wide and attacked from the edges. \nAudri Blackburn hit the left post then watched the ball trickle along the goal line before it barely rolled in for a 2-0 Cougars lead early in the second half. With 8:57 left, Lauren Rutschilling made it 3-0 on an assist from Allee Goodfellow off a corner kick by Kaylee Houseman. Five minutes later, Lilly Lacey scored on an assist from Rutschilling. \n“What we were able to do tonight was just everyone share the ball,” Sherrock said. “Iman (Salhieh) scores most of our goals, and she didn’t need to get one tonight to be effective.” \nSherrock also gave credit to midfielders Houseman, Avery Colvin, Libby Hawke and Rileigh Crable, who scored on a long free kick in the first half. \n“Our midfield did a really great job of keeping the ball moving,” Sherrock said. “When you can play that way it’s going to be hard for the other team to defend.” More News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T04:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T06:31:20.398+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
