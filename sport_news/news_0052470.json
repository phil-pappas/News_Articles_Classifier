With her Wildcats leading rival Augusta 25-24 in the third set Reinhardt went up for an attack and pummeled a ball that fell perfectly between Oriole defenders and hit the ground. “I remember thinking in my head ‘I want the ball’,” Reinhardt said flashing a huge smile after the win. “I want to put this ball down and finish this game.\" When I saw that we got a perfect pass to the setter, I knew the set was coming my way.” As Reinhardt’s arms went up in celebration, her teammates quickly mobbed her in a scene meant for the movies. It was the perfect end to a long day for El Dorado and moved them to .500 on the season at 17-17 for the first time since August. “A huge rush of emotions went through me,” stated Reinhardt. “The whole game both teams had been battling back and forth. I've never wanted to win a game more than this one, especially since we're rivals and it was our home court. I also wanted to win because I knew how much it meant to Coach Chelsea Helena for us to ‘dig deep’ and battle and prove to her that we could finish this game.” El Dorado opened the tournament with a tough matchup against Collegiate and Memphis commit Addison Root. Despite strong play by sophomore Sydney Scanlon and senior Jenae Waite, the Wildcats fell in three sets to the Spartans (19-25, 25-20, 16-26). The Cats’ then bounced back with a two-set sweep over Chanute (25-23, 25-17) moving to 1-1 in tournament play. El Dorado then met 5A power Valley Center where the Cats’ again got out the brooms for a two-set sweep. El Dorado defeated the Hornets (25-13, 25-21). In their next match, El Dorado faced off with Buhler for the third time this season. The Cats’ continued their hot streak with another two-set sweep as they dominated the Crusaders (25-13, 25-15). Colbi Phillips and Destiny Smith led the Cats’ in all three matches. In their final match of the day El Dorado met Augusta for the fourth time this year in a battle which the winner would claim second place in the tournament. Augusta came out quick in the first set led by Clarice and Sophie Dalziel, the Orioles took a 6-2 lead over El Dorado. Maddie Hallmark aided the O’s with perfect serves and allowed her offense led by Clarice Dalziel to attack the El Dorado defense which seemed overpowered in the first set. Augusta took a 20-14 lead and never let El Dorado back in as they claimed the first set 25-20 on a set winning kill from Alison Macari. Page 2 of 2 - The second set belonged to El Dorado senior Kayln Beel. The powerful attacker seemed to record kill after kill as the Cats’ jumped out to a 16-10 lead over Augusta. Strong play by Olivia Peiffer, Caedyn Reinhardt and Morgan Owens propelled the Wildcats late as they held on taking set two 25-22. In the final set between the two rivals fans were treated to great volleyball by both teams. The two squads went point for point early on as Clarice Dalziel put Augusta ahead 5-4 with an ace but Reinhardt gave El Dorado a 10-9 lead on a kill. Macari put Augusta ahead 13-12 with a kill and much like the first meeting between the two, Sophie Dalziel met an El Dorado attacker at the net and rejected the attack putting the Orioles ahead 19-17 and it looked as if Augusta would pull away. Maddie Hallmark had a beautiful serve that El Dorado couldn’t dig putting Augusta ahead 21-17 and the match seemed to be over, but nobody informed El Dorado of that. The Wildcats quickly closed the gap to 22-20 and 24-23 when junior Braylon Daniels made the play of her season earning a kill to keep El Dorado alive and tie things up at 24. Augusta then committed and error giving the Wildcats a 25-24 lead before Reinhardt ended the match with a kill. “Even though I was the one who scored the last point, every single one of us contributed to that win,” Reinhardt stated. “I wouldn't want to play with anyone else.” El Dorado finished the day 4-1 in tournament play and earned second place just behind champion Collegiate. Augusta went 3-2 on the day and finished third. The Orioles opened the morning with a three-set win over Buhler (25-17, 21-25, 25-18) led by strong play from Faith Hallmark and Riley Zerr. Augusta then fell in a tough three-set match to Collegiate (21-25, 25-20, 20-25) led by Kylie McDaniel. The Orioles then swept Valley Center (25-15, 25-17) before knocking off Chanute in three-sets (23-25, 25-17, 26-24) All Tournament Team- Three local athletes finished the day being named to the all-tournament team.
