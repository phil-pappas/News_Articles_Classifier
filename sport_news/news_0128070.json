This prevents the weapon from shifting or slipping. It is designed to enhance personal safety. The sling also safeguards the weapon from potential damages. It attaches to most rifle hunting slings with metal swivels. It does not take the place of the hunting rifle sling; it is in addition to it. Additionally, it makes it easier to climb into and out of a tree stand.\nThe original design was submitted to the Jacksonville office of InventHelp. It is currently available for licensing or sale to manufacturers or marketers.
