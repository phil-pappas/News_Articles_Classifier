He made the controversial remarks while inaugurating a kisan mela at the Farm Machinery Testing and Training Institute (TTI) here today. When the audience continued to shout him down, Dhankar said the true sons of farmers were listening to him and, those creating nuisance, were proving they were illegitimate children. Later, the visibly upset minister left the venue without even inspecting the fair. The situation took an ugly turn soon after Dhankar started his speech. Initially, he tried to placate them by saying that he too used to enjoy hooting earlier. The minister then urged them to hoot at a higher pitch. Then, he said that he was making some important announcements for farmers urging the audience to listen to him. But when those hooting did not stop, he got agitated and stated that those who are not listen him are not the sons of farmers. He went on to say, “We are offering the highest compensation of Rs 12,000 as compared to neighbouring states like Punjab, Rajasthan. We have spent about Rs 2,000 crore for the welfare of farmers in one year. And I am here to announce a subsidy of Rs 50 crore on farm machinery for you,” he said. He added they have started the procurement of bajra and had been quick to order the special girdawari of the damaged crops like cotton, guar etc in the interest of farmers.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T04:15:18.084+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
