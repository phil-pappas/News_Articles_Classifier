Photo: Jeremy Liebman for WSJ. Magazine DAVID LAUREN, 43, son of the legendary fashion designer Ralph Lauren and executive vice president of global advertising, marketing and corporate communications for his father’s company, strolls through the New York flagship store on a late-summer afternoon. “My father writes through clothes,” Lauren says as he stops to flip through a monograph about the brand, admiring glossy images of horses on beaches, vintage cars and models in haute prep wear. “He takes you into these dreams.” He pauses as he comes across a black-and-white photo of the young Lauren family—and of himself as a child, smiling winsomely at the camera. “I grew up inside the dream,” he says.\nIf Ralph Lauren has excelled at evoking fashion fantasies—seducing customers by conjuring visions of British aristocrats or American cowboys—his son is focused on making those fantasies more immersive with 21st-century media and technology. He led the recent development of the PoloTech “smart” shirt , which tracks biometric data, and spearheaded a holographic runway show last fall in which 3-D models were projected onto a four-story wall of water in New York’s Central Park. He also pioneered Ralph Lauren’s use of QR codes, allowing customers to purchase items via mobile devices, after encountering them in Japan. A viewing of Steven Spielberg’s Minority Report inspired him to create interactive window displays.\nRelated Ralph Lauren Hands Reins to an Outsider Though he’s found his place in the family business, he never intended to work for his father. While at Duke University he started Swing magazine, a publication meant to give voice to Gen X (and eventually acquired by Hachette Filipacchi); he served as editor in chief until 1998, when the venture shuttered. In 2000 he joined Ralph Lauren—somewhat against his better judgment at the time—where he was immediately tasked with helping the company navigate the digital revolution.\nWhile he’s eager to be recognized on his own merits (he prefers to not be photographed in the same places his father has been shot), his reverence for Ralph Lauren, both the man and the company he may one day take over, is obvious. “My job is to help my father tell stories,” he says.\nTracking David Lauren Follow David Lauren as he attends various meetings in New York City. fullscreen 8:30 A.M.
