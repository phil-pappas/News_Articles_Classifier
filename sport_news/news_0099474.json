Mercogliano , vmercoglia@lohud.com 8:39 p.m. EDT October 13, 2015 \nIt’s been a hot and cold season for the Scarsdale boys soccer team, and the Raiders seem to be heating up again at the perfect time. \nWith the playoffs a week away and a league title still within reach, Scarsdale picked up a pivotal 5-2 win over New Rochelle on Tuesday at Quaker Ridge Elementary. \n“There are ups and downs,” Scarsdale coach Paul Brooks said. “The season is condensed into two months and it’s difficult. Of course there are going to be bumps in the road, but these guys have bounced back.” \nThe Raiders (11-2-1) started the season with five straight wins, but followed that with a stretch of one win in their next four games. Now they’re back on track, with Tuesday’s win over the Huguenots (6-4-3) resulting in their second five-game winning streak of the year. \n“It’s all building blocks for the team,” Brooks said. “We’re just trying to get better and better each match and hoping that we can peak for the playoffs.” \nFazl Shaikh continues to be an offensive spark for Scarsdale. \nThe senior midfielder scored the first goal in the opening minutes, and moments after New Rochelle’s Stevenson Dieudonne tied it, Shaikh scored again on a penalty kick to make it 2-1. \n“Fazl is an integral part of the team,” Brooks said. “I’ve known him since he was 9 or 10 years old, and to see him mature into a man has been great. ... I’m happy to see that he’s flourishing.” \nMisael Jimenez eventually equalized for the Huguenots, but the Raiders dominated the final 20 minutes. Luca Novaes, Michael Spiro and Paul Bernard closed out the game with three unanswered goals. \nThe win sets up a showdown at home against Mamaroneck (10-2-1) on Thursday, which should decide the League II-A title. \n“When we stick to our principles and our game plan, then I think we can compete with anybody,” Brooks said. “We’ll have to play through adversity and hopefully the ball will bounce our way.” Read or Share this story: http://lohud.us/1Ltaj8w Most Popular", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T03:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T04:33:03.174+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
