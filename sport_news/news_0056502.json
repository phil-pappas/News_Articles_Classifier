But today is the real deal.\nThe 1989 sequel picks up right where the first film left off, with a transparent-tie-wearing Doc Brown having returned to 1985 to whisk Marty and his girlfriend forward to a time when \"Something's got to be done about your kids!\"\nBack to the Future II's 2015 predictions explored In the 1989 film Back to the Future II, Marty McFly travels 30 years into the future from 1985 to October 21st, 2015. Now that we've arrived at that date in real life, what parts of the film's 2015 vision have come true?\nThey arrive on Oct. 21, 2015 to find a world where hoverboards glide over the streets, flying cars navigate aerial highways, humans have mastered control of the weather and \"The justice system works swiftly in the future now that they've abolished all lawyers.\"\nWhile we now can only lament that none of those things have come to pass, the jury is still out on another one: Upon his arrival in 2015, Marty is astounded to see that the Chicago Cubs have just won the World Series against Miami. While the film correctly foresaw Miami getting an MLB team (they had none in 1989), it failed to realize that the Marlins would join the Cubs in the National League, and therefore be unable to meet for the championship.\nOther predictions the movie made have proven more accurate. Still, at time of writing, the Cubs are one series win away from playing in the World Series, and if they are to break their 107-year-old drought by winning it all this year, that would easily be the most impressive prediction to come true.\nCheck out the videos in this post for more comparisons between the movie's fictional Oct. 21, 2015 and the real one, today.\n-- Dave Killen", "external_links": ["http://www.snopes.com/2015/10/20/marty-mcfly-returns-2015/", "http://sabr.org/research/why-curse-need-not-be-invoked-explain-cubs-woes", "http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096874"], "published": "2015-10-21T13:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T00:12:01.524+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
