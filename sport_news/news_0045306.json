There were some kids that are proving it on the next level already doing things as freshmen in the Division I field.” \nRELATED : Senior football captain Luke Daub following 'a typical Easton scenario' \nAmong that group includes former Zephyrs running back Saquon Barkley, who is now showing off that talent at Penn State. He’s one of the players Shiffert is relieved to not have to be preparing for this week. \n“Not just Saquon, but (Jake) Buskirk, they had an experienced line, they were a good football team,” Shiffert said. “But the same could be said for us. It was just a fantastic high school game.” \nLast year’s game is fresh in the mind of the Red Rovers, who watched the replay on film earlier this week. While the big playmakers are gone, quarterback Gianni Sinatore is back under center and has Easton’s full attention. \n“We know they’re real explosive,” senior linebacker Luke Daub said. “Sinatore is a real good quarterback, so our defense is going to have to try to contain him.” \nThrough five games this year, Sinatore is 69 of 123 passing for 1,109 yards, seven touchdowns and eight interceptions while rushing 68 times for 414 yards and seven touchdowns. \n“He’s just got uncanny vision, the way he gets away from people,” Shiffert said. “Not only does he get away from them, but then he finds people downfield. We’re trying to simulate it on the practice field; it’s really tough.” \nEaston scouted the Zephyrs in their loss to Central Catholic in Week 2, but saw a different team in their Week 5 matchup with Parkland. \n“That was a lot better team that played Parkland the other night,” Shiffert said. “We knew they’d still be good. They’re still Whitehall kids, they know how to play the game, they’re tough kids.” \nEaston player to watch: Nate Moser . In trying to contain Sinatore, one of the biggest keys for the Red Rovers will be defensive backs sticking with wide receivers. If they don’t, Sinatore can usually buy time scrambling before getting off a pass on a play that most thought was dead. If Moser and the rest of the secondary can keep with their assignments, Sinatore may be forced to throw into tight areas with a chance for interceptions. Moser has one of two picks for Easton this year. \nWhitehall player to watch: Sinatore. There’s no getting around the fact that everything the Zephyrs do runs through him. He nearly willed his team to a win over Parkland last week and will look to do the same this week. He’ll need some help around him, with playmakers like sophomore wide receiver Dez Boykin on the rise, but if Whitehall is going to win this game, Sinatore must have a big night. \nEaston will win if … It can keep Sinatore off the field with some long drives courtesy of the run game. The Red Rovers will have to have a better balance of run-pass than they did last week, but the run is always going to be their bread and butter. And when Sinatore is on the field, the defense has to play to the whistle. \nWhitehall will win if … Its defense steps up and takes away the run. The Zephyrs would love to make Easton pass the ball and force them into situations out of their comfort zone. On offense, Sinatore will have to take care of the ball while a rushing threat in addition to him could help loosen things up.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T00:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T02:11:16.580+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
