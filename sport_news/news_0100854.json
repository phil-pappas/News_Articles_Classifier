The offense had been adequate, but defensively, the Raiders had struggled to stop anyone. Until Saturday. With a stellar second half that saw the Raiders blank the Highlanders, Barnstable rolled to its first win of the season, a 32-22 victory at Leo P. Shields Field. “A game like this is huge for the confidence of the team,” said Barnstable head coach Chris Whidden. “We’ve shown our ability in spurts this season, but today we were much more consistent. Winning the first game is the hardest. You have to learn how to do it. Now we’ve taken that step and we need to learn from it.” There were plenty of standouts on both sides of the ball, but the first star goes to the offensive line that protected newly named starting quarterback Bryce Conroy and opened plenty of holes for the running back tandem of Ryan Dauphinais and Jack Pipatti. The Raiders churned out 354 yards in offense, 245 of them on the ground with Dauphinais collecting 166 yards on 30 carries. The senior running back scored two touchdowns (15 and 16 yards) and was a big reason why the Raiders held the ball for 14 more plays in the game than Somerville. Pipatti chipped in with five carries for 56 yards and a successful two-point conversion rush. “I have to give a lot of credit to that group that played on the offensive line,” said Whidden. “They made some nice opportunities for the running backs, who found the creases that were created for them.” That discrepancy in offensive snaps led to the Raiders (1-4) wearing down the smaller Highlanders’ squad which led to complete domination in the final quarter, when Somerville managed just 44 yards of offense. Junior signal-caller Conroy was efficient when he was asked to throw the ball, completing 9-of-11 passes for 109 yards, including a perfect 35-yard scoring strike to Will O’Day with just 55 seconds remaining in the first half. Somerville, which was also seeking its first win of the season, presented a number of problems for the Barnstable defense in the first half as the visitors answered each Barnstable score with one of their own. After Dauphinais scored his first TD on the second play of the second quarter, the Highlanders (0-5) staged an eight-play, 80-yard drive capped by Carls Alphonse’s 3-yard rumble into the end zone. The co-captain, one of only six seniors on the squad, finished the day with 12 carries for 96 yards. His running mate, junior Christopher David, also had a solid game, carrying the ball 10 times for 87 yards that included a TD and a two-point conversion. The second quarter saw most of the game’s scoring as 40 of the game’s 54 points were put up on the scoreboard. After Somerville tied the game at 6-6, Barnstable took only 15 seconds to regain the advantage as Nate Balthazard raced 85 yards with the ensuing kickoff to give the Raiders a 12-6 advantage. Again the Highlanders answered, this time with a six-play, 49-yard drive capped off with David’s score and a successful 2-point conversion on an Elijah Jeffreys to Justin Berry pass. That set the stage for the Raiders to take the lead with 55 seconds remaining on the Conroy to O’Day TD aerial. However, Somerville again had excellent field position after the ensuing kickoff and two penalties that cost the Raiders another 20 yards. Jeffreys torched the Raider defense for a 22-yard scoring pass to Jiovanni Pierre with 5 seconds remaining in the half to take a 22-18 advantage at the break. Some defensive adjustments at the break proved to be the right elixir for the Raider defense as they held Somerville to just 77 yards over the final two quarters. Dauphinais’ second rushing TD gave Barnstable the lead for good. Conroy finished off the scoring in the final quarter when he kept the ball and went in untouched from five yards out to complete a 14-play, 65-yard drive. “A performance like that is huge for our confidence,” Whidden added. “Now we have to get ready for Bridgewater-Raynham. We’re looking to continue what we started today.” By Geoff Converse", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T05:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T17:02:28.602+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
