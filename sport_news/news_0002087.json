On a 2-on-1 break, Victor Ulloa broke free and shot inside the right goal post past San Jose goalkeeper David Bingham. \n\"Coming in here playing against 11's tough,\" Quakes coach Dominic Kinnear said, \"and then when you have 10, it makes the job that much harder.\" \nThe Earthquakes played without Anibal Godoy, who was suspended for one match because he had accumulated five yellow cards. \nThe loss kept the Quakes (13-13-8) at 47 points and in seventh place in the Western Conference. Dallas (18-10-6) led the conference with 60 points. \nSan Jose wouldn't have reached the playoffs even with a victory. Portland, Seattle and Kansas City, the three teams the Earthquakes were chasing, all won Sunday. \nWas this season a disappointment? \n\"Yes,\" Kinnear said. \"You're close to making the playoffs, and when you do make the playoffs, really anything can happen. Going home and cleaning our lockers is not what we envisioned.\" \nSaid forward Quincy Amarikwa, \"The number one goal is to make playoffs. I felt we did really well to put ourselves in a great position to do that.\" \nAmarikwa gave San Jose a 1-0 lead in the 13th minute. Advertisement \nTwo minutes earlier, Dallas goalkeeper Jesse Gonzalez stopped Amarikwa from short range. Then Fatai Alashe sent the ball from the right sideline to the center of the field, off Chris Wondolowski's chest, to Amarikwa in the penalty area. He outmaneuvered Dallas' Matt Hedges, and shot low to Gonzalez's left. \n\"As a forward, you have a short memory,\" Amarikwa said. \"I didn't even remember that he'd stopped me before. I just beat the 'D', and made sure I put it away.\" \nThe goal was the 11th this season for Amarikwa -- sixth with the Earthquakes, all on the road. Wondolowski had his second assist in two matches after going without one for his first 30. \nSan Jose dominated the early play, and outshot Dallas 5-3 for the match. \nGonzalez stopped Quakes scoring leader Wondolowski twice in the first half. \n\"I thought we deserved to be 1-0 up, maybe one more,\" Kinnear said, \"but then you have to give credit. They move the ball around good.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T06:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T07:08:42.979+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
