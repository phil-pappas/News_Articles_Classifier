Nkemdiche suffered a concussion after being tackled on a rush attempt in the first half of last Saturday’s 37-24 loss to Memphis. \n“Using an image of a student-athlete knocked out with a concussion is no way to sell papers,” Bjork wrote. “Concussions and head injuries are extremely serious, and it’s unfortunate that you would use your platform to sensationalize them.” \nThe injury forced Nkemdiche to miss the remainder of the game, leaving the Rebels without one of their best players on defense. The Tigers scored 17 consecutive points in the second quarter, taking a 24-14 lead into halftime that they wouldn’t lose. \nCommercial Appeal sports editor David Williams directed a request for comment about the layout to managing editor Mark Russell, who didn’t immediately provide comment. \nThe Opelika-Auburn (Alabama) News used a photo of Rebels wide receiver Laquon Treadwell suffering a leg injury with a headline of “FINDING A WAY” on its sports front following the Rebels’ 35-31 loss to Auburn last season. \nBjork wrote a letter to the editor following that incident as well. \nSunday's Sports section front page in The Commercial Appeal.
