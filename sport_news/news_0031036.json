He also grabbed 4 boards and had 2 steals. \n3) Kent Bazemore \nBazemore said he spent the summer working on his jump shots, and he showed signs of his hard working paying off in the first game. He went 5-8 overall and 2-3 from three. \n4) Al Horford \nAfter a slow start, Horford exploded in the third quarter. He finished 5-10 overall and grabbed 8 boards to go with his 15 points. \n5) Shelvin Mack \nMack is a constant reminder of just how deep the Hawks are at point guard.
