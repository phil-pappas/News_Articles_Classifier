They were in the company of Odom’s longtime ex-girlfriend, Liza Morales.News 3 caught the family moving into the Las Vegas area medical facility. Later, bodyguards kept close while Destiny and Lamar Odom Junior were driven away. At a nearby apartment complex, paparazzi lined the walls, gathered behind the hospital hoping to see a glimpse of Odom’s famous in-laws. \"Of course they're a headache. They're always a headache. I feel like Kanye West right now!\" said Tom Adam, a resident of the complex. Adam says he never imagined that his complex parking lot would turn into a paparazzi vantage point. \"It's been pandemonium. It's been crazy. You have paparazzi jumping in the bushes,\" he said.While paparazzi look to take their photos outside, ex-NBA star Lamar Odom is fighting to survive inside the hospital’s intensive care unit. Hospital sources tell News 3 that the former LA Laker has shown no sign of waking up from the coma he’s been in for at least a day. Fans gathered outside of the hospital say they are hoping for a miracle. \"Hoping he gets better that everything works out for him -- praying for him and his family.\"\"I'm from California, so I'm a Lakers fan. I feel bad for the guy getting caught in a brothel in that situation. I hope the man gets through.\" NEWS3EXCLUSIVE PHOTO: Destiny Odom (Lamar's) daughter leaving Sunrise Hospital.
