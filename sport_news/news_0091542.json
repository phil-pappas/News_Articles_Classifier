If he throws strikes, his stuff plays. He’s made 11 starts. He’s thrown three quality starts. He’s been average five times. And he’s been lit up on three occasions. Twice it was because he lost command.\nThat’s what happened Friday night in Cleveland, when Owens was wild to finish his rookie season. It was a poor final impression, but one he’ll have to learn from.\nHe threw few strikes -- just 61 of them on 107 pitches -- and was knocked around for seven runs on 10 hits and four walks in the Sox’ 8-2 loss, which guaranteed they’ll finish the season with a losing record for the third time in four years.\nAt least Owens hung in there. He clearly never had it going.\nHe walked two in the first inning and Carlos Santana smacked a single up the middle, but Mookie Betts uncorked a perfect throw home and nailed Francisco Lindor at the plate for his 10th outfield assist of the season, third-most among major league center fielders. No damage was done.\nSantana got him again in the third, though, when he crushed a bases-loaded double to left-center. Owens had thrown his below-average fastball 88 mph high in the zone and Santana didn’t miss.\nOwens ran out of gas completely in the fifth. Walk, double, single, double, single and Owens was finished. His fastball usually sits in the low-90s but was a bit slower in this one, and his offspeed pitches couldn’t get enough outs.\nThe Red Sox must be happy to know that Owens can compete in the majors, finishing his rookie season with a 4.57 ERA and 50 strikeouts with 24 walks in 63 innings. But fellow rookie Eduardo Rodriguez should have the leg up when competition for the 2016 rotation opens next spring.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T05:40:01.514+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
