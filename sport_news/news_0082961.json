UCLA delivered a remarkable performance in a 56-30 win at Arizona while overcoming the loss of linebacker Myles Jack to the team's latest season-ending injury. The Bruins had some issues with Arizona's QB run game, but their secondary should be good enough to control Mike Bercovici's passing and keep them unbeaten. UCLA 31, Arizona State 24. Oregon at Colorado, 8 p.m. MDT, ESPN Who knows what to think of the Ducks, at this point? Utah fans are hoping Oregon is really good, but just was made to look bad in that 62-20 defeat last week in Eugene. Going into the season, nobody would have viewed this as a competitive game, but Colorado has gained some confidence with three victories (after a loss at Hawaii) going into conference play. Still, it is difficult to believe that the Buffaloes have climbed to Oregon's level – or that the Ducks have fallen that far. Oregon 42, Colorado 28. Arizona at Stanford, 8:30 p.m. MDT, Pac-12 Networks Arizona is another team that nobody's sure about, after the Wildcats played their usual, weak nonconference schedule and then were overwhelmed by UCLA. Stanford, is contrast, has found itself after a season-opening loss at Northwestern. Arizona quarterback Anu Solomon is questionable after sustaining a concussion last week.
