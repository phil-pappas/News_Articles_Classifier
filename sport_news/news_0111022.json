Opposition parties have accused the government of failing to take IS seriously.\nWhile Ankara's police chief and two other officials were sacked afer the bombing, Davutoglu and President Recep Tayyip Erdogan have fiercely resisted calls for the interior minister's departure.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T18:14:21.674+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
