Royal Melbourne hosted the matches in 1998 and in 2011, and the fabled course is expected to be the venue for 2019 once details are worked out. \nThe International team won its only Presidents Cup at Royal Melbourne in 1998. \nThe Presidents Cup began in 1994. Four years later, it started alternating between the United States and courses around the world except for Europe. \nIt will be played at Liberty National just outside New York in 2017. \nSouth America is the only continent involved in the Presidents Cup that has not hosted the matches.
