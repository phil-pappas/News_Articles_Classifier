He only threw the ball once and connected with senior running back Elie Lavarin for an eight-yard gain in the first quarter to get a first down at the Toms River East 40-yard line.\nAfter that pass, he carried the ball three consecutive times and eventually got a first down at the Toms River East 11-yard line. And four plays after that, the Mustangs capped a 10-play, 50-yard drive with a 23-yard field goal by senior kicker Matt Cuppari. That field goal gave Brick Memorial at 17-0 lead with 10:46 left in the second quarter.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T02:17:03.897+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
