Humphreys was sitting in the right-field seating area at the K when he reached out and caught Mike Moustakas' homer.\nThe Blue Jays challenged the home run call, saying Humphreys reached into the field of play and interfered. Humphreys was sitting directly behind a railing that separates the seating area from the wall. According to stadium rules, a ball that hits the railing is a home run.\nBut once the umpires upheld Mike Moustakas' second-inning home run, Humphreys was feeling pretty good.\nHe told interviewers that he didn't reach over the wall to snatch the ball.\n\"I got really worried it was going to be taken away,\" he said about the umpire review. \"I feared they were going to lose by one and I was going to be the kid who took it away.\"\nBut the umps didn't take it away and the home run stood.\n\"I'm on top of the world,\" the former Blue Springs baseball said. \"I never expected to have this experience.\"\nHe said he planned to keep the ball for a long time unless Moustakas wants it back, saying he would gladly return it to the Royals third baseman.\n\"I'm definitely glad it happened,\" Humphreys said.\nWhat do you think?
