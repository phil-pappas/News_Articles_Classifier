Not only did the Cougars defeat the Stallions for the first time since they opened in 1999, Croatan also won its seventh game – the most in one season. Additionally, the Cougars (7-2, 2-1) saw junior Sam Nay break the program’s single-season rushing record of 1,239. Garrett Bridges held the mark since 2010. “This group has gotten used to winning. We were not overconfident coming into this game ,” said Croatan coach David Perry, whose team was coming off a 29-6 loss to Northside. “Our kids got their edge back after Northside , but we’re not done and we have more business to attend to .” Nay needed 89 yards to break the school rushing mark, and he made it no contest by running for 117 yards and two touchdowns on 12 carries. Nay scored on runs of 4 and 20 yards against the Stallions (3-6, 0-3). “I don’t want to take all the credit ,” Nay said. “ I’m the one running the ball , but without our line and the guys blocking for me, I wouldn’t be were I am now. ” Meanwhile, junior quarterback Tommy Clark completed all three of his passes for touchdowns to senior Duncan Nelson. The balanced offense and a Croatan defense that held Southwest scoreless until late in the third quarter was too much for the Stallions to overcome. Croatan got on the board early following a Southwest turnover on the game’s opening possession. Southwest q uarterback Deaje ’ Foskey’s pass was intercepted and returned to the Southwest 4-yard line. On the next play, Nay ran it to give the Cougars a 7-0 lead. Croatan then cruised through the first half with Clark connecting with Nelson for touchdown passes of 15, 34 and 17 yards. “We all played well tonight. I give credit to our offensive line ,” Nelson said. “T hey let Sam run the ball and allowed Tommy to throw the ball. They are the reason we won the game tonight .” Croatan also got help from Ethan “Ironhead” Bridges , who rushed nine times for 104 yards and one touchdown and junior Robert Brennenman , who gained 42 yards on eight carries and scored late in the game . Southwest’s offense had not scored in its last two games – losses to East Duplin and North Brunswick – a nd was foiled by Croatan’s defense until Foskey capped an 8-play, 46-yard drive with a 7-yard touchdown run with 2:28 remaining in the third quarter to cut Croatan’s lead to 34-7. Southwest coach Charlie Dempsey was unavailable for comment after he had to leave the game in the third quarter after he was notified of a family emergency . Assistant coaches Jeff Whitehead and Mark Price directed the Stallions for the remainder of the game. Page 2 of 2 - “ The only way this team is going to get better is by busting our tails next week in practice and by doing all the right things ,” Price said. “ That’s the only way it is going to get better .” Next Friday, Croatan travels to East Duplin while Southwest hosts Dixon.
