I think we would have people knocking down the door for him.”In six games, Smith leads the team with 51 solo tackles and 80 stops in all. He also has two forced fumbles, one fumble recovery and one interception. Last week, East Paulding defeated Lithia Springs 53-0 to improve to 6-1 but Smith’s statistics from this contest are not available.“I think we have more chemistry on both sides of the ball this year,” said Smith, who has three years of varsity experience. “The coaching staff puts together a good game plan. We work hard on it and we work hard in the weight room. We key on film as well.”Smith’s season high of 18 total tackles came against North Paulding but he said his best game was against Allatoona when he made 13 stops and the Raiders won 17-10.“Last year, Russell Halimon ran for 191 yards so I was like he is not going to do this to me again,” Smith said. “I just made a lot of tackles. I played with more intensity than I did last year. I made a lot of tackles in the backfield and he only had 96 yards. Our defense stepped up this year.”“Sonny does a lot of things on the field outside of just making tackles,” Lindsey said. “He will block. He’s an unselfish kid and works hard for us. He works hard in the weight room.”Fellow seniors Kody Brown, Javon Brown and Keith Knight Jr. have been instrumental on the defensive side of the ball as well. As far as Smith, he wants to continue playing football in college. He said Kentucky Christian University and Stetson University have shown interest in his abilities. Smith has a 3.1 grade-point average and plans to major in engineering.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T22:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T16:06:23.312+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
