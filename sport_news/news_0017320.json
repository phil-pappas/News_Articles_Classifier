Milan. \n\"He was a beast in the back and got everything,\" Echavarria said. \"I remember watching him and was always amazed when he played. He was my role model that got me playing the sport I now love.\" \nDespite growing up in Mexico City — one of the most popular soccer cities in the world — Echavarria, the youngest in his family, was the first in his family to try it out. \n\"My mother played college basketball in Mexico and I was the first to try it out. I fell in love with it and since then my family has really taken up the sport,\" he said.

It didn't take long before Dixie State came calling to form a match made in heaven. \n\"I was so excited when they offered me a scholarship,\" he said. \"It was a dream come true for me to be able to play at the next level and to continue playing the game that I love.\" \nEchavarria, a senior, has helped lead the Red Storm to one of their best starts in school history. DSU (7-1-1, 5-0-1 PacWest) sits alone in first place in the Pacific West Conference after winning its fifth consecutive game last week at home. \n\"He's our leader and is just so steady,\" DSU soccer coach Josh Pittman said. \"He has such a massive influence on the game and we need him out there. The boys really respond well to him and he has great leadership characteristics. As a coach, you really couldn't ask for anything more.\" Buy Photo \nThe Dixie State Men's Soccer team practices at the Hansen Stadium on Tuesday.

(Photo: Chris Caldwell / The Spectrum & Daily News) \nPittman, who is in his first year as the men's soccer coach, knew right away that Echavarria was his guy when he first stepped foot on campus. \n\"I'll always remember our first team meeting when I asked for somebody that I could communicate with for the entire team,\" Pittman said. \"Then all at once, everyone yelled in unison 'Jorge.' Right then I knew he was the guy that the whole team looked to.\" \nAfter a rough sophomore and junior season in which the Red Storm won a combined four games, Echavarria credits team unity and the changes Coach Pittman has brought to the rising success. \n\"We lost a lot of close games the last two years,\" he said. \"Coach Pittman has really helped us in all aspects of our game and it's starting to show.\" \nIt's starting to show may be an understatement. \nAfter winning its fifth-straight game at home last week, DSU set a school record with five-consecutive shutout victories. Echavarria's presence in those games has led DSU to keep opponents scoreless for over 500 minutes.

(Photo: Justin Giles / Spectrum & Daily News) \nFor his performance, the PacWest Conference named Echavarria the PacWest Defensive Player of the Week. \n\"It's certainly well deserved,\" Pittman said. \"(Jorge) loves to be in the mix and is always in the right place at the right time. He's physical – not dirty by any means — and uses his body well to give opponents nightmares.\" \nOne of two captains on the team, Echavarria's teammates call him \"Papi\" — a Spanish word for father. \n\"I don't know where that came from, but I'll take it,\" he said smiling. \nPapi will look to keep the shutout streak going as DSU heads out on a four-game road swing starting with Notre Dame De Namur on Thursday. \nFollow Justin Giles on Twitter @Justingiles22 .
