Here are some highlights:\nOn his offseason plans, his hopes to remain healthy...\nHolland: Yeah, wrap me up in bubble wrap. I just want to be healthy. I just want to get back to being me and getting out there. This offseason, I'm going to do a little different stuff, I'm going to go work out with Cole [Hamels]. Work on getting my changeup back to the way it was when I first signed.\nOn how the relationship between Holland and Cole Hamels started...\nHolland: The guy that I've always looked up to; has been a great role model for me both on and off the field is Michael Young. He reached out to me and was telling me about Cole, I think we had talked about the rumors where we were possibly going to get Cole, and he was like you should talk to him, work with him, I'll give you his number and you can start working with him...as soon as we became teammates, Mike was like now's your chance. Get with the guy. Start picking his brain. And, as bad as it was, I was like Cole's son, I never left that guy's side because I wanted to get all the information I could out of him to become a better pitcher. That's how my changeup really got much better was playing catch with him this season. Once he got here, every day we were throwing changeups...Now the offseason is here. We became pretty good friends and we're going to make something of it.\nOn the other pieces of the Cole Hamels trade...\nHolland: The thing that blows me away, I think the bigger impact of that trade was not Cole Hamels. It was getting our bullpen. You got [Sam] Dyson which - thank you, Miami, for getting rid of him, I don't know why you did that, but thank you - then to get [Jake] Diekman, those are two solid guys that really amped up our bullpen big time. Then to have [Shawn Tolleson] finish it off, that's awesome right there.\nRangers eliminated from postseason\nRangers loss reviewed Rangers offseason issue No. 2: Improving team balance could cost this key contributor\nRangers could have another major pitching free agent to deal with\nRangers offseason issue No. 1: Is there enough starting pitching?
