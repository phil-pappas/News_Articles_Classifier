NEWARK – For the Devils, this was progress.\nThey finally picked up their first point of the season, but are still looking for their first win following a 2-1 shootout loss to the San Jose Sharks on Friday night at Prudential Center.\nDefenseman Brent Burns lifted a backhand over goaltender Cory Schneider’s blocker for the deciding goal in the shootout, which the Sharks won 2-1 to improve to 4-0-0 under former Devils coach Pete DeBoer.\nThe Devils are now 0-3-1 under their new coach John Hynes, but at least they got the one point from the shootout loss and avoided losing their first four games in regulation for the first time in team history.\n“It’s nice not to have a zero in that [points] column, for sure, but I don’t think we’ll be satisfied until we have two points and get that first win into that column on the left,” Schneider said.\nHynes’ postgame message was similar in that he said it was “definitely a game we can build off of,.” but there is still work to do.\n“Tonight was one of the better games for us,” he said. “So, is it good enough, yet? No. Is it a step in the right direction? Yes.”\nThe Devils appeared headed for a shutout loss when they finally broke through with Adam Henrique’s power-play deflection goal with just 3:38 left in regulation. Henrique, who Hynes called “a difference-maker” deflected Damon Severson’s right-point shot in over goaltender Martin Jones’ right shoulder. Jones, who had shutouts in his previous two starts, saw his shutout streak end at 234 minutes and 33 seconds.\n“I told myself right before that I wasn’t moving wherever the shot was coming,” Henrique said. “I just tried to get in [Jones’] eyes a bit and, fortunately enough, got a tip on it.”\n\nDeBoer returned for his first game at The Rock since he was fired by the Devils on Dec. 26 of last season and probably recognized the offensive futility.\nThrough their first four games, the Devils have scored only six goals and just one 5-on-5.\nThey still have yet to lead this season.\n“We’re close, but it’s still not enough,” Henrique said. “We’ve still got to find a way to get a little more. So, it’s coming. The effort was there tonight, I thought, throughout the game. We’ve just got to find a way to get that first one.\nSchneider (33 saves) could not be faulted on Patrick Marleau’s goal, which came just 2:01 into the game.\nDevils defenseman David Schlemko turned the puck over to Sharks center Tomas Hertl behind the net and Hertl passed in front to Marleau for a quick shot in over Schneider’s right shoulder.\nAfter managing only five shots on goal in the first period, the Devils generated 12 against Jones in the second, but could not break through.\nSchneider kept it 1-0 by making a left-pad save on Marleau on a penalty shot with 6:18 left in the second. Marleau was awarded the penalty shot after being hooked from behind by defenseman Andy Greene.\nMarleau curled to his right and weaved in on Schneider before snapping off a shot that hit the top of his pad. Schneider has stopped nine of the 11 penalty shots he has faced in his career.\nThe Devils appeared as if they tied it on a short-handed rebound goal by Jacob Josefson with 48.5 seconds remaining in the period, but the goal was disallowed because Stephen Gionta had made contact with Jones after his initial shot. After getting an explanation from the officials, Hynes opted not to use his coach’s challenge, so the score remained 1-0.\nThe Devils had a great chance to tie it with three consecutive power plays early in the third period, including two 5-on-3s during which they failed to register a shot on goal, and continued to be frustrated until a Sharks’ too-many-men penalty with 4:32 remaining gave them another chance and Henrique finally cashed in.\nEmail: gulitti@northjersey.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T01:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T07:54:40.672+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
