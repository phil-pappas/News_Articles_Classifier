Now UTC is a top five program. They were voted fifth in the latest coaches poll, the school's hightest ranking in the FCS era. When Russ Huesman took over at Chattanooga in 2009, the Mocs had won a total of six games the prior three seasons. Said Huesman-\"We were the most loved team in the country. It was like, hey guys, come on in Chattanooga. We like ya'll. I hated App State. I hated them because they were so good. That's what I said. I said I want everybody to hate us like they hate App.\" Now in 2015, UTC is ranked fifth in the country, and they've won their last ten conference games. Said quarterback Jacob Huesman-\"Winning is the expectation. Seven, eight, or nine years ago, I don't know if that was the expectation as much as a fun thing that happened every now and again.\" Said defensive lineman Josh Freeman-\"Going from the hunter to being the hunted, you can definitely feel that when you show up. You get everybody's best shot. You feel that when you're out there on the field.\" When you get good players with good attitudes, winning is a by-product. Said Russ Huesman-\"Our team chemistry is fantastic. I think that's one of the most important things.\" While the Mocs enjoy their top five ranking, they know they have to keep it in perspective. Said Freeman-\"It's just a ranking. If we don't show up and do what we've got to do this week, we won't be number five for very long. We understand that. We understand what comes with it.\" Coach Huesman admits he should appreciate what his team is doing a little more than he has been. \"I'm never happy. I'm kind of always miserable. I've got to get better. I've got to enjoy them more and let our staff and players enjoy them more, but I don't know if I can do that or not.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T01:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T10:53:47.592+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
