De Villiers’ unbeaten 73-ball century provided the late impetus as South Africa posted 303/5, the highest team total at the Green Park Stadium, after deciding to bat first. Sharma led India’s strong reply with a brilliant 150 before leg-spinner Imran Tahir turned the run-fest on its head by claiming two wickets in his final over. Paceman Kagiso Rabada then dismissed two Indian batsmen, MS Dhoni and Stuart Binny, in two deliveries in the final over to put South Africa 1-0 up in the five-match series. India needed 22 runs off the last two overs with five wickets in hand. Dale Steyn conceded 11 in the penultimate over before 20-year-old Rabada claimed back-to-back wickets to restrict the hosts to 298/7. “I thought Imran Tahir first of all changed the game and gave us a chance,” said De Villiers, who was adjudged man-of-the-match for his unbeaten 104-run blitz. “And a lot of credit to Dale and Kagiso. The youngster proved quite a handful and he has got a bright future,” added the South Africa captain who set the stadium alight with his superb stroke-making. Containing De Villiers is one of the toughest jobs in international cricket and India were severely handicapped when their strike bowler Ravichandran Ashwin suffered a side strain and left the field after sending down only 4.4 overs. Ashwin struck in his first over to dismiss Quinton de Kock but Faf du Plessis (62) and Hashim Amla (37) shared a half-century stand. De Villiers did not hit a boundary in the first 33 balls he faced but was unstoppable when he got going. The right-hander clobbered his sixth six off the final ball of the innings to bring up his 21st ODI century as South Africa plundered 109 runs from the last 10 overs. When India came out to bat, Sharma added 149 runs with Ajinkya Rahane (60) and the hosts looked on course to chase down the target without any fuss. Sharma hit six sixes and 13 boundaries before giving a return catch to Tahir who also dismissed Suresh Raina in the same over. India captain MS Dhoni (31) struggled throughout his scratchy knock and fell in the final over. Off-spinner Harbhajan Singh will join the Indian squad as Ashwin’s cover before the second match in Indore on Wednesday. — Reuters Scoreboard\nSOUTH AFRICA\nQ de Kock c Raina b Ashwin 29 H Amla b Mishra 37 F du Plessis lbw b Yadav 62 AB de Villiers not out 104 D Miller st Dhoni b Mishra 13 JP Duminy c Dhoni b Yadav 15 F Behardien not out 35 Extras (lb 3, w 5) 8 Total (five wickets; 50 overs) 303 Fall of wickets: 1-45, 2-104, 3-152, 4-197, 5-238 Bowling\nB Kumar 10-0-67-0 U Yadav 10-0-71-2 R Ashwin 4.4-0-14-1 A Mishra 10-0-47-2 S Binny 8-0-63-0 S Raina 7-0-37-0 V Kohli 0.2-0-1-0 INDIA R Sharma c & b Imran Tahir 150 S Dhawan lbw b Morkel 23 A Rahane c Miller b Behardien 60 V Kohli c Morkel b Steyn 11 MS Dhoni c & b Rabada 31 S Raina c Duminy b Imran Tahir 3 S Binny c Amla b Rabada 2 B Kumar not out 1 Amit Mishra not out 0 Extras (lb 4, w 13) 17 Total 7 wickets; 50 overs) 298 Fall of wickets: 1-42, 2-191, 3-214, 4-269, 5-273, 6-297, 7-297 Bowling D Steyn 10-0-54-1 K Rabada 10-0-58-2 F Behardien 6-0-38-1 M Morkel 10-0-51-1 JP Duminy 4-0-36-0 Imran Tahir 10-0-57-2 Numbers game 5 South Africa’s five-run victory is their smallest in terms of runs vs India in ODIs, improving on the 10-run victory at Nagpur on March 19, 2000. 2 India’s 298/7 is their second highest losing total vs South Africa behind 310 at Nagpur on March 19, 2000. 1 Rohit is the first Indian batsman to have recorded fifty-plus average in three successive calendar years in ODIs — 52.00 in 2013; 52.54 in 2014 and 59.16 in 2015. He is averaging 69.26 in 29 ODIs on Indian soil — his tally being 1593, including four hundreds and seven fifties. 4 De Villiers is the fourth captain to hit ten hundreds or more in ODIs, joining Australia’s Ricky Ponting (22), India’s Sourav Ganguly (11) and Sri Lanka’s Sanath Jayasuriya (10). 11 After hitting a century (107 off 126 balls vs Pakistan at Adelaide in the World Cup), Virat Kohli is without a half-century in eleven consecutive innings — an unwanted feat registered by him for the first time in ODIs.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T00:14:05.275+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
