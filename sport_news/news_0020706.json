The music almost beckoned residents from their homes, calling them to come out and meet their neighbors.\n“If you know your neighbors, you have a safer community,” Orleans Parish Sheriff Marlin Gusman said.\n“It’s about all of us keeping an eye on one another,” NOPD Supt. Michael Harrison said.\nAt. St. Roch Park, residents mingled with NOPD officers - the men and women who work to keep these streets safe.\n“It’s all about reducing fear and reducing tension by having confidence in your police department,” Harrison said.\nConfidence isn’t very high across New Orleans right now. Just this past weekend alone, police were called out to 13 armed robberies, two home invasions and two aggravated burglaries. On Tuesday morning, a man was shot in New Orleans East during an attempted robbery while walking to a bus stop.\n“It makes me sick because there’s just too much going on in this city, it’s too much,” resident Yvonne Henry said.\nJavanti Augillard adds, “Innocent people are being affected by crime every day.”\nMany say they’re fed up, which is precisely the reason why they left the comfort of their homes to show up at the park. The party was one of about 200 across New Orleans.\n“When times are hard, people come together,” Augillard said.\nTonya Izzard adds, “We have to show that we're not afraid, we're not gonna run, we're not gonna hide and events like this get people to understand, they're not alone.”\nThe rest of the country stands together in this initiative. Some 16,000 communities held National Night Out events of their own. With different goals in each city, the folks here just want a safer environment for themselves and their children.\nNOPD officers split up in teams Tuesday night in an effort to stop in at each of the 200 parties across the city. Chief Harrison said it’s important people feel comfortable with officers so they can help the department with tips, to help solve crimes.\nCopyright 2015 WVUE.
