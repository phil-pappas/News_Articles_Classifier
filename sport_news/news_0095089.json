The weather is here with an unkind reminder that winter will arrive sooner than you want it to. Your Bean Boots, on the other hand, probably will not.\nAfter all, the rush is always on to get Bean Boots—aka L.L. Bean’s signature snow boots, aka New England’s most in-demand cold-weather staple. L.L. Bean struggled to keep up with pre-orders around the holidays last year, selling out in some sizes and even, in some cases, delivering after New Year’s . The company finally caught up on its backlog in July—only to be bombarded by all the teens looking for their back-to-school Bean Boots come September .\nThe thing is, these boots can’t be manufactured in overdrive like those Ugg boots you used to slip on ( unless you’re Tom , in which case, you still slip them on).\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below The Boston Globe went behind the scenes to look into the making of this winter’s Bean Boots earlier this year, and now, a new feature in The Atlantic gives more details on the Boots’ labor economics.\nMaking the Boot takes “about 85 minutes’ worth of labor, not including the breaks in between stations,” according to The Atlantic . In Brunswick, Maine, the L.L. Bean factory operates at a 170,000 square-foot space, where the boots are “handmade by 200 people who split their time between shifts.”\nHandmade labor, local sourcing, and the fact that the Boots are made in Maine (as opposed to China, where the majority of shoes sold to Americans are made) factor into the Boots’ limited supply, reports The Atlantic .\n“All the materials we use are primarily sourced in the United States, a lot of the leather comes from right here in Maine at a tannery, other parts of the Midwest, the shearling is from Texas, we produce our own boot bottoms,” says [L.L. Bean’s public relations rep Eric] Smith. “The steel comes from local artisans who work for us.”\nSo there you have it. Maybe grab yours before you lose out to everyone else looking to scuff through winter in durable yet fashionable footwear.\nQuintessential things to do in Boston:\nPrevious -- of -- Next Whether you’re from Boston or not, there are annual events and activities that define the city and the surrounding area. So drop your R's, grab your iced regular from Dunk’s, and head to these quintessential Boston events that make this city special. Joanne Rathe/Globe Staff Previous -- of -- Next We know it’s spring in Boston when swans are released into the Boston Public Garden lagoon. The Swan Boats were first launched in 1877 and have become a time-honored tradition. WIGGS, JONATHAN GLOBE STAFF PHOT Previous -- of -- Next The Greenway Carousel is made of carefully crafted, local characters—including a lobster—inspired by the drawings of Boston school children, which makes it truly one of a kind. Jessica Rinaldi For The Boston G Previous -- of -- Next When Sullivan’s in Southie starts serving its hot dogs, and those lobster rolls, you know summer is here. The South Boston institution has been in business for more than 60 years. John Tlumacki Previous -- of -- Next Boston’s Hubway bike-sharing program offers residents and visitors an active alternative to public transportation. Users can sign up for a membership online or purchase a day pass at any Hubway station. Lane Turner/Globe Staff Previous -- of -- Next Advertisement Previous -- of -- Next For New England, it doesn’t get more “quintessential” than Cape Cod. If you’ve been to Cape Cod, Nantucket, or Martha’s Vineyard, you know that kayaking, bike rides, and simplly beach lounging are a must. Greene, Bill Globe Staff Previous -- of -- Next A city that is rich in history has to have a Fourth of July celebration with a bang, and Boston’s annual event with the Boston Pops doesn’t disappoint. Matthew J. Lee Previous -- of -- Next This one is for the grown-ups: Over the last few years, Boston has seen a huge spike in craft beer and cocktail bars such as The Hawthorne and Meadhall. Aram Boghosian Previous -- of -- Next Most head to the North End for its cobblestone streets and authentic Italian food. But summer weekends each bring a different annual festival, like August’s Fisherman’s Feast. Tamir Kalifa for The Boston Globe Previous -- of -- Next The fluffernutter is the official sandwich of Massachusetts. For all those marshmallow fans out there, pay tribute to the Massachusetts invention at the annual Flufffest in Somerville’s Union Square. John Blanding Globe Staff Previous -- of -- Next Advertisement Previous -- of -- Next Boston’s neighborhoods are bustling with pride, and they don’t hesitate to show their love for their culture at local events. Check out the Trini-Style Caribbean Parade that culminates at the Franklin Park Zoo. John Tlumacki/Globe Staff Previous -- of -- Next We’re not talking about Newbury Street or the South End’s Tremont Street, which already get their share of tourists and visitors. Let’s give some of Boston’s other vibrant neighborhoods a chance. Tlumacki, John Globe Staff Previous -- of -- Next Only the brave can survive Sept. 1, the day Boston is swarmed with students moving in and out of the city. For those who do make it through, Christmas comes early: Allston sidewalks are filled with unwanted items that become treasures for others. Dina Rudick/Globe Staff Previous -- of -- Next Join 300,000 people as they cheer on 9,000 rowers on the Charles River during this annual competitive race, which lasts two days in October. The regatta is the world’s largest rowing competition. The Boston Globe Previous -- of -- Next Halloween is just a day, but in Salem celebrations last all month. They begin with a kick-off parade in early October and include a zombie walk, a pet (and human) costume contest, a Halloween ball, fairs, psychic readings, and of course, haunted houses. John Blanding/Globe Staff Previous -- of -- Next Advertisement Previous -- of -- Next It’s nearly impossible to imagine fall in the area without thinking of the changing colors of fall or biting into a piece of apple pie. Although both apple picking and leaf peeping involve leaving Boston, it will be well worth the ride. Steve Mease Previous -- of -- Next During the fall season, it may be too cold to sit outdoors at Fenway or Gillette. Instead, opt for the warmth of the TD Garden. Mark Duncan Previous -- of -- Next When Thanksgiving comes around, don’t get so caught up in cooking a turkey dinner that you forget how it all began. History will literally surround you at Plimoth Plantation, where visitors get to experience a demonstration of how colonists and Wampanoag tribe members lived in the 1600s. Pat Greenhouse/Globe Staff Previous -- of -- Next Celebrate the changing of seasons in Boston. This is one notable destination with two significant dates: The Boston Common pond is known for both its opening as a watering hole in the spring and then its conversion to an ice skating rink in the winter. Charles Krupa Previous -- of -- Next Each year, the people of Nova Scotia donate a Christmas tree to Boston as a symbol of thanks for the assistance we provided the province after a deadly explosion between two ships at the Halifax Harbor in 1918. Aram Boghosian for The Boston Gl Previous -- of -- Next Advertisement Previous -- of -- Next The City of Boston puts on 12 hours of ice sculptures, live music, a parade, and fireworks on New Year’s Eve. The event attracts about a million people, with many family-friendly activities available throughout the day. Lane Turner/Globe Staff Previous -- of -- Next After welcoming the New Year, those brave enough to jump in icey cold take a plunge in waters in South Boston, Quincy, Marshfield, and other (cold) water locations. Essdras M Suarez/Globe Staff Previous -- of -- Next Irish culture is alive and kicking in Boston, and in no place more than South Boston. The St. Patrick’s Day Parade in Southie attracts between 600,000 and 1 million specators every year and is listed as the second-largest parade in the country. Steven Senne Previous -- of -- Next No, it’s not the season opener at Fenway. It’s not even opening day for the Red Sox. True Bostonians know it’s the day the Red Sox pack their trucks at Fenway Park and head down to Florida for spring training. Wendy Maeda/Globe Staff Previous -- of -- Next Or just watch. The Boston Marathon is the top dog when it comes to marathons in the U.S. For runners, it brings out the elite athletes, for fans it brings out the elite drinkers. Elise Amendola Previous -- of -- Next Advertisement Previous -- of -- Next Skip Mother’s Day brunch, and do something new and very Boston-specific: Every Mother’s Day, hundreds take to the Boston streets for the annual Ducklings Day Parade, where families retrace the steps of the beloved characters from the classic children’s book Make Way for Ducklings. The annual event takes place in the Boston Public Garden.
