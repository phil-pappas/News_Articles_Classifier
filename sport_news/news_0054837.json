He was hosting a clinic for dozens of local children with the American Special Hockey Association. \nOvechkin is a goal-scoring superstar for the Washington Capitals and a hero in the eyes of the 60 local hockey players who took the ice with him. \n“For me, it’s good to spend time with the kids,” Ovechkin said. “See them smile. I’m smiling as well. Just forget about everything else.” \nThe ASHA league was created for players with developmental disabilities. It gives people of all ages and abilities the chance to build confidence and skills by playing hockey. \n“I think this is amazing,” Jake said. “I think playing with Ovie is special and a privilege.” \nWashington sports teams have their share of superstar athletes, but sometimes it is what they do when they are not competing that makes them stand out. — Andrea McCarren (@AndreaMcCarren) October 12, 2015 \nOvechkin wrapped up the skate by giving a $30,000 check to the league he hosted. Though he had already given the young players plenty that money can’t buy. \nThere are currently more than 54 American Special Hockey Association programs in more than 50 cities throughout the United States. \nLike this story?
