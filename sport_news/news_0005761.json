The Narendra Modi administration was not only taking a hawkish stance against Pakistan, but also refusing to come to the negotiating table. It was encouraging extremist groups to attack Pakistani visitors, including singers, writers and sportsmen, the official said. Water and Power Minister Khawaja Asif told the Senate last week that Pakistani and Indian officials had discussed plans for importing 500 MW from India in April 2012. Two years after these discussions, officials from Adani Enterprises Ltd of India visited Pakistan in April 2014 to discuss matters related to the import. In the written statement, the minister detailed how AEL had submitted a draft to the ministry, proposing the export of 500-800MWs in two-three years as a starting point, recommending an eventual scale-up to 3500-4000MWs. “But no further progress was made in this regard,” Asif said. Pakistan is facing shortfall in electricity and planning to also import it from Iran and the Central Asia. It is believed that import from India would be cheaper and faster due to short distance and similar infrastructures on both sides of the border. — PTI", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T04:11:42.843+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
