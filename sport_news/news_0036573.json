A year later, Florida threw a touchdown pass against Georgia with just over a minute left to stretch its lead over the Bulldogs to 52-17. Why?\n\"We wanted to score 50 because it had never been done,\" Spurrier said afterward. \"Isn't that what you're supposed to do?\"\nUSA TODAY\nSouth Carolina coach Steve Spurrier to retire\nAnyone who thinks defense wins championships, well, \"hasn't watched us a lot.\" Asked how his South Carolina team beat Tennessee in 2006, he replied, \"The same way Vanderbilt did.\"\nIn a world of cookie-cutter, cliché-spouting peers and colleagues, Spurrier — who will retire from coaching — always had time for a jab. Tennessee was always on Spurrier's radar. So was Georgia. Florida State. Clemson. Rivals circled around Spurrier like planets, but make no mistake: Spurrier was always the center of the universe.\nHe won at Duke, a feat that remains noteworthy — Duke , italicized — even as David Cutcliffe nears Spurrier's success decades later. He returned to his alma mater, Florida, in 1990, 24 years after winning the Heisman Trophy, viewed as the program's savior.\nFormer Florida coach Steve Spurrier is carried off the field in 2000. (Photo: Associated Press)\nHe changed the landscape of the Southeastern Conference. Bear Bryant still loomed over the conference in the decade following his death; Spurrier was the coach of a new generation, one more willing to rewrite plays, invent schemes, toss out musty philosophies and — in his most stunning quirk — pass the football.\nThe Gators went 122-27-1 from 1990-2001, winning one national title, in 1996, and six conference championships. Florida never finished below No. 14 in the Amway Coaches Poll, and six times inside the top six. After finishing No. 3 in 2001, Spurrier left for the Washington Redskins. His replacement, Ron Zook, told Spurrier he was a tough act to follow; \"I told him that's why he got hired,\" he answered.\nThe current SEC — more open, often pass-based, on the cutting edge offensively — was born from Spurrier, who took decades of unoriginality and went vertical. He led the only team in the modern era to score at least 500 points in six seasons in a row, from 1993-98. That 1996 team scored at least 28 points in every game but one, a 24-21 regular-season loss to Florida State; the Gators' revenge came in a 52-20 victory in the Sugar Bowl, claiming the national championship.\nFollow the road to the 2015 College Football Playoff at The Football Four , our home to rate and debate the nation's best. Returning to the SEC at South Carolina in 2005, Spurrier learned new tricks: The Gamecocks were built more on the ground, with defense, pulling his offense back from the edge of innovation — and still he found success, setting a school record for wins, 86, and from 2011-13 notching the greatest three-year run in program history.\nHe beat Clemson, again and again, and had the upper hand on his in-state counterpart, Dabo Swinney. When Swinney suggested that he was from Pluto and Spurrier from Mars, Spurrier replied, \"Dabo still thinks there are 9 planets out there.\"\nHe was always quotable, never boring. Always a winner, until this fall, when the Gamecocks — clearly lacking the talent needed to compete in the SEC — lost four of their first six, the latest a 45-20 defeat to LSU.\nUSA TODAY\nFournette, No. 5 LSU too much for displaced South Carolina\nSpurrier once said he didn't want to coach too far into his 60s; by that point, he'd be playing golf \"four of five times a week.\" That he lasted until 70 is a testament to his success at South Carolina. That Spurrier retired at the midway point of his 26th season as a college coach means he realized: It had grown stale — and it was time.\nHe leaves behind 228 wins, the second-most in SEC history, and that national title, and remade two programs — leading the first to historic heights. Yet the legacy is broader.\nUSA TODAY HIGH SCHOOL SPORTS\nRecruits react to Steve Spurrier's retirement, including one de-commitment\nHe liked being called an \"offensive mastermind,\" and earned the title: Spurrier led the embrace of the passing game across college football, now the in-vogue style in every conference in the country. He liked being the smartest guy in the room, and in the world of football coaches, he was.\nHe rewrote record books. Had a spotty record of antagonizing and intimidating the media. Won games. Never won a conference title with South Carolina. Took home one national title, lost another. At Florida, dominated the SEC like no coach since Bryant; at South Carolina, couldn't quite solve an Alabama, an LSU, an Auburn.\nAnd he left on his own terms, as expected, with the legacy intact. \"I want to be able to walk out of here,\" Spurrier said when he left Florida in 2001. \"I don't want have to run out. I don't want to be chewed up and spit out.\"\nSTEVE SPURRIER THROUGH THE YEARS\nSteve Spurrier compiled a record of 228-89-2 as a college football coach.
