The Mets aren't just happy to be in the postseason for the first time in nine years and they are good enough to advance. Los Angeles will be a tough out, because the Dodgers have good starting pitching too. But, the Mets' overall lineup is better and David Wright won't let his team lose. Wright is the captain for a reason, and he is the clear-cut leader of the Mets. You can tell just how focused he is, and the rest of his teammates will feed off him. It's been a long journey for Wright to return to the postseason, and he's on a team that can make a serious run at the World Series. NewsChannel 13's Rodger Wyland can be heard weekdays from 9 a.m. to noon on WOFX 980 AM.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T05:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T08:58:51.127+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
