The hosts won the toss and after losing Rohit Sharma for 3 (bowled Kagiso Rabada), Shikhar Dhawan and Ajinkya Rahane took the Indians to 59. Morne Morkel had Dhawan caught by JP Duminy for 23. Virat Kohli was next to go, run out for 12 and captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni must have been pondering the outcome of the series at 102/4. That was the moment when Imran Tahir clean bowled Rahane for 51 after 22.4 overs. Two runs later Suresh Raina was out for a duck when Morkel had him caught behind by Quinton De Kock. Dale Steyn was the pick of the Proteas bowlers with 3/49 dismissing Axar Patel (13), Harbhajan Singh (22) and Umesh Yadav (4). However it was the skipper who was leading the men in blue to a respectable total at the Holkar Cricket Stadium. Dhoni clubbed seven fours and four sixes to finish unbeaten on 92 as the home side posted 247/9. Bhuvneshwar Kumar (14) and Singhâ€™s respective 41 and 56 run partnerships with the leader of the side would prove to be crucial. In reply the South Africans reached 40 before Hashim Amla (17) was stumped by Dhoni off Patel. Just 12 runs later De Kock was gone for 34 after finding Mohit Sharma off the bowling of Harbhajan. However Faf Du Plessis and Duminy stabilised matters for the green shirts and added 82 for the third wicket before the collapse began. Duminy was trapped leg before wicket by Patel for 36. Seven runs later Du Plessis was gone for 51 when the same bowler had him caught by Kohli. David Miller was out first ball, stumped by Dhoni off Kumar and at 142/5 the picture had changed. AB De Villiers and Farhaan Behardien set up rectifying matters but the captain was soon gone for 19 when he found Kohli at a shortish extra cover off Mohit for only 19. Dale Steyn stood bravely for 13 runs but then before Yadav had him caught by Kohli, for his third catch of the innings. It was 200/8 when Behardien was caught down the leg side by the keeper off Singh for 18. Rabada was valiant at the end with 19 not out but Tahir (9) and Morkel (4) were both dismissed by Kumar (3/41) as the visitors fell short with 6.2 overs to go. Patel finished with 3/39. The third ODI takes place at Rajkot on Sunday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T18:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T04:34:47.427+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
