Lonny Haschel (HASH’-el) said Tuesday that Trooper Stephen Lister has apologized for the judgment error. \nLister on Sunday stopped a Bentley on a Dallas-area turnpike because the car appeared to violate window tint laws. Haschel says the driver, later identified as Michael, discussed the tint with the trooper. No citation was issued. \nThe trooper then had Michael step out for a picture, which was taken by a passenger. \nMichael posted on Instagram with the caption: “Got stopped just to take a picture.” \nMichael later Sunday played in the 30-6 loss to New England. \nThe Cowboys declined comment Tuesday.
