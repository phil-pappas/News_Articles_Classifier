The Panthers meet Westfall this week. (Photo: Jess Grimm/Chillicothe Gazette) \nChillicothe (5-3) at Washington Court House (4-4) \n• In 2014: Chillicothe won 56-0. \n• Last week: The Cavaliers lost 42-21 to Clinton-Massie; the Blue Lions defeated McClain 35-27. \n• Outlook: There’s no question that Chillicothe faced disappointment after last week’s double-digit loss to Clinton-Massie. In a game they absolutely needed to win in terms of playoff contention, things didn’t go as planned. But the only thing the Cavaliers can do is look forward now and next on their schedule is a .500 Washington Court House team. Rumor has it that quarterback Jack Busch suffered a season ending injury last week. That will make way for Branden Maughmer to make his debut as a signal caller. If I’m Chillicothe, running back Nate Rosenbauer is getting a heavy dose of work this week. He leads the area with 1,125 rushing yards to date. Don’t try to fix what isn’t broken. \nPaint Valley (7-1) at Adena (5-3) \n• In 2014: Paint Valley won 35-6. \n• Last week: The Bearcats defeated Westfall 45-12; the Warriors defeated Southeastern 21-7. \n• Outlook: In a battle for sole possession of second place within the SVC, Paint Valley travels to Adena in what should be one of the better match-ups this week. Both teams’ losses in conference play have come to Zane Trace. Other than that loss, Paint Valley has outscored conference opponents 160-32 compared to Adena’s mark of 131-26. The big name players are known in this matchup but here’s two x-factors: Adena’s Wyatt Shanton and Paint Valley’s Gavin Mendenhall. Shanton is a force in the trenches and Mendenhall is a healthy second option in the Bearcats’ passing game. Friday night in Frankfort should yield a great football game. \nPiketon (4-4) at Unioto (4-4) \n• In 2014: Unioto won 41-0. \n• Last week: The Redstreaks lost 42-8 to Zane Trace; the Shermans lost 15-13 to Huntington. \n• Outlook: Piketon and Unioto are both coming off ugly losses last week. While both sit at 4-4, this week is all about response. Which team can put the past to rest and respond with a strong outing? Piketon quarterback Devon Brewster looked less than stellar last week in the passing game. However, this week, he won’t be facing a stout Pioneers’ secondary. Unioto’s Clay Edler continues to impress at QB after throwing for 242 yards last week. An aerial attack could be in store here. \nSoutheastern (1-7) at Westfall (1-7) \n• In 2014: Westfall won 36-24. \n• Last week: The Panthers lost 21-7 to Adena; the Mustangs lost 45-12 to Paint Valley. \n• Outlook: Somebody has to win this game. While Southeastern and Westfall will walk into this game without a win in conference play, one or the other will walk away with a cellar standing in the SVC. The Panthers have played in close games this year but have had trouble taking care of the ball. The Mustangs have talent but can’t seem to put four consecutive solid quarters together. Southeastern’s Carson Stauffer and Westfall’s Mason Peart are without question the best two players on each team’s offense. We’ll see which team can ride its horse to victory. \nZane Trace (8-0) at Huntington (1-7) \n• In 2014: Zane Trace won 54-8. \n• Last week: The Pioneers defeated Piketon 42-8; the Huntsmen defeated Unioto 15-13. \n• Outlook: I said last week that a miracle would have to happen for Huntington to beat Unioto. It looks as if that miracle has taken place. Huntington shocked the area with a two-point victory over the Shermans last week and will look to continue that success against Zane Trace. However, Zane Trace is by no means Unioto. Beating the Pioneers would take a near perfect four quarters for the Huntsmen and then some. The Pioneers are simply too strong everywhere on the field for a 1-7 Huntington team to overcome. But it’s important to note Huntington’s resiliency. Most teams who are winless going into Week 8 have already given up hope. The Huntsmen kept pounding and got a win for their efforts. \nMinford (4-4) at Waverly (3-5) \n• In 2014: Minford won 34-0. \n• Last week: The Falcons lost 47-6 to Wheelersburg; the Tigers lost 32-29 to Portsmouth West. \n• Outlook: They aren’t who we thought they were. After starting out the year so strong at 3-1, Waverly has dropped the ball — at times, literally — in four straight contests. In their last four outings, the Tigers have been outscored 171-59 with 29 of their points scored coming in one contest. Those numbers should show a resounding fact: Waverly’s defense has been non-existent against SOC opponents. To get win number four, the Tigers will have to take down a decent Minford team at home. The Falcons’ four losses have come to teams with a combined 23-9 record and three of those have been by 10 points or less. The Tigers will have their hands full. \ndwebb@chillicothegazette.com \nTwitter: @dw1509 \nFollow the Chillicothe Gazette’s live game updates from Paint Valley at Adena (@dw1509) and Piketon at Unioto (@SirBrockNetter), Friday night on Twitter at hashtag #cghss .
