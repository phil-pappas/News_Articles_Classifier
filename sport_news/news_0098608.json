Cedarburg (32-4-1)— NOTABLE \nPLAYER OF THE WEEK: M.E. Dodge, East Troy. The Trojans senior completed a four-season sweep of the Rock Valley North, leading the team to its fourth straight title and fourth straight undefeated season. \nThe team capped a 10-0 season Thursday with a 3-0 victory over Edgerton. Dodge, an outside hitter, finished the 25-21, 25-18, 25-18 victory with 26 kills, with just eight hitting errors in 43 attempts. She posted a .419 hitting percentage. For the season, Dodge has 479 kills, an average of 5.7 per set and a .353 hitting percentage. \nTEAM OF THE WEEK: St. Thomas More. The Cavaliers capped the Metro Classic regular season Thursday with a 3-1 victory over Catholic Central that assured them no worse than a share of the conference title. It is the program's first since 2007. \nSenior outside hitter Katelyn Flayter led the team to the 25-22, 25-17,18-25, 25-16 victory by posting team highs in kills (26) and digs (16). She also had a .292 hitting percentage. \n\"She as a very nice vertical; she can hit both line and cross,\" Cavaliers coach Kristin Perkins said. \"When you first look at her on the court, she's a very quiet player, but she explodes in the front row when she goes after a ball there.\" \nLindsay Post, the team's only other senior, finished with 17 kills and 12 digs. Jensyn Wendlandt, a junior setter, had 24 assists and 14 digs. \nThe team also has received key contributions this season from sophomore Taylor Kirby, who leads the team in blocks (35), sophomore Ellie Hoffmann, who has teamed up with Wendlandt to makes the team's 6-2 offense (two setters) work, and freshman Taylor Schley, who has been key to the team's serve receive. \nAfter spending the past few seasons as a middle-of-the-pack team in the league, Thomas More (13-11 overall) played with a confidence that Perkins believes has helped its execution. The team's only league loss came, 3-2, to Racine St. Catherine's on Oct. 1 with the final game was decided, 16-14. \nThomas More's play could be a good omen for the postseason considering the league has produced state tournament teams in Division 3 (Racine St. Catherine's, 2013) and Division 4 (Catholic Central, 2012) in recent years. \nPerkins credited her seniors leading the turnaround. \nThey've really gone after it this year, she said. \nSHE'S BACK: Burlington has rebounded nicely since dropping a 3-0 loss to Westosha Central on Sept. 29 when the team was missing a number of players, including all-state outside hitter Quinn Spieker. Last Tuesday the squad defeated Union Grove, 25-16, 25-22, 25-19, to grab a share of the Southern Lakes lead. On Saturday they went undefeated at the Westosha Smash, knocking off DSHA and Catholic Memorial, 2-1, in addition to defeating Appleton North and Kenosha Tremper. \nSpieker, whom co-coach Teri Leach said was unable to swing against Westosha Central, finished the tournament with a team-high 40 kills to go along with 35 digs. \nANOTHER WIN: Greendale appears to have taken a liking to Brookfield. The Panthers have won two tournaments this season, the first at Brookfield Central on Sept. 12 and the second Saturday at Brookfield East. At the Spartan Invite, the Panthers, who are ranked third in the Division 1 state coaches poll, defeated New Berlin West, Oak Creek, Mukwonago and Brookfield East to win the tournament. \nThe Panthers defeated Mukwongo, the state's 10th-ranked team, 25-14, 25-19, in the tournament semifinals. Seniors Ally Bialo (eight kills, .462 hitting percentage) and Lauren Litzau (five kills, .625 hitting percentage) were on the mark with their shots and junior setter Dani Litzau had 14 assists. \nIn the finals against East, Litzau (nine kills) and sophomore Corinne Bialo (five) were the team's top hitters while Litzau and junior Emma Johnson had 15 and 10 assists, respectively.
