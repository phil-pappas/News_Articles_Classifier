Last year -- it lost its title sponsor and was moved from its traditional early December date, and there was also an issue with the venue. But the oldest sporting event on the island has resolved its issues and all those troubles did not seem to affect Lu Wei-chih and Andrea Pavan who would share the lead after the opening round. \nAustralian Scott Hend makes a solid start to his title defending, moving to four-under-par following his fourth birdie of the day, at the 15th hole. \nLevel-par at the turn, Ian Poulter shots a bogey-free back nine with three birdies to finish the day on three-under. \nHe is one shot behind Ryder Cup team-mate Graeme McDowell, who was in a seven-way tie for sixth place, two shots off the lead -- thanks to that great putt. \nPan Cheng-tsung goes close to claiming a share of the lead, but a bogey at the last saw the golfer from Chinese Taipei slip back to five-under. 1 off the pace \nPan's compatriot Lu Wei-Chih would grab a share of the lead -- thanks to some solid play with the flat stick. \nHe was also pretty good with his iron play -- this nice approach sets him up for a birdie, as he would tweet on three consecutive holes to help him move to 6-under after a 64. He was tied with Italy's Andrea Pavan for the lead. \nThe second round of the event is underway, with Justin Rose now the leader, then a pair of golfers a shot back at minus 8, including overnight co-leader Wei, who is still on the course through 8. The well-dressed Ian Poulter is at 7-under. And the other co-leader from the opening Andrea Pavan has played four holes and is 3 back of top spot.
