Powell has passed for 1,172 yards, 16 touchdowns and just two interceptions. \n“If there’s a quarterback in the country playing better I’d like to see him,” Patton said. “He’s playing well, and those around him are playing well.” \n“He’s one of the top quarterbacks in the state,” Southside coach Jeff Williams said. “He’s got a lot of weapons around him, and when he gets those guys out in space they can do damage.” \nPowell has completed 71 percent of his passes, with half going to three players — Barrett Banister (15 for 198); Terrance Rock (15-170) and; Tyson Morris (14-318). \n“We have tackled well in space, that’s a big key,” Williams said. “We have to rush the passer well. They’re big up front and they can run the ball really well.” \nSouthside quarterback Cooper Johnson has already passed for 1,002 yards. He’s been intercepted just once. \n“The (Southside) quarterback is playing really well,” Patton said. “Defensively we’ve got our work cut out for us, because they do so many different things offensively. I’ve known Jeff Williams a long time, and one thing you know about him is his team’s are going to get after you.” \nPatton said the Purple Dogs appear to be pretty healthy. \n“We’re healthy and ready to go,” Patton said. “If we’re not, we’ll use the next man up approach.” \nThe same can’t be said for the Rebels. Although running back Tanner Grandstaff returns today following an August knee injury, the Rebels won’t have the services of senior linebacker Andrew Clark. The team’s third leading tackler (26 unassisted stops and eight for negative yardage) said he tore his meniscus in the first quarter. He played the rest of the game, but was scheduled to have surgery today. \nHe said he hopes to return for the Northside game. \nToday marks what is likely the final conference game ever between Southside and Fayetteville. The two schools have been playing since 1964. \n“Just mention the name Southside and you know about the history,” Patton said. \nSouthside will be rid of the top two teams in the conference following today’s game. The Rebels will play four of their final five games in Fort Smith, with the lone exception an Oct. 16 date at Heritage. \n“”That’s part of it,” Williams said. “You have to play everybody some time. We have to play the No. 1 and No. 2 team back-to-back. but that’s part of the 7A-west. \n“It’s a good challenge for our kids, and they’re looking forward to it.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T13:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T16:42:29.215+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
