Kaleb Williams made short work for a rushing touchdown and then swiped a fumble in mid-air seconds later. \nIt was a back-breaking two and a half minutes for St. Teresa and the last test for Tuscola in the regular season as the Warriors won 63-34. \n\"All of a sudden you look up -- I made the comment to one of our guys on the sidelines,\" Tuscola coach Andy Romine said. \"Remember the NBA Finals when Jordan was playing Clyde Drexler's Trail Blazers, and he looks over at the sidelines after hitting his sixth consecutive three, and he does this?\" cue a Romine shrug, \"That's what it was like.\" \n\"It was one of those things where it just wasn't our night,\" St. T coach Tim Brilley said. \"That's the only way I can put it. We obviously didn't play the way we wanted to, we have to do a better job. \nIt all but locked up the   title for the Warriors. Tuscola finishes the season with Warrensburg, then Meridian \nAnd yet, there was a shadow cast over the game with the ejection of Bates on a targeting call just before the first half. \nBates hit Simon Brinkoetter mid-air as the St. Teresa receiver was coming down with the catch. Bates was called for targeting, which is not an automatic ejection. But referees saw something that warranted booting the Tuscola quarterback from the game. \n\"I'm not sure by rule it's the wrong call,\" Romine said. \"It's a frustrating call. \n\"It wasn't dirty, our kids don't play dirty. They play hard. With the way the game is right now and the rules in place, it is what it is. It's really unfortunate for Nick for what he's poured into this.\" \nBates will also miss next week's game against Warrensburg-Latham. \nBefore that all happened, Tuscola was feeling fine. They looked like a No. 1 team, racking up 57 first-half points on a St. Teresa defense that's contained almost every other offense this year. Add in a Tackitt blocked punt and a Evan Sutton interception, and Tuscola never relented in any phase of the game. \nWhere Romine was happiest though, was with a defense that kept St. Teresa scrambling. Jacardia Wright had one big run -- a 44-yard TD run -- but the freshman kept getting stopped near the line of scrimmage as Tuscola's linemen were able to wrap up. He had 60 yards in the first half. \n\"Besides the fourth-and-1 play where we took a chance and (Wright) got away from us, we did a really good job of forcing them to the air,\" Romine said. \n\"Then when we started getting some pressure on their quarterback, we were able to get a lot of possessions in the first half.\" Aren's take Buying time \nThere are few quarterbacks in the state that can make the throws Bates can with as much accuracy and power. \nThat's compounded by a line that buys him all the time he needs for big plays to develop. \nAs Tuscola went up 20-7, Bates bought even more time thanks to his athleticism and lasered a pass to Dalton Hoel for a 42-yard touchdown. \nIt was a play that ran so long that Tuscola's routes had already been run, but the Warriors receivers are used to continuing to find open space in an ongoing play. \n\"I kind of run what I'm supposed to run, and then if it's broken up and I'm deep, I'll come back to the ball,\" Hoel said. \"Me and Nick, the past two years, we've gotten good with that. We've done that quite a few times because he gets out of the pocket and he knows where I am.\" Kibler hurt \nThe absence of Bates has an expiration date. The more concerning problem may be the loss of Keagan Kibler. \nThe senior offensive lineman went down in the second half in a pile, and came up limping. He didn't return to the game -- he didn't need to -- and Romine said he's hopeful it's nothing more than a high ankle sprain. Momentum killer \nComing into the game, few teams had as much momentum as St. Teresa. They had won four straight and the last three by massive margins. \nThe Bulldogs were in the game 18 minutes in, but the late first-half sequence killed any good feelings earlier in the night. \nSt. Teresa finishes the year with Shelbyville and Warrensburg. \n\"We can't let this break our back for the season because we still have a lot of season ahead of us,\" Brilley said. \"We still got a lot of good opportunities.\" \nadow@herald- 6978", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T11:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T18:29:34.593+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
