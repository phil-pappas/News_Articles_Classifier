LOUIS — Mike Matheny sat behind his desk, nearly an hour after the St. Louis Cardinals’ 4-0, victory over the Chicago Cubs, too exhilarated, or maybe it was too relieved, to take off his uniform, let alone move from his chair. \nHe was the guy who walked out to the mound in the eighth inning of a one-run game, and pulled Lackey out of the game, with the crowd of 47,830 at Busch Stadium, showing their disgust. In a game dominated Cardinals ace John Lackey, it was Matheny, the Cardinals manager, who made one of the gutsiest decisons of his managerial career. \nLackey glared at him, glared again, and then walked off the mound, having thrown just 86 pitches. \nMatheny was setting himself up for the greatest second-guessing decision since Washington Nationals manager Matt Williams pulled Jordan Zimmermann in last year’s Division Series, and Nats fans can tell you how that turned out. \n\"I knew it wasn’t going to be popular, and it wasn’t,\" Matheny said in the privacy of his office. \"You just do what you feel is right, regardless of the outcome.\" John Lackey, Cardinals shutout Cubs in Game 1 of NLDS \nIt turned out to be a stroke of genius, with left-hander Kevin Siegrist striking out Chris Coghlan and Addison Russell, turning the game over to All-Star closer Trevor Rosenthal in the ninth, preventing Lackey from perhaps burning down his office, with Cardinals fan bringing the gasoline. \nAnd Matheny exhaled. \n\"Man, was he good,\" Matheny said. \"He was incredible. You know, you put a guy in a situation like this, and we talk about him being a big-game pitcher, how he thrives in these situations, and then he just takes it there and goes a step further. \n\"It was exactly what we needed. \n\"I don’t know if you could ask him to do any more than what he did.\" \nLackey, who took a no-hitter into the sixth inning, gave up just two hits in 7⅓ innings, striking out five batters. The Cubs had no prayer. They managed to hit the ball out of the infield just three times during Lackey’s stint. \n\"I saw him as a young man in 2002,\" said Cubs manager Joe Maddon, who was on the Anaheim Angels' coaching staff when Lackey helped lead them to their first World Series title, \"and he was always kind of fearless. \n\"He comes from Texas. He kind of does the John Wayne strut out there. He’s that guy.\" \nLackey may be 36 years old, but he’s still ornery than ever, and as he showed all night, is just as nasty as he’s ever been on the mound. He was throwing 95-mph fastballs, 92-mph sinkers, four-seamers, sliders and curveballs. \nThe man was so good he looked like Jake Arrieta, who the Cardinals don’t have to face until Game 3 at Wrigley Field. \n\"I call him OG,\" said Cardinals rookie outfielder Tommy Pham. \"He’s fearless. He’s an original gangster, sort of, you know?\" \nCertainly, Lackey set the stage for the Cardinals. This may have been just the first game of the NL Division Series, in the first postseason game between these two storied franchises, but to the Cardinals, this meant so much more than just a 1-0 Series lead.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T07:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T08:06:23.866+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
