David Zalubowski AP Photo 1 of 4 Order Reprint of this Story AIR FORCE ACADEMY, Colo. \nShayne Davern scored twice and safety Brodie Hicks intercepted two passes and recovered a fumble near the goal line, helping Air Force beat Wyoming 31-17 on Saturday night. \nDavern finished with 130 yards rushing, while quarterback Karson Roberts added 78 and a score. The Falcons (3-2, 2-0 Mountain West) have yet to trail at home this season. \nReceiver Jalen Robinette tossed a 56-yard TD pass to Garrett Brown on a trick play early in the fourth quarter to seal the win as Air Force ended a two-game slide against Wyoming (0-6, 0-2). The Cowboys now have dropped nine straight dating back to last year. \nThe Falcons were constantly applying pressure to Wyoming QB Cameron Coffman, who finished 15 of 29 for 192 yards and two scores. He entered the game averaging 274.8 yards, tops in the conference. He also was sacked four times. \nHicks had a hand in three of Air Force's four turnovers on defense, none bigger than when he recovered tailback Brian Hill's fumble on the 4-yard line that ended Wyoming's comeback bid. \nAir Force didn't pull away from pesky Wyoming until midway through the third quarter. Up 7-3, Roberts orchestrated a nine-play drive that culminated with his 9-yard run. Air Force called all run plays on the drive, with Roberts accounting for 54 of the 69 yards. \nThe Cowboys were threatening to make it a game by driving down to the 5 yard line. Hill was about to hit the hole when the ball slipped from his hands. It was the second fumble of the night for Hill, who finished with 128 yards. \nOn a gadget play, Robinette hit a wide open Brown and he outran the Cowboys to the end zone. With the catch, Brown became the 11th Falcons player to eclipse 1,000 yards receiving in a career. \nBut the Falcons weren't done. After Hicks' second interception of the game, Davern broke free for a 46-yard score. \nAir Force finished with 299 yards rushing, below its 326-yard average that leads the conference. \nCoffman threw both of his TD passes to Jake Maulhardt, with the game already decided. \nThe first half was filled with miscues as each team turned the ball over twice. Air Force capitalized on Hill's fumble with a 6-yard TD run by Davern early in the second quarter. \nJust before halftime, Wyoming turned Robinette's fumble in Falcon territory into a 41-yard field goal by Tristan Bailey. \nWyoming and Air Force combined for 160 total yards, 11 first downs and eight punts in the opening 30 minutes.
