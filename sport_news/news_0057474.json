Police scour the pitch with metal detectors. \nSheets of asbestos roofing exploded as the blaze tore through the stand, which hadn't been in use for seven years. \nFirefighter Dave Joyce tackled the blaze. He later described the scene he encountered, with Molineux burning. \n\"Smoke was drifting across the sky and when we turned into Waterloo Road, we could see the stand well alight,\" Mr Joyce said. \n“We were the first crew there and I was station officer at the time - I ordered 10 more fire engines straight away and we forced our way into the South Bank. \n\"We needed to move really quickly as the stand was wooden and was really going.\" \nAt the same time, even more disconcertingly, live shotgun cartridges wrapped in green tape to disguise them had been buried into the pitch, preceded by a threatening phone call warning the club. \nThe devices had been altered in what police said was a crude attempt to make them detonate if trodden on. \nOne of the cartridges had a nail attached, while others had bits of wood fixed to them. \nPolice, who combed the Molineux turf with metal detectors, said however that the makeshift bombs were crudely made and wouldn't have worked. \nWolverhampton Euro MP John Bird blamed disillusioned Wolves fans angry at Graham Turner's underperforming team - and was promptly banned from his executive box at Molineux for stirring up trouble. One of 32 live shotgun rounds left on the Molineux pitch. \nTensions were obviously high and it was perhaps a surprise when the game was allowed to go ahead. \nDavid Instone wrote in the Express & Star: \"Credit is due to all those who worked single-mindedly almost from sunrise to make sure football triumphed over an act that fell some way between hooliganism and terrorism.\" \nThe football match, which had so much riding on it, seemed a side issue but it saw the drama continue, with Boro, a goal and a man down, scoring twice in quick succession to seal promotion ahead of Derby County. \nViolent acts took place on the pitch as well as off it that day, with Nicky Mohan seeing red on 65 minutes when, after a cynical challenge by Jamie Pollock on Steve Bull, a melee ensued and Mohan was dismissed for his role. \nTwo minutes later Andy Mutch's stooping header put Wolves in front and in a highly charged game he gleefully celebrated in front of the 5,000 away supporters. \nBoro, though, rallied and scored twice in five minutes, the winner coming 13 from time through Paul Wilkinson. \nIn scenes that would be repeated seven years later when Bradford City were elevated to the Premier League on the last day of the season at Molineux, Boro rubbed Wolves' inadequacies in their faces with a promotion pitch party. \nDrama over, you might think, but incredibly on Sunday night/Monday morning Wolves were targeted yet again when a firebomb was thrown into the club secretary's office. \nUnsurprisingly, Wolves beefed up security as a result, introducing 24-hour guard patrols, hidden cameras and laser alarms.
