Therefore, it’s high time they finally get businesslike about another tradition that’s been lacking for a very long time. \nThe “guest conductor” 7th inning stretch routine must be fixed; now. The status quo is beloved by….uhm, nobody. It’s horrifying bad, but the solution is obvious. The Cubs discovered it themselves tonight.

Or you can mix it up with Banks, Ron Santo and Harry Caray. You have a video board now; use it! The amazing things a jumbotron can do. \nYes, “Take me out to the ballgame” in its current incarnation art Wrigley Field, has got to go. The bit has gotten so stale, and Cubs fans dislike it so much that to spend any more time criticizing it is pointless. It’s been ripped enough already. \nEveryone is tired of celebrities disinterested in baseball who come in only to plug their movies, albums, shows, sports teams whatever. Start fresh Cubs organization, and do it right now. \nDon’t wait until 2016, Cubs. Do it now during the 2015 postseason. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T04:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T06:52:09.442+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
