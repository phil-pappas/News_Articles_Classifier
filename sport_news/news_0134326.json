The event, which serves Cook, DuPage, and Kane counties will feature over 70 veteran-friendly employers from the state of Illinois, federal agencies, local government, and veteran-owned companies. Representatives from various legal services, county agencies, senior and homeless services, and education will be on hand to assist veterans with their needs. Two Department of Veteran Affairs Mobile Vet Centers will be on site in the parking lot directly across from the Events Center. Illinois Secretary of State Jesse White will be in attendance as veterans will be able to get their Illinois driver's license or state ID updated to show \"veterans\" status on them. The Mobile Vet Centers are two of 50 units that travel nationwide and provide readjustment counseling services for veterans who served in combat and their families. They are equipped with a satellite dish that connects to communications and audiovisual equipment, six phone lines, a fax line, notebook computers, four encrypted computer lines and Wi-Fi gear. Two dividers separate the motor coach into private counseling rooms. The event is sponsored by ECC's Veterans Support Team, VFW Post 5151, Illinois Department of Employment Security (IDES), VET Center, Illinois WorkNet, Hanover Township, and state and county agencies. A week before the event, the college will offer a free resume writing workshop on Friday, Oct. 23, between 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. in Building F, Room F123. All events are free and open to the public.
