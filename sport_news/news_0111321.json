An offense that controlled the line of scrimmage and time of possession squandered that dominance with three interceptions by Matt Cassel in his first Cowboys start.\nA group that enjoyed its best day on the ground since DeMarco Murray left in free agency lost because of the return man that left in free agency.\nDwayne Harris' 100-yard kickoff return for a touchdown in the fourth quarter, seconds after Cassel engineered a stirring drive to tie the score, was the fatal blow in this 27-20 loss.\nThe Cowboys have now gone 35 days since their last victory. And counting. A team that lost only four games last season has now sunk to 2-4 with a game against Seattle next.\nEven Jerry Jones, the eternal optimist, found it difficult to be upbeat after watching his team lose its fourth consecutive game and its first division road game since December of 2012.\n\"It's a far cry from where I thought we would be, won-lost,'' the owner said. \"It's a far cry from where I thought we would be with key personnel, the injuries to key personnel.\n\"The challenge is daunting.''\nIn the end it didn't matter that Darren McFadden, who took over when Joseph Randle's back seized up on the team's first possession, carried the ball 29 times for 152 yards and a touchdown. It didn't matter that the Cowboys gained 171 more yards than New York and held the ball for 16:08 longer.\nIt didn't matter that Cassel threw the ball downfield more than his predecessor, Brandon Weeden. The benefits of that approach were apparent midway through the final period when Cassel hit Terrance Williams for 21 yards along the sidelines on third-and-nine and came right back to find Devin Street with a 25-yard touchdown pass on the next play to tie the score at 20-20.\nWhat mattered is that Cassel opened the second half by throwing interceptions on three consecutive possessions, one being returned 58 yards for a touchdown by cornerback D. Rodgers-Cromartie and another setting up a field goal to stake the Giants to a 20-13 lead.\nWhat mattered is the Cowboys only got to celebrate their eventual comeback for only 11 seconds before Harris returned the kickoff for what proved to be the winning score.\nJones found it ironic that a player the Cowboys think so much of made the play that beat them.\n\"I've got to watch film,'' safety Danny McCray said. \"I just know as a unit we didn't cover as well as we should on kickoffs the whole night and it came back to bite us.''\nThe Cowboys still had their chances to get back in this game in the final two minutes. On third-and-eight from the New York 30-yard line, the Giants came with a max blitz and Cassel's throw was tipped at the line of scrimmage before falling incomplete. On fourth down he dropped the pass underneath to tight end James Hanna, hoping he could run for the first down.\nHanna came up two yards short.\nAnd still it wasn't over. The Dallas defense forced a three-and-out, meaning the Giants had to punt with 1:36 left. But Cole Beasley fumbled the catch. The Giants recovered on the Dallas 16-yard line, underscoring yet again how much the Cowboys miss Harris in the return game.\nFree agent defections and injuries to Tony Romo and Dez Bryant have hit this team hard in the first two months of the season.\n\"We have to have everything just right to give us a chance to win,'' Jones said. \"That's what not having those players out there does for you.\n\"We can't win it sloppy and we certainly can't win without those guys given these kinds of turnovers. All of that is the result you get no matter how hard they play.''\nThe players vow they will continue to play hard. They appeared to fight among themselves briefly after Harris' return when defensive end Greg Hardy had to be escorted out of the special teams huddle for what head coach Jason Garrett and others said was Hardy's passion and emotion to encourage his teammates.\nBut that exchange was fleeting. The bigger concern is the two months that remain in this season.\n\"I mean, we've got to get the job done,'' defensive tackle Tyrone Crawford said. \"We can't keep coming out here and getting Ls.\n\"We've just got to figure it out.''\nA few days ago another NFL owner, recognizing the Cowboys plight, decided to call Jones and offer this piece of advice.\n\"I've had situations like this in my time,'' Jones said the owner told him. \"Drink a lot.''\nJones may have consumed one or two on the long flight back to Dallas.\n\"We missed a chance here to win a game,'' Jones said, \"and we needed to win it badly.''\nCatch David Moore on The Ticket (KTCK-AM 1310 and 96.7 FM) with The Musers at 9:35 a.m. every Monday and Friday and The Hardline at 4:10 p.m. every Tuesday and Friday during the season.\nTwitter: @DavidMooreDMN\nCowboys trends Second half blues\nThe Cowboys are mired in a four-game losing streak because they get worse as the game goes along. The Giants owned a 17-7 edge in the second half Sunday, which is something of an accomplishment when you consider Matt Cassel through three consecutive interceptions to start the second half. Dallas has been outscored 75-20 in the second half in the last four games.\nSplit decision\nThe defensive numbers were good overall. The Cowboys allowed the Giants only 289 yards and 13 points when you subtract the kickoff return and pick six by New York. But the group did allow the Giants an average of 5.3 yards a rush and failed to force a turnover in their fourth consecutive game, a drought that now extends 255 snaps.\nNothing special\nOther than Dan Bailey, there has been nothing special about the Cowboys performance on special teams this season. But that group sunk to a new low Sunday, allowing a 100-yard kickoff return for a touchdown and fumbling a punt with 1:26 left that eliminated their last, desperate attempt to tie the score. A group that had been pedestrian was actually harmful.\nFull coverage: Giants 27, Cowboys 20\nGosselin: New QB Matt Cassel gives Cowboys what they want, but it comes at a price\nMoore: A once promising season continues to slip away for last-place Cowboys\nSturm: Time to panic?
