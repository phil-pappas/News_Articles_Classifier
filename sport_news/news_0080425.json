(Photo: Tom Szczerbowski-USA TODAY Sport)\n1 CONNECT 3 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE The Timberwolves posted the worst record in the league last season, winning 16 games – a .195 winning percentage. They were last in points allowed per game (106.5), tied for 22nd in points scored per game (97.8), 24th in field-goal percentage (43.8%) and last in opponent field-goal percentage (48.7%).\nUSA TODAY\nPortland Trail Blazers preview: Picking themselves up from rough offseason\nWhat’s different this season? The Wolves drafted 6-11, 250-pound Karl-Anthony Towns from Kentucky with the first overall pick. He’s 19 years old and his monstrous upside suggests that he’ll have a bright future in the league. They also signed Nemanja Bjelica from Serbia, the Euroleague MVP from last season. He has yet to play a game in the NBA, but his 11.9 points and 8.6 rebounds are an encouraging sign for Minnesota. Coach Flip Saunders will likely miss the season as he continues to battle cancer (Hodykin lymphoma), according to team owner Glen Taylor. In his place, Sam Mitchell will coach the team.\nHow good can they be? The future is looking better for the young team, with Rookie of the Year Andrew Wiggins and Towns having the ability to be superstars. This team is nowhere near the playoffs, but it also isn’t likely to be the NBA’s worst team for the second year in a row.\nUSA TODAY\nUtah Jazz preview: They could be the surprise team of the year\nHow far they have to go: You need 45 to 50 wins to make the playoffs in the Western Conference. Adding 30-plus wins on a season isn’t something that happens overnight (unless you’re the 2004 Phoenix Suns). But the Timberwolves have a lot of talented young players, as well as a few key veteran players such as Kevin Garnett who will keep the young guys in check.\nStarting five: A starting five of Ricky Rubio, Kevin Martin, Wiggins, Garnett and Towns should be a good sign. Rubio can masterfully create scoring opportunities for his teammates and lock down opposing point guards on defense. Martin can knock down shots from the perimeter quickly and efficiently. Wiggins makes plays on both sides of the ball. Garnett is a future Hall of Famer. And Towns is an incredibly versatile, freakishly gifted athlete.\nRubio must stay healthy He played 22 games last season and has had only one season in which injuries weren’t a factor.\n1 CONNECT 3 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": ["http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1S2ArIq&mini=true", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/2c5f8688c88ed6f335be5a4a0a62153f6d9ed12d/c=327-0-2327-2000/local/-/media/2015/10/24/USATODAY/USATODAY/635812807030439025-USP-NBA--Preseason-Oklahoma-City-Thunder-at-Utah-J.jpg", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1S2ArIq&text=Minnesota%20Timberwolves%20preview%3A%20Young%20talent%20soldiers%20on%20without%20coach&via=usatoday", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/596a9f299ca14f203a4c0e9f2feda94a97056560/c=0-0-2146-2861&r=537&c=0-0-534-712/local/-/media/2015/10/24/USATODAY/USATODAY/635812815924992041-USP-NBA--Preseason-Minnesota-Timberwolves-at-Toron.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/10/24/USATODAY/USATODAY/635812815924992041-USP-NBA--Preseason-Minnesota-Timberwolves-at-Toron.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/97d4f61eb2367ae700ef7146aa877452c73d5e0a/c=167-0-2359-2192/local/-/media/2015/10/24/USATODAY/USATODAY/635812830877375889-USP-NBA--Preseason-Utah-Jazz-at-Portland-Trail-Bla.jpg", "http://imgur.com/T3NAfcn.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/517d7130ba7e9b0d604d1137c4e40737577f6fb9/r=308x400/local/-/media/2015/10/24/USATODAY/USATODAY/635812815924992041-USP-NBA--Preseason-Minnesota-Timberwolves-at-Toron.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-24T19:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T19:14:32.844+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
