Savannahians from all walks of life, all ages, races and ethnic groups, came together to build this project and they were out in force to celebrate the completion of the studio construction.\nYour coverage of community events like ours continues to highlight the Savannah Morning News as a great daily paper that serves us all.\nGoing forward, our training manuals will be finalized next week.\nProducer/host training on the equipment and software will take place the following week, and our online station will launch soon after. That means there is still time for community members who would like to have a show to submit their idea and get in on the first round of training.\nWith the continued generosity of the community, we will be able to equip the tower and go live on 107.5 FM before the holidays! Folks are invited to become a member or submit their program idea at http://savsoundings.org/ . Thanks again for your support of community events.\nVICKI WEEKS\nMedia Liaison\nWRUU-Savannah Soundings\nSavannah\nYogi Berra exudes power at the plate\nNowhere in the outpouring of articles about Yogi Berra after his recent death did I see mention of a less well-known statistic that exemplifies his tenacity and power at the plate.\nHis career total of 358 home runs is even more impressive when you consider he struck out only 414 times. Many players struck out fewer times, but they were not power hitters, and hit few homers.\nThose who were more prolific home-run hitters went down swinging or looked at a called third strike with much greater and often embarrassing frequency.\nAs far as I can determine, Yogi’s strike-out-to-home-run ratio is the second lowest among all established players in the history of the game. The best was none other than his teammate Joe DiMaggio. Joltin’ Joe had 361 career homers and struck out only 369 times. You could look it up.\nBOB FERRARI\nSavannah\nStop treating Tybee Road like a ‘back road to nowhere’\nWith all the discussion into U.S. Highway 80, the Tybee Road, and its need to be improved, the first thing that should be considered is its signage. After all these years this wonderful national highway is treated like some back road in the middle of nowhere.\nWithout even mentioning the terrible condition of the plants, palm trees, and the trash in the marshes, the road signs need total improvement, and upgrading in every facet.\nFirst of all the overhead signs should be upgraded with new modern green highway signs with enlarged lettering to be read from a distance, and not when you are right on top of the situation.\nThe merge sign at Johnny Mercer Blvd., and U.S. 80 is so small it is ignored most of the time, and causes traffic jams entering the Bull River bridge.\nThe sign on 80 approaching the curve just before Fort Pulaski, both the merge sign, and the possible left turn into the fort entrance should definitely be overhead, and larger, and lighted.\nAnother great improvement might be to move the merge signs further back from the spot to merge and give the cars more of a warning. The merge situation leaving the beach, and approaching the Lazaretto Creek bridge is just as dangerous.\nThe ride to Tybee, from Tybee could be, should be, a pleasant trip but this beautiful highway needs some serious attention.\nHow long before something serious happens on this highway before some improvements are made?\nLEONARD HERB\nTybee Island\nGun laws will help stop gun-related crime\nYour guest editorial on Oct. 1, “Why Gun Laws Miss the Point,” taken from an Orange County paper, is the worst I have ever read pertaining to the availability of guns in our society.\nSince only 1.5 percent of criminals reported purchasing guns from gun shops and 40 percent of them got the weapons from friends or relatives, the editorial concludes that gun laws are ineffective.\nOnly 1.5 percent of guns used by criminals were purchased at gun shop BECAUSE gun laws require background checks which most of these perpetrators would fail.\nThe editorial failed to ask where the 40 percent of guns purchased from friends and relatives came from. A federal study found that 30 percent of illegal guns used in crimes were purchased at gun shows where no background check is needed to purchase guns. All four guns used in the Columbine tragedy had been purchased at gun shows. A study of gun shows in three states found that 74 percent of sellers were willing to sell to potential buyers who had announced that they were prohibited from buying guns.\nIt is time for our newspaper to represent the interests of people who live in Savannah who today suffer from a wave of gun related crimes.\nKENNETH ZAPP\nSavannah", "external_links": ["http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/14775111.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/all/themes/savannahnow/images/blank.gif", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/14775111.jpg", "http://savsoundings.org/"], "published": "2015-10-01T19:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T12:16:50.060+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
