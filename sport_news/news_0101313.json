Related Colts take down Texans 27-20 in Houston \nHoward, appearing Thursday on the Houston Texans pregame show on SportsRadio 610, said he played through the injuries during the five-game series loss in the Western Conference finals to the eventual NBA champion Golden State Warriors. \nHoward hurt the knee in the first quarter of Game 1 of the series and was questionable for Game 2 with what was then called a sprained knee. In the second game, he played 40 minutes, finishing with 19 points and 17 rebounds. He played in the remaining three games of the conference finals, averaging 14.4 points and 14.4 rebounds for the series. \nAccording to an ESPN source, team doctors said he did not need offseason surgery because the tears weren't that severe. \nHoward was out for half of the 2014-15 season due to several injuries, missing two months from January to March following knee surgery. \nHoward, 29, was attending the Texans-Indianapolis Colts game on Thursday night at NRG Stadium. He gave a pregame speech and ran out of the tunnel. Distributed by LAKANA and The Sports Xchange.
