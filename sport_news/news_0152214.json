Ballard will try to help the Steamers keep the Wooden Shoe trophy when they face Morrison on Friday. Posted: Thursday, October 1, 2015 6:00 am | Updated: 10:40 am, Thu Oct 1, 2015. Wooden Shoe heats up By Zach James Herald Assistant Sports Editor The Clinton Herald \nMORRISON, Ill. — It’s cliché to say that records don’t matter in a rivalry, but when it comes to the 39th edition of the Wooden Shoe Bowl, Morrison and Fulton’s records do. The next loss for either team will knock it out of playoff consideration. \nThe Mustangs and Steamers (each 1-4) enter Friday’s game needing a win if the playoffs remain a realistic goal. \nThe task, however, just win this one. \n“It’s talked about all week throughout the communities,” Morrison Coach Cory Bielema said. “I think Fulton going into the season, I know they were going to be a darkhorse. I know they had their sights set much higher, and I think we’re going to see a much angrier Fulton team.” \nThe Steamers snapped a 10-game losing streak in the series last season with a 42-0 win at home. Fulton will bring the trophy on the road hoping to bring it back home at the end of the night. \n“It’s always a very interesting game,” Fulton Coach Patrick Lower said. “We always kind of joke that you’re playing your cousin, your in-laws, because there’s lots of family. But, there’s also a lot of respect between the two programs.” \nMorrison leads the Wooden Shoe Bowl series 27-11 with its most recent win coming in an 8-7 nailbiter in 2013. Even though the two teams have played each other on-and-off since 1901, 1977 was the first year that the rivalry became the Wooden Shoe Bowl. \nFulton won 38-6 in the 1977 inaugural Wooden Shoe Bowl game. \nThe Mustangs lead the all-time series 55-25 with five ties. Morrison won the very first game 16-0 in 1901. \n“The game definitely makes us pick the intensity up during the week,” Morrison junior Thomas Ottens said. “We want that Wood Shoe back, and we’ve had it for years on end. \n“It’s a killer to not have the trophy in our trophy case,” Ottens added. “We had it, and to have it taken away on a 42-point loss ... it’s just a kick right in the gut.” \nMorrison is coming off a win against Riverdale last week after losing some tough, hard-fought games this season. \n“We had a little bit of sloppy play last week, but second half, I thought we played with much more fire,” Bielema said. “We need them to bring it out for a full four quarters.” \nFulton, meanwhile, had chances to put away Princeton last week, but turnovers kept the Steamers from getting win No. 2. The Steamers currently own a minus-seven turnover ratio. \n“We’re anxious to get out there and play,” Lower said. “We have to hang onto the football, and that’s kind of something we have not had over the years here. We’ve got to solve that issue, and if we do, I’m confident that we can do good things.” \nEven though there is a trophy and bragging rights on the line, Fulton senior Devon Ballard feels it’s like any other game. \n“Just with the award at the end, it means a lot more,” Ballard said. “There’s always some trash talk, but it’s pretty cool. We’re not concerned about last week, and we’ve got to go game by game.” \nMorrison’s drive comes off of not seeing the trophy at school on a daily basis. \n“We want to show (Fulton) that we’re not who we were last year,” Morrison’s Eric Sipes said. “We’re better than we were last year ... it’s been weird going through the trophies and like being able to spot it out, and now that it’s gone, it makes me want to go take it back.” \nCheck out our podcast! \nListen to the Week 6 preview podcast co-hosted by Zach James and Jon Gremmels on soundcloud.com/clintonherald or at clintonherald.com .
