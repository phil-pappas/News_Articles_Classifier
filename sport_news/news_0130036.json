Last year, we went in having won nine national titles in a row and were kind of cocky. You take that away and it makes you hungry.” The Fort Lewis College mountain bike team will take that hunger to Snowshoe, West Virginia, on Oct. 23-25 for the 2015 USA Cycling Collegiate Mountain Bike Nationals. Seven women and a maximum allotment of 10 men will represent the Skyhawks. FLC is fresh off winning the Division I Rocky Mountain Collegiate Cycling Conference team overall title after a strong performance at Angel Fire, New Mexico during Adams State’s home meet, The Grizzly Grind. The Skyhawks finished ahead of the University of Colorado, the defending national champion that is led by Durango’s own Sepp Kuss, the defending short track cross country and cross country national champion. “I’m super excited after winning conference,” Gould said. “That’s a step we didn’t get last year, and it’s a positive thing to happen. We’ve been strong every race we’ve gone to. “We have to be humble going to nationals because it’s a different level, and the East Coast is a whole different ball game. But our skill level and depth is phenomenal. We’re confident.” Downhill coach Lucas LeMaire echoed that confidence and said the team’s chemistry and versatility can help deliver another national title. “Everyone trained all summer, and we have a lot of good riders who want it,” LeMaire said. “We will have to work as a team and get everyone to perform, but we have a strong team that should produce some individual national champions and, hopefully, the overall.” Sofia Gomez-Villafañe is Fort Lewis’ top returning national champion. She won the individual omnium for her overall performance in 2014, and she’ll once again contend in enough events to compete for an omnium title. “We have some impressive freshmen who have really looked up to a girl like Sofia. She’s helped a lot of them learn a lot, and she has such a great drive to race,” LeMaire said. Becky Garner will also defend her national championship in the downhill. On the men’s side, Durango native Stephan Davoust won the Men’s A conference title, giving him extra momentum going into nationals. FLC will look to take down national powerhouses from around the country such as Lees McRae College, Lindsay Wilson College and Marian University along with CU-Boulder. The Skyhawks also have added motivation to win a 21st overall national championship for the cycling program with team director Dave Hagen unable to travel to the races after sustaining a severe ankle injury during a Ska/Zia Town Series event last month. “We’re doing it for Hagen,” Gould said. “His injury was pretty hardcore. He had a positive surgery but won’t be coming with us. It’s on everybody’s minds, and he’s definitely missed. The team, the program wouldn’t be what it is without him, and we have to step up as coaches to collectively try to replace his knowledge because he knows absolutely everything.” Here’s a look at the men and women who will compete for the Skyhawks this weekend: Gomez-Villafañe: The top FLC women’s rider will compete in cross country, short-track cross country, downhill and dual slalom to contend for the omnium. She is coming off two first-place finishes at The Grizzly Grind in short track and cross country as well as a second-place finish in the dual slalom. She also earned wins in cross country and short track at the Colorado Mesa and Colorado Mines meets. Davoust: The conference champion from Durango will tackle the individual omnium by competing in cross country, short track, downhill and dual slalom. He took first this year in the short track events held at The Grizzly Grind, Colorado Mesa, Colorado Mines and the Pagan Pedal along with several other podium finishes. “He’s ranked No. 1 in the country,” Gould said of Davoust. “We’re hoping to see something from him in short track, and he’s definitely a top-five cross countryman.” Payson McElveen: This Durango native took first in cross country at the Colorado Mesa event and earned second in short track at Colorado Mesa. He also was second in the Snowmass cross country race and third at the Grizzly Grind short track race. “He’s been phenomenal,” Gould said. “He’s a really good rider and has been champing at the bit all season.” Gardner: The experienced downhill racer is coming off a first-place finish in the downhill at the Colorado Mesa event and is primed for another run at a national championship. “She should take another national title,” LeMaire said. Zach Graveson: This downhill racer will compete in the dual slalom and downhill. He claimed first in the slalom at The Grizzly Grind and first in the downhill at the Oredigger MTB Classic. “He’s a total gravity guy. He could bring back a title,” LeMaire said. Kelsay Lundberg: Fresh off a second-place finish behind Gomez-Villafañe in The Grizzly Grind cross country race, Lundberg is ready to tackle the short track and cross country races in West Virginia. “It’s her first trip to nationals for us. She’s a young girl and real excited,” Gould said. Elizabeth Endersbe: After taking first at The Drizzly Grind dual slalom race and fifth in the cross country event, this rider will pursue the individual omnium by competing in four events. She competed in three disciplines at the Colorado Mesa event with her best result a fourth-place finish in the downhill. Earlier in the year, she earned first in the dual slalom and second in the downhill at the Pagan Pedal event. Caroline Endersbe: Elizabeth’s sister will tackle the cross country and short track races. Her top finishes this season were third-place results at Colorado Mesa and the Pagan Pedal. Michael Sampson: An all-around rider, Sampson will contend for an individual omnium by competing in four events. His top result this year was a second-place cross country ride at the Pagan Pedal.

He opened his season with a first-place finish in short track at the Oredigger MTB Challenge.
