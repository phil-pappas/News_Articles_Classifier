But no, Tarver wasn’t referring to his failed PED test following a June 2012 fight in California.\nMultiple sources have informed The Record that Tarver failed a pre-fight PED test some two months ago, prior to his 12-round draw with Steve Cunningham on Aug. 14 at Prudential Center in Newark. The State Athletic Control Board, which regulates boxing in New Jersey, and an independent company tested Tarver and Cunningham prior to their heavyweight fight.\nThe 46-year-old Tarver, a former undisputed light-heavyweight champion, was allowed to fight Cunningham because results of his \"A\" and \"B\" samples weren’t available until after the bout. Tarver failed for a synthetic testosterone, a cream applied into skin.\n\"I have no idea how my urine sample tested positive because I didn’t take anything illegal,\" Tarver said. \"Either the test was contaminated, or mixed up with another sample. We believe in the process and I will fully comply. Further analysis will prove I’m 100 percent innocent because I’ve done nothing wrong.\"\nIt is beyond difficult to give Tarver the benefit of the doubt based on his California ordeal three years ago.\nThe California State Athletic Commission suspended the Tampa, Fla., resident for a year because he tested positive for an anabolic steroid following a draw with Lateef Kayode in Carson, Calif.\nThe Tarver-Kayode result was changed to a no-contest. His suspension also cost Tarver his commentating gig with Showtime.\nHe since has been hired as a commentator by Spike, which televised his fight against Cunningham.\nTarver (31-6-1, 22 KOs, 1 NC) will file an appeal with the State Athletic Control Board. If he loses, his draw with Cunningham (28-7-1, 13 KOs) would be changed to a no-contest.\nRegardless, this incident provides more evidence that boxing commissions, promoters and fighters have an enormous amount of improvements to make to better ensure a sport that’s already extremely dangerous prevents cheaters from gaining unfair advantages through PED use.\nCunningham promised prior to fighting Tarver that if an opponent ever tested positive for a PED he would file a civil suit on grounds of \"attempted murder.\"\nIf the former cruiserweight champion from Philadelphia follows through, it’d at least bring much-needed attention to perhaps boxing’s biggest problem.\nTwitter: @Idecboxing", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T04:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T08:41:23.600+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
