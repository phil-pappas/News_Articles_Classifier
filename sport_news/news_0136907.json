Stone Stadium on October 5, 2015. PJ Ward-Brown/The Courier-Tribune By Megan Crotty mcrotty@courier-tribune.com Twitter: @MeganCrottyCT \nTime may feel like it’s flying by in the North Carolina high school football season as the teams are hitting Week 8. \nStill, for some Randolph County teams a new season has just started with conference openers. \nTonight, Asheboro (1-0, 5-1) travels to Ledford (2-0, 6-1) in Mid-Piedmont Conference play, while Southwestern Randolph has a bye. In Piedmont Athletic Conference openers, Eastern Randolph (3-3) travels to Trinity (3-3), Providence Grove (2-4) hosts High Point Andrews (5-1) and Wheatmore (2-4) travels to Randleman (2-3). All the games are set to kick off at 7:30 p.m. \nThanks to Mother Nature drenching the state, the Blue Comets are coming into a key MPC game on a short week. AHS opened league play Monday, topping the Cougars 54-14, while the Panthers beat Central Davidson 48-7 Friday. \n“It’s just different routine-wise,” Blue Comets coach Owen George said of the short week. “The kids have adjusted very, very well. We’ve had two solid days of practice and we feel pretty good about things.” \nAHS needs to head into tonight’s game on a high note. The Blue Comets face a strong LHS team on Panthers turf in a battle of league unbeatens. Southern Guilford, which hosts CD tonight, is the only other MPC squad without a loss. “Friday’s going to be a war — it always has been,” said George, whose team faces the Storm next week. \n“Ledford’s a very physical team. Garrett Hooker is a great linebacker and they’ve only allowed 43 points in seven games. On offense, they’re scoring some points. Their best athlete is at quarterback (Tyler Scott). We’ll have our hands full with him. \n“It should be a heckuva ballgame. It’s a tough place to play with a rowdy student section. Our school and our kids know how much is at stake.” \nBoth the Wildcats and Bulldogs are coming off bye weeks, though Eastern Randolph beat Jordan-Matthews 19-13 in a rain-postponed game Sept. 29, while Trinity fell to East Davidson 17-14 in overtime Sept. 25. \n“I’m impressed with Trinity,” ER coach Seth Baxter said. “Coach (Brett) Andrews has done a great job. I’m impressed with their backfield and their quarterback is a talented, hard-nosed kid. Their tailback runs really hard and has a wiggle to him, and their fullback does a good job when he gets the ball in his hands. Their backfield is very scary. On defense, they’re very opportunistic. Trinity has always played us well — even before I got here.” \nThe Wildcats’ biggest problem this season has been injuries and depth. Tonight, leading rusher Jaron Letterlough is doubtful after missing the second half of the J-M game with a knee injury. The good news for ER was that quarterback Furious Sutton, tight-end-turned-running-back Trever Tetstone and all-conference wide receiver Donte Goldston picked up the slack. On defense, the Wildcats had three interceptions last week, upping the team total to 10. \n“Our offensive line is starting to grow and mold into a good line,” Baxter said. “Trever and Donte are football players who do what you ask them to do. They’re three-year starters. Yesterday, Donte pointed out that this is the last week the seniors will play a conference opener and Trever told the guys, ‘This is conference. It’s time to pick it up.’ I’m looking for that sense of urgency. We’re the defending conference champs and we take pride in that. \n“Last week, we used adversity as a chance to have to adjust rather than a crutch or an excuse. We grew up some.” \nAndrews said the week break was a good thing for his squad heading into tonight’s PAC opener. \n“It helped us simplify some things — things we’re struggling with offensively,” he said. “We made sure we’re on the crisp end of things. On defense, we’ve just been preparing for (tonight). \n“Eastern Randolph has good athletes and that makes it tough for anybody. We need to make sure we execute on both sides of the ball. Our confidence is up. Going into games, we feel we can be competitive with anybody.” \nThe Patriots have a tall order, facing one of the top teams in the state. While PG has had a break after falling to the Blue Comets 12-0 Sept. 25, Andrews had a short week, topping Smith 48-6 on Tuesday. \n“We’ve had a good week off; we have a big task ahead,” Patriots coach Danny Martin said. “I’m not one of those coaches who sugar-coats it. We have to be ready to play. They’re going to hit us in the mouth and it’s going to hurt. (Wednesday), we had one of the most competitive, hard-nosed practices we’ve ever had. There were tempers. I like it. We’ve got to be ready to get after it. If we aren’t, it’s going to be a long night.” \nPG faces a Red Raiders squad that has allowed just 59 points this season and scored 225. The Patriots have given up 101 and scored just 75. \n“They’re very, very fast,” Martin said. “They have about six guys who can run and a nose tackle who’s 6-foot-3, 240-pounds, so they’re big up front. They’re very methodical in what they do. If you fall asleep, they’ll throw a pass over you. On defense, they’re just fast and they get after it. … I’ve told the kids, though, ‘They’re just like you. They put their britches on the same way.’ We can’t be intimidated.” \nWhile the Warriors are on a short week after falling 20-0 to Thomasville on Monday, the Tigers had a break after losing to THS 13-0 Sept. 28 and beating Carrboro 57-0 two days later. \n“It’s been a good week,” RHS coach Shane Handy said. “It’s Homecoming, so there are a lot of extra distractions, but the kids have practiced hard. We’re still a little depleted at some positions. The kids are stepping up and doing the job. They’ve stayed on task and always come out and worked hard. It builds character.” \nHandy said he’s expecting a good game. \n“They’re similar to us athletically and size-wise they might be a little bit bigger,” he said. \n“It’s a pretty good-looking group. They play really hard with a lot of excitement. It’s going to be a heckuva matchup.” \nWHS coach Jason Bradley said his team is dealing with some soreness in the short week, but his team has practiced with the same intensity to get ready for a tough RHS squad. \n“They have a good quarterback in Bailey (Welch) and (Tanner) McGee at wide receiver,” he said. “Coming from there and coaching there, I know the tradition and the heritage. Shane Handy continues to get those guys ready. We’re not coming into the game like we’re going to shock anybody. We’re not a sleeper. People know what we bring to the table. \n“We’re the Homecoming game and it’s conference, so I told the kids to take it an use it. We’re a special guest and we’re looking for a good time.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T05:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T05:35:02.785+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
