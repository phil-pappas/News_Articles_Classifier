With a 2-12 record, it's not always easy. \nREGINA — There will be more grey hairs than Grey Cups in Saskatchewan this year. \nBut the Saskatchewan Roughriders’ comportment is seemingly unaffected by their 2-12 record and the consequent cacophony of criticism from caustic commentators and frustrated fans. \n“One thing we’ll never take for granted is the opportunity to play this game, no matter what situation you’re in,” said Riders slotback Weston Dressler, who is preparing for Friday’s road game against the Hamilton Tiger-Cats. \n“There’s a lot of guys out there who would be willing to do a lot just to be in our position, just to be able to play in this game. We understand that. It’s pretty special that we’re still playing football and that we have the opportunity to play. We’re going to do everything we can to win.” \nThe effort cannot be faulted. Neither can the intentions, or the manner in which the Roughriders’ players and coaches conduct themselves during yak sessions with the media. \nThe questions become repetitive, much like the losses, so it would be reasonable to expect some evidence of frayed nerves. \nYet, the Riders — from interim head coach Bob Dyce on down — were patient, personable and professional after Tuesday’s practice, even though few of the inquiries radiated positivity. \nMeanwhile, it was impossible not to wonder: What is it like to be in the Roughriders’ cleats these days? \n“It’s tough, but I think it builds character,” quarterback Kevin Glenn replied. “It builds you as a person, not just on the football field but outside the football field. \n“You can’t simulate this in the real world. There’s no other job that I know of where you can be at the highest of the highs and the lowest of the lows in a matter of weeks and days. It builds character and that’s what sometimes you have to take away from these types of situations.” \nGlenn has experienced all situations during a 15-year CFL career. The Riders’ plight is not easy to digest, but the players refuse to succumb to the gloom and doom. \n“You keep coming back because of the competitiveness, and that’s just how we’re built,” Glenn said. “That’s our mindset. We don’t give up. It’s because we’ve been playing this game for so long. \n“That’s just the way the Lord has (planned it). That’s why you’re a reporter. You do something well, being a reporter, and that’s why He made you a reporter. As far as athletes, that’s why we succeed and get to this point — because of our makeup. That’s just how we’re built. \n“We keep continuing to come back, even though we get to the lowest of the lows sometimes. In this profession, that can happen, because you can flush what happened last week and you can get prepared for this week and be up and be excited and go out and win the game.” \nBut there are differences between the reporter — a grizzled columnist, in this case — and the starting quarterback. \nIf the starting quarterback errs while making a split-second decision, an interception, a fumble or even a loss can result. \nIf a columnist commits an error, he or she can simply type over it before publication. Who’s to know? Sweet gig, this. \nKeep in mind, too, that the columnist’s duties can be performed in the absence of fear that a snorting, onrushing 260-pound defensive lineman may soon inflict damage. \n“I’m not going to take anything away from you — since we’re talking about me and you — being a reporter, because you might have a deadline that you have to meet and you’ve got to put something together very, very fast, and you do it,” Glenn said. “That’s the same type of situation. It’s just different professions. \n“As a player, as a competitor, this is what we’ve been built to do. I’ve been doing it a lot — practically my whole life. Those type of situations, you build off of them and you’re able to grow as a person — like I said, when you’re at the lowest of the lows and the highest of the highs.” \nBut even after the Riders descended to one of their all-time low points, as they did Sunday while losing 46-20 to the host B.C. Lions, the spirits remain high. \n“I love my job,” Dyce said. “I love working with the guys. I love working with the coaches. So it’s always a pleasure to come in here, and it’s a blessing to be able to do what we do.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-07T15:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T03:23:53.249+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
