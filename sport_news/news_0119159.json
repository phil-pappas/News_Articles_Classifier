Douglas Mitchell Alameda was arrested Saturday on suspicion of assault with a deadly weapon and causing a fire of a structure or forest land, both felonies. Sonora Police Chief Mark Stinson said a male transient reported he was assaulted about 1:15 a.m. Saturday on the 800 Block of Stockton Road. “He alleged that Douglas Alameda had struck him with some type of metal object,” Stinson said, adding that the object was not identified. After law enforcement arrived on scene, Stinson said the man had two visible red spots that were starting to bruise — one on his upper abdomen and one on his back, but refused medical attention. Upon further investigation, Stinson said Alameda had an illegal campfire off of Stockton Road and Mill Villa Court. “It was on somebody else’s property,” he said. No structures were damaged and the fire was put out by law enforcement officials. Stinson added that Alameda has a record with the Sonora Police Department. “We’ve arrested him a few times before,” he said, including in September for battery and earlier this year for providing false information to police. “We’ve had quite a bit of contact with him.” Alameda is being held in Tuolumne County Jail on $40,000 bond.
