LOUIS (AP) - \nRookie Todd Gurley rushed for 128 yards and his first two touchdowns, helping the St. Louis Rams put away the punchless Cleveland Browns 24-6 on Sunday. \nSt. Louis (3-3) had four sacks and recovered four fumbles. The Rams scored 10 points off miscues on Cleveland's first two series, a 17-yard fumble recovery by Rodney McLeod and a field goal after the first of William Hayes' two sacks and strips of Josh McCown on the day. \nJohnny Manziel got mop-up duty for the Browns (2-5) after McCown left for the locker room favoring his right arm with about four minutes left. \nGurley scored on runs of 1 and 16 yards. He has topped 100 yards rushing in each of the last three games. Â©2015 by The Associated Press. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed.
