In the final, Svidler missed several opportunities to become the first player ever to win the world cup twice. \n\nLeading 2-0 under normal games, the Russian was just a draw away from the crown when a disaster happened and he lost the next two games on the trot. \n\nWith Karjakin forcing a tie-break, Svidler lost the first rapid game but came back to square once again while in the ten-minute games that ensued, he again missed a real opportunity to seal the contest in his favour. \n\nThe match was finally decided in the blitz tiebreak wherein Karjakin won two on the trot to win the title. The World Cup had two games under normal time control except the final which was played over four games. In case of a tied result, games of shorter duration were played to determine the winner. \n\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T17:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T14:57:55.813+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
