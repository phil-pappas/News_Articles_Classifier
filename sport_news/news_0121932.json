(Photo: WLTX-TV) CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE \n(COLUMBIA, SC) Multiple reports are saying that South Carolina head coach Steve Spurrier is retiring. \n\"Sports Illustrated's\" Thayer Evans first reported the news. Other outlets, including Gamecock Central.com, began reporting the news later. \nSpurrier, a Tri-Cities native, was hired in November 2004 to replace Lou Holtz. He led the team to a strong winning record and numerous bowl appearances. \nThis year, however, the team has struggled. The Gamecocks are currently 2-4 on the season. After last season, Spurrier, nicknamed \"the Ole Ball Coach,\" appeared to hint that he had some ambivalence about continuing on as the South Carolina coach. \nSpurrier made his strongest mark in college football as head of the Florida Gators, who he led to a national championship in the 1990s. Spurrier played quarterback for the Gators in the 1960s, winning a Heisman Trophy. \nHe later played in the NFL, including as quarterback for the woebegone nascent Tampa Bay Buccaneers. \nMore on this story as it develops.
