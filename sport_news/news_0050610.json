It was at least the third strike for a player who simply couldn't or wouldn't get with the program. \nMalzahn said Wednesday that Williams would no longer continue taking classes at Auburn. \nFrom there, Malzahn announced the coaches were opening up a competition at every single position, including quarterback, and there's a feeling that Jeremy Johnson could return as the starter against Kentucky. \nRELATED: Sure seems like Jeremy Johnson's getting another shot \nCompetition is good. Open competition across the board five games into the season usually isn't. \nDefensive coordinator Will Muschamp expressed his exasperation with his run defense, suggesting it's so bad he wouldn't even bother throwing the ball if he were an opposing offense. \n\"Hell, ain't nobody got to throw it,\" Muschamp said. \"I wouldn't.\" \nThat's an early contender for Auburn quote of the year. \nAuburn players were asked if this season could be headed the way of 2012, when the record bottomed out at 3-9 overall and 0-8 in the SEC and Gene Chizik got fired. Naturally, they said no, but the evidence continues to mount. \nAt least one thing seems certain as Auburn approaches the halfway point of a season that hasn't gone as planned. Unless this team made significant improvement behind the scenes at practice - which won't be evident until Thursday night at Kentucky - this was a lost week on the Plains. \nThat's my take.
