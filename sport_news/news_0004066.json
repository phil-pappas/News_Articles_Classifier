(AP) - Sen. Charles Schumer is calling for federal authorities to routinely test and require full disclosure of components in Halloween makeup.\nThe New York Democrat says novelty makeup and face paint are often made in China and can contain metals that could pose a danger to children wearing them.\nAccording to Schumer, the Campaign for Safe Cosmetics found all 10 face paints it tested contained lead and six contained nickel, cobalt and/or chromium.\nLead is banned from makeup in Canada and Europe, but not in the U.S.,\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration doesn't conduct routine testing of novelty cosmetics and needs to do more to enforce required disclosures of ingredients.\nHe says parents should check what glitter, lipstick and other cosmetics go on their children's faces this Halloween.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T13:34:26.299+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
