He has 3 of their 6 goals this season, and goalie Quick is coming into form. Kings’ win streak is 2.\nQuote: OF THE NIGHT\n''It's early in the year. We weren't panicking when we lost the first three, and we're not going to (inflate) our heads now that we've won two in a row.’’\n-- Kings winger Tyler Toffoli\nSTAT OF THE NIGHT\n-- Tyler Toffoli scored a 5-on-5 goal to break a 1-1 tie in the second period, and completed a trifecta. Through five games, he has one even-strength goal, one power-play goal and one shorthanded goal.\nPLAYER OF THE GAME\n-- Shaky (at best) in his first two games, Kings goalie Jonathan Quick has steadily improved. He faced only 23 Colorado shots but provided calm, steady leadership, particularly when the Kings (often) had to kill penalties.\nANALYSIS\n-- To be certain, not all is well with the Kings. They’ve still yet to score more than two goals in a game, they’re still rather anemic on the power play and they’re still taking too many penalties. But given how dreadful things appeared after the first three games, it’s fair to say the Kings are making progress. The ``old’’ Quick is back, and is on top of his game, the defensemen seem to be settling into a groove and top players such as Marian Gaborik, Drew Doughty and Jeff Carter are starting to lead the way. A 2-3 homestand isn’t the way the Kings wanted to start the season, but it could have been a lot worse.\nKEY MOMENT\n-- The Kings, playing well, lost the lead when Colorado’s Matt Duchene scored with 4:03 remaining in the second period to make it a 1-1 game, but Tyler Toffoli forced a breakaway and scored just 23 seconds later.\nANY NEWS?\n1 2 3 Next Page", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T09:16:59.032+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
