I was thinking, 'My daughter is never going to know me.'\"\nUgolini's passion to offer support to other cancer victims and to fundraise is what led her to head up \"Walk For Hope To Cure Breast Cancer,\" which will take place on Sunday, Oct. 4.\nThe event, which is an expansion of the annual City of Hope Walk on the North Shore, will consist of a one-mile family walk through the woods, a 5K fun run, prizes, goody bags, snacks and kids activities. Proceeds will benefit City of Hope, a California-based non-profit research facility and clinical trial-centered hospital.\n\"This is going to be a fun, family-oriented day that will be rewarding to those to attend because they will be giving back to the community and saving lives,\" said Ugolini. She has spent over a decade fundraising and offering support for breast cancer victims through several organizations. \"When I went through my ordeal, I had access to all of the best resources, and there are people who don't have rides to chemotherapy or even access to mammograms,\" she said. \"I want them to have the support I had.\"\nShayli Ugolini family / HANDOUT Ugolini, shown here with her daughter, Shayli in 2004, has participated in several walks for breast cancer, which include City of Hope, Avon Walk for Breast Cancer, Susan G.

(Ugolini family / HANDOUT) Ugolini has participated in several walks for breast cancer, which include City of Hope, Avon Walk for Breast Cancer, Susan G. Koman Race for the Cure, Y-ME Race, and Relay for Life. She said that for this event, she chose not to require a minimum dollar amount for collected donations from participants, but rather to ask walkers for a $25 suggested donation.\n\"Most of the other walks have minimums of $1,800 or more which eliminates a lot of people who want to walk and make a difference, but who are unable to raise that kind of money,\" said Ugolini, who will also lead warm-up exercises before the event. \"Anyone who wants to walk should be able to walk, and to raise as much money as they can.\"\nHillery Chakos is the Development Officer In Philanthropy and External Relations for City of Hope, who initially reached out to Ugolini to plan and organize the event.\n\"She has been part of the event for several years and I knew she had done a lot of counseling for women with breast cancer,\" Chakos said. \"She has an outgoing spirit and is a sweet and good soul. She's an inspiration and a model for us all, having suffered and survived, and having done so beautifully.\"\nWalk for Hope to Cure Breast Cancer will take place from 1-3 p.m. at Sunset Woods Park in Highland Park.\n\"I live in a place with top surgeons, top hospitals and access to the best care,\" Ugolini said. \"There are hundreds of thousands who don't have the support I had, and I feel like what I'm doing—raising money and awareness—is saving lives. I really believe that.\"\n\"This isn't just for mothers and daughters today, it's for our granddaughters,\" Chakos said. \"These diseases travel from generation to generation and it's time to put a stop to it.\"\nTo learn more: visit www.crowdrise.com/mindysmotivations\nCopyright © 2015, Chicago Tribune Breast Cancer Highland Park City of Hope", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-5609696f/turbine/ct-ctlh-dfr-mindy1-1001-ng-jpg-20150928", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-56096d31/turbine/ct-hpn-breast-cancer-walk-tl--1001-20150928", "http://www.crowdrise.com/mindysmotivations"], "published": "2015-09-28T19:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T15:22:49.275+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
