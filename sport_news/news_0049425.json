Martin Association went on Saturday afternoon: St. Francis 42, St. Mary’s 41.\nIt was one of those contests that seemed like the team with the ball last would win.\n“That’s exactly what I was thinking,” a somewhat hoarse St. Francis coach Jerry Smith said afterwards. “It was exciting for the fans. We can’t stop anybody but we can score.”\nThe Red Raiders erased a 35-21 second-half deficit. A key play came in the fourth quarter, when Sean Campbell blocked an extra point after the Lancers had taken the lead. Then St. Francis scored the game-tying touchdown on a 21-yard pass from Jerry Hickson to Jacob Tasker. Robert Barbieri kicked the extra point that made the difference in the game.\n“St. Mary’s had the ball with just under four minutes left, but turned the ball over on downs at our 25,” Smith said. “Tom Acurri had a big sack. He broke through and got the quarterback when it looked like one of their guys was wide open.”\nHickson threw for three touchdowns and ran for two others as his team improved to 3-3 overall.\nFor St. Mary’s (2-4), Takal Molson threw four touchdown passes and ran for a pair of scores.\n“He’s one of the best athletes I’ve seen,” Smith said about the Lancers’ standout.\n“We’ve got to tackle better. We’ve got Cathedral Prep coming up next week.”\nClass A North\nWilliamsville South 35, Kenmore East 12: The Billies scored the first 28 points of the game, all in the first half, and went on to the victory.

Justin Moon blocked a punt and recovered a loose ball for a Williamsville South touchdown.
