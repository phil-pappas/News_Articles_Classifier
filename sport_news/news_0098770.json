(AP) - Jehu Chesson returned the opening kickoff 96 yards for a touchdown and No. 18 Michigan scored on offense and defense to build a four-touchdown lead by halftime in a 38-0 victory over No. 13 Northwestern on Saturday.\nThe Wolverines (5-1, 2-0 Big Ten) have won five straight since their opening loss at Utah under coach Jim Harbaugh, building momentum going into a showdown at home next week against No. 4 Michigan State.\nThe Wildcats (5-1, 1-1) were giving up a nation-low seven points a game and gave that up 13 seconds after kickoff. They allowed a season-high 21 points in the first quarter alone and struggled on offense, too.\nMichigan has shut out three straight opponents for the first time since 1980.\nThe Wolverines scored TDs on a kickoff return, interception and offense for the first time since 1991 at Boston College, according to STATS.\n___\nAP college football website: www.collegefootball.ap.org\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
