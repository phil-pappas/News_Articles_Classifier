Blatter asks,\" Platini told Le Monde. \"I reply: 'One million.' 'Of what?' 'Whatever you want, rubles, pounds, dollars.' There was still no euro then. He replies, 'Agreed. One million Swiss francs per year.'\" \nThe former France great has previously said FIFA did not pay him in full at the time because of the governing body's financial problems. \nPlatini told Le Monde that Blatter suggested that FIFA's salary policy prevented him from having a contract that paid the Frenchman more than then secretary general Michel Zen-Ruffinen. \n\"I worked for several months without pay,\" Platini said. \"After a while, I go see Blatter: 'You have a problem paying me?' He says: 'Yes, I can't pay you 1 million because of the wage structure. You must understand that the secretary general gets 300,000 Swiss francs. You can't get more than three times his salary. So we'll write you a contract for 300,000 Swiss francs and pay the rest later.' And that's what happened. Only later never arrived.\" \nPlatini said he invoiced FIFA for 2 million Swiss francs in 2011 because he mistakenly recalled that he had been paid 500,000 Swiss francs annually at the time, and not 300,000. \nFIFA paid Platini in February 2011, weeks ahead of a presidential contest between Blatter and Mohamed bin Hammam of Qatar, who both sought Platini's endorsement.
