UNION CITY – Union City welcomed the Reading Rangers to town Friday night for a Big 8 clash on the Chargers homecoming night, with Union City winning in a shoot-out by the score of 50-34. The scoring started early, as Reading took possession of the ball to start the game, promptly moving the ball down the field using the run game. Reading attempted a run up the middle with their big fullback David Giberson; however Union City senior linebacker Brandon Powell emerged from the scrum with the ball, racing 69-yards the opposite way for the first score of the game. The two point conversion was good by Jalen Boes, and just like that the Chargers led 8-0. Reading made short work of their next possession, as the Rangers rode the legs of Giberson and Dalton Creager all the way down to the four yard line. Giberson ran the ball in from four yards out, and with the two point conversion also by Giberson the score stood at 8-8. This was just the start of a game filled with a ton of offense and not much defense, as the two teams combined for over 700 yards of total offense. The Chargers hit pay dirt next as Boes caught a 19-yard touchdown pass from Seth Bruce, and with the two-point conversion no good Union City led 14-8. On Reading’s next possession, it was once again the running game that gashed the Chargers, as it was Giberson again, this time from 50-yards out for a Ranger touchdown. The two point conversion was no good, so the score stood tied at 14-14 with 3:03 left in the first quarter. The score stood tied at 14-14 until 11:32 of the second quarter when Reading’s Creager scored from 42-yards out, and with the two point pass from Tyler Dieterle to Noah Strine good, the score stood at 22-14 Reading. Reading then would stop the Chargers on their next possession on a fourth and five, giving the Rangers the ball back at the UC 44 yard line with 9:26 left in the half. Giberson once again broke off a big 39-yard run, all the way down to the one yard line before he was stripped of the ball by Union City defender Thomas Anderson. Union City recovered the ball in the end zone for a touchback with 8:38 left to play in the half. The two teams traded possessions until a 36-yard touchdown run by Jalen Boes with 58 seconds remaining in the half made the score 22-20. Bruce hit Colin Kreger in the end zone for the two point conversion and the score stood at 22-22. The scoring was not done yet for the high octane first half, as Creager took Reading’s first play after the kickoff 65-yards for a Ranger touchdown. The PAT was no good, leaving the score at 28-22 Reading with 43.6 seconds remaining in the half. Page 2 of 3 - Reading tried to kick away from Union City’s speed on the next kick off, but a great recovery by the Chargers set Union City up with the ball at the 50-yard line with less than 40 seconds remaining in the first half. An odd series of plays, including several Reading penalties, a few time outs, and a few Charger pass plays led to a Bruce two yard run with 1.8 seconds. The two point conversion was no good, leaving the score at 28-28 heading into the half. At the half, the Union City High School student body named senior Morgan Welke their 2015 Homecoming Queen, much to the delight of the packed crowd. Union City received the ball coming out of the half, as they took the opening drive the length of the field, capped off by a Thomas Anderson 17-yard run. With the Bruce two point conversion Union City took the lead 36-28. Reading turned the ball over on downs on their next possession after two sacks by the Charger defense. Bruce found Kreger for a big 47-yard gain down the home sidelines, with Kreger going out of bounds at the three yard line. Bruce scored again from three yards out on the very next play, and with the two-point conversion no good Union City led 42-28, a score which held through the third quarter. Reading opened the fourth quarter with a big play of their own, as Dieterle connected with Giberson deep in Union City territory; however Giberson was stripped of the ball again, with the Chargers recovering at the 5 yard line. Union City went three and out on their next possession as the Reading defense forced a Charger punt. Reading took the ensuing possession 37-yards, capped by a Strine three yard touchdown, and with the two point conversion no good the score stood at 42-34 with 6:39 left. Union City used up a ton of clock on their next possession, using a grinding running attack to move the ball down the field while eating away at the clock. The Charger would put the game away with a Bruce three yard touchdown run, and with the Bruce to Boes two point conversion pass good, the Chargers led 50-34. Reading would turn the ball over on downs on their next possession, leading to the Chargers running out the clock on their big Homecoming win. “They really just stacked the box against us in the second half their, and that really shut us down after the half,” said Reading head coach Rick Bailey. “We just didn’t have the athletes to match up to their spread offense there in the end.” Reading had a big day on the offensive side of the ball, as the Rangers rushed for 487 yards as a team for the game. Page 3 of 3 - Reading was led by Dalton Creager who had 15 carries for 206 yards, while David Giberson added 23 carries for 194 yards in the loss. “They had a really good mix of inside and outside running on us today, which really worked for them,” said Union City head coach Brandon Bruce. “Offensively, we had a big day, we scored when we needed to and we were able to pull out the big win.” Union City was led on the day by Jalen Boes who had eight carries for 93 yards and one touchdown, while Seth Bruce added 17 carries for 63 yards and three touchdowns. Elijah Way added nine carries for 53 yards and Thomas Anderson had six carries for 43 yards and a score. Bruce also went 8 for 17 passing for 152 yards and one touchdown. Colin Kreger caught three passes for 83 yards, while Boes had three catches for 32 yards and one touchdown. Elijah Way led the Chargers with 10 tackles and one sack, while Powell had seven tackles and one fumble recovery for a touchdown. Bruce had eight tackles while Bransom Turley and Thomas Anderson each had six tackles.
