I don't know what Vincent was doing then, what he is doing now. What kind of cricket he played with Chris Cairns or Cairns played with him,\" said Mongia. He said he would consult his lawyers since his image had been tarnished. \"As far as I am concerned, I am totally clean. If there is anything Vincent has against me, let him come out with a proof,\" the 38-year-old said. Commenting on the development after Vincent took his name, Mongia asserted that his conscience was clear and he had nothing to worry. \"Iâ€™ve to admit that when I was playing with them (the Kiwis), I never ever imagined they were into some kind of wrongdoings,\" he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T15:00:30.494+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
