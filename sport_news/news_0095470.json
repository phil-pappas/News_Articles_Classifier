It's fair to say I was completely surprised, too. \n\"I haven't played much rugby this season, and the international stage has been a big step up, but I've loved every second of it.\" \nBennett made his international debut in Scotland's 41-31 autumn Test win over Argentina at BT Murrayfield last year. \nHe went on to make his mark in the RBS 6 Nations, donning the starting 13 shirt in all five games and scoring against both Italy and England. \nHe opened his World Cup with a brace of touchdowns in the 45-10 victory over Japan which kicked-off Scotland's tournament. \nBut despite crossing the whitewash again with just seven minutes left against the Aussies, his side were denied a place in the last four when referee Craig Joubert wrongly awarded Michael Cheika's team a last-minute kick at goal which ultimately saw them scrape a 35-34 win. \nAustralia will now take on the All Blacks in Sunday's final but Bennett is staying positive. \nHe said: \"It's surreal that as a child I sat and watched the Rugby World Cup and now I'm one of the guys kids watch. \n\"We felt that we did so well as a team, and were unfortunate not to progress further in the competition. \n\"The support was unreal. There was a great Scottish contingent at every match throughout, and especially at the final game against Australia - it felt like the whole of Twickenham was behind us.\" \nThe award winner will be announced at the World Rugby Awards dinner in London on Sunday, November 1.
