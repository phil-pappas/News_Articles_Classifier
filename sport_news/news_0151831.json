Rusher Mike Warren also carried it 18 times for 175 yards, putting up the most rushing yardage for a Cyclone since 2006. \nKU's offense never got going, either. The Jayhawks mustered just six points on their own (seven came from an 83-yard pick-six from linebacker Marcquis Roberts) while managing just 4.1 yards per play. \nKU also lost its second quarterback to injury. Montell Cozart left late in the third quarter after suffering a left shoulder sprain. Freshman Ryan Willis filled in the rest of the game, completing 8 of 16 passes for 100 yards. \nLast week, Deondre Ford left the game after suffering a thumb sprain. \nThere were questionable calls from KU's coaching staff as well. \nThe most puzzling of which came in the second quarter with KU trailing by three and facing a fourth-and-3 from the ISU 35. Beaty at first sent out his kicker, Matthew Wyman, to attempt a 52-yard field goal with the wind at his back. Then, the coach called timeout. \nAfter thinking about it, the coach of a 20-point underdog elected for ultra-conservatism, sending out his punt team. The kick bounced into the end zone, netting 15 yards and killing one of KU’s best chances at scoring all day. \nThe biggest discrepancy between the teams was on the ground. ISU outrushed KU, 243-38, marking the second straight game the Jayhawks were dominated up front. \nKU (0-4) will play host to Baylor at 11 a.m. on Oct. 10.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T22:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T22:46:21.608+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
