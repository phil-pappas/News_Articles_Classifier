They contend the 6’7”​ Sefolosha humiliated a 5’7” police officer by calling him a “midget” and that Sefolosha acted with a “sense of entitlement” as officers investigated a crime scene. The jury apparently found Sefolosha’s account more believable or experienced “reasonable doubt” in assessing the criminal charges.\nSefolosha did not have to stand trial and could have settled the case essentially without penalty. Last month, prosecutors offered Sefolosha a remarkably favorable deal: if he participated in one day of community service and avoided legal issues for six months, the charges against him would be dropped and his record would be cleared. Many, if not most, defendants charged with crimes would quickly accept such an offer. Sefolosha declined, reasoning that he had done nothing wrong and he wanted to use the trial to expose the arresting police officers as treating him in a racist way. This was a serious gamble by Sefolosha. Had he been convicted of the two charges, each of those charges would have carried a possible sentence of up to 12 months in jail. Even if Judge Robert Mandelbaum had only imposed a suspended sentence or probation (that is, no jail time), such a sentence would have been damaging to Sefolosha’s reputation. Sefolosha could have also faced league discipline if he had been convicted. \nSefolosha also did not have to testify in his own defense and yet did so. The Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution allowed Sefolosha to remain silent during the trial. Had he declined to testify, Judge Mandelbaum would have instructed the jury that they could not use Sefolosha’s silence against him in assessing the charges. Defendants often do not testify because doing so carries considerable risk: while on the witness stand, defendants must answer difficult questions posed by seasoned prosecutors who are in the business of asking questions that make defendants seem guilty. \nRather than shy away from prosecutors’ questions, Sefolosha took the stand and testified under penalty of perjury. According to his account, Sefolosha, along with teammate Pero Antic , were merely attempting to get a ride in an Uber car back to their team’s hotel when they were confronted by a group of combative and argumentative police officers. Antic also testified on Sefolosha’s behalf. He recalled that the officers seemed to take particular offense to Sefolosha attempting to give money to a panhandler named Amos Canty.

To assert claims under New York law, Sefolosha would have needed to file a notice of claim with the New York City Comptroller’s Office within 90 days of his arrest on Apr. 8. Alternatively, for Sefolosha to assert a federal civil rights claim under 42 U.S.C. § 1983—sometime known as a “Section 1983 claim”—he could wait until Apr. 8, 2018 to file a lawsuit. Under state or federal law, Sefolosha would generally argue that the police officers lacked probable cause to arrest him and that they unlawfully acted in a racially insensitive and injurious way. \nWhile a police misconduct lawsuit could take many months, if not years, to play out, Sefolosha’s legal team could play the long game. They would likely attempt to use the pretrial discovery process to uncover the employment records of the officers who arrested him. Sefolosha would be interested in whether those officers have exhibited a pattern of controversial arrests and whether they have been accused of causing unlawful injuries. \nIf Sefolosha could show that the police officers broke the law in arresting him and caused his injuries, it is plausible that Sefolosha could establish considerable economic damages. While limited on offense, Sefolosha is regarded as one of the best defensive shooting guards in the NBA. Last season, he ranked fourth among NBA shooting guards in defensive Real Plus-Minus and he previously earned a spot on the NBA’s All-Defensive Second Team. If Sefolosha loses some of his quickness and skill due to the arrest-related injuries, he could quickly find himself out of the NBA.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T22:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T00:15:54.535+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
