(Photo: Community Recorder file) Buy Photo 2 CONNECT 1 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nThe St. Henry boys' cross country team is 2-for-2 with a sweep of top team and individual honors in its last two appearances, including last week's competitive Diocese of Covington meet at Devou Park and the power-packed Saturday Night Lights Centerville Stampede. \nThe frontrunner for the Crusaders has been Josh Hannon. The senior is enjoying a nice finishing kick to his high school career thanks to a solid work ethic. \n\"They say you reap what you sow, and Josh has been working his tail off,\" St. Henry coach Ernie Brooks said. \"Hopefully, he can put himself in a position to win more championships later in the season.\" \nHannon paced a St. Henry boys' sweep at the Diocese of Covington meet at Devou Park, leading four Crusaders among the top 11 finishers with a winning 5-kilometer time of 18 minutes and 13 seconds. Villa Madonna's Zack Werner was runner-up, 19 seconds behind Hannon. The Crusaders scored 44 points. Covington Catholic (57) was second, followed by Bishop Brossart (61) and Villa Madonna (77). \nNotre Dame Academy put four in the top eight and won the dramatic Diocese of Covington girls' meet with 30 points. Bishop Brossart, led by individual champion Becca Schroer, was second with 57. Schroer, a freshman, nosed out Notre Dame runner-up Eliza Lenihan by a fraction of a second. Both were credited with finishing times of 22:46. Third-place Natalie Kleier of Notre Dame was right behind in 22:49. \nHannon and St. Henry also won the Division II championships at the Saturday Night Lights Centerville Stampede in Centerville. Hannon clocked in with a personal-best 16:11, more than seven seconds faster than the runner-up. The Crusaders scored 101 points, good for a 38-point margin over second-place Kettering Fairmont (139). \nScott's Chris Stoeckel (16:40) was fourth in Centerville. Bishop Brossart's Adam Hartig finished 10th. Brossart placed seventh as a team in Division II. Scott was 19th. Renee Svec was third for the third-place St. Henry girls in Division II. Teammate Holly Blades was ninth. \nHannon has a big hurdle between he and his third meet victory in a row Saturday at the St. Henry Invitational at Idlewild Park in Florence. Highlands' Ethan Shuley, the top runner in the state with a time of 15:16.89, is competing solo. \n\"It'd be nice to see Josh win,\" Brooks said. \"Ethan is the best runner up here, and, in my opinion, one of the top 25 runners in the country, so it'll be a challenge. If Josh wins it, he will have earned it.\" \nElsewhere last week, the Walton-Verona girls put three runners in the top five and won the North Central Kentucky Conference championship at the meet hosted by Carroll County at General Butler State Park in Carrollton. Madison Lohr, Ashley Akins and Megan Wells finished 3-4-5 for the Bearcats. \nThe Walton-Verona boys finished NCKC runner-up. 2 CONNECT 1 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://cin.ci/1Lf7cRw TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T05:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T09:30:30.775+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
