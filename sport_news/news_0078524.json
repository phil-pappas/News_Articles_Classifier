That hit, off closer Roberto Osuna, cost the Jays a win that would have kept them in line for home-field advantage in a match up with Kansas City. Historically, home field is not a big deal, but it’s hard not to think that the ALCS would have unfolded differently if the Blue Jays had started the series with two games in their park. \nThere was the ball that Edwin Encarnacion missed by, maybe, millimetres, in the 13th inning in Game 2 of the Division Series against Texas. That ball, caught within steps of the Rogers Centre wall, would have evened the series at 1-1 and, most likely, kept manager John Gibbons away from using David Price in a must-win Game 4, a move that threw the starting rotation into mild disarray for the rest of the playoff run. \nThere was the pickoff move in the bottom of the eighth inning in that same game. Brett Cecil hung up Texas’ Mike Napoli off first, but in the ensuing rundown Cecil tore a calf muscle on what looked like a perfectly routine baseball play. The Cecil injury had a disastrous cascading effect on Toronto: It’s why Price was turned into an emergency reliever against Texas and why, when he started to stumble just a bit in Game 2 against Kansas City, Gibbons left him on the mound to face Royals lefties Mike Moustakas and Alex Gordon, each of whom drove in runs to turn a Blue Jays lead into a deficit. Put another way: if Brett Cecil is healthy the Jays probably win Game 2 and we never speak again of David Price and his playoff woes. \nPrice, of course, is the single biggest question about the Blue Jays of 2016. There is the matter of general manager Alex Anthopoulos, who doesn’t have a contract for next year, and incoming president Mark Shapiro, but if the team manages to sign Price to some kind of $200-million deal — which they should absolutely try to do — then this team is the favourite to win the AL East immediately. They still might be, absent Price, given the rest of the assets. \nManagement could decide for a more dramatic reshape, with Edwin Encarnacion and Jose Bautista entering their final years, but that seems unwise. What kind of lunatic front office blows up a roster that just satisfied a 22-year wait for lasting post-season memories? Reload with the team that finished 2015 so close to the World Series, and take your chances with the playoff lottery once more. \nToronto vs. Everybody, again. They would have pretty good odds in the rematch.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T23:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T00:34:31.311+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
