The store credit card is owned by Comenity Bank, whose parent company, Alliance Data Systems, bought Barneys' private-label credit card portfolio for $37.1 million in 2013, according to government filings.\nGinard said that staff fear that Barneys has a plan to force out older, more experienced staff and replace them with younger, less experienced workers.\nBarneys management did not immediately return calls seeking comment Monday morning.\nGinard said unionization votes in Beverly Hills and Las Vegas are pending. Barneys workers in New York and New Jersey have been unionized for decades, having signed a deal with the store's late founder, Barney Pressman, he said.\nkjanssen@tribpub.com\nTwitter @kimjnews\n Business", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-56005421/turbine/ct-barneys-union-0922-biz-20150921", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-561bc22f/turbine/ct-barneys-union-1013-biz-20151012"], "published": "2015-10-12T17:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T19:30:05.913+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
