(Photo: Daniel Mears, Detroit News) \nAllen Park — The Lions welcomed a few key players back to practice Wednesday, but a couple of starters remained on the sideline.\nDefensive tackle Haloti Ngata (calf) and strong safety James Ihedigbo (undisclosed) both sat Wednesday. Ngata missed last week’s game due to the injury, and Ihedigbo played through a quad injury that had limited him in practice.\nFortunately, tight end Eric Ebron (knee) and running back Joique Bell (ankle) both returned to practice. Ebron sat all last week, including the game, after suffering his injury in Week 4.\nBell, meanwhile, missed the last two games with an injury that has lingered since the offseason. It’s unclear how much of a role he’ll have when he returns as rookie Zach Zenner has performed adequately as the between-the-tackles runner and a pass blocker.\nLinebacker Tahir Whitehead suffered an apparent left knee injury during the portion of practice open to the media. Fellow linebacker DeAndre Levy (hip) was watching practice, meaning he has yet to undergo surgery for his hip injury.\nThe Lions will release a report later Wednesday listing which players were limited.\njkatzenstein@detroitnews.com \ntwitter.com/jkatzenstein", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T18:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T22:45:29.326+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
