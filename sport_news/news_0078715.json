If you've got a photo story to tell, email us at online@oregonian.com . This first installment is by guest photographer, writer and Instagrammer Kate Rivera.\nHow can I best describe what it's like to live and work on a farm? Well, I can say that there is a lot of walking involved. And sort of jogging and waving arms at animals who have escaped their fencing.\nIt's inventing new curse words while slogging out to some remote spot in order to chase the sheep back, but then happening across the most pastoral scene ever and spending the next 10 minutes telling the sheep how beautiful they are.\nKate Rivera At any given time, there is hay in my hair and in my bra because I lifted the flakes up too high over my head when I was getting ready to toss it into the mangers and it went inside my t-shirt. There's some in there now. It itches.\nKate Rivera It's very green here, so exquisitely green. We're surrounded by the woods, and the garden and pastures have been irrigated this summer. The orchard hasn't, though, and it's brown. Speaking of the orchard, the other day I caught a sheep standing on her hind legs to pull down a branch of an apple tree in order to pilfer the apples.\nKate Rivera On a farm, there are always chores, and it's not really an option to skip them. We don't have animals here that require milking, but we feed twice a day and open up the barn and the chicken coop to let everyone out in the morning.\nOregon Photographers: Life on a Farm Michelle Nicolosi | The Oregonian/OregonLive All the animals here spend their days on pasture. At night they are fed again and locked up for their safety. Water is a whole logistical thing on a farm. Water for the animals, water for the crops. Hauling water. Moving irrigation pipes. Frozen water. Priming pumps. Cleaning and re-filling water troughs. Water, water, water.\nKate Rivera We are sleuths, because... well, mysterious things happen occasionally. Like the two lambs we found out in the field this spring, obviously born a few hours earlier but with no ewe claiming them. There was the horse this morning on the wrong side of a fence, but with no gate open. Did he jump?\nLife on a Farm Kate Rivera Sheep will squeeze under fencing or find secret pathways under bridges, so we'll spend time looking for and eliminating the weak points. Or we may have to investigate when we suspect a chicken is hiding her eggs.\nMainly, to be on a farm is to be a caretaker to these quirky, delightful animals and this gorgeous land. To embrace the work - and all the walking - and to revel in the quiet evenings and the knowledge that the day was spent growing good food.\nKate Rivera works at Leaping Lamb Farm ( http://leapinglambfarm.com/ ), a small family farm in the Coast Range, near the little town of Alsea. The farmers, Scottie and Greg Jones, raise lambs for market, and grow their own hay and vegetables. They also host a farm stay, offering travelers the chance to experience life on a working farm while staying in a private cottage on the property. Kate and her husband, Dennis, raise a few sheep and a flock of chickens at home. Using her phone's camera, Kate attempts to capture the funny personalities of the animals, or the beautiful mood and lighting around the farm.
