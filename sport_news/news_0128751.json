I won't be doing that again, that's for sure. \n\"I made a mistake but there's no room for that in rugby. I've apologised to the boys and it won't be happening again.\" \nVictory in Newcastle on Saturday will book Scotland a place in the quarter-finals. \nSamoa's hopes of clinching a knock-out slot are already finished after back-to-back losses against the South Africans and Japan. \nBut Hogg is still wary of what the Pacific Islanders could do to the Scots' own ambitions. \nHe said: \"The longer these teams stay in a game they grow arms and legs. You have to shut them down. When we have opportunities have to take them and finish them off . Every opportunity we get just keep that scoreboard ticking over. \n\"We learned a lot from last week and we can't revert back to type about how Scotland teams of old used to play. We tried to take teams on physically and it didn't work for us. \n\"We've worked all summer and during the Six Nations on this game plan and how we want to play. It's completely different to what we did last week. We're going back to the way we want to play and hopefully it'll get us the win. \n\"There is a high expectation in this squad that we will qualify but it comes down to what we do on the pitch. The belief is high and so is the confidence. However, we will need a complete performance to win.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T06:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T19:59:36.928+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
