Comment Posted Oct. 26, 2015 at 10:00 AM By Karen Patterson Posted Oct. 26, 2015 at 10:00 AM » RELATED CONTENT • Cubs fans in 2015 postseason FREEPORT — Many of the athletes who use Little Cubs Field in Freeport may not remember a time before it was built in 2007. However, Little Cubs Field Board President Mark Winter still remembers the phone call from Denny Garkey that began the whole process. It was early on a Sunday morning, and Garkey called to say that \"he had an idea. It wasn't the first time he called like that,\" Winter said. The initial phone call led to conversations with local Chicago Cubs fans with the knowledge and expertise needed to create a miniature replica of Wrigley Field . Eventually the group met with the Wrigley family seeking licensing permission to name the proposed field after the famous ballpark. Winter said the family's attorneys politely declined. The undeterred group next approached the Tribune Company , which owned the Cubs at the time. \"(The Cubs) came on board right away,\" Winter said. \"That was the turning point.\" Organizers were granted permission to use the logos, the iconic hand-operated scoreboard, the trademark red sign over the main gates, and even the ivy. There are even flags of the retired numbers attached to the right- and left-field foul poles, just like at Wrigley Field. The only stipulation by the Cubs and Major League Baseball ? Don't sell the rights or rip off the team. \"It's a unique relationship, and there's nothing else like it in the world,\" Garkey said. John Boettener lives across the street from the field on South McKinley Avenue and said it's not uncommon to look out his front window and see cars slow down as they drive by on West Empire Street, or watch people get out and take photos. There have even been a few weddings at the field, Boettener said. \"It's great to see the kids using it and people enjoying it,\" he said. \"Denny did a great job of communicating with the neighbors when it was being built. I don't think any of us minds living so close.\" The field was built with nearly $500,000 in donated labor, supplies and discounted supplies, and opened on April 25, 2008, according to Garkey. Winter said supplies to build the gift shop were donated, and much of the concrete was provided at a discounted cost. \"I like to tell the story about when the brick layers were working, the local hotels put them up for free, and the restaurants fed them for free, and nobody questioned it,\" Garkey said. \"That sort of thing doesn't just happen.\" Page 2 of 2 - The organization currently leases the land from the Freeport Park District . Both Garkey and Winter spoke highly of the relationship between the two agencies. Garkey said the field generates about $300,000 annually for the local economy through tourists and tournaments. But to all involved, the field is more than a source of tourism revenue. It's a way to connect kids of all ages to the sport they love. \"The relationship we have (with the Cubs) is very uncommon,\" Garkey said. \"I think Cubs fans should be proud of the organization for how they've treated us and that they've allowed this to happen.\" Karen Patterson: 815-232-0133; Karen.patterson@journalstandard.com ; @KarenP_FJS By Karen Patterson", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T17:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T18:23:25.558+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
