(Photo: PTI) Hyderabad: AICC vice-president Rahul Gandhi has written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi requesting that he announce special category status for AP.\nMr Quote: : “Since you are visiting AP to lay the foundation stone for its new capital Amaravati, I would like to urgently request you to use this opportunity to grant special category status and announce a time frame for the fulfilment of the commitments made in the Reorganisation Act.”\nMr Gandhi said over one year has lapsed since the NDA government came to power, but many of the commitments made to AP including special category status remained unfulfilled.\n “I have been to AP twice over the last year. Everywhere I went, I could sense the severe disappointment and pain the people were in due to the Centre’s failure to honour its commitments,” Mr Gandhi wrote.\nStates: Andhra Pradesh nation South Rahul Gandhi Narendra Modi Also Read IIPM, ISBE told to refund five students Pushkaralu: Only 65 per cent works done PM Narendra Modi vows to halt illegal immigrants from Bangladesh Happy to bask in ‘Suitable Boy’ Vikram’s glory: Leila Seth", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/share?url=http://deccan-lb-1621008713.ap-southeast-1.elb.amazonaws.com/151020/nation-current-affairs/article/rahul-gandhi-modi-andhra-pradesh-needs-special-category-status", "http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/connect.php/js/FB.Share", "http://campaign.bharatmatrimony.com/track/clicktrack.php?trackid=00100326114361", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/styles/article_node_view/public/Rahul%20Gandhi.__0_0_0.jpg", "https://apis.google.com/js/plusone.js", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/Rahul%20Gandhi.__0_0_0.jpg", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/BharatMatrimony_texlink_banner_620x40px.gif", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php", "http://vuukle.com/js/vuukle.js", "http://deccan-lb-1621008713.ap-southeast-1.elb.amazonaws.com/151020/nation-current-affairs/article/rahul-gandhi-modi-andhra-pradesh-needs-special-category-status"], "published": "2015-10-20T08:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T22:31:55.272+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
