He made just two putts outside of five feet but on the flip side he managed to get into the weekend action. \n\n\"Didn't hole anything really,\" said McIlroy. \"Kind of the story of the day.\" \n\n\"Just very frustrating,\" he added. \"I just need to see some putts going in the hole, get some confidence. I think it's more mental than anything else.\" \n\nThe cut in the PGA Tour's season opening event was set at two-under 142.
