But if you haven’t, please allow me to elaborate. The ground-breaking Adverse Childhood Experiences or ACEs study (1998) took a look at how childhood trauma affected adults later in life. The study asked mostly middle-class, white (74.8 percent), employed, college-educated (75.2 percent) adults who were patients of Kaiser Permanente whether they experienced the following things in childhood: verbal, physical, or sexual abuse, neglect, loss of a parent through death, separation or divorce, having a family member in prison, witnessing violence at home, or living with someone with a mental health issue or a drug or alcohol abuse problem. In order to calculate a person’s ACE score, the researchers gave one point for every category, regardless of the number of instances that occurred within that category. Here’s what they found: Almost two thirds (63.9 percent) of the 17,000 adults surveyed experienced one or more ACEs in childhood, while 12.5 percent reported having four or more ACEs. (The ACEs that were most common were physical abuse, living with someone who abused drugs or alcohol, and loss of a parent.) The researchers, Dr. Vincent Felitti and Dr. Robert Anda, further found that experiencing these ACEs greatly increased the risk of disease and participating in harmful behaviors. They discovered that a person with four or more ACEs had a 160-percent higher chance of having diabetes, 190-percent higher chance of having cancer, 220-percent higher chance of experiencing coronary heart disease, and 240-percent higher chance of experiencing a stroke. Having four or more ACEs also increased a person’s chances of being an alcoholic (by 740 percent), using injection drugs (by 1,030 percent), and attempting suicide (by 1,220 percent). Clearly the ACEs study implicates that disease and risky behaviors likely harken back to an adult’s early experiences in childhood, where, shrouded by secrecy, decades later, reappear as forms of disease and addiction.
