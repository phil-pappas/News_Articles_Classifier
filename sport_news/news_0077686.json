Mandatory Credit: Matthew Emmons-USA TODAY Sports Bevo XIV, Texas' live longhorn mascot, is sick and in need of your thoughts.\nThe school announced Wednesday that the beloved steer will not be attending Saturday's game at the Cotton Bowl in Dallas against No. 10 Oklahoma because of a life-threatening illness that veterinarians are monitoring. Bevo XIV has been Texas' mascot since 2004.\nBevo XIV will not be attending this weekend's OU game due to a life-threatening condition.

The 2,100-pound steer with a horn span measuring 82 inches tip-to-tip has certainly witnessed better days, including the 2005 national championship. The Austin American-Statesman pegs his record at 106-41.\nLonghorn Nation. Please send your thoughts and prayers to my big brother @BEVO_XIV who needs our support right now. Get better BEVO!\n— Hook 'Em (@HookEm) October 7, 2015 “Bevo is a fighter, a symbol of strength and who fans across the world care deeply about,” Ricky Brennes, the executive director of the Silver Spurs Alumni Association, said in a statement released by school officials. “We are carefully monitoring Bevo’s condition at this time and will update the public as we find out more about his condition.”\nMORE NEWS: Want stories delivered to you?
