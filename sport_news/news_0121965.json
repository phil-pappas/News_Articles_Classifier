No. 21 Mississippi State (3-1, 1-1) makes a visit Saturday to Kyle Field.\nWhen Allen found freshman receiver Christian Kirk for a 20-yard touchdown pass on the second play in overtime, it resulted from a play that Allen checked into at the line.\nAllen said he planned to hit receiver Ricky Seals-Jones over the middle.\nBut Allen noticed the Razorbacks were playing man coverage on Kirk with a nickel back that Kirk had been beating. Allen slipped the ball into Kirk's hands on the left side of the end zone.\n\"The one-on-one matchup, I'm going to take that every time with [Kirk],\" Allen said. \"He ran a great route and got open just enough for me to put the ball in there.\"\nWhile the Aggies are struggling in some areas -- particularly inside the 20 and on third-down conversions -- Allen delivered Saturday with A&M trailing 21-13 and four minutes to play.\nAllen went 7 of 9 for 129 yards and a touchdown in the fourth quarter and overtime. He finished 21 of 28 for a career-high 358 yards and two touchdowns, with no turnovers.\n\"You've seen his play elevate in tough times,\" offensive coordinator Jake Spavital said. \"The fourth quarter and overtime, he was making such mature decisions that he probably wouldn't get to last year.\"\nFollow Kate Hairopoulos on Twitter at @khairopoulos .\nOn Twitter:\n @kHairopoulos", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/khairopoulos", "https://twitter.com/kHairopoulos"], "published": "2015-09-30T05:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T05:57:26.715+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
