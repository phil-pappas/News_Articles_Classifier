Ludwig-USA TODAY Sports Bills head coach Rex Ryan issued a warning to Titans QB Marcus Mariota ahead of the Week 5 clash between the teams. Rex Ryan's Buffalo Bills may have been beaten at home last weekend and are only 2-2, but that's not stopping the head coach from talking big. (To be fair, not much does.)\nAdChoices Ryan on Wednesday issued a caution to Tennessee Titans rookie QB Marcus Mariota ahead of Sunday's Week 5 clash between the teams.\n“I don’t think the kid will have his way against us,” Ryan told the Buffalo media via The Tennesseean. “I don’t think that’s going to happen.”\nHe never learns, does he? Ryan's Bills allowed 40 points to Tom Brady and the Pats in Week 2, and they surrendered 24 at home to the Giants in Week 4. He seems unreasonably confident about his team's chances of shutting down the No. 2 overall pick and the Titans' offense.\nMariota, for the record, has thrown for 833 yards and eight touchdowns this season. Maybe we'll be looking at another Dion Lewis situation come Sunday night.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.yardbarker.com/", "http://www.tennessean.com/story/sports/nfl/titans/2015/10/07/rex-ryan-marcus-mariota-kid-wont-have-his-way-us/73544756/", "http://larrybrownsports.com/football/dion-lewis-rex-ryan-td-video/274662", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T15:43:59.886+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
