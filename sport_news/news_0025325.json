Orlando Sentinel \nIt took awhile to get going but once Florida State hit its stride on Saturday, it pulled away from Louisville for a 41-21 win. \nThe win was the 28th straight in the ACC for the Seminoles. \nFSU trailed the Cardinals 7-6 at the half before scoring touchdowns on the first five drives of the second half to pull away. \nEverett Golson finished with 372 yards on 26-of-38 passing with three touchdowns and no interceptions. \nThe Seminoles still do not have an offensive turnover all season long. \nDavlin Cook picked up the pace in the second half too, finishing with 163 yards after only having 29 in the first half. He left the game midway through the fourth quarter after clutching his injured hamstring during a run. \nCook had two touchdowns rushing. \nFreshman quarterback Lamar Jackson tossed three touchdowns in the loss for Louisville. Jackson, who entered the game with the third-most rushing yards for a freshman in college football, was held to just 32 yards rushing on 19 carries.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T22:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T23:34:38.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
