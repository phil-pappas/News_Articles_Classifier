Photograph by: Jeff McIntosh , THE CANADIAN PRESS \nIt didn’t take long to realize this Canucks season won’t be quite like last year. \nThen, the Canucks went three deep with quality NHL goalies. \nThis season? Well, it remains to be seen. \nThe Canucks recalled Richard Bachman Wednesday after Jacob Markstrom was sidelined with an injury. \nBachman is the journeyman netminder who played for Willie Desjardins when he was in the Dallas Stars organization. \nHe is now, and in the near future, the Canucks’ backup. \nHow much confidence does Desjardins have in him? \nWe may be about to find out. \nMarkstrom tweaked something (lower body) at the end of the Canucks’ final practice before the regular season, in Vancouver on Tuesday. \nHis head coach, Desjardins, said it seemed like “nothing,” but an MRI is needed to determine severity. \n“It might take a couple of days to make a full evaluation,” Desjardins said. \n“You never know for sure.” \nMarkstrom was to start his first game of the season as early as next week. Injured already, that should probably be a no-go right now, no matter what the MRI shows. \nThe Canucks have their opening back-to-back games Monday and Tuesday on a trip to California. \nUntil now, in the Ryan Miller era, the Canucks have tried to avoid starting the 35-year-old goalie in back-to-back situations. \nEven if Markstrom’s injury lasts into next week, the Canucks should not alter any plans to give Miller a day off on one of those games in California. \nMiller’s health is now more important to the success of this team than at any point last year. \nThe Canucks have rebuilt themselves by infusing the lineup with a surprising amount of youth. \nA big reason Miller is in Vancouver, and getting $6 million a year, is because of the plan to replenish an aging core with younger players. \nMiller’s veteran savvy is supposed to balance out the mistakes that are inevitably going to be made by young players. \nIt’s why Canucks general manager Jim Benning never considered going into a season with Markstrom and Eddie Lack as his goalies. \nBut Miller is 35 and hasn’t played 60 games in a season in three years. He is playing for a team that has one of the toughest travel schedules in the league. \nThe start of the season is one of the riskier times to be pushing a goalie’s playing time, so why push him? \nThe plan to avoid starting him in two games in two days is a sound one and it’s not one that should change. \nBachman has started 30 games in his NHL career, and has a .904 save percentage. \nOne of those starts came for the Edmonton Oilers last year against the Los Angeles Kings. Bachman made 25 saves on 27 shots, and the Oilers won 4-2. It was a huge game for the Kings and one of the deathblows to their postseason hopes. \nIt also, interestingly enough, clinched the Canucks’ playoff berth. \nCoincidentally, the Canucks’ game on Tuesday, the back half of the back-to-backs, is in L.A. against the Kings.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T00:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T02:10:11.340+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
