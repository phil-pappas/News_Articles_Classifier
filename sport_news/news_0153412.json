The deer season in zone D-6, which covers much of Tuolumne County, will be open until Nov. 1 and the seasons in zones D-3 through D-5, in the north county, will open tomorrow . Due to the ongoing cleanup in that area, there may likely be some road closures as a result of the Butte Fire. For more information, visit www.wildlife.ca.gov >hunting. Also coming up this month on Oct. 17 will be the opening of quail and chukar partridge season. The daily limit for quail is 10 and six for chukars. The northeastern zone for waterfowl hunting will open Oct. 10 and the Balance of State zone will open Oct 24 . The big problem, as expected, will be water. Most private clubs will be allowed about 65-percent of normal. Some clubs will hold off on their allotment for a few weeks, when more migratory birds may arrive. The limits are much the same as last year with seven ducks per day: mallards are seven per day with only two hens; sprig is two; canvasback is two; redhead is two; scaup (bluebill) is three; geese, which have increased greatly over the past years is 25 per day, of which 15 may be the white species and 10 of the dark species. Only two of which may be greater Canadaâ€™s. At New Melones Reservoir, the lake level dropped another 2-feet last week and the surface temperature cooled to 72 to 76-degrees which could improve the bite for trout and bass. The boat access at Glory Hole Point has changed slightly as the old road took a turn to the right. At first, it was a little muddy, but gravel is being brought in to make it better. 4-wheel drive is highly recommended. Fishing has been slow for trout and the kokanee have mostly gone upriver to spawn. Bass fishing is fair for those specialized anglers and the best action of late is for catfish, who are mainly bottom feeders, but will come up to feed on shad. Anchovies, mackerel, and nightcrawlers, as well as chicken liver are good baits. Along the highway 108 corridor, stream fishing is still ongoing in the Strawberry area and on up to Kennedy Meadows. Pinecrest is still giving up trout to the few anglers getting out and the water level is still up on the launch ramp. The last word from the marina was that they expected to be open until mid-October. For more information, call 965-3333.
