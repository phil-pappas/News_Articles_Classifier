She’ll maybe score one or two goals a game, but I always assign her to the toughest player,” said Bret Harte coach Mark Garrett. “We had a pretty good team against Stagg to play; they had a player who scores seven or eight goals a game and Bekah pretty much shut her down. Every game is like that; she’s our premier defender.” \nPowell was on the inaugural Bret Harte water polo team last season and also swam for her school since her freshman year, so she has some experience in the water. Her defense will be a leading force for the Bullfrogs as the season continues. \n“She’s tough as nails. She’s our team leader and also our team captain,” Garrett said. \n– Joe Klarer \n“She’s tough as nails.
