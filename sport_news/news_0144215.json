Their top players are coming into form, as they showed in a 2-1 victory over Colorado on Sunday night in front of 18,230 at Staples Center.\nFirst-line winger Marian Gaborik, conspicuously quiet to start the season, scored a skillful first-period goal, second-line winger Tyler Toffoli scored on a breakaway and goalie Jonathan Quick looked sharp again.\nThat’s a pretty good trifecta for the Kings, who now have consecutive victories and better efforts from their top players. The Kings still need more goals – Toffoli has scored three of their six this season – but they’re at least generating more chances.\n“It's early in the year. We weren't panicking when we lost the first three, and we're not going to (inflate) our heads now that we've won two in a row.” Toffoli said.\nSaid defenseman Jake Muzzin: “It's just playing simpler, getting pucks in behind the defense and creating chances. We're holding on to the puck and cycling and getting bodies and pucks to the net.”\nThe Kings got more consistent four-line offensive pressure than in any of their four previous games, and Quick – who allowed nine goals in his initial two starts – stopped 21 of 22 shots. The Kings totaled 40 shots on goal.\n“We stayed with it,” Toffoli said. “We worked hard and we moved the puck. We're just playing a lot faster in our own zone.”\nIt wasn’t a flawless game. Offensive-zone penalties continue to be a preventable problem for the Kings. They were called for three against the Avalanche in the first two periods, and lost the lead because of one.\nMatt Duchene’s second-period power-play goal tied the game 1-1, but Toffoli scored 23 seconds later to restore the Kings’ lead. Toffoli stripped the puck from a Colorado player in the neutral zone, skated in alone and beat Reto Berra with a wrist shot.\nToffoli, who had 23 goals last season, now has an even-strength goal, a power-play goal and a shorthanded goal in five games this season.\nThe Kings had taken a 1-0 lead with 6:22 remaining in the first period after Drew Doughty carried the puck into the Colorado zone and held it long enough to get the Avalanche defenders out of position.\nDustin Brown, at the right point, then found Gaborik all alone in the high slot, and Gaborik ripped a wrist shot past Berra. Berra, Colorado’s usual backup goalie, was coming off a shutout of the Ducks and hadn’t allowed a goal in his previous 203 minutes, dating to late last season.\nColorado played without one of its top defensemen, Tyson Barrie, who received a three-game suspension for a hit on Ducks defenseman Simon Despres in Friday’s game.\nContact the writer: rhammond@ocregister.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T09:18:33.776+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
