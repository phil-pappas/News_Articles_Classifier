That's part of the reason Henry Clay was \"clicking on all cylinders,\" Coach Tim Bernardi said. \nIndians advance too \nA morsel of controversy might have been what Madison Central needed to spark a second-half stretch of goals that gave it a 3-0 win over Franklin County in the first round of the 11th Region tournament on Monday at Capitol View Park in Frankfort. \nIn the 54th minute, Bonface Kipchumba collided with Franklin County keeper Mason Parritt as Parritt made a save. Parritt maintained the save but was down for several minutes. He exited the game with a concussion. \nKipchumba was issued a yellow card, with which the Madison sideline didn't agree. Indians assistant coach Stephen Rech was especially displeased; he was issued a red card and removed from the sideline. \nCentral turned up its aggression and found net first on a Dylan Hornsby penalty kick past backup keeper Matthew Melton in the 63rd minute. \nNine minutes later Hunter Jackson gave the Indians (18-3-1) a two-goal edge after taking the ball from right midfield, crossing to the left and digging deep into the box for a pretty finish with his left foot. \nWorthie McGuire iced things for Madison Central with another deep left goal in the final moments. \nThe Indians scored three times but survived an upset bid in large part due to a defense that allowed no Flyers shots in the second half. \n\"We're very strong in the midfield,\" said Madison Central Coach Evan Sutherland, whose team has won 12 of its last 13 games. \"We've played a lot of good teams and we're as good as anybody we feel like in midfield.\" \nSutherland lauded Kipchumba's effort in spite of the penalty he was assessed. That level of aggressive playmaking reveals why he's the Indians' leading goal scorer with 22. \nMadison Central held the Flyers to just two shots in the first half, both of which could have resulted in fairly easy goals. Franklin had a kick stray by the right goal post from the left side in the second minute. On the second, Indians keeper Justin Elkins met a free-kick ball with his body, enough blockage to prevent a scrum of Flyers from getting a point deep in the box. \nFranklin County had won six straight before falling to No. 14 Woodford County in the 41st District championship. \nMADISON CENTRALl 3, FRANKLIN CO. 0 \n11th Region first round at Frankfort \nG— MC: Hornsby (63', PK), Jackson (72'), McGuire (79'). \nGK— MC: Elkins.
