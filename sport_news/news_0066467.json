Trivedi is a fomer controller of examination of Vyavsayik Pariksha Mandal (Vyapam).\nThe special court also served a production warrant against Trivedi to facilitate his personal appearance before it on October 19. Special Judge B K Paloda accepted the plea of Lokayukta police stating that personal appearance of Trivedi, who is currently lodged in Bhopal jail, in the court, will expedite his prosecution.\nOn January 29 last year, Lokayukta police had raided his place in Indore and Bhopal and found wealth allegedly amassed by him disproportionate to known sources of his income. Following this, he was booked under Prevention of Corruption Act.\nAccording to a prosecution officer, he had accummulated wealth to the tune of around Rs 84 lakh which include movable and immovable properties. Trivedi, along with others, had allegedly pocketed huge money as bribes from hundreds of students and people for helping them to crack the Pre Medical Tests (PMTs) and other recruitment tests conducted by Vyapam or MP Professional Examination Board (MPPEB) unlawfully.\nTrivedi, along with others, had allegedly rigged many PMT and recruitment tests under Vyapam scam. The much-talked about Vyapam scam is being investigated by CBI following an apex court s order.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T19:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T21:56:21.129+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
