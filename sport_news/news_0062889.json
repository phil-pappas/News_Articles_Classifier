Trailing 1-4 from the opening day’s foursomes, International skipper Nick Price needed a strong start in Friday’s fourballs and got just that from Branden Grace and Louis Oosthuizen, who beat world number one Jordan Spieth and Dustin Johnson 4&3. More blue went on the board when Thongchai Jaidee and Charl Schwartzel beat Bill Haas and Chris Kirk 2&1, while Bae and New Zealander Danny Lee scored a thrilling victory over Rickie Fowler and Jimmy Walker on the 18th hole. JB Holmes and Bubba Watson got the Americans’ only win of the day, beating Marc Leishman and Steven Bowditch 2-up. Anirban Lahiri was not picked to play today. — Reuters", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T12:19:22.432+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
