''She's an incredible player, she won last year here. But I played a really good match. She played so well the first few games so I tried not to think about this and focus.''\nAlso, Venus Williams beat Carla Suarez Navarro of Spain 6-3, 6-4. A day after earning her 700th victory, Williams hit five aces and saved three of four break points.\nWilliams, a seven-time major champion, improved to 3-3 against Navarro and will next face either top-seeded Simona Halep or Johanna Konta.\nAlso, fifth-seeded Garbine Muguruza of Spain rallied to beat ninth-seeded Ana Ivanovic of Serbia 4-6, 6-1, 6-0.
