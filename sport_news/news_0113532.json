Haffey/Getty Images (NEW YORK) -- Los Angeles Dodgers infielder Chase Utley was booed ahead of Monday night's Game 3 of the National League Division Series against the New York Mets at Citi Field. \nUtley was suspended for games 3 and 4 of the NLDS after breaking Mets player Ruben Tejada's leg during a slide. \nBut Utley has appealed, making him eligible to play in Monday night's game. \nMets manager Terry Collins said he's a little surprised Utley isn't in the Dodgers starting lineup. \n“The players association and my agent are handling the appeals process,\" Utley said in a statement on Monday. \"I have nothing more to say other than to reiterate that I feel terrible about Ruben's injury. Now my teammates and I are focused on Game 3 and doing everything we can to win this series.\" \nA source briefed on the situation told ABC News a hearing for Utley's appeal was highly unlikely on Monday. It's more likely Utley’s appeal will be heard sometime within the next two weeks to give each side time to pull videos and records, make a decision and issue a statement, the source told ABC News. \nMLB Chief Baseball Officer Joe Torre said Sunday, \"After thoroughly reviewing the play from all conceivable angles, I have concluded that Mr. Utley's action warrants discipline. While I sincerely believe that Mr. Utley had no intention of injuring Ruben Tejada, and was attempting to help his Club in a critical situation, I believe his slide was in violation of Official Baseball Rule 5.09 (a)(13), which is designed to protect fielders from precisely this type of rolling block that occurs away from the base.\" \nUtley's agent, Joel Wolfe, called the two-game suspension \"outrageous and completely unacceptable.\" \n\"Chase did what all players are taught to do in this situation — break up the double play,\" Wolfe said. \"We routinely see plays at second base similar to this one that have not resulted in suspensions. Chase feels terrible about Ruben Tejada's injury and everyone who knows him knows that he would never intentionally hurt anybody.\" \nThe Mets support the suspension. \"[We] feel this was the appropriate course of action. With this decision behind us, the team and our fans can now focus on playing winning baseball,\" the Mets said in a statement. \nThe Dodgers and Mets are tied in the NLDS with one game apiece. \nCopyright © 2015, ABC Radio.
