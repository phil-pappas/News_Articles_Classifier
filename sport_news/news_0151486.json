Comment Follow @@pronan_Ledger Posted Oct. 1, 2015 at 10:14 pm Updated at 12:18 AM QUINCY - Some local residents say they’re unequivocally opposed to the state’s plan to allow deer hunting in the Blue Hills Reservation this fall. “We need something that is a little less extreme than what you’re proposing,” Cynthia Haigh of Milton said. About 100 people attended Thursday’s meeting at the Lincoln-Hancock Community School in Quincy to discuss the state’s plan to allow 240 hunters to kill deer in the Blue Hills over four days – on two Mondays, Nov. 30 and Dec. 7, and on two Tuesdays, Dec. 1 and Dec. 8. Thursday’s was the third and final public meeting hosted by the state’s Department of Conservation and Recreation to discuss the controlled hunt, which conservation officials say is needed to cull the deer population. Written comments can still be submitted to the agency online or by mail through Wednesday. The controlled hunt, with shotguns only, would be permitted mostly in areas north of Interstate 93 in Quincy, Milton and Canton. It would be the first legal hunt in the Blue Hills in more than a century. State officials say the Blue Hills is overpopulated with white-tailed deer, estimating there are between 600 and 800 total, or about 85 deer per square mile. Overpopulation has a negative effect on vegetation and forest regeneration, and it also contributes to the spread of Lyme disease from deer ticks and a spike in vehicle collisions, officials said. During the controlled hunt, the state says Chickatawbut and Wompatuck roads would shut down to traffic and portions of the Blue Hills would close to the public. Also, signs would be placed around the park to define hunting areas, and extra police would be on duty to help ensure public safety. Those who spoke during Thursday’s meeting rattled off their safety concerns, for the neighbors whose homes abut the state park, for walkers who may not know about the hunt and for the hunters themselves, each of whom will have only 30 acres of land in which to hunt. Other concerns were traffic and the welfare of the deer. “We’re going to murder them because they eat where they live,” Geri Matteson of Quincy said. “Wow.” John O’Leary, assistant director of DCR’s Division of Fisheries and Wildlife, said there are non-lethal methods of culling the deer population, like contraception, sterilization or relocation, but he said a controlled hunt is the most effective method, one used successfully at the Quabbin Reservoir in Central Massachusetts. Also, he said non-lethal methods are more expensive. Some residents questioned the purpose of the meetings, saying it appeared as though DCR would go forward with the plan regardless of opposition. Peter Church, DCR’s director of forest stewardship, said the public feedback is important. “Based on the public comments we get, we’ll be assessing whether the hunting goes forward or it doesn’t,” Church said. Two neighbors spoke in favor of the hunt because deer routinely eat plants in their yards. “There are too many deer in the Blue Hills,” Jim O’Leary of Quincy said. Officials said hunters would be selected by lottery. Only slug ammo would be allowed. DCR’s plan for the Blue Hills includes expanding the controlled hunt in the coming years to allow for hunting on more days, in more areas and with use of archery.
