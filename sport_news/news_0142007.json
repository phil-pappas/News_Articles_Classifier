Andre McGee resigns from UMKC \nIn her book, “Breaking Cardinal Rules: Basketball and the Escort Queen,” Powell alleges she was paid thousands of dollars and given game tickets by former U of L director of basketball operations Andre McGee. McGee’s attorney, Scott C. Cox, said McGee knew Powell but never paid for escorts to have sex with players or recruits. \nInvestigations of the allegations are ongoing by the NCAA and state prosecutors. \nPowell wrote that her own daughters were among the escorts. She has since said they were not minors at the time and that she didn’t personally profit. \nAccording to an ESPN report released this week, five former U of L players or recruits backed up Powell’s account of parties with strippers, while one former recruit confirmed he had sex with one of the women. \nMcGee resigned Friday morning as assistant basketball coach at the University of Missouri-Kansas City. \nMcGee had been placed on administrative leave at UMKC after the publication Powell’s book. \nMcGee, who has not publicly responded to Powell’s claims, said in an email to the athletic director of the Kansas City school that he had “reluctantly” decided to resign because the team deserves a full-time assistant and he was not able to provide that “while the false allegations against me are investigated.” \nCox declined comment Friday but previously said McGee \"has never supplied a prostitute or escort to a player or recruit at the University of Louisville.\" #UofLscandal Katina Powell's daughters say anyone in dorm Minardi Hall would have know of wild strip and sex parties with bball recruits. — Beth Warren (@BethWarrenCJ) October 23, 2015 #UofLscandal Katina Powell says ex- U of L bball staffer Andre McGee told her coach Rick Pitino would have know of sex parties with recruits — Beth Warren (@BethWarrenCJ) October 23, 2015 #UofLscandal Katina Powell says she kept journals of U of L on-campus sex parties\"for my own protection.\" — Beth Warren (@BethWarrenCJ) October 23, 2015 #UofLscandal Rod Ni Powell, Katina Powell's daughter, admitted to sex with players. \"Everybody was grown.
