That’s the agreement.”\nThe personal nature of the gift reflects the nature of the relationship between Dolan, a recovering alcoholic, and Sather that obviously extends well past the boundaries of the rink and the boardroom.\nAnd though Gorton is charged with the day-to-day operation of the Rangers and is ultimately responsible for personnel decisions, Dolan does not believe there has been a significant change within the hierarchy.\n“My deal with Glen is that Glen runs the team,” Dolan said. “It was his decision to give Jeff autonomy to make the appropriate decisions , and I am fine with that.”\nGorton is in his ninth year in the organization, the last four of which he spent as assistant GM. The Bruins, for whom he had worked for 15 years before he came to New York, requested permission to interview Gorton for their vacant GM position in May.\nSo did the Maple Leafs. The Rangers just said no .\n“I have a high opinion of Jeff, we meet from time to time and I’m sure we’ll start meeting on a more regular basis,” Dolan said. “There is no doubt that he is general manager’s material and a lot of teams would have been thrilled to have him.\n“We clearly did not want to lose Jeff. He is, and has been, a big part of this organization’s success.”\nSather, who turned 72 last month, had stepped back from some of the daily demands of the job over the last couple of years. But, as Dolan made clear, that does not mean he has abdicated his position of responsibility.\n“For me, I need Glen to stay attached to the team and guide the team and have oversight,” Dolan said. “In my mind he’s doing that.”\nSather came from Edmonton to take over the Rangers in June 2000. The Blueshirts missed the playoffs the first four years of his reign, extending what was an unthinkable drought for the NHL’s most profligate team to seven straight seasons.\nRangers general manager Jeff Gorton Photo: Ron Antonelli But it began to turn, almost counterintuitively, when the league adopted a hard cap following the canceled 2004-05 season. As Dolan sees it, though, it began to turn at the 2004 trade deadline, when Sather purged the club of veterans — including Brian Leetch, Alex Kovalev and Petr Nedved — in exchange for a bushel of draft picks.\n“That’s what it all goes back to,” Dolan said. “That was the beginning of this program where we’ve placed emphasis on drafting and developing. You can see it now, where every couple of years we have a new set of kids coming into the lineup.\n“That’s Glen Sather.”\nIt has been 21 years since the last parade up the Canyon of Heroes, and now four seasons since Dolan took the mike to declare that victory was close at hand.\n“My feeling is, the team has gotten better [from last year],” Dolan said. “I think we’re pretty close.”\nSather, a five-Cup winner in Edmonton, will be honored with a banner-raising when the Rangers visit Northlands on Dec. 11. The Garden executive chairman is not expected to make the trip.\n“I’ll wait for the one we have here,” Dolan said.\n glen sather , james dolan , jeff gorton , new york rangers", "external_links": ["https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/gorton1.jpg?w=300&#038;h=200", "https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/gorton1.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-14T04:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T03:15:49.691+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
