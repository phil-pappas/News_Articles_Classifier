If the whole thing had happened in June, we would have had enough time to think about collaborating,\" team boss Maurizio Arrivabene said. \"This is not how the F1 works.\" \nMercedes, already contracted to supply three customer teams next season, have reiterated that they will not supply their rivals with engines while Honda will continue to exclusively power McLaren in 2016. \n\"Their only option is to walk away or rebuild bridges with Renault,\" said Sky Sports F1 pundit Martin Brundle. \"Red Bull don't have an engine - I think it's absolutely clear that Ferrari won't and can't supply them with 2016 engines.\" \nEcclestone has insisted that he still expects 22 cars to be present on the grid next year while Horner told reporters that \"negotiations\" were ongoing. \nOne possibility is that if Dietrich Mateschitz, the owner of both Red Bull and Toro Rosso, withdraws from F1, Horner would pursue a management buy-out of the Milton Keynes outfit.
