Portland would eventually lose 109-105 in overtime. But it was through Platt's 65-year old eyes that I most wanted to see this season officially begin.\nHow many games will Portland win with this roster? Will the Blazers be a fun date? Where exactly is this season headed?\nPrior to tip, Platt said: \"That's what I'm here to find out.\"\nPlatt Electric first opened its doors in 1953. Maybe you've used the family-run business for electrical work. Maybe you've never even thought about Platt Electric, which provided the materials that currently make up the electrical guts and lighting inside the Moda Center.\nPlatt's been coming to Blazers games since 1970, and has been a season-ticket holder since 1972. The Blazers are ready to celebrate the 20th birthday of the home arena. Before the game, a team executive tracked me down and pointed out $16 million in improvements made in the last couple of years, noting, \"Hasn't this building held up nicely?\"\nSure thing.\nBut it's die-hard Blazers fans such as Platt who have really held up, isn't it?\nThey've cheered and groaned. They've seen players drafted, traded, and retired. They've memorized, and re-memorized the roster, connecting the jersey numbers with names. And they keep coming back, in a seemingly endless relationship with a franchise they desperately hope will find its way.\n\"We have to have more happening here than human bowling,\" Platt said of a timeout promotion that featured a fan wearing a helmet while sitting on a wheeled platform being slung into six giant foam bowling pins.\nFor two decades, Platt has owned a pair of black padded seats in Section 101, Row CC. He sits, center court, directly behind the scorer's table with a metal rail with cup holders attached on it in front of him. Maybe you've spotted Platt in the arena during a game or even on television as a player checks in -- his parted silver hair, eyeglasses, often with arms folded, and always in blue jeans leaning back (not forward) in his seat so those on either side of him can see.\n\"Occasionally you get a leaner sitting beside you,\" he said. \"Leaning back is the professional thing to do.\"\nPlatt's watched the Blazers win a championship in his time, and also, he saw that painful meltdown in the 2000 Western Conference Finals. His wife, Sandy, hasn't attended a Blazers game since Game 6 of that series with the Lakers. She hasn't had the stomach for it so he typically comes alone or brings a friend. In his time as a ticket holder, there have been 14 different Blazers head coaches, a pile of thrills, a couple of NBA arenas, and a series of absurd soap-opera like moments that Platt recounts with vivid detail.\n\"One time,\" he said, \"Bonzi Wells threw his chewing gum after he turned the ball over and it whizzed right past my ear and hit the woman who sat behind me.\"\nPlatt dashed off an email that night to then-Blazers executive Erin Hubert, who later told Platt she typed up a letter of apology that read, \"I'm sorry I threw gum at you. I was upset and shouldn't have done it.\"\nHubert asked Wells to sign the letter. Except, then-general manager and team president Bob Whitsitt apparently didn't like that the letter included an admission that Wells had thrown the gum at the fan. The wording left the organization potentially liable, and so the apology was re-written to read, \"I'm sorry the gum was thrown in your direction.\"\nWells himself delivered it before the next game, along with an autographed practice jersey. Even now, Platt laughs at the absurd scene of Wells delivering a (sort-of) apology letter he hadn't written to a fan he'd pelted with gum.\nOn Monday, Platt wondered of the Blazers, \"Where are they going to get the offense from this season?\"\nLater, he offered, \"I'll bet Terry Stotts secretly likes this better than when he had a loaded starting line up. No pressure. He can only be the hero.\"\nAnd during a timeout he looked at the seats on the Blazers baseline normally occupied by owner Paul Allen and said, \"I'll bet Paul is at the football game.\"\nPlatt is an observer. He thinks the Blazers win total this season, \"will start with the number three.\" 30? or 39? Somewhere between, maybe? He'll hope for the best, but this organization has molded him into a realist who searches for small victories. For example, on Monday in a few short possessions, Platt decided that he loves the hustle that newcomer Noah Vonleh plays with.\n\"Vonleh is the best No. 21 since Sidney Wicks,\" he said.\nYes, this is a man who has seen it all. Much of it is stored in his memory. The rest is filed away in the photo album of his iPhone 5, which he hands over and lets you flip through.\nThere's a photo Platt took of an elated Damian Lillard grabbing the public-address microphone after that Game 6 playoff dagger that beat the Rockets in 2014. There's a picture Platt snapped of his ticket stub from the 1977 Finals (face value: $7). There's a series of photos of Platt posing alone in various Major League Baseball stadiums, from Los Angeles to Kansas City.\n\"I'd better back up these pictures,\" he said.\nHarvey and his family sold Platt Electric in the summer of 2012. It remains open under the family name. He and his wife now split time between Portland and Palm Desert, Calif. When he can't make the Blazers games, he gives the tickets to friends or sells them online.\nHe said: \"My tickets to the Cleveland game last season paid for about a fourth of the season.\"\nPortland's payroll remains $13 million under the NBA's salary floor, the absolute minimum that teams are permitted to spend. The players on the roster will split that figure evenly should the organization not spend it. This is the sort of detail a retired business owner zeroes in on when he's examining the product.\n\"I'll bet the players hope they don't spend it,\" Platt said, pointing to CJ McCollum and Meyers Leonard. \"That's a million dollars each -- before taxes.\"\nThe Blazers have six returning players on the roster surrounded by a line of miscasts, role players and projects. Who knows, right? In Platt's eyes, this could be fun to watch, because, \"There's something to be said for a bunch of hungry players.\"\nIt's a roster fighting for legitimacy on a night in which ankles were turned and balls were turned over. Happy 20th birthday Moda Center? Sure thing. But as long as we're celebrating, here's to the Blazers fans like Harvey. They've been here, too, you know.\n--- @JohnCanzanoBFT", "external_links": ["http://www.twitter.com/JohnCanzanoBFT"], "published": "2015-10-06T06:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T10:19:11.908+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
