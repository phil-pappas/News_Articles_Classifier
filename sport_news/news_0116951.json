After the loss to Tuscola last week and playing Tolono Unity and Maroa-Forsyth earlier in the year, St. Teresa's (5-3) road to five wins has been a hilly one. \n\"It's always great to bounce back after such a demoralizing loss last week, you know?\" Brilley said. \"This was definitely a team win.\" \nShelbyville (5-3) tried mixing it up between shots downfield and giving running back Garrett Brachbill touches, but neither gained much traction. The Bulldogs forced six three-and-outs in the first half and then held steady on four fourth downs in the second half. \nComing in, Brachbill had nearly 1,200 yards and was averaging more than seven yards per carry. The Bulldogs never let him let him get too loose as the Rams back carried the ball 28 times for 117 yards. \n\"They have good size up front,\" Shelbyville coach Mark Ramsey said. \"Their linebackers were filling. We came out throwing a little bit, we probably should have ran the ball a little bit more, looking back. \n\"I thought we had some good matchups on the outside, and we took some shots.\" \nThat tested a Bulldogs' secondary which has been a work in progress thanks to injuries and finding the best players for each position. The Zachs -- Jarrett and Hooker -- were able to keep the deep sideline passes from connecting, and Hooker came up with his first interception of the year. \nAnd it tested a linebacking crew that's back to four backers. That's been the area that had the most inexperience coming into the season, but Brilley was happy with what he saw from them on Friday as Nick Kemper and Shane Brumleve led with 11 tackles for the Bulldogs. \n\"Nick Kemper's done a great job all year,\" he said. \"And then we got Mac Handley back from injury. He just has great instincts and he's just a smart football player. And Shane Brumleve's the inbetween guy -- he's a great football player, he's very physical, but he's got some great instincts too. Then this week we add Seth Greenwell in there.\" \nOn offense, it was Jacardia Wright who came on strong in the second half. He came away with 212 yards, and it's his big-play ability that allows him to rack up so much. He had rushes of 53, 42 and 38 amid 23 total carries. \nThe Bulldogs had four turnovers, two Ryan Fyke interceptions and two fumbles. But they never really came back to bite St. T too much. \nIn a season where expectations were sky-high, getting win No. 5 is a relieving checkmark. They already have 40 playoff points heading into the final week -- a sign of how tough their road's been. \n\"We qualified for the playoffs, we have a lot of playoff points,\" Brilley said. \"We got a tough game coming up against an athletic Warrensburg team. But we're going to enjoy this one after last week for sure.\" Aren's take Testing the leg \nSt. Teresa was without linebacker/kicker Joey Martini because of two strained hip flexors. Brilley said it would likely just be a week where he was out. \nBut it gave some other Bulldogs a chance to shine at kickoff duties, and lineman Zach Fitzgerald heard his name called first. \nThe 6-foot-2, 257-pound lineman provided some pop as Shelbyville started its returns near the 10-yard line. \n\"The kicking game? It was pretty good until the third quarter and my leg started feeling sore,\" Fitzgerald said. \"It's all good.\" Back to basics \nBrilley said all of the motion Tuscola ran last week mixed up his defense last week, so he went to a simpler system. \n\"We switched back down to the four-linebacker set, both by necessity and by injury,\" Brilley said. \"But really they just took advantange of some motion and got us confused a couple times I think. \nJust thinking too much and you can't think and play defense at the same time.\" More Brachbill \nMark Ramsey was clear about one thing after the game -- the Rams need to incorporate Brachbill into the offense more. He did have 31 touches, including three catches for 52 yards. \n\"We need to clear up some things,\" Ramsey said. \"I think Brachbill's a heck of a running back. We got a find a few more ways to get him the ball. So, that's going to be the focus this week.\" \nadow@herald-review.com|(217) 421-6978", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T12:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T04:29:23.169+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
