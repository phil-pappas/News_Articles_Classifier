Miller getting tangled up in front as Ryan McDonagh’s shot beats Bruins goaltender Jonas Gustavsson in the second period. NEW YORK – Dylan McIlrath may have finally earned a spot on the Rangers’ roster.\nMaybe. Because the Rangers still have some decisions to make after concluding their six-game preseason schedule with a 3-2 win over the Bruins on Wednesday night at Madison Square Garden.\nThe Rangers must make their final cuts to a maximum of 23 players by Monday. It is likely the Rangers will carry 22 players – 13 forwards and seven defensemen – to start the season next Wednesday at Chicago.\n\"At this time I can honestly share with you we haven’t made up our mind,\" said coach Alain Vigneault, who watched the game from above while Scott Arniel ran the bench.\nThe burly McIlrath, 23, the 10th overall pick in the 2010 draft, outplayed veteran Raphael Diaz, his competition for the seventh defensemen’s role. But Vigneault likely did not spy a winner for the final spot among the top six forwards in the sloppy match.\nSecond-year pro Kevin Hayes, who centered the third line last season, was given his shot on Derek Stepan’s right wing along with Chris Kreider. But that line created few opportunities until the third period, which was Vigneault’s explanation of why J.T. Miller had not secured the role already.\n\"It’s a combination of nobody has really grabbed that spot with Step and Kreids – because I like that duo – and I feel with Haysey there’s so much potential there,\" Vigneault said. \"[Plus] we do have quite a few guys who can play the middle position now.\n\"I like J.T.’s effort but there weren’t a lot of quality scoring chances five-on-five,\" said Vigneault, though Miller gave the Rangers a 2-1 lead with an even-strength goal with 37.4 seconds left in the second period. \nMcIlrath was paired with Diaz and was stronger with the puck, more accurate with his passes and, of course, more physical, though Diaz had a power-play assist. McIlrath was called for an iffy charging penalty on his hard check of Zac Rinaldo at 2:35 of the second period and won his lengthy fight with Tyler Randell at 14:00 of the second period. His long outlet pass from the Rangers’ end to Derick Brassard at the Bruins’ blue line nearly set up Mats Zuccarello for a scoring chance.\nBut which depth defensemen the Rangers retain also depends on the 13 forwards who make the final cut. If gritty fourth-liner Tanner Glass is kept, there may not be a need for McIlrath’s enforcer presence.\n\"What happens with our decision on the fence might have something to do with what we decide up front,\" Vigneault said.\nBRIEFS: Forward Oscar Lindberg, who had an assist, was the unanimous winner of the Lars-Erik Sjoberg Award as the top rookie in Rangers’ training camp as voted upon by the media. … Henrik Lundqvist stopped 39 shots in his second full game of the preseason. …Captain Ryan McDonagh had two assists while Viktor Stalberg and Rick Nash, on the power play at 5:21 of the third period, had the Rangers’ other goals against Jonas Gustavsson (24 saves).", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T04:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T08:43:35.384+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
