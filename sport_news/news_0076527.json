If anything, the Bruins needed to get back to the sturdy foundation of coach Claude Julien’s system — with its emphasis on hard work and sound three-zone checking.\nBut Julien got his instructions from above and he, like any employee issued an order from his boss, could either say, “Yes, Sir,” or go work somewhere else.\nSo what did we see? B’s forwards, instead of remaining in their defensive zone to help the defensemen break the puck out, flying far up the ice — and the blueliners launching 100-foot passes that had little chance of connecting.\nJulien will never admit it, but he must have been steaming as he watched truly bad hockey being played. It was a mess. And, of course, he’s listed by Las Vegas oddsmaker Bovada as the NHL coach most likely to be the first fired — as he tries to implement a new system under instructions from above.\nNow, obviously the B’s have numerous new players and young and inexperienced kids, so growing pains were inevitable. But this had the added feel of a self-inflicted problem. Maybe it’s been fixed. We will see.\n“The thing is we can clean up a little bit on our breakouts — not just our (defensemen), but also the forwards have to come back,” center David Krejci said before Wednesday’s 6-2 win in Denver. “The (defensemen) have to go back quick, the forwards have to go back quick and give them an outlet. We have to work on cleaner breakouts — all the way from the ‘D’ to the forwards. You’ve got to get on the same page. We have a game plan. We just have to respect it. The game plan is a little bit different this year, a couple of tweaks here and there. But it should still be easy adjustments. We’re professionals. We all play the game, we all know what to do. We just have to trust the system.\n“What we obviously want to do is play the same defense that we always have, and — because we kind of struggled on offense last year — work on the doing better with the offense. But we just kind of totally forgot about our defensive game.”\nJulien’s critics seem to feel he is too conservative, but the view here is that his coaching and his system are maybe the biggest reason the B’s averaged almost 103 points in the seven full seasons from 2007-18 to ’14-’15.\nJust think about the Bruins’ best games over the years — games in which they dominated opponents. How did they do it? By playing their system to perfection: With nonstop, intense forechecking, and disciplined back pressure — always taking away time and space, so opponents could rarely could break out of their zone or come through neutral ice with speed. When the B’s executed that game plan, teams just went nowhere. They had no chance.\nGranted, we saw fewer and fewer of those games last year, and lots of sloppy, soft play. But that style of play remains the ideal — the kind of game when the B’s are at their best. The B’s don’t have 50-goals scorers. They can’t send three lines of elite level skill. Centers Patrice Beregeron and Krejci are the B’s two best forwards — neither blindingly fast, but both players who sacrifice offensive production to be outstanding two-way players.\nThat’s what makes the Bruins the Bruins. They’ve always had work ethic and a system — maybe more than any other team in the NHL. The brass kind of seemed to forget that. A more up-tempo attack is great, and can improve this team. But not if it forgets the other half of the game.\nThis week’s B’s timeline\nWednesday vs. Philadelphia, 8:05 p.m. — The Bruins return from the road with a couple of days to rest and prep for the Flyers. The B’s swept all three games last season. The Flyers missed the playoffs last season and have a new coach in Dave Hakstol — but much the same, rather nondescript roster, led by stars Claude Giroux and Jakub Voracek.\nFriday at New York Islanders, 7:35 p.m. — The Bruins get their first look at the Barclay’s Center in Brooklyn, the new home of the Islanders, a longshot pick by some experts to win the Eastern Conference. It has to sting for Bruins fans seeing defenseman Johnny Boychuk playing so well for the Isles.\nSEKERA NOT LIVING UP TO HIS $33 MILLION DEAL WITH OILERS\nOne of old friend Peter Chiarelli’s main summer acquisitions as the new general manager in Edmonton was defenseman Andrej Sekera, who was handed a six-year deal worth $33 million — a bonanza widely seen as far too generous. After three games, Sekera had 0-1-1 totals and was a minus-3.\n“He comes to a new team, (and) he’s trying to figure everything out,” Oilers coach Todd McLellan told the Edmonton Journal. “There’s some things we’ll work with him in practice, some video stuff — just moving the puck a little quicker, not playing one-on-one with it. It’ll take him some time to settle in. He’s a very good player and we expect more from him.”\nThe Oilers lost their first three games. There have been hopes they could be in the running for a playoff spot this year; now it looks like yet another very high draft position. They have picked No. 1 overall in four of the last six drafts — a talent haul which, one assumes, might eventually mean a winning team.\nPHILLY FANS LATEST TO GIVE BLACKHAWK KANE AN EARFUL\nPhiladelphia fans are not known for being, shall we say, polite and well-mannered. They proved it anew Wednesday night as the Chicago Blackhawks faced the Flyers at Wells Fargo Center.\nWhen Hawks star winger Patrick Kane — accused of sexual assault on a woman last summer in the Buffalo area, but has not been charged with any crime — was on the ice, Flyers fans repeatedly chanted, “She said no! She said no!”\nNew York Islanders fans did likewise last week, greeting Kane with chants of, “No means no! No means no!”\nThe rather bizarre on-going legal situation doesn’t appear to be bothering Kane a great deal, at least not on the ice: After four games, he had 3-3-6 totals.\nThe Blackhawks will not visit the Garden until March 3. Depending on how, or if, the mess is resolved by then, it will be interesting to how Kane is treated here.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T15:23:31.145+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
