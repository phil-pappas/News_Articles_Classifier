Faksa put the Stars ahead 4-3 with less than eighth minutes left. \nThe Rampage pulled their goalie to add an extra attacker in the closing minutes and Street scored with one minute, eight seconds left in regulation.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T06:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T08:53:43.932+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
