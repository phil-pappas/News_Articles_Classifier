It’s going to be a major challenge for us, but one that I know we’re up for and one we’re excited about.”\nUSU head coach Matt Wells\nLOGAN — It was on a cold Idaho night in late November 2014 when the Aggies had a chance to put themselves in position to win a Mountain West football championship.\nBut just as things seemed to be going Utah State's way last season, division foe Boise State knocked the Aggies back down to size with a 50-19 beatdown that set the Broncos up for another conference title.\nWhile the rematch between Utah State (2-0 in the Mountain West, 3-2 overall) and No. 21 Boise State (2-0, 5-1) will come on an unseasonably warm evening in mid-October, tonight's game at Maverik Stadium certainly has the feel of the kind of contest that is going to determine this year's Mountain Division champion.\n\"I have a lot of respect for this program,\" USU head coach Matt Wells said of BSU. \"It’s going to be a major challenge for us, but one that I know we’re up for and one we’re excited about. We haven’t beaten them yet since we have been in this league, but the fact that the winner is in the driver’s seat for the Mountain Division makes it a big game.\"\nWhile the Aggies come into Friday's showdown feeling pretty good about themselves after beating Colorado State (33-18) at home and roughing up Fresno State (56-14) on the road, the Broncos are on a far more impressive roll.\nBoise State opened the season by beating Washington and former head coach Chris Petersen, 16-13, but then blew a late lead at BYU on its way to a 35-24 loss. But over its last four games, BSU has blown away Idaho State, Virginia, Hawaii and Colorado State by an average margin of 51-6.\nAnd the Broncos have put together that run despite having a true freshman at quarterback for most of that stretch. Brett Rypien has taken over the position originally held by sophomore Ryan Finley, who is out for two months after breaking his ankle in the ISU game, and then, briefly, by sophomore Tommy Stuart.\n\"It’s another talented version of the Bronco football program,\" Wells declared. \"This year is no different. When you see a true freshman quarterback and see some of the things (Brett) Rypien does, he’s really good. He’s the second true freshman quarterback we’ve seen (after Washington’s Jake Browning), and he can make all the throws.\n\"He’s got a good head, he’s very accurate and he’s got a great supporting cast around him with a veteran offensive line that has played a lot of football together, a deep running back group and talented wideouts out on the perimeter.”\nThe nephew of former NFL quarterback and Super Bowl XXVI MVP Mark Rypien, Brett Rypien has completed 73 of 104 passes for 1,057 yards and seven touchdowns while throwing just one interception.\nJeremy McNichols, who is questionable for tonight's game following a helmet-to-helmet hit suffered in the game at Colorado State, has taken over Jay Ajayi's role from last year. The sophomore tailback has rushed for 12 touchdowns while catching passes for two more, leaving him as the national leader in total TDs with 14.\nThe Broncos also boast a lot of weapons at wide receiver with Thomas Sperlock (27 receptions for 526 yards and five touchdowns) leading the way.\nOverall, the Broncos led the Mountain West and are 19th in the country in total offense at 482.3 yards per game, and BSU is also 10th in the nation in scoring offense at 40.7 ppg. On the other side of the ball, the Broncos are fifth in total defense (259.5 ypg) and seventh in scoring defense (12.0 ppg).\nThat leaves Bryan Harsin's team as the only program in the FBS to rank in the top 10 in both scoring offense and scoring defense, and the top 20 in total offense and defense.\n\"It’s just another normal week for us, there is nothing new,\" USU center Austin Stephen said. \"Boise State is going to be good; they always are. The road to the Mountain West championship goes through Boise, and we know that. So, we’re going to be ready to roll. It’s a good challenge for us.”\nThe Aggies, who last beat BSU in 1997 when both programs were members of the Big West, have lost 12 straight games to the Broncos, and Boise State is 7-2 all-time in Logan.", "external_links": ["http://deseretnews.sportsdirectinc.com/football/ncaaf-teams.aspx?page=/data/ncaaf/teams/team100.html"], "published": "2015-10-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T23:18:33.363+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
