I need, the club needs and the fans need all our best players. \n\"We are waiting for the bigger clubs but this is only speculation and we won't sell him,\" he added. \nA goal against Crystal Palace on Saturday would see Vardy become the eighth player to score in seven successive Premier League matches. \nRanieri said Vardy had to keep delivering the performances, even when the goals dry up. \n\"He is playing really well and I hope he can continue but football is strange,\" said Ranieri. \n\"It's not important to think about goals or no goals. It's important to think about how he plays for the team. If he can continue in this way it would be fantastic.\" \n(Reporting by Shravanth Vijayakumar in Bengaluru; Editing by Peter Rutherford ) \nOur top photos from the last 24 hours.
