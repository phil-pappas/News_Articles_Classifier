They improved to 4-1 and scored more than 40 points for the third week in a row. Friday night, they won their homecoming contest over Bethel 49-7. The Chieftains scored three touchdowns in the first and second quarters to put the game away early. Bethel got the ball first and Caleb Smith went 40 yards to put the ball deep in Seminole territory early. A fumble on an option play cost the Wildcats 12 yards and a 40-yard field goal missed to give the Chieftains the ball. Logan Long hit Cash Davis for a 51-yard strike and Dake Reese did the rest as he scored on a three-yard plunge to stake Seminole to a 7-0 lead early in the game. After Bethel went three and out, Long struck again finding Max Guest on a crossing route. Guest took the ball the distance including a spin move that left a Wildcat defender on his heels during a 58-yard touchdown to make it 14-0. Reese scored his second touchdown on a 59-yard scamper just before the first quarter ended. A.J. Johnson recovered a fumble deep on the Bethel end to set up Reese’s third TD to extend the score to 27-0 early in the second quarter. After the Wildcats turned the ball over on downs on its next possession, Long found Guest again on a long pass for a 46-yard touchdown. The final score of the first half came right before intermission when Reese took a handoff 55-yards for a score. He broke several tackles on his way to his fourth score of the game. After the intermission, Smith finally go Bethel on the board with a 68-yard TD run to put him over 100 yards for the game. Seminole scored one more late in the game for a 49-7 win. Seminole takes its four-game winning streak on the road to Kingfisher – who fell to 2-3 with a loss to Cushing - next week. Bethel returns home to host 2-3 Pauls Valley. The Panthers beat Star Spencer 31-13 Friday night. By Kent Bush", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T06:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T08:13:28.806+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
