South Africa meet Honduras at Olympico Metropolitan Stadium at 18:00 on Tuesday, 13 October (early hours Wednesday SA time) fired up to chalk another victory which will see them complete a successful tour of Costa Rica and Honduras having beaten the former 1-0 last Thursday. Mashaba says: ‘I have always maintained that winning is a good culture to develop. Yes, no one can continue winning because even the best in the business get beaten or even walloped as well but I am excited by this group of players. They work together, have an incredible camaraderie and want to achieve things. This Central American tour has really cemented the unity among players and most of them will form a solid foundation for a team that will play Angola in the World Cup qualifiers next month.’The Bafana Bafana boss says he was keeping his fingers crossed that the bulk of this squad remain fit until the crucial qualifiers against Angola in November: ‘Everything seems to be coming together. The combination at the back and midfield is any coach’s dream and we just need to beef up the strike force going forward.’ Mashaba’s sentiments were echoed by rising midfielder Bongani Zungu who received special mention from the Costa Ricans for his cool head, massive influence and mobility in the middle of the park. On the secret of his steady rise to stardom, Zungu says he had been working very hard to improve his game, day in day out: ‘I am also privileged to work with two of South Africa’s greatest coaches but I have discovered that when you take instructions from the coaches and remain humble, one thing can lead to the other. It is not something I wouldn’t like to delve on at this moment in time as we prepare for the Honduras game but yes, a few clubs including one big one from Portugal have made some serious enquiries. Definitely, my ultimate goal is to play overseas; that is where you can take your profession to the next level; mixing it up with the best in the business.’ Photo credit: Chris Ricco/BackpagePix", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T17:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T17:27:23.243+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
