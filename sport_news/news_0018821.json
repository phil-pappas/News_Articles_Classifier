The Gillies clan produces hockey goaltenders. Jon’s grandfather, father, uncle and cousin have all played between the pipes, and he’s the latest to put on the mask with the family name across the back of his jersey. Jon Gillies successfully began his professional career with a shutout in the season opener for the Stockton Heat. Coach Ryan Huska has not announced whether Gillies will play when the Heat plays host to the San Jose Barracuda at 7 p.m. today at Stockton Arena. But the rookie is considered a top prospect with a résumé that includes an NCAA title last season with Providence College. For Gillies, a 21-year-old from South Portland, Maine, stopping pucks comes naturally. “We’re all goalies. The whole family,” Gillies said. “And it’s cool because I can bounce things off all of them. And my grandfather played without a mask, so it’s cool hearing all those stories.” Gillies said he played a little at forward as a child, but it was pretty clear he would wind up in the net. At 6-foot-5, he’s an imposing figure and Brian Burke, the Calgary Flames’ president of hockey operations, joked at a meet-and-greet in Stockton this past summer that Gillies has a second job as “a wall.” The Flames drafted Gillies in the third round (75th overall) of the 2012 NHL Draft. He spent three seasons with Providence, culminating with the NCAA crown in 2014-15. He defeated Boston College 4-3 in the championship game and was the most valuable player of the Frozen Four. He decided to forgo his senior year with the Friars, and signed a two-year deal with the Flames in April. Gillies stopped 19 shots in a 7-0 win against the Rockford IceHogs on Oct. 10, and his defense did a fine job limiting Rockford’s opportunities. He’ll face tougher challenges throughout the season, which is exactly what the Flames and Heat want. “He wasn’t tested often, but I like how he showed his mental toughness by staying alert and handling what came his way,” Heat goaltending coach Scott Gouthro said. “There’s big expectations for him, he’s a special player. This is about him working harder to make himself better and one day making it to the NHL.” And while he’s in Stockton, Gillies wants to win. “I think we have an outstanding group here,” Gillies said. “I’m looking forward to what we can do.” The Heat announced its first player called up to the big club. Center Markus Granlund has been promoted to the Flames, who put left wing Lance Bouma on injured reserve with a broken left fibula. Granlund had a goal and an assist for Stockton in the season opener. The Heat also sent forward Ryan Lomberg to the Adirondack Thunder on the ECHL. Lomberg did not dress in the win against Rockford. — Contact reporter Scott Linesburgh at (209) 546-8281 or slinesburgh@recordnet.com.
