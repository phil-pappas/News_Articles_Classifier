Related KIRO-TV-Seattle SEATTLE — \nSeattle start-up ‘Vicis’ says its soon-to-be-launched football helmet will keep the brain far safer than anything available today. \nTheir motivation: the current focus on football and head injuries. \nChief Executive Officer and co-founder Dave Marver says the Vicis helmet is designed to protect against both skull fracture and traumatic brain injury. Today's helmets are only designed to deal with the former but not the latter. \nThe more a helmet absorbs of the impact, the safer it is. \n“This is like we're dealing with an egg. Today's helmets protect the egg shell, keep it from cracking. But we also want to protect the egg yoke from sloshing around, like the brain,” said Marver. \n>> Read more trending stories \nThere is so much proprietary technology in the helmet, Vicis uses a dazzle camouflage to wrap and hide all the unique features so competitors don't catch on. \nMarver joined a renowned doctor on sports concussions at Seattle Children’s Hospital, who is also a University of Washington engineering professor, to launch Vicis. \nThe helmet \"is designed differently,\" he says. \"It's designed with multiple layers. It's designed to protect from both traumatic head injuries and skull fractures. And it functions differently. It has a novel outer shell material. The novel engineered absorbing layer. It feels different. It sounds different.\" \nThe plan is for the helmet to go on the market in spring 2016 and be on the heads of NFL players next season. \nThe Vicis team has consulted with the Seattle Seahawks on the helmets.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T04:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T10:35:16.134+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
