We have to thank Petr Cech too, he had a fantastic game.”\nDefending champion Barcelona remained in control of top spot in Group E as Ivan Rakitic scored both goals in a 2-0 win at BATE Borisov, while Roma came back from a 2-0 deficit in a 4-4 draw at Bayer Leverkusen in a topsy-turvy game.\nIn Group G, Chelsea coach Jose Mourinho complained about the referee after the Blues were held to a goalless draw at Dynamo Kyiv. Porto tops the standings after a 2-0 defeat of Maccabi Tel-Aviv.\n“The referee was weak and naive with the penalty,” said Mourinho after his side was not given a penalty when Cesc Fabregas went down in the area. “My first thoughts were that it looked like a spot-kick. I cannot understand what the referee behind the goal does, because he doesn’t make a clear decision too.”\nBarcelona 2 BATE Borisov 0\nNeymar continued to lead Barcelona in Lionel Messi’s absence with two assists for substitute Ivan Rakitic to score both goals and give Barcelona an easy 2-0 win at BATE Borisov in Belarus.\nComing off his four-goal performance over the weekend, Neymar created a steady stream of scoring chances for the defending European champions.\nRakitic, who went on for the injured Sergi Roberto in the first half, fired in a pinpoint strike from Neymar’s pass for Barcelona’s first goal in the 48th. Neymar found him a second time in the 64th.\nArsenal 2 Bayern Munich 0\nOlivier Giroud scored in the 77th minute at the Emirates Stadium, bundling the ball into the net after Bayern goalkeeper Manuel Neuer rushed off his line and failed to claim a free-kick from Santi Cazorla.\nThe ball appeared to come off Giroud’s arm last, after first hitting his head as he dived to make contact.\nMesut Ozil scored the second in added time, converting a cross from Hector Bellerin which Neuer pushed out after it had crossed the line.\nChelsea 0 Dynamo Kyiv 0\nChelsea’s Champions League campaign hit more trouble in a frustrating 0-0 draw against Dynamo Kyiv.\nChelsea dominated the game and was unlucky not to score after hitting the woodwork twice through Eden Hazard and Willian.\nOn a chilly night in Ukraine, another good chance was missed by Nemanja Matic, who charged through the Dynamo defence but shot wide.\nThe Ukrainian team came close when Vitaliy Buyalskiy and Derlis Gonzalez forced saves from Chelsea goalkeeper Asmir Begovic, who late on stopped a dangerous attempt by Junior Moraes.\nAt the halfway point of the group stage, Chelsea is third with four points, one behind Dynamo. Porto has the group lead with seven points.\nZenit 3 Lyon 1\nArtem Dzyuba scored in the third minute, Hulk fired home a spectacular shot from distance and Danny completed the win as Zenit closed in on qualification for the knockout stage.\nLyon made a dreadful start as Dzyuba found the net for the fifth successive game for Zenit with a clean finish at the far post from Oleg Shatov’s pass.\nAfter Alexandre Lacazette cancelled out the hosts’ lead early in the second half, Hulk stole the ball in midfield, surged toward the goal and unleashed a 30-metre shot into the top corner. The visitors were then caught on the break after Hulk and Shatov combined well to cut their defence open, with Danny tapping home with a simple finish in the 82nd minute.\nMLSE boss Leiweke reportedly joining David Beckham in Miami", "external_links": ["http://static.freeskreen.com/publisher/52/freeskreen.min.js"], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T02:40:18.930+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
