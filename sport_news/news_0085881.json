They were pretty solid,\" said Bellows Falls coach Bethany Coursen, who went with three defenders on Monday instead of her team's usual four. \"With just three players back there, they did an amazing job.\" \nThat's for sure. \nMurphy Hicks made some long drives out of danger, Paxton Santorelli made some clears by carrying the ball out, and defender Emily Stoddard had another outstanding game — Vermont's September Athlete of the Month nominee trapped an opponent in the corner, made a couple of steals, got the fans excited with a nice run along the sideline, and also dribbled all the way across the field before passing ahead to a cutting Reagan Baldasaro. \nThe Terriers outshot the Colonels 10-2 and had a 7-0 advantage in penalty corners. \n\"I think our corners are getting a little more consistent,\" stated Coursen, whose team used them to build a 2-0 halftime lead. Advertisement \nSophia Hyslop put away a pass from Dani Marchica, 10:41 into the contest, to get the hosts on the board. And then Macie Streeter tapped in Leia Robinson's feed for an insurance goal with 10:03 left before the break. \nIt could have been worse had Brattleboro's Hannah Wilson, Marly Lynch, Madison Fortier and Laura Freeman not gotten takeaways inside the circle. Kharisma Boyd chipped in by clearing the ball out via a long rally and sweeper Hannah Blake was often seen fronting Robinson on the weak side. \n\"They're a very good team and we're still in the learning process,\" noted Brattleboro co-coach Sherryl Libardoni, whose team has eight freshmen and 10 sophomores on its roster. \"I thought that each section (defense, links, forwards) played well, but our transition game wasn't working.\" \nBrattleboro netminders Olivia Weeks and Nataylia Forkin combined for seven saves. With the hosts seemingly threatening all day long, they kicked away difficult shots by Averie Lowe, Macie Streeter, Hannah Kelly (2), Dani Marchica, Molly Kelly and Leia Robinson. \nForkin, who defended the goal in the second half, didn't have much of a chance with 3:43 remaining. Baldasaro attacked down the right side and crossed the ball in front to Abbe Cravinho, who drove it into the back of the net to cap the scoring. \nBrattleboro's chances all came during a two-minute span in the second half. Emily Crespo passed ahead to Olivia Reil in close and Lynch later rolled the ball into the slot, but BF goalie Emma Lober stood her ground each time. \nThe 7-2-2 Terriers, who will play at Woodstock on Wednesday, are atop the Division 3 standings. The Colonels (2-9-2) need to tie or beat Fair Haven on Saturday in order to make it into the Division 1 playoffs. Brattleboro roster \nCoaches — Sherryl Libardoni and Kelly Markol.
