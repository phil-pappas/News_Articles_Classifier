NCAA president Mark Emmert informed Penn State by letter Friday that the governing body of college athletics will launch an investigation into the university's athletic programs in light of recent allegations of sexual abuse involving a former football assistant coach.\n\"I am writing to notify you that the NCAA will examine Penn State's exercise of institutional control over its intercollegiate athletics programs, as well as the actions, and inactions, of relevant responsible personnel,\" Emmert wrote in a letter to the university's president Rodney Erickson . \"We recognize that there are ongoing federal and state investigations and the NCAA does not intend to interfere with those probes.\"\nEmmert made clear his feelings on the allegations from the start, deeming the alleged misconduct of former defensive coordinator Jerry Sandusky as \"appalling.\" He was careful in sifting through the details of the case and identifying what bylaws the Nittany Lions may have violated.\n\"The recount of the these tragic events in the Grand Jury report was deeply troubling,\" Emmert wrote. \"If true, individuals who were in the position to monitor and act upon learning of potential abuses appear to have been acting starkly contrary to the values of higher education, as well as the NCAA. I am writing to notify you that the NCAA will examine Penn State's exercise of institutional control over its intercollegiate athletics program.\"\nThe unfolding scandal has already claimed the jobs of former coach Joe Paterno , the all-time leader in coaching wins at the Division I level, as well as university president Graham Spanier , who remains a tenured faculty member.\n\"It will be important for Penn State to cooperate fully and provide any assistance possible to the NCAA. The University's and NCAA's interests are perfectly aligned in identifying what went wrong and how to prevent anything similar from happening again,\" new Penn State president Rodney Erickson said in a statement released by the university.\nWide receivers coach Mike McQueary , who witnessed an alleged anal rape of a 10-yaer-old boy by Sandusky in a locker room shower during March 2002, was placed on administrative leave with pay after being the target of multiple threats to the school.\nDavid Joyner was formally introduced Friday as the school's acting athletic director. The Penn State graduate, who played offensive line from 1969-1971 under ousted Hall of Fame coach Joe Paterno , said he will make sure that the \"core values\" of the school's sports programs are aligned with the university's academic side.\n\"I'm just here to tell you that whatever has or has not gone in the past, we're going to go forward in the athletic department with my view ... that this is an academic unit,\" Joyner said. \"Now if we've lost some of that luster because of things that have happened, I can tell you that I've never lost that core value, and this athletic department will reflect that core value.\"\nHis predecessor, Tim Curley , has been charged with perjury in relation to the Sandusky case. Curley is also on administrative leave.\nPenn State administrators maintain that they have no plans to cancel the season's final two games and intend on accepting a bowl bid at season's end. The Nittany Lions travel to Columbus, Ohio to face rival Ohio State Saturday.\nEmmert, meanwhile, outlined four questions for Penn State administrators to respond to as they prepare for the probe, ranging from infrastructure regarding how the athletic department is monitored to ethical falures.\n\"I look forward to the complete cooperation of Penn State in our review and any other future action that we may take,\" Emmert wrote in conclusion.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T08:46:22.716+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
