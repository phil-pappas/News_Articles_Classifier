The players, typically exuberant and energetic, seemed quiet and distant as they prepared for a Friday showdown vs. Amador. It was unusual, especially for a team coming into homecoming week off of its second straight Mother Lode League victory — an accomplishment that has escaped Bret Harte since the 2006 season. Bret Harte head coach Casey Kester says that the lethargicness has come as a result of homecoming related events, or lack thereof. Due to a lack of student participation, many of the festivities that typically would’ve been featured this week had to be cancelled. The school also experienced a bout of vandalism of student made homecoming decorations. “It has been a different week of practice,” said Kester. “Usually, coaches hate homecoming week because of all of the crap that goes on. This just hasn’t been that way. They’ve just been detached. They know something serious is going on and it isn’t fun.” Kester says that homecoming week is always a distraction, but he prefers the distraction because it leads to a positive experience. This week, he has had to boost spirits due to the turn of events that essentially made the week significant just by name. Football wise, Kester and the Bullfrogs will look to start fast — something they have struggled with recently — this week vs. Amador. Though Bret Harte eventually came back to defeat Summerville and Linden respectively, the Bullfrogs fell behind by 13 in the first half of each game. “The guys are maturing very, very rapidly,” said Kester. “There was never any doubt on the sidelines that we were going to come back and win these games. That’s the attitude that has changed. They’re learning how to win.” Though the Bullfrogs have been able to overcome early holes, that is an area of concern that Kester is working to address for this week’s game. And he has been doing it by engaging the team mentally. “We’ve been doing everything we can. We’ve been changing up practice a little bit, changing up speeds, doing things to get them ready to go and do something different right now,” said Kester. “We’re changing gears on them real rapidly so they have to shift gears and focus, just like the start of the game.” Top performer in San Diego football camp Bret Harte junior offensive and defensive lineman Colin Preston won an award that placed him among the top four high school performers at the Nick Hardwick and Donald Butler football camp this past summer. The camp — held at the University of San DIego — featured more than 100 high school athletes. “My footwork is pretty bad so it helped me with a lot of that,” said Preston. “They had coaches from all over the place and they knew what they were talking about.” In going to the camp, which Preston says featured superior talent, he feels that he returned with the tools to be more successful than previous years. “I fought against some guy from Summerville, he’s their best player. Last year, it would’ve been equal,” said Preston. “This year, I think, with the help from those coaches, I beat him more times than he was able to beat me.” Kester says that, after going to camp in San DIego, Preston returned a more determined player which he thinks will help in his goal — earning a scholarship to a Division I college. “He was fairly well satisfied with beating these kids,” said Kester. “He now comes back from the camp and knows what it takes to be very successful at the level he wants to play at. You just can’t be good. He’s got to be very, very, very good … very great, at this level.” Follow UnionDemocrat.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T11:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T08:18:18.384+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
