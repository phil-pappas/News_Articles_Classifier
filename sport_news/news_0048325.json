We’re excited to be here. We’ve done everything we could do to get here.“We had a great mental meeting Wednesday. We said that this is more than a tournament; it’s an event in life. This is an experience you remember. We’re so excited.”Dublin Coffman, which is coming off its fourth straight district championship, could be the Celtics’ main competition.Olentangy Orange has made it to its first state tournament with two freshmen, two sophomores and one junior in the lineup. Lavonca Davis of Pickerington North, Ashley Flynn of Worthington Kilbourne and Kara Raines of Olentangy are competing as individuals.In the boys tournament on the par-71 Scarlet Course, Jerome is seeking a seventh championship. Grant Godfrey of Delaware and Caleb Davern of Central Crossing tied for medalist honors in the district tournament and are in the field as individuals.Jerome girls coach C.D. Butcher said a runner-up finish in the district tournament reawakened his players. Erana, Taby Robinson, Abby Kiefer, Reagan Dilono and Madelynn Zhang are the starters.“We’ve had a great year, and we’re as focused as ever,” Butcher said. “The district was a stumbling block. Maybe it was a good thing because we were getting cocky. I’ve never seen our players feel pressure. They know what to do, and that’s kind of freaky. Ultimately, you have to make putts to win this. We know that.”Senior Jorie Hodapp said Coffman is not the same team that started the season in August.“It was the third (Ohio Capital Conference) tournament when we came together,” she said. “Everyone shot between 70 and 78. We shot 300 as a team. That gave us a lot of motivation. We were high-fiving one another. We got hungrier.“Then a father said that we had won the district. We said, ‘Don’t kid us.’ Our hard work has paid off.”Until last season, when they failed to get out of the district tournament, the Jerome boys had a string of three state championships. They were determined to return to where they think they belong. The team consists of Jack Herceg, Grant Lewis, Cam Solomon, Adam Stephens and Cam Root. “It definitely was different not playing here last year, and we didn’t want that to happen again,” Herceg said. “We learned that every day counts and you have to bring it every day.“We knew we had a team that could compete at Scarlet. We had the motivation. We played great in the district. We hope we can do it again.”The Central District tournament at Apple Valley has been called a mini-state tournament. Until 2014, local teams won eight of the previous nine state championships.Davern, a freshman, is the first representative from Central Crossing to make the tournament. Raines is the first player from Olentangy in the girls tournament. mznidar@dispatch.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T02:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T04:15:51.165+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
