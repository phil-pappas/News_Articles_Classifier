Rob Smith, former vice president of the Philadelphia Union major league soccer team, will head the 85-acre complex south of Frederica. “Soccer’s pretty much been part of my DNA since I was 14,” Smith said. “I started playing in high school and fell in love with it to the point of giving up every other sport I was playing in at the time.” The Lincoln-based firm of Richard Y. Johnson & Sons on Oct. 15 was tentatively named as the prime contractor. A bigger task In his years with Philadelphia, Smith was responsible for on-field game day operations and for managing the club’s marketing rights with youth groups in eastern Pennsylvania and Delaware. He’ll be taking on a much bigger task, he said. “I’m going to be on a parallel track, overseeing construction and keeping an eye on that, and staying in touch with the contractors and architects,” Smith said. “I plan to spend time on the job site every week. “I’ll also be starting to get some of the events contracted, planned out and staffed so we can have events right away.” Officially called “The Turf,” the complex has been backed for years by the Greater Kent Committee as a way to bring additional business and tourism to Kent County. The project has run into several snags since its inception, including doubts that highway construction to bring players and spectators to the site could be built after the state Department of Transportation decided to delay the project. But with the road now back on track, it appears the sports complex is too. Johnson & Sons “came in below budget and the project is a ‘full go’ as result of their outstanding bid,” said GKC Executive Director Shelly Cecchett. “We had four firms vying for this bid and all four firms were under budget and are excellent contractors all capable of building this project.” The Johnson firm’s selection won’t be official, however, until an Oct. 23 meeting with GKC to finalize details, she said. Best of both worlds Despite his youthful obsession with soccer, the 55-year-old Smith never saw himself making a living at the game. While concentrating on his accounting career, he nonetheless got into coaching the sport. He served in executive positions with companies including NIKE and as chief financial officer for the United Sports training center in Chester County, Pa. He served 18 years as president of the FC Delco Soccer League before joining the Union in 2008. Smith’s attention was drawn to the long-gestating Kent County project a little more than two years ago, when he spotted some parallels between the regional complex and his own experience developing a similar site in Downingtown, Pa. His background in accounting, budgeting and planning will be the link that ties together construction and management, Smith said. “I fancy myself as a soccer person second and a business person first,” he said. “It’s the best of both worlds.” He’s already looking to the future. “This has to be sold outside our local market to attract interest,” Smith said. “I’ve already gotten several calls on regional events that we’ll have a chance to bid on.” Without going into detail, Smith added he plans efforts to bring some nationally-recognized programs to Delaware. “I can’t disclose names yet, because it’s very early in the process, but I can say it’s in soccer, lacrosse and field hockey.” The Kent complex would the perfect venue, Smith said. “There aren’t very many places where you can have 13 fields like we will at The Turf,” he said. “There are folks out there who are aware of it and I believe with the appointment of an executive director it’s a lot closer to becoming reality in some persons’ minds.” Bill Strickland, chairman of the Kent County Regional Sports Complex board of directors, said Smith’s salary will be paid by the corporation, but that final details remain to be worked out. “We’re working to establish a position about publicizing the salary, and once we confirm that, we’ll circle back,” he said. The corporation already has raised the funds to handle the first few years of operating expenses, which includes Smith’s pay and benefits, he said. Working out the terms of his contract was easy, Smith said. “It didn’t take very long to get to an agreement,” he said. “That should tell you what I think about coming into the market and about who I’m working with.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T11:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T16:12:18.430+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
