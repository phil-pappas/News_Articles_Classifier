(AP) -- La Verdad will return on short rest for the $1 million Breeders' Cup Filly & Mare Sprint on Saturday at Keeneland.\nTrainer Linda Rice decided Sunday to wheel the 5-year-old back into action only one week after her 3 3/4-length win against New York breds in the $150,000 Iroquois Stakes at Belmont Park.\nLa Verdad, 6 for 6 this year, is slated for retirement as a broodmare at the end of the season - a factor in the Breeders' Cup decision.\n''She's going to move on to her new career soon,'' Rice said. ''Any way you look at it, there's not a lot to lose. It's all upside. The only thing she is missing is a Grade 1 victory, and we're going to give her a chance.''\nSports & Recreation Horse Racing La Verdad   364/681   1602/4545   624/2272  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T22:57:11.608+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
