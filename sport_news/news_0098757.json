With the temperature tickling the high 70s and a gentle breeze ruffling color-tinged leaves on nearby trees, the Indians got the best of the Pirates for the second time this season. The victory kept Touchet undefeated at 5-0 and hiked the Tribe’s Southeast 1B-8 League record to 3-0. Touchet defeated the Pirates 56-22 in the small-school rivals’ previous meeting, a non-league affair Sept. 17 in Pomeroy. The visitors saw their records slide to 1-2 in league and 2-4 overall. Senior speedster Leo Garcia led the Indians’ offense with 189 yards rushing on 19 carries, an effort that included touchdown runs of 44 and 33 yards. Garcia was also on the receiving end of a 17-yard touchdown pass. Touchet also intercepted Pomeroy senior quarterback Havin Heytvelt three times. Indians senior Carlos Rincon picked off Heytvelt twice, returning one of them 45 yards for a touchdown, and sophomore Amin Acevado had a 55-yard pass interception return for a score. “I think Pomeroy seems to be one step away from being a pretty good football team,” Touchet coach Gary Dorman said in assessing the Pirates. “I think depth might be an issue for them, just as it is for a lot of small schools.” Pomeroy has 23 players listed on its varsity roster compared to 32 for Touchet. Two Pirate players watched the game in street clothes because of injuries, and two others — junior running back Cade Gingerich and sophomore receiver Jacob Tewalt — were banged up during the game. “This is a tough place to come and play, and Touchet is a physical team,” Pomeroy coach Sanford Bates said. “But I think our guys (Gingerich and Tewalt) will be ready for our next game. “We practiced in the rain all week, and today is was pretty warm,” Bates added. “We seemed to be fighting for energy and momentum.” Pomeroy certainly had the momentum early on as the Pirates took the opening kickoff and drove 75 yards in nine plays for the game’s first score. Gingerich ran 11 yards for the touchdown, but it proved to be Pirates’ only points of the first half. Garcia’s 44-yard scamper on Touchet’s second play from scrimmage evened the score at 6-6. And Carlos Rincon connected with Lot Butler on a 10-yard halfback pass for six points as Touchet claimed the lead for good with 59.5 seconds remaining in the first quarter. Garcia’s 33-yard touchdown run came on the second play of the second quarter following Rincon’s first interception. And on Pomeroy’s next possession, Butler deflected a Heytvelt pass, Rincon snatched it out of the air and raced 45 yards as Touchet improved its lead to 27-6. Acevado broke a 15-yard run up the middle of the field 2:41 before halftime and the Indians led 34-6 at the intermission. Pomeroy coaches were pleased with the way their team came out of the halftime break. The Pirates forced a Touchet fumble on its first play from scrimmage to begin the third quarter and Pomeroy covered 47 yards in five plays for its second TD of the game. Heytvelt connected with Tewalt for 15 yards and the TD, and Gingerich ran for a two-pointer as the Pirates closed to within 34-14. “We showed some enthusiasm to start the second half,” Bates said. “We got the fumble, scored and then forced them to go the length of the field. If we play like that the rest of the season, we are going to be fine.” Touchet responded to Pomeroy’s second score by driving 65 yards in 11 plays. Junior fullback James Kates capped the drive with a 1-yard run. Rincon fired his second TD pass of the game, a 17-yarder to Garcia, and Acevado turned his pick into a 55-yard score and Touchet led 54-14 heading into the fourth quarter and the 40-point running-clock rule was enforced. The Pirates scored last as Koty Davis, a 140-pound sophomore, broke a 29-yard run into the end zone with both teams fielding backup players. Pomeroy won the statistical battle if not the game. The Pirates rushed for 266 yards and accrued 133 passing yards compared to Touchet’s 265 yards on the ground and 39 yards via the pass. Pomeroy held a 22-14 advantage in first downs. Heytvelt gained 95 yards rushing on 15 carries and completed 11-of-17 passes. Gingerich added 92 yards rushing on 12 tries. Touchet goes back on the road Friday when it travels to Colton for a 3 p.m. league game. Pomeroy has a home date with Sunnyside Christian the same night.
