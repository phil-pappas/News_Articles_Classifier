A guy and a girl - best of buddies, the guy decides to hook up with another girl only to realise that his ‘friend’ might just be in love with him…eternal plot that Bollywood has churned out films after films…Wedding Pullav is the latest entry that promises to come up with a twist! So, with this one Anushka Ranjan, Diganth and Karan V Grover debut in Bollywood with their director Binod Pradhan, a known cinematographer who has to his credit films like 2 states, Bhaag Milkha Bhaa and Delhi-6. The cast was in Chandigarh to promote their film that is slated for release on October 16 and shared tidbits from this journey. Starting point\nAnushka debuts with Wedding Pullav that is produced by her parents – Shashi and Anu Ranjan. Was acting always on her mind? “Actually, Alia (Bhatt), my sister and I would imagine ourselves to be Spice Girls. We did want to be in the glamour industry, only Alia was certain. I made up my mind in college.” But she insists that despite being a ‘producer ki beti’, she did not get special treatment over the boys - Diganth and Karan. “It was a very professional set up. Dad praised whenever he liked something or shouted when he didn’t.” As for the best advice that her friend Alia gave to her, “’Be yourself’. Alia has huge faith in me. And the character I play is what a modern Indian girl would totally relate to – independent yet rooted in Indian ethos.” Diganth is already a big name down South and admits that he was always on the Bollywood trail. Wedding Pullav worked for him for rom-com is his forte. “My fans, well-wishers always thought I was more suited for Hindi film industry than South and here I am.” And, this film worked for him also for he has gone through the friend…lover…friend…lover confusion in real life too. Sadly, it didn’t work out in life, and whether it would in reel, we are yet to see. Karan Grover jumps to big screen from the small screen, who was happy playing Jai (J), a painter based in London who specialises in nudes. His long hair look in the film was accidental but has already won him rave reviews from his fans. “Shashi Ji is one-man army and I loved working with him. All three lead characters are honest and real.” Shashi Ranjan, the man behind the project, is happy to be in Chandigarh for he is a Panjab University alumnus and being originally from Bhiwani, feels a special connect with the city. Wedding Pullav is his baby that he could have directed but didn’t for he thought his daughter might be uncomfortable doing a ‘love’ story with him. “Now, I understand it was totally an irrational fear,” says the man evoking laughter from the entire cast. The founder of Indian Television Academy has full faith in his film, “Any love story anywhere would be the same. It’s the narrative that matters.” mona@tribunemail.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T02:15:30.302+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
