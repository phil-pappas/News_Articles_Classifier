I think the great thing about this challenge is if we give ourselves a chance, as far as we need to prepare as well as possible. That’s the only way we’re going to give ourselves a chance to be our best. I learned first-hand last game. I didn’t give a chance because I was playing a little timid, because I wasn’t fully prepared. So I think just the discipline and everything, we’re all connected and we need to keep going in that facet.”\n(On what he means by not being fully prepared) “I feel like when you’re prepared you’re fully confident. You can challenge everything, and you’re your best and you really trust what you’re doing out there.”\n(On if there any specific reasons why the defense didn’t play as well in the fourth quarter last week against the Bengals) “I think the most important thing was just body language. We weren’t really relentless like we’ve been in the past. We weren’t fighting for everything. We weren’t really just giving it everything that we have, in my eye.”\nMost Read Stories Seahawks’ Derrick Coleman arrested for investigation of hit, run Boom times in Bothell as McMenamins hotel, entertainment complex opens Mayor wants developer off project, cites violation of city values Founder resurrects SF bakeries shuttered by Starbucks 7 Juanita football players told police of hazing, attacks Unlimited Digital Access. $1 for 4 weeks. (On what kept them from being fully prepared) “I don’t know. I don’t know. Maybe I got up here talking about the seams, and I probably got distracted about that last week. So I’ve got to watch what I say to y’all.”\n(On if he feels the defense has the same swagger as they had in the past) “Yes, of course. Nothing’s changed.”\n(On if there is a reason why communication issues have been a factor this year) “Yeah of course. When you’re on the road, the time difference, we can get in our little bubbles, we’re not as talkative to each other as we need to be. I felt that early on in the locker room. But it’s great, great lessons to learn. But we’re going to learn from it because it happened.”\n(On what the key is to playing defense against Cam Newton) “I think just building on what we’ve done in the past. He’s running the ball a lot more. You don’t hear about a franchise quarterback just running the ball like that, and giving up his body for his team. So they’re 4-0, he’s doing a great job of finding a way to win. So we’re going to try to stop it.”\n(On if Cam Newton is doing anything better than before other than running the ball) “He trusts his arm. He trusts in his throws. And he makes a lot of great throws.”\n(On the team winning games when it has lost the turnover battle and losing games when it has won the turnover battle) “Yeah, you know, it’s football. You can’t really put your finger on this is the correct formula for this situation because it’s bigger than us. It’s out of our control. You’ve just got to play to the final whistle. Usually, in the past when we win the turnover ratio, we always win. But it’s a new season, we’ll figure it out.”\n(On if he would still be as critical of the defense’s play if the team had won last week) “Yeah, when you’re out there you know the truth deep down inside. It’s an ongoing battle. But if you trust yourself it’s straight peace out there. You know, you can give your energy to everybody else on the defense. So you know. When you look in the mirror, you know.”\n(On what the protocol is for players to do when a teammate intercepts a pass) “Of course you need to block. But Michael Bennett, he doesn’t block. If he does block he goes straight for the quarterback. He did it yesterday in practice, so we’ve got to get him out of that habit.”\nBob Condotta : 206-515-5699 or bcondotta@seattletimes.com ; on Twitter: @bobcondotta .
