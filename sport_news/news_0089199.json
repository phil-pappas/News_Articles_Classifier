Joaquin currently has winds of 125 miles an hour and is finally moving to the northeast away from the Bahamas. Joaquin will move well out to sea and will not make landfall in the United States. However, tropical moisture from Joaquin will interact with a stationary front and produce historic amounts of rain for some areas. the heaviest rain is anticipated over North Carolina and South Carolina where some places can see over a foot of rain. Some severe thunderstorms are also possible over the Carolinas. Light rain and drizzle can be expected over the Northeast along this same frontal boundary. Fair weather can be expected for the Mississippi River Valley where high pressure will be in control.
