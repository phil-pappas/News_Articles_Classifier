We have all kinds of little things going on -- we have a raffle going on,\" said salon owner, Bridgette McCloud.\nThe idea came about five years ago when Stylist Jamie Green suggested they get involved in helping Ohio Valley cancer patients.\nTo take part in the online raffle, you can visit the Cloud 9 Facebook page , or stop in the salon on Zane Highway in Martins Ferry.", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/Cloud-9-A-Bridgette-McLeod-Salon-158638140864069/"], "published": "2015-10-22T00:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T03:09:30.660+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
