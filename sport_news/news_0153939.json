The survey found that 62 percent of Texans want to see the rivalry restart, while only 13 percent said no.\n\"I think the most diehard Longhorn fans don't want a piece of Texas A&M right now, but they're the minority,\" Graham said. \"Texans who follow college sports overwhelmingly want to see the Aggies and Longhorns on the field again in the near future.\"\nSince the two have stopped playing they have traded shots at each other. Texas A&M regent Tony Buzbee posted a Facebook status that suggested the Aggies should schedule Texas to add a 'cupcake' to their schedule.\n\"I am going to advocate that the Aggies play Texas again in the near future,\" Buzbee wrote on Facebook. \"Because of our brutal SEC West schedule, where we play the likes of Alabama, Ole Miss, Mississippi State, LSU, etc., the Aggies need some cupcake games to rest and heal. In my view, Texas is just as weak if not weaker than the non-conference games we play, so we may as well play them.\"\nAfter Texas announced it would sell alcohol at football games, Texas A&M Chancellor John Sharp said its athletic program \"has not reached the point where we require the numbing effects of alcohol.\"\nThe Aggies are currently off to 4-0 start. While Texas is off to its worst start since 1956 with a 1-3 record.\nThe teams last played in 2011. Texas defeated Texas A&M, 27-25.\nOn Twitter:\n @Nick_Castillo74", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/Nick_Castillo74"], "published": "2015-10-01T03:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T13:44:24.824+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
