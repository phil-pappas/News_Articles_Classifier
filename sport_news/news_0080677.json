Tribune Tower, this newspaper's home for 90 years, has been put on the auction block. Whatever the future may hold for the Gothic Revival structure, it is bound to be different than its past.\nLike the Wrigley Building just across Michigan Avenue, the Tower was a beacon. Illuminated at night, the Wrigley Building marked Chicago's location for ships on Lake Michigan. The Tower's flying buttresses marked a bastion of traditional — that is to say, Middle American — values. Upon its opening on July 6, 1925, the Tribune Editorial Board observed that the Tower was intended to be more than a building to house printing presses and want-ad order takers. \"It was conceived, designed, and completed in a sense of trusteeship for the higher needs of a civilized community.\"\nIf ever a building lived up to its specs, it has been the Tower. Inside and out, it has kept historical memory alive. Gathered from the world over, the famed Tribune stones embedded in its walls recall civilizations ancient and modern, Western and non-Western. In its newsrooms, generations of reporters have pounded out stories illustrative of the best and worst sides of human nature. They have chronicled wars and natural disasters, the achievements of great scientists and the passing parade of workaday folks.\nFor the Tower's first three decades, it was presided over by Col. Robert McCormick, the paper's editor and publisher, from a palatial 24th-floor office. A born-again conservative — he had been a progressive-minded reformer — McCormick railed against President Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal, decried Al Capone's baneful influence on Chicago and opposed America's involvement in World War II, right up to the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. During the Cold War, McCormick had the Tower's basement retrofitted as an air-raid shelter.\nDecoding Tribune Tower Kori Rumore, Chris Walker, Ryan Marx, Chicago Tribune Decoding Tribune Tower Built in 1922, the iconic Chicago landmark carries architectural significance \"The world's most beautiful office building.\" That's what Chicago Tribune Co-publishers Col.

Decoding Tribune Tower Built in 1922, the iconic Chicago landmark carries architectural significance \"The world's most beautiful office building.\" That's what Chicago Tribune Co-publishers Col. Robert R. McCormick and Joseph Patterson set out to create when they announced an international design... (Kori Rumore, Chris Walker, Ryan Marx, Chicago Tribune) \"To inform the Tribune population and others in the neighborhood that an atomic bomb attack is imminent, a steamboat whistle soon is to be installed on the seventh floor of the light court behind the Tribune Tower,\" the paper reported Nov. 14, 1949.\nThe Tower's fourth-floor newsroom witnessed a remarkable scene April 30, 1974, when Tribune editor Clayton Kirkpatrick got up on a desk to announce that the newspaper was printing the full text of the Watergate tapes. The paper had supported Richard Nixon for president, but after reading the transcripts noted: \"Now in about 300,000 words we have seen the private man, and we are appalled.\" Shortly, Nixon resigned. In 2008, the paper backed Barack Obama, observing: \"This endorsement makes some history for the Chicago Tribune. This is the first time the newspaper has endorsed the Democratic Party's nominee for president.\"\nOn June 10, 1922, the Tribune made a splash with a worldwide design competition for a new headquarters building on the up-and-coming, though still-quite-mundane Michigan Avenue. The Colonel, no stranger to publicity, threw in a gaudy $100,000 prize, nearly $1.5 million in today's money.\nExplore the rocks, bricks and other artifacts on Tribune Tower's walls (interactive guide) Chicago Tribune Graphics With the additions of bricks from Comiskey Park and Wrigley Field, the limestone exterior walls of Tribune Tower are now covered with 150 historically significant items from other buildings, structures and landmarks.

(Chicago Tribune Graphics) Announcing the winner, the Tribune saluted New York architect John Mead Howells. \"The embattled crown of his building utters the Tribune ideal,\" the paper wrote Dec. 8, 1922. The article went on to compliment the runner-up, Eliel Saarinen. \"Of Mr. Saarinen, the Finlander who wins second place, the Tribune knows nothing save that he has done a notable and lovely thing. His Tribune design arrived during the final days of our competition and it created a sensation.\"\nIt would continue to do so. Saarinen was a modernist, an inheritor of an architectural style born in Chicago with Louis Sullivan's famed skyscrapers. Civic pride would suggest the sleek lines and well-proportioned setbacks of Saarinen's design would have given it a leg up. Sullivan praised it. Yet it was destined to be the missing link of Chicago architecture: an unrealized vision midway between those of Sullivan and Mies Van der Rohe.\nIn giving the nod to Howells, the contest jury noted: \"One gratifying result of this world competition has been to establish the superiority of American design.\" The jurors reported: \"Only one foreign design stands out,\" happily adding that it \"did not come from France, Italy or England, the recognized centers of European culture, but from the little northern nation of Finland.\"\nThose judgments meshed with McCormick's world view, which is not surprising. He was one of the judges.\nHe had begun as an enthusiastic supporter of President Woodrow Wilson's declaration that World War I was a war to \"make the world safe for democracy.\" McCormick pulled strings to get an officer's commission and recruited his own fighting unit at the Tribune's headquarters prior to the Tower. But while proud of his military service with the 1st Division — mementos of the \"Big Red One\" decorated his Tower office — what he witnessed in Europe turned McCormick into an isolationist. Having won the war, America's allies carved up the spoils, notwithstanding Wilson's lofty ideals.\nSo it was inevitable that the commission to design Tribune Tower would go to an American architect. His design has been criticized as a throwback to premodern architecture, especially compared to Saarinen's forward-thinking vision. The Tower has been satirized as looking like a supersized wedding cake.\nYet its hope when pitting competing architects, the Tribune had said, was to give Chicago \"the most beautiful and distinctive office building in the world.\"\nSo if beauty is in the eye of the beholder, McCormick got what he was looking for. All day long, sometimes well into the night, pedestrians pause in front of the Tower. Some crane their heads to look at those buttresses flying high over Michigan Avenue. Other eyes are captured by the 150 Tribune stones, the first gathered by McCormick's correspondents before the building's construction commenced. The most recent, fragments of Wrigley Field and Comiskey Park, were set in place this summer.\nSome passersby are inspired to put a hand on the facade, wanting even a moment of physical contact with the history it represents: the Alamo and John Brown's cabin, Abraham Lincoln's tomb and Independence Hall, where the Declaration of Independence was signed.\nrgrossman@tribpub.com\nTwitter @quondamprof\nCopyright © 2015, Chicago Tribune Opinion Ludwig Mies van der Rohe", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-56216f96/turbine/ct-tribune-tower-architectural-features", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-55cf4bb7/turbine/ct-tribune-tower-wall-artifacts", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-56211e86/turbine/ct-tribune-tower-saarinen-mccormick-wwi-flashback-1018-jm-20151015"], "published": "2015-10-17T04:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T06:42:40.629+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
