But he is doing well at the moment, so there is no reason to change,\" Giroud told reporters.\n\"Whether it was at Tours, Montpellier or Arsenal, I have never experienced a situation like this, I have often played from the start. I need to take positives and to harden myself mentally. It is something new for me.\n\"I was in (Walcott's) place in previous seasons at Arsenal. I imagine what he must have been thinking. But I feel that the coach believes in me,\" the 29-year-old French striker added.\nGiroud is not worried over his lack of playing time and is confident he will pounce on any opportunity to win back his place in the starting line-up.\n\"It has been for several matches now that I have played less, that is for sure, but I do not need to be worried. I need a bit more game time but also to believe more in my abilities,\" Giroud said.\nArsenal, who are second in the league table after eight games, travel to face promoted side Watford on Saturday.\n(For .)", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/AO_Sports", "https://www.facebook.com/AhramOnlineSports?fref=ts"], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T17:32:23.356+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
