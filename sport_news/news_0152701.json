(AP Photo/Frank Augstein) more > By ROB HARRIS - Associated Press   \nLONDON (AP) - Switzerland will return for the European Championship for the first time since co-hosting the tournament eight years ago after thrashing San Marino 7-0 on Friday with seven different scorers. \nAs the Swiss secured second place, Group E leader England made it nine wins out of nine in qualifying, with Theo Walcott and Raheem Sterling scoring in a 2-0 win over Estonia. \nWith one qualifier remaining, Switzerland has an unassailable five-point advantage over Slovenia, which was held 1-1 by Lithuania. \nThe last time Switzerland played at the Euros in 2008, England failed to qualify but reaching the expanded 24-team tournament has proved a breeze for Roy Hodgson’s side. \nEngland is the only team with a 100 percent record in qualifying for next year’s finals and should be top-seeded in the draw. \nCopyright © 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T23:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T00:28:47.836+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
