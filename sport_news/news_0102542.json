Like others from his draft class, MKG was working to incur a big leap forward —a la Bulls guard Jimmy Butler a season ago, who won Most Improved Player and made his first All-Star team.\n“He’s totally changed his shooting mechanics really more than any player I’ve ever seen,” Hornets head coach Steve Clifford said of Kidd-Gilchrist in April, per the AP .\nMKG was nothing more than a passable mid-range shooter a season ago. The small forward didn’t attempt a single three-point shot (previously a paltry 3-of-18 from distance in his career), crippling the team's spacing on the floor at times. But changes to his shooting stroke hinted that he could be set for drastic improvements ahead.\n“It’s increased his confidence level,” Clifford said. “His whole leadership, assertiveness on the court and his understanding of the game has come out more for his teammates as he’s gotten more confident.”\n• MORE NBA: Training camp storylines: Western Conference | Eastern Conf.\nUnfortunately, Kidd-Gilchrist won’t have a chance at posting a breakout season this year in the same vein as Butler’s. Following surgery to repair a torn labrum in his shoulder, the defensive-minded wing is likely to miss the entire 2015-16 campaign . There’s a chance he’ll return in late April, but if the Hornets aren’t in the hunt for a playoff spot at that time, there frankly won’t be much of a reason for MKG to rush back.\nSo can Buzz City still be a playoff team without the heart and soul of its defense?\nWhen Kidd-Gilchrist was on the court for the Hornets last season, the effective field goal percentage of opponents was 47.4% and they scored 98.8 points per 100 possessions. Those numbers jumped to 49.6% and 107.4 points per 100 possessions when MKG was sitting on the bench. Additionally, Charlotte was 27-28 when Kidd-Gilchrist played, and a lowly 6-21 when he sat out. In those 27 contests without the former No. 2 overall pick, the Hornets were outscored by an average of 9.1 points per game.\nTo sum up, the outlook is grim for Charlotte without the defensive dynamo. There’s simply no way to sugarcoat it.\nDevastating injury news for Charlotte + MKG, per @WojYahooNBA . CHA consistently way, way better wMKG on floor. Pressure on Batum, Lamb, etc\n— Zach Lowe (@ZachLowe_NBA) October 5, 2015 As Grantland’s Zach Lowe noted via Twitter, pressure will now ramp up on new additions Nic Batum and Jeremy Lamb —two of the team’s primary offseason acquisitions. If you’re a Hornets fan, the words “pressure on Lamb” is not what you wanted to see heading into the new campaign.\nNevertheless, that’s the state of things in Charlotte.\nComing off any other season, Batum would actually be seen as a suitable replacement for the injured 22-year-old. During the 2014-15 season, however, the Frenchman made just 40% of his field-goal attempts and 32.4% of his three-point shots—both the worst marks of his career.\nPreviously, Batum had established himself as one of the best three-and-D perimeter role players in the game. He converted 37.5% of his triples in three seasons before the drop-off a season ago, and he pestered opponents on the perimeter by using his lanky frame. He could return to that form in Charlotte, but the breakdown of his shots last season doesn't promote confidence.\nBatum was about league average above the break a season ago, but he really struggled from the corners. The 30.6% of threes he made from the left corner was down considerably from 54.1% in 2013-14. The corner three is widely regarded as the most efficient shot in the game, but Batum was anemic from those spots throughout his rough year.\nIf there is a silver lining here, it’s that MKG’s injury opens up the small forward spot for Batum. Rather than playing him at shooting guard—where the 26-year-old veteran has played an estimated 0% of his minutes over the past two seasons, according to Basketball Reference —he can play at his more natural spot on the floor. Even with positionless basketball becoming a bigger trend in today’s NBA, that could prove to be an advantage from a comfort zone standpoint.\nIf Clifford opts to slide Batum down to the vacant small forward spot, he’ll need a new shooting guard in the starting lineup. Chances are that responsibility will fall to Lamb.\nNBA Pacers continue to sell Paul George on the virtues of playing power forward by Rob Mahoney", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/ZachLowe_NBA/status/651106650938572800", "http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/b/batumni01.html", "https://w.graphiq.com/w/3cfQg7TSPad", "https://w.graphiq.com/w/2zFae4Qg1CJ", "http://bigstory.ap.org/article/a49728079505480494aa322898eb15f4/ap-source-hornets-sign-kidd-gilchrist-52m-extension", "https://w.graphiq.com/w/gtp2MlyK48l", "http://twitter.com/@BenLebo", "https://twitter.com/WojYahooNBA", "https://w.graphiq.com/w/35BjmbEicGV"], "published": "2015-10-07T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T18:42:48.983+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
