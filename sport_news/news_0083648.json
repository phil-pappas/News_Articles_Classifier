By Jesse Newell jesse.newell@cjonline.com \nLAWRENCE — Carlton Bragg was the star of Late Night in the Phog — both before and after the scrimmage began. \nThe 6-foot-9 freshman played a few songs on the piano during the entertainment portion of the night, then had one of the best highlights in Crimson’s 36-31 victory over Blue at the 31st annual basketball kickoff event. \nTen minutes into the 15-minute exhibition, the Cleveland native put in a reverse alley-oop on a feed from Devonte’ Graham. \n“I don’t know how I caught that one,” Bragg said. “I just made the play.” \nBragg finished with four points on 2-for-5 shooting with 3 rebounds and 2 steals. He also received high praise from Bill Self during his televised interview on Jayhawk Network, as the 13th-year KU coach said he didn’t foresee Bragg staying in Lawrence all four years. \n“He has great feel,” Self said. “There’s nothing, I don’t think, that kid won’t be able to do in a couple years here.” \nBragg’s musical performance was impressive as well. \nWith a spotlight on him, he performed the songs at mid-court. Bragg, who took one year of piano in high school, can’t read sheet music but has learned to play songs by ear. \nHe said he picked up these particular songs from a friend after he heard him play at the KU Union. \n“That’s a pretty good gift to have,” Self said of Bragg’s sight-reading ability. “I told him he should do that when I heard him play over in South Korea. But I didn’t know he was that good. He did a nice job, and that was a lot of pressure.” \nBragg admitted to being “very nervous” and later was asked which musician he’d compare himself to. \n“I would say John Legend,” Bragg said with a laugh. “I can’t play as good as him, but I’m learning.” \nPerry Ellis led all KU players with 12 points, while Jamari Traylor had 9 and Svi Mykhailiuk contributed 8. \nNOTES \n■ KU sophomore and Topeka native Jerrod Martin Castro was the big winner of the night, as he earned a $10,000 check from Self after KU director of basketball operations Brennan Bechard hit his second of two half-court shots. \nCastro, a 2014 Washburn Rural graduate, dropped to his knees after the shot went through, and a few seconds later, he was dog-piled by KU’s basketball players in celebration. \nSelf offered two randomly picked KU students the opportunity to win a $10,000 check from him if that person hit one of two half-court shots. The contestants also could choose anyone in attendance — outside of current players or recruits — to take their shots for them. \nFormer KU player Darnell Jackson airballed his two attempts before Bechard made his second try. \nSelf called the half-court shot “the highlight of the night.” \n“Whatever happens, I hope he’s cool with it, because he should be buying tonight,” Self said. “That’s like making a hole-in-one. You will have to buy the rest of the night if somebody makes a shot for you like that.” \n■ KU held a moment of silence for former player Bill Bridges, who passed away Sept. 25 in Santa Monica, Calif., after a long battle with cancer. He was 76. \nThe 6-foot-6 forward averaged 13.9 rebounds in 78 games at KU, ranking second on the school’s all-time list behind only Wilt Chamberlain. The Hobbs, N.M., native was an All-Big Eight player each of his three seasons at KU from 1959-61 and an All-America selection in his final year when he averaged 16.1 points and 14.1 rebounds. \nBridges, whose No. 32 jersey was retired in 2004, played 12 years in the NBA and won a title with Golden State in 1975. \n■ New KU women’s coach Brandon Schneider spoke for the first time at Late Night, admitting it was “the largest crowd I’ve ever had the opportunity to address.” \n“There is absolutely no place where basketball is a bigger deal,” he said. \nFreshman guard Aisia Robertson highlighted the women’s scrimmage, knocking down a 3-pointer with a pair of flashy assists. \n■ As expected, KU hosted five of Rivals.com’s top-35 recruits in the 2016 class: No. 2 Harry Giles, No. 5 De’Aaron Fox, No. 6 Malik Monk, No. 16 Marques Bolden and No. 35 Schnider Herard. \nThe Jayhawks will have a minimum of three scholarships available next season with the graduations of forwards Ellis, Traylor and Hunter Mickelson.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T06:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T18:48:58.103+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
