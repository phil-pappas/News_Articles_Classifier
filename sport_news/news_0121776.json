Well, now you’ll never forget, because he’s making $1 beer and oysters happen at the restaurant during every Ole Miss game. Watch Ole Miss on the bar-mounted TV while enjoying Miller High Life pony bottles and some of Atlanta’s best oysters on the half-shell, available for $1 during game time only. If you like Ole Miss football, chances are you also like beer and oysters. Come watch the game at One Eared Stag and don’t be surprised if Chef Phalen is yelling “HOTTY TODDY!” at the table next to you.
