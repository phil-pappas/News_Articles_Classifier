Bir Billing Paragliding Association has erected a tent village for the pilots participating in the World Cup. Minister for Urban Development and president of the Bir Billing Paragliding Association Sudhir Sharma organised a yajna at Billing to seek divine blessing for successful conduct of the World Cup. Since very few hotels and residential places were available at Bir the tourists and other people coming for the event had a hard time finding places for accommodation. Most of the official rest houses and home stay hotels have been taken over by the Bir Billing Paragliding Association to house their guests. Some of tourists who had come for the event did not even find people who could guide them to find the places of stay in the vicinity of Bir. The event proved a boost for the infrastructure of the Bir area as most of the roads were repaired by the PWD. Today evening would be marked by cultural events and music extravaganza. Many local artists have been engaged by the Bir Billing Paragliding Association to entertain the participants and other visitors. The Airports Authority of India is main sponsor of the event and many senior officials of the organisation reached here for the inauguration tomorrow morning.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T22:52:34.999+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
