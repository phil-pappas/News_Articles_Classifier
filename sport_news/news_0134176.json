We haven't achieved anything yet.\"\nPrevious comebacks\nShould Zamalek pull off an unlikely win that would take them through to the final, the result would be the biggest comeback in their history in African competitions.\nThe Cairo giants did manage to come back from a 2-0 quarter-final first leg defeat at Ethiopia's Michelle Army in the Champions League's old edition in 1976.\nThe team, led by the legendary Hassan Shehata, then registered a thumping 6-1 home win in the return leg to go through to the semis – where they bowed out at the hands of Nigeria's Shooting Stars on penalties.\nEight years later, Zamalek also achieved another remarkable comeback, this time against Algeria's Tizi Ouzou who intially prevailed 3-1 before the Egyptians overturned the deficit with a 3-0 home win in Cairo.\nArch-rivals Ahly have also made something similar in the last decade, when a late goal from then-midfielder Shehab Ahmed gifted them a 3-0 Champions league last-16 return-leg win over Ittihad Tripoli in 2010 – overturning a 2-0 first-leg defeat.\nAhly have also another difficult mission against South Africa's Orlando Pirates, after the Egyptians were beaten 1-0 in South Africa.\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/AO_Sports", "https://www.facebook.com/AhramOnlineSports?fref=ts"], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T06:18:14.106+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
