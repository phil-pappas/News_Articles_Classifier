Well, linebacker Shane Ray didn't quite get that luxury. With a defense as talented as the Broncos, if you don't play well, you don't play.\nWhen he walks on the field on Sunday, he doesn't consider himself a rookie.\n\"That tag is taken away when you're thrown in the fire and your teammates expect a lot of you,\" Ray said. \"I can't make an excuse if I mess up and say, \"Oh well, it's because I'm a rookie.' \"\nSacks in back-to-back games indicated how well Ray is learning.\nIt'd be easy for Ray, a 2015 first-round pick, to get down, facing the challenge of playing behind DeMarcus Ware and Von Miller. Even former Colorado State star Shaquil Barrett has gotten snaps in front of him after Barrett's impressive training camp and preseason.\nWATCH: Tom Jackson compares Broncos’ 2015 defense to ‘Orange Crush’\nBut if Ray pouted about his lack of playing time, he wouldn't be prepared to step up if needed, such as happened Sunday in Oakland when Ware went out with back spasms.\nRay was ready and it showed. On the Raiders' second-to-last drive Ray bull rushed his way toward sackingOakland quarterback Derek Carr. The sack led to an unsuccessful fourth-down play that all but ended Oakland's comeback bid.\nWith Ware's status for Sunday's game against Cleveland unknown, Ray could get more chances.\nAdvertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T12:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T18:07:09.941+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
