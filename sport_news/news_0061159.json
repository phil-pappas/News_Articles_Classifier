The Braves surrendered 20 in the first half. \n\"Not only did we make too many mistakes, but we couldn't move the football in the first half,\" Fucetola said. \nCredit Cherokee's defense, which never allowed the excellent Williamstown running game to get in gear. \nThis was considered a potential South Jersey Group 5 preview, so the teams could very well meet again. \n\"I hope so,\" Fucetola said. \nWilliamstown had a bad snap on a punt on its first possession, giving Cherokee the ball on the Braves 13-yard line. On the first play from scrimmage, quarterback Evan Powell ran outside for a 13-yard touchdown. \nWilliamstown fumbled on its next possession and that resulted in a 28-yard field goal by Cherokee sophomore Ethan McCarren. \nCherokee's Nicholas Elskamp forced a fumble on the next series and Kelso recovered at the Williamstown 30. \nSix plays later Johnathan Lovett scored from 2 yards out, and Cherokee owned a 17-0 lead with 2:18 left in the first quarter. \nMcCarren, a sophomore with a big leg, upped the lead to 20-0 in the second quarter on a 25-yard field goal with plenty to spare. \nThe Chiefs missed a chance to really put their foot on Williamstown late in the half. With seven seconds remaining, Williamstown's Wade Inge intercepted a Chiefs pass in the end zone, keeping the Braves within 20-0 at the half. Cherokee had no timeouts and was forced to pass in that situation. \nIt gave the Braves some hope, but when they failed on two different fourth-down conversion attempts in the third quarter, it was the continuation of a long night. \nWilliamstown 0 0 0 0 - 0 \nCherokee 17 3 0 0 - 20 \nC: Evan Powell 13 run (Ethan McCarren kick) \nC: FG McCarren 28 \nC: Jonathan Lovett 2 run (McCarren kick) \nC: FG McCarren 25", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T06:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T07:07:50.304+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
