Chef Cathy Whims, bar manager Ryan Magarian and restaurateur Kurt Huffman have Shakespeare-size ambitions for their little corner of the Pearl District. After giving us Oven & Shaker — a 50-50 kitchen-bar partnership — a couple of years back, they've done it again, and in stumbling distance, with Hamlet. In place of Oven & Shaker's pizza, Hamlet lives up to its name as a porcine paradise, from domestic ham to jamón ibérico. That pricey pig and several sherry cocktails hint at a Spanish accent. But the best drink evokes the Italian antipasti of melon draped in prosciutto: the gin-honeydew-lemon concoction Meat v. Melon. That seems like a mismatch, but melon wins this round, with dried prosciutto serving as garnish, though a nice salty one. Other signature drinks proved strong, though the pungent carrot-vodka mix Thumper's Revenge should be reserved for horseradish junkies. Hamlet is one of the year's most stylish new bars, with comfy banquettes, gorgeous tile and Whims-ical pig accents, like the pint-sized porker holding aloft a skull on their sign, promising \"cocktails, beer and swine.\" The trio, despite the tragic nature of their namesake, were clearly having fun when they put this concept together. You likely will, too.\nOrder this: Melon v. Meat: It's everything you'd hope for in a cocktail to complement ham.\n232 N.W. 12th Ave., 503-241-4009, hamletpdx.com\n-- Colin Powers", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T02:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T06:05:13.098+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
