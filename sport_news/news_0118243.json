In a sport in which in-game chemistry is so important, that’s a fairly significant shift, but it could also spawn the Kings’ most productive first line in several years.\nKopitar brings extraordinary vision and on-puck strength. Gaborik is a sniper who spent most of his pre-Kings career on the right side. Lucic is considered an underachiever with 30-goal potential.\nThe new line played together Saturday in the Kings’ exhibition finale, when they beat Colorado, 4-0, in Las Vegas. Now the adjustment period is over. The Kings’ season begins Wednesday against San Jose at Staples Center, and the first line needs to thrive quickly.\n“The comfort level is not there 100 percent yet,” Kopitar said this week, “but we’re getting there. We’re talking a lot, but it all comes down to playing to your strengths. Looch came in probably not knowing what me and Gabby are all about, and now we’re finding our stride.”\nIt’s easy to see what the Kings are thinking. The addition of Lucic, a physical force at 6-foot-3 and 235 pounds, should draw attention from opponents and open up the ice for his linemates.\nThe Kings adore physical wingers who can score, and the addition of Lucic, who enters the final year of his contract, was a low-risk move. It’s similar to when the Kings tried captain Dustin Brown on the first line, but Brown, another bruising, fearless winger, never seemed to find the right chemistry with Kopitar and Gaborik.\nIs Lucic the answer? He scored 30 goals for Boston in 2010-11 and scored 24 goals as recently as 2013-14 but drew some ire last season when he totaled only 18 goals and 26 assists.\nOnly 27, Lucic can position himself for a major, multi-year contract next summer if he thrives this season.\n“It’s not like they brought me here to change the identity or change the style of the team’s play,” Lucic said. “It’s just to add another component to what they already have. I think that’s going to make the transition a little bit easier for myself and I’m excited to get things going.”\nDon’t overlook the importance of Gaborik. He twice scored 42 goals as a right winger, but Gaborik has a long history of nagging injuries and, at age 33, he isn’t likely to become more durable.\nAlso, Gaborik hasn’t played a regular-season game on the right side since the Kings acquired him from Columbus midway through the 2013-14 season.\n“It’s a bit of a change but I don’t think it’s going to be an issue,” Gaborik said. “I have to work on some stuff in our own zone, just to remind myself (about defensive responsibilities) on the right side a bit, but I think it’s going to be good and there’s going to be more opportunities from that side.”\nFINAL EXHIBITION \nThe Kings ended their exhibition schedule with a strong all-around effort and beat the Avalanche, 4-0, at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas.\nThe bottom-six forwards supplied most of the offense, as Dustin Brown and Kyle Clifford scored first-period goals and Trevor Lewis scored five minutes into the second period. Gaborik scored in the third period. Goalie Jonathan Quick , in his only full game of the preseason, made 14 saves.\nThe Kings finished the preseason with a 4-1-1 record and allowed a total of eight goals in six games.\nContact the writer: rhammond@ocregister.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T08:52:41.134+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
