Another individual with knowledge of the situation told NJ Advance Media the examination may not be on Tuesday, but is expected to have soon. \nPierre-Paul had his right index finger amputated , fractured his thumb and lost parts of his middle finger and thumb in a Fourth of July weekend fireworks accident. He reported to the Giants prior to Week 1, but the team did not think he was physically ready to play. Pierre-Paul returned to South Florida where he continued to work out. \nThe team will reportedly take another look on Tuesday. \nPierre-Paul is currently on the reserve/franchise player list and does not count against the 53-man roster. He never signed his franchise tender. Even if he passes the physical and is cleared to play, the two sides will likely have to reach terms on a financial agreement. They have until Nov. 17. At that point, Pierre-Paul will be unable to play this season. . @JayGlazer with the Inside Scoop on JPP and more only on #FOXNFLSunday ! https://t.co/lbGoNQmTHZ â€” FOX Sports: NFL (@NFLonFOX) October 18, 2015 \nPierre-Paul, before the injury, was scheduled to make $14.8 million this season as the Giants franchise player. But he's no longer the same player and is by no means certain to be cleared by the Giants. A person with knowledge of the situation doubted in recent weeks that Pierre-Paul would get on the field for the team this season. \nThe Giants could certainly use Pierre-Paul if he's able to rush the passer. They are tied for 27th in the NFL with seven sacks entering Week 6, and have had trouble pressuring opposing quarterbacks with four-man rushes. \nPierre-Paul had 12.5 sacks in an up-and-down 2014 season. Damontre Moore and Cullen Jenkins are on pace to lead the Giants this season with 6.0 sacks. \nRELATED : Jon Beason calls out 49ers OL for 'coward move' \nGlazer reported that Pierre-Paul asked the Giants to reach out to Nike to ask them if they could make a protective cover or glove for the affected hand. The Giants said they could not do it because Pierre-Paul was not technically under contract. \nIn the meantime, the Giants are getting $871K added to their salary cap each week that Pierre-Paul is not on their active roster. The full $14.8 million counted at the start of the season. \nSalary cap space can be rolled over into the following year. The Giants are currently $11.9 million under the NFL's salary cap, according to NFL Players Association records.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T20:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T22:52:43.874+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
