Across the nation, zombie runs have become as popular as zombie crawls. The latter is basically a pub-crawl with costumes, and the upcoming Eye Heart Brains crawl at the 16th Street Mall on Oct. 17 is one of the largest in the world. Zombie runs are a bit more active. Here’s the gist: Runners are split into groups of survivors and zombies. The survivors try to make it through an obstacle course without being “eaten” by the zombies. The rules change a bit from run to run, but for the most part, all wounded survivors then become zombies. It’s basically a mud run with blood and gore in place of mud. Why isn’t there one in Summit? I have no idea. I’m sure they’re a logistical nightmare, but any run through the woods is better than a slog through a suburban field somewhere. And besides, if you believe the zombie documentary “Doc of the Dead,” people in remote areas like Wyoming and the Colorado mountains have the best chances of surviving a zombie apocalypse. Let’s start training now. Tigers volleyball vs. the Western Slope With seven games to go, the Tigers volleyball team is in prime position to finish the season with a bang (see the story on page 18). They have a deep roster of veteran seniors, promising freshman and a few of the tallest girls in the Western Slope. This isn’t to say the next seven games will be a cakewalk. The 4A Slope is a tough and unforgiving league, but Summit (5-6) is back on its feet after a shaky stretch in the middle of the season. The Tigers beat Delta earlier this week, showing plenty of grit after a string of back-to-back losses against three top-ranked teams: No. 5 Delta, No. 6 Steamboat Springs and No. 23 Battle Mountain. The Tigers try to keep their momentum rolling at home when they face off against Palisade (7-8) today. Play begins at 11 a.m. with JV, followed at 1 p.m. by the varsity match. The Tigers have yet to play the Bulldogs this season, and head coach Liz Hughes believes her team (including six seniors) has found the right mix of offense, defense and pure energy to beat anyone. Head down to Summit High and show your support. Ski training Few things can put a damper on a full ski season like an injury in November — or October. Before strapping in, give your legs, knees and ankles a little love with preseason training and conditioning. Beginning Nov. 3, the Breckenridge Recreation Center hosts a four-week winter conditioning course. The all-ages course prepares participants for the winter sports gamut: Snowboarding, alpine skiing, Nordic touring, snowshoeing and just about everything held on the snow. It’s a high-intensity circuit class, with a mix of body-weight exercises, stamina work and strength training. The hour-long classes begin at 6:15 a.m. every Tuesday and Thursday until Dec. 1, with no class on Nov. 26 for Thanksgiving. Sign up soon at the rec or online — the class will fill quickly. The two ski conditioning classes at the Silverthorne rec are already closed to new participants, but never fear. The rec hosts plenty of registration and drop-in fitness classes. The drop-in courses are free with a membership, and the next round of X-Train (a high-intensity cross-training program) begins in November. If you’re the sort to train solo, we’ve printed a handful of sample ski-conditioning programs over the past few weeks. In early October, our PT columnist Eric Dube recommended three simple exercises to strengthen hips and all connected muscles. The best part: All three can be done at home. So find a resistance band and get to work — the powder is calling.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T06:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T07:51:47.271+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
