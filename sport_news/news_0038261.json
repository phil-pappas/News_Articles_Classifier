By Jocelyn Sheets Newton Daily News \nPELLA — Newton High’s Cardinals didn’t give Class 3A top-ranked Pella’s Little Dutch any gifts Friday night. Coming off a five-turnover loss to Ballard, the Cardinals did not have a turnover against the Little Dutch. \nThe Cardinals weren’t able to slow down the potent offense of the Little Dutch, losing 47-7, but they did what they wanted to do — compete and improve. \n“I’m very proud of the way our guys fought. We focused all week on being competitive with Pella, and we were,” Newton head coach Ed Ergenbright said. “Our run defense against Nathan Henry was outstanding.” \nHenry, Pella’s senior running back, scored twice in the first quarter on runs of 16 yards and 3 yards. There were times when the Cardinal defense shut down one of the top running backs in the state. On back-to-back plays Duncan Lee and Andrew Weiland, both seniors, caught Henry in the Little Dutch backfield for losses. \n“When you stack the box like that, Noah (Clayberg, Pella’s senior quarterback) is going to recognize it. They have four outstanding receivers and they had to throw the ball to move it and score,” Ergenbright said. “Noah can beat you throwing the ball and with his legs.” \nNewton trailed 41-0 at halftime, which triggered the continuous running clock in the second half per 35-point margin rule. Pella scored a touchdown in the third quarter to go up 47-0. \nThe Cardinals kept battling. \nNewton set up shop on its 28-yard line and drove 68 yards behind the running of seniors Joseph Banfield and Dalton Nevels. Banfield made two big runs on fourth downs to keep the drive alive — the second one put the Cardinals at the Pella 10-yard line. \nThe Little Dutch defense stiffened. Banfield pushed hard on fourth-and-goal at the five, but was tackled at the 3-yard line. \nNewton’s defense kept the Little Dutch pinned deep and forced a punt, which was partially blocked. The Cardinals took possession of the football at the Pella 29-yard line with four minutes remaining in the game. \nBanfield ripped off a 12-yard gain, and Nevels added three more. Banfield busted loose to the 3-yard line. Banfield lost a yard on first down, gained three on the next run and it set up a third-and-goal at the Pella 1-yard line with the clock running. \nBanfield finished the drive with a 1-yard run into the end zone with 1:07 left. Josh Gulling kicked the extra point. \n“We had a couple of series where we ran downhill on them. They are so active and athletic on defense,” Ergenbright said. “They are an elite team on both sides of the football.” \nNewton’s first three possessions of the game were each three plays and a punt. The Cardinals blocked an extra-point kick and faced a 20-0 deficit with 48 seconds remaining in the first quarter. \nOn the ensuing kickoff, Nevels returned the football to the Newton 46-yard line. The Cardinals moved the football to the Pella 33. They decided to go for it on a fourth-and-10 and quarterback Garrett Sturtz was sacked for a loss of six yards. \nAlso in the second quarter, Newton had offensive possessions of five plays, and three plays — each ended in a punt. \nPella scored on its six possessions in the first half and the opening drive of the second half. \nThe Cardinal defense made the Little Dutch make drives of seven plays, eight plays, six plays and 11 plays to score. Henry scored back-to-back touchdowns on runs of 25 yards and 3 yards, but finished with 50 yards on 10 carries for Pella. \nClayberg rushed four times for 50 yards and two touchdowns. His first score was on a fourth-and-goal at the 4-yard line then he got 41 yards on a touchdown run in the second quarter. \nClayberg was 12-for-12 for 201 yards passing while Nick Finney was 4-for-4 for 44 yards and two touchdown passes of 48 yards to Donovan Holterhaus and 13 yards to Jackson Scholten in these second quarter. Finney scored on a 1-yard run in the third quarter. \n“I was impressed with the way our kids stopped Nathan Henry. There was not a lot of room for him to run,” Ergenbright said. “We have not stopped the run lately, so when we got a few of our guys back in there, we did a better job defensively. Now they know they can stop a good back. We need to take that to Bondurant-Farrar with us next week.” \nBanfield finished with 116 yards on 28 carries. Sturtz only attempted one pass, and it was incomplete. Sturtz was busy punting five times for Newton for 133 yards, which was a 27-yard average. \nLee led the Cardinal defense with eight unassisted tackles and one assisted tackle. Reese Rosenquist had six solo tackles. \nNevels and Jace Lukefahr each had three solo tackles and two assisted tackles. Clay Hansen had three solo tackles. Bryce Tish made two unassisted tackles and four assisted tackles. \nNewton lost the services of senior linebacker Austin James early in the first quarter. James left with an injury. \nNewton (0-7) goes to Bondurant Friday to take on Bondurant-Farrar in Class 3A District 6 play. \nNewton 0-0-0-7—7 \nPella — Henry 25 yd run (Warner kick) \nPella — Henry 3 yd run (Warner kick) \nPella — Clayberg 4 yd run (kick blocked) \nPella — Clayberg 41 yd run (Warner pass from Clayberg) \nPella — Holterhaus 48 yd pass from Finney (Warner kick) \nPella — Scholten 13 yd pass from Finney (kick failed) \nPella — Finney 1 yd run (kick failed) \nNewton — Banfield 1 yd run (Gulling kick) \nNewton Pella", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T19:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T02:35:12.866+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
