In four years at Molloy HS, Russ Smith proved to be one of the city's most potent scorers. As a senior last winter, the 6-1 guard averaged 29.6 points per game.\nNext year, Smith will take that scoring mentality to Louisville . Smith, who is currently doing a year of prep school at South Kent Prep in Connecticut , plans to verbally commit to the Big East school when he visits the campus next weekend, the Daily News has learned. He plans to sign a letter of intent the following week.\n\"Russ made the decision,\" said Smith's father, Russ Sr. \"There were some other schools, but Russ really liked Louisville.\"\nSmith drew interest from a handful of schools last season, and he had scholarship offers as a senior at Molloy, his father said.\nBut he chose to postpone college and attend South Kent this year, hoping to add size and strength to his spindly, 160-pound frame.\nThis year, he drew heavy interest from such programs as Houston , La Salle, Baylor and Arizona .\n\"Baylor was coming pretty hard,\" Russ Sr. said. \"La Salle was on board pretty hard, too.\"\nBut Louisville coach Rick Pitino watched Smith at South Kent about a month ago, Russ Sr. said, and that's when the Cardinals' courtship began.\n\"Rick came out, and he told me he always liked Russ, ever since he went to Louisville's camp like five or six years ago,\" Russ Sr. said. \"Rick, he pretty much watched Russ over the years. He couldn't believe how much better he'd gotten in every aspect.\"\nFor Smith, the Cardinals were also a good fit. Pitino is a Big Apple product, and he's worked with a string of city players, including Rice HS product Edgar Sosa , center Samardo Samuels , who is from Queens, and Bronx product Francisco Garcia , who now plays for the Sacramento Kings .\nSmith also fills a void at Louisville. The Cardinals will graduate guards Edgar Sosa, Jerry Smith and Reginald Delk after this season, meaning Smith could see playing time right away, Russ Sr. said.\n\"They're losing guards this year,\" he said. \"They needed a combo guard to come in and play right away. I guess after really watching Russ, they put it together.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T10:45:49.664+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
