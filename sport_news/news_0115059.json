(Poll) 01:52 PM - October 23, 2015 by MMChrisS Sports game franchise modes are still the bread and butter of our genre (in our opinion) -- but there are some aspects where each game tends to continually fall short. To spur on a healthy discussion, what do you think is the most important thing for sports games to get right in their franchise modes in the future? Sound off by voting in our poll and leave a comment on what items you think need to be added, especially if you selected other! Member Comments # 1 Jadakiss88 @ 10/23/15 02:25 PM As hard as it is I want what's in the game in the game. I'm not even talking about the rare one handed OBJ catch (that definitely needs to be tweaked...love the catch system but that Aggressive can be over powered). Like I stated on the \"Dynamic Goal and Confidence thread\" I want realism. NCAA Football years ago included the Student Athlete concept into the game and it was awesome....even though the biggest complaint was suspensions seemed random. I would also like to see a more player involved off-season with workouts being dictated and scheduled by the player. That just a few things. # 2 cowboys22bulls23 @ 10/23/15 02:28 PM Single season mode and playoffs for all sports games madden the show nba 2k and nhl. And roster carry over from game to game. # 3 cch99 @ 10/23/15 02:37 PM What I'd like to see is more things that make your Franchise feel like it's a bigger world and not just about your team. Highlights of other games during. Weekly wrap-up shows. Playoff Preview shows, etc. The 2 best at this \"recently\" for me have been. College Hoops 2k8 with the weekly wrap-up and the selection show. And NCAA Football 2014?. The one with the cut aways to scores around the NCAA and also the SI covers. I loved that. I also liked the weekly show on NFL 2k5 and the Old Madden's when they had Bruno were cool with the radio show. That's the biggest thing for me is making it feel like a real league. Madden is ok with Twitter stuff and the screens but it's too little. Why can't loading screens have big games that are happening that week/day too.
