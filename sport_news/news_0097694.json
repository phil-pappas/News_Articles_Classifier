I just don't like that.\n\"I'm not a big fan of him.\"\nHolland, who is not the first Ranger to call out Bautista , also critiqued the slugger's sometimes dramatic body language in the outfield.\n\"He's most animated player I've ever seen. After watching him in the outfield cry about every single thing, it's unbelievable.\" he said of the Jays right fielder, whose team faces playoff elimination Wednesday, down 3-1 to the Kansas City Royals in the ALCS.\nBautista's emphatic bat flip in Game 5 of the ALDS — you know, the one played on loop across the continent for 24 hours following the Jays' 6-3 victory last week — ticked off Holland.\nThe #BatFlip that broke the INTERNETS. https://t.co/zqSUFF5APG\n— MLB (@MLB) October 15, 2015 \"I don't care if he hits a home run off me, that's fine, I give up home runs, I've struck people out, I do all that stuff, it's how baseball goes,\" Holland explained.\n\"But the way you do it — is he better than the game? Yeah, you lived in the moment, that's great. You hit a home run? Yeah, you can pimp it. That's fine. But the way he did it, I just think that one — that's a bit much.\n\"That's cool if you want to stare at the pitcher, because obviously the pitcher made the mistake. If it's me, I made the mistake; you hit the home run? Cool, stare at me. I'm going to be the one that's not actually staring at you, I'm going to watch and see how far you just hit it because that's how I am. I like to punish myself by seeing that. But the way he did it, I don't like it at all.\n\"I mean, personally, I don't like him, either. Especially after seeing more about him during the game, and being out in the outfield and seeing how he complains about every single thing.\"\nHolland, a 29-year-old left-hander, started Game 4 against the Jays. He lasted only two innings, giving up six earned runs on five hits, including three home runs.\nPoll Was Jose Bautista's bat flip in Game 5 a sign of disrespect?
