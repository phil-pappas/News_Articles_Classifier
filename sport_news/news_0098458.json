He also snuck for another one from a yard out.\nBrady said the Cowboys have a \"good front\" with \"good team speed,\" and blamed the sacks on himself, saying he was \"probably holding it too long.\"\nAs for the unexpected defensive alignment that Bill Belichick referred to moments earlier, Brady said, \"Can't practice everything. We'll make the adjustments and hopefully be better next week.\"\nLike Belichick, he praised running back Dion Lewis, but cautioned that the team has only played four games.\n\"He's made a huge impact on our team,\" Brady said. \"He's just been an amazing player ... but it's still a long season.\"\nBrady kept his comments short after his team moved to 4-0 with a rematch of last season's AFC title game looming next Sunday night in Indianapolis.\n\"I'm glad we got the win,\" he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T05:14:36.140+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
