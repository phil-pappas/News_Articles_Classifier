Guy McCarthy / Union Democrat, Copyright 2015. The past three weeks have turned lives upside down in Amador and Calaveras counties. From ranches high above the North Fork Mokelumne River to ridgetop and canyon neighborhoods between Mokelumne Hill and Rail Road Flat, to Jesus Maria, Mountain Ranch and Sheep Ranch, out to Sierra Ridge Academy off Fricot City Road, people who used to live there and people who still do are confronting a changed world. The Butte Fire that broke out Sept. 9 and ravaged 110.7 square miles of watersheds, killed two men in neighborhoods under mandatory evacuations, and destroyed 818 structures including 475 homes, was said to be 96 percent contained as of Wednesday. Here are a few snapshots of life in and near the burned zone, where many people are living in campers and trailers next to burned ruins, and a massive cleanup was expected to begin Wednesday starting in Jesus Maria. Help for ranchers Amy Rocha, a district conservationist with the federal Natural Resources Conservation Service based in Jackson, has been distributing information for ranchers impacted by the Butte Fire. She’s been at community meetings this week in Mountain Ranch and San Andreas. Rocha wants to contact anyone who lost livestock, feed, grazing land or fences in the blaze. The federal Farm Service Agency has funding and technical assistance for ranchers and farmers who need to rehabilitate their lands damaged by the Butte Fire, especially those on or adjacent to steep ground particularly vulnerable to potential post-fire flooding and debris flows. “All of the above, that’s us,” Aileen Charamuga said Tuesday at Charamuga Ranch, where she and her husband of 65 years, Bill, believe the Butte Fire ignited under a power line that crosses their property. “That’s very important to us.” The Charamugas keep cows, goats and horses on their 168-acre ranch, which bears scars of the Butte Fire as it worked its way south into the steep Mokelumne River drainage. “Bill told me this morning he’s going to rake up all the acorns he can find and throw them down into the fire area to see if they’ll take hold,” Aileen Charamuga said. “That’s how much he loves this ranch.” The Charamugas know about a meeting scheduled from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. Oct. 14 at the Calaveras County Library, 1299 Gold Hunter Road in San Andreas. Rocha says cost-share assistance is available for ranchers who want to replant trees, reseed rangeland, control brush and implement erosion control measures. Emergency watershed protection People at the Natural Resources Conservation Service are touting an emergency watershed protection program to mitigate potential hazards to life and property resulting from the fires. “It is work we can do with a local sponsor to help a damaged watershed channel water and mitigate erosion so that lives and property are protected and additional hardships are not heaped upon the devastated community,” says Carlos Suarez, a conservationist with NRCS. With the high potential for winter rains, burned areas are at greater risk for post-fire erosion and debris flows, federal officials say. The emergency watershed protection program requires local governments and other entities to sponsor erosion protection efforts including concrete barriers and debris basins, mulching, straw wattles and other damage-control measures, according to the Natural Resources Conservation Service. Potential sponsors are urged to contact NRCS for more information. Other programs can provide long-term support to repair livestock fencing, remove dead or dying trees, clear dense brush, install new livestock water facilities and other agricultural services. For more information, call the Farm Service Agency at 472-7127 or the Natural Resources Conservation Service office at 223-6535. Cleanup commencing Hazardous waste and ash from structures destroyed by the Butte Fire is supposed to be going to Forward Landfill in Stockton, says Jason Boetzer, Calaveras County’s environmental health director. Cleanup was expected to begin Wednesday in Jesus Maria and on the south side of the burn area. Calaveras County landfill is not accepting burned debris, hazardous materials or ash from the blaze. The Calaveras County Environmental Management Agency is initiating efforts with the CalRecycle-Calaveras County Butte Fire Debris Removal Project. They are sending in teams from the Department of Toxic Substances Control to remove household hazardous waste. Teams will also do asbestos assessment and sampling from all residential properties in areas affected by the Butte Fire. Work was expected to progress from the west section of Jesus Maria Road to the south section of Mountain Ranch Road. A primary focus is removing household hazardous wastes like paints, batteries, electronic wastes and propane tanks under 30 gallons. When that preliminary work is done, more teams will start removing debris and ash from sites where owners have signed up with the CalRecycle-Calaveras County Butte Fire Debris Removal Project. For more information, or if you do not want Department of Toxic Substances Control workers on your property, call Calaveras County Environmental Health at 754-6399. Recalling Moke Hill Judy Hurley, a resident of Cave City, recalled the first day she saw how big the Butte Fire was getting. “We helped an elderly friend in Moke Hill, to pack his stuff and bring him to our place,” Hurley said Monday before a community meeting in Mountain Ranch. “The fire kept getting worse and worse, and then the bombers came in dropping retardant. We could see the pilots’ faces. That DC-10 shook his house.” Then the fire kept marching south through Mountain Ranch and approaching Cave City, too. The Hurley home survived the fire. Mackenzie Dwight, of Mountain Ranch, says her parents’ home survived the Butte Fire. Barely. “It’s like a bubble around the house,” Dwight said Monday. “The firefighters forcibly evacuated me, but they didn’t do anything to save the house. We had some brush clearance. I don’t know if it was a miracle or an act of nature. “I did see the CDC, the convict crews, they did a lot of work,” Dwight said. “They had dirty uniforms. I’m not trying to say the firefighters didn’t do much. They’re doing more now.” Lost home and 35 years of astrophotography Terry and Delories Stiner have lived about 12 years on El Dorado Trail, and they lost their home and about 35 years of astrophotography, including digital and film images as well as the digital backups, Terry Stiner said. “I saved my baby, a 10-inch Schmidt-Cassegrain telescope,” Terry Stiner said. “We lost the place and all the photos but, all things considered, we’re doing OK. We got evacuated, and the official date the county tells us our place was destroyed was 9-11.” Terry Stiner said his attitude boils down to, “We’ve just got to start over again. We’re staying in a little travel trailer at our place for a few days. People who lost their home in the Old Gulch Fire gave us the trailer. Things could be better, but we’re doing the next best thing.” The house and all its contents were just stuff, Terry Stiner said. “We’re alive and well,” he said. “I’m not sorry for myself or our place, I’m grieving for the land. But it will come back. Nature has a way.” Follow UnionDemocrat.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T04:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T07:18:35.443+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
