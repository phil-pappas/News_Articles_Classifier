We were just too tired from playing defense the whole game, so we were not going to get that many people up, but it was worth it, because it allowed us to stay in position.\" \nThe second half into the two 10-minute overtime periods featured much of the same. Pick a Broadneck player — Kayla Harris, Amanda Schweitzer, etc. and there was a chance they took a shot that Single had to stop. She made a key initial save with just over 14 minutes left in regulation, and adroitly deflected away a follow-up by Harris. \n\"Abby is the anchor of our team on that back line,\" Carrier said. \"When we get tired, she is the one who carries the team and we can be confident that, if we make a mistake, she has our back.\" \nThe Patriots are undefeated in their last seven games, including five wins, while allowing just four goals during that span. \n\"I am very proud of this team,\" Schulte said. \"We knew coming in this would be hard and our mindset was to get the win or be tied, and that is what we did.\" \nOld Mill has experiences a major turnaround from last season, when they posted just two wins. Single credits last year's experience as motivation for her senior year. \n\"Starting off as a sophomore and getting to the point now where we are able to play with a team like Broadneck is a constant reminder of where we were last season and how we have grown as a team this year,\" Single said. \"After a game like this, we are definitely having good thoughts about what we can do during the playoff season.\" \nCamm feels really good about this squad, which features a strong mix of players in all four classes. \n\"It has been one of the most enjoyable seasons I have had coaching, period,\" Camm said. \"The are focused and committed to being excellent in everything they do, and hopefully there are some bigger things in front of us.\" \nFor Small, who leads the Bruins with nine assists and features a deadly free kick and long-range throw-in, a great regular season is simply paving the way for the possibility of a great postseason. \n\"We came in with the same goal and the same mentality as always, and we have worked really well together,\" Small said. \"I am pumped for the rest of our season!\" \nOld Mill (7-4-2)0000-0Broadneck (11-0-3)0000-0 \nSAVES: OM — Single 18; BN — Dawson 3.
