Kristyna Wentz-Graff / Staff Allan Brettman | The Oregonian/OregonLive Kurt Widmer, a pioneer in craft brewing's renaissance in Portland and the United States, announced Monday he is retiring.\nWidmer, co-founder with brother Rob Widmer of Widmer Brothers Brewing, announced today he will retire from Craft Brew Alliance and will be leaving CBA's Board of Directors at the end of the year.\nUpon retirement, Widmer, 63, will take the honorary title of Chairman Emeritus.\nWidmer has served as Craft Brew Alliance board chairman since it was formed in 2008 through the merger of Redhook Brewery and Widmer Brothers Brewing. Previously, Widmer was president, chief executive and board chairman for Widmer Brothers Brewing Co. from 1984 until 2008.\n\"Since my brother Rob and I founded Widmer Brothers Brewing over 31 years ago, this extraordinary industry that we helped create has grown and evolved in ways I couldn't even imagine,\" Kurt Widmer said in a news release. \"Many of us who set the foundation for today's booming craft beer market are thinking about the next chapter in our lives, and my wife Ann and I have been discussing the fact that there's still a lot we want to do. So while I'll miss walking into my office at the brewery every day, I'm admittedly looking forward to more time with my family and doing more of what I love to do â€“ whether it's traveling around the world or home brewing in the basement.\"\nKurt and Rob Widmer co-founded Widmer Brothers Brewing in Portland, Oregon in 1984 with help from their father Ray, the news release said. Two years later, they created Hefe, an American-style Hefeweizen, which became the top-selling craft beer in Oregon.\nCraft Brew Alliance includes three of the earliest contemporary craft brewers: Redhook Ale Brewery, Washington's largest craft brewery founded in 1981; Widmer; and Kona Brewing Co., Hawaii's oldest and largest craft brewery founded in 1994. Alliance beer is distributed in all 50 states and 15 international markets.\nCraft Brew Alliance is publicly traded on Nasdaq and is headquartered in Portland.\n--Allan Brettman\nabrettman@oregonian.com\n503-294-5900\n@ allanbrettman", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/allanbrettman"], "published": "2015-10-13T00:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T04:19:23.776+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
