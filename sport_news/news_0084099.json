Davie Holliday had rushed for two touchdowns of 46 and 11 yards, one in the second quarter and another in the fourth period.\"In the locker room at halftime, we made some adjustments and didn't fear that name (Ansonia) in front of their shirts,\" said Langenheim. \"We wanted to proved that we belonged. Chuck Usher, our outside linebacker, willed us to win in the locker room. Davie Holliday was unbelievable his whole career. There was no quit in that kid. He was very determined.\"Holliday helped get the Red Raiders back in the game, outdueling Ansonia's Fran Hendricks (166 yards on 38 carries, one TD). Ansonia quarterback James Lane ran for two others for the Chargers. Langenheim had plenty of praise for Ansonia.\"When you talk high school football in Connecticut, you start with Ansonia,\" said Langenheim. \"You have to give credit where credit is due. Pop Shortell, Bill McAllister and Jack Hunt created a winning environment.\"Even after outlasting Watertown, 49-43, a week later on Thanksgiving, Torrington didn't qualify for the postseason, despite compiling a 10-1 regular season record, 11-1 overall.\"We felt like we had some unfinished business,\" he said. \"We felt that we could play with anyone in the state.\"That season seems like yesterday for me. We had a senior-heavy team and we just got better and better. We went 2-9 as sophomores and 6-5 as juniors and were given an opportunity to play.\"Langenheim, who later played at Syracuse University and was a member of several bowl games with the Orange, had a most memorable game against Watertown in his final game, catching 11 passes for 136 yards and a TD.\"It was a pretty satisfying ending because we hadn't played well the previous two years against Watertown,\" said Langenheim. \nFollow Us", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T09:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T03:34:58.146+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
