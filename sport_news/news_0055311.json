Dropped passes happen. Poor throws happen. But the basic miscommunications that have also become a weekly part of the Eagles offense should be preventable. \n\"It's not one specific thing. It's not always the same thing,\" Chip Kelly said. \"So, it's not just: 'Hey, this happened, so let's correct it.' At one point in time, it's the receiver, and at the other point in time, we didn't get it communicated. So, it's a group of guys, and we've got to get it straightened out.\" \nKelly has had the group together working on this very thing for quite a while, on getting the proper, no-huddle, wigwag signals from the sideline, on making the same post-snap determinations about how the play develops depending on what the defense is doing. This is a classroom with the same students that has been in session since the spring. \n\"Yeah, we know that,\" Kelly said. \nFine. Then why does Darren Sproles turn his sideline route into a wheel route at the very moment Bradford throws for the sideline, and why does Cooper adjust his pattern in a way the quarterback didn't expect? Those are reasonable questions, and they are being asked after every game. \nThe answer probably has something to do with how Kelly wants his offense to operate, which is very fast and with a lot of decisions made after the play begins. When the coach says, \"We didn't get it communicated,\" that's an indication that the coach/player interface occasionally breaks down, either during practice or in the transmission of signals from the sideline. \nMaybe it would help to just slow things down a little. Go completely wild and huddle up now and then. The coaches don't think the mechanics of the system are an issue, of course, but that's not a surprise. \n\"They both fell victim to not doing the right thing properly, and I'll just leave it at that,\" offensive coordinator Pat Shurmur said of the mixup between Bradford and Cooper. \"But I don't think it was anything coming from the sideline, or not knowing what the play was. We were running apple, and they all knew it was apple. They just didn't execute it the right way.\" \nIf not that, then the multitude of options contained within every play could lead to the confusion. The guiding philosophy of Kelly's offense is to not make final decisions at the line, because the defense is trying to hide its intentions. Once the ball is snapped, then the truth can be determined and the best option selected. The problem arises when two players see the same thing and make different decisions. \nThe Eagles have plays that are \"locked.\" The running back hits this hole and no other. The No. 1 receiver runs this exact route and no other. The secondary receiver will be right here, no matter what. That cuts down on flexibility, but it also lessens the likelihood of throwing the football into an empty swath of grass, or worse. \nGetting a bit simpler might work. It's worth a try. The game is pitch and catch, after all, and having a brilliant scheme loses its luster when the result is a quarterback who could use some help, but who is getting exactly the opposite instead.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T23:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T23:56:09.664+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
