And recently the parish even sued some Uber drivers, this after months ago issuing a cease and desist letter to Uber.\n\"Seeking to have Uber .. the individual drivers named to stop performing services in Jefferson Parish,” Foshee stated.\nAnd the parish attorney thinks it is time that the state attorney general gets involved as it relates to the rules for Uber.\n\"Let the attorney general weigh in on whether or not statewide transportation networks such as Uber are required to have cars with commercial drivers' licenses, and 'for hire' plates and the other regulations,” said Foshee.\nCabdrivers demanded that the parish block the Uber app from working in Jefferson.\n\"I'm requesting the parish officials to shut the Uber app until they get some regulations,” said Gunesakara.\nBut Foshee stated that it would take a court order to make that happen.\nCopyright 2015 WVUE .
