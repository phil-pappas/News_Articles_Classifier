A luxury stretch limousine used to transfer a group of asylum seekers in Britain has been slammed as “totally inappropriate” by authorities.\nThe seven men were driven from London to Manchester in a 16-seat Hummer, angering many who considered it to be a waste of money.\nThe vehicle was hired by Serco, the company that the British government use to help with the transportation of people seeking asylum in the country.\nNow, Serco has apologized after public uproar about the decision to hire the $75,000 vehicle for the journey.\nIn a statement, a spokesperson for the Home Office said: “Our contractors are responsible for arranging the transport of asylum seekers and bear the cost of doing so. However, this incident was totally inappropriate and Serco has apologised. The terms of our contract with Serco requires them to take all reasonable steps to ensure transport is appropriate.”\nGoogle The driver said he was being paid approximately $4,600 to drive the men. The Home Office said they had contacted the company to express their “strong disapproval” about the decision.\nPictures showed the vehicle in the village of Longford, near Heathrow Airport, where a hotel has been using houses to provide temporary accommodation for asylum seekers.\nRana Saif, who lives nearby, said the driver of the limo told him he was being paid $4,600 to drive the men on the eight-hour round trip, according to Mirror Online .\nlhanna@nydailynews.com\nRelated Stories Truck driver who killed 2 has murder conviction reduced Uber drivers to receive Amber alerts under new partnership Brit jailed after chasing cops at 120mph and filming rant", "external_links": ["http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/asylum-seekers-transported-luxury-50000-6629927"], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T15:53:41.918+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
