The weekly notebook will cover cross country, field hockey, golf, soccer, tennis and volleyball, and will consist of storylines from the previous seven days. Today’s notebook will reflect back on all the happenings from last Wednesday up through this past Tuesday. Times News sports writer Jason Boris will once again be handling the compilation of notes and is encouraging all local coaches to email him with noteworthy information that can be used in this column. Emails can be sent to jboris@tnonline.com . \nCROSS COUNTRY \nWHAT A RUN — With Colonial League victories over Moravian Academy, Notre Dame of Green Pond, Palisades and Saucon Valley on Tuesday afternoon, the Northwestern girls cross country team put a feather in their cap by finishing undefeated (24-0) in the regular season for the fifth straight year. The wins extended Northwestern’s dual meet winning streak to 126 races. The last time the Lady Tigers suffered a cross country loss was back on October 13, 2010, when Notre Dame of Green Pond defeated Northwestern by a final score of 26-29. \nSOCCER \nA SIX PACK — Palmerton’s Devon Santos tallied six goals to lead his team to a 10-3 victory over Tamaqua last Thursday.

In its 17th year as a varsity sport, the Tamaqua girls soccer program currently has 191 wins. \n“W” FOR WEATHERLY — In a battle of two teams in search of their first win, the Weatherly girls soccer team tasted victory for the first time this season on Saturday with a 1-0 win over North Schuylkill. Lynea Reiner scored off a feed from Christina Caravella in the first half and Shannon Frye stopped 13 shots on goal to preserve the shutout. The Lady Wreckers entered the game 0-14-1, while North Schuylkill remains winless at 0-17. \nKEEPING RECORDS — With a 2-0 Eastern Pennsylvania Conference victory over East Stroudsburg North on Monday, Pleasant Valley boys soccer goal keeper Brad Brickman posted his 23rd career shutout, which broke the school record for most career shutouts. The previous record of 22 was held by Nick Konawalik (1993-1996) and Bobby Pipech (1999-2001). Konawalik and Pipech both ended up playing NCAA Division I soccer. Konawalik was a former University of Delaware goal keeper, while Pipech was a former Saint Francis University goal keeper and is the current boys soccer head coach at Pen Argyl. \nTRIPLE DIGITS —Palmerton’s Monica Wood has been a scoring machine all season long, and her four goals against Pen Argyl on Tuesday allowed her to eclipse the century mark for career goals. Heading into the last week of the regular season, Wood has scored 103 goals over the course of her scholastic career. \nVOLLEYBALL \nMOVIN’ ON UP — With 19 kills on 39 attacks in Tuesday night’s 3-0 sweep of Pine Grove, Marian senior middle hitter Abby Stankiewitch eclipsed the 800-kill mark for her career. With 804 career kills, Stankiewitch is only the fifth Marian player in the history of the storied program to exceed 800 kills in a career. \nDIGGIN’ IT — A few weeks ago, Panther Valley’s Jamey Mikovich topped the 600-kill mark for her career. Last night against North Schuylkill, the senior middle hitter recorded her 500th career dig. Mikovich has verbally committed to play volleyball at Wilkes University next season. \nMAKING A POINT — Lehighton senior Alyssa Jordan recorded her 600th career point in Tuesday’s five-game victory against Pottsville. Jordan, who is second on the team in kills this season, finished the match with two aces, 13 kills and 12 digs. Statistically speaking, “total points” in volleyball is calculated by adding kills, blocks and service aces. \nHAT TRICKS \nGOALS, GOALS, GOALS — Ten more area athletes turned in “hat tricks” this week (eight soccer and two field hockey). In soccer, Palmerton’s Devon Santos booted in six goals against Tamaqua, which ties an area high. Speaking of Tamaqua, the Blue Raiders tallied three separate hat tricks this past week. Robert Stidham and Lynn Kistler both tallied four goals apiece against North Schuylkill and Lehighton respectively, while Tyler Hollenbach added three goals of his own against Palmerton. In addition, Palmerton’s Monica Wood and Lehighton’s Joe Marks had four goals apiece in Tuesday’s action, while Jim Thorpe’s Rebecca Cressman and Lehighton’s Morgan Yurasits both recorded three-goal games. In field hockey, Northern Lehigh’s Cheyenne Mazzocca and Pleasant Valley’s Meara Hanyon both scored three goals apiece in leading their teams to victories. \nDISTRICT 11 TOURNAMENTS \nMORE TICKETS PUNCHED — This past week, three more teams qualified for the District 11 playoffs. With a 3-0 sweep of Jim Thorpe last Thursday, the Lehighton Volleyball team (11-6) earned its tenth win of the season to advance to the Class AA tournament. The Lady Indians will join former Mountain Valley Conference rival Pleasant Valley (10-4), who earned a berth this past week in the Class AAA volleyball field. In addition, the Tamaqua tennis team received the eighth and final spot in the Class AA bracket. Unlike other sports, which require District qualifiers to finish with a .500 or above record, tennis advances the top eight teams in the District 11 Power Ratings. Therefore, while the Lady Raiders sport just a 6-9 overall record, their 0.439 power rating earns them a date with undefeated Bethlehem Catholic (17-0) on October 20 in the District 11 quarterfinals. Other Times News area teams already clinching District 11 playoff berths include: Marian golf, Pleasant Valley boys soccer, Northwestern boys soccer, Lehighton boys soccer, Pleasant Valley girls soccer, Northwestern girls soccer, Panther Valley volleyball and Marian volleyball.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T23:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T22:06:28.183+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
