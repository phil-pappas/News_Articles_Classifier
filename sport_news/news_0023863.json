The end of the first quarter was marred by three straight turnovers — two fumbles by the Cyclones and one by Brentsville — in less than a minute, and a host of penalties. After Brentsville's punter dropped to his knee in the end zone to give the Cyclones (5-2) a 9-0 lead, things got rolling for Eastern View after a kickoff return by Kaden Woodward put the ball on Brentsville's 43-yard line. Six plays later, Justin Pollard found the end zone from six yards out for a 16-0 lead with 3:10 left in the half. One minute and six seconds later, D'Ago Hunter made a leaping, one-handed interception at the Tigers' 35 and ran down the sideline, untouched, to the end zone for a 23-0 lead with 2:16 left in the half. That lead stood at halftime. \"That was huge for us,\" Eastern View head coach Greg Hatfield said. \"He did a great job of baiting the quarterback, made a break on the ball and made a big play for us.\" Penalties continued to be the theme of the night. Eastern View had three long touchdowns called back in the third quarter — two on passes of more than 50 yards to Zach Thomas — and was flagged 19 times for 142 yards. Brentsville was penalized 12 times for 70 yards. The Cyclones' offense got rolling again in the second half, though, as quarterback Josh Stallings found Hunter on an option pitch that went 15 yards, and set up Hunter's four-yard touchdown sweep that put Eastern View up, 30-0, in the third quarter. Now healthy, Hunter and Pollard looked like themselves again Friday, Hatfield said. Pollard had 109 rushing yards by halftime, and finished with 165. \"Justin is starting to look healthy,\" Hatfield said. \"He did a great job today running with power, but running patient and waiting for his blocks.\" Brentsville scored its only points of the night on a fake punt in the third quarter that Donovan Hollins took 54 yards for a touchdown. Otherwise, the Tigers' offense was nonexistent. The Cyclones held Brentsville (5-2) to negative-six rushing yards in the first half, and only gave up just 78 yards of total offense. \"The defense did a great job of playing assignment football,\" Hatfield said. \"They were aggressive, and never gave Brentsville a chance to get comfortable.\" The Cyclones wasted little time cruising 72 yards on five plays on their opening possession that was capped by a 16-yard touchdown run by Stallings. A 37-yard scamper by Pollard set up the first quarter’s only touchdown. Eastern View hosts Liberty next Friday.
