(Frank Gunn/The Canadian Press via AP) MANDATORY CREDIT \nThe latest on the World Series, which opens Tuesday night with the Kansas City Royals hosting the New York Mets (all times local): \n5:41 p.m. \nKelly Johnson will be the Mets' designated hitter in the World Series opener. \nAcquired from Atlanta on July 24, Johnson hit .250 with five homers and 13 RBIs for New York. He is 1 for 6 in the postseason. \nJohnson is 4 for 14 (,286) with two RBIs against Kansas City's Game 1 starter, Edinson Volquez. \n\"If (Johnny) Cueto was starting, we were looking at perhaps somebody else, because his numbers against lefties are pretty good,\" Collins said. \"We thought tomorrow night that Kelly gave us our best opportunity.\" \n4:32 p.m. \nOutfielder Curtis Granderson has a jammed thumb, but the Mets said he will play in the World Series opener. \nThe Mets posted a photo on their Facebook page Sunday of Granderson with a thumb wrapped as he boarded the team bus ahead of the trip to Kansas City. \n\"He jammed his thumb in Chicago on a slide,\" Mets manager Terry Collins said Monday. \"He played the next day. He was fine. He's taken batting practice. He's fine. To relive all — you put him in a little protective wrap that — it's not a sling. He's going to play. He's in there.\" \nCollins did not seem pleased news of the knock became public. \n\"Anything else you want the rest of the league to know about us, just let us know,\" he said. \n2:35 p.m. \nSeveral members of the Royals were guests of the Kansas City Chiefs on Sunday, watching their cross-the-parking lot neighbors beat the Pittsburgh Steelers to snap a five-game skid. \nOn Monday, Chiefs coach Andy Reid offered his encouragement on the eve of the World Series. \n\"I look forward to seeing them kick this thing off here in a couple days, I guess tomorrow, right?\" Reid said, apparently unaware that kicking off is, well, a football term. \nThe Royals play the New York Mets in Game 1 on Tuesday night. \nReid and the Chiefs have become close with the Royals over the past couple years, often dropping in on each other's practices. Reid even stopped by to see manager Ned Yost — or as he calls him, \"Skipper Yost\" — when the Royals were in spring training. \n1:30 p.m. \nEdinson Volquez will start the World Series opener for Kansas City, followed by Johnny Cueto in Game 2. \nRoyals players said Monday that Yordano Ventura will start Game 3 at Citi Field on Friday, followed by Chris Young in Game 4. \nNew York's rotation opens with Matt Harvey, and Jacob deGrom, Noah Syndergaard and Steven Matz follow. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T23:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T23:49:22.054+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
