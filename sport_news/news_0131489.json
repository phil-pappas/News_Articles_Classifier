After taking two games on the road, they’ve won the chance for a winner-take-all finale in Toronto.\n“It’s going to be nuts,” Jays’ catcher Russell Martin said. “I love it. It’s going to be awesome.”\nHere are five key moments from the Jays’ big win in Game 4.\nDonaldson homers in first\nThe Jays jumped all over Rangers starter Derek Holland in the early going on Monday night, taking a 3-0 lead in the first inning. The opening rally was keyed, as usual, by Josh Donaldson, who hit his second homer of the post-season in his first at-bat — an opposite-field fly over the wall in Globe Life Park’s shallower right field. Donaldson led the majors this season with 15 first-inning homers and his two playoff dingers have also come in the opening frame. “When you’re facing elimination,” John Gibbons said, “you take the lead and it makes it easier.”\nDickey throws up a zero\nHolding the opposition after your team scores — the proverbial shutdown inning — is always important, but paramount in the post-season. After the Jays took a 3-0 lead in the first, R.A. Dickey allowed back-to-back singles to Shin-Soo Choo and Adrian Beltre, bringing the tying run to the plate. Both David Price and Marcus Stroman started warming up in the bullpen. Things got tense. While Dickey bent, he didn’t break, inducing a lazy fly from Prince Fielder and an infield pop-up from Mitch Moreland — the Rangers’ two biggest home-run threats — to strand the runners.\nPrice nabs a souvenir\nWith David Price loosening up in the Jays’ bullpen in the second inning, he was in the right place at the right time as Kevin Pillar’s first career post-season homer was hit basically into his glove. As it turns out, Price predicted it. “I told him before the game, hit me a ball in the bullpen so I can catch it.” Price got the ball formally authenticated as a keepsake for Pillar. “I didn’t see him catch it,” Pillar said. “But when I went out (to centre field), he told me he had it and I was able to get it. It’s pretty special, my first post-season home run.”\nScore and score again\nAfter taking a 4-0 lead on a trio of homers in the first two innings, the Jays didn’t let up on Holland, tacking on three more runs in a third-inning rally, in which they passed the baton and sent eight batters to the plate. The Jays had three hits and two walks in the inning, which seemed to be just insurance at the time, but in the end turned out to be the difference in the game after the Rangers started to claw into the Jays’ lead.\nPrice in relief\nIt’s what everyone will be talking about in wait of Wednesday’s deciding Game 5. With a six-run lead, Gibbons called to the pen for his ace, David Price, using him up despite the winner-take-all series finale in sight. The Jays’ manager explained he was trying to stop a potential comeback before it started, plus he had no other left-handed pitchers available (with Brett Cecil injured and Aaron Loup dealing with a family matter). “It’s all about winning,” Gibbons said. If the Jays complete their comeback on Wednesday, all will be forgiven. Until then, let the debate begin.\nMore on thestar.com\nBlue Jays’ Gibbons defends early hook of Dickey in Game 4 of ALDS\nGibbons not building relationships, just a bridge to Game 5: Arthur", "external_links": ["http://static.freeskreen.com/publisher/52/freeskreen.min.js"], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T05:36:07.824+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
