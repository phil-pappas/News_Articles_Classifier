It’s serious but, at times, it’s all about the fun and obviously playing for the crowd, so I really enjoy that.” \nIn another coup for tournament director Paul Kilderry, women’s world No.1 Serena Williams, a dual winner of the Hopman Cup, has opted to return to Perth once again to launch her new season. \nThe six-times Australian Open champion will team up with Sock as the Americans start favourites to land a seventh Hopman Cup title. \n“Perth definitely started something quite amazing, so I think it’s only natural and fair and reasonable that I go back to Perth,” said Williams, who reached the 2015 final with John Isner. \n“We were so close to winning last year. I’m really excited to be back. For me, the Hopman Cup is super great preparation for the Australian Open.” \nOther leading women’s drawcards in 2016 include Germany’s former Wimbledon finalist Sabine Lisicki, French Open runner-up Lucie Safarova of the Czech Republic and Heather Watson partnering Murray for Great Britain. \n2015 HOPMAN CUP PAIRINGS: \n* Australia Gold: Lleyton Hewitt and Casey Dellacqua \n* Australia Green: Nick Kyrgios and TBA \n* USA: Jack Sock and Serena Williams \n* Great Britain: Andy Murray and Heather Watson \n* France: Gael Monfils and Caroline Garcia \n* Czech Republic: Jiri Veseley and Lucie Safarova \n* Germany: Alexander Zverev and Sabine Lisicki \n* Ukraine: Alexandr Dolgopolov and Elina Svitolina  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T08:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T10:42:53.348+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
