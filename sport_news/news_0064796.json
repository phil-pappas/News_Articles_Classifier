The Mets fan was punched and fell and hit his head on the concrete, causing the severity of the injury.\nThe attack draws a disturbing comparison to San Francisco Giants fan Bryan Stow, who suffered serious brain damage after he was beaten in a similar incident on Opening Day at Dodger Stadium in 2011.\nPolice authorities are searching for those involved. The victim is in stable but critical condition at the hospital.\nThe Dodgers dd not comment on the incident.\nA friend of the victim tweeted: @Dodgers Embarrassed to be a Dodger fan as my Mets fan friend is in the hospital missing a piece of his skull after being hit by a lowlife.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T22:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T05:45:45.704+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
