The operation was titled \"Happy Hisua Campaign.\" Under it, 88 special schools were opened under National Child Labour Project in the block in association with NGO Bachpan Bachao Andolan (BBA) to educate the rescued child labourers.\n\"It was really free of child labourers. The block did not have almost any visible child labourers then because the DM was herself leading the campaign and all block officials were on their toes,\" said BBA Bihar coordinator Mukhtarul Haq.\nAround 13 years down the line, Hisua is again swarming with child labourers who can be seen at hotels, dhabas, restaurants, railway station, bus stand and dozens of children who do not get a job sell toys or vegetables on pavements. The Child Labour Act does not cover children selling goods on their own as child labourers.\nAll 88 special schools, run by NGOs, which rehabilitated the child labourers, are now closed.\n12-year-old Suraj Kumar, who mopped the table-top of Laxmi Sweets near Vishwa Shanti Chowk in Rajgir road, said he gets Rs 1000 after working for over 12 hours a day. Another boy - Munna Mahto, said that his parents have made him go to work. \"My parents want me to work and not to study,\" said the 13-year-old boy who works as an assistant at a bike repair shop near Hisua bus stand.\nSunil Kumar, in-charge of BJP Hisua party office, said that over 300 child labourers work in Hisua bazaar area only. BJP is also indifferent to the plight of child labourers. \"Child labour is not an issue, development is. Lalu should have pursued the matter after 2002 also,\" Sanjay Kumar, chief of BJP's Narhat block, said.\nA few child labourers go inside the Hisua police station carrying tea for police officials. A child worker - Sunil Yadav, at a tea stall said all his friends work and so does he. \"I want to study but when will I do that?\" asked Sunil.\nAt hotels, they are hired for sweeping the floor, cleaning utensils, serving water and dishes, and cutting vegetables. None of the child labourers were aware that Lalu had declared Hisua a child free block, many of them were even not born at that time.\nRight in-front of Hisua police station, a child Ranjit sold utensils and toys. \"What can we do about it? It is a social problem. I can force them to go home but what will they eat? Some of them are bread earners in the family,\" a sub inspector at Hisua police station said, not willing to be identified.\nA member of Bihar State Commission for Protection of Child Rights, Mukhtarul Haq said that the special schools funded by the centre started closing down soon after the then DM Vijaya Laxmi was transferred. \"Many closed during the chief minister-ship of Rabri Devi,\" he said.\nManish Kumar, fighting as an independent from Hisua assembly segment, said no political party is concerned about the child labourers. \"It was a big achievement but the political class and the administration should have ensured that Hisua remains a child labourer free block,\" Kumar said.\nIt seems that Lalu has now completely forgotten Hisua. RJD is not even contesting from Hisua assembly segment. The seat went to JD(U) fold in the grand alliance.\nThe JD(U) campaigns do not mention child labourers. JD(U) candidate Kaushal Yadav however said he will take steps to solve the problem.
