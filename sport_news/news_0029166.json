(Brian Cassella / Chicago Tribune) David Haugh Contact Reporter In the Wake of the News How did Jon Lester assess his Game 1 start? \"We lost.\" \nForget the lack of run support Cubs starter Jon Lester received Saturday night at Citi Field in a 4-2 loss to the Mets. \nStay away from offering alibis for Lester related to the chilly weather, the seeing-eye singles or the dominance of Mets starter Matt Harvey. Stop making excuses for Lester, period. \nHe never made any, and it's a good thing. \n\"We lost,\" Lester said somberly at his locker after the Mets took a 1-0 lead in the National League Championship Series. \"It doesn't matter how I assess it.\" \nThe fairest one-word assessment: disappointing. This was the kind of game the Cubs hired Lester to win, to be the best pitcher when it mattered most. He wasn't. \nWhen the Cubs come to the Big Apple to play the Mets, they always hope to avoid seeing, well, the big apple. Yet there the shiny red sphere was in the sixth inning, rising conspicuously behind the center-field wall as the stadium attraction does after home runs. This one came off the bat of Mets catcher Travis d'Arnaud, who gave the ball a majestic 431-foot ride off Lester for the third run that turned out to be the difference. \nAll the action from Citi Field. \nAs it sailed, Lester dropped his head, similar to the way he did in the first inning when Mets second baseman Daniel Murphy drilled a home run into the right-field upper deck. Murphy's Law didn't apply all game for the Cubs, but this clearly wasn't a night when everything went right for Lester. And it had to be. \nToo often, Lester looked like a guy wearing No. 34 on his back and the weight of Chicago on his shoulders. There are more serious people in baseball, but they all call balls and strikes. Intensity was written all over Lester's stone face as Murphy dug into the batter's box. Then it was 1-0 Mets, and things only got worse for the lefty, who gave up four runs in 6 2/3 innings. \nHis biggest regret came in the fifth, when Lester allowed Curtis Granderson's go-ahead single after the Cubs had tied it. \n\"We had just gotten momentum,\" Lester said. \"Other than the two homers, there really weren't a lot of hard-hit balls.\" \nStill, Lester welcomes the expectations that come with a $155 million contract and surely realizes he didn't meet them. It doesn't matter if he settled down to give the Cubs a serviceable effort or that his stuff often was nastier than a New York cabbie at rush hour. The Cubs didn't pay for serviceable out of a pitcher with Lester's October resume. This will go down as a blot on it, reality he accepts. Fans likely will be more forgiving of Lester than he will be of himself. Cubs' Jon Lester on the weather, his mistakes \nCubs starter Jon Lester talks about the Citi Field weather, and his mistakes in the loss to the Mets. \nCubs starter Jon Lester talks about the Citi Field weather, and his mistakes in the loss to the Mets. See more videos \nPart of the presentation to Lester during free agency included a video of how Chicago would react when the team ended a 106-year drought and won a World Series. They stressed when — not if. In the minds of Cubs President Theo Epstein and Chairman Tom Ricketts, the scene represented the goal in a season or two. Lester left thinking it was possible in 2015. \n\"I wanted to win now,\" Lester recalled of that meeting. \nThe Cubs still can, of course, even if Lester was outpitched in Game 1 for the second straight series. Just as the Cubs overcame John Lackey's shutout in the opener against the Cardinals, they have plenty of life left in the NLCS after Harvey's masterful performance. \n\"Our guys are fine, really,\" manager Joe Maddon said. \"Sometimes you have to give credit to the other guy too. He was that good.\" \nHarvey did for the Mets what Lester was expected to do for the Cubs, quieting a lineup that entered having hit more home runs than any other postseason team: 12. Put another way, the Cubs got Arrieta'd into the eighth inning. \nDominating a la Jake Arrieta, Harvey baffled hitters with an array of off-speed pitches. Whether it was publicly debating innings limits or being late for a workout, controversy has hounded Harvey. But when he left with two outs in the eighth, after giving up a Kyle Schwarber home run, the ovation from the crowd of 44,287 echoed all over Queens. \nThe Cubs' biggest threat came in the fifth when Starlin Castro tied the game with a line drive over the head of center fielder Juan Lagares, who misread the ball. But as quickly as Cubs fans were cheering Castro's bat, they had reason to doubt his judgment. On a Javier Baez single to left with one out, Castro tried to score from second — a no-no against Yoenis Cespedes' arm. \nThe play wasn't close, nor should have been the decision to send Castro by third-base coach Gary Jones. Abandoning awareness for aggressiveness backfired — especially for a Cubs team that used two straight squeeze bunts to manufacture runs in the Cardinals series. \n\"We tried to take a chance with Harvey on the mound because we didn't know how many we'd have,\" Castro said. \"I think that's what Jonesy was thinking.\" \nThe Mets offense made it moot. They arrived the hotter team after eliminating the Dodgers on Thursday night while the Cubs just looked cold, literally. The Cubs live by Maddon's mantra of never letting the pressure exceed the pleasure — but nobody said anything about barometric pressure. Temperatures dipped into the lower 40s with winds whipping at 15 mph. Jorge Soler dressed as if he were competing in the Iditarod, and when he struck out looking, he did so through what appeared to be a ski mask. \nNow it's up to Maddon to make sure his team acclimates itself Sunday to the colder conditions and higher stakes. Kris Bryant offered a suggestion Friday in case things began to look bleak. \n\"Bring back the magic,\" Bryant said, referencing the magician Maddon hired the last time the Cubs played here. \nThe return of the Cubs' bats is a higher priority.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T08:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T08:50:32.772+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
