Tristan Thompson recently ended his holdout with the Cleveland Cavaliers , and we should see him in limited minutes against the Chicago Bulls on Tuesday. The power forward believes he did the right thing, but it leaves fans questioning whether or not put up superstar numbers.\nAdChoices “If you asked if I would do it again, I’ll tell you I would do it again in a heartbeat,” Thompson told the Northeast Ohio Media Group. “Business is business and I believed in my guys Rich and Mark and myself and that’s what I did.”\nRich Paul and Mark Termini helped the PF land a five-year contract worth $82 million, and this was due to Thompson’s numbers in the playoffs after all of Cleveland’s injuries. This was a great financial move, because the Cavs’ offer last October was for four years and $50 million.\nThe problem, though, is one of perception. Thompson will be coming off of the bench behind Kevin Love and Timofey Mozgov, and it would be shocking if the Cavaliers carry that much payroll beyond this season. The smart money would be on Cleveland making a trade either this year or next year, and Thompson might be the first guy out of the door if things go south in the coming season.\nA situation could occur where he basically becomes a modern Joe Johnson from a contract perspective. It is hard to blame players like Thompson and Johnson for taking the money when it’s there, but the fan reaction to guys like that will almost always be quite cold when they fail to reach expectations.\nIt’s basically a question of if you would rather be undervalued or overpaid, and Thompson has made his choice. You can’t really fault him for that decision, but here is hoping he doesn’t think the fans will just warmly accept mediocrity on the court.\nDave Daniels is a Featured Writer for RantSports.com.
