Of the 11 rushers for the Sentinels, Smith finished with the most yards with 62. Banks added 56 yards on seven carries, and Austin Martin added 50 on seven second-half carries. \nThe defense limited the Warriors to 94 yards on the ground and 93 through the air, came up with three interceptions and recovered a fumble. \n“I’m not sure if anyone noticed, but we had our scout defense starting for us today. They do a great job for us every week and we wanted to reward them. We do have some regular starters in that group, but we thought the other kids deserved the chance to start,” Appel said about his team’s defensive play. \nThe Warriors were outmatched from kickoff to final whistle and their substitutes could be counted on one hand, but they did have kids who showed they could play. \nQuarterback Reginald James showed he could throw and run, but the Sentinels’ defense never allowed him the time or space to do much of either. Running back Bryce Hawkins scored both of his team’s touchdowns – running from three yards out in the first quarter and catching a 20-yard pass from James in the fourth – and flashed his skills on a few kickoff returns. \nFort Hill improves to 4-1 and has won 32 of its last 33 games. The Sentinels will host South Hagerstown Friday night.
