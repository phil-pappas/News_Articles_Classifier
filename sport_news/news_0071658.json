So that's where it starts.\" \nMurray was being forthright and also was right. \nHis bobble turned into an interception turned into a Bears go-ahead field goal in the second quarter; then Murray's lost fumble early in the fourth got him pulled from the rest of the game. \nMurray's explanation of the deflected pass, which was picked off by Bears linebacker Pernell McPhee: \n\"Just took my eyes off it. Was paying attention to the defender. You can't do that. You've got to make sure you secure the ball first and then do what you're going to do after that.\" \nMurray on his fumble, which came when he dropped a lateral from Derek Carr: \n\"Just trying to get out of there and get to some open space. I've got to be better at that. And I will.\" \nMurray said neither coach Jack Del Rio nor any of Del Rio's assistants told him he'd actually been benched after the fumble, but Murray said he understood why Roy Helu finished the game. \nOverall, the Bears defense didn't give Murray much room -- he carried 16 times for only 49 yards, and his long gain was 8 yards. Advertisement \nCarr said he appreciated that Murray was taking responsibility for the turnovers, but that the third-year running back can't blame himself for this loss. \n\"This is the ultimate team game,\" Carr said. \"Those turnovers could've happened, and they could miss the kick and we win. \n\"Not one person can ever just take the blame. I appreciate him trying to stand up and do that -- it takes a lot for someone to try to do that.\" \nWhen asked specifically if he pulled Murray because of the turnovers, Del Rio went into some understandable coach-speak. \n\"We've got an active 46 (-man roster), we try to take advantage and utilize those guys,\" Del Rio said. \n\"We did what we thought we could at the end there to give ourselves a lift.\" \nLatavius, how do you get past this? \n\"Move on,\" Murray said, \"and get ready for next week ... \n\"Me having those two turnovers hurt us a lot. We've just got to find a way to win the tight games. I'll play better.\" Read Tim Kawakami's Talking Points blog at blogs.mercurynews.com/kawakami .
