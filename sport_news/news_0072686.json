Texas tied the game in the eighth inning and then broke a five-inning scoreless stretch with four straight singles in the 14th. \n*Man of the Moment: Hansel Alberto, the light-hitting young infielder asked to step in for injured Adrian Beltre, lined a 14th-inning, game-winning single to center, plating Rougned Odor. It was Alberto’s first hit in eight postseason plate appearances — and first base hit since Aug. 30 — after batting .222 in limited playing time this season and getting only two plate appearances in September. \n*Game 2 Pivot Point: Blue Jays lefty reliever Brett Cecil got lefties and righties out equally well during the season, but it was still a surprise to see him pitch to Rangers righty pinch-hitter Mike Napoli in the eighth because of the batter’s pronounced right/left splits. Napoli batted .191 with a .603 OPS against right-handers this year and .278 with a .954 OPS against left-handers, yet Gibbons did not summon any of his plethora of righties from the bullpen. Napoli lined a 1-and-0 curveball into right-center to score the tying run from second. \n*Quality (second-half) start: The Rangers bullpen held Toronto scoreless for seven innings — the 8th through 14th — using five relievers. Jake Diekman and Shawn Tolleson each pitched two innings while Sam Dyson, Keone Kela and Ross Ohlendorf each pitched one. Diekman retired all six batters he faced for the second straight game. \n*Changed men: Despite leaving Game 1 after taking a blow to the head less than 24 hours ago, Donaldson passed concussion protocols and then homered in his very first at bat in Game 2, crushing a 1-and-2 change up over the centerfield wall. \nNotably, that was Hamels’ first change up of the game and, perhaps because of that result, he reduced its usage the next few innings, seemingly more tentative to throw it in or near the zone. He threw the pitch 24% of the time during the season — it went for a called or swinging strike 71% of the time — but he threw only seven total in the first three innings: Donaldson’s homer, one whiff, one foul and four balls. \nHamels later found the feel of the pitch, with whiffs on each of the next seven Jays’ swings at it, but Toronto scored three runs in those first two innings when the veteran hadn’t yet gained command of his best pitch. \nWith that one pitch, Donaldson assuaged fears of his wellness and Hamels demonstrated a little less confidence in one of his best weapons. \n*No trouble with the curve: Stroman openly admits that he’s a “very emotional pitcher” who competes with “hate and anger” in his heart — hate, he confesses, that also extends to spiders and insects — but he proved himself up to the challenge of staying under control and winning a must-have game for the Jays. After allowing three runs (two earned) in the first two innings, Stroman shut out the Rangers until the eighth, retiring 18 of 20 batters at one point. He only got one swing-and-miss on his 70 pitches that weren’t curveballs, so he resorted to that curve with more frequency later in the game with great success; he induced four whiffs on the pitch and got outs three of the four times Texas put the pitch in play. \n*One-man job: The first three Rangers to bat in this game all smacked base hits, and the fourth reached when an errant throw in a rundown became a run-scoring error. Colabello started that rundown and took matters into his own hands on the next two batted balls, both struck to him. The first was routine: he fielded the ball and touched first base. \nOn the second, however, hit by Josh Hamilton, Colabello looked toward Fielder leading off third, managed to tag Hamilton near first base and then ran all the way across the diamond to tag Fielder out near third base — he couldn’t return to third because the trail runner, Moreland, had already advanced to the bag. Colabello finished the inning with three unassisted putouts, tying a major league record, presumably shared by many, many, many. Colabello had unassisted putouts again in the second and the third. \n*Stir the Pot: Center fielder Kevin Pillar is co-adopter of Toronto’s “stir the pot” celebration — a hand-twirling gesture borrowed from the NBA’s James Harden — and he was stirring with gusto from second base in the bottom of the fifth after his leadoff double. He’d later scored on a Ben Revere single to give Toronto its first lead of the ALDS. \n“Stir the pot” became such a fad that IKEA got in on the action and donated 12,000 wooden spoons to fans before Game 1, so fans could stir their own pot — well, at least if Rogers Centre had let them bring the spoons in. Rougned Odor's sleight of hand plates run for Rangers in Game 2 of ALDS \n*What you missed on TV: DeShields led off the game by lining the ball to deep rightfield, sending Bautista back to the wall where he leapt and nearly caught the ball before caroming into the wall. Bautista seemed unfazed by the collision, but upon returning to his position, he removed his glove and reached for both cleats to stretch his hamstrings — one of which cramped and led to an early exit from Game 1. Bautista stayed loose enough that he tracked down a sinking liner off Hanser Alberto’s bat with a diving catch in the seventh. Bautista again made a long run to catch a ball off Hamilton’s bat in the 14th. \n*Couldn’t play in a pinch: Beltre was spotted taking swings in the underground batting cage and then returning to the dugout during the late innings, but the fact that he didn’t pinch-hit for lefthanded-swinging Josh Hamilton — 0 for his last 29 in the postseason and .236 against lefty pitchers — against lefty Aaron Loup with two on and two out in the 11th inning means he must not have been able to get loose enough to swing effectively. Loup induced a flyout from Hamilton to end the threat. \n*Meet and Greet: After Donaldson watched a long, long foul ball travel wide of the pole in the 13th inning, Rangers reliever Keone Kela and Donaldson exchanged heated words, before both benches and bullpens emptied. No punches were thrown, and the gathering quickly dispersed. \nGALLERY: ALDS - RANGERS vs. BLUE JAYS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T00:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T01:27:27.218+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
