(AP) â€” Randy Edsall was fired as Maryland's football coach Sunday, less than 24 hours after the team's third straight lopsided defeat.\nThe dismissal comes in the middle of Edsall's fifth season with the Terrapins. He is 22-34 since taking over in 2011.\nMaryland (2-4, 0-2 Big Ten) has been outscored 122-34 during its three-game losing streak. Including an earlier defeat against Bowling Green, Maryland's four losses have come by an average of four touchdowns.\n\"We appreciate Randy's tireless commitment to the University of Maryland,\" athletic director Kevin Anderson said in a statement. \"This was a difficult decision, but ultimately this is the best course of action for our football program moving forward.\"\nRELATED : AP Top 25 ballot: Ohio State or Utah? Who's No. 1?\nOffensive coordinator Mike Locksley will take over on an interim basis. Maryland has a bye this week before facing Penn State in Baltimore on Oct. 24.\nLocksley played college football at Towson University in Maryland from 1988-91 and later coached at Towson. He was a running backs coach at Maryland and also served as a recruiting coordinator.\nHe was head coach at New Mexico from 2009-11, going 2-26, before returning to Maryland to 2012.\n\"Having spent more than a decade with the Maryland football program over the course of his career, I feel Mike is best suited to effectively guide our program through the remainder of the 2015 season,\" Anderson said. \"Mike has previous head coaching experience and is well-respected both locally and nationally.\"\nEdsall, 57, replaced Ralph Friedgen at Maryland after going 74-70 in 12 years at Connecticut.\nRumors of Edsall's dismissal began last week, shortly before Maryland lost 49-28 to No. 1 Ohio State on Saturday. The defeat followed a 45-6 loss at West Virginia and a 28-0 embarrassment at home against Michigan.\nMaryland played in two straight bowl games after going 2-10 and 4-8 in Edsall's first two seasons. The Terrapins finished 7-6 in 2014, including 4-4 in their first season in the Big Ten.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T22:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T21:02:35.932+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
