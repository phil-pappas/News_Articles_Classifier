(AP) - Thomas Vanek scored the go-ahead goal in the second period and the Minnesota Wild beat Columbus 3-2 on Thursday night, pushing the Blue Jackets to 0-8-0 and spoiling John Tortorella's debut. \nThe Blue Jackets' start is the worst season-opening regulation losing streak in the NHL since the New York Rangers started 0-11-0 in 1943-44. Tortorella took over as coach Wednesday after Todd Richards was fired. \nZach Parise tied for the league lead with his sixth goal 5 minutes in. After Alexander Wennberg and Brandon Dubinsky countered for Columbus, Nino Niederreiter tied it and Vanek scored the winner with 8:48 left in the second with his third goal of the season. \nDevan Dubnyk made 27 saves for his fourth win in five games this season. \nSergei Bobrovsky made 20 saves for the Blue Jackets.
