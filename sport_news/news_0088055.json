Coach Charlie Strong’s Longhorns (2-4, 1-2 Big 12) came to Dallas in the midst of the program’s worst start in 59 years and as two-touchdown underdog to the Sooners (4-1, 1-1). It’s been nothing but turmoil and excruciating losses for the Longhorns so far, but Strong’s defense harassed Oklahoma quarterback Baker Mayfield and the offense made just enough plays to show Texas fans that better times might not be so far away. Jerrod Heard mostly guided the Texas offense with 168 total yards and Swoopes played finisher near the goal line. His 2-yard TD flip to Caleb Bluiett with 13:52 left in the fourth quarter made it 24-10. Oklahoma responded with a long touchdown drive capped by Samaje Perine’s 1-yard touchdown run to cut it to 24-17 with 8:00 minutes left. Oklahoma got the ball back with 6:05 left, but two sacks, the last by Naashon Hughes and Poona Ford, forced a punt and Texas killed the clock. \nNo. 2 TCU 52, Kansas State 45 \nMANHATTAN, KAN. \nTrevone Boykin threw for 301 yards and two touchdowns, the second a 55-yard strike to Josh Doctson with 1:10 left in the game, and TCU rallied from a big halftime deficit to beat Kansas State. Boykin also ran for 124 yards and two scores for the Horned Frogs (6-0, 3-0 Big 12), who trailed 35-17 at the break. Aaron Green added 124 yards and two touchdowns rushing, while Doctson caught eight passes for 155 yards and two touchdowns. None was bigger than his catch-and-run just 30 seconds after Jack Cantele had connected on a 37-yard field goal for KSU (3-2, 0-2) to knot the game at 45. \nNo. 3 Baylor 66, Kansas 7 \nLAWRENCE, KAN. \nSeth Russell threw three touchdown passes, Shock Linwood ran for 135 yards and a score, and Baylor romped past Kansas. Russell threw for 246 yards, all in the first half. Two of the TD strikes went to Corey Coleman, pushing his nation-leading total to 13, and the other to 6-foot-7, 410-pound tight end LaQuan McGowan, helping the Bears (5-0, 2-0 Big 12) to a 52-7 halftime lead. The Bears piled up 644 yards despite playing backups the entire second half. Freshman Ryan Willis threw for 158 yards and a score in his first start for Kansas (0-5, 0-2). \nNo. 6 Clemson 43, Georgia Tech 24 \nCLEMSON, S.C. \nDeshaun Watson threw two touchdown passes, Wayne Gallman ran for two scores and Clemson surged past Georgia Tech. On the same soggy field where the Tigers (5-0, 2-0 Atlantic Coast Conference) outlasted Notre Dame24-22 last week, they made quick work of the Yellow Jackets (2-4, 0-3). Gallman ran for 115 yards, including a 66-yard touchdown run on the game’s third play. Watson passed for 265 yards and had touchdown throws of 29 and 8 yards to tight end Jordan Leggett. \nNo. 7 LSU 45, South Carolina 24 \nBATON ROUGE, LA. \nLeonard Fournette had an 87-yard touchdown run, Brandon Harris passed for a career-best 228 yards, and LSU beat South Carolina (2-4, 0-4 Southeastern Conference) in a game moved to Tiger Stadium because of flooding in South Carolina. Fournette finished with a season-low 158 yards on 20 carries in three quarters. Freshman Derrius Guice rushed for 161 yards and a TD, fellow running back Darrel Williams scored twice and the Tigers (5-0, 3-0) piled up 396 yards rushing. Travin Dural had 109 yards receiving for LSU, highlighted by a 62-yard TD catch. Malachi Dupre also had a TD reception. \nNo. 8 Alabama 27, Arkansas 14 \nTUSCALOOSA, ALA. \nCalvin Ridley caught an 81-yard touchdown pass from Jake Coker and Alabama rode its swarming defense to a victory over Arkansas. Stymied by early mistakes, the Crimson Tide (5-1, 2-1 Southeastern Conference) scored 24 points over the final 17 minutes after trailing the Razorbacks (2-4, 1-2) at the half. The Tide held Alex Collins to 26 rushing yards and added three sacks and an interception. \nNo. 14 Mississippi, New Mexico State 3 \nOXFORD, MISS. \nChad Kelly threw for 384 yards and three touchdowns to lead Mississippi. Kelly, who came into the day leading the Southeastern Conference in passing, has topped 300 yards in four of his six games. He completed 24 of 33 throws. Laquon Treadwell caught eight passes for 136 yards and two touchdowns, including one on a spectacular one-handed grab down the right sideline. The Rebels (5-1) finished with 665 yards of total offense. \nNo. 15 Notre Dame 41, Navy 24 \nSOUTH BEND, IND. \nC.J. Prosise ran for 129 yards and three touchdowns, two after Navy turnovers, and Notre Dame beat the Midshipmen. Navy rallied to tie it at 21 late in the second quarter on fullback Quentin Ezell’s TD runs of 45 and 22 yards after quarterback Keenan Reynolds went down with a leg injury. But Justin Yoon’s 52-yard field goal to close the first half and Prosise’s two touchdowns early in the second half gave the Irish (5-1) a 17-point lead. Navy (4-1) entered the game tied for best in the nation with one turnover, but had two Saturday. \nTennessee 38, No. 19 Georgia 31 \nKNOXVILLE, TENN. \nJoshua Dobbs threw for 312 yards, ran for 118 more and accounted for five touchdowns and Tennessee (3-3, 1-2 Southeastern Conference) overcame a 21-point deficit to beat Georgia. Georgia (4-2, 1-2) lost star running back Nick Chubb to a left knee injury on the first play from scrimmage. Georgia’s Reggie Davis scored on a 70-yard punt return and 48-yard catch, but dropped a potential tying 56-yard pass with less than 4 minutes left. The Bulldogs got to Tennessee’s 27 in the final seconds, but Brian Randolph broke up Greyson Lambert’s pass to Malcolm Mitchell in the end zone. \nNo. 21 Oklahoma State 33, West Virginia 26, OT \nMORGANTOWN, W.VA. \nBackup quarterback J.W. Walsh scored on a 2-yard run in overtime and Oklahoma State held West Virginia scoreless on its possession in the extra period. It marked the third straight close finish for the Cowboys (6-0, 3-0 Big 12), who won their two previous conference games on last-minute field goals. Skyler Howard brought West Virginia from 15 points down with a 3-yard scoring run with 2:44 left to send the game into overtime tied at 26. West Virginia (3-2, 0-2) advanced to the 4 on its overtime possession, but Howard threw incomplete in the end zone on fourth-and-goal. \nNo. 25 Boise State 41, Colorado State 10 \nFORT COLLINS, COLO. \nThomas Sperbeck caught two long touchdown passes and Jeremy McNichols scored his 13th and 14th TDs of the season, leading Boise State past Colorado State. Among Brett Rypien’s 339 yards passing was a beautiful 85-yard scoring strike to McNichols, who also caught a 53-yard touchdown pass from fellow wide receiver Shane Williams-Rhodes on a trick play. \nAssociated Press", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T07:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T00:20:06.892+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
