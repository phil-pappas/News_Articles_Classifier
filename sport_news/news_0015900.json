Pilcher , The Gazette October 17, 2015 | 2:53 pm \nEverything seemed like a blur at the time, but it all came into focus the following morning. \nThe magnitude of what Cedar Rapids Xavier accomplished began to set in to head coach Duane Schulte, kicker Dallas Klein and likely the rest of the team. \nThe Class 3A third-ranked Saints capped an amazing comeback with a 35-yard game-winning field goal from Klein as time expired for a 38-35 victory over top-ranked and defending 1A state champion Iowa City Regina in a non-district game. Xavier improved to 7-0 overall. \n“In all my years of coaching, I don’t think we’ve ever had a walk-off situation like that where we won it on the last play of the game,” said Schulte, who has 152 wins in 22 seasons with Xavier and Cedar Rapids La Salle. “We’ve had some exciting finishes before but nothing like that. Credit goes to the kids.” \nKlein, a senior who is also a standout soccer player, delivered in the clutch. He said the Saints try to simulate those moments in practice but nothing can replicate that kind of moment. He was confident from the time he made contact. \n“We try to get out there and relax a bit,” Klein said. “Just treat it like it was any other kick (and) look through the middle of the uprights and try to put it there. \n“It felt good coming off my foot. It ended up good.” \nKlein had been in that position before, missing a late kick in a regular-season loss last season. He was determined to make amends by converting for his teammates. \n“This time I felt I had to put it in for my team,” Klein said. “We did it. \n“I think the team deserved it.” \nKlein had plenty of leg almost clearing the uprights after Michael Fettkether and Blake Whitten executed the snap and hold. Klein accounted for 10 points, adding seven extra-point kicks and improving to 33 of 33 in PATs. He has three field goals this season. \n“I can’t say enough about Dallas Klein,” Schulte said. “He’s just a really good kid. He’s worked his tail off.” \nPart of that work has come with Xavier assistant Craig Jelinek, who provided some advice before the winning kick. Klein said Jelinek has worked with his technique in football. \n“He helps me out with what I need to tweak a little bit,” Klein said. “He always keeps helping me trying to get better.” \nThe Saints trailed 35-7 at halftime after the Regals scored four straight TDs to break an early tie. Schulte said they emphasized the program’s “everyone do their job” mantra. The Saints executed after the break, receiving three TD runs from QB Bryce Schulte and another from Maliki Wilson. \n“It has to be 11 guys, whoever the 11 guys are on the field at any moment, doing their job,” Schulte said. “In the second half, they started to do it. \n“We kind of went back to basics. We wanted to chip away and get it close and see what happens.” \nThe Saints will enjoy it for the moment and return to work Monday. Xavier will close its district play Friday against Marion at Thomas Park. \n“You just try to enjoy it a little bit,” said Schulte, praising the way Regina Coach Marv Cook handled the loss by offering congratulations and good luck in the future. “You have to. I’m getting too old not to enjoy the good moments.” \nWEST HAS SHOT AT DISTRICT TITLE \nIowa City West suffered a slow start, dropping its first four games and five of its first six, including four to ranked opponents. \nThe Trojans (3-5) have thrived in district play, improving to 3-0 in Class 4A District 7 with a 42-8 road win Friday over Davenport North. West will play at Pleasant Valley (6-2, 3-0) with the district title at stake. \nThe Trojans were impressive through the air against North. West quarterback Alex Henderson threw for 257 yards, completing all 12 passes to Oliver Martin and Devontae Lane. \nMartin had 115 receiving yards, tallying a TD reception and scoring run. Lane had 142 yards on five catches, including a 49-yard scoring strike. \nBOBCATS LOCK WINNING REGULAR SEASON \nBenton Community secured its first winning regular season since 2008 with a 14-6 non-district home win Friday over Oelwein. The Bobcats improved to 5-3 overall and are fourth at 3-2 in Class 3A District 6. The last time Benton qualified for the postseason was also 2008. \nJunior Riley Pfifner rushed for 134 yards and a touchdown. Pfifner has 811 rushing yards and 7 TDs this season. Lathan Cooper added a 39-yard interception return for a score and Vance Bartelt added a two-point conversion. \nBenton travels to district leader Gilbert (7-1, 5-0) in Week 9. \nl Comments: (319) 368-8679; kj.pilcher@thegazette.com Your Next Articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T20:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T21:15:23.654+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
