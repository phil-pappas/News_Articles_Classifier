Dale Earnhardt, Jr. isn’t most drivers. \nEarnhardt heads to the 2.66-mile behemoth for Sunday’s CampingWorld.com 500 Chase for the NASCAR Sprint Cup cutoff race in a win-or-go-home situation. Too far down in the standings to realistically advance on points (11th out of 12, 31 points below the cutoff), he has to visit victory lane to move on to the eight-driver Eliminator Round. \n“I wouldn’t rather be going anywhere else than Talladega for the next race if we need a win,” the 12-time Most Popular Driver said. “That is a good opportunity for us. Even over Daytona, I think we can go to Talladega and do the job.” \nEarnhardt ranks tied with Jeff Gordon for the active lead with six wins at the Alabama track, and has won two of the three restrictor-plate races this season, including the May contest at Talladega. In addition to his six victories, he owns 11 top-five and 15 top-10 finishes in 31 starts at the superspeedway. \nEarnhardt is chasing history on Sunday as well. A visit to victory lane would make him the first driver to win three restrictor-plate races since his father Dale Earnhardt in 1990. \n“At Talladega, you give more mentally than you do physically,” Earnhardt said. “In a plate race, you need to make decisions with confidence and make them quickly. If you have any kind of hesitation, someone makes that decision for you and takes away that opportunity. \n“We’re taking the same car we won with earlier this year, so it’s got great speed and we feel confident. It really helps when you have a great car.” \nWDUN will have live MRN Radio coverage of Sunday’s NASCAR Sprint Cup Series race from Talladega Superspeedway beginning at 1 pm on 102.9 FM. \nNASCAR Camping World Trucks: Jones And Crafton Hope To Avoid ‘Big One’ In Championship Hunt At ‘Dega \nWith five races to go in the NASCAR Camping World Truck Series season, one mistake can doom a driver’s championship hopes. \nErik Jones and Matt Crafton are both well aware of this. Jones leads Crafton by a mere four points in the series standings. Not far behind is third-place Tyler Reddick, who can take advantage of a Jones or Crafton slip-up to close his 16-point deficit in the standings. \nThe drivers continue their championship quests in Saturday’s fred’s 250 at Talladega Superspeedway, where accidents are the norm, not an exception. A driver’s day can just as easily be ruined by the mistake of another driver as his own error at the 2.66-mile behemoth. \n“You’re stuck, three-wide, even four-wide, and you can’t do anything about it,” said two-time defending NCWTS champion Crafton, describing the perils of Talladega. “Your fate is in everyone else’s hands and that’s a helpless feeling for a driver. It puts on a good show though.” \nJones explained his strategy is simply to avoid wrecks on Saturday — an undertaking easier said than done. \n“The biggest thing we’ve done there in the past that has worked out well has just been staying on the bottom and staying out of trouble and trying to stay up front and stay out of trouble,” Jones said. “We did a good job last year of staying out of trouble and getting a top-10 finish out of it. Hopefully this year we can do the same.” \nA winner of two NCWTS races this season, Jones just wants to survive Saturday and gain ground in the remaining four races if he has to. \n“I feel like we can make up some more points at some other tracks rather than there, as long as we can just get through Talladega,” Jones said. \nNASCAR Race Weekend Guide", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T16:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T10:08:58.810+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
