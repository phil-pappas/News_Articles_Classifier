One minute spent worrying about what just happened and being negative is one minute wasted. Let’s get after it.” \nNASCAR’s most popular driver, in fact, seems to relish the position the No. 88 team finds itself in, saying he is looking forward to the challenge of getting back in contention for the championship. \nEarnhardt said he figures some of the other drivers in front of him on the points pole may try to just escape damage over the next two races to maintain their spots and that would suit him just fine. \n“These other guys are going to just try to take care of themselves, try to survive,” he said. “A few of us will be out there for blood, trying to claw our way back in. I like being able to race like that. I hate being nervous and worried.” \nAlthough he has zero wins in 18 starts at the 1.5-mile Kansas oval, Earnhardt has a decent record with three top-five results, including a third-place finish earlier this year and nine top 10 finishes. \nAnd his fans should not expect him to attempt some form of retaliation against Carl Edwards in the No. 19 JGR Toyota after the pair tangled at Charlotte. \n“A lot of people want me to go wreck Carl,” Earnhardt said. “I’m not going to do that, because if I’m trying to wreck Carl, I’m not winning Kansas, I’m not winning Talladega. \n“You can’t go chase after a guy and put him out of the race and accomplish what your goals are. \n“We’re not going to worry about Carl or start some (crap) show between me and him,” he said. “It’s over and done.” \nWhat he hopes isn’t over and done is his chance for a first Sprint Cup championship. \nFINISH LINES \nNASCAR has come down hard on Keselowski and the No. 2 Ford team after they accumulated four written warnings for rules infractions. NASCAR ruled that every fourth warning a team received would result in automatic loss of pit selection at the next event and that Keselowski will get last pick at Kansas no matter where the No. 2 team qualifies on Saturday ... Pegged as a future Formula 1 star, 23-year-old Kevin Magnussen has been told he will be out of a job a McLaren/Honda at the end of the 2015 season, according to a report at Autosport.com. \nTRUEX CLOSE BUT NOT QUITE \nKANSAS CITY — Martin Truex is not a prospector, but he does hope to strike gold on Sunday in the Hollywood Casino 400 at Kansas Speedway. \nThe driver of the No. 78 Furniture Row Racing Chevrolet nearly won at the 1.5-mile oval twice — finishing second — and was out front at the track in the spring race this season before running out of fuel. \n“Kansas is the race that I keep on saying that we’re due to strike gold,” Truex said this week. “It’s been one of my better tracks over the years with a couple runner-up finishes. \n“I felt we had the car to beat in this year’s spring race — we led the most laps, but fuel-mileage strategy bit us at the end.” \nTruex and his Canadian crew chief Cole Pearn go into Sunday’s race a solid third in the Chase for the Sprint Cup Championship and they hope to build on that this week. \nCertainly a win would propel the team into the next round and avoid the drama that is Talladega next week. \n“A victory at Kansas would mean automatic advancement into the next round of the Chase and no sleepless nights worrying about the wildcard race at Talladega,” Truex said. “There’s something about Kansas Speedway that makes me feel comfortable. \n“Any time you have confidence in a track it’s a huge advantage, especially in high-pressure situations as we are right now in the middle of the Chase.” Sponsored Links", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T04:08:33.388+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
