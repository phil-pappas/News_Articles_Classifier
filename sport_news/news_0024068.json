Kompany attempted to strike the balance between delight and caution.\nThe Manchester City defender told Sporza: \"We remain realistic, but also a bit chauvinistic. We are the number one in the world and the Netherlands are out. And to think that I have seen times when we were 80th.\n\"Seriously, though, that is football. Sometimes you have a dip, but talent will always prevail. It has worked out well here in Belgium and we are ready for what is to come.\"\nThe 29-year-old was impressed by Belgium's performance against Israel, particularly after it overcame a slow start to the second half before scoring three times in a 20-minute spell to seal the win.\n\"It was the best first half of our campaign, we just did not score,\" Kompany said. \"In the second half we just had a dip, but we still scored suddenly three times. This team has always shown that we can get difficult beyond difficult moments.\n\"That has been the story of the last four years and we should be proud.\"\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "http://www.goal.com/en-us"], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T22:00:47.451+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
