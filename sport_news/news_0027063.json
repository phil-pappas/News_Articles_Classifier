President Coe, who was joined by IOC President Thomas Bach, EA President Svein Arne Hansen and EOC President Patrick Hickey at the Mövenpick Hotel, confirmed to advise IAAF Council in future there would be 10 Commissions and 10 Special Advisory Groups, each with 10 members, who, mostly via video and teleconferencing, would aim to convene 10 times each year. “Central to the process of reviewing and building new structures, I am today announcing widespread changes to the composition and function of IAAF Commissions for the approval of IAAF Council in November” said Seb Coe. “These changes are designed to broaden the experience and ability available to our sport and make the IAAF’s advisory bodies more efficient, more focused and more representative. They will be smaller groups with increased representation of women, younger age groups, coaches and former athletes and experts from outside athletics. “These advisory bodies will make better use of technology to increase the level of dialogue between these advisors and the IAAF beyond the regular face-to-face meetings.” IAAF Commissions “We are reviewing the IAAF Commissions to ensure that the IAAF Council gets the best possible advice and support moving forwards. Among the changes, four entirely new commissions are being created: Values, International Relations, Audit, Youth Engagement Commissions. “There will be 10 Commissions, each with a maximum of 10 members, except the Athletes Commission which, being partially elected, is a special case: Athletes Commission Audit Commission (incorporates former IAAF Finance and Budget Commission) Coaches Commission", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T08:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T21:13:25.253+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
