(AP Photo/Patric Schneider) \nINDIANAPOLIS (AP) — Andrew Luck is starting to look like his old self after missing the last two games with a sore right throwing shoulder. \nThe Colts quarterback was dressed in pads and participated in all of the throwing drills during the early portion of Wednesday’s practice, which is open to the media.
