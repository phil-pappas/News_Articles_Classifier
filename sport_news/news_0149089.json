In 2012, it may have saved Julie Brewington’s life.\nThough she was just 25 years old, the Rumson-Fair Haven High School field hockey coach detected a lump in her left breast. Tests at the Jacqueline Wilentz Breast Center at Monmouth Medical Center in Long Branch led to the diagnosis of breast cancer.\n“I was just completely shocked,” she said. “Never in a million years did I think I would be 25, with no family history, and get breast cancer. You think those things can’t happen to you.”\nThat was in March. Brewington underwent a double mastectomy followed by eight weeks of chemotherapy. By the fall she was back on the field, coaching the Bulldogs to their first-ever sectional title. Now they are the defending NJSIAA Group II champions and ranked 15th in the nation by USA Today.\n“I never thought twice about coaching because I knew in the long run it would help me to feel normal and be in that environment I love to be in,” Brewington said. “I do think it was a part of my healing process, being able to go to practice and be around the girls.”\nMany mystical -- and sometimes exaggerated -- powers have been attributed to sports. But this is real: Coaching helped Brewington get through her ordeal, and on the flip side, her fight to beat cancer inspired a team, a school and the entire Shore Conference field hockey community.\nSuffice it to say October’s pink-themed breast cancer awareness month has tangible meaning for everyone in Brewington’s circle.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T20:09:30.880+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
