ORCHARD PARK, N.Y. — Rueben Randle knew what he wanted to do if he was fortunate enough to score a touchdown for the second straight week.\nSo when Eli Manning found him for an 11-yard score in the second quarter, Randle executed the plan and danced. As an homage to teammate Victor Cruz, Randle busted out his salsa moves and finished off his end-zone celebration with a salute to one of the Giants’ team leaders watching back home.\nCruz felt a flare-up in his calf in practice last week and his return to the field – initially scheduled for Sunday – was put on hold. He did not travel to Buffalo.\n\"I had to do it for him. I know it was a tough week for him,\" Randle said. \"I knew if I got in the end zone this week, I wanted to make sure that he knew we were still thinking about him. It was definitely for him. Felt like he needed it.\"\nCruz responded to Randle’s gesture on Twitter, writing: \"My brothers always got my back. That was special Rueben Randle love you bro!\"\nCruz is expected to meet with Giants doctors today to formulate his rehabilitation plan and a possible timetable for his return.\nREX WANTS THE FIGHT: The Bills committed 17 penalties, many that proved costly in Sunday’s game.\nInstead of being upset, Buffalo coach Rex Ryan was encouraged.\n\"I’m proud of the way this team played. Now can we play a lot smarter? Absolutely,\" Ryan said. \"But I’ll take a team that will fight over a team that won’t, that’ll sit back and take it. Any day of the week and bring on the next team.\"\nFLOWERS GUTS IT OUT: Rookie LT Ereck Flowers has earned the respect and the trust of Tom Coughlin by refusing to let an ankle injury keep him off the field Sunday. Flowers missed the Giants’ victory over the Redskins and was limited in practice last week, but he showed enough that Coughlin gave him the green light.\n\"We both want to win,\" Flowers said. \"That’s just what it is. I want to play.\"\nOne play into the game, Flowers’ ankle got rolled up on. He came limping off and missed the next two possessions with left guard Justin Pugh moving to left tackle and John Jerry coming into the game in Pugh’s stead. Flowers re-entered the game on the Giants’ fourth possession and did not come out again. He even got the best of Bills defensive end Jerry Hughes, one of the league’s fiercest pass rushers.\n\"I worked him out before the game to see where he was at. The kid’s a tough kid,\" Coughlin said. \"I ask him how he’s doing and he says, ‘Good.’ He’s always good. The key thing is, on the first play of the game, he hurt the ankle again. He came out and before you know it, he’s back in. I respect the [heck] out of it.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T04:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T08:43:48.802+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
