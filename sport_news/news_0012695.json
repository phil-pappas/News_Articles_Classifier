The Kitsap Sun reports players from the other team and others joined him. \nThe school district says in a statement issued Monday that Kennedy's employment status is unchanged. School officials are reviewing the events of Friday night and are talking to the coach's lawyers. \nDistrict spokeswoman Patty Glaser says the district hopes they can arrive at an understanding with Kennedy that will respect the rights of all community members, and follow the law. \nAll content copyright ©2015 Pendleton Times-Post, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T20:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T21:07:40.052+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
