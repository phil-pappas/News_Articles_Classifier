Jacoby Ellsbury, at one point the team’s top catalyst, ended up being the odd man out. Starting in his favor are Brett Gardner in centerfield and Chris Young in left. “We felt that we had to get Chris Young’s bat in there against the left-hander, against Keuchel,” Girardi said at his pre-game news conference. “It just came down to Gardy’s body of work against lefties versus Ellsbury.” Young, a right-handed batter, had a .972 on-base plus slugging percentage against left-handers this season, and is one of the few Yankees to have performed well against Keuchel, collecting 6 hits in 20 at-bats. Girardi’s decision raised some eyebrows based on the team’s financial commitment to Ellsbury. In just the second year of a seven-year, $153 million contact with the Yankees, Ellsbury was paid just over $21 million this season, but struggled to stay healthy and posted a .663 O.P.S., which is his worst performance in a full season. He and Gardner both struggled after the All-Star break. Girardi left the door open for Ellsbury to enter the game at some point, and with the season on the line, his speed could still be a game-changing factor for the Yankees. “The one thing I told Ells that you’re going to be in this game. He said ‘I’ll be ready. Whenever you need me, I’ll be ready.’” A healthy Jacoby Ellsbury not starting for the #Yankees in tonight’s AL Wild Card Game.

Lee/The New York Times Yankees starter Masahiro Tanaka is pitching on a full five days’ rest, but is coming off a few starts in a row that were below his usual standard. In his last two starts, Tanaka allowed six earned runs in 11 innings, and the Yankees lost both games. Not quite the ace he appeared to be when he first came to New York, Tanaka is still well above average and will not make things easy for Houston’s hitters.

Credit Ross D. Franklin/Associated Press In a one-game playoff to remain alive in baseball’s postseason, the Houston Astros are sending Dallas Keuchel to the mound on just three days’ rest. The Cy Young contender is the team’s best pitcher, and has had no shortage of success against the Yankees, but the short turnaround should dominate the conversation of the game regardless of how he pitches. “It probably garners more attention than it needs to,” Astros manager A.J. Hinch told reporters this week. “But at the end of the day, I think if he pitches well it will be a lot of guts and he came through on short rest. If he doesn’t pitch well, then it’s a change in routine and a lack of rest.” The truth is, no one can predict how well Keuchel will pitch on short rest because he has never attempted it as a major leaguer. In his 100 career starts, Keuchel has never pitched with fewer than four days of rest between starts. And based on how he performed this season, there may be cause for concern about how he will react to the change in routine. Keuchel was given six or more days between starts four times this season, and in the following starts he produced a 1.95 earned-run average, a 0.9 WHIP and he struck out 9.8 batters per nine innings. When given five days’ rest, those numbers dropped to 2.38, 0.99 and 8.7 in 12 starts. When dropped to four days’ rest, he dropped even further, to 2.68, 1.06 and 7.8 in 17 starts. In truth, even his bad numbers are quite good, but the downward trajectory is cause for concern.
