Image 61 of 61 Tiago Splitter eats with former Spurs teammates Parker, Duncan, Bonner, Diaw ahead of Hawks game 1 / 61 Back to Gallery The 2015-2016 regular Spurs season tips off on Oct. 28 with a few players missing, like Tiago Splitter who was traded to the Atlanta Hawks after spending 5 years with the team.\nSplitter’s departure, in the midst of a successful off-season, was stinging for some fans but if there’s any consolation, it’s clear to see the Brazilian baller is still part of the close-knit Spurs family, via Tony Parker’s recent Twitter activity .\nThe Silver and Black is in Atlanta Hawks territory to play Splitter’s new team for the third game of their preseason on Wednesday. Social media-popular Parker took his almost 2 million followers along on the team’s journey through the south, including a meet up with their old pal and teammate on Tuesday.\n“Nice dinner in Atlanta! Miss @tiagosplitter! Great memories,” Parker tweeted with a group photo of himself, Boris Diaw, Splitter, Matt Bonner and a Green Lantern t-shirt-wearing Tim Duncan sitting around a table.\nRELATED: Australian Who Wants to be a Millionaire contestant stumped by question about Spurs, Patty Mills\nIn an earlier Twitter exchange between Diaw, Manu Ginobili and Splitter joked about buying Bobo’s new children’s’ book, Hoops to Hippos.\n“You better bring a copy to me next week,” Splitter told Diaw.\nThere’s no telling whether or not the new Hawk got his hands on a copy of Diaw’s safari tales or if they took a frogging picture for old time’s sake, but the boys looked happy to be reunited.\nThough the Spurs have five championship titles, the trip also proved they’re humble enough to be star-struck by a fellow athlete.\nParker shared a photo of the dinner party, plus Ginobili and Patty Mills, with retired Hawk, Kevin Willis.\n“With Kevin Willis! Reminds me my rookie year lol,” he said in a tweet.\nThe Spurs will face off against Splitter and the Hawks tonight at 7 p.m. to hopefully secure the first win of their preseason.\n
