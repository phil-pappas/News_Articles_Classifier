My teams must play at full throttle and take it to the limit every single game.\n\"It is important to have a playing philosophy that reflects your own mentality, reflects the club and gives you a clear direction to follow. Tactical of course, but tactical with a big heart.\n\"Liverpool has extraordinary supporters and Anfield is a world renowned home, with an incredible atmosphere. I want to build a great relationship with these supporters and give them memories to cherish.\n\"I hope we can feed off each other's energy and that we take this journey together,\" he added.\nKlopp has been joined at Liverpool by Zeljko Buvac and Peter Krawietz, his former assistants at Dortmund.\n\"In Juergen Klopp we have appointed a world-class manager with a proven track record of winning and someone who has the personality and charisma to reignite this football club and take the team forward,\" Liverpool chairman Tom Werner said.\n\"He possesses all the qualities we are looking for in a manager -- he is a strong, inspirational leader, who has a clear philosophy of high energy, attacking football. Critically, he is also a winner and someone who can connect with and enthuse our supporters.\n\"His attitude is infectious and we believe it will lift the entire club,\" Werner added.\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/AO_Sports", "https://www.facebook.com/AhramOnlineSports?fref=ts"], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T01:53:17.320+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
