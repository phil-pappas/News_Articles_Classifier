We make the younger kids sing and dance, prepare a sketch or something, when they come to the squad. \n\"We enjoy it - it's the best job in the world. \n\"It is dangerous if you relax too much of course, but also if you are over-committed. If you think about rugby all the time, in my opinion it is not good. \n\"Sunday is a big match of course but we are enjoying it. \n\"Every Monday our captain talks to us and he emphasises that we have to enjoy what we do. \n\"This week is so special, we're enjoying a lot and not having that much pressure. Maybe on Sunday we'll have pressure but that's normal.\" \nPumas squad joker Landajo trained as a chef in his amateur days but will return to Buenos Aires as a fully-fledged professional for Argentina's new Super Rugby franchise after the World Cup. \nThe spiky 27-year-old was in every ear and ruffled every head of hair whenever Ireland made a mistake in last weekend's 43-20 demolition in the quarter-finals. \nHourcade and his coaching horde have never told him to curb his enthusiasm or his cheekiness, and he believes that freedom of expression drives the Pumas' approach. \n\"The best of what we have is the team and the group,\" said Landajo. \n\"We always try to enjoy ourselves on the pitch, then reflect afterwards. Everyone is as they are in real life, no one changes. \n\"For the younger kids it is important as they don't feel pressure and I believe they play better if they don't have that pressure. \n\"In this group everyone can have fun, but also work hard. That makes the younger players do better. \n\"We come from amateur rugby, we are with our friends all the time. We didn't chase money or live with rugby, maybe that's why we feel our shirt differently.\" \nArgentina's amateur background still throws up a host of world superstars. \nLandajo chuckles when it is put to him that Juan Martin Hernandez and Juan Martin Fernandez Lobbe would fetch more than Â£100million combined in transfer fees if football stars. \n\"Yes that's true,\" said Landajo. \n\"I'm in the wrong job, I should have tried soccer! But we love this game and I hope that shows.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T00:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T20:19:57.113+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
