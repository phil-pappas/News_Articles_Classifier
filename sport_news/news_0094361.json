ESPN's NBA player rankings 1 / 34 Back to Gallery Compiling a ranked list of pro athletes is an unenviable task.\nThere's rarely a consensus, and often, there shouldn't be.\nThat said, it's never a dull exercise, especially in the social media age.\nESPN is nearing completion of its annual \"#NBARank,\" which rates the league's players all the way from No. 400 to No. 1.\nToday, ESPN released Nos. 10-6 , and lo and behold, Kawhi Leonard came in at No. 8, five spots ahead of his new teammate LaMarcus Aldridge and sandwiched in-between No. 7 Russell Westbrook and No. 9 Blake Griffin.\nRELATED: Is Kawhi Leonard really the NBA's best defender?\nBookending today's release were No. 6 Chris Paul and No. 10 Marc Gasol.\nAt 24, Leonard is the youngest player currently in the top 10, but that won't last when 22-year-old Anthony Davis makes his appearance tomorrow.\nHe'll be joined by LeBron James, Steph Curry, Kevin Durant and James Harden, though the official order is as of yet unknown.\nThe range of reactions to Leonard's placement in the NBA's hierarchy traversed the fandom spectrum from blind homerism to unabashed hater.\nLeonard is a unique case in that his most critical impact comes on defense, which, even in an era of readily available advanced metrics and stats, is still difficult to properly measure, particularly for a wing defender.\nRELATED: A look at the Spurs' roster\nFor scouts and basketball scholars and diehard hoopheads, defense is more thoughtfully understood and studied, but to the casual fan the classic counting stats — points, rebounds, assists, blocks, steals — are the alpha and omega of what defines player greatness.\nLeonard's statistical output doesn't touch the men he's surrounded by, but that speaks more to how assessment of player skills has advanced as scouts and front office executives have adopted a more enlightened approach.\nBut if the preseason has shown us anything, it's that Leonard is ready to take on a more proactive role this season, which should do well to raise the more visible aspects of his statistical profile.\nEarlier this year, Leonard spoke of higher individual aspirations.\n\"I want to be an All-Star and MVP of the regular season,\" said Leonard. \"I'm trying to be one of the greatest players so whatever level that consists of is where I want to take my game.\"\nNo. 8 in our #NBArank : @kawhileonard . pic.twitter.com/IvNFhBrfxJ\n— NBA on ESPN (@ESPNNBA) October 26, 2015 Leonard backed off those statements somewhat, though it never rang as false contrition.\nLeonard probably does notice his place on lists and in all likelihood does want his greatness to be recognized, but truthfully, there's only one item of value he's really chasing: another ring.\n\"I love the game of basketball and as long as I can do that, keep playing and try to get some more championships with the organization, I'll be happy,\" Leonard told the Express-News .\n\"I don't care about winning an MVP – the MVP doesn't mean you're the best player in the league.\"\nAnd neither, Kawhi, do these rankings.\nnmoyle@express-news.net\nTwitter: @NRMoyle", "external_links":
