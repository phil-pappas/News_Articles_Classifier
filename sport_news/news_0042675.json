One more win allows the Knights to become playoff eligible, while winning out would guarantee a postseason berth. \nAfter missing the playoffs last year, it’s been on the minds of many Kaneland players to make sure seniors such as Jake Marczuk and Mitchell Groen don’t leave the Knights program with back-to-back disappointing seasons. \nCoach Tom Fedderly challenged his group to play better and got a strong response last week, and the same will need to happen to pick up another victory, this time on their home field. \n“We’re approaching it like we do every week,” Fedderly said. “It’s senior night coming up, so that’s big for the seniors. But we’re just trying to approach it like we do every week.” \nExtra point: The Knights have missed the playoffs only twice in the past 20 seasons. \nAurora Christian (3-4) at Marmion (2-5), 7:30 p.m. today \nLast week’s results: Aurora Christian lost to St. Laurence, 63-24; Marmion lost to De La Salle, 28-7. \nThe skinny: As good of a story as it would have been for an undermanned Marmion squad to make the playoffs, it wasn’t meant to be. Senior quarterback Johnny Tate is healthy from an ankle injury and will look at this game to help leave his mark on the program. \nThere’s no doubt in coach Dan Thorpe’s mind that, even though a playoff berth isn’t possible, the team will give every amount of effort it has until the final buzzer of the Cadets’ Week 9 game against Montini. \nExtra point: This season will mark the fifth time in Thorpe’s 11-year tenure that the Cadets will fall short of the postseason. \nDe La Salle (3-4, 2-1 Chicago Catholic League Green) at St. Francis (4-3, 1-1 CCL Green), 7:30 p.m. today \nLast week’s results: De La Salle beat Marmion, 28-7; St. Francis lost to Montini, 27-8. \nThe skinny: St. Francis would like to make sure its final game doesn’t become a must-win, although it will be if the Spartans want an automatic bid into the playoffs. The Spartans and quarterback Peter Fassnacht got off to a fast start to the season, but have been slowed by some of the stronger CCL schools. \nComing off a game in which Montini imposed its will – something the unbeaten Broncos have done to every opponent this season – the Spartans will look to rebound with their air attack to become playoff eligible. \nExtra point: St. Francis will look to make it seven trips to the postseason in the past eight years, including back-to-back berths for second-year head coach Mike Fitzgerald. \nBurlington Central (0-7, 0-5 Big Northern Conference East Division) at Johnsburg (5-2, 3-2 BNC East), 7 p.m. today \nLast week’s results: Burlington Central lost to Richmond-Burton, 41-7; Johnsburg lost to Marengo, 42-19. \nThe skinny: Burlington Central hasn’t had a winless season since 1993, and it would appear a Week 9 matchup with 0-7 Rockford Christian would be the best bet to continue that run. It hasn’t been easy for coach Jason Newburger in his first season with the Rockets, but BC continues to fight through the adversity it has faced. However, the inability to finish drives has cost the Rockets all year. \nSkyhawks running back Alex Peete has rushed for 1,302 yards for the defending BNC East champs. \nExtra point: BC has been outscored 81-7 in its past two losses, to Marengo and Richmond-Burton.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T06:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T11:23:03.602+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
