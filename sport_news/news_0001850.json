Ibe, who qualifies to play for both Nigeria and England, was strongly courted by Nigeria, where his father hails from. But the winger, who has played for England at age-grade levels, turned down Super Eagles coach Sunday Oliseh’s overtures, and declared that he would pursue a Three Lions spot. Ibe’s form has been patchy since turning down his father’s country, and Hogson has now overlooked the skillful teenager. In contrast Alli, who also has a Nigerian father but has not been as strongly chased as Ibe, has enjoyed a superb start to the new season with Spurs, having joined the club from Championship side MK Dons. The 19-year-old has featured in all but one of Tottenham’s fixtures this campaign, scoring his first Premier League goal for the club in the 1-1 draw with Leicester City back in August. Leicester forward Jamie Vardy and Southampton left-back Ryan Bertrand are also included in the squad, along with fit-again Manchester United defender Phil Jones. England squad: Goalkeepers: Jack Butland (Stoke City), Joe Hart (Manchester City), Tom Heaton (Burnley). Defenders: Ryan Bertrand (Southampton), Gary Cahill (Chelsea), Nathaniel Clyne (Liverpool), Kieran Gibbs (Arsenal), Phil Jagielka (Everton), Phil Jones (Manchester United), Chris Smalling (Manchester United), John Stones (Everton). Midfielders: Dele Alli (Tottenham Hotspur), Ross Barkley (Everton), Michael Carrick (Manchester United), Adam Lallana (Liverpool), James Milner (Liverpool), Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain (Arsenal), Jonjo Shelvey (Swansea City), Raheem Sterling (Manchester City). Forwards: Danny Ings (Liverpool), Harry Kane (Tottenham Hotspur), Wayne Rooney (Manchester United), Jamie Vardy (Leicester City), Theo Walcott (Arsenal).", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T20:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T21:04:29.474+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
