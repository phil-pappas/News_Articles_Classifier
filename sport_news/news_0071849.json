San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick stands on the... The Seattle Seahawks' 20-3 win over the San Francisco 49ers wasn't perfect, but it was exactly the kind of effort they needed to move on from a disappointing 2-4 start to the season.\nThe Hawks resembled the team we've grown accustomed to seeing over the past several years. Marshawn Lynch ran through the Niners' defense with power, Russell Wilson made plays downfield despite a leaky offensive line, and the Seattle defense absolutely suffocated an impotent 49ers offense led by a bewilderingly bad Colin Kaepernick.\nSeattle outgained San Francisco 388 yards to 142 and held the Niners to just 1-of-11 on third-down conversions. Despite committing two turnovers and forcing none in return, the Hawks were never in danger of losing, even taking into account their late-game struggles this season.\nAnd yet, I can't help but wonder if some Seahawks fans watching the game felt a tinge of sadness watching Thursday night's debacle in Santa Clara.\nThey should, because the Seahawks-49ers rivalry -- for a couple of years the best in the NFL -- is officially over.\nThursday's game was borderline unwatchable at times, and the whole affair lacked the kind of electricity that used to surround any Hawks-Niners matchup. And while the two NFC West squads will continue to play twice a year, and there will probably be some good matchups down the road, the team Seahawks fans loved to hate just doesn't exist anymore.\nThe clash of personalities between head coach Jim Harbaugh and general manager Trent Baalke that forced 49ers owner Jed York to choose sides -- he chose Baalke's -- has decimated a team that once rivaled the Seahawks as one of the best franchises in the NFL.\nIt's been a swift decline from elite to rebuilding, and the Niners' fall presents a cautionary tale for Hawks fans -- or any other fan base that begins to believe that winning is a foregone conclusion.\nConsider the speed and breadth of San Francisco's collapse.\nIn 2011, Harbaugh led Mike Singletary's players to a seven-game turnaround, winning 13 games and advancing to the NFC championship game, only to lose in overtime to the eventual Super Bowl champion New York Giants.\nThe following year, Harbaugh made the gutsy call to give the reins to Kaepernick halfway through the season. It paid off, as Kaep rose to stardom while leading the Niners to within a stalled red zone drive of a Super Bowl XLVII win.\nIn 2013, San Francisco came within a Richard Sherman tip of advancing to their second straight Super Bowl. Then in 2014, with stories of dysfunction between Harbaugh and Baalke bubbling just below the surface and injuries depleting the roster, the Niners finished 8-8 despite rolling out their fancy new digs at Levi's Stadium.\nThat was before they lost players like linebackers Patrick Willis and Chris Borland, running back Frank Gore, guard Mike Iupati, tackle Anthony Davis and defensive end Justin Smith -- not to mention Harbaugh -- in one offseason.\nNow at 2-5, the Hawks' once fearsome rivals look like they need to start over, starting with the player the team anointed as the franchise quarterback after their Super Bowl defeat. When San Francisco signed Kaepernick to a six-year, $114 million deal in 2014, they seemed to have at least taken care of the most important position on the field.\nBut now, as Kaepernick fires passes every which way but at his receivers, it seems likely that San Francisco will take advantage of the team-friendly construction of that deal in order to cut ties with Kaepernick and truly start over as soon as next offseason.\nSure, Seattle's 2-4 start was bewildering for Seahawks fans, particularly after watching them blow fourth-quarter leads in all four of their losses. But after Thursday's win, and with 10 days before their next game, the 2015 season looks like it can still be salvaged.\nBut even more, the Hawks' long-term future seems much more secure than their counterparts by the Bay, with Paul Allen -- the most hands-off of hands-off owners -- calling the shots and given the harmonious relationship between GM John Schneider and head coach Pete Carroll.\nYes, the Seahawks now lack the competitive advantage they once had when paying superstars like Richard Sherman and Russell Wilson well below market value. But with players like Wilson, Sherman, Earl Thomas, Kam Chancellor, Michael Bennett, Cliff Avril and K.J. Wright secured for at least the next couple of seasons, it seems likely that Seattle will find itself pushing for a spot among the league's top teams until maybe Carroll decides to hang up his whistle.\nFor at least this year, Seattle fans can look at their once-formidable foes and remind themselves that no matter the outcome, things could be worse.\nVisit seattlepi.com for more Seattle Seahawks news .
