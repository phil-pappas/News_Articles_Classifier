Freeman's start powers Falcons 1 / 2 Back to Gallery Atlanta\nDevonta Freeman just wanted a chance.\nWow, he's sure taking advantage of it.\nDazzling as both a runner and a receiver, Freeman had another three-touchdown game for the Atlanta Falcons , who remained unbeaten with a 48-21 rout of the hapless Houston Texans on Sunday.\n\"Opportunity is everything,\" the second-year running back said.\nTaking over as the starter after rookie Tevin Coleman had a rib injury in Week 2, Freeman has six TDs in the past two games and an NFL-leading seven for the season.\nAgainst the Texans, he scored on runs of 16, 23 and 6 yards, and set up another TD with a 44-yard reception.\nFreeman played sparingly as a rookie and missed all four preseason games with a hamstring injury. Coleman got the starting job, while Freeman remained in a backup role.\nHard to see the 23-year-old going back to the bench now.\nAccording to STATS, he is the first player younger than 24 to post back-to-back games with at least three rushing touchdowns since Jim Brown in 1958. Also, Freeman is the first player since at least 1991 to score six TDs in his first two career starts.\n\"I've always believed in myself,\" he said. \"But it's hard to get a feel when you're not playing. I have to get in a rhythm, and then the confidence comes.\"\nThe Falcons are 4-0 for only the fourth time in franchise history. They won each of their first three games under new coach Dan Quinn by rallying from fourth-quarter deficits, but this one was over much sooner.\nNothing went right for the Texans (1-3). Quarterback Ryan Mallett had an awful day and was replaced by Brian Hoyer after the Falcons built a 42-0 lead.\nRams 24, Cardinals 22: Todd Gurley rushed for all but five of his 146 yards in the second half and St. Louis (2-2) held on to hand Arizona its first loss of the season. Gurley, the Rams' first-round draft pick, saw his most extensive action as a pro and his 52-yard run set up what proved to be the winning touchdown. Nick Foles threw for three touchdowns, two after Arizona turnovers, and St. Louis' defense held the Cardinals (3-1) to field goals on four of five trips inside the red zone.\nBroncos 23, Vikings 20: Brandon McManus kicked a 39-yard field goal with 1:51 left and Denver had seven sacks in the Broncos' win over Minnesota (2-2). Von Miller smothered the loose ball after T.J. Ward's sack strip of Teddy Bridgewater in the closing seconds, sealing the win for the unbeaten Broncos (4-0), who got a 72-yard touchdown run from Ronnie Hillman . Peyton Manning has led his teams to a 4-0 start seven times, most in NFL history.\nChargers 30, Browns 27: Given a second chance due to a penalty, rookie Josh Lambo kicked a 34-yard field goal as time expired, lifting San Diego to a victory against Cleveland, snapping a two-game losing streak. Lambo was wide right on a 39-yard attempt with :02 left, but Cleveland's Tramon Williams was whistled for being offside. Lambo then hit his third field goal of the game. The Browns (1-3) had tied it at 27 on Josh McCown 's one-yard pass to Gary Barnidge with 2:09 to play and a two-point conversion pass to Taylor Gabriel .\nBengals 36, Chiefs 21: Andy Dalton added to his streak of impressive games and big plays, throwing a 55-yard touchdown pass on the run, and Cincinnati stayed unbeaten. The Bengals (4-0) matched the third-best start in franchise history, two wins shy of the club record. Dalton completed 17 of 24 for 321 yards with the long touchdown pass to Brandon Tate during a scramble.\nPackers 17, 49ers 3: Aaron Rodgers passed for 224 yards and a touchdown, ran 17 yards to set up a key second-half score, and Green Bay beat hapless San Francisco for its first 4-0 start in four years. Richard Rodgers caught a nine-yard touchdown pass on the game's opening drive before Aaron Rodgers got his team going in the second half to snap a four-game losing streak to San Francisco.\nPanthers 37, Buccaneers 23: Cam Newton threw for two touchdowns and Josh Norman returned one of Carolina's four interceptions of Jameis Winston for his second TD of the season. Newton tossed scoring passes of 6 and 12 yards to Ted Ginn Jr. A week after making a game-saving interception in the end zone against New Orleans, Norman scored on a 46-yard run back and later returned a another pick 34 yards to set up a second TD. The Panthers improved to 4-0 for the first time since 2003.\nRedskins 23, Eagles 20: Kirk Cousins threw a four-yard touchdown pass to Pierre Garcon with 26 seconds left for Washington. Starting at their own 10 with a little more than six minutes remaining, the Redskins (2-2) drove 90 yards on 15 plays to take the lead for good in a back-and-forth game. Cousins finished 31-for-46 for 290 yards and no turnovers.\nBears 22, Raiders 20: Jay Cutler threw for two touchdowns and redeemed himself following an interception by helping set up a 49-yard field goal by Robbie Gould with two seconds left for Chicago. It was the Bears' first win under coach John Fox . The Raiders (2-2) grabbed the lead on a field goal by Sebastian Janikowski with just more than two minutes remaining.\nColts 16, Jaguars 13 (OT): Adam Vinatieri kicked a 27-yard field goal with 4:36 left in overtime to give Indianapolis (2-2) an NFL record-tying 15th consecutive win over a division opponent. The 1972-73 Miami Dolphins also win 15 straight. Matt Hasselbeck made his first start since November 2012 in place of the injured Andrew Luck . The Jaguars (1-3) lined up twice for field goals with six seconds left in regulation, but Jason Myers ' first attempt from 53 yards sailed wide right â€” just after the Colts had called timeout. Myers' second chance also went wide right. Then in overtime, his 48-yard attempt went wide left.", "external_links": ["http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/25/41/8738882/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/25/41/8738883/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/25/41/8738882/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/25/41/8738883/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-05T05:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T08:54:52.671+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
