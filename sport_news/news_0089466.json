Whatever that bigger part consists of, I'm going to just do what I have to do.\"\nMichael has been an afterthought since he was acquired in a trade with Seattle in early September. He's been active for only the last two games, picking up one carry in each, for a total of five yards.\nBut the Cowboys declared during the bye week that Michael would assume a greater role in a ground game that ranks No. 18 and averages 106.2 yards, down nearly 54 yards a game from the team's average at this point last season.\nNo one is saying what the team's running back by committee will look like for this weekend's game against the New York Giants. But offensive coordinator Scott Linehan said Thursday there would be no huge changes at this point, suggesting Joseph Randle would continue to start. He added that no matter what happens, Randle would continue, \"to take a good bulk of our reps.''\nWill Michael cut into those reps? Probably. But he could cut into Darren McFadden's workload even more.\n\"We'd like to get him more opportunities in the offense as opposed to limited or one short-yardage play here,'' Linehan said of Michael. \"We feel like he's ready for some more carries.\n\"C-Mike has done a good job. He's worked hard since he's been here. It takes a while to learn a new system, a new way of doing things. I think he's done a good job of doing that.''\nRandle and McFadden are more edge rushers. Michael is a more physical back who likes to run between the tackles, sort of a DeMarco Murray Lite. He looks forward to getting more carries behind the offensive line, one that has inserted rookie La'el Collins for veteran Ron Leary at left guard during the bye week.\n\"I've got to go out there and help contribute to this team,'' Michael said. \"It's a blessing to be out there, it's a blessing that, like they said, I'm going to have more carries.\n\"We'll see once Sunday gets here.\"\nLatest Cowboys analysis\nSherrington: Kool-Aid drinker Jerry Jones hasn't learned important football lesson\nBob Sturm: Examining the 2016 NFL draft from the Cowboys' perspective\nSabin: Dez not being counted out, but several factors make return vs. NYG unlikely for Cowboys star WR\nLaufenberg: Is Michael the answer?
