He unleashed a few good slap shots and took some contact that would lead you to believe he is indeed on the verge of a return.\nOn the other hand, his defense partner for much of the practice was Colin Miller , another scratch from Thursday night’s opener, which doesn’t exactly make a return tonight against the Canadiens seem all that likely.\nBut as we’ve come to know about these day-to-day injuries, we’ll have to wait and see.\n“I’m pleased that it’s getting better and every day it’s getting better,” Chara said. “Again, I wish I could give you more info or go further beyond tomorrow. But as of right now, I’m just waiting for tomorrow and I don’t want to have any setbacks, so if it keeps going like this, I’m pretty close.”\nThere is surely a greater appreciation for what Chara brings after Thursday night’s 6-2 shellacking at the hands of Winnipeg. Chara did not enjoy watching it, either.\n“It’s always hard to watch when you’re not playing, no matter what,” he said. “But I think we did some good things as well. We’ve got to take the positive . . . and obviously improve on the things we could have done better. I don’t think any team is perfect at this point of the season. We know we’ve got to keep getting better and keep improving and working hard.”\nWhat Chara does not want to do is come back too soon.\n“You don’t want to come back and be half of what you are and you’re hurting the team and, basically, hurting yourself,” the captain said.\nZac attack\nIt was lost in the second-period collapse, but Zac Rinaldo ’s first shift as a Bruin was just about everything you’d want. He threw a clean hit to avenge a check on linemate Chris Kelly , took a punch to the back of the head from Winnipeg’s Mark Stuart and then drew a penalty. The B’s didn’t score a goal on the ensuing power play, but it gave them momentum for the rest of the period.\n“I’m not going to jump a guy because he hit one of my players, but I’m going to go look for a hit to (create) that energy and that’s what I did,” Rinaldo said. “I thought I did a good job of handling that first shift. It was a real high energy first shift. We had a couple of hits, they had a couple of clean hits on us, too. I thought I did a good job of not losing my composure when my team got hit. Instead I calmed down and looked for an opportunity to regain the energy on our side.”\nIt appears Rinaldo, whose reputation precedes him, is still not getting the benefit of calls. He took a pretty good punch from Stuart with no ensuing penalty. It wasn’t until Adam Lowry tripped him in the middle of the ice that he got a call.\n“It’s tough, but at the end of the day it’s going to make me a stronger player and a more positive person,” Rinaldo said. “You just have to battle through it. I’ve been battling through it since I was in junior since I was 16 years old. I’m 25 now.\n“I want to have a good relationship with the refs. I want to be well-liked around the league, outside of hockey and in the organization. Right now, I’m battling through that. But it’s not going to stop me from being the person I am, the player I am.”\nCoach’s analysis\nAfter some video work to dissect the lopsided loss and an on-ice session of about 45 minutes, coach Claude Julien put the opening defeat in perspective.\n“It is just one game. We’re fortunate enough to play 82 of them,” he said. “I just look back to the Patriots last year when they played Kansas City and the whole world fell apart because of that. People thought it was going to be the end of their team and sure enough they bounced back. I’m not trying to compare our team to the Patriots. I’m just saying it’s one game.\n“After the first game of the season you don’t have to be assessing that it’s going to be that way the whole season. I think we have a good group of guys that’s going to get better. I think we played well enough yesterday in the first (period). If we can maintain that type of play, we may be a good team. We just have to focus on getting better.” . . .\nBefore Monday’s matinee against the Lightning, B’s president Cam Neely and general manager Don Sweeney will sign former Boston University player Travis Roy , who was paralyzed in a freak accident in 1995, to a one-day contract to commemorate the 20th anniversary of his accident. The Bruins Foundation and Alumni Association will also be presenting a $50,000 check to the Travis Roy Foundation.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T11:47:40.976+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
