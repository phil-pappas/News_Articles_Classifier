Later Sunday night, the nation's No. 9 prospect, tight end Isaac Nauta, announced he was changing his official visit from USC to Alabama .\nHe'll officially visit the weekend of Nov. 7 for the LSU game.\nNauta, a five-star recruit at the IMG Academy in Bradenton, Fla., was once committed to Florida State. Nauta has officially visited Georgia and has visits later this month for Michigan (Oct. 17) and Ole Miss (Oct. 24), per his 247Sports profile along with TCU in November.\nAlabama has commitments from tight ends Miller Forristall of Cartersville, Ga., and Brendan Scales of Ballwin, Mo., but certainly is poised to sign a third. Devin Asaisi , a four-star recruit from Concord, Calif., recently took an unofficial visit to Alabama.\nAnother five-star and national top 10 recruit reportedly has his Alabama official visit set in Allen, Texas offensive tackle Greg Little . Gerry Hamilton of ESPN reported that Little's official visit to Tuscaloosa will be on Halloween weekend, when Alabama is off.\nThe one-time Texas A&M commit, ranked as the No. 2 prospect in the country, has officially visited Auburn and Georgia, and is visiting LSU this weekend . Ole Miss is heavily in the mix for Little, who commits on Nov. 4.\n Other national top 10 prospects Alabama is in the mix for, per the 247Sports composite , include No. 1 Rashan Gary, a defensive tackle from Paramus, N.J., No. 3 Dexter Lawrence, a defensive tackle from Wake Forest, N.C., and No. 10 Derrick Brown, a defensive lineman from Buford, Ga.\nThe state of Alabama has three prospects ranked in the top 20 - No. 13 Lyndell Wilson , a linebacker from Carver-Montgomery, No. 16 Ben Davis , a linebacker from Gordo and defensive end Marlon Davidson from Greenville, who checks in at No. 19. All are five-star prospects.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/inauta18/status/653378852509589506", "https://twitter.com/HamiltonESPN/status/653279827076718592", "http://247sports.com/Season/2016-Football/CompositeRecruitRankings?InstitutionGroup=HighSchool", "http://247sports.com/Player/Isaac-Nauta-26511", "http://www.nola.com/recruiting/index.ssf/2015/09/lsu_to_receive_a_visit_from_na_1.html"], "published": "2015-10-12T09:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T07:54:03.571+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
