After wrapping up the win over Vekic, Hibino shook her head in disbelief and waved to supporters.\nVekic, who is ranked 137th after a disappointing season, drops to 1-3 in career WTA finals, with her last win coming at the 2014 Malaysian Open. It was her second appearance in a Tashkent final after losing in 2012 to Irina-Camelia Begu of Romania in straight sets.\nEarlier Saturday, the Russian duo of Margarita Gasparyan and Alexandra Panova won the doubles final 6-1, 3-6, 10-3 against Russia's Vera Dushevina and Czech player Katerina Siniakova.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T00:28:06.561+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
