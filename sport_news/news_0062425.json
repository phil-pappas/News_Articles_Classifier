The victory allowed the Grizzlies (9-2-1, 5-0 MWL) to keep pace with Springfield heading into Saturday's showdown in Eugene, but Ashland will play that game shorthanded after a pair of yellow cards were issued to starters Stenley Graham and Jahnoi Hall on Tuesday. As per OSAA rules, Graham, Ashland's leading scorer, and Hall both must sit out Saturday. Against Eagle Point, Rollins combined with Kip Parowski (one goal) to provide all of Ashland's scores, while Jade Boucher and Graham dished out assists. Miguel Robledo and Lucas Gomez tallied goals for the Eagles (7-5, 2-3), who trailed 2-1 at the break. Ashland, which was No. 6 in the OSAA power rankings as of Tuesday night, has already clinched a spot in the 16-team Class 5A state tournament. Springfield (7-3-2, 5-0), which was ranked 15th Tuesday night, has won three straight and five of its last six. Girls Soccer At Eagle Point, Lilli Patton had two goals and an assist and Ashland rebounded from its first loss of the season with a convincing 6-0 victory over Eagle Point on Tuesday at Eagle Point High School. Calysta Susu-Mago added two goals for the Grizzlies, who improved to 8-1-4 overall and 3-1-1 heading into their regular-season finale Saturday at Springfield. Olivia West scored two goals for Eagle Point (2-7-4, 0-4-1). Ashland has yet to clinch an automatic berth into the Class 5A state tournament, but can increase its chances with a win Saturday. The Grizzlies, who were No. 8 in the OSAA power rankings Tuesday night, can also increase their chances of hosting a first-round playoff game. The top two teams in the final MWL standings earn an automatic berth to the state tournament, while the league's third- through sixth-place teams qualify for the play-in round, which will take place on or before Oct. 31. College Cross Country The Southern Oregon men's cross country team was voted the Cascade Conference Adidas team of the week, Ray Schireman was voted the league's Red Lion men's runner of the week and SOU women's soccer goalkeeper Kylie Moltzen was named the league's defender of the week. Schireman won the 8,000-meter Lewis & Clark Invitational at McIver Park on Saturday, besting 125 other runners to take his first-ever collegiate victory in 24 minutes, 52.3 seconds. Schireman's win helped SOU, which is ranked No. 1 in the NAIA, take the team title. Moltzen had seven saves in the Raiders' 1-0 win Friday over Oregon Tech, SOU's fifth straight road victory. It was her third solo shutout of the season. College Football Southern Oregon held firm at No. 2 behind top-ranked Lindsey Wilson (Ky.) for the fourth week in a row in the NAIA Top 25 coaches' poll, released Monday.
