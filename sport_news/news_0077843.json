(Photo: AP) \nMINNEAPOLIS — Minnesota coach Richard Pitino is defending his embattled father, Rick Pitino, as allegations swirl around the Louisville program that a former staffer paid escorts to have sex with former recruits and players. \nRichard Pitino spoke at Minnesota’s media day Wednesday. He says he had no knowledge of the allegations while he was an assistant at Louisville and also says he knows his father had no knowledge, either. \nKatina Powell wrote a book that alleges former staffer Andre McGee paid her and several other women to party with recruits and players from 2010-2014. \nRichard Pitino was the associate head coach at Louisville for the 2011-12 season. He says the allegations were “very surprising.” \nRick Pitino has denied knowledge of the activities that Powell alleges in her book. \nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
