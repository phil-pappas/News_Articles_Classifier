Milne Field. \nJacksonville University raced to a 20-point lead in the third quarter, then had to hang on to beat Morehead State 30-26 on Saturday at D.B. Milne Field. \nJU’s offense gained 655 yards in 86 plays, including another 300-yard passing game by quarterback Kade Bell. The running game was also solid, led by newcomer Jamal Adjamah’s 163 yards and another 118 from Ulysses Bryant. Still, as in previous games, the Dolphins had to hold on for the victory. \nWhile JU (4-0, 2-0) is the lone remaining unbeaten team in the Pioneer League, the Dolphins have won all four of their games by six points or less. \nMorehead State (2-3, 1-1) trailed 30-14, but scored in the final seconds of the third quarter and added two field goals in the fourth, the latter with 4:48 to play. But MSU never got the ball again as JU controlled the ball the rest of the way. \n“Even though we’re not hitting our full potential there, we’re finding a way to get it done,’’ said JU coach Kerwin Bell. “Right now we’re so beat up, we’re glad for any win we can get.” \nIn the first half, it appeared JU was on its way to its first comfortable win. The offense marched up and down the field, accumulating 448 yards by halftime. But the Dolphins only had 24 points to show for all that offense. \nAfter two missed field goals, JU took control on a pair of touchdowns by Bryant — the first a 35-yard pass from Bell, the other a 15-yard scoring run. Bell also had a 44-yard touchdown pass to Emoni Williams as JU led 24-7 at the half. \nBrandon Behr added two field goals in the second half and the Dolphins, bolstered by a strong running game, held on for the victory. \nPerhaps the biggest surprise in the game was the running of Adjamah. He gained 126 yards in nine carries in the first half. It was the most action the sophomore from Miami has seen all year. \n“The line did a great job in blocking out on the ends and that made it easy to get to the end and head up field,” Adjamah said. \nMorehead State quarterback Austin Gahafer completed 32 of 53 passes for 324 yards and three touchdowns, all to Justin Cornwall, who caught 12 passes in the game for 93 yards. \nKade Bell finished 22 of 45 for 345 yards, while the running game piled up 304 yards in 41 carries. In addition to his 118 yards rushing, Bryant (Nease High) had 93 yards receiving.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T04:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T16:33:59.981+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
