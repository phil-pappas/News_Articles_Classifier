The scholarship will be presented to the recipients upon their graduation in hopes of encouraging future leaders to step forward.\n\"Kristy was so young, but she made such an incredible impact. She was so well-respected for her leadership skills and so well-liked. This scholarship is meant to recognize the people who have the same qualities that she displayed,\" said Heather Christie, a childhood friend of Wesselman and an organizer of the scholarship.\nChristie said the scholarship is one way to find some \"good in a situation that doesn't have anything good about it.\"\nThe scholarship is being funded by members of the Glenbard South High School class of 1988, which is the class Wesselman would have graduated with, as well as members of other classes from the late 1980s who remember their slain classmate, Christie said. The first check will be presented in 2016 to the graduate who served as student body president.\nBridget King, another friend of Wesselman's, said Kristy was, in part, remembered as a leader, and the scholarship will be an encouragement for students to develop their leadership skills at an early age.\nKristy Wesselman, Glenbard South High School, scholarship\nIn the summer of 1985, Wesselman, who had just completed her freshman year, was murdered on a wooded path close to her home near Butterfield Road and Route 53. The case has remained unsolved for the past 30 years, but earlier this month, 62-year-old Michael Jones of Champaign was charged with her murder and rape. Jones was charged after providing a DNA sample in an unrelated aggravated domestic battery case. That DNA matched DNA from the 1985 murder scene, officials said.\nGlenbard South alumni want to raise $10,000, which will fund the scholarship for the next decade, King said. Any additional money that might be raised after the initial goal is met will be used to provide some support for the Wesselman family during the trial. Currently, the classmates have raised about $2,000, but King said pledges for additional funds have been made.\n\"There are a lot of alumni out there who want to feel productive and provide some help,\" King said.\nThe memorial scholarship is not a new one. Following Wesselman's death in 1985, her family provided $500 to three students in her memory. The first recipient was Dr. Robert Dieter, a cardiologist who works at the Edward Hines Jr. VA Hospital in Hines. Dieter was one of the driving forces in helping resurrect the scholarship, Christie said.\nKing said Glenbard South alumni supporting the scholarship settled on the $1,000 award after using an inflation calculator to determine what $500 in 1985 would be worth today.\nKing and Christie said the trial is sure to dredge up a lot of memories of the murder and the fear that swept through Glen Ellyn that long-ago summer. Christie, now an attorney in Florida, said news of the arrest brought her back to being 15 years old and remembering all the fun times she had with Wesselman. King agreed, saying the murder was a pivotal and defining moment of their lives.\n\"We remember the tragedy of her death so well. This is important for those who were involved with Kristy. She was a beautiful person, and it's important that she's remembered,\" King said.\nAlex Keown is a freelance reporter.\ntriblocaltips@tribune.com\nTwitter: @TribLocal\nCopyright Â© 2015, Chicago Tribune High Schools", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-5622febd/turbine/ct-gle-glenbard-south-kristy-wesselman-scholarship-tl-1022-20151017", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-5623094c/turbine/ct-scholarship-re-established-in-memory-of-1985-murder-victim-20151017"], "published": "2015-10-17T20:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T06:44:29.635+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
