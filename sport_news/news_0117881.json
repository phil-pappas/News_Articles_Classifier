The Clemson Tigers played host to the Appalachian State Mountaineers at Memorial Stadium in Clemson Saturday, September 12, 2015. ¬ GWINN DAVIS / FOR POST AND COURIER ¬ × CLEMSON – Two years was vindicating for Clemson’s defensive line, going from much-maligned to leading the nation in tackles for a loss. Now it’s the offensive line’s turn to feel accomplished. Clemson’s front five blockers were one of 14 lines listed by the Joe Moore Award honor roll. “Well, I think that’s a good thing,” head coach Dabo Swinney said after Wednesday’s practice. “Means they’ve played well the first six games. Better than being on the not-so-good list.” Center Jay Guillermo has won the past two ACC Offensive Lineman of the Week awards, freshman left tackle Mitch Hyatt has played well in his first year on campus, and senior left guard Eric Mac Lain has led a unit rounded out by right guard Tyrone Crowder and right tackle Joe Gore. “Those boys have done pretty good, and are only going to get better,” Swinney said. “They like to play, and they’re developing toughness and passion for what they’re doing. They haven’t been perfect, but they’ve been pretty doggone good.” Clemson is averaging 181.5 yards a game, about 35 yards’ improvement from last year, and the Tigers’ yards-per-carry (4.41) is up nearly a full yard. Clemson has also yielded 29 tackles for loss, tied for 18th-fewest nationally. Eleven of the 14 teams with offensive lines on the Joe Moore honor roll are ranked in this week’s Associated Press top 25. Norton not ready The season’s Opening Day starter at center, senior Ryan Norton, has missed the past four games with a knee injury, and might miss a fifth Saturday at Miami. “He can play, but I still don’t think he’s quite 100 percent, so we’ll play him if we have to,” Norton said. “He’s gaining confidence every single day cutting and changing direction and bending and really grinding on it, but he’ll go in as the backup.” Norton wore a green no-contact jersey in practice this week, taking part in scout and team work but no specific contact drills. Guillermo has served as his replacement. “If we get the opportunity to get (Norton) in there, we will,” Swinney said. “We don’t have a set plan going in. It’ll be a reaction to what’s going on in the game.” Freak show Swinney lauded the defensive depth of Miami, specifically commenting sophomore defensive end Chad Thomas (6-5, 275) and sophomore linebacker Al-Quadin Muhammad (6-4, 256) “are freaky-looking.” “I’ll be really surprised if we don’t look up in another year or so,” Swinney said, “and those guys aren’t great players at Miami.” Muhammad is second on the Hurricanes with three sacks, and Thomas leads Miami with three pass deflections.
