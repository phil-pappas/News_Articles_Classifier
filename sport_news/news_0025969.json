The Wizards and Wildcats claimed all seven titles over Thompson Valley in the Class 4A Regional finals. “We had a really good bounce-back day after a disappointing day on Thursday,” said Greeley Central coach Dave Mamich, whose team finished second with 61 points, six behind champion Windsor. Thompson Valley, the first-day leader, was third with 56 points, followed by Northridge (18), University High (13) and Mountain View (7). Windsor beat Thompson Valley four all four doubles titles to squeak into first place in Chris Minear’s first season as the head coach. “The performances of our kids was above and beyond what we expected,” Minear said. “This is the best we’ve done at regionals.” The Windsor No. 1 doubles team of Blake Pendleton and Matt McManigal started the run to the title with a hard-fought title match victory over Thompson Valley’s Landon Lees and Jake Madden 7-6 (7-4 in the tie-breaker), 5-7, 7-6 (7-3 in the tie-breaker). The teams of Nathan Tucker and Jacob Liberty, Clay Grave and Jackson Cline and Andrew Fischer and Kieran Joe followed suit as the Winzards swept the doubles competition. Greeley Central, a sixth-place finisher in last year’s state meet matched the Wizards by winning all three singles titles. Connor Clancy won the No. 1 singles title over Thompson Valley’s Tony Klagge while Alex Adams and Walker Uyemura followed suit. In a playback match, the Wildcats’ No. 4 doubles team of Noah Brown and Laren Lesser beat Thompson Valley’s Aeneas DeLuca and Johnathan Szwaja 6-3, 1-6, 7-6 to punch its ticket to the state meet, Thursday through Saturday at Pueblo’s City Park. “With that doubles team getting in, we are now eligible to compete as a team at the state meet,” Mamich explained. “Today was a really good competitive day for Greeley Central and Windsor.” Clancy, Adams and Uyemura will be making a return trip to the state tournament.
