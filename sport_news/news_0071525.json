Madelyn LaFevers leads Boyle County with 22. \nIt was the fourth straight meeting between the two programs in the region finals. West Jessamine won the previous three. \nThe Colts had ended the Rebels' season the previous four years. In 2011, the two teams met in the second round of the state tournament and West Jessamine won 1-0 in double overtime. \nThe Colts finished the year at 15-7-2. \nThe Rebels (21-2-2) reached 20 wins for the first time since 2008 with their 8-0 rout of Somerset on Wednesday. \nBoyle County hosts Lexington Catholic in the first round of the state tournament at 7 p.m. Tuesday. That winner will meet either Estill County or Corbin on Saturday at a yet-to-be-determined time and site.
