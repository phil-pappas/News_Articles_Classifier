But the shot, a cross between a runner and a floater, is nearing the end of the experimentation stage.\n“I haven’t used it yet. I’ll pick my spots with it,” said Thomas, who isn’t just doing this as a lark.\nHe worked on the shot for a good 30 minutes before games in Brooklyn on Wednesday and at Madison Square Garden last night.\nGive me a ring\nNot that he’s obsessed with this as he blends into a new team, but David Lee has to decide how to get his championship ring from Golden State.\n“I won’t be able to go out there for opening night because we play the next day in Boston,” he said. “It’s more important for me to be ready for opening night with this team. I haven’t discussed that yet. We don’t play there until April 1, so it might be sometime around there. I don’t know, maybe they can ship it to me.”\nLee, a Cardinals fan, ended up on the wrong side of a locker room debate when St. Louis was eliminated by the Cubs in four games in the National League Division Series.\nBrad Stevens , a Cubs fan, was very strategic with his bragging rights.\n“Brad Stevens and some of the other guys are Cubs fans, though some of the guys on the staff are Cardinals fans. We have a major grudge match going,” said Lee. “When we won Game 1, I was kind of surprised, because Brad didn’t start a group chat until Game 2 when the Cubs evened the series.\n“But the Cubs are the better team. It kills me to say that.”\nA Smart approach\nMarcus Smart spent the week back home nursing strep throat, though by yesterday the point guard’s condition had improved.\n“Marcus felt better,” said Stevens. “He had strep, so there was no reason to fly him here. He went in for a workout this afternoon, and if he feels good tomorrow he’ll practice. But we’re going to be very careful, because that can rear its head back at you if you don’t stop it. We want him to be fully healthy.”\nTerry Rozier , who missed his second straight game last night with a left knee bone bruise, shot around at yesterday’s shootaround, with positive results.\n“I’m practicing tomorrow,” he said.\nMatch game\nOne benefit from this season’s emerging Celtics makeup — a deep roster of players capable of playing multiple positions — will be the ability to shift matchups against various teams. But for now Stevens prefers to work on his combinations.\n“They will eventually (dictate lineups),” the Celtics coach said of planning for matchups. “But right now I’m not even paying attention to them. I might throw Tyler ( Zeller ) in against a certain guy like Brook Lopez early in a game, I might throw David (Lee) or Kelly ( Olynyk ) on a wing who is playing the stretch 4 to have them practice against that. That’s where we are right now in the preseason, but it will play a role when it’s all said and done.\n“If we’re struggling to guard someone because of whatever they’re doing, and we can’t take advantage of it in the offensive end, then we’re going to change. You can never be too flexible. It’s the value of the Jae Crowder and Jonas Jerebkos who can play multiple positions, frontcourt of backcourt.”\nYoung ways\nThough James Young went into last night’s game still looking for a breakout, the coach continues to rave about the second-year swingman’s defense.\n“It’s night and day from when he came in,” said Stevens. “There’s a lot of competition back there for playing time, and he’s getting more confident. He’s working on his ballhandling, works on his shooting and defensively I think the game has slowed down quite a bit for him.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T07:38:27.181+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
