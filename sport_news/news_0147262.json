Evans finished second on the team with nine tackles and added two tackles for loss and a sack. Most important, Evans recovered a fumble from West Virginia QB Skyler Howard and returned it 41 yards for a touchdown. The score, which occurred early in the fourth quarter, pushed Oklahoma's lead to 17 points and effectively killed the Mountaineers' chances of coming back. Oklahoma eventually won 44-24 to move into the top 10 of the Associated Press poll.\nHonorable mention: LB Montrel Wilson , TCU (13 tackles, 1.5 TFLs, 1 sack); S Denzel Johnson , TCU (5 tackles, 1.5 TFLs, PBU, QB hurry); S Orion Stewart, Baylor (10 tackles, forced fumble, fumble recovery); LB Eric Striker, Oklahoma (9 tackles, 3 TFLs, 2 sacks, FF); LB Taylor Young , Baylor (8 tackles, 7 solo, 2.0 TFLs)\nFollow Shehan Jeyarajah on Twitter: @ShehanJeyarajah\nOn Twitter:\n @ShehanJeyarajah", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/ShehanJeyarajah"], "published": "2015-10-05T06:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T13:00:57.445+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
