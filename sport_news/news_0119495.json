He underwent surgery 28 years ago to remove a tumor on his spine. \nPhoenix drafted Walk after losing the coin flip with Milwaukee to draft Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (then Lew Alcindor). \nWalk averaged 20.2 points and 12.4 rebounds in the 1972-73 season. Charles Barkley is the only other Sun to top the 20-point, 10-rebound average. \nWalk also played for the New Orleans Jazz and New York Knicks in his eight-year NBA career. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T21:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T22:35:51.424+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
