She was like, ‘Do you think he would wanna take a picture with me?’”Ronda says she assured her sister that Bieber would be willing. But when she approached the pop star and asked if he would take a photo with Julia, instead of nicely obliging, Bieber allegedly told her, “I’ve already taken a billion pictures today, OK? A billion.”Before she could plead with him any further, he walked away and left her sister on the verge of tears.“Yeah, I don’t think I’d wanna hang out with him,” Ronda says. “I’m not a Belieber. I was, but not anymore.” \nCopyright   9:47AM", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T16:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T05:55:44.860+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
