Expectations are pretty much World Series-or-bust for that franchise and the ownership group that’s poured millions of dollars into winning a championship, and the team hasn’t delivered under Mattingly. The Dodgers haven’t even made the World Series, much less won the whole thing. Whether or not that’s his fault isn’t necessarily even relevant, so he’s done.\nMORE: Every MLB team's worst manager\nWhat next? The team’s next manager will inherit a squad with lots of talent, but also lots of question marks (this was going to be a busy offseason in L.A. even before this news). Dodgers director of baseball operations Andrew Friedman has only hired one manager in his career, back when he was running Tampa Bay. His choice that time: Joe Maddon.\nHere are six names you’ll hear connected to the job in the coming days.\n1. Bud Black\n© Provided by Sporting News Since he was let go by the Padres 65 games into the 2015 season, Black’s name has been atop the wish list for every fan base with a managerial opening.\nThe Dodgers should be no different.\nBlack obviously has a ton of familiarity with the organization, as the manager of the division-rival Padres for eight-and-a-half years, and he has an excellent reputation. If he wants, he’ll be a manager again somewhere in 2016. The Dodgers, a team on the precipice of greatness, seem to be a good fit for Black, who dealt with a, let’s call it “thrifty” organization in San Diego for so many years. The idea of having a front office that’s incredibly motivated to bring home a World Series title has to be appealing.\n2. Tim Wallach\n© Provided by Sporting News It’s not like this Dodgers team needs a major shakeup (not that the payroll would make that an easy thing anyway), so it’s conceivable that the front office looks to stay in-house.\nWallach has been with the Dodgers since 2011, as Mattingly’s third-base coach the first three seasons and as the bench coach since. Before that, he was the franchise’s Triple-A manager in Albuquerque for a couple seasons (he won the Pacific Coast League’s manager of the year award in 2009). Oh, and he played for the team for four seasons late in his career.\nSo, yes, he’s pretty familiar with the franchise and the players on the current roster.\n3. Dave Martinez\n© Provided by Sporting News We’re just going to cut-and-paste this from a previous list of managerial candidates: “We’ve said it before and we’ll say it again (if he doesn’t get this gig) — Martinez will one day be a fantastic major-league manager and will make the GM who hires him look incredibly wise. He’s served a long apprenticeship learning the intricacies of the job under Joe Maddon, both in Tampa Bay and in Chicago.”\nYep, still applicable. Martinez would be an excellent hire in Los Angeles, and one L.A. decision-maker Andrew Friedman wouldn't be afraid to choose. Remember, Friedman's very familiar with Martinez from their time together with the Rays. Martinez was Joe Maddon's bench coach from 2007 until 2014, when Friedman was running things in the Tampa Bay front office.\n4. Gabe Kapler\n© Provided by Sporting News Again, another potential candidate with a high level of familiarity with the Dodgers, though his is of a different variety — he’s currently the director of player development for the franchise. Kapler, who turned 40 in July, has quite the diverse resume of baseball life experiences.\nHe played for the Tigers, Rangers, Rockies and Red Sox during the first phase of his playing career, then retired and managed the Single-A Greenville Drive for a season. He came back out of retirement after one year, in 2008, and hit .301 with the Brewers, then played two seasons for the Rays before again retiring the next spring (with the Dodgers, actually). Since that point, he coached in the World Baseball Classic and did TV work before the Dodgers hired him for his current role.\nHe’s long been thought of as a potential major-league manager, though this would be quite a challenging first job in the bigs.\n5. Dusty Baker\n© Provided by Sporting News Baker wants back into baseball as a manager. He’s made that abundantly clear — he reportedly called the Padres about their opening and was told, essentially, “Thanks but no thanks” — and the Dodgers’ job would obviously be appealing, with the level of talent the next manager would inherit.\nAnd on some levels, Baker, 66, makes sense. He’s been around and seen everything, so the limelight of L.A. wouldn’t be an issue. And he’s a players manager who would, at least theoretically, be able to handle a Dodgers clubhouse that can need delicate handling. He was a standout outfielder with the team for eight years during his career, too.\nStill, he's very much a longshot.\n6. Ron Roenicke\n© Provided by Sporting News Like Wallach, Roenicke would represent a bit of bench continuity. Though, not nearly as much continuity as Wallach — Roenicke has only been with the Dodgers since mid-August. Roenicke began the season as the Brewers manager (it was his fifth with the club) but was fired in early May after a bumpy start to the season. Roenicke’s first season in Milwaukee produced 96 wins, but that total fell to 83, then to 74 and to 82 in 2014 (they spent most of the season in first place in the NL Central before collapsing down the stretch).\nHe was hired by the Dodgers to take over the duties as the team’s third-base coach down the stretch, which means director of baseball operations Andrew Friedman clearly thinks highly of him. If you’re looking for a hint as to how Friedman might be leaning, maybe that’s a clue to consider.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.sportingnews.com/mlb-news/4658937-don-mattingly-fired-dodgers-manager-marlins-andrew-friedman?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "http://www.sportingnews.com/", "http://www.sportingnews.com/list/4657244-worst-baseball-managers-ever-all-time-rankings-ratings"], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T04:04:11.516+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
