They want one and then the zero. They could care less about five. They want one and then the zero,\" Parkland coach Al Haddad said. \n\"Our entire team starts defensively,\" Haddad added. \"That's all we focus on is defense. Because if we're not in the game, we're never going to be in the game. We have got to keep the zero on the board as long as we can. So I'm really proud of them.\" \nRELATED: Parkland goalkeeper Regan Allsop talks about win over Whitehall (VIDEO) \nOn senior night, Parkland senior goalkeeper Regan Allsop and senior defender Jenn Guetzlaff both helped the Trojans continue the streak. \nAllsop made three saves, including a nice stop on Whitehall's Kylee Cunningham with 2:15 left in the first half. \n\"I definitely have to credit my defense,\" Allsop said. \"They work so hard to keep other teams' forwards from getting shots off. So I really have to credit them. But I know if there is a shot off, I know I have to handle that myself. But most of the credit goes to them.\" \n\"Regan's really good in goal,\" Whitehall coach Dave Weitzman said. \"She's been a very experienced goalkeeper. She does a good job of commanding the penalty box. Their backs are quick. So they don't give up a lot of opportunities. So I think the opportunities teams get against them, they've got to cash in on them because they're not going to get too many.\" \nGuetzlaff stepped out of her defensive role to put the Trojans up 1-0 with 21:21 left in regulation. After a Whitehall handball inside the penalty box, Guetzlaff connected on a penalty kick to give Parkland its first of five second-half goals. \nBut just like the rest of the team, Guetzlaff is more worried about defense. \n\"It's our focus of the entire team,\" Guetzlaff said. \"Defending isn't just in the back. We defend as an entire unit. So defending starts in the forwards and then it moves back. If the forwards aren't letting the balls come through, we don't really have much to do.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T12:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T02:53:33.727+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
