Look for solo gigs by Jason Bible and strong lineups elsewhere\nJason Bible is obviously still best known as the frontman for The Train Wrecks, but last week’s solo gig at the Gingerbread House displayed his sheer talent as a songwriter and performer.\nThe attendance at the Gingerbread House topped 100, and the room sounded great. I don’t know if the venue, which is typically used for weddings and other more formal events, will open itself more often to musicians, but it’s a tantalizing possibility.\nIf you missed that show, never fear. You have more chances to see Bible solo.\nMost notably, Bible will be one of the four artists in the Savannah Songwriters Series at 6 p.m. Oct. 4 at Johnny Harris Restaurant on Victory Drive. The showcase also includes Claude Diamond, Jefferson Ross and Sarah Tollerson.\nThe Savannah Songwriters Series is the first Sunday of each month at Johnny Harris — and it’s free.\nBible’s website ( www.jasonbiblemusic.com ) also lists an upcoming show at The Warehouse Bar and Grill on River Street on Oct. 5, with dates later in the month at Molly MacPherson’s Scottish Pub on Congress Street and Foxy Loxy Print Gallery and Café on Bull Street.\nReally, I cannot recommend Bible’s solo show highly enough. And if you make it to one of those upcoming gigs, you will probably be able to buy a copy of Jason’s excellent new solo CD.\nThe upcoming weekend obviously features all sorts of other options, including an impressive lineup at Barrelhouse South, 125 W. Congress St.\nThe popular Birmingham band Pigeons Playing Ping Pong hit Barrelhouse on Oct. 1, Magenta Sunshine from Asheville performs on Oct. 2 and Herd of Watts from Jacksonville takes the stage Oct. 3.\nMagenta Sunshine is fronted by Lenny Pettinelli, whom Savannah-based drummer Daniel Malone calls “a world-class pianist.” Malone notes that Pettinelli was one of the favorite guest artists that performed with his band Les Racquet, which has recently taken a hiatus.\nIn addition to the show at Barrelhouse, Malone will be joining Pettinelli and his ensemble for gigs Oct. 1 at Tybee Island Social Club and Oct. 3 at The Warehouse.\nBill Dawers writes City Talk in the Savannah Morning News and blogs at Savannah Unplugged (billdawers.com) and hissing lawns (hissinglawns.com).
