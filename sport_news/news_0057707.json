An ‘unidentified’ caller from Australia came out in the open on his own stating he had sent money for the treatment of the injured in the police firing and lathicharge. Identifying himself as Sukhjit Singh of Kotkapura village in Faridkot and settled in Melbourne for the past eight years, the caller said he was willing to face any investigation as he had sent money to two other injured persons also. He expressed dismay at the accusation of funding anti-social elements to disturb the peace and harmony in the state. The caller, whose call transcripts with main accused Rupinder Singh in the Bargari village sacrilege incident were released by police yesterday, appeared on Australian radio ‘Qaumi Awaz’. He later sent the audio clip of his statement to some mediapersons here. Police officials were not available for reaction on the claims of Sukhjit Singh. ADGP IPS Sahota, who heads the Special Investigation Team probing the incidents, said in the morning that the investigation was on and all mysteries would be cleared. However, the official could not be contacted in the evening. Sukhjit said in the audio statement that he was shocked when his sister messaged him that the police had traced the call from his number. The phone number was published in some newspapers today. “I was shocked. We had sent money to two other persons Ajit Singh and Beant Singh injured in police action against protesters. As Rupinder had suffered a back injury, we wanted to send money to him through someone trustworthy,” said Sukhjit. “It was purely on humanitarian grounds,” he said. He insisted that he was pained at the incidents of sacrilege and the police action against peaceful protesters. “We could only help the injured by giving them money for treatment. That was our only motive. The police are welcome to investigate our role,” he said. Deputy Chief Minister Sukhbir Singh Badal and ADGP Sahota had claimed before the media yesterday that the whole conspiracy had been cracked with the interception of these calls.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T04:14:47.171+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
