Game: North Paulding (1-7, 1-4) at Marietta (1-6, 0-3), 7:30 p.m.Last year: North Paulding 42, Marietta 41All-time series: North Paulding leads 1-0Prediction: Marietta 31, North Paulding 28Marietta has the same number of wins as North Paulding this season, but the Blue Devils still don’t have a win in Region 4 . They hope to change that tonight when the struggling Wolfpack visit Northcutt Stadium.“I really do feel like we are on the verge of breaking through and, hopefully, this week is the time for that to happen,” Marietta coach Scott Burton said.After last week’s results, both teams are also in the midst of three-game losing streaks since Marietta (1-6, 0-3) lost to North Cobb and North Paulding (1-7, 1-3) fell to McEachern.“Defensively, I don’t think we have played poorly,” Burton said. “I know it looks like we are giving up a lot of points, but a lot of that is the offense turning the ball over or not holding up its end of the bargain. Defensively, at times, we have been very good and, at other times, we’ve been good enough. We’ve got to continue to make improvements in causing more turnovers and getting off the field on third down.”Even though the Wolfpack haven’t had much success this season, they are still a threat offensively with highly touted players D.J. Owens (wide receiver), Dylan Autenrieth (tight end) and Kyle Banks (quarterback).“They present a lot of challenges because of what they do from a scheme perspective,” Burton said. “They’ve got some very good players who are Division I recruits and also, from a scheme perspective, offensively, they play with an up-tempo style. They spread you out and try to exploit matchups in space, so we’ve got to be very disciplined and tackle really well.”Burton is also impressed with North Paulding’s run defense.Last year, the game was decided in the closing seconds, and the Wolfpack won 42-41.“We scored late and chose to go for two and did not convert, so we went for the win and not the tie,” Burton said. “We always want to instill in our players an aggressive, attacking mindset and not just in football but in life — good things don’t come to people who sit back and wait for them to happen.” Share This Article | similar stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T06:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T08:53:07.114+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
