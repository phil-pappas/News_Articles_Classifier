Lacey Peterson / Union Democrat, Copyright 2015. Tuolumne County centenarians and those nearing 100 years old were honored Wednesday at a lunch at the Tuolumne County Senior Center. Thirteen people received certificates and another 17 who couldn’t attend will get theirs by mail, said Cathie Peacock of the Tuolumne County Commission on Aging, which hosted the lunch. Support was also provided by Sierra Senior Providers, Tuolumne County Senior Center, Kiwanis Club of Sonora, Ray’s Trophies, Leadership Tuolumne Seniors and Women of the Moose. Several private donations were made to help put on the event, and individuals volunteered at the lunch. Friends, family and caregivers attended the lunch to celebrate the newest admissions to the Centenarian Society. The centenarians (100 or older) were presented with certificates, and their names will be entered on the Centenarian Society’s wall plaque at the Senior Center. Additionally, those who are in the “University of Life” were acknowledged and given certificates of life achievement. Those people are 96 years old (freshmen), 97, (sophomores), 98 (juniors) and 99 (seniors). This is the seventh year the lunch has been held. Centenarians who attended the event included Lois For kner, of Sonora, who was accompanied by her son, Jack Forkner, of Copperopolis. Forker is a longtime local resident and was a homemaker who raised four sons. She said she never thought she’d live to be 100. That sentiment was echoed by other peers. Centenarian Joe Quintel, of Sonora Meadows, has lived in Tuolumne County for 37 years. He retired from U.S. Steel in Alameda. He was in the U.S. Army’s 82nd paratrooper division. He said being 100 “feels great, as long as you have your marbles.” Wednesday was Quintel’s 100th birthday, and the crowd of about 50 sang him “Happy Birthday.” Centenarian Jack Warnack is well known locally — he still works full time at Kerr Roofing in Sonora and last year was president of Twain Harte Rotary Club. He was the oldest Rotary president in the world and didn’t miss a Rotary meeting for 38 years. “Who the hell is healthy?” Warnack said. “Every piece in me is put back together.” Warnack was a former professional gymnast and decorator-turned-general contractor. He now does bids for his family business. Carrie “Betty” Joy, of Sonora, attended the lunch with friends Gary Walter and Shirley Combs, of Columbia. Joy and her late husband, Earnie Joy, bought Hunt’s Lodge in Twain Harte in 1967 and owned it until 1976. Joy was the waitress, chef and baker. She is a charter member of the Moose Lodge 1728 in Sonora and has been a member for 39 years. Sonora resident Jewel Guhl turned 100 in March. She said she never thought she’d make it to 100. Guhl began work at J.C. Penney in 1956 in Oakland and, after moving to Concord in 1963, continued to work for the company. In 1968, after her children were grown, she and her husband moved to Sonora. Guhl worked at J.C. Penney in Sonora until her retirement in 1978. Her husband died in 1978. In the 1980s, she joined the First Presbyterian Church of the 49ers in Columbia, where she continues to be an active member. Guhl used to volunteer in the gift shop at Sonora Community Hospital and continues to do volunteer work by knitting hats for premature babies. After she completes 20 hats, they are picked up by a hospital volunteer for distribution at the Sonora Regional Medical Center Birth Center. Her hobbies include baking, sewing, knitting and crocheting, and flower-pot gardening. Guhl attributes her longevity to “cooking my own food, walking most days, and my faith in God.” She said she would advise people to “do everything in moderation,” eat good food and walk every day.
