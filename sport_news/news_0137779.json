Played in by accurate passes from Hulk, Igor Smolnikov, Artyom Dzyuba and Miguel Danny all found the target.\nZenit is eight points behind CSKA and three off Champions League qualification.\nIn other results, Spartak Moscow remained fourth with a 1-0 win over Mordovia Saransk, while last season's third-placed team FC Krasnodar continued to struggle in ninth, drawing 1-1 with FC Ufa.\nAnzhi Makhachkala remains last with a 1-1 draw with Kuban Krasnodar, Terek Grozny beat Rubin Kazan 2-1, and Ural Yekaterinburg and Krylya Sovetov Samara played out a 1-1 draw.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T03:14:32.821+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
