The Colorado commit got over it. In the next three games, Taylor Jr. busting loose rushing for more than 100 yards in each outing – getting 101 against Klein, 158 against Nimitz and 103 on College Park’s defense. But in that win against College Park, Taylor Jr. suffered a deep thigh bruise. After sitting out against The Woodlands, which is the Eagles only loss this season, and Oak Ridge, the senior was ready for a comeback. “It was definitely going into Sunday after the win against Oak Ridge,” Taylor Jr. said about when he felt ready to come back. “I started running on it a little bit and I was like yeah I can go this week.” On Friday, Taylor Jr. returned to the field at about 85 percent, according to Atasocita coach Craig Stump, warming up in Atascocita’s white road uniforms with red numbers. That’s all Summer Creek’s defense would see the rest of the night –the back of his No. 6 uniform going down the field. Taylor Jr. got going in the first half and didn’t slow down. In the opening 24 minutes, Taylor Jr. racked up 16 carries for 106 yards and a touchdown. “It’s big for him to get carries and get sweat,” Atascocita coach Craig Stump said. “He hadn’t run the ball, he hadn’t practiced a whole lot till this week. Just being in game shape, it was good taking hits.” With a solid first half in the books, Taylor Jr. was primed for another big half. Coming out of the locker room the Eagles continued to utilize Taylor Jr.’s big night getting the offense into position. Out of his 29 rushes by the night’s end, 14 of those went for five or more yards, putting Atascocita in either manageable second and third down or breaking through for a first down – 11 of their 17 first downs being converted by a Taylor Jr. run. With 4:18 left in the game, Taylor Jr. put the final mark on his night with a 70-yard run down to the Summer Creek before getting shoved out at the Bulldogs’ 10-yard line. “I was looking to put it in the end zone,” Taylor Jr. said about the play with a smile. “But I started to cramp up a little bit.” That 70-yard dash pushed Taylor Jr. north of the 200-yard mark, the senior finishing with 29 carries for 236 yards and a touchdown in his comeback. The offensive line and wide receivers setting the blocks for him on the outside is where the credit goes for his big night, Taylor Jr. said, and it was a big night for him pushing forward into the final two games of the year. “It’s definitely a big game for me,” he said. “It’s definitely a confidence booster for me to have a big game like this. Just work on getting better going into next week.” Discuss Print Posted in Sports , Sports , Recaps , Sports , Sports , Sports on Saturday, October 17, 2015 9:38 am. Updated: 9:50 am.
