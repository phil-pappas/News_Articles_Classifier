Is Harvick to blame for crazy end to Talladega race? Did he really do it on purpose, causing the wreck that appeared to cost Dale Earnhardt Jr. a legitimate shot at winning Sunday's Chase elimination race at Talladega? Several other drivers say Kevin Harvick is guilty of the charge. By Jay Pennell Oct 25, 2015 at 6:30p ET Talladega, Ala. 0Shares \nAs the field ran around under caution during the final laps of Sunday's Chase elimination race confusion reigned at Talladega Superspeedway. \nLining up for what was supposed to be the only green-white-checkered attempt, the field stacked up before the leaders reached the start-finish line, with Jimmie Johnson and Kyle Larson spinning through the infield grass. While many believed the race was then over, NASCAR determined the restart was not official and lined the field up for another attempt at a clean restart. \nThat's when things really got crazy -- and confusing. \nDefending series champion Kevin Harvick had a broken exhaust pipe late in the race and struggled to get going on the first green-white-checkered attempt. On the first attempt, Harvick moved up the track to allow the field to pass by. \nBut when NASCAR reset the field and made a second attempt at the final restart, Harvick held his position in line and was slow coming to the green, stacking up the field behind him. With Harvick slow to start, Trevor Bayne moved to the outside of Harvick prior to the start-finish line. In an apparent attempt to try to block Bayne's pass, Harvick moved up the track and the two cars made contact, triggering the big wreck that ultimately ended the race. \nDespite the mechanical issues, Harvick was unofficially able to advance into the next round of the Chase with a six-point advantage over Ryan Newman in ninth. However, many of Harvick's fellow competitors felt the defending series champion crashed Bayne on purpose to secure his spot in the next round. That included Bayne himself. \n\"That's a crappy way for Harvick to have to get in the Chase is to wreck somebody -- what I believe to be on purpose -- maybe it wasn't,\" Bayne said. \"The restart before that he had engine problems and got out of the way. I think he realized if the caution came out he was going to be fine, so I got by and get hooked in the left rear. Harvick is a really good driver. I think he knows the limits of his car and where it's at, so that's why I think it was intentional.\" \nJoe Gibbs Racing teammates Matt Kenseth and Denny Hamlin both said they felt Harvick wrecked Bayne on purpose, while David Gilliland questioned the move on Twitter. \nAccording to FS1's Alan Cavanna, Bayne's crew chief, Bob Osborne, went to the NASCAR hauler to meet with officials, but they were in a meeting so he left. 0", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T00:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T00:51:15.187+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
