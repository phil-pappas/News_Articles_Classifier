Here is your first look at the Wizards. pic.twitter.com/pHPAMv5FZa \n— Stance Hoops (@stancehoops) October 15, 2015 \nIn a 2009 T-Mobile commercial starring Dwyane Wade and NBA legend Charles Barkley, the retiree calls the all-star Miami Heat guard during the middle of a press conference . He’s pleading for a few pairs of the NBA socks that he became accustomed to while he was in the league. Otherwise occupied, Dwayne hangs up on Sir Charles for bothering him with such a frivolous request. \n“Hey man, I need some socks,” he says, Barkley’s bare feet in front of the camera while he lies in a bed. “Those cushy, cotton, NBA logo socks. I need them for my footsies. They’re so comfortable. … A little bit your ankles. Hey, hey, hey, get me them socks!” \nThe point is made: socks in the NBA are a serious matter. \nBack in April, Stance announced it would be the league’s new partner for the on-court socks. Yesterday, they released their game day versions of the Washington Wizards’ new look. The surf/snow/skate company has gone from a small outfit in San Clemente, Calif., who kept their product in small batches at higher end boutique shops, to outfitting the feet for one of the most popular leagues on the planet. It’s been a big jump, but not a sudden one. \nThe terms of the deal were not disclosed, but NBA Vice President of Licensing Lisa Piken Koper thinks things have gone well since the changed happened. \n“We wanted to innovate on court and knew that Stance would bring a fresh perspective and create top-class, superior products for the NBA and our athletes,” she said Thursday. “The feedback from the players has been overwhelmingly positive.” \nBut it wasn’t that easy. The story of sliding a million dollar check across a meeting table is somewhat well-known in design and business circles, but there was a larger issue of style and comfort at hand, as well. \nSocks were the last frontier of “plain” for NBA uniforms. Transforming them could create a drastically different visual impression on fans, and Stance didn’t want to be the company responsible for that should it not go over well. \n“We were worried, too,” Stance’s Executive Vice President of Business Development Clarke Miyasaki said last week. “We kind of left it up to the teams and the players. We gave them options. We worked closely with the NBA to come up the designs and went through a bunch of iterations with them, but at the end of the day we say, hey teams, players, it’s up to you guys what you want to wear. They are not forced to wear the core design that might be a little crazier that people would expect. The majority of orders were coming in as the socks were designed. And I think you’ll see a few teams this year that it will be very rare to see them in a solid color sock.” \nMiyasaki, who came over to Stance from Skull Candy, where he had a relationship with NBA players and their agents from previous marketing deals, thought he had a natural connection for certain players to serve as brand ambassadors. Andre Drummond, Chandler Parsons, Klay Thompson and Dwyane Wade are part of their roster. \n“Generally the players earn kind of head-to-toe shoe deals, so it’s a combination of which players are available, and then which players fit the Stance brand. All the guys on our roster, they were big Stance fans before we even signed them,” Miyasaki said. “They kind of have the personalities and the style that fit our brand and they’ve been amazing to work with.” \nAs for how the socks look, it’s a drastic difference from the old white and black ones that were so coveted. The last manufacturer of the official NBA socks was a company called For Bare Feet, who took over the operation from the Sara Lee Corporation (yes, that one.) \nLocally, the change is not something that every player was happy about. After Wizards practice on Thursday, reactions were a mixed bag from players. \nOtto Porter, entering his third year, said he definitely noticed the difference. “I guess you’ve just got to get used to them,” he said, before reconsidering. “Nah, I like the cotton ones better, the old ones. My first year, I just wore the thin ones. My second year I wore the comfortable long ones. I don’t know, every guy is different. But for me, it was, I just got used to them. But these work. They’re just hard to get off.” \nAs for the Wizards socks themselves, he was pleased. “They’re nice. Yeah, I’ll wear them. Red, white and navy, those socks go with anything. I might wear them outside.” \nKris Humphries, who has played 12 years in the league, didn’t even want to discuss his feelings about it. “I like the old socks better. After 12 years, I had to switch them up,” he said, shaking his head. \nAn equipment manager concurred: “Business is business. There was nothing wrong with the old ones.” \nStance, founded in 2010, is a growing company that is hoping to corner the socks market in more than just athletic gear, but now, this NBA push is front and center. The started with just rights to the Hardwood Classics logos and retired players, and now they handle the whole shebang. In addition to the team socks they have five special event editions coming out, as well. There’s a version of Hoops for Troops socks, which will be available for the month of November. There are Christmas socks, which look sort of like a holiday sweater and pair well with the new Adidas uniforms. There are St. Patrick’s Day socks. Lastly, there are Black History Month socks for February. \nMartell Webster, a league veteran, still feels like they should have consulted the players before making the change. \n“They’re different. I don’t mind them, you know. I’ve never been high maintenance. Socks are socks, in my opinion. But as far as, from a player’s union, I think that’s something you’re supposed to vote on,” he said. “You don’t just say, ‘Here are your socks.’ I get it with the uniforms, but things that we actually have to put our feet in and that we use these to play, that’s like them coming out with a standard issued shoe, and being like, ‘Here, you guys gotta wear these.’ I think that’s something that the players should vote on. … Don’t get me wrong, it’s a great look. I’m just talking about, as far as things some of the guys don’t like is the feel. They’re really tight, they’re a hell of a lot more thin than the previous sock. So, some guys go to triple up in order to feel comfortable in their shoes.” \nAfter practice, John Wall left the facility in a pair of calf-high, non-Stance NBA socks. But Bradley Beal wasn’t too concerned about it ahead of the team’s trip to Philadelphia. \n“I like them. The white ones probably look too much like our uniforms, they could have been more of a solid color. They’re just socks, man,” Beal said with a laugh. “It’s not that big of a deal.” Clinton Yates is a D.C. native and an online columnist.
