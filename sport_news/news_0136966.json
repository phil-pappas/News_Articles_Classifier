Their latest Kickstarter focuses on a watch that’s built to capture the “Slays All” mentality Manny Santiago brings to his sport. This means it’s not only bold but also able to come out on top of the competition.\nThe campaign revolves around three new timepiece designs:\n· Matte Black with its sleek and stealthy finish,\n· Matte Platinum with its timeless appeal, and\n· Matte Gold with its classic allure.\nAs the first and only Puerto Rican skateboarder in the Street League Skateboarding “premier competitive series,” SWAE knew their creation had to reflect Manny’s heritage and aggressive riding style. That’s why they’ve proudly printed a Coqui, a small frog that is the unofficial national symbol of Puerto Rico, on the faceplate. Along with this symbol are striking red hands in contrast with the color matching mini dials, and an eye-catching bolt pattern that wraps around the face.\nThe attention to detail doesn’t end there. Each watch is built with a durable stainless steel case and mineral crystal window. Its Japanese movement ensures an accurate time reading, while its 20 ATM water resistance rating means it can go where its wearer goes--even the shower. Finally, it houses a rare stopwatch feature that makes timing one’s runs easy on the fly.\nWhen donors make a pledge on the Kickstarter page they’ll receive one of these new watches at almost 50% off the retail price. They will also be entered to win Ecko Unltd. and Rockstar Energy swag bags featuring Manny’s sponsorship gear for a further taste of the “Slays All” lifestyle.\nSince 2012, SWAE Watches has been the purveyor of cutting edge interchangeable timepieces built to bridge the action sport and urban lifestyle scenes. Co-founders Braydon Moreno and Mike Krogh launched the brand to teach the watch world a lesson in suave style. Their bold creations squash the status-quo with eye-catching colors, premium materials, and bands that can be switched up to suit one’s mood.\nFor samples or additional information, please visit http://www.swaewatches.com or contact Nicki(at)veteranpr(dot)com.\nAbout Veteran PR:\nRooted in the belief that hard work coupled with honesty and integrity is the key to any success, Veteran PR strives to help companies build their brand awareness through strategic and effective Public Relations Campaigns and Social Media Marketing Efforts.
