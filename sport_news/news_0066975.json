It's different [this time] for many reasons. I don't think it's different just now, but since the moment I came back in 2013. When I had my first conversation with the owner and the board in 2013.\n\"In the beginning of the season I said that this championship is so dangerous that, two years ago, Manchester United were out of the top four. Last year Liverpool were out of the top four. And this year somebody will be out of the top four.\n\"Somebody can be Chelsea, Liverpool, Man United, Man City, Arsenal. And I'm not speaking about Tottenham, Everton and Swansea, teams that try and have a chance of being in amongst the top four.\n\"Somebody will be out. Do I think it's Chelsea? No, I don't think it's Chelsea. But I said in preseason, when everybody had zero points, that there's a big risk because the competition is very difficult.\"\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "http://www.goal.com/en-us"], "published": "2015-10-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T02:43:04.588+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
