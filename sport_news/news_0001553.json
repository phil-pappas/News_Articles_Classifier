He will likely be replaced by Frank Shannon , the team's leading tackler from 2013, but served a full-season suspension in 2014 for a Title IX violation. \nShannon hasn't played much this season. He began August camp injured and has mostly contributed on special teams through six games this year. \n\"We have a lot of confidence in Frank,\" Stoops said today at his weekly meet with the media. \"He started a lot of games for us and is a good player.\" \nMeanwhile, linebacker Devante Bond , who missed last week's game against Kansas State and the game against Texas with an ankle injury, is set to play against Texas Tech, Stoops said.
