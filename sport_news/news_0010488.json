The Jets' ground game went off the rails in their very first running play in the team's 30-23 loss to the Patriots.\nChris Ivory, who had demolished opponents recently, bounced out to his right and was tackled for a loss. The couple of yards weren't the issue -- Ivory's hamstring was.\n\"I felt a little tightness in my hamstring the first play,\" the running back said. He added that he thought he wasn't as warm coming out of the locker room after pre-game as he maybe would have liked to be.\nINSTANT ANALYSIS: PATRIOTS 30, JETS 23\nThey took out Ivory for a series, here or there, while the running back tried to stretch out the sore muscle. He ultimately played most of the game but even he admitted that his hamstring was affecting him.\n\"Yeah,\" Ivory said. \"I didn't have the confidence in getting around the edge.\"\nIt showed. Ivory has been almost unstoppable lately, rushing for 312 yards his last two games combined. He never got going against the Patriots, who held him to 41 yards on 17 attempts, though he did catch a nine-yard touchdown pass in the third quarter.\n\"It's tough, man, for something like that to happen on the first drive, it's real tough,\" he said. \"But I was able to work through it and finish the game.

I think they set the edge pretty good. I think they wanted all the runs to go inside.\"\n HERE.\nCHECK OUT OUR NEW APP: GET THE DAILY NEWS ON ANDROID & iOS\nHead coach Todd Bowles downplayed the importance of Ivory's injury affecting the offense.\n\"It didn't hold us back,\" Bowles said. \"They did a good job of stopping him. You've got to give those guys credit. They get paid, too. He was in the game, and he was healthy. We were coming off the ball some. They had schemed some fronts and schemed some things they had seen, so they did a good job preparing.\"\nAs they game wore on, Ivory seemed to get little bit better, thought it didn't make much of an impact.\n\"It started feeling a little looser,\" the running back said. \"I started feeling more confident in myself the more the game went.\"\nAnd he wasn't concerned about the team's game next week against the Raiders.\n\"I'm fine,\" he said. \"I'm ready to go for next week.\"\nRelated Stories Patriots too much for Jets, win AFC East showdown 30-23 Jets vs. Patriots: Instant Analysis VIDEO: Buster Skrine lays out Julian Edelman with brutal hit Tags: chris ivory", "external_links": ["http://nydn.us/app", "https://www.facebook.com/NYDNSports", "http://launch.newsinc.com/js/embed.js"], "published": "2015-10-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T02:08:27.203+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
