In Manning’s first three years in Denver, the Broncos scored 1,569 points, 100 more than any other team in football. But this year the Broncos are 5-0 despite ranking 30th in offensive yards, 27th in yards per pass and 31st in yards per carry. That’s because Denver’s success has been powered by a dominant defense.\nContinue reading the main story Related Coverage In Fantasy Sports, Signs of Insiders’ Edge OCT. 11, 2015 It starts with the defense’s production on a per-play basis, where the defense leads all teams. The Broncos are allowing only 4.3 yards per play to opposing offenses; if that holds, it would be the lowest average allowed by any defense since the 2009 Jets. The Broncos are allowing a league-low 4.7 yards per pass attempt, thanks in part to an incredible 22 sacks, the most by any defense through five weeks. And there is no weakness to this unit, as the rush defense ranks in the top quarter of the league in both yards and yards per carry. Situation defense? The Broncos are covered there, too, as Denver’s third-down defense has been the best in the league, allowing first downs only 29.7 percent of the time.\nContinue reading the main story Week 5 Highlights\nBroncos’ Defense Leads, Peyton Manning Follows Week 5 Top Performers and Injury Report On the Brink of Collapse, Giants Find a Way to Win Tom Brady Shakes Off Pressure, Leads Patriots to Victory Follow the latest NFL Week 4 scores on Facebook or Twitter or by email . Look at any defensive metric, and there is a good chance the Broncos are at or near the top of the list. Denver has forced 14 turnovers, the most in the N.F.L. And the Broncos defense has allowed only seven touchdowns this year, second best in the N.F.L. to the Jets (who played one fewer game).\nDenver’s defense has even chipped in when it comes to scoring, as the Broncos defense has three touchdowns this year, tied for the league lead with Atlanta and Arizona. And, more important, all three defensive scores have come in critical situations. In Week 1, with the Broncos trailing the Ravens, 13-9, in the final seconds of the third quarter, Aqib Talib took a Joe Flacco pass 51 yards for a touchdown. Four days later, Bradley Roby scored on a 21-yard fumble to win the game in Kansas City. And on Sunday, leading, 9-7, with seven minutes remaining and the Raiders in field goal range, Chris Harris intercepted Derek Carr and took the pass back 74 yards for the game-clinching score.\nWhile Peyton Manning is failing to meet his typically lofty standards, his team still sports the best record in the league, thanks to perhaps the best defense Manning has ever had.\nLoading...
