Colsaerts, chasing a 10th professional victory but only his third on the European circuit, had a putt for 59 in last year's opening round before falling off the pace. \n\nHis last victory on the EPGA Tour was in 2012 when he defeated Northern Ireland's 2010 US Open champion Graeme McDowell to lift the World Match Play Championship. Sullivan, 29, drained eight birdies and would have held the outright lead had he not two-putted from close range for bogey at 16 for the only blemish on an equally impressive scorecard. \n\n\"I had a bit of a scrappy start but I grew in confidence as the day went on and played well down the stretch,\" said Sullivan, who won the South African Open in January and the Johannesburg Open two months later. \n\nFour players are locked on 65, and one shot back, including Belgian Thomas Pieters, who caused a sensation earlier this season by winning his first two tournaments, in three weeks, at the Czech Masters and Dutch Open. Also one shot back are Scotland's 40-year-old David Drysdale, who has never won a European title, and who had to make a 30ft putt on the 18th green in Perth last October to maintain his 2015 playing card. \n\nSpaniard Eduardo De La Riva and South African Thomas Aiken also both fired rounds of six under. Germany's former US Open and PGA champion Martin Kaymer settled for a one-under 70 as did Irish two-time British Open winner Padraig Harrington who had an eagle at the par-5, 17th in an erratic round that also included a triple bogey seven at the par-4 seventh hole. \n\nDefending champion Alexander Levy has work to do if he is to retain the title he won last year after a one-over 73 that left him eight shots back.
