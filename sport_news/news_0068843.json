His 527 yards of total offense were the most in Texas history, surpassing the 506 yards of Vince Young. Heard became the first Texas quarterback since Colt McCoy in 2009 against Texas A&M to pass for 300 yards and run for 100 yards.\nHeard's 45-yard TD run on a quarterback draw drew Texas within a point with 1:11 to go.\nOvertime seemed a formality. Then senior kicker Nick Rose missed wide right on an attempt that may or may not have been deflected, taking the air out of the Texas crowd of 91,568.\n\"He felt the pressure coming from the outside, and he just mishit it,\" Strong said.\nRose possesses a remarkably strong leg, as evidenced by a YouTube video of him making an 80-yard field goal this summer in practice. Another showed the kicker equivalent of a trick shot.\nTeammates rallied around him.\n\"We all showed him love,\" Heard said. \"Nick is going to get more critical kicks for us. He can't let that get to his head.\"\nEven the Cal sideline was stunned, although cornerback Darius White said he got a piece of the ball.\n\"We just assumed after they scored we were going to overtime,\" Cal coach Sonny Dykes told Fox Sports. \"I'm still in a little bit of shock.\"\nD'Onta Foreman's 27-yard run with three minutes remaining had cut the margin to a touchdown. Then Heard took Texas 81 yards in 40 seconds.\nTexas outgained prolific Cal (3-0) 650-548 in total yards despite 10 penalties and defensive mistakes.\n\"Everyone is hurt about this,\" said safety Kevin Vaccaro, who had nine tackles and forced a key fumble. \"We're going to bounce back. We'll learn a lot from this and become closer as a team.\"\nHeard, in his second career start, had a great duel with the Golden Bears' Jared Goff.\nHeard finished 20 of 31 passing for 364 yards and added 163 yards on 24 carries and three touchdowns.\nGoff, listed in mock drafts as a likely first-round NFL pick, was as good as advertised. He tossed three touchdowns, two to Kenny Lawler, and finished 27 of 37 for 268 yards. Texas lost starting safeties Dylan Haines (targeting ejection) and Jason Hall (shoulder injury) in the first quarter.\nGoff didn't have to throw as much as expected. Khalfani Muhammad ran for 164 yards on 10 carries, including a 74-yard touchdown in the third quarter.\nTexas has started 1-2 for the third consecutive season. From 2000 to 2012, Texas was 36-3 in its first three games to open the season.\nEven with a dynamic young quarterback in Heard and some refocused play-calling by Jay Norvell, there's optimism but also a brutally tough schedule.\nWith nationally ranked Oklahoma State, TCU and Oklahoma (combined record: 9-0) next on the schedule, Texas could show considerable progress and still be 1-5 or 2-4 at the halfway mark of the regular season.\n\"I know [Sunday] we'll have a lot of confidence going into the Big 12 season,\" Heard said.\nFollow Chuck Carlton on Twitter at @ChuckCarltonDMN.\nSherrington: 45-44 loss to Cal shows UT has lots to fix, but Strong has found a QB\nCarlton: Heard puts on a show, but ...
