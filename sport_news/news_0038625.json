(USATSI) \n\nThe 2015-16 NHL season began with Mike Babcock's coaching debut with the Toronto Maple Leafs , and it ended with a 3-1 loss to the Montreal Canadiens . \nMax Pacioretty , playing in his first game as the Canadiens' captain, scored a pair of goals in the win for while Carey Price picked right up where he left off last season and was brick wall in net, showing why he won every major award that he could have won in 2014-15.\nHere are three things you need to know about Wednesday's season opener.\n1. Carey Price did what Carey Price does best \nSteal a win for his team.\nThis game was pretty much the exact same recipe that the Canadiens have followed for the past two years now under coach Michel Therrien. Spend most of the night defending in the defensive zone, give up a lot of shots, and hope like hell that Carey Price steal the game. It usually works. He did it again on Wednesday night by stopping 36 of the 37 Toronto shots he faced against the Maple Leafs, some of them in pretty spectacular fashion, especially late in the third period as the Canadiens had to kill off a late penalty. \nIt's going to be nearly impossible for Price to top his performance from a year ago, but if he is even in the same ballpark as what he did a year ago the Canadiens are going to win a lot of hockey games no matter how the team in front of him plays. \n2. Maple Leafs fans should get used to this type of game \nBecause they're probably going to see it a lot this season.\nIt's not that the Maple Leafs played poorly on Wednesday night, because they really didn't. Jonathan Bernier gave up a pretty bad goal to Max Pacioretty early in the game (and it turned out to be big, because even the Maple Leafs lost by two it was only a one-goal game until Pacioretty added an empty-netter) but he rebounded nicely and the Maple Leafs spent a lot of time in the Montreal end, creating chances and getting shots.\nThe problem: They don't really have anybody that can finish. \nThey have some OK veterans that are going to make some plays and give them a chance on most night, they will get some opportunities, but there really isn't anybody on the team that is going to be a threat to score on any kind of consistent basis.\nThat's going to lead to a lot of 30-35 shot games where they just can't break through and score.\nAnd that's going to lead to a lot of frustrating 2-1 and 3-1 losses.\n3. We saw the debut of the coach's challenge and it was a success \nIn the end it didn't really matter because the Canadiens still scored two more goals and won the game, but we had our first look at how the coach's challenge can work , and it's long overdue. Before this season Jeff Petry 's apparent goal in the second period would have counted even though Bernier was clearly interfered with and there's nothing anybody could have done about it.\nThe technology is there. It would be silly to continue to ignore it when you can get more calls right. \nTopics: Carey Price , Jeff Petry , Jonathan Bernier , Max Pacioretty , Montreal Canadiens , Toronto Maple Leafs , NHL", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T05:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T07:54:37.460+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
