You wouldn’t think so after last season’s historic meltdown and what lies ahead this season, but they do.\nEven with the city abuzz about the Blue Jays entering their first post-season in 22 years and with the playoffs seemingly a pipedream for the Leafs, the blue and white still managed to pack them in.\nA swarm of media invaded the Leafs’ reshuffled locker room ahead of the team’s season-opening clash with archrival Montreal at the Air Canada Centre on Wednesday night, even though there’s not much to be excited about.\nCountless cameras and microphones were jammed in the faces of those players made available after the game-day skate while hockey luminaries such as Bob Cole wandered around the dressing room.\nTo be sure, though, and despite the media horde present Wednesday morning, this is going to be a long campaign for fans, one more about the future than the present, more about players working to keep their jobs than working to make the playoffs.\nEven Dion Phaneuf, entering his sixth season as captain, seemed at a loss for words when asked if the Leafs were going to surprise anyone this year. He certainly never said they would, even when asked the question on two separate occasions.\n“We’re going to keep trying to improve, day by day,” Phaneuf said with a bit of a grin.\n“At training camp you could see with the amount of changes put in, when you have a new coaching staff and a whole new system I think it takes time, but every day we built a little bit more and we improved. And that’s what we want and that’s what we talk about; we want to get a little bit better every day.\n“Our team is going to work extremely hard, night in and night out, and be tough to play against and when you do that good things will happen.”\nThe Leafs are going to have to be tough to play against, and new coach Mike Babcock will probably make sure of it, because, with sniper Phil Kessel no longer in the lineup, goals are going to be at a premium and there are going to be a lot of tightly-fought contests.\nBut still, it’s a new season and the players are excited to have the puck drop tonight against the Canadiens.\n“It’s the most exciting game of the year, to kick off the season against the Habs, it should be a good game,” said centre Nazem Kadri, who will be needed to elevate his game and help fill the goal hole left by Kessel. “I want to have a career year, I want to have my best year for this team. I know that I’m going to be relied upon … It’s not necessarily one or two guys, we’re going to need 23 guys to stand on their heads.”\nAnd that starts tonight against the Canadiens, who swept all four games from the Leafs last year, including the season-opener and closer.\nKadri will start on the top line between newcomer and former Leafs’ No. 1 draft pick Brad Boyes and the returning James van Riemsdyk.\nTyler Bozak will centre Joffrey Lupul and newcomer Shawn Matthias.\nSeedy winger Michael Grabner, acquired from the New York Islanders for a handful of low-end prospects in September, will likely be a healthy scratch tonight, as will defenceman Frank Corrado, picked up off waivers from the Vancouver Canucks on Tuesday. The Toronto native was on the ACC ice Wednesday morning and wearing the No. 20.\nMaple Leafs goalie Jonathan Bernier, who started in all four games against the Habs last season, gets the call again tonight as does Cary Price for the Canadiens.\nIn other news, forward Richard Panik cleared waivers and was assigned to the AHL Marlies, while the Leafs recalled defenceman Scott Harrington afterwards.\ndave.hilson@sunmedia.ca\nTwitter: @dave_hilson\n( Mobile users click here for Leafs game-day skate coverage )\nLeafs Game Day Skate Oct 7, 2015\n2 sec. 3 sec. 4 sec. 5 sec. 6 sec.
