Starbucks will donate 24 cents, which happens to be Lynch’s number, for every Beast Mode Frappuccino sold until it reaches $100,000, according to a company press release . Even if sales slump, however, Starbucks has agreed to contribute at least $24,000. The NFL star's double mocha Frappuccino has a hint of mint and cream and, of course, protein powder. The beverage is topped with whipped cream and finished with a purple berry drizzle and a sprinkle of matcha. For every Frappuccino sold, Starbucks will donate $0.24 to Fam 1st Family Foundation, according to a Starbucks spokesperson. (Starbucks) \nBut how could sales slump when you’re dealing with a delicious masterpiece like this? Along with the purple berry drizzle, which along with matcha rests atop a dollop of whipped cream, the Beast Mode beverage blends espresso, chocolate and mint with a healthy dose of protein powder. (Courtesy of Starbucks) \n“I’d drink this before a workout,” Lynch said. “You could get your buff on with this.” \nThe drink won’t be available everywhere, however, but starting Thursday it will go on sale in Washington state and in Oakland, Calif., and be available through the rest of the NFL season.
