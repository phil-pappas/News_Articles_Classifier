Safety. \nAlabama lost All-American Landon Collins, fellow starter Nick Perry and another player — Jarrick Williams — with starting experience. \nThe combination of senior free safety Geno Matias-Smith and junior strong safety Eddie Jackson remains a work in progress, though each had noticeably positive moments during Alabama's 38-10 win over Georgia last week. \nFreshman Ronnie Harrison has seen time at safety as well. Harrison — who has been the Tide's dime back the last three games — had a late interception against Georgia while playing free safety, his second interception in as many games. \n\"There are obviously things that we'd like to do better [at safety],\" Alabama coach Nick Saban said. \"We're not disappointed in the way those guys have played. We feel like Ronnie Harrison has developed nicely too and has gotten some playing time back there, but those three guys have been pretty consistent in their play, and we want to continue to work with them and help them get better.\" \nRELATED: The good and bad from Alabama's win over Georgia \nMatias-Smith — a former cornerback who was the Tide's nickel back last season — had seven tackles vs. Georgia, including an assisted tackle for a loss on a Sony Michel fourth quarter run that was stopped for a 1-yard loss. \nPlaying in the slot on Georgia top wide receiver Malcolm Mitchell on a third-and-3 during the second quarter, Matias-Smith stayed with Mitchell on a slant and batted down a pass thrown in that direction. \nJackson — who moved from cornerback to safety during the spring — had four tackles and an interception he returned 50 yards for a touchdown early in the third quarter to push Alabama's lead to 31-3. \nOne of the problems, especially with Matias-Smith, has been missed tackles. \nMatias-Smith missed a tackle in the flat against Ole Miss Sept. 19. That allowed Rebels wide receiver Cody Core to turn a short pass into a 34-yard gain. \nMichel ran through a tackle attempt from Matias-Smith last week, running for an additional 21 yards after eluding Matias-Smith on his way to a 28-yard gain. \nIn addition, Matias-Smith and inside linebacker Reuben Foster appeared to be the two primary players to blame on Bulldogs running back Nick Chubb's 83-yard touchdown run late in the third quarter. \nMistakes by both — in particular Foster — created a hole in the middle of Alabama's defense that Chubb exploited, running untouched for the long score. \nThere have been less noticeably bad moments with Jackson, who has 19 tackles, one stop for a loss, two interceptions and a forced fumble that he recovered. \nMatias-Smith is third on the team with 23 tackles. He also has an interception and a fumble recovery. \nHarrison has five tackles, the two interceptions, a pass breakup and a quarterback hurry. \n\"All in all, we've made less mental errors,\" Saban said. \"When we have made mental errors, it's been disastrous. So we want to keep building on that and continue to get these guys to communicate so we play well as a unit.\" Geno Matias-Smith looks ahead to Arkansas Geno Matias-Smith looks ahead to Arkansas", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T23:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T00:18:14.974+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
