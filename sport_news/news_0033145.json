A hamstrung Beckham means a hamstrung season, even when Victor Cruz returns, whenever that might be. Beckham felt a tug five plays or so before the touchdown.\nAnd so it was 49ers 27, Giants 23 when Eli Manning tried to remember how to fashion a fourth-quarter comeback, only now without Beckham and a hamstrung Rueben Randle.\nManning started at his 18, 1:41 and three timeouts left. He scrambled for 11 yards. Hit Shane Vereen for 11. Timeout, 1:11 left. Hit Vereen for 16. Timeout, :050. Tony Jerod-Eddie pressured Manning into what was ruled on the field a Tramaine Brock interception.\nReplay review reversed it.\nBeckham came back. Beckham came back! Had he lobbied the medical team?\n“Every second,” coach Tom Coughlin said.\nCoughlin sounded as if he might have been lobbing on Beckham’s behalf, too.\n“We’re trying to win a game,” Coughlin said.\nBeckham felt as if he had let his team down.\n“There’s no way in a moment like that that you can’t step up,” Beckham said.\nThe clock read 41 seconds.\nManning dumped off to Vereen for 24 yards, timeout with 30 seconds left.\n“He’s great out of the backfield,” Manning said.\nManning looked for Beckham, of course he did.\nInterference on Acker.\n“The guy held him,” Manning said. “He was going to best him.”\nTwenty six seconds left, ball at the 12.\n“I’m going to throw you open if your guy’s back’s turned to me,” Manning told tight end Larry Donnell.\nManning, on his 54th pass attempt, found Donnell reaching over NaVorro Bowman in the back of the end zone with 21 seconds left — one tight end and one team dedicating the game to fallen tight end Daniel Fells (who could lose foot in MRSA battle).\nGiants 30, 49ers 27.\nFirst-place Giants.\nTwenty-seven fourth-quarter comeback wins for Manning, the greatest quarterback in franchise history.\n“He’s our guy,” Coughlin said.\nTheir guy was asked if this comeback was about as satisfying as any.\n“A couple in the Super Bowl, obviously, but uh,” Manning said, and chuckled, and everyone laughed along.\nRegular-season?\n“This one was special,” Manning said, “just because we haven’t been as good as the two-minute drives as we once were.”\nEli Manning and Odell Beckham Jr. talk during the game.

Amaturo Their guy is paid to carry the team on his shoulders in its hour of need.\n“We had the opportunity, and that’s what they expect from me, what my teammates expect and coaches and fans, and myself,” Manning said.\nManning became the winningest quarterback (102) in franchise history and his 41 completions broke Phil Simms’ franchise record.\nTheir guy didn’t expect Beckham to return.\n“If he wasn’t going to start that drive, he probably wouldn’t going to come back in,” Manning said.\nManning finished 41-54 for 441 yards, three touchdowns, one interception.\n“It was fun,” Manning said. “We were going after it, we were pushing the ball down the field. … I thought it was a great offensive effort, and I thought we had great rhythm all game.”\nIt was 20-20 when Manning and the Giants first tried to remember how to finish the fourth quarter, only now without Beckham.\nManning hit rookie Geremy Davis for 16 yards, then Randle for 8 yards for his career-best 35th completion. Acker nearly intercepted him in the end zone, breaking Manning’s streak of 15 straight completions. Third-and-7 at the 11. Manning handed off to Vereen. Field goal.\nIt left Colin Kaepernick with 4:29 to cover 80 yards.\nHe needed just 1:44.\nAnd so it was 49ers 27, Giants 23 when Manning remembered how to fashion a fourth-quarter comeback, without Beckham and a hamstrung Randle. With the rookie Davis and Dwayne Harris and Myles White and Will Tye from Stony Brook.\nManning and Beckham had started out like some East Coast version of Joe Montana and Jerry Rice, but Beckham had disappeared after the first two series (five receptions, 89 yards receiving), and Manning tossed a regrettable end-zone pick at the end of the first half.\nWith the 49ers playing Me And My Shadow with Beckham, with little semblance of a running game, with a defense further depleted by the early loss of Jon Beason (concussion), the game quickly rested on Manning’s right arm, and his head. His job to find a way to win.\nHis mission: find Beckham.\nManning found Beckham over the middle for 15 yards at the 49ers’ 34. It marked the ninth 100-yard game of Beckham’s career. Then Manning found Beckham, and it was Giants 20, 49ers 13.\nBeckham vowed afterward that he was OK.\n“It won’t be long at all,” he said. Asked about his tears during a post game interview, Beckham said: “It seems like we’re always counted out. It was just great to see this team and the fans just light the stadium up.”\nNot to mention the quarterback you never count out.\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google Whatsapp Email Filed under eli manning ,  new york giants ,  odell beckham jr. ,  tom coughlin", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T04:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T09:20:07.503+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
