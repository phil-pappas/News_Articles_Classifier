The Wildcats also rank 10th in the country in red-zone touchdown percentage (75) with 12 touchdowns in 16 red-zone opportunities.\n“We’ve been efficient and we’ve made a lot of our opportunities,” UK head coach Mark Stoops said. “As you know we’ve had some ups and downs on all sides of the ball -- offense, defense and special teams -- but we have been efficient in the red zone. That’s one of the reasons why we’re 4-1 and one of the reasons why we’ve won close games.”\nKentucky has actually scored on 27 consecutive red-zone opportunities dating back to Oct. 25, 2014. The Wildcats ranked 38th nationally in red-zone scoring percentage (87.2) but 103rd nationally in red-zone touchdown percentage (51.3) last season.\n“In certain games we’ve got it in the end zone – that was the difference,” Stoops said. “In other games just getting the three here and there has helped as well.”\nKentucky enters the Thursday game against Auburn having scored a touchdown on each of its last seven red-zone opportunities across two games.\nIn each of the team’s four wins, Kentucky converted touchdowns on at least two-thirds of its red-zone opportunities.\nIn the lone loss against Florida, the Wildcats were held to field goals on both trips to the red zone.\n“We did a lot of good things in that game, to be honest with you,” UK offensive coordinator Shannon Dawson said. “I know that might sound weird because we only scored three field goals, but we did a lot of things good and we just didn’t score when we got down there.”\nDawson reviewed the film of the Florida loss during the bye week. That session pounded home the importance of making the most out of the team’s red-zone opportunities.\n“That game particularly, we settled for field goals, which we hadn’t been doing,” he said.\nDawson was quick to note Florida had much to do with the red-zone struggles in the loss as the Gators rank seventh nationally in opponents’ red-zone touchdown percentage (33.3 percent).\nDue in part to Kentucky’s red-zone success, no other UK opponent currently ranks in the top 70 nationally in that category.\n“We learned a lot from playing (Florida), to be honest with you,” Dawson said. “We learned a lot from playing them that allowed us to win the next couple games.”\nThose lessons paid off in the form of a perfect 7-for-7 mark in red-zone touchdown percentage against Missouri and Eastern Kentucky. Kentucky scored four red-zone touchdowns through the air and three on the ground in that span.\nAgainst Eastern Kentucky, UK scored touchdowns on three consecutive red-zone opportunities to rally from a 14-point fourth-quarter deficit for an overtime victory.\nJunior quarterback Patrick Towles’ fade pass to Dorian Baker in the end zone for the game-tying score with 52 seconds on the clock in regulation was directly influenced by a lesson from the Florida loss.\n“We’ve been throwing and catching fade balls pretty good, and there was a couple instances in that game when we should’ve threw and caught fade balls,” Dawson said. “But you’ve gotta be in those situations and see them and learn from them. But there was definitely situations in that game that we learned a lot from.”\nKentucky’s ability to continue its red-zone success on Thursday against Auburn could go a long way to determining if the Wildcats can secure the upset.\nThe Tigers rank 47th nationally in opponents’ red-zone scoring percentage (80) and 91st in opponents’ red-zone touchdown percentage (65).\nStoops is certainly not downplaying the importance of that success heading into the matchup.\n“I think that’s an important statistic,” he said. “It’s probably helped us get to this point.”\nEmail Jon Hale at jahale@courier-journal.com .
