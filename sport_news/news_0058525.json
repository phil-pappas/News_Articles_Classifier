And 2017, yes.\"\nTeammate Briton Jenson Button, the 2009 world champion, has agreed to stay with the team next year.\nAlonso said also that his radio comments in Japan had not caused any problems within the team.\nIn that race, he said the performance of his Honda engine was \"embarrassing\" and he also compared it to the units used by cars racing in junior category GP2.\nHe explained that his comments came from pure frustration in the heat of the race.\n\"Obviously we have been all season very positive about the team and the car,\" he said. \"We face some difficult times, some tough times as a team, and what you talk on the radio should remain private because you are talking to the team.\n\"When you are in a car, and in a race, and you try to give it all and you are fighting lap after lap and you keep losing positions easily on the straight, even before the braking-point, you get some frustration out there on the radio.\n\"But I am happy it was only broadcast in Suzuka because if you hear other races, other radio messages from me or Jenson, you will be even more surprised.\"\nHe said he had received more important and more encouraging lessons during a meeting with Honda in Japan before the race.\n\"That was the most important part of the weekend and the messages were important. Those were very, very clear — and more clear than Sunday.\" — AFP", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T07:30:10.294+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
