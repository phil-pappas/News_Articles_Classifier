He probably didn't envision a seven-carry, 19-yard performance as part of a backfield in which no player outside of quarterback Tyrod Taylor averaged more than 3.1 yards per carry.\n\"Honestly, that's exactly what I envisioned,\" Dixon insisted. \"A grind-type game with a 'W.' I told some of the guys earlier in the week, they was like, 'Boobie, what do you think? 100 yards? 200 yards?' I said, 'Whatever it takes, man, I just want to win. I just want to be able to step in there and say I got the job done and my team won.' That's what happened.\"\nDixon added three catches for 20 yards in the 14-13 win , but the Bills' offense had a tough time getting things going until Taylor started making big plays late in the game. Dixon did his part, but he's clearly fighting through some residual effects of a calf injury that kept him out of training camp. When asked about it, Dixon didn't want to make it part of the conversation.\n\"I'm better,\" Dixon insisted. \"I'm not trying to make that excuse, you know? I know I won't be 100 percent this year. It's all about grinding and staying in the fight long enough to make plays to help your team win. That's what I did today. I'm not worried about getting back to 100 percent, just worried about winning.\"\nTaylor made the offense's numbers look respectable, but Buffalo went to halftime averaging 2.3 yards per play and without a drive reaching Tennessee territory. Rex Ryan was disappointed but wasn't too surprised considering Ken Whisenhunt was coaching on the other side.\n\"We knew this way going to be a dogfight,\" Ryan said. \"I didn't realize it would be this kind of effort, but I will say this: if you think this game was bad, then I've been in one worse against Whisenhunt. I won a game 7-6 once, so this one right here was the greatest game ever. For some reason, I guess style makes fights. Probably not the most entertaining, but he will take the damn win.\"\nAs Richie Incognito said after the game, \"It's better to win ugly than to lose ugly.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T07:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T19:01:38.836+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
