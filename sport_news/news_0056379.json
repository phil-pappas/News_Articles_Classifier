Welcome to S.A., LA\nThere's not much left to say here that hasn't already been said. The Spurs won the summer when they won Aldridge over.\nSan Antonio signed the four-time All-Star to a four-year, $84,072,030 contract through the 2018-2019 season.\nPhoto: Dan McCarney 10. Welcome to S.A., LA\nThere's not much left to say here that... Image 2 of 11 9. But they signed other guys, too\nAldridge was the star, the free agent coup this Spurs organization has never experienced before. But he didn't come alone.\nTwo-time All-Star David West declined a $12.6 million player option with Indiana to sign for the $1.4 million veteran's minimum. Serbian Super League MVP and resident giant Boban Morjanovic signed a one-year, $1.2 million contract. And the Spurs traded a future second-round draft pick to Sacramento in exchange for 24-year-old point guard Ray McCallum.\nPhoto: Eric Gay /Associated Press 9.

The 37-year-old Ginobili has been throwing his body around recklessly for 13 seasons, and it took much deliberation this Summer for him to realize home, at least for one more season, wasn't Argentina, it was in San Antonio.\nPhoto: Bob Owen, San Antonio Express-News 8. Manu is back\nFor a time, it truly looked like Manu had run out of... Image 4 of 11 7. Sustained success\nThe Spurs' incomparable run of success has been well-documented, but they can build even more on their untouchable totals this year.\nAnother 50-win season would make this the 17th consecutive season they've crossed that threshold, an NBA record. Had the 1999-2000 season not been shortened by a lockout the Spurs—who finished 37-13 (.740)—would be going for No. 18.\nThey can, however, secure a 19th consecutive playoff berth, another NBA record matched not even by the dynastic Boston Celtics teams of Russell and Havlicek and Auerbach.\nPhoto: Edward A. Ornelas /San Antonio Express-News 7. Sustained success\nThe Spurs' incomparable run of success has been... Image 5 of 11 6. Duncan still doing it\nDuncan has swatted away Father Time as effortlessly as any of us swat away a gnat. At age 39, Duncan's still outplaying youngsters who were in diapers while he was hoisting MVP trophies. In his 19th season, Duncan has proven he has plenty of gas left to surpass some of the all-time greats ahead of him.\nGames played : 1,331. Currently 11th all-time, can move up to seventh by playing 60 games this season, something he has done every single year he's been in the league. Total Rebounds : 14,644. Currently 8th all-time, needs just 325 to move into sixth. He grabbed 704 last season. Points : 25,974. Currently 14th all-time, can move into 10th by scoring 972 points. He's failed to score that many in a season just once (2011-2012) in his career. Blocked shots : 2,942. Currently sixth all-time, can move into fourth with 123 this year. Recorded 151 last season.\nPhoto: Kin Man Hui, By Kin Man Hui/San Antonio Express-News 6. Duncan still doing it\nDuncan has swatted away Father Time as... Image 6 of 11 5. Parker, Manu making moves of their own\nParker and Ginboili have somewhat discreetly built themselves resumes that could one day signal a call to the Hall of Fame. Like Duncan, they're both closing in on some key milestones.\nAssists : With just 30 assists, Parker will become the 34th player to record at least 6,000. With 155 he could move into the top 30. Games : Ginobili will reach 900 regular-season games played if he gets on the court for just 35. 3-PT field goals : Ginobili can become the 32nd man in NBA history to knock down 1,300 threes. He's just 28 away.\nPhoto: Edward A. Ornelas, San Antonio Express-News 5. Parker, Manu making moves of their own\nParker and Ginboili have... Image 7 of 11 4. JimmerMania? The NBA hasn't been kind to the man who once took over an entire country during March Madness.\nFredette has been on three teams in four seasons, and the 26-year-old former National Player of the Year has turned into something of a professional vagabond, going from city to city trying to find a home. His spot on the team isn't guaranteed, but if anyone is capable of luring out buried or forgotten talent, it's Pops and the Spurs\nPhoto: Associated Press 4.

She didn't disappoint.\nBecky Hammon made international news last year when the Spurs made her the first full-time female coach in NBA history. This year, she became the first female head coach at Summer League, and the acclimation period didn't take long. Hammon led the Spurs to a Summer League title, and second-year guard Kyle Anderson to an MVP.\nThe Spurs have been known for making history over the past two decades, but this, despite its occurrence at a Las Vegas league composed of NBA rookies and sophomores and hopeful washouts, might have meant more than any ring ever could.\nPhoto: Ronda Churchill /Associated Press 3.

A special visit\nPops is known in NBA circles for being an intellectual, and there are few smarter moves one could imagine than bringing in Dr. John Carlos, a former Olympic gold medalist rightly remembered more for his stoic, defiant act of protest than his athletic accolades.\nPopovich brought Carlos in \"to honor somebody who deserves to be honored, and to let our team know the world is bigger than basketball.”\nIt made an immediate impact on Spurs players, and proved once again why the Spurs are the organization every NBA team tries to emulate.\nPhoto: /AP 2.

A new home\nWhen fans return to the AT&T Center, they'll see what $111 million in renovations can buy: 12,000 square feet of LED scoreboard displays to watch, new bar and restaurant options, new four-seat theater boxes, 6,293 new light fixtures, 675 miles of communication wiring and a massive new high-definition scoreboard.\nIf for some reason you didn't have a good reason to go see the Spurs, well, you do now.\nPhoto: Courtesy 1.

Broken gender barriers at a Summer League in Vegas. A former Olympian and civil rights activist at training camp. A \"will he or won't he\" with Manu.\nThere was no shortage of intrigue in what was an unusually active offseason in San Antonio.\nWith so much going on, you'd be forgiven if you missed a few things, so we're here to help.\nClick through the slideshow to see every major story you may have missed this offseason.\nnmoyle@express-news.net\nTwitter: @NRMoyle", "external_links": ["http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/20/52/8718997/7/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/26/46/8743307/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/33/73/25/7320903/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/25/03/8737016/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/35/43/53/7748345/9/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/25/03/8737016/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/40/11/05/8425805/5/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/20/52/8718997/7/920x920.jpg", "https://twitter.com/NRMoyle", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/33/73/25/7320903/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/31/16/8754096/7/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/26/46/8743307/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/04/05/37/1071073/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/31/16/8754096/7/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/27/73/8748763/5/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/32/17/8758265/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/32/17/8758265/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/40/11/05/8425805/5/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/35/43/53/7748345/9/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/04/05/37/1071073/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/27/73/8748763/5/920x920.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-09T04:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T05:27:08.968+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
