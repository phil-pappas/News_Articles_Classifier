About a month since the opening of training camp, it’d be safe say the Maple Leafs have finally set their smart phones to Babcock time. While previous incarnations of the club often saw a scattering of the team’s highest-paid players step onto the ice not a minute sooner than the appointed work hour, the new emphasis on punctuality is just the latest evidence of a new presiding philosophy set forth by Mike Babcock, their $50-million head coach.\n“You’re so terrified of being late that you’re just early,” said Morgan Rielly, the Maple Leafs defenceman. “I don’t think there’s a rule or anything written down. But it’s a little bit of a code that you don’t want to be late.”\nThe skeptic would scoff at the significance of minute-to-minute minutiae; more than 48 years since Toronto’s most recent Stanley Cup, surely a quarter-hour here and there is inconsequential. But turning the small stuff into a potential federal case is an old sporting trick. Vince Lombardi, the patriarch of the NFL coaching tree whose methods have been cherry-picked beyond the gridiron, was an advocate of the merits of showing up to practice and team meetings early — so much so that the clock that overlooks Lombardi’s bronze statue at Lambeau Field is perpetually set 15 minutes ahead to what’s become known as “Lombardi time.”\nBut while Lombardi was known for putting his early-arriving team through torturous, marathon practices, things are different in Leafland this year.\nSo far this year the Maple Leafs have been running practices as though they’re paying for ice time by the hour. The team’s on-ice workouts have rarely stretched beyond the one-hour mark. There’ve been days when Babcock has wrapped up the proceedings in as little as 30 minutes. Wednesday’s skate clocked in at 58 minutes, although some players stuck around to do additional work after Babcock exited.\nThree outings into the season, the Leafs have yet to win a game. But they are those who’ll tell you they’re crushing practice.\n“Even though you’re out there for an hour, it feels like you’re out there for 30 minutes,” said Daniel Winnik, the veteran forward\nIt’s a marked change from previous regimes whose overseers apparently saw value in sweat-fests that occasionally stretched toward the two-hour mark. Babcock, a schoolteacher by trade, has spoken of the importance of using his team’s work hours efficiently.\n“I don’t like to waste people’s time,” the head coach told reporters earlier this month. “I think you come in here, you do everything fast, and you go home in a hurry.”\nBabcock’s practices may be short, but they’re intense. While Carlyle often interrupted workouts to (a) scream at players who weren’t performing to his liking and (b) to gather players around a whiteboard while he diagrammed Xs and Os, Babcock largely eschews on-ice teaching for a rapid-fire sequence of high-tempo drills.\n“It keeps you sharp,” said Mark Arcobello, the veteran forward. “We can get right to it instead of so much explaining.”\nBabcock has built a reputation for excellence, coaching a Stanley Cup winner in Detroit and two Olympic gold-medal teams for Canada, but he’s also been known to be hard on players. Rielly, at least, has spoken of the new coach as an upbeat presence.\n“It makes (practice) easier, because we know he’s not going to be yelling at guys. He’s not going to try to humiliate guys and halt practice and talk about things,” Rielly said. “We’re going to have a positive attitude.”\nGoaltender James Reimer said there are benefits beyond time management. The fast pace of workouts translates into higher-quality repetitions for the men in the crease.\n“Lots of times, when practices are longer or not as fast-paced, guys come in and they hold the puck and they hold the puck, and they double-clutch and double-clutch. And then, after a 13-minute release, they shoot,” Reimer said. “Obviously I’m exaggerating a bit. But now, guys come down the wing, boom, shoot. That’s (more) what a game’s like.”\nIt’s not a particularly new concept. Some 30 years ago Michel Bergeron, then the coach the Quebec Nordiques, drew attention for eschewing the 1 ½- to 2-hour practices that had become the industry standard.\n“I know a lot of coaches hold hard, two-hour practices after losses,” Bergeron said at the time. “But not for me, not anymore. Let’s face it. You’re draining their energy.”\nAll these years later, the Maple Leafs, who next play on Friday in Columbus, are among the many teams in pro sports spending big money measuring that energy expenditure with GPS-based player tracking devices that can alert the club’s sports scientists to the physiological signs of overwork. Still, all that computer-gathered data might not be as important as the new emphasis being placed on an age-old piece of technology: the clock.\n“You’re not clock-watching in practice, thinking, ‘When is this thing going to end?’” Winnik said. “There’s working hard and working smart. And we work smart.”\nMore on thestar.com\nLamar Odom on life support after four days in brothel\nInterpol seeks breakthrough at Canadian International", "external_links": ["http://static.freeskreen.com/publisher/52/freeskreen.min.js"], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T00:47:13.013+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
