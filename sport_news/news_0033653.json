Minnicks, began teaching the series \"Understanding the Bible \" at New Canaan Worship Center in Richmond, Virginia where the pastors are Rev. Louis R. Blakey, Jr. and Rev. Lois Blakey-Paige. The teaching starts at 7 p.m. and ends at 8:15 p.m. and is open to members of the worship center as well as the public.\nOn the first night, Rev. Minnicks provided an overview of what to expect during the series. She gave the attendees a handout with 43 guidelines for understanding the Bible. She first explained that the Bible is a collection of books of one story of the Jewish nation written by 40 authors that covers 1,600 years. She emphasized that in order to understand what the Bible MEANS today, we should understand what it MEANT to the original audience. Then the Bible teacher let the participants know that the books in our Bible are not in chronological order. They are arranged by their literary types.\nThe Bible is made up of narratives, histories, songs, psalms, proverbs, parables, paradoxes, drama, prayers and doxologies with two divisions. The Old Testament is made up of types, shadows, and prophecies while the New Testament is the fulfillment of those prophecies.\nRev. Minnicks encouraged participants not to change the word order. For instance, the Bible says, \"Noah was a just man\" not \"Noah was just a man.\" The teacher emphasized that when a person uses a synonym for a word in the scripture, he changes the meaning of the scripture. For example, the shortest verse in the Bible is found in John 11:35 that says, \"Jesus wept.\" To say Jesus cried, cried out, or sobbed changes the intended meaning. Therefore, Rev. Minnicks advised the people to \"stick with the text.\" In order to understand the Bible, people need to say what the Bible says instead of trying to put their own spin on scriptures without knowing the context of the passage.\nIn the coming weeks, students will complete assignments by using the guidelines given during the first session. They will read passages and find names, numbers, customs, and use guidelines that make understanding the Bible quite easy.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T04:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T06:08:04.126+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
