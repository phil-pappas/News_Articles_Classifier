Guy Dossi / Union Democrat, Copyright 2015. It’s homecoming week at Sonora High School, and homecoming is typically all about football. However, the Sonora boys’ soccer team didn’t get the memo. In a game that the ‘Cats needed to win in order to keep their playoff hopes within reach, they went out and defeated Amador 2-1 Monday night at Dunlavy Field. “As a whole, this win for Sonora High is great,” said freshman Jacob Schader. “It is homecoming, but we are still going at it with soccer. We are not just giving it all to football.” Any fan who was tardy to the game by 3 minutes, had to ask neighboring spectators how the ‘Cats got the lead. Slightly over one minute removed from the start of the game, Sean Mackey set the ball on the turf closest to the Amador bench on the north side of the field for a corner kick. He put foot-to-ball and the kick found the chest of Missael Vazquez. The ball died at the feet of Vazquez, and he made a perfect shot past the outstretched arms of the Amador goalkeeper for a 1-0 Sonora lead. Those fans who were late to the party, had to wait nearly 35 more minutes before another goal was scored. With the ‘Cats holding on to a one goal lead, both defenses tightened up and didn’t allow any clean shots. With two minutes remaining in the half, Amador tied the game with a close shot in traffic. The score remained 1-1 heading into the second half. Wildcat goalie Anthony Prophet may have let one past him in the first half, but he made perhaps the save of the game with 29:32 remaining in the second half. Amador passed the ball well in transition, and had Sonora outnumbered 2-1 by the ‘Cats goal. A powerful shot was taken, and Prophet jumped and made a fingertip save to keep Amador from taking the lead. The Dunlavy Field faithful sat up off the cement stands and cheered Prophet for his outstanding play. “He’s a senior and he made a senior play on that ball,” said Wildcat head coach Lloyd Longeway. “A junior goalkeeper might have been caught off of his line or not ready at the time. But, he got back just enough because it looked like it was going in. It was a game saver for us. I think if they score there, our heads are down and we might not have won the game.” Sonora still needed to score. As the time ticked off the scoreboard, it was apparent that the clock would soon become the ‘Cats enemy. “I knew that a tie wouldn’t have helped us in the standings, so I made a couple of changes to help our offense,” Longeway said. “I moved Zach Whitmer, our sweeper, up to the top, and I moved Missael out of the back to the midfield to try to get that extra goal because we really wanted to win tonight.” Sonora moved the ball down the field and quickly got the ball closer to the south side goal. Ross Irwin passed the ball to Schader, who was streaking down the far side of the field. Schader received a perfect pass from Irwin and blasted a sensational shot that rocketed past the Amador goalkeeper. The goal gave the ‘Cats a 2-1 lead with under five minutes to play in the game. “Jacob is a competitor and that is why we brought him up on our team,” Longeway said. “We could see that during our summer training. He just does not quit and he showed that tonight. Late in the game, he was where he needed to be and he took advantage of it.” Sonora did its best to protect the lead and Amador did not get the opportunity to attempt a game tying shot. With the final blow of the referee’s whistle, the ‘Cats exploded off the bench in celebration. They circled around Longeway at midfield, some too tired to stand straight up, and their coach praised them for their gritty and outstanding play. “I’m really excited about where our program is going,” Longeway said. “We have a lot of exceptional players and Sonora High soccer has a really bright future. With guys like Clayton Roberson, Missael Vazquez, Jacob Schader — there are really a lot of great young players in the program. Right now, our older players have been teaching them and have been really good teammates all year, helping them improve.” With the win, Sonora brings its record in Mother Lode League play to 3-3-1. The ‘Cats will try to keep the momentum going on Thursday when they take on Calaveras in San Andreas. With Summerville and Linden fighting for the one and two seeds in the MLL, the ‘Cats now one step closer to taking control of the third seed. “We were in a fight with Amador in the standings for third and I think that the top three teams go to playoffs,” Longeway said. “One of our goals early in the season was to go to playoffs. Amador has a heck of a team and I’m really proud of my guys. We tied Amador last time, so we really wanted to get them here at home.” Follow UnionDemocrat.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T04:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T08:12:14.217+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
