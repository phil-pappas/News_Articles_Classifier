LAWRENCE / CONTRIBUTING COLUMNIST\nPublished: Oct. 21, 2015 Updated: 2:36 p.m. We all have opinions about what the right way is to do just about anything. Couples have running debates about the “right” way to load the dishwasher. Moms and dads develop strong opinions about the “right” way to raise kids. People even debate about the “right” way to put a roll over toilet paper on a dispenser (Over! No, under!).\nMany of these debates over the right way to do things are harmless points of humor in our relationships. Cottonelle, the toilet paper brand, even ran a funny poll to let everyone chime in with their views on how to properly install toilet paper (“Over” won).\nSometimes, though, these points of contention about the right way to do something can cause rifts in relationships. The person who insists too strongly that their way is the only way can annoy and alienate their family members, friends and co-workers. Sticking strongly to a belief that your way is the only right way can give the impression that you feel that you are superior, and therefore that you think others are stupid, incapable, or simply unnecessary.\nIn watching two episodes of “The Profit” on CNBC recently, in which successful entrepreneur Marcus Lemonis invests in struggling businesses and works with the owners to try to save them, I noticed that there was a theme: in both cases, the business owners had become very attached to their way of doing things – to what they thought was right way.\nIn the first case, a woman was running an eco-friendly cleaning products company. Lemonis believed that the packaging and branding on the product was confusing to customers, a point which customers confirmed during a focus group. But the owner of the company was reluctant to change anything about the labeling. She believed that it was the right way to sell her product and represent the values of her brand. Lemonis pointed out to her that her product was not selling, and she still did not want to budge. She eventually relented with his investment on the line if she did not make the branding change.\nThe salesperson on her team also fell into the same trap, failing at sales but still believing that her approach was the right approach so strongly that she would not listen to anyone trying to suggest something different. She did not change until she realized that the future of the business was riding on her dropping what she thought was right and listening to another opinion.\nIn another example, Lemonis started to work with a doggie day care owner who truly believed that his way was the only right way. He did not just allude to that fact, he actually stated it loudly and directly to employees. Behind employees’ backs, he told Lemonis that if is employees could not get things right (his version of “right”) it was because they were stupid or lazy or both. He would resort to yelling directly at employees if they did not seem to comply with his requests to do things his way. His employees felt demoralized, frustrated and ready to leave the company.\nAnd it was not just that the owner resorted to yelling, it was that he never listened and never took the opinions and viewpoints of his employees seriously. He could not believe that someone else could come up with a way of doing things that was just as “right” or even better than what he had come up with.\nAs many people learn in their personal lives, it is not worth starting a household war over the correct way to load the dishwasher. There are multiple ways to load the dishwasher and still get the dishes clean, just like there are multiple ways to do anything in life and still get good results.\nWe often take our businesses and work very personally, and attach tremendous value to the techniques that we have developed that we feel have contributed to our success. But the right way for you might not be the right way for everyone, and your business is most likely to succeed when you leave room for the possibility that there is more than one “right way” in the world.\nJessica H.
