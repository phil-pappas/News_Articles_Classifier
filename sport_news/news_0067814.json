The 30th annual Head of the Rock Regatta, put on by the YMCA of the Rock River Valley and the Rockford YMCA Rowing Crew, drew teams and spectators from around the region. Here's what you need to know about it. What is the Rock Regatta? The annual rowing race attracts teams from around the Midwest. This year, 51 teams hailing from Nebraska, Ohio and everywhere in between competed in about 600 races. Competitors raced \"rowing shells,\" or small, streamlined carbon-fiber boats containing one to eight team members. Thousands of racers and spectators — race organizers expected 4,000 to 6,000 — flocked to the Rock River bike path near the YMCA. \"They like the spirit of being welcomed here,\" said Jan Jann, a Rockford Rowing Crew member and marketing coordinator. Susan Urbas, president of the Chicago River Rowing and Paddling Center, served as a Rock Regatta referee and judge. She said the venue is well-equipped to allow for good views of the 3.1-mile races. \"You get to see the excitement of the crew and some close finishes,\" she said. Who are the racers? Junior, club and collegiate teams competed in races that began near the Riverside Boulevard bridge and finished just shy of the Whitman Street bridge. High school- through senior-aged crew members rowed in competitions separated by age and skill level. The Rock Regatta also drew more than 20 collegiate teams from around the Midwest. Members of the Minneapolis Rowing Club's novice women's team, which is made up of adults who are new to rowing, took first place in the eight-person open race. The women, whose team motto is \"Show no MRC,\" were happy to compete in their first Head of the Rock and enjoyed the race in spite of choppy conditions created by windy weather. Organizers had to cancel single, pair and doubles races because of dangerously rough water. \"We were really excited to get the opportunity to come here,\" said Hari Osofsky, a Minneapolis crew member. \"We'd heard from our coach what an awesome regatta it was.\" Who are the spectators? Rowing fans from Rockford and all over the Midwest. With beautiful views of the river, exciting competition and lots of food, the regatta had a little something for everyone. Karen Gallup took in her second Head of the Rock while her daughter, Emerson, a student at Jones College Prep in Chicago, competed for the Chicago Rowing Foundation. A former rower, Gallup enjoyed the setup, organization and even the knowledgeable announcers. \"I don't think any of the regattas I've been to are as big as this,\" she said. \"I always brag about this regatta.\" Page 2 of 2 - Gallup loved the event so much last year that she convinced her friend Grace Chalutowksa to join her this time around. Chalutowska's son, Pawel Radon, a student at Lake View High School in Chicago, was also competing for the Chicago Rowing Foundation. \"My son — he loves this,\" she said. \"It's a great sport.\" Lindsey Holden: 815-987-1339; lholden@rrstar.com ; @lindseyholden27 By Lindsey Holden", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T05:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T07:20:48.674+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
