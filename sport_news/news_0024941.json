(AP) - The Missouri Ozarks tourist attraction Branson is getting a $10 million adventure park.\nThe 80,000-square-foot project, called Fritz's Adventure, will feature rock-climbing walls, zip lines, a rope course, and a water tower, tubes and slides in a three-story building. It will also have a restaurant.\nDevelopers expect the attraction to open next summer at site of the former Silver Fountain Inn, next to the Dixie Stampede along Missouri 76.\nOfficials say the project is among early efforts to revitalize Branson's popular strip of theaters and other attractions. The makeover also looks to make the corridor more accessible for pedestrians and bicyclists, as well as to bring in a trolley.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
