Brett Davis / USA TODAY Sports Oct 25, 2015 at 10:53p ET 0Shares \nThe Atlanta Hawks were darlings of the NBA last season. The team was a beacon of stability, teamwork and the system giving rise to something greater than the sum of its parts. But that kind of positive atmosphere can disappear rather quickly, as the Hawks seem to be finding out. \nThe loss of DeMarre Carroll hurt. And now, Atlanta's young point guard Dennis Schroder is making waves, saying that if he doesn't get an opportunity to start, he'll look at the possibility of playing elsewhere, according to an interview with Germany's Bild , as translated by Sportando : \"My goal is to start as point guard,\" Schroder said. \"If this doesn’t happen, I will look for other opportunities,\" added the German talent. \"The Hawks are a great team, the city is nice and everything is perfect now. (Jeff) Teague? He was an All-Star and he helped me a lot. I must be patient and work hard and eventually I’ll have my opportunities,\" ended Schroder. \nIt doesn't sound as if Schroder will be a problem with his desire to start, but it will be interesting to see if he forces the issue at all. He's reportedly under contract through this season with a team option for next year of just less than $3 million, which would be a bargain for a young point guard of Schroder's caliber.
