Relief. \nIt didn't last long. \nThe Canucks' high-paid sniper couldn't buy a goal in the first six games. And to hear him talk, he would have been willing to spend a good chunk of his $5 million yearly salary if he could. \nLined with the Sedins for the first time in since baseball started spring training, Vrbata finally made it rain, scoring his first goal of the season. \nIt was off a skate. It was ugly. It was lucky. He'll take it. He needed it. \nThe Canucks needed it. This team is going nowhere, and fast, if the Sedins and Vrbata aren't carrying the offensive mail as often as possible. \nBut hockey can be a fickle sport. Vrbata got to hold on to those good feelings about as long as San Francisco stayed in Thursday's NFL game against Seattle. \nIn the third period, with the Canucks clinging to a 2-1 lead, the Caps scored. It was all on Vrbata. \nIt was Vrbata who mistakenly, and blindly, passed the puck to Marcus Johansson behind his own net. Luca Sbisa shortly afterwards batted the puck out the air and into the net while trying to clear it out of Ryan Miller's crease. \nThe lead is all the Caps required. Alex Ovechkin finished it. \nFor some reason, in the third period, the Canucks fourth line kept ending up on the ice with Ovechkin. \nIt proved costly when Ovechkin was left wide open to Miller's right. He fell to one knee as he unloaded on a one timer. \nThe puck fluttered over Miller and into the net. Yes, Bo Horvat was on the ice and this has not been a good run of games for the 20-year-old centre. \nAlready this season, he has been on the ice for six even strength goals against. \nBut it never would have got there if Vrbata just had one night where everything went his way. \nWHAT THIS MEANS \nThe power play lives, at least to see another day. \nThe Canucks had gone six-and-a-half games to start the season without a goal from their first power play unit. \nHenrik Sedin changed that with a sharp-angled goal, in-tight, to put the Canucks up 2-1 in the second. It gave Vancouver only its second goal in 22 power play opportunities. Before that, the only other goal was courtesy Bo Horvat. \nPressure had been mounting for the team to get Yannick Weber into the lineup. That will continue to bubble below the surface. \nWeber's absence from the lineup remains one of the most curious lineup decisions by Willie Desjardins. \nWeber spent the second half of last year in the top four, playing with Dan Hamhuis and the pair held up just fine in its own end. \nWeber ignited the power play, scoring five man-advantage goals and adding two assists in the final 30 games of the season. \nWith a right-shot defenceman playing the point, all kinds of room opened up down low for the Sedins. \nWHAT WE LEARNED \nThe Columbus Blue Jackets were initially reluctant to pay the price it cost to sign John Tortorella. \nThe NHL's CBA allows for teams to get draft picks when coaches or management get promoted in other organizations. \nThe Jackets argued it's a bad rule which will be changed in January. The NHL initially stepped into this, but backed off, allowing the two sides to figure it out. \nThe Canucks started a negotiation which ended with them agreeing to pay a significant percentage of Tortorella's contract but in return they got the second round pick. \nThe Jackets can choose which year they give the pick up from any of the next three. \nMost believe they'll pick 2017. \nIN A WORD \nBACKCHECK: Yes, that was Alex Ovechkin coming out of nowhere to hunt down Bo Horvat in the first period, preventing the Canucks second year player from a partial breakaway. So much speed. So much effort. \nCAUGHT: Matt Bartkowski was late changing in the first period, in fact still calling for the puck when the Caps were pinned in their end. When Washington finally got it out, Bartkowski didn't have enough in the tank to defend a 2-on-2 rush. Caps scored. \nMISSED: Officials called Jannik Hansen for a late second period high stick but actually Evegeny Kuznetsov hit himself with his won stick in the head. Maybe the league can add this to review? \n. \nIN THE NUMBERS \nMinus-6: This was Dan Hamhuis's shot attempt differential. It was another tough game for the Canucks defence, specifically the team's second pairing. Only Luca Sbisa was on the ice for more Washington shot attempts. \n17: This was the number of shot attempts the Caps had when Derek Dorsett was on the ice. It was the most of any Canuck. It was strange to see his line on the ice so often in the third period. \nMinus-23 : This was Matt Bartkowski's even strength scoring chance differential during the first six games. It means, when he was on the ice, opponents had 23 more scoring chances than the Canucks did. It ranked worst on the team. \nPlus-8: This was Chris Tanev's even strength scoring chance differential through the first six games. Opponents only had 38 scoring chances when Tanev was on the ice. Bartkowski was on the ice for 20 more. Â« Previous", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T08:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T09:58:30.082+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
