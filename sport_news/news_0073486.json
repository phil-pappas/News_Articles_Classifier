(AP) - Bauhaus Furniture is expanding its production capacity.\nThe Northeast Mississippi Daily Journal reports ( http://bit.ly/1OEWx3z ) the Saltillo-based company said Wednesday it is investing about $1.25 million converting a distribution center in Ripley into a manufacturing space.\nThe 230,000-square-foot facility in the North Ripley Industrial Park has been a warehouse for Carolina Accent and Austin Furniture, two sister companies of Bauhaus.\nBauhaus President Wayne Stephens said manufacturing will begin in early November, and will start with about 20 employees.\nStephens says if the business grows, he hopes to have 175 workers at the new facility.\nBauhaus Furniture Group named Stephens president in May, and said it was looking to expand. Making good on that promise, Bauhaus, through the Tippah County Development Foundation, was able to secure about $1 million in grants and tax incentives.\nInformation from: Northeast Mississippi Daily Journal, http://djournal.com\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
