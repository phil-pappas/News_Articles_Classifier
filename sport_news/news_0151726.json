In this game, the Rams mauled Palmer and outhit our defense by a huge margin. The Rams racked up 4 sacks, 9 QB hits, 9 TFL's, 2 forced fumbles... Our defense? Against a questionable and up to this point shaky o-line? 1 sack. And although the Cards offense dominated in TOP and # of plays run, our defense folded in the 4th quarter like a cheap suit, giving up 106 yards on the ground to Gurly in just that final quarter!! Seriously?? We are now 6 & 8 against the NFC West under BA. That just isn't gonna create a lot of success... IMHO, that record is a direct reflection of our defense and the painfully nagging inability to get to the QB. Not sure what the answer is at this point... What happened to Okafor? Why hasn't Kareem Martin developed? Calais had a HoF day yesterday registering 11 tackles... Eleven! With a few TFL and a 1/2 sack. But one guy isn't enough. We simply can't find a way to get our guys in the backfield enough, a la the Rams and several other top-tier teams. Say whatever you want about the 3 turnovers, the incredibly bad play calling from BA, leaving Watford on the bench, the rusty look to Iupati, the dropped passes and the odd inability to punch it in when in the red zone... It all mattered of course... BUT, the Canary in the Coal Mine is our defense and the total lack of ability to scare the opposing QB... It's a major flaw that will haunt this team all season... Did not realize that is BA's record against NFC West teams. Not so good. that needs to be fixed. I think Larson should have started with Iupati getting some snaps just to get him some time especially on running plays however Iupati starting and Larson being inactive I think was a mistake. Sometimes I wonder is it BA's ego that gets in the way or is he just that stubborn with some of the plays called by him? I am just having a hard time getting pass the two pass plays called inside the 2 minute mark when the Cardinals had 2nd and 2 inside Rams territory. CJ was having a good day running and that is the best plays you can come up with knowing you need to keep this drive alive and continue to chew clock while getting closer for a FG to win the game? I could live with everything else that happened in the game up to this point. Smart teams and coaches make good decisions here and I think his were poor at best. Game management just fell completely apart here. I almost felt that BA was saying I am going to beat you my way or not beat you at all.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T12:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T17:30:55.793+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
