Cowher is former Browns player who could land in the Hall of Fame as a Steelers coach. Former owner Randy Lerner would have hired Cowher if he could have in 2009. Instead, Cowher opted to stay with his job as a CBS analyst, and Sunday he came down hard on Johnny Manziel. “I’ve watched Johnny Manziel now for a year and a half and I think he’s a backup quarterback at best. And he’s a distraction off the field “And listen, I believe in second chances but after the second chance, to me there’s a zero-tolerance policy. He can’t put himself into the position he put himself into. “I would ask for his release and I would do it for this reason: In that locker room, players want accountability, and that’s the message that needs to be sent right here, that you’re accountable for your actions both on the field and off the field.” Manziel dressed Sunday as the No. 2 quarterback five days after an incident that generated a police report. According to the report, Manziel had been in an argument with his girlfriend after having a couple of drinks earlier in the day. Police questioned Manziel and his girlfriend in a vehicle Manziel was driving on Interstate 90. There were no arrests, but the story, which broke Friday, has legs. Manziel and No. 1 quarterback Josh McCown interacted before, during and after Sunday’s game. As the Broncos drove in overtime, they watched together, McCown with his hands in a warmer, Manziel wearing a cape. One wouldn’t have know anything was amiss by watching them. Afterward, McCown said he would not comment on Manziel. Manziel could not be located. Head coach Mike Pettine said, “I don’t want to say anything today. I mean, we’re just coming off the heels of a … I’ve got guys in that locker room that just played their tails off and came up short. We’ll have plenty of time during the week to talk about it.” MANNING BELOW TIM COUCH LINE At times Sunday, most notably when it was time to win, Denver’s quarterback looked like the Peyton Manning of old. Manning’s strike to Emmanuel Sanders that went for a 75-yard touchdown was a thing to behold. It barely cleared cornerback Tramon Williams’ hand. So was a Manning touch pass that floated over cornerback Pierre Desire to Demaryius Thomas. Immediately after that 20-yard gain, though, Manning threw a pick-six to linebacker Karlos Dansby, giving the Browns a fourth-quarter lead. Page 2 of 4 - At that and other points Sunday, he looked like old-man Manning. The 39-year-old QB threw three interceptions and came away with a 63.3 rating. Manning’s season passer rating dropped to 72.5. One perspective: Tim Couch’s passer rating as a 1999 Browns rookie was 73.2. Yet, Manning improved to 7-0 against the Browns and has the Broncos at 6-0. He hardly seemed depressed. “This will be my last game in Cleveland,” Manning said. “I feel pretty good about the win.” Manning’s last drive began on the 12. Soon it was third down at the 18, when Manning caught the Browns napping and hit tight end Owen Daniels for an 18-yard gain. “I’m not sure they were totally dialed in, what they were doing,” Manning said. “Then the best play was a second down, and we got them in a blitz and got it to Ronnie (Hillman).” That made it third-and-1 from the Browns’ 40, and for one of the few times all day, Manning had the Browns on their heels. That play helped set up a 34-yard field goal for he win. FIRST AND McCOWN McCown has had trouble on all of his first series in his five starts as Browns quarterback: • At New York, he fumbled at the goal line and suffered a concussion that knocked him out of the next seven quarters. • Against Oakland, the series ended on a fourth-and-14 from the 23. • At San Diego, his first two series were three-and-outs. • At Baltimore, he got the ball at his own 40 after the defense made a quick stop but went three-and-out. • Against Denver on Sunday, he led the Browns to just 94 yards of first-half offense and trailed 10-0. DOING THE MATH • Among active linebackers, Dansby ranks first in career interceptions (18) and pick-sixes (five). He had two interceptions Sunday, including one he returned 35 yards for a touchdown in the fourth quarter. • Gary Barnidge’s magnificent breakthrough reached a new level Sunday. He accounted for the Browns’ two offensive touchdowns on second-half catches of 11 and 14 yards. Barnidge joined Ozzie Newsome as the only Browns tight ends to catch at least one TD pass in four consecutive games. Through six games, Barnidge has 27 catches for 413 yards and five touchdowns. • Travis Benjamin had a huge second half, making seven of his nine catches for 104 of his 117 yards. Through six games, Benjamin has 31 catches for 528 yards. In his three previous Browns seasons combined, he had 41 catches for 717 yards. • McCown’s passer rating Sunday was 63.3, dropping his season rating from 102.8 to 94.6. Johnny Manziel’s passer rating for his seven quarters of action is 99.7. Page 3 of 4 - • The Broncos got a 74-yard pick-six from Chris Harris in a 16-10 win at Oakland. A week later, they got a 63-yard pick-six by Aquib Talib in the overtime win against the Browns. • Pierre Desir, starting in place of injured Joe Haden, got picked on by Manning and was credited with 12 tackles (not a good thing for a cornerback). • The Browns played a second straight overtime game for the first time since 2002, when they won at Tennessee and lost at home to Pittsburgh. THE HORSE’S MOUTH Key points from Pettine after Sunday’s overtime loss: • His overview: “We just made too many mistakes. “Defensively, it was one of our better efforts. Offensively, we did some good things against a pretty good defense, but we just weren’t consistent enough. We got ourselves behind the sticks and allowed them to tee off.” • On his decision to go for two after the Browns took a 20-16 lead with 8:07 left in regulation (the attempt failed): “You are up four. You are looking at how many possessions are left in the game. They had not scored a touchdown to that point. It was essentially a field goal game. “If you only go up five, two field goals beats you. Also if you go up six and then you kick a field goal, you are now up nine, which makes it a two-score game on their part. “We discussed it. It was at that fringe time on our notes, whether to do it. Obviously, knowing the end of the movie, now you would have liked to kick it.” • On McCown’s performance: “Just along with the other guys offensively, inconsistent.” “There are some plays that I know he wants back. Can’t turn the ball over against a team like that and put Peyton Manning back on the field.” LOCKER-ROOM CHATTER • Karlos Dansby on stealing the ball from running back Ronnie Hillman and turning it into a 35-yard pick-six. “(Hillman) got out fast. (Manning) pump faked at his tight end. When he did that, I knew he had to check it down. It was a bad throw. It bounced off of his shoulder pad and I just caught it.” • Linebacker Paul Kruger on the team mood after Barkevious Mingo picked off Manning in overtime: “You don’t want to celebrate too much too fast, but it is pretty close to feeling like you have it wrapped up.” • The Browns did not have a sack against Manning. Page 4 of 4 - “He’s up there in terms of guys who get the ball out,” Kruger said. “A lot of teams get the ball out quick now. When we played the Raiders, it seemed like the guy never had the ball more than a second or two.” • Left tackle Joe Thomas on Denver’s defense: “It is the best defense we’ve faced. They are the No. 1 defense in the NFL because of their pass rush and their corners. I thought we did a really good job for a vast majority of the game against them. That overtime drive where we just went backwards and the opportunity in regulation to score a touchdown and go ahead and we ended up with a field goal are the two disappointing drives, where we had a chance to win and didn’t.” • Denver’s Talib on his 63-yard pick-six that gave Denver a 10-0 lead: “I was looking at myself on the scoreboard. I planned on high-stepping, but I saw that (Travis) Benjamin was coming, so I had to turn on the jets.” EXTRA POINTS • The Browns went “young underdogs” with their game-day captains, sending K’Waun Williams, Taylor Gabriel, Isaiah Crowell and Armonty Bryant out for the coin toss. Three of them were undrafted in 2014. Bryant was a Round 7 pick in 2013. • Earnest Byner and Kevin Mack were honored at halftime to mark the 30th anniversary of both surpassing 1,000 rushing yards for the Browns. • Backup tight end Rob Housler left the game with a hamstring injury suffered while playing special teams. • Denver has won its last 11 games against the Browns and leads the all-time series 20-5. • The Broncos are 4-0 on the road.
