During his three years in high school football, the nimble running back rushed for more than 5,000 yards and a PSAL-record 80 touchdowns, helping Fort Hamilton win back-to-back championships.\nNow, as a freshman at the University of Maine, Walcott is just trying to fit in.\nThe Black Bears (1-2) have been using Walcott in a variety of roles, allowing him to catch the football as well as carry it.\nHere, the former Fort Hamilton running back talks about fitting into his new role, learning a more complex playbook and adjusting to life on the Orono, Maine, campus.\n\"Everybody in college is bigger, faster and stronger, but I'm not really surprised; this is what I was expecting. I'm still 17 years old and some of the guys I play against are 21, 22, so they're just physically stronger.\n\"Then, the whole offense is more complex. There are 11 formations that I've had to learn. Man, it's a whole different story from high school. They have me as the slash in the backfield, so everything I do is in running motion. I've carried the ball and had a screen pass for a few yards. They're trying to work me into plays. It's good.\n\"I miss home sometimes, but the campus life here is chill. Everyone's friendly. There's no hostility. They get behind the team and the stadium gets packed. I just want to get better every game and grasp the playbook more. I still check in with Fort Hamilton to see how they're doing. I'll always do that.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T10:13:38.902+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
