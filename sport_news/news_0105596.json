In fact, the Red Raiders have scored a touchdown in the first quarter of every game this season until facing the Kansas Jayhawks. Luckily, Texas Tech's slow start was not enough of a setback to keep it from victory.\nHere are five thoughts following the Red Raiders' 30-20 win against the Jayhawks.\n1. Points off turnovers\nThis category helped stabilize the scoreboard for both teams. J.J. Gaines forced and recovered a fumble from Darious Crawley in the second quarter and the Red Raiders capped the following drive with a one-yard touchdown rush by senior running back DeAndre Washington.\nThe biggest points off turnover came in a quirky series where the Jayhawks, down three, nearly played their way back into the football game late in the fourth quarter. However, freshman quarterback Ryan Willis was intercepted by redshirt freshman defensive back and Ennis product, Jah'Shawn Johnson. Johnson returned the interception 27 yards for a touchdown and ultimately cemented the outcome - a victory for Texas Tech.\n2. Injuries piling up\nIn our season preview, one of the Red Raiders' worst-case scenarios involved senior left tackle Le'Raven Clark suffering a significant injury. Clark went down favoring his leg in the second quarter and did not return for the Red Raiders.\nClark's injury was felt immediately. The offensive line ranked third in the Big 12 in sacks allowed gave up five sacks to Kansas and struggled to find much consistency in their running game.\nClark was not the only Red Raider injured during the contest, as sophomore defensive back Nigel Bethel and junior defensive back Paul Banks were both sidelined with injuries. Bethel was able to finish the game.\n3. Creativity is key\nAlthough Clark did suffer an injury and was unable to finish the second half, the Red Raiders showed creativity in getting their 6-foot-6, 308-pound left tackle the football. Clark took an extra point snap and shuffled into the end zone behind a stable of Texas Tech offensive linemen and put the Red Raiders ahead 11-0 before halftime.\nOffensive coordinator Eric Morris and head coach Kliff Kingsbury have not been shy about getting explorative in their playcalling and their aggressiveness was on full display when Clark broke the plain of the goal line.\nWatch as Le'Raven Clark houses the 2-point conversion, to put Tech up by 11! #LetTheBigDogEat #WreckEm http://t.co/LvifmydUXm\nâ” TechGameday (@TechGameday) October 17, 2015 4. Red zone success\nLast season the Red Raiders had few problems stacking up the yards, offensively. For Texas Tech, the trouble was translating those yards into points inside the red zone, where the Red Raiders scored on 72 percent of all visits - good enough for last in the Big 12.\nAn argument could be made that Texas Tech scored on chunk plays and rarely made it to the red zone, however Oklahoma State and Kansas both made fewer red zone trips and scored at a more efficient rate.\nIn a relatively low-scoring game for Texas Tech, the Red Raiders' 17 red zone points proved to be a deciding factor.\n5. Special teams catastrophe\nWhere to start? In a game that was ultimately decided by 10 points, the Jayhawks left exactly 10 points on the scoreboard by way of special teams mishaps.\nJunior kicker Matthew Wyman missed a pair of field goals - one from 52 yards and another from 34 yards before halftime - and an extra point in the third quarter. Sophomore Nick Bartolotta added to the missed opportunities with a 22-yard missed field goal in the second quarter.\nHow close was Kansas to winning this game? Closer than you may think.\nThe Red Raiders also contributed to the special teams mishaps when an extra point from sophomore Clayton Hatfield was blocked in the second quarter. There were no Lou Groza award ballots being cast in this game.\nFollow Mike DuPont on Twitter: @MikeDuPont_\nComplete Texas Tech coverage Gary Rohman/Gary Rohman/MLS/USA TODAY Sports\nOct 17, 2015; Lawrence, KS, USA; Texas Tech Red Raiders head coach Kliff Kingsbury talks to his team in the first half against the Kansas Jayhawks at Memorial Stadium.
