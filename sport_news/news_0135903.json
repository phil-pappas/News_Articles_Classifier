He is not robotic on the floor. His face does change as his and his team’s fortunes do. \nHell, he had DeAndre Jordan almost laughing after one particular exchange Sunday night in Vancouver as the two came together under the basket during the Raptors first pre-season game. And making Jordan laugh on the court is not easy. \nAs they headed back up the floor, Jordan kept looking back at Ross trying to get his attention, the smile still on his face. Ross, to his credit, was already on to the next possession. \nAs simple as this sounds, Ross was having fun, more fun than in the past we would suggest. He was coming off the bench, he was defending and he was smiling far more than usual. \nWhat this means to his overall production heading into 2015-2016 is obviously open to interpretation, but it’s certainly a better sign than had he been tight or stone-faced in his first appearance of the 2015-16 season. \nThere is a confidence and a comfort about Ross already this year that wasn’t there a year ago. And it was apparent even in training camp as he took his turn addressing the media, something we are pretty sure he would pay money to avoid if that were an option. \nRoss, though, surprised those with his candour and the way he engaged in that setting. Again, it may be the least favourite part of his work duties. But he was good. He was different than in the past. \nHe was asked about these subtle changes after Sunday’ game. \nPart of it is health, he explained. Ross is no longer limited by bone spurs in his ankle, which keep him from doing the things he wanted to do a year ago. But part of it too, and not even Ross is sure which part is bigger, is his role is clearly defined this year and he’s happy in it. \nThe arrival of DeMarre Carroll has moved Ross to the bench and rather than pout about the lost minutes he’s embracing his new role. \n“It’s both,” he said. “I feel a little more, not pep in my step, but more mobile I guess. Now I have the ability to kind of play without pain.” \nAnd as for that role change from a starter at the beginning of last year to coming off the bench this season, which is always a toss up in terms of how the player will react, Ross is fine with it. \n“It’s fun,” he said. “I just go out there and play. It takes pressure off and kind of lets me do a little more whether that’s offensively or defensively. It just gives me a chance to go out there and just play more.” \nWith the second unit Ross no longer is concerned with the Raptors go-to guys getting their’s. He doesn’t have to worry a foray he makes to the hoop comes at the expense of one that might be made by DeMar DeRozan or Kyle Lowry. \nIn short, Ross is at peace with just about everything around him. That’s a good thing for him going into a contract year and that’s a good thing for the Raptors who need him to be a presence at both ends on that second unit. \nKYLE TAKES A DAY \nKyle Lowry showed no signs of any weakness or injury in Sunday’s win over the Clippers, but a day later Raptors head coach Dwane Casey believes he should have sat him down. \n“We had talked about him being sore the day before in practice,” Casey said. “He felt better, but he probably shouldn’t have went (Sunday) night just because it is pre-season. But this (sitting out Monday night) gives us an opportunity to play some of the younger guys and get Delon Wright some extended minutes. \nAll Lowry did in 211/2 minutes was lead the team in scoring with 26 points and played some pretty solid and very active defence on Chris Paul. \nVALANCIUNAS FEATURED \nThe Raptors pre-season game in Vancouver wasn’t two minutes old and Jonas Valanciunas had already had four touches. \nHis first he turned around, faced DeAndre Jordan, one of the best defenders in the league and shot over him drawing a foul. \nIt was the beginning of a pretty solid night for the Lithuanian centre, although there was the matter of five turnovers. \n“I love JV a ton but when you have five turnovers as a centre that’s way too many,” Casey said after the game. “We’ve got to make sure we get those cut down and that’s on me because we haven’t worked on a lot of offence … but we have to take care of the basketball.” \nBut the fact that Valanciunas was being fed so early, so frequently, was not a mistake. \n“Trying to get him some reps in there, just to go against one of the best defensive players in the league and that might be the reason why we had five turnovers in the low post,” Casey said. “We were trying to go to him to see what he had. I thought he did a decent job but, again, we have to make sure we make the right play.” \nCasey doesn’t want anyone forcing anything. In fact he sounds like he wouldn’t mind his players searching out a better option than themselves particularly early in the shot clock. \n“We’re trying to have the mentality that just because we call a play, it doesn’t mean it’s for you, it’s for the Toronto Raptors, not for a certain player,” Casey said. “Make sure you’re ready to attack but you can still be a passer in that situation.” \nValanciunas wound up with 10 points and 12 rebounds in just over 22 minutes. A solid pre-season debut for the Raptors young centre whose role is expected to expand this year. \nWHAT’S ALL THE FUSS \nA world championship doesn’t hurt, but it was still a little surprising to see the line outside the SAP Center in San Jose basically circling the building a full 21/2 hours before game time. It’s about an hour south of Oracle Arena so there is obviously a fan base here, but the line may have had more to do with the Steff Curry bobble head giveaway than anything else. \nQUICK HITS \nCasey on his team’s defence after watching the tape: “It looked pretty good. We did a better job of packing the paint,” Casey said. “It’s not a lot different from what we were preaching last year, but different results and different personnel. It was a good start.”… Interim Warriors head coach Luke Walton is filling in for Steve Kerr following back surgery for a ruptured disc in late July and a follow-up surgery in September was admittedly nervous for his first game with the reigns. Kerr’s lead assistant was asked if his father, hall of famer Bill Walton had any advice for him. “He told to to call about six coaches and then he listed seven books I should read,” Walton said adding he didn’t do either. Walton said he was just hoping the nervousness he was feeling was a lot like the nervousness he had as a player and would disappear as soon as the game began.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T06:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T07:01:50.498+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
