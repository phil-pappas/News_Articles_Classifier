Michigan’s defense is on an unreal roll, and there’s no ignoring the possibilities.\nThe next stop is against a bitter rival, and the next step is to prove it can stuff a multi-dimensional offense. Michigan made a mockery of its showdown with Northwestern Saturday, stomping to a 38-0 victory that wasn’t that close.\nThe hype will ratchet wildly now, with unbeaten but wounded Michigan State looming. The Spartans are still hunting for a playoff berth after their 31-24 escape at Rutgers, while the Wolverines are hunting for more than just a solid turnaround in Jim Harbaugh’s first season. It’ll be one of the biggest clashes in the rivalry’s history, and the Wolverines (5-1) should be favored based on how they’re playing.\nThey’re playing with a fervor, stirred to a froth by their head coach and his staff. This was a decimation from the beginning — Jehu Chesson returned the opening kickoff 96 yards for a touchdown — to the end, when Harbaugh left most of his starters in to preserve the shutout. It was Michigan’s third straight blanking, something the program hadn’t done since 1980, and Harbaugh didn’t downplay the message.\nWas the shutout meaningful?\n“Yes,” he said, and elaboration wasn’t really necessary.\nThe crowd was standing and chanting “Dee-fense” as Northwestern took over on its own 23 with 2:14 left, and roared when the drive went nowhere.\nHarbaugh probably shouldn’t make a habit of playing his starters to the end of 38-point victories, but I get the point. He’s determined to stamp his message as ruthlessly and quickly as he can. He preaches relentlessness and then lets his team show it, and he’s doing everything possible to pump the confidence.\n“The fellas really came out balling,” Harbaugh said. “They played a heckuva ballgame, really pleased.”\nZero numb game \nThe opposition hasn’t been overly daunting but the numbers are staggering. Michigan has outscored its last three opponents – BYU, Maryland, Northwestern – 97-0, and hasn’t allowed a point on 41 consecutive possessions. Northwestern came in 5-0 and ranked 13th, but its conference-best rushing attack (248.8 yards per game) was completely stuffed (38 yards). The Wildcats had surrendered 35 points all season and were No. 1 in the country in scoring defense, a spot now occupied by the Wolverines.\nMichigan’s offense is far from explosive, although Jake Rudock is getting more and more comfortable running the no-frills attack. It complements the defense, hanging onto the ball for lengthy drives, dominating time of possession. It’s the way Harbaugh coaches, using all his tight ends, fullbacks and running backs, and letting his defense tee off.\nHarbaugh said defensive coordinator D.J. Durkin called a “near-flawless” game, and if the Wolverines are finally to smite the Spartans, he’ll have to do the same. Despite its periodic struggles, Michigan State is 6-0 and still in the middle of everything, even as injuries pile up. Michigan has the better defense, but Connor Cook and those terrific receivers, along with tailback LJ Scott, present a huge challenge.\nIf Michigan’s defense truly is as dominant as it appears, we’ll know by about 7 p.m. next Saturday in Ann Arbor. Defensive end Willie Henry has become a force, collecting two of the team’s four sacks against Northwestern, and was in Clayton Thorson’s face so often, I’m fairly certain he could guess the quarterback’s toothpaste choice. It helps to have a talented secondary that can play press coverage, led by Jourdan Lewis and Jabrill Peppers.\nLewis had a 37-yard interception return for a touchdown, snatching the ball from the receiver. Michigan’s secondary against Michigan State’s receivers will be a fascinating strength-on-strength matchup.\n“We have a lot of talented guys that take pride in what they do,” Peppers said. “When you have a group of 11 guys hungry to do their jobs, the sky’s the limit. … We just wanted to come out here and make a statement.”\nShift into the 'D' \nThe statement was, Michigan’s defense is legitimate, a message reverberating around the Big Ten. The question is, can the Wolverines generate enough offense — and avoid turnovers — to allow their defense to control games.\nAmid the Harbaugh-mania, a couple things are apparent. One is that Brady Hoke didn’t exactly leave the talent cupboard bare. The other is, a healthy Peppers makes a big difference.\nThere’s no stopping the hype-train now, although Harbaugh declines to blow any horns. He again gave proper props to Michigan State — “tremendous opponent” — and admitted the task would be tough.\nAt least this year, the Wolverines bring some of their own elements of toughness, after getting steamrolled six of the past seven meetings. On both sides of the ball, they’re marching steadily toward the physical style they’ve pledged to adopt.\n“That’s a good sign that you’re building a good callus, when you can play physical and not get beat up yourself,” Harbaugh said. “That callus is hardening, like the callus on a foot.”\nHardening just in time for the annual slugfest. And this one looks like a much, much more even fight.\nbob.wojnowski@detroitnews.com \ntwitter.com/bobwojnowski", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T03:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T08:05:21.797+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
