I’m all about the action.” \nThe field, which was hosting its third game in as many days, resembled a swamp before the game began, and the rain never let up. When the ball got muddy – which was after each play— at least the officials always had a puddle nearby to clean the ball. \n“Terrible, horrible conditions, but we got to run the ball more and get more exposure,” said Austin DePeralta, who scored from a yard out early in the third quarter to give Waiakea a 21-0 lead. \nThe Warriors switched feature backs with each series after Tevis Holi limped off the field on the opening drive. \nThe Warriors’ victory finalized the Division I playoff matchups. In two weeks in the semifinals, Keaau (0-6 BIIF, 0-7) will play at top seed Kealakehe, while the Warriors (2-4 BIIF, 2-7) will head to Wong Stadium to take on Hilo High. \nThe Vikings thumped Waiakea on muddy terrain at Wong on Sept. 25. \n“We need better conditions,” Perez-Poia said. \nStarting the game with white jerseys and white pants, the Warriors looked worse for the wear, but they were in control from the outset. \n“Not the best for football, but it was fun, definitely,” quarterback Gehrig Octavio said. \nOn the opening drive of the game, Waiakea marched 72 yards on nine plays, with Octavio scoring on a 2-yard run. \nEach team completed just two passes. \nOctavio’s 26-yard completion to Hunter Rapoza set up DePeralta’s score. Rapoza also scored on a quarterback keeper and Octavio kicked a field goal. \n“We have to keep this momentum going,” DePeralta said. \nThe Cougars were held to 92 yards of offense, and their best play-maker was Delton Gonsalves, who picked off two Octavio passes. \nWaiakea coach Moku Pita said quarterback Makoa Andres would return for the regular-season finale at Kealakehe, but the Warriors didn’t miss his arm against the Cougars. \nWhy pass? \n“Easy running,” Perez-Poia said. “Keep it on the ground.” \nWaiakea 7 7 10 6 —30 \nKeaau 0 0 0 0 — 0 \nFirst quarter \nWaiakea – Gehrig Octavio 2 run (Octavio kick), 3:28 \nSecond quarter \nWaiakea –Keli’i Perez-Poai 2 run (Octavio kick), 7:03 \nThird quarter \nWaiakea – Austin DePeralta 1 run (Octavio kick), 8:15 \nWaiakea – FG 28 Octavio, :17 \nFourth quarter \nWaiakea — Hunter Rapoza 4 run (pass failed), 8:09 Rules for posting comments \nComments posted below are from readers.
