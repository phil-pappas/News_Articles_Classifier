Sperber announced on Monday that all of the track's grandstands seats are sold out for the Quicken Loans Race for Heroes 500 NASCAR Sprint Cup Series race on Sunday, Nov. 15.\nIt will be the fifth straight sellout for the fall race at PIR.\n\"Going back to the controversial Gordon-Bowyer fight in 2012, Kevin Harvick’s last-lap pass for the win in 2013 and last year’s race when Kevin delivered in a must-win situation and Ryan Newman made that gutsy pass in the final turn, PIR has earned a reputation for having one of the most exciting and dramatic races of the year,\" Sperber said in a statement. \"We’re seeing that reflected by the enthusiasm from fans to secure their tickets earlier and guarantee themselves a spot for the excitement this fall.\"\nThere are still seats available for the hillside area, which is general admission, as well as to the races on Friday - the Lucas Oil 150 NASCAR Camping World Truck Series race - and Saturday - the DAV 200, Honoring America’s Veterans NASCAR XFINITY Series race. Friday tickets are $30 and Saturday tickets are $35.\nGo to PhoenixRaceway.com or call 866-408-RACE to buy tickets.", "external_links": ["http://www.phoenixraceway.com/?homepage=true"], "published": "2015-10-20T00:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T22:27:48.850+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
