I turned around quickly and saw you. Then I lost it.\nYou may not realize it, but you're not the first guy who has done this to me. But you're the first one I caught, and you caught my full anger for every instance this has happened.\nI leaned in quick and shoved you so hard without even thinking. You feel forward a few steps and then said \"Fuck you!\" in your embarrassment.\nI got even more mad that you insulted me and said \"No, FUCK YOU\" right back and found a bouncer.\nI told him what happened and he began to talk you into leaving. You looked around all surprised like you were a fucking victim and started to tell him what I said was bullshit.\nI don't know what happened at that point. I lost it. Maybe it was your horrible treatment of me as a whole person, reducing me to a quick grab for your enjoyment. Maybe it was your complete denial or your behavior. Maybe it was the number of times this has happened before, or a combination.\nBut I was ready to kill you. I've never ever in my entire life gotten in anyone's face the way I did with you at that moment. I was completely unleashed. And I don't even drink. It was just pure anger.\nI tell you this asshole. You are lucky you got thrown out and are even luckier I did not call the cops on you. Luckier still I did not tell my brother and his friends until you were gone.\nBe notified. I will not take this shit from you or anyone ever again. Shoving you felt so good. Protecting myself and standing up for myself felt so good.\nSo be on alert fuckhead. If you grab, I will stab. And FUCK YOU.\nContact: Michael Roberts Follow: Michael Roberts Westword Westword", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/pages/Michael-RobertsWestword/111180895657427", "http://www.twitter.com/denverwestword", "https://www.facebook.com/DenverWestword", "https://boulder.craigslist.org/rnr/5236485205.html"], "published": "2015-10-19T15:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T23:09:58.060+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
