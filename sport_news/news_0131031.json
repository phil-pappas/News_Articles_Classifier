Comment   Brock Sisney Posted Oct. 20, 2015 at 12:01 AM Updated at 11:42 PM Posted Oct. 20, 2015 at 12:01 AM Updated at 11:42 PM MONETT — The Aurora Lady Houns rebounded from a rough second set to take the third set and claim the Class 3, District 10 championship with a 2-1 win (25-18, 14-25, 25-16) Tuesday over the East Newton Lady Patriots. East Newton built on its momentum early in the third set, as Koty Cooper’s finesse shot gave the Lady Patriots a 6-5 lead. “We definitely had the momentum,” East Newton head coach Kiley Finkbiner said. “We struggled getting that momentum in the third set. We had it going into it and we just lost it almost right from when the game started.” The Lady Houns chang-ed up the pace offensively and began using offspeed against the Lady Patriots. “They were tipping and that’s something that we’ve struggled with all year,” Finkbiner said. “They started making adjustments. We’re a good defensive team. We can dig balls that are hit real well, but when other teams start to tip, we have a hard time with it. They definitely made adjustments and it definitely worked in their favor.” East Newton’s season, the first under Finkbiner, comes to a 14-14-4 overall record and district runner-up finish. “We changed a lot of things up,” Finkbiner said. “I feel like we were successful as a team. We accomplished goals that we had set at the beginning of the year. Even though winning districts was one of our goals, we still accomplished almost everything that we wanted.” Lady Patriot seniors Kortney Cambers, Bethany Moorehouse, Kayley Cook and Emily Nagle played their final high school matches. “We will miss them,” Finkbiner said. “We will miss their leadership. They had great leadership for us. That leadership will be something that we’ll be looking for next year and it will be greatly missed.” In the Aurora match, Cooper finished with nine kills, four aces and three blocks. Cambers had 12 digs and three aces. Ashlyn Kirby led the way with 12 assists. Aurora improved to 23-10-2 on the season. East Newton defeated Hollister 2-0 (25-23, 25-20) in the semifinals, a match leading directly into Aurora, who had dispatched Seneca 2-0 in the opener. Cooper finished with a double-double, her semifinal performance including 14 kills, 14 digs, four aces and three blocks. Cambers both opened and finished her night with 12 digs. Shelby Hance and Kirby combined for 19 assists (Hance 10, Kirby 9). McDonald County falls in semis JOPLIN — The McDonald County Lady Mustangs were simply overpowered by the top-seeded Carthage Lady Tigers in the Class 4, District 12 semifinals Tuesday. Carthage’s front line including junior middle hitter Kiley Tiller, senior outside hitter Maya Williams and senior middle hitter Lydiah Shanks seemed to be everywhere and the Tigers moved into the district final with a 2-0 win (25-19, 25-12). Page 2 of 2 - “Our plan was to play aggressive and to keep them off the net,” McDonald County head coach Kacha Kuhn said. “We didn’t give ourselves enough opportunities. They played really well tonight and we committed a few unforced errors that you just can’t afford to have against a team with that much talent. “My girls played hard and competed. I’m proud of them in all positions. We’ve grown a lot this year. We’re excited to come back next year. I’ve got two seniors, which we’ll miss, but then the rest are juniors and this will be their third year of varsity experience. We’re looking forward to next year.” McDonald County ended its season with a 14-15-1 overall record. In her final match, Brittney Stone had six service points, one ace and two kills. Riley Rickman tallied three service points and Lauren Goff served an ace. Lindsey Limore paced the front line with four kills, while Alex Gross joined Stone with two kills. Destiny Arnall had eight assists, while Goff led with six digs and Gross added five. Arnall, Limore, Gross, Goff, Rickett and Rickman will all be seniors next season. Kuhn talked about her outgoing seniors Stone and Michela Wells. \"Brittney Stone is our outside hitter,\" Kuhn said. \"She’s been playing varsity since her sophomore year. She’s an outstanding athlete. She’s matured just mentally, physically. Throughout four years, it’s just been a joy to have her in our program and we’ll miss her. We hope that she’ll go on to play (college) and we can go watch her next year. \"Michela Wells, she was injured for two years. She played her freshman year, managed for us for two years and came back her senior year. She just loves the game and we love having her around. She’s just one of those solid, good attitude all the time kids.\" Marley Hensley led Carthage with 18 assists and two aces, Kiley Tiller had 10 kills and Rayna Jefferis tallied 10 digs. The Lady Tigers, however, fell short of the district title, as Republic knocked off Carl Junction 2-0 in the semifinals and Carthage 2-0 in the championship match. Republic improved to 14-15-3 on the season and Carthage finished 26-8-2.
