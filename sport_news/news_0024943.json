It’s crazy. It makes you feel like you’re doing something for the organization.” \nHutton, 22, has done everything to quickly transition pucks out of his own zone and give the second power play unit a new dimension. \nHe started the sequence for Bo Horvat’s man-advantage goal Saturday in a 3-2 overtime loss to the Calgary Flames, a heated home opener that was settled at 3:03 of the session when Brandon Sutter was stripped of the puck and Johnny Gaudreau scored. \nIt spoiled a great kiddie show. When Brandon Bollig gave Daniel Sedin a cross-check to the back in front of the benches to spark a mini-melee, Hutton came charging in to confront the Flames winger. And he almost won it in overtime. \nIf that wasn’t enough, rookie centre Jared McCann, 19, looked like Markus Naslund when he bolted through the slot, and without any hesitation, wired a wrist shot past the glove of Jonas Hiller for his first NHL goal. And Jake Virtanen, 19, has yet to play in the regular season. \nKeep this up and the kids will become cult figures in this town. In Hutton, the Canucks suddenly don’t need GPS to get pucks out of their zone. In McCann, they have a potential trigger man with three-zone awareness. And in Virtanen, they have a bowling-ball winger who could make his regular-season debut Monday in Anaheim or Tuesday in Los Angeles. \nMore importantly, in rewarding strong pre-season performances and understanding you can get younger and better at the same time, the Canucks have offered up entertainment and hope. Fans are willing to accept losing if there’s effort and something to place their faith in. \nThe established core has laid the foundation, but if the kids remain capable the retool-on-the-fly mantra will be much more than just marketing. It will fill seats. \nbkuzma@theprovince.com \ntwitter.com/benkuzma © Copyright (c) The Province E-mail this Article Print this Article Share this Article", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T12:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T14:12:01.159+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
