Joe Rexrode, Detroit Free Press 4:39 p.m. EDT October 1, 2015 Recruiting analyst says there have been rumblings regarding Josh Jackson's interest in the Spartans (Photo: David R. Lutman/Special to The CJ Louisville) \nThe best recruiting class in Tom Izzo’s career, the No. 1 recruiting class in the nation and a complete five-man lineup that could strike fear into most college basketball teams. \nThat’s where the conversation is drifting in regard to Izzo’s 2016 class, with one major prospect announcing Saturday and the top-ranked player in the class perhaps on the horizon. If Miles Bridges picks MSU over Kentucky and Indiana on Saturday at Mott Community College in his hometown of Flint, Izzo will add a consensus top-15 player and 6-foot-6 combo forward to point guard Cassius Winston (U-D Jesuit), shooting guard Joshua Langford (Madison, Ala.) and big man Nick Ward (Columbus, Ohio). \n“The ultimate destination of Miles Bridges is starting to look pretty clear here,” Rivals.com analyst Eric Bossi said Thursday of Bridges leaning toward MSU, and the fact that Kentucky received a verbal commitment Thursday from a similar player – 6-10 combo forward Wenyen Gabriel from Wilbraham, Mass. – only reinforces that idea. More good signs for MSU with recruit Miles Bridges \n“I think before Wenyen Gabriel committed to Kentucky, all signs were looking extremely positive for MSU with Miles Bridges,” Bossi said on “The Schuiling Report” on 92.1-FM in Lansing. “But then picking up a guy that’s gonna play on the wing and (power forward) some certainly doesn’t hurt MSU’s chances … It may be just as much John Calipari trying to finish that one up first so he can say, it’s always the battle of who wanted who and who gave up on who first (in recruiting). So maybe there’s a little bit of showmanship involved in trying to get him to pop first.” \nIf MSU gets Bridges, the most celebrated class of Izzo’s tenure is assured. But if MSU adds a fifth player to the class in consensus No. 1 recruit Josh Jackson? \n“Now we really start to dream big time, we start talking Josh Jackson,” Bossi said of MSU and a 6-7 wing from Detroit who plays in Napa, Calif. “There’s been lots of rumbles lately that maybe he’s really starting to really consider Michigan State seriously, and maybe even perhaps leaning that way.” \nThe first step is the word from Bridges, and then the very quiet recruitment of Jackson could become more of an MSU story.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T23:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T07:01:10.615+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
