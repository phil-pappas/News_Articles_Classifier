(USC SID) -- The South Carolina women’s basketball team will hold an open practice at Goose Creek High School on Sat., Oct. 24, from 1:30 to 4 p.m. Admission is free, but fans are encouraged to bring a non-perishable food donation to benefit the Low Country Food Bank.“Our fans are so vital to our program, so I really like this opportunity to let those outside of Columbia get a look at what our team is like outside of game day – how hard they work, how close they are, everything,” South Carolina head coach Dawn Staley said. “We know there are a lot of people in the Charleston area that make the drive to Columbia many times during a season to support us, and I’m happy we’re able to return the favor at least this once.”Goose Creek High School is located at 1137 Red Bank Road, and fans are encouraged to park in the lot at the main entrance. The gymnasium, which can accommodate up to 1,000 fans, faces Garwood Road.The Gamecocks officially begin practice for the 2015-16 season today in Columbia.

Five seniors lead the team, including all three returning starters in Asia Dozier, two-time All-American Tiffany Mitchell and Khadijah Sessions. Sharp shooter Tina Roy and transfer forward Sarah Imovbioh complete the notable senior class. A pair of SEC Freshman of the Year winners in junior Alaina Coates and sophomore A’ja Wilson anchor the frontcourt, which will be further bolstered by the healthy return of sophomore Jatarie White. Redshirt freshman Doniyah Cliney and freshman Shay Colley join Bianca Cuevas, Kaydra Duckett and India Farmer in shoring up the South Carolina backcourt. Junior Tiffany Davis will miss the 2015-16 season recovering from a knee injury.South Carolina makes its Colonial Life Arena debut in an exhibition game against Newberry on Fri., Nov. 6, at 7 p.m. Admission is free with general admission seating, and the game will air on SEC Network+.
