Shah said the PBCC had started preparations for the Asia Cup and the team was also shortlisted but now the scenario has changed all of sudden in India. \nHe said that the ICC decision to call back Aleem Dar midway during the India-South Africa series had left the PBCC with no option but to decide that in present atmosphere, it would be \"unfair to send the Pakistan team players and officials to India.\" \nThe Pakistan Blind team has in the past travelled to India for major events. \nMeanwhile, the Pakistan Olympic Association has also said that it would take up the issue of security of Pakistan contingent in the South Asian Games which will be held in India also in January next year. \n\"If the Indian delegation assures satisfactory security arrangements for our contingent only then can we consider taking part in the SAF Games,\" POA secretary Khalid Mahmood told reporters. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T02:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T04:31:56.517+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
