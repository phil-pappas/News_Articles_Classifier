Here's some reaction from around the nation.\nGet to know this name: Daylon Mack https://t.co/dIALVNQHNj\n— ESPN CollegeFootball (@ESPNCFB) September 19, 2015 Steven Cook, Bleacher Report: \"There wasn't really any doubt before, but Kyle Allen further proved his status as an upper-echelon SEC quarterback Saturday...constantly evading pressure and hitting Christian Kirk and Josh Reynolds for pretty scores in tight coverage.\"\nSam Khan Jr., ESPN: \"The Aggies remain undefeated and put in a solid -- though not perfect -- performance heading into their SEC opener against Arkansas next week. The offense looked good for the most part and the defense, though it did yield more points than the Aggies prefer, made plenty of big plays...\"\nThe late John David Crow & all of those old-school players would be proud of Brandon Williams today: Playing CB while earning carry, catch.\n— Brent Zwerneman (@BrentZwerneman) September 19, 2015 Robby Kalland (CBS) on Daylon Mack: \"My suggestion for Nevada would be to, you know, at least try to block him. That said, I can't really blame anyone for not wanting to.\"\nRandy Capps, Saturday Down South: Some Texas A&M fans might have been hoping for more of a statement win, but the offense had plenty of success, the defense created negative plays and everyone at Kyle Field went home happy. That's more than some teams are able to say, right?\nGreat note from @tom_hart : Nevada simulated Myles Garrett's first step in practice by having DEs line up offside.\n— Travis Haney (@TravHaneyESPN) September 19, 2015 On Twitter:\n @BrandonWheeland", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/TravHaneyESPN/status/645271787740069888", "http://espn.go.com/blog/ncfnation/post/_/id/115751/kyle-allen-accounts-for-5-tds-in-texas-ams-win-against-nevada", "http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2569361-nevada-vs-texas-am-game-grades-analysis-for-the-aggies", "https://twitter.com/BrandonWheeland", "https://twitter.com/ESPNCFB/status/645326529208131584", "https://twitter.com/BrentZwerneman/status/645306593530089472", "https://t.co/dIALVNQHNj", "http://www.cbssports.com/collegefootball/eye-on-college-football/25308454/texas-am-freshman-daylon-mack-tackles-qb-and-rb-at-the-same-time", "https://twitter.com/tom_hart", "http://www.saturdaydownsouth.com/tamu-football/aggies-notch-tuneup-win-entering-sec-play/"], "published": "2015-09-20T19:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T05:39:27.950+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
