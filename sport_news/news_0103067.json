We had a chance to win the district title going into the last game of 2014, but failed to capitalize. \nThis year, we were more motivated than ever to come out and win that coveted district title and, at the same time, surpass all of our accomplishments from last year. \nLast Friday night, we had our shot at redemption. \nA year ago, when we faced the Mount Vernon, we were down 10 at the half. We ended up rallying in the second half for 23-16 victory. \nThat was the turning point of our season last year. It installed the confidence in us that Anamosa football was officially back to relevance. \nThis time around, we were looking more than to just letting the state know we are back. We were looking to show the state we are ready for championships. \nWe traveled to Mount Vernon to take on the No. 6 Mustangs in a Class 2A Top 10 matchup with the district title on the line. \nWe knew eventually, if we wanted to be able to call ourselves champions, we would have to go through adversity. That adversity finally came after a six-game start to season with all blowouts. \nJust like a year ago, we were down at the half. \nWe were staring right at being runners-up in the district for the second straight year, facing a two touchdown deficit in the fourth quarter. \nWe had worked too hard, and come too far to just quit. \nWe battled back, and won one of the most thrilling high school football games ever be played in Anamosa history, 45-42. \nAnamosa football: 7-0, district champions and looking for much more history to be written in this special 2015 campaign.
