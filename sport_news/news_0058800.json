(Craig Robertson, Toronto Sun) Article Babcock won't allow Leafs to feel sorry for themselves \nBizarre plays were not the dominion of the Blue Jays this weekend. \nIn the end, the Maple Leafs can count their Thanksgiving blessings for NHL video replay, which confirmed Daniel Winnik’s tying goal in Saturday night’s third period against the Ottawa Senators and led to their first point for Mike Babcock in a 5-4 shootout loss. \nAfter it appeared a three-goal comeback in the Battle of Ontario would be wasted, Brad Boyes squeezed along the boards and centred a bouncing puck to Winnik. Finally settling the disc down, he deked Craig Anderson to make it 4-4. Or did he? \nAs he and Boyes celebrated, one of the referees waved it off, convinced it had hit the post. The two stunned Leafs hustled back, but the replay showed the puck had hit the TV camera attached to the centre bar. \nDespite the loss there is considerable relief that the Leafs wouldn’t spend a five-day break in the schedule suffering from the shock of no points in three losses. \nBoyes and P.A. Parenteau had their first points as Leafs on the goal, but the Sens won the shootout with goals from Bobby Ryan and Mike Hoffman on Ottawa nemesis James Reimer, with Parenteau getting one for Toronto. \nAfter three games in four nights, Babcock made the expected changes. The Leafs had come out with renewed purpose after being out-classed in Detroit the night before, in large part to some new forward units, defensive pairings, a change in goal and two new players in the lineup. \nTight-lipped after Babcock shelved him for the first two games, Roman Polak came back with Martin Marincin as his partner. That was part of a re-shuffled blueline with the left-shooting Morgan Rielly changing to the right to be with Matt Hunwick. That re-united Dion Phaneuf and Jake Gardiner. \nA late scratch with an upper-body injury from the Detroit game, Shawn Matthias was replaced by Michael Grabner, who swung on to left wing with Nazem Kadri and Boyes. Tyler Bozak and James van Riemsdyk had Leo Komarov added to their right side. \nIt all added up to 16 first-period shots, or as many as the Leafs had in the first 40 minutes against the Red Wings. But the last minute proved troublesome, a hooking call on Boyes that bled into the middle period. Helped by fresh ice, Kyle Turris was open in the slot and whipped the puck over Reimer’s glove. \nToronto’s chance to even the game on special teams was wasted when Gardiner was called for hooking. And there wasn’t a shout from the bench or a slap from Reimer’s stick to warn the five Leafs on the ice that Alex Chiasson was about to leave the box. He went upstairs on Reimer’s blocker side after taking Mika Zibanejad breakaway pass, with the Leaf coaches huddling briefly to see if they would challenge an offside. \nAnother power-play goal ensued after Parenteau got carried away with a hit to the head. Reimer couldn’t gobble up a hot point drive from Erik Karlsson and Milan Michalek pumped it by him before Hunwick could knock him down. \nThe Leafs shook it off, began to change lines and finally got on the board at 7:05. Winnik took out his man on the end board and gave Joffrey Lupul a break to beat Craig Anderson low. The latter is filling in while Andrew Hammond gets through a minor groin injury. \nReimer was big when he had to be on Ottawa’s next attempt, leading to one of captain Dion Phaneuf’s best assists as a Leaf. From the shadow of the Leaf net, Phaneuf feathered the puck to a breaking Bozak at the Ottawa blueline. Anderson’s pads opened up and Bozak moved within four goals of 100 as a Leaf. \nLupul drew an elbowing penalty and if not for some fortunate bounces of pucks that eluded Anderson, the game would have been tied entering the third. \nPeter Holland popped a pass from Parenteau through Anderson and under the bar to complete the comeback. But it was Ottawa winning a key draw halfway through the third. Hoffman’s shot was tipped by Mark Stone. That set up Winnik’s play and some 3-on-3 frivolity. Reimer stared down Curtis Lazar on a 2-on-1, Boyes missed a clear-cut breakaway and trailer Holland drew a penalty. \nBut the Leafs couldn’t end it before the shootout. \nlance.hornby@sunmedia.ca", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T06:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T06:17:31.142+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
