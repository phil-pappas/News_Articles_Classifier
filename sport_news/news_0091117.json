(SOUNDBITE) (English) AUSTRALIA HEAD COACH, MICHAEL CHEIKA, SAYING: \"I will say that we are, just in the middle of all that stuff, we are just right in the middle of where we need to improve massively I feel. I still think that consistency is where the improvement is needed. So, making sure that every day at training, and every match we play, is of the highest quality in those set-pieces, and that is what our goal is.\" 2. (SOUNDBITE) (English) AUSTRALIA LOCK, ROB SIMMONS, SAYING: \"I suppose a lot of areas (need improvement). Everyone is looking to improve on their own performance everyday so I don't think there is just one area we need to improve on. As a collective we just need to get better and probably as a forward pack to set a platform for our backs to unleash.\" 3. (SOUNDBITE) (English) AUSTRALIA HOOKER AND CAPTAIN, STEPHEN MOORE, SAYING: \"Yes, I think so, I think these guys (Argentina) certainly pride themselves on their set-piece, they scrummage very well. We have played against them before, I guess, and had a bit to do with them, but this is going to be a step-up.\" STORY: At a cagey news conference on Friday (October 23), Australia, and their head coach Michael Cheika, kept their focus on continuously improving ahead of their Rugby World Cup semi final with Argentina on Sunday (October 25). After escaping with victory by a single point over Scotland in last weekend's quarter final, Cheika is aware his team must improve before facing a dangerous Argentina side at Twickenham on Sunday. Daily improvement has been the philosophy echoed time and time again by Cheika and his players throughout the tournament, as they look to build the consistency that could prove telling come matchday. \"We are just right in the middle of where we need to improve massively I feel. I still think that consistency is where the improvement is needed,\" Cheika told the media on Friday. \"So, making sure that every day at training, and every match we play, is of the highest quality in those set-pieces, and that is what our goal is.\" This was a sentiment repeated by his players, who want to focus particularly on winning the forward battle and controlling the set-piece, two areas the Pumas have traditionally been strong at. \"Everyone is looking to improve on their own performance everyday so I don't think there is just one area we need to improve on. As a collective we just need to get better and probably as a forward pack to set a platform for our backs to unleash,\" said lock Rob Simmons. \"I think these guys (Argentina) certainly pride themselves on their set-piece, they scrummage very well. We have played against them before, I guess, and had a bit to do with them, but this is going to be a step-up,\" added the captain Stephen Moore, who will be making his 101st appearance for the Wallabies on Sunday. Australia are ranked second in the world behind New Zealand while Argentina have been the second most prolific team in the tournament in terms of their overall points and tries tallies, also behind New Zealand in those statistics.
