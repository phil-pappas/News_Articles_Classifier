The intruders reportedly bum-rushed their way into the home early Wednesday morning brandishing guns. At least six people were inside during the invasion and were able to fight them off.\nInvestigators told TMZ Sports that they believe the suspects had been in the home before, because they knew where security cameras inside the home were located. The cops also believe the intrusion may be gang-related, which is funny because Jackson was reportedly let go from the Eagles due to alleged gang ties . The Redskins wide receiver wasn't in the home at the time of the invasion.\nThis isn't the first time a home belonging to Jackson has been broken into. Last year, someone broke into his Philadelphia home and took $250,000 in cash, two semi-automatic handguns, $125,000 in jewelry, and a safe.\nNot only does DeSean have to deal with lingering injuries and trying to get back on the field, he has to deal with this, too. Might be time to get new friends.\n .", "external_links": ["http://www.tmz.com/2015/10/23/desean-jackson-home-invasion-victims-attacked-cops-gang-involvement/"], "published": "2015-10-23T19:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T13:46:00.042+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
