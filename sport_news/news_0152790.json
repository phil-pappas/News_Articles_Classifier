I want to be the first Bryce Aiken, not the next Kyrie Irving.” \nThe next step in Aiken's basketball journey will take him to Cambridge, Mass. — the senior point guard tells NJ Advance Media that he has committed to play for Harvard University. \n“Harvard presents a unique opportunity with a tremendous balance of both academics and basketball. Not too many people get the chance to say they go to Harvard,\" Aiken said. \"I just wanted to be different from the rest of the typical basketball players. I felt like this is the best situation for me.” \nA 6-foot, 185 pound guard from Randolph, Aiken is a four-star prospect ranked 78th in the class of 2016 by Scout.com and has been one of the top players in the state since his freshman season . He led the Celtics to the Union County Tournament title as a sophomore . \nAiken had a long list of suitors, but his decision boiled down to three schools: Seton Hall, Miami and Harvard. He visited all three finalists, and called his recruitment \"the most exciting and stressful process\" of his life. But when he sat down to make his final decision over the weekend, one school stood out above the rest. \n\"I had a meeting with my family. We just sat there and talked about all the pros and cons of each situation,\" Aiken said. \"We felt that Harvard would be the best situation for me.” \nThe chance to attend one of the best universities in the world while playing for a team that has made the NCAA Tournament every year since 2012 made Harvard a unique option. And when head coach Tommy Amaker and the entire Crimson coaching staff made it clear he was their priority, he couldn't say no. \n“It was an entire coaching staff effort. It wasn’t just one coach recruiting me, not just the assistants,\" Aiken said. \"They were on me through the entire way. And coach Amaker just did a tremendous job of explaining how he would use me in his system, and how he believed in me and trusted me to be the next great one from Harvard.” \nBut that doesn't mean it was an easy decision — and saying no to coaches he had built relationships with over years of his recruitment was tough. \nSaying no to Seton Hall was especially difficult for Aiken . He is close friends with former Patrick School teammate and current Pirates forward Angel Delgado, last season's Big East Rookie of the Year, as well as with former Trenton Catholic guard Myles Powell who recently committed to Seton Hall . \n“Seton Hall is like family to me,\" Aiken said. \"But I had to make the best decision for me. And that’s what I did at the end of the day.” \nAiken knows the challenges he faces at Harvard. He plans on majoring in business, and knows that the Ivy League course load will be trying. He also knows that he will have to continue to put on muscle and develop his game. \n“One thing I have to drastically improve on is being a pesty defender. Being someone of my size, that’s one thing that every college coach — every college coach — tells you that you have to improve upon. That’s a challenge I’m willing to take. \nPatrick School projects to be one of the best teams in New Jersey next season , and it would be no surprise to see the Celtics in the national rankings. Aiken has his eyes on the Tournament of Champions trophy while he's still in the Garden State. But once he gets to Massachusetts, he knows he has something else to prove. \n\"I want to play my hardest and prove myself, and that it doesn’t matter whether you’re in the Ivy League or the ACC or the Big East,\" Aiken said. \"I just want to make it known that you can make it regardless of where you play.” \nJeremy Schneider may be reached at jschneider@njadvancemedia.com .
