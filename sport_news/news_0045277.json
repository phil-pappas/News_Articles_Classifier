The Q&A will take place on October 29th, 2015 at 4pm at the New York Marathon Pavilion at 67th and Central Park West, and moderated by Toni Reavis, the award-winning broadcaster who will also be covering the Marathon for ESPN2. This event will kickoff a weeklong screening at the AMC Empire 25 Theater (234 West 42nd Street) from Oct 30th to Nov 5th. The film will also be premiering in Los Angeles on the same dates at Laemmle's Music Hall (9036 Wilshire Blvd. Beverly Hills, CA). City Slickers Can't Stay With Me features breathtaking footage of Meb training at altitude in Mammoth Lakes under the watchful eye of Coach Larsen and provides insights into Larsen’s methods for success in this most exhilarating and demanding sport.\nFraming City Slickers Can't Stay With Me is the career of Mebrahtom (Meb) Keflezighi , a worldclass distance runner with a unique American success story. Through Meb, City Slickers Can't Stay With Me, reminds us that great achievements are rarely made on one's own. Meb's narrative of success, however, is only half the story. His extraordinary personal and athletic achievements are all part of the legacy of Coach Bob Larsen . Coach Larsen’s life-long commitment to understanding the sport of distance running has been a key contributing factor in the resurgence of American distance running on the international stage. His protégé Meb Keflezighi, took the Olympic Silver Medal in 2004, finished first in New York in 2009 and won the Boston Marathon in 2014, the first American winner in 31 years. Larsen's ability to galvanize the emotional, intellectual, and physiological components of his runners has garnered unwavering respect from his athletes, former athletes, his peers, and has produced winning teams and star athletes from unlikely circumstances.\nThrough photos, interviews, and recent footage from the 2014 Boston Marathon, City Slickers Can't Stay With Me illustrates what has made Coach Bob Larsen such an influential figure in his field and led so many to attribute their success in other areas of life to lessons learned during their time with Coach Larsen.\nFor more information on the film visit http://www.boblarsenfilm.com or contact Rob Kirk, rob(at)thestorystudio(dot)com\nPhoto attached.\nAbout:\nFilmmaker Robert Lusitana, RJL, LLC Films, of Cardiff, California, ran for Coach Larsen at Grossmont College, UCLA, and later as a member of the Jamul Toads Running Club.
