The Bluejays have had at least a share of the last four conference titles. \nStange rushed for 200 yards and three long touchdowns as the Bluejays improved to 7-1 overall and in the Cloverwood, a game behind Abbotsford. \nTwo of his scores, 54- and 70-yard runs, came on consecutive carries in the first half. \nThe junior’s 42-yard score gave Athens a 28-7 lead in the third quarter. \n“All week we felt we could get a dive (play) on them, but I didn’t know we would get that big of a play,” Athens coach Mike Thurs said. “We didn’t expect to get big runs tonight. We thought we would maybe get five or six yards a carry. (Stange) is explosive and quick. When he gets in the open field, I don’t think there are a lot of people who can catch him.” Buy Photo \nOwen-Withee's quarterback Josiah Goerlitz(13) runs the ball while Athens' Max Stange(26) tackles during Friday night's Cloverwood Conference boys football matchup at Athens High School football field.

Owen-Withee was hampered by three turnovers in the game and 14 penalties, including one in the second quarter that wiped out a 48-yard touchdown run by quarterback Josiah Goerlitz. \nKevin Kitlica rushed for 120 yards to lead the Falcons, and Karaba added 76 yards on the ground. \n“Our defense did a nice job tonight, holding a good team like that to 19 points,” Thurs said. “We are pretty happy with that.” \nThe game wasn’t the only thing on the teams’ minds. \nThe Bluejays sported yellow socks for the game in support of Owen-Withee’s Will Maki.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T15:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T02:16:19.432+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
