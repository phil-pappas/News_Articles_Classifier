Here are a few storylines heading into the matchup. Welcome to Utah, 'College GameDay' \nPerhaps the biggest buzz around Salt Lake City is the fact the game isn't just on ESPN, but also the University of Utah will host ESPN's \"College GameDay.\" \n\"It is great for our program and university,\" Utah head coach Kyle Whittingham said. \nThis will be the Utes' third time hosting \"College GameDay.\" Previous experiences include 2010's matchup against then fourth-ranked TCU (Utah was ranked sixth), and the 2004 rivalry game against BYU. \nThe entertainment show is known for featuring fans with creative signs. Ute Nation's creativity has begun. Here is a look at the level of fandom we can expect to see.

The Utes and Bears are the only undefeated Pac-12 teams. Utah's 4-0 start is its best since opening the 2010 season with eight straight wins, while the Bears' 5-0 start is their best since 2007. \nBoth coaches believe their opponent is well-deserving of their perfect record. Whittingham said he thinks Bears quarterback Jared Goff is an \"exceptional\" player. As for their defense, he brought up their success at taking the ball away. \n\"They have generated 18 takeaways this year, which leads the Pac-12 and is among the national leaders,\" said Whittingham. \"We have our work cut out for us.\" \nFlip to the other side and you'll hear the same praise. Cal head coach Sonny Dykes pointed out how well all three of Utah's units have performed this season. \n\"Utah is a good football team and will be a big challenge for us. They're really good on offense, good on defense and exceptional on special teams. It's something we're excited about,\" he said. \nOf course, we know only one team can keep its win streak alive come Saturday. This isn't the first rodeo \nWho will win is anyone's guess. It's #Pac12AfterDark — anything can happen. For the sake of history, Cal leads the series 5-4, but Utah has won the last three of four games and holds a 2-1 advantage when playing at Rice-Eccles Stadium. Don't get too settled with the home-field advantage, though. Nine games this season have road teams as victors. \nIn hopes that the road team doesn't claim victory this weekend, the Utes look forward to a loud crowd at Rice-Eccles Stadium. \n\"I can't say enough good things about our crowd and the support they give us,\" said Whittingham. \"The atmosphere Saturday night should be electric. It should be one of the best crowds that we've had.\" \nThe last game between the two teams came Oct. 27, 2012. The second-year Pac-12 members defeated the Bears 49-27. Utah wide receiver Reggie Dunn became the first Ute in history and 16th in NCAA history to return two kickoffs for a touchdown in a single game. Quarterback Travis Wilson was a true freshman and earned his first win as a starter, passing for 156 yards and rushing for a touchdown. \nThis Top 25 matchup is sold out — Utah's 34th-consecutive home sellout dating back to the 2010 season opener. It will be televised at on ESPN at 8 p.m. MT with Dave Pasch, Brian Griese and Tom Luginbill calling the game. 0 Pending", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T23:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T03:13:14.988+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
