Dickson's big moment became a big embarrassment with less than two minutes to go in his game for Texas against Oklahoma state.\nAs Oklahoma tied the game, Texas, at fourth and one, were forced to punt.\nThe snap from Dickson's teammate was good. Dickson's hands, not too much.\nAdvertisement The Aussie fumbled the cleanest of passes, watching the ball tumble past his head, before running to recover it, only to then kick it out on the full behind the line of scrimmage.\nTexas lost six yards as a result, allowing Oklahoma to kick for a 40-yard field goal with just six seconds on the clock, and thus steal the game 30-27.\nUnfortunately, it was Texas' second loss in three games due to mistakes from special teams. The Longhorns were down seven points against Cal before scoring a 45-yard touchdown.\nThen came the error.\nThe kick for the extra point, which would have tied the game, was so far right it never looked like scoring. With just over a minute left on the clock, Texas lost that game by a point.", "external_links": ["https://vine.co/v/exdzJiFM0H2/embed/simple", "https://platform.vine.co/static/scripts/embed.js"], "published": "2015-09-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T20:39:55.151+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
