In reality it's the \" Fall Experimental Football League ,\" an attempt at a feeder system for the NFL that is so financially strapped they had to cancel their championship game last year in what was their inaugural season.\nAdChoices Now, in their second year, they've contracted from four teams to three, and their entire season schedule has a total of six games to be played in a pair of New York Minor League Baseball stadiums.\nEnter: Josh Freeman , the No. 17 overall pick in the 2009 Draft , who previously started 59 games for the Buccaneers and one other one for the Vikings . In 2010, he led the Bucs to a 10-6 record with a QB rating of 95.9 (good for sixth in the league). In 2012, he finished in the top 10 in the NFL in both passing yards (4,065) and touchdowns (27).\nIn 2015, he finds himself in the dreary hellhole that is the FXFL.\nOn Friday night Freeman had a wretched debut for some team called the Brooklyn Bolts . Against some other team called the Florida Blacktips , a squad with no set roster or home stadium, and only two players with experience in the NFL, Freeman went 9-of-16 through the air for 32 yards, a touchdown(!), a pick, and five fumbles. Afterward he declined to talk to reporters who were there for some reason.\nIt's a far fall for a guy who looked to have so much potential, and is still only 27-years-old. But hey, if they ever make a movie about this someday (which they won't) Friday's game would be the scene before the epic training montage that got his career back on track.\n[via The New York Times ]\nSend all complaints, compliments, and tips to sportstips@complex.com\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fall_Experimental_Football_League", "http://www.complex.com/sports/", "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/04/sports/football/humble-outpost-for-a-former-first-round-pick.html?smid=tw-nytsports&smtyp=cur&_r=2", "http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/F/FreeJo00.htm", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T11:41:19.866+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
