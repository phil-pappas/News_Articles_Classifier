Only the first five teams earned that distinction. Dewey came in sixth. \nRounding out Dewey’s regional boys participants were Johnathan Hailey (35th, 21:13.28), Hunter Hines (40th, 21:36.34); Jason Shambles (43rd, 21:50.75); Drew Miller (48th, 22:17.12); Trevor Williams (51st, 22:34.21) and Alan Godfrey (53rd, 22:57.12). \nThe Dewey girls squad — which head coach Lance Knight was bolstered by the late addition of some athletes — clawed to seventh place — just two spots shy of qualifying for state. The girls ran a two-mile distance. \nThe Dewey girls varsity team included Knight (28th, 14:52.31); Janie Adams (43rd, 15:37.62); Makenna Carver (46th, 15:40.15); Kelsie Davis (50th, 16:02.56); Hailey Hamrick (51st, 16:03.46); and Morgan Richardson (60th, 16:38.03).
