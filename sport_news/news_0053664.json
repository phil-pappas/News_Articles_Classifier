Yet somehow, the Falcons won.\nThat's about the shortest possible synopsis of how things have changed for that team under new head coach Dan Quinn this season. Until a clutch touchdown drive late in the game orchestrated mostly by QB Matt Ryan , the Falcons could not solve the Washington pass defense. Ryan found himself flustered often by collapsing pockets and made poor decisions or throws when he did have time.\nThe defense and run game kept Atlanta in it, though, against a Washington team that could not pull away. Cornerback Robert Alford then stole a victory for the now 5–0 Falcons by picking off an errant Kirk Cousins pass in overtime and taking it back for six.\nThere is room to scoff at the Atlanta schedule thus far (four games with the downtrodden NFC East and a home game against Houston). But pinning the Falcons' undefeated start all on those matchups would be an error. This is a team learning anew how to win games, and doing it in a hurry.\nTo wit: the touchdown drive Ryan put together late in the fourth quarter, with his team facing a 16–12 deficit. Ryan was sitting on 188 yards passing and two interceptions prior to that possession, then ripped off 66 yards through the air (and another eight on a scramble) to set up a Devonta Freeman touchdown.\nNFL Watch: Devonta Freeman touchdown overturned in Atlanta by SI Wire", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/ChrisBurke_SI", "http://nfl.cpl.delvenetworks.com/player/carousel/si.html?mediaId=3b5ad862092643b6ac94f8c2f2fec4ab"], "published": "2015-10-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T03:22:54.478+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
