Nonetheless, he’s still trying to get his foot in the major college football door.

Production certainly isn’t the reason he’s still waiting for one of them to extend a scholarship offer. \nNeither is Cook’s work in the classroom or community. He’s a 3.64 student. He’s the type who shows up for community service projects without being asked. He delivered the keynote speech a couple weeks ago in Fort Dodge at a National Youth Leadership Council gathering, encouraging his peers to step away from their comfort zone, challenge themselves and become a role model. Prep football preview: Week 6 in CIML and central Iowa \nAs much as Fort Dodge athletics will feel Cook’s absence next year when the four-year football starter, state wrestling champion, track and baseball participant goes off to college, Dodger football coach Matt Miller said his void will be felt “in our community and in our school as a leader.” \n“I like to put myself out there,” Cook said. “I like to motivate other people to do their best.” \nCook is playing better than ever this season, leading Class 4A with 894 yards rushing and 17 total touchdowns despite playing just two possessions after halftime for the 5-0 Dodgers. Nonetheless, he’s still trying to get his foot in the major college football door. <!--iframe--> \nIowa, Iowa State, Missouri, Purdue, Northern Illinois and Northern Iowa have expressed varying levels of interest, but his wait for a scholarship and the mystery that surrounds it continues. \nWhat’s holding college coaches back? \n“I’m kind of wondering the same thing,” Cook said. “They tell me I’m doing everything right. I suppose there’s always room for improvement. But I’m busting my butt. I perform my hardest on Friday nights and I’m the best person I can be off the field, I get stuff done in the classroom and I try my hardest. Hopefully something comes around.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T00:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T05:30:24.096+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
