Last-place UH fell to 0-4 in Big West Conference play and 3-10-1 overall.\nWith the loss, the Rainbow Wahine's chances of qualifying for the Big West tournament (a top-four finish is required) are slim with four games to play.\nUH trailed just 1-0 at halftime after a goal by Rebecca Wilson, but Wilson would score twice more in the second half to complete the hat trick and Ivy Diego scored on an assist by Wilson.\nThe Rainbow Wahine have been outscored 16-3 in four Big West Games. They were outshot 26-10 today.\nThe Rainbow Wahine return home for a single-game week, against CSUN next Sunday.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T00:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T20:59:48.257+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
