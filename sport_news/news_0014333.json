In two of the Broncos’ six wins this season, the offense didn’t score a single touchdown. \nMany critics are jumping on Peyton Manning. Hillman is tired of it, based on a tweet, saying he shakes his head at fans harping on the quarterback, who threw three interceptions Sunday. Ya need to get off Peyton that's our QB bottom line .You fake fans don't say anything when he is winning us the game smh — Ronnie Hillman (@MrHillman2U) October 18, 2015 \n\"We're not playing as well as we would like but we're playing well enough to win,\" Manning said after the game. It’s the defense credited with giving the Broncos a perfect season, so far. \nSunday’s victory has 7NEWS Sports Director Lionel Bienvenu wondering: \n“Has 6-0 ever felt so bad? Winning is all that matters, but they won’t win versus Green Bay, New England or Cincinnatti with this offense the way it is.” has 6-0 ever felt so bad? winning is all that matters, but they won't win vs GB, NE, CIN with this offense the way it is.. #DENvsCLE — Lionel Bienvenu (@lionelbienvenu) October 18, 2015 \nHillman’s opinion is in line with Coach Gary Kubiak’s post-game feelings. \n“I think he’s trying to do too much at times. He’s also doing everything for us, at times, to win football games. We got to find the medium there. Me doing a better job, him protecting the ball better. We’re all in this together and that’s the way we’ll stay.” \nSound off on the game and on the plays! Join Lionel Bienvenu & Arran Andersen on the ‪#‎OrangeBlueReview‬ Mondays at noon!
