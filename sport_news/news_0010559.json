He briefly lost feeling in the left side of his body and was driven off the field by an ambulance and taken to the hospital. \nWilliams has been a five-year starter in Buffalo since being selected in the second round of the 2011 draft. He's a hard-hitting player who successfully made the switch from cornerback to safety in 2013. \nBuffalo (3-2), which hosts Cincinnati (5-0) on Sunday, filled the open roster spot by signing safety Josh Bush . \nBush played three games with Denver before being released by the Broncos on Oct. 1. He was selected by the Jets in the sixth round of the 2011 draft and played 35 games in two-plus seasons in New York. \nHe is reunited with former Jets coach Rex Ryan, who is now coaching the Bills. \nAP NFL website: http://www.pro32.ap.org and http://www.twitter.com/AP_NFL Tennessee Titans running back Bishop Sankey (20) is tackled by Buffalo Bills strong safety Aaron Williams (23) in the first half of an NFL football game Sunday, Oct. 11, 2015, in Nashville, Tenn.
