It might be a little bit dangerous but the more we use it ... the more we will get used to it. \n\"It's going to take some getting used to at this stage. We're adapting on the batting and bowling fronts, it's just the fielding.\" \nAustralia will host New Zealand in the first day-night test in Adelaide from Nov. 27 after years of research and work on the pink ball. \nSome purists have reservations about the experiment, and Hazlewood's team mate and fellow paceman Mitchell Starc also complained that it was sometimes hard to see and very different to the red one. \nHazlewood feared crowds might also have trouble seeing the ball at twilight. \n\"If they can't see it, they'll ask themselves what they're doing there watching,\" Hazlewood said. \"It will be interesting to see how it goes. \n\"I see a lot of similarities with the white ball at the moment, the way it behaves at the start of the innings and after 40-50 overs. \n\"It's going to be hard to buff up and get that nice red shine like you would a normal red leather cricket ball, but it's improved the last couple of years. Whether it's ready for test matches we'll find out.\" \nPlayers will get their hands on the pink ball later on Friday in a day-night tour match in Canberra between the hosts' Prime Minister's XI and the touring New Zealand side.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T05:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T07:05:05.230+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
