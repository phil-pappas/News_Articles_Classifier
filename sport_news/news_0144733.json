But the problem is, some of these alleged offenses happened up to 20 years ago.\n\"I think this is kinda, this is not right,\" said Brandon Friedman, who got one of the letters.\n1.2 million people have received letters from the Louisiana Department of Public Safety and Corrections within the past week. And now, people are upset they are facing these fines for something they say they never did.\n\"They're telling me that they're fining me $525 and if I don't pay it, they're going to go to a collection agency and try to ruin my credit,\" said Friedman.\nBrandon Friedman said in a phone interview that he is from Louisiana, but now lives in Virginia. He posted a letter he got onto his Twitter page from Louisiana's Office of Motor Vehicles all because there was a period in time in 2004, where his car was not insured, according to the letter.\n\"In 2004, I re-registered my car in Texas, it was insured in Texas and everything, and then apparently, according to this letter I just got, this says that Louisiana mailed me a letter in August of 2004, a couple months after I moved away, saying I didn't do whatever I was supposed to do with canceling the insurance or whatever. So this is 11 years ago,\" said Friedman.\nHe is not the only one. According to Colonel Mike Edmonson with the Louisiana State Police, 1.2 million letters went out, and 25,000 of those came back undeliverable.\nAccording to The Advocate newspaper in Baton Rouge, the state spent at least half a million dollars to send the letters, hoping to cash in on $444 million in outstanding debts.\n\"This was all generated and started with the Department of Revenue and the Treasury who were going around to all the different state agencies, 'what debt do you have?' Well, this is debt that is owed to the Department of Public Safety through the Office of Motor Vehicles. These are people that have not paid their insurance or let it lapse,\" said Edmonson.\nThat is the problem. A lot of these debts, like Friedman's, are from years ago. We showed a copy of the letter to Joel Pearce, an attorney. When he saw the letter, he said, \"Wow. That's kind of outrageous isn't it?\"\nThe letter says if you do not pay the amount you owe within 60 days, you will face a steep increase plus a collection fee of 25 percent.\n\"The consumer is between a rock and a hard place, they may be asking for a couple hundred bucks, and they know that you're not going to go out and spend money on a lawyer in order to get out of paying a couple hundred bucks. You're just going to pay it,\" said Pearce.\nColonel Edmonson said the Office of Motor Vehicle offices will stay open until 8:00 p.m. to help people understand the letters. He also says the state is working to possibly erase small debts that date back to before 2006.\nCopyright 2015 KSLA .
