The Tigers begin a stretch of six straight American Athletic Conference games to end the regular season against Tulsa, which is sixth in the country in total offense with an average of 550.5 yards per game. \nKEY MATCHUP \nMemphis’ secondary vs. Tulsa QB Dane Evans. Tulsa is second in the AAC in passing offense with an average of 354.4 yards through the air per game, with Evans leading the way. The junior is fourth in school history with 6,127 passing yards, and he’s thrown for 11 touchdowns and four interceptions this season. The Tigers have struggled to stop the pass this season, allowing 329 yards passing per game, and they’ll need top performances out of defensive backs Reggis Ball and Arthur Maulet - who lead Memphis with two interceptions each. \nPLAYERS TO WATCH \nMemphis: QB Paxton Lynch. The junior was solid last season, throwing 22 touchdowns and nine interceptions, but he’s been nothing short of spectacular this year. Lynch is sixth nationally in passing efficiency, and he’s thrown 13 touchdowns and only one interception while guiding an offense that’s averaging 46 points per game. \nTulsa: WR Keyarris Garrett. The 6-foot-4, 221-pound senior is ninth in the county with an average of 116.3 yards receiving per game, including a 14-catch, 189-yard effort in a 52-38 loss at No. 17 Oklahoma on Sept. 19. \nFACTS & FIGURES \nMemphis’ 13-game winning streak is the longest in school history, and it’s the third longest in the country … The Tigers last loss came against Houston on Oct. 11, 2014 … First-year Tulsa coach Philip Montgomery was formerly the offensive coordinator at Baylor, where he worked with Heisman Trophy winner Robert Griffin III and Bryce Petty, among others. \nCopyright © 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T18:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T20:03:29.398+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
