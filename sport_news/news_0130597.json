You can't be disappointed with 13 blocks, as well coming through with one of our better hitting performances of the season offensively,\" head coach Sam Atoa said. \"Bakersfield is well coached and comes in and battles us hard every year. I felt like our girls managed to stay composed, however, and do what they needed to do to get the win.\" \nCSUB (3-11, 1-1 WAC), which won the WAC Tournament title last year, took the upper hand in the early stages of the opening set as it jumped out to a quick 10-5 advantage.

The 'Runners answered right back, however, with a run of their own to tie the frame up at 13-13. With the set later still deadlocked at 21-all, Bakersfield managed to reel off four unanswered points to take the frame by a score of 25-21. \nThe Wolverines were once again the first to take an early advantage in the fourth frame as they took another 11-8 lead following a kill from sophomore Madison Dennison . CSUB countered back by scoring four of the next five points to tie the score at 12-12, but UVU later pieced together a 5-1 run of its own to pull ahead for good at 22-17.
