Here's a roundup of some of the most sharable content in sports today. Texas governor tweets too soon \nMonday afternoon, the Houston Astros had a 6-2 lead in the ALDS over the Kansas City Royals in the 8th inning. It seemed pretty safe, so Texas Governor Greg Abbott tweeted a congratulations. Here's the screen cap of the Tweet deleted by TX Gov. Abbott pic.twitter.com/wYYh6WNcrO — Cliff Saunders (@cliffsaunders) October 12, 2015 \nExcept that the Astros self-imploded over the next two innings, eventually losing 9-6. Apparently Abbott hasn't been watching sports for long, or else he'd know too well: \"It ain't over 'til it's over.\" Evil, evil golfing buddy \nWe know nothing about this next video, except for what we've learned in the title. Apparently, this golfer's friend was going for his first eagle in golf, when, well... \nThis is evil. I don't think the putt was going down in the end, but man. This is mean enough to surpass \"prank\" status. \nBut it's also stupidly funny. Frank Kaminsky dance moves \nFrank Kaminsky, the 9th pick of the 2015 NBA draft and former college Player of the Year, was in China this week with his new team, the Charlotte Hornets. \nFor some reason, this meant it was an opportunity to dance. A video posted by NBA (@nba) on Oct 13, 2015 at 6:48am PDT \nKaminsky's actually got some pretty good moves! The editorial board here at From Left Field gives him an 8 out of 10.
