Image 12 of 12 Lamar falls 30-27 to SLU 1 / 12 Back to Gallery \nA late fourth-down touchdown run broke Lamar football's hearts Thursday in Hammond. \nSoutheastern Louisiana senior running back Kody Sutton 's one-yard score with 1:19 remaining doomed the Cardinals (2-2, 1-1 Southland), who fell 30-27 to No. 22 Southeastern Louisiana 30-27 Strawberry Stadium. \nThe Lions (3-1, 2-0) struck first through a 67-yard pass from junior quarterback D'Shaie Landor to senior receiver Jeff Smiley . \nLandor extended the Lions' lead to 13-0 with 1:14 remaining in the first quarter on a five-yard touchdown run, finishing off a 95-yard drive. \nThe Cardinals' fortune got worse when junior Carson Earp threw an interception on fourth down on the next drive, which Southeastern Louisiana returned to the Lamar 21-yard line. \nLions freshman kicker Jonathan Tatum , who missed an extra point on the Lions' second touchdown, missed a 31-yard field goal on the ensuing drive. \nLamar's offense, which managed just 92 yards in the first quarter, came to life after the field goal miss. \nCardinals senior receiver Reggie Begelton caught a 26-yard touchdown from Earp on the next drive, which was set up by a 32-yard pass from Earp to senior receiver Devonn Brown on third down. \nThe Cardinals took a 14-13 lead two drives later. \nHarrington broke free for a 55-yard run on the first play then rushed for a three-yard touchdown two plays later. \nThe teams traded field goals early in the third quarter and Cardinals freshman Rodney Randle made the Lions pay for settling for a field goal. \nRandle returned the ensuing kickoff 87 yards for a touchdown, streaking through a pair of Lions' defenders on his way to the end zone and a 24-16 lead. \nThe Lions countered on their next drive with a five-yard touchdown run by Landor, his second of the game to make it 24-23. \nSutton's game-winning touchdown drive was a 17-play, 79-yard drive that spanned 6:36.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T05:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T06:21:36.380+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
