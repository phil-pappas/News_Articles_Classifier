They started 0-4-0 in 2001-02 but lost Game 4 in overtime.\nRookie head coach John Hynes must have known it might be an early struggle for the rebuilding Devils, but could he have guessed that they'd be chasing their first win?\n\"It really never came into thought of whether we were going to chase it or not because the focus is always to try to get us to play well together as a team and understand the process of winning and things like that,\" Hynes insisted. \"It's more: How are we going to get ourselves to be able to play a 60-minute game and get on the board? That's really been the mindset more than whether we'd be chasing the win or not.\"\nRELATED: Devils lose third straight to start season\nOne of his tasks may be keeping morale up.\n\"You want to win. So definitely you are frustrated with that,\" veteran winger Jiri Tlusty said. \"That's three games already in the season and we haven't won. That's the frustration there, but we have to move forward.\"\nAdam Henrique said the Devils aren't down.\n\"No. We just have to be better,\" Henrique said. \"We're going to stick with it, stick together and find a way to get that first one.\"\nHynes echoed his thoughts.\n\"It's not really frustrating,\" the coach maintained. \"We're just in a challenge right now where we have to continue to find a way to win a game. That's the process we're in. So it's more of a challenge than it is a frustration.\n\"It's part of the process we're in and there are things we have to learn from the game and continue to grow. Negativity is not going to solve anything. We have to continue to dig in here, continue to get better and find a way to win some games.\"\nGoalie Keith Kinkaid said: \"We have to learn to win. Like the coach says, we have to learn to win and then to win consistently. It takes a little while but I think once we get it going and string a couple in a row, we'll be a dangerous team.\"\nDeBoer has endured his share of frustration in Prudential Center. Maybe the Devils can win their first game at their former coach's expense.\nRich Chere may be reached at rchere@njadvancemedia.com . Follow him on Twitter @Ledger_NJDevils .
