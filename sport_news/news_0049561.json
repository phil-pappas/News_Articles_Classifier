Pic/AFP \nPakistan's Test skipper held the innings together with an unbeaten 102 for his ninth century and, with him, Asad Shafiq was 46 not out after Pakistan won the toss and opted to bat on a brownish-green pitch which is expected to turn as the game progresses.\nMisbah added 93 with Younis Khan (56) and another 104 for the unbroken fifth wicket stand with Shafiq as Pakistan aim for a big score to force a lead in the three-match series. The first Test ended in a draw in Abu Dhabi last week.\nAttacking mode \nMisbah, who hinted at retirement from international cricket after this series, hit two sixes in spinner Moeen Ali's final over of the day and then reverse-swept for two to complete his hundred off 190 balls. In all he has hit eight fours and five sixes during his 192-ball innings.\nShafiq, who survived a run-out when on 12 and a reviewed lbw appeal on 31, shaped up well during his 93-ball knock, hitting six fours.\nBrief scores\nPakistan 282-4 in 90 overs (M Haq 102*, Y Khan 56, S Masood 54; J Anderson 1-33, M Wood 1-26) vs England", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T06:59:56.044+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
