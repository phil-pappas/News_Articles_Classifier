That number is arbitrary and based on the number of available slots. A team with six or more wins is an automatic qualifier. Pontiac is just two wins away from being an automatic qualifier after a 33-23 win over Eureka last week. One of those wins could come Friday night as the Indians travel to Olympia to meet the 1-5 Spartans. Getting that win will not be easy, especially if last week’s Homecoming triumph is any indicator of what it could be like to get trapped. Pundits like to call games like last week and this “trap games” because one team is expected to walk over the weaker opponent only to underestimate the foe and get beat. Eureka controlled the line scrimmage and time of possession through the first half last week but Pontiac was able to hold a 13-9 halftime lead. Superior athleticism was the key, as well as better execution in the second half, but the Hornets still made the Tribe work for the win. PTHS head coach Buck Casson expects the same thing week — Olympia making Pontiac work hard to get the win. Casson does not see this as a walk over contest. The reason Casson is not taking the Spartans lightly is because of the way they have played the past three weeks. Olympia has been competitive in losses to Central Catholic, Eureka and U-High. “It’s a dangerous game because I believe they are a dangerous team,” Casson said. “I believe they have gotten better each week, they have picked it up.” Casson expects nothing less against his Indians. Control of the line scrimmage was Pontiac’s first-half problem last week. Olympia comes in experienced up front with decent size. From a defensive standpoint, the Indians will be challenged in the trenches. Good line play will be key for Olympia if quarterback Collin Miller is effective. He threw two touchdown passes last week against U-High. He collected 191 yards through the air and rushed for 50 more. Justin Slager and Levi Nieson were the top receivers. “Their quarterback is a stud (and) most of these guys are returning starters,” Casson said. “We did a decent job for the majority of the game but in the end of the game we did about everything we could to lose it.” Olympia topped PTHS 18-14 at Williamson Field last year after a late drive. Pontiac has been beaten up front the past two weeks but managed to pull off one win and threaten Central Catholic in the other game. Page 2 of 2 - The Indians need to get back to solid line play in order to get the run game going again. Levi Ransom has rushed for 697 yards through six games, but only 108 the last two weeks. Vaughn Hobart has gained 598 yards on the season, with 107 coming in the past two weeks. “There were several situations where our offense wasn’t clicking,” Casson said of last week’s game. “It seemed we were either all on or all off. We have to be all on for us to be a playoff-competitive team. We aren’t in that realm yet. “We’ve got to adjust. We’ve got to throw some wrinkles and make adjustments,” Casson added. “Everyone can see who our main guys are, but we have several other guys who can make huge plays.” If there is one thing Pontiac has shown over the past two weeks was the desire to keep fighting. The Indians were beaten up front at Bloomington but did score three times against the Saints. PTHS was able to strike when it had to last week as illustrated by a score on an untimed play that closed out the first half. But Casson is looking for more this week. “We’ve got to start strong and have a complete four-quarter competition,” Casson said. “It’s not that we’ve played bad, it’s that I know we can do a lot better.” From the numbers’ standpoint, Pontiac has given up the second-most points among league teams with 193. Eureka has scored the least against the Indians with 23 last week. Olympia has scored 101 points, but 40 came in its Week 1 win over St. Thomas More. Since then, the Spartans have tallied more than two scores just once, in their 24-21 loss to Eureka two weeks ago. Olympia has given up 180 points, but just 74 in the past three weeks against Central Catholic, Eureka and U-High. The Tribe has scored 182 points. The low mark was in Week 1 against Metamora. Only the 38-21 loss to BCC saw the Tribe score less than 33 since.
