Her 494 shot attempts were 138 more than the team’s next highest total. \n“Last year, I did a lot of driving to the hole, or I’d shoot it,” Goff said. “Lately, I’ve been working on trying to dribble down the floor and pull up. Since I’m a little bit fast, hopefully I can slow it down and get into the rhythm of my shooting.” \nAt 5-foot-8 and with a slight build, Goff was somewhat undersized in her 2014-15 role. \nAs a point guard, Goff should be able to use her athleticism to generate opportunities in UTRGV’s four-out, one-in offense. \n“With that experience and that speed, I think a lot of good things could happen,” Tidwell said. \nFor more on this story, visit MyBrownsvilleHerald.com .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T06:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T10:43:11.567+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
