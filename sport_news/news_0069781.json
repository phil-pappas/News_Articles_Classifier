Nikola Radanovich, 18, and a 15-year-old Mount Prospect girl remained hospitalized Monday in the intensive care unit of Advocate Lutheran General Hospital in Park Ridge recovering from extensive injuries, Prospect Heights Deputy Police Chief Al Steffen said. Both are expected to survive. The cause of the one-car crash remains under investigation, but police believe alcohol may have been a factor, Steffen said. No charges have been filed at this time, he added. Police say Radanovich was driving a 2005 Volvo eastbound on Willow Road at about 12:38 a.m. Saturday when he lost control of the vehicle and it crashed at Circle Drive. The vehicle was traveling about 70 mph in the 35 mph speed zone moments earlier when it passed a Prospect Heights police car heading westbound on Willow, Steffen said. \"Before the officer even had a chance to turn around, he saw the (Volvo's) taillights go askew and then the vehicle disappeared,\" he said. Members of the Prospect Heights Fire Protection District had to use Jaws of Life to remove Radanovich and the 15-year-old girl from the badly damaged vehicle, police said.
