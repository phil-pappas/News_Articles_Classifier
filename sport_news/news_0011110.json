He converted two third-down passes to keep the drive alive. \nPaul Harris rushed for 125 yards and two touchdowns for Hawaii (2-5, 0-3). \nNew Mexico safety Lee Crosby had two interceptions, including one with three seconds left, to squash the Rainbow Warriors' last-ditch drive. \nThe Lobos' Carlos Wiggins returned a kickoff from his end zone for a score, a school-record fifth time he's taken a kick back for a touchdown. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T06:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T06:17:20.361+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
