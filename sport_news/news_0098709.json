It’s been a decade since we’ve been able to say this so let’s relish in it: Saturday night is Hockey Night in San Diego! The Gulls returned to the ice at the Valley View Casino Center (formerly known as the Sports Arena) to play a hockey game for the first time since 2006. This time, they’re not part of an independent league. The Gulls are the top affiliate for the Anaheim Ducks playing in the American Hockey League. It’s a commitment to hockey in San Diego that was not taken lightly, and it’s expected to last a long, long time. Owners Henry and Susan Samueli could have been in San Jose to watch the Ducks open their NHL season against the Sharks. Instead they chose to see a hockey game in San Diego. “Opening night, sellout crowd, this is very significant. That’s why Susan and I chose to be here instead of San Jose,” said Henry with Susan nodding approvingly. “Tonight’s sellout shows the nation that San Diegans are passionate sports fans.” The old facility just off Interstate 8 has been dressed up with new ice, a new massive video board over the playing surface and new food options for fans. “This facility is in fantastic shape,” said Samueli. “Our players and organization are lucky to call the Valley View Casino Center home.” AHL Commissioner David Edwards is also attending the game. He was instrumental in trying to bring minor league hockey back to San Diego because he sees it helping the NHL. The Ducks used to have their top talent playing in Virginia, which was not exactly conducive to building a strong organization (please pronounce that “OR-GAN-EYE-ZAY-SHUN” to honor our Canadian friends). “For NHL teams it has become incredibly important to invest in their development system,” said Edwards. “To be able to monitor the progress of their players first-hand, that’s what’s driving this and it’s going to be tremendous for our league.” And the league should, in turn, be tremendous. This is where the top prospects come to learn. Last season 88% of the guys who skated on NHL ice had spent time in the AHL. There are still folks who don’t think minor league hockey is going to work this deep in Southern California. The hockey experts would like to respectfully disagree. “I don’t think there’s any question it’s going to work,” said Edwards. The American Hockey League now spans from San Diego to Newfoundland. As Edwards joked, if they meet in the Calder Cup Championship it’s going to be a very interesting season, indeed. The first puck drops on Saturday night at 7:05.
