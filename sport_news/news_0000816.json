New York prevailed on the first tiebreaker, goal differential. FCD also finished second for the shield in 2006 under Colin Clarke, a team current FCD coach Oscar Pareja was a first-year assistant on.\n\"In my eyes, they won it,\" Pareja said. \"They were the best team in the league in a conference that is very difficult. We did our work today. We won at home. We needed to win today to give ourselves a chance, and that's what we did.\"\nFCD got goals from Mauro Diaz and Victor Ulloa in the win, its 13th home victory this season, tying a franchise record set in 1999 as the Dallas Burn. San Jose took an early lead when Quincy Amarikwa scored his sixth goal of the season 13 minutes in.\nBut Dallas pulled the match level in the 38th when Diaz capitalized on San Jose's failure to clear a Fabian Castillo cross for his eighth goal of the season. Ulloa delivered the game-winner in the 79th, his second career goal, tucking a shot inside the near post to make it 2-1.\n\"I think the play started with Mauro [Diaz],\" Ulloa, a Wylie product, said. \"He launched a ball and Clarence Goodson, he didn't have a great first touch with the 50/50 ball. Once I saw Fabian [Castillo] get the ball, I was hoping he would give it to me. Instead, he got cut off when he got the ball. I was just fortunate to be in the right place at the right time.\"\nSan Jose played the final 23 minutes with 10 men after midfielder Matias Perez Garcia was issued a red card for a blow to the back of Diaz's head in the 67th minute. Referee Armando Villarreal did not witness the infraction as it happened, but after conferring with the fourth official, Villarreal sprinted to the opposite side of the field to eject Garcia, setting off a furious protest by the Quakes players.\nFCD, who will start the playoffs next Sunday on the road against an opponent to-be-determined, had an apparent goal by Michael Barrios in the 86th minute nullified because he was ruled offside.\n\"It was a strange game,\" Pareja said. \"In the second half, I thought we were the best team on the field. The score says it all. We could have scored a couple goals more. We are very pleased, very happy, very proud.\"\nBriefly: Ulloa led FCD with 2,915 minutes played. He and Ryan Hollingshead both led the team with 33 games played. ... GK Jesse Gonzalez started his 11th consecutive game in goal. ... FCD last won a regular-season finale on Oct. 25, 2003, defeating Colorado 4-3 at Southlake's Dragon Stadium as the Dallas Burn. Pareja was a player on that team. ... FCD allowed 39 goals this season, tying it with the 2011 team for third-fewest in a season. ... Dallas finished with a plus-13 goal differential, third-best in club history.\nBy Stephen Hunt, special contributor.\nOn Twitter:\n @SportsDayDFW", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/SportsDayDFW"], "published": "2015-10-26T04:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T18:20:11.514+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
