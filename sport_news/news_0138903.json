Near the end of a lengthy speech, Yellen, 69, paused for several seconds and stumbled over some words.\nThe Fed blamed the incident on Yellen feeling dehydrated at the end of a 52-minutes speech under bright lights. The Fed said Yellen felt fine after being checked by emergency medical personnel at the speech site and resumed her schedule.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T07:30:44.026+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
