After the Tigers opened the game with an 11-play, 80-yard drive that ended with a two-yard touchdown run by sophomore quarterback Ethan Brown, the Falcons scored 22 unanswered points on three Alex Huston touchdown passes. \"We obviously didn't have ourselves prepared the way we needed to be,\" Waynesville coach Brad Drehle said. \"Lots of little things and those are lessons we'll have to learn as we grow up as a program.\" The run ended with a Brown strike to Cedric Williams from seven yards out with 6:53 remaining in the half. Waynesville scored again, following an interception by senior David Hawk, on a two-yard carry by sophomore David Adams a little over two minutes later to cut Glendale's lead to 22-20 (the Tigers failed on a two-point conversion attempt). However, the Falcons went on another run, spanning 24 points this time, ending with 15.7 seconds left on the second-quarter clock on a 17-yard touchdown catch by senior wide receiver Zach Helm. The Tigers' defense came out in the third quarter much improved though, keeping Glendale out of the end zone. \"Their coaches made some outstanding adjustments,\" Mauk said. \"Their kids never gave up and played right to the last play.\" Waynesville began their comeback with a six-yard touchdown run by senior Seth Hedrick out of the backfield four minutes into the second half. Hedrick scored again for the Tigers with 11:48 left in the game on another run out of the backfield. On a fourth-and-eight Hedrick took the snap and sprinted 51 yards, outrunning the Falcons' defense. Glendale's next drive went backwards 12 yards and the Falcons were forced to punt from their own 12, but sophomore defensive lineman Eddy Yoon blocked the punt and it was recovered at the 16. Hawk ended up plodding in from two yards out and also ran in the two-point conversion to put the Tigers within two points of Glendale's lead. The secret to Waynesville's resurgence, Drehle said, was accomplishing the game plan he had set out for his team to begin with. \"We did what we wanted to do in the first part of the game which is come downhill and run right at them,\" Drehle said. \"We played fast and we played physical and they made a couple of mistakes that helped us get back into the game and gain some momentum.\" But junior Luke Montgomery returned the ensuing kickoff nearly 80 yards to the Tigers' five-yard line and Huston finished it off a couple plays later with a four-yard run. His two-point conversion pass fell incomplete to make it a 52-44 game. Then it was time for some more Hedrick heroics. Page 2 of 2 - After a failed onside kick by Glendale, Brown lofted up a 30-yard pass to Hedrick, who came down with the jump-ball and ran another 20 yards for a touchdown. Waynesville failed their two-point conversion, leaving them behind by two points. On the Falcons' next drive, junior Raishon Pickett made his second interception of the game to give his team the ball at Glendale's 49. Adams scored on a run from 13 yards out to give his team its first lead since the first quarter. Again, Waynesville failed its two-point conversion, so the Tigers led 56-52 with 5:17 remaining. But Glendale nosed back out in front as the Falcons drove 75 yards on their next offensive possession with Huston hooking up with junior Von Oeser for the third time in the end zone on an eight-yard connection. Waynesville started its next drive from its own 44. Brown started off by hitting Adams for a seven-yard gain. Then he found Williams for 11 yards, but the Falcons swarmed Williams and stripped the ball away as he was falling to the ground at the Glendale 48 with 2:10 left in the game. Glendale was able to run out the clock on its next drive. \"We've done so many things well this fall and then, like you saw tonight, we'd just kind of let the bottom fall out,\" Mauk said. \"To be able to come back and win a game like that was a good thing for us and, hopefully, something we can build upon.\" Huston finished the game 41-70 passing for 475 yards and five touchdowns to three interceptions. As the only Falcon with any rushing attempts, he ran 16 times for 101 yards. Brown was 19-28 with 247 yards and two touchdowns and was picked off once. Hedrick finished with 127 yards rushing on seven rushes and 56 yards receiving on two catches. Adams had 51 yards on 11 carries and Hawk 49 on 14. It'll be senior night for the Tigers next week as the unbeaten Kickapoo Chiefs (8-0) come to town fresh off a 49-21 victory over Lebanon (5-3). Drehle said it'd be easy for his team to hang its head after a loss like Friday's, but he says they must understand there's still plenty of football left to play if they fight for it. \"All of the things we want to accomplish can still be accomplished,\" Drehle said. \"We would've liked to have this one, obviously, as a win, but the district tournament, once we get there, everybody goes back to zero.\" By Derek Dueker   Derek Dueker Posted Oct. 9, 2015 at 12:01 AM Updated at 11:02 PM", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T07:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T16:44:26.076+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
