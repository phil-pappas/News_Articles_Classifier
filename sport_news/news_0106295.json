Suddenly everywhere.\nWhen did the soft cheese show up? How does everyone seem to know it? You squint, remembering cheeses past. There's brie in the distance. And chevre, in that '90s getup. You flip through Polaroids of tender taleggios and gritty manchegos. There's a snapshot of fresh mozzarella loping toward the kitchen. It's the hardworking sort that hustles lasagna onto the table, not the elegant type that frequents tastings.\nBut there — in that faded black-and-white. Doesn't that look like mozzarella, yet different, more glam? It's even got a topknot. That's burrata — fresh mozzarella outside, creamy curds inside. The cheese-making technique dates back nearly a century; the pale cheese it produces only lasts a day.\nBurrata, Italian for buttered. Right! Now you remember you were introduced before, that time, at that thing. You didn't catch the name then, but you'll make a point of remembering: burrata, the (sorta) new cheese in town.\nleahreskin@aol.com\nCrave more Leah?\nFind all your favorite stories and recipes in Leah Eskin's memoir, \"Slices of Life: A Food Writer Cooks Through Many a Conundrum.\" Available wherever books are sold.\nBurrata bites\nPrep: 15 minutes\nCook: 15 minutes\nMakes: 12 appetizers\n1 ripe pear\n2 tablespoons unsalted butter\n1 coin fresh ginger, 1 1/4 inches thick\n1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper\nOlive oil\n1 clove garlic, whole but bruised\nKosher salt\n12 slices baguette, each 1/2 inch thick\nOrange marmalade\n1 ball (4 ounces) burrata\n6 thin slices prosciutto\nPrivacy Policy Leah Eskin", "external_links": ["http://www.tribpub.com/privacy-policy-and-your-privacy-rights/", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-5625758d/turbine/sc-eskin-burrata-crostini-food-1023-20151019"], "published": "2015-10-20T01:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T02:27:46.518+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
