(For OzarksSportsZone.com) -- The Lamar Tigers literally ran away from the Aurora Houn' Dawgs on Aurora's Senior Night, blasting the Houn's 41-0. The 4-time defending Class 2 champions ran the double-wing offense to perfection, confusing the Aurora defense in the process. Lamar rushed for over 400 yards rushing, including two Tigers finishing over 100 yards, in a game that employed the running clock mid-way through the third quarter. Aurora, on the other hand, never got their offense moving, finishing the night with 150 total yards and only 45 of those on the ground.

Three minutes later senior Danny Embry scored the first of his four touchdowns, this one a 68-yard scamper down the right sideline untouched. Embry scored Lamar's next two touchdowns, as well, from 12 yards and 25 yards, respectively, to put the Tigers in front 28-0 at the halftime break.\"Aurora did some things well against us in the first half,\" said Lamar defensive coordinator Thad Lundine. \"They have some talent and we've played those same guys for years.\" Sophomore quarterback Stuart McKarus, who rushed for 121 yards on 15 carries, scored Lamar's first touchdown of the second half, a 2-yard run, to put the Tigers up 34-0. Embry added his fourth score at the 4:06 mark of the third quarter, a 41-yard scamper, to put the mercy clock into play the rest of the way.\"We will get ourselves ready for next week at East Newton,\" said Kilgo. \"Then we will get another shot at home, so our seniors will get another shot on their field.\" Aurora is current'y in second place in their district standings and will host a first-round contest in week 10. Lamar's Embry led the way for Lamar with 177 yards rushing and four touchdowns, while McKanus added 121 yards and one score. Wilkerson finished with 55 yards rushing and one touchdown. Aurora's Payton Evans completed 10 of 18 passes for 105 yards. Lamar improved to 8-0 on the season and will match up with Carl Junction next Friday with a Big 8 title on the line, while Aurora drops to 4-4 on the year.\"We've carried the Carl Junction losses on our backs for two years,\" said Lamar head coach Scott Bailey. \"I'm not sure if we have the horses, but we'll give them a good game. I'm looking forward to it.\" Lamar -- 13 15 13 0 - 41 Aurora -- 0 0 0 0 - 0 Filed Under :", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T09:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T11:34:02.812+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
