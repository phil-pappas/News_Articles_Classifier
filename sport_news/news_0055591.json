Ryne Sandberg and Rick Sutcliffe had the Cubs steaming toward their first winning season in 12 years, seemingly primed to stop those two infamous streaks at long, long last. \nThe most recent championship: 1908. The last World Series appearance: 1945. \n“Once we were on a roll, I thought we were gonna win the whole thing!” said Hall of Fame pitcher Dennis Eckersley, acquired that May in the trade that sent Bill Buckner to Boston. \nBut first, the Cubs had to hold off another long-floundering franchise that was finally on the rise. \nThe young and talented New York Mets had a 19-year-old phenom named Dwight Gooden who was taking over the Big Apple one breathtaking fastball at a time. \n“He was sick,” Eckersley said. \nPowered by Darryl Strawberry and piloted by new manager Davey Johnson, the Mets eclipsed 70 wins for the first time in eight seasons and reached 90 for just the second time in team history. \n“One of the most fun years I ever had in my life,” first baseman Keith Hernandez recalled. \nIt was hardly the most dramatic race on record - Chicago pulled away and won the NL East by 6 1/2 games. But the cities and ballparks and central characters involved certainly made it memorable. \n“Under today’s rules, we would have made the postseason,” Mets pitcher Ron Darling said. “But that was when the division mattered so much, and when stuff got real tough and the pressure was on, they knew how to handle it and we didn’t.” \nBoth rosters were bursting with fan favorites who had delightful, dip-n-dot names like Hubie Brooks and Mookie Wilson, Jody Davis and Larry Bowa, Wally Backman and Rusty Staub.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T10:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T12:46:58.412+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
