The right-hander has dominated Pittsburgh, including a dazzling performance in Game 4 of the 2013 NL Division Series with the Cardinals facing elimination. \nThe stakes weren't quite as high this time, and Wacha wasn't quite as crisp. Walker led off the second with his 16th homer, and Wacha's control abandoned him in the fourth. \nAndrew McCutchen led off with a single and Aramis Ramirez walked. Wacha intentionally walked Pedro Alvarez to load the bases with one out, and Cervelli sent the second pitch into the bleachers to put the Pirates up 5-1. Gregory Polanco added an RBI double later in the inning. \nWacha allowed six runs, four hits and four walks in four innings. \nTRAINER'S ROOM \nCardinals: RHP Adam Wainwright returned from a five-month stay on the disabled list and gave up one run in the eighth, his first appearance out of the bullpen since 2006. \nThe three-time All-Star tore his left Achilles on April 25, an injury that was thought to sideline him until 2016. Wainwright made it back well ahead of schedule, and manager Mike Matheny expects Wainwright to be in the mix to start in the playoffs barring a setback. \nThat's fine by the 34-year-old Wainwright, who called his grueling rehab \"not a fun deal\" but one that could pay off in October. \n\"The silver lining is my arm got some great rest and I'm healthy now,\" he said. \"All this is preseason for the real season coming up, right?\" \nTo make room for Wainwright the Cardinals placed RHP Carlos Martinez on the 60-day disabled list with a right shoulder strain. \nUP NEXT \nThe Cardinals take another shot at wrapping up the division in Game 2 when they send out Tyler Lyons (2-1, 3.96) to face Morton (9-8, 4.54). Lyons has an ERA of 4.93 in seven starts this year and a 1.76 ERA in eight relief appearances. Morton is just 2-11 against St. Louis and hasn't beaten the Cardinals since April 4, 2011.
