Lose to a traditional conference cakewalk before a nationally televised audience Thursday night on ESPN? That can't happen, right? \nRight? RFP: Which Auburn QB should start Thursday? \nAuburn knows it can't come off a bye and fall flat at Kentucky. A loss will further prove Gus Malzahn and his staff have failed to bring together a preseason national title contender and SEC favorite. Call them overrated, but the Tigers aren't playing to their potential, either. \nMalzahn and his staff can start making amends starting now, though. \nThey're going to make a game-time decision on the starting quarterback. Nice pregame drama, but whether they go with junior Jeremy Johnson or redshirt freshman Sean White, the quarterback has to make plays and smart decisions. \nMistakes happen, but the quarterback got to check into the right running play, make the proper reads and when it's there, test the defense downfield. If the quarterback struggles after nearly two weeks of preparation, it further confirms Malzahn and his staff has little, if any clue, what to do with the position. \nSometimes a player has to show the coach he can make it happen. It's why Peyton Barber continues to start even though Malzahn loves the home run capability of Kerryon Johnson and Roc Thomas. Does Auburn have a wideout or two who can make the Tigers really put Duke Williams in the rearview mirror? \nThe talented, but clearly troubled receiver is gone, but wasn't playing up his potential. So now it's time for someone to set the tone that he can be a go-to guy to help the quarterback. \nAuburn is paying Will Muschamp $1.6 million a year to keep Malzahn from worrying about defense. Now he's slowing down his offense in part to help out Muschamp's defense. The offense must still execute, but the defense will need to come up with consecutive stops to keep the team balanced. \nBeing without sophomore defensive end Carl Lawson hurts twofold because he was not only the defense's top player, but Auburn's secondary has had to cover longer than anticipated because the Tigers aren't getting the pass rush they could if Lawson was out there. \nHere's the worst part of all this. No one cares. \nIf Auburn was winning without Lawson, with a young secondary, subpar quarterback play and its most talented player being a distraction, no one would care. So the Tigers aren't going to get a pity party right now and things will get even worse if they lose Thursday night. \nThis is the most winnable conference game remaining on Auburn's schedule, which is scary considering the Tigers are just a 1 ½ point favorite. Sure Kentucky is 4-1, but it needed overtime to beat FCS school Eastern Kentucky before having its bye last week by Auburn. \nLet's back up a minute. \nAuburn is viewed as less than two points better than Kentucky. That's how far the Tigers have fallen. So if they lose, this can't even be considered an upset. Kentucky is improved, but it's the same program that dropped its final six games last season to post a losing record. \nThat tends to happen to losing programs. Auburn is not one of those, but a loss Thursday night could send it on that dreadful downward spiral toward a repeat of the 2012 season. \nWe all know how that ended. Winless in SEC. Coach fired. \nThings are bad for the Tigers. A loss at Kentucky will make it far worse than they could have imagined because frankly, no one at Auburn imagined this season going this way.
