This saying is now archaic, but the language is clear and the phrasing a bit comical. Try it on your friends and there is every chance of them liking it and starting to use it themselves. The name Saadah is not very common now, but the key word “a’da” is very much in use in the sense of “a get together,” and its repetition anchors the meaning and allows for the proverb’s revival.\nSource: Egyptian Proverbs, (Al-Ahram Center for Translation and Publishing, 1986) by Ahmed Taymour Pasha\nTranslated by: Nabil Shawkat", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T15:10:15.737+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
