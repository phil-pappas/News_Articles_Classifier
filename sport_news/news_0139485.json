Now the senior guard is blazing a new path. He's committed to SUNY - Potsdam , where he could be joined by Gompers mates Marco Diaz and Angel Florez . Both are also considering attending the Division III school.\nHere, Minott breaks down his decision to move upstate and explains how the season-ending upset has fueled his motivation to play at the next level.\n\"I went on a visit and it felt like home - the school's not too big, the dorms are nice and the players are, too. It was kind of a tough process because people were telling me to weigh my options, and I was seeing if something better might come along.\n\"My AAU coach sat me down and talked about the positives. It's a small town and it's a nice environment to be in. I think it'll be something I like because it's fresh air and a fresh start. It will be a better transition than being in the Bronx, where everything is cluttered and you don't always have time to yourself - and there's not a lot of positives going on sometimes.\n\"If (Diaz and Florez) come, it'll be great. You'll have someone to push you, to keep you focused, and you can do the same in return especially if we're sharing the same dorm. We're already working out together, playing pickup games in Central Park and doing pull-ups, dips, sit-ups - stuff to stay in shape.\n\"When that (game-winning) shot went in (against Westinghouse), I wished it could be my first day of high school again, so I could build up and try to win a championship. It made me look forward to college so I could try to do it there. I just look forward to getting better, and taking my game to the next level and beyond.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T07:56:01.858+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
