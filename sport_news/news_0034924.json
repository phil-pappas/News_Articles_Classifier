On Friday, it’ll be the Mecca of Mid-Illini Conference cross country because the boys and girls conference meets will be held there once again. Defending champions Metamora and Dunlap are heavily favored to win the boys and girls titles, respectively. As for Pekin, both teams feel they have something to prove and the runners also have something to overcome. This week is the school’s usually stressful mid-term exam week. “We’ve had the conference meet marked on our calendar,” said Dragons boys coach Cole Stoner. “The guys have been working hard since before the season began leading up to this meet. This is the part of the season when we want to be running our best, and it starts with the conference meet.” Pekin girls coach Erika Gilmore thinks Dunlap, Washington and Metamora should finish 1-2-3 in the meet. She’d like to see her young team give Metamora a battle for third place. “It’ll be a case of mind over matter,” she said. Stoner said his boys will be running not just for their team, but Pekin’s athletic program. “We want to do our part to help Pekin do well in the conference all-sports trophy standings,” he said. The Pekin boys enjoyed a mini-taper this week. “This is probably the freshest they’ve been in a couple of months,” Stoner said. Alex Olar, Kolton Dunkelbarger and Tanner Heiple are expected to be the Dragons’ top three runners, like they have been all season. Two more runners will score, and Stoner said they’ll mostly likely come from a group that includes Robbie Lawrence, Chase Paul, Jeremy Vogel and Andrew Wolfe. Metamora’s Jake Gillum will be back to defend his individual title. Dunlap and Limestone are expected to be the prime challengers for the Redbirds’ team championship. Pekin freshmen Paige Arseneau and Candice Boldt haven’t run like rookies this season and they’ll have a chance Friday at the girls meet to add more laurels to their resume. Gilmore said Arseneau has a shot at being all-conference. That honor goes to the top nine finishers. Abby Jokisch of Metamora won the girls race last year. She’s now competing for Bradley University. Canton’s Nicole Beebe finished second to Jokisch last season and is the runner to beat Friday. The girls race will be at 4:30 p.m. and the boys race at 5 p.m.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T09:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T15:43:31.540+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
