Facebook Betsy Hodges and the Minneapolis City Council, when they put themselves in the shoes of the thousands of low-wage worker s that make this glimmering city tick, realized that it would totally suck to never get a sick day. To have to rearrange doctor’s appointments and babysitting to accommodate last-minute schedule changes.\nSo they came up with the Working Families Agenda , a set of rudimentary workplace reforms they felt all businesses could reasonably comply with.\nBut for local business owners, the pitch tasted like battery acid and they let the city council know. These basic standards do have exceptions. Clerks should have the choice of collecting hours however they want, even if it means catching just a wink of sleep between shifts. Restaurants can’t always account for diners to flood the tables. Target Center can’t predict if the Lynx will win another championship and throw an impromptu celebration party.\nstruck fair scheduling from the Working Families Agenda entirely, promising to return to the issue once she’s done more research.\nWaves of bitter grumblings followed from low-wage workers who were convinced that the mayor had caved to bosses butt-hurt over pocketing fewer dollars.\nFrom a political point of view, things aren’t looking so great for Hodges. As she navigates the straits of doing by the people without becoming an overreaching government bigwig, the law just isn’t panning out.\nBut she is taking a shot at helping ordinary folks out, and reacting to the feedback when it comes pouring in. It’s exactly what we want our elected leaders to be doing: to accept getting shat on by the people as the people see fit, to scoop out the seeds of logic rolled into their anger and resentment, and whip up some policies that everybody can stomach.\nHodges, it seems, is trying to do that.\nPlus, the Working Families Agenda really isn’t as far-reaching as it could be. If all workers were paid enough to actually make a living off a job without fearing that taking one day off would put them behind rent for the month, or that shifting schedules would prevent them from making it to a second job on time, there wouldn’t be such an urgent need for all these satellite reforms.\nBut raising the minimum wage in Minneapolis isn’t possible if Minneapolis were to go it alone. Though workers across the country may clamor for $15 an hour, Hodges has refused to decree a hike if it would drive business to St. Paul and other neighboring cities.\nThat’s a task better left to the state legislature, which as it reconvenes for the next year, could take some lessons from Minneapolis' lead.\nContact: Susan Du Follow: @shijundu ", "external_links": ["https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=7&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0CEAQFjAGahUKEwio-_SgrM_IAhUIzIAKHUsiBnU&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.citypages.com%2Fnews%2Fmeet-the-people-whod-be-helped-by-the-working-families-agenda-7752898&usg=AFQjCNEfudzcI7DxTQcloZVLtexH6xRhhQ&bvm=bv.105454873,d.eXY", "http://www.twitter.com/citypages", "https://twitter.com/shijundu", "https://www.facebook.com/BetsyHodgesForMayor/photos/pb.358799627552374.-2207520000.1445286514./512749745490694/?type=3&theater", "https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=5&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0CDIQFjAEahUKEwio-_SgrM_IAhUIzIAKHUsiBnU&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.citypages.com%2Frestaurants%2Fbreaking-mayors-office-backs-down-on-working-families-agenda-7752742&usg=AFQjCNG_NlS9ZS3BaItBqJekSzlzuXIzGA&bvm=bv.105454873,d.eXY", "https://www.facebook.com/citypages"], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T15:15:42.591+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
