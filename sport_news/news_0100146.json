New Orleans to Texas\nDunbar lived in New Orleans until 2005, his sophomore year of high school, when Hurricane Katrina displaced his family. The group eventually settled Haltom City, where Dunbar was a first-team all-district running back his junior and senior seasons.\n2. Hurricane Katrina\nDunbar's family heeded the Hurricane Katrina warnings and evacuated to Mississippi, according to DallasCowboys.com. Eventually they decided upon North Texas and Haltom City because they had a family friend that went to school in Haltom City. Shortly after arriving, the Dunbar family's moving trailer, which contained almost everything the family had, was stolen.\n3. Big-time offers\nDunbar was a rated a two-star recruit by Rivals.com, but told USA TODAY that he had offers from Oklahoma State, Colorado, Arkansas and Virginia. He instead chose North Texas because he wanted to stay near his mother. Also, his former high school coach had become the wide receivers coach there.\n4. Near last-minute switches\nDunbar was initially going to go to Oklahoma State, he told DallasCowboys.com, but aside from the location and the relationships, he also wanted to play right away. The day he signed with North Texas, LSU -- the school he grew up rooting for -- called him. He chose to stay with the Mean Green.\n5. Record setter\nOn the last day of his college career, Dunbar set North Texas' single-game rushing record with 313 yards against Middle Tennessee State. The performance also gave him North Texas' career rushing record, as he finished his career with 4,224 yards, besting Patrick Cobb by 174 yards. Dunbar also holds the North Texas record for career rushing touchdowns with 41.\n6. Dropping out of the draft\nDunbar held a party with more than 60 people for the 2012 NFL Draft, but he wasn't selected. Late the draft the Cowboys began inquiring about signing him as a free agent. He eventually did sign with Dallas despite being a Saints fan all the way through college, according to the team website.\n7. Speed demon\nIt's a fact that Dunbar is one of the fastest guys on the team, but is he the fastest? He said he was in 2014, but when timed over 20 yards he actually lost in a race to cornerback Sterling Moore. Dunbar maintained he was still faster than Moore.\n\"I know he's not (faster than me),\" Dunbar said. \"I've seen him run before.\"\nFor the record, Dunbar wasn't invited to the combine but ran a 4.47 40-yard dash at his pro day.\n8. Kingpin\nDunbar is a big bowler. He and former Cowboys linebacker Bruce Carter to hit the lanes whenever they had some free time. Dunbar said in 2014 that his high score was \"at least\" 225.\n9. Highlight-reel worthy\nDunbar's best play as a pro came on Thanksgiving Day 2013 against the Raiders. The Cowboys trailed 21-14 in the third quarter when Dunbar took a handoff, broke one tackle, cut to avoid a Raider, then made another cut that caused two Raiders defenders to run into each other and took off for a 45-yard run. The play set up a touchdown. Dallas went on to win the game, 31-24.\n10. Running back with receiver stats\nDunbar's high-water mark came in that Thanksgiving Day game against the Raiders when he led the team with 82 rushing yards. He hasn't rushed for more than 27 yards in any other game. He has, however, eclipsed the 50-yard receiving mark three times in his career, with two of those times coming this season. His career high so far is 100 yards on 10 catches.\nMore Cowboys coverage Latest news, opinion, analysis\nGeorge: Lance Dunbar, Cowboys' Darren Sproles starter kit, will return to play in hometown New Orleans\nCowboys' Jeremy Mincey regrets playing with concussion: Family is 'team' I should play for\nBob Sturm: On the offensive line's struggles; on Brandon Weeden's short throws\nQB Tony Romo does light cardio work\nBob Sturm: What kind of impact Greg Hardy will have when he returns; is Terrance Williams a No. 2 WR?\nRB Lance Dunbar: Sitting back and watching for a couple years made me a better person\nCowboys Q&A: Tyler Clutts explains rookie songs, being in chess club, the weird things his son eats and more\nChristine Michael in the mix to be on Cowboys' active roster\nSportsDay experts, more give their Week 4 NFL picks\nDo the Dallas Cowboys have a quarterback controversy?\nTerrell Owens is still waiting for Jerry Jones to call about that Cowboys comeback\nSturm's Xs and Os: How Cowboys made Julio Jones' 45-yard TD easier and more\n10 things you might not know about Lance Dunbar, including how he ended up at North Texas\nCowboys send RB Joseph Randle message after his career day\nWashington basketball star still has soft spot for Cowboys\nWhat players, coaches, execs, opponents say Travis Frederick: Doesn't matter if QB is back there making a sandwich, we have to hold our blocks\nCowboys WR Terrance Williams takes responsibility for disappearing act, says 'there are no excuses'\nCowboys' Brandon Weeden never thought he'd ever be asked if he checks down too much\nSaints coach Sean Payton: Cowboys might be lacking 'spaghetti sauce' element without Tony Romo\nStephen Jones: We're not trying to hold on, we're trying to win games\nSaints RB Mark Ingram: 'Anytime you get a chance to play the Cowboys it's always a big deal'\nFun stuff\nFantasy football: Time to grab Cowboys' Lance Dunbar\nCowboys fans tear into Brandon Weeden in Top 25 fan-made memes\nNeed a laugh after the game?
