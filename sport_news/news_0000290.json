(Jim Rassol / Sun Sentinel) Staff and wire report \nThe Miami Dolphins became the first team since at least 1940 to score four offensive touchdowns of at least 50 yards in a half, as they beat the Houston Texans 44-26 Sunday. \nMiami led 41-0 at halftime as Dan Campbell became the fifth interim coach of 26 since 2000 to win his first two games. Since the firing of Joe Philbin on Oct. 5, the Dolphins (3-3) have gone from notorious underachievers to contending for their first playoff berth since 2008. \nThe Dolphins had been 0-7 previously against Houston (2-5). Miami's four long scores in the first half were the most in at least 75 years, according to STATS. \nThe Dolphins routed the Tennessee Titans 38-10 last week in Campbell’s debut. \nDefensive end Cameron Wake got his first four sacks of the season and forced two fumbles — all in the second quarter — as Miami ended a three-game losing streak. \nWith Campbell preaching a more fun and physical approach, the Dolphins finished the Tennessee game with six sacks and intercepted Titans QB Marcus Mariota twice. \nThe Dolphins get back to .500 by earning their first-ever win against the Texans. \nMiami came into that Week 6 matchup without a rushing touchdown, but wide receiver Jarvis Landry ended that drought with a TD run, and running back Lamar Miller ran for 113 yards and a score.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T22:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T00:13:50.239+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
