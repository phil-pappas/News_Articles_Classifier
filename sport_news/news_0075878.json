United coach Mike Gorni for positively influencing his game, has had some spot duty at center back for Liberty coach Jason Horvath this fall. \nSpeaking of the Hurricanes, they’re 16-1 and recently beat Parkland for the first time since 2007. With one major decision out of the way, Muller is dialed-in on the large goals still ahead. \n“It’s a huge weight off my shoulders,” he said. “Now, I can just focus on playing the high school season, having fun, scoring and definitely winning.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T01:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T02:51:51.308+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
