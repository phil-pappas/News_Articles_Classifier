Dodgers Score Early, Mets Respond, Lead 4-3 in Game 3 of NLDS After a three-run top of the second inning for the Dodgers, the Mets responded with four runs in the bottom half of the inning and lead 4-3 in Game 3 of the NLDS in the first ever playoff game at Citi Field.

(Photo by Elsa/Getty Images) After a three-run top of the second inning for the Dodgers, the Mets responded with four runs in the bottom half of the inning and lead 4-3 in Game 3 of the NLDS in the first ever playoff game at Citi Field. Curtis Granderson hit a bases-clearing double with two outs off Brett Anderson to give the Mets the 4-3 lead heading into the third inning. The Dodgers scored three runs in the top of the second after four consecutive singles to start the inning. Yasmani Grandal capped it off with a bases clearing single. Granderson's throw to third base went past David Wright, allowing Carl Crawford to score and Grandal to advance to second base. Before the game, all eyes were on Chase Utley and Ruben Tejada during pregame player introductions. Utley is not in the Dodgers starting lineup, despite his success against Mets' starter Matt Harvey, was booed profusely by the New York crowd. Utley was suspended for two games by Major League Baseball on Sunday for what the league determined to be an \"illegal\" slide by Utley at second base in the bottom of the seventh inning during Game 2. Tejada broke his leg on the play, and Mets players as well as fans were angry at Utley for what they deemed a \"dirty play.\" Utley appealed his two-game suspension and because MLB could not schedule the hearing before first pitch of Game 3, Utley will be allowed to play until his hearing is held. During pregame introductions, Tejada surprised New York fans by walking out of the Mets dugout holding a blue cane and his right leg in a cast. Fans cheered wildly and the atmosphere for first pitch was electric. The first pitch of the game was delayed due to the replay phone in the Dodgers' dugout not operating. Harvey threw an extra five minutes of warm up pitches while the phone was fixed. Once the first pitch was thrown, there was no retaliation, no Dodgers batter was hit by Harvey, and umpires did not warn both benches.
