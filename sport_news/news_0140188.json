But the situation is a good one, and the attitude of our players is second to none. \n\"We are all hungry.\" \nIndeed, despite winning so many trophies in recent years, Bayern do not seem to be sated. \n\"We're very happy because we've beaten one of the best sides in Europe,\" said coach Pep Guardiola, who is looking for a hat-trick of Bundesliga titles. \n\"I want to congratulate my players, not only for this game but also for the recent months. We've done a good job.\" \nDortmund coach Thomas Tuchel did not want to entertain the idea of his side being title candidates before the game, and he was even more convinced by that after. \n\"We've got to accept that we were not good enough,\" said the Dortmund coach. \"Congratulations to Bayern - they deserved to win.\" \nThe international break means Bayern will have to wait a fortnight before getting the opportunity to make it nine wins out of nine when they travel to Werder Bremen. \nDortmund, meanwhile, have plenty of time to assess what went wrong and what still needs to be done to move into Bayern's league before they travel to Tuchel's ex-club Mainz on October 16. \n\"We've got to shake ourselves and start over,\" said Tuchel after his side's first defeat of the season. \"That's vitally necessary now.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T10:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T18:50:03.520+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
