He said: “While this event may be the finale of SG50, it will mark the beginning of a new friendship where we come together to learn from one another.” \nSAPGOC chairman Lim Teck Yin said the opening ceremony will involve people from all woks of life. \n“The 8th ASEAN Para Games is set to be the most inclusive sporting event ever held in Singapore. The opening ceremony is no exception,” he said. “Just as how our Team Singapore athletes competing in the games amplify the spirit of courage and determination, we hope that the community at large too, will be inspired to celebrate the triumph of the human spirit and to live better through sport.” \nTickets for the opening ceremony are priced at S$20 while there’s also a concession price for youths (2-18 years old), NSF and seniors (50 years and above) at S$10. \nMembers of the public can purchase tickets at sportshubtix.sg, at the Singapore Sports Hub box office, or at all SingPost outlets starting this Friday (Oct 23). However, those who have registered their interest in August 2015 can start purchasing their tickets today.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T11:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T20:34:18.824+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
