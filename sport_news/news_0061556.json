Jean Nagy / Boston.com On Thursday night, the curtains at the Boston Opera house will open, and for the next hour and 45 minutes, the Boston Ballet will take the stage for a non-stop performance and become the fourth company in the world to perform the “Third Symphony of Gustav Mahler: A Ballet by John Neumeier,” since it premiered in 1975 in Hamburg, Germany.\n“The music is so beautiful and epic,” ballerina Shelby Elsbree told Boston.com. “We’ve been running the ballet at least once a day now leading up to the premier. It’s this very cathartic experience and you end up feeling exhausted either way. The music takes you through this emotional experience.”\nThe performance is especially difficult for the male dancers. The first movement is 30 minutes long, and is performed by only the males of the company.\n“The guys had to do a lot of cross training, they’re doing a lot of male partnering, and it’s very athletic for them,” Elsbree said.\nBecause it’s so demanding — the dancers have been practicing for up to eight hours each day — the ballet has only been done a handful of times. Its length poses a great challenge not only to the dancers but to the orchestra, the conductor, and the chorus as well.\n“It’s quite a journey, it’s a huge undertaking so we’re honored to be worthy of it,” Elsbree said.\nThird Symphony of Gustav Mahler: A Ballet by John Neumeier, performed by the Boston Ballet, will run October 22-November 1 at the Boston Opera House.\nBy Nina Godlewski @NinaJGodlewski Photos by Jean Nagy @jeannagy Share 0 Tweet 0 Advertisement Performing arts A sneak peek of the rare, new performance by the Boston Ballet 10.22.15 | 6:01 AM Celebrity news Jimmy Fallon will parade through Harvard Square this weekend 10.21.15 | 8:52 PM Movies The top 50 scariest movies of all time 10.21.15 | 4:23 PM Movies Here’s the Stars Wars ticket situation in Boston for its opening night and day 10.21.15 | 12:07 PM TV Larry Wilmore praises Massachusetts for its gun law as only he can 10.21.15 | 12:03 PM Entertainment Going back in time with Back to the Future’s Christopher Lloyd 10.21.15 | 10:46 AM Life Ringo Starr is having an art show in Boston this week 10.21.15 | 9:00 AM TV Two local chefs will rep Boston in new Top Chef season 10.20.15 | 9:55 AM Celebrity news Obviously not-from-Boston Bill Murray says Red Sox fans are ‘unbearable’ 10.20.15 | 9:51 AM TV Gilmore Girls star ‘won’t confirm or deny’ Netflix revival report 10.19.15 | 8:19 PM Celebrity news Bridget Moynahan got married 10.19.15 | 10:08 AM TV Larry David does pretty, pretty good Bernie Sanders impression on SNL 10.18.15 | 1:53 PM News Cambridge teens can build their own clocks, just like Ahmed 10.17.15 | 4:59 PM Entertainment There’s still a chance for ‘Roadrunner’ to become our ‘State Rock Song’ 10.16.15 | 3:52 PM Entertainment The Internet Cat Video Festival returns to Boston 10.16.15 | 2:08 PM Music What it’s like to sell cassettes in 2015 10.16.15 | 12:24 PM Events Say goodbye to the Echelman sculpture at this closing event (for real this time) 10.15.15 | 1:28 PM Events Break out your cardigans, the Head of the Charles is here 10.15.15 | 11:32 AM Celebrity news Tom Brady is just so grateful to have his ‘Boston crew, man’ 10.15.15 | 9:02 AM Entertainment Donald Trump fires back at Steven Tyler 10.14.15 | 9:47 PM Celebrity news Steve Carell is the everyman, tells Ellen he owns a general store in Marshfield 10.14.15 | 9:56 AM News MBTA auctioning-off murals from Government Center stop 10.13.15 | 8:05 PM Celebrity news Matt Damon cannot, will not live without Ben and is also selling his L.A. home 10.13.15 | 4:23 PM Celebrity news Here’s Donnie Wahlberg living his best life on the New Kids on the Block Cruise 10.13.15 | 1:21 PM Visual arts Watch breathtaking drone footage of the Rose Kennedy Greenway sculpture like you’ve never seen it before 10.13.15 | 11:00 AM Community It appears we have a “Keytar Cub” on our hands… 10.12.15 | 2:42 PM Entertainment Watch Fenway light up like you’ve never seen it before 10.11.15 | 12:10 PM Celebrity news Defamation suit by Cosby accusers will go forward 10.09.15 | 2:52 PM Events Honor a delicious piece of our state heritage at the Cranberry Harvest Celebration 10.09.15 | 1:24 PM Entertainment Mayor Walsh honors the Godmother of Punk, declares October 10 ‘Patti Smith Day’ 10.09.15 | 12:25 PM", "external_links": ["http://www.twitter.com/jeannagy", "http://www.twitter.com/NinaJGodlewski", "http://c.o0bc.com/rw/SysConfig/WebPortal/BDC/Framework/img/bcom_logo_with_name.png"], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T14:24:33.872+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
