He returned to start the third series and completed 3 of 4 passes for 49 yards to move UW from its 12 to the Illinois 39. \nBut then on first down, UW had to burn a timeout when it appeared Stave could not decipher the play being signaled in from the sideline. \nBart Houston took the field after the timeout and finished the game. \n\"You could tell the way he wasn't getting the plays,\" Chryst said of Stave. \"He was cleared, but we thought Bart was going to be our best chance.\" \nVoltz, who missed the Purdue game last weekend after suffering an elbow injury at Nebraska, went down on a running play inside the Illinois 10 with UW trailing, 13-10. \nThat forced offensive coordinator Joe Rudolph to slide redshirt freshman Michael Deiter to center from left guard and insert another redshirt freshman, Micah Kapoi , in Deiter's spot. \nUW ran a power play behind left tackle Tyler Marz and Kapoi, and tailback Alec Ingold scored easily from 2 yards to help UW take a 17-13 lead. \nMarz said he wasn't surprised to see UW run to that side even though Kapoi had just entered the game. \n\"That's a play we pride ourselves in,\" Marz said. \"We're on the 3-yard line. When you're a Wisconsin lineman, you want to run the ball behind you and stuff it in the end zone.\" \nSafety Tanner McEvoy took over for Wheelwright, who finished with three catches for 47 yards. McEvoy had one catch for 11 yards. That was his first catch since Week 2 against Miami (Ohio), when he caught three passes for 29 yards. \nClement told reporters Tuesday he planned to travel with the team and determine before kickoff whether he would play. \nHowever, UW officials decided Thursday after practice that Clement was not ready to return to action. \nClement hasn't played since the opener against Alabama and underwent surgery Oct. 1. UW officials said they expected Clement to be out four to six weeks after undergoing surgery. \nThe absence of Clement and Deal left UW with three tailbacks: redshirt junior Dare Ogunbowale , freshman Ingold and redshirt junior Serge Trezy , who entered the day with two carries for 9 yards. \nWide receiver Alex Erickson led UW in rushing with 81 yards on four carries, all end-arounds. Ogunbowale rushed 16 times for 42 yards with a long run of 9. Ingold added 26 yards on 13 carries with a long run of 8. \nUW needs Clement to help jump-start the running game, but his return will have to wait one more week — if not more. \nThird down a charm: Illinois entered the day No. 2 in the Big Ten in third-down defense, having limited opponents to only a 22.3% success rate. \nOnly Michigan, at 19.6%, was better. \nUW had little trouble moving the ball on third down against the Illini. \nThe Badgers, who came in sixth in the league at 40.9%, converted 9 of 16 chances (56.3%). That tied the season-high mark, set in Week 2 against Miami and left UW 16 of 30 (53.3%) in the last two games. \nShoring the front wall: Even with Voltz back at center to open the game, the pass protection afforded Stave by the offensive line was awful. \nStave passed twice on UW's first series and was hit on both attempts, which were incomplete. He was sacked once on the next series, by end Carroll Phillips . Stave came out for a play because it appeared he hit his head on the turf. Houston came in and was sacked for a 3-yard loss by Phillips. \nIllinois finished with three sacks, but two came on UW's first five pass plays and the Badgers allowed only one sack in their last 10 series. \n\"I think we just need to start faster as an offensive line,\" Marz said. \"I think they're probably the best (front) we've seen, especially at end. \n\"They had some long guys, strong guys. And they're pretty quick. We just need to start faster.\" \nExtra points: Wide receiver D.J. Gillins got work as a blocker on UW's punt-return unit.... \nTight end Troy Fumagalli had five catches for 52 yards. He has 15 catches for 157 yards and a touchdown in the last three games. © 2015 , Journal Sentinel Inc. All rights reserved.
