You have to really put in the time and effort to work at it.’ He’d played in the prospects game, but I don’t know if he still believed that he had a real chance to be drafted. \n“But Calgary drafted him that year and he really made a commitment to off-ice training from then on. He really didn’t know how close he was to becoming a professional player. I think once he realized that he had the ability to become a professional player if he wanted to put in the time and effort, good things would happen.” \nGood things have happened. \nNow 21 and a rookie on the Flames’ blueline, Kulak returned to Vancouver for Saturday’s late date with the Canucks at Rogers Arena, his third outing at hockey’s highest level. \nBack home in Stony Plain, Alta., his old workout buddies were probably watching the action on CBC’s Hockey Night in Canada. \n“I obviously knew I had to get stronger, but at the time, I didn’t really know what it took off-ice,” Kulak said, reflecting on that exit meeting with Hay and the rest of the Giants’ staff after the 2011-12 WHL campaign. “The previous summer I had worked out in my friend’s garage, so I told them I was going to go back and put in my work in the garage again. They were shocked with the answer, I guess, and I was kind of shocked with how they responded to it. After more discussion, they really drilled into me the importance of really proper off-ice training. \n“That summer, I went to Body by Bennett in Edmonton. It was a little more advanced stuff. In the garage, I was doing more old-school, Rocky-style workouts.” \nHay provided a nudge in the right direction, but Kulak — a fourth-round selection in the 2012 NHL Draft — didn’t have to be told twice about the importance of his training sessions. \nFor the remainder of his junior career, he stuck around Vancouver to work with Giants’ fitness guru Ian Gallagher during the off-season. \nAnd after a one-game appetizer at the NHL level in April, the smooth-skating defenceman hung around Calgary this summer so he could train with Flames’ strength and conditioning coach Ryan van Asten. \n“There’s lot of upside, lots of potential in this young man,” Flames head coach Bob Hartley told reporters after Saturday’s morning skate in Vancouver. “He had a great camp, put in a great summer of work, and it shows. This business, 99% of the time, you get what you invest. It’s a great lesson. We’re very happy for Kuly, because he deserves it.” \nHay, who had a brief stint as the Flames’ head coach in 2000-01 and now ranks second on the WHL’s all-time wins list, is also thrilled for Kulak. \n“His growth on and off the ice was steady,” Hay said. “Each year he was there (in Vancouver), he got better. He got better at understanding the game on-ice. He got better at developing his game off the ice, in the weight-room. He didn’t really have a downtime in his growth. He just kept improving every year. \n“I think that’s a sign of a player who was aware of what he had to do to get to the next level.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T04:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T08:09:39.497+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
