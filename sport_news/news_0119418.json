A final decision on Blatter’s suspension will be made Friday by the head of FIFA’s ethics adjudicatory chamber Hans Joachim Eckhert. The ethics committee has been meeting in Zurich since Monday.\nBlatter’s provisional suspension is the latest blow to the organization mired in claims of widespread corruption.\nLate last month the Swiss attorney general opened criminal proceedings against Blatter for intentional mismanagement and misappropriation of FIFA’s funds. Swiss authorities questioned Blatter about the “disloyal payment” to Platini, but the investigation is also centered around a 2005 TV rights deal between FIFA and disgraced former FIFA vice president Jack Warner, who led the organization’s CONCACAF region from 1990-2011.\nDays after the Swiss investigation, Eckhert and the ethics committee banned Warner from soccer for life.\nFIFA secretary general Jerome Valcke was also suspended last month following allegations that implicated Valcke in a scheme to sell World Cup tickets above face value. He remains under investigation by FIFA.\nBoth Warner and Valcke were counted among Blatter’s allies within the governing body. The BBC reported in August that Valcke was also considering a presidential bid.\nLast week, the governing body’s commercial partners weighed in on the corruption scandal in a big way. Coca-Cola and McDonald’s, two of the World Cup’s largest sponsors, called for Blatter’s immediate resignation “for the benefit of the game.”\nBlatter refused to step down.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/34468663", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "http://www.usnews.com/news/sports/articles/2015/10/07/fifa-ethics-panel-meets-to-discuss-sepp-blatter-platini"], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T04:01:37.481+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
