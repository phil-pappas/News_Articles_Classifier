LOUIS — John Lackey lived up to his reputation as a pitcher who craves the ball in October, helping the St. Louis Cardinals cool off the upstart Chicago Cubs.\nLackey outpitched old teammate Jon Lester, allowing two hits into the eighth inning, and rookies Tommy Pham and Stephen Piscotty each homered late for the Cardinals in a 4-0 victory Friday night in the opener of their NL Division Series.\n\"Tonight was special, for sure,\" Lackey said. \"The atmosphere was outstanding, the crowd was really into it, and I knew I'd have to pitch well.\"\nHe did it in front of a standing room only crowd of 47,830 — the second-largest at 10-year-old Busch Stadium — with thousands of Cubs faithful mixed into the red throng for the first postseason game between the two long-time rivals.\nYadier Molina did his part behind the plate, too, wearing a splint to protect a strained left thumb ligament that sidelined him since Sept. 20. He was 0 for 3 but seemingly had no issues.\nLackey protected a 1-0 lead by holding the Cubs hitless for five innings, getting help from Kris Bryant' double-play ball by to end the fourth. Addison Russell ended the suspense with a solid single up the middle to open the sixth and Kyle Schwarber's bunt hit leading off the seventh was the only other hit allowed by Lackey in 7 1-3 innings.\nKevin Siegrist struck out two to end the eighth, when it was still a one-run game. Trevor Rosenthal gave up a single and a walk but fanned three in finishing the three-hitter.\nGame 2 of the best-of-five series is Saturday. The Cardinals turn to lefty Jaime Garcia (10-6), who made 20 starts coming off risky thoracic surgery. Kyle Hendricks (8-7) makes his postseason debut for the NL wild-card winners.\nMatt Holliday had an RBI single in the first, giving St. Louis a lead after just three at-bats. Pinch-hitting, Pham homered off Lester with one out in the eighth to snap a string of 13 straight outs for the lefty. Piscotty had a two-run shot off Pedro Strop in the eighth.\nThe 36-year-old Lackey outdid Lester, with whom he formed a potent 1-2 punch on the 2013 Red Sox, the team that knocked off the Cardinals in the World Series.\nLackey is 3-0 with an 0.93 ERA in four starts against Chicago overall. Lester is 1-4, but he has a 2.79 ERA against St. Louis.\nIncluding their wild-card victory at Pittsburgh, the Cubs had won nine in a row. They haven't scored since the fifth inning of that 4-0 victory, however.\nROYALS 5, ASTROS 4\nKANSAS CITY, Mo. — The Kansas City Royals whipped out the same formula that carried them to last year's World Series to turn back the Houston Astros and tie their AL Division Series at a game apiece.\nSome clutch hitting. Stingy defense. An unflappable bullpen.\nEven a little help from replay.\n\"Just battling,\" first baseman Eric Hosmer said. \"That's what this team does so well.\"\nThe Royals rallied from a three-run deficit Friday, getting a go-ahead single from Ben Zobrist in the seventh inning, and then watched Wade Davis and the bullpen make it stand in a 5-4 victory that brought back memories of their nip-and-tuck postseason of a year ago.\nThe Royals knotted the game at 4 off Scott Kazmir and relievers Oliver Perez and Josh Fields in the sixth. Kansas City took the lead in the seventh when Alcides Escobar led off with a triple against Will Harris (0-1) and Zobrist followed with his single through the left side.\nKelvin Herrera (1-0) and Ryan Madson each tossed a scoreless inning for the Royals, and Davis came on to close it — though the real drama was only beginning.\nDavis walked Preston Tucker with one out, and speedy Carlos Gomez came in as a pinch-runner. Davis snapped a throw to Hosmer at first, and he neatly snagged it on one hop as Gomez made a dive back to the bag. Gomez was initially ruled safe, but the call was overturned upon review.\nJose Altuve then grounded out to end it, giving Davis the save.\nIt was a crucial victory considering what awaits Kansas City in Game 3 on Sunday: Astros ace Dallas Keuchel, who was 15-0 at home this season. Edinson Volquez will start for Kansas City.\nRANGERS 6, BLUE JAYS 4\nToronto Blue Jays third baseman Josh Donaldson reacts in the dugout as the Texas Rangers defeated his team in the 14th inning of baseball Game 2 of the American League Division Series in Toronto, Friday, Oct. 9, 2015. Nathan Denette/The Canadian Press via AP\nTORONTO — Two games into their first playoff appearance in 22 years, the Toronto Blue Jays have put themselves in a tight spot.\nBackup infielder Hanser Alberto hit a game-winning single in the 14th inning Friday, helping the Texas Rangers beat the Blue Jays 6-4 for a 2-0 lead in the best-of-five American League Division Series.\n\"The task at hand is pretty simple,\" slugger Josh Donaldson said. \"We have to win or we go home.\"\nThis isn't where the Blue Jays expected to be after a red-hot second half propelled them past the Yankees and secured their first division title since 1993.\n\"Our backs are against the wall,\" Blue Jays shortstop Troy Tulowitzki said. \"It's not where you want to be but that's what we're faced with.\"\nThe underdog Rangers will try to sweep the Blue Jays at home in Game 3 Sunday. Martin Perez will start for Texas against Marco Estrada.\nAlberto, batting last and only in the lineup because star third baseman Adrian Beltre was out with a strained back, made an error that led to Toronto's first two runs but redeemed himself with his big hit in extra innings.\n\"We were pretty confident going into the second game regardless of Adrian getting hurt,\" Rangers outfielder Delino DeShields said. \"We were kind of bummed out about that, but we kept our heads up.\"\nAlberto, a 22-year-old rookie who made his big league debut this season, also had a sacrifice fly.\nMETS 3, DODGERS 1\nLOS ANGELES — Jacob deGrom struck out 13 over seven scoreless innings in his postseason debut and Daniel Murphy homered off a star-crossed Clayton Kershaw to help the New York Mets defeat the Los Angeles Dodgers 3-1 on Friday night for a 1-0 lead in their NL Division Series.\nDeGrom (1-0) limited the Dodgers to five hits and one walk. The right-hander's strikeouts tied the franchise playoff record set by Tom Seaver in Game 1 of the 1973 NL Championship Series.\nKershaw (0-1) endured his fifth straight postseason loss after giving up the seventh playoff homer of his career. Last season's NL MVP and Cy Young Award winner allowed three runs and four hits in 6 2-3 innings, struck out 11 and walked four.\nRuns will likely again be at a premium when the Dodgers try to even the series Saturday night in Game 2. They start major league ERA leader Zack Greinke against Noah Syndergaard.", "external_links": ["http://images.performgroup.com/namedImage/12637/install_flash.gif", "http://media.advance.net/mlb_2013_national_desk/photo/josh-donaldson-8871e6dc183aa4c0.jpg", "http://static.eplayer.performgroup.com/flash/js/swfobject.js", "http://media.advance.net/mlb_2013_national_desk/photo/18939981-standard.jpg", "http://www.adobe.com/go/getflashplayer", "http://static.eplayer.performgroup.com/flash/js/performgroup.js"], "published": "2015-10-10T07:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T12:10:54.451+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
