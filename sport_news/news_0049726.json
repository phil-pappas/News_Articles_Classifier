Steve Beshear and Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer announced the expansion plan of MISA, which provides steel cutting, welding, machining, fabricating and other services to industrial clients. The project will create 18 jobs and involve an investment by the company of $4.3 million.\nThe project is intended to upgrade MISA’s current space to better serve customers. The changes will also give employees a safer, more productive environment. Shop floor space will increase by 36,000 square feet, providing room for additional equipment, inventory and material handling.\nMISA opened in 1989 in Jefferson County, primarily providing carbon steel cutting via oxy-fuel, plasma, laser and band saw. The local plant was established as a supplier of steel assembly parts to Toyota Industrial Equipment Manufacturing, which remains the company’s largest customer.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T22:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T23:33:37.365+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
