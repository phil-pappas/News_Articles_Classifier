The event’s agenda was to raise awareness for suicide prevention and to combat the stigma associated with mental illness. September is National Suicide Prevention Awareness Month creating the perfect opportunity for the golf classic to be held.\nSuicide is the second leading cause of death for 15-24 year olds in the United States. Every 26 seconds an attempt at suicide is made. The tragic topic has hit close to home with Sunrise Cares founders, and siblings, Tristan and Payton Doran and Eternal Essence founder, Alexis Kauchick, who lost a dear friend to suicide this year, and have vowed to make a difference as they talk about mental health issues that affect our young people and how they can get help.\nProceeds from the event benefited The Benjamin School, FC Florida Soccer Club, The Ryan Licht Sang Bipolar Foundation, The First Tee of the Palm Beaches, and Paws Assistance dogs.\nIn addition to the golf, the event also included a prize filled raffle, various course contests, and a silent auction. Masters flags signed by Gary Player and Jack Nicklaus were donated by Gary Player’s son, Wayne Player, for the silent auction.\nDuring the awards ceremony and check presentations, Tristan, Payton, and Alexis spoke about how their friend’s suicide had touched their lives and graciously thanked everyone for their support of the event.\nOur first fundraiser golf outing was a success, people came together to support the cause, golf, and meet new friends. We are all looking forward to an even bigger and better event next year. Even the unpredictable Florida weather showed up smiling in support of the First Annual Sunrise Cares Golf Classic’s cause.\n //www.prweb.com/releases/2015/10/prweb13017700.htm\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.prweb.com/releases/2015/10/prweb13017700.htm"], "published": "2015-10-14T08:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T07:18:17.026+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
