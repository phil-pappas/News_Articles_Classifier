The Redskins have a different defensive coordinator, but the opposing offenses' top pass catcher in Washington's first two games were tight ends.\nWhen the Eagles enter field-goal range, kicker Caleb Sturgis will be a player to watch. The team signed him on Tuesday to replace the injured Cody Parkey. When the Redskins have the ball \nThe Washington offense is built around a strong running game. Alfred Morris and rookie Matt Jones both ran for 100 yards in the first two weeks, and coach Jay Gruden mixes both into the game. Morris averages 4.1 yards per carry, and Jones averages 5.3. The 6-foot-2, 231-pound Jones also has two fumbles. The Redskins' offensive line has been productive under new position coach Bill Callahan. Left tackle Trent Williams is one of the top linemen in the NFL, although he will be playing with a new left guard, Arie Kouandjio, next to him on Sunday. First-round pick Brandon Scherff is the team's right guard. \nThe strength of the Eagles defense is its run-stopping unit. Cedric Thornton and Taylor Hart are out for the second consecutive week, but Brandon Bair effectively filled in last week and will start again on Sunday. Linebacker Mychal Kendricks is questionable to return after missing last week with an injury. Even if he plays, Jordan Hicks will continue to have a role at linebacker. \nQuarterback Kirk Cousins won the starting job over Robert Griffin III. He is completing 69.2 percent of his passes, but he has also thrown four interceptions. The Eagles' five interceptions are tied for third most in the NFL. Cousins' best game came last season against the Eagles, when he threw for 427 yards and three touchdowns in a loss. Cousins also had former Eagles receiver DeSean Jackson that day. Jackson is out with a hamstring injury. Washington's top wide receiver is Pierre Garcon, who had 15 catches for 199 yards against the Eagles last season. The Eagles must account for tight end Jordan Reed. He's Washington's leading receiver, and they like to use him in the slot. Safety Malcolm Jenkins could see time on Reed. Running back Chris Thompson had eight catches for the Redskins last week, so he's a receiving threat out of the backfield. \nWhen Washington punts the ball, all eyes will be on Eagles returner Darren Sproles. He returned a punt for a touchdown last week, and Washington is one of six NFL teams to have allowed a punt return touchdown this season. The big number \n27: DeSean Jackson averaged 27 yards per catch in two games against the Eagles last season. He had nine catches for 243 yards against his former team. Jackson has a hamstring injury that he suffered early in Week 1 and is expected to miss Sunday's game. Without that big-play ability, Washington has struggled with the deep ball. Quarterback Kirk Cousins hs completed only two passes that have traveled more than 20 yards. The Eagles defense, which has placed an emphasis on preventing big plays, would have been tested with Jackson in the lineup. Without him, it will be easier to limit the \"X\" plays that hurt the Eagles last December in their loss to Washington.
