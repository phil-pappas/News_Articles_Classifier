He was unanimously elected the board president at its headquarters where political bigwigs, bureaucrats, industrialists and ex-cricketers - all who oversee the administration of the game across the country - were present for the 'official coronation'.\nHis first stint, between 2008 and 2011, had involved carving out an administrative roadmap for a financially robust cricket board. The tenure also saw Manohar's decision-making abilities when he took some stern steps to clean up the mess in the wake of scams clouding the Indian Premier League.\nHis second stint is expected to be on the same lines, only this time he'll be saddled with far too many responsibilities than the first one. \"Restoring the faith of the Indian cricket fan, improving the credibility and image of the BCCI (post the spot-fixing scandal) and bringing in transparency (an accusation often leveled against the board) will be among the immediate responsibilities,\" Manohar said, minutes after taking charge.\nManohar spoke of issues that will be his immediate focus as president and asked for two months to carry out a flurry of reforms (see box). \"Just give me two months time. I would not ask you for time but in two months' time, all these things about which I have spoken will be implemented in full force,\" he said.\nThe board president was clear that he would not go about his job in a vindictive manner, given his two-year acrimony with the N Srinivasan-led regime that had been running BCCI until last year. Manohar, who was once friends with the Chennai-based industrialist, had been the most vocal among those who wanted Srinivasan to quit post the spot-fixing scandal broke in 2013.\n\"He was a great (BCCI) secretary. The best after Jagmohan Dalmiya,\" Manohar said, evident that he always had respect for Srinivasan's administrative abilities. However, it was in the backdrop of all the scandals and controversies the last two years that Manohar became a strong critic of Srinivasan, urging that the latter should've quit the board once the Supreme Court found his son-in-law guilty of betting and conflict of interest began to raise its ugly head in the game's administration.\nThe effort to be transparent at all times has been an inherent quality of Manohar's, one that has seen him earn the respect of most BCCI administrators who come from far more affluent and influential backgrounds. His initiative in 2010 to call off the IPL franchise auction after doubts over rigging had emerged and bringing out a fresh tender was one of Manohar's earlier successful attempts in bringing transparency within BCCI, a process that concluded with the suspension of Lalit Modi in BCCI.\n\"The first thing (Manohar intends to accomplish) would be with regards the conflict of interest issues,\" he said on Sunday. The board will frame regulations with regards to conflict of interest of administrators, players and their staff. That would be done within a month's time, and the board would also appoint and ombudsman or an ethics officer who would be independent of this board and who would look into the complaints (be it administrators, players or the staff), he added.\nIt's been a grey area for the board that's eaten much into its reputation lately.\nThose who have Manohar's ear insist he wasn't interested in returning to BCCI, particularly so once he had made it clear that he wouldn't get involved in its day-to-day administration any further. However, after Dalmiya's sudden demise and for lack of a consensus candidate, one that would be acceptable to all parties concerned, more importantly the ruling government, he was asked to come forward once again and he obliged. Such was the urge among all cricket administrators this time around that all six representatives from the East Zone - once considered N Srinivasan's backyard - nominated Manohar for president and he was given the chair without an election.\n\"The BCCI is a huge brand in itself. This brand was created because of the love of the fans. In the last few days, the confidence of cricket fans has been shaken due to certain unpleasant things. It is the duty of all members of the board to build back the reputation for which a lot of administrators have worked hard,\" he said.\nGiven the way he likes to function, the coming months are certainly going to be most decisive where BCCI is concerned.\nMinutes after taking charge as president, Shashank Manohar listed out the issues that he would take up immediately and carry out certain reforms within the next two months...\nConflict of Interest: The board would frame regulations with regards to conflict of interest of administrators, players and their staff. That would be done within a month's time, and the board will appoint an ombudsman or an ethics officer who would be independent and would look into the complaints (with regards to conflict of interest).\nPreventing corruption: Board will lay down norms and take forward measures to prevent corruption in the game. There will be programmes to educate players. The board will try and meet government officials to see if it can get certain investigative agencies, because the board does not have any investigative powers to curb corruption and therefore our hands are tied.\nAccountability: A lot of is said about how state associations are paid huge money by the BCCI and nobody knows what happens to that money - whether it is spent on cricketing activities or otherwise. Accounts of all associations have their own internal auditors. We would build a system by which accounts of all affiliated units would be audited by an independent auditor appointed by BCCI, after which further money would be released to these associations. The board would also be empowered to take action in case it finds that money is not being properly utilized.\nTransparency: There is another grievance that the board is not transparent and everything is kept under wraps. This problem could be sorted out by putting the BCCI constitution, all rules and any expenditure beyond Rs 25 lakh on the website of the board so that people are aware of the spending. At the end of the year we can put the balance-sheet on the website too so that there is transparency. To show that we want to function in a transparent and not in an arbitrary manner, there are two powers vested with me under the constitution. One, at the AGM, there is a chairman's vote and a casting vote. I do not agree that the chairman should have a vote because the person should not be equated with the association. The casting vote is fine. Therefore I would assure you all that I will not exercise the right of the chairman's vote at the AGM till the constitution is amended.\nPublic perception: Nothing wrong is being done in the BCCI. However, there is a perception in the minds of people that because information does not come out, there is definitely something wrong within the board. We will try to clear that myth and change the perception.\nReviving NCA: The board will look into starting National Cricket Academy (NCA) again, whose activities are not up to the mark. We would see to it that NCA functions round the year so that cricketing talent is developed in this country.\nWomen's cricket: The board would also like to develop women's cricket and will enter into contracts with women cricketers like the men's team.\nMaintaining records: All records of the board which are lying in different places will be made available at the BCCI headquarters so that any member association or a representative of an association can inspect them any time.\nWorld T20: There is a World Cup event (World T20) coming up in March-April 2016 and our priority would be to conduct that event in the best possible manner.\nArbitrary power: There is a right given to the chairman to decide on a dispute with regards to the vote in BCCI. We have seen over hears how minorities are converted into majorities, because of the arbitrary power given to the chairman. I would not exercise that power also. I will put the dispute to the house, and whatever is the majority view, I will decide accordingly. That will be my decision.
