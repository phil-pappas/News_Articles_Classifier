She claims she never read the specific tweet that got everyone buzzing.\n“Just before I was going to click on (the tweet) I thought, you know, why?” Mendoza explained. “Why even give it the attention? I didn’t even open it, so I have actually yet to read it.”\nWe’re not going to run the sexist tweet again, but those of you who haven’t seen it can see that one and more of Bell’s idiotic comments here .\nOn Wednesday, 92.9 The Game in Atlanta suspended Bell for three days. Bell also issued an apology , which Mendoza said she accepts.\n“I accept his apology. To me it was really about the fact that he attacked me because I’m a woman,” she said. “Being able to call these baseball games — yes, I’m a female, but I want it to get to the point where we think about what I’m saying and doing and not so much about the sex that I am.”\nMendoza is the first woman to work as an analyst during an MLB playoff game, and anyone who watched the broadcast can tell you she is incredibly knowledgeable about the game and does a lot of homework. Mendoza sounded natural in the role and did a fantastic job.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.yardbarker.com/", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BB1uPMT.img&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Jessica", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAfe0ut.img&quot;}}", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BBaLHYp.img&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Derek", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAffq9A.img&quot;}},{&quot;csId&quot;:&quot;BB94WtH&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;durationSecs&quot;:55,&quot;playbackUrl&quot;:&quot;http://www.msn.com/en-us/sports/mlb/derek-dorsett-vs-micheal-ferland-oct-7-2015/vi-AAfedkl&quot;,&quot;providerId&quot;:&quot;I3aEuk8U3cs&quot;,&quot;sourceFriendly&quot;:&quot;Sporting", "https://www.youtube.com/iframe_api&quot;}", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BB47AUi.img&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Refs", "http://larrybrownsports.com/baseball/mike-bell-sexist-rant-jessica-mendoza/277008", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAffYNs.img&quot;}}", "http://www.yardbarker.com/rss/msn_prime/127&quot;},{&quot;ns&quot;:&quot;ignore_this_version&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;System.Collections.Generic.List`1", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAfg8uL.img&quot;}},{&quot;csId&quot;:&quot;BB47PG6&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;durationSecs&quot;:131,&quot;playbackUrl&quot;:&quot;http://www.msn.com/en-us/sports/mlb/refs-blow-call-at-end-of-lions-seahawks-game/vi-AAffaEd&quot;,&quot;providerId&quot;:&quot;agF9HLqx2xQ&quot;,&quot;sourceFriendly&quot;:&quot;The", "http://www.yardbarker.com/mlb/articles/jessica_mendoza_responds_to_sexist_rant_from_mike_bell/s1_127_19683094&quot;,&quot;sourceFriendly&quot;:&quot;Larry", "http://larrybrownsports.com/media/radio-host-mike-bell-suspended-jessica-mendoza-rant/277065", "https://www.youtube.com/iframe_api&quot;,&quot;tags&quot;:", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/b?&quot;,&quot;Category&quot;:&quot;baseball_mlb&quot;},&quot;HomePageLink&quot;:&quot;//www.msn.com/en-us&quot;,&quot;GeofenceUseSps&quot;:&quot;false&quot;,&quot;GeofenceEnabled&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;SwfCacheRefreshTime&quot;:86400,&quot;AdConfig&quot;:{&quot;FWFlashProfile&quot;:&quot;188286:MSN_US_AS3_LIVE&quot;,&quot;FWHtml5Profile&quot;:&quot;188286:MSN_HTML5_Live&quot;,&quot;FWNetworkId&quot;:188286,&quot;FWServer&quot;:&quot;http://2df7e.v.fwmrm.net&quot;,&quot;HybridPlayerAdInitT"], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T17:15:14.806+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
