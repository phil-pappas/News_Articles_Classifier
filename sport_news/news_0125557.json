The Lions' breakthrough defensive player had 31/2 tackles for loss against the Buckeyes but still thought his team had played cautiously.\nThe Lions let Ohio State's offensive skill players \"dance like they're talented at doing,\" the defensive end said. They weren't aggressive enough. They played the Buckeyes' game instead of their own in a 38-10 loss.\n\"I don't know what happened,\" Nassib said, \"but it won't happen again.\"\nIn that moment, the fifth-year senior took another leap forward in a season that has generated nationwide acclaim. A first-year starter and former walk-on, Nassib leads the nation in sacks (111/2), tackles for loss (151/2) and forced fumbles (five).\nThose are game-changing statistics in football, as evidenced by the fumble Nassib forced against San Diego State that teammate Austin Johnson took 77 yards for a defensive touchdown. Penn State coach James Franklin said he's never heard of a triple crown like it.\nStill, despite being one of Penn State's most intense players, Nassib also is among its quietest publicly. On Tuesday, Nassib said that he preferred to leave the spotlight for those who \"are better in it.\" He doesn't want to be known as the best football player even in his own family, which includes older brother Ryan, a backup quarterback with the New York Giants.\n\"Definitely, without question, that would be my 7-year-old nephew, Jackson,\" Nassib said.\nBut after the Ohio State game, Nassib stepped out of his comfort zone to become a team spokesman and promise that Penn State would play better this week against Maryland.\nPerhaps it was the last progression of Nassib's remarkable season, both on and off the field. On Friday night at the team's hotel in Columbus, Nassib spoke passionately — and hilariously, Franklin said — about his uphill road to stardom.\nAfter the game, Nassib spoke just as passionately about what he considered a missed opportunity against Ohio State. Nassib's path to this point likely gave him perspective on maximizing opportunities.\n\"You talk about a guy that kept kind of pounding away with a sledgehammer on a stone with very little success,\" Franklin said, \"and kept pounding and kept pounding and kept pounding and kept pounding and started to create some fractures. … It's a great example that, with the right work ethic and the right attitude and then some God given ability and you keep working through that, good things happen.\"\nIt hasn't been easy for Nassib, who still plans to attend medical school someday and who missed the Giants' game Monday night because he was in chemistry class. At times he wondered where football was going, where all those weight-room hours and muscle-building diets were getting him.\nBut teammates noticed Nassib's year-by-year transformation. Offensive tackle Andrew Nelson watched Nassib go from a determined but skinny opponent to a 6-7, 275-pound end who makes him say at practice, \"Oh, no. I've got Carl now.'\"\n\"His high motor and tenacity to get to the ball are unmatched,\" defensive tackle Anthony Zettel said. \"Last year, he added 25 pounds, and that took him to another level. It made him impossible to be blocked. I knew he'd have a killer year and put our team in a position to win.\"\nHe's doing even more now. Aside from becoming a more vocal leader, Nassib is the firebreather of Penn State's defense, one whose primal screams fuel the group. Zettel and Johnson actually provoke Nassib in practice and pre-game, simply to get him riled.\nDefensive line coach Sean Spencer called Nassib \"one of the most intense guys on the planet,\" whose bulging eyes signal when he's ready. Spencer has encouraged Nassib to pursue medical school, with this caveat.\n\"I told him that, if I'm ever in the operating room with him, I'm going to ask for another doctor,\" Spencer said. \"Because I'm nervous about him performing surgery on me.\"\nThree years ago, former Penn State quarterback Matt McGloin won the Burlsworth Trophy, which has been awarded to the nation's top former walk-on since 2010. Nassib would seem a prime candidate for the award this season.\nIn fact, he'd probably be most proud of it.\n\"It would be awesome to be the role model for hard work, especially for walk-ons,\" he said. \"It's hard to see where all this hard work is going when you don't see results for 4-5 years. That would be awesome.\"\nPENN STATE VS.
