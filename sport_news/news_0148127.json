I understand the fans can be little disappointed in me. But hopefully they understand I wasn't thinking that the whole playoff time.\n\"It was one hour in one day. When you're frustrated, you have a lot of things going on in your mind. Hopefully everybody understands that and hopefully after this night everybody can forget that.\"\nRaanta said he didn't quite know how to react when he learned his name was not on the Stanley Cup. The Hawks submit the names for the NHL to put on the Cup. Both Daniel Carcillo and Joakim Nordstrom, who played infrequently during last season, made the Cup while Rannta did not.\n\"It's not there so it's not there,\" Raanta said. \"I know I was part of the team, so that's good enough. What are you going to do about that?\"\n(c)2015 Chicago Tribune\nVisit the Chicago Tribune at www.chicagotribune.com\nDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.\nShare Comment", "external_links": ["http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/hockey/s-1734175&h=Antti+Raanta+says+there%27s+no+hard+feelings+with+Blackhawks", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/hockey/s-1734175&hashtags=ArcaMax", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/hockey/s-1734175"], "published": "2015-10-07T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T01:13:29.861+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
