He had surgery Sept. 2. \nThomas caught 108 passes and 24 touchdowns the last two years in Denver. He signed a five-year, $46 million contract with Jacksonville in free agency in March. \nThe Jaguars (1-3) expect Thomas, when fully healthy, to be a significant part of the passing game. They need a proven playmaker to help take some pressure off second-year receivers Allen Robinson and Allen Hurns. \nAP NFL websites: http://pro32.ap.org and http://twitter.com/AP_NFL \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T16:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T16:49:15.804+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
