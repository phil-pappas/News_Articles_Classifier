He says he had no knowledge of the allegations while he was an assistant at Louisville and also says he knows his father had no knowledge, either. \nKatina Powell wrote a book that alleges former staffer Andre McGee paid her and several other women to party with recruits and players from 2010-2014. \nRichard Pitino was on the staff at Louisville in 2010. He says the allegations were \"very surprising.\" \nRick Pitino has denied knowledge of the activities that Powell alleges in her book. \nAll content copyright ©2015 Daily Reporter, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T00:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T00:26:41.554+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
