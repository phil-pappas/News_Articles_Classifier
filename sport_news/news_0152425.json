THIS WEEK S WINNER IS CLAY-CHALKVILLE AT CENTER POINT. AS FOR TONIGHT S GAMES, WHAT AN UPSET IN LOCAL HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL. ACCORDING TO THE ALABAMA HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL HISTORICAL SOCIETY, ALL TIME AGAINST HOOVER. THAT ONE WIN CAME VIA FORFEIT. SO IT S SPAIN PARK LOOKING FOR THEIR FIRST \"ON-FIELD\" WIN IN SCHOOL HISTORY OVER HOOVER, AND THEY GOT IT TONIGHT. LET S TAKE YOU TO THE MET FOR THIS ONE. NO SCORE IN THE FIRST QUARTER, CROSBY GRAY HITS THE CROSS BAR, BUT IT STILL GOES THROUGH. 3-0 SPAIN PARK. SAME SCORE IN THE SECOND QUARTER. JOSEPH BEATTY S PASS IS PICKED OFF BY PATRICK HALL! BUT HOOVER WOULD TURN IT OVER ON DOWNS ON THE ENSUING DRIVE. ABOUT 30 SECONDS UNTIL HALFTIME, LARRY WOODEN PUNCHES IT IN FOR THE GAME S FIRST TOUCHDOWN. AND SPAIN PARK DEFEATS HOOOVER, 17-0. WHAT AN UPSET. PARKER TAKING ON RAMSAY AT LAWSON FIELD. NOT EXACTLY THE BEST CONDITIONS FOR THE PLAYERS, OR THE FANS. WIND CAN BE TOUGH ON A PONCHO. FIRST QUARTER, NO SCORE, PARKER COMES UP WITH A TURNOVER. DEANTE SIMMS COMES UP WITH THE FUMBLE. ENSUING DRIVE, WE GET OUR FIRST SCORE OF THE GAME, JACOB MILLHOUSE THROWS IT, AND IT SOMEHOW ENDS UP IN TH TOUCHDOWN.
