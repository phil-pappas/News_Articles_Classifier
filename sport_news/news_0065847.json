Navy quarterback Keenan Reynolds ran for a pair of touchdowns and the Midshipmen forced three straight turnovers in the second half for a 31-14 victory Saturday over Tulane.\nReynolds is now just two shy of the NCAA record for rushing touchdowns set by former Wisconsin tailback Montee Ball (77) from 2009-2012.\nNavy (5-1, 3-0 American Athletic Conference) entered the game ranked third nationally with 335.4 yards rushing per game but was held to just 133 as Tulane stacked nine players in the box.\nTulane (2-5, 1-3) got down to Navy’s 2-yard line early in the fourth quarter but a fumble by Tanner Lee was recovered by Navy’s Will Anthony. It was the 13th straight game the Midshipmen forced a turnover.\nLorentez Barbour had another big defensive play for Navy, intercepting Lee at the Tulane 36. That later set up a 1-yard run by Reynolds. \n[X] Click a thumbnail to view the full-size image. Buy Pilot photos here. \n\nLoading...
