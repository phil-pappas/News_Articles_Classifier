The 22-17 loss moved Hononegah to 5-3 on the season, while Harlem improved to 6-2. The game’s biggest play came with 5:16 to play, when Brentan Shaw motored 58 yards to give Harlem a 22-10 lead. Hononegah made a late charge as Dominic Ballano scored from a yard away with 2:12 to play to bring the Indians within five. After a failed onside kick, the Indians came up with a defensive stop. Hononegah started with the ball at its 12-yard line with 1:12 to play and no timeouts. There would be no miracle, as Ballano quickly threw an interception. The Indians got the game off to a terrific start, driving the field for an opening touchdown. Hononegah converted two fourth-downs on the drive before Mike Jacobs punched it in from nine yards away to give the Indians a 7-0 lead. Harlem blocked a Hononegah punt and took over on the Indians 33-yard line, but could get only three points out of the turnover. After the Indians responded with a field goal to re-take a touchdown lead, Harlem scored on a touchdown pass from Trent Willey to Kody Sprung to make it 10-10 at halftime. Harlem took the opening kickoff of the second half and drove 63 yards for the score. Cody Paholski carried the score in from 3 yards out, but missed the PAT. The Indians close their regular season hosting Guilford.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T18:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T01:58:53.880+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
