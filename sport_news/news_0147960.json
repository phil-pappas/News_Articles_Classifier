We had a good pre-season in Dubai which was a much needed one. I am sure if we give our 100 percent we will emerge winners,\" Anelka said.\nThe Chelsea great believes managing the side and playing at the same time is not at all easy but he has taken it up as a challenge to make the city champions and fans thrilled.\n\"Managing the side and playing is not at all easy. If I am playing, I will give my best. If I am at the bench I will do my best as a manager. Sometimes I will play and sometimes I will not play. But this way I will help take my team forward to ultimate winners,\" the marquee player-manager said.\nMumbai face a tough challenge in the first match when they will face rivals FC Pune City in a derby clash on October 5.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T02:18:37.303+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
