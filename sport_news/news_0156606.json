The other two were treated for less-serious injuries at the scene. \n“Some pieces of the building fell down, and that’s how people were injured,” Serrano said. It’s possible some of the people were in an outdoor pool area. \nA gaggle of fire rescue trucks pulled up around noon to the Chateau Beach Residences at 17475 Collins Ave. The building had two gaping holes outside the top-floor boiler room, along the north side of the building, and there appeared to be another one at a service elevator. \nChateau Beach Residences is a 33-story, ultra-luxury condo tower where unit prices average $3 million. It was completed about two months ago. \nArgentine-born developer Manuel Grosskopf, reached on his cell phone, said that three TECO Energy workers had been performing maintenance in the roof-top boiler room when the explosion occurred. \n“We don’t really know what happened,” Grosskopf said. \nThis story will be updated as more information becomes available. \nMiami Herald staff writer Andres Viglucci contributed to this report, as did photographer Marsha Halper.
