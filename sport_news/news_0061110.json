The five healthy scratches are tied with last week for a season high, and they've had at least four healthy scratches each week. However, Wilson went through an intense pregame workout that suggests he is dealing with something despite not being on the injury report.\nTarell Brown (foot) is active. Brandon King is in the lineup after yesterday's promotion. Akiem Hicks will also make his debut, as the Patriots have dressed five defensive tackles for the first time this season.\nWendell is out for the fourth consecutive game, and it's the third straight with the illness. Flowers is out for the fourth consecutive game, and the knee has been on the report four times but it's the first time the shoulder has been on the report.\nJohnson is a healthy scratch for the third time and second consecutive game. Wilson is out for the third time, including two straight healthy scratches. Dobson and Bostic are out for the first time. Thornton is out for the second time.\nDobson is the curious one, but when comparing the last two inactive lists, it looks like Dobson was expensed for Hicks as the extra defensive tackle. That's not great for Dobson, who doesn't have special teams value like Keshawn Martin, but it's at least an attempt at an explanation.\nBrandon LaFell working out with the Patriots\nHere's a really interesting development. Brandon LaFell made the trip with the Patriots and is working out on the field with a few teammates. LaFell is on the PUP list and can play as early as Week 7.\nIt's an eye-opener because Bill Belichick so rarely brings injured players on the road for games. It happened last season with Jerod Mayo and in the past with Kevin Faulk, but those two were well-established and highly-respected captains. More than anything, in my opinion, this says a lot about LaFell's respect in the locker room from his teammates and the coaching staff.\nAs a reminder, here's how the PUP list works. LaFell, Chris Jones and Dane Fletcher can begin practicing at any point from Weeks 7-9. Once they begin practicing, the Patriots have 21 days to either promote them to the active roster or leave them on PUP for the remainder of the season. So they could all return to the active roster as early as Week 7, or even as late as Week 12.\nGood afternoon from AT&T Stadium in Arlington\nHello from AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas, where the Patriots (3-0) and Cowboys (2-2) are about two and a half hours shy of kicking off their Week 5 game in the most gigantic football facility on the planet.\nBecause this is the Patriots' first time here, they've got more players on the field than usual at this point. Rob Gronkowski, who is never on the field until the team emerges for pregame warmups, was still wearing his dress clothes as he took a stroll across the field with Chandler Jones. Julian Edelman, Jimmy Garoppolo, Ryan Wendell and David Andrews are also among the early players working out.\nKeep it here throughout the pregame, and we'll have you covered with everything happening from Texas.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T23:15:38.020+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
