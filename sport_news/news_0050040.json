(SOUNDBITE) (English) MOURINHO SAYING: \"A great month because you play Saturday, then Tuesday, then Saturday West Ham, then Tuesday Stoke in the cup, then Liverpool, then again at Dynamo Kiev. So now is non-stop, every two days, every three days. I think is a very good period to be , because if we are not very well individually and collectively, I think play and play and play again is the best, the best thing that can happen\" our job more difficult, because confidence levels are very important and I really believe that every team that coming now to Stamford Bridge, they don't fear us; they think they can get a result\" STORY: Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho believes their current poor performance wil improve within months, starting with an imminent busy fixture list. The Blues would normally expect a straightforward Premier League home game on Saturday against Aston Villa, who have a poor record at Stamford Bridge. But the champions themselves are on a bad run and in the bottom six of the Premier League, after only one win in their past five league games and one in four at home. \"Every game is a must-win, but we cannot run away from the reality of the table in the Premier League. Obviously, we know that we are not going to be relegated; obviously we know that in a couple of months we will be in a position where we normally have to be. But the reality now, today, tomorrow, before the game starts, is the reality of the numbers and the numbers are very cruel, but objective and we need points,\" Mourinho told a news conference on Friday. He believes, however, that a busy fixture list in the Premier League, Champions League and League Cup could help improve results and confidence. \"A great month because you play Saturday, then Tuesday, then Saturday West Ham, then Tuesday Stoke in the cup, then Liverpool, then again at Dynamo Kiev. So now is non-stop, every two days, every three days. I think is a very good period to be , because if we are not very well individually and collectively, I think play and play and play again is the best, the best thing that can happen.\" Press CTRL+C (Windows), CMD+C (Mac), or long-press the URL below on your mobile device to copy the code http://reut.rs/1ZINtQf", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T18:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T00:14:07.798+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
