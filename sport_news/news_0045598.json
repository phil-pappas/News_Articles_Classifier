It was that North Hunterdon had thrown away 40 minutes of soccer to little purpose. The lethargic Lions didn’t manage a single shot on goal in the first half. \nNorth coach John Simpson didn’t like what he saw. \n“Our energy level was subpar,” he said. “We just didn’t play in the first half. Phillipsburg was getting the majority of the balls in the first half. We were not possessing the ball like we can. We weren’t getting good service into the box and when we did we weren’t getting clean touches on the ball.” \nSimpson was much happier about the second half, even though his team surrendered two goals. \n“I think we played much better,” he said. “I think we were a little unlucky in the second half.” \nNorth did a much better job of attacking the Phillipsburg net in the second half, and caused the Stateliners some heartburn with some balls in the air. \nIndeed, a little aerial smarts from junior Dan Shirey tied the game just after the half. \nTaking a free kick from just over the midfield stripe, Shirey lofted a towering ball perfectly placed to land just in front of the Phillipsburg net. Nobody quite made a decisive play on it, Stateliner keeper Bernie Caffrey was a little stranded, and Lion senior Sean Fluchel darted in to bury the bouncing ball in the goal and tied the game. \n“Dan realized that with the angle of his kick the goalie would be facing right into the sun,” Simpson said. “So that’s why he kicked that way so high in the air.” \nPhillipsburg (7-2-1) answered with two long-range goals to lead 3-1, but the Lions (4-5-2) could have made more, too. \nSenior Matt Martinez, a continued threat on the right side, stung Caffrey’s hands with a rocket from 20 yards out, easily the toughest save Caffrey had to make all day. \nAnd junior Byron Jurkovich, blazing in from the left side and coming right on a cross, scuffed a potential game-tying shot wide with the goal at his mercy; it would almost have been easier to score. \nIt was right after that miss that P’burg’s Alex Stasiulaitis buried a stunning free kick to make it 3-1 Stateliners. \n“We needed better execution in the box,” Simpson said. \nAnd a better first half.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T05:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T02:20:31.192+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
