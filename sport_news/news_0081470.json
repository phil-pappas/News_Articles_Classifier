While Shaw did his best to make the series seem competitive, the numbers say otherwise: Advertisement \nThe average score during the Cardinal's winning streak: Stanford 31.6, UCLA 13.7. \n\"There is a slight sense of confidence, but what we build off more is what we've done this year as a unit as opposed to wins in the past,\" right guard Johnny Caspers said. \nThe Bruins are without three of the top players at their positions in the conference: defensive lineman Eddie Vanderdoes, linebacker Myles Jack and cornerback Fabian Moreau. All three have season-ending injuries. \nThe attrition could be exacting a toll: In their most recent game, the Bruins yielded 38 points and 465 yards to Arizona State. \nThe moveable object that is the UCLA defense now faces an irresistible force, at least of late: Stanford has scored more than 40 points in three consecutive games. \nLinebacker Kevin Anderson will miss his third consecutive game with an undisclosed injury. But Shaw said the Palo Alto High product is expected to return this season. \nOne of the hottest T- shirts on the Stanford campus is titled \"50 Shades of Shaw.\" A series of images are labeled with different expressions (excited, sad, bored, proud, confused, etc.), except that all the images are the same expressionless look -- a play on Shaw's even-keeled demeanor. \n\"My wife gets a great kick out of it,\" he said of the T-shirts. \"I'm loosening up a little bit.\" \nThe Oct. 24 game against Washington will start at 7:30 and be televised by ESPN. It will be Stanford's fourth consecutive night game.
