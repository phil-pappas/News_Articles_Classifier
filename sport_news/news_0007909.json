Lam / Baltimore Sun) Edward Lee Contact Reporter The Baltimore Sun Bye week helped Johns Hopkins football get healthier in time for Friday night's showdown with Dickinson. \nNo team in the Centennial Conference played last week as mandated by a league-wide bye. So every school will be well-rested for the upcoming weekend of games, but Johns Hopkins arguably may have benefited the most from the bye week. \nCoach Jim Margraff said Wednesday morning that the No. 11 Blue Jays (5-0 overall and 4-0 in the Centennial) got much healthier over the weekend, which bodes well for them and maybe not so much for the competition. \n“We take a ton of time off, which I know is different from most people,” he said. “But we seem to be healing up. The injury list that I get, I get briefed daily from our sports medicine department, and our injury list has shrunk considerably. Most of our guys with bumps and bruises a few weeks ago are ready to go. So from that standpoint, things have certainly improved. We had a couple of great days of practice. The first one back was Sunday night, and we almost had to calm our guys down because they were running around all over the place. So from that standpoint, we’ve practiced well this week, and we’re on schedule, and we look at this as being a brand-new season. We accomplished what we wanted to in the first half, and now we’re starting a whole new season for the second half.” \nJohns Hopkins had scored 40 or more points in each of its first five games and had outscored its opponents, 153-36, in the first half thus far. The bye week forced the team to pump the brakes on the offense, but Margraff said he is not worried about the players collecting rust. \n“It’s something we’ve considered, but I think the rest does them well,” he said. “We lay it out for them that if we come back and are lethargic or anything like that, they’ll lose that rest in the future. I think they enjoy a little downtime to get on top of their studies, to have their bodies heal up a little bit. But when it’s time to go back to work, they’re all set to go. It’s something we’ve considered and it’s a concern, but it’s nothing that has ever shown up.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T18:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T22:02:31.845+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
