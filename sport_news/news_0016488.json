Los Angeles (AFP) - United States coach Jurgen Klinsmann named an experienced 23-man squad on Saturday for next week's make-or-break shoot-out against Mexico for a place in the 2017 Confederations Cup.\nKlinsmann, still smarting from his side's elimination on home soil from the Gold Cup in July, is banking on the bulk of the squad which reached the knockout stages of last year's World Cup.\nThe Americans face Mexico in a play-off match at the Pasadena Rose Bowl in California on October 10, with the winner advancing to the Confederations Cup in Russia, an effective test run for the 2018 World Cup. \n\"This roster is obviously full of experience,\" said Klinsmann.\n\"This is about having a group of players who understand exactly now what this is all about. \n\"This is about momentum. This is about high energy. This is about representing my country. This is about belief and a high-level of aggressiveness in a one-off game to beat Mexico and to get to the Confederations Cup. \nView gallery USA goalkeeper Brad Guzan reacts after blocking a shot against Honduras during their CONCACAF Gold C â€¦ \"It's a unique opportunity, and you have to embrace it and give everything you have.\" \nThe US squad contains seven players with 50 or more caps and four - DaMarcus Beasley , Michael Bradley , Clint Dempsey , Tim Howard - that have made more than 100 appearances for the United States. \nSixteen members of the squad were part of the USA squad in Brazil.\nSquad: Goalkeepers: Brad Guzan ( Aston Villa ), Tim Howard ( Everton ), Nick Rimando ( Real Salt Lake ) \nDefenders: Ventura Alvarado (Club America), DaMarcus Beasley ( Houston Dynamo ), Matt Besler ( Sporting Kansas City ), Geoff Cameron ( Stoke City ), Brad Evans ( Seattle Sounders FC ), Fabian Johnson (Borussia Monchengladbach), Michael Orozco (Club Tijuana), Tim Ream (Fulham), Jonathan Spector (Birmingham City) \nMidfielders: Kyle Beckerman (Real Salt Lake), Alejandro Bedoya ( Nantes ), Michael Bradley ( Toronto FC ), Jermaine Jones ( New England Revolution ), Danny Williams (Reading), DeAndre Yedlin (Sunderland), Graham Zusi (Sporting KC)\nForwards: Jozy Altidore (Toronto FC), Clint Dempsey (Seattle Sounders FC), Chris Wondolowski ( San Jose Earthquakes ), Gyasi Zardes ( LA Galaxy )\nSoccer Sports & Recreation Jurgen Klinsmann Mexico Confederations Cup   19337/79545   2486/10000   1214/4772  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T18:29:02.600+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
