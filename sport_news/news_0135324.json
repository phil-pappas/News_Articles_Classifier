The Rebels, who ran the ball nine times on the 11-play drive, hit a big one when Keith Whitley went untouched for 37 yards up the middle for the game’s first score, giving UNLV a 7-0 lead. Nevada marched past midfield but couldn’t get any further and punted. UNLV moved down the field again, using two third-down penalties by the Wolf Pack to sustain the drive before Nevada FS Dameon Baber picked off UNLV’s Blake Decker at the Nevada 3-yard line for the game’s first turnover. The Wolf Pack went three-and-out before Alex Boy nailed a 60-yard punt with no return to swing the field position in Nevada’s favor. \nSecond quarter \nUNLV moved into Wolf Pack territory but opted for a punt on fourth-and-4 from the Wolf Pack 42. Logan Yunker, who began his career at Nevada, pinned the ball on the Wolf Pack 2-yard line. Nevada got just one first down before punting. UNLV puts itself behind the chains with a hold and eventually punted, a 53-yarder by Yunker than pinned Nevada at the 2 again. The Wolf Pack went three-and-out again, avoiding a disaster when James Butler’s fumble on third-and-1 inside the Nevada 10 was recovered by Jarred Gipson. UNLV went three-and-out on the next drive after a sack on third down by Nevada’s Malik Reed. The Wolf Pack got back-to-back first downs on its next series but back-to-back penalties (one that negated a first down; one that was declined) short-circuited the drive. Dekcer was injured on the next drive, but his backup, Kurt Palandech, hit on a long pass and then rushed from 12 yards out for a score. UNLV missed the extra point (it was initially called good but reviewed) and took a 13-0 lead at half. \nThird quarter \nNevada opened the second half with the ball and got on the scoreboard when Brent Zuzo hit a 27-yard field goal to cut the deficit to 13-3. The Wolf Pack changed it up, throwing a lot on first down, and had as many first downs on this drive (five) as it did the entire first half. Nevada then attempted an onside kick, which UNLV recovered to take over on the Wolf Pack 45. But the Nevada defense held firm, forcing a three-and-out. UNLV moved into Nevada territory but ended up punting, a shank by Yunker. The Wolf Pack couldn’t capitalize on the bad punt and went three-and-out. \nFourth quarter \nA UNLV punt opened the fourth quarter. Nevada moved into UNLV territory before Jerico Richardson ran a nice route to turn around the Rebel cornerback and haul in a 22-yard touchdown pass from Tyler Stewart to cut the UNLV lead to 13-10 with 10 minutes, 47 seconds remaining. Nevada forced a three-and-out, with Lenny Jones batting down a pass on third down, and Andrew Celis returned the punt to the Nevada 46. The Wolf Pack’s momentum was killed when Ryan McAleenan grabbed a slightly deflected pass and returned it 52 yards for a touchdown to put UNLV up 20-10. Nevada answered with a quick touchdown – a 1-yard run by Don Jackson – to pull within 20-17 with 4:50 remaining. Nevada forced a three-and-out but the Wolf Pack couldn’t move the ball, with Kameron Richardson dropping a fourth-down pass. UNLV punched in a 45-yard field goal to take a 23-17 lead with 1:53 left. Nevada moved to the UNLV 43 but couldn’t get further, a fourth-down pass to the end zone landing incomplete.
