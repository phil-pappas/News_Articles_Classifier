Saturday, October 24, 2015. comments Tweet A slow-starting Harvard team remained unbeaten by exploding for 35 points in the middle two quarters to take a 42-7 win over Princeton before a chilled crowd of 17,444 at The Stadium yesterday. The win was the 20th in a row for Harvard, the second-longest streak in the country behind Ohio State (21).\nHarvard outgained the Tigers, 647-293, and had career efforts from seniors Scott Hosch (29-of-40 passing, 437 yards, two touchdowns) and Andrew Fischer (10 catches, 190 yards, TD). Senior H-back Ben Braunecker added seven catches for 133 yards, giving the Crimson a pair of 100-yard receivers in the same game for the first time since 2012.\nNo. 15 Harvard (6-0, 3-0 Ivy) was clearly out of synch early. The Crimson fumbled the ball to the Tigers (4-2, 1-2) on the opening kickoff and it set a first-half trend that saw Harvard mishandle four balls, including two lost fumbles. The Harvard offense was also twice stopped on downs in the first half.\n“I thought we were a little sloppy on offense in the first half in terms of ball security. At halftime, we made a few adjustments and the kids came out and played really, really hard,” coach Tim Murphy said. “I think our guys take great pride in ball security. It’s practice. It’s execution. This won’t be a problem for us down the stretch.”\nHarvard managed to grab a 14-7 lead by halftime thanks to its typically steady defensive effort, which limited the vaunted Tigers run attack, which entered averaging 199.6 yards per game, to 7 yards on 11 carries. The Tigers finished with 55.\nHarvard found life in the second quarter, compiling 195 yards and nine first downs. It took a 7-0 lead with 13:07 left when Hosch dove for a 2-yard score. It marked the 30th straight game Harvard has notched a rushing touchdown.\nThe key to the drive was a 41-yard Hosch connection with Fisher, who registered his 100th career catch on the opening play of Harvard’s second possession.\n“The biggest thing was the overall offensive effort and the great play-calling by the coaches,” said Fisher, who missed the previous two games with an upper-body injury. “The line and the (backfield) guys really open up the passing game and make my job easier.”\nPrinceton’s Dre Nelson fumbled the ball back to Harvard on the next series but the offense was stopped on downs. The next time Princeton had possession, interchangeable quarterbacks Chad Kanoff and John Lovett directed an 11-play, 70-yard march before Lovett hit tight end Nick Peabody on a 2-yard rollout TD pass with 6:11 to go in the second. The touchdown represented the first allowed by Harvard in more than 212 minutes, dating to the fourth quarter against Brown in week 2.\nLater, a Tyler Roth punt pinned Harvard at its own 6. The Crimson proved their mettle by marching the full distance in eight plays to regain the lead. Hosch finished the drive by rolling left, spinning and hooking up with Braunecker on a diving 5-yard TD catch 53 seconds before halftime.\nHarvard tacked on another score early in the third quarter on a 2-yard run by senior Paul Stanton, Jr., the first of his two in the game.\nFischer dented the scoreboard by hauling in a 14-yard pass from Hosch for a 28-7 edge with 8:13 remaining in the third. Stanton and Seitu Smith added late rushing scores from 9 and 3 yards, respectively.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share?text=Shake+off+slow+start+to+torment+Tigers", "http://player.mediabong.net/se/56.js?url="], "published": "2015-10-25T13:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T12:24:12.257+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
