(AP) - Zach Parise had a goal and an assist, and the Minnesota Wild remained undefeated by holding off the previously-unbeaten Arizona Coyotes 4-3 Thursday night. The Wild had fresh legs after a four-day layoff between games, jumping on the tired Coyotes for a 3-0 lead. Parise and Thomas Vanek scored less than a minute apart in the first period and Mikko Koivu added a short-handed goal midway through the second. Mikael Granlund also scored in the second. The Coyotes clawed their way back through a string of Minnesota penalties, pulling within 4-3 on Michael Stone's 4-on-4 goal with just over 5 minutes left. Devan Dubnyk closed it out, though, stopping 18 shots for his 100th career win. The Wild are 3-0 for the first time since opening 4-0 in 2008-09. Anthony Duclair scored his fourth goal in two games and Max Domi had his third of the season for Arizona. \n(Copyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
