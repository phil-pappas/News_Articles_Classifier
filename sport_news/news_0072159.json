I won't be going to Vegas for my bye week. I'm not feeling really lucky.\"\nBut Denver's defense bailed him out, and given another chance in overtime, Manning took over. He completed four of four passes for 39 yards on the last drive. Manning finished 26-for-48 for 290 yards and the one TD, a 75-yarder to Emmanuel Sanders .\nThe score came just seconds after the Browns had taken their only lead on Karlos Dansby 's 35-yard interception return for a TD.\nIt was yet another heartbreaker for Cleveland, which had one of the NFL's best teams on the ropes late in regulation before McCown threw a critical pick with 44 seconds left in regulation to cost the Browns as they were driving for a potential game-winning field goal.\nPackers 27, Chargers 20: Green Bay stopped San Diego on fourth-and-goal from the 3 with 15 seconds left and overcame a career day by Philip Rivers to hold off the Chargers. Rivers set career highs with 43 completions, 65 attempts and 503 yards passing. He threw for two touchdowns for the Chargers (2-4). But he needed one more completion. Rookie cornerback Damarious Randall lunged to poke away Rivers' short pass to Danny Woodhead near the front right pylon in the final seconds.\nLions 37, Bears 34 (OT): A win, finally. Matt Prater kicked a 27-yard field goal with 2:29 left in overtime, and Detroit won for the first time this season. Matthew Stafford heaved a 57-yard pass to Calvin Johnson to set up the kick for the Lions (1-5). Johnson finished with six receptions for 166 yards. The Bears (2-4) had chances for a third straight comeback win. Chicago's Robbie Gould kicked a 29-yard field goal as time expired in regulation.\nPanthers 27, Seahawks 23: Cam Newton threw a 26-yard touchdown pass to Greg Olsen with 32 seconds left and Carolina remained unbeaten, rallying for a stunning win over Seattle. Newton led the Panthers (5-0) to touchdowns on their final two possessions after trailing 23-14, the second straight week the Seahawks collapsed in the fourth quarter. Newton found Olsen wide open down the seam as All-Pros Earl Thomas and Richard Sherman looked at each other in confusion. Newton was 12-for-15 for 169 yards in the fourth quarter and threw for 269 yards overall.\nSteelers 25, Cardinals 13: Landry Jones threw two touchdown passes to Martavis Bryant in relief of Michael Vick and Pittsburgh rallied for the win. Vick left in the third quarter with a hamstring injury and Pittsburgh's offense took off when Jones took over. Jones hit Bryant for an 8-yard score to give the Steelers (4-2) the lead. The two hooked up later for an 88-yard strike. Jones completed 8 of 12 passes for 168 yards and the two scores. Bryant caught six passes for 137 yards in his first action of the season.\nVikings 16, Chiefs 10: Despite an erratic performance by Terry Bridgewater, Minnesota's tough defense and rookie wide receiver Stefon Diggs came through over mistake-prone Kansas City. Alex Smith 's 42-yard touchdown pass to Albert Wilson midway through the fourth quarter pulled the Chiefs within three points, but the Vikings (3-2) played well enough early to survive their ragged finish. The Chiefs (1-5) had eight penalties for 95 yards. Diggs had 129 yards on seven catches. Bridgewater threw two interceptions.\n49ers 25, Ravens 20: Colin Kaepernick completed a 76-yard touchdown pass to ex-Ravens star Torrey Smith , Joe Flacco threw two interceptions and San Francisco beat Baltimore to snap a four-game losing streak. Phil Dawson kicked four field goals in the first win since Week 1 for San Francisco (2-4), while Anquan Boldin — a Super Bowl star for the Ravens against the Niners — made a 51-yard reception late that set up Quinton Patton's 21-yard TD catch.\nDolphins 38, Titans 10: Cameron Wake got his first four sacks this season and also forced two fumbles — all in the first half — and Miami won in Dan Campbell 's debut as interim coach. The Dolphins (2-3) came in having lost three straight, costing coach Joe Philbin his job Oct. 5.\nTexans 31, Jaguars 20: Brian Hoyer threw three touchdown passes on third down, two to DeAndre Hopkins , for Houston. The Jaguars (1-5) lost their fourth in a row and raised more questions about coach Gus Bradley 's job security.", "external_links": ["http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/47/57/8813526/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/47/57/8813527/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/47/57/8813526/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/47/57/8813527/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-19T07:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T13:42:51.230+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
