Everything is a little bit new now — new drills, practices. It’s nice, too, for the guys who have been here a long time. They get to start thinking again. It’s refreshing.”\nBefore Larkin’s place on the roster was confirmed, Kronwall had just discarded his gloves in front of his locker and was unlacing his skates.\nAsked about the kid from Waterford Township who played at Michigan last season, Kronwall lit up.\n“He had a really strong camp,” said Kronwall of Larkin, who scored three goals in five exhibition games this season. “He’s going to be a really special player for this organization for years to come. It’s been fun to watch Larkin. He’s going to turn into something very special.”\nKronwall said all the young players attempting to make the roster had already improved the feeling within the club.\nA few reasons to believe in 2015-16 Red Wings “You could see some tendencies last year — you could see there was definitely a lot of raw talent,” Kronwall said of the group in camp led by Larkin and players such as Anthony Mantha, Tyler Bertuzzi and Andreas Athanasiou. “Still, some guys needed some work. But they come in this year ready in a completely different way I think. It’s a process, but they have worked on their game. We now have a handful of young players who could probably be on the team.”\nZetterberg gave Detroit’s scouts credit for unearthing talent such as Larkin and coaches for developing them at Grand Rapids.\nWith the infusion of youth, a solid core group of young but game-hardened players such as Tomas Tatar, Luke Glendening, Brendan Smith, Justin Abdelkader, Gustav Nyquist and Danny DeKeyser, and war horses like Kronwall, Johan Franzen, Jimmy Howard, Kyle Quincey and Pavel Datsyuk, it is no surprise Zetterberg expects the Red Wings to go deep into the postseason despite recent first-round playoff disappointments.\n“Obviously, the frustration comes in with early exits,” Zetterberg said of Detroit’s failure to advance to the second round each of the past two postseasons. “I think that during the regular season, we’ve been playing really good. But going out in the first round of the playoffs? It’s getting tiring.\n“Obviously, you got to make the postseason to go all the way. But just making it is not good enough. We have another chance this year to play good all year and put ourselves in a good playoff push.”\nContact Mike Brudenell: mbrudenell@freepress.com.
