We knew they were going to be a fight. They’re a quality team, and she’s an outstanding player.” \nThe Lady Coyotes never led in the first two games as they struggled to pass Portland’s serves. \n“We’ve struggled with serve-receive most of the year with a team that’s really aggressive,” Stoeckl said. \nHowever, West Creek (21-19) led for most of the third game as senior setter Samantha Nieves served her squad out to a 4-1 lead. \nThe Lady Coyotes extended the advantage to 13-8, then 17-11 and to 19-12 when the Lady Panthers were whistled for double contact. \nHowever, after a sideout, Akins served up six consecutive points to tie the third game at 19. \nWest Creek — which has won the last two District 10-AAA Tournament titles — had a game point, but Portland freshman Marlayna Bullington produced a kill to tie it at 24. \nThen, an Akins kill and a service winner by Bullington ended the match. \nThe Lady Coyotes lose five seniors — Nieves, Sydney Caldwell, Mercedes Nicholson, Azriya Smith and Tawnie Smith Southern. \nPortland (31-7) — which won the District 9-AAA regular-season championship before suffering a five-game loss to Beech in the 9-AAA Tournament final — advanced to face the winner of the Beech-Springfield semifinal match in Tuesday evening’s championship match. With the semifinal win, the Lady Panthers earned a spot in their 13th sectional/substate match and third consecutive sectional. \nWest Creek’s Mercedes Nicholson was named to the All Region Team.
