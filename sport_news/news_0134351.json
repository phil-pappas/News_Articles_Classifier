The project, known as \"Give the Gift of Literacy\" is raising funds to support several Fox Valley area organizations. Specifically, the organizations are the Illinois Youth Center (St. Charles), Lazarus House, Aunt Mary's Storybook, CASA of Kane County, Batavia Apartments and Two Rivers Head Start. Each of these organizations needs books on a regular basis to share with their clients to help them learn and develop reading skills. Participants can purchase any item in the store and a percentage of the purchase will go toward purchasing books for our chosen organizations. Bring the kids out for some activities including a magician, music, storytelling and games. Go to www.stcbreakfastrotary.org to get more information. Download a flier so you know the Book Fair ID# so our group will get credit for your purchases. It's never too soon to start shopping for Christmas gifts. If you are unable to come out to Barnes and Noble on that day, you can order online but remember to use the Book Fair ID 11596350 when you order.
