They had a really good approach today. They laid off some really nice cutters, sliders early in counts and made me come in the zone with more hittable pitches.\n\"They were able to capitalize on two walks there in the third (inning) and scratch for a couple. But the guys picked me up.\"\nArrieta breezed through the first and third innings, but he looked pretty average in the second, fourth and sixth innings. He was lifted after hitting Brandon Moss with 2 outs in the sixth.\n\"He just wasn't the same,\" Maddon said. \"He wasn't as sharp as he normally is. This guy's been on such an incredible roll, it just had to come to an end. But he kept them in check and permitted our bullpen to come in with the lead, which is important.\"\nArrieta exited with the Cubs holding a 5-4 lead.\n\"Even with my struggles tonight, they (offense) continued to add cushion for me and the rest of the guys in the bullpen,\" Arrieta said. \"That was really huge against a postseason-proven team. This team we're playing, they're the best of the best. They've proven that and they deserve to be called that. We know we can play with these guys and we know we can be really good.\"\nArrieta has now thrown 243⅔ innings this season.\n\"Early in the game, I thought he was on his game,\" catcher Miguel Montero said. \"But this guy has thrown a lot of innings already this year, you know? Even though he's in better shape than everybody in the game, he's still human. Hopefully, he gets another start.\"\n• Follow Scot's reports throughout the playoffs @scotgregor.\nRelated Article\nArrieta aiming to stay spectacular for Cubs in Game 3 of NLDS Related Article\nCardinals aren't afraid of Wrigley Related Article\nBaseball over easy, Joe Maddon style Related Article\nNo one too concerned about hitless Bryant, Rizzo Get great articles like this sent to your inbox!
