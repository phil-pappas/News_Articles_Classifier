Anderson School is central to the on-going revitalization of downtown Bothell.\nThe red brick classroom, built in Art Deco style, operated as the area's main junior high from 1931 to 1965, then was used as an overflow school until 1973. The Northshore School District ran it aa a secondary alternative school until the City of Bothell purchased it in 2009, in partnership with McMenamins.\nRenovation of the grounds has been ongoing, in a project of more than $26 million, until the entertainment complex celebrated its grand opening last weekend.\nCalled the Main Lodge, the hotel is not attached to the other buildings but is a short walk away across the compound to the restaurants, bars and swimming pool. The 72 guest rooms are served by the Principal's Office on the third floor, a small space for dispensing drinks and snacks daily from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m.\nEach of the guest rooms is well appointed with bedding and lightning fixtures, similar to McMenamins Gearhart Hotel on the Oregon coast, is decorated with quirky McMenamins art and has full bathroom facilities. Rates begin at $155 per night, plus tax.\nRooms are on three floors, with the upper floors retaining 12-foot ceilings. An elevator at the south entry provides handicap access. Registration is at the hotel front desk, inside the building with the Tavern on the Square restaurant and a short walk from the north entrance of the hotel.\nThe grassy strip east of the hotel won't be there for long, because the city of Bothell has plans to reroute part of Bothell Way onto it. There will remain a European-style boulevard between Bothell Way and the hotel, which is a narrow, driveable lane of brick pavers that has curbside parking and access to McMenamins parking lots.\nMcMenamins Anderson School is at 18603 Bothell Way N.E., Bothell; 425-398-0122; mcmenamins.com .\nStay tuned to this website for more on McMenamins Anderson School.\nEarlier reports about the opening of Anderson School entertainment complex:\nMcMenamins opens Anderson School with huge Bothell party\nMcMenamins North Shore Lagoon blends tiki bar , swimming pool\nAnderson School features Tavern on the Square, Woodshop restaurants\nAnderson School features Patty Murray Room, movie theater\n-- Terry Richard\ntrichard@oregonian.com\n503-221-8222; @trichardpdx", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T13:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T20:53:00.059+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
