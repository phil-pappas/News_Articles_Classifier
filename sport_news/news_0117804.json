More \nThe next time around, it might be the Chicago doing the partying. \nThe young, talented Cubs were expected to improve under new manager Joe Maddon. An optimistic view might have been a record above .500 after three consecutive fifth-place finishes. \nHowever, the Cubs confounded and surprised as they seemingly arrived a year early. They won 97 regular-season games, posting the third-best regular-season record in the majors, then knocked out the Pittsburgh Pirates (the team with the second-best record) in the NL wild-card game before eliminating the St. Louis Cardinals (the team with the best record) in the NL Division Series. \n\"Our young players have learned how to win on a major league level, which matters,\" Maddon said. \"And to get within four games of the World Series in your freshman year is not a bad thing.\" \nMaddon also had a quick talk with his team about what lies ahead. \n\"I mentioned to them how important it is as we move forward and we go to spring training next year (that) we know exactly what we want to do and how we want to do,\" he said. \nThe Cubs brought in talented rookies such as third baseman Kris Bryant, shortstop Addison Russell and left fielder Kyle Schwarber to add to a mix of young and older veterans. \nThey then served notice through the regular season and the postseason that they are a team to be reckoned with for the long run. \nLeft-handed pitcher Jon Lester, who signed a six-year, $155 million free agent contract with Chicago last December, was a veteran influence who watched the kids closely. \n\"These guys have played well beyond their age and well beyond their years in this game, and that's only going to help us in this organization for years to come,\" Lester said.
