Zoe Braun, EV, 24:25 Related Media RIFLE — It is safe to say that both Battle Mountain and Eagle Valley cross-country are coming into regionals next week in Delta with a full head of steam. At the Rifle Invitational, the final tune-up of the regular season, the Devils boys and Huskies girls took team titles on Thursday afternoon. That’s how it’s done, kids. Who needs a shoe? Eagle Valley’s Brandon Sheard started losing his shoe at around the 1-mile mark. At around 1.25 miles, he ditched it completely and still finished third in 17 minutes, 48 seconds. Aiden Branch, with two sneakers firmly attached, took second. This is the sort of thing one can laugh about when it doesn’t happen at regionals. The Devils boys put four into the top 10 and had their five scorers in the top 14. That generally works as far as winning a meet. The Eagle Valley ladies also had a good final rehearsal. “The ladies ran really well today,” Devils coach Melinda Brandt said. “Our ladies fought all the way to the finish and ran with heart. It’s was a great tune-up.” The Hosses were Michaela Mitchell and Branch Eagle Valley’s been having some fun in practice to change it up. The Devils had their color race earlier this week. (There are some fun photos on Facebook.) This week, it’s tapering time. “We want to be at our best next week,” Brandt said. “So we’re going to taper our miles and do some speed work. We’re also going to add some rest days.” Got depth? Look at the results, and it’s pretty clear, Battle Mountain didn’t run a lot of its regulars on Thursday, and the Huskies girls still won. This is depth. There are some really interesting decisions to be made during the next week as to who fills the nine regional spots for the Huskies boys and girls. “We’ve never been this good, both boys and girls,” assistant coach Jonny Stevens said. “Like in 2005, the girls won state, but the boys weren’t that good.” Hey, Coach, you were on that team, and you did win regionals. But the point is granted. Congratulations go out to Conner McCabe who clipped the lettering time of 18:30 with an 18:29 and change. A staggering 29 Huskies have lettered this season.
