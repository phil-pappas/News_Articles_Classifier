The Bengaluru-based Advani demolished his Singaporean opponent, Peter Gilchrist, by 1,168 points. After his return to India, Mirror caught up with Advani to explore the human side of the country's most successful cueist. Read on...\nChasing more titles\nI'm always hungry for titles. It is that drive and passion that pushes me even though I have achieved more than I've ever dreamt I'm capable of. The moment you lose that passion for playing, then maybe it is that point in your life when you need to think about retirement. Success in billiards and snooker has always been very special for me and that adrenaline rush that I experience after winning a title is something that I'm not likely to give up easily.\nHis most special title\nThey say that you always cherish your first love and so the first world title that I won in 2003 in China —the IBSF World Snooker Championship — is the most special for me. That first taste of a world title was something I haven't been able to shake off.\nHis toughest title win\nEvery world title win is tough, but so far in my career, the toughest has been the 2012 World Billiards Limited World Championships in the timed format where I beat Mike Russell after a gruelling battle. Juggling between billiards and snooker coupled with traveling and switching between formats took a toll on me, especially in 2012.\nThings he likes to do\nI like to do the regular things that any man my age would do. I usually catch up with friends who are in town or go for a movie with my family. The things that I miss out on when I'm on tour. Bengaluru has some fantastic pubs and I love hanging out there (even though I don't drink) like Toit and Watson's.\nHis early days\nWhen I began playing competitively at the age of 10, I was rather short in height. I wanted to train under Arvind Savur but he refused at the time because he claimed that I was too short for the sport. Six months later, he approached me and took me under his wing.\nBut I was never taken seriously because of my diminutive stature. People during tournaments used to react to me playing and say, \"Who is this short kid? He won't be able to do anything!\" But that just spurred me to prove them wrong and succeed at the highest level.\nMemories from school\nOne of the highlights of playing during my school days was missing the Annual Day and Sports Day in Frank Anthony Public School (FAPS) as Head Boy. International tournaments and championships always came in the way of birthday celebrations and Diwali holidays from the time I won my first title at the age of 18 even till now. Sometimes I do miss out on a lot of family time and that is something that I have learnt to handle in my playing career so far.\nFamily support\nMy family has always supported my desire to pursue this sport competitively. I remember my mother telling me that as long it didn't affect my grades in school, I was allowed to play and practise. But the biggest influence in my career so far has been my elder brother, Shree. He introduced me to the sport. He used to play at a snooker parlour and took me along one day. I played along with his friends and was hooked to it instantly!\nIt is very easy to lose confidence and go down the path of not believing in yourself as a person based on your performances. But Shree had some really amazing words of advice: \"You are not what your performance is on that day. You are not judged based on your performance.\" This taught me to separate myself as a player on the table from myself as a person away from the table. He always reiterated that the focus should be on the process and not the outcome.\nHis role models\nEver since I was introduced to Savur (his coach), I have always admired his style of play. Before taking up billiards and snooker, I used to play table tennis. I love following sports and I can watch tennis for hours. Being a huge Roger Federer fan, I always admire how he still has the passion to adapt his game and continue to fight for titles.\nHis legacy\nBeing the only player to win world titles in both formats of snooker and billiards is definitely an unexpected part of my legacy. The kind of success that I've experienced is unimaginable and I would love for people to get inspired by my success, not just in terms of taking up cue sports but also being one of India's most successful sportspersons. Up next for me is the the IBSF World Snooker Championship in Egypt next month.\nReturning to UK circuit\nI am still part of the international snooker circuit, but I don't take part in competitions in the UK snooker circuit anymore. It created an imbalance between playing billiards and so I decided to continue playing snooker in other venues across the world. Right now, I am happy with how my career is progressing with a good balance between billiards and snooker.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T12:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T21:06:24.732+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
