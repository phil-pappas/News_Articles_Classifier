Print this article Advertisement RICHLAND — Walla Walla’s Erika Leinweber became the Mid-Columbia Conference individual girls’ cross country champion, leading four teammates who joined her with top 10 finishes as the Blue Devils beat Chiawana and Richland for the team title Thursday at Leslie Grove Park. “I was really proud of the girls today,” Wa-Hi coach Mike Locati said. “This was a great effort on all of their parts. I am really happy for them. “Erika led from start to finish, easily distancing herself from the rest of the runners,” he said. “She was able to cruise and get a solid race under her belt before heading into regionals next week.” Leinweber completed the five-kilometer run in 19 minutes, 41.8 seconds, almost a minute ahead of the runner-up, Chiawana’s Samantha Schmidt. It was Leinweber’s second victory of the season. She also won the Fort Walla Walla race Sept. 24. Teammate Hannah Cabasco followed Leinweber with a fourth-place finish at 21:44.9, and 10 seconds later, Elizabeth Young became the third Blue Devil across the line. They soon welcomed Natalie Hartford in seventh place and Kiana Newcomb ninth. Meanwhile, Wa-Hi’s Alex Iben led the boys with his third-place finish at 16:38.6 in their 5K. He trailed the winner, Richland’s Riley Moore, by less than 30 seconds. “It was pretty much a three-person race from the start with Alex, Riley Moore and (Richland’s) Jonah Sandoval leading the way,” Locati said. “It wasn’t until the last 800 meters when both Richland boys pulled away. Alex really led most of the race as he was teamed up against the other two and probably had to work a little harder than they did. At the end, they pulled away quickly. I’m proud of Alex for going after it.” The Wa-Hi boys finished second as a team, with four runner in the top 10. Grayson Gillin followed Iben in fourth place, Andrew Feistner took sixth and Tyrese Thomas was 10th. “The boys ran very well today,” Locati said. “They competed and knew they would have to rise up because we were missing one of our top 5 runners who was sick. That left a hole, and we just couldn’t close the gap.” The Wa-Hi boys and girls next run the regional championship meet on Oct. 31 in Spokane at the Wandermere Golf Course. “Richland ran very well today, I’ll give them that,” Locati said. “I think we can get them next week, though. We’ll see. It’s a totally different race.”  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T20:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T01:36:49.386+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
