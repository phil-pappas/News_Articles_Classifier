His eyes were fixed down.\n\"At the ground,\" he said, \"And just praying. And it came through.\" \nEli Godfrey's 85-yard kickoff return for a fourth-quarter touchdown helped, also. \nThe Fords and Crusaders played tug of war with the momentum in a cuticle-chewer that left the Fords (5-0) undefeated heading into next week's Inter-Ac opener. \n\"It's a huge win for our program,\" said Toal, who made his second start in place of the injured and out-for-the season senior Kevin Carter. \"The defense really stepped up at the end there. The offense, we had some downs, but the ups prevailed. It was an awesome, awesome game.\" \nToal helped the Fords seize control early with two first-half touchdown passes to senior do-it-all Dox Aitken, who also uncorked a 69-yard punt late in the game. \nToal finished 16 of 24 passing for 202 yards and three touchdowns. \nThe Crusaders (4-2) chopped into Haverford School's 14-3 halftime edge behind King and senior running back Yeedee Thaenrat. \nKing helped erase Judge's 11-point fourth-quarter deficit with a 46-yard touchdown run. He also had a 53-yard scramble to set up Thaenrat's 28-yard touchdown that put Judge ahead, 22-21, with 5 minutes, 22 seconds left. \nOn the ensuing kickoff, Godfrey darted to the right sideline, cut back left, and legged out the touchdown that put the Fords ahead for good. \n\"We have the mentality around here to stay positive, pick every one up, and Eli Godfrey with that return was amazing,\" Toal said. \"He picked the whole team up. We really rallied off that, and then the defense stepped up big time.\" \nKeyveat Postell added an interception and a 65-yard touchdown catch for the Fords, who open league play by hosting Penn Charter next week. \nFor Judge, King finished with 140 passing yards and 146 more on the ground (10.4 per rush). He also threw for a touchdown. \nThaenrat added 111 rushing yards on 22 carries and two touchdowns. Tom Penko had an interception and Jacob Roman had two sacks. \nHaverford School 7 7 7 8 - 29 \nFather Judge 3 0 7 12 - 22 \nH: Dox Aitken 12 pass from Tommy Toal (kick good) \nFJ: FG Joe Gallagher 38 \nH: Aitken 33 pass from Toal (kick good) \nFJ: Yeedee Thaenrat 10 run (Gallagher kick) \nH: Keyveat Postell 65 pass from Toal (kick good) \nFJ: King 46 run (pass failed) \nFJ: Thaenrat 28 run (pass failed) \nH: Godfrey 85 kickoff return (Postell pass from Toal)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T06:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T06:43:36.087+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
