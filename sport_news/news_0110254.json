The Chicago Bulls were confident enough in the relationship between Jimmy Butler and Derrick Rose to sign Butler to a max contract over the summer, and Rose insists the team has nothing to worry about.\nAdChoices During the postseason last year, reports surfaced indicating Rose became frustrated that Butler was trying to run the offense during a loss to the Cleveland Cavaliers. In a recent interview with CSNChicago.com , Rose reiterated that those rumblings were baseless.\n“It’s false,” he said emphatically. “It’s so false. It’s so false. I love Jimmy as a player and as a person for one. Just knowing what he came from, what he had to go through just to get in this position. He still has a bright future. I’m lucky in my career to be playing with a player where the sky’s the limit. Like who knows how good he can be and who knows how good the team can be. It’s very exciting not only be playing with this team but with a guy like that.”\nRose may have gotten upset with Butler during that particular game, but that doesn’t mean couples counseling is needed. Butler essentially said the same thing as Rose back in July, though he wasn’t quite as convincing .\nIf Rose can remain healthy (and this report should give Bulls fans optimism ), he and Butler should make up the best backcourt in the Eastern Conference.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.yardbarker.com/", "http://larrybrownsports.com/basketball/jimmy-butler-derrick-rose-dont-think-we-have-issues/266162", "http://larrybrownsports.com/basketball/derrick-rose-looking-like-his-old-self/270107", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "http://www.csnchicago.com/bulls/bulls-rose-reported-rift-butler-its-so-false"], "published": "2015-10-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T04:16:58.768+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
