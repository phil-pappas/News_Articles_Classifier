TEAM LINE-UPS \nChorley: Ashton, Ross, Jarvis, Teague, Charnock (Doyle 55), Cottrell, Hine, Winter (Carver 66), Dean, Bond, Stephenson. \nSubs not used: Guy, Lynch, Dodd. \nHednesford Town: Ransome, Digie, Regan, Bailey, T Williams, Trainer, S Williams, Thorley, Obeng, (Perry 82), Thomas, Todd (Modest 82). \nSubs not used: Ennis, James, Patterson. \nAttendance: 1,057 \nMuch like the first period, the start to the second-half was a quiet one. \nAlthough Hednesford had plenty of the ball, they only had one effort from Ben Bailey, which went well over the bar, to show for their efforts. The Pitmen finally took the lead in the 63rd minute. \nAs the ball broke in the box for Andy Todd, he managed to pick out Adam Thomas who headed home despite the best efforts of the Chorley goalkeeper Ashton. \nHednesford looked comfortable with their lead, although they had a let-off with 15 minutes to go. \nRansome punched an initial cross clear, only for the ball back in to find Hine who headed into the side netting. \nIt was just a temporary reprieve though, as the home side drew level after 78 minutes in somewhat controversial circumstances. \nAs a ball was pumped into the box, Ransome claimed it before he appeared to be being fouled. \nHowever, with no whistle forthcoming and the goalkeeper having lost the ball, Marcus Carver was left with an unguarded net to fire home. \nDisaster then struck for Town three minutes later as a Stephenson cross into the box found an unmarked Hine, who was left with a simple header into the net.
