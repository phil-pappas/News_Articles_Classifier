VA. (PRWEB) October 02, 2015\nWoodcraft is offering a new line of acrylic pen turning blanks in 16 Fan Favorite sports color combinations so woodturners can support their favorite teams with one-of-a-kind pens in team colors.\n“Woodcraft Fan Favorites are actually the brainchild of Woodcraft president Jody Garrett,” product development manager Ben Bice said. “He asked us to pursue the Fan Favorite theme to provide pen turners with a new and exciting blank and a way to show off their favorite sports teams’ colors.”\nSelecting color combinations was the first step in the Fan Favorite project. “It took many hours of research,” Bice said, “to identify color combinations that would cover multiple sports teams. My first step was to look at NCAA Big 10, Big 12, Conference USA standings to determine the top ranked colleges. Next I developed a list of color combinations and then cross-referenced the list with college, high school, and professional sports teams to determine which combinations covered the most teams.”\nColor combinations selected include: Carolina blue and white; Red, black and white; Red, white and cream; Orange and white; Purple, gray, light gray and black; Yellow and green; Blue and white; Black and old gold; Gold, white and purple; Maroon and orange; Maize and blue; Gold, navy blue, metallic gold, and black; Maroon and cool gray; Red and gold; Blue and gold; and White, garnet, gold and black. Although these color combinations are not standard, Bice said the manufacturer was willing to accommodate Woodcraft, so it was not long before Fan Favorites were in the warehouse.\nDespite the colors’ connection to athletic teams, Bice thinks the color combinations will also attract turners outside the sports world: “I believe the Fan Favorite colors will be popular simply because they make attractive pens.”\nFans that are not woodturners (or friends of woodturners) but would like to own a Fan Favorite pen may contact the closest Woodcraft store for information about pen turning classes and check out a pen turning video at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsdzoUvJShU .\nFor more information about these products or Woodcraft, please contact the store nearest you , visit http://www.woodcraft.com or call (800) 535-4482.
