One and two would be for the first and second halves and three would be for overtime, which may be needed. They just don’t come any better than this. Each team is ranked No. 1 in North Carolina in at least one statewide poll. They are both in the top 10 in the state in just about every poll we know anything about. The coaches, Richard Bailey at Scotland and Chris Metzger at Pinecrest, have established reputations for excellence. Before the season started, we listed the top five players in the Cape Fear region at eight different positions. Of the 40 players on our lists, nine will be in this game tonight and six of those nine ranked No. 1 or No. 2 at their position. No, it doesn’t get any better than this one. \nOFFENSE \nTwo figures from mythology best describe these offenses. Scotland is the Kraken, the giant sea beast that could swallow ships whole. Pinecrest is the Hydra, a multi-headed serpent who grew two new heads when you cut off one. Scotland features running back Zamir White, whom Metzger has repeatedly called the best running back in the nation. White has rushed for 1,331 yards, an average of 190.1 per game. Scotland has 29 rushing touchdowns and White has 26 of them. The Scots are not devoid of passing. Dashaun Ferguson, back from an early injury, has thrown for 514 yards and six touchdowns in four games. The versatile Pinecrest attack is led by quarterback Christian Ledbetter, who is a bona fide run-pass threat with 788 yards and eight touchdowns through the air and 525 yards and 16 TDs on the ground. But he’s got company in the backfield: Malyk Justice has 376 yards and Jaren Lubrano has 304. What’s impressive is Justice averages 10.2 yards per carry and Lubrano 7.4. \n\nDEFENSE \nIt’s hard to measure how good these two defenses are because both teams have had multiple blowouts, which means the first unit likely wasn’t around when the game ended. Scotland linebacker Jonathan Smith is headed to North Carolina when he graduates. Pinecrest linebacker Carson Maples is one of the region’s best at the position, and is is Scotland lineman Mazani Stubbs. Both units appear to have some questions in the secondary, so look for Scotland and Pinecrest to test the passing lanes for chances to get big gains. \n\nWHAT’S GOING TO HAPPEN? \nBoth offenses are so strong it’s going to come down to one team outscoring the other. I don’t think the defenses will be able to contain either unit, but they could certainly play a big role with a turnover converted into points. In a game where everyone’s this good, you have to look at intangibles for clues to who will win. History, and home field, certainly favor Scotland, if only by a fraction. That’s where I’m leaning. \nEARL'S PICK", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T21:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T19:33:39.173+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
