The 22-year-old Norris said the growth was deemed malignant but he was told by a doctor that he could wait until the end of the season to have it removed. \n\"I was given the option to shut my year down & get it removed immediately,\" Norris posted. \"However, seeing another doctor that determined I could wait until the end of the season reassured my gut feeling. Just keep playing.\" \nNorris went 3-2 with a 3.75 ERA this year in 13 starts for Toronto and Detroit. He was traded to the Tigers in late July as the most highly regarded prospect in the deal that sent David Price to the Blue Jays. \nAl Avila, who was promoted to replace Dave Dombrowski as Detroit's general manager shortly after the trade deadline, said in a text message that the Tigers knew about Norris' condition when they acquired him and expect him to recover in full. \n\"It's time to get this thing out,\" Norris said in his social media post. \"So please keep me in your thoughts & prayers as I undergo surgery & come out 100% cancer free!\" \nNorris said he found out about the growth a few months ago, after he was optioned to Triple-A. He said it was alarming to hear the growth was malignant, but he kept playing. \n\"Baseball kept me sane,\" he said. \"Regardless of the results on the field, I forgot about it when I was between the lines. ... I was just trying to get the heck out of AAA. ... I was revived with an opportunity, a blessing from God, with the Tigers.\" \nNorris made eight starts down the stretch for the Tigers. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T01:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T02:06:51.109+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
