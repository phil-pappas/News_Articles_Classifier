The Bulldogs certainly didn’t play like a team that was looking ahead to the rest of its season.\nBehind 155 yards rushing from Trevor Firgau and 88 yards on the ground from Peter DiMeglio, Metuchen blitzed Keansburg en route to a 33-0 victory Saturday afternoon.\nQuarterback Jake Lebovits went 5 of 6 passing for 80 yards and four different players scored touchdowns for Metuchen (4-1).\n“We’ll take it any way we can, whether it’s throwing or running, so we just so happened to get it going on the ground here today. Jake did a nice job throwing the ball around when we needed him to,” Ulmer said. “We have a number of kids that can score and lead us, so it’s a big plus to have that.”\nMetuchen led 20-0 at the half and forced Keansburg to punt on the opening possession in the second half before DiMeglio raced 60 yards untouched for a touchdown, effectively putting the game out of reach for good. The Bulldogs only ran six plays on offense in the second half, but scored on two of them, the second of which came on Firgau’s two-yard plunge with 4:30 left to cap the scoring.\n“We knew Keansburg was going to be hungry. They got a win last week, so we just wanted to be ready to go,” Firgau said. “The line did a great job blocking, we only had one turnover, which is one more than we hoped for, but this was a good team win.”\nKeansburg (1-4) had run only five offensive plays when it found itself down 14-0 in the first quarter, after Lebovits ran in from three yards out and Firgau raced home from eight yards away to put Metuchen up by two scores.\nAfter a Titans punt, Firgau fumbled at the Keansburg 15, but the Bulldogs’ defense came up with its second of four stops on fourth down to keep the hosts off the board.\n“We knew we were playing pretty well in the first half and defensively we made a couple of big plays, so we just wanted to work on the little things and close the game out, which we were able to do,” Firgau said.\nJust one week after earning its first win of the season, Keansburg was bottled up by the Metuchen defense, gaining only 171 yards on offense, led by Arkeyel Brown’s 49 yards on the ground on 17 carries. Ian Terry went 2 of 2 passing for 51 yards, but managed only 16 yards on 12 rushing attempts.\nMETUCHEN (4-1) 14-6-7-6-33\nKEANSBURG (1-4) 0-0-0-0-0\nSCORING SUMMARY\nM – Lebovits 3 run (Maloney kick)\nM – Firgau 8 run (Maloney kick)\nM – Miller 5 run (kick failed)\nM – DiMeglio 60 run (Maloney kick)\nM – Firgau 2 run (kick blocked)\nINDIVIDUAL STATISTICS\nPassing – M: Lebovits 5-6-80; K: Terry 2-2-51.\nRushing – M: Firgau 17-155, DiMeglio 8-88, Lebovits 2-8, Miller 2-7; K: Brown 17-49, Terry 12-16, Crespo 1-14, Vital 3-minus 1, Osterbye 1-minus 2.\nReceiving – M: Serieux 2-39, DiMeglio 2-21, Miller 1-20; K: Brown 1-44, Osterbye 1-7.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T23:31:25.770+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
