His fourth victory of the season and his first career win at Charlotte came in the opening race of the second round of the Chase. Logano beat reigning Sprint Cup champion Kevin Harvick to the finish line by 0.704 seconds in a race originally schedule for Saturday night, but postponed by rain. Martin Truex, Jr. finished third.
