(Gene J. Puskar / AP) Call staff reports Penn State running back Saquon Barkley learning through injury, coach James Franklin says \nPenn State running back Saquon Barkley will take \"limited\" reps in practice this week, and his return will be determined by team doctors, coach James Franklin said. \nBarkley, the freshman from Whitehall High, has missed the past 21/2 games because of an injury he sustained in the first half against San Diego State. \nFranklin said that Barkley was not cleared to play against Indiana late last week and that the same process would be used to determine his status for Saturday's game at Ohio State. \nDespite playing in just three games, Barkley is Penn State's leading rusher with 373 yards. He is averaging 8.9 yards per carry, which would rank fourth nationally if Barkley had played the minimum number of games. \nFranklin said that Barkley has dealt with the injury well from a mental aspect. \n\"How he handles this is an opportunity for growth for Saquon,\" Franklin said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T20:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T21:12:35.845+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
