(AP) -- Calvin Ridley caught an 81-yard touchdown pass from Jake Coker and No. 8 Alabama rode its swarming defense to a 27-14 win over Arkansas on Saturday night. \nStymied by early mistakes, the Crimson Tide (5-1, 2-1 Southeastern Conference) scored 24 points over the final 17 minutes after trailing at halftime. The Razorbacks (2-4, 1-2) couldn't do more than flirt with the upset despite two Alabama interceptions and a pair of missed field goals. \nThe Tide held Alex Collins to 26 rushing yards and added three sacks and an interception. \nCoker was twice intercepted on deep balls in the first half but finished 24 of 33 for 262 yards with a pair of touchdowns. Derrick Henry ran for 95 yards on 27 carries and set an Alabama record late with a touchdown in his 11th consecutive game. \nReggie Ragland had a sack, two quarterback hurries and a forced fumble.
