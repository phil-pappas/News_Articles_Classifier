Good ol’ American boys John Carlson, T.J. Oshie and Matt Niskanen put up a combined five points on the night. Of course, it wouldn’t be a Caps win without a contribution from the captain, who completed a dazzling passing sequence with his second goal of the season in the third period. The first period began with flair as the Caps took a 9-5 advantage on shots and a 1-0 advantage on the scorenboard. After the refs whistled the Hawks for interference at the 8:31 mark, the Caps’ power play unit went to work and had a flash of the brilliance of last year’s number one PP unit. Evgeny Kuznetsov celebrated his 100th NHL game by dishing a slick assist — his first — to T.J Oshie, giving the U.S. Olympic hero his first goal as a Cap. The period ended with an Ovechkin roughing penalty that Braden Holtby weathered easily, thanks in part to some sure-handed clears from the penalty kill. The second period saw the Hawks fight back with a flurry of shots, all swiped away by Holtby. Carlson rewarded Holtby’s effort with a spectacular spinning one-timer from the blue line to give the Caps a two-goal lead and run his point total to four, the most on the team so far. A Niskanen slip in the defensive circle at the 5:30 mark created momentary drama for the Caps by giving the Blackhawks an uncontested breakaway on Holtby, but to no avail. Holtby held the sheet clear through two. Heading into the third up 2-0, the Caps held the “most dangerous lead in hockey,” but a quick centering pass by Marcus Johansson allowed Niskanen to snap off a quick wrister from the high slot to give the Caps a little breathing room and a three-goal lead. Less than a minute later, however, Viktor Svedbrerg of the Hawks took advantage of a failed clear and unlucky bounce off Oshie’s leg to snap the puck past Holtby from between the circles. Not to be outshone by the Stars and Stripes, Ovechkin and Evgeny Kuznetsov drove down the ice in a two-on-one breakaway — a slick Ovi pass, a Kuzy shot, and an Ovi rebound led to the captain’s second goal of the season past Blackhawks Goalie Scott Darling at 14:18 in the third. (No worries, Oshie was credited with the secondary assist to keep the Russians in check.) The largest area of concern for the night was the defensive pairing of Chorney and Orlov. Chorney, appearing in his first game for the Caps, was frequently lagging behind Chicago’s formidable skaters. Meanwhile, Orlov appeared to be searching for his timing and footing for most of the night; still recovering his form after a season that saw him on the sideline with a broken wrist.
