JOPLIN, Mo. — A day after grabbing their first win of the season, Pittsburg State volleyball fell in straight sets — 28-26, 25-18 and 25-23— to rival Missouri Southern State Saturday afternoon at the Robert Ellis Young Gymnasium. “We should have capitalized the few times the momentum was in our favor,” Pitt State head coach Jenny Mueller said. “We just couldn’t get into a rhythm, and that’s important to us. That’s something we are going to continue to work on.” The Gorillas couldn’t get in the groove offensively, failing to put on any serious scoring run in the three sets against the Lions. After a back-and-forth opening-set win — MSSU, who wasn’t particularly sharp on their side of the floor either — was able to put together one significant run to get out in front of Pitt State over the final two sets on their way to the win. “We had highs, we had lows,” Mueller said. “This one was going to be a game of who had fewer mistakes. We made mistakes when we couldn’t afford to have them and they put them away whenever they needed to. The shift in momentum definitely went their direction several times.” In the three sets against the Lions, PSU had one service run which lasted longer than three points. MSSU finished the win with three. The Gorillas’ record falls to 1-16 this season, while the Lions move to 2-16. Lana DaSilva led Pitt State in kills with eight, while Lauren Regier finished with seven. Taylor Unke wasn’t far behind with six kills, with Maggie Highberger, Taylor Wright and Lexi Fulghum each contributing three. Hayley Hansford finished with a team-high 16 assists. PSU’s Taylyn Schwartz was in double digits in assists with 11. Defensively, Ashlen Schwartz had the Gorilla-high 16 digs, while Wright had 11 digs to finish in double digits. Unke led Pitt State in blocks with four total, three assists and a solo. Missouri Southern was led in kills by Bridgette Jaeger, who came away with 13. Payton Graves was one behind to finish the match with 12. Leading the Lions in assists was Abby Finder with 35. MSSU had five players finish with five or more digs. Graves had six blocks to lead Southern. The first set between the MIAA rivals was a dogfight with the lead changing hands seemingly every sideout. The Gorillas found themselves in front up 17-15 before the Lions battled back to tie it up at 23-all. The teams traded serves to a tie before the Lions earned a sideout to go up 27-26 and followed it up with a kill form Callie Whetstone to end the first set. Page 2 of 2 - The Lions used a four-point service run from Whetstone midway through the second set to pull out in front 13-8, stealing the momentum on the way to the win. Jager had a pair of kills in the run for MSSU. The final set had the same feel as the first with both teams trading points and serves. It remained close, with the score tied at 22-all before MSSU finished off the match with three straight points UP NEXT Pitt State volleyball is back in action at 7 p.m. Friday when they face Nebraska-Kearney at John Lance Arena.
