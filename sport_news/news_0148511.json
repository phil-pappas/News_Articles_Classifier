J.T. Miller had two assists and Henrik Lundqvist made 32 saves. \nChicago, which is aiming to be the first team in 18 years to win back-to-back Stanley Cups, got goals from Artemi Panarin and Teuvo Teravainen. \nMontreal goaltender Carey Price made 36 saves to help the Canadiens win 3-1 at Toronto, tarnishing Mike Babcock's coaching debut with the Maple Leafs. \nCanadiens captain Max Pacioretty scored on Montreal's first shot a few minutes in for the first goal of the NHL season. Alex Galchenyuk broke a tie midway through the third period, and Pacioretty added an empty-netter. \nJames van Riemsdyk had a power-play goal for Toronto early in the second period. \nBabcock made the first coach's challenge in NHL history and was successful in overturning a goal, with the review finding Tomas Plekanec interfered with the goaltender. \nSan Jose captain Joe Pavelski had a goal and two assists, and Joonas Donskoi scored in his NHL debut as the Sharks won 5-1 at Los Angeles. \nJoe Thornton and Brent Burns had a goal and an assist apiece, and Tomas Hertl also scored as the Sharks thoroughly dominated their California rivals in coach Peter DeBoer's successful debut. \nNick Shore scored the sole goal for the Kings less than two minutes in. \nVancouver's Daniel Sedin had a goal and two assists to lead the Canucks to a 5-1 victory at Calgary. \nJannik Hansen, Brandon Sutter, Alex Burrows and Henrik Sedin also scored for the Canucks in a rematch of last season's Western Conference quarterfinals. The Flames won that series but then lost to Anaheim. \nJiri Hudler scored for Calgary.
