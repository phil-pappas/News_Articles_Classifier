It was supposed to be an evening of payback, running it up, settling scores, breaking records.\nDidn’t Tom Brady Sr. say something about his boy leading the Patriots into the end zone on every possession?\nLook, we all get the motivation: The Pats blame the Indianapolis Colts for Deflategate, and Deflategate, we can all agree, was a drain on everyone from the Krafts, to the Bradys (Tom Sr., Tom Jr.) to everyone who has ever paid his or her way into Gillette Stadium. (Even if I do maintain that the NFL weirdly loves all the attention it got from Deflategate.)\nBut the inconvenient truth here is that the hated Colts went into last night’s game with a 3-2 record. And 3-2 teams playing at home don’t often roll over just because the other team has a swell storyline going.\nAnd that’s just as well, because the Pats’ 34-27 victory over the Colts last night at Lucas Oil Stadium was real. As opposed to the fantasy scores that were being tossed around all last week — with 73-0, I believe, getting plenty of air time.\nBesides, the Colts played such a dumb game last night that that, all by itself, was its own form of revenge for the Pats.\nMore about that in a moment.\nBut first, was this victory as big for Brady and the Patriots as everyone said it was going to be? For Brady was rather subdued after the game, offering little more than it was “a good win,” and noting that the Colts “played pretty good.”\nTwo different reporters said they observed Brady saving footballs as souvenirs after Patriots touchdowns. Nope, he said. Didn’t save them.\n“I thought our execution was off at times,” he said. “But it was a good win, glad we won, it’s always good to win on the road.”\nAnd so on.\nWhat were you expecting, a Jose Bautista bat flip?\nAnd LeGarrette Blount, asked if there had been some kind of win-it-for-Brady element to this one, shot that question away.\n“We treated it like any other game,” he said.\nThe Colts led 21-20 at halftime, and Indy fans were eating it up. This may have been a “revenge” game for the Pats, but out here it was looked at as opportunity to extend some payback to that pack of lyin’ cheaters from New England.\nBrady took the Pats right down the field on the first drive of the third quarter, including a 25-yard pass to Scott Chandler for a first down at the Indy 44. Five plays later, he hit Rob Gronkowski for 25 yards and a touchdown.\nThis is when the Colts got stupid. And this was when Pats fans were able to savor a brand of revenge that had nothing to do with the score.\nAnd it all began with a fake punt, the Colts lining up with wideout Griff Whalen as a sort of make-pretend center, and with safety Colt Anderson lining up as a make-pretend quarterback. The rest of the Colts were off somewhere to the right, and hoping, one assumes, that the Patriots would jump offside.\nAnyway, the make-pretend center snapped the ball to the make-pretend quarterback, who was dropped for a very real loss of 1.\n“Our special teams worked really hard,” said Pats coach Bill Belichick. “We expected this to be a gadget game, an onside kick, some kind of fake, a fake punt, a fake field goal. Their punter ran a sweep against Tennessee a couple of weeks ago.”\nYou’ve heard of the butt fumble? This play was similarly hilarious, but with one major difference: It was a play that somebody in the employ of the Indianapolis Colts designed .\nMaybe it was Colts coach Chuck Pagano who designed that mess of a play. Maybe it was special teams coordinator Tom McMahon. It may well have been an intern, or a peanut vendor.\nThe Pats would pad their lead in the fourth quarter, making it 34-21. It was a handy enough lead, but not a blowout. The Colts, in fact, made it a one-possession game with just over a minute remaining when Luck connected with Whalen for an 18-yard touchdown. (Adam Vinatieri’s point-after was blocked.)\nSo, no, no blowout. But the punt — the fake punt, the whatever it was — made up for everything.\nPut it all together and you have what may be the most lopsided close game in football history.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T19:25:26.365+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
