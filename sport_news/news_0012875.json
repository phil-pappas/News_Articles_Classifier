The third-year power forward spent the better part of two months with the Canadian national team as it vied for an automatic Olympic berth in the FIBA Americas Championships. Although he went off for 34 points, on 11-for-13 shooting, to go with 13 rebounds in the semifinals, Canada suffered a shocking and controversial loss to Venezuela. Despite the bitterly disappointing end to the tournament, and a minor knee injury Olynyk dealt with early in the event, he said the experience provided him a big assist heading into the preseason. “You gain a lot,” he said prior to Friday’s exhibition finale against the Philadelphia 76ers at Verizon Wireless Arena in Manchester, N.H. “You are playing quality games against high-level competition for a month-and-a-half straight. You’re practicing, getting better, a month before you start to get ready for the [NBA] season. That is nothing but beneficial.” There has been concern voiced around the league in the past with how summer tournaments — like the Olympics — have taken a toll on NBA players, but the 24-year-old Olynyk said he feels as strong as ever entering a season. “Definitely, it’s been a benefit coming in,” he said. “You will have to see how it affects you later on in the season as it gets longer. Right now, I feel ready to go, in game shape, and on point.” After getting a rest night off Thursday night against the New York Knicks at TD Garden, Olynyk was expected to get an extended run on Friday — especially because it is his only game action for a full week. While his teammates open the regular season Wednesday night at TD Garden against the 76ers, Olynyk will be serving a one-game suspension due to his arm tug of Kevin Love — which led to a dislocated shoulder that kept Love out of the remainder of the playoffs — in Game Four of last season’s first-round series against the Cleveland Cavaliers. “It’s unfortunate,” he said. “You never want to get suspended. You always want to play. But you have to deal with whatever comes your way. It’s part of dealing with adversity. But I’ll be ready for the next game.” When Olynyk opens his season next Friday night at TD Garden against the Toronto Raptors, it will likely be as part of a second unit where a major role of his will be to space the floor for high-scoring guard Isaiah Thomas. Celtics coach Brad Stevens has repeatedly stated he is looking for lineup combinations that complement each other, and one of the requirements for the second unit alongside Thomas is to be what he called being at least “a credible threat” as a shooter to lure defenders away from the paint. Page 2 of 2 - “When we’ve got guys out there like that on the floor it definitely opens it up for me,” Thomas said before Friday’s game. “The defense has to pick their poison with what it wants to stop. The more space that I have, the better I am.” While Olynyk has shown he has the range, his willingness to take the shot consistently is key to him being that “credible threat” from behind the arc. “The whole idea of a shooting [power forward] with Isaiah is pretty obvious, pretty sound,” Stevens said. “The biggest thing is that they have to be worthy of being defended. It’s not necessarily all the shots that go in. It’s how you open up opportunities for everybody else. I don’t think it puts a whole lot of pressure on to be a 50 percent 3-point shooter by any means.” Olynyk shot the 3-pointer a shade on either side of 35 percent in both of his NBA seasons, but upped his attempts from 114 in 70 games as a rookie to 175 in 64 games last year. “It’s big,” Olynyk acknowledged. “Isaiah is a real talented player. He can get to the basket, create for himself, and definitely create for others. The more room you give him to operate, the better it’s going to be for everybody.” By Scott Souza", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T04:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T04:40:00.802+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
