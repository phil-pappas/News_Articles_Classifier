Now I want to thank each and everyone of you for your prayers, text, calls etc. The outpouring of your love is an example of just how great God is. I can't thank you enough. Nick has A PCL tear along with 2 other ligaments. It's not nearly as bad as it could've been. They'll wait for swelling to go down to decide when to have surgery. Possibly 2wks. Nick is in good spirits. Moma on the other hand is trying to hold it together. This right here, along with a few other things just helps put things into perspective. I do not doubt God or His plans. As matter of fact, I know I'm on the right track. We are going to increase our time with God and continue watching him work. Stay tuned. \" \nChubb entered tied with Herschel Walker for the school record with 13 straight games with more than 100 yards rushing.
