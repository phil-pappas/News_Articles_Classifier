It was a penalty, we looked at it at half time on the laptop,\" BBC Sport quotes him as saying. \n\"Jamie Vardy is never shy to step up. We knew how fast they would come out in the second half. We countered them and got the goal when we did so it helped us settle the match,\" Schlupp said. \nThe result fires Leicester up to fourth place in the table. \nCredit: Sports Mole", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T18:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T18:13:13.116+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
