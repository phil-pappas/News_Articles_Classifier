Paul Ryan said he is still not planning on running for House Speaker, despite growing pressure for him to do so. Republicans far and wide appeared to signal Sunday that they would support Rep. Paul Ryan as their next House Speaker, even as the Wisconsin representative repeatedly dismissed his interest in the thankless and stressful job.\nConservatives, establishment types and Tea Partiers alike all expressed hope that Ryan could unify the party’s multiple warring factions within Congress’ lower chamber as the GOP continued to deal with the calamitous fall-out from House Majority Leader Rep. Kevin McCarthy’s (R-Calif.) sudden and unexpected withdrawal from the race for the speakership.\n“Paul Ryan is a friend, I meet with him every single week, we talk about policy, I think he’d be a great messenger,” Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), the founder of the Tea Party-aligned House Freedom Caucus, said on “Fox News Sunday.”\n“He’ll come in front of our group and talk to us, I think our group would be favorable towards him, but we’re not there yet,” added Jordan, whose caucus was widely credited with the chaos that ultimately toppled current House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) and crushed McCarthy’s frontrunner candidacy for the position.\nThe Freedom Caucus’ 42 hardline conservative members have mostly thrown their support behind Rep. Dan Webster (R-Fla.), but Jordan’s comments could indicate that the group may be open to Ryan, who many within the party believe could bridge the gaps that currently divide the GOP.\nManuel Balce Ceneta/AP House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) withdrew from the race for the House speakership Thursday suddenly and unexpectedly. “Our position right now is we know Daniel Webster, we know he’s done this in Florida, where he took a model that was so controlled, top-down, centralized kind of power model, he diffused that kind of power and empowered the members,” Jordan said. “But I think whoever the next Speaker is, Paul Ryan or anyone else, has to go to that kind of model.”\nMeanwhile, a slew of establishment Republicans doubled down on their belief that Ryan was the man for the job.\n\"If my friend Paul Ryan decides to run, I think ultimately he'll win,\" Rep. Tom Cole (R-Okla.) said on CNN's \"State of the Union.\" \"I have enormous confidence that this is the right man for the right moment.”\nThat opinion was echoed by the party’s two 2016 frontrunners as well.\nManuel Balce Ceneta/AP Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) said his Freedom Caucus would “look favorably” on Rep. Paul Ryan if he runs for speaker, but for now the group is sticking with its endorsement of Florida’s Rep. Daniel Webster. “Paul Ryan's a good man. I know him very little, but I think he's a very good person,” said Donald Trump, who added that he would be “okay” with the Wisconsin rep as Speaker.\n“I think he's somebody that probably that could get good support. I think he's a very nice person. I think he doesn't want it very badly, but you never know,” the real estate magnate said on CBS’ “Face the Nation.”\nRetired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, for his part, said he thought Ryan “would do a fine job” as Speaker.\n“I like Paul Ryan,” the GOP presidential candidate said on CBS’s “Face the Nation.” “I hope that all people who are being considered will have an opportunity to put forth their philosophy on leadership and that the members can make an intelligent decision.”\nEvan Vucci/AP Outgoing House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) was ultimately unable to bridge gaps in the House between establishment Republicans and hardline conservatives. All that support, however, could be moot if Ryan — who has repeatedly said he’s not interested in the job — doesn’t decide to run.\nSources close to Ryan have indicated that he doesn’t want the thankless position, which would take him away from his preferred focus — economic policy — and push him into the heart of the ideological battles within the GOP between the establishment and the stubborn Freedom Caucus, which has proven nearly impossible to manage in the past several years.\n\"Chairman Ryan appreciates the support he's getting from his colleagues but is still not running for Speaker,\" Ryan spokesman Brendan Buck said in a statement over the weekend.\nNevertheless, a growing number of Republican leaders have begun pressuring the former vice presidential candidate to run for the job, believing he’s the only one who can unite the party.\nIf Ryan doesn’t run, there’s no obvious candidate who would be able to garner the support needed to win. Webster has little support outside of the Freedom Caucus, as does Utah Rep. Jason Chaffetz, who is also running.\nThe latest leadership struggle stems from the shocking withdrawal from the speakership race on Thursday of McCarthy, who had been the heavy favorite to win.\nWith Cameron Joseph", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T22:00:33.046+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
