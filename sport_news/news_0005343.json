We take collective responsibility. But there is a need going forward that we can't keep giving goals away. We've given teams goals even in the games we've drawn and won. \n\"Of course, you don't want to see any of your players criticised. They give their all and have had incredible success. I said to the players afterwards, during the success everyone was saying how good you are. Take no notice. It's the same when things are going this way. \nBoruc missed the game at Manchester City last weekend - another 5-1 defeat - after picking up an injury in the warm-up and Howe conceded that he may have not been completely fit heading into this match. \n\"He's strong mentally and resolute when it comes to errors,\" Howe added. \n\"He's seen it and done it. There's a need for the team to eradicate those errors and our goalkeepers rediscover their form. \n\"He's declared himself fit late in the week. Maybe he's not 100 per cent, but he's kicking with both legs no problem. How much that hampered his performance, I don't know.\" \nFor Spurs, this win means they remain unbeaten in the Barclays Premier League since the opening weekend of the season as Mauricio Pochettino's side move to within five points of leaders Manchester City. \nSeeing Kane return to form was a highlight for the Argentinian - especially after his decision to rest his main striker in Thursday night's defeat to Anderlecht. \n\"I'm very pleased for Harry,\" he said. \n\"I never had any doubts about him, but it was very important hat-trick for him. It's important for him to learn from that period. It happens in football. I'm happy because he'll become a much better player after such a tough period. \n\"He will score a lot of goals, but football is not about just scoring. He works very hard for the team. We're all happy. It's normal. He's tired now because he's run a lot, but the team, the squad, was very happy for him in the changing room. \n\"We needed that victory and the three points to push us back up the table.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T20:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T20:25:07.322+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
