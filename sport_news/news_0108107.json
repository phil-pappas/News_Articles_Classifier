It has featured 94 games, including 10 South Jersey Group 1 tournament games. \nThe teams played just five times before 1933, when Paulsboro scored its first victory by a 2-0 score. They've played every season since then. \n\"It's one of the great things about high school football,\" Woodbury coach Al Mailahn said. \"Everybody knows everybody. Everybody has cross-over relatives on the other side.\" \nIn the modern era, Paulsboro and Woodbury have been two of the stronger small-school programs in South Jersey. \nSince the creation of the state tournament in 1974, Paulsboro has won 17 South Jersey Group 1 titles and Woodbury has won six. \nSince the Colonial Conference split to two divisions in 2001, either Paulsboro or Woodbury has won every Patriot Division crown. \n\"It's extra special to me because I played in it,\" said Paulsboro coach Glenn Howard, who played for the Red Raiders in the mid-1970s. \"It's just a great rivalry, always good clean games.\" \nIn the old days, the schools were much larger, drawing students from greater geographic areas. \n\"When we played them in 1945, both teams were undefeated and we were ranked No. 1 and No. 2 in South Jersey in Group 3,\" the 86-year-old Sanderson said. \"We beat them pretty good (21-6).\" \nThe 81-year-old Colgan said both teams were undefeated again in 1951. \n\"We used to play them the next-to-last game of the season, just before our Thanksgiving Game (against Glassboro),\" said Colgan, a center and defensive lineman. \"We weren't very big. Our line must have averaged 150 pounds, if that. \n\"Woodbury was always 'The Game' for us. It was like Army-Navy. \n\"They had beaten us six years in a row. We were so excited when we beat them (14-0). It's a game I'll never forget.\" The 100-Year Rivalry \n- Paulsboro and Woodbury will mark 100 years of football competition at Saturday's noon game at Woodbury. \n- The series: Paulsboro has a 53-41-3 edge. \n- The playoffs: The teams have met 10 times in the South Jersey Group 1 tournament, with Paulsboro winning six. \n- The finals: The teams have met four times in the South Jersey Group 1 title game, with Woodbury winning three. \n- The picture show: Woodbury graduate Vincent Allen will show his documentary about the rivalry in the school's auditorium on Friday at 8 p.m. \n- The festivities: All football and cheerleading alumni are invited to a pancake breakfast in the cafeteria from 9-11 a.m. Saturday and will be honored at halftime of the game.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T03:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T03:58:09.552+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
