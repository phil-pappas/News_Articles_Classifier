Stingy defense. An unflappable bullpen.\nEven a little help from replay.\n“Just battling,” first baseman Eric Hosmer said. “That’s what this team does so well.”\nThe Royals rallied from a three-run deficit Friday, getting a go-ahead single from Ben Zobrist in the seventh inning, and then watched Wade Davis and the bullpen make it stand in a 5-4 victory that brought back memories of their nip-and-tuck postseason of a year ago.\nThe Royals knotted the game at 4-4 off Scott Kazmir and relievers Oliver Perez and Josh Fields in the sixth. Kansas City took the lead in the seventh when Alcides Escobar led off with a triple against Will Harris (0-1) and Zobrist followed with his single through the left side.\nKelvin Herrera (1-0) and Ryan Madson each tossed a scoreless inning for the Royals, and Davis came on to close it — though the real drama was only beginning.\nDavis walked Preston Tucker with one out, and speedy Carlos Gomez came in as a pinch-runner. Davis snapped a throw to Hosmer at first, and he neatly snagged it on one hop as Gomez made a dive back to the bag. Gomez initially was ruled safe, but the call was overturned upon review.\n“That play that Hos made on the pickoff, I don’t know if there’s a lot of first basemen that can make that play,” Royals manager Ned Yost said. “It was tremendous.”\nJose Altuve then grounded out to end it, giving Davis the save.\nIt was a crucial victory considering what awaits Kansas City in Game 3 on Sunday: Astros ace Dallas Keuchel, who was 15-0 at home this season. Edinson Volquez will start for Kansas City.\n“We were in position to win that game. Their bullpen did a very good job of shutting us down,” Astros manager A.J. Hinch said. “We’ve got some work to do to win this series. It’s going to be a good series. These are two really good teams.”\nTwo starters acquired with October in mind, Kazmir and Royals counterpart Johnny Cueto, pitched mostly to a stalemate Friday, which meant the outcome hinged on the bullpens. Kansas City’s relief corps was simply better, preserving the first win by a home team this postseason.\n“They compete,” said Salvador Perez, who homered for the Royals. “Pretty good stuff.” \nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google Whatsapp Email Filed under houston astros ,  kansas city royals ,  mlb playoffs", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T00:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T06:48:18.437+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
