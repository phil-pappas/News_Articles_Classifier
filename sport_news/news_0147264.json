(Courtesy of Kingwood Christian Yearbook staff) By Gary Estwick | gestwick@al.com View/Post Comments \nKingwood Christian’s Kerry Thompson wants to transform his senior season of heroics into Division I scholarship offers. \nSo far, he’s halfway to his college football goal, which is not enough to seal the biggest tackle of his prep career - and his recruiting game clock is ticking. \nWhile Auburn is at the top of the list of schools in contact with Thompson, the six foot, four inch, 205 lbs., defensive end has yet to secure the ultimate prize from the Tigers, or any Division I program. His lone offer so far is from I-AA Jacksonville State. \nSo Thompson keeps working. He keeps disrupting Friday night offenses like a bully in shoulder pads. Last week against Cornerstone Christian , he forced three fumbles, recovered a fumble, intercepted a pass and added a sack. His Lions also won their first game of the season – 14-6. And Thompson earned AL.com’s Player of the Week honors in the Birmingham area. \n“Somehow, I don’t know how he does it, but he’s always around the football,” said his head coach, Sheldon Ward. “He has really put a spark on our defense.” \nAs a senior, Ward said Thompson appears to be quicker off the ball (from reviewing his junior season on film at Helena ). He’s also determined on defense, as his motor keeps rolling, and rolling. \nThompson said his pass rush is improved. Also his ability to drop in coverage, hand placement which allows him to get off blocks, and arm extension. Oh, and he’s finding the ball even faster. So, pretty much everything. \nNo wonder this season, Thompson has collected 31 tackles, six sacks, six forced fumbles, four fumble recoveries, two interceptions and one score. On offense, as a receiver/tight end, he’s caught eight passes for 213 yards and three scores. Kerry Thompson has scored this season on offense and defense for the Lions. (Diane Cunningham) \nYet colleges have flirted, but not popped the big question (scholarship offer). Or, even asked him on a date (recruiting trip). So Thompson keeps playing. \n“It’s been OK,” he said of his recruiting experience. “Kind of a roller coaster. Very up and downish. With everything coming together, my coaches and family, tell me to keep my head up, keeping him inspired, knowing I’ll eventually get one.” \nIn an online poll , AL.com readers picked Thompson, who earned 3,546 votes. He finished ahead of Shades Valley quarterback Claude Newell (2,850), a late entry. Oak Grove running back Jerrod Keyes finished third (1,830). Also receiving votes were McAdory's Jay Jones (328), Gardendale's Zach Cupps (251) and Tyrelle Pigrome (118) of Clay-Chalkville. \nMore good news: Ward said Thompson’s play has also increased the amount of recruiting eyes on teammates like Corey Robinson (DE/TE), Chase Inabinett (FB/LB) and Wyatt Baker (RB/DE).", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T22:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T00:16:10.847+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
