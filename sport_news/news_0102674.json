An illegal procedure penalty against the Hurricanes negated the run, the Generals defense tightened up forcing Amherst to turn the ball over on downs. \nPittsfield immediately capitalized on their opponent's missed opportunity, going on an 8-play, 63 yard drive — all on the ground — capped by Rodriguez's 18-yard score. \n\"That was a momentum swing that hurt us,\" said Amherst coach David Thompson. \"But we had some big plays and I'm proud of how the team stepped up.\" \nRodriguez's final touchdown early in fourth quarter put the game out of reach, as the Generals improved to 6-1. The Hurricanes remained winless at 0-7. \nDespite the impressive victory, Pittsfield coach Brian Jezewski wasn't pleased his squad let Amherst stay close. \n\"We had a little letdown in the second quarter and we stress you have to play tough for all 44 minutes,\" he said. \"We knew going into the game from seeing film they have some very good athletes.\" Advertisement \nThe most talented wearing the maroon and white jersey was quarterback Will Budington, who threw for 217 yards and three touchdowns. \nConstantly pressured by the Pittsfield defensive line, Budington was often in scramble mode, finding receivers open for big gains. \nNevertheless, the Generals defense held the junior signal caller to 8 of 15 and an interception to end the Hurricanes' last drive. \nGio Figueroa had two sacks, with Shane Cronin, Sam Fick and Austin Houghtaling stuffing Amherst's running game that netted only 20 yards. \nTyrell Boire at cornerback had a big night, breaking up several pass plays and picking off Budington in the end zone with seconds to play. \nPittsfield wraps up its regular season next Friday night at Wahconah Park, hosting the Wahconah Warriors. \n——— \nAmherst 0 12 0 6 — 18 \nPittsfield 16 6 8 20 — 50 \nFirst Quarter \nP — Kolbe Muzzy 22 run (Edwin Rodriguez run). \nP — E.
