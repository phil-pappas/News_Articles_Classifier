It seems like just yesterday when he was among the ascending, next-generation stars — it feels like just yesterday because it practically was.\nJust two seasons ago, he guided his team to the NFC Championship game. Just three seasons back, he took his squad to the brink of a Super Bowl victory. He was spoken of in the same breath as other young up-and-comers such as Russell Wilson, Andrew Luck and the mercurial Robert Griffin III.\nAs steep and rapid as Kaepernick’s decline has been, he hasn’t fallen as far or fast as has RG3. But at this rate, Kaepernick’s career is approaching terminal velocity.\nSo why would the Madman suggest you start someone trending so decidedly downward? You don’t bet against a streak, right?\nActually, that is exactly right, you don’t bet against a streak. And the streak the Madman will follow this week is the one the decrepit Ravens pass defense is riding.\nIn standard scoring leagues, Baltimore has given up 26 or more fantasy points to opposing QBs in three of its past four games — the lone exception being Mike Vick.\nThe Ravens were picked apart by Derek Carr. Yeah, but the Raiders do have some young talent on offense. They were ravaged by Andy Dalton. OK, the Bengals are a very good team. Then they were humiliated by Josh McCown. Josh McCown. I’m officially out of excuses.\nKaepernick doesn’t have to throw for 400-plus yards (like McCown) to be a good fantasy option. If you’re in a bind because of bye weeks or injury, he is a good streaming option.\nIn daily league formats, the outlook is even better. He is priced at the QB minimum on DraftKings ($5,000) — or the same as his backup, Blaine Gabbert. So you can get a starting QB going against a sieve of a pass defense for the same price as Bryce Petty — the Jets third-stringer.\nKaepernick’s $7,300 price tag at FanDuel makes him less of a bargain, but with what likely will be a low usage rate, investing in some roster coverage isn’t a bad idea.\nBesides, sometimes, when you wish on a falling star, dreams can come true.\nBig weeks Blake Bortles QB, Jaguars \nvs. Texans (DraftKings $5,200/FanDuel $7,300) \nHas been sneakily consistent over past four games (nine TDs, two INTs). Has two solid WRs to target in Allen Robinson and Allen Hurns, and he faces Houston D that puts no pressure on QBs.\nRonnie Hillman Photo: Getty Images Ronnie Hillman RB, Broncos \nat Browns (DK $4,600/FD $6,600) \nHillman has done little to impress, but that’s still more than backfield mate C.J. Anderson. Browns have given up more rushing yards than any team.\nTorrey Smith WR, 49ers \nvs. Ravens (DK $4,200/FD $6,200) \nJust like we expect a good game from Kaepernick, we anticipate residual fantasy numbers to flow toward Smith. Ravens have given up second-most fantasy points to WRs. Might get extra looks against his former team.\nJordan Cameron TE, Dolphins \nat Titans (DK $3,000/FD $5,400) \nComing off a bye and coaching change, the Dolphins face a Tennessee team that has yielded some big games to TEs. Cheap price makes him valuable in daily formats.\nSmall weaks Josh McCown QB, Browns \nvs. Broncos (DK $5,400/FD $7,000) \nExpect his magical three-game ride to come to a sudden halt against a stiff Broncos defense. Denver is weaker defending against the ground attack, so more Duke Johnson Jr., less McCown.\nJonathan Stewart Photo: Getty Images Jonathan Stewart RB, Panthers \nat Seahawks (DK $3,900/FD $6,100) \nHas yet to top 62 yards in a game or reach the end zone — and that’s having faced three of the nine worst run defenses. Seattle has yielded the fewest fantasy points to opposing RBs.\nKeenan Allen WR, Chargers \nat Packers (DK $7,600/FD $7,700) \nThe Packers rank fourth in fewest fantasy points allowed to opposing WRs. Allen gets plenty of looks, but overall stats are warped by huge games against the Lions and Vikings.\nJimmy Graham TE, Seahawks \nvs. Panthers (DK $5,400/FD $6,300) \nSomeone needs to tell the Seahawks this guy plays for them. Might not make much difference this week, against a Carolina team that has given up the fewest fantasy points to TEs, and gets back All-Pro LB Luke Kuechly.\nTweet of the week With move from Weeden to Cassel at QB, level of stink of #Cowboys passing game goes from sewer slop to dead animal carcass.\n— Drew Loftis (@NYPost_Loftis) October 13, 2015 \n\n  baltimore ravens ,  blake bortles ,  colin kaepernick ,  fantasy football ,  jimmy graham ,  josh mccown ,  san francisco 49ers", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T18:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T23:46:35.670+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
