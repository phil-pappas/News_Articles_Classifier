(AP) -- Kentucky forward Derek Willis miss two weeks after injuring a finger on his left hand during Saturday's practice, the second injury to a Wildcats reserve this week.\nOn Tuesday, junior guard Dominique Hawkins underwent surgery for a broken right hand that will sideline him for four weeks. Though Willis should return in time for Kentucky's exhibition games next month, coach John Calipari expressed disappointment that the 6-foot-9 junior will miss Sunday's televised open practice.\nSaid Calipari in a statement, ''he deserved to show his stuff tomorrow. He's made great strides and will bounce back from this.''\nWillis played in 19 games last season and has 33 career appearances with the Wildcats. He is expected to add depth to a Kentucky frontcourt that lost four players to the NBA draft.\nSports & Recreation Basketball Kentucky John Calipari   790/79545   127/5681  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T08:29:18.542+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
