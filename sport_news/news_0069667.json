I knew when I scored, they weren’t leaving and I became emotional and started crying.” \nFor Amber Lee, who gave the Falcons a 1-0 lead with 11:12 left in the first half, not scoring in the second overtime wasn’t an option because of what happened last season against the Bulldogs. \n“We were in this exact same situation last year against this same team and we lost in penalty kicks,” Lee said. “That is in the back of your mind, that you don’t want that to happen again. It gives you extra drive, and if you are tired, you have to kick it up another notch and keep going. \n“We felt like we dominated the whole game, but we got a couple of unlucky calls and they scored at the end, but we knew we if we played with heart we would be able to grind it out.” \nThe Falcons took a 2-0 lead in the first half when standout freshman Taylor Davis scored on a breakaway goal. Fairfield Union just missed on several other scoring opportunities in the second half and in the first overtime. \nBischof wasn’t pleased that Athens scored two goals to tie it up late in the game, but he knew the Bulldogs wouldn’t quit because of the history between the two teams. \n“When your backs are against the wall, you are going to give that fight, and I think we took it a little bit for granted,” Bischof said. “(Athens) moved a player up late in the game, and we kind of got ball-watching a little bit, and they were fighting for everything they have. \n“We told the girls it will take all heart to win it because we knew Athens would keep punching. We just needed to suck it up and find a way to win, and that’s what we did.” \nThe Falcons dodged a huge bullet and they can breathe a sigh of relief. \n“Being a No. 1 seed, you have a bull's-eye on your back and you are going to get everyone’s best shot,” Lee said. “We have to be ready to go, and if we get the chance, we have to put teams away early like we should have (Thursday night).” \ntwilson@lancastereaglegazette.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T06:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T23:52:12.184+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
