The Mets and Cubs play Game 2 of the NLCS in New York with the first pitch set for 8:07 p.m. The Royals and Blue Jays play Game 3 of the ALCS in Toronto on Monday night. Here's a look at what's happening (all times EDT) :\n3:35 p.m.\nThe Blue Jays just took the field for their off-day workout after returning home from Kansas City down 2-0. After a blowing a late lead in a tough 6-3 loss in Game 2, the team knows the challenge ahead: All but three of the previous 25 teams to take a 2-0 lead in the best-of-seven era have won the series.\nToronto trailed 2-0 in the best-of-five ALDS and rallied to beat Texas.\n\"I'm not going to say it's a position we're comfortable being in, but we've been there and we're going to try to go out and win games,\" center fielder Kevin Pillar said. \"That's what we do.\"\n___\n3:15 p.m.\nThe Yankees may be gone from the postseason, but Alex Rodriguez is sticking around.\nFox said Sunday it has hired A-Rod as a guest analyst for the remainder of the ALCS and the World Series. He is to start Monday, joining pregame and postgame shows that include Pete Rose, Frank Thomas and Raul Ibanez.\nRodriguez returned to the majors this year after serving a season-long suspension for violations of baseball's drug agreement and labor contract.\nHe hit .250 with 33 homers and 86 RBIs, raising his home runs total to 687, behind only Barry Bonds (762), Hank Aaron (755) and Babe Ruth (714).\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
