Replays showed the ball never touched the ground as Barnidge scooped the pigskin up with his legs and back into the safety of his arms.\nIncredible completion: Cleveland Browns tight end Gary Barnidge grabs the ball. Photo: AP\nThe unbelievable catch gave Cleveland a 18-yard touchdown and a 22-21 fourth quarter lead.\nAdvertisement It remains a mystery how the ball did not hit the turf; a catch for the ages.\nUtterly ridiculous skills. But it still doesn't make our top five catches in recent memory.\n5) Marty Booker vs Detroit Lions 2008\nBooker pulled off a 30-yard catch despite a defender getting in his way and blocking him off the ball. His view is somewhat impeded, but he manages to put his left hand out and take a clean one-handed grab while getting a flag in the process.\nIt is regarded as one of the most underrated catches of all time.\n4) Randy Moss vs New York Jets 2010\nThe Patriots receiver made a seriously good overhead catch courtesy of a pinpoint-accurate Tom Brady throw.\nThe 34-yard touchdown was impressive for the fact it just beat the hands of Jets cornerback Darrelle Revis and landed perfectly into Moss' outstretched right hand.\n3) David Tyree vs New England Patriots 2008\nThe 'helmet catch' as it's referred to, occurred in the final two minutes of the 2008 Superbowl.\nThe most amazing thing about the entire play was how New York Giants' quarterback Eli Manning managed to avoid being tackled by three Patriots defensive players.\nAfter breaking free, Manning sets his sights down field and finds Tyree, who makes a sensational catch by more or less pulling the ball into his helmet as he falls to the ground.\nFrom there the Giants scored a Superbowl-winning touchdown.\n2) Antonio Freeman vs Vikings 2000\nOn a rainy Monday night in overtime with the scores locked at 20-all, Brett Favre threw in a pass for Freeman.\nFreeman slipped, the ball hit him in the back, before he somehow managed to have the awareness to pick the ball up before it hit the turf.\nOther players nearby were convinced it was a non-catch, but Freeman streaked away to score the match-winning touchdown.\n1) Odell Beckham Jr vs Dallas Cowboys 2014\nIn his first NFL season, Beckham catches the ball so far over his head it almost defies belief for one of the all-time great touchdowns.\nWords do not do it justice.", "external_links": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/mvpW-ZSeqhE?rel=0"], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T21:04:48.906+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
