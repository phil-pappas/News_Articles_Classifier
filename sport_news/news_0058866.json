The Philadelphia Eagles are maybe the most disappointing team in the NFL right now, and a failing offense has everything to do with the team’s 1-3 record. Center Jason Kelce is embarrassed by the poor showing and knows the offensive line is a huge reason for it.\nAdChoices The Eagles allowed Sam Bradford to be sacked five times in Week 4 and once again the running game never got on track with 87 total yards on the ground. For the season, Bradford has endured 12 sacks on the season and Philadelphia’s offense ranks No. 27 in the league in total offense.\n“Bottom line is our defense plays good enough, our offense struggles to move the ball when we don’t do our job, and that’s been the thing from the f—— beginning of the season,” Kelce said, via CSNPhilly.com.\nMost people understand NFL games are won and lost in the trenches, and so it’s not surprising the Eagles are having issues up front.\n“That’s been exactly what stalled out our offense from the beginning all the way through these first four games. And right now we don’t run the ball when we need to, we don’t pass block when we need to, and it’s a disgrace right now.”\nChip Kelly, as many are aware, ditched Pro Bowl left guard Evan Mathis before the season, and he’s been content to run a unit out onto the field that has no chance to compete with the league’s top defenses. It shows, and every weekend we’re witnessing the fruits of his decision.\nKelly believes his system is the key to success, rather than the players. To this point, his system is failing because he doesn’t have the players up front to succeed.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.yardbarker.com/", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "http://www.csnphilly.com/football-philadelphia-eagles/jason-kelce-eagles-o-line-disgrace-right-now"], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T22:02:02.414+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
