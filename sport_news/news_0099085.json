Whitecwhite@mdjonline.com The Marietta Daily Journal October 19, 2015 11:35 PM | 1073 views | 0 | 5 | | Harrison’s Gabby Malafronte, left, will try to help the Lady Hoyas return to the state finals in Columbus for the fourth straight season. slideshow Only four of Cobb County’s eight teams survived the first round of the GHSA state fastpitch softball playoffs.Kennesaw Mountain, Harrison, South Cobb and Allatoona each won their respective series with two game sweeps and are now prepared for their second round series, which begin Wednesday.The matchups don’t get any easier for the first round survivors, who are once again expecting to be challenged.Region 4 No. 3 seed Kennesaw Mountain (19-13) took care of business last week in taking down Region 1 runner-up Tift County 4-0 and 4-1. The Lady Mustangs will be much closer to home this week, but on the road again, as they take on Region 5 champion Woodstock (24-5).“It’s nice to not have to travel as far,” Kennesaw Mountain coach Lisa Chapman said. “It will be like playing at home with the Cobb and Cherokee county schools so close. We knew Tift would be a tough opponent, and to come out of there with two wins was really exciting for our seniors.”Pitcher Amber Johns and third baseman Kelli McGrail, both seniors, have had postseason success at Kennesaw Mountain. The Lady Mustangs made the state finals in 2012 and ’13, but failed to reach the second round last season, so getting back to Columbus is a priority for them.“Those girls understand what it’s like to get there,” Chapman said. “We’re all excited to be back in this position and playing for a chance to get back to Columbus.”Woodstock is a familiar foe to Kennesaw Mountain. The Lady Wolverines beat the Lady Mustangs 6-4 during fall break this season.“I think we were both missing a couple of players during that game because of break,” Chapman said. “They’re a solid team based on the scouting reports we’ve picked up. We didn’t throw Amber that game, so that might give us an advantage.”Another team facing a familiar foe is Harrison (23-5). The Region 4 champion Lady Hoyas took down Region 1 No. 4 Colquitt County 4-0 and 11-0 last week. Harrison, which hosts Region 5 No. 3 Cherokee (26-5) in the second round, lost 4-3 to the Lady Warriors during Allatoona’s Buccaneer Bash.“I think playing a team before helps,” Harrison coach Matt Jones said. “You get to know their tendencies on offense and defense and what they like to do. They gave us our first loss of the season. We didn’t play well that game, but having seen them we can better game plan for them. We know they have slappers with speed and they like to run.”Harrison hopes to make its fourth straight trip the elite eight behind pitchers Emily Kachel and Pierce Fox and seniors Summer Swanson, Abby Broome and Mikenzie Vaughn.“With all the speed Cherokee has, we’re going to have to play good defense,” Jones said. “Cherokee puts pressure on you by putting the ball in play, and we’re going to have make the plays that need to be made.”South Cobb (23-11), the Region 3 runner-up, accomplished its goal of making the second round following blowout 10-0 and 13-1 wins over Region 2 No. 3 Rockdale County. A much stiffer test waits for seniors Tyonna Williams, Emily Cargle, Dezirae Rhodes, Terilyn Harris and Mariah Byk as the Lady Eagles, who have never made the state finals, visit Region 7 champion North Gwinnett (30-2) this week.Region 5 No. 3 Allatoona outlasted Region 8 runner-up Loganville in the first round, beating the Lady Red Devils 8-2 and 15-3. The Lady Buccaneers (16-10) will need that kind of production again this week at Region 4 champion Woodland-Stockbridge (27-3).“We were clicking pretty good last week with our bats and I feel like we’re peaking at the right time,” Allatoona coach Troy Pirkle said. “If we can hit, we can play with anybody. There’s a lot of experience on our team.”The Lady Wolfpack will challenge seniors Grace Wilcox, Hailey Reagor, Kara Hester, Madison Halyard and Mandalin Blanton and the rest of the Lady Buccaneers.“Woodland comes from a tough region that has won four of the last five state titles with four different teams, so we know they’re good,” Pirkle said. “We’ve been in a lot of different situations. We just have to advantage of every offensive opportunity that comes our way because you don’t know how often they’ll come along.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T07:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T05:38:04.847+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
