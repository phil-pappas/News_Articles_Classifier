I want to be as close to 100 percent as possible. So that’s my goal,” Williams said of the Beijing tournament after her win in Wuhan. \nAnd she’s sure to be back next year, with her sights already firmly set on the 2016 Olympics in Rio. \n“That will be awesome to be able to play there, represent the US again. That will be an honour,” she said. \nToday Williams regularly goes up against players who were barely as tall as a tennis racket when she first appeared on the professional circuit in 1994 – the year her challenger at Wuhan Muguruza was born – and might be forgiven if she opted to slow down. \nIn 2011 she was diagnosed with Sjogren’s Disease, an immune system disease that often leaves her exhausted. \nThe illness threatened to end her career, but with the help of a new diet Williams has returned to the upper echelons, reaching her first quarter-finals since the Australian Open in 2010 when she lost to her sister Serena at Flushing Meadows this year. \n“I think anyone who goes up against Venus… and expects an easy or a quick one is quite crazy,” said Australian-born, Brit Johanna Konta, who fell to Williams in the quarter-finals at Wuhan. \nWilliams next heads to Beijing, where she will once again be the oldest player in the main draw, but with one thing on her mind. \n“I always want to be in finals. Doesn’t matter what stage I’m in. Even if it was the last tournament of my career, I would still want to be in that final,” she said. \n“It just never gets old.”  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T03:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T08:59:07.862+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
