With the loss, the Jackrabbits fall to 3-22 overall and 2-7 in league play while the league-leading Pioneers improve to 20-5 and 8-2.“I thought we came out in set one and played great. We executed our game play. The girls were fighting and we had 28 digs in the first set,” first-year head coach Nicole Cirillo said. “In set two, they came out with a run and you saw use kind of shrivel up. We got a little tense and we couldn’t work our way out of that. It’s just another opportunity to learn and move forward from.” Sophomores Ashley Beaner (Sioux Falls) and Mikala Hora (Yankton) each recorded seven kills for the Jacks while Hora added a team-high 10 digs and 3 block assists. Senior Lizzie Palmer (Sioux Falls) collected eight digs, including her 1,000th career dig in the first set.“Lizzie is our steady-Eddie out on the court. She is good on serve receive and she obviously digs from left back very well, so I think her meeting that goal is a huge accomplishment for her and this team as well,” Cirillo said. Cassie Baird led Denver with a match-high 11 kills. Monique Domme registered a double-double with 29 set assists and a match-best 19 digs. In the first set after tying for the sixth time at 19, Denver used a 5-0 run to take a 24-19 lead. The Jackrabbits battled back to 24-21 with a Pioneer error and a kill form senior Kacey Herrmann (Pierre), but DU finished the set with a kill. Denver raced out to a 22-8 lead in the second set before South Dakota State scored four of the next five points with kills from Hora and freshman setter Mattison Munger (Council Bluffs, Iowa) and a pair of DU errors. The Pioneers closed the set with a kill from Baird. The Jackrabbits fell behind again in the third set, trailing 18-6 before they scored five straight points fueled by a Herrmann kill and a pair of Munger service aces. Denver outscored SDSU 7-4 to win the match. South Dakota State returns to action Sunday when it travels to Oral Roberts for a 1 p.m. match. \n\nCourtesy: SDSU DISCLAIMER: The views of the author are not necessarily those of this station, its owners, officers, agents or employees.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T06:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T08:08:33.632+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
