Tennis great James Blake got “special treatment” from the watchdog group that investigated his videotaped body-slamming by a cop outside a Manhattan hotel, the head of the police officers’ union charged Thursday.\nPat Lynch, president of the Patrolmen’s Benevolent Association, leveled the charge a day after the Civilian Complaint Review Board concluded that Officer James Frascatore used excessive force and recommended departmental charges.\nPolice Commissioner Bill Bratton conceded that the CCRB has speeded up investigations, especially cases like Blake’s that are “higher priority, more significant news involved events.”\nBut, said Bratton, “that’s a benefit to the officer involved, to the complaint and to the public.”\nThe NYPD released video footage from the Sept. 9 incident outside of the Grand Hyatt Hotel involving James Blake and officer James Frascatore. Frascatore, who is already the focus of an NYPD investigation, got into hot water after the Sept. 9 video showing him throw Blake down on the sidewalk outside the Grand Hyatt Hotel went viral.\nLynch insisted again that Frascatore did nothing wrong and even shook hands with Blake after realizing he was not the suspected credit card fraudster his plainclothes NYPD team was seeking.\nFrascatore “detained the person the way he’s trained to do — handcuff him,” he said. “There was a pat on the back, a handshake and everyone left. This police officer responded to his training.”\nBryan R. Smith/Bryan R. Smith PBA President Patrick Lynch still maintains that Frascatore did nothing wrong in the incident involving Blake. But the CCRB was too quick to draw the wrong conclusion about Frascatore, said Lynch.\n“That’s always the danger, because you are a person of notoriety, you get special treatment and it moves faster and everyone knows about it,” Lynch said. “Do the investigation without fear or favor. Whoever the complainant is, it’s the CCRB's job to do a thorough and correct investigation, not to get a result to get a headline.”\nThe CCRB also recommended departmental charges against Detective Daniel Herzog for abusing his authority by authorizing the bogus arrest, sources said.\nHandout NYPD Police Officer James Frascatore was involved in taking down and falsely arresting former tennis star James Blake on Sept. 9. Blake’s lawyer, Kevin Marino, said on Wednesday he wants Frascatore fired. The retired tennis great, however, gave a more measured response.\n“I have complete respect for the principle of due process and appreciate the efforts of the CCRB to advance this investigation,” Blake said.\nBlake, who has received apologies from both Bratton and Mayor de Blasio, is biracial and said he hopes what happened to him at the hands of a white cop will lead to changes in the way the NYPD treats people of color.\nFrascatore, who has been on the job for four years, is an aggressive cop who has been the subject of previous complaints. He has been riding a desk since the Blake incident.\nrparascandola@nydailynews.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T22:09:05.266+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
