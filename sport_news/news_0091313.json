The unseeded Williams won 5-7, 6-2, 7-6 after Vinci came from 4-1 down in the final set but failed to serve out the match when leading 6-5. The No15-seeded Italian sliced a backhand into the net on her match point and Williams pounced, hitting a pair of huge groundstrokes in the next two points to break back. Williams ripped a forehand volley to go up 6-4 in the tiebreaker and clinched the victory when Vinci missed a forehand wide. Venus, who earned her 700th career victory to reach the quarter-finals, had never dropped a set against the Italian, who ended Serenaâ€™s chances of a calendar-year grand slam in the US Open semi-finals.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T08:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T09:35:22.405+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
