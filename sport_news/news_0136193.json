(AP) - Things were supposed to be different in the Sunshine State this season. \n- The Tampa Bay Buccaneers drafted quarterback Jameis Winston with the top pick, getting a Heisman Trophy winner and collegiate national champion. \n- The Miami Dolphins signed defensive tackle Ndamukong Suh to a six-year, $114 million contract, landing the top free agent on the market. \n- The Jacksonville Jaguars completed a three-year overhaul that included a burgeoning roster and nearly $180 million in free agency upgrades. \nBut already Florida’s NFL teams have fallen short of expectations. All three are 1-3 after the first quarter of the season. \n“There are a lot of teams that aren’t in Florida that are 1-3, too,” Dolphins center Mike Pouncey said. \nIndeed, there are 11 teams sitting at 1-3 across the league. But Florida is the only state with two or more teams on the list. \nOne of them should get a win this week since the Buccaneers host the Jaguars on Sunday. The Dolphins are on a bye. \nThere’s no common theme as to what has gone wrong in the state. The Bucs can blame two rookies, Winston and kicker Kyle Brindza. The Dolphins can blame two fired coaches, Joe Philbin and defensive coordinator Kevin Coyle. The Jaguars can blame two pivotal injuries, playing without tight end Julius Thomas and defensive tackle Sen’Derrick Marks. \n“There are no excuses,” Jaguars tight end Marcedes Lewis said. “This is the NFL. It’s about being good in game situations. Football is a sport where game situations matter. What you do in those situations, that’s what defines you.” \nHere’s what has defined the Bucs, Fins and Jags in 2015: \n___ \nBUCCANEERS: Winston has eight turnovers, including seven interceptions. Two of those were returned for touchdowns. \nThe Buccaneers knew there would be some growing pains with the former Florida State star, but they also expected the offensive line would play better in front of him. Winston has been sacked nine times. \n“It’s just not all on Jameis, believe me,” coach Lovie Smith said. “We say those turnovers (are to blame), and they had a lot to do with it, but there are other areas we need to improve also and we will.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T01:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T03:04:34.266+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
