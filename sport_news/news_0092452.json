Taylor Domico of Wayne Hills was third in 19:47, marking just the third time three girls have broken 20 minutes at Garret in the same Passaic County race. \nThe Patriots, who also placed juniors Emily Becker (fifth), Natalie Zawistowska (sixth) and Shea Brennan (ninth) in the top 10, came within three points of breaking the Passaic County scoring record in the meet set by Wayne Hills with 21 in 2012. \nThey averaged 20:18.6 per girl, less than 10 seconds a girl away from the school record set by the 2013 team that was second in the state sectionals and is the 10th fastest team time run by a Passaic County team at Garret. \n“I wanted us to work as a team and then I wanted to run as fast as I could for them,” said Zachmann, the only senior in the top 10 of the girls race. “This is the best feeling and it’s unbelievable to think that we could work so hard and do this.” \nZachmann is the last remaining member of the 2012 team at Wayne Hills, and she remembers the support she got when she was a freshman at a low ebb in her running career.” \n“Those girls [including current Syracuse star Stephanie Bitcon and Patriot assistant coach Aly Pyper] taught me so much about how not to give up and not to give in,” said Zachmann. “I was so bad as a freshman that I wanted to quit and Stephanie, Aly and the other girls just wouldn’t let me.” \n“Now we have a chance to do something Wayne Hills girls have never done before (win a state sectional title) and I know I’m got more in me.” © 2015 North Jersey Media Group Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T07:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T08:32:48.941+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
