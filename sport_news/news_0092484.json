The announcement, made by Old Dominion University President John Broderick, was expected. Word that a search committee led by Broderick had recommended MacLeod broke nearly two weeks ago.\nThe 14 Conference USA presidents met in Irving, Texas today and ratified the search committee’s recommendation. Broderick, who chairs the Conference USA Board of Directors, said the vote was unanimous.\nMacLeod has served as interim commissioner since Britton Banowsky stepped down late this summer after 13 years. Banowsky left to join the College Football Playoff Foundation.\n“She is well respected nationally,” Broderick said. ”We all look forward to her being a strong voice for the conference on national issues.”\nThere are only a handful of female Division I commissioners, including the Atlantic 10's Bernadette McGlade and Patty Viverito of the Missouri Valley Conference, and until MacLeod, a woman had never led an FBS league.\n\"It's really a humbling day for me,\" MacLeod said. \"If I can do a great job and more women benefit by having an opportunity to interview for jobs, and to be hired, then I’m really happy to do that.\n\"I need to do a great job for the 14 schools in our league.\"\nMacLeod, a Washington native who was the longtime athletic director at Tulsa, has served as the conference’s associate executive commissioner and chief operating officer since 2006. Essentially, she was second in command to Banowsky, and was often credited with running the day-to-day operations of the conference office.\nBroderick said her experience as an athletic director and her membership on several NCAA committees, including the Division I men’s basketball committee, helped sway the presidents.\nC-USA faces challenges in several fronts, including TV contracts that must be re-negotiated before next year, a movement to provide benefits to athletes beyond scholarships and the widening financial divide between the Power Five conferences and the five mid-major leagues.\n\"The national landscape of college athletics is a little unsettled,\" she said. \"We face many challenges. We’ll take them on one at a time.”\nBanowsky helped steer the league through two bouts of realignment, including the latest in which the league lost seven members to the American Athletic Conference in 2012 and 2013. C-USA expanded by taking in nine schools, including ODU.\nSince realignment, C-USA has been a one-bid league in men's and women's basketball. MacLeod said one of her biggest challenges is to is try to rebuild the league's basketball image. C-USA men's basketball took a huge hit when Memphis, Tulane and Houston all joined the American Athletic Conference. \n\"We need to be a multi-bid league in both men’s and women’s basketball,\" she said. \"Obviously, performance on the court is important. But I think our teams are maybe better than the perception.\n\"We need to get the word out better. We need to get our bottom teams better. We need to schedule more top 50 teams, although I realize scheduling is hard.\"\nHarry Minium, 757-446-2371,\nharry.minium@pilotonline.com \nhttps://twitter.com/Harry_MiniumVP \nhttps://www.facebook.com/ODUBlitz \n \n[X] Click a thumbnail to view the full-size image.
