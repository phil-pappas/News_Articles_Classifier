Gulp.\nWide receiver Leonte Carroo, cornerback Blessuan Austin and strong safety Davon Jacobs are questionable for Saturday's matchup with No. 1 Ohio State (8 p.m., ABC).\nAll three players left Saturday's 55-52 win over Indiana after suffering injuries.\nThe injury to Carroo, who has 21 catches for 472 yards and nine touchdowns, is most concerning. He appeared to suffer a right ankle injury as he hauled in his third touchdown pass in the third quarter on Saturday.\nCarroo missed the fourth quarter and had a walking boot on his right foot after the game. Despite his questionable status on the injury report, Carroo left no doubt about his intention to be in the lineup for the game against the Buckeyes.\n\"I'll definitely be playing next week,\" Carroo said after the Indiana game .\nAustin appeared to suffer a head injury in a collision with teammate Steve Longa. Jacobs started on Saturday after missing the previous two games with an upper body injury, but he left the game early and did not return.\nFormer walk-on Andre Hunt filled in at strong safety after Jacobs and Kiy Hester went down on Saturday. Hester is not listed on the injury report despite leaving Saturday's game after a collision with Longa.\nTrue freshman Jarius Adams, who had been questionable with an upper body injury, replaced Austin and was beat for a 38-yard touchdown in the third quarter.\nIf Austin is out, Adams will likely start opposite redshirt freshman Isaiah Wharton, who had his first career interception on Saturday. They'll be backed up by true freshman Ronnie James and walk-on Brian Verbitski.\nWide receiver Janarion Grant (lower body) and middle linebacker Kaiwan Lewis (upper body) are also listed as questionable.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T20:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T20:15:15.471+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
