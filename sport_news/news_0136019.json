Farrell/Times Union) Photo: Michael P. Farrell Buy this photo Healthy Flower thriving 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Schalmont cross country standout Julia Flower is enjoying an outstanding senior season for the Sabres.\nAfter suffering through an injury-riddled junior campaign, Flower has won several races this fall — including the Blackbird Invitational and the Grout Run (her second title).\nIn May, Flower finished 24th at the 38th annual Freihofer's Run for Women.\nQ: How satisfied have you been with your season so far?\nA: I had a little bit of a rough beginning of the season because I had low vitamins — low B12 and iron. Now, I am starting to get back into it again. It is nice to be to be able to do that again.\nQ: When you started running, was it something you loved right away, or was it something that came gradually?\nA: I first started running in 10th grade. Before that, I was a swimmer. I really liked running because it was different than swimming. You can look around, whereas in swimming you are just staring at the bottom of the pool. By the end of that sophomore season, I was committed to running.\nQ: The team aspect in cross country has to be fun as you train together and encourage each other. Having your sister Kerry on the team must make your experience more enjoyable, right?\nA: It is good to have the team supporting each other. Sometimes in track, we all go our separate distances.\nQ: Did you enter this season with certain goals you hoped to achieve, or are you approaching things week-by- week?\nA: Kind of both. I definitely want to get back to the state meet. I want to do a 5k under 18 minutes. I did so during the summer. I want to do under that time in cross country.\nQ: Do you want to run in college?\nA: Yes, I actually have been looking at colleges and I want to run Division I. I really want to go to Providence, and I really hope that works out.\nQ: It is difficult to juggle college visits around your running schedule?\nA: Yes, it is very difficult. On the college visits, they usually have you stay two days, so you have to figure how to get all my homework done. It is very stressful, but hopefully over with soon.\nQ: Have you determined a major yet?\nA: I am thinking about biology or something involving exercise.\nQ: Do you have particular course you like, or is there one upcoming you enjoy competing on?\nA: Every year. I really like the Grout Run. It is more on the road, and I like road running better. I like Saratoga, too.\nQ: How enjoyable is running in the Freihofer's?\nA: I love the Freihofer's and running with the top runners in the world. It is so much fun.\nQ: Getting the chance to compete with world-class runners has to be both appealing and challenging?\nA: I love competing against such great runners.\nQ: I would imagine it is a fun time to be a Schalmont athlete with so many of the fall teams enjoying success?\nA: We usually do pretty well in the fall. I know some of the soccer players. They are really nice and doing very well.\nHonor roll\nA look at this past week's top performers:\nEmily Bini , Guilderland girls' cross country: The eighth-grade standout captured the title at the Albany County Championships Friday at Colonie Town Park with a time of 17 minutes, 43 seconds.\nMonica Strain, Maple Hill girls' cross country: The junior prevailed at the Rensselaer County Championships by covering the Grafton State Park course in 16:39.55.\nNoah Carey , Guilderland boys' cross country: The junior finished first at the Albany County Championships in 15:09.\nJeremy Carter , Averill Park boys' cross country: The senior won at the Rensselaer County Championships in 14:34.63.\nEli Bashant , Ballston Spa boys' cross country: A senior, Bashant took home the title Friday at the Greenwich Invitational at Spa State Park in 16:32.\nYaYa Van Ness, Saratoga girls' soccer: Registered five goals in a 5-3 victory against Queensbury.\nBrittany LaPlant, Cambridge girls' soccer: Tallied three goals in a 5-3 non-league setback against Saratoga and netted four goals in the Spartans' 7-1 Class A first-round win against Lansingburgh.\nMatt Crisafulli , Christian Brothers Academy boys' soccer: Scored twice Wednesday to power the Brothers to a 3-1 Class AA first-round victory over Niskayuna\nNatalie Schuman , Burnt Hills girls' volleyball: Delivered 15 kills and 22 digs to help the Spartans edge Shenendehowa 3-2 in Suburban Council play.\nMary Batkus, Scotia girls' soccer: Found the back of the net Saturday, leading the Tartans to the Foothills Council title with a 1-0 decision over South Glens Falls.\nAaron Cook , Bethlehem boys' volleyball: Generated 10 kills and three aces, helping the Eagles defeat Niskayuna 3-0 to improve to 14-0 in the Suburban Council.\nDakota Harvey , Saratoga football: The senior running back rumbled for 168 yards and five touchdowns in leading the Blue Streaks to a 41-13 Class AA quarterfinal decision over Bethlehem.\nBrett Rodriguez , Queensbury football: The senior scored five touchdowns for the second straight week (four rushing and a 50-yard punt return), finishing with 206 yards rushing on seven first-half carries, in the Spartans' 59-27 Class A quarterfinal win against Mohonasen.
