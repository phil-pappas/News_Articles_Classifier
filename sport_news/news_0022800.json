Authorities had alleged that Adams stole a cellphone during an Aug. 30 fight with the driver. \nThe misdemeanor charge does not include theft, only battery against a transportation operator. \nAdams served a three-game suspension for the Bruins (4-2) over the incident, and was reinstated when no felony charge was filed. \nUCLA declined comment on the new charge. \nCoach Jim Mora said when Adams was reinstated that he had profusely apologized and accepted the consequences for the incident. \nAll content copyright ©2015 The Tribune, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T04:27:00.726+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
