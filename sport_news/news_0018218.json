But when PV needed a stop late, its defense delivered in a big way. Leading by just a touchdown and Dieruff driving with less than five minutes to play, Pleasant Valley got a pass knocked down by BJ Olaniyan and a tackle for loss by Garrett Gouger which led to a turnover on downs. Quarterback Brandon Keyes entered in relief to throw for 232 yards and three touchdowns as the Bears won their fourth straight, a 42-20 victory over the Huskies on Friday night in Eastern Pennsylvania Conference North Division play. Running back Austyn Borre finished with 99 yards and a pair of touchdowns, while Danny Hunter caught two touchdowns, Justin Richardson a third, and Olaniyan ran back an interception 62 yards in the final minute. It was a slow start for both teams. Dieruff racked up nine penalties in the first quarter, while PV didn’t take advantage of those penalties. PV’s offense was inconsistent and the Bears switched quarterbacks late in the first quarter, giving Keyes control of the offense. And what a game Keyes had. On Keyes’ second throw of the game, he hit a streaking Hunter for a 61 yard touchdown pass for a 7-0 lead. The Bears went ahead 14-0 on a Borre run from the 5 with 7:46 to play in the half. Dieruff battled back. The Huskies would tie the game at 14 with 2:16 to play in the half when Nizayah Speaks hit Jon Jackson for an 8 yard strike. PV would finish with a score just before the half, taking advantage of a Dieruff fumble. Keyes hit Borre for a 9 yard pass, and on the next play, found Richardson for a 28 yard touchdown for a 21-14 lead at the half.
