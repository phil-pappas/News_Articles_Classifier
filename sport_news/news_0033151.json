The first game was tied at 20, but Harrisburg pulled away and won 25-22 on a kill by Matty Hawkins. Then the Lady Wildcats won the second game, 25-20, and a win in the third would pull them even with the Lady Bulldogs, who still had to face Murphysboro. It was tied at 11 and Harrisburg scored four straight points to win the match and stay unbeaten, although the final point came when Marion's Halli Lincoln appeared to ramp a ball off the Harrisburg blockers but the officials didn't see it that way and the Lady Bulldogs won 15-11. \"We thought we had a touch,\" said Marion coach Kent Carrell, who is also a volleyball official. \"I told the girls as a referee that's one of the hardest things to pick up. The ball is coming off at 60 mph and it's hard to see it touch a finger. If the score had been closer I might have argued a lot more.\" Murphysboro went on to sweep the field with a 25-23, 26-24 win over Harrisburg, which ended up 4-1. NCOE and Marion both went 2-3, while Du Quoin finished winless in five matches. Marion faced the eventual champions in the second round and lost 25-20, 25-22 to the Lady Red Devils. \"We were tied at 21 in the second game and didn't get that point,\" Carrell said. \"But we played them really tough. Every team that beat us, they took it to us.\" Marion beat Du Quoin in the early match (25-13, 25-19), then outlasted rival Herrin 17-25, 25-22, 15-12 before the lunch break. The Lady Wildcats lost to NCOE 25-23, 25-16 after losing to Harrisburg. \"The Harrisburg match kind of took the wind out of our sails and NCOE is a really good team that plays great defense,\" Carrell said. \"And we were a little slow on our feet by that point.\" Marion's Morgan Dodd and Randi Smith were named to the eight-person all-tournament team. Dodd had 93 digs in the five matches, while Smith had 24 kills on the day. \"Morgan just played excellent and her passing was outstanding like always,\" Carrell said. \"Morgan and Randi both had an outstanding tournament.\" Halli Lincoln added 21 kills and 43 digs, while Haley Gooch had 28 assists and was 25 of 26 serving. Abby Bayer had 28 kills and went 36 of 36 from the service line with three aces, Haley Van Horn had 43 digs, Kylie Plant had 18 kills and Kaylee Evans had 39 assists. Marion is now 15-13 on the season and hosts Mt. Vernon on Tuesday. \"I really wanted to be 3-2 and I thought we could do that,\" Carrell said. \"If we played really well, I thought we might win it. But we're still making unforced errors at critical times and we had good teams here and you can't do that against good teams.\" Page 2 of 2 - The rest of the all-tournament team included Harrisburg's Bryleigh Buchanan, Herrin's Madison LeQuatte, Murphysboro's Heather Cross and Sarah Jacobs and NCOE's Hope Everett and Sydney Tucker.
