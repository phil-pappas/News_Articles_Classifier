(AP) - Some patients with sickle cell disease say they're back to having long waits in emergency rooms since the University of Mississippi Medical Center temporarily closed a clinic that was designed to help them.\nThe clinic closed in August - 14 months after it opened. UMMC administrators say they're looking for a new location and are in the process of hiring a nurse for the clinic, which they hope to re-open by year's end.\nThe medical center says the original site was never meant to be permanent.\nJosh Foxi, a Jackson-area musician and medical student, has sickle cell disease. He tells The Clarion-Ledger ( http://on.thec-l.com/1kdxt8H ) that patients are back in emergency rooms since the clinic's closure.\nAn estimated 2,000 to 2,500 Mississippians have sickle cell disease, which can cause painful blood-flow problems.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
