They’ve rushed for almost 2,400 yards in eight games, but had no one with more than 400 yards going into Friday’s game. \nGirtz had the big night Friday. He had 10 rushes for 130 yards and three touchdowns. Jonny Kasper, the Pioneers’ leading rusher, had 10 carries for 80 yards and a touchdown. They had eight players carry the ball Friday. \nThe players said they were well-prepared. \n“That says a lot about our coaching,” said Skiba, who is listed at 6-foot-3 and 295 pounds. “They put so much more time into it than I do.” \n“Yeah, while they’re golfing,” Girtz quipped about the Pierz coaches. \nPioneers head coach Leo Pohlkamp and offensive coordinator Rick Sczublewski are indeed retired and do like to golf. \nBut they and the rest of the staff have put together an impressive team. While they run the ball extremely well, they’ve passed for nine touchdowns this season with no interceptions. \nAaron Weber found Michael Meyer in the end zone for a 21-yard touchdown pass in the second quarter that put Pierz up 28-7. \nAnd they play defense. Holdingford, which perennially has one of the area’s top ground games, was held to 102 yards, including 74 rushing on 33 attempts. \nStory continues below.

Huskers quarterback Alex Knapp, who found Brandon Skroch for a 14-yard TD, was sacked four times. \n“The coaches tell us the first eight games are practice,” Skiba said. \n“We’re 0-0,” Girtz said. \nPierz is going to get the top seed in the Section 5-3A playoffs which begin Wednesday. The Pioneers will have a first-round bye. Holdingford awaits word on its seed in Section 6-3A. Those playoffs begin Tuesday. \nThere were too many variables Friday night for Mitchell to be sure who Holdingford was going to play. The Huskers expect to be on the road. \n“We’ve got a long way to go,” Mitchell said. “We don’t want to be choosing who we want to play right now.” \nThe pairings for both sections will be finalized Saturday. \nFirst quarter \nP — Jonny Kasper 14 run (Lane Girtz kick) \nP — L.
