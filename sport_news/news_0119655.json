(AP Photo/Bill Wippert) Comments \nHertfordshire, England â€” Buffalo Bills general manager Doug Whaley isn't sure where wide receiver Percy Harvin is, mentally or physically, as the veteran is reportedly pondering retirement after a string of injuries. \nSpeaking with the media for the first time since the regular season began, Whaley addressed Harvin's situation and said the team is taking a day-by-day approach. \n\"Still just a personal reason that he's out, and we'll address it as soon as we get some more answers on it,\" Whaley said from the Bills' practice field in Hertfordshire, England. \nWhaley said the Bills found out early last week that Harvin \"needed to take some time for personal reasons.\" \n\"I haven't been in contact with him,\" Whaley said. \"We said we're gonna focus this week on this game, and when we get back, we'll reach out to him and see where he is.\" \nThe Bills don't want to reveal how severe Harvin's injury situation is. He's dealing with hip and knee injuries that have lingered and begun to frustrate him. \n\"We'll keep that in-house, but I know there's a lot of other things that are going on that it's just not strictly injury-related,\" Whaley said. \nAt this point, the Bills have to plan on not having Harvin at least in the short term, but Whaley wouldn't say whether the team has made longterm plans to not have him. \n\"I mean, we're preparing for the Jacksonville Jaguars,\" Whaley said. \"We don't have him this game. We'll see after that. It's one of those things where we have to take it day-by-day, game-by-game, and he's not here. But again, we have full faith that our backups, we need them step up. The whole team. And that's what happens when you're a backup. Everybody's got to raise their level of play. Because our expectation, you guys' expectation of us, is not going to dip. And we're not going to dip, either. We got to get out there and find a way to win.\" \nHow do the Bills do that this week with a game against the Jaguars in London? Harvin isn't the only receiver out. Sammy Watkins will miss the game with an ankle injury, and Marquise Goodwin was placed on injured reserve this week. They are left with Robert Woods, Chris Hogan, Denarius Moore and Marcus Easley as the only four receivers on the 53-man roster. \n\"We're adjusting because luckily we have Denarius Moore. We got those guys coming in and they're going to have to step up, just like anything,\" Whaley said. \"Injuries are going to be a part of it. Situations arise where you just don't know about it. It tests your depth. And obviously depth is something that we're trying to build. And when you put backup players in there, you expect them to play as well as they can and our expectations aren't going to dip. But it is a challenge.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T17:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T21:19:54.987+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
