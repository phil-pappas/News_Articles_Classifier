He edges out J.J. Frazier, who is a more potent scorer but lacks the size to defend bigger players. \nOgbeide is someone who will likely follow the same track as Maten, as physically capable freshman forward who could earn larger minutes as the season goes on. Ogbeide won’t have to sit behind two seniors like Maten did, and this should allow him to develop quicker than Maten. By the end of the season, when Georgia is matching up against giant front courts like Kentucky, Ogbeide will be needed to provide size. \nBest Newcomer: Turtle Jackson \nJackson gets the nod mostly because Fox has been more willing to play young guards than he has young bigs. While Jackson could be someone who ends up coming off the bench to start, he will have the ability to run the offense as the lead facilitator. \nOgbeide is another likely candidate, it just comes down to how willing Fox is to let Ogbeide play through his mistakes. E'torrion Wilridge is a sleeper candidate, as Fox raved about how well the Texas native can shoot. Wilridge likely has the easiest path to playing time, so he could easily end up getting more minutes than Jackson or Wilridge. \nMost Valuable Player: Charles Mann \nThis is a bit of shocker. The warts in Mann’s game are a little more obvious to see than others. He doesn’t make enough free throws, he turns the ball over at times, etc. \nBut Mann is durable and is in the best playing shape of his career. His game may not be as pretty as Kenny Gaines but when the game is on the line, the ball is going to be in Mann's hands. And that's why he's the MVP. \nFinal record: 22-10, fourth place finish in the SEC \nGeorgia should have another solid season. The Bulldogs have the unfortunate task of drawing, Kentucky, Vanderbilt and LSU on the road, but they do get Arkansas at home and Georgia’s home and home opponents are some of the worst in the conference. Georgia may not have a ton of quality win opportunities, outside of a January trip to Baylor their best nonconference game is a home game against either Clemson or Kansas State. Georgia has a good chance of finding itself back in the NCAA Tournament. If the team remains healthy and gets some breaks, a win or two in the NCAA Tournament could happen. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T23:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T23:31:27.693+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
