At that point, they roll the dice with home-field advantage. There is an optimist’s argument and here it is.\nSimple math tells you that after the first three games of all series, there must always be one team that leads two games to one. If Marco Estrada can change speeds with his man Dioner Navarro behind the plate, controlling the Rangers power bats, he can lift the Jays to that position, trailing 2-1.\nAt that point, Jays manager John Gibbons will then have to make a decision whether to go with David Price on short rest in Game 4 and come back with Marcus Stroman on regular rest in Game 5, or whether to stay the course and put out knuckleballer R.A. Dickey, followed by Price.\nHere is the Jays lesson. In the history of Major League baseball’s five-game playoffs, there have been 13 occasions, from a sample size of 116 series, either in the league championship series (1969-84) or the division series (1981; 1995-2014), that have started out 2-0 in games, then ultimately gone on to be decided in five games. That’s all the Jays want, a chance to reach a Game 5.\nOf the teams that trailed 0-2 after two games, then forced the series to go the distance, eight of those 13 comeback teams ended up winning Game 5. The list of eight comeback five-game series winners: the Dodgers vs. the Astros in 1981; Milwaukee vs. the Angels in 1982; San Diego vs. the Cubs in 1984; Seattle vs. the Yankees in 1995; Boston vs. Cleveland in 1999; the Yankees vs. Oakland in 2001; Boston vs. Oakland in 2003; and San Francisco vs. Cincinnato in 2012.\nFurther, four of those series began with the home team losing twice, then fighting back to extend to it to five games:\n1981 ALCS: New York Yankees beat Milwaukee 3-2 The two AL East winners from a strike-marred season met in the first ever ALDS. The Yankees opened with a pair of wins in Milwaukee, going back to the Bronx in the driver’s seat. But the Brewers beat Tommy John 5-3 in Game 3 and won 2-1 in Game 4, with the deciding game at Yankee Stadium in what was a 2-3 format. The Yankees regrouped and captured the series, with four runs in the fourth, behind left-hander Ron Guidry.\n2001 ALDS: New York Yankees beat Oakland 3-2 The A’s took the first two games at Yankee Stadium with Mark Mulder and Tim Hudson winning on the road. Then came the Yankees’ dramatic Game 3 win. Jorge Posada homered in the fifth and Derek Jeter made the iconic backhand feed to the catcher on an errant throw for a tag on Jeremy Giambi that is one of the Yankee captain’s defining moments. When Orlando (El Duque) Hernandez beat Cory Lidle 9-2 in Game 4 at the Coliseum, the series shifted back to New York, with no travel day. The Yankees completed the comeback that the Jays are attempting, then advanced to the World Series, losing to the Diamondbacks.\n2010 ALDS: Texas beats Tampa Bay 3-2 This is a series that David Price does not remember fondly. The Rangers won the opener 5-1, with Cliff Lee over Price at the Trop, then took Game 2 by a score of 6-0 to head to Arlington with a stranglehold on the series. The Rays captured both decisions to even the series and take it back to Florida. In Game 3, Texas led 2-1 after seven innings, but the Rays scored two in the eighth and three in the ninth, then won 5-2 in Game 4. After an off day, it was a second Price-Lee matchup. The result was the same and the Rangers won all three games at Tropicana Field. Price was 0-2, 4.97 ERA in the series, pitching 12 2/3 innings.\n2012 NLDS: San Francisco beats Cincinnati 3-2 After the Giants lost 5-2 and 9-0 in San Francisco, right fielder Hunter Pence called a team meeting before the next game at Great American Ballpark and gave a heart-felt speech that seemed to turn the tide. The Giants took Game 3 in 10 innings, with the run scoring on a Scott Rolen error. In Game 4, they won 8-3, with three runs in the seventh capped by a Pablo Sandoval homer. With Game 5 staying in Cincinnati, Buster Posey put a capper on the comeback with a grand slam in the fifth. The Giants went on to win the World Series.\nThe Blue Jays just want to create the opportunity for a Game 5, but they need a hero or two.\nMore on thestar.com\nThe questions will start right after the Blue Jays’ last pitch: Arthur\nSeven’s a crowd for Raptors’ big men", "external_links": ["http://static.freeskreen.com/publisher/52/freeskreen.min.js"], "published": "2015-10-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T02:39:33.798+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
