The Regis Jesuit Raiders were quite angry last week after a home loss to ThunderRidge.\nThey played with an attitude Thursday night while creating five turnovers on the way to easily handling Mountain Vista 35-0 at Shea Stadium on the first cold night of the football season in the Denver area.\n\"Yes, we were (mad),\" Raiders junior receiver Jack Weigand said after catching two touchdown passes. \"I mean, that really made us mad and we didn't play our best game. But it was good to come back and play well.\"\nRanked No. 9 in The Associated Press 5A media poll, Regis Jesuit improved to 6-2 overall and has clinched at least a share of the Continental League lead heading into the final week of the regular season at 3-1. The Raiders are tied with Mountain Vista, also 6-2 and 3-1. ThunderRidge, 2-1 in league play, faced Highlands Ranch on Friday.\nRegis Jesuit will finish next week at home against Fruita Monument. Mountain Vista will take on Highlands Ranch.\nThe defending league champion Raiders, who have won eight of their past nine Continental North games, took an early 7-0 lead on a 46-yard touchdown pass from Justin Lamb to Jack Stoll, then erupted for 21 points in the second quarter.\nWeigand followed with a 10-yard scoring pass from Michael Pavlakovich and put it away with an 85-yard, catch-and-run play that boosted the Raiders' lead to 28-0 by halftime. In between, Quentin Birch had a 3-yard scoring run.\nFor Mountain Vista, turnovers were the biggest problem, including fumbling at the Raiders' 3-yard line near the end of the first half, although they were augmented by dropped passes and an inability to deal with the Regis Jesuit fronts and secondary.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T20:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T12:04:48.779+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
