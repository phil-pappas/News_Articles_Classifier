Meyer was criticized for selecting several older players, like Jean de Villiers, Victor Matfield, Fourie du Preez and Duane Vermeulen, who had either been injured or had received little game time before the tournament That criticism only intensified after the Springboks lost their opening game against Japan despite fielding a lineup with 880 games’ experience. Many called for the veterans to be axed after the loss. De Villiers, who was the captain, was forced out of the tournament after sustaining a broken jaw in a group match against Samoa — he subsequently retired from international rugby — while Matfield has also not played since the Samoa game because of a hamstring injury. The absence of that pair has been seen by many as a blessing in disguise. It brought Damian de Allende and Jesse Kriel together in the Springboks’ midfield, which has added a dynamic element that was lacking with de Villiers. Two young locks, Lood de Jager and Eben Etzebeth have been a towering presence in the pack, establishing themselves as one of the best second-row pairings in the tournament.

Winger Bryan Habana, 32, scored a hat trick against the United States and is now tied with the New Zealand legend Jonah Lomu for most tries scored at the World Cup. Loose forward Schalk Burger, who nearly died of bacterial meningitis in 2013, has been a huge presence, too. Against Wales last weekend, the 32-year-old Burger gained more yards than any other player and tackled anything that moved. And Vermeulen, 29, and du Preez, 33, combined to score the late game- winning try that earned South Africa a semifinal showdown with New Zealand. Du Preez, who has taken over as captain, has been particularly influential since his recall. He is an astute reader of what goes on during the game and provides the cool-headed decisions behind the forward pack. His decision-making and communication with the players around him, as well as his kicking game, take some of the pressure off the young flyhalf Handré Pollard, 21. Meyer described du Preez as a “tactical genius” and the “most astute player I have ever coached.” But he also praised all of his old guard. “They are like charcoal; when you put them under pressure, you get diamonds,” Meyer told Reuters. There have been other diamonds on display, too. New Zealand flyhalf Dan Carter, 33, has had his critics this year, with many questioning whether he was still the All Blacks’ first choice as playmaker, after some below-par performances during the Rugby Championship. But he silenced his critics with a dominant display against Australia in August and did so again in the quarterfinal against the French in Cardiff, Wales, as the All Blacks won, 62-13. \nAdvertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T14:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T17:17:16.522+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
