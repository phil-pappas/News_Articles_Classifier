The 47th-ranked American beat Ernests Gulbis of Latvia 6-3, 7-6 (4) to advance to his maiden ATP final. \nThe eighth-ranked Ferrer, who is 4-0 in finals this season, is after his 26th career title. Last year he was beaten by Andy Murray in the final here. \nFerrer and Johnson have not played each other before. The American has a 0-9 record against top-10 players. \nThe first set between Ferrer and Monfils went with serve before the Spaniard won the tiebreaker by converting his fourth set point. \nMonfils then allowed the only break of the game after hitting three straight double-faults at 5-5 in the second set. Ferrer converted his first match point in the next game. \nAfter losing three semifinals in his career, the 25-year-old Johnson became the first American to reach the final here since Pete Sampras, who went on to win the title in 1998. \nJohnson, who had 12 aces, led Gulbis 6-3, 4-3 when he lost serve on the only break point he faced in the entire match. He closed out the win on his second match point in the tiebreaker. \nThis story has been corrected to show that Pete Sampras was the last American player to win the Vienna tournament in 1998. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T22:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T22:47:23.413+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
