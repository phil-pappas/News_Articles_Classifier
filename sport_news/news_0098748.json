Again.\nWith Zdeno Chara (upper body) and Dennis Seidenberg (back) already on the shelf, Brad Marchand appeared to suffer a head injury late in last night’s game when he skated into the elbow of Canadiens forward Dale Weise . He was very slow to get up and was woozy as he made his way to the bench. He had to be helped down the runway and into the dressing room.\nCoach Claude Julien did not have an update on Marchand’s condition. With the B’s struggling mightily with their game, they can ill-afford to lose one of their more reliable players for long.\n“I honestly didn’t see the play, I was changing on that,” said his linemate Patrice Bergeron . “We’ll see what the word is. You never want to see him hurt, so hopefully he’ll be all right.”\nWhile there was nothing unseemly about the incident, the league’s player safety department should be getting a good look at the video from this game. Ryan Spooner was given a major and game misconduct for a boarding penalty and that opened a cut over Brian Flynn ’s eye. Torrey Mitchell was given a late match penalty for slew-footing Zac Rinaldo , with Max Talbot coming to his linemate’s defense. And whether anything comes of it, the league would do well to take a look at the nasty Alexei Emelin leg check on Bergeron that was called interference. Bergeron was flexing the leg for a while after the play, but stayed in the game.\nJulien has response\nJulien was not thrilled when, in is morning press briefing yesterday, he was asked about a “lack of response” from Bruins in the immediate aftermath of an illegal check to the head from Winnipeg’s Alexander Burmistrov on Bergeron Thursday.\nThe Bruins coach came off the top rope.\n“There’s always criticizing when something like that happens,” Julien said. “I can guarantee you if Bergeron stays down from that hit, there’s a pile on that guy. OK? So our team will stick together, which they also did when Bergeron got hit. They all got in there. But Bergeron was good enough to get there himself and start dealing with it before the referees came in, so that response was good.\n“Then you say ‘OK, he’s fine. Now the league has to look into it.’ You’re hoping the league will make the right decision. They made a decision and we move on. But if anybody wants to criticize a lack of response, it’s a load of crap because our guys did respond.”\nThe league, however, decided the force of the blow did not warrant a fine or a suspension, just a warning.\nWhile he was unhappy with the hit, Bergeron shrugged off the fact that there was no supplemental discipline.\n“I wasn’t necessarily expecting anything,” Bergeron said. “I was going to wait and see what’s going to unfold out of it and now that nothing happened, I’ve just got to move on and look forward. That being said, (Burmistrov) apologized afterwards and hopefully he won’t do that again. It’s one of those hits that can definitely be avoided.” . . .\nJulien also wasn’t too happy about being asked about David Pastrnak ’s absence from the two power-play units.\n“Right now we have two power-plays and the first power-play was extremely good (in the first period against Winnipeg), we had good chances,” said Julien. “I think David Pastrnak is a young player who like many will only get better. We’ve got to stop thinking that if he’s not on power-plays, we don’t think much of him. Because in my mind, he’ll be a good power-play guy, he’ll be a good goal-scorer. He’ll be a lot of good things, as long as we take our time and develop him properly and don’t put anything over his head. And that’s not to say you’re not going to see him on the power-play, either. We’re just making some decisions right now that we think are right for him and our hockey club.”\nMiller makes debut\nDefenseman Colin Miller made his NHL debut last night and played fairly well. He took three shots (one landed) and delivered a hit in 16:13 of ice time.\n“I thought he was good tonight,” Julien said. “He did a good job for his first game and you can see where he can move the puck well, he’s got a good shot. He’ll get better. He competes hard. In my mind I’m not disappointed in his start.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T14:23:16.658+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
