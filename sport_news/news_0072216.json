They are single-minded and determined on the hunt for what they consider prized possessions: players' autographs.\nSome of these autograph hounds start pretty young. Christian Spitz keeps his eye on the prize, and when a bus or limo pulls up to the stadium, he's off and running.\n\"Mr. Zobrist, can I have your autograph? Thanks,\" Spitz said as he collected the autograph from Royals super-sub Ben Zobrist.\nSpitz doesn't discriminate. He collects Royals autographs and those from every visiting team with equal zeal.\n\"It’s really nice. The players are nice. They usually like giving autographs to kids better, but adults too,\" Spitz said.\nSpitz said he loves getting the autograph and making friends with the other collectors.\n\"I just like to be around baseball a lot. I’ve gotten to know the players and get out of town.\" collector John McFadden said.\nThese autograph hunters say there's a science involved. For example, Spitz says he know what car each player drives, like catcher Salvador Perez.\n\"He has a red Hummer and he drives a little fast. It’s pretty cool,\" Spitz said.\nAnd, he said isn't not just about collecting the signatures. It's also the chance to meet his idols.\n\"I just like watching them play and I like the way they interact. It’s going to be interesting today and I hope the Royals pull it off.,\" Spitz said.\nHe has more than 100 autographs at home. He says he'll never sell them.\nCopyright 2015 KCTV (Meredith Corp.)
