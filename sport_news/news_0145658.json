He was named the Sixth of Man of the Year after a career season, but when it came time to improve their roster, the Raptors decided to part ways with the explosive scorer.\n“That was weird,” Williams said before leading the Lakers with 19 points in a 105-97 loss to Toronto. “I’ve probably never seen that happen before.”\nThe Raptors’ decision to look for help elsewhere, however, paved the way for Williams to sign a three-year, $21 million contract with the Lakers.\nHe said he spent the day texting with Amir Johnson, and was excited to see Kyle Lowry and DeMarre Carroll, with whom he played during an earlier stop in Atlanta.\nOther than that, the 28-year-old didn’t make much of playing against his former team. It was a preseason affair, and he didn’t feel he had anything left to prove.\n“I think they pretty much know who I am,” Williams said. “They should know. But no, not tonight, I think tonight is about us getting better and for us to continue to build.”\nHis offensive performance against the Raptors was so typical that it flew under the radar compared to those of Julius Randle and Kobe Bryant.\nRandle logged his second straight impressive game, finishing with 17 points and five rebounds in 23 minutes.\nMeanwhile, Bryant scored a preseason-high 16 points on 5-of-11 shooting. In 22 minutes – the top of the range Coach Byron Scott said fans could expect Thursday night – he added three assists and two steals.\nThe Lakers were playing without Brandon Bass, who suffered a bone contusion in his left knee Tuesday, and D’Angelo Russell, who was kept out so his bruised glute, also suffered Tuesday, could continue to heal.\n“There was no need to put him out there and see how he felt and see if he can get warm and all that stuff,” Scott said of Russell. “We want to see if we can get all that to go away before we put him back out there. Hopefully that’s Sunday.”\nRussell’s absence opened the door for Williams to spend most of the night on the floor battling his former teammates.\nThe fact he was in a Lakers uniform, and not a Raptors jersey, was a matter of need versus not liking Williams’ game, Toronto coach Dwane Casey said.\n“He has a huge value,” Casey said, “but it depends on the other needs that you have on the team.”\nNick Young started in place of Russell, a calculated decision by Scott that keeps Williams as the sixth man.\n“He won a lot of games last year for us with his scoring,” Casey said. “We had nights where we had nothing going, and he would come in and change the game with his scoring. And there’s a value. There’s a huge value to that.”\nFor the Lakers, it’s not just Williams’ scoring that has turned heads..\n“I think he’s really been active defensively,” Bryant said, “using his length and trying to disturb ball-handlers. He could be really disruptive on the defensive end because of his length.”\nThe Lakers and Raptors don’t meet again until Dec. 7, and it’s possible by then Williams will be even less interested in discussing it.\n“I think everybody’s moved on,” he said. “I found a home here.”\nNOTES \nBryant declined to discuss reports of an altercation between former Lakers Matt Barnes and Derek Fisher. “I’m not getting into that one,” he said. ...\nRookie center Robert Upshaw was impressive in his Lakers debut. The 7-footer recorded the first of his two blocks 13 seconds after entering the game. He finished with six points, three rebounds and three blocks in 25 minutes. ...\nFormer Laker Tracy Murray has been working with the Lakers as a shooting coach throughout training camp. He has a contract through the middle of the month, at which point the team will decide whether to hire him full-time.\nContact the writer: boram@ocregister.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T09:06:39.064+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
