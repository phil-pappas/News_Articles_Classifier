At first glance, Week 6 appears to offer a respite. There are just two matchups between ranked teams, following a Week 5 slate that had five such games along with several more that pitted high-profile squads.\nIt’s important to remember, though, that it’s often the weeks that appear weakest on paper that end up producing the most chaos, whether it be upsets nobody saw coming or contenders being pushed to the brink. Considering how the season has gone so far, it wouldn’t surprise at all if this week brings some unexpected results. Either way, it’s fitting that Saturday’s two biggest games involve four teams that have outperformed expectations, because 2015 is unfolding as one of the most topsy-turvy seasons in recent memory.\nHere are the five biggest storylines to watch in Week 6:\n1. Michigan-Northwestern an unexpected key Big Ten battle Hardly anyone expected this to be one of the more significant games in the Big Ten this season, but the Wolverines and Wildcats have emerged as legitimate contenders in the conference's East and West division, respectively. Both teams' surprising starts have been fueled by elite defensive play. Northwestern and Michigan rank first and second in the country in scoring defense (7.0 and 7.6 points allowed per game, respectively) and fifth and second in total defense (247.4 and 184 yards allowed per game, respectively). Northwestern’s rise has been especially dramatic—the program has finished in the top 50 in total defense just once in the past five seasons.\nLinebacker Anthony Walker has emerged as a star for Pat Fitzgerald’s team, while Michigan has been led by its deep, disruptive D-line. Considering the strength of the defenses and the relative weakness of the offenses in this game, it might not be a stretch to say that the first to score a touchdown will win. Even if there are more points than that, the game could come down to whichever D can produce more momentum-shifting plays and/or turnovers. The winner will remain in strong position in its division, but the loser still has plenty of time to regroup and build on its better-than-expected start.\nTwo Minute Drill: Northwestern vs. Michigan preview Sports Illustrated's Ben Glicksman and Colin Becht preview the Week 6 matchup between the Northwestern Wildcats and the Michigan Wolverines.\n2. Cal’s improved defense looks to pass its first significant challenge Speaking of defense, Cal has struggled to field a quality one in recent years. The Bears have placed 124 th , 124 th and 95 th in total defense the last three seasons, helping result in the program’s fewest wins in a three-year stretch since 1999-01. This season Cal is 5–0, already matching last season’s win total, and while star quarterback Jared Goff and Sonny Dykes’s potent Air Raid offense rightfully get most of the headlines, the defense will likely be the key in maintaining the team’s hot start.\nThe Bears are improved so far, currently rating 72 nd in the country in total D and 78 th in yards allowed per play, but they haven’t done enough to convince anyone they have staying power. (Case in point: Texas scored a season-high 44 points in its loss to Cal in Week 3.) Utah offers Cal a chance to prove that it’s stout enough to compete all year in the Pac-12. With Devontae Booker , Travis Wilson and Co. coming off a 62-point explosion at Oregon , slowing them down will be no easy task. But Cal just has to do enough to give Goff and the offense a chance. Accomplish that, and the Bears might pull off an upset that shakes up the conference race.\n3.
