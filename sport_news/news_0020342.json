Some may say third can't be perfect because they finished 14 points behind Mt. Lakes for second. \nThat's the point; Kinnelon was racing against Villa Walsh, clearly the number one small school cross country team in New Jersey, having won that division at the Shore Coaches Invitational and Mt. Lakes who was fourth in the state in the mid-size schools race at the same meet. \nThus the Colts were right in the thick of the competition with two of the best teams in the state. \nLeading the Colts was freshman, Angelina Tarabokija who ran the Greystone course in 19:51. \n\"I decided to stay with the top five runners in the race,\" said Tarabokija who placed fifth overall in this race. \"I had a lot of confidence in myself and I knew that I could make my move on the hills, I love running up hills.\" \nGreystone is mostly a flat course but there are two steep but short hills. The last hill on the two loop course is a game changer, and obviously the runners see it twice. It seems like a 90 degree angle straight up and takes the breath away from many runners. \n\"I stayed with the front pack, including that last hill, and I really couldn't believe I broke 20:00 minutes. I am so proud that all my hard work has paid off,\" said Tarabokija. \nJust behind the freshman was junior runner Cayla Mandel. \nShe too is fond of hills, \"I had a lot of anxiety going into this race, but my coaches told me to stay calm and run my own race. So I went out and I got into a pace that I felt comfortable but when I got to the hills, I made my moves and felt really good.\" \nMandel ran the course in 21:13, which is great. The competition is so amazing in this race even though Mandel placed 17th, the entire Villa Walsh team finished ahead of her. \nThe battle for second place was so close that just 19 seconds separated Mt. Lakes from Kinnelon. Hannah Revlosky, Emma Kline, Hayden Burt all crossed the line together at about 21:45. Claire Heckler and Mackenzie Orr forced other teams into a higher finishing position. \nNot to be outdone on the boys side Chris Singer kept up his amazing year finishing fourth in the boys race in 16:48, just seconds behind overall winner Joe Dragon from High Point. \n\"My goal in this race was to stay with the top group\", said Singer echoing Tarabokija's similar strategy. \"After about a quarter mile of the race an entire field of runners go through a narrow entrance into the rest of the course so I had to be out front.\" \n\"I knew I was ahead of the Mountain Lakes and Wallkill Valley runners, and they are always competitive so I wanted to try to out run them to the finish, and I did,\" said Singer. \nThe Kinnelon Boys team placed ninth out of 22 teams. \nThe Colts Ryan Griffin ran the race in 19:10, Peter Davin and Griffin Hall both crossed the line in 19:19 and John Hamill did it in 19:22 with Kyle Kane running in 19:30. That's six Kinnelon runners in 19:30 or less. To have the seventh runner David Donker complete the course in 20:34 is very impressive. \nInterestingly both top runners from Kinnelon credited their summer running and a family feeling on the team to this year's success. Singer admitted that he listened to his coaches about running in the summer and Tarabokija, who began running in the seventh grade and now calls running \"my passion\", ran all summer as well. \nHowever Kinnelon runners were not the only local athletes having success last Tuesday. Robert White and Kurt Hill ran the race in 17:35 and 17:56 to lead Pequannock to a 14th place finish. \nButler's Matt Konopinski and Aren Kober ran 18:57 and 19:12 as the Bulldogs placed 17th. \nPequannock had a strong showing landing in 14th place behind the efforts of Karley Warden, Briana McCoy and Sophie White all running between 22:31 and 22:50 while Butler's Mellissa Konopinski and Kristen Wedemeier, both running 22:30 helped the Lady Bulldogs to a 17th place finish.
