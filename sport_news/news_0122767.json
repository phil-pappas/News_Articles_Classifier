The Huskies have added two players, Sterling Gibbs, left, and Shonn Miller, who are not only experienced players and college graduates, but standout players from their respective leagues, Gibbs from Seton Hall and the Big East, Miller from Cornell and the Ivy League. So they bring the feel of NBA free agents – proven players who should provide an immediate impact.Many of the experiences – the Husky Run, the grueling, four-hour first practice, the runs up cemetery hill – have been new for Gibbs, who had also played at Texas, and Miller. Both have experienced some form of First Night, but not the full-house, level of noise and electricity they will see Friday. So this will be another facet of the “UConn experience” for them. - DOM AMORE\nUConn has had good experiences with fifth-year transfers, but this season takes it to a new level.

Yes, the Huskies will be that good again.\nOn the men's side, following a tough season, the Huskies are looking to regain respectability. Though there are many newcomers, there are still enough players who were on the 2014 championship team and know how it feels to win – as well as the empty feeling of bowing out early last March and watching the madness from home.\nTo whet your appetite for Husky Hoops The Courant's John Altavilla and Dom Amore offer up five key points to ponder for each team. Remember, doors to Gampel open at 6 p.m. and the event is free and open to the public.\nThis photo gallery is featured in these articles: UConn Men's Basketball Insider UConn Men's Basketball Team 24th In Preseason Coaches Poll", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T10:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T20:34:51.082+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
