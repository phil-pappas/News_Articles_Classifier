What is the roadmap to a Rutgers football bowl berth? \nWithout him, Michigan State has slipped to the middle of the pack in the Big Ten, ranking No. 9 or No. 10 in the conference in points allowed per game (20.8), yards allowed per game (376.8), rushing yards allowed per game (128.0) and passing yards allowed per game (248.8). \nBut don’t be fooled. \n“Michigan State’s defense plays with great effort,” right guard Chris Muller said. “The biggest thing is they play with great effort and they play with a lot of heart. They have a lot of big guys and the coaching over there is extraordinary. They are very fundamentally sound.” \nWhile Lumpkin and Muller got a first-hand look at Michigan State last season, right tackle J.J. Denman, left guard Dorian Miller and center Derrick Nelson are first-timers. \nAnd the fivesome’s first collective look at an elite front seven didn’t go well, as Rutgers allowed five sacks and managed 1.3 yards per carry on 32 rushing attempts in a 28-3 loss to Penn State.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T00:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T04:50:36.313+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
