It's unclear if Travis had a setback, but he wasn't able to play against the Cornhuskers. The Gophers have a bye this week before playing Michigan on Oct. 31.\nKill said a medical redshirt \"may be a possibility\" for Travis, a Pensacola, Fla., native, who ranked fifth on the team last season with 67 tackles.\n\"We'll know a little bit more here in the off week, kind of where he’s at,\" Kill added, noting that Travis has yet to use a redshirt year. \"W here he’s at, and where we’re at in the season, that very well could happen.\"\nThe Gophers will hold light practices Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday this week with the primary goal of getting healthier.\n\"Our group’s glad that we’ve got an off week,\" Kill said during the Big Ten teleconference. \"We’ve gotta get some bodies healed up, and we’ve been banged up pretty good. So we’re hoping it allows us to heal up and start certainly the preparation for Michigan.\"\nOlder Post Gophers-Michigan kickoff time moved to 6 p.m. on Halloween", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T20:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T05:49:01.072+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
