Hosmer's two-out shot to right field drove in Ben Zobrist, who had singled. Jose Quintana pitched nine innings but couldn't secure his 10th victory of the year.\nOn the mound\nQuintana gave up three runs on homers to Alex Gordon and Mike Moustakas.\nAt the plate\nTyler Flowers matched a career high with four hits, including the game-tying RBI double in the eighth off Kelvin Herrera.\nOn the brink\nJose Abreu hit his 30th homer of the season to center field in the seventh inning, joining Albert Pujols and Ryan Braun as the only players in major-league history to hit at least 30 homers in each of their first two seasons.\nKey number\n3.36 — Quintana's ERA over a career-high 206 1/3 innings. He is the first Sox pitcher to record three straight seasons of at least 200 innings pitched, 30 starts and 160 strikeouts since Javier Vazquez from 2006-08.\nThe Quote:\n\"I haven't helped him out. I've blown a couple of his games, so he should have 10 (victories). It's unfortunate. I wish I would have been better at my job so that he had 10 wins, but his innings, his ERA, strikeouts, walks, everything shows he's a quality pitcher and he gets the job done.\" — Robertson on Quintana\nThe Quote: II\n\"That's my first goal every year, to have 200 innings, to be healthy all season. I'm happy with my first goal. But it's not about me. It's about the team, and we'll try next year. We'll have a better year.\" — Quintana\nUp next\nVs.
