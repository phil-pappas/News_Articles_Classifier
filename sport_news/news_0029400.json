LOUIS — To all of you Cubs fans out there — heck, to all of you Cardinals fans, too — Joe Maddon has a message. Worry. Twist yourselves into knots over heading to Chicago down 2-0 in the National League Division Series and facing elimination from the playoffs (if you root for the Cubs), or up 2-0 and needing that last elusive win to advance (if you root for the Cards), or tied 1-1 with the realization this best-of-5 series is suddenly best-of-3. Drive yourself and everyone around you crazy. “The fans should always worry,” Maddon said Saturday afternoon, before he managed the Cubs in Game 2 at Busch Stadium. “It’s always the prerogative of a fan to worry. That’s what barrooms are for. That’s what little forums are for online in this 21st Century stuff. Go ahead and worry as much as you’d like.” But Maddon won’t join you. He wants to win even more than you do. Ultra-competitive people are like that. But he isn’t worried about winning. In fact, Maddon swears he has not even one time talked to his players about the importance of winning. It’s not about outcome, Maddon repeated. It’s about the process. That alone might be enough to give true Cubs fans nervous breakdowns. When your team has not won a World Series since 1908, nor even played in one since 1945, it’s all about the outcome. There is no room for one more second wasted on one more process for a franchise that has institutionalized the process of failure for 70, 90, or even 107 years. When all you want is to see the Cubs win one stinking World Series in your lifetime, outcome is the sun and the moon, the alpha and the omega and the kitchen sink. Worry about winning and losing? “Man,” Maddon said, “I just can’t live that way. I don’t vibrate at that frequency.” The reality is that winning and losing are by-products of a process, and there are no guarantees. If your process is solid, your chances of winning are enhanced, but you might lose. If your process stinks, the likelihood of winning diminishes, but you might get lucky. Maddon trusts the process that Cubs president of baseball operations Theo Epstein began implementing four years ago. Maddon also believes in the daily process he has placed in the Cubs clubhouse and which manifests itself on the field. And Maddon is fearless because, he said, “The process is fearless.” His style and belief system are as much lifestyle choices as they are a formula for baseball success. Page 2 of 2 - “If you want to always live your life just based on the outcome, you’re going to be fearful a lot,” Maddon said. “And when you’re doing that, you’re really not living in a particular moment. Then, of course, you’re going to be, like, I’m 60 now, and then 20 years from now, by the time I’m 80, if I’ve just been worried about outcomes, I’m going to miss a lot.” So from his first day as Cubs manager last October, Maddon has instilled in his players the importance of living in the present. Win or lose a game, spend 30 minutes celebrating or cussing, then drop it and move on. Don’t think about tomorrow. Attack today, one second at a time. “If you take care of the seconds,” Maddon said, “the minutes, the hours take care of themselves.” Maddon is almost evangelical, the way he preaches process. But he is aware that preaching from the bully pulpit of the skipper’s office, or from the front of a clubhouse meeting, resonates only so far. He is well aware the players watch to see whether there’s a walk to match his talk. “When the players look in the corner of the dugout, what do I look like?” he said. “How do I walk in the door after a tough moment?” Maddon said he even views news conferences as team meetings, because the players watch TV, listen to talk radio, read newspapers and magazines and the Internet. Therefore, his message is constant and consistent. “And it will remain consistent,” he said. Stay true to the process, and good things will happen. Lots of good things already have happened to the Cubs this year, as they won 97 games, reached the playoffs for the first time since 2008 and won a postseason game for the first time since 2003. The chances for the Cubs to play in — and perhaps win — a World Series have blossomed. For the first time in my lifetime, the Cubs appear to be going about this baseball business in a way that makes sense. Go ahead and worry, if you prefer. But realize, there’s good reason to have faith in the process. KIRK WESSLER is Journal Star executive sports editor/columnist. He can be reached at kwessler@pjstar.com, or 686-3216.
