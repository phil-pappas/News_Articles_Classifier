Spurs fall in Aldridge’s debut 1 / 6 Back to Gallery SACRAMENTO, Calif. – LaMarcus Aldridge tugged at his brand new No. 12 black and silver jersey Thursday, leaned over the scorer’s table and smiled.\n“It’s weird,” Aldridge said. “It’s very weird.”\nAldridge’s new basketball home, it turns out, will take some getting used to.\nIn his first game with his new team, Aldridge scored eight points on 3-for-10 shooting as the Spurs lost their preseason opener 95-92 to Sacramento at Sleep Train Arena.\nWith Tim Duncan, Tony Parker, Manu Ginobili, Boris Diaw and coach Gregg Popovich all remaining in San Antonio, the Spurs showed only a fraction of the roster Kings coach George Karl said might be the best in the NBA.\nKawhi Leonard led the Spurs with 16 points, with Kyle Anderson chipping in 15.\nRudy Gay finished with 26 points for the Kings, who were playing its third preseason game in four nights.\njmcdonald@express-news.net\nTwitter: @JMcDonald_SAEN", "external_links": ["http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/33/07/8761832/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/33/07/8761827/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/33/07/8761831/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/33/07/8761827/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/33/07/8761828/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/33/07/8761826/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/33/07/8761830/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/33/07/8761832/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/33/07/8761826/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/33/07/8761828/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/33/07/8761830/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/33/07/8761831/3/920x920.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-09T07:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T08:38:18.372+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
