The sophomore quarterback was in awe that his 1-yard touchdown run with 9.9 seconds left in the game proved the difference in the Panthers’ 32-28 victory over Northside on Friday night. “I can’t believe we won,” Hall said. “It’s big for my team.” Indeed it was as the Panthers moved into sole possession of first place in the East Central 2-A Conference with the win over the Monarchs, the league’s four-time defending champions. East Duplin (7-2, 3-0) has won five consecutive games entering next week’s home game with Croatan (7-2, 2-1). Conversely, the Monarchs (2-7, 2-1), saw their 26-game ECC winning streak end. Northside finally got official word Friday from the NCHSAA that it had to forfeit its first four wins of season after it reported the use of an ineligible player. Northside travels to North Brunswick (5-3, 2-1) next week. “I think this win gives the kids a confidence boost,” East Duplin coach Battle Holley said. “They’ve worked hard, those seniors have, and they’ve put in a lot of time over four years.” With the Panthers trailing 28-25, Hall scored the winning touchdown on third-and-goal. With no timeouts, the Panthers scrambled for runs of 4 and 1 yards to the 1 without a huddle before Hall took the snap and looped around the left side to find the end zone. “I turned around and got a touchdown,” Hall said. The Monarchs got the ball back at their own 17-yard line with 5.5 seconds left. After an incomplete pass, Jake Erickson threw a short pass to Jonte McMullen, who carried the ball to the Northside 45 before being brought down as time expired. “We have to play defense,” Northside coach Bob Eason said. “We didn’t play great defense and that’s a testament to Northside is playing good defense and we didn’t do that.” It did take a great defensive play late by the Panthers to give them new life. Trailing 28-25, East Duplin was stopped on downs at the Northside 8 with 6:46 left. However, the Panthers forced the Monarchs to a third-and-7 from the Northside 35. On the play, East Duplin senior Jarvious Scarborough intercepted an Erickson pass, giving the Panthers the ball back at their own 30 with 4:23 left. “I just read my man,” Scarborough said. “I had it coming down.” The Panthers then reached the Monarchs’ 40, but faced third-and-11. That’s when Scarborough completed a pass to Hall to the Northside 12 on a reverse pass. Five plays later, Hall scored the winning touchdown. Page 2 of 3 - “We were trying to get some first downs and drive it down, but then we had some penalties,” Eason said. “Tonight we had two turnovers and penalties in inopportune times, and East Duplin is a good team that took advantage of them.” The teams went back-and-forth in the second half as the lead changed five times after halftime. Northside took a 28-25 lead with 10:38 remaining on a 5-yard touchdown run by McMullen that was set up by a 68-yard run to the East Duplin 5 by Dwayne Washington. The Panthers had taken a 25-22 lead 1:01 into the fourth quarter on a 30-yard field goal by Ty Blizzard – his second field goal of the game. Overall, the teams combined for 917 yards of total offense – 489 from East Duplin to Northside’s 428. Tyran Outlaw led the Panthers with 190 yards on 20 carries, including a 48-yard scoring run late in the third quarter that tied the game at 22-22. Outlaw, a senior, had 153 yards on 13 carries in the second half. “Tyran ran hard,” Holley said. “All of our guys ran hard, but he ran possessed in the second half.” Chris Benson added 85 yards and also had a 67-yard touchdown reception in the first quarter while Scarborough had 74 for the Panthers, who shot themselves in the foot in the first half with false start penalties before exploding for several big gains in the second half. “They didn’t do a single thing we weren’t ready for,” Eason said. “We just didn’t make the plays.” Washington, a junior, led Northside with 152 yards, including 97 in the second half. He scored on a 1-yard touchdown run as time expired to end the second quarter to give the Monarchs a 14-9 lead. Washington’s touchdown, which capped a 7-play, 77-yard drive in just 46.4 seconds, gave the Monarchs the momentum and followed a 25-yard field goal by Blizzard that gave East Duplin a 9-7 lead. Northside seemed poised to continue their surge when Rashawn Canady returned the second-half kickoff 96 yards for a touchdown, but the score was called back because of a block in back, resulting in the Monarchs starting the third quarter at its own 6. The Panthers forced a three-and-out, and then marched 58 yards in eight plays to take a 15-14 lead midway through the third quarter on a 5-yard scoring run by Benson. The Monarchs responded on a short touchdown run by Erickson and his ensuring two-point conversion pass to Jaquavius Wooten to retake the lead at 22-15, but the Panthers didn’t back down. “We told the guys, ‘See you can play with them so let’s finish this thing off,’” Holley said. “Let’s play four quarters, and in the end, that’s what they did.” Page 3 of 3 - Now the Panthers control their own destiny as they try to win the ECC title for the first time since 2010. Not bad, given East Duplin has gone 9-14 the last two seasons and failed to make the playoffs last year. “They fought hard just like we fought hard,” Scarborough said. “We worked too hard to lose.” Northside 0 14 8 6 — 28 East Duplin 6 3 13 10 — 32 First Quarter E – Benson 67 pass from Hall (run failed), 4:25 Second Quarter N – McMullen 13 run (Reyes kick), 11:54 E – FG, Blizzard 25, 0:54.2 N – Washington 1 run, Reyes kick), 0:00 Third Quarter E – Benson 5 run (run failed), 5:55 N – Erickson 1 run (Wooten pass from Erickson), 4:52 E – Outlaw 48 run (Blizzard kick), 4:29 Fourth Quarter E – FG, Blizzard 30, 10:59 N – McMullen 5 run (kick failed), 10:38 E – Hall 1 run (Blizzard kick), 0:09.9 NS ED", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T15:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T14:15:53.529+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
