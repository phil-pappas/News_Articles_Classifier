Crowe Public Safety Award during the Diocese of San Bernardino's annual Blue Mass at Our Lady of the Rosary Cathedral in San Bernardino on Thursday Oct. 8, 2015. , MILKA SOKO, CONTRIBUTING PHOTOGRAPHER Related article » Honoring healthcare providers The Diocese of San Bernardino is also honoring healthcare providers at a 3 p.m. White Mass Sunday, Oct. 18, at the Christ of the Redeemer Parish, 12745 Oriole Ave., Grand Terrace.\nThose being awarded are: Dr. Vellore Muraligopal, a neonatologist who has practices for 39 years; Jose Macias, a licensed vocational nurse at Desert Regional Hospital; Sister Christine Schleich with Congregation of Sisters of St. Joseph of Orange; and Rodney Koenig, a physician's assistant at Community Hospital of San Bernardino.\nSan Bernardino County Sheriff’s Detective David Clifford believes that he wouldn’t be a successful policeman without his Catholic faith.\nWorking in the Crimes Against Children Detail, Clifford, 43, of Highland, has to grapple with traumatic cases. In one child-abuse investigation, Clifford dealt with 16 victims of physical, sexual, and emotional abuse.\nIn such situations, Clifford said his faith helps guide him in the right path.\n“(Jesus Christ) helps steer me in the right direction, in the right mindset when I’m doing my investigations and helping victims all the way through, offering words of condolence and then supporting them when they need help from a legal standpoint,” Clifford said.\nOn Thursday, Oct. 8, Clifford was awarded the Chief Patrick G. Crowe Public Safety Award during the annual Blue Mass at Our Lady of the Rosary Cathedral in San Bernardino. The Mass honors police officers, deputies, firefighters, and other public-safety workers.\n“God calls us all to serve one another,” said Bishop Gerald Barnes of the Diocese of San Bernardino, who presided at the Mass.\nAbout 70 people attended, including county fire officials and law enforcement personnel with the Colton Police Department and San Bernardino County Sheriff’s Department. As part of the Mass, Barnes blessed the badges of law enforcement officers.\nClifford said the recognition means his hard work hasn’t gone unnoticed.\n“I feel like I’ve given them (victims) some closure to their cases because this award is not about my name or my department. It’s about the victims that we’ve helped,” Clifford said.\nHe was accompanied by his wife and two daughters.\nThe history of the Blue Mass is attributed to Rev. Thomas Dade, a priest from the Archdiocese of Baltimore, who initiated the Catholic Police and Fireman’s Society while assigned to St. Patrick Catholic Church in Washington D.C. The first Blue Mass is dated to 1934.\nBarnes brought the northeastern U.S. tradition to the Diocese in 2002. Since then, more than a dozen public safety workers have been awarded.\nEach year the Mass alternates between Riverside and San Bernardino counties, which fall under the Diocese of San Bernardino.\nThe Diocese also is holding an upcoming White Mass to honor healthcare providers. A Red Mass, recognizing those in the legal profession, was held on Tuesday, Oct. 6, to honor Barbara Keough, partner in the Ontario office of Cota Cole.\nContact the writer: 951-368-9462 or amolina@pe.com", "external_links": ["http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/twitter-ico.jpg", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/fb-ico.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nvyrpz-b88534479z.120151009103756000gqucg2i1.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nvyrq0-b88534479z.120151009103756000gqscg2tu.10.jpg", "http://assets.pinterest.com/js/pinmarklet.js?r=", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nvyrq0-b88534479z.120151009103756000gqscg302.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nvyrpz-b88534479z.120151009103756000gqscg312.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nvyrq0-b88534479z.120151009103756000gqscg302.10.jpg", "http://s7.addthis.com/js/250/addthis_widget.js#username=YOUR-ACCOUNT-ID", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/mail-ico.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nvyrpz-b88534479z.120151009103756000gqscg312.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nvyrpz-b88534479z.120151009103756000gqucg2i1.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nvyrq0-b88534479z.120151009103756000gqscg2tu.10.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T04:04:03.621+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
