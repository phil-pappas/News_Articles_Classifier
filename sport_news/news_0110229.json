The winning streak is the third longest in the country behind No. 1 Ohio State (20 games) and No. 4 TCU (15 games). \nDane Evans was 24 of 36 passing for 421 yards and four touchdowns for the Golden Hurricane (3-4, 0-3). Keyarris Garrett had 14 catches for a career-high 268 yards and three touchdowns. \nBoth in the top 10 nationally in total offense, the teams combined for 1,248 yards of offense in the wild back-and-forth affair. \nIn addition to the career bests by Lynch and Garrett, sophomore Doroland Dorceus had a career-high 150 yards rushing and two touchdowns for Memphis. Jamarius Henderson added 119 yards on the ground and two scores on 14 carries. \nBut it was Lynch, the junior who guided the Tigers to a 37-24 win over No. 24 Mississippi a week ago, who once again shined the brightest — throwing touchdown passes of 58, 45, 21 and 5 yards in the win. He also ran for a 3-yard touchdown to put Memphis up 49-35 in the third quarter. \nTigers coach Justin Fuente was concerned earlier in the week how Memphis would respond following last week's dramatic win over its Southeastern Conference neighbor to the south, even seeking out advice from former Texas coach Mack Brown and TCU coach Gary Patterson. \nAny concerns Fuente had were finally put to rest in the second half after Tulsa closed to 42-35 on Evans' an 80-yard touchdown pass to Josh Atkinson. \nFollowing the score, the Tigers outscored the Golden Hurricane 24-7 to close out the game — with Henderson capping the scoring with a 20-yard touchdown run with less than two minutes remaining. \nMemphis led 35-14 late in the first half and appeared to have the game under control. However, Tulsa's last-second prayer was answered to end the half when Evans' desperation pass was tipped by two defenders and fell into the arms of Garrett for a 46-yard touchdown end the half. \nLynch tried to end any Tulsa momentum early in the second half, completing a 45-yard pass to Mose Frazier that set up a 1-yard scoring run by Dorceus to put the Tigers up 42-21. \nEvans responded with a 32-yard touchdown pass to Garrett on the next drive, and following a Memphis punt, he then found Atkinson for the 80-yard score to close the lead to 42-35. \nTulsa had 544 yards of total offense, but Lynch and the Tigers had 704 yards of their own. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T06:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T07:42:36.343+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
