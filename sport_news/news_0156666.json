The line also paved the way for four rushing touchdowns and a 4.8 yards per carry average on the ground. \n\"The Chiefs have one of the best pass rushers in the league in Justin Houston and our offensive line answered,\" said Dalton, who completed 17 of 24 passes for 321 yards, one touchdown and no interceptions. \"They contained him well. The result was that I didn't get hit much today.\" \nHouston had 22.5 sacks last season, three in the first three games this season and 36 in the last 30 games, but was held in check primarily by right tackle Smith, who said Dalton's ability to get rid of the ball quickly helped him. \n\"That and good technique,\" said Smith. \"I love the challenge of going up against guys like him. It was fun.\" \nDefense: Defensive line. \nThe Skinny: Each of the four Bengals' starting defensive linemen (ends Carlos Dunlap and Michael Johnson and tackles Geno Atkins and Domata Peko) recorded at least one sack and the foursome combined for five after the Bengals didn't have a single game last year where the entire team recorded more than three sacks. \nPeko recorded two sacks; Johnson had one sack, a pass defended, a forced fumble and two other quarterback hits; Atkins had a sack, a tackle for loss on a running play and another quarterback hit and Dunlap had a sack and another quarterback hit. Backup defensive end Wallace Gilberry added a tackle for loss on an end around and backup defensive tackle Pat Sims recorded a quarterback hit. \n\"We feed off each other and play well together and it's just another day when we went out there and had fun,\" said Johnson, who played for Tampa Bay last season after playing with the Bengals from 2009-13. \"Last time I was here that was pretty much how we would try to do it every week. That's the goal. One of us gets one, it's like all of us, let's get one.\" \nBengals head coach Marvin Lewis said he likes the way the line has played all season. \n\"We've gotten pressure in each game, whether it be with pressures of four-man, three-man, five-man, six-man,\" said Lewis. \"We did a good job today.\" \nCOACHING GRADE \nThe Skinny: Solid game results in A-minus. \nThis had all the makings of a classic trap game, with the emotional, hard-fought win at AFC North rival Baltimore last week and two-time NFC Champ Seattle coming to Paul Brown Stadium this Sunday, but the Bengals were sharp early (an 80-yard TD drive on each of their first two possessions) and overcame a mid-game offensive lull. \n\"I was pleased with what we did in the second half today,\" said Lewis. \"We came out and got a stop on defense and got rolling on offense. We were able to put the ball back in and got it back up to two-score lead. That's the first time this season that we've been able to do that (in the third quarter). We showed some confidence and poise in doing that.\" \nThe Bengals entered the game having been outscored 14-12 in the third quarter this season, but outscored Kansas City in the third quarter, 15-3. \nYes, the Chiefs gained a lot of yards, but there's something to be said about the fact they didn't reach the end zone either as the Bengals \"Red Zone\" defense was outstanding. \nTHREE THINGS I LIKED \n-- The Bengals \"Red Zone\" defense. \nThe Skinny: Kansas City reached the Bengals \"Red Zone,\" three times in the game and came away without a touchdown. The Bengals entered the game ranked 22nd in the NFL in \"Red Zone,\" defense, having allowed four touchdowns in six trips in the first three games. \n\"You get a little shorter and tighter windows when the ball gets down in there, so when the tighter windows and tighter passes happen, you have (to make plays),\" said Lewis. \"The defense gains a little advantage when you get down in there.\" \nDefensive tackle Domata Peko said some of the success was simply due to desire. \n\"Just having that will inside of you to stop them,\" said Peko. \"Inside our huddle we talked to each other and said, 'Hey we're not giving up six points, we're not giving up six points, hold them to a field goal if we can and we did that today.\" -- Jeremy Hill running powerfully on his three touchdowns and two-point conversion run. \nThe Skinny: Hill appeared to run very tentatively last week in Baltimore after losing two fumbles and getting benched in the second half of the game against San Diego the week before, but looked to be back to his old self against the Chiefs. \nOn the first touchdown run he broke through one tackle and bulled past another to complete an eight-yard TD, then ran through a couple of tacklers on his five-yard third-quarter TD run and burst into the end zone almost untouched from a yard out for his third TD. On the two-point conversion he lowered his shoulder and then reached the ball across the goal line. \nHill had said on Thursday that all he could do was keeping \"grinding,\" and good things would eventually happen, and told fantasy football owners he wasn't worried about his own stats, just about whether or not the team won games. He said on Sunday he hoped fantasy owners stayed in his corner. \n\"I guess you can say that's how this league goes,\" said Hill. \"They were ready to crucify me last week and now they're probably happy now. It comes with the territory. I don't really worry about that stuff. I laugh at that stuff. They don't know what it's like, but I can't really blame them.\" \nHill said Dalton took some of the pressure off him by joking with him about going through a sophomore slump and telling him he was already washed up. \n\"I kept asking him, 'What happened to Jeremy Hill?,'\" said Dalton. \"Jeremy played like he is capable today. We haven't forgotten what he brings to this team.\" \n-- Brandon Tate's spectacular catch and presence of mind to get up and finish it off by racing into the end zone. \nThe Skinny: Early in the third quarter with the Bengals faced with third-and-11 from their own 45, Dalton was flushed from the pocket, rolled right and spotted Tate deep down the right side and let fly. Tate dove to catch the pass at the Kansas City 8, scrambled to his feet and raced into the end zone to complete the 55-yard touchdown pass and give the Bengals a 21-12 lead. \n\"What great field awareness he had to get get up immediately and score,\" said Dalton. \"That play made an impact at that point in the game.\" \nThe reception was Tate's first of the season. \n\"When he gets and opportunity, he always takes advantage of it,\" said Lewis. \"It was a nice job by him.\" \nTHREE THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE \n-- The Chiefs rolling up 461 yards of total offense. \nThe Skinny: Give the Bengals credit for keeping the Chiefs out of the end zone, but that makes 859 yards the defense allowed in the last two games. \nSome of the yardage on Sunday was due to missed tackles and the fact that not only was starting safety George Iloka out, but cornerback Adam Jones missed almost the entire second half due to a groin injury and cornerback Dre Kirkpatrick played with a right wrist injury and struggled in coverage. \n\"We have to play solid defense,\" said safety Reggie Nelson. \"We can't give up too many yards. I had two bad angles at the middle of the field. They shouldn't have even have got the field goals if we tackle that slant and that post.\" \nSaid Michael Johnson: \"We would like to keep the yardage down and improve on that, but we did do a good job of holding them to field goals and we feel like if we do that we give ourselves a pretty good opportunity to win.\" \n-- Wide receiver Marvin Jones dropping a touchdown pass. \nThe Skinny: Jones had a couple of pivotal catches in last week's win in Baltimore, including a touchdown reception, but against the Chiefs he had just one reception for four yards and dropped what would have been a 54-yard touchdown pass in the third quarter. \n\"I was expecting it to drop in my hands and it went off the back of my right shoulder instead,\" said Jones. \"I just missed it. That rarely happens to me, but it happened.\" \nJones said it won't be long before he gets a chance to atone for it, because the Bengals are becoming increasingly hard to defend with the multitude of offensive weapons they have. \n\"With the explosive players we have on our team, coach says you never know it could be your time, or his time, or his time,\" said Jones. \"Every game someone different can be explosive. I'm going to get more chances.\" \n-- The team committing 11 penalties for 84 yards, all after the first quarter. \nThe Skinny: There were six penalties called on the offense, three on the defense and two on special teams. Of the six penalties on the offense, five were on offensive linemen: a false start and illegal shift on Smith; a hold on Whitworth; a hold on Zeitler and an unnecessary roughness penalty on Bodine. \n\"You'll have those games where you get flagged and can't really get an explanation,\" said Whitworth. \"It is what it is. It's part of what you overcome throughout the season. Today was an opportunity for us to overcome the penalties and still win.\" \nTHREE STATS/NUMBERS OF NOTE \n-- 13 minutes, 46 seconds: The difference in time of possession the Chiefs had the ball and the Bengals had the ball. That's almost a full quarter longer that Kansas City had possession, but it still lost by 15 points. \n-- 4: While three might be the magic number ( according to Schoolhouse Rock ), four is the magic number from this game. The Bengals opened the season with four straight wins for just the fourth time in franchise history (1975, 1988 and 2005 were the other three times). It marked the fourth straight game that quarterback Andy Dalton had a quarterback rating higher than 100.0, something he had never done before in his career and he only had a rating of 100.0 or higher four times all last season. The Bengals were 4 for 4 in scoring touchdowns in the \"Red Zone.\" Unfortunately the only negative to this number was kicker Mike Nugent missing a field goal from 44 yards out in the second quarter when he hit the left upright. \n-- 123.0: Dalton's quarterback rating through four games. His rating has been at least 115.9 or higher each game. He opened with that rating at Oakland, followed it up with a 126.1 against San Diego, a 122.3 at Baltimore and then a 127.1 against Kansas City. He has completed 67.7 percent of his passes for 1,187 yards, nine touchdowns and one interception. He is on pace to throw for 4,748 yards, 36 touchdowns and only four interceptions. The single-season team record for passing yards is 4,293 set by Dalton in 2013 and for touchdown passes it's 33 set by Dalton in 2013. \n\"We're proud of him,\" said Whitworth. \"We've always believed in him. We're excited he's our quarterback and excited to see where he leads us.\" \nSaid Adam Jones: \"I'm Andy's No. 1 fan. I'm happy for No. 14. I've always believed in this guy.\" \nDalton deflected the praise of him. \n\"We've got a lot of guys who can make plays,\" said Dalton. \"A number of players got involved today. That is what I expect from this offense.\" \nTHREE QUOTES OF NOTE \n-- Bengals wide receiver A.J. Green on what the 4-0 start means: \"This team right here, we're straight tunnel vision. The whole season: on to the next one.\" \n-- Michael Johnson on his hit on Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce that caused a fumble that Nelson recovered and returned 25 yards to set up Hill's five yard TD run that put the Bengals up 29-15: \"I was just trying to run to the ball, get a good hit on him and try to get him down. I was just trying to put a hat on him. From the reaction I saw my teammates scrambling. I was already celebrating, because I knew it was a stop and I was just happy we stopped them on third down, but to get the ball out is a plus. (Nelson) did a great job recovering the ball, and the offense did a great job coming down and punching it in to give us a little more cushion.\" \n-- Peko on the sack dance he did following his second sack of the game in which he rubbed his belly: \"It's just a belly dance man, because I'm a fat guy. I'm 300 pounds, 325. I'm hungry; I'm just telling you, 'Hey, I'm eating and my stomach is getting full making plays. It's just a big man, 330-pounder moving around.\" \nUP NEXT \nSunday, Oct. 11 vs. Seattle Seahawks, 1 p.m. in Paul Brown Stadium. \nThe Skinny: For the second straight week the Bengals will be catching a team after it played on Monday night as Seattle hosts Detroit, but this is the two-time defending NFC Champion they will be facing this time. Seattle started the season 0-2 with back-to-back road losses at St. Louis (37-34 in overtime) and at Green Bay 27-17 before hammering the Chicago Bears at home last Sunday, 26-0. It should be noted that Chicago had Jimmy Clausen starting at quarterback and Seattle held the Bears to 146 total yards and seven first downs. In the first two games, Seattle allowed an average 20 first downs and 356.5 yards per game. Running back Marshawn Lynch was held to 128 yards and 3.4 yards per carry and quarterback Russell Wilson is averaging just 9.8 yards per completion (for comparison sake, Dalton is averaging 15.2 yards per completion). \nFollow us on Twitter @Local12 and LIKE us on Facebook for updates! \nTo get \"The Skinny\" on local sports be sure to follow Local12 Digital Sports Columnist/Editor Richard Skinner on Twitter @Local12Skinny and LIKE him on Facebook for updates or email him raskinner@sbgtv.com.
