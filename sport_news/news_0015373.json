(AP) — Florida freshman defensive back Deiondre Porter was suspended indefinitely Wednesday following his arrest for allegedly firing a gun in the direction of his pregnant girlfriend.\nOne of the team's top special teams players, Porter was arrested on four felony charges. He is being held on a $160,000 bond in the Alachua County Jail.\nThe incident occurred at 2:15 a.m. on Sept. 29, three days after the eighth-ranked Gators beat rival Tennessee in Gainesville. Porter did not play the last two weeks.\nThe Gators announced Porter's suspension on Twitter, and coach Jim McElwain addressed it on the Southeastern Conference coaches call.\n\"He's no longer with the football team,\" McElwain said. \"He's suspended indefinitely for obviously a choice. It's his choice not to be with us. I'm sure you'll read about it soon enough. It's one of those things that we don't obviously condone. Like I said, it was his choice.\"\nAccording to a Gainesville Police report, Porter confronted his girlfriend of two years in the early hours of Sept. 29 and accused her of being romantically involved with a teammate.\nPorter's girlfriend denied the relationship, according to the report, and Porter later pointed a gun at her head and demanded she tell him the truth. The woman was 10 weeks pregnant, and police said Porter was aware of the baby.\nThe woman made numerous attempts to contact the teammate, and told Porter she would try again later in the morning. Porter and his girlfriend fell asleep in separate rooms, according to the report.\nSeveral hours later, Porter resumed his accusations, became enraged and fired the gun in her direction, according to the report. The bullet lodged in the wall where she was leaning.\nPorter left the apartment a short time later, according to police.\nGainesville Police later found a bullet hole in the wall near the front door and a .45-caliber shell casing under a chair in the living room.\nThe next day, police contacted Porter. He was a passenger in a vehicle. The driver, a friend of Porter's, was found in possession of a .45-caliber handgun.\nAlachua County court records show one charge of aggravated battery (second-degree felony), one charge of firing a weapon into a vehicle or building (third-degree felony) and two charges of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon without intent to kill (third-degree felony).\nPorter also was charged with property damage of less than $200, a second-degree misdemeanor.\nPorter has played in four games this season, registering two tackles.\n———\nAP college football website: collegefootball.ap.org", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T22:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T21:39:45.302+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
