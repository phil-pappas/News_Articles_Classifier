The highlights for many fans, of course, are the Scotties Tournament of Hearts in Grand Prairie, Alta., Feb. 20-28 and the Tim Hortons Brier at TD Place from March 5-13.\nOver the next few months, we'll start to get a much better idea of who will be on the ice for the Olympic trials Dec. 2-10, 2017 at the Canadian Tire Centre.\nWith that in mind, here are 10 big roaring-game storylines as the action on the ice heats up:\nGAMES ON\nSince curling was added to the Olympic program in 1998, the Winter Games have been the clear No. 1 target for all the top teams.\nThe road to Pyeongchang, Korea in 2018 started at the beginning of this season as the battle begins to become one of nine (men's and women's) Canadian teams to earn a berth at the Roar of the Rings at the CTC.\nWe'll find out the first team in each division at the Canada Cup, Dec. 2-6 in Grande Prairie. The men's and women's winners at that event will lock down spots at the Games trials.\nTwo more spots are available for the winners of the 2016 Hearts and Brier, provided they go on to earn a medal at the ensuing world championships.\nBROOMHAHA\nThe biggest story earlier in the year has been the development of so-called directional brooms.\nNew technology, it seems, has allowed certain brooms to almost act as joysticks, allowing off-line shots to get right back on target.\nWhile there are no rules against the 'directional fabric,' it is a concern. At a bonspiel in Toronto earlier this year, 22 top rinks signed a document saying they wouldn't use the brooms at World Curling Tour or Grand Slam events.\nBut one has to think a governing body will need to make some sort of ruling to ensure all teams are on a level playing field.\n\"The problem is there's no rule against it right now,\" longtime powerhouse skip Glenn Howard told The Canadian Press. \"It's not as if you're cheating. It just doesn't seem right.\"\nMOTIVATED MEN\nTwo of the heavyweight skips have plenty of incentive to try to break frustrating droughts this season.\nNewfoundland's Brad Gushue has done pretty much everything in the sport — except win the Brier. If he can capture the elusive title this year in the capital, he'd form Team Canada for next year's Canadian championship, which just happens to be right at home in St. John's, N.L. That would make a guaranteed great party even better.\nMeanwhile, Manitoba's Mike McEwen enjoyed an unprecedented season of success last year on the cash circuit. However, once again, he fell short at the provincial championship, denying the skip a first appearance at the Brier.\nIf he finally can come out of the province this year, he'll play the Brier in the city he got married — home to his wife, Dawn McEwen, a member of Jennifer Jones' Olympic gold foursome. Mike certainly would have plenty of fans at Lansdowne.\nONTARRRR-IO!\nOnce again, it won't be easy to earn a Scotties or Brier berth out of this province.\nOn the women's side, 2013-14 national champ Rachel Homan of Ottawa has to return to the provincial competition after finishing third at the Scotties last year.\nWhile Homan's rink is off to a great start to the season and certainly will be favoured in Brampton in January, she will face stiff competition from the likes of veteran Sherry Middaugh and surprise 2015 champ Julie Hastings, who showed well in her Scotties debut last year.\nThe men's scene, meanwhile, has seen drastic changes. After not even qualifying for provincials last year, Howard shook up his rink, adding son Scott and veteran Wayne Middaugh.\nThe 2014 champ, Mark Kean, had a mass exodus from his rink and comes back with a new look. John Epping, another regular contender, also shuffled his roster.\nThe men's Tankard is in Brantford.\nUP NORTH\nNorthern Ontario now has rinks in the Brier and the Scotties — and the region could contend in both events.\nSudbury's Tracy Fleury (formerly Horgan before getting married this summer) skipped the first Northern Ontario rink last year at the Scotties and fell just short of the playoffs after pre-qualifying, losing a tight match to Homan in the final draw of the round-robin.\nMeanwhile, 2014 Olympic champ Brad Jacobs of Sault Ste. Marie is a serious contender — and ended last season with a big win over McEwen in the Players' Championship. Of course, he'll have to advance out of Northern Ontario — where several other solid teams reside — to get back to the Brier.\nRIGHT AT HOME?\nOttawa-raised John Morris started off as the skip of Team Canada last year after taking over Kevin Koe's rink, but ended up at third when the squad was in jeopardy at the Brier.\nThe move worked wonders at Pat Simmons took the helm and guided the team to a championship, giving Morris a shot at a Brier homecoming this year.\nHowever, the team settled for bronze at the 2015 worlds in Halifax and hasn't hit top gear at several events.\nLOCAL CONNECTIONS\nMorris might not be the only non-Ontario player to receive good support at TD Place. Ottawa's Craig Savill, booted off Howard's team this season, has hooked up with Nova Scotia's Shawn Adams after rules were changed this year allowing one out-of-province player on each team.\nHowever, the Nova Scotia winner will have to enter the pre-qualifying round — a format that will be scrapped in 2018 — to make it into the main draw.\nMeanwhile, in Quebec, Gatineau skip Jean-Michel Menard has gone to the Brier the past three years and won national gold in 2006.\nDavid Mathers of Ottawa, a member of Kean's Ontario championship rink last year, is now a part of PEI young gun Adam Casey's squad.\nINTERNATIONAL INCIDENT\nCanadian men's teams have been at the top of the pecking order (albeit without a gold at the worlds last season), but it's a different story on the women's side.\nA glance at the World Curling Tour's Order of Merit sees five international teams and five Canadian teams in the top 10.\nNot since 2008 has a Canadian women's team (Jones) won world gold and since then, three Swiss teams have stood atop the podium — Mirjam Ott, Biana Feltscher and Alina Paetz. What's more, Switzerland's Silvana Tirinzoni upset Homan in the first Grand Slam final of this season.\nAt last year's season-ending Players' Championship, Scotland's Eve Muirhead beat Russia's Anna Sidorova in an all-international final.\nJones, Homan and Alberta's Val Sweeting certainly are among the best in the world, but there have been significant improvements around the world.\nTHAT NEXT STEP\nSweeting has finished as runner-up at the last two Scotties, including last year's heartbreaker against Jones in Moose Jaw, Sask. — the province where Sweeting was born.\nThis year, she hopes to get another chance to move up on the podium in her current home province.\nBut to do that, Sweeting will have to get out of the always challenging Alberta provincials. Chelsea Carey has taken over Heather Nedohin's solid rink and Kelsey Roque is 10th on the WCT order of merit.\nThe Scotties winners get home-ice advantage at the worlds in March in Swift Current, Sask.\nSPEAKING OF ALBERTA …\nThe men's ranks also will feature a top-notch battle for a Brier spot.\nThe favourite will be defending champ Kevin Koe, but he'll be challenged by up-and-coming Brendan Bottcher, who raised eyebrows all of last season after an impressive junior career.\nBoth are ranked in the top 10 in the world and if they meet in the provincial final, nobody will be disappointed.\nTHE SCHEDULE\nKey events this season:\nThe Masters (men and women), Oct. 27-Nov. 1, Truro, N.S.\nThe National (men and women), Nov. 11-15, Oshawa\nCanada Cup (men and women), Dec. 2-6, Grande Prairie, Alta.\nCanadian Open (men and women), Dec. 8-13, Yorkton, Sask.\nContinental Cup (men and women), Jan. 14-17, Paradise, Nev.\nOntario women's championship, Jan. 18-24, Brampton\nOntario men's championship, Feb. 1-7, Brantford\nScotties Tournament of Hearts, Feb. 20-28, Grand Prairie, Alta.\nTim Hortons Brier, March 5-13, TD Place\nWorld women's championship, March 19-27, Swift Current, Sask.\nWorld men's championship, April 2-10, Basel, Switzerland\nElite 10 (men), March 16-20, Victoria, B.C.\nPlayers' Championship (men and women), April 12-17, Toronto\nChampions Cup (men and women), April 26-May 1, Sherwood Park, Alta.\nmike.koreen@sunmedia.ca\nTwitter: @mkor1980\nSponsored Links See All Sponsored Links\nTen big storylines heading into curling season\nMIKE KOREEN, Toronto Sun\nFirst posted: Saturday, October 24, 2015 01:17 PM EDT | Updated: Saturday, October 24, 2015 01:34 PM EDT\nMuch like baseball, the curling season never really seems to end these days.\nThe top curlers now compete in big events from September through May — and it's not uncommon to see some of the elite athletes on the ice in the summer months.\nHowever, it's fair to say we are about to enter the meat of the season — heavy on big-money events with spots at world championships and Olympic trials on the line.
