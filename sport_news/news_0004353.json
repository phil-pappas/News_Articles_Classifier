His 70 rushes are more than twice many as any other FAU running back.\n\"I was waiting to see whatever they gave me,\" said Howell, who is the team's leading rusher with 354 yards. \"I wasn't like, `Oh, give me all the (carries) and being unselfish. I'm a team player. Whatever they want me to do, I'm going to do.\"'\nLast year Howell was working scout team before his redshirt was pulled when starter Jay Warren began struggling with fumbles. Warren was injured in the first half against Miami, putting Howell in position to gain a stronger hold on the No. 1 tailback spot.\n\"I've always like his demeanor and attitude because he's going to bring everything that he has regardless of the situation,\" FAU offensive coordinator Brian Wright said. \"â€¦ You appreciate a kid that gives you everything that he has.\"\nWith an average of 17.5 carries a game, Howell has no plans of slowing down. He actually embraces the idea of the Owls leaning on him.\n\"With the carries, I feel good,\" Howell said. \"The legs feel good. I'm confident getting the ball as many times as they want me getting the ball.\"\nNext game : FAU vs. Rice, 2:30 p.m., Oct. 10, Fox College Sports.\nsrichardson@tribpub.com\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-560dc88a/turbine/fl-fau-owls-news-1002-20151001"], "published": "2015-10-02T00:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T17:46:31.796+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
