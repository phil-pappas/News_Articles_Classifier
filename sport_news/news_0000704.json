At least, that was the consensus from the players who were polled in September during the NHL/NHLPA Media Tour in Toronto. \nThere was, however, one exception. \n“Artemi Panarin,” said Chicago Blackhawks defenceman Duncan Keith, when asked who will be the league’s top rookie. \nKeith might be a little biased — or just plain hopeful. \nAfter all, aside from the YouTube clip a friend passed along to him, Keith had yet to see Panarin play. But the hype surrounding the 23-year-old rookie, whom the Chicago Blackhawks signed as an undrafted free agent in the summer, continues to grow, especially after Panarin scored 62 points in 54 games in the KHL last season. \n“I’ve heard a lot of good things,” said Keith. “I talked to (Vladimir) Tarasenko a few minutes ago and he’s his good friend. He said he can help us. I hope so.” \nWhile Panarin might not challenge McDavid (five assists in five exhibition games) or Eichel (two goals and six points in four games) for the Calder, this year’s rookie class is more than just two players deep. \nFrom Sam Bennett in Calgary to Max Domi in Arizona, here are six rookies not named McDavid or Eichel that you just keep your eye on: \nSAM BENNETT, CALGARY \nThe 2014 fourth-overall pick played in just one game during the regular season, because of a shoulder injury that required surgery. But he made up for the lost time in the playoffs where he scored three goals and one assist in 11 games to help the Flames advance to the second round. The plan is to have Bennett centre the third line to start the year, but do not be surprised if he climbs up the depth chart by Christmas. \nMAX DOMI, ARIZONA \nThe Coyotes are undergoing a rebuild and in many ways it starts with Domi. The speedy, skilled son of an NHL enforcer scored 32 goals and 102 points in junior last season. While he is not expected to produce those kinds of numbers, he still might be Arizona’s best offensive weapon. In fact, with 2015 third-overall pick Dylan Strome already returned to junior, he and rookie Anthony Duclair might be Arizona’s only offensive weapons. \nSAM REINHART, BUFFALO \nHaving Eichel and Ryan O’Reilly definitely takes a lot of the pressure off Reinhart during his rookie season, but the expectations sort of remain the same. As a No. 2 pick in 2014, the playmaking centre will be charged with putting up points. And if his pre-season totals are anything to go by — he had five assists in five games — he seems ready for the challenge. \nARTEMI PANARIN, CHICAGO \nChicago plucked the 23-year-old, who was limited to just one exhibition because of an upper-body injury, out of Russia after Panarin scored 62 points in 54 games in the KHL last season. A smallish, but highly skilled winger, he essentially fills the void created by the departures of Patrick Sharp and Brandon Saad. Those might be some pretty large skates to fill, but playing on a line with Patrick Kane and Artem Anisimov should ease the transition. \nNIKOLAJ EHLERS, WINNIPEG \nThe Jets, who did not have a player amongst the league’s top-40 scorers last season, are a team in need of offence. And Ehlers, who scored 86 goals and 205 points in 114 games during his junior career, might be able to provide it. The 19-year-old winger is expected to start the season on a third line with Mark Scheifele and Mathieu Perreault, but look for him to help out a power play that ranked 17th last season.
