That report also cited five unnamed former Louisville players or recruits who described some details of stripper parties similar to those alleged in Powell's book, \"Breaking Cardinal Rules: Basketball and the Escort Queen.\" \n\"I didn't watch it. I didn't see it,\" Ramsey said. \"There's an investigation taking place, and we're letting it play out, and I think that's the fair thing to do. \n\"The investigation is taking place right now, and it is moving forward as a joint investigation of the university. It's representative Chuck Smrt, who we hired, and the NCAA, and it'll play out in a fair way and a way to find what the real truth is and what the real answers are. That's what we want, and that's what we expect.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T15:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T16:04:55.175+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
