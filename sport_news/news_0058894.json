This was a joyous occasion. It was Senior Night. For Crawford, the event marked a historic time in her tenure as Ardmore head coach. Lima and Noland are the first group of seniors to have played for her all four years. Lima and Noland were freshmen when Crawford was in her first year guiding the Lady Tigers. The 2012 season was a transition for the program, Noland said. “It was different coming into a new program with a new coach,” she said. “You don’t know how things are going to turn out.” Stressing the fundamentals was one of the most important aspects that Noland and Lima quickly learned about Crawford. “She focused more on the simple stuff,” Noland said. Added Lima, “She changed everything. It felt weird at first, until you started putting it all together, and saw that it actually worked.” Lima and Noland didn’t have much softball experience to their credit, but through hard work and attention to detail, they have blossomed into everyday starters for Ardmore. “I’m just really proud of them,” Crawford said. “Whenever I first came in, they were really athletic but had small knowledge of softball, if that even. We worked endlessly teaching them situations and going through things like that and the fundamentals. They’ve just worked really hard.” Fellow senior Marshelle Stubblefield received limited playing time, but was used as a courtesy runner as the season has progressed. In her final home game Tuesday, she was inserted into left field — during the varsity game — with two outs in the top of the seventh inning. The more that Lima and Noland got to know Crawford, the more she became a second mom to them, Lima said. “She always offered us a place to stay if our parents were out of town,” Lima said. “She always made sure that if you didn’t have somethng to eat that she would get it to you. She was like a second mom.” The quotes that Crawford draws to in an effort to motivate her players are second-to-none, Noland said. Page 2 of 2 - “One quote that has always stuck in my head, is, ‘Between the lines, nothing bad can happen. Nothing from the outside can get inside, you’re always safe between the white lines,’” Noland said. Lima, Noland and Stubblefield walked the base paths with their family members and received gifts from each player Tuesday. Ardmore’s season isn’t over. The Lady Tigers travels to Duncan on Wednesday and Thursday for the Regional 5A-3 Tournament. The Lady Tigers play El Reno at 2 p.m. Wednesday in the opening round of the tournament. Although Ardmore has its sights set on a berth in the state tournament, the realization the season — and prep careers for Lima, Noland and Stubblefield — is almost over is bittersweet. “It’s shocking,” Lima said. “It doesn’t feel like it’s over. But, we have something with her that nobody else will have, so it’s great to share that memory.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T23:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T00:53:11.513+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
