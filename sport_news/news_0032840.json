And yes, it lacks a reliable left-hander.\nBut a few rays of promise broke through in August and September, lifting expectations for 2016.\n\"I feel like there are some pieces in place here, some young arms that we are excited about,\" manager Walt Weiss said. \"Young guys like Diaz and Justin Miller, the way they evolved at the back end of games was encouraging.\"\nHistory shows that for Colorado to have any chance to compete, the bullpen must be solid. In the World Series season of 2007, for example, relievers posted a 3.85 ERA, the second-best in franchise history.\nWATCH: Rockies building bullpen with power arms\nIn the best of all possible worlds, Ottavino would open next season as the closer. Early in 2015, his slider made hitters look foolish, and he didn't give up a run in 10 innings, striking out 13 and allowing just three hits in that span. But Ottavino underwent Tommy John surgery in early May, and it's difficult to see him pitching in the majors again before the all-star break.\nAdvertisement That means Axford, 32, probably will be Colorado's ninth-inning man to open the 2016 season. He had some rough moments in 2015, especially because he was dealing with the near-fatal snakebite of his 3-year-old son, Jameson. But Axford's 25 saves were his most since 2012, and he righted the ship late. He had nine saves and posted 17 scoreless outings with a 2.84 ERA over his last 20 appearances.\nDiaz, acquired last offseason from the Angels in exchange for infielder Josh Rutledge, is the most intriguing arm in Colorado's bullpen. The right-hander projects as either a seventh- or eighth-inning reliever. Diaz, 24, can throw a 100-mph fastball, but he has begun dialing it back a bit in search of better command. He's also working on developing a sharper slider.\n\"He's made humongous strides this year,\" said Triple-A pitching coach Darryl Scott, who tutored Diaz for much of the season in Albuquerque. \"He's more confident and more comfortable on the mound.\"\nIn 21 appearances after being recalled from Triple-A, Diaz posted a 2.37 ERA with six walks and 18 strikeouts. The Rockies are confident that Diaz's strikeout totals will rise.\nOberg, who missed most of his 2014 season at Double-A Tulsa, was erratic for much of his first big-league season, but Weiss kept throwing him out there in key situations. Oberg allowed his 10th home run on Aug. 13 at the New York Mets, which was tied for most among NL relievers at the time. But he gave up no homers in his last 23 games (19 innings).\n\"It's kind of been a roller-coaster year for him, performance-wise,\" general manager Jeff Bridich said. \"But I think (he made) a leap after missing all of 2014 ... after just a little bit of time in Triple-A.\n\"For Scotty to learn on the job at the major-league level and maintain and rebound when he had a bad outing was impressive.\"\nWhat the Rockies still lack is a reliable lefty in their bullpen. Rex Brothers, who spent most of 2015 in Triple-A, hasn't regained the form that made him a dominant pitcher in 2013.\nBoone Logan, entering the final year of a three-year, $16.5 million contract, was signed to be more than just a lefty specialist, but that's what he has become. Logan (4.33 ERA in 35 innings) was scored upon just once in his last 17 outings. However, he was hardly a shutdown reliever, allowing 11 of 14 inherited runners to score in that span.\nThe long and middle relievers probably will be right-hander Christian Bergman, and left-handers Yohan Flande and Christian Friedrich. Keep an eye on Miguel Castro, the raw, 20-year-old right-hander with the 97-mph fastball who was acquired in the Troy Tulowitzki deal with Toronto.\nRockies reliever Adam Ottavino underwent Tommy John surgery in May, and it's difficult to see him pitching in the majors before the all-star break.
