The Bruins were flagged six times in the first half, some of them stalling drives.\nWhen senior receiver Jordan Payton caught a short pass from freshman quarterback Josh Rosen to pick up a first down on the Bruins’ first drive, he was whistled for pass interference on a pick play, running into a defensive back to set another receiver free.\nThat left UCLA with a third-and-16 from its own 14-yard line. Rosen fired the ball toward the sideline, but his pass was underthrown and intercepted by cornerback Alijah Holder, who cut across the field and returned it 31 yards for a touchdown and an early 7-0 lead.\nOn UCLA’s second drive, the Bruins marched to the Stanford 10-yard line. The drive included a shifty run from Paul Perkins, who juked past several defenders, then cut across the field for a 43-yard gain. He appeared to score on a 10-yard run, but right tackle Caleb Benenoch was hit with an offside penalty.\nA holding penalty two plays later meant the drive ended with a 36-yard field goal by kicker Ka’imi Fairbairn.\nMcCaffrey returned the ensuing kickoff 96 yards before being chased down by Fairbairn and brought down by Octavius Spencer.\nThe Cardinal extended their lead to 14-3 on the next play, Hogan’s 4-yard touchdown pass to Austin Hooper.\n1 2 Next Page Related: UCLA-Stanford box score", "external_links": ["http://sports.ocregister.com/cfb/boxscore.asp?gamecode=201510150063&home=63&vis=64"], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T15:26:16.057+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
