King added another tackle for a loss later in the first quarter. He now has a team-leading 12 tackles for a loss. Bad Field position: Army started its first two possessions on its own 8- and 4-yard lines. The Black Knights started only two of their 10 drives beyond the Army 26-yard line. Schurr injured: Army senior quarterback A.J. Schurr, who was making his second straight start, left the game with a thigh bruise with 2:39 remaining in the first quarter and didn’t return. Coach Jeff Monken said Schurr’s leg “was stiff and tight” after treatment. Sneaky Sirk: Duke quarterback Thomas Sirk outrushed Army 47-44 in the first half. Sirk ran when it looked like Duke was in a passing formation. “They did a lot more quarterback draws than we expected,” Army linebacker Jeremy Timpf said. “But we didn’t play the way we should have and there were a lot of errors.\" Ugly Moving the chains: Army was 3-for-14 on third-down conversions, while Duke converted 11 of its 16 for first downs. The Black Knights were 1-of-7 in the first half, converting only on a 2-yard run by Ahmad Bradshaw early in the second quarter. Double reverse fail: Army called for a double reverse to DeAndre Bell, who was supposed to throw the football. Problem was Bell never received the ball. Bell ended up falling on the ball after a 14-yard loss in the second quarter. Quarterback Ahmad Bradshaw’s pitch was nowhere near slotback John Trainor, who was supposed to give the ball to Bell. Monken said Trainor ran the wrong play, thinking it was a play-action pass.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T07:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T12:11:32.816+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
