(Photo: Andy Marlin, USA TODAY Sports) 37 CONNECT 212 TWEET 4 LINKEDIN 1 COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nNEW YORK — The Mets didn’t need to resort to beanballs to drill the Dodgers on Monday. \nTwo days after Chase Utley broke Mets shortstop Ruben Tejada’s leg on a hard, late slide that keyed a game-winning rally for the Dodgers in Game 2, the series moved to New York for the first postseason game in Citi Field’s seven-season history. Mets and Dodgers players took turns excoriating and defending Utley, respectively, and the capacity crowd in Queens seemed eager for payback, chanting “Utley sucks” repeatedly during pregame introductions and, during the game, “We want Utley.” \nBut starter Matt Harvey, under orders from manager Terry Collins, made no apparent attempt to retaliate for the slide that earned Utley a two-game suspension — pending appeal. And the Mets indulged the crowd instead with an offensive explosion off Dodgers starter Brett Anderson and Los Angeles bullpen, reaching double-digit runs by the bottom of the fourth inning en route to a 13-7 victory. \n\"It's not necessarily easy to go out there and score runs and score runs in bunches, like we were able to do tonight,\" outfielder Curtis Granderson said after the game. \"When you do it, you're obviously grateful for it. And hopefully you can feed off of it.\" \nThe game’s most promising development for the Mets’ World Series dreams, certainly, was the arrival of a pair of key bats that had gone quiet. Outfielder Yoenis Cespedes, whose remarkable hot stretch helped catapult the Mets to the top of the NL East after they acquired him just before the trade deadline, finished the regular season in a 12-for-55 slump and went 1-for-7 with a homer and three strikeouts in the first two games of the series. Injured Mets shortstop Ruben Tejada gets standing ovation in pregame intros \nCatcher Travis d’Arnaud, an unsung hero in the Mets post-deadline surge who returned from injury to post an OPS over 1.000 from the start of August to the middle of September, finished the season in a 7-for-49 funk and went 0-for-7 in the first two postseason games of his career. \nAfter the Dodgers got off to a three-run lead in the top of the second on a series of singles off Harvey and a throwing error by Granderson, Cespedes opened the bottom half of the frame by beating out a groundball to shortstop Jimmy Rollins for an infield hit. After a Lucas Duda single, d’Arnaud drove home Cespedes to put the Mets on the board and helped set the table for Granderson’s bases-clearing double later in the second. \n\"(Cespedes) is electrifying on the field,\" Mets manager Terry Collins said after the game. \"He can do anything he wants, and that kind of hustle shows that he's determined to, again, to get us on, let us ride his back. He's a dangerous player.\" Chase Utley not in Dodgers lineup for Game 3 vs. Mets \nThe very next inning, Cespedes laced a one-out single to left field. A batter later, d’Arnaud turned on a changeup from Anderson and put it over the left-field wall to extend the club’s lead. Then, during another Mets rally in the fourth, Cespedes smashed an Alex Wood fastball for a home run that left his bat at 111 mph, according to Statcast. The homer gave the club a 10-3 lead. \n\"Home runs mean a lot,\" Collins said. \"They get guys excited. They get the team excited. The fanbase loves home runs. And our team's built on power. And so when we hit home runs, we think we got a big chance to win. And it's all about trying to get on base, and then have somebody up there that can hit something into the seats.\" \nCespedes and d’Arnaud combined to go 6-for-9 with two homers and six RBI in the game, undoubtedly a great sign for the Mets’ offense moving forward. \n\"I was just trying to keep things simple,\" d'Arnaud said. \"I feel the last few weeks I've been overthinking and trying to do too much instead of just seeing the ball.\" \nThe 13 runs represent the most in any postseason game in Mets’ franchise history, and Granderson’s five-RBI day tied the club’s postseason record in that stat. And chasing Anderson after only three innings forced the Dodgers to use six members of a bullpen they may very well need in Tuesday’s Game 5, with Clayton Kershaw pitching on three days’ rest. \nHarvey held the Dodgers to three runs – two earned – on seven hits with seven strikeouts and two walks in five innings to earn the win. The Mets will send rookie lefty Steven Matz to the mound for Game 4 on Tuesday with a chance to clinch the series at home. \nGALLERY: METS vs. DODGERS Posted!
