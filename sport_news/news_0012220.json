Will the 5–0 Falcons hold off the Saints to remain perfect, or can New Orleans shut down one of the NFL's most productive offenses and stop its skid? Don Banks makes his Thursday Night Football pick below.\n• Last week: 9–5; Season: 48-29 (.623).\n• Best pick in Week 5: Cincinnati 23, Seattle 19 (actual score: Bengals 27–24).\n• Worst pick in Week 5: Kansas City 33, Chicago 17 (actual score: Bears 18–17).\n• NEW: One-week $2M fantasy league. First place wins $150K and top 90K teams win cash! Sponsored by FanDuel\nThe Saints stopped being the Saints as we have known them right around the time of their 2014 season opener at Atlanta, when they blew a pair of fourth-quarter leads and lost 37–34 in overtime to their division nemesis. Including that game, New Orleans has dropped 13 of its past 21 games, after going 55–25 from 2009 to '13, with four playoff berths in that five-season stretch.\nThat run of success must feel like ancient history already in New Orleans, because this year’s 1–4 Saints squad enters Week 6 fighting for relevancy and respectability rather than a playoff spot. In many ways, it feels as if these two long-time rivals are headed in opposite directions, with the promising Dan Quinn coaching era taking off with a 5–0 flourish in Atlanta and the 10-year Sean Payton regime hitting its lowest ebb in New Orleans.\nNFL Video Blanket Coverage: Do Colts have any chance at stopping Tom Brady, Pats? by Greg A.
