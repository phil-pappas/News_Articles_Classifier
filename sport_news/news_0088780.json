And he thinks he knows why.\nConforto said he needs to be less anxious at the plate after Friday's voluntary team workout at Citi Field.\n\"I feel like right now I really just want to kind of want to work on staying in the zone a little bit more,\" he said. \"I got kind of anxious a little bit, maybe got caught going out of the zone a little bit and just try to get back to sticking to my strengths and what I do well. And just get back to my routine and all the things I do to prepare like I always do.\"\nWATCH: California congressman forced to sing 'Meet the Mets' after losing NLDS bet\nA 2014 first-round pick, Conforto's season began at High-A St. Lucie. He didn't reach the majors until late July. After his call-up, he hit .270 with nine homers and 26 RBI in 56 games.\nBut the lefty hitter has seen platoon duty in the playoffs, entering the lineup vs. right-handers. It hasn't exactly paid off. Conforto has just a hit in 15 at-bats (.067) — a home run against the Dodgers in the National League Division Series.\nConforto said he felt like he improved a bit in Wednesday's win over the Cubs that clinched the NL Championship Series sweep and a World Series spot.\n\"I feel good at the plate,\" he said. \"I think I've had some good at-bats, I've had some quality at-bats getting on base a little bit there in Chicago, hitting the ball hard just not finding the grass. So I feel good at the plate.\"\nIt's unlikely Conforto's assignment will change against either the Toronto Blue Jays or the Kansas City Royals, who are battling for the American League pennant. Entering Friday, the Royals had a 3-2 lead over the Blue Jays. In three at-bats vs. lefties this postseason, Conforto is hitless.\nEither way, Conforto is excited for the opportunity.\n\"Obviously, we're on the biggest stage,\" he said. \"This has been my dream. This has been everybody's dream. Everybody has always dreamed of winning the NLCS and going to the World Series.\"\nBrendan Kuty may be reached at bkuty@njadvancemedia.com .
