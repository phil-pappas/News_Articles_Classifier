You can put me on record for that,\" West Virginia head coach Dana Holgerson said on Saturday. \"Corey Coleman is the best football player in college football.\" \nHolgerson's team was shredded by the Baylor wideout on Saturday. Coleman had 10 catches, 199 yards, and 3 touchdowns. \n\"It's not earth-shattering news to us,\" Baylor head coach Art Briles said Monday. \"We've been around him for four years. We know what he brings to the table.\" \nIn just six games, Coleman has already broken the single-season receiving touchdowns record at Baylor with 16. \nColeman was asked if he knew the NCAA record: \"Yeah, someone tweeted me. It's 27.\" \nIs that possible? \n\"Um, no telling.\" \nBut this absurd success for Coleman comes as no surprise to those at Pearce High School in Richardson, where he was a star from the start. \n\"He's a very talented kid,\" Pearce head coach Randy Robertson said Tuesday. \"And he has developed into having a tremendous work ethic, there, as well.\" \nRoberston coached Coleman for three seasons. And when it was time for Coleman to play on Saturdays, there were some college coaches who didn't want to play him wide receiver. \n\"They all wanted to know whether he should be on offense or should he be on defense,\" Roberston said. \"Because he could've been a a heck of a corner. could've been a lock down corner. But there was something special about him with the ball in his hands.\" \nFinding the end zone is nothing new for Coleman. During his junior and senior years at Pearce, he scored 24 and 25 touchdowns, respectively. \nBut he's on pace for even more, this year at Baylor -- in line to score 32 times this season, in the regular season alone.
