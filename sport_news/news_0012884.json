Earlier this week, Terry Collins said that he thought Jacob deGrom’s last two playoff starts were the most impressive because the right-hander clearly did not have his best stuff and he had to grind out innings. That is also what has the Mets a little worried. Concerned about deGrom getting fatigued, the Mets are eyeing starting Matt Harvey in Game 1 of the World Series.\n“The one thing we’re looking at with Jake is the last couple times out he looks like he could use some time,” the Mets manager said Friday after a voluntary team workout at Citi Field. “He’s been erratic with his fatigue.\n“It could be anybody. Is it going to benefit us to start him and use him three times? Look, you gotta put them in situations where they’re going to have more success,” Collins continued, “I’m not sure where we’re going to go just yet, but I like our rotation no matter who’s out there.”\nFOLLOW THE DAILY NEWS SPORTS ON FACEBOOK. \"LIKE\" US HERE\nNew York Daily News Back page of the Daily News for Oct. 18, 2015 The Mets do not have to set their rotation for the World Series, which will begin Tuesday in either Kansas City or Toronto, for a few days, but clearly there is a lot of thought of starting Harvey in Game 1.\nWhen asked if Harvey, whose workload has been the Mets’ third rail all season, could pitch three times in the best-of-seven-games World Series, Collins seemed open to the idea.\n“There’s a possibility,” was all Collins would say.", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/NYDNSports"], "published": "2015-10-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T00:12:36.695+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
