The dazzling attacking display of its 33-13 elimination of the host England a week earlier gave way to a watertight defensive effort.\nIts decisive phase was an extraordinary seven-minute period in the second half when Australia was reduced to 13 men after two players received 10-minute yellow-card suspensions in rapid succession. Wales besieged Australia’s goal line, but could not break through.\n“You’ve got to give credit to Australia for defending like that,” Wales Coach Warren Gatland said. “They really threw their bodies on the line.”\nWith the victory, Australia clinched the tournament’s “Pool of Death,” undoubtedly the toughest qualifying group in the World Cup’s 28-year history. It came on an evening when England’s home — usually blanketed with white shirts — was instead filled with the red and yellow of Wales and Australia and ensured that every quarterfinal would be a confrontation between the Northern and Southern Hemispheres.\nWales will play South Africa at Twickenham on Saturday while Australia plays Scotland, which clinched the final playoff place on Saturday, in the same stadium a day later.\nAustralia still led only 12-6 with 11 minutes to go when it was restored to full strength, but there was no doubt by then which team would win.\nIt was a revealing passage of play. Australia-Wales matches have a definite pattern. They are always close, and Australia always wins. The Wallabies have now beaten Wales 11 times in a row. The last 10 have been by single-figure margins, with an aggregate difference of only 49 points.\nThe heroic seven-minute shorthanded defensive stand showed why. Australia wins because it has smarter, more skilful players who trust those skills and use them to make better decisions under pressure. Wales falls short.\n“We threw everything at them,” said Wales captain Sam Warburton, his disappointment written in his face and voice. “I couldn’t have asked anything more from our guys.”\nWhile Wales lacked nothing in commitment or passion, its reliance on muscle rather than craft made Australia’s task easier.\nIt battered relentlessly at Australia’s line from short range, but made almost no attempt to stretch the Wallabies’ depleted cover by using the full width of the field.\nOn the rare occasions the ball went beyond the halfbacks, it was run back into the Australian defense long before it reached the wings, wasting the space in which a try might have been scored.\nThe disappointment for fans of Wales is that smarts, skill and creativity have been its historic edge over larger, better-resourced European nations. Now Australia is beating the Welsh repeatedly at their own game.\n“It was different to our games so far, and we had to show a different skin. I’m very pleased with the result,” said Australia Coach Michael Cheika. “There were plenty of imperfections in our game, and we’ll need to improve before the quarterfinals.”\nAdvertisement\nContinue reading the main story Advertisement\nContinue reading the main story Wales was struggling once it extracted only three points — a penalty by its flyhalf Dan Biggar — from a dominant first quarter. It was never ahead after Australian flyhalf Bernard Foley landed the first of his five penalties in the 24th minute. Biggar might have taken Wales into halftime tied at 9-9, but missed a penalty to end his run of 15 consecutive successful kicks.\n“We don’t want to do that again,” Cheika said of his team’s shorthanded period. “We got away with it this time, but you won’t get away with it too often at this level.”\nBut with one of his veteran leaders, scrumhalf Will Genia, in the sin-bin alongside lock Dean Mumm, Cheika still had enough confidence in his bench to substitute two more key figures, his captain, the hooker Stephen Moore, and the inside center Matt Giteau, before the siege was lifted.\n“They are all tough games now, all knockout games. You can’t have a bad game and make up for it in the rest of the pool,” Cheika said.\nAustralia, though, should be confident of beating Scotland. Wales will feel it has every chance against a South Africa team that has, as Gatland said, “gone back to the tried and tested” of ferocious physicality. Its 64-0 midweek defeat of the United States felt like an extended display of seal-clubbing.\nWales’s historic record against South Africa is dispiriting, but it did win the last meeting, in Cardiff, Wales, in November 2014. “We’re disappointed to have lost to Australia, but the players are looking forward to a quarterfinal against a side we have beaten in the last 12 months,” Warburton said. “We can bounce back next week as we have done in the past.”\nScots gain quarterfinal\nScotland claimed the last quarterfinal place after one of the most exciting contests of the tournament, holding on to beat already eliminated Samoa — which produced by far its best performance — 36-33 at Newcastle. Scotland’s win meant that Japan was eliminated despite victories over South Africa and Samoa.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T14:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T15:41:34.621+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
