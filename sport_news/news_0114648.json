Chris Hine Contact Reporter Chicago Tribune Blackhawks celebrate 2015 one last time with banner raising ceremony \nIn the rafters of the United Center, the banners for the Blackhawks and the Bulls face each other, with the Bulls logo on each banner seemingly focused on the Hawks banners with a menacing stare. \nFor the last two decades, the Bulls' championship banners outnumbered the Hawks' — but not anymore. \nThe sides are now even, 6-6. Ever so slowly, the fresh, pearl-white 2015 Stanley Cup championship banner was lifted into the rafters Wednesday night to join its counterparts from 2013, 2010, 1961, 1938 and 1934, most of which have grown a little brown and wrinkly from old age. \nIn unveiling the banner, the Hawks raised a final toast to the 2014-15 season before Wednesday's 3-2 loss to the Rangers. \n\"I guess it's the last stage of the Cup process,\" captain Jonathan Toews said. \"It's been a good summer, a lot of stuff going on with the Stanley Cup. … We're turning the page with this new group and focus on starting over again.\" \nThe Hawks seemed a little distracted, at least early in Wednesday's game when they gave up three goals in the first period. Once the music stopped, the cameras stopped flashing and the lights came back on, there was a hockey game and the Rangers quickly spoiled the party. \nDefenseman Duncan Keith insisted the celebration had nothing to do with the Hawks' sluggish start. \n\"We've all been through ceremonies,\" Keith said. \"There's a puck drop or something like that, it's something you just deal with. … We've been down before coming out of a first period without a ceremony.\" \nOscar Lindberg scored on the first shot of the game to quiet a rowdy United Center crowd that gave full-throated cheers — and boos of Commissioner Gary Bettman — throughout the banner-raising ceremony. \nIt was all part of a glitzy evening that included a red-carpet entrance for the players on Madison Street, a light show and a video montage of last season's Cup run. \nSome of the loudest cheers went to Patrick Kane, the embattled Hawks winger who is under investigation for an alleged sexual assault. It was Kane who nearly tied the game late in the third period when he appeared to knock a loose puck past Rangers goaltender Henrik Lundqvist. But the referees had blown the play dead before the puck went into the net. \nKevin Klein and Derek Stepan also scored for the Rangers while the Hawks received goals from rookie Artemi Panarin, who scored his first NHL goal, and winger Teuvo Teravainen. \nDespite the loss, the night offered plenty of memories for the Hawks. Toews said even though the Hawks want to turn their attention to 2016, they still savored the opportunity to celebrate the Cup they won on the same ice less than four months ago. \n\"It's not quite the level of winning on home ice, but it's being a part of that energy, being in the arena with our fans and everyone wants to be there in that moment,\" Toews said. \"It's a special moment in Chicago sports history, and you're only going to do it so many times, so you have to enjoy it while it lasts.\" \nCoach Joel Quenneville, who tried unsuccessfully to suppress a smile when the crowd chanted \"Q,\" said he rarely gets nervous when he's standing behind the bench. His two exceptions to that are the first game of the playoffs and the first game of the regular season. \n\"There's a lot of newness to our team, a lot to look forward to as well …\" Quenneville said. \"That was definitely the toughest Cup we ever had to win. It seemed like it was never going to end. It was hard-earned. It'll be nice to reflect. But then let's turn the switch.\" \nThe Hawks didn't quite turn it all the way Wednesday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T07:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T07:32:28.861+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
