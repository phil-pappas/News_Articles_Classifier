The winner of Wednesday’s series finale against the Texas Rangers will advance to the American League Championship Series against either the Kansas City Royals or the Houston Astros. Here’s what you need to know about today’s game.\nFirst pitch: 4:07 p.m. EST\nRoof status: Closed\nStarting pitchers: RH Marcus Stroman (4-0, 1.67) vs. LH Cole Hamels (13-8, 3.65)\nTV: Fox Sports-1, simulcast in Canada on Sportsnet.\nProjected lineups:\nBlue Jays\nBen Revere – LF\nJosh Donaldson – 3B\nJose Bautista – RF\nEdwin Encarnacion – DH\nChris Colabello – 1B\nTroy Tulowitzki – SS\nRussell Martin – C\nKevin Pillar – CF\nRyan Goins – 2B\nRangers:\nDelino DeShields – CF\nShin-Soo Choo – RF\nPrince Fielder – DH\nAdrian Beltre – 3B\nMitch Moreland – 1B\nJosh Hamilton – LF\nElvis Andrus – SS\nRougned Odor – 2B\nChris Gimenez – C\nSouthpaw shortage\nJays’ manager John Gibbons said it was unlikely David Price would be used out of the bullpen again on Game 5, while he wasn’t sure if Aaron Loup would be able to return from his family matter by Wednesday. With Brett Cecil’s season-ending injury, that leaves the Jays without any left-handed relievers against a Rangers’ lineup packed with left-handed power. But if Gibbons wants to neutralize Shin-Soo Choo, Prince Fielder or Mitch Moreland in the late innings between Stroman and either Aaron Sanchez or Roberto Osuna, he may go to right-handed relievers Ryan Tepera or LaTroy Hawkins — both of whom are actually tougher against lefties — for a batter or two.\nBringer of runs\nJosh Donaldson, the Jays’ dynamic third baseman, led the majors this season with 13 first-inning home runs and he already has two such homers in the series, including one off Hamels in Game 2. So make sure not to miss his first at-bat.\nBig-game Hamels\nThis will be Cole Hamels’ 15th career post-season start, but his first career start in an elimination game. He has, however, started five clinching games and his team has won all five. The 2008 NLCS and World Series MVP has a 7-4 record in the post-season with a 3.05 ERA. The Rangers are 11-0 in his starts.\nBell to throw first pitch\n1987 MVP George Bell is rumoured to be throwing out the ceremonial first pitch on Wednesday afternoon, though it has yet to be officially announced by the Jays. In 12 career post-season games, Bell hit .271 with one homer and three RBI.\nPlayers to watch:\nTroy Tulowitzki\nThe Blue Jays’ Game-3 hero, a veteran of the National League, has faced Hamels more than nearly all his teammates. He’s only 5-for-22 against the Rangers’ ace lefty, but he has a triple and two homers.\nDelino DeShields\nThe Rangers’ speedy lead-off hitter leads Texas with six hits this post-season and he had two — a single and a double — off Stroman in Game 2.\nMore on thestar.com\nBlue Jays fans pumped and anxious ahead of Game 5 against Rangers\nSo, you don't like the Jays?
