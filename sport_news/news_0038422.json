She's currently a licensed practical nurse and attending classes. \n\"For Halloween, any time I wanted to be a nurse. I didn't want to be a doctor. I wanted to be a nurse,\" Geary said. \nThe Sioux Falls woman says she was drawn to the profession because both her mom and sister are nurses. \n\"We're the ones there 24/7 through the good times and bad. The doctors go in and talk to them. There are doctors who spend a lot of time with them, but there are also doctors who are in and out. It's the nurse who is there for everything for them,\" Geary said. \nWhile Geary knows what she's getting into, she says the recent controversy shows many people don't know exactly what nurses do. \nNurses across the nation are speaking out about their profession after recent comments on daytime talk show, \"The View.\" \n\"Really being allowed to advocate for a patient. I really feel like it's my role to speak up for patients who can't speak up for themselves and make sure all their needs are getting met,\" Sanford Cardiovascular Institute nursing supervisor Marin Schaefer said. \nOver the past couple of weeks, nurses have not only been talking more about their profession in person, but also over social media. \n\"When people would say, 'Why didn't you go on and do something else? Why are you just a nurse?' I'm not just a nurse. I am a nurse, and I'm very proud of that,\" Schaefer said. \nBoth the hashtags #NursesUnite and #ShowMeYourStethoscope are trending. \n\"It's really inspiring to me to see nurses take ownership and accountability for the great role we have,\" Schaefer said. \nA role that Geary can't wait to fill. \n\"I know you're the one who is there with the patient through the hard times and the good times,\" Geary said.
