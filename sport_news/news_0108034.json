According to local media reports, Team manager Intikhab Alam said, “It’s sad that Ali has to return home following the death of his mother-in-law and his return before the second Test will depend on his visa for the United Arab Emirates”. Azhar Ali missed the first test too due to his injury. Off-spinner Bilal Asif is likely to join the Test squad in place of Azhar Ali. Currently, Asif is in India for his bowling action test in Chennai.
