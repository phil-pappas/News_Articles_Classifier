On Aug. 4, Lundblade was one of three players – along with Chad Whitener and Blake Jarwin – who were awarded scholarships after walking on to the OSU program. \nTwo months later, Lundblade still remembers OSU coach Mike Gundy awarding him a scholarship before the Cowboys’ practice. \n“It’s definitely a day I’ll never forget,” Lundblade said. “For me, it still hasn’t changed anything. I’m still working hard every day trying to get better. I guess, in a sense it has because this is the year that I’ll never forget I got put on scholarship. It really hasn’t changed a whole lot. \n“I had some offers out of high school, but I visited Stillwater a few times and really loved it. I decided to walk on here and one year later, I think it worked out for me. I love Stillwater and that’s the reason I came here.” \nLundblade’s teammates were also excited for the 6-foot-3, 300-pound sophomore offensive lineman from Argyle, Texas. \n“I was ecstatic for him,” senior quarterback J.W. Walsh said. “He absolutely deserved it. I was just happy for him. Anytime anybody gets put on scholarship, you’re happy for him. He’s one who truly deserved it.” \nWalsh added that Lundblade’s reward for his hard work speaks louder than words about the Cowboys’ program and its players. \n“Again, that just speaks volumes to the maturity of the football team,” Walsh said. “You’ve got a guy like that, who’s still young, you know he’s mature for his age because he walked on and he had to take the tough route to come play for us and he did it. He’s been a very good teammate since he’s been here. With him playing for us, it helps our leadership and maturity.” \nWhen Lundblade talked to media members after that Aug. 4 practice, he hadn’t had time to share the news with his parents because the Cowboys were notified of the scholarships minutes before practice started. His parents had the reaction he thought they would, although they already heard the news. \n“They were really excited,” Lundblade said. “They actually found out before I had a chance to call them on the phone through Twitter. I guess word spreads pretty quickly. They were definitely excited and it was really cool to share that moment with them.” \nNow, he’s enjoying the benefits of a scholarship. \n“It’s definitely nice,” Lundblade said. “It was definitely nice at the beginning of the semester going to the bookstore and not having to pay for books. Logging on to my Bursar account and seeing that zero balance was pretty nice. It’s definitely a great feeling and I’m very thankful for it.” \nLundblade officially became a starter on the OSU offensive line in November 2014 when the Cowboys traveled to Waco, Texas, to play Baylor. Since then, Lundblade has started every contest for the Pokes. \nAfter starting eight games for the Cowboys, Lundblade has learned a lot about himself and his teammates on the line. His improvement – in his opinion – has mostly come between the ears. \n“The biggest thing for me would be the mental aspect of the game,” Lundblade said. “As the center, you call the protections and basically tell everybody else what to do. For me, having a few more games under your belt, you see a lot of the same looks over and over again, so having that experience of seeing a lot of defenses really helps out. \n“Just as a whole offensive line, we can improve in a lot of ways. I can improve in every aspect of my game. It’s a matter of showing up and working as hard as you can.” \nIt’s that hard work that earned Lundblade a scholarship on a top-25 program. It’s also that hard work that’s earned teammates’ respect for the true sophomore. \n“He’s an awesome teammate and he’s a leader for our football team,” Walsh said. “He’s just one of those guys that does everything right. You can always count on him to do what he’s supposed to do. He’s also a smart guy, so you can count on him to make the right calls. He’s an awesome teammate and friend. He’s just one of those guys that you love having on our football team.”  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T00:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T16:17:07.302+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
