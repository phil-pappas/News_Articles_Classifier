Posted: Tuesday, October 20, 2015 11:01 pm ASWA RANKINGS: Area nears season-long shutout Staff Reports cullmantimes.com \nCullman has been no stranger to ranked opponents this season. Muscle Shoals, however, will be the Bearcats’ first from Class 6A. \nNon-region foes Etowah (5A) and Fayette County (4A) didn’t turn out to be much trouble. Don’t expect the same from the undefeated Trojans (8-0, 5-0), who held firm to their No. 4 spot in the Alabama Sports Writers Association’s latest prep football poll released late Tuesday night. Muscle Shoals has already wrapped up the Region 8 title and figures to be a handful. \nAnother ranked team awaits Cullman (6-2, 3-2) in next Friday’s regular season finale. Russellville is up to eighth this week in 5A. \nWinless Holly Pond is in for a trip to Region 5 champ Winfield (7-1), which sits 10th in 3A. \nNo teams from The Times’ coverage area have cracked their respective top 10s at any point this fall. \nSee this week’s complete poll below: \nClass 7A \n1. Bob Jones (25) (8-0) 336 \n2. Spain Park (4) (7-1) 268 \n3. James Clemens (7-1) 233 \n4. Central-Phenix City (7-2) 195 \n5t.
