I lost control of my car. My teammates, including Marshawn, stopped 2 check on me. They weren't racin me\n— Fred Jackson (@Fred22Jackson) October 21, 2015 Though Jackson escaped injury – and did not crash into any other cars or bicyclists in a heavily-trafficked intersection – this is another headache for a Seahawks team in turmoil.\nFullback Derrick Coleman was arrested last Wednesday and spent two nights in jail on felony charges of vehicular assault and hit-and-run stemming from a crash in nearby Bellevue, Wash. That crash also occurred shortly after Coleman left the practice facility.\nThe team immediately suspended Coleman for the week, but he was reactivated on Tuesday, a day before the team is scheduled to travel to Santa Clara, Calif. for Thursday’s game against the division rival San Francisco 49ers.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/Fred22Jackson/status/656655528152567808"], "published": "2015-10-21T03:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T06:29:39.805+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
