Barrett in the second half of Saturday's win over Penn State, Meyer elected not to name a starter Monday as he begins preparations for Saturday's Big Ten clash with Rutgers. \nMeyer told reporters he had an idea of who he would start, but he wanted to talk it over with Barrett and Jones before announcing it publicly. \n\"I want to make sure I visit with everybody,'' Meyer said, \"and make sure we're doing the right thing.'' \nWhile all signs point to Meyer tapping the more fleet-footed Barrett, Flood said Monday he plans to prepare for both. \nRutgers Week 8 opponent: Ohio State at a glance \n\"I think it's become very evident you'd better prepare for both of them,'' said Flood, whose Scarlet Knights (3-3, 1-2 Big Ten) will host the top-ranked Buckeyes (7-0, 3-0) for an 8 p.m. kickoff Saturday at High Point Solutions Stadium. \"J.T. runs around a little bit more. I know they have brought him in in the red zone. And he's played a little more as the season's gone on. They are certainly both excellent players with a little bit different skill sets. \n\"But when they come in the game, you'd better be ready to defend what they do.'' \nWhile Jones has been the primary quarterback for Meyer's power-spread attack, Barrett has seen action in all but one game. In recent weeks, the reigning Big Ten Conference quarterback of the year has been utilized in the red zone as Meyer has looked for ways to put Barrett's running talents to good use. \nThe result? Seven total touchdowns over the last two weeks for Barrett, who combined for 368 total yards and three touchdowns in last year's 56-17 win over Rutgers. \nJones, who led Ohio State to three postseason wins, including the National Championship triumph over Oregon last year, has thrown for 1,242 yards, seven touchdowns and five interceptions on 93-for-149 passing this fall. \nPLUS: Rutgers major underdog for Saturday's game vs. No. 1 Ohio State \nBarrett has completed 27 of 44 passes for 249 yards, rushed for 228 yards and combined for seven total touchdowns. \nWhoever starts under center will be at the helm of an Ohio State attack that leads the Big Ten in scoring (37.0), rushing (242.1) and ranks second in total offense (455.6). \n\"There's no question that they look like the No. 1 team in the country,'' Flood said. \"Their talent level absolutely jumps out (on film). The other thing that jumps out, you look at their starting offensive line, and four of their five starters up front on offense have over 20 career starts. So they have got a very experienced group up front on offense, and that always helps you perform well.''", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T23:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T00:05:58.628+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
