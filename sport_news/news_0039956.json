But they're also here to see the future, to hear the grand pronouncements of âthe next stepâ for UCLA sports. In a few minutes, the university will break ground on two major athletics practice facilities, the Wasserman Football Center and Mo Ostin Basketball Center â\" two long overdue projects for programs so recently mired in mediocrity. On the edges of the canopy, designs of the two buildings sit on easels for all to see, ever-present reminders of this growth.\nThe two buildings were the impetus for the biggest fundraising year in UCLA athletics history, and itâs hard to ignore their symbolism. At a public university with well-documented limits for athletic spending and little physical space to spare on campus, 110,000 square feet of new facilities will be erected with enough money culled from donors to start ahead of schedule. This is no small feat. By this afternoon, UCLA has already raised $70 million for these projects, a majority of which came from the gathered elite under this sweltering tent.\nMingling among them, offering handshake after handshake, is the man who has led UCLAâs athletic department to this point. In a gray pinstripe suit with a powder blue-striped tie, Dan Guerrero doesnât cut the imposing, authoritative figure that athletic directors of his repute often do â\" a characteristic deemed as aloofness by his critics.\nItâs true â\" there is a reticence to him, which, for those outside of the department and his close sphere of family and friends, has made him difficult to read. His responses are often calculated. Rarely is he outwardly emotional in public. âHeâs not interested in branding himself,â says his longtime associate athletic director, Petrina Long.\nTo those critical of him, these attributes have been held up as an indictment of his leadership. But the truth is much more complicated than that. On resume alone, Guerrero is actually one of the nationâs most distinguished at his position, with more national championships in his tenure at UCLA than any athletic director in America. Those inside his department universally laud his steadiness. Elsewhere, colleagues speak only highly of his wide-reaching influence. With prominent positions on numerous national committees, his voice is one of the more present in college athletics.\nItâs a troubling paradox, a disconnect thatâs difficult to reason, begging many questions â\" not the least of which being how, in this ever-changing world of college athletics, athletic directors should be evaluated at all.\nA month later, in his office on the third floor of the Morgan Center, Guerrero is seated on one of his two couches, shuffling a deck of playing cards. Heâs talking about sleight of hand â\" how, as a baseball player in Italy, he learned card tricks to pass the time. Though heâs long forgotten them, he talks longingly of the mastery involved in a magicianâs work.\nâYouâve got to be on,â Guerrero says. âYou canât screw up. There are so many cynics out there thinking, âOh, Iâm going to figure you out.â Yet, theyâre right there, doing it in front of them. I admire that.â\nItâs a fitting metaphor for what has faced Guerrero in Westwood . Few sports figures in Los Angeles operate under such an unapproving gaze of constant doubt from fans. But is that doubt warranted? Or, as the job of an athletic director complicates further, does public perception only distort how Guerrero â\" or any AD â\" is evaluated? Asked himself about that perception, about questions of his leadership, the man holding all of UCLAâs cards lays them on the table.\nâThis is the way Iâve always done it,â Guerrero says. âItâs always been successful. I donât feel a need to have to change. If someone out there feels I need to lead differently, thatâs OK. Iâm not going to change.â\nROAD TO WESTWOOD\nThe rich aroma of fresh mole and just-baked tortillas is in the air at Los Tres Cochinitos, just off the Pacific Coast Highway in Wilmington, where mariachi music rings throughout a dining room decorated with porcelain pigs. Itâs one of the few sit-down restaurants left in this blue-collar harbor neighborhood, on the edge of the Port of Los Angeles, where time has not always been kind. Itâs here, a world away from Westwood, that Guerrero has suggested to meet for a rare look into a life shaped not far from here.\nâThis is the heart of the harbor,â Guerrero says, his voice ripe with nostalgia. âIn the old days, if your family were longshoremen, they passed down the (union) card and that opportunity to their sons. When I went to high school, my friends knew they were either going to the service or the docks.â\nIt was a fate Guerrero watched play out all over Wilmington. Gangs and drugs were prevalent; classmates heâd known for years fell in with the wrong crowd. To avoid that fate, he sought refuge in baseball. When his father, Gene, finished long days at the Union Oil refinery, Guerrero begged to have grounders hit to him at a nearby park, and his father, a neighborhood coach, rarely refused. The rest of his free time was mostly spent at the local Teen Post 908, where community members constantly assured him he could be different. âI felt obligated not to let them down,â Guerrero says.\nNeither of his parents graduated high school. The family lived modestly, often paycheck to paycheck. His mother, Esther, stayed home to raise Guerrero and his two siblings at his fatherâs prideful insistence. He worked double shifts with the laborerâs union , despite having one lost one eye in a car accident. Guerrero describes him as a man of archetypal toughness, a man who never complained and advocated âtough love,â using a strap to keep his sons in line.\nStill, there was tenderness to him, below that tough exterior. Every night before bed, he would come into his sonâs room, kiss him on the forehead, and say the same four words.\n1 2 3 4 5 Next Page", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T05:26:26.774+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
