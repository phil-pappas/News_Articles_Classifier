Stone who for the first time ever, was found ranked ninth in the state in 4A and looked to move to 6-0 on the season. It was a typical fall night and there had been rain in the area all day but the Panthers, who having been running the ball effectively all season, would have to grind out the win in Carthage. The Panthers didn't break any big runs for touchdowns but were able to control the clock and play good defense against a scrappy and gritty Owl team who were 3-2 on the season. Smith County won the opening toss and opted to receive the ball first to start the game. The Owls had good starting field position, as the kickoff from Vannatter squibbed down the field, but Stone's defense held them to a three and out to start the game and force a punt. Stone went to work on offense from their own 25 yard line and got a big play when quarterback Austin Helton found Chandler Vannatter for a 45 yard play as Vannatter drug three defenders down to the 30 yard line of Smith County. Ethan Pierce capped off the 75 yard drive with a touchdown from the 1 yard line. Smith County again would start with good field position at the 50 yard line but again opted to punt after the Panthers defense stopped them and they were able to pin the Panthers deep at the 8 yard line. Stone would run out the first quarter running the ball, and picking up four first downs on the drive before they turned the ball over on downs after an incomplete pass. Smith County started at the 32 yard line but gave up the ball on the first and only turnover on the night, as Chandler Vannatter picked off the pass and ran it back to the 27 yard line of the Owls. Justin Johnson would get his first of twoTD's of the game giving Stone a 13-0 lead. The Owls would flip the field and put Stone deep again at the 5 yard line. As Stone did the previous week, they would put together a long drive to put points up and burn the clock. Helton picked up the first down on a keeper and also had a pass to Vannatter and a screen to Ethan Pierce to keep the drive going. Vannatter made a leaping catch at the 3 yard line with only 14 seconds left on the clock in the first half. Johnson closed out the 95 yard drive by pounding it in on a good second effort run and Stone would be up 19-0 at the break. The Panthers would get the opening kickoff of the second half, and put together a 65 yard drive and score that took half of the third quarter and in essence put the game away. Helton rushed his team to the line to go for the first down, as he has done several times this year, and was able to draw the defense offsides to get the first down. Cody Wyllins would get the honor as he walked in behind his line for the touchdown and with a quarter and a half left the score was 26-0. Smith County got their first score with 1:43 left in the third, the point after was no good and it was 26-6. The Panthers recovered the onside kick by the Owls and opened it up as Helton heaved it deep down field as Pierce outran everyone to track it down at the 12 yard line of Smith County. Helton would run the read option to perfection as he kept the ball and went in the end zone to make the score 33-6. Stone Memorial would end up winning 33-13 and are off to a perfect 6-0. Coach Mark Wattenbarger had this to say, \"Very proud of our guys for winning tonight against a very physical Smith County team. They did some things defensively different than we had seen all year but our guys handled it well. I thought Austin Helton had a good game throwing the ball and running the option for us at quarterback. Defensively, we played a great first half but we had a little let down in the second half. It's been a great start for us but now we have four region games in a row that we need to win to get where we want to be.\" Sign Up / Sign In With your existing account from... {* loginWidget *}", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-28T23:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T01:41:35.019+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
