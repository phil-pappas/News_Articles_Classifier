TCU, Baylor and Texas A&M all face fierce conference tests in the coming weeks. Houston might have the best chance to remain among the unbeatens thanks to a relatively weaker slate in the American Athletic Conference -- but the undefeated Cougars haven't impressed some of the voters.\nAt any rate, here's a look at this week's Best in Texas poll, which is voted on by the Dallas Morning News' college insiders and bloggers, as well as Denton Record-Chronicle's Brett Vito. Make sure to check out how each writer voted, and the breakdown, here ,\nT1. TCU, 125 points (6 first-place votes) TCU Horned Frogs (5-0, 2-0 Big 12) / Last: Beat Texas, 50-7 / Next: at Kansas State, 6:30 p.m. Saturday in Manhattan, Kan.:\nTCU looked every bit the part of a College Football Playoff team in its destruction of Texas, pumping out 604 yards on offense while shutting the Longhorns out for the majority of the game. The Horned Frogs have scored 50 or more points every game since their opener at Minnesota (23-17). TCU's defense, which is starting to replenish after defensive tackle Davion Pierson's return at Texas Tech and defensive end Mike Tuaua's return Saturday, should continue to improve as the team plays three of its next four games on the road. -- Jose Rodriguez\nT1. Baylor, 125 points (4) Baylor Bears (4-0, 1-0 Big 12) / Last: Beat Texas Tech, 63-35 / Next: at Kansas, 11 a.m. Saturday at Memorial Stadium in Lawrence, Kan.\nAfter a slow start on defense, Baylor pulled away for a dominant victory over Texas Tech on Saturday in Arlington. The Bears continued their offensive dominance, compiling nearly 700 yards and marching down the field at will. The Bears also managed to bring consistent pressure on Tech quarterback Patrick Mahomes in the win. Baylor has now won 12 straight games in the state of Texas dating back to October 2012 and pulled its first set of first-place votes in both of the major polls under Art Briles. The Nov. 27 matchup between Baylor and TCU is quickly starting to look like the biggest game in college football. -- Shehan Jeyarajah\n3. Texas A&M, 113 (1) Texas A&M Aggies (5-0, 2-0 SEC) / Defeated Mississippi State, 30-17 / Next: Bye.\nA&M improves to 5-0 for the second consecutive season with Saturday's win over Mississippi State, and is now ranked No. 9 in the AP poll. Kyle Allen had his second consecutive 300-yard passing game, going 25-of-41 for 322 yards and two touchdowns. Senior Tra Carson had 26 carries for 110 yards and has 430 yards and four touchdowns for the season. On the schedule next for the Aggies are the Alabama Crimson Tide, but A&M head coach Kevin Sumlin will have a bye week to prepare for Saban's crew before they arrive to College Station on Oct 17. -- Brandon Wheeland\n4. Texas Tech, 95 Texas Tech Red Raiders (3-2, 0-2 Big 12) / Last: Lost to Baylor, 63-35 / Next: vs. Iowa State, 2:30 p.m. Saturday in Lubbock.\nIt will be difficult for the Red Raiders to find a positive takeaway from the second consecutive loss to a top-five nationally ranked opponent. Sophomore quarterback Patrick Mahomes did start for Texas Tech, completing 32 passes for 415 yards and four total touchdowns, three passing and one rushing -- though he threw two interceptions. The Red Raiders surrendered 680 yards against the Bears and -- aside from forcing a late turnover -- continue to struggle, defensively. Expect a spirited effort from Texas Tech in all three phases as the Red Raiders try for their first win in Big 12 Conference play this week. -- Mike DuPont\n5. Houston, 92 Houston Cougars (4-0, 1-1 AAC) / Last: Beat Tulsa, 38-24 / Next vs. SMU, 7 p.m. Thursday at TDECU Stadium in Houston.\nHouston entered AAC play on a hot streak and continued to roll with a 38-24 win over an improved Tulsa team. The Cougars racked up more than 600 yards of total offense, including 365 yards on the ground. Quarterback Greg Ward led all rushers with 182 yards and three touchdowns and added 273 yards through the air. Houston had a bowl team last year and looks even better under head first-year head coach Tom Herman. The \"H-Town Takeover\" is real. -- EJ Holland\n6. Texas, 76 Texas Longhorns (1-4, 0-2 Big 12) / Last: Lost to TCU, 50-7 / Next vs. Oklahoma, 11 a.m. Saturday at the Cotton Bowl in Dallas.\nThe Longhorns' struggles continued Saturday against TCU. The Horned Frogs scored 30 points in the first quarter after Texas made a handful of mistakes and were unable to recover en route to a 50-7 blowout. Texas' schedule doesn't get any easier as it will have its hands full in the Red River Rivalry against No. 10 Oklahoma. -- Nick Castillo\n7. Rice, 60 Rice (2-3, 0-1 Conference USA) / Lost to Western Kentucky, 49-10 / Next: at Florida Atlantic, 1:30 p.m. Saturday in Boca Raton, Florida\nThe Owls fall to 1-1 in conference play after suffering a blowout loss to the Hilltoppers on Saturday. Rice held a 3-0 advantage after its first possession but managed just a touchdown for the remainder of the contest. Tyler Stehling threw for 150 yards and an interception while Samuel Stewart led the rushing attack with 11 carries for 60 yards. Stehling entered the game midway for starter Driphus Jackson, who was yanked after a 5-of-10 performance for 87 yards and a score. Senior Luke Turner from Gilmer rushed for the Owls' lone touchdown. The Owls visit Boca Raton next week to take on Florida Atlantic. -- Brandon Wheeland\n8. SMU, 46 SMU Mustangs (1-4, 0-1 AAC) / Last: Lost to East Carolina, 49-23 / Next at Houston, 7 p.m. Thursday at TDECU Stadium in Houston.\nSMU appeared to be on the verge of bouncing back against a black-eye loss to FCS opponent James Madison. The Mustangs held a 16-point lead in the second quarter before East Carolina rattled off 42 unanswered points en route to a 49-23 victory. It's clear SMU has made strides on offense, but the defense is flat out terrible. SMU is better than it was last year, but it won't win more games if the defense doesn't step up. -- EJ Holland\n9. UTEP, 45 UTEP Miners (2-3, 0-1 in C-USA) / Last: Lost to UTSA, 25-6 / Next: at Florida International, 11 a.m. Saturday at Ocean Bank Field in Miami.\nIt was a new game, but the same problem remained: offense. The Miners' running game has been nothing short of embarrassing since Aaron Jones went out. Against UTSA, UTEP finished with 275 yards, only 59 coming on the ground. The Miners will need to find some way to put points on the board or risk falling to the bottom of this poll. The defense is doing an adequate job, but it is hard to win a game when you only score six points. -- Shehan Jeyarajah\n10. UTSA, 44 UTSA Roadrunners (1-4, 1-0 C-USA) / Last: Defeated UTEP, 25-6 / Next: vs. Louisiana Tech, 6 p.m. Saturday in San Antonio.\nWith the most difficult part of their schedule behind them, Larry Coker's bunch earned their first win of the season in convincing fashion. Defense anchored UTSA in its victory. The Roadrunners forced a safety and returned two interceptions from freshman Ryan Metz for touchdowns. Junior safety Michael Egwuagu put UTSA ahead 18-0 following an interception returned 40 yards for a touchdown in the third quarter, and Mesquite-native Nate Gaines returned another interception 11 yards for a the second defensive touchdown of the game. -- Mike DuPont\n11. Texas State, 26 Texas State (1-3, 0-0 Sun Belt) / Last: Bye / Next: at Louisiana-Lafayette, 6 p.m. at Cajun Field in Lafayette, La.\nAfter a 1-3 start, the Bobcats had a chance to regroup during their bye week. Texas State begins Sun Belt conference play when it travels to Louisiana to take on the Louisiana-Lafayette Ragin' Cajuns.\n12. North Texas, 11 North Texas Mean Green / (0-4, 0-2 C-USA) / Last: Lost to Southern Miss, 49-14 / Next: vs. Portland State, 4 p.m. Saturday in Denton.\nUNT fell to 0-4 for the first time since 2008 on Saturday, when the Mean Green struggled to get anything going on either side of the ball in a loss to Southern Miss. UNT is also 0-2 in Conference USA play and will look to break through for its first win of this season at home against Portland State, a member of the Football Championship Subdivision. The Vikings are 3-1 and have already beaten Washington State. UNT allowed 573 yards in its loss to Southern Miss and didn't score until the fourth quarter.\nOn Twitter:\n @SportsDayDFW", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/SportsDayDFW", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/10/04/best-texas-breakdown-105-longhorns-behind-state-rivals-smu-remains-mystery"], "published": "2015-10-05T06:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-07T15:28:13.750+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
