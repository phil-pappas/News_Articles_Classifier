Veer Ahlawat (75-79) was further down in Tied-88th place.\n\nWith the weather set to deteriorate and a typhoon expected on Sunday the third round will become all the more crucial.\n\nThe lead stayed with China's Cheng Jin (62-68) at 10-under and he was two ahead of Japan's Takashi Ogiso 67-65) and three shots clear off China's Zihan She (67-66), Australian Cameron Davis (69-64) and another Australian Ryan Ruffels (69-64) at seven-under 133.\n\nDwivedi, who is the best placed Indian, said, \"The conditions were very windy in the morning. At times we were hitting two clubs higher and still falling short. Most scores were hit by the conditions in the morning. It became slightly better in the afternoon and the wind picked up again in late afternoon.\"\n\nDwivedi, who finished with a 67 on first day, went three over in an eventful round that saw four birdies, five bogeys and one double.\n\nDwivedi, ranked third in India, started with a birdie on 10th, gave away that on the next hole and made it worse with a double on 12th. Another bogey on 15th meant he was already three-over for the day after six holes. He birdied 16th and bogeyed 17th to turn in three-over. Thereafter he found birdies on second and seventh but also gave away bogeys on first and fifth.\n\nAman Raj had a nice patch between seventh and 11th, during which he found three birdies, but bogeys on first and sixth and then a double on 12th and a final bogey on 17th saw him drop down. \"Things just did not happen today, maybe I can pull back some tomorrow,\" said Aman Raj, the top-ranked player on Indian Golf Union Merit list.\n\nMadappa flirted with the cutline the whole afternoon. He had a roller coaster ride with five birdies, seven bogeys and a double bogey. Not even a birdie on 18th could keep him in for the last two rounds.\n\nIt was an extremely windy morning, when the 27 players came back to resume their first round. All of them were hit by the windy conditions and the worst hit was India's Priyanshu Singh.\n\nThe 19-year-old Florida-based lad, needing to play four holes in the morning dropped a bogey on 15th and then had back-to-back double bogeys on 17th and 18th to drop from five-under to even par.\n\nPriyanshu barely had time to recover from the morning carnage, when he came back for the second round an hour and a half later. He composed himself with a birdie on second, but gave the shot back on the next.\n\nA further birdie on seventh showed he was ready to fight back, but the back nine pushed him back hard. Back-to-back bogeys on 12th and 13th followed a double bogey on 17th and bogey on 18th meant he ended with a card of 74 and was four-over 144 for 36 holes and spent the rest of the day watching the cutline. He dropped as many as seven shots on 17th and 18th on Friday.\n\nChina's Guan Tianlang had extremely contrasting fortunes on his first and second nines. Starting on the tenth, he began with five straight bogeys and a triple, making him eight-over for six holes. Then birdied the 18th to turn in seven-over. On the second nine, the front stretch of the course, birdied four times to get to 73 and total 143 to make the cut.\n\nCheng, playing the Asia-Pacific Amateurs for the fourth time, had one eye on the Masters berth. He admitted, \"It was hard to control and today I think I saw the leaderboard three times, made two bogeys and a birdie, I am still trying to do as much as I can to not put myself under the leaderboard pressure and focus on my own game.\"\n\nOn the conditions and his own play, he added, \"Today obviously was way more windy. I was lucky that during my Tee time it only picked up on the back nine so the front nine was playing alright. As for my game, I didn't make as may puts as yesterday obviously, but still a good round, irons and drivers were still good, didn't miss that many fairways and greens today, but putting wasn't that good.\"  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T19:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T16:34:11.839+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
