(AP Photo) Comments \nThe Cincinnati Bengals' 5-0 start reminds cornerback Dre Kirkpatrick of Alabama's 2009 team. Kirkpatrick was a freshman from Gadsden City High School for the Crimson Tide that season, when Alabama went undefeated and won the BCS national championship. \nKirkpatrick felt the connection between the teams last week, when the Bengals rallied from a 17-point deficit in the fourth quarter to defeat the Seattle Seahawks 27-24 in overtime. \n\"Not one time did I sense or feel in the environment around me like we were going to lose,\" Kirkpatrick said of the comeback victory. \"It was all, 'We've got this. We're going to come through.' And that's what we did. There's so much power in the tongue, and we spoke it into existence.\" \nKirkpatrick said the game reminded him of a tough spot the 2009 Alabama team was in â€“ clinging to a 12-10 lead over Tennessee when the Volunteers lined up to attempt a 44-yard field goal with four seconds to play. Alabama defensive tackle Terrence Cody blocked a kick by the Vols' Daniel Lincoln for the second time in the game to preserve the Tide's perfect record. \n\"There were a couple seconds left and we needed Terrence Cody to block a field goal,\" Kirkpatrick told ESPN.com. \"We never one time looked at each other and said, 'We're going to lose' that game.\" \nThe victory over Tennessee extended Alabama's record to 8-0 that year on the Tide's way to a 14-0 finish. Cincinnati will seek its sixth victory of the 2015 season when it visits the Buffalo Bills at noon CDT Sunday. \nRELATED: NFL'S UNDEFEATED TEAMS HAVE CRIMSON TIDE IN COMMON \nCincinnati has won its first five games in a season for the first time since 1988. The Bengals made their most recent Super Bowl appearance that season. \n\"To me, it's the same feeling,\" Kirkpatrick said of the two undefeated teams. \"It's all about how much we want it.\" \nFOR MORE OF AL.COM'S COMPREHENSIVE COVERAGE OF THE NFL, GO TO OUR NFL PAGE", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T18:24:12.503+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
