The Bears have a 12-0 conference record with four SCC games left — two against Wareham and one each against Bourne and Dighton-Rehoboth. “We’ve got it locked up,” said GNB Voc-Tech head coach Henry Andrade, whose team improved to 13-2 overall. “We’re pretty excited, but we’re looking to go have an undefeated season in the SCC and we still have some games left.” After winning the conference a year ago, Andrade wasn’t sure if his Bears could defend this title this season. “They’ve exceeded our expectations,” the longtime coach said. “I thought we’d be in the middle of the pack, but the kids have really excelled this year.” Joe Morehead put Voc-Tech up 1-0 in the 28th minute of the first half when he scored off an assist from Edmilison Centeio. Then in the 26th minute of the second half, Morehead set up Tyler Medeiros for his 17th goal of the season. Morehead has a team-best 21 goals and 14 assists this year. Andrade praised the play of freshman midfielder Michael Garcia and junior defender Corey Vieira. The Bears (13-2, 12-0 SCC) host Wareham today. West Bridgewater 4, Westport 1 Dawson Dosvais scored the lone goal for the Wildcats (5-6-4) in the second half. … Westport hosts Upper Cape on Monday. Apponequet 2, Old Rochester 1 Dylan Pinaggio scored from Mike Horton, and Alex Lopes added another goal on a penalty kick as the Lakers (8-5-1, 8-5-1 SCC) qualified for the MIAA state tournament with the win. … Apponequet is at Dighton-Rehoboth on Monday for the first of its final two regular-season games.
