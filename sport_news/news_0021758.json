He tweeted that his day began with a strikingly beautiful view of the Himalayas and vowed to visit them.\nKelly and his ex-astronaut twin Mark, on the ground, are part of an experiment on the long-term effects of space.\nRussia's Gennady Padalka holds the record with 879 days in space.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
