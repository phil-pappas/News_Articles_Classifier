Photo by Brian Achenbach/Special to the Tribune By Travis Hines thines@amestrib.com \nKANSAS CITY, Mo. – Monte Morris is going to play a lot. The junior Iowa State point guard is one of the country’s best at the position and has shown the ability to plays tons of minutes. \nBut, at some point, he’ll need a breather, and who will replace him is a question for ISU, especially with freshman point Nick Noskowiak leaving amid legal troubles this summer. \nNaz Mitrou-Long would appear to be the answer. \n“I feel good about it,” ISU coach Steve Prohm said. “I think he can give us some good minutes at the backup point.” \nMitrou-Long came to ISU as a combo guard, but his time at point was largely scrapped after a freshman season that saw him play sparingly. He returned to the position at times last year as a junior, but he’s primarily played at shooting guard. \n“I’ve been playing a lot of point guard over on the (second team in practice),” Mitrou-Long said, “getting accustomed to that. Me and Monte have been going back and forth, just looking to get him better. Monte’s capable of playing 40 minutes if he has to. In the league we play, he’s going to need some rest. \n“Whenever I get in there, take some weight off his shoulders, I’ll do that.” \nMitrou-Long is recovering from surgery on both his hips, but is making progress. He’ll practice on back-to-back days for the first time later this week, Prohm said, further evidence Mitrou-Long will likley be ready on the Nov. 13 opener. \n“I want to keep taking the necessary steps, doing what I got to do,” he said. “Based on the way I’ve been playing lately, I think I’ve taken steps in the right direction. If it keeps going that way, I definitely will be there.” \nMitrou-Long won’t be the only option behind Morris, though. \n“Obviously we can do some things Fred (Hoiberg) did last year with Georges (Niang),” Prohm said. \nOfficiating changes \nOnce again this season, college basketball will be making an effort to improve quality of play and increase scoring by tweaking rules and officiating. \n“In my 30 years of college basketball,” Big 12 coordinator of officials Curtis Shaw said, “this is by far and away the most important year I’ve ever seen.” \nThe changes, including a 30 second shot clock, will emphasis freedom of movement by cutting down on the amount of contact allowed from defenders, both on and away from the ball. \n“This may look ugly at times,” Shaw said, “and it may take getting used to. \n“But for the first time, (NCAA hierarchy) willing to stomach it and live through it.” \nFashion statement \nOnce again, West Virginia coach Bob Huggins made waves with his choice of attire. In recent years he’s come to media day donning a bow tie and a 1950s style lettermen’s sweater. This time, it was a pair of paints emblazoned with the West Virginia logo up and down the legs. \n“I had a little speaking thing at graduation,” Huggins said, “and (West Virginia) president (Gordon) Gee came in with a pair of pants like this on, and I thought, boy, that’s a great idea for media day. So I ordered me a pair.” \nErnst redshirt? \nProhm said he did not want to use a redshirt on freshman big man Brady Ernst, but was still considering it with Ernst “still dragging that leg” following an ACL tear last spring.
