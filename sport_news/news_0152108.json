I wouldn't say it's a longshot. It all depends on the visit. It's a real possibility.\"\nGiven the change in direction in Corvallis, Harry said he is anxious to experience the new environment surrounding the Beavers.\n\"I'm excited to see everything, especially going up there with Chase and Mason,\" he said. \"I'm excited to see how they coach and how they play.\"\nThis week, Harry scheduled another official visit in Oregon â€“ this time to Eugene for the Civil War content on November 27.\nHarry, who is rated the No. 20 prospect in the country and the No. 2 wide receiver by Rivals, sees himself as an ideal fit in the Oregon offense.\n\"I'm really excited for that. It'll be great to see a rivalry game and I really like coaches at Oregon,\" he said. \"I need to talk to the coaches a little bit more, but I really think I'd fit in the offense and could play at Oregon.\"\nPrior to his trip to Eugene, however, Harry plans to narrow his current list of 10 schools down to five.\n\"That will probably be within the next couple of weeks here,\" he said. \"I have to look at the list I have right now and break it down from there.\"\nOregon and Oregon State have spent many years battling it out on the gridiron. This fall, the two programs are also competing for a five-star wide receiver.\n-- Andrew Nemec\nanemec@oregonian.com\n@ AndrewNemec", "external_links": ["http://sports.yahoo.com/footballrecruiting/football/recruiting/player-N", "https://twitter.com/AndrewNemec"], "published": "2015-10-02T17:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T20:03:20.312+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
