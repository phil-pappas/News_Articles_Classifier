Posted Oct. 13, 2015 at 3:15 PM Updated at 3:18 PM Posted Oct. 13, 2015 at 3:15 PM Updated at 3:18 PM BOILING SPRINGS – Sometimes handling success is as big a challenge as adversity. Gardner-Webb is dealing with that this week in preparation for its first trip to Georgia to face Big South newcomer Kennesaw State Saturday at 1 p.m. GWU knocked off then-15th-rated Liberty, 34-20, last week but now with the celebrations behind, aims to carry momentum from that experience moving ahead. “We’ve still got a lot of young guys and I’ve got to see how we practice (this week),” Runnin’ Bulldogs head coach Carroll McCray said at his weekly media luncheon. “We’ve got to go play with a focused attitude. “The team we’re facing this week presents some problems. We’re going into a hostile environment and our younger guys need to prove they can grow and handle success.” The ‘Dogs are battling another double-wing option team in the 4-1 Kennesaw State Owls. “Their coach, Brian Bohannon (also a former GWU assistant) was at Georgia Tech and Georgia Southern,” McCray said. “So you’ll see them run double slots and the triple option. They’ve got a quarterback, a transfer from The Citadel, who is a tough runner. I’m sure they’ve seen the Wofford game (versus GWU) and The Citadel video from last year. “They’ve got a lot of redshirt freshmen (starting out the KSU program) but they’ve also mixed in about 13 transfers and JUCO players in their two-deep. They’ve got that mixture of older guys. They’re probably ahead of schedule offensively with what they’ve shown so far.” Kennesaw State has scored over 50 points three times, even though they have faced some lightly regarded foes (East Tennessee State, Edward Waters, Point University). “A key point is that we have to get lined up correctly on defense and know our responsibilities,” McCray said. “No. 2, our perimeter guys have to keep their eyes on the right spot. The few times they’ve thrown it have gone for huge plays and we can’t allow that.” It’s a big deal for Gardner-Webb to be making the trek – Kennesaw State has already announced a sell-out crowd of 8,000-plus for the first Big South league game in its history. “We’ll have to be ready. They’ll be really emotion about their first Big South game,” McCray said. “I know they we are capable of winning this game but I also know they are very capable of beating us as well If we don’t go make plays, then we could be trapped.” Page 2 of 2 - Defensively, KSU tries to throw multiple looks at the opposition. “They are a 3-4 team as their base, but in two of their games they came out in a five-man front,” McCray said. “They are going to try to make us block several different looks through the game. “", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T23:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T00:31:14.950+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
