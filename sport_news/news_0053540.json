Posted: Monday, October 19, 2015 8:22 am Bills Notebook: Injury list swells in loss to Bengals By CHUCK POLLOCK Olean Times Herald Olean Times Herald | 0 comments \nORCHARD PARK — Notes from the Bills’ 34-21 loss to the Bengals on Sunday afternoon at “The Ralph:” \n• The crowd of 69,583 was minus 1,277 no-shows. \n• The 6-0 start for the Bengals is the fastest in franchise history. \n• Buffalo wide receiver Sammy Watkins injured his ankle while catching a 22-yard touchdown pass late in the first half and didn’t return. Thus, with Percy Harvin (hip) and Marcus Easley (shoulder) already inactive for the game, then Marquise Goodwin suffering injured ribs on a kickoff return, the Bills played the second half with only three healthy wideouts: Robert Woods, Chris Hogan and recently-signed Denarius Moore. \nBills starting right tackle Seantrel Henderson left the game in the first quarter with a concussion. His place was taken by Cyrus Kouandjio. Finally, defensive tackle Kyle Williams, left late in the game with a knee injury. \n• The game’s only takeaway came when Bengals cornerback Darqueze Dennard picked off an underthrown EJ Manuel pass, his first pick of the season. \n• The Bills were called for eight penalties for 93 yards, which is actually better than their season average coming in (11 for 98). However, three were killers on special teams: the obligatory taunting flag, this one on cornerback Ron Brooks, a facemask on Goodwin, both 15-yarders, and a hold on linebacker Randell Johnson. \nBuffalo also had three offensive holds: two on Woods and one on rookie guard John Miller. \n“Penalties are costing us in every loss we have … big penalties, two on myself, I just have to do better on blocking,” Woods said. \n• Cincinnati sacked Manuel twice, once by end Carlos Dunlap, giving him a team-high 6.5, the other shared by Dunlap and tackle Brandon Thompson, his first. The Bills had no sacks and have totaled only nine in six games this season. Last year after six games they had 19. \n• Bengals free safety Reggie Nelson had a game-high 11 tackles, eight of them solos. linebacker Preston Brown paced the Bills with nine stops and seven solos. \n• Though the game was one-sided, both team had exactly 30 minutes time of possession, both had 112 rushing yards and Buffalo, thanks to garbage time statistics, had the edge in offensive yardage, 368-355. \n• The Bills’ inactives were quarterback Tyrod Taylor (knee), Harvin and Easley, running back Karlos Williams (concussion), safety Josh Bush, center Gabe Ikard and defensive end Alex Carrington.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T15:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T17:28:19.179+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
