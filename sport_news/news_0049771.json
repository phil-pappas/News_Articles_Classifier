You may want to sit down for this: MIT is no longer the Top Engineering School in the world, according to this year’s U.S. News and World Report ranking . Now take a deep breath...because the new global frontrunner out of 250 schools is China’s Tsinghua University . While some in the engineering community are likely scratching their heads at this maxim-defying news, it’s easy to see what happened. Take, for instance, the guidelines that U.S. News and World Report uses to rank the schools. The overall reputation of the institution is taken into account. But, for the most part, the number of publications coming out of each school is the biggest deciding factor. So basically Tsinghua University is churning out the most research. Not trying to throw out outlandish accusations to defend MIT here, but there’s no real indication of the quality of work being done at any of these engineering schools. A number of people - including many in China - are expressing the same sentiments online, according to the WSJ .

How does anyone look at two internationally applauded schools, pit their progressive projects against one another and deem one the winner? \nThere are so many obscure yet equally amazing innovations coming out of engineering schools across the globe - Tsinghua and MIT among many others - it makes you wonder how we could draw the lines separating good, better and best.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T17:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T01:53:04.365+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
