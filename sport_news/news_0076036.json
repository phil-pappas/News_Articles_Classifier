He has two top contenders for the female lead — Deepika Padukone and Katrina Kaif.\nApparently, Varun Dhawan was asked to play the male lead but he turned it down citing date issues as the actor is committed till next year. Now the production house is currently in talks with Shahid Kapoor for the same.\nSays a source, “Deepika was approached to play the female lead or the ‘half-girlfriend’. It is a coming- of-age romcom set in rural Bihar, Patna, New York and New Delhi and revolves around a Bhojpuri-speaking Bihari boy and a rich, beautiful Delhi girl whom he’s fallen in love with. The girl agrees to be his ‘ half girlfriend ’, but later, gets married and divorced. How they finally come together in New York and get married is what the story is about. As the girl comes from an elite, polished background both Deepika and Katrina suit the role. Deepika has an edge in many ways — firstly, in terms of performance. Also, the character Riya Somani is from Delhi and Katrina’s still looks more international than Deepika. Mohit is in talks with Katrina about the role in case Deepika doesn’t work out.”\nDeepika Padukone says, “I have not signed anything as of now. I am in the thick of shooting for Bajirao Mastani . I will be ready to make an announcement for my new films next year once Bajirao is complete.” Has she been approached for the film? “I can’t comment on it as I don’t talk about films that I have been approached for.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T14:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T02:05:25.448+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
