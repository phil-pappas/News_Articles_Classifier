(Daniel Lin / Associated Press) Edward Lee Contact Reporter The Baltimore Sun Towson football to try to do what five previous defenses could not: stymie No. 5 James Madison's Vad Lee. \nTowson is slated to tangle with five National Player of the Year candidates from the Colonial Athletic Association at the Football Championship Subdivision level, and the first one stepping up to the challenge is James Madison quarterback Vad Lee. \nThe senior, who is the most dangerous player on the No. 5 Dukes (5-0 overall and 2-0 in the conference), ranks fifth in the country in passing yards (1,420), is tied for ninth in passing touchdowns (12) and 14th in passing efficiency (158.4). Trying to knock Lee off his game is the goal of every defense, but no one has been successful yet. \n“There’s a reason why guys like he and Mr. [John Robertson, a senior] at Villanova and [Cooper Kupp, a junior] out in Eastern Washington, that these guys are the guys [for] National Player of the Year,” Tigers coach Rob Ambrose said Monday. “They don’t get fazed. They just don’t. They take the hits and they keep coming and they keep playing their game. They’re incredibly tough, all of them, and he’s probably the most well-rounded of all of them right now. He’s one of the most impressive college football players I’ve ever seen.” \nAs prolific as Lee is at throwing the ball, the Georgia Tech transfer is just as potent running with it. The 6-foot-1, 225-pound Lee ranks fifth in the nation in rushing yards (594) and fourth in yards per carry (7.9) and is tied for 17th in rushing touchdowns (five). His versatility presents a dilemma for the Tigers (2-2, 0-1). \n“You say, ‘Keep him in the pocket and let him throw the ball,’ but he’s incredibly efficient throwing the football,” Ambrose said. “You can say, ‘Let him run around a bit,’ but then he’s as good – if not better – than any tailback in the league.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T16:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T18:43:09.218+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
