This go-round, in the spirit of the Top 25 (and one) -- and because it's so hard to settle on the final players for this list -- we're going with the Top 100 (and one) players in the game.\nThe voting is democratic. Gary Parrish, Sam Vecenie and I took the better part of a week to whittle down more than 4,500 Division I players to basically the top 2.2 percent of that pool. It's a fun grind, and we fully admit there are players who didn't make this list that were very hard to leave off. We all have a couple of guys we fought for near the end, but you just run out of spots.\nAs a reminder, this list isn't about MVPs, MOPs or overall value to a team. This is different from, say, our All-American teams (which are about value and overall numbers -- on winning teams -- as anything else). This ranking is about basic talent and ability at the college level. How we see them now; how we think they project and compare to all other players for the entire season. We're not looking ahead to what they'll be in the NBA or anything like that.\nThink of it like this: When you play pickup basketball, and you pick teams, you're going with the guys as soon as possible that you think are the best. You're picking the players with the most talent. That's at the heart of how this list is made. You're gonna love some of these picks and hate some others. We're going to be SO RIGHT about a lot of these guys and SO WRONG about a few. That's the fun!\nWithout further ado, here it is, our 2015-16 edition. These are the 100 (and one) best players in college basketball.\n\n1. KRIS DUNN Providence Friars \nJunior | Guard \nBased on skill alone, this is the best player in college basketball in 2015-16. Want a guy who can get you a bucket? He scored 15.6 points per game last year on solid efficiency. A guy who can set up plays for others? He's the best in the nation, with a 50.0 assist rate. Need someone who can get you a defensive stop? Dunn was the co-Big East Defensive Player of the Year. He does it all at an elite level, and deserves the No. 1 spot on our list. And we have a preseason feature story on him, courtesy of Norlander, right here . -- Sam Vecenie \n2. BEN SIMMONS LSU TIGERS \nFreshman | Forward \nPlenty reading this haven't seen Simmons play yet. I'll say this: I don't think there's one player in the game returning from last season who is more a joy to watch than Simmons. His only weakness is an inability to create and make his own shot. Everything else? Thrives at. Can pass like a whiz. Hustles to the glass. Great teammate. Great natural feel. Will D up, particularly from the help side. Expect to see at least one Vine per game of him effortlessly commanding a break from one end to the other. He is the No. 1 player in the class of 2015 and with obvious reason. -- Matt Norlander \n3. BUDDY HIELD OKLAHOMA SOONERS \nSenior | Guard \nHield is a CBS Sports Preseason First Team All-American whose return to school for his senior year gives Oklahoma a chance to end Kansas' streak of Big 12 championships. He averaged 17.4 points and 5.4 rebounds last season and scored at least 25 points in five different games. -- Gary Parrish \n4. KYLE WILTJER GONZAGA BULLDOGS \nSenior | Forward \nWiltjer is an amazing offensive player who averaged 16.8 points and 6.2 rebounds last season while shooting 54.0 percent from the field, 46.6 percent from 3-point range and 78.9 percent from the free throw line. The Kentucky transfer is the CBS Sports Preseason National Player of the Year and more than capable of leading Gonzaga to another WCC title. -- GP \n5. JAMAL MURRAY KENTUCKY WILDCATS \nFreshman | Guard \nMurray has burst onto the scene as one of the top players in his age group over the course of the last year. He wowed scouts at the Basketball Without Borders camp, was the best player at the Nike Hoop Summit, then was highly impressive playing against men in the Pan-American games this summer. He should be Kentucky's No. 1 option to score this year, and he'll put up a lot of points for the Wildcats. -- SV \n6. SKAL LABISSIERE KENTUCKY WILDCATS \nFreshman | Forward \nLabissiere is a CBS Sports Preseason First Team All-American and the projected No. 1 pick of next June's NBA Draft . He's a 6-foot-10 forward who is equally comfortable around the rim and away from the basket. The only question, at this point, is whether the NCAA will clear him to compete as a freshman and, if so, when. -- GP \n7. MELO TRIMBLE MARYLAND TERRAPINS \nSophomore | Guard \nLead man on the most hyped Maryland team since Juan Dixon was BMOC. Trimble having a \"breakout\" year is impossible, given what he did a season ago. But in terms of his draft stock, Q rating for the sporting public and impact within the Big Ten and nationally, it's going to be a big-time year for him. He's got so much talent around him; expect the assist-to-turnover number to really improve. He'll still get to the line, too. Lovely player. -- MN \n8. GEORGES NIANG IOWA STATE CYCLONES \nSenior | Forward \nIowa State's do-it-all big man is a paragon of tremendous college star who somehow isn't projected whatsoever to succeed at the next level. Niang can play inside-out or vice-versa, will put up double-digit double-double games this season and should be in a foot race with Buddy Hield and Perry Ellis for Big 12 Player of the Year. Plus: His 3-ball keeps getting better. -- MN \n9. MALCOLM BROGDON VIRGINIA CAVALIERS \nSenior | Guard \nA true two-way star on the college level who epitomizes everything about Virginia basketball. He can slash, shoot, and create plays for others on offense, then go out and get you a stop on the other end on the opposing teams best perimeter option. He knows exactly how to utilize his strength and physicality better than any other guard in America. -- SV \n10. FRED VAN VLEET WICHITA STATE SHOCKERS \nSenior | Guard \nVanVleet is a top-shelf leader and primary ball-handler who has led Wichita State to a 65-6 record over the past two seasons. He averaged 13.6 points, 5.2 assists and 4.5 rebounds last season. He's expected to guide the Shockers to a third straight MVC championship. -- GP \n11. JAYLEN BROWN CALIFORNIA GOLDEN BEARS \nFreshman | Forward \nBrown's commitment was a coup for Cuonzo Martin. He is a powerful, yet graceful athlete that fits in the modern mold of players who can you can play anywhere from the 2 through 4 spots. He'll be the best player on a Cal team that could realistically win the Pac-12 if things break right for them. -- SV \n12. NIGEL HAYES WISCONSIN BADGERS \nJunior | Forward \nHayes spent the past two seasons in the shadows of Frank Kaminsky and Sam Dekker but still averaged 12.4 points and 6.2 rebounds as a sophomore. He'll likely lead the Badgers in shots this season and have them in the NCAA Tournament for the 15th straight season under Bo Ryan. -- GP Nigel Hayes will be Wisconsin's biggest option in keeping chase in the Big Ten. (USATSI) \n\n13. DENZEL VALENTINE MICHIGAN STATE SPARTANS \nSenior | Guard \nValentine emerged as a legitimate NBA prospect last season while averaging 14.5 points, 6.3 rebounds and 4.3 assists. He was a big reason why Tom Izzo made the Final Four for the seventh time. The 6-foot-5 guard shot 41.6 percent from 3-point range last season. -- GP \n14. JAKOB POELTL Utah Utes \nSophomore | Forward \nThe Austrian man stands 7 feet tall, is 19 years old ... and he's going to hit quite a few 3-pointers this season. Poeltl's efficency numbers were over the roof to start last season. He plateaued a bit as winter dragged on, but given his size and the fact he'll approach a 70-percent 2-point field goal percentage this season, how can we not rate him this high? Utah is a preseason top 25 team solely because Poeltl (rhymes with turtle; seriously) made the choice to craft his game one more year at the college level. -- MN \n15. MARCUS PAIGE NORTH CAROLINA TAR HEELS \nSenior | Guard \nPaige is the leader on what will likely be a top-five team in college basketball this year. He knocks down shots from deep to provide the Heels with spacing, makes plays as a lead guard with his passing ability, and generally settles the team down when they need stability. He's a consistent source of positive play, and that may get him onto the All-American team at season's end. -- SV \n16. RON BAKER WICHITA STATE SHOCKERS \nSenior | Guard \nLast year's Missouri Valley Conference Player of the Year has now been a part of three straight 30-win seasons. He'll look to make it a fourth this year under Gregg Marshall. He's a terrific shooter, a solid defender, and he's tough as nails. He embodies Marshall's #PlayAngry philosophy unlike any other player. -- SV \n17. BRANDON INGRAM DUKE BLUE DEVILS \nFreshman | Forward \nRangy small forward who's one of the five best freshmen in the country. Duke will probably take a little time to break him in, but it's a near-certainty he's a top-30 talent in the sport this season. We project him this high because he's likely to bloom come league play, and his shooting ability is sure to lead to a few 20-plus point outputs. -- MN \n18. CARIS LEVERT MICHIGAN WOLVERINES \nSenior | Guard \nLeVert was limited to 18 games last season because of a foot injury but showed enough while healthy to prove he's a top-20 player in college. The 6-foot-7 guard averaged 14.9 points, 4.9 rebounds and 3.7 assists as a junior. He shot 40.5 percent from 3-point range and 81.0 percent from the free throw line. -- GP \n19. PERRY ELLIS KANSAS JAYHAWKS \nSenior | Foward \nEllis is Kansas' top offensive option, and he's one of those guys that just has a ton of tools in his tool box. He can shoot from distance, has terrific footwork, and is a sneaky-good athlete due to his efficiency of movement. The Jayhawks have a deep team, but he'll be the most consistent option. -- SV \n20. YOGI FERRELL INDIANA HOOSIERS \nSenior | Guard \nTo me, this ranking is too low. Ferrell does everything well on the offensive end. He's a knockdown shooter from all over the floor, can create plays well for his teammates, and knows how to get players in the right spots. He's also a pretty solid leader that exudes toughness from his small yet physical frame. -- SV \n21. DEMETRIUS JACKSON NOTRE DAME FIGHTING IRISH \nJunior | Guard \nAbsolutely love his game. I said on our podcast last week that he's the one player not on our All-American teams who I would've put on. Jackson is an explosive and durable player, someone who's going to probably play out of his mind this season now that Jerian Grant and Pat Connaughton's production are no longer in the picture. Can't wait to see him play this season. -- MN \n22. DEANDRE BEMBRY SAINT JOSEPH'S HAWKS \nJunior | Forward \nBembry is one of the best do-it-all in America. He finished in the top-15 of the Atlantic 10 in seven statistical categories, including scoring which he led by averaging 17.8 points. He's a genuine NBA draft prospect, and one that should lead the Hawks to a better season this time around. -- SV \n23. RICO GATHERS BAYLOR BEARS \nSenior | Forward \nGathers led all power-conference players in rebounding last season by averaging 11.6 boards per game. He also averaged 11.6 points per game, which made him the only power-conference player in the country to average at least 11.0 points and 11.0 rebounds per game. -- GP \n24. TYRONE WALLACE CALIFORNIA GOLDEN BEARS \nSenior | Guard \nWill be Cal's MVP, I think. Will have the best stats across the board, and might well put up a stat line that reads 13 points, seven boards, seven dimes per. I think he keeps the turnovers at a respectable clip this year, too. Lengthy, broad point guard whose shooting stroke will help Cal achieve a No. 4 seed or better come March. -- MN \n25. MONTE MORRIS IOWA STATE CYCLONES \nJunior | Guard \nMorris had a breakthrough year last season while leading the Cyclones to 25 victories. The 6-foot-2 point guard averaged 11.9 points, 5.2 assists and 3.4 rebounds. He shot 50.7 percent from the field, 39.5 percent from 3-point range and only turned the ball over 1.1 times per game. -- GP \n26. KYLE COLLINSWORTH, BYU \nCollinsworth is versatile and not given enough credit for how resilient he is, regardless of opponent. He's also old, which helps. The BYU senior is now 24. He's a 6-foot-6 dish man. Collinsworth is one of the best passing wings in the country. Wonder if his assist rate (36.3 percent last season) will go down without Tyler Haws. -- MN \n27. NIC MOORE, SMU \nLast year, when we put Moore No. 84, my colleague Sam Vecenie wrote, \"Depending on how the Mustangs' season goes, Moore could be a dark horse candidate for AAC player of the year.\" Dark horse? Hardly. We goofed. Moore should have been top-50, as he was the most important player for the Ponies. He'll play out his senior season without a chance at being in the Dance. Consider this a small consolation prize, Nic. -- MN Reigning AAC POY Nic Moore got better over the summer playing at the World University Games. (USATSI) 28. DAMIAN JONES, Vanderbilt \nJones has everything you look for in a big man. He's about 7-1, has tremendous athleticism, he's pretty nimble, and has good touch around the rim. Now, he just needs to take that next step forward by developing aggressiveness inside. -- SV \n29. ANTHONY GILL, Virginia \nGill has been one of the better per-possession players in college hoops over the last couple of years, as seen by his seventh-place finish in the KenPom player of the year standings. He is a smart positional defender, and an efficient scorer. -- SV \n30. ISAIAH TAYLOR, Texas \nWith his ability and playing for Smart, who's had some point guards flourish under him previously, it's a safe bet to slot Taylor on the back end of the top 30. The Longhorns' point guard missed time last season because of a broken wrist. He's healthy now, and he'll be the best chance at getting UT to the Big Dance. Was No. 51 for us last year. -- MN \n31. DOMANTAS SABONIS, Gonzaga \nSabonis is probably the nation's most talented reserve. The 6-foot-10 forward -- and son of NBA great Arvydas Sabonis -- averaged 9.7 points and 7.1 rebounds for Gonzaga in only 21.6 minutes per game, meaning he could easily develop into a double-double guy for the Zags. -- GP \n32. D'VAUNTES SMITH-RIVERA, Georgetown \nBest player in the Big East (outside of Dunn)? Probably. Smith-Rivera makes the jump from 54 last season to 32 here. He's a combo guard, tough as the skin on an old man's heel, and will probably flirt with a 125.0 offensive rating. -- MN \n33. TYLER ULIS, Kentucky \nUlis was, at times last season, Kentucky's best point guard even if he was technically Andrew Harrison's backup. He had a 3.6-to-1.0 assist-to-turnover ratio and shot 42.9 percent from 3-point range for a team that finished 38-1 with the lone loss coming to Wisconsin in the Final Four. -- GP \n34. CHEICK DIALLO, Kansas \nThere are obviously still questions as to whether or not he'll be eligible. But if Diallo can play, he's one of the better athletes to come through the Big 12 in a while as a big man. He'll run the floor as well as any other center, and his motor should fit in well with Bill Self. -- SV \n35. BRICE JOHNSON, North Carolina \nJohnson was UNC's second-leading scorer and leading rebounder last season. He averaged 12.9 points and 7.8 boards while shooting 56.6 percent from the field, and he finished with 15 points on 7-of-9 shooting in UNC's loss to Wisconsin in the Sweet 16. -- GP \n36. TAUREAN PRINCE, Baylor \nPrince was one of the best per-possession scoring threats last season, averaging 14 points in only 26 minutes per game. He's also a strong defender, and he'll be counted on to put up better numbers this season for the Bears. -- SV \n37. TROY WILLIAMS, Indiana \nLove Troy Williams' game. He's seen as a top-20 NBA pick right now by plenty. If he's gained more muscle and continues to fly to the lane, he'll make us look bad for having him this low. Energy is endless, and he's got such great hops. Indiana is capable of winning 25 games this season with Williams factoring in so heavily. -- MN \n38. GARY PAYTON II, Oregon State \nPretty cool to see The Glove's son (The Mitten!) become this good. Payton's 95 steals were third-most in the country last season. His defensive win shares mark was second among all D-I players, only behind Willie Cauley-Stein. Oregon State is among the ripes candidates for Team-That-Could-Make-The-NCAAs-A-Lot-Easier-Than-You-Think. Payton 2.0 is crucial to that. -- MN \n39. STERLING GIBBS, UConn \nThis is my pick for America's most impactful transfer. Remember, before Seton Hall's season went off the rails, he was a legitimate All-America candidate. Look for him to be the lead guard that replaces Ryan Boatright this year. -- SV \n40. FRANK MASON, Kansas \nMason has gone from a 3-star prospect some thought might never contribute at Kansas to one of the nation's best point guards. The 5-foot-11 junior averaged 12.6 points, 3.9 assists and 3.9 rebounds last season while shooting 42.9 percent from 3-point range. -- GP \n41. GRAYSON ALLEN, Duke \nAllen was caught in a numbers-game in Duke's backcourt last season and only averaged 4.4 points in 9.2 minutes per game. But he showed his ability with a 16-point effort during Duke's win over Wisconsin in the national championship game, and he'll be a primary option for the Blue Devils this season. -- GP \n42. MALIK NEWMAN, Mississippi State \nNewman became the first five-star recruit to sign with Mississippi State after Ben Howland was hired, and it'll surprised nobody if he leads the SEC in scoring this season. He's a combo guard and explosive scorer thanks to his ability to get to the rim and also shoot from beyond the arc. --GP \n43. A.J. HAMMONS, Purdue \nHammons is a tremendously skilled player for his size, with great touch around the rim and the ability to score from the post. However, it's his defense that places him high on this list, as there are few better rim protectors in the entire country. He just needs to stay on the floor for 30 minutes per game this year. -- SV \n44. JAMES BLACKMON JR. Indiana \nI tracked the Freshman of the Year race for the site last season. Blackmon Jr. was a top-five candidate almost wire to wire. His skillset fits so well into Tom Crean's system. Yes, the defense is lacking. But Blackmon's game when the ball is in his hands is like few others in college hoops. He was a little bit of a breakout star last season. Now he'll be expected to do even more. -- MN \n45. STEFAN MOODY, Ole Miss \nMoody's adjustment from junior college to the SEC was mostly seamless last season. The 5-foot-10 guard averaged 16.6 points, 3.4 rebounds and 2.4 assists while leading the Rebels to the NCAA Tournament , where he scored 26 points in a wild win over BYU. -- GP \n46. JOSH SCOTT, Colorado \nScott struggled last year with a back injury, but when he's healthy he's one of the better big men in America. He's a tremendous rebounder, and can score from either block. He'll need a big season to take Colorado back to the tournament. -- SV \n47. ZACH AUGUSTE, Notre Dame \nCannot deny that Auguste's showing in last year's NCAA Tournament boosted his ranking here by at least 20 spots. He broke through, played well against NBA-level competition and proved he's got the body and agility to qualify as a top-50 college talent. It's quite possible he'll shoot 65 percent from the field this season. -- MN \n48. DANIEL HAMILTON, UConn \nHamilton is another player at UConn that will take a step forward this season. He averaged nearly 11 points per game as a freshman last season in high minutes. Now, he just needs to work on his efficiency, particularly around the rim given his slashing ability. -- SV Maryland's Jake Lyman chose to return for his senior season and is No. 49 on our list of Top 100 (and one) Players (USATSI) 49. JAKE LAYMAN, Maryland \nLayman's decision to return for his senior year is among the biggest reasons Maryland is most people's pick to win the Big Ten. The 6-foot-9 forward averaged 12.5 points and 5.8 rebounds last season while shooting 37.8 percent from 3-point range. -- GP \n50. MALIK POPE, San Diego State \nPope is highly thought of in NBA circles for good reason, given his skill set and length at 6-10. Plus, he should now be fully recovered from a knee injury that occurred in his senior year of high school. However, he did only put up four double-digit scoring games last season, so he'll need to show us that skill before moving up this list. -- SV \n51. KENNEDY MEEKS, North Carolina \nMeeks lost roughly 50 pounds before his sophomore season and became a different player for the Tar Heels. The 6-foot-9 forward averaged 11.4 points and 7.3 rebounds last season in 23.3 minutes per game. He shot 56.2 percent from the field. -- GP \n52. A.J. ENGLISH, Iona \nEnglish was the third player since 1999 to average 20 points, five rebounds and five assists last season. Yeah, Iona runs a pretty up-tempo system, but he's the catalyst of that system and is quite deserving of accolade. -- SV \n53. XAVIER RATHAN-MAYES, Florida State \nKnown for scoring 30 points in four and a half minutes against Miami, Rathan-Mayes scored 15 points per game while also dishing out 4.3 assists per. He'll be a leader on this Florida State team that has designs on the NCAA Tournament . -- SV \n54. HENRY ELLENSON, Marquette \nI did a story on this fella back in the summer of 2014 . He's got a very good game, some power and some baby-touch. He's going to make Marquette worth watching this season, and if he stays for two years (I expect him to), then MU will be in the 2017 NCAA Tournament . -- MN \n55. KELLEN DUNHAM, Butler \nDunham was a borderline top-100 prospect coming out of high school but is now someone who has led a Big East program in scoring each of the past two seasons. He averaged 16.5 points last season while shooting 41.0 percent from 3-point range.\n56. E.C. MATTHEWS, Rhode Island \nMatthews is a 6-4 guard that averaged 17 points per game for Rhode Island last year. He's basically impossible to keep out of the lane with his quick first step and smooth handle. He should lead the Rams back to the NCAAs this year. -- SV \n57. DWAYNE BACON, Florida State \nFreshman wing who is probably going to put up at least 13 points per game almost by default. We think he's more talented than his new teammate, Xavier Rathan-Mayes. Bacon was considered a top-15 talent in class of 2015, a McDonald's All-American who has a natural stroke and controls the ball with confidence. -- MN \n58. DAMION LEE, Louisville \nMaking his first appearance on our top 100 since he came in at No. 95 in 2012 . Lee is the outstanding scorer Rick Pitino's been searching for since Russ Smith left. (And Lee is less erratic than Smith, though obviously not as good with on-ball defense.) He's probably the most important transfer for a major program in the upcoming season. -- MN \n59. JAMEEL MCKAY, Iowa State \nMcKay made a huge impact when he became eligible for the Cyclones last season after the first semester. The 6-foot-9 forward averaged 11.0 points, 7.6 rebounds and 2.4 blocks, and he scored in double-figures 16 times in 25 games. -- GP \n60. SHAWN LONG, Louisiana-Lafayette \nMaking his second straight appearance on our list. Long was No. 79 last season, and his 16.4-points and 10.2 rebounds per game while being The Guy (remember, he previously played with now-in-the-NBA Elfrid Payton) only enhanced our respect for his skill. Could play for any team in the country. -- MN Shawn Long of Louisiana-Lafayette is one of the best players in the country most don't know. (USATSI) 61. DANUEL HOUSE, Texas A&M \nHe averaged nearly 15 points per game last season for Texas A&M after getting a waiver to play immediately following his transfer from Houston. House knocks down 3s at a tremendous clip, and will likely be the leading scorer on a top-25 team. -- SV \n62. JUSTIN JACKSON, North Carolina \nJackson was UNC's fourth-leading scorer last season. The 6-foot-8 forward and former top-10 national recruit averaged 10.7 points in 26.7 minutes per game as a freshman. He'll likely be a first-round pick if he enters the 2016 NBA Draft . -- GP \n63. SHELDON MCLELLAN, Miami \nHe'll be 23 years old by the time Christmas arrives. McLellan is the best player Miami has. Expect his 14.5-point and 4.7-rebound average to climb higher this season. He was the second-best shooter from the field among all guards in the Pac-12, ACC, Big Ten, Big 12 and SEC. -- MN \n64. JOHN BROWN, High Point \nThere have been more than 10,000 men who have played Division I basketball in the past six seasons. Sports-Reference has a list of the 100 best seasons in that span in terms of perhaps the most valuable metric for value: player efficiency rating (PER). John Brown occupies three of those spots in the top 100 . His career PER is second-best in all of college basketball since 2009, only falling behind Morehead State's Kenneth Faried. Brown was No. 86 on our list a year ago. -- MN \n65. ANTHONY DRMIC, Boise State \nDrmic will probably become Boise State's all-time leading scorer this year after stepping back into the Broncos' lineup this year after missing the last one with an ankle injury. He'll have a shot to win the Mountain West player of the year award. -- SV \n66. JALEN BRUNSON, Villanova \nBrunson was the MVP of the U19 World Championships this summer. He's a bit Tyus Jones-like in his patience and basketball IQ, and it wouldn't be out of the question for him to have a similar impact at Villanova. -- SV \n67. CAT BARBER, NC State \nBarber takes over the reins as NC State's lead guard from Trevor Lacey. He's a terrific athlete, and will be the catalyst for a really solid NC State team. -- SV \n68. KALEB TARCZEWSKI, Arizona \nTarczewski is Arizona's leading returning scorer and rebounder. The 7-foot center averaged 9.3 points and 5.2 rebounds last season while shooting 57.2 percent from the field. But those numbers were actually down, across the board, from his sophomore season. -- GP \n69. JALAN WEST, Northwestern State \nAny player who plays some serious H-O-R-S-E with his school's president is OK by me. According to Sports-Reference, the only player on this list who was worth more win shares than Jalan West last season: Kyle Wiltjer. West is a guy who, according to coaches I've spoken with in the Southland, is quite clearly the best player in the league. He led the nation in assist average, and at 5-foot-10, is one of the most entertaining guys out there. Root for his team to make the NCAA Tournament . -- MN \n70. DORIAN FINNEY-SMITH, Florida \nFinney-Smith averaged 13 points last season. He has potential to flourish in Mike White's system as a terrific athlete who can get out in the open floor and also shoot the ball from distance. -- SV \n71. ERON HARRIS, Michigan State \nHarris has a chance to be one of the best transfers in college basketball this season. He averaged a team-leading 17.2 points per game at West Virginia two years ago whole shooting 42.2 percent from 3-point range and 85.6 percent from the free throw line. -- GP \n72. BRONSON KOENIG, Wisconsin \nKoenig became Wisconsin's starting point guard midway through last season and flourished in the role. The 6-foot-4 junior averaged 11.5 points per game as a starter and ended up leading the Big Ten with a 2.7 assist-to-turnover ratio. -- GP \n73. KAHLIL FELDER, Oakland \nFelder is a stud at the mid-major level. He's without a doubt one of the top 80 players in college hoops right now. Averaged 18.1 points, 7.6 assists and 4.8 rebounds. Played 95.7 percent of his team's minutes last season, the highest of any player in the nation. Accounted for more than 1,150 of his team's points last season (scoring + assists). And his 7.6 assists per game was second only to Jalan West. -- MN \n74. RYAN ANDERSON, Arizona \nPredicting production from Arizona this season is tough. But when it comes down to it, what Anderson proved he could do at Boston College warrants him being this high on the list. He might not fall on a top 101 list of most valuable players, but the skill and a year away to improve his game have us thinking he'll show flashes of star play in the desert. Was No. 81 on our list in 2013. -- MN \n75. ALLONZO TRIER, Arizona \nOne of the best pure scorers in this freshman class, he's going to get a chance to jack up a lot of shots with an Arizona team that needs to replace an awful lot of offense. -- SV \n76. STEPHEN ZIMMERMAN, UNLV \nZimmerman is the latest one-and-done prospect to enroll at UNLV under Dave Rice. The McDonald's All-American led his high school to four consecutive state titles in Nevada. He's a 7-foot forward who picked the Rebels over Kentucky, Kansas, UCLA and Arizona, among others. -- GP \n77. ROOSEVELT JONES, Butler \nThis year's resident “old man game” champion, Jones will be one of the leaders on a strong Butler team. He does it all for the Bulldogs. -- SV \n78. AMIDA BRIMAH, UConn \nBrimah is the reigning American Athletic Conference Defensive Player of the Year who led the nation with 121 blocks last season. The 7-foot center shot 67.4 percent from the field last season, which is the best field goal percentage any UConn player has ever recorded. -- GP UConn's Amida Brimah is a defensive force and came in at No. 78 on our list. (USATSI) 79. MAODO LO, Columbia \nThe Ivy's sole representative on our list, Lo is a terrific shooter and scorer. He got a lot of experience playing this summer with the German national team, and that will only help him with Columbia this year. -- SV \n80. DIAMOND STONE, Maryland \nStone is a consensus top-10 recruit and one of the highest-rated prospects to ever enroll at Maryland. The 6-foot-11 center led his high school to four consecutive state championships in Wisconsin and averaged 24.4 points and 11.7 rebounds per game as a senior. -- GP \n81. DANIEL OCHEFU, Villanova \nHave talked to some coaches in the conference who think Ochefu is one of the five best players in the Big East. He's become an NBA prospect, for sure. He shot 64 percent from the field and grabbed 21.3 percent of his team's rebounds. Huge numbers. -- MN \n82. MARKUS KENNEDY, SMU \nExpect Kennedy to put up at least 13/8 this season, a year that will amount to playing for pride and pro-ball stock for Kennedy and Nic Moore. The big man will keep SMU a top-30 team from start to finish, I think. Was No. 65 on our list last season. -- MN \n83. IVAN RABB, California \nCal is going to be a lot of fun to watch this season. Not a ton of depth but the starting five will be among the six or seven most talented in the country. Rabb factors in, big-time. The lanky freshman is 6-foot-11 and will probably score at least 10 per game based on his glass-going skills. -- MN \n84. DERRYCK THORNTON, Duke \nThorton's decision in April to reclassify to the Class of 2015 and enroll at Duke was huge for the Blue Devils because it filled an undeniable hole at point guard. His presence will give Duke a legitimate chance to repeat as national champions. -- GP \n85. LUKE KENNARD, Duke \nHe's the next one in a long line of hated Duke players. A terrific shooter that also has great basketball sense, he'll help to replace Justise Winslow on the wing and Tyus Jones in the backcourt. -- SV \n86. TREVON BLUIETT, Xavier \nBluiett averaged 11 points per game as a freshman last season, and should step up in a big way to help replace the departing Matt Stainbrook and their other departed seniors. -- SV \n87. ALEX POYTHRESS, Kentucky \nPoythress will likely never be the player some projected him to be coming out of high school, but he should be an important piece at Kentucky this season. He missed the final 29 games last season with a torn ACL. -- GP \n88. JAMES WOODARD, Tulsa \nWoodard averaged 14.5 points per game last season, which ranked third among all American Athletic Conference players. He shot 38.5 percent from 3-point ranged and led Tulsa to a 14-4 record league record. -- GP \n89. CRAIG BRADSHAW, Belmont \nI would've had him higher, but so goes the democratic voting process. Sterling Gibbs and Maodo Lo are the only players represented on this list who shot better from 3-point range last year than Bradshaw's 42.3-percent clip, but Bradshaw was a better 2-point shooter than those guys. Also, check what he did against Virginia in the NCAAs. His 25-point showing against the Cavs was more than any other player put up on Tony Bennett's team last season. -- MN \n90. HASSAN MARTIN, Rhode Island \nI have a story on Martin coming to the site soon. He's one of the best shot-blockers in the country (3.1 bpg last season), but also an all-around defensive menace who's developed a good touch to his paint game and is certainly on a path to proving he's among the Atlantic 10's best players. -- MN \n91. TIM QUARTERMAN, LSU \nI'm not real big on the fit between Quarterman and Simmons, but he's a terrific ball-handler, passer and scorer, plus at his size can defend all three backcourt positions. -- SV \n92. ISAIAH WHITEHEAD, Seton Hall \nWhitehead only played 22 games last season because of an injury, but he was still named to the Big East's All-Rookie team. He averaged 12.0 points, 3.9 rebounds and 3.5 assists per game while recording at least five assists in nine of his 22 appearances. -- GP \n93. JAMEEL WARNEY, Stony Brook \nCould very easily be one of the three most important players at the mid-/low-major level this season. Meaning he might be slotted too low. Is good enough to start in the frontcourt for a number of top 25 teams. Last season averaged 16.4 points and 11.7 rebounds, meaning he averaged more combined points and rebounds than any other returning player in the sport. -- MN \n94. WINSTON SHEPARD, San Diego State \nOne of San Diego State's many great two-way players, Shepard will need to take a much bigger step forward offensively without J.J. O'Brien in the mix. -- SV \n95. JACK GIBBS, Davidson \nGibbs led the Atlantic 10 in assists and free throw percentage last season. The 6-foot point guard averaged 16.2 points, 4.8 assists and 3.7 rebounds while shooting 42.5 percent from 3-point range and 85.6 percent from the free throw line. He finished the season by scoring in double-digits nine straight times. -- GP \n96. MALCOLM HILL, Illinois \nHill averaged 15.1 points in Big Ten games last season, which ranked 10th in the league. He scored a career-high 28 points in a career-high 39 minutes in January's win over Maryland. -- GP \n97. RASHEED SULAIMON, Maryland \nA four-time selectee! Sulaimon has made this list every year of his college career. We slotted him 87th as he entered his freshman season at Duke in 2012. The next year, all the way up to 33rd . Last season? Seventy-fifth . This list wouldn't feel right without him on it, and even on a loaded Maryland team, it's hard to argue against Sulaimon being among the 101 most talented players in the game. -- MN \n98. TYLER DORSEY, Oregon \nHe had a huge summer with the Greek national team, making the U19 All-Tournament team. He'll help Dylan Ennis to replace the departed Joseph Young. -- SV \n99. D.J. BALENTINE, Evansville \nBack-to-back appearances by Balentine, who's bumped himself up from 100 to 99 ! Versatile, reliable and certainly the most valuable player in the Missouri Valley. Is good enough to key Evansville to an auto bid come March, but of course getting by Wichita State, which has two players rated highly on this list, is a task and a half. -- MN \n100. VINCE EDWARDS, Purdue \nThis is more of a speculative add on my part. Edwards can score, pass, get out in transition, and defend multiple positions 2 through 4. He's one of those swiss-army knives that can do it all and should help Purdue be a borderline top-25 team this season. -- SV \n101. SVI MYKHAILIUK, Kansas \nWho? How you say that?\n\nGet to working pronouncing this kid's name, because if the NBA Draft were to spontaneously be held tomorrow, there's a very good chance Mykhailiuk would be selected. This despite his palty 2.8 points and 11.1 minutes average from a season ago. Considering his reputation, and how he could blossom into an extremely good player, it'd be foolish not to list him. He is absolutely one of the 101 most talented players in the sport right now. -- MN \nTopics: Arizona Wildcats , Baylor Bears , Belmont Bruins , Boise State Broncos , Brigham Young Cougars , Butler Bulldogs , California Golden Bears , Colorado Buffaloes , Columbia Lions , Connecticut Huskies , Davidson Wildcats , Duke Blue Devils , Evansville Aces , Florida Gators , Florida State Seminoles , Georgetown Hoyas , Gonzaga Bulldogs , High Point Panthers , Illinois Fighting Illini , Indiana Hoosiers , Iona Gaels , Iowa State Cyclones , Kansas Jayhawks , Kentucky Wildcats , LSU Tigers , Louisville Cardinals , Marquette Golden Eagles , Maryland Terrapins , Miami (Fla.)
