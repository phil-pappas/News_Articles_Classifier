The Bruins, however, will be out for revenge after being upset by the Cardinal last year.\nMORE: Week 7 Pac-12 Power Rankings\nIowa at Northwestern © Provided by Sporting News When: Saturday, noon\nTV: ABC\nThe line: Pick'em\nBender: Iowa 20-17\nBradley: Iowa 27-23\nBrewer: Iowa 21-17\nGriffith: Iowa 20-10\nHayes: Northwestern 20-17\nIsner: Northwestern 20-10\nJones: Northwestern 27-24\nWhat we're saying\nBender: Iowa is dealing with a rash of injuries, but the Hawkeyes have won three of the last four in this series and rank second in the Big Ten in rush defense (78.0 yards per game). It will be tight, but a late score propels the Hawkeyes to victory.\nGriffith: Iowa is on a roll, and Northwestern is coming off the sort of 38-0 loss at Michigan that makes players take a long look in the mirror. Iowa is the more physical team and knows what it’s about. The Wildcats, meanwhile, are in the midst of an identity crisis.\nMORE: Week 7 Big Ten Power Rankings\nLouisville at FSU © Provided by Sporting News When: Saturday, noon\nTV: ESPN\nThe line: FSU (-6.5)\nBender: FSU 31-24\nBradley: FSU 24-20\nBrewer: FSU 38-24\nGriffith: FSU 27-20\nHayes: FSU 27-23\nIsner: FSU 37-13\nJones: FSU 31-17\nWhat we're saying\nBender: Everett Golson still hasn't thrown an interception. Can you give him a little credit? He'll be tested by Louisville's pass rush, but another strong day from Dalvin Cook allows Florida State to stay unbeaten.\nBrewer: FSU should win this one at home. I picked against them last weekend at home, so I refuse to make that same mistake twice. I like Louisville to keep it close in the first half, but Everett Golson will take care of things late.\nMORE: Week 7 ACC Power Rankings\nAlabama at Texas A&M © Provided by Sporting News When: Saturday, 3:30 p.m.\nTV: CBS\nThe line: Alabama (-4.5)\nBender: Alabama 31-27\nBradley: Alabama 27-24\nBrewer: Texas A&M 41-35\nGriffith: Alabama 24-21\nHayes: Texas A&M 30-27\nIsner: Alabama 35-20\nJones: Alabama 27-20\nWhat we're saying\nHayes: Maybe this is the game where Tide QB Jake Coker puts it all together. Or maybe Texas A&M DC John Chavis, who has had much success against the Tide, finds a way to extend Coker’s uneven play and force key turnovers.\nIsner: Bama has found its mojo after the thrashing of UGA. Saban has them exactly where he wants his team. Will be a great atmosphere but Bama will pull away in the end.\nJones: Texas A&M is having a great season but they are gonna have to beat Bama before I'm a believer. Bama wins and covers.\nMORE: This week's AP Top 25\nMichigan State at Michigan © Provided by Sporting News When: Saturday, 3:30 p.m.\nTV: ESPN\nThe line: Michigan (-7.5)\nBender: Michigan 23-20\nBradley: Michigan 17-13\nBrewer: Michigan 27-24\nGriffith: Michigan State 24-23\nHayes: Michigan State 19-17\nIsner: Michigan State 28-24\nJones: Michigan 24-20\nWhat we're saying\nBender: The spread is too high. Michigan State's two losses to Michigan under Mark Dantonio are by a combined six points. Connor Cook is the best quarterback the Wolverines have faced this season, and he'll test that secondary. Michigan State jumps out to an early lead here, but can the Spartans withstand the injuries in this one? Michigan wins — maybe on a late field goal — in an instant classic in this in-state rivalry.\nGriffith: The Spartans have won 10 straight games and 11 Big Ten road games in a row, but more importantly, they’ve won the last six games they’ve been in that have been decided by seven points or less. That streak dates back to a Rose Bowl win over a Stanford team that looked a lot like these Wolverines.\nHayes: Michigan hasn’t gotten enough out of the quarterback spot all season. Jake Rudock’s turnovers have gone way down the last three weeks, but this game, this atmosphere, this rivalry, is much different. This is where Spartans QB Conner Cook makes his mark in his senior season.\nMORE: The worst loss for every Big Ten team\nFlorida at LSU © Provided by Sporting News When: Saturday, 7 p.m.\nTV: ESPN\nThe line: LSU (-6)\nBender: LSU 23-13\nBradley: LSU 30-21\nBrewer: Florida 24-20\nGriffith: LSU 27-23\nHayes: LSU 16-13\nIsner: LSU 30-13\nJones: LSU 34-24\nWhat we're saying\nJones: Can't believe Grier is done. Really heartbreaking for all Gators. Certainly influences the line and ultimately the game. Whole key is stopping Fournette. LSU is a tough place to play so I think they win the game. I do think the Gators keep it close until a late score by LSU covers the spread.\nBrewer: I am picking UF here because I am a Gator for life, but I am very worried about this one. No Will Grier is trouble, but I think Treon Harris can win this game under the lights in Baton Rouge. If Florida can find some way to contain Fournette and make LSU have to throw on our great corners, we can win it.\nHayes: The game plan for each: don’t screw up. Load up on defense to stop the run (LSU TB Leonard Fournette, Florida TB Kelvin Taylor) and force the quarterbacks (LSU’s Brandon Harris, Florida’s Treon Harris) to win the game. All things being equal (see: turnovers), Fournette will break through and be the difference.\nMORE: SN's Week 7 SEC Power Rankings\nUSC at Notre Dame © Provided by Sporting News When: Saturday, 7:30 p.m.\nTV: NBC\nThe line: Notre Dame (-5)\nBender: Notre Dame 38-23\nBradley: USC 34-31\nBrewer: Notre Dame 38-24\nGriffith: Notre Dame 34-31\nHayes: Notre Dame 30-24\nIsner: Notre Dame 31-14\nJones: Notre Dame 31-20\nWhat we're saying\nIsner: J ust too much controversy surrounding USC at this moment. Notre Dame still has a lot to play for this season.\nMORE: Ranking the best 1-loss teams\nPenn State at Ohio State © Provided by Sporting News When: Saturday, 8 p.m.\nTV: ABC\nThe line: Ohio State (-17)\nBender: Ohio State 38-17\nBradley: Ohio State 42-20\nBrewer: Ohio State 42-24\nGriffith: Ohio State 38-17\nHayes: Ohio State 31-13\nIsner: Ohio State 30-17\nJones: Ohio State 41-17\nWhat we're saying\nBender: The Buckeyes are breaking out the black uniforms for this one, a chance to flex their muscles in primetime at Ohio Stadium and remind everybody who the defending national champions are. The Nittany Lions are the only Big Ten team that's won at The Horseshoe at night, but that was back in 2008. Ohio State pulls away in the second half here.\nGriffith: Remember how the Nittany Lions took Ohio State to overtime last year? Yes? Well the Buckeyes also remember that, and that should serve as the right wake-up call for the Ohio State offense. Penn State is a banged up team, and Christian Hackenberg will get sacked early and often.\nDIRTY DOZEN: 12 players you wish were on your team\nArizona State at Utah © Provided by Sporting News When: Saturday, 10 p.m.\nTV: ESPN\nThe line: Utah (-7)\nBender: Utah 34-24\nBradley: Utah 40-28\nBrewer: Utah 35-20\nGriffith: Arizona State 30-28\nHayes: Utah 34-28\nIsner: Utah 45-30\nJones: Utah 34-24\nWhat we're saying\nHayes: Travis Wilson says he has to play better. If he does, no one in the Pac-12 will beat Utah.\nHAYES: Travis Wilson gives Utes best chance at perfection\nOregon at Washington © Provided by Sporting News When: Saturday, 10:30 p.m.\nTV: ESPN2\nThe line: Washington (-1)\nBender: Oregon 41-38\nBradley: Washington 31-27\nBrewer: Washington 38-30\nGriffith: Oregon 30-27\nHayes: Washington 27-24\nIsner: Washington 34-30\nJones: Washington 27-24\nWhat we're saying\nBradley: It's amazing how perception changed so quickly with the Ducks after a 42-point loss to Utah and loss last week to Washington State. It begins and ends with QB play and it's clear Oregon was spoiled with having Marcus Mariota running the show.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/TheCoreyBrewer", "http://www.sportingnews.com/list/4658194-acc-conference-week-7-power-rankings-clemson-fsu-college-football-playoff-contenders", "https://twitter.com/RealCJ10", "http://www.sportingnews.com/list/4658190-pac-12-week-7-rankings-utah-stanford-arizona-state-ucla-cal-usc", "https://twitter.com/KenBradleySN", "http://www.sportingnews.com/list/4656179-week-4-college-football-picks-line-florida-tennessee-arizona-ucla-tcu-texas-tech", "http://www.sportingnews.com/list/4658189-sec-conference-week-7-rankings-lsu-florida-texas-am-ole-miss-alabama", "https://twitter.com/JohnIsner", "http://www.sportingnews.com/list/4656869-week-5-college-football-picks-line-alabama-underdog-georgia-notre-dame-clemson", "http://linemakers.sportingnews.com/list/4658197-heisman-trophy-odds-to-win-2015-favorites-betting-fournette-chubb-boykin-russell", "http://www.sportingnews.com/list/4658192-big-ten-conference-power-rankings-week-7-michigan-michigan-state-ohio-state-iowa", "https://twitter.com/BillBender92", "http://www.sportingnews.com/list/4657965-college-football-rankings-top-20-power-poll-week-7-baylor-ohio-state-utah-tcu", "http://www.sportingnews.com/", "http://www.sportingnews.com/list/4654824-week-2-college-football-picks-line-michigan-state-oregon-oklahoma-tennessee/slide/353568", "http://linemakers.sportingnews.com/article/4658140-odds-to-win-national-championship-college-football-2016-vegas-michigan-clemson", "http://www.sportingnews.com/list/4654194-week-1-college-football-picks-spread-michigan-alabama-auburn-notre-dame-texas", "https://twitter.com/MikeGriffith32", "http://www.sportingnews.com/list/4657829-dirty-dozen-college-football-baddest-players-leonard-fournette-dalvin-cook", "http://www.sportingnews.com/list/4657541-week-6-college-football-picks-line-michigan-northwestern-cal-utah-alabama-florida", "http://www.sportingnews.com/list/4655534-week-3-college-football-picks-line-alabama-ole-miss-notre-dame-georgia-tech", "https://twitter.com/Matt_HayesSN", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "http://www.sportingnews.com/list/4657874-ap-poll-top-25-ohio-state-alabama-florida-michigan-state-utah-tcu", "http://www.sportingnews.com/list/4657326-big-ten-worst-losses-ohio-state-michigan-penn-state-appalachian-state?iadid=HOME%20PAGEFront_List_2", "http://www.sportingnews.com/ncaa-football/story/2015-10-11/utah-beats-cal-travis-wilson-quarterback-consistency-college-football-playoff", "http://www.sportingnews.com/list/4657839-one-loss-teams-college-football-playoff-contenders-alabama-michigan-ole-miss-notre-dame", "http://www.sportingnews.com/list/4658137-midseason-awards-mvp-player-coach-quarterback-team-best-game-leonard-fournette"], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T13:06:40.114+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
