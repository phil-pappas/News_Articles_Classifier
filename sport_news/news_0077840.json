A maximum quantity of 23,340 tonne was seized in Maharashtra, followed by 4,525.192 tonne in Chhattisgarh, 2,546 tonne in Telangana and 2,295 tonne in Madhya Pradesh. Other states where the government authorities cracked down on hoarders were Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Rajasthan. Officials said the huge amount of seizure was a proof that there was no real shortage of pulses and high prices were being “artificially maintained” by hoarders. Meanwhile, questions are being raised about the “absence” of Agriculture Minister Radha Mohan Singh and Consumer Affairs Minister Ram Vilas Paswan — the two key players “busy” with the Bihar elections. The Food and Consumers Affairs Ministry today said 1,168 tonne pulses have been recovered in 227 raids in Haryana and 2.44 tonne have been seized in Himachal. The Haryana government-run HAFED has reportedly been asked to procure pulses from market and sell through its outlets to curb the price rise. In Uttarakhand, retail counters of pulses have been opened in Dehradun, Haridwar, Udhamsingh Nagar by mandi samitis where “arhar dal” is being sold for Rs 145 per kg. Officials said the Centre was taking several steps to improve the domestic supply by creating 40,000 tonne buffer stock with the pulses procured from farmers at market rates and not the MSP. Besides augmenting domestic supply through imports, the government has imposed stock limits on traders, departmental stores, licensed food processors, importers and exports. Meanwhile, the Agriculture Minister and the Consumer Affairs Minister invited the ire of opposition leaders, including JD-U’s KC Tyagi, for “ignoring” the consumers’ plight and being busy with the Bihar polls. “People are suffering because of the Centre’s delayed reaction to the crisis,” a leader said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T04:07:06.051+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
