WHERE IS THE MATCH BEING PLAYED? The Emirates Stadium. WHY IS IT WORTH FOLLOWING? After the midweek victory over Bayern (coming so soon after the similarly thrilling home success against Man Utd), the good times are well and truly back at Arsenal. The team have reawakened their European hopes and now, emboldened by their recent form, will surely have set their sights on establishing themselves as legitimate Premier League title challengers over the next few weeks. A win over Everton would be a solid start to that plan, with the Toffees needing to pick themselves up quickly after a disappointing home performance against Manchester United the previous weekend. Roberto Martinez's side were abject in that game at Goodison Park - much to everyone's surprise - but, after their own positive start to the campaign, will be aware that grabbing anything at the Emirates would be a positive response. TEAM NEWS Arsenal will be missing Aaron Ramsey for Saturday's Premier League clash against Everton, as the midfielder faces up to a month out because of a hamstring injury. Centre-back Gabriel is available again following illness, but captain Mikel Arteta (ankle) misses out against his former club. Goalkeeper David Ospina (shoulder) is not available, while Jack Wilshere (fibula), forward Danny Welbeck and Czech midfielder Tomas Rosicky (both knee) all continue their rehabilitation. Everton midfielder Tom Cleverley is in contention to make his first-team return at Arsenal on Saturday as Roberto Martinez's squad nears full fitness. Cleverley got his first run-out since sustaining an ankle injury in August when he played 60 minutes of an under-21 game on Tuesday. And asked on Thursday whether the summer signing would play in this weekend's Barclays Premier League match at the Emirates Stadium, Toffees boss Martinez said: \"It is just a case of seeing how he reacts from the game on Tuesday. \"The next two sessions are going to be very important.\" MANAGER QUOTES Roberto Martinez: \"We will have to go back to our normal dynamic and positive approach at the Emirates and match what they have been doing because they have been quite impressive with what they have been doing of late. \"Against Bayern, Arsenal showed that they can do a bit of everything. They were really, really solid against Manchester United and then they were really disciplined and well organised against Bayern Munich in the same way they were fantastic against Watford and what they did on the ball and attacking, they were very creative and very much an attacking force going forward. \"They are an outstanding, outstanding outfit. They are not one dimensional at all and have a real understanding of how to play in many different ways.” Arsene Wenger (on choosing between Olivier Giroud and Theo Walcott): \"It’s always hard, honestly, because they are two top players. I consider the form and the game of the day but at the end of the season both will have played their share of games. At the moment it is Theo (starting) and in a few weeks it might be Giroud, but what is most important is that they both contribute.\" - Follow Joy Sports on Twitter: @Joy997FM.
