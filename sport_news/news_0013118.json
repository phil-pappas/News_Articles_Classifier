Kennedy head football coach Andrew Maurizio, who resigned earlier this week, has been transferred from the high school to an elementary school in the district, according to Woodbridge Township Public Schools Superintendent Robert Zega. \nMaurizio’s reassignment to Port Reading School No. 9 was approved during a Board of Education meeting on Thursday night. \nZega said Maurizio, a tenured teacher, “took some time off” following the announcement of his resignation on Monday and will return to teaching next week. \n“We thought it would be better for everyone if he wasn’t in the building he used to coach at, and that’s something that we normally do,” said Zega, noting the transfer was “just better\" for the new coach. \nFreshman coach Tom McFadden has been promoted to interim head coach and will lead the Mustangs (0-5) into Saturday’s game at Monmouth Regional. \nJ.F. Kennedy Athletics Director Sean Daly and Zega both said Maurizio stepped down of his own accord and that they would have no further comment on the coach’s resignation, citing a personnel matter. \n“He’s been a great coach for Kennedy football,” Daly said of Maurizio, who graduated in 2002 from the high school, where he was the team’s quarterback and safety. “He bleeds green and loves the kids. We wish him the best of luck in his future endeavors.” \nA text message left for Maurizio, who exits with a 12-15 career record, was not immediately returned. \nMaurizio took over the program in 2013, inheriting a 2-7 team. The Mustangs made the playoffs in his first season and made a second consecutive postseason appearance for the first time in school history last year. \nJ.F. Kennedy’s 7-4 record a year ago marked the school’s first winning record since 2004, when the Mustangs finished 7-3. \nThe Mustangs are in the midst of a six-game losing streak dating back to last season during which they have been outscored 203-71, or by an average of 22 points. \nGraduation decimated J.F. Kennedy, which has struggled to overcome the loss of two of its three biggest playmakers, Terrence Young and Stepp Oziegbe, who combined for 980 receiving yards last season. \nThree-year starting quarterback Andrew Roberts entered last weekend’s game against Bishop Ahr having passed for 297 yards and rushed for 171 more, accounting for 77 percent of his team’s offense. 1 CONNECT 12 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://mycj.co/1RN5MhY TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T23:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T15:33:47.194+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
