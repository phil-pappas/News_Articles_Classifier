Just worry about what we can control, what happens in this room, what happens on the ice.”\nThe Maple Leafs — who’ll have Jonathan Bernier in net — travel to Buffalo on Wednesday to take on the Sabres in a game between the two young teams in a rebuild.\nMuch has changed for both since last year: On-ice personnel, coaching staffs, expectations.\nOne thing that hasn’t: Wins and losses. The Sabres are 1-4-0. The Leafs are 1-3-1.\nNormally, in Toronto, there’d panic in the streets. But the temperature around the team is far from sizzling. There are no demands the coach be fired. No star winger to go through scoring slumps.\n“That’s the great thing with hiring Mike Babcock,” said forward Daniel Winnik. “For the first time in a while you’re not having the fans say: ‘fire the coach’ when things go sour. The villagers would rally and call for the coach. Every time.\n“Now the stability of Mike, that’s what’s keeping everything calm. No one is bigger than the coach. No player can dictate. It’s nice.”\nThere’s no controversy. By comparison, the Leafs are boring.\n“It’s great,” said Rielly. “Last year we had our moments where we weren’t proud of certain things. This is a big thing for us. We want to make people proud of us. We want to be proud of ourselves. We want to behave the right way. Play hard. We want not to have any controversy, just to be boring.”\nSo for once, the Maple Leafs are on the backburner — on simmer, as it were — while the Blue Jays roil.\n“The more the hype has built for the Blue Jays . . . it’s not a bad thing, it’s not a good thing, it’s just how it is,” said Rielly. “It’s fantastic.”\nThe focus, then, is on the game where the Leafs will continue their early season theme of renewing acquaintances with former teammates. After facing David Clarkson in Columbus and Phil Kessel in Pittsburgh, it’s off to Buffalo for Cody Franson.\n“Cody and I were good friends when he was here,” said Rielly. “It’s not weird for me. But maybe it’s weird for them playing againsT their old team. It’s always fun. It’s a cool part about the game, creating friendships and playing against friends.”\nFranson told reporters in Buffalo he was looking forward to it.\n“When you play in a place like that for a long time, you develop those relationships,” said Franson. “I really enjoyed my time in Toronto, but this is the next chapter for me. I’m having a lot of fun here, and I want to take two points from those guys.”\nThe Leafs will be without Tyler Bozak, day-to-day with a lower body injury. He missed practice again Tuesday.\n“Day-to-day in this league has come to mean 10 days,” said Babcock. “They tell you day-to-day so you don’t get upset. But the days keep going by. The guy is going to play when he’s ready to play. In the meantime, someone else gets an opportunity.”\nMark Arcobello will dress as the fourth-line centre with Peter Holland moving to the second line between Shawn Matthias and Brad Boyes.\nMore on thestar.com\nLamar Odom taken to LA to continue care\nBlue Jays-Royals game leads to road closures in Toronto", "external_links": ["http://static.freeskreen.com/publisher/52/freeskreen.min.js"], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T23:38:49.832+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
