Kickoff is scheduled for 7 p.m.— and do tote the stadium blanket, with temperatures in the 30's forecast. \nVestal (4-2, 1-1 in Division II) responded to consecutive losses dealt by reigning sectional champions Maine-Endwell and Corning by getting the better of Union-Endicott last weekend, 28-6. \nThe Wildcats (3-3, 1-1) have won three of their last four, including last week by 30-13 over Horseheads. \n“We haven’t played JC in a long, long time,” Golden Bears coach Tank Anderson said. “That’s a big, strong, physical team. We’re going to have to buckle the chinstraps for that one. They beat U-E, played Maine-Endwell real tough, we know that’s an excellent team.” \nElsewhere around the Section 4 football scene: \nFRIDAY \nCorning (4-2) at Binghamton (4-2): Looks to shape up as a game that’ll determine which side hosts a Class AA semifinal. Each comes in with a 2-1 Division I record. A season ago, Corning put 61 and 58 points on the board in a pair of wins against the Patriots. \nOwego (4-2) at Norwich (2-4): The Purple Tornado has won two of its last three. Owego made it out of Windsor last week with a five-point victory, heading off a three-game slide. \nWindsor (3-3) at Waverly (5-1): The Wolverines were whacked for 290 rushing yards by Greene last weekend, but got a 15-for-20, 208-yard passing effort from Peyton Miller in a 28-14 win. \nWhitney Point (0-6) at Greene (2-4): The Trojans have dropped their last four— but no shame in doing so against opponents all state-ranked and with a combined 21-3 record (Deposit/Hancock, Forks, Newark Valley and Waverly). A week ago, Luke Erickson rushed for 208 yards and two TDs against the Wolverines. \nNewark Valley (5-1) at Sidney (3-3): Warriors junior Alex Hoskins heads his team’s receiving charts with 599 yards on a 28.5-per-catch average. Newark Valley took a small dip to No. 9 in Class C state rankings after last weekend’s loss to top-ranked Forks. \nWalton (5-1) at Bainbridge-Guilford (2-4): Dawson Beers, the Warriors’ 183-pound senior fullback, has rushed for 1,016 yards on 171 carries — or, 28 1-2 totes per game. He also leads the squad with 57 tackles from his linebacker spot. \nOxford (4-2) at Tioga (5-1): The sixth-ranked Tigers went for 404 yards of offense last weekend against Sidney. This marks the Blackhawks’ third game this season against a team ranked among the top 10 in Class D. \nDelhi (2-4) at Deposit/Hancock (6-0): Aside from a 34-28 outcome against Greene, fourth-ranked Deposit/Hancock has won its games by an average 28-point margin— and the last two have come by shutout. \nSeton Catholic Central (0-6) at Candor (1-5): The Saints, who haven’t scored a point the last two weekends, defeated Candor by a combined 95-32 the last two seasons. \nSATURDAY \nSusquehanna Valley (3-3) at Chenango Valley (5-1): Sabers coach Mike Ford sized up the Week 7 opponent by saying, “CV has excellent team speed. It seems all 11 guys on the field are quick.” \nA Chenango Valley victory would complete a 6-for-6 sweep through Division III before lining up against Chenango Forks in the regular-season finale. \nHarpursville (5-1) at Thomas A. Edison (2-4): The Hornets, ranked 14th in Class D, were 42-18 winners last year over Edison. \nUnion-Endicott (1-5) at Maine-Endwell (6-0): The Spartans will suit up for Homecoming having scored 107 points over the last two weekends— or, 35 more than the Tigers have produced this season. 1 CONNECT 2 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://press.sn/1Lw8g3u TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T22:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T00:32:24.044+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
