HOF jockey Mike Smith is on a lot of favorites and near favorites tonight.\n4 Lookinforadanger – Chance to be lone early speed, the best bet in horse racing; the caveat is her three career starts have all come on grass, but she trains well on dirt.\nLong Shot – 2 Almost Guilty\nRace 2 – 6 ½ furlongs (turf, rail at 8 feet), Purse $52,000, Maiden special weights, Fillies and mares, 3-year-olds and up\n10 Illuminant – Love the parking lot post for the morning line chalk; does not hurt that the main man, Rafael Bejarano, takes the call, just missed by an inch in last.\n2 Redheads Rule – Draws the dreaded rail going down the hillside turf course; has no early speed, but figures to sit a trip and go around them all turning for home.\nLong Shot – 6 Wheatfield\nRace 3 – 1 1/16th miles, Purse $17,000, Maiden claiming $20,000, 3-year-olds and up\n6 Financial – Sliding down the maiden claiming ladder to this bottom rung; even though he doesn not have the fastest speed figure, this class drop is very significant.\n5 Three Red Sevens – Tepid morning line favorite has had a lot chances, 15 so far; the thing that makes him live most of the time is 11 finishes in the money.\nLong Shot – 3 All Star Parade\nRace 4 – 6 ½ furlongs, Purse $53,000, Allowance, Fillies and mares, 3-year-olds and up\n2 Pleasant as Pie – That was one impressive debut victory for trainer Ron Ellis; Ellis isn’t known for popping first time out and this baby outran her 33/1 price.\n1 Radiant Journey – Has run four good races in a row albeit with cheaper company, Cal-breds; this is a natural step up and despite two wins is eligible for this.\nLong Shot – 7 Daddy’s Duo\nRace 5 – 1 mile (turf, rail at 8 feet), $100,000 Zuma Beach, 2-year-olds\n7 I’malreadythere – Ran a big race chasing Hollywood Don in the Del Mar Juvenile Turf; with jockey Flavien Prat sidelined, HOF jockey Mike Smith gets the call.\n9 Dressed in Hermes – Chased Hollywood Don in a MSW before that one unloaded in the Del Mar Juvenile Turf; I don’t mind backing 2-year-old maidens in stakes.\nLong Shot – 2 Getoffmyback\nRace 6 – 6 ½ furlongs, Purse $28,000, Optional claiming $32,000, 2-year-olds\n2 Family Code – Has shown steady progress in all three career starts; if he improves another step tonight, he’ll be awful tough to handle.\n6 Carlos Dangerous – That was one ugly effort in the I’m Smokin stakes; the fact that Rafael Bejarano stays loyal to the cause is a good thing, draw a line thru that race.\nLong Shot – 4 Dr. Crabby\nRace 7 – 1 mile (turf, rail at 8 feet), $100,000 Surfer Girl, Fillies, 2-year-olds\n7 Lucky Folie – Here is another filly that injured jockey Flavien Prat is missing the ride on; HOF jockey Gary Stevens will sub for the French rider on this nice filly.\n5 Jakaby Jade – That was a sparkling U.S. and SoCal debut winning the Del Mar Juvenile Fillies Turf; she joined trainer Doug O’Neill’s barn from Great Britain.\nLong Shot – 2 Stays in Vegas\nRace 8 – 6 furlongs, Purse $52,000, Maiden special weights, 2-year-olds\n11 Miner’s Light – There are 8 FTS in the field so you will have a huge edge over me in seeing the tote action; this one did everything but win in a very sharp debut.\n6 Dr. Dorr – FTS from HOF trainer Bob Baffert barn; don’t see the usual bullet workouts, but like the fact that stable rider Martin Garcia gets the first shot.\nLong Shot – 12 Diplodocus\nRace 9 – 1 1/16th miles, Purse $53,000, Optional claiming $20,000, Cal-breds, 3-year-olds and up\n5 Brimstoned – This guy has turned in two special victories in a row for trainer Tom Bell; it’s good too for jockey Brice Blanc who doesn’t get nearly enough live mounts.\n10 Avanti Bello – Solid effort when third in the E. B. Johnston last time out; has good tactical speed to either lead or sit close up to the early pace.\nLong Shot – 1 Storm Comin Thru\nRace 10 – 6 ½ furlongs (turf, rail at 8 feet), Purse $32,000, Claiming $32,000, 3-year-olds and up\n10 Turnover – HOF trainer Bob Baffert has a busy day today with some of his lesser lights; this 4-year-olds shows potential and he’s not going anywhere, he’s a gelding.\n11 Ain’t No Other – Down the hillside turf course, it’s better to be in the parking lot posts than down on the rail; this one was claimed two races ago by Paulo Lobo.\nLong Shot – 6 Giant Ego\nBest Bet - 5 Brimstoned (race 9)\nSanta Anita Friday - Picks/Winners/Mutuels, 16/3/$23.40; Long Shots, 8/2/$23.20; Best Bet, 1/0/$0\nSanta Anita Totals - 135/30/$184.60; Long Shots, 68/15/$206.80; Best Bets, 6/2/$5.60\nSIMULCAST PLAY OF THE DAY - #2 Ambidextrous Alex (7/2) in race 1 at Keeneland. For scoring purposes, we'll make a hypothetical $2 win, place and show bet, $6 total. On Friday, Ageless won at Keeneland paying $7.60 to win, $3.00 to place and $2.20 to show.
