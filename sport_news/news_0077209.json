San Antonio College in its season opener. \nSaddleback took a 6-0 lead on a Jojo Binda 7-yard run in the first quarter and extended the lead on quarterback Jacob Gibsonâ€™s 52-yard TD strike to Remy Wasserbach just before the half. \nKenny Torrence ran the ball 18 times for 53 yards to lead COC, but he lost one of two Cougars fumbles. Dunn lost the other at the Saddleback 29. \nIt was, however, a non-conference game. And the Cougars currently sit in a tie atop the National Division, Northern Conference 2-0.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T10:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T10:16:31.217+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
