Thirty seconds later, Correa intercepted a pass near midfield to secure an emotional 20-14 win that kept New Milford in the hunt for a North 1, Group 1 playoff berth. \nNew Milford (4-3) is one of 13 teams with at least a mathematical chance of securing a spot in its eight-team bracket. \n“It was win or go home,” Correa said. “This means a lot to us because it gives us a chance to make the playoffs. And if we make it to the playoffs, anything can happen.” \nPompton Lakes, meanwhile, will have a much tougher time qualifying for a North 1, Group 2 berth after this difficult defeat. The Cardinals – who won three straight North 1, Group 1 championships from 2011-13 – are one of 12 teams fighting for eight spots in their section. \nThe Cardinals (3-3) played accordingly in the fourth quarter Saturday. \nA 2-yard touchdown run by Pompton Lakes sophomore quarterback Kyle Shafer helped tie New Milford at 14 with exactly six minutes left in the game. Shafer’s score capped a four-play, 64-yard drive that took just 1:15 off the clock. \nNew Milford responded with a 10-play, 76-yard drive that resulted in Correa’s game-winning touchdown. \nCorrea rushed six times for 50 yards and caught an 8-yard pass during that drive. He ran for 127 yards and two touchdowns on 24 carries overall, in addition to making seven tackles, recording a sack and producing the victory-clinching interception. \n“In the fourth quarter,” New Milford coach Bill Wilde said, “we just said, ‘We’ll keep hammering it in there [with Correa] and he’s going to pop it [for a touchdown].’ He’s a horse. He’s a winner. He’s a tough kid.” \nFreshman defensive end Alex Molina led New Milford with 11 tackles. In just his second varsity start, sophomore quarterback Ryan Picinic completed 10 of 16 passes for 116 yards, a touchdown and an interception. \nSaturday’s win was New Milford’s second straight following a three-game losing streak that made the Knights reaching the postseason an unlikely proposition at the time. \n“If we didn’t win this one, we couldn’t stay in the playoffs,” Wilde said. “So we did our job [Saturday]. Hopefully next week we’ll win again and then we’ll see where it falls. I don’t know if we’re going to have enough [power] points, but we’re doing our best. We need a little help, but you never know.” \nNew Milford plays its final game before the NJSIAA’s cutoff for playoff qualification Saturday at Lodi. Pompton Lakes plays two more games before its cutoff – at Lyndhurst on Friday night and at home against Lodi on Nov. 7. \n“I can’t even contemplate what’s going to happen the next couple of weeks,” Pompton Lakes coach Scott Mahoney said regarding the Cardinals’ chances of reaching the playoffs. “The bottom line is we just have to try to win next week and go from there.” \nEmail: idec@northjersey.com © 2015 North Jersey Media Group Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T07:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T18:21:34.818+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
