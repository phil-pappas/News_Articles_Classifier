The most upsetting part of the play on which Beason sustained the injury was not revealed to him until the veteran middle linebacker watched video the following day.\nThat's when the Giants' defensive captain noticed 49ers left guard Alex Boone shoved Beason in the back, sending him stumbling head-down toward 49ers running back Carlos Hyde, who was running full speed with the football on a carry to the left side of the field.\nHyde delivered a blow to Beason's head – he was fined $23,152 by the NFL on Friday for initiating contact with the crown of his helmet – and Beason immediately dropped to a knee, wobbly and out of sorts. He went to the sideline and missed the rest of the game.\nNot only was a penalty not called when it should have been, Boone was not fined because illegal blocks are not fineable unless the infraction escalates to one of the categories specified in the CBA, per a league source. He did not, however, escape the wrath of Beason, who made a point to call out Boone for what he considered a dirty play while speaking at his locker Friday.\n\"It's unfortunate when another player – Alex Boone, to be exact – can reach out, grab you from behind and deliberately push you in the back,\" Beason said. \"It's hard enough to stay healthy in this league. I think it was a coward move, and it didn't show any sportsmanship or no regard for another player's career. It could have been a lot worse. I never saw Hyde, because I was too busy trying to keep my balance from being pushed from behind.\n\"I wanted to get that out there, and I hope it goes back to him, because that's how I feel.\"\n\"I don't think he was intending to hurt me,\" Beason added. \"But when you do something illegal, that's why it's called a clip for a reason. There's no reason to push anybody in the back in football. Like I said, I think it's a cowardly move and it is what it is.\"\nBeason's remarks did make their way to the 49ers training facility in Santa Clara, Calif.\nAfter practice Boone told reporters, according to the Bay Area News Group: \"I'm sorry he feels that way. I've never thought of myself as a dirty player or intentionally tried to hurt anybody.\"\nBeason returned to practice as a limited participant Friday after clearing the league's concussion protocol. He said he doesn't see anything that would hold him back from playing Monday night in Philadelphia against the Eagles in what looms as a battle for first place in the NFC East.\n\"Well, we've got a lead right now, it's a long race, but you don't want to give that lead back,\" Beason said. \"So we've worked hard to kind of climb out of being irrelevant to somewhat relevant. We don't want to look back, so this game means everything to us, as it does for Philadelphia as well.\"\nBECKHAM STILL UNCERTAIN: WR Odell Beckham Jr. did not practice again Friday, but did not appear limited by his hamstring issue while working with trainers on the side. Asked about Beckham's status, coach Tom Coughlin said, \"Good. He's coming along,\" adding he was hopeful Beckham could practice Sunday. But if not, that would not preclude him from playing against the Eagles, Coughlin said.\nLB Jonathan Casillas (calf), WR Rueben Randle (hamstring) DE Robert Ayers (hamstring) and DE George Selvie (calf) all were able to practice.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T04:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T08:33:42.281+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
