Jerry Page, who rushed for 174 yards on 20 carries, went in for the Lancer touchdown. \nBut Liberty was not going away. Tyron Staples fielded the kick-off, picking it up off the bounce, and returned it 90 yards, trucking down the middle of the field for the touchdown. He also had more than 100 yards rushing in the game for the Minutemen. But even that effort was not enough, as Amherst poured it on after that. Trae Shuford got through traffic and sprinted in for the touchdown, adding to the Lancers' lead. \nThen Jason Whitley got in on the scoring. Six different Amherst players had a touchdown in the game, as the Lancers roll to the 70-38 win over Liberty. \nCopyright Â© 2015, WDBJ7", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T05:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T06:48:05.189+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
