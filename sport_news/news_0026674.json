However, much of the conversation was dominated by talk about Floyd Mayweather . No stranger to taking shots at Floyd , De La Hoya threw a couple verbal jabs at the 38-year-old boxer, criticizing his fight against Manny Pacquiao and wondering why he took the bout against Andre Berto .\nWhen the topic switched over to the likes of GGG, Miguel Cotto and others, Oscar was asked, at around the 9-minute mark, if the sport would be better off in the post-Floyd era.
