E-N Game of the Week: Boerne Champion at Kerrville Tivy 1 / 6 Back to Gallery Boerne Champion at Kerrville Tivy\nKickoff: 7:30 p.m. Friday, Antler Stadium, Kerrville\nRadio: Web only (TSRNsports.com)\nE-N Area rankings/records: No 2. Boerne Champion (3-2 overall, 3-0 District 27-5A); No. 1 Kerrville Tivy (4-0 overall, 2-0 district)\nCoaches: Keith Kaiser (21-6 at Boerne Champion, three seasons; 30-28 overall, six seasons); David Jones (29-13 at Kerrville Tivy, four seasons; 67-29 overall, 10 seasons)\nSeries: Tivy leads 5-2.\nLast meeting: Champion won 42-33 in 2014.\nChampion breakdown\nSetting the scene: The Chargers have won the last two meetings and used the momentum from last year’s victory to take District 27-5A’s top seed in the Class 5A Division II playoffs. Champion was knocked out by Cedar Park in the second round, while Tivy lost to Cedar Park in the fourth round. This year, the Chargers have won three straight after dropping their first two games.\nKey to victory: Champion will need to slow down an explosive Tivy offense led by senior quarterback Cade Dyal , who has posted impressive numbers despite playing only one full game. The Antlers have playmakers across the field and Champion’s defense will be tasked with slowing down a team averaging 52 points per game.\nStatistical leaders: Passing — Josh Green 87-147-6, 1,197 yards, 10 TDs; rushing — Green 57-584, 7 TDs; receiving — Hayden McMurrey 31-477, 5 TDs; tackles — Trey Moskal, 35; sacks — three tied, 3; interceptions — four tied, 1.\nTivy breakdown\nSetting the scene: With the exception of a 39-23 victory at Corpus Christi Calallen, the No. 7 team in the Associated Press Class 5A state poll has cruised. The Antlers have benefitted from the maturation of a 2014 team that was fairly inexperienced before it reached the fourth round. Tivy and Champion are two of the four undefeated teams in 27-5A play.\nKey to victory: Tivy coach David Jones said his defense will need to contain Champion quarterback Josh Green, who didn’t play in last season’s game because of a season-ending knee injury. Jones also said stopping Champion’s defensive front from controlling the line of scrimmage will be a key aspect in a game that will have a significant impact on November’s playoff picture.\nStatistical leaders: Passing — Cade Dyal 58-83-1, 970 yards, 14 TDs; rushing — Hayden Schreckenbach 26-313, 5 TDs; receiving — Hutch White 16-289, 3 TDs; tackles — Jessy Denais , 35; sacks — Denais, 1.5; interceptions — three tied, 1.\nE-N prediction\nTivy 49, Champion 45: With each team’s offense led by a quality quarterback, this has the potential to be a high-scoring game. The Antlers will snap a two-game slide against the Chargers and remain unbeaten this season.", "external_links": ["http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/20/45/8718713/7/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/01/61/8658023/61/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/20/45/8718713/7/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/01/61/8658019/61/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/01/61/8658024/61/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/33/46/43/7235794/9/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/01/61/8658023/61/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/01/61/8658024/61/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/33/37/26/7206323/9/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/33/46/43/7235794/9/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/01/61/8658019/61/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/33/37/26/7206323/9/920x920.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-01T00:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T01:26:54.523+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
