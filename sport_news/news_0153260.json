Vail Mountain School tennis wrapped a successful season with a third-place finish at the Region 8 tournament. And this, unfortunately, is the theme — only two teams qualify for state, so this was a bit of heartbreaker. What’s more, at the regional tournament, six of the seven VMS entrants finished third with the top-two qualifying for the big dance. Nonetheless, it was a fine season for the Gore Rangers. “I was really happy with the year,” VMS coach Tom Ewert said. “As the season progressed, everyone played better and better. I wish we could have started the season as we finished it.” VMS finished the regular season with a 6-3 record, with its only losses to Steamboat Springs, Dawson and Aspen. The last was a heartbreaker, a 4-3 decision. All three of those teams have very large contingents at the upcoming 4A state tourney, so there’s no shame in those matches. For those not familiar with high school tennis, a team has three players competing in singles, known as No. 1, No. 2 and No. 3 singles, somewhat akin to flights in golf. Teams also have four sets of doubles, Nos. 1-4. The following are the regional results for the Gore Rangers • No. 1 singles: Jake Singleton, fourth. • No. 2 singles: Kevin Kalkus, third. • No. 3 singles: Ty Michonski, third. • No. 1 doubles: Marc Philippon and David Stearns, third. • No. 2 doubles: Brenden Keane, Trace Landreath, third. • No. 3 doubles: Ryan Dawsey and Jacob Turtletaub, third. • No. 4 doubles: Kelby Denisson and Taylor Peterson, third.
