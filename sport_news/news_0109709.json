Butler/NBAE/Getty Images The Knicks hope Jerian Grant's peformance against Bauru is the beginning of things to come. The Knicks other rookie acquitted himself well in his first preseason action Wednesday, but a much bigger test awaits Jerian Grant Friday night in Washington.\nGrant, the 19th overall pick out of Notre Dame, was a composed floor general during his 28 minutes in Wednesday’s victory over the Brazilian team Bauru at the Garden, collecting four assists and eight points while facilitating the game-breaking runs next to Langston Galloway. (There was a very impressive behind-the-back-dribble-to-an-assist play from Grant late in the first quarter).\nCoach Derek Fisher was certainly pleased.\n\"Jerian has a good feel for the game,\" the coach said. \"It's a hard thing to do for young guys to have a pace and kind of composure to his game which I think allows for more efficiency. A lot of times young guys just play really fast and are trying really hard. And I think Jerian's ability to kind of - whether it's natural or learned, he's a pretty cool guy, pretty relaxed and calm.\"\nIn Grant, 22, the Knicks acquired the rare four-year college player in the draft, which should make an easier transition in the NBA. It also helps that both his father - Harvey - and uncle - Horace - were still both in the league about 15 years ago.\n\"He just transferred what he's doing in practice onto the court. He's a guy who don't show any type of emotion out there, he just goes, just play the game. He's got a great feel for the game,\" Carmelo Anthony said. \"It was just a matter of him showing it to everybody today. We already knew that about him.\"\nAgainst the Wizards on Friday, Grant, who came off the bench against the Brazilian team behind Jose Calderon and Sasha Vujacic, will face one of the better backcourts in the NBA in John Wall and Bradley Beal.\n\"For him it will just about him learning how difficult it is to play the guard position in this league against the type of guys you're going to see,\" Fisher said.\n HERE.\n***\nCarmelo Anthony prefers small forward and, if everything goes according to plan, he'll get a chance to play their often this season.\nThe Knicks stocked up on power forwards during the summer who were all on display Wednesday - Kyle O'Quinn (14 points, 8 rebounds), Kevin Seraphin (14, 5), Derrick Williams (6, 4), Kristaps Porzingis (7, 2).\n\"I think that spot is wide open, just as far as who's going to play it, when they're going to play,\" Anthony said. \"I'm pretty sure you'll see some times with me at the four throughout the course of the season. To be honest with you, throughout these first 10 days of camp, Seraphin showed some shine at that position, K.P. showed some upside at that position. Guys we brought in at that position are showing why we brought them.\"\nAnthony, playing in his first game since undergoing knee surgery, started at small forward, played 20 minutes and scored a team-high 17 points on 8-of-10 shooting.\nRelated Stories Knicks sign rookies Kristaps Porzingis and Jerian Grant Knicks rookies Porzingis, Grant top summer league roster Knicks trade Tim Hardaway Jr. to Hawks for PG Jerian Grant Tags: jerian grant", "external_links": ["http://www.facebook.com/nydnsports"], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T04:00:39.006+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
