No more than seven can get through championship Saturday that way.Of those 14 unbeatens, all but one is guaranteed to avoid playing another unbeaten team between now and the College Playoff Football selections on Dec. 6.That would be No. 3 Utah, the last remaining unbeaten team in the Pac-12. Despite not having to face another team with a perfect record, the Utes road to an undefeated season and a spot in the playoff is anything but smooth.A major hurdle to clear comes Saturday when Utah goes to Southern California. The Trojans have lost three games and had their coach fired, but as they showed last week at Notre Dame there is no shortage of talent at USC.In fact, odds-makers favor USC, so don’t call it an upset if the Utes fall to Troy.Speaking of upsets, only one game matches ranked teams this weekend — No. 15 Texas A&M at No. 24 Ole Miss.
