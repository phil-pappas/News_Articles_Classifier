He was the tying run (it was 3-2 Astros at the time) and was just 90 feet away. At least that's how it looked. The Astros ended up challenging the call and it was ruled that as Gore was popping up, he lost contact with the bag and was tagged out.\nHere's the video and a screen-shot:\nYour browser does not support iframes. \nThis was at least more clear than the Odor play in game 2. pic.twitter.com/zU0fJJOkrX \n— Jason Collette (@jasoncollette) October 12, 2015 Note that Luis Valbuena only appears to be tagging Gore with his wrist.
