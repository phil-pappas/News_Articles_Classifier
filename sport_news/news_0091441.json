The crowd buzzed with excitement as people slowly made their way out into the mild October night, a large percentage stopping to take selfies in front of Wrigley Field's iconic red marquee that flashed \"CUBS WIN.\" related advertisement Chants praising the Cubs and deriding the Cardinals rang out in equal measure, along with off-key, jubilant renditions of \"Go, Cubs, Go.\" Among the newest, and probably most comfortable, Cubs fans on the scene was 6-month-old Addison Schuman, who quietly observed the festivities from the safety of a baby carrier strapped to her father's chest. \"When she was born we knew now's the year,\" Dan Schuman said, standing on the street that he and his wife, Julie, named their daughter after. The parents, who grew up in Schaumburg but now live in Lakeview, took Addison to Monday's game and knew they had to come back Tuesday night to be part of the post-win revelry. Among the sea of blue was the odd Cardinals fan clad in red. \"Bye bye, birdies,\" Jerry Pritikin, the self-appointed \"Bleacher Preacher,\" said to the somber St. Louis fans as they walked by. Pritikin, who has held his title since 1984, got a reaction out of only a few Cardinals fans, one of them saying, \"It's about time you guys won something.\" Rob and Rae Duncan, from Lincoln Park, were among the first non-Cardinals fans to leave Wrigley and join the crowd outside after the win. \"Even when we were down 2-0 everybody was still positive about the game,\" Rob Duncan said. \"Everyone was so just pumped for the Cubbies to win,\" Rae Duncan said. Jon Kingston hopped on his bike and pedaled over from his home in Ravenswood during the eighth inning to be part of the celebration Tuesday night. \"The whole way down I could hear the people in the bars going crazy, so I knew something good was happening,\" Kingston said. \"It's as fun being outside here as it is being inside. And much less expensive.\" Rich and Jane Lafnitzeggar from Long Grove said the game was the most amazing one that they had ever been to. \"Rizzo's homer was the biggest moment of the game,\" Jane Lafnitzeggar said. \"After that there was no doubt about it, you could just feel it.\" Mikal Sutherlin couldn't get tickets to the game, so she brought her three daughters -- Maya, 10, Yasmyn, 8, Naysa, 6 -- to the stadium to enjoy the sights and get a picture with the iconic red marquee. \"We knew we had to make it here,\" Sutherlin said. \"This was the next best thing to being inside.\" Sutherlin, who now lives in Chicago, said the victory was all the sweeter because she used to be a Cubs fan living in St. Louis. \"I've been waiting for this forever,\" she said. Dan, Julie and little Addison will be back to cheer on the Cubs the next round of the playoffs. \"I think I want the Mets next,\" Dan Schuman said. \"After that I'm fine as long as it's not the Blue Jays, maybe one of the Texas teams.\" Whomever they play, should the Cubs win the celebration will only get larger.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T05:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T06:57:36.998+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
