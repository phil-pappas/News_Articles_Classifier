She stood next to an exhibit, a photograph of a swanky $6,000-a-month home in Nevada rented by her client's longtime friend and co-defendant Lloyd Benton Sharp.\nSharp was the con man, Hay said, not Holden. Her 75-year-old client made mistakes and mismanaged his business affairs as he tried to turn countless acres of jatropha-tree seeds into biodiesel in Africa and South America, she said. But he really believed in what he told investors.\n\"That's not fraud,\" she said.\nBut over the course of a trial that began Sept. 28 before U.S. District Judge Anna J. Brown , prosecutors hauled out a relentless stream of business records before the jury – evidence, they said, that Holden skillfully strung along his marks to separate them from their money.\nTime after time, government lawyers said, Holden rallied investors by foretelling imminent growth, fantastic returns and, at one particularly low point, a \"glimmer of hope\" as he pretended to help them catch the biodiesel wave with him.\n\"He did not tell one investor the truth,\" said Assistant U.S. Attorney Claire M. Fay , a veteran financial crimes prosecutor. \"He took the money and used it like it was a personal piggybank,\" spending it on himself and -- here she Quote: d a trial witness -- \"like a drunken sailor.\"\nHolden is accused of joining in the plot with Sharp, who posed as money-man Kevin Thomas, in fall 2007. For a couple of years, government prosecutors say, the duo lured investors into funding operations in Ghana and Chile that they said would turn the seeds of jatropha trees into liquid gold: low-cost biodiesel.\nFor his part, Holden told investors he had arranged with local tribes to grow five million acres of jatropha trees in Ghana, and that his company – Gold Star Farms – would use their investments to buy a prefabricated refinery from China that would be shipped to Ghana to produce biodiesel.\nLater Holden turned up in Chile with a new plan for their literal seed money.\nAll of the plans failed, and government prosecutors told jurors that was by design: Holden and his co-conspirator Sharp, never intended to produce biodiesel.\nIn fact, they said, Holden and Sharp were especially cunning in that they turned just enough of their money into letterhead and offices and factory buildings to give the appearance they were hard at work.\nHay said that the buildings and materials and employees were not merely \"trappings,\" but evidence that Holden was really trying to build a biodiesel business at a time when the bottom dropped out of the market.\nClosing arguments in the perplexing conspiracy case took nearly five hours before Brown sent the jury out at 3:49 p.m. The panel's deliberations are set to renew Thursday morning.\n-- Bryan Denson\nbdenson@oregonian.com\n503-294-7614; @Bryan_Denson", "external_links": ["http://goldstarfarms.com/executive_team.html", "https://twitter.com/Bryan_Denson"], "published": "2015-10-15T01:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T10:27:19.689+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
