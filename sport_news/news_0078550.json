He completed just seven passes in the first half, but they went for 196 yards, including a 37-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Chris Godwin late in the second quarter. Kicker Joey Julius hit a 40-yard field goal with 31 seconds remaining in the first half. \nIn the third quarter, what was expected to remain a defensive battle turned into a back-and-forth offensive showcase. There were three lead changes, and Maryland took a 27-24 lead into the fourth quarter. \nAfter their defense forced a punt on Penn State's opening possession of the half, the Terps marched 68 yards on nine plays to take a 20-17 lead. Hills converted a third-and-4 with a 36-yard run up the middle, and on another third down, running back Brandon Ross took a handoff and bounced around the right side for a 10-yard score. \nBut Hackenberg came up big again for Penn State. He hit Godwin for a 31-yard gain while under duress to get the Nittany Lions deep into Maryland territory. Then Hackenberg hit DaeSean Hamilton on a back-shoulder throw for a 20-yard touchdown and 24-20 lead. \nHills wouldn't let the Terps go down easily. He marched them 88 yards downfield on 10 plays, capped by a 10-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver DeAndre Lane (Catonsville). Lane's first career touchdown put Maryland up 27-24. \nPenn State came right back with another touchdown pass by Hackenberg, this time a 27-yard completion to wide receiver Eugene Lewis. The Nittany Lions were helped by an unsportsmanlike-conduct penalty on safety A.J. Hendy along with a long completion from Hackenberg to Godwin on third-and-15. \nTrailing 31-27, Maryland came away with three points on the next drive, but it could have had more. Hills hit wide receiver Taivon Jacobs for a 43-yard gain, and the Terps were aided by a roughing-the-kicker penalty on a field-goal attempt by Craddock. The end result was a shorter field goal, from 29 yards, that cut the lead to 31-30. \nThe teams traded fumbles on the next two plays. Penn State kick returner Nick Scott was stripped of the ball, and the Terps took over at the Nittany Lions 32. But Hills was hit on the next play, and defensive end Garrett Sickels picked up the ball and rumbled 36 yards to the Maryland 28. The Terps forced three incomplete passes, and Julius missed a 45-yard field goal. \nOn the ensuing drive, Maryland went for it on fourth-and-2 from its own 36-yard line, but Penn State cornerback Trevor Williams intercepted a pass up the right sideline. \nWith an opportunity to extend its lead, Penn State made another mistake when Hackenberg dropped a snap on third down and defensive back Denzel Conyers pounced on the fumble. \nOn fourth-and-10 from the Penn State 45, Hills hit Levern Jacobs for a 7-yard gain. But the Terps were able to force a punt, setting them up for a last-gasp attempt.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T01:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T02:29:30.154+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
