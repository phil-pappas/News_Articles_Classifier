Special photo by Matt Boggs slideshow MARIETTA — Mount Paran Christian’s Taylor Trammell rushed 14 times for 241 yards and four touchdowns, leading the Eagles to a 41-20 victory in their Region 6A (A) opener on Friday at Walker.“He’s a difference-maker, and coach (Tab) Griffin is smart enough to get him the ball,” Mount Paran coach Mitch Jordan said of Trammell. “He had another outstanding night, and when you’ve got a guy that talented, you want to get him as many touches as possible. You can’t say enough about that young man.”The win gave Mount Paran (6-0, 1-0) a 20-game winning streak dating back to the start of the 2014 season, just one shy of Marietta’s county-record 21-game winning streak from the 1965 and ’66 seasons. It’s also the third-longest active streak in the state, trailing only the 22-game runs of defending state champions Colquitt County and Calhoun.Mount Paran will have the chance to tie Marietta’s record next week when it hosts Christian Heritage, a team it beat 45-9 last year.Walker (3-4, 0-2) put together a 72-yard scoring drive, cutting the Eagles’ lead to 14-7 with 3:40 to go in opening quarter. But Joseph Vose’s 1-yard touchdown burst and the first of two made points-after by Austin Gass was as close as Walker could get.“Walker gave us some different formations, so, defensively, we were off-balance a little bit,” Jordan said. “They kept it close and had a good game plan, but I’m proud of our guys and coaches for adjusting. Overall, I’m pleased.”From there, Mount Paran tallied 27 consecutive points to take control of the game.Matthew Norton’s 3-yard touchdown plunge made the score 21-7 with 1:21 left in the first period before Trammell had touchdown runs of 73 and 10 yards late in the second quarter, upping Mount Paran’s advantage to 35-7 at halftime.The Eagles scored on their first possession of the second half when Trammell found the end zone from 12 yards away, putting Mount Paran in front, 41-7.Walker concluded the scoring with a touchdown in each of the third and fourth periods. Thomas Rath’s 13-yard scamper, followed by a 20-yard pass play from Vose to J.T. Reichenbach, made it 41-20 contest with 8:39 remaining.On the game’s first play from scrimmage, Trammell raced 67 yards for a touchdown, Jackson McClarity added his first of five successful extra points and the Eagles led 7-0 just 14 seconds in.When Mount Paran got the ball back, Jack Lee ran 50 yards into the end zone, making the score 14-0 at the 9:11 mark of the first quarter.The Eagles finished with 496 rushing yards, compared to 126 for Walker. Norton had 72 yards on the ground, while Holt Shannon had 64 and Lee 63 for Mount Paran. Rath collected 56 on six carries for Walker.
