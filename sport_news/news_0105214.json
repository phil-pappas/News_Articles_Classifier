But there's a New London native who grew up in the Groton side of Mystic who has made many Mets fans. Matt Harvey has friends and family in Mystic. \"I played baseball with Matt Harvey on the New London legion team in 2006 and 7,\" said Drew Raleigh. \"Of course I'm gonna root for the Mets.\" \"On my 21st birthday, Matt Harvey bought all my drinks for me. We spent a whole night at the casinos, it was a blast,\" said Cristy Haddon, a friend of Harvey's. Harvey gear hangs on the wall inside Taylor's Sports in the Olde Mistick Village boutiques. \"So many calls about Matt Harvey gear!\" said Sarah Tetreault. \"We have everything in Mets from jerseys to t-shirts so we've been getting a lot of phone calls with their win last night.\" There are jackets and sweatshirts there, Mets' caps of course, even New York Mets' neckties, and flags for Mets' fans too. The car decals are selling out, though there are a couple left. \"Finally it's popular to be Mets fans! You can actually advertise it!\" Tetreault said.
