She knew the truism that you write what you know. So, she asked the master of horror, “What do you know?” By David HayesA skeletal scarecrow awaits patrons to the ‘Children of the Corn’ section of the Stephen King-themed Nightmare at Beaver Lake. \nKing smiled, and replied, “Whenever I get asked that question, I just say I have the heart of a little boy.” He then paused for dramatic affect. “And I keep it in a jar on my desk.” \nThe folks behind the annual Nightmare at Beaver Lake thought what better theme for this year’s outdoor haunt than the twisted mind of the bestselling author. \nTwo 501(c)(3) nonprofit organizations combine their talents to present the Nightmare at Beaver Lake — The Rotary Club of Sammamish, which takes care of the business side of operations, and Kent company Scare Productions, which provides the creative side of things that go bump in the night. \n“On a given night, say Friday, we have a full complement of 120 actors and another 100 support staff,” said Cary Young, Rotary Club chairwoman for Nightmare at Beaver Lake. “That includes ticket booth, security, wardrobe, costumes, makeup, kitchen staff, line control, shuttle drivers, on and on. We’re the operations that keep the show running.” \nHer counterpart from Scare Productions is artistic director Dana Young (no relation). \nShe said the ¾-mile walk through Beaver Lake has grown in its 12 years, drawing nearly 4,000 paying victims, er, customers its first year, to 13,000 last Halloween season. \nDana said they develop a new theme each year to keep things fresh and keep people coming back. \n“That makes it much more fun for the patrons,” Dana said. “They’re excited, wondering, oh what are they doing this year?” If you go \nOct. 16-18, 22-25 and 29-31 7-10 p.m. Thursdays and Sundays and 7-11 p.m. Fridays and Saturdays Tickets: Family Scare $12, from 7-7:45 p.m.; Full Scare $18, from 8 p.m. to close www.nightmareatbeaverlake.com \nFor example, last year’s theme was classic horror from black-and-white movies, the year before was an all jungle theme. Ideas are usually pulled from pop culture. Plus, they have a lot of room to play. \n“We go to other haunts to compare,” Dana said. “So we can say we’re close to, if not the biggest in state. We’re a big haunt. You’ll get a good workout walking through.” \nGreeting patrons at the beginning are big billboards Dana hand-created to pay homage to the books of King, from “Children of the Corn” to “Pet Sematary.” And each will feature scares inspired by the tale. \n“They’ll see the storyboard that sets up the next set, such as ‘The Shining,’ and there will be a hedge maze or there on the hill will be the Overlook Hotel façade,” she explained. \nIn addition to the King theme will be the “one-off scares,” as Dana likes to call them. In all, the park features 33 sets with 10 buildings to wander through and the final pavilion, which has its own 10 sets to weave through. \nCary said one of the key attractions to Nightmare at Beaver Lake is its outdoor setting. \n“It’s dark and it’s in the woods. Right there, it’s already scary,” she said. \nBut to attract both the bold and the faint at heart, Nightmare at Beaver Lake offers two levels of scares — the family scare and the full scare. \n“With family scare, the lights are up brighter, there’s less blood and gore, the more intense actors are not out and there’s three sets that are not open because they’re more intense,” Dana said. “It’s for anyone, because we get adults, too, during family scare. We play a little further away from you and tone it down. Then, at 8 p.m., we amp it up.” \nAfter family scare, there’s a 15-minute transition time, the three extra sets open up, the intense actors are let loose and there’s more blood and gore everywhere. However, even after 8 p.m., the option remains to skip the full experience. \n“I have seen the boyfriend-girlfriend combo stand there for 10 minutes and argue whether to go into the full scare,” Cary said. \nDana said they have a flexibility advantage within the park over a static, haunted house. \n“We have a lot of interesting space that can create sets that make sense in the outdoors,” she said. “You don’t have to make the trees for a wooded setting.” \nThe additional challenge, Dana added, is varying the experience, as a haunted park is not just about scaring, but also about entertaining. There are also sets that are eerie and beautiful, while others are funny. \n“It’s all about the phycology of scaring,” Dana said. “You can’t just go full on, all the time at a high level. You have to let them come down. Then you can scare them again. Then we lull them into feeling safe, then we hit them again.” \nThat’s why Scare Productions varies the theme every year and sprinkles in unexpected terrors, because you never know what is going to scare someone. For some people, it’s spiders. For others, it’s the clowns. Oh, the clowns. \n“We get some people who think, ‘Oh, this is great fun.’ Then they get to the clown set and they’re like, ‘I’m done.’” Dana said. “We’ve literally had people say they need to be escorted out. They won’t even go around the clown set.” \nOne constant throughout the years is Scare Productions’ mascot Goliath, an animatronic gargoyle that’s 12 feet tall with a 14-foot wingspan. Other sets feature twisted takes on Dr. Seuss, The Borg and the Addams Family. \nRotarian Kristina Williams has been volunteering for years, alongside her husband Larry, who jumps in, too. She said this year’s Nightmare should be fun. \n“There’s a lot of different elements, and the Stephen King theme has been really exciting for people,” she said. “We have people come back every single year because they know it’s going to be completely different.” \nDana said the park would remain open in daylight hours during its run through Oct 31. \n“But when it gets dark,” she added, “the park is ours.” \nCue maniacal laughter. \nWritten by David Hayes · Filed Under Local News \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T00:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T02:49:23.232+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
