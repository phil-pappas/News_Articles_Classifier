The Spartans (1-9 VOL, 4-11 overall) called timeout before Padua’s serve but that did not shake Padua who rattled off four in a row before a sizzling ace ended the night.“I feel that when the other team calls time out it is meant to distract us,” Padua said. “So that motivated me to serve a good serve and not a bad one like I did my last serve.“On my final serve I kept telling myself that I had to get it, so I just got it out there.”Walljasper (10 kills, four blocks) and Vanessa Benham formed a dominating front line for the Timberwolves (1-9, 4-15).“I think we played well as a team,” Walljasper said. “I tried contributing my part and helping out the best I could.”Benham had six kills, five blocks and four aces.“I think our team really pulled through today,” Benham said. “We played really well together and we were determined to win so we pushed hard.”Genni Hammarstrom had 14 digs for Sierra with Cecelia Salcedo adding 15 assists and 10 digs and Megan Westfall nine assists and two aces.This marked the first VOL win for the Timberwolves this season and avenged an earlier three-set loss to Lathrop.“The girls are excited,” Sierra coach Trinity Johnson said. “It was a definite confidence booster.”The Timberwolves were behind late in the last two games before coming back to win.“They showed their true colors tonight,” Johnson said. “They showed that they have the heart to come back from anything.”Avlenn Kaur and Raquel Haro had five kills apiece for Lathrop with Joy Bautista and Karissa Kammen each adding four kills. Malia Akers had two blocks as did Bautista.East Union 3, Kimball 0The Lancers (6-4, 14-7) improved their chances of making the postseason by avenging a previous loss to Kimball. They swept at Dalben Center 26-24, 25-18, 25-21.East Union appears to be rolling at the right time after a 4-0 finish in the Stockton Classic late last week.“I felt our success tonight is a direct carry over from the successful weekend we had,” East Union coach Rich Posz said. “The girls are playing hard and playing with a lot of energy.”Melissa King racked up 13 kills and 20 digs for the Lancers, while Haley England contributed 10 and 15. Jordyn Posz contributed 13 assists, and Alissa Burrola dished out 11 to go with five aces.Central Catholic 3, Weston Ranch 1Weston Ranch (5-5, 10-10) appeared prime for an upset win in Modesto but ended up losing in four — 29-27, 24-26, 25-19, 25-11.Amaya Finley led the way for the Cougars at the net with nine kills and four blocks. Setter Jennifer Viguerias finished with 19 assists. Iris Murphy collected 24 digs, and Elysia Garcia Hernandez served three aces.The Weston Ranch sophomore team (2-8, 4-11) lost, 23-25, 18-25.
