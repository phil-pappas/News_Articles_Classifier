His Liverpool side is relegated to the Europa League, but Rodgers is commenting on why the Premiership’s fortunes in the UEFA Champions League haven’t been so great lately. \nIt’s not just Arsenal who are currently in trouble in Champions League, the other English clubs have been losing too (although since Rodgers was asked about this topic both Manchester clubs have won a UCL match). \nThere’s been a lot of talk in the media lately that if the British clubs continue to lose out in Europe, there will be repercussions. Those repercussions being that England could only have three teams placed into the European Cup, instead of four, in upcoming years. \nBrendan Rodgers is offering an explanation as to why Prem teams have been losing in Europe. \n“I think the Premier League can do more to support the teams in Europe. It happens with other federations in other countries. They really help, but it doesn’t happen in this country,” Rodgers said. \n“The physicality of the Premier League is like no other. In other countries, some of the big teams in Europe can change five, six, seven players and still win.” \nBrendan Rodgers believes that British clubs have an increased workload when compared to the top teams in other nations. \n“They’ve got one domestic competition fewer. We’ve got two domestic cup competitions in this country when others have one,” the embattled LFC leader said. \n“It all adds up to being difficult physically for the Premier League teams and for the teams in European football, but it’s something we have to cope with.” \n“We respect that challenge, and it means you really have to monitor and get the best out of the players you have available.” \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T06:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T06:57:19.653+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
