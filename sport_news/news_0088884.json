Craig \"Iron Head\" Heyward played 11 seasons in the NFL as a running back for several teams. He died from cancer in 2006. \nCam Heyward says he was simply trying to pay tribute to his father and others affected by cancer. He writes that he had a \"respectful\" exchanged with the league and doesn't want to be a distraction to his team.
