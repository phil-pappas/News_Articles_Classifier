But those little capsules could be doing more than that. They also appear to dull both positive and negative emotions.\n\"A recent study suggests that acetaminophen -- found in Tylenol, Excedrin and a host of other medications -- is an all-purpose damper, stifling a range of strong feelings,\" The Wall Street Journal reported last week . \"Throbbing pain, the sting of rejection, paralyzing indecision -- along with euphoria and delight -- all appear to be taken down a notch by the drug.\"\nThe study, led by Ohio State University psychology doctoral student Geoffrey Durso and building on research from 2010, determined that acetaminophen tamps down strong feelings -- such as the pain from being picked on, or our natural reaction to seeing either shocking or pleasing images. The study, which was published in the journal Psychological Science , reported that \"participants who took acetaminophen evaluated unpleasant stimuli less negatively and pleasant stimuli less positively, compared with participants who took a placebo. ... These findings suggest that acetaminophen has a general blunting effect on individuals' evaluative and emotional processing, irrespective of negative or positive valence.\"\nSaid Durso: \"This means that using Tylenol or similar products might have broader consequences than previously thought.\"\nOhio State, in a press statement released over the summer, said the side effect has never been documented before, even though acetaminophen has been in use for 70 years.\nThe university pointed out that ibuprofen and aspirin, the other popular over-the-counter painkillers, are non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and acetaminophen is not. It is not known whether ibuprofen and aspirin have a similar effect on \"emotional evaluations\" as acetaminophen does.\nThe Oregonian's Lynne Terry reported this week that aspirin could turn out to be a \"wonder drug.\" She wrote that studies show that aspirin benefits cancer patients and may help prevent heart disease and Alzheimer's disease.\n-- Douglas Perry", "external_links": ["http://pss.sagepub.com/content/early/2015/04/09/0956797615570366.abstract", "https://news.osu.edu/news/2015/04/13/emotion-reliever/", "http://www.wsj.com/articles/less-pain-less-joy-a-new-look-at-acetaminophen-1443019193"], "published": "2015-09-30T22:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T00:26:45.871+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
