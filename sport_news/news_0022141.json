It has a budget of $129 million and plans to redo the exterior of the 25-year-old building. It will also add new locker rooms and suites, upgrade the bathrooms and bring a new scoreboard. \nThe Timberwolves will play in the building through the renovation. But the WNBA’s Lynx will have to move out of the building for the 2017 season while renovations are completed. It is not yet known where the Lynx will play. \nThe Wolves also announced an extension of the naming rights deal with Target. \nCopyright © 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T21:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T23:52:30.450+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
