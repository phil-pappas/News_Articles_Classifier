Offensive coordinator Clay Helton was appointed interim coach Sunday.\nThe school hasn't been specific about Sarkisian's problems, but the second-year coach had an embarrassing public display in August at a pep rally where he appeared to be intoxicated while giving a speech. Sarkisian later apologized and said he had combined alcohol and medication, but promised not to drink again during the season.\n\"After careful consideration of what is in the best interest of the university and our student-athletes, I have made the decision to terminate Steve Sarkisian, effective immediately,\" Haden said in a statement.\n\"I want to add how proud I am of our coaching staff and players and the way they are responding to this difficult situation. Through all of this we remain concerned for Steve and hope that it will give him the opportunity to focus on his personal well-being.\"\nUSC athletic director Pat Haden announces the termination of Steve Sarkisian as head football coach: http://t.co/KrqKSEf2hG\n— USC Trojans (@USC_Athletics) October 12, 2015 Helton, Sarkisian's offensive coordinator, will officially lead his first practice Tuesday as the Trojans (3-2, 1-2 Pac-12) prepare for their annual rivalry game with No. 14 Notre Dame.\nSarkisian went 12-6 at USC, where he was an assistant coach under Pete Carroll with the program's dominant teams of the past decade. He spent five years as Washington's head coach until 2013.\nSarkisian also in the midst of a divorce from his wife, Stephanie, and he recently sold a palatial house south of Los Angeles. They have three children.\nThe hallowed USC football program has endured turmoil for most of the past six years since Carroll left the school for the NFL's Seattle Seahawks in 2009.\nAfter the tumultuous 3½-year tenure of fired coach Lane Kiffin, Sarkisian and his players have made several public missteps during his short tenure. Sarkisian's coaching also faced widespread scrutiny after a 17-12 loss to Washington last week dropped the preseason No. 8 team out of the AP Top 25.\nSarkisian's former colleagues and opponents offered words of compassion and encouragement Monday after he began his leave. The school hasn't said whether Sarkisian is seeking treatment.\n\"It breaks my heart to see how this has gone,\" Seattle Seahawks coach Pete Carroll said on 710 ESPN radio in Seattle. \"But he recognizes it, and he's going to do something about it, so this is the day the turn occurs. I'm grateful for everybody around him that he's finally figured it out. We'll see nothing but good stuff to happen. It's going to take a long time, it's a big battle, and we'll pull for him all the way.\"\nSarkisian never faced any public scrutiny for alcohol use in Seattle, although his enthusiasm for nights out became part of his identity among fans and media.\nWashington athletic director Scott Woodward issued a brief statement: \"It is evident that Steve is dealing with a serious personal matter and we wish him the best in facing whatever challenges lay ahead.\"\nChris Petersen was a candidate for the USC job won by Sarkisian, and the former Boise State coach replacedSarkisian at Washington shortly afterward. Petersen then beat Sarkisian in their first meeting last Thursday, leading the unranked Huskies past USC 17-12.\n\"This is a tough job,\" Petersen said Monday. \"You just feel bad for the whole situation for everybody. We could talk a long time about that. It's hard enough to lose. It's a hard enough job when you're doing well, and when something doesn't go right in your situation and everybody piles on, I think it's very tough. Everybody has got their opinion now, and I don't think everybody knows exactly everything that goes on to have an opinion like that.\"", "external_links": ["http://t.co/KrqKSEf2hG", "https://twitter.com/USC_Athletics/status/653669581769195520"], "published": "2015-10-12T22:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T04:13:25.168+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
