Comment The Herald News, Fall River, MA By Herald News Staff Posted Oct. 22, 2015 at 5:24 PM Updated at 5:30 PM Posted Oct. 22, 2015 at 5:24 PM Updated at 5:30 PM It will be winner take all Saturday afternoon in Fall River as Bishop Connolly and Blue Hills, both unbeaten in league play, square off for the Mayflower League (Large Division) title. The Cougars (6-0) host the Warriors (5-1) on Saturday at 1 p.m. Bishop Connolly comes into this meeting red hot, having outscored its opponents 96-0 in the last three weeks. The Cougar defense has not allowed a touchdown in the last 14 quarters. In fact, the Cougars have never trailed once this season. “I’d be a little concerned about that if we had a young group,” said Bishop Connolly coach Anthony Nalen. “We’ve got a veteran group here and I think they’d be able to bounce back. “Our defense has been outstanding. Adam Dellicker (MLB) is the rock in the middle of our 3-3 stack defense. When I showed up here, these were very coachable kids and we just turned them loose. They understand football.” Blue Hills is fresh off a 38-14 win over Southeastern and Nalen knows his Cougars will have their hands full. Both the Cougars and Warriors have already locked up postseason berths, but it’s the division championship that’s up for grabs. Bishop Stang is also seeking a league championship and will need a victory at Bishop Feehan tonight (7 p.m.) for that to happen. The Spartans come in with a 5-1 mark (2-1 in the Eastern Athletic Conference), while the Shamrocks (3-3) are undefeated in league play. Bishop Stang’s lone EAC loss came in Week 3 when the Spartans dropped a 22-0 decision at Somerset Berkley. Last week, Somerset Berkley lost 9-6 at Bishop Feehan. Here is a closer look at the rest of the local football schedule taking place this weekend: Nauset (0-6) at Durfee (1-5) Tonight, 7 p.m . Someone will put an end to a lengthy losing streak in this one. Durfee comes in riding a four-game skid, while Nauset enters the game winless in six tries. Nauset, coached by former Green Bay Packers coach Mike Sherman, has played a difficult schedule, including games against Marshfield (6-0), Cardinal Spellman (6-0) and Falmouth (5-1). Durfee hasn’t won since defeating Taunton 22-8 in Week 2. Hilltopper running back Eli Brooks seeks his seventh straight 100-yard rushing game. Brooks has 1,032 rushing yards and eight touchdowns through six games. He had his lowest output last weekend, racking up 125 yards on 18 carries in a loss at Brockton. Bristol-Plymouth (2-4) at Diman (1-5) Tonight, 7 p.m. The Bengals hope to rebound after last week’s 27-0 loss at Bishop Connolly, while the Craftsmen defeated Tri-County 20-13 last week. Page 2 of 2 - Martha’s Vineyard (3-3) at Somerset Berkley (3-2) Tonight, 6 p.m. The Raiders are also in the running for a share of that EAC championship if they knock off the Vineyarders and get help from Bishop Stang, needing the Spartans to win at Bishop Feehan for a three-way tie. Somerset Berkley’s focus is taking care of its own business against the Vineyard, which has been shut out in two of its three EAC games this year. Case (4-2) at Fairhaven (3-3) Tonight, 7:30 p.m. The Cardinals round out their South Coast Conference schedule with a trip to Fairhaven in a game where kickoff time has been pushed back to 7:30 p.m. The Cardinals struggled defensively a week ago as GNB Voc-Tech, after fumbling away its first possession, scored on every series after in a 47-20 win over the Cards. Fairhaven, a week after losing to those same Bears 20-19, is coming off a convincing 45-0 victory over Bourne. North Providence (4-3) at Tiverton (2-4) Saturday, 7 p.m. Tiverton looks to get back on the scoreboard after having been shutout and outscored 81-0 during the last two weeks.
