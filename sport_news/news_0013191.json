It's just we've got pretty good starting pitching, and if they can get deep into the game -- you've got, again, what I think is one of the best closers in baseball. If you can get your starters to give you eight, and turn the ball over to him, I like your chances. But believe me, I like the guys that are setting up.\" \nCollins can hardly be faulted for using Familia so much. He's been really good. In six appearances, he hasn't allowed a run. He's only allowed just one hit and struck out four batters.

He pitched the final two innings of the Game 5 win over the Dodgers. Then he got the last four outs Saturday night. \nEven if it's not intended, it seems that Collins doesn't have full confidence in the rest of his bullpen. Tyler Clippard and Addison Reed have struggled. Bartolo Colon has become a middle reliever. And Familia has become a workhorse after 43 saves this season. \n\"I don't know, maybe Jeurys tomorrow night will need a night off and we can close with (Tyler Clippard) and set up with Addison (Reed),\" Collins said. \"We've got options down there. But when you've got Jake who is going deep into games, and tonight Matt went deep in the game, I'm hoping Noah tomorrow goes deep in the game. That's the perfect scenario. Sometimes it happens and sometimes it doesn't, but when it does, I think you've got to go to it.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T19:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T22:53:15.307+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
