With the team’s early struggles, Tischler learned a valuable life lesson to never give up. \n“One thing I’ve learned about football is that if you miss, you have to figure out what’s wrong and go forward,” she said. \nEven though she’s the only girl on the team, Tischler was easily embraced by the rest of the Blackhawks roster. \n“The boys have been great toward me,” she said. “I’m just one of the kids on the team.” \nWith more than half of her only football season behind her, Tischler has no regrets about making the move into a sport mainly dominated by males. \n“It’s taught me a lot about teamwork and hard work.
