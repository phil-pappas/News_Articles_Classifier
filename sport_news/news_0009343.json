On Tuesday, in front of a sold out Citi Field crowd, Kershaw delivered the type of performance we have come to expect out of the three-time NL Cy Young Award winner. In seven innings, Kershaw held the New York Mets to three hits and struck out eight. His only blemish being a solo homer by Daniel Murphy .\nIn a potential series-ending Game 4, the Mets leaned on rookie Steven Matz , who pitched in his first major league game in 19 days. Aside from the third inning where he allowed three runs to score off back-to-back hits by Adrian Gonzalez and Justin Turner , Matz held the Dodgers' offense in check. However, it didn't matter all that much what the 24-year-old was able to do on the mound for the Mets because it was the Kershaw show.\nWhen the tying run came up to the plate in the eighth inning, Dodgers manager Don Mattingly called on his closer Kenley Jansen to get the final four outs and send the series back to Los Angeles for Game 5. After dancing around some trouble, Jansen was able to do just that.\nNow, the series is headed back to the West Coast where he will find out which team will play the Chicago Cubs in the NLCS.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T07:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T07:41:26.500+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
