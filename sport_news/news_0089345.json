They also didn’t meet the Mets’ fastballs or their unholy offspeed pitches.\nThe Cubs had no hitting, no pitching, no defense and no chance. That goes for Game 4. That goes for the entire series, a four-game sweep in which they never held a lead.\nThe Mets, then, go to the World Series. The Cubs go home.\nThe Cubs’ death spiral out of the playoffs included failing to deliver a leadoff hit until the 31st inning of the series, by which time they had lost three games and trailed 6-0 in the fourth Wednesday.\nThe Cubs’ death spiral into a sweep included failing to score more than a single run in any inning until the 35th of the 36 total in the series, by which time the Mets led 8-1.\nIn an excruciating sequence that easily could be a snapshot of this series, the Cubs were one pitch away from getting out of the first inning of Game 4 with no damage, then bang, 4-0, Mets, on back-to-back homers.\nThe Mets’ four-run first inning almost matched the Cubs total for the series to that point. The first inning got so bad that Mets rookie pitcher Steven Matz batted in his first NLCS game before he ever threw a pitch.\nKris Bryant: 'I'm looking forward to the future' Cubs' Kris Bryant: \"I'm looking forward to the future.\"\nCubs' Kris Bryant: \"I'm looking forward to the future.\"\nSee more videos No, wait, the first two innings got so bad that Lucas Duda, who was 3-for-24 in the postseason, bombed a three-run home run in the first and then drove in two more runs in the second.\nNo, wait, it got so bad that Starlin Castro struck out on a pitch that hit him on the back foot.\nThe Cubs’ response to the Mets’ six-run assault in the first two innings was to go out 1-2-3-4-5-6.\nWhen they loaded the bases with none out in the fourth, they managed one measly run.\nWhen they had second and third in the fifth to knock out Matz, they scored nothing. Zip. Zilch. Zero.\nAnd then they pitched to Daniel Murphy and he set a home-run record.\nThat happens to a young team on the come. That happens to a good team with holes.\nThe Mets exposed every shortcoming the Cubs heroically and magically hid and overcame this season:\nDefenders who are better hitters than defenders. Controlling an opponents’ running game, and the Mets didn’t even have a running game this season. A bullpen that included a lot of pitchers designated for assignment. A power-hitting team that couldn’t manufacture offense if it didn’t hit home runs. A rotation that was three starters short. Cubs applaud the Wrigley faithful Cubs players applaud the fans at Wrigley Field.\nCubs players applaud the fans at Wrigley Field.\nSee more videos Those areas can be improved. They will be improved. Cubs management has shown that it can and will address whatever’s sensible and necessary.\nThose areas also will improve because the core of terrific young players will get better, benefiting from both the wonderful accomplishment of making the playoffs and the painful reality of being eliminated from them.\nYeah, this looks and feels awful now, but this has been a terrific season. Who figured this?\nThere will be more terrific seasons to follow, and that’s what’s different about this playoff appearance.\nThis wasn’t a desperate situation. This wasn’t a matter of win now or blow it up or fire the manager. This wasn’t 2003 and ’08. No, this is sustainable.\nClip & save: same time, next year, different result.\n Major League Baseball Baseball Chicago Cubs New York Mets National League Championship Series World Series Daniel Murphy", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-5628dcb9/turbine/ct-cubs-swept-by-mets-rosenbloom-20151022", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-5628e833/turbine/ct-cubs-bryant-video-spt-20151021", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-56287676/turbine/ct-cubs-fans-20151021"], "published": "2015-10-22T16:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T16:55:55.467+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
