Only 14 active players were on the roster at season's end, down from 40 just seven years ago. \n\"The board did an assessment of interest in the program, found that there were probably insufficient students to maintain a team, and decided to cancel the team for this year,\" Mitten said. \nMaplewood isn't alone. Schools in Maine and New Jersey have canceled or cut short their seasons this year due to injuries or low student interest. The total number of high school students playing football across America has dropped by more than 25,000 over the past five years. \n\"Youth participation is declining, high school participation is declining. This trend is going to continue,\" Time magazine senior writer Sean Gregory said. \nGregory reports on football for Time and writes about the dangers of concussions on the gridiron. \n\"I'm not ready to call 'Friday Night Lights' off in the next 10 years, but I wouldn't be surprised if coaches are having kind of a more difficult time attracting quality players,\" Gregory said. \nAt Maplewood, an increasing number of students are trying out for the cross country and soccer teams. \nIsaac Pearson is a sophomore on the soccer team. His older brother, J.P., played football at Maplewood. \n\"My mom's like... soccer's your thing. She doesn't want me to get hurt, too. But soccer's just something I really liked,\" Pearson said. \nA decade ago, this school had just a dozen young men on the soccer roster. That number has more than doubled. \nAnother clear sign of Maplewood's shift away from football: Next month's homecoming game will be a soccer game.
