Win, and even its league and overall records nearing the halfway point of the season. Lose, and it will be a hard hill to climb to make it to the Hawaii Bowl in December.\nThe Warriors are off to a tough start as they trail the Aztecs 21-14 in the third quarter.\nAfter falling behind by two touchdowns over the opening 30 minutes, Hawaii got the ball first to start the second half in an attempt to climb back into this game. The Warriors advanced into Aztecs territory, but a fourth-down pass attempt led to a sack and the Aztecs took over at their own 40.\nBut the Aztecs could do little with the football and eventually punted. They fumbled it on their second series. Wideout Jemond Hazely lost it at the Aztecs 32 on a third down pass play. It was recovered by UH's Marrell Jackson.\nSix plays later, helped by a pass interference penalty in the end zone on Aztecs quarterback J.J. Whitaker, the Warriors scored from 1 yard out on a quarterback sneak by senior quarterback Max Wittek. Rigoberto Sanchez added the PAT to cut San Diego State's lead to 21-14 with 7:13 left in the third quarter.\nThe Aztecs scored early and often in the first half.\nSan Diego State took the opening kickoff and marched 75 yards on seven running plays, including a 34-yard scoring jaunt by Donnel Pumphrey on third-and-short. Pumphrey gained 67 yards on four carries to start the game as Donny Hageman added the PAT to make it 7-0 with 11:44 left in the first quarter.\nA Hawaii fumble by Quinton Pedroza on the Warriors opening offensive series was recovered by the Aztecs at the Hawaii 32-yard line. Four plays later, Pumphrey scored his second touchdown of the game, this time from 8 yards out as Hageman made the PAT to give SDSU a 14-0 advantage at the 9:10 mark of the first quarter.\nHawaii finally got on the board in the second quarter to cut SDSU's advantage to 14-7 with 12:44 left in the half. The Warriors went 75 yards on seven plays, the final one was a 1-yard scoring run by Melvin Davis as Sanchez added the PAT to get UH back in the game. A 52-yard completion from Wittek to Isaiah Bernhard was the big play of the drive.\nSan Diego State struck quickly to build its lead back to 14 on a 58-yard touchdown pass from Aztecs quarterback Max Smith to a wide open Eric Judge, who beat Ne'Quan Phillips badly on the play. Hageman hit the PAT to extend the SDSU advantage to 21-7 with 1:40 left in the half.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T02:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T09:34:01.930+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
