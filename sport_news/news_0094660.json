The Wildcats lost 55-0 — the worst home loss in school history. Many fans did not return to their seats following halftime when th \nVery few fansstayed around to watch the final two quarters of Kansas State’s worst home loss in school history on Saturday. \nShut out for the first time since 1996 — and at home since 1991 — the Wildcats have now lost three straight games and have only a few days before they travel to Austin, Texas, to face the Longhorns. \n“We had too many mistakes,” said K-State left tackle Cody Whitehair following K-State’s 55-0 loss to Oklahoma. “We had interceptions, missed blocks, missed tackles, anything and everything went wrong today, so we really just need to focus and get back on track.” \nLosing always stings, but the way the Wildcats (3-3, 0-3 Big 12) lost is a wound that ran deep Saturday night — for players, coaches and even the fans, who left Bill Snyder Family Stadium early. \n“Don’t give up on us and keep believing in us,” K-State receiver/quarterback Kody Cook said in a message to the fanbase. “This is the most disappointing loss I’ve ever experienced in my career and I know (the fans) are really disappointed in the last three weeks, but I think a pretty good team in 2003 won the Big 12 championship after three losses, so it can be done. \n“We’ll bounce back. There is no doubt in my mind that we’ll bounce back. Coach (Bill) Snyder will have us ready… Don’t give up on us. There’s no reason to give up on us now.” \nSnyder had a message for Wildcat fans as well. \n“I have a great appreciation for those who stay with us,” he said. “They’ve always been great fans and I appreciate that a great deal. If I were sitting up there, I probably would have left early today too. We didn’t do anything to deserve to keep them in the stands. I apologize for that and hope they’ll have some confidence in the effort our people put forward and will continue to be there to support us. \n“I just think back to 1989 — it was rough — but people came and they were there for the players. I appreciated them for that.” \nWhitehair did not mince any words when it came to this Saturday’s game at Texas — beginning at 11 a.m. on Fox Sports 1. The senior came just short of calling it a must-win for his Wildcats. \n“We’re a 3-3 football team now and I think that game is a statement game for us,” he said. “We want to get back on the winning track. We’re 0-3 in the last three games and to get a conference win would be huge for our confidence level and to get our team some momentum.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T22:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T05:18:23.557+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
