The allegation against him was that he submitted forged certificates to bag the award for 2008-09.\nKapadia, the 60-year-old Karate coach, had challenged the rejection of his pre-arrest bail by the Bombay high court on March 13. The SC set aside the HC order. Earlier on April 1, the SC had granted him interim protection against arrest and stayed the HC order.\nSenior counsel Fali Nariman assisted by advocates S N Raj and A Sodder who appeared for Kapadia said that he had also filed a counter complaint of alleged forgery, cheating and suppression of evidence against the complainant Salauddin Ansari which the Mumbai crime branch (unit-II) has registered as an FIR and is investigating.\nNariman said that Kapadia has been cooperating with the investigations since the end of the 2013. After the HC orders, he said that Kapadia had willingly offered to attend the Crime Branch for investigations and the SC then directed his attendance for three days.\nNariman, significantly argued that the complainant Ansari had filed a false complaint. Nariman said that Ansari's own email in September 2011 which he addressed to 79 members of Maharashtra Karate Association, stated that a former general secretary had prepared the award file for Kapadia.\nThe SC order by a bench of Justices T S Thakur and Joseph Kurian, making the pre-arrest relief absolute, comes to Kapadia after two rejections in the sessions and Bombay high court. The HC had even held that prima facie a case was made out against him. The Gamdevi police station had registered a case against Kapadia who was awarded the 'Utkrushtha Kreeda Margadarshak Puraskar' by the state government.\nAnsari's lawyer Nikhil Chaudhari argued that Kapadia had given certificates of students as winners who were not even participants and some who were not even in India when the events were held. He submitted undertakings from nine students including those of Ansari's wife Shaheen, his son and daughter Sana. Chaudhari argued that Kapadia's custodial interrogation was essential to recover the original blank certificate and find out who else was involved in the \"racket.\" But the SC felt an arrest was not required for that.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T19:46:47.533+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
