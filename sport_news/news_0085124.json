(Photo: Al Goldis/Special to Lansing State Journal) \nA near-capacity crowd filled the Breslin Center early for autographs and stayed around for performances by the Spartan Marching Band, the MSU cheerleaders, the dance team and, of course, Sparty. \nFollowing the introductions of the Michigan State women's basketball team -- each of whom entered the Breslin Center with a solid 5-15 seconds of dance moves -- MSU women's head coach Suzy Merchant's entered as one of \"Sparty's Angels.\" \nCheck out Merchant's appearance at Midnight Madness \nA little after 10 p.m., following a performance by the MSU Drumline, the men's team introductions started. The assistant coaches were introduced and then a video played highlighting last year's run to the Final Four. The men's team entered one by one, through the crowd, congregating at midcourt. \nWith the 15,000 or so in a frenzy -- MSU said they reached capacity and had to turn people away -- Tom Izzo followed a Mission: Impossible-themed video by entering Breslin Center wearing a black suit. He walked down the stairs, through the crowd with his family. After introducing a Tom Cruise-look-alike, Izzo referred to himself as \"the boring Tom.\" \nCheck out Izzo's appearance at Midnight Madness \nFollowing an MSU One Shining Moment video, Izzo addressed the crowd, the team gathered and the Spartans raised another banner to the rafters -- this time, the 2015 Final Four banner. \nAfter the women's basketball team took the floor and played a short 10-minute scrimmage, the men's team came out and turned their warm-ups into somewhat of a slam dunk contest. Those that remained until 11:15pm then witnessed the men's 20-minute scrimmage. \nThe new Final Four banner in the rafters at Breslin Center.
