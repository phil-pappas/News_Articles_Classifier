Steve Lundy | Staff Photographer \nGrayslake Central's football team is not running on empty. \n\"I'm fueled by the promise of tomorrow,\" a positive-thinking Mikey Andrews said. Story Continues Below \nAndrews and his Grayslake Central teammates travel to Grayslake North on Friday night for the two teams' annual rivalry game. The Fox Valley Conference Fox Division battle is sure to be a gas, so to speak, even though Grayslake Central (0-7, 0-4) is still seeking its first win since Week 8 of 2013 (17 straight defeats), while Grayslake North (4-3, 3-1) is looking to all but clinch a playoff berth with a victory. \n\"I'm expecting a hard-fought game,\" said Andrews, the Rams' junior running back. \"Those kids north of Washington (St.) have a great team. They're well-coached. It's a shame that (quarterback Merrick) Gentile is down with that ACL (suffered before the start of the season). But his backup (Jacob Wright) is just as good, and Dami (Oladunmoye) in the backfield is a great player. They've got plenty of good kids.\" \nWhile Wright (touchdown runs of 77 and 73 yards, 196 total rushing yards) and Oladunmoye (119 rushing yards, 2 TDs) led Grayslake North to victory at Woodstock last Friday, Grayslake Central also had a productive night, despite dropping a 35-14 decision to visiting Woodstock North. \nThe Rams ran out of the I-formation with Andrews at tailback, Luke Shepherd at fullback and Billy Drevline at quarterback. Shepherd entered the season as the team's returning starting QB. Grayslake Central manufactured a 13-play drive on its first series, which ended with an Andrews touchdown run from 16 yards out. \nAndrews finished the night with 108 yards on the ground on 17 carries. \n\"I like that (I-formation) a lot,\" Andrews said. \"I'm kind of biased because I'm more of an impact runner than a style runner. With the I-formation, going downhill faster, I'm able to make better reads, better cuts and better shoulder trucks, per se.\" \nRams coach Jason Schaal said Drevline will make his second start in a row at QB against Grayslake North. That's not a knock on the 6-foot-3, 245-pound Shepherd, however. Shepherd played some quarterback, as well, against Woodstock North. \n\"He kept opening the holes and Mikey was able to get through,\" Schaal said. \"We know we can always go back to four wide and put Luke at quarterback if we need a little stronger arm. Luke's done a great job for us. He's been a leader for us. He's a passionate kid.\" \nThe Rams may be winless, but they are not devoid of talent and tough football kids. \n\"We might not have had the best year on the scoreboard, but I've seen positives here and there,\" Andrews said. \nThe bright spots have included Andrews, Shepherd, senior wide receiver Noah Comerford, senior linebacker Ryan Ford and returning all-conference linebacker Richard Novrouzov. \nComerford has 20 receptions, including 5 for TDs. \n\"He's gotten big catches when we needed them,\" said Schaal, noting Comerford's improved route running this season and his chemistry with Shepherd. \nThe 5-11, 190-pound Ford has played both inside and outside linebacker and even defensive end. He was a JV player last year. \n\"I know he was little frustrated (last year),\" Schaal said. \"As the season went on, he continued to grow.\" \nThis season, Ford has been the Rams' defensive player of the week four times. \n\"He flies on the field,\" Schaal said. \"He's a leader, he's calm, and he's passionate about playing the game.\" \nThe same can be said about Novrouzov, who's played hurt most of the season. He suffered a bone bruise on his leg in Week 2 at Prairie Ridge. \n\"The kid hits like a Mack truck,\" Schaal said. \"He's a leader. He's in the training room on a daily basis getting treatment, but he's never missed a practice.\" \nConsider it another bright spot for the Rams.
