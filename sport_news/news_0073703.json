That probably explains why he’s always on the move — raiding offices, carrying out surprise checks, suspending the staff, including doctors. That’s when he is not pushing his constituency’s interests or busy tweeting to stir up controversies. Essentially a people’s man who likes staying in public view, Vij’s “antics” may sound well for somebody outside the government, but it adds up little to his report card of a year as a minister. The Health Department is ailing, far from being in the pink of health. Faced with a shortage of doctors, idle machines for the want of technical hands and an infrastructure that’s gradually crumbling, the Health Department is in need of systematic “treatment” rather than activism that earns momentary applause before it fizzles out, observers point out. The minister, always in his office or in his constituency, however, seems to be busy sending out the message that anybody can be in his line of fire, thereby keeping the officers, doctors and staff on their toes but accomplishing little in the end. Vij, who is in charge of the Sports Department as well, did come out with a sports policy but he is better known for stirring controversies where none exist. Whether it was announcing the re-naming of sports stadia in Haryana or tweeting about choosing Parineeti Chopra as the brand ambassador for the “Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao” programme or going public with his differences with Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar for “taking interest in his departments”, Vij did not let any opportunity go by. Easily accessible and very clean, his compulsion to remain in the news seems to stem from the fact that he has not been given his due in terms of ministries. Despite being a five-time legislator, first-timers are senior to him in the pecking order. To keep himself relevant, Vij, it seems, needs to be seen and heard. For his constituency, however, Vij has been moving things. He kicked off the construction of a five-storey building of the Civil Hospital equipped with advanced medical facilities, for which the state had allotted Rs 40 crore, got a budget for a national memorial of martyrs of the 1857 mutiny, and Rs 12 crore from the government for laying a football AstroTurf and a synthetic athletic track in War Heroes Memorial Ground. Two major rail projects — making Ambala Cantt railway station a world-class one and setting up a bottling plant — are pending for years. People expect that being a senior minister, he can affectively pursue it with the Centre.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T04:15:55.087+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
