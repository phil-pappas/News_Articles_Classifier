He's taking full advantage. Jonathan Laurent CONNECT 1 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nPISCATAWAY -- Jonathan Laurent whizzed past his man, making a textbook-tight cut to the basket. He took a bounce pass in stride from Corey Sanders and threw down a two-handed dunk from the right block before the help defense could arrive. \nOn the next trip down, Laurent drove hard to his left for a layup, grabbed his own miss over a player four inches taller and muscled the ball back through the hoop. \nIn October, every college basketball team has its “buzz” guy -- a less-heralded player who opens eyes and turns heads. The 6-foot-6 Laurent, a freshman wing, is that guy for the Rutgers men. Kadeem Jack \"staying humble\" after signing with Pacers \n“He’s an awesome athlete,” head coach Eddie Jordan said. “He gets to the rim, finishes well around the basket. He catches and goes, runs the floor well. He gets through screens like he’s Evel Knievel. I like his aggressiveness on defense. And he’s a great kid.” \nThis is Rutgers’ deepest team in several years, but the Florida native finds himself in a unique situation as the only true wing on the roster. \nJonathan Laurent (Photo: Mark Sullivan) \n“I feel like it’s a great opportunity,” he said. “I’ve come in here with a chance to play a lot. I feel like the coaching staff loves me and what I can do for this team.” \nIt will be interesting to see how Jordan deploys him. During Thursday’s practice, Laurent spent much of the time defending bigger players. \n“I don’t mind that,” he said. “It’s hard, but anything can happen in a game. You never know, so you want to be able to do anything on the floor.” Newcomers in spotlight as Rutgers hoops practice opens \nLaurent spent his first two years of high school as a power forward, so the perimeter game -- jump-shooting and ball-handling -- is still coming to him. But he has impressed Rutgers’ coaches with his attack mentality. \n“I’ll do anything to win,” he said. “If the ball is falling out of bounds, I’m jumping on the floor and throwing it in. If I’ve got to take a charge, I’ll take a charge. If I have to guard a 7-foot-5 guy, I’ll do it.” \nOdds and ends Asked how close he was to implementing a full-court pressure defense, Jordan replied, “We’re not there yet.” \n“I think we gamble a little too much,” he said. “Maybe that will help us down the road, but it hasn’t helped us so far in practice. But I do like the fact that we want to defend. We’ve got god athletes -- better than good athletes -- and that helps.” The season opener is five weeks away, so Jordan has time to settle on a starting lineup. Right now, it’s anybody’s guess. \n“I tell them almost every day, 10 guys could start,” he said. “They have to convince me, doing the little things.” Rutgers will hold closed-door scrimmages against George Mason and Lafayette prior to the Nov. 13 opener against Rutgers-Newark. \nStaff writer Jerry Carino: jcarino@gannettnj.com .
