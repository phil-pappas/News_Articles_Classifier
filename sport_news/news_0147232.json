Two seasons after it was torched for some big numbers, Duke’s defense has become the staple of the team. “We took those hits and we didn’t want to be known in a negative light,” senior safety Jeremy Cash said. “I think we’ve actually underachieved because we haven’t got the ball out (forcing turnovers) as much as we would like.” Going into Saturday’s game at Army (1-4), the Blue Devils (4-1) could be in another defensive tussle. Those have worked out well the past couple of weeks. “I guess it’s cool,” linebacker Dwayne Norman said. “We’re all having our hard work pay off.” Duke has allowed 53 points this season (and seven of those resulted from a Northwestern kickoff return for a touchdown). That’s the lowest point total given up by a Duke team through five games of a season since 1971. More recently, the Blue Devils have come a long ways in a short time considering the high totals yielded just two years ago. “We’re really proud of what we’ve done this year,” defensive tackle A.J. Wolf said. Norman said there’s no sense of entitlement building from the defensive players because, after all, there needs to be some points on the board for the Blue Devils in order for them to feel good at the end of games. “We can’t win the game by ourselves,” Norman said. On defense, it has been a collective effort in many ways. Sixteen Duke defenders have been credited with at least a partial tackle of a loss this season.
