It’s his backyard training ground. He knows the exact distance from the backyard of his house to Hawi and the Natural Energy Lab — both landmarks of the iconic endurance event. \nA few friends, and some other 2,300 other athletes joined Brocks for his 140.6-mile swim, bike and run routine at the IronmanWorld Championship in Kailua-Kona on Saturday. \nBrocks finished as the top Big Island athlete at the world championship event, stopping the clock at 10 hours 27 minutes and 48 seconds. \nThe Kona resident — who splits time between the Big Island and Portland — ranked 63rd in his 45-49 age group, and finished 618 overall. \nIt was Brocks’ 10th time finishing the world championship race and 56th Ironmanrace overall. He said it wasn’t his best time, and he would have liked to go under 10 hours, but still felt fortunate after the finish. \n“There are people who would give anything to race here. It’s so special to race in Kona, and I’ve been able to do it 10 times now. I’m pretty blessed to have done that,” Brocks said. “Even as a hobby, you have to take it seriously. If I’m not doing my best, I wouldn’t be giving the race the respect it deserves.” \nBrocks wasn’t quick to take off after the race. His wife, Mary Stupi, was still on the course. She came in a few hours later, at 14:04:45. \n“She really, really embraced it,” Brocks said of his wife, who got in through a Kona lottery spot. “It’s really cool. I’m very proud of her.” \nBrocks is a training partner and good friend of last year’s top Big Island finisher Keish Doi. Doi finished as the fourth Big Islander on Saturday, less than an hour behind Brocks. The finish added just a bit of fuel to the friendly rivalry the Kona duo have had going over the years. However, Brocks was humble in his victory. \n“I know he has been a little banged up running. If he’s not running well, I don’t really count it,” Brocks said with a smile. “I like beating him fair and square.” \nDoi was happy to see his friend succeed. \n“It was a tough day,” Doi said. “The swim and bike was really fun, but I have an ankle injury so it was pretty hard to run. But I think it still turned out pretty good. Any day you finish an Ironmanis a great day. \n“Steffen is a great athlete and a good friend of mine. It was nice to see him have a good day. Maybe we can go at it again next year.” \nAlejandro Novoa finished as the second Big Islander, and Thomas Wipp was third. \nThe 14th hour of the race saw the most Hawaii Island athletes come in. Jean Orlowski, Erik Basden, Una Burns, Gerd Weber, Kevin Prater, William Stedman and Shirley Pratt all came in within the hour. \nOther notable finishers \nSean Astin, known for his roles in “The Goonies,” “Rudy,” and “The Lord of the Rings”, finished the IronmanWorld Championship in 15:30:31. \n“It’s official, I am an Ironman,” Astin wrote on Twitter after the race. “It was a magical day.” \nLegendary Italian race car driver and paracyclist Alex Zanardi finished as the first physically challenged athlete, breaking the finishing tape along Alii Drive at 9:40:37, \nEmmy award winning actress Katherine Kelly Lang finished the 140.6-mile trek in 15:57:11. \nTammy Nicholson — who was told she would never walk again after a serious car accident 11 years ago — finished in 11:12:07. \nKyrsten Sinema became the first sitting US Representative to complete the race, coming in at 15:02:47 \nMichael Wilson, who had an 11-year professional career in the Australian football league, lit up the course with a time of 9:57:16. \nLocal finishers", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T19:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T02:55:26.909+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
