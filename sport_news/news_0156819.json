UEFA said Thursday that Kevin Lamour, head of the president’s office was taking a leave of absence.\nA UEFA spokesman said Lamour’s decision was “completely” unrelated to the Swiss investigation of Platini’s receipt in 2011 of a 2 million Swiss franc payment from Blatter.\nWhile Lamour’s departure is unconnected to the investigation and the scrutiny of Platini, it leaves the Frenchman without a trusted advisor at a difficult time. — Reuters", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T04:29:43.104+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
