Striker Bassem Morsi is also firing on all cylinders, having scored twice in the Egypt Cup win over Ahly.\nMorsi, who is usually fielded as a lone frontman in front of two attacking midfielders, was involved in a dispute with outspoken chairman Mortada Mansour a week before the game but it was quickly resolved.\nAhly and Zamalek will enjoy the backing of their fans in a derby for the first time since meeting in an African Champions League game in the Egyptian Red Sea resort of El-Gouna in 2013. The six Cairo derbies that followed this game were all played behind closed doors due to security concerns.\n\"It's better to play in the UAE because of the fan presence,\" said Zamalek's Portuguese coach Jesualdo Ferreira, who was the fourth boss to lead the team in a single season.\nThe match will take place in the Hazza Bin Zayed Stadium in Al-Ain city. The venue hosts up to 25,000 supporters.\nAhly are sweating over the fitness of Gabon striker and new recruit Malick Evouna, who picked up an ankle injury during Wednesday's training session.\nZamalek's only doubtful player is pacy right-back Hazem Emam, who is also racing against time to recover from injury.\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/AO_Sports", "https://www.facebook.com/AhramOnlineSports?fref=ts"], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T05:17:18.223+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
