He has 243 yards for the season. \nJosh Hicks led the team in rushing in each of the first four games and has a team-high 396 yards, while Robert Martin is nipping at his heels with 313 rushing yards. \nNo doubt that Indiana, which hosts Rutgers at 3:30 p.m., remembers Hicks and Martin after their joint coming-out party when the teams met a season ago. \nMartin finished with 83 yards and three touchdowns while Hicks totaled 114 and a score. \n“Their defense definitely looks a lot better than last year,” Martin said. “They are a more solid team and they play with a lot of energy. I watched the game when they played Ohio State. They played them with good energy. I think it’s going to be a good game and I’m looking forward to it.” \nMartin was the feature back on the 16-play 91-yard drive to tie the score against Michigan State with four minutes remaining. \nThe sophomore carried nine times, including on first-and-goal from the 9-yard line, when he gained five but was tripped up by an on-the-ground tackler wrestling with offensive lineman Chris Muller. Martin saw the huge hole in front of him. \n“I try to hit it in there and hit the hole hard because I know they were coming down the hill fast so I tried to get what I could get,” Martin said. \n“I definitely saw (the end zone) but then I saw my lineman and a defensive end on the ground so I tried to squeeze through. And I think he hit my legs when I tried to squeeze through.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T21:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T00:38:45.528+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
