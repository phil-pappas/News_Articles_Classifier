Bortles and the Jaguars had one last shot to drive down the field, but it wasn't looking good. On third-and-15, Bortles heaved a pass to Bryan Walters that fell incomplete. Then a flag came down, and Nickell Robey was flagged for pass interference despite not making much contact with the receiver.\nTwo plays later, Bortles connected with Allen Hurns for the game-winning touchdown pass.\n\"I really feel like it was a terrible call,\" Robey said in the locker room after the game. \"My teammates feel the same. They can vouch for me. So does my coaches. One thing I know, here right now, we all together still. We still here, still trying to put this big puzzle together and come away with all these wins. But sometimes I feel like it's just questionable and some, like the call today, are just terrible. I don't see where the contact was made, or where any of that was made. I didn't even press him that play. I played off coverage on that play. He ran, like — I'm going to the ball with my hands out. He's coming into me. I beat him to the spot. I already beat him to the spot. I'm gonna get the ball. And they still threw the flag. I don't understand.\"\nTHE WORST CALL PASS INTERFERENCE I EVER BEEN APART OF!!! #nflrefs\n— NickellRobey (@NickellRobey_37) October 25, 2015 Robey's penalty was one of 10 for the Bills. They now have 72 on the season after coming into the week with a league-leading 62. Defensive end Jerry Hughes had another unsportsmanlike conduct penalty and now has five 15-yard penalties this season. Of all the penalties, it was Robey's that cost the Bills the most Sunday.\n\"That one was tough, because I didn't see anything at all,\" linebacker Preston Brown said. \"I didn't see (Robey) touch him. So that's something we have to live with. We know, we're the Buffalo Bills and we're going to get that call.\"\nBills coach Rex Ryan, who has been vocal about certain penalty calls this season, took the high road.\n\"First off, the officials, that's a tough job,\" Ryan said. \"They got a tough job. They obviously do the best they can. I thought Robey had a better chance at it than their receiver. Apparently we fouled on that play. I mean, obviously that might be one of the reasons because I guess we fouled on it.\"", "external_links":
