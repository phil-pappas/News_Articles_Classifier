(AP Photo/Gene J. Puskar) (Gene J. Puskar / AP) Mark Wogenrich Contact Reporter Of The Morning Call The Penn State first-half report card, with extra attention on the freshman running back. \nFirst, the good news, according to Penn State coach James Franklin. \nPenn State (5-1, 2-0 in the Big Ten) remains in contention for the division title and is among just 28 teams in the country with a record of 5-1 or better. \nSounds great, right? Would have been a fine prediction in August for the season's first half. But the how remains confusing. \nCertainly, the Lions clawed back from a 27-10 season-opening loss to Temple with five wins at home, several of which required laboring through injuries, rain and fits of offensive inelegance. Yet here they are, headed to No. 1-ranked Ohio State with possibilities looming. \nBefore going to Columbus, however, here's a look at the ups and downs of Penn State's first six games. \nOFFENSIVE MVP: Saquon Barkley. Stunning that, on an offense with a projected first-round pick at quarterback, the player with the most impact has been a freshman running back. Note the difference in Penn State's offenses against Buffalo and Army, both of which were played in the rain. \nChristian Hackenberg played his best game last week against Indiana since the Pinstripe Bowl, but he really could benefit from Barkley's return, particularly in the fourth quarter. That's a warp-speed progression for the running back from Whitehall. \nDEFENSIVE MVP: Carl Nassib. Penn State's defensive line has been the team's best position group (by far) this season, and Nassib has been its breakthrough player. Tackles Anthony Zettel and Austin Johnson, in particular, have been exceptional inside, allowing Nassib to turn his \"Crazy Carl\" persona into an outside force. \nThe fifth-year senior, who started his first game this season since middle school, leads the nation in sacks and forced fumbles. Franklin even compared Nassib's productivity to that of Ohio State all-American Joey Bosa. Nassib has been a revelation. \nUNSUNG HERO: Jason Cabinda. The sophomore linebacker made probably the team's biggest leap this season, shifting from outside to inside following a season-ending injury to Nyeem Wartman-White. His progression has been essential to the defense. \nCabinda leads Penn State in tackles (46) and also has 31/2 sacks, maintaining his status as one of coordinator Bob Shoop's favorite blitzers. Further, Cabinda is vocal and alert with the defensive calls, a major factor in Shoop's defense. \nPLAY OF THE FIRST HALF (OFFENSE): Akeel Lynch's 75-yard touchdown run punctuated the Rutgers game, and Hackenberg's 33-yard touchdown pass to Mike Gesicki against Army was expertly designed. But Barkley made an electric play against San Diego State that defined his status as a game-changer. \nIn the first half, Barkley turned what should have been a 4-yard gain on a screen pass into a 22-yard touchdown. Franklin has said that Barkley shines at averting and breaking tackles. No play better underscored that. \nPLAY OF THE FIRST HALF (DEFENSE): After Barkley's injury, Penn State needed a big defensive play to help hold off San Diego State. Fittingly, the defensive line provided it. \nNassib sacked Aztecs quarterback Maxwell Smith, forcing a fumble that Johnson scooped for a 77-yard touchdown. The play turned a potential go-ahead score into the cushion of a 37-21 victory. \nBRIGHT SPOTS: Penn State has played 22 true or redshirt freshmen, with several making quick impacts. Receiver Brandon Polk has made the jet sweep (and its attendant fake) his own, turning one last week into a touchdown pass. Cornerback John Reid, pressed to start the opener, has handled the stage well, making two interceptions. \nThe linebacker position has withstood several injuries, with Brandon Bell (when not hurt) and Troy Reeder showing promise. On the offensive line, Andrew Nelson returned with a strong game after missing three games. And before missing two extra points against Indiana, kicker Joey Julius was 8-for-9 on field goals and perfect on PATs. Franklin said he's sticking with Julius, expecting it to be a momentary lapse. \nNEEDS IMPROVEMENT: Apparently, the offensive line will be inconsistent all season, so Penn State needs to execute its attempts to minimize that more effectively. Chiefly, Hackenberg has to be more accurate throwing short passes, particularly those slants that could deliver yards after catch. \nFurther, the Lions' 31-percent conversion rate on third down could be helped by staying out of third-and-long situations. Consistent punting (40 yards, 4 seconds of hang time every time) would make a difference, too. \nWHAT TO WATCH: The Lions have lost significantly more player games to injury this year than last, particularly at linebacker and in the secondary. Running back Akeel Lynch's return from his injury would generate more rushing options. \nOff the field, Penn State will hold three town-hall meetings in the next three weeks to discuss its long-term facilities plan. The driver of those meetings will be the future status of Beaver Stadium. The athletic department wants to gauge the temperature of the fan base (and donors) regarding whether to renovate or build anew. \nTHE BOTTOM LINE: The first half has proven that, despite the NCAA sanctions being lifted, Penn State still is dealing with their lingering residue, particularly regarding depth and injuries. Winning five home games after the Temple loss was a start, but the season's back half will be quite a bit more challenging. \nFIRST-HALF GRADES \nOFFENSE: C. There's potential, but Franklin and his staff have spent too much time masking their self-described \"challenges.\" \nDEFENSE: A-. So good at making QBs uncomfortable and has handled injuries, particularly in the back seven, skillfully. \nSPECIAL TEAMS: C+. Young speedsters making a difference (kickoff returns have drastically improved), but inconsistency remains. \nCOACHING: B-. Could have made fewer offensive concessions, but did drag the team to five home wins after loss to Temple. \nOVERALL: B-. Last six weeks count more toward final grade, though.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T02:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T05:54:19.329+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
