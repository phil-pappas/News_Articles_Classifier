BolinARKANSAS NEWS BUREAU \nFAYETTEVILLE — A video surfaced late Sunday night of Arkansas coach Bret Bielema involved with and celebrating an Alabama unsportsmanlike conduct penalty from Saturday’s game. \nThe video , which appears to have been shot with a cell phone, is from the sideline perspective. \nIt shows Arkansas defensive lineman Hjalte Froholdt land a big hit on Alabama offensive lineman Cam Robinson near the Arkansas sideline directly in front of Bielema. Other Arkansas players engaged Robinson after he picked himself off the ground and Bielema stepped in front of him. Robinson makes a violent gesture Bielema’s direction and the coach stumbles backward. Immediately after that, a nearby official throws a penalty flag and Bielema celebrates with a jump, spin and yell. \nThe play happened during Santos Ramirez’s interception in the second quarter. The play resulted in Arkansas beginning its next drive at the Alabama 12 instead of the 24 and the Razorbacks scored the game’s first touchdown moments later to take a 7-3 lead. \nThe video was posted by Twitter user @Coach_Jacks. According to his bio, his real name is Anthony Jacks and he is a high school football coach in Pelham, Alabama. The source of the original video is unclear. \nAnother video , found by sports radio host Bo Mattingly, shows Bielema appear to take a direct shove from Robinson before the stumble. It also shows Bielema extend his arm against Robinson in an effort to separate him from the Arkansas players who had begun to encircle. \nBielema did not have his typical Monday availability with the media because the Razorbacks are on their bye week. Instead that press conference will come Tuesday afternoon at 5 p.m. \nAlabama won the game 27-14.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T02:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T06:01:14.254+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
