Police say a cab driver picked up Causey and another suspect in the 2400 block of Tulane Avenue and took them to the location of the crime. One of the suspects then pulled out a gun and demanded the driver's property. The driver complied, giving up about $15 in cash and the robbers fled the scene on foot.\nTwo days later, on Oct. 9 around 4:20 p.m., police stopped Causey at the intersection of Canal and Broad after observing that he matched the description of one of the suspects. During questioning, police say Causey cooperated with detectives and gave his account of the Armed Robbery. Officers then took Causey to Central Lock Up where he was booked with Armed Robbery and the unrelated charges of Theft and Possession of Marijuana.\nDetectives are investigating to determine the identity of the second suspect involved in the Armed Robbery. He was described as a clean shaven black male, about 5’9”-to-5’11” tall. He is in his mid-twenties, weighs about 170 pounds and has a low cut hairstyle with a tattoo of a cross on his face. He was wearing a white tee shirt and a pair of two tone jeans at the time of the robbery.\nAnyone with information on this incident is asked to call CRIMESTOPPERS at 504-822-1111.\nCopyright 2015 WVUE .
