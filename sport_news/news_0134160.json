This week's preview \"from the other sideline\" comes courtesy of Justin Hicks, who covers some Eastern Michigan for MLive.com.\nThe main aspects about Eastern Michigan that LSU fans probably know right now are, No. 1, the Eagles aren't very good at stopping the run, and, No. 2, they can throw the ball around a little bit. What have been among the other aspects of the team, for better or worse, that have stood out thus far this season?\n\"Basically EMU's offense can score but its defense has not done a very good job stopping anyone. Lots of missed tackles have hurt them.\"\nWith regards to the woeful run defense... Does Eastern Michigan have any realistic chance of slowing LSU running back Leonard Fournette? What is the confidence level like with the program, the fans or the media around the Eagles that the team can keep Fournette below 200 yards? 150 yards?\n\"I don't know anything about the level of confidence within the program, but I highly doubt EMU's defense will be a match for Leonard. I expect he'll have his way with them.\"\nWith regards to the passing offense... Brogan Roback seems to have performed well. What is the biggest difference between the injured starter Reginald Bell and Roback and the offense when led by each?\n\"Brogan is a little less talented in the running game, where Bell shined scrambling. Thus the offense uses the read option a little less, but he can escape when needed. I'd say they have similar arms, though Brogan obviously uses his more.\"\nQ: Which players do you think could have some success against LSU â€” particularly if any other than the primary offensive players, such as Roback, Darius Jackson, Eddie Daugherty and Dustin Creel could fair well in this specific matchup?\n\"Jackson and Shaq Vann have each had their solid games running the ball. I'm not familiar enough with LSU's run defense to know if they are vulnerable to the run, but that would probably be EMU's best bet. Otherwise, I don't know of any players that are overly dangerous or likely to burn such a quality opponent.\"\nQ: How strong of a travel contingent does Eastern Michigan figure to send, from a fans standpoint?\n\"I'm not sure how EMU is still D1 in regards to its fan base. The Eagles struggle to fill the stands at their own stadium let alone on the road.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T18:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T02:47:04.602+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
