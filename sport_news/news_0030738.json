Each of the races were set up where the runners would go around a portion of the track before heading out through a tunnel. The runners went around a dirt track before heading back through the tunnel on to the track and the finish line. JV boys As a team, the Wildcats finished fourth out of eight teams with 124 points. John Connick was third overall with a personal best time of 18:00. Carlos Cibrian was 44th with a time of 21:08.68 while Rodolfo Magana was 45th with a time of 21:09.78. Varsity boys As a team, the Wildcats finished third out of nine teams with 98 points. Individually, Alejandro Quinonez was ninth with a time of 17:16 while Seth Bullard was 12th overall with a time of 17:31. Andres Camacho was 22nd with a time of 18:07.69.Elijiah Cortez was 26th with a time of 18:38.56. Moises Ruiz was 31st with a time of 19:07.09. Varsity girls The Lady Wildcats had only three runners compete in the race and as a result did not have a team score. Individually, Jeydi Santiago had the best time among the runners by coming in 14th with a time of 23:18. Kylie Campbell followed with a time of 23:49 and 19th. Hannah Covington was 25th with a time of 24:18.62. The Wildcats are off for two weeks before returning to action Saturday, Oct. 17 when they compete in the Rebel Invitational at Hart Park.
