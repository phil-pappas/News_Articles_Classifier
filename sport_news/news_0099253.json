As reported by John Ourand of Sports Business Daily, Yahoo received 15.2 million unique viewers and 33.6 million streams for Sunday morning's game. For comparison's sake, when translating these numbers to actual viewers, it would be slightly worse than a \"Thursday Night Football\" game on CBS/NFL Network but better than a \"Monday Night Football\" game on ESPN. According to the league, an individual stream was counted if a viewer stayed and watched for more than three seconds. The 33.6 million streams far exceeded the 3.5 million that Yahoo promised to advertisers. Ourand added that as much as 33 percent of the audience (more than 5 million viewers) came from 180 international markets. And then there's this: One three-hour football game garnered about 41 percent of the online numbers garnered by a three-week college basketball tournament. \"Bills/Jags did 33.6M live streams, 7.7M hrs live video consumed. All of March Madness Live '15: 80.7M live streams, 17.8M hrs live video,\" Eric Fisher of the Sports Business Journal tweeted. Some more comparisons, via CNN: The partners did not release any data for the simultaneous number of live streams. But if they surpassed 2 million, as the data indicates, then the Bills-Jaguars game is one for the Internet record books, if not the NFL's.
