Ice water dripped off of Saul Hernandez’s tie as he stood in front of his team. Despite the celebratory laughter, the high fives and the excitement in the air, he told his players that the season was not over and that there could be more celebrations to come. But for the moment, the Dodge City boys soccer team would enjoy this one. After their 6-2 win over Great Bend to clinch the outright Western Athletic Conference title, the Red Demon players dumped the rest of the water cooler all over the first year head coach. The last time the Dodge City boys soccer team won a WAC title outright was when Hernandez himself was a player 15 years ago. \"It’s a great feeling,\" Hernandez said. \"(Returning to Dodge City) was always a dream of mine and it finally happened. I don’t know if I was expecting this in my first year. I was just hoping the boys would understand my philosophy and my way of doing things.\" Dodge City (12-1, 7-0) has been dominant in WAC play all season. It only made sense that the Red Demons put forth another strong performance to clinch the outright title. The Red Demons jumped out to a 4-0 lead before allowing two Panthers goals. Sophomore Joshua Don Juan scored his third and fourth goals of the match to put Dodge city ahead after Great Bend started to find a rhythm. \"We took our foot off of the pedal but I’m glad that we got a tough team like (Great Bend),\" Hernandez said. \"They have improved tremendously.\" Eight players celebrated senior night on Tuesday. If the Red Demons continue their strong play, it will not be their final home game of the season but with everything that Tuesday night brought, it will still be one that the players will remember. \"It’s not our last home game, but it’s our last WAC home game which to the boys, to me, and to the coaches means a lot to win (the WAC title) outright on your home field,\" senior Leonel Lopez said. \"To get announced how we did, it’s an emotion that you can’t really explain.\" Hernandez will always remember this senior class. It was a group that provided the leadership that allowed him to have a smooth transition into the new role. \"They’ve been great leaders and they’ve adjusted well,\" Hernandez said. \"They’ve fed off of my ideas and I fed off of theirs. I’m going to miss their leadership but we’ve still got them and this group of seniors can take us far.\" The Red Demons will travel to Wichita Heights this Saturday. Even though the WAC title is clinched, one of the team’s goals was to go undefeated in conference play. They will get the opportunity to check that goal off of the list when they travel to Liberal next Thursday.
