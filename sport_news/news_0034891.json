Johnny Manziel CONNECT TWEET   \nAVON, Ohio â€“ Police here confirm to WKYC that Browns quarterback Johnny Manziel was stopped just after 6 p.m. Monday while driving during an argument between him and his girlfriend, Colleen Elizabeth Crowley. \nNo charges were filed. \nWKYC received a copy of the police report Friday evening \nThe four-page police report states that alcohol was involved and that she had an abrasion on her arm but it was determined that the injury was from Manziel trying to keep her from getting out of the car while it was in motion. \nPolice stated that the couple had been drinking about 2 p.m. Monday downtown. Manziel said he had two drinks. \nAccording to the police report, a witness called police after seeing Manziel's white Nissan use the left berm of the road on I-90 westbound to pass her at high-speed. \nThe report states that both Manziel and Crowley admitted they were having an argument and Crowley threw his wallet out the window. \nThe report states the couple then stopped the car in an Avon neighborhood and continued arguing. They were seen by another person, whose home was across the street, who called police. \nMinutes later, police arrived and both were asked to step out of the car. Manziel said both he and Crowley had been drinking in downtown Cleveland earlier. \nPolice did not believe the couple was so intoxicated that they should be charged and Crowley told officers that she did not want to press charges. \nBoth left the scene in Manziel's Nissan. Crowley told police that she has been living with Manziel the past two months. \nJust before 7 p.m. Friday, the Browns' Ray Farmer released a statement on the incident involving Johnny Manziel \n\"We were aware of the situation. It is a matter that we take seriously and have expressed our concerns to Johnny directly. Those conversations will remain private and we will refrain from further comment at this time.\" <!--iframe--> Read or Share this story: http://on.wkyc.com/1RNjKR2 TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T01:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T02:05:57.413+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
