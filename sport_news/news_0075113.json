Log in and start commenting \nAfter defeat in the Capital One Cup at Norwich, back-to-back losses to Everton and Crystal Palace has led supporters to criticise Pulis’ perceived negative tactics. \nMcAuley, together with Northern Ireland team-mates Chris Brunt and Jonny Evans, has returned to the club in high spirits following his international exploits. \nThe trio played a key role in securing the country’s first qualification for a major tournament in 30 years, clinched with a 3-1 win over Greece last Thursday.
