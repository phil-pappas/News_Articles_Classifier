Cook passed for 139 yards and a touchdown while going over the 7,000-yard mark for his career but the Spartans nearly squandered a 21-point lead. \nFreshman running back Markell Jones gained a career-high 157 yards on 22 carries and scored twice, including a 68-yard touchdown run, for Purdue. \nNo. 25 Florida 38, No. 3 Mississippi 10 \nWith freshman quarterback Will Grier and a fast, hard-hitting defense sharing starring roles, the Gators thumped the Rebels in a stunning Southeastern Conference mismatch. \nFlorida established a 25-0 halftime lead as Grier threw four touchdown passes, then cruised through the second half as its defense throttled the high-scoring Ole Miss offense at almost every turn. \nGrier completed 24 of 29 passes for 271 yards for Florida, which figures to soar up the rankings after perhaps its biggest win since Urban Meyer was presiding over national titles in 2006 and 2008. \nNo. 4 TCU 50, Texas 7 \nFORT WORTH, Texas -- The Horned Frogs thoroughly dismantled the Longhorns, leaving a wide chasm between the two Big 12 rivals. \nTrevon Boykin set a new school record for career touchdown passes after throwing for five -- four going to freshman receiver KaVontae Turpin. \nTCU's senior Heisman candidate was able to pick out his targets on his way to 332 yards in three quarters of work. \nNo. 5 Baylor 63, Texas Tech 35 \nARLINGTON, Texas -- The Bears' Big 12-opener looked pretty familiar for the two-time defending conference champions. \nBears quarterback Seth Russell passed for 286 yards and four touchdowns, and running back Shock Linwood rushed for 221 yards and two TDs on 20 carries. \nTexas Tech quarterback Pat Mahomes passed for 415 yards and three touchdowns. However, he was intercepted twice, and the Red Raiders lost two fumbles. Texas Tech was also penalized 17 times for 142 yards. \nArizona State 38, No. 7 UCLA 23 \nPASADENA, Calif. -- Arizona State's energy-infused defense gave the UCLA offensive line grief. \nOn offense, the Sun Devils kept the UCLA defense off balance with a bevy of sleight of hand plays. \nThe Sun Devils jumped out to a 29-10 lead and weathered the Bruins comeback attempt. \nNo. 13 Alabama 38, No. 8 Georgia 10 \nATHENS, Ga. -- If there's any lesson to be taken from Saturday's game, it's not to bet against coach Nick Saban when the backs of his Crimson Tide are against the proverbial wall. \nJust ask the Bulldogs, who came in as a slight favorite. \nDerrick Henry led the Tide with 26 rushes for 148 yards and a touchdown. Quarterback Jake Coker turned in his most-efficient effort to date, completing 11 of 16 passes for 190 yards and accounting for two touchdowns. \nNo. 9 LSU 44, Eastern Michigan 22 \nBATON ROUGE, La. -- Leonard Fournette became the first back in SEC history to rush for at least 200 yards in three consecutive games, battering Eastern Michigan with 233 yards and three touchdowns to power the Tigers to the win. \nThe game was much closer than expected. LSU was a 45-point favorite, but led just 30-22 late in the third quarter. \nFournette ran for touchdowns of 3, 75 and 11 yards, raising his season touchdown total to 11 during LSU's 4-0 start. He raised his season total to 864 yards, an average of 216.0 a game. \nNo. 11 Florida State 24, Wake Forest 16 \nWINSTON-SALEM, N.C. -- The Seminoles' defense rose to the occasion and stiffened late in the game to secure the win. \nWake Forest moved to the Florida State 20-yard line in the final minute before Tyler Hunter intercepted a Kendall Hinton pass in the end zone with 21 seconds remaining. \nThe Seminoles survived in a game in which running back Dalvin Cook, one of the country's top rushers, had a long touchdown run before exiting in the first quarter because of a leg injury. \nNo. 14 Texas A&M 30, No. 21 Mississippi State 17 \nKyle Allen threw for 322 yards and defensive end Myles Garrett had another big game as the Aggies beat the Bulldogs. \nAllen completed 25 of 41 passes for 322 yards and two touchdowns without an interception. The Aggies rolled to 516 total yards against a Bulldogs defense that entered the game allowing an average of 349 per game. \nGarrett, a sophomore who entered the game with 6.5 sacks, made a key play in the third quarter when he forced a fumble that A&M recovered at its 3-yard line. He finished with seven tackles, including two for loss and a sack, and also broke up a pass. \nNo. 15 Oklahoma 44, No. 23 West Virginia 24 \nNORMAN, Okla. -- The Sooners came through with two big turnovers in the fourth quarter to defeat the Mountaineers. \nAfter nearly letting a big lead slip away, the Sooners finally put the game away early in the fourth quarter when Eric Striker stripped West Virginia quarterback Skyler Howard of the ball and Jordan Evans picked it up and took it 41 yards for the touchdown. \nJordan Thomas intercepted a pass on the next drive to further put the game away against the Mountaineers. \nNo. 16 Northwestern 27, Minnesota 0 \nEVANSTON, Ill. -- The Wildcats' defense recorded its second shutout in five games and kept the Golden Gophers bottled up in its own territory in a Big Ten season-opening victory. \nThe Wildcats improved to 5-0 for the first time since 2012. Unranked Minnesota failed to reach 100 yards in either rushing or passing while its three-game winning streak was snapped. \nNorthwestern quarterback Clayton Thorson was 14 of 18 for 128 yards and rushed for two touchdowns while Justin Jackson carried 20 times for 120 yards. \nIowa 10, No. 19 Wisconsin 6 \nMADISON, Wis. -- Desmond King took advantage of a mistake-prone Wisconsin offense to help the Hawkeyes pull off an upset. \nKing had two interceptions as Iowa toppled the Badgers in the teams' Big Ten opener. \nIowa's C.J. Beathard completed 9 of 21 passes for 77 yards and one touchdown. \nNo. 20 Oklahoma State 36, Kansas State 34 \nSTILLWATER, Okla. -- Ben Grogan, who kicked the tying and winning field goals in the final 1:33 the week before, pushed through a 37-yarder with 32 seconds left as the Cowboys came back to beat the Wildcats. \nKansas State had taken a 34-33 lead with 3:01 left when Joe Hubener scored on a fourth-and-3 option keeper from the 5. \nBut the Cowboys marched back down the field, putting Grogan in position to be the hero again after he connected on field goals of 41 and 40 yards in a 30-27 victory over Texas. \nNo. 22 Michigan 28, Maryland 0 \nCOLLEGE PARK, Md. -- Michigan survived a scare with a strong third quarter to overcome Maryland in the Big Ten opener for both teams. \nThe Wolverines scored the game's first two touchdowns in a span of 2:31 in the third quarter to take command and ride their strong defense to a fourth straight win. \nJourdan Lewis' interception of Caleb Rowe's pass set up the Wolverines in Maryland territory and three plays later, Michigan quarterback Jake Rudock connected with running back Drake Johnson on a 31-yard screen pass for a score. \nNo. 24 Cal 34, Washington State 28 \nBERKELEY, Calif. -- It was not quite as wild as last year's game when the two teams combined for 119 points, but this year the Bears overcame an early 21-7 deficit to beat the Cougars. \nWashington State quarterback Luke Falk was 34 of 48 for 374 yards, two touchdowns and no interceptions but was sacked seven times. \nCal quarterback Jared Goff was 33 of 45 for 390 yards, four touchdowns and one interception but was sacked three times.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T08:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T09:20:03.136+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
