Suddenly, the events of this past April -- in which Jones was involved in a late-night car collision before fleeing the scene -- were making headlines instead of the two massive light-heavyweight fights scheduled for Saturday night. \nSure, Daniel Cormier is set for his first title fight when he takes on Alexander Gustafsson. And yes, the winner of Ryan Bader’s bout against Rashad Evans should probably get the next shot at the belt. \nBut with Jones avoiding jail-time, it’s inevitable that talk surrounding the division he reigned over for four years before being stripped of his belt when he was charged will centre on the possibility of his return to the UFC. \n“It looms large for you guys,” said Cormier, pointing to the media. “I’m focused on the task at hand. I’ve said time and time again, that guy’s not on my radar. I’m trying to prepare for a tough guy Saturday night. \n“It’s funny that it worked out (with the plea deal being reached on fight week), but oh well, I’m a competitor. I will never back down from anything.” \nThe winner of Saturday night’s title fight will almost certainly defend the belt against Jones if, and when, he makes his return to the octagon. The former champion was close-to-invincible during his time with the belt, but Cormier and Gustafsson were his most heated rivals. \nEvans also enjoyed a spirited mutual-dislike with Jones, as well, and despite a two-year absence from the octagon it was widely understood -- but never confirmed -- that the winner of his fight with Bader would be in a No. 1 contender’s spot. \nThat changes if Jones returns, though, and both fighters acknowledged they had to take that reality in stride. \n“I’ll worry about that after, but right now I’m keeping my mind on Rashad,” said Bader, who is on a four-fight win streak and had a heated exchange with Cormier after the new champ beat Anthony Johnson for the belt in May. “Just like the whole Cormier situation, I let everything go and I’m focused on Rashad, and that’s it. \n“With that whole situation, we don’t know if (Jones) is coming back, how long … we know he’s coming back at some point, it’s just a matter of when.” \nWhen Jones will return is, to be fair, entirely unclear. The UFC isn’t going to instantly reinstate him, and the organization has enlisted the services of Las Vegas law firm Campbell & Williams to review the details of the case before making a decision. \nFor Cormier, though, the ‘if’ and the ‘when’ of Jones’ return don’t tell the whole story. After having his name dragged through the mud in the months since his crash, Cormier believes there’s every possibility Jones has some psychological healing to do -- just think about the way Tiger Woods never seemed to recover from his sex scandal. \n“We don’t know what he’s been doing these last few months, but if he’s been training then so be it,” said Cormier, who lost to Jones earlier this year at UFC 182. “If there was ever any doubt that I wanted to get back in the octagon with that man, please put it to rest. There’s no worry on my end. \n“I’m glad he’s back, if he’s even back. He hasn’t been reinstated yet. We’re talking as if this guy is scheduling a fight right now. We don’t know where this guy’s headspace is. \n“He’s got some things to figure out on his own. Just because he got his punishment from the justice system, we don’t know what damage this did to this kid, and if it did none, then this dude’s got some real problems.” \ndaniel.austin@sunmedia.ca", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T00:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T02:20:30.290+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
