Human rights activists say all Eritreans are forced to join the army at 17, supposedly for two years of national service, but claim many are not allowed to leave. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T10:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T10:32:30.102+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
