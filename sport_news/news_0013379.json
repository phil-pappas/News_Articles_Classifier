Royals manager Ned Yost wore a KCFD hat during his news conference while pitcher Jeremy Guthrie also wore a similar hat. The fire department provided the shirts and hats to the team.\nDuring a news conference Tuesday afternoon, Hosmer offered his thoughts and prayers to the families of Larry Leggio and John Mesh, who died when an apartment building collapsed while they battled a fire.\n\"We want them to know we have their backs 100 percent,\" Hosmer said.\nHe said Kansas City and the Royals are united behind the families and rallying around them.\n\"We are going to try and get through this as a city altogether,\" Hosmer said.\nHosmer said he grew up at a firehouse and he had planned to become a firefighter if he didn't become a professional baseball player.\nHe said firefighters are true heroes who put their lives on the line to save people from burning buildings.\nHe said his parents tried to protect him and his siblings from knowing the dangers that firefighters face.\n\"It hits really close to home for me,\" Hosmer said. \"It's nerve wracking.\"\nYost said there are a number of firefighters in his family especially on his wife's side. He said he has spent countless hours in fire stations.\n\"I think we all woke up with heavy hearts today,\" Yost said. \"It is personal I think for everybody.\"\nWednesday night, the Royals will honor Leggio and Mesh during the pre-game ceremony before the decisive Game 5 against the Houston Astros. A moment of silence will be held.\nSome fans have asked that donations be taken or the shirts worn by the players be auctioned off to benefit the families. The Royals are still working out all of the details for honoring the fallen firefighters.\nFriends of Leggio's widow said her last Facebook post before she lost her husband was about their beloved Royals' incredible rally in Game 4 against the Astros.\n\"My husband owes me a playoff game or better yet a World Series game,\" Missy Leggio wrote.\nFriends hope that the families if they choose to do so can attend Game 5 and feel the support of the Royals and their fans.\nCopyright 2015 KCTV (Meredith Corp.)
