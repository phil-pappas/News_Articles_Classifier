Then he donned a faux-gold cowboy hat handed to him by the Texas governor, while one of the Longhorns, his eyes on the big screen atop the Cotton Bowl, chanted, \"In your face! In your face!\"\nIn his press conference, after he had high-fived the first row of media members on his way to the dais, Strong said, \"That was the University of Texas. Today was our day, and that's the team.\"\nThis is the theme of a 24-17 win against No. 9 Oklahoma, shared publicly by Strong and quietly, in a more personal moment, during an embrace between the Longhorns' second-year coach and one of his players during a raucous post-game celebration. \"We did this for you,\" the player told Strong.\nUSA TODAY\nTexas dumps No. 9 Oklahoma in Charlie Strong's biggest win with Longhorns\nSaid Strong, \"We needed this. We go to Notre Dame, we don't play well. We go beat Rice and we played well. And we lose and we go last week and just looked God awful. I'm just so proud. I think they said they didn't want to see me get fired, so they were going to step up and play for me.\"\n***\nThe Longhorns did it for Strong — and for each other, and to beat a rival — but they did it as a team, with an effort that exchanged any attempts at flash for an approach rooted in simplicity. Run the football, prevent the Sooners from doing the same; protect the football, force the Sooners to be careless; win every play; do your job.\n\"The way we're going to work today, it's going to speak for itself,\" Strong said. \"We're going to run the football and we're going to run it right at 'em and we're going to knock 'em off the ball, and nothing else is going to need to be said because we're going to control the line of scrimmage.\"\nThis style is repeatable, and potentially more finely tuned after an off week in advance of a Big 12 Conference matchup with Kansas State. It's also seen best in a player, sophomore wide receiver Lorenzo Joe, who doesn't appear in the box score.\nFollow the road to the 2015 College Football Playoff at The Football Four , our home to rate and debate the nation's best. Joe was targeted once in Texas' win, on a deep heave along the left sideline perhaps designed as much to loosen up Oklahoma's defense as for a touchdown; the pass was batted away, and Joe left without adding to his year-to-date receiving total through six games — one catch, a touchdown grab in last week's ugly loss to TCU.\nYet he threw one crucial block to free up Marcus Johnson for a 24-yard touchdown in the first quarter. Another block helped pave the way for D'Onta Foreman's 81-yard run in the third quarter, the Longhorns' first gain of 80-plus yards in three seasons. When quarterback Tyrone Swoopes fumbled into the end zone on a second-quarter run — it was eventually ruled he scored before losing control — it was Joe who corralled the loose ball, ensuring an early 14-0 lead.\n\"You love to see that,\" said running back Johnathan Gray. \"That's how it starts. He does what he's supposed to do, and he does what is asked of him.\"\n***\nFrom the outside — and, at times, within the program itself — it was a week of turmoil for Texas. At halftime of last Saturday's loss, freshman cornerback Kris Boyd retweeted a comment about transferring to Texas A&M. An early-week press conference featured infighting between two factions of this roster seemingly at odds: the old guard, the juniors and seniors recruited by the Longhorns' previous coaching staff, and the underclassmen brought in since Strong's arrival nearly two years ago.\nJoe fits into the latter company, as part of a class recruited during Strong's first months on campus. This group has been blamed for the Longhorns' issues, called out by upperclassmen accustomed to a different standard. They've also been called, rightfully so, the future of Texas football. Joe hasn't made headlines, lost in the shadows behind Jerrod Heard, John Burt and Malik Jefferson, among others.\n\"He's a great energy guy,\" Foreman said. \"He comes to practice every day with a smile on his face – great energy, great tempo. And for him to get his start today, his first start, I know it felt good to him. He goes out there and wants what's best for our team. I understand that he may want some individual stats, but his mind is just on the team and winning games.\"\nJoe's ascent into the starting lineup — one week after not appearing at all on the Longhorns' depth chart — proves to underclassmen and upperclassmen alike that playing time will be dictated in a meritocracy, not on arrival date or recruiting billing. His performance, meanwhile, and the quiet impact it had on the offense, should help prove an idea: Texas has found an identity.\n\"We always tell players that you may not be playing now, but just stay the course, your opportunity's coming,\" wide receivers coach Jay Norvell said. \"I think we're going to look back on this film and there's going to be a lot of guys playing hard for four quarters. That's what we challenged them to do and it appears that's what they did today.\"\nHOW THE TOP 25 FARED IN WEEK 6\nNo. 1 Ohio State 49, Maryland 28 Greg Bartram, USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen No. 4 Baylor 66, Kansas 7 John Rieger, USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen No. 5 LSU 45, South Carolina 24 Derick E.
