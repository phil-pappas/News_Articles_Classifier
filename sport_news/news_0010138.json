It was nearly two minutes slower than his winning time of a year ago but 1:48 faster than runnerup Kyle Ziemer of St. Paul. \n\"I thought it might be a little slower this year,\" said the 55-year-old Broze. \"I was injured for awhile and had to take six weeks off from my training. \n\"I had some kind of abdominal strain that I thought might be a sports hernia but, fortunately, it wasn't that. I was able to get back into it about three weeks ago.\" \nThe head coach for the Mankato West boys cross country team said just about everything broke his way on Saturday. \n\"The weather couldn't have been any better and I had some of my runners from West here to cheer me on. (Retired MSU coach Mark) Schuck was also here to give support. He recruited me more than 30 years ago.\" \nBroze attended Golden Valley Lutheran Community College for two years after high school and then finished up at St. Thomas in 1982. Broze was an excellent distance man back in the day, getting his times down around 2:15 for full marathons. \n\"I was invited to the Olympic Trials and that was pretty neat,\" he said. \"But now I'm a lot older and the 5K is the race I like the most. The recovery time is a lot easier.\" \nUnlike Broze, Barnhardt was donning a gold medal for the first time on Saturday. She has run the Mankato Marathon 5K before, and has won her age group, but this was the first time the 44-year-old was the overall female winner. \n\"I wasn't thinking about winning,\" Barnhardt said. \"I just wanted to do my best. \nThe North Mankato resident came in with atime of 22:46. She said she was hoping to get into the 21-minute range but wasn't complaining. \n\"Anytime you go under 23 minutes, that's pretty good,\" she said. \"It was a great day to run.\" \nBarnhardt got into running in 2009 after she saw her niece complete a race. The niece was quaffing down a few beverages afterward and that caused Barnhardt to start thinking. \n\"I'm a pretty competitive person and I said to myself: 'I can do that'. That's when I started.\" \nBarnhardt used the 5K as a tuneup for the half marathon she will be running on Sunday. \n\"I won't do nearly as well in that,\" she said. \"But I'll give it my best.\" Sign Up / Sign In With your existing account from... {* loginWidget *}", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T06:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T10:39:41.839+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
