Here are some highlights.\nWhat do you make of the healthy scratches on defense so far this season? I wonder if Lindy Ruff will do something like a rotation for the healthy scratches; Benn one day, someone else the next.\nHeika: \"My impression is he wants to stick with six guys and let them build chemistry. He said he will judge each player each game, but I think he wants to be patient. He might use Nemeth and Oleksiak against bigger teams, but I would be surprised if he makes any changes on defense in Tuesday's game.\"\nDo you see or hear anything about Jamie Oleksiak getting traded yet?\nHeika: \"I think Jim Nill wants to be patient. He needs info on Alex Goligoski, Jason Demers and Jordie Benn. He needs information on Oleksiak, Patrik Nemeth and Jyrki Jokipakka. He needs information on Stephen Johns, Esa Lindell, Julius Honka, Ludwig Bystrom and Mattias Backman. The only way to get that information is to let them play games - maybe 20-30 games. When he has more information, he can make better decisions down the road. Plus, opposing teams might have more intense needs by that time.\"\nHas Oleksiak made the roster by \"default\" this year? Or was it waiver/trade avoidance? What's your projection for his season?\nHeika: \"They would love him to be in the minors gaining experience, but he would get snapped up on waivers, so yes he is in the NHL \"by default.\" They are trying to be patient (20-30 games) and see how this defense shakes out. The GM lets the coach make the calls, and then he assesses based on what he sees.\"\nWhat's the real story behind Patrik Nemeth's fall from grace prior to this season? We were so high on him as a stay-at-home D-man and now he can't break.\nHeika: \"I'm not sure. I like him a lot. I would have him in every game. However, there was a competition with Oleksiak, Jokipakka and Jordie Benn, and he did not respond well. I think he looked nervous out there, and I know he took a few ill-advised penalties in preseason. So now he's a player playing nervous, maybe thinking he can't make even one mistake, and I think that shows in his on-ice demeanor. It's a hard place to be, but he has to work himself out of it. In watching him in the AHL and NHL, I believe he has the ability to be a top four defender. But I'm not the coach.\"\nIt looked like the Stars in Colorado could have used a dose of what Nemeth brings. I know Jokipakka has earned his spot, but I have to say I'm a little shocked Nemeth hasn't dressed. Did he have a poor camp?\nHeika: \"He did not perform well in preseason games. Jyrki Jokipakka and Jordie Benn won their ice time. But, you're right, there are times this team needs more size back there.\"\nHow has Johnny Oduya looked so far?\nHeika: \"I like him. He's just different than what the Stars have had in the past. He wants to defend first. I'd like to see him on a pair with John Klingberg.I think that could be a good No. 1 pairing.\"\nWhy is John Klingberg paired with Alex Goligoski ? Wouldn't it make more sense to pair these these playmaking defensemen with a stay at home specialist like Oduya?\nHeika: \"I would play Klingberg with Oduya. I have said for a few weeks that pairing makes the most sense to me.\"\nWhy does it seem like Val Nichushkin only has success when playing with 91 & 14? Going back a couple years, obviously. it seems like his play has fallen flat when playing with other lines. Are our expectations inflated with Val?\nHeika: \"He has been through a lot, and he's trying to get up to speed. It's a tough decision. Do you play him on the top line to get his game going? Or, do you make him earn his way up to that line by improving his play? That's a tough call.\"\nDo you think the organization is starting to have doubts about Val or do you think they know they'll have to be patient?\nHeika: \"He's 20 and has only played 80-something games. I think they will have plenty of patience.\"\nSo Val gets two games before he is dropped to the fourth line/scratch?\nHeika: \"Well, two games and a whole preseason. This team is under pressure to win, so you are going to see decisions that are a little more harsh. It's a business of winning, and this team needs to win now.\"\nAre the Stars big enough for the Wesern Conference? In the corners, or after the whistle, it seems like this team is not able to create an imposing physical presence. Has Val noticed the 'hit me' sign in his back, yet?\nHeika: \"They are in transition to a bigger lineup. The forwards and defensemen in the AHL are bigger, and the NHL roster will be bigger in a year or two.\"\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FULL CHAT.\nOn Twitter:\n @MikeHeika", "external_links": ["http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/dallas-stars/chats/2015/10/05/mike-heika-answers-stars-questions-2-pm-monday-oct-12-ask-questions-now", "https://twitter.com/MikeHeika"], "published": "2015-10-13T03:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T11:10:25.045+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
