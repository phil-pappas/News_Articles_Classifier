After each of those years ended with the Clippers bowing out in the first two rounds of the playoffs, they had excuses for why it happened.\nIn 2012, it was the inexperience. In that first season with Paul, the Clippers were dismantled by the Spurs in the second round, but it was a new core and they appeared headed in the right direction.\nIn 2013, it was the coach. The Grizzlies beat the Clippers in six games in the first round. And though they also had the alibi of Blake Griffin being sidelined with an ankle injury for part of that series, they made Vinny Del Negro the scapegoat and replaced him with Doc Rivers, luring him from Boston by promising him complete control of the franchise.\nIn 2014, the refs. The Clippers were dispatched by the Thunder in six games, but pointed to a questionable call in the final minute of Game 5 in Oklahoma City they said decided the game (conveniently ignoring they collapsed, giving up a seven-point lead with a minute to go) and helped swing the series.\nChris Paul Photo: NBAE via Getty Images Last year, injuries. The Clippers survived a brutal seven-game series against the Spurs in the opening round, but had Chris Paul nursing a injured hamstring at the start of the Western Conference semis – though that doesn’t explain how the Rockets were able to make up a 19-point second-half deficit in Game 6 to extend the series.\nThe time for excuses for the Clippers has come to an end. After Rivers and Co. found a way this offseason to keep DeAndre Jordan from leaving to go to Dallas – a move that would’ve ended the Clippers as a title contender – and to revamp the team’s bench, which was its biggest weakness last season, there is only one acceptable result: to reach the final four.\nIf not, as Rivers told Grantland recently, it could be time for big changes in Lob City .\nThe Clippers have just about everything you could hope for in a team. Though Paul is getting older, he’s still an excellent player, and Griffin is fully entering his prime as one of the more unique and devastating offensive players in the league. Jordan, while an overrated defender, is an intimidating presence at the rim and a vastly underrated offensive player running pick-and-rolls with Paul. J.J. Redick is a terrific shooter and a more-than-credible defender.\nDoc Rivers Photo: AFP/Getty Images The problem with the Clippers last season was they had virtually no one else. The bench featured several retreads who simply shouldn’t have been playing crucial playoff minutes for a championship contender.\nThat isn’t the case anymore, having added Paul Pierce, Josh Smith and Pablo Prigioni to bring stability to the second unit. Even the acquisition of Lance Stephenson – after a truly terrible season with the Hornets – was a savvy move by Rivers, moving on from their own failed experiment in Spencer Hawes in the process. Stephenson has the ability to be the kind of dynamic wing presence, specifically on defense, the Clippers have lacked in this era.\nThat only underscores the all-or-nothing nature of this season in Los Angeles. The Lakers are clearly in rebuilding mode, leaving an opening for the Clippers to finally carve out a significant niche in the city. The Clippers are right there with the Warriors, Spurs, Thunder, Rockets and Grizzlies among teams at the top of the Western Conference with a legitimate title shot.\nThe difference is that all five of those teams have made it at least to the Western Conference Finals the past few seasons – and all but the Warriors, the defending champions, have beaten the Clippers in the process. With their re-tooled roster in place, there won’t be any more excuses if that doesn’t change.\n  Filed under blake griffin ,  chris paul ,  deandre jordan ,  doc rivers ,  j.j. redick ,  lance stephenson ,  los angeles clippers ,  nba ,  paul pierce", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T20:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T00:43:28.772+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
