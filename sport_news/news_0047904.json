Oscar Pistorius' battle over sentence drags on \nThe Mustangs were banned from postseason play for one year and Brown was suspended for nine games during the 2015-16 season. Brown also received a lack of coach control charge as the NCAA discovered academic fraud and unethical conduct. \nMuch of the investigation centered around coursework that led to guard Keith Frazier becoming eligible to play for the Mustangs. Frazier said he was unaware that a former administrative assistant was doing online coursework on his behalf. \n\"The fact that NCAA violations happened on my watch is something that I regret and take very seriously,\" Brown said in a statement. \"I am committed to winning with integrity and we must - and we will - do better. While the decision to not appeal our postseason ban was made in the best interests of the program, I am truly disappointed for our student-athletes who are the most impacted by the penalties and who had nothing to do with the infractions. Our young men need your support now more than ever, and I am confident that the Mustang family will respond.\" \nSMU is appealing the heavy loss of scholarships - nine over a three-year period.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T01:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T02:00:19.133+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
