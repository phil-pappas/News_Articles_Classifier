The docks in the Indian River around The Moorings continue to hold some nice trout and redfish. There are big jacks moving in and out of the river and along area beaches. There are also more and more glass minnows moving in the waters off the beach, which should continue to bring more Spanish mackerel and bluefish into the area. \nSt. Lucie County \nCapt. Tim Simos, of Bluewater Inshore Guide Service, reported a mix of glass minnows and mullet, along with a mix of sharks, tarpon and jacks off the beaches Sunday morning. There continue to be snook and redfish caught off the south jetty of the Fort Pierce Inlet and in the Turning Basin. Overall, the bite in the Indian River continues to be good, with a few nice trout, snook, redfish, snapper and bluefish being caught along the docks lining the river. Look for bluefish and jacks following the bait schools. \nMartin County \nThere is still a lot of bait along the west side of the Indian River in the Jensen Beach area, reports Paul Sperco, of Bass Pro Shop in Port St. Lucie. Snook, ladyfish, jack crevalle, bluefish and Spanish mackerel have all been crashing the mullet schools. Sperco said the most productive artificial lure is a silver spoon, but most natural-looking, artificial baits will entice a strike this time of year. There is increasing water clarity on the beach with a wide variety of action being reported. \nLake Okeechobee \nBites on the lake are starting to spread out because of rising water levels, reports Capt. Mike Shellen. Some of the bass are on the outside edges chasing the bait, while other bass are back in the grass. The early morning spinner bait bite is good. The Gambler Big EZ in a shad pattern will work as the sun gets higher. Shellen recommends working deeper as the sun rises, using a swim jig or weighted Senko. \nTo file a report: Contact Ed Killer at ed.killer@tcpalm.com, call 772-221-4201, text at 772-285-1666 and follow him on Twitter @TCPalmEKiller.
