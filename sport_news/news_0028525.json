WEXLER/STAFF PHOTOGRAPHER Eli Manning, directing traffic on Sunday, broke Phil Simms’ team records for yards and completions in a game. Eli Manning had just departed a jubilant locker room and arrived in the postgame interview room late Sunday night when Giants officials announced a change of plans.\nOdell Beckham Jr. also was initially slated to speak with the media there, but now he would talk at his locker. The unexpected scheduling tweak sent about a dozen reporters scrambling out of the room as Manning approached the microphones on the lectern.\n\"Everybody leaves,\" the Giants quarterback deadpanned while cracking a smile after throwing the game-winning touchdown pass to tight end Larry Donnell with 21 seconds left in the 30-27 victory over the 49ers. \"Go see Odell. Check on him.\"\nThere were some laughs at Manning’s joke — not at his expense — but that was not the case three weeks ago. Back then, the two-time Super Bowl MVP was depicted in a New York tabloid in a dunce cap as the Giants lost their first two games in historically bad fashion, becoming the first team in NFL history to cough up double-digit fourth-quarter leads in consecutive losses to open the season.\nOn this night, those inside MetLife Stadium and the millions watching at home on national television were treated to vintage Manning in a final-minute comeback that Tom Coughlin suggested shouldn’t take a back seat to any of his previous 26 in the regular season.\nMany of Manning’s teammates were in college or high school when fourth-quarter rallies established his legacy as one of the league’s best performers under pressure, no matter the stakes or size of the stage.\n\"That was fun to watch out there,\" Giants defensive end Kerry Wynn said. \"The Super Bowls, remember watching him and them on TV, but to be part of it, to see him do something like this live, man that was really fun.\"\nThe 49ers had all of the momentum when Carlos Hyde scored from 2 yards out, giving the road team a 27-23 lead with 1:41 left.\nThe last time Manning led a comeback win in the final two minutes was Oct. 21, 2012, when he threw a winning 75-yard touchdown pass to Victor Cruz against the Redskins.\nThis time, he walked onto the field with Dwayne Harris, rookie Geremy Davis and Myles White – promoted from the practice squad last week – as his wide receivers.\nBeckham and Rueben Randle were on the sideline, each with hamstring issues, and Cruz has yet to play this season because of a calf strain.\nWhat did Giants left guard Justin Pugh see when Manning stepped into the huddle?\n\"Confident people,\" he said. \"I looked at someone and he looked me right back in the eye. When you see that, you know that guy is going to make a play.\"\nHe later added: \"And you know when you have Eli Manning back there, he’s going to make plays for you.\"\nAs Tom Brady did in Super Bowl XLIX, Manning turned to running back Shane Vereen, who caught three passes for 51 yards on the final drive. Beckham also returned to the game, drawing a pivotal pass interference penalty that set up Manning’s final strike to Donnell – a laser into double coverage that only his guy could make a play on.\n\"[Eli’s] the type of guy,\" Coughlin told Tony Dungy during NBC’s \"Sunday Night Football\" pregame show, \"that the more difficult the challenge, the better he responds.\"\nThe last time the Giants were alone in first place in the NFC East this late in the season was heading into Week 15 of 2012 before their 34-0 loss in Atlanta.\nThe Giants again will bring a three-game winning streak to Philadelphia, as they did last season when they lost Cruz to a devastating knee injury, and the game in ugly fashion with a crushing 27-0 defeat at Lincoln Financial Field.\nManning threw for three touchdowns and 441 yards against San Francisco.\nHis 41 completions broke Phil Simms’ franchise record, as did his 102nd career victory.\nSaid Vereen: \"This shows we’ve got a better quarterback than a lot of people think.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T04:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T18:31:24.489+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
