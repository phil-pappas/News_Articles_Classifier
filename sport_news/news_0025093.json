The Bears rolled up 404 yards of total offense and held the Hawks to 112 yards of offense. \n“No excuses. We didn’t play the kind of football we needed to tonight to challenge BGM, which has a very good football team,” Hawk head coach Mike Parkinson said after the Hawks lost 44-0 at BGM in Class A District 7 action. \n“We couldn’t run the ball, but our passing game continues to develop. We just have to get healthy and come back and play Friday night at home,” Parkinson said. \nLynnville-Sully is battling through injuries. Senior running back Sage Ehresman and senior receiver and kicker Noah Engle were sidelined for the game. Both are among the top defensive players for the Hawks also. \nParkinson said the Hawks weren’t looking for excuses to explain the loss. He said he was pleased with the way his team responded against BGM. \nThe Bears piled up 16 points in the first quarter on two touchdowns and a safety. Lynnville-Sully trailed 23-0 at halftime. BGM scored 14 points in the third quarter and had another touchdown in the fourth period. \nJunior quarterback Tyler Van Zante completed 10 passes out of 26 attempts for 153 yards. Kobe Fisk, a senior, made three catches for 83 yards and junior Caden Dunsbergen had six receptions for 68 yards. Dylan Roozeboom, another junior, had one catch for two yards. \n“Tyler had a strong game for us passing the ball.” Parkinson said. “We made a strong drive to their 5-yard line but stalled because we struggled to run the ball. We have to get back to playing more physical football.” \nBGM (6-0, 4-0 district) held the Hawks to minus 41 yards in rushing. Quentin Thompson punted five times for 122 yards for Lynnville-Sully. \nParkinson said they felt the Hawks were doing some things well in the first half defensively. He said a few plays got away from them. \nRyan Hofer led the Hawk defense with 10 tackles while Roozeboom had seven tackles. Carson Dunsbergen had five tackles. Jesse Van Wyk had a quarterback sack and three tackles. \nThe Bears got 190 yards on 33 carries from senior running back Colton Massengale, who scored four touchdowns. Senior quarterback Tanner Jansen was 9-of-16 for 182 yards and two touchdown passes to junior Jayce Knight. \nLynnville-Sully (3-3, 2-2 district) hosts GMG (1-5, 0-4) in district play Friday at Sully. \nContact Jocelyn Sheets at 641-792-3121 ext. 6535 or jsheets@newtondailynews.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T19:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T09:58:00.600+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
