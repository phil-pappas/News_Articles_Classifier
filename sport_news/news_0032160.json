(AP Photo/Rick Osentoski) \nMatthew Stafford got benched in the second half on Sunday after throwing his third interception and seeing his team fall behind, 35-7, to the Arizona Cardinals. \nIt’s been a terrible year for Stafford. According to ESPN’s QBR rating, which values quarterback on all play types on a 0-to-100 scale, he is the 26th best passer in the game, worth 0.2 points over the league’s average starting quarterback . \nThe game charters at Pro Football Focus have him rated as the third worst, behind Andrew Luck and Colin Kaepernick . \nUnder pressure, Stafford’s passer rating drops from 91.5 to 57.4, and it is hard to fault the offensive line for those woes, who are rated as the sixth best pass-protection unit by Football Outsiders . Instead, it appears Stafford is struggling in the pocket. \nOn passes in which he delivers the ball in 2.5 seconds or less, he has a 89.1 rating. That drops to 54.4 when he holds on to the ball 2.6 seconds or more . \nBut that’s surely not bad enough for fans to cheer for backup quarterback Dan Orlovsky. Big cheers for Dan Orlovsky as he trots out onto the field to be the #Lions QB. \n— Michael Rothstein (@mikerothstein) October 11, 2015 \nOrlovsky hasn’t seen steady work since 2011 and threw his last pass in 2012. I may live to eat these words but what in the world is benching Matthew Stafford this early going to accomplish? \n— Mike Garafolo (@MikeGarafolo) October 11, 2015 \nThe bigger problem is how poorly the offensive line blocks for their rushers. It allows the running backs to get stuffed behind the line of scrimmage 32 percent of the time (third worst in league) and have the worst average of second-level yards (0.73), average yards earned per carry between 5 to 10 yards past the line of scrimmage. \nIf this Lions team doesn’t get the running game on track, not even Orlovsky can save them.
