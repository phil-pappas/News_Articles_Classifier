No one was in the house at the time of the fire. \n\"We have recovered evidence that points to suspicion,\" Brooks said without elaborating. \"We are conducting a thorough investigation and we are planning on calling in the state fire marshal's office because we would like to have an accelerate-sniffing canine to go over the scene. Right now, it's just too hot.\" \nThe Manziel family issued a statement that read: \"We are blessed no one was inside the house and everyone is safe.\" Comment section guidelines The below comment section contains thoughts and opinions from users that in no way represent the views of the Las Vegas Review-Journal or GateHouse Media.
