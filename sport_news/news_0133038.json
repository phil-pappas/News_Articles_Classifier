They rebounded to beat the Rangers three straight to win the ALDS and have five chances to win four and advance to the World Series for the first time since 1993.\nThe Royals are two wins away from returning to the World Series for the second straight year. They took the Giants to seven games in last season’s Series and lost.\nBen Zobrist’s bloop single to right field leading off the seventh that was botched by second baseman Ryan Goins and right fielder Jose Bautista who failed to catch it gave the crowd hope that increased when Lorenzo Cain singled sharply to right.\nEric Hosmer delivered an RBI single to center that scored Zobrist and sent Hosmer to third.\nWith runners at the corners, Kendrys Morales’ grounder up the middle was caught by shortstop Troy Tulowitzki and turned into an out at first as Cain scored and Hosmer went to second.\nWith the Blue Jays’ lead whittled to 3-2, Price faced the left-handed hitting Mike Moustakas with one out and the potential tying run on second. Moustakas’ single to right plated Hosmer to tie the score, 3-3, and he took second on Jose Bautista’s off-line throw to the plate. The hit stopped a 0-for-13 hitless slide for Moustakas.\nAt 80 pitches, Price started working on Salvador Perez and caught him looking at a 3-2 pitch for the second out. That brought the left-handed hitting Alex Gordon to the plate. His 0-for-2 lowered the lifetime average against Price to .186 (3-for-16) but was raised with a double to right-center that scored Moustakas for a 4-3 lead.\nGordon was the final batter Price faced, replaced by Aaron Sanchez who gave up an RBI single to Alex Rios that upped the lead to 5-3.\nThe immediate reason Price was imported from Detroit at the trade deadline to Toronto was so the Blue Jays could get past the Yankees and win the AL East.\nBeyond that the Blue Jays believed the large lefty would provide them an ace if they got to the postseason regardless of a poor post-season résumé.\nPrice filled the bill in the first department delivered in the second category through six innings Saturday.\nMillions of words have been written and spoken about Price’s miserable post-season statistics and had painted a Cy Young-like season as secondary. However, Blue Jays manager John Gibbons didn’t buy the noise.\n“I don’t give a thought what he’s done in the postseason,’’ Gibbons said. “I’ve seen him. He’s been a key guy getting us here. I look forward to every time he’s taking the mound.’’\nWith the usually potent Blue Jays offense not producing slow-pitch softball numbers for the second straight game it was up to Price to get the visitors even and he didn’t.\nIn 6 ²/₃ innings, Price allowed five runs and six hits. In 13 post-season games (seven starts) the free agent-to- be is 2-7 with a hefty 5.24 ERA.\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google Whatsapp Email Filed under alcs ,  kansas city royals ,  mlb playoffs ,  toronto blue jays", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T22:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T05:54:42.983+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
