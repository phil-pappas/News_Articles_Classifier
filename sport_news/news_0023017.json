(AP) - A Pennsylvania college football player is charged with stabbing a teammate with a corkscrew during a fight at a dormitory. The Reading Eagle reports 18-year-old Albright College freshman Marquis Stewart, of Bethlehem, was arrested after the stabbing early Sunday in Crowell Hall. He is jailed on attempted homicide and other charges. The victim was another freshman football player, 18-year-old Dhameer Madison, of New Castle, Delaware. He was taken to a hospital, where he was listed in stable condition. It was unclear what led to the fight. But police say Madison punched Stewart, who then grabbed a multi-tool device and used the corkscrew portion to stab Madison three times in the left rib cage. A school spokesman says Stewart is suspended. Online court records don't list an attorney for him. (Copyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
