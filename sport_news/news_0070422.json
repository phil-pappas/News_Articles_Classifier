I knew Sproles and Mathews, two great guys. I knew this offense - a lot of guys touch the ball. That's how they make a lot of plays. It's about executing plays.\"\nThe Eagles totaled only 18 rushes Sunday. Matthews rushed five times for 20 yards, Sproles four times for 17 yards, and Sam Bradford once for 14 yards. \nMurray said earlier in the week that running backs like to \"lather up,\" which was his way of saying a rusher can get into a rhythm with multiple carries. He has not been able to do that yet this season. He had no fewer than 19 carries in a game last season, and he's had no more than 13 carries in a game this season. \nMurray said he doesn't plan to raise the issue with the coaching staff. He said they just need to watch film and \"get better\" - and he included himself in that pledge. \n\"We've got a lot of season left,\" Murray said. \"We just need to find ways to get different guys the ball.\" \nMurray missed the Eagles' Week 3 win with a hamstring injury. He was questionable for Sunday's game, but was able to play. Murray did not start - Mathews and Sproles were on the field for the first play - but he entered the game on the opening drive. \nMurray's first carry went for 30 yards, his long this season. He entered the game with only 11 yards on 21 carries. \n\"I was feeling good, and I thought the line blocked well, and the receivers blocked well downfield,\" Murray said. \"I saw a crease, and I hit it.\" \nMurray said the offense has enough opportunities, but they need to execute the plays. He said \"it's not all bad,\" but there were plays and drives in which the team \"shot ourselves in the foot.\" Murray did not want to place blame elsewhere for the offensive problems. \n\"Every guy has to look in the mirror and take accountability for their actions,\" Murray said. \"I'm the first to do it at all times.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T08:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T09:04:32.169+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
