The Chandigarh golfer was two clear at the top at 15-under-195. Udayan Mane of Bengaluru hung on to second place at 13-under-197 after firing a 67 on day three. Sujjan Singh, also from Chandigarh, fired a hole-in-one on the 11th during his round of 65 that propelled him to third place at 12-under-198.\nChadha (62-65-68), who led by three shots at the start of the day, had a quiet front-nine as he three-putted for bogey on the seventh before pulling it back with an up and down for birdie on the eighth. He seemed to be losing ground when he failed to recover from the bunker on the 11th and conceded another bogey. But then he hit form on the par-5s, by making birdies on the 14th, 17th and 18th.\n\"I didn't feel I was at my best today,\" Chadha conceded. \"My ball-striking was not as good as the first two days. But like round two, I once again scored birdies on all the four par-5s. If I play to my potential tomorrow, everyone will find it hard to catch up with me. It's a great opportunity for me to finally get another title against my name.\"\nRookie Mane (61-69-67), who was overnight joint second, mixed five birdies with two bogeys on day three to keep his second place. Mane landed it within a foot on both the third and 16th for his most impressive birdies of the day. However, unlike Chadha, he couldn't make the par-5s count.\n\"I also struggled with my long-irons,\" Mane said. \"I need to improve in these areas to create chances for myself in the final round.\"\nSujjan (66-67-65) produced a magical hole-in-one on the 11th en route his round of 65 to be one shot behind Mane in third place. He also secured birdies on the 14th, 17th and 18th with chip-putts on the first two and a tap-in after a missed eagle chance from 12 feet on the closing hole. Sujjan, a multiple winner on the PGTI and a winner on the Asian Development Tour, moved up one place from his overnight tied fourth as a result of his brilliant third round effort.\nKolkata's Shankar Das, lying overnight tied second, slipped to joint fourth at 11-under-199 after a round of 69 on Thursday. Delhi's Shamim Khan posted a 64 in round three to share fourth place with Shankar. Bengaluru golfer Khalin Joshi and Om Prakash Chouhan of Mhow were a further two shots back in tied sixth.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T12:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T01:51:53.733+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
