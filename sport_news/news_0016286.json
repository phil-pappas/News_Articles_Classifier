When the Bears take the field two years from now, they will have players who have seen significant varsity playing time as underclassmen — McCormic Banks, Dominic Esquivel, Dawson Robles, Jared Brick, Tres Machado, and the newest sophomore call up, Luke Fulkerson — are being molded as the foundation of the program for years to come. “The future is bright,” said Summerville head coach Sean Leveroos Thursday after practice. However, that is then. At this moment, the Bears are concerned with this season and facing the Argonaut Mustangs tonight in Jackson in an effort to get back into the win column. Head coach Sean Leveroos informed his team Thursday after practice that they have a chance to make history. The history that he was referring to was being the first Summerville team to win a playoff game away from Thorsted Field. To make that happen, they must win their next three games. The Bears have not won in their road white jerseys this season, and the six underclassmen are being looked at to help push Summerville towards the playoffs. Summerville (3-4, 1-2 MLL) has a program wide practice. Throughout the practice day, a freshman player could be lined up against a senior. Freshmen receivers are catching passes from senior quarterback Travis Rodgers. Sophomore linebackers are trying to tackle the powerful Nathaniel Ulvevadet. JV linemen are learning how to block first-hand from Kole Elkins. Program wide competition helps the coaching staff see who could be potential players to be called up to the varsity roster. “We love program wide for the ability to put all 15 of our coaches, when we include our strength program, to collaboratively kick the ideas around of, is x-y-z ready to help us here and there,” Leveroos said. “So for the evaluation process, we love it. And for the simple fact that they are hearing the same terminology, the same language, going through the same drills, makes it pretty user friendly to jump from one system to the next.” The first sophomore to be called up to the varsity roster was Banks. The 6-3, 225-pound tight end and defensive lineman was on the opening day roster and contributed until his week three injury at Bradshaw Christian. Banks missed the next three games and returned last week against Sonora. “I really wanted to participate with the older guys because I really wanted to challenge myself,” Banks said of joining the varsity team as a sophomore. “I was glad that I could play last week against Sonora, but I don't think I was fully 100-percent. I tried my hardest. Argonaut is a hard hitting team and they think that they are a good team. I can't wait to play them.” In week two, Leveroos and the rest of the Summerville coaching staff decided to bring three more players up from the jv team to joining the varsity. Robles, Esquivel and Brick made the jump and made an immediate impact. Against Bradshaw Christian, Esquivel filled in for an injured Jake Fulkerson at halfback and rushed for nearly 100 yards and had two second half touchdowns. In the homecoming game against Amador, Esquivel, who lined up at safety, was the hardest hitter on the field. Robles has started at cornerback since being called up to the varsity, and had a momentum changing interception against Hughson in week four. He has two total interceptions and averages nearly six tackles a game. Following the loss last week against Sonora, Bears coach Mike Oliva felt Robles played his best game of the season, ending his night with six solo tackles. Brick was thrust into a starting linebacker role, alongside team leader Ulvevadet. He suffered a hurt hamstring last week against Sonora and will miss tonight's game against Argonaut. He should be cleared to play next Friday at home against Calaveras. Last week, the Bears made a move that has not been done in many, many years at Summerville. They brought a freshmen up to play varsity. Machado turned 15 last week, and for a birthday present, he was given a starting role on the defensive line. It is much different calling up a young lineman rather than a ball carrier. “I have to remind myself not to think about that because I would get nervous and it would cause me to play worse,” Machado said. “I was for super nervous being called up and honestly, I thought it would be a lot harder. I'm glad that I've got great teammates that support me through all this and help coach me.” The Summerville coaching staff earlier this week called up perhaps the most exciting player from the JV in Luke Fulkerson. With injuries at running back, most notably to his older brother, Jake (who re-injured his surgically repaired knee), Leveroos felt that the time was now to bring him up. “Luke Fulkerson was ready weeks ago, but we left him down there to allow the JV team to feel that they were still able to compete for their championship and were able to take care of business below,” Leveroos said. “As we witnessed the twos and threes around Luke get better, and the fact that we got dinged again last week to the running back position, it just made sense.” Luke Fulkerson is not the same player as his older brother. But he's close. Like Jake, Luke has the ability to make one man miss and go the length of the field for a score. That is something that has been missing since Jake went down three weeks ago. Though he knows he’s not his brother, Luke possesses something that Jake does not. “I have two good knees,” Luke said with a smile that only a little brother can have. “I'm not as strong or as fast or as smart, but I play just as hard as him. And, because we are brothers, I wanna be better than him.” Having Luke Fulkerson line up as a halfback, also puts Ulvevadet back at his more comfortable position at fullback. Any time the coaches bring a player up to the varsity, it’s because they are ready to help and will be a starter. But Leveroos never truly knows what he has in a player until the chips are down and the game is being played. “Seeing them practice with our own varsity kids, we knew that physically they could do it,” Leveroos said. “It's not until they get under the Friday night lights to know if mentally they are able to do it. It's, can they bring their talents that they have been showing Monday through Thursday practices to Friday nights.” Follow UnionDemocrat.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T11:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T08:18:19.965+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
