If we win the last two games, we win the league and get in the playoffs.” \nOne of the area’s top runners with 773 yards, Keevon Harris, was held to 58 yards on 20 attempts for LaBrae (6-2, 4-1). \nOf holding Harris, Clark said, “Our defensive ends and linebackers played a helluva game. “We couldn’t let them bounce outside or get a seam,” he said of clamping down on LaBrae’s perimeter threat. \nThose individuals were ends Zach Hackett and Luke Bender and linebackers David Swope and Zach Hosick. \n“This is a big game, it’s a league thing and it’s a point thing,” Randy Clark said of the playoff implications. “They were scrappy, but we had to be just as scrappy, if not more.” \nThe thinning of the ranks, especially Brookfield’s, was characteristic of the teams’ hard-nosed reputations. \nBrookfield led in total yards, 298-230. \nLaBrae coach John Armeni marveled at Necastro’s 194 rushing yards. \n“If you would have told me before the game that he’d thrown for under 100 yards, then I would have said that we’d blow them out of the water. That shows you how versatile he is and how good of a football player he is.” \nArmeni said that Brookfield’s coach Clark joked before the game that they’d contain Harris. \n“He said what they were going to do and they did a fabulous job,” Armeni said. “We had to allow some other guys to make some plays, but we came up short.” \nThe Vikings scored first, then were shut out until the last few seconds. \n“I’m surprised that we had so much success early, then a lack thereof from that point forward,” Armeni said. “Their guys hit our guys in the mouth, and our guys kept fighting until the end, but we just didn’t make enough plays. It just comes down to ‘can you make plays when you need to?’ They did and we didn’t.” \nArmeni was quite complimentary of Brookfield’s quarterback. \n“That Necastro is a special kid and that was the difference-maker. They put a lot on his back down the stretch and he made play after play and we had trouble doing that.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T07:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T13:20:55.553+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
