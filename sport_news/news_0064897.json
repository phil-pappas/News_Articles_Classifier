He also added three catches for 99 yards and another touchdown. \nGratz (6-2, 6-0) sits comfortably atop the division after knocking off the second-place Lancers (4-4, 4-2). \n\"It was important,\" Lewis said. \"They're in our division. They were in second place and we were in first. We had a lot of people not playing so we knew this game was important and we had to put them away.\" \nInjuries and academic issues sidelined a few players for Gratz. The result was a disjointed performance fraught with sloppy play and turnovers by both teams. \nCentral lost all three of its fumbles in the second quarter. Gratz finished the game with a pair of fumbles. \nDespite the miscues, Lewis remained focused. His 55-yard receiving touchdown in the third quarter came after sophomore quarterback Amir Gillis first dropped the snap. \nGillis scooped the ball, scrambled left and hit a wide open Lewis, who blazed down the left sideline this time with both size-11s on his feet. \n\"I just couldn't give up on plays,\" Lewis said. \"I just had to keep my mind in it because I knew how important this game was.\" \nSimon Gratz 7 21 6 0 - 34 \nCentral 0 0 0 6 - 6 \nG: Luke White 22 pass from Amir Gillis (Amir Gillis kick) \nG: Kenneth Bennett 27 pass from Gillis (Gillis kick) \nG: Amir Lewis 27 run (Gillis kick) \nG: White 28 run (Gillis kick) \nG Lewis 55 pass from Gillis (kick failed) \nC: Blake Schwartz 4 run (kick failed)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T03:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T03:53:08.627+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
