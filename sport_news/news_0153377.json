The Fighting Clan lost a key cog in their offensive line last week, as sophomore tackle Noah Sansalone suffered a right leg injury, which will sideline him for unknown amount of time. Chestnut and Ardahan are battling it out during practice this week to take over his position. Whoever wins, along with Avila-Polaha on the other side, will have his hands full against Tapp and Carey. The two have combined for four sacks this season — Vineland has allowed nine in three games. The Fighting Clan need to keep Tapp and Carey out of the backfield to come away with the victory. Vineland pass defense vs. St. Joseph QB Salaam Horne (5-11, 190). The Fighting Clan’s pass defense has allowed more than 150 yards in each of their last two games, and gave up a pair of touchdowns through the air in a loss to Egg Harbor last week. Horne is regarded as one of the top quarterbacks in in South Jersey. His numbers aren’t great this season — 8-for-27 for 140 yards and a touchdown. However, he could have a huge day against Vineland. Vineland LB Anthony Reyes (6-0, 220) vs. St. Joseph RB A’Laam Horne (5-11, 190). Horne has been the Wildcats’ bell cow this season, rushing for a team-best 374 yards and six scores. Vineland’s biggest strength this season has been its run defense. Starting linebacker DaQuan Cosby has been key part to that success, but a back injury has his status up in the air against St. Joseph. Reyes, a freshman, has played well next to Cosby this year, but if Cosby can’t go, he’ll have more on his plate. \nKeys to the Game Vineland can’t play scared. St. Joseph has been a New Jersey powerhouse for years, having won six straight state championships. While the Wildcats may win a seventh this season, they’re not as dominant as they have been. St. Joseph lost its season opener, the team's first setback since Sept. 20, 2013, and nearly fell to Millville last week, narrowly edging the Thunderbolts 13-7 in overtime. The Fighting Clan are still underdogs in this game, but they have a chance. They need to play aggressive and make St. Joseph sweat. Vineland needs to attack through the air. The Fighting Clan’s passing game hasn’t been very effective this season, producing just 84 yards in three games. However, St. Joseph allowed Millville quarterback Will Polhamus to throw for 181 last week while stuffing the Thunderbolts’ ground game for negative-8 yards. Vineland quarterback Isaih Pacheco needs to find a rhythm to give his team its best chance. Vineland has to play a clean game. During the Fighting Clan’s loss to Egg Harbor, they had three turnovers and committed six penalties for 55 yards. Two of those giveaways resulted in Eagles touchdowns and a crucial roughing-the-passer penalty allowed Egg Harbor to kick a field goal at the end of the first half. Vineland can’t give St. Joseph those kinds of opportunities. The Wildcats are too good not to take advantage. \nPrediction \nSt. Joseph 20, Vineland 6 \n— Josh Friedman \nVineland (2-1) at St. Joseph (2-1) \nWhen: Saturday, 3 p.m. \nWhere: Bill Bendig Memorial Field, Wood Street, Hammonton \nCoaches: St. Joseph: Paul Sacco (34th season, 290-57-5); Vineland: Dan Russo (3rd season, 7-16). \nOn the air: Local cable Channel 9 will televise the game tape-delayed Saturday at 6 p.m. and Monday at 7 p.m. WMIZ-1270AM will broadcast the game live. \nAll-time series: St. Joseph leads 1-0. \nLast meeting: St. Joseph 48, Vineland 0, 2014.
