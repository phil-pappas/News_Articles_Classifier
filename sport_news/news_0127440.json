An intense vehicle checking drive would be carried out after placing barricades at 32 spots. SSP Sadanand Datte has given instructions to SHOs of various police stations to deploy one sub-inspector (SI) and two constables at barricades during the checking drive. The police have drafted an elaborate traffic plan for the Parade Ground as thousands of devotees are likely to congregate there to witness the torching of Ravana and his relatives. The SSP said dog and bomb squads and policemen in civil clothes would be deployed at the Parade Ground and other busy places to avoid any untoward incident. A Quick Reaction Team (QRT) would also be deployed at the Parade Ground. Additional police force would be deployed at busy markets and other crowded places of the city and the law breakers would be dealt with very strictly, he stated. The city police would place barricades on Subhash Road, Darshanlal Chowk, Dunga House, Kanak Chowk, Convent Chowk, Landsdowne Chowk, Survey Chowk and Hotel Pacific, among other places, to regulate traffic movement. The parking arrangements for two-wheelers and four- wheelers would be at Ranger Ground, Mangla Devi Inter College and MDDA old parking complex on Rajpur Road. As per the traffic diversion plans, city buses plying on Parade Ground-Cantt route would operate from Oriental Chowk near Petrol Pump, Rajpur Road, while Clement Town-Rajpur Road route buses would operate along Darshanlal Chowk, Clock Tower and Clement Town. The bus operators were told not to operate from Kanak Chowk, Ashley Hall Chowk, Survey Chowk, and Lansdowne Chowk. The route restriction would also be followed for city buses plying on other routes in the city. Commercial three-wheelers (Vikram) plying on route numbers 2, 3, 5 and 8 would not be allowed to park near the Parade Ground.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T04:03:41.552+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
