Both teams will rely on hitters from the top of the 2014 draft (Kyle Schwarber and Michael Conforto) who came fast and with impact to the majors.\nBut mainly this is the 26-and-under battering ram of Schwarber and Anthony Rizzo and Kris Bryant and Jorge Soler against the 27-and-under lightning storm of Jacob deGrom and Matt Harvey and Noah Syndergaard and Steven Matz.\nIt is easy to believe this will be the first of many October showdowns considering the combination of talent and youth. The one we know for sure starts Saturday. Here are five scouting keys:\nCan the turtle become the hare? The Mets had the second-fewest steals in the majors (51). Curtis Granderson led the team with 11. No other team had a leader with so few. The Cubs allowed the second-most thefts (137) and had the second-worst throw-out percentage (21.7).\nPretty much the whole Cubs staff was victimized. Ace Jake Arrieta allowed the fourth-most steals in the majors (27). Nos. 3-4 starters Jason Hammel and Kyle Hendricks permitted 28 steals in 36 tries. Runners were 7-for-7 off setup man Justin Grimm and 8-for-9 off closer Hector Rondon.\nJon Lester Photo: Getty Images But this is really about Game 1 starter Jon Lester and his renowned yips and reluctance to throw to first base. Until the Royals exploited Lester in the wild-card game last year, it was like there was a gentlemen’s agreement — everyone knew Lester had a problem, yet few did anything about it.\nFrom 2011-14 (in the regular season), there were 14, 13, 12 and 16 steals against Lester. Then this year there were 44 — the most in the majors since Chris Young permitted the same amount in 2007. Lester is reluctant to throw to first to hold runners and is often inaccurate when he tries. At times, players took outrageous leads just daring him to throw and breaking on first movement whether he did or didn’t.\n“Everyone talks about Lester, and he has a major problem,” one scout said. “But what no one tells you is he is tough to time and is quick to the plate, his normal delivery is very quick to the plate. He will hold the ball and vary looks to stare you down and you will be, ‘Where was the part I was supposed to steal?’ He has elements to keep the major flaw from being exposed all the time. He is a cool customer.”\nStill, another scout said, “This is an area to take advantage of [Lester].” So will Granderson, David Wright, Yoenis Cespedes and Juan Lagares try to get an extra 90 feet and rattle Lester with steals, and will the Mets bunt to make him try to handle the ball?\nCan aces be dealt with again? The Mets advanced despite facing the game’s best 1-2 punch, Clayton Kershaw and Zack Greinke. Now they have to deal with Lester and Arietta, who is in contention with Kershaw and Greinke for the NL Cy Young.\nArrieta’s story is now well known — a disappointment in Baltimore, he has remade himself into a No. 1 starter in Chicago by going back to throwing across his body, developing a killer cutter and gaining greater precision.\nScouts are all in agreement that Arrieta is going to throw strikes and his stuff is too good to let him pitch consistently ahead. So as much as the Mets would love to build up his pitch count and get him out of games, the game plan probably has to be to attack early in counts.\nWhich Wrigley do we get? Fans celebrate outside Wrigley Field. Photo: Getty Images The standard at Wrigley is the wind blows in during the first two months in the season, favoring pitchers, and it blows out and favors hitters thereafter. But numerous scouts mentioned the wind blew in more this season than they could remember. Then in two games in the Division Series against the Cardinals, it blew out strongly and the Cubs — a predominantly flyball-hitting team — capitalized with the long ball.\n“It was howling out for the Cardinals,” said a scout in attendance “and it was a huge advantage for the Cubs.” Another scout said, “If the wind is blowing out, that the Mets have a strikeout rotation will be key because the Chicago hitters will be swinging for the fences and could be susceptible to strikeouts.”\nWrigley is a unique stadium. Obviously, the outfield walls have ivy and no padding. But there is brick all around, so you could get strange caroms on wild pitches, for example. There are bullpen mounds down each line, so foul pop-ups are more challenging. The crowd is right on top of the field and alive.\nCubs manager Joe Maddon with Dexter Fowler Photo: AP “The home crowd is an edge for the Cubs,” one scout said, “but I am curious if things start going wrong if you get that dead negative silence that has hurt them so much over the years because of all the losing or if the positivity of [manager] Joe Maddon and such a young team that is promising keeps the crowd from sucking the life out of the stadium.”\nStarlin starrin’? One scout called Starlin Castro his “sleeper,” another his “wild card.” Castro is no longer mentioned among the Cubs’ elite young players. He lost his starting shortstop job in August, was benched for a while and then moved to second base. But it was noticed Castro did not sulk while on the bench. And he came back and played well on both sides of the ball as a second baseman.\nHe hit .353 in the final 44 games, a reminder that though he is just still 25, he already has 991 career hits.\nOne scout said: “You worry about Rizzo and Schwarber and Bryant and a whole bunch of guys, and now Castro sneaks up on you. He is playing so much better. You can’t forget about him.”\nWhat does the regular season mean? The Cubs beat the Mets all seven games the teams played this year. Two of deGrom’s worst starts came against the Cubs, giving up four runs in five innings once and in 5 1/3 innings another time.\nNoah Syndergaard Photo: Charles Wenzelberg But if you are a Mets fan looking for the glimmer of hope, here is some stuff:\nEven with the two deGrom outings and that Noah Syndergaard was understandably jittery in his major league debut, the Mets pitched to a respectable 3.52 ERA against the Cubs despite the 0-7 mark.\nThey lost because they did not hit, scoring just 11 runs in those seven games. But here is the thing: Yoenis Cespedes, Michael Conforto, Travis d’Arnaud and David Wright did not take an at-bat against the Cubs this year. Dilson Herrera, John Mayberry Jr., Kevin Plawecki, Darrell Ceciliani, Eric Campbell, Johnny Monell and Kirk Nieuwenhuis combined for 68 plate appearances — or 28 percent of the plate appearances the Mets made against the Cubs in the regular season.\nThe two hitters who fared well for the Mets against the Cubs this year were Lucas Duda (.819 OPS) and Daniel Murphy (.865). They will be in the lineup with Cespedes, d’Arnaud, Wright and — at least against righties — Conforto.\n  chicago cubs ,  david wright ,  jake arrieta ,  joe maddon ,  jon lester ,  kris bryant ,  kyle schwarber ,  new york mets ,  starlin castro ,  travis d'arnaud ,  wrigley field ,  yoenis cespedes", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T18:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T23:46:47.553+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
