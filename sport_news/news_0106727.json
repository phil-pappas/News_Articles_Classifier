He’s a good play-caller and he’s got a good system out there. We know we’ll face a Baylor-type offense at quarterback and the wideouts.” \nThe AAC’s leading passer directs the Hurricanes’ offense. Junior Dane Evans is averaging 367.8 yards passing per game and has tossed 10 touchdowns. \nTrying to slow Evans will be an ECU secondary that has battled injuries of late; starting cornerback Rocco Scarfone and backup cornerback Corey Seargeant missed last Saturday’s game at BYU. Scarfone is expected to be back against Tulsa, but Seargeant’s status is still unknown. \nTo bolster the secondary corps, McNeill opted last week to pull the redshirt off junior safety DaShawn Benton. \nAlso stepping in to help the secondary has been sophomore Bobby Fulp. A former walk-on, Fulp made four tackles last week against BYU. \n“Maybe four games or four weeks ago, I asked the coaches to find roles for the kids so they can help make plays,’’ McNeill said. “Bobby has been a steady special teams player. You see him in practice. He’s got length that I like. He’s very disciplined, very coachable.’’ \nDuke coach reacts to Spurrier resignation \nSteve Spurrier’s deep connection to Duke meant many in the Blue Devil family felt the impact of his decision to resign as head coach at South Carolina earlier this week. \nAmong those were Duke head coach David Cutcliffe, who matched wits many times with Spurrier’s teams while he was an offensive coordinator at Tennessee. \n“I have great respect for Coach Spurrier,’’ Cutcliffe said. “My brother was a teammate of his at University of Florida, so I was exposed to Steve long, long ago. \n“The sad part for me is I think college football certainly lost one of its very greatest the business has ever seen. I'm telling you, as an offensive coordinator in that league, when he was a head coach in the SEC, I just admired what they did and how they did it and how consistently he did it, and it didn't matter where he was or what he was doing. \n“So my only emotion is the sadness of it. I kind of like having him — he helped me raise the bar. That was something you wanted to try to reach, the kind of consistency that Steve Spurrier reached in his career.’’ \nSpurrier was Duke’s head coach from 1987-89, and he has maintained strong ties to the program. \n“I talked with him prior to taking this job, and you could sense and hear his respect and passion for the university,’’ Cutcliffe said. “There's no question that he has a fond spot in his heart for Duke. Not only was he a head coach here, he was a successful offensive coordinator here, which preceded any head coaching job he had.’’ — By staff writer Sammy Batten \nUNC freshman DE to get playing time \nOne of the jewels of North Carolina’s recruiting Class of 2015 is expected to see his first playing time today against Wake Forest. \nDue to injuries, UNC is expected to activate freshman defensive end Jalen Dalton, a 6-foot-6, 240-pounder who was rated the state’s No. 4 college prospect in The Fayetteville Observer’s preseason list of the Top 50 prospects a year ago. \n“We started talking about this about three weeks ago as a staff because he started really coming on,’’ UNC coach Larry Fedora said. “His progress as a defensive lineman just kept accelerating in the last three weeks. And so we continued to talk about it. \n“And then on top of that, we've had some things happen in the defensive line injury-wise and so we said, why not, we need to go ahead and play this guy. He can help us win.’’ \nDalton is listed as the third player on the depth chart at one end position behind junior Mikey Bart and senior Jessie Rogers on the pregame depth chart for Wake Forest. \nStaff writer Sammy Batten can be reached at battens@fayobserver.com or 486-3534.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T08:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T18:39:39.574+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
