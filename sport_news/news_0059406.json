(Scott Halleran / Getty Images) Associated Press \nThe biggest difference between the Presidents Cup and the Ryder Cup is that the American team is filled with smiles, not stress, at the former. And there's a reason for that. The Americans haven't lost in the Presidents Cup since 1998, and the last four have not been particularly close. \nThe U.S. started the Presidents Cup strongly today at the Jack Nicklaus Golf Club Korea, taking a 3-1 edge in the five foursomes (alternate-shot) matches. \nRickie Fowler and Jimmy Walker took a 5-and-4 win over Anirban Lahiri and Thongchai Jaidee for the first point. Bubba Watson and J.B. Holmes defeated Adam Scott and Hideki Matsuyama, 3 and 2. The Internationals got a point when Louis Oosthuizen and Branden Grace topped Matt Kuchar and Patrick Reed, 3 and 2, but Jordan Spieth and Dustin Johnson closed out Marc Leishman and Danny Lee, 4 and 3. Phil Mickelson and Zach Johnson had a 1-up lead over Jason Day and Steven Bowditch when this edition went to press. \nSpieth said it was hard not to notice the contrast between the cups. “It seems there is a bit of a difference in the two teams' rooms in the Presidents Cup experience I've had and the Ryder Cup last year,” Spieth said. “Almost like we put too much emphasis on the Ryder Cup instead of just freeing up to play our own game.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T09:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T20:34:07.293+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
