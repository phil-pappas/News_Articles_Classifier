And the Stars will have seven days between games against Toronto Nov.2 on the road and Nov. 10 at home.\nBriefly\n-- Stars defensemen Jamie Oleksiak and Patrik Nemeth were healthy scratches for the seventh consecutive game. Ruff said Jordie Benn and Jyrki Jokipakka continue to succeed on the third pair, so they get to stay in.\n\"There's that competition to stay in, and I think our defensive core for the most part has played very well,\" Ruff said.\n-- Stars wingers Patrick Eaves (lower body), Curtis McKenzie (lower body) and Travis Moen (upper body) continue to sit out. Eaves could be ready sometime next week, according to Stars GM Jim Nill. McKenzie could be ready in two to three weeks.\nTwitter: @MikeHeika\nOn Twitter:\n @MikeHeika", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/MikeHeika", "https://twitter.com/MikeHeika"], "published": "2015-10-23T04:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T13:51:20.484+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
