So we just go through the schedule and figure out a nice plan the will prolong our health for the guys.\"\nNBA GMs pick Heat fourth in East, laud Winslow selection Ira Winderman NBA general managers predict a fourth-place finish for the Miami Heat in the Eastern Conference, while also calling the Heat's selection of Justise Winslow at No. 10 the biggest steal of the NBA draft, according to the results of NBA.com's annual poll .\nWhile the Heat did not receive any votes in...\nNBA general managers predict a fourth-place finish for the Miami Heat in the Eastern Conference, while also calling the Heat's selection of Justise Winslow at No. 10 the biggest steal of the NBA draft, according to the results of NBA.com's annual poll .\nWhile the Heat did not receive any votes in...\n(Ira Winderman) Spoelstra said the goal is to know when his players will be available by creating a program that has them available when needed.\n\"I'm very encouraged by how much workload Amar'e has been able to bring to training camp and also Josh,\" he said. \"So they're able to get their reps, they're able to stay sharp, they're able to learn what we do.
