Golf was seen as elitist and exclusionary, with no place in the working man’s China.\nBut as China slowly started to open to markets across the world, its attitude towards golf started to loosen. The sport is still officially banned even though Chinese players are competing on the LPGA Tour, the country hosts PGA Tour events and golf courses are popping up everywhere.\nBut occasionally, the Chinese government will go through a random crackdown to prevent people from playing golf. It recently closed a number of golf courses and expelled politicians for playing golf. Now the Chinese Communist party just banned its members, which number close to 88 million, from joining golf clubs.\nAccording to the BBC:\nThe new rule on golf states that members are banned from “obtaining, holding or using membership cards for gyms, clubs, golf clubs, or various other types of consumer cards, or entering private clubs”.\nIf caught, members could either receive a warning or be removed from the party, depending on the severity of the violation. The new regulations (in Chinese) did not explain why the joining of golf clubs is banned, but such clubs are often seen by the Chinese public as places where officials have cut shady deals.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-34600544", "http://www.usatoday.com/sports/", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "http://ftw.usatoday.com/2015/04/why-is-tiger-woods-going-to-china-when-the-government-has-banned-golf"], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T04:27:40.910+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
