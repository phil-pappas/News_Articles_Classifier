They were able to get a generator hooked up to the cell tower on San Sal so that cell service was available.” \nRoark said Penovich had another good Samaritan fly over San Salvador for visual confirmation that he could land. \nThe worst hit areas in the Bahamas were Long Island, San Salvador, Acklins and Crooked Island. Many residents are still without power, water, phone service or all three. \nPenovich, who owns a home on San Salvador, was still there on Friday. \n“There was an awesome first response from so many people ranging from single-engine Cessnas to triple-engine Falcon jets,” Penovich said. “But we need people to keep the Island and its amazing people in their prayers.” \nPenovich believes the biggest obstacle for the hardest-hit islands — and San Salvador in particular — is rebuilding economies relying heavily on tourism. \n“The biggest problem for this island moving forward will be holding on to what was already a very fragile economy,” Penovich said. “Club Med on the northwest side of the island took a very hard hit and it employees a large percentage of the population. There is a lot of speculation as to when — and even if — they will ever reopen.” \n“We’ve been through some pretty bad storms in this part of the Bahamas, so we know what they are going through,” said Cindy Pinder, vice president of the Abaco Fly Fishing Guides Association. “But Crooked Island was probably the hardest hit. The storm destroyed all but three homes on the island, leaving most of the 300 or so inhabitants without shelter. Two of the island’s three grocery stores were destroyed, and the British navy evacuated most of the people on the island earlier (last) week. It’s really bad.” \nPinder said her group is accepting donations to help fishing guides, and lodges or hotels catering to visiting anglers to rebuild. \n“This happened at the worst possible time of year, right before the start of the fishing season,” Pinder said. “Some people lost their homes entirely; others still have the structure. Many lost boats and motors.” \nThe AFFGA is accepting donations to help rebuild the area through its website, AFFGA.org. \n“There are some other resources looking for immediate forms of help like food, water, generators, general survival supplies,” Pinder said. “There’s still an incredible need for that. But what AFFGA is focusing on is trying to get these people back on their feet and working again.” \nPinder agrees with Penovich in that rebuilding the tourisim-reliant economies will be one of the main issues. The southern end of the Bahamas relies heavily on tourism — especially from fishing outfitters like Montana’s Yellow Dog Outfitters. \nThe travel agency specializes in high-end fly fishing trips around the world — and the southern Bahamas offers some of the best. \n“Outfitters like Yellow Dog have a substantial number of trips booked in these areas, and there’s nothing. No boats, no accommodations. It’s all gone,” Pinder said. “It’s fishing, tourism and subsistence farming — that’s what they’ve got. So we’re working with industry partners like Yellow Dog and some boat and motor manufacturers in hopes of raising money and being able to help people get back to work. Some people had insurance, but most didn’t. It’s a disaster.” \nMarine artist-turned fishing lodge operator Vaughn Cochran of St. Augustine echos Pinder’s sentiments. \n“We didn’t get much damage up where Blackfly Lodge is in Abaco,” he said. “But the people down south, they’ve lost just about everything and it is not even being mentioned in the news here in the states. It’s incredible. Some places were still under five feet (of water), and no one has been able to get to them yet.” \nThere are numerous resources for donating immediate supplies. On the Space Coast, interested donors can contact Sean Slater at SSlater Surf Tackle in Cocoa Beach or Roark at Sunrise Marina. The Florida Sport Fishing Association and Strike Zone Outfitters have also stepped up. The philanthropic Nassau combo of Lia Head and Gina Knowles have raised nearly $27,000 to date through their charity funding site and Oliver White, fly fishing personality and managing partner of Abaco Lodge has raised nearly $7,000 in just two days. To get involved yourself, see the sidebar for a complete listing of contacts. \nPenovich, who is still on the island helping, said he hopes the outpouring of support for the Out Islands continues. \n“These things are kind of like funerals… Lots of people show up initially with food and support, and when they are gone, reality sets in. The task of picking up and rebuilding will be monumental.” \nTed Lund is a freelance writer born and raised on the Space Coast. He operates the outdoor blog tedlund.com.
