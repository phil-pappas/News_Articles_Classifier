To the Editor: There was much discussion months ago in response to Sheriff Mele researching the purchase of an Armored Vehicle for Tuolumne County. As a police officer and paramedic in California for 20 years (retired) I recognize the need for the Sheriff’s Department to have an armored vehicle. I understand that the public does not understand the tactics involved when a critical incident happens. Having been the first, and for many years only, S.W.A.T. Medic for a large metropolitan police department in the San Francisco Bay Area I know how this type of vehicle can save lives. Many people don’t understand that a critical incident can and will happen anywhere. As recently evidenced by the shootout with the Sonora Police and deputies in downtown Sonora as well as the most recent planned terrorist attack against students and teachers at one of our local high schools it is clear that we are not immune. These vehicles are designed to not only protect the police but to allow them safer access to rescue injured citizens and law enforcement. And remember those injured citizens may one day be you or your family. I would like to see the Sheriff obtain all of the money from federal funding and use the department’s asset forfeiture money that is available for other programs like expanding the K-9 Unit. As an ex police K-9 handler I recognize the tremendous benefit that these dogs have for our community.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-07T04:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T07:54:15.896+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
