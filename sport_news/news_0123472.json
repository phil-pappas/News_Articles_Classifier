Murphy Editor's Note: This column was written before Georgia's loss to Tennessee on Saturday.\nThe storm arrived as predicted.\nWe had all watched it coming; we heard tales of it on the news, listened to discussions about it in forums on the Internet, and talked about it amongst ourselves, at water coolers at work and over a couple of beers afterward.\nStill, when it happened, the degree of devastation was difficult to comprehend.\nA cold rain fell throughout the day — a fine mist and then a torrent that soaked us all to the skin. The wind came next, screaming in from the west, a veritable sharknado that tore flesh from bone and ripped men’s souls from their bodies. There were earthquakes and floods and pillars of flame and suddenly it was over — a nightmare of Biblical proportions, seismic and cataclysmic, the carnage so complete and overwhelming that grown men wept.\nBut when it was all over, this storm of the century simply loaded back onto its crimson-colored buses and headed back to Tuscaloosa.\nThe Alabama Crimson Tide had dismantled the Georgia Bulldogs at home, 38-10.\nThe aftermath was painful for the dispirited red-clad throngs who left Sanford Stadium. The post-mortem discussions on talk radio were brutal.\n“We just suck!” said one caller.\n“Typical Georgia!” said another.\nAnd so it happened once again — the annual letdown, the inexplicable collapse, a situation where thousands of Bulldog faithful had their grand hopes and dreams splintered.\nAt the center of this maelstrom stood longtime Georgia Coach Mark Richt — a model of calm, as always. His summation of the day’s events was succinct and to the point:\n“They whipped us pretty good.”\nThe Internet hummed with a billion gigabytes of unsolicited commentary. There were the usual calls for Coach Richt’s firing, howls of unbridled angst about the program, watered-down excuses about the inclement weather, and bitter recriminations about the offense, the defense and the special teams play.\nMeanwhile, to the west, preseason media darling Auburn struggled to defeat a weak San Jose State team to raise its record to 3-2. Trendy SEC East pick Tennessee, now irrelevant for a decade, lost to a pedestrian Arkansas team to fall to 2-3. And third-ranked Ole Miss, who conquered this same Alabama squad at Bryant-Denny Stadium just two weeks ago, was annihilated by upstart Florida—a team just one year removed from a 7-6 season.\n“No Nick Saban!’\nSo let’s gain a little perspective here.\nThe University of Alabama has a good football program. In fact, under future Hall of Fame Coach Nick Saban, they have set the standard for excellence in the SEC for the past eight years. Saban has won three national titles at Alabama and another at LSU. His Alabama teams have won 10 or more games seven years in a row — and will do so again this year. The Crimson Tide has become a recruiting machine, finishing with the top recruiting class in the nation for five consecutive years. Everyone else in the SEC has simply been playing catch-up.\nThere are reasons why league victories over the Crimson Tide are recognized with the same degree of awe as celestial events, like the passage of a comet or a solar eclipse. They are that rare. Since 2008, Alabama has only lost eight SEC regular season games. That’s an average of one loss per year.\n“Mark Richt is no Nick Saban!” one radio talk show caller exclaimed Saturday night. That’s true, of course — but neither is anybody else.\nThere have been a few other flashes in the SEC pan. Urban Meyer has been perhaps Saban’s biggest challenge as head coach, both at the University of Florida and at Ohio State, where he coaches now. But Meyer’s last team at Florida was a disaster — and his sudden departure from Gainesville, citing a plethora of vague health concerns, left that program adrift for several years. And Gus Malzahn, who beat Alabama and took his first Auburn team to the brink of a national title the year after Auburn had posted an abysmal 3-9 record, has struggled since, with an 8-5 record last season and a 3-2 mark so far this year.\nMark Richt is no Nick Saban. But he is Mark Richt — and that is saying something.\nRicht, the dean of SEC coaches, is in his 15th season at Georgia. He has posted a 140-49 record during that span. His teams have won 10 or more games nine times — and will likely do so again this year. He has won two SEC titles, played for three more, and has sent his team to 14 straight bowl games, winning nine of them. He has had 11 teams finish in the top 25 and eight teams finish among the top 10 teams in the final team polls.\nMore importantly, Richt represents the University of Georgia — and he does so with an impeccable reputation for good character. Moreover, he has done so in an era when the lucrative nature of college football has made winning games such an absolute mandate that many programs are willing to compromise their integrity.\nLet’s look at a few examples. At Penn State, longtime defensive coordinator Jerry Sandusky was convicted of child molestation. Legendary coach Joe Paterno knew about Sandusky’s inappropriate sexual contact with children and covered it up. Urban Meyer, while he was head coach at Florida, allowed tight end Aaron Hernandez to play without a single suspension despite multiple failed drug tests. Hernandez, a former All-Pro for the NFL’s New England Patriots, is now in prison for murdering semi-pro football player Odin Lloyd.\nLSU, under Les Miles, allowed a star QB to play in the SEC and national championship games despite video evidence showing that he had beaten another man unconscious in a bar fight. And FSU Heisman trophy winner Jameis Winston, who led FSU to a national championship, was involved in a string of off-the-field transgressions, which nevertheless only cost him a one-game suspension from play.\nBeacon of intergrity\nRicht, by contrast, has been a beacon of integrity. His players graduate; in the SEC, only Vanderbilt has a higher graduation rate for its football team. When one realizes that less than 4 percent of all college football players at the FCS level go on to play professional ball, that figure is a critical one.\nA college diploma can be a life-changing event for many of these young men. That, ultimately, is the real prize for most of them — even if their high school dreams lie elsewhere. Second, he does not cheat. Scandals about paying players or illegal inducements will never taint the University of Georgia’s football team under Richt’s watch. Third, Richt challenges his players to be men of high character. His expectations are well-defined — and he is not afraid to terminate a player’s privilege of playing for the University of Georgia.\nFive-star recruits like Josh Harvey Clemons (kicked off the team for multiple failed drug tests) or Isaiah Crowell (booted for carrying an unregistered handgun, among other things) were given the same consideration that would be given to a walk-on. Richt expects his players to conduct themselves as adults; he pushes them to be grown men, trying to mold their character into something sustainable. And Richt cares about his players even after they leave the program. The Paul Oliver Network, an organization of Georgia Football alumni, meets annually in Athens to allow former players to establish connections and maintain an understanding that there is life after football. This organization is the brainchild of Richt, who felt compelled to put the organization together after Paul Oliver, a former player, committed suicide when his NFL career was over.\n“I’ve always had a greater purpose in coaching than trying to get a raise or trying to win a championship or coach a Heisman Trophy winner,” Richt said in a recent interview. “I’ve been blessed to win championships, coach Heisman winners and All-Americans. I’ve experienced all that. And if that’s all there is at the end it’s empty, unless you help these guys. That’s what people misunderstand sometimes. I’m highly motivated to win the national championship. But just because I care about my players beyond football they think, ‘Oh he’s more worried about that than he is winning.’ No, that’s not true at all. I want to win. But I feel like we truly are educators, and we truly have a responsibility to help these guys.”\nMark Richt is now the second-winningest coach in Georgia football history. And while his teams have not reached the lofty heights of Alabama’s during the Saban era, he’s certainly achieved more than a modicum of success on the field. Barring some disaster, this year’s Georgia team will almost certainly go to another bowl game, and will be favored to win at least 10 games once again. They may well represent the SEC East in the SEC Championship game. Through it all, Richt will conduct himself with honor, seeing his greatest challenge as molding callow youth into responsible young men.\n“How many moms have said to coaches, ‘I can’t teach them how to be a man, can you help me?’ I would say half or more. It’s that situation,” Richt said in a recent interview. “So who’s gonna help them?”\nThat person is Mark Richt, a man that any Georgia alumnus should be proud of.\nIt is true, Georgia has not won a national title under Richt; indeed, their last SEC title was 10 years ago. Richt has a mediocre 14-21 record against ranked opponents since 2008; his record during that span against eventual top 10 teams is even worse, at 2-10. But they have also not been languishing in the doldrums of irrelevancy as they did during the Jim Donnan era, nor have they been the laughing stock of the SEC, as they were during the Ray Goff years. One only need look to once-great teams like Miami, Texas and Nebraska or crumbling programs like South Carolina’s to see how things could be much, much worse.\nPersonally, I think Richt’s day is coming. Georgia will have another highly rated recruiting class this year. He has a solid coaching staff in place. It would be no surprise at all if he were to win that elusive national championship that he has chased for so long in the next few years. And at that point, the enigma of Mark Richt will not be why he has never won a national title.\nInstead, it will be how Georgia fans could have ever wanted him to be anyplace else.\nMark Murphy, M.D. is a Savannah physician and writer.", "external_links": ["http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/020511Mark", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/all/themes/savannahnow/images/blank.gif", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/020511Mark"], "published": "2015-10-11T20:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T22:07:58.314+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
