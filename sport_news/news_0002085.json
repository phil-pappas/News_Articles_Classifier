Now for over a year, he has built a Housing Action Plan which the city council adopted this month. A major aspect of that plan is to build 1,500 new beds for students over the next five years.\nI don't think there's any doubt that the students in the market has been one of the factors that have driven vacancy rates so low in Burlington and rents so high,\" Weinberger said. The city hopes that more rental choices bring prices down.\nIn a statement, UVM Vice President Tom Gustafson said in principle the school supports the city's plan, but \"the specifics of how the goals in the plan will be achieved will require more attention and thought.\"\nThe plan also focuses on building more affordable housing for non-students. From 2002 to 2013, the Queen City built just 18 affordable housing units in its downtown. Some of the new units could come from the downtown mall's redevelopment.\nDeveloper Don Sinex says he has plans for a 14 story residential tower. \"It'll be a good mixture in housing which the city has expressed an interest in seeing. It'll be affordable housing; it will be market housing,\" Sinex said.\nSeveral city departments are still working out some of the details included in the plan.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T01:56:28.482+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
