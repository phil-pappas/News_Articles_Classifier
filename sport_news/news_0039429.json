(AP) - An off-duty police officer died Sunday after being shot multiple times, the fourth Memphis police officer to be fatally shot in slightly more than four years, authorities said.\nMemphis Police Director Toney Armstrong said 31-year-old Terence Olridge was taken to the Regional Medical Center, where he later died.\nOfficers got a call around 1 p.m. about a shooting at a home in the Memphis suburb of Cordova, Armstrong said.
