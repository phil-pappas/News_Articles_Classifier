I can't have any reservations about it. I can't overthink, I just have to go.\"\nMidway through the second quarter, Slauson and quarterback Jay Cutler bungled an exchange and the Oakland Raiders' Dan Williams recovered at the Bears' 25-yard line. Three plays later Derek Carr passed to Roy Helu for a 4-yard TD and a 14-6 Raiders lead.\nBut the Bears ran more out of the shotgun and the pistol after that, and there were no more problems.\nIt remains to be seen whether Slauson stays at center or rookie Hroniss Grasu gets a shot, but Montgomery is not expected back this season.\n\"I'd like to take about 24 hours to enjoy this win before we start getting into personnel issues,\" coach John Fox said. \"But those are all great questions.\"\nMontgomery's loss is significant.\n\"That's not what you want to see,\" Slauson said. \"Will was my guy. He's a great, great player for us. He's (the guy who) sets the whole offense. I'm definitely not as comfortable with it, but the guys battled.\"\nNo one battled harder than Slauson.\n\"There are differences between guard and center (techniques),\" Slauson said. \"It's a different style of play (facing) a head-up nose tackle, and those are things that I've never done. So trying to figure it out on the fly can be tough at times.\"\nSlauson's teammates appreciated his effort.\n\"That just shows how smart he is,\" tight end Martellus Bennett said, \"and the type of player he is, and how valuable he is to our team.\"\nGimme the ball: Tight end Martellus Bennett's 7-yard reception on fourth-and-5 from the Bears' 25 kept alive the game-winning field-goal drive.\nIt's a position Bennett relishes.\n\"At practice we have fourth-down plays every week, and I beg for the ball every single time,\" Bennett said. \"I hate when the defense gets the stop, and I always wants to be the guy who's in position to make a play at that clutch moment. I think that's what tight ends do.\"\nBennett finished with 11 catches for 83 yards, both of which were game bests, including a 5-yard TD grab in the second quarter. The offense clearly looked to him to pick up the slack left by the absence of wide receiver Alshon Jeffery, who missed his third straight game with a hamstring injury.\nBennett leads the Bears with 24 catches, 201 receiving yards and 2 receiving TDs.\nGetting defensive: Although the Raiders came in with the No. 7 offense in total yards, the Bears' defense held them to 243 yards, 128 fewer than the Bears' offense.\n\"The defense gave us chance after chance after chance,\" guard/center Matt Slauson said.\nThe Raiders had the NFL's No. 1 rushing offense in yards per carry after three games but managed just 70 yards on 22 carries (3.2-yard average) Sunday.\nCoach John Fox said hard work and greater familiarity are the keys to the defensive improvements.\nFilling in: Safety Antrel Rolle, who has missed just one game in the previous nine years, left with an ankle injury on the first play of the second half and did not return.\nRolle was replaced by Harold Jones-Quartey, an undrafted rookie out of Findlay, who was claimed on waivers a month ago after he was cut by the Arizona Cardinals.\nCornerback Tracy Porter started his first game as a Bear in place of Alan Ball, who was active with a groin injury but did not play.\nExtra points: Matt Forte had 155 yards from scrimmage for his 25th game with 150 or more, the most of any player since he entered the league in 2008. Forte rushed 25 times for 91 yards and caught 4 passes for 64 yards. … Defensive lineman Jarvis Jenkins picked up his third sack of the season. He had 2 in his previous four NFL seasons, including a season on injured reserve as a rookie in 2011. … The Bears' other sack came from rookie nose tackle Eddie Goldman, his first.\nSitting it out: Wide receiver Alshon Jeffery (hamstring), offensive tackle Jermon Bushrod (concussion/shoulder), defensive lineman Jeremiah Ratliff (ankle), quarterback David Fales, punter Pat O'Donnell (knee), running back Ka'Deem Carey and center Hroniss Grasu were inactive.\nPunter Spencer Lanning was signed Saturday to replace O'Donnell, who was injured during last week's game in Seattle.\nGet great articles like this sent to your inbox!
