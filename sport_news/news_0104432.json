Or that most of Utah's key rotation players rested for the bulk of the fourth quarter and overtime after building that sizeable lead. The young-and-hungry Blazers refused to end the night without putting on a show, riding the hot hand of CJ McCollum , the prolific scoring of Damian Lillard and the impressive defense of Ed Davis to outscore Utah 50-27 over the final 17 minutes.\n\"This is a young team, athletic and we have an All-Star point guard, so every night we're going to be in games,\" Davis said. \"We're going to fight, it's going to be a long season, it's going to be a lot of up and downs. But every night we're going to fight and give it our best effort.\"\nFor much of the night, it looked like it would be one of those nights where the effort wasn't enough. Instead, with more than one memorable highlight and plenty of late-game drama, the effort and success went hand-in-hand.\nMcCollum instigated the drama with an exhilarating individual performance in the fourth quarter, scoring 18 points on 8 of 11 shooting to singlehandedly get the Blazers back in the game. He made five shots in a row during the blistering run, torching the Jazz with an assortment of jumpers and drives to basket.\nHis breathtaking play energized the crowd and the Blazers used the buzz as fuel for the comeback, a variety of players making highlight-worthy plays and producing in the win.\nDavis was a blur of energy and defense. On one play, he fought away two Jazz defenders to snare a tough rebound under the hoop. Four other times in the fourth, he blocked shots, including a crucial swat of a Treveon Graham jumper in the final 90 seconds, when the Blazers trailed by three points. Not to be outdone, Noah Vonleh added his own crowd-pleasing hustle, snaring seemingly every offensive rebound in sight and registering a mammoth two-handed dunk out of an inbound play in overtime.\nWith a young and athletic roster, a slew of offensive weapons and a coach that preaches passing and ball movement, even when things are tough the play tends to be entertaining. So even when the Jazz were rolling, there were still Blazers highlights, ranging from a Meyers Leonard behind-the-back pass in transition to a Mason Plumlee steal and coast-to-coast layup.\n\"Hopefully (there will be) more winning than losing,\" McCollum said, smirking. \"But I think it'll be a good product as we continue to get better and get more familiar with each other. We do a great job of pushing tempo, sharing the ball, getting guys open looks, (making) a lot of threes. And the young fellas are active.\"\nWhen it was all said and done Sunday, Lillard (32 points, six assists) and McCollum (26 points, nine assists) combined to scored 58 points, half of them coming in the fourth quarter and overtime. Vonleh had 10 points and eight rebounds, Allen Crabbe had 12 points, three assists and three rebounds and Davis added nine points, 13 rebounds and four blocks.\nThe Blazers scored the first 10 points of overtime, cruising to a rather anticlimactic finish.\nThere will be nights this season when similar comebacks falls short for the Blazers, when the rough and rugged teams of the Western Conference outlast their hunger. But the Blazers promise not to be an easy out no matter what. And that, combined with their exciting brand of basketball, should make this a season worth watching — win or lose.\n\"We've got super athletic wings, we've got shot-blocking bigs that run the court and we've got guards that can score the ball,\" Lillard said. \"So I think having that, if we do the things we need to, we'll have a chance to be around in every game.\"\nAdded coach Terry Stotts: \"They're going to give effort. We'll have nights where we can't make shots or we have some breakdowns. But it's not going to be for lack of effort and competing.\"\n— Joe Freeman | jfreeman@oregonian.com | 503-294-5183 | @BlazerFreeman", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/BlazerFreeman"], "published": "2015-10-19T06:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T16:02:28.741+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
