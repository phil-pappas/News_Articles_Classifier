It is not much better at this moment,\" said Klopp. \n\"With Daniel's injury we have to proceed day-by-day. If he can train, for example, completely normal then it is an option. \n\"Today we have another treatment and another screening maybe because there is a little bit of fluid (inside the joint).\" \nPress Association Sport understands Sturridge will have an ultrasound scan on his knee but it is only believed to be a minor issue. \nOn the positive side Klopp will have forwards Christian Benteke and Roberto Firmino available at the weekend after both returned from long injury lay-offs in Thursday's 1-1 Europa League draw at home to Rubin Kazan. \nThe Liverpool coach said: \"Christian and Roberto had two training sessions with the team. Usually it is too early to bring them into the situation where you need them at 100 per cent but they did well. \n\"I am sure it was not the best they can play so now we are a step further with them. \n\"They are two new options and very important options for Sunday.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T15:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T20:13:32.400+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
