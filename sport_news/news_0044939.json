She is amazing,” Taylor told AAP after her stunning Wimbledon junior triumph. \n“But we have to be careful with her,” he said. \n“People are excited because she is such an outstanding talent and we haven’t had one like that for so long. \n“But she’s still got a long way to go and so many things can wrong before she becomes a top-20 player. \n“She’s not even close to that. The distance she has to travel to get there is way off so let’s just be excited about her potential for now, eh.” \nFive months after her breakthrough at the All England Club, Barty won the Australian Open wildcard playoff to confirm her immense talent. \n“She’s a complete tennis player, an updated and better version of Hingis. She already serves better,” said Taylor. \n“I haven’t seen anyone with this much potential before. \n“Barty doesn’t have the power of Venus or Serena but she’s got intuition that you can’t really teach.” \nBarty’s meteoric rise continued with selection Australia’s Fed Cup team at just 16, the youngest since Jelena Dokic 15 years earlier, and her maiden grand slam win at the 2013 French Open. \nShe also reached the second round of the US Open in 2013 to climb to a career-high No.129 in the world. \nBut out of the blue last September, Barty called it quits, the indigenous youngster struggling with home sickness and the grind of the sometimes isolating professional tennis tour. \nNow a career in cricket – after top-scoring with 63 not out off 60 balls and taking 2-13 from four overs in her T20 debut for Western Suburbs in the Brisbane Women’s Premier competition last weekend – seemingly awaits. \nASH BARTY THE TEENAGE TENNIS PRODIGY TURNED CRICKETER \n2011: Wins Wimbledon junior crown at 15. \n2013: Makes her Fed Cup debut for Australia at 16, the youngest to do so since Jelena Dokic in 1998. \n2013: Wins grand slam first-round matches at the French Open and US Open to climb to career-high ranking of No.129 in the world. \n2013: Reaches grand slam doubles finals with Casey Dellacqua at Australian Open, Wimbledon and US Open. \n2014: Announces in September that she is taking an “indefinite break” from tennis. \n2015: Signs with the Brisbane Heat to play in the inaugural Women’s Big Bash League.
