Italy have won three of the last four tests when Parisse and Favaro started together, a sequence that began with Italy’s first Six Nations win over Ireland, 22-15, in Rome in 2013. \nThat defeat — before Schmidt took over — haunts the Irish squad. \n“I definitely haven’t forgotten it as it was a massive learning curve for me,” said lock Iain Henderson, who will partner captain Paul O’Connell in the engine room of the scrum. \n“Maybe Italy teams before that might have rolled over after a good performance in the first half. \n“But as we’ve seen here, with upsets and teams playing so well, a lot of the World Cup games teams aren’t rolling over as easily.” \nDespite enforced changes in the backs, the Irish have plenty of firepower in Earls, who with seven tries needs just one more to become their all-time top World Cup try scorer, and veteran wing Tommy Bowe. Bowe and Earls each scored two tries in the win against Romania last Sunday and gets a chance because of Zebo being switched to fullback. \nBrunel is not sure how long Parisse will last, which will be a relief to Ireland. \n“He is the captain, he is a great player and so that makes him important for us,” said Brunel, who steps down after the tournament. \n“It is important for him to be able to play a World Cup and he fought hard to be back. \n“He wants to have a good World Cup. It is important for him and important for us.” \nBrunel said his players needed to improve in the lineout if they were to have a chance of upsetting Ireland. \n“It is crucial that we win our own ball to be able to play our best,” said Brunel. \n“We didn’t do that in our last two matches against Ireland, when we made 240 tackles in 2014 and 219 in 2015. That can’t happen again.” \nBrunel, though, retains belief his troops can raise their game. \n“I am convinced that we can win, but up until now we haven’t been able to play therugby that we were expecting.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T07:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T15:46:45.698+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
