The lawsuit notes that Montgomery County prosecutors declined to file charges against Pierre after what he says was a consensual sexual encounter with a female UD student last spring. \nHis lawsuit filed Wednesday says the school's investigation was \"fundamentally unfair\" and reached a \"wholly irrational, unsubstantiated\" conclusion after a hearing that failed to accommodate Pierre's learning disability. \nThe school declined comment on the lawsuit, but says it complies with federal requirements. \nThe 6-foot-6 senior from Toronto has played a key role in the Flyers' recent basketball success.
