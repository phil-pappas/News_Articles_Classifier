Naredo, ABS-CBNnews.com Posted at 10/11/2015 1:55 PM | Updated as of 10/11/2015 2:25 PM Mac Belo led FEU with 12 points against Ateneo. Photo by Arvin Lim, ABS-CBN Sports \n(UPDATED) Far Eastern University (FEU) completed a season sweep of Ateneo de Manila University after downing the Blue Eagles, 66-61, in their second round encounter of the UAAP Season 78 tournament Sunday at the Araneta Coliseum. \nA 10-0 run bridging the third and fourth quarters gave the Tamaraws a 54-49 advantage with 8:29 to go, and it proved to be enough of a cushion to hold off a late Ateneo charge led by Kiefer Ravena. \nWith the victory, the Tamaraws have won six straight games and now sit at the top spot of the league standings with a 7-1 win-loss record, while the Blue Eagles suffered their second consecutive defeat to drop to 4-4 this season. \n(READ: UAAP Season 78 Men's Basketball 2nd Round Schedule ) \n\"(Ateneo) Coach Bo (Perasol) and his coaching staff did a great job on adjusting. Maganda ang ginawa nila. Guys were getting open, especially in the first half,\" FEU head coach Nash Racela said after the game. \"Hats off to Coach Bo, pinahirapan nila kami today.\" \nFEU routed Ateneo, 88-64, when they first met this season, but the Blue Eagles put up a stronger fight this time around as they got solid contributions from bench players, including Adrian Wong and Aaron Black, even as Jerie Pingoy sat out due to a sprained ankle and Ravena struggled in the first three quarters. \nThe Blue Eagles even led 32-30 at the half thanks in part to Wong, who scored nine points in the first two quarters. They made nine of their 15 free throws in the first half and ended the second quarter on a 10-2 run to take a slim lead. \n\"We struggled defensively, we committed a lot of fouls in the first half. Key players had two fouls or three fouls, so it was hard for us to make adjustments. I think it's good that some of the players we sent it played well defensively,\" Racela said. \nThe Tamaraws started finding their mark from the perimeter in the third quarter, but Ateneo remained on top with Black providing a boost off the bench. A three-pointer by Mike Tolomia with 25 seconds to go sparked their 10-0 run, however, and they took a five-point lead, 54-49, early in the fourth period. \nAteneo got as close as one point twice, at 54-55 and again at 56-57, as Ravena took over in crunch time, but FEU had an answer for every rally. After Ravena's lay-up off an FEU turnover made it 56-57 with 3:42 to go, Mac Belo coolly drained a fadeaway jump shot to push the lead to three points anew. \nThe Blue Eagles were still within striking distance, 61-64, with 36.6 seconds remaining after another lay-up by Ravena, but they resorted to fouling FEU to stop the clock and the Tamaraws were steady at the line to preserve their win. \n\"Struggles will always help us improve,\" Racela noted, \"So we welcome that, kaya lang siyempre, ayaw naman natin na laging nags-struggle.\" \nBelo finished with 12 points, while Russel Escoto and Roger Pogoy both scored 10 as all but two of the players that Racela fielded in scored at least two points. Tolomia had eight points in 18 foul-plagued minutes. \nRavena finished with 15 markers, 11 of which came in the fourth quarter, but missed a lay-up with 20 seconds to go wherein he was blocked by Belo. The reigning MVP again struggled from the field, making only five of his 15 attempts including five of 10 free throws. \nWong had a career-high 14 points for the Blue Eagles, who shot 33.87% from the field. FEU made 35.48% of their shots but dominated the boards, 51-38, and collared 21 offensive rebounds. \nTHE SCORES: \nFEU 66 - Belo 12, Ru.
