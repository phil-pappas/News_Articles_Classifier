Ben Revere led it off with an infield single and Josh Donaldson followed with a two-run blast to put Texas down 2-0. Two outs later, Chris Colabello followed with a solo shot to give the Blue Jays a 3-0 lead. \n\"We didn't think that was going to happen\" said shortstop Elvis Andrus. \"They jumped on us real quick in the first inning and we couldn't stop them. That's what I was praying for, that we could get something going on. Especially in the first two or three innings. It was tough.\" \nMore damage was done in the second inning, though it was minimal. Kevin Pillar launch a solo homer of his own to bring the game to 4-0. \nThree more Blue Jays' runs came in the third, leaving the Rangers trailing by seven. After a walk to Donaldson and double from Jose Bautista, Colby Lewis replaced Holland on the mound. A fielder's choice from Edwin Encarnacion scored Donaldson for the fifth run, while Colabello followed with a double to score Encarnacion. A single from Pillar scored Colabello for the seventh run. \nAll together, six of the runs were allotted to Holland. It was the worst postseason start of his career and came at an inconvenient time. Managed Jeff Banister said after the game that it just seemed like Holland couldn't get his stuff to work the way he wanted to. \n\"From our vantage point, the way things looked, seemed like everything that Derek was throwing was running back towards the middle\" said Banister. \"The sinker continued to run back towards the middle, the change-up, the backdoor breaking ball, and when you cut center pitches you wind up getting hurt.\" \nThe Rangers managed only one run off knuckleballer R.A. Dickey. That one run came in the third after back-to-back singles from Shin-Soo Choo and Adrian Beltre. A wild pitch from Dickey allowed Choo to score. \nToronto tacked on one last run in the seventh with Jake Diekman pitching. Russell Martin doubled then scored on a single from Pillar. \nTexas scored their second run of the game in the bottom of the seventh off David Price. With two outs, Rougned Odor doubled and scored on a single from Robinson Chirinos. \nTwo more runs came off Price came in the eighth, bringing the score to 8-4. Back-to-back singles from Choo and Prince Fielder put two on for Mitch Moreland who hit a groundout to score Choo. A single from Andrus scores Fielder for the final run of the game. \nThe late-inning attempt at a rally will give the Rangers some momentum moving forward, but most importantly it taught them a lesson. They know as a team that they have more success when attacking first, and on Wednesday that's what they are going to need to do. \n\"We're not creating enough opportunities, especially early in the game\" said Andrus. \"We did late, but we have to do that early. Every time we do that early we set the rhythm of the game and the last two nights it hasn't happened. \nAfter taking the early 2-0 lead, losing the next two games can be frustrating. It happened to the Rangers in 2010 against the Tampa Bay Rays and they bounced back to win Game 5. Beltre is confident that his team can bounce back and once again walk away with it. \n\"We'd rather not get to this point that we're at but we're not scared\" said Beltre. \"We know that our team is going to bounce back and going to come back Wednesday ready to win. We're going to give it everything we've got to make it happen. We're not ready to go home yet.\" \nCole Hamels takes the mound on Wednesday in the deciding game of the ALDS. Game time is slated for 3:10 p.m. CT.
