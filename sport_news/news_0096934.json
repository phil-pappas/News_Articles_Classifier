Jones, USA TODAY Sports © Mark J. Rebilas, USA TODAY Sports Mark J. Rebilas, USA TODAY Sports RENTON, Wash. – Though it seems impossible for most of us to disassociate the lead up to the Super Bowl from the New England Patriots’ Deflategate drama, Seattle Seahawks said they were able to keep themselves largely removed from all of it.\nAdChoices That’s because Seahawks players, unlike the rest of us, largely had a media blackout once they arrived in Phoenix. Left tackle Russell Okung said he was completely disconnected from his social media accounts, and only read the financial pages of the Wall Street Journal. Defensive end Cliff Avril held himself to a no-sports television policy.\nFor wide receiver Doug Baldwin, not paying attention just wasn’t that hard, not with an intense schedule of meetings and practices to worry about.\n“It’s not us,” Baldwin said, shrugging.\nIf anything, it just made for an added aggravation during required media availability. That’s when the Patriots problems briefly became the Seahawks’ problem.\n“Now that did get annoying. It was like, ‘OK, for the 10th time,’ I don’t care,” Cliff Avril told USA TODAY Sports on Friday. “I’m a firm believer in control what you can control, so I don’t pay attention to what the other team is going through.”\nIn the months since, Avril did start paying attention to the off-field Deflategate drama, at least enough to form an opinion.\n“It’s cheating still. But even if it’s like, he can grip the ball a little better, you still have to go tackle him. You can’t let a guy score,” Avril said. “But it’s still cheating.”\nFollow Lindsay H.
