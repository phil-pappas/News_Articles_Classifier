The Utes previous best regular-season ranking was No. 5 in 2004. \n— No. 8 Florida has its best rankings since 2012 and No. 12 Michigan has its best since 2013. \nGOING DOWN \n— No. 7 Michigan State slipped three spots from No. 4, the second straight week the undefeated Spartans dropped after a close win against a losing team. \n— No. 19 Oklahoma dropped nine spots after losing to Texas. \n— No. 20 Northwestern fell seven places after being shut out by Michigan. \nOUT \nSouthern California and Georgia both started the season ranked in the top 10 with what seemed like legitimate hopes to reach College Football Playoff. \nSix weeks into the season, both traditional powers are out of the rankings and likely out of the playoff chance. The Trojans flopped on Thursday at home against Washington and the Bulldogs blew a 21-point lead at Tennessee on Saturday. \nGeorgia is out of the rankings for the first time since the end of 2013. \nIN \n— With first-year coach Tom Herman, No. 24 Houston is ranked this week for the first time since the final 2011 Top 25. Those Cougars with coach Kevin Sumlin were 12-0, but lost the Conference USA title game. \n— No. 25 Duke is back after making a brief appearance earlier this season. \nRANKED VS. RANKED \nNo. 8 Florida at No. 6 LSU. The Gators could all but wrap up the SEC East against Heisman front-runner Leonard Fournette. \nNo. 4 Michigan State at No. 12 Michigan. The Spartans have won six of the last seven but that was BH — Before Harbaugh. \nNo. 10 Alabama at No. 9 Texas A&M. The Crimson Tide is tough when it has no room for error. \nNo. 18 UCLA at No. 15 Stanford, Thursday night. The Cardinal have won seven straight against the Bruins. \nNo. 17 Iowa at No. 20 Northwestern. Huge Big Ten West matchup. \n___ \nFollow Ralph D.
