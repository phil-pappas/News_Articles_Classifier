By ROB OESTERLE - roesterle@shawmedia.com \nNow that the calendar has said October for the last couple of weeks or so and the leaves are beginning to turn colors, the thoughts on the local sports scene turns to the postseason. Related Links Oesterle: Full area football coverage not far away \nStarting on the gridiron, if the playoffs were to start today, only Coal City would be in the playoffs among the four local teams, according to the most recent IHSA playoff outlook. But, with two weeks remaining, there still is a distinct possibility that both Morris and Minooka can play their way in. Neither task will be an easy one, however. Morris, with a 3-4 record, has to win its final two games on the road against Sycamore this Friday night and LaSalle-Peru next week. That would give the Redskins a 5-4 record, and they should have plenty of playoff points, or opponent victories, to make the cutoff. \nMeanwhile, Minooka (4-3) has two Southwest Prairie Conference games left, traveling to Oswego East on Friday before finishing up with a home game against Plainfield North next week. The Indians’ playoff point total isn’t nearly as high as Morris’, so the best bet for them will be to win both games to finish with six wins and not have to rely on points. \nThis week’s game against Lisle is also big for Coal City, even though they have four wins and a game with a struggling Seneca squad next week. If the Coalers can beat Lisle this Friday, then the path to six wins looks good and points won’t come into play. \nThe postseason already has begun in boys and girls golf, with regionals taking place last week. Morris and Minooka’s boys teams advanced to Monday’s sectional play, as did the girls teams from Seneca and Minooka. The state finals will be this weekend in Bloomington-Normal for the boys and Decatur for the girls. \nNext on the postseason slate is boys soccer. Newark starts it off at 4:30 p.m. Tuesday in the Class 1A Serena Regional. The Norsemen, seeded second in their sub-sectional of the Peoria Christian Sectional, take on eighth-seeded Plano at 4:30. On Wednesday, Coal City seeded fourth in its sub-sectional of the Iroquois West Sectional, take on fifth-seeded Wilmington at 7 p.m. in the Iroquois West Regional. \nMorris, which is looking for its fifth straight regional title, is seeded sixth in its 10-team sub-sectional of the Washington Sectional, and will take on fourth-seeded Streator on at 6:30 p.m. Oct. 20 in LaSalle-Peru. The winner of the game will take on top-seeded Geneseo for the regional title at 6 p.m. Oct. 23. \nIn Class 3A, Minooka begins play this Friday. The Indians are seeded seventh in the nine-team sub-sectional of the Collinsville Sectional and will play host to eighth-seeded Joliet Central at 4:30 p.m. The winner of the game takes on top seed Normal Community at Joliet West on at 4:30 p.m. Oct. 20. \nIn girls volleyball, Gardner-South Wilmington is hosting a regional that feeds into the Class 1A Streator Woodland Sectional. The Panthers are seeded fourth in the sectional and will play the winner of Tri-Point and Illinois Lutheran at 7 p.m. Oct. 27. The Serena Regional also feeds into the Woodland Sectional. Second-seeded Newark plays the Leland-Ottawa Marquette winner at 6 p.m. Oct. 27. \nIn Class 2A, Seneca, seeded fourth in the Bishop McNamara Sectional, will play the winner of Wilmington and Momence at 6 p.m. Oct. 27 in the Wilmington Regional. \nIn Class 3A, both Morris and Coal City are in the Rich East Regional, which feeds the Lincoln-Way West Sectional. Morris, seeded 13th, plays 20th-seeded Chicago Agricultural Science Oct. 26 at 6 p.m., followed by 12th-seeded Coal City playing 21st-seeded Rich East right after at 7 p.m. The next night, the Morris winner plays fourth-seeded Lincoln-Way West at 6 p.m. and the Coal City winner plays fifth-seeded Chicago Christian at 7 p.m. Minooka is seeded sixth in the Class 4A Lincoln-Way North Sectional and will play the winner of Thornton Fractional South and Bremen at 7 p.m. Oct. 27 in the Lockport Regional. \nIn girls tennis this weekend, Coal City and Morris are part of the nine-team Ottawa Sectional, along with LaSalle-Peru, Mendota, Ottawa, St. Bede, Pontiac, Princeton and Streator. Minooka, meanwhile, plays in the 10-team Plainfield North Sectional, along with Bolingbrook, Joliet Catholic Academy, Joliet West, Neuqua Valley, Plainfield Central, Plainfield East, Plainfield North, Plainfield South and Romeoville. \nCross country will begin running in the regionals on Oct. 24, with the boys and girls at the same sites. In Class 1A, Seneca will host a regional, with the girls at 10 a.m. and the boys at 11. \nThose advancing will run in the Oregon Sectional on Oct. 31. Gardner-South Wilmington will be at the Bishop McNamara Regional with girls at 10 a.m. and boys at 11, with qualifiers running at the Lisle Sectional. \nIn Class 2A, Morris will be at the Crete-Monee Regional, with the girls running at 1:30 p.m. and the boys at 2:30. The qualifiers will move on to the Normal U-High Sectional on Oct. 31 at Maxwell Park, girl at 10 and boys at 11. Minooka hosts a Class 3A regional at Channahon Community Park, with girls at 10 a.m. and boys at 10:45. The qualifiers will be at the Normal Community Sectional on Oct. 31 at Maxwell Park. \nFinally, in girls swimming, the Morris co-op team, featuring swimmers from Morris, Minooka, Coal City and Seneca, will take part in the 13-team Lockport Sectional on Nov. 14.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T06:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T03:08:55.871+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
