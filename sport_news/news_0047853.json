Photo by Rich Lam/Getty Images The Edmonton Oilers picked up a 4-0 preseason win over the Arizona Coyotes on Tuesday night, but the victory came at a cost. On Wednesday, the team announced that forward Jordan Eberle will be out 4-6 weeks after sustaining a shoulder injury.\nEberle collided with the boards behind the net in the first period of Tuesday’s game. He left the contest and did not return.\n\"I left the puck for him and he kind of popped it through the guy's skates,\" said linemate Ryan Nugent-Hopkins . \"Some guy squished him against the boards. I don't know exactly the extent or anything, but it's obviously a big loss for us.”\nEberle led the Oilers in scoring last season, netting 24 goals and 63 points in 81 games. In his five NHL seasons (all with the Oilers), he has scored 120 goals and 284 points in 356 games. The 25-year-old also won gold representing his native Canada at the 2015 World Championships, scoring five goals and 13 points in 10 games.\nThanks to a hat trick from Anton Lander, a tally by Nugent-Hopkins and Ben Scrivens and Anders Nilsson combining for a shutout; Edmonton was still able to skate away with the win. With the victory over the Coyotes, the Oilers move to 6-0-0 in the preseason. They have two preseason contests remaining before opening the regular season on Oct. 8 against the St. Louis Blues. The Oilers finished last season with a record of 24-44-14.", "external_links": ["http://oilers.nhl.com/club/blogpost.htm?id=41585&navid=DL|EDM|home", "http://www.nhl.com/ice/news.htm?id=781148&navid=nhl:topheads", "http://www.nhl.com/gamecenter/en/boxscore?id=2015010072"], "published": "2015-09-30T21:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T00:24:22.372+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
