According to a story from the Los Angeles Times on Sunday, Sarkisian has a history of racking up big bills on alcohol dating back to his days as head coach at the University of Washington.\nL.A. Times columnist Bill Plaschke argued Sunday that USC administration, particularly athletic director Pat Haden, was too slow in proactively working with Sarkisian to get him the help he needs.\n\"This is about leadership,\" Plaschke writes. \"It's time to acknowledge that the Trojans' athletic department has none. By allowing Sarkisian's illness to fester for seven weeks in full view of his players, tearing down a man while tearing up a season, Haden was derelict in his duties. His error in judgment in dealing with the fallout from the 'Salute to Troy' was as bad as Sarkisian's error in judgment at the actual event.\"\nBYU running backs coach Mark Atuaia, a former teammate of Sarkisian, tweeted out his support of him.\n\"For those of us in the profession, the brutality of our \"not-so-stellar-days\" on the job, unfortunately, are manifest for the entire world to see,\" wrote Atuaia. \"He's more than just a professional colleague, but my former teammate and friend — Sark, much love from your Uso (brother) here in Provo. Despite all the shots you're taking from all angles, please know you'll ALWAYS have a friend in me to fight off those demons #bandofbrothers #realfriendsshowupnow #BYU1996\"\nAnother former Cougar Vic So'oto echoed that support.\n. @CoachSark you got support out here in the 801. The adversary is real but you don't gotta fight alone. You're our Brother. #BOB #BYUAlum\n— Vic So'oto (@sooto_vic) October 12, 2015\nESPN debriefs on Utes\nFollowing the fourth-ranked University of Utah's 30-24 win over Cal on Saturday, the ESPN Pac-12 blog addressed the Utes' weekend from a few different perspectives, examining their victory, the impact it had on recruiting and what it means for bowl implications.\nExamining how voters filled out their AP Top 25 ballots, David Lombardi noted that 16 put Utah No. 1, behind only top-ranked Ohio State, while Erik McKinney wrote that the weekend went as well as it could have in recruiting circles. Kyle Bonagura says the Utes are still on track to make the College Football Playoff.\nKevin Love spends time training in Utah\nAfter injuring his shoulder last spring during the NBA Playoffs, Cleveland Cavaliers forward Kevin Love spent part of his summer rehab time in Park City.\nIn a 49-second teaser video released Monday by The Players' Tribune profiling Love's time in the Beehive State, it's noted that spending extended time at high altitude can be good for the blood.\n\"When I go back down to sea level,\" Love said, \"I've been told that you kind of feel like Superman.\"\nA more extended video will be released Oct. 20.\nRyan McDonald is a sports reporter at DeseretNews.com .
