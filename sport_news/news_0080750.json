(AP) - The attorney general's office is launching an investigation over the marketing of prescription opioids by pharmaceutical companies.\nAttorney General Joe Foster says a preliminary review of marketing practices shows some companies may have downplayed the risk of addiction from prescription painkillers and exaggerated the drugs' effects on treating chronic pain.\nThe investigation comes as New Hampshire responds to a heroin and opioid abuse crisis, with addiction often stemming from prescription drug use. The state is also working on changing protocols and guidelines for doctors who prescribe opioids.\nNew Hampshire has launched a number of initiatives aimed at tackling drug addiction, including a plan to provide the opioid antidote Naloxone for free those in need. Officials will discuss details of that program Tuesday afternoon.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T07:56:31.195+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
