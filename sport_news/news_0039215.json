We've played our butt off all year long.\"\nWhen Will Warner hit Nathan Briley for a 66-yard touchdown pass with just over six minutes remaining, the game appeared all but decided. But Austin-East (6-2, 3-1 Region 2-2A) scored twice in the final five minutes on Darius Harper touchdown passes to Kajuan Hale-Ligon and Kashif Warren Jr. of 58 and 19 yards, respectively, to pull within six.\nThe Roadrunners recovered an onside kick with 1 minute, 6 seconds remaining, but Harper's fourth-down heave from near midfield fell incomplete.\n\"We were able to make some plays at the end and make it exciting,\" Austin-East coach Jeff Phillips said. \"At the end of the day, Rockwood made one more play than we did.\"\nThe normally run-oriented Tigers threw a few wrinkles into their wing-T. Warner completed 10 of 15 passes for 209 yards and two touchdowns.\n\"We couldn't just run it all night long,\" Webb said. \"Our tight end (Briley) has been a big target for us all year long and did an outstanding job tonight.\"\nIsiah Jones accounted for three first-half touchdowns for the Tigers, scoring on runs of 9 and 35 yards and catching a 58-yard screen pass. The Tigers' senior rushed for 118 yards on 19 carries.\nRockwood (6-2, 3-1) led 19-14 at the half.\nTrailing for most of the game, Harper passed for 491 yards and three touchdowns, adding another score on the ground. Warren caught nine passes for 198 yards.\n\"We gave ourselves a chance to host a (playoff) game later on in the year,\" said Webb. \"We'll just have to see how it goes.\"\nPatrick Givens is a freelance contributor.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T07:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T07:16:42.175+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
