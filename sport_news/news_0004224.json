He was hit by an 89 mph fastball from Justin De Fratus in the third inning.\nCespedes dropped the bat, shook his hand and fell to the dirt in the batter's box. Mets manager Terry Collins and a trainer rushed from the dugout, and the outfielder exited.\nAcquired at the July 31 trade deadline from Detroit, Cespedes is batting .287 with 17 homers and 44 RBIs in 54 games with the Mets. Overall, he has set career highs this season with 35 home runs and 105 RBIs.\nMany of the large contingent of Mets fans in attendance booed De Fratus. Plate umpire Bob Davidson ruled Cespedes wasn't hit by the pitch, but the call was overturned after the Mets challenged.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
