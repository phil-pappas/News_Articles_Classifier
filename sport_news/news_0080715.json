The Bruins fell to 0-2 on the 2015-16 season on Saturday night at TD Garden, where a weak second period resulted in a 4-2 loss to the Canadiens. The B's, who fell in somewhat similar fashion to Winnipeg on Thursday night, 6-2, close a three-game homestand on Monday with a matinee against defending Eastern Conference champion Tampa Bay, which is 2-0-0. Saturday's key sequence came in the first half of the second period. The Bruins fell behind, 2-0, just 2:15 into the period, when the Canadiens turned a neutral-zone turnover by the line of Matt Beleskey, David Krejci and David Pastrnak into an odd-man rush and a goal for Lars Eller. The Bruins looked as though they'd halved that lead at 6:30, but Loui Eriksson's goal was nullified — despite the first coach's challenge of Claude Julien's career — because of incidental contact Patrice Bergeron made with goalie Carey Price near the crease. Just 77 seconds later, at 7:47, the Canadiens increased their lead to 3-0 on Eller's second goal of the period. This time it came against the line of Jimmy Hayes, Ryan Spooner and Brett Connolly, which was unable to clear the defensive zone after a Tuukka Rask save. The B's did get a break at 14:26, when Beleskey scored his first goal as a Bruin on a deflection off Montreal's Nathan Beaulieu. Beleskey's attempted pass to Pastrnak hit Bealieu's leg, and trickled through Price's pads. A comeback was virtually impossible, though. The Bruins were short-handed for major segments of the third period, including a 5-on-3 disadvantage that included a major penalty assessed to Spooner, who was ejected for boarding Montreal's Brian Flynn. The teams swapped goals in the final minute, with Tomas Plekanec making it 4-1 before Bergeron answered during a power play the B's were awarded after Torrey Mitchell was assessed a match penalty with 38 seconds to play. As was the case in Thursday's opener, the Bruins played well in the first period, but a blip on the screen was enough for them to fall behind: Beleskey had only served 11 seconds of the penalty he took for a check to the head of Montreal defenseman Alexei Emelin when David Desharnais slammed his second whack at an Andre Markov shot past Rask from just off the crease. The goal, scored just 1:25 into the game, came on the Bruins' first short-handed situation of the season, but they were able to kill two penalties before the period ended to stay within 1-0. The B's were outshot 10-8, but hit iron behind Price twice: Torey Krug hit a post and Brad Marchand, after knocking P.K. Subban off a puck, hit the crossbar. Not surprisingly, Julien — still without captain Zdeno Chara because of an upper-body injury — tweaked the lineup in the wake of Thursday's sloppy loss to the Jets.
