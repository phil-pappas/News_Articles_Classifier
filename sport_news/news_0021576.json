When you're not expecting it, it's going to be a harder hit. \n\"He knocked me off. I think he just tried to stop me getting to the ball. It's a free-kick anywhere else, so why not a penalty?\" \nNewcastle continued to make chances even with 10 men, but further goals from full-back Billy Jones - his first for the club - and Fletcher ensured the points remained on Wearside. \nJones said: \"I'm absolutely made-up to score. I always have that self-confidence going up for set-plays that I might get the second ball. I've been close a few times for Sunderland, last year and last week as well. \n\"It's huge for us. It's a derby game, so you want to win to make it six-in-a-row. You want to do it for the fans, do it for the club and have the bragging rights. \n\"But to get our first win of the season is massive and we needed to get that pressure off ourselves.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T15:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T20:23:45.723+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
