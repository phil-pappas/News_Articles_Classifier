Removing 4Q stats from every game, @LSUfball Leonard Fournette would still lead nation in rushing (1,058),rush ypg (176.,3) & rush TDs (14). — Michael Bonnette (@LSUBonnette) October 19, 2015 \nHad Fournette not played in any of the fourth quarters this year (six in total), he'd still lead the nation in rushing touchdowns, rushing yards per game, and total rushing yards. \nLet that sink in for a moment. \nOn the year, the New Orleans native has rushed for 1,202 yards and 14 touchdowns through the first six games of LSU's schedule. He's also running to the tune of an 8.0 yards-per-carry average.

It'd place him fifth all-time in most rushing yards for a single season (behind Barry Sanders, Melvin Gordon, Kevin Smith, and Marcus Allen, respectively). \nFournette could theoretically could still feature in a conference title game, and (potentially) multiple playoff contests. \nHe's truly in the midst of a historic season.
