SIGNAL PEAK — The victory was not a shocker, but it sure was timely. Central Arizona College outlasted South Mountain in Wednesday night’s volleyball match that went the distance, overpowering the Cougars 15-10 in Game 5. The Vaqueras are trying to claim a spot in the Division I Region 1 championship, and the win assured that they’ll at least remain tied with Eastern Arizona with four matches remaining in the regular season. “We’re kind of backed into a corner, and we need to fight if we want to stay in contention for the playoffs,” CAC coach Casey Simon said. The Vaqueras (10-9, 6-6 Arizona Community College Athletic Conference) defeated the Division II Cougars (17-12, 8-5 ACCAC) 25-22 in Games 1 and 3. South Mountain won 25-21 in Games 2 and 4. “We strayed from the game plan in Games 2 and 4,” Simon said. “We stopped being aggressive and allowed them to take the momentum.” That did not happen in Game 5. After the Cougars went ahead 1-0 on Rachel Mugar’s kill, Karson Bisharat ignited a 6-0 CAC run with three kills and a block. The last two points came on Shelby Apodaca’s block and an ace by Savannah Ekis. Another kill by Bisharat started a 7-3 surge that put the Vaqueras up 13-5. That flurry included aces by Bisharat and Wiebke Zink, along with kills by Apodaca, Janet Sauter and Ekis. Ekis delivered her 16th kill on match point. Bisharat had 15 kills for the Vaqueras, followed by Apodaca with 11, Sauter with seven and Jael Jundt with four. Bisharat had five of Central’s 10 blocks, and Jundt served three of the Vaqueras’ 12 aces. Andrea Farnsworth led the Cougars with 15 kills. Audra Dugan had 12 kills and Mugar had 11. Dugan also had six blocks. CAC is 3-0 against South Mountain this season (the first two meetings were nonconference matches), and the Vaqueras won all three in five games. Trailing 20-19 in Game 1, Central outscored the Cougars 6-2 the rest of the way. The last three points came on kills by Ekis, who had five in the game. There were 10 ties and four lead changes in Game 3. Bisharat’s kill put the Vaqueras ahead to stay at 15-14. Apodaca’s kill extended the lead to 23-19, Bisharat’s block made it 24-20, and the game ended on Apodaca’s tip kill. After Apodaca’s kill made it 19-19 in Game 2, Dugan had two kills and a block as South Mountain closed with a 6-2 run. The Cougars went ahead to stay at 16-15 in Game 4 on Dugan’s kill. Mugar’s kill put them ahead 21-17, and their final two points came on kills by Farnsworth. ———", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T20:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T05:57:55.067+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
