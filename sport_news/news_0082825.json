Huh/AP CHICAGO — Rocky Balboa was the fictional pride of Philadelphia, but Cubs manager Joe Maddon is attempting to channel the Italian Stallion as inspiration for his team, which is facing an 0-2 hole against the Mets in the NLCS.\nAdChoices Maddon intentionally blasted the theme from “Rocky” — also known as “Gonna Fly Now” — from his office after the Cubs lost Game 2 on Sunday night at Citi Field. He answered five questions about the comeback/underdog nature of Sylvester Stallone’s famed series of boxing movies during Monday’s off-day press conference.\n“Sometimes it’s polka music, sometimes it’s Rocky,” Maddon joked. “Listen, they beat us, but it’s not nearly over with, and we are really good, as our hashtag (says), #WeAreGood. I have a lot of faith in our guys.\n“They beat us two games. They’ve pitched extremely well. They did. You’ve got to give them credit. The command of their pitches, what they did was spectacular. Give them credit. But I have a real strong belief system in our guys, and I really am here to watch (Tuesday) night’s game. We’ll be ready to play.”\nIn another unorthodox move earlier this season in June, Maddon brought a magician into the clubhouse to perform for his slumping team, citing a need to “lighten things up a little bit.” The former Rays manager said playing the “Rocky” music in the clubhouse was meant to have a similar effect.\n“Part of it is that and part of it is just to let them move this thing along,” Maddon said. “One of my concepts is to win hard for 30 minutes or lose hard for 30 minutes regardless of the time of the year. And of course, Rocky did set a great example in 1976 for all of us.\n“So when you get behind the eight ball a little bit, sometimes you just go pound on some big slabs of beef in the cooler and obviously you come back and you’re fine. So, listen, man, it’s a game, and I’m really impressed with our players. I love the way they’ve handled everything to this moment. I anticipate that we’ll continue to handle it well. We are talented. We’ll show up (Tuesday), and I expect our guys to be ready to play, and that was just the message. Let’s just move it along.”\nMaddon later was reminded by a reporter that while the original “Rocky” won the Oscar for Best Picture in 1976, the title character lost the championship fight to Apollo Creed. Balboa won the fictitious title from Creed in Rocky II, which was released in 1979.\n“It was just about the effort. The effort that he made, that’s all,” Maddon said. “He came back. He came back. Was it ’78? All right. ’76 was my last year in college. I didn’t get my actual degree until 2010. I was on the 35-year plan, and eventually I got my honorary degree from Lafayette. So that’s why I get my years confused so much. Thank you for pointing that out.\n“With Rocky, I was thinking about the comeback component of that, the work that was necessary to get to that moment.”\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.nydailynews.com/", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T12:36:56.591+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
