If you thought Toronto vs. Texas was a match made in promoters’ heaven, just wait for the Blue Jays - Royals rumble that begins tonight for the American League pennant. Toronto and Kansas City are two teams that play new-school baseball, which is to say they have swagger and aren’t afraid to show it, be it chirping at umpires, flipping bats, flipping hitters, kicking up dirt on the base paths with hard slides or celebrating every run as if it’s their last.\nThe Blue Jays best showed their power and emotion in ALDS Game 5 , a rock concert of a game that will be known as The Bat Flip Game in honor of the dig-me pose of Jays rightfielder Jose Bautista upon his series-clinching monster of a homer . The Royals dropped the gauntlet on the league way back in the first month of the season, when they set out to prove their 2014 pennant was no fluke by showing teams they were ready leave the bench and fight if anybody so much as looked at them the wrong way.\nThe worlds of the Jays and Royals collided in mid-summer, when a chippy series finally went ka-boom . Kansas City righthander Edinson Volquez hit Toronto third baseman Josh Donaldson with a 94-mph sinker in the first inning on Aug. 2, in a series in which Donaldson already had seven RBIs and Lorenzo Cain and Mike Moustakas of Kansas City and Troy Tulowitzki of Toronto had been drilled.\nWarnings were issued, though that didn’t stop Volquez, two innings later, from throwing an 0–1 changeup past Donaldson’s chin. (One way to claim innocence when throwing at a hitter is to throw something with less velocity.) Toronto manager John Gibbons was ejected for arguing that Volquez should have been tossed.\nThe postgame comments only fueled the rivalry. Volquez said Donaldson “was crying like a baby.\" Donaldson said he was happy the umpires didn’t eject Volquez, saying, “He was pretty good hittin’, so I’m glad they didn’t.”\nYour browser does not support iframes.\nRoyals manager Ned Yost seemed to blame the Toronto hitters. “They’ve got tremendous power, but they all dive in to the plate, which makes them susceptible to getting hit on inside pitches,” Yost said. “If you continue to throw them away, away, away, away, you’re going to get hammered, you’re going to get killed. You have to utilize the inside part of the plate to open up the outside part of the plate, and it happens.”\nAnd that led Bautista to respond the way any new-school baseball adherent would: a snipe via Twitter.\n“Just heard #NedYost comments about the game. Lost a lot of respect for that man today,” Bautista tweeted.\nHmmm. So what we have in the ALCS is a matchup in which the Royals’ Game 1 starter drilled the Jays’ third baseman with a pitch and called him a “crybaby,” to which the third baseman called him “good hittin’”, to which the pitcher’s manager blamed it on the Jays’ hitters, to which one of Toronto's hitters announced he had lost respect for the manager.\nMLB Video ALCS preview: Royals-Blue Jays is evenly matched battle for pennant by Cliff Corcoran", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T10:02:45.419+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
