After losing last week, we had something to prove.”\nVista Murrieta (4-1) led 36-21 with three minutes to go, but St. Augustine (4-2) rallied for a dramatic finish.\nTariq Thompson pulled in a 9-yard touchdown catch with one minute left to make it 36-28. The Saints' onside kick went through the arms of a slew of Broncos returners, and the St. Augustine recovered on its own 46.\nThree plays later, on fourth-and-14 at the Vista Murrieta 41, Saints quarterback Rodney Thompson completed a Hail Mary to a wide open Jalen Baker to make it 36-34 with five seconds remaining.\nAfter letting St. Augustine back in the game Vista Murrieta's defense made the big play it had to, as Mitchell broke across the line and dropped Sims for a loss on the conversion attempt to secure up the victory.\nVista Murrieta never trailed despite the wild finish, although it missed multiple chances to pull away. The Broncos led 14-0 in the first quarter, 24-14 in the third and 36-21 in the fourth and allowed the Saints back in it each time, but ultimately made just enough plays to hold on.\n“I think it's good for your team to have to deal with adversity and learn how to win a tight game,” Vista Murrieta coach Coley Candaele said. “We made it interesting, but we made the stop when we needed to.”\nRunning back Cole Dubots , who missed the last two games with a neck injury, rushed for 111 yards and two touchdowns to lead the offense.\nHis 56-yard touchdown run on the Broncos' first possession put them in front early, and the junior added a 5-yard score late in the third quarter.\n“I was extremely ready to play today,” Dubots said. “Two weeks off is not what I like. I need to be in the game and that was the job I needed to do.”\nKyle Williams was held in check at wide receiver but moved to quarterback in the fourth quarter and rushed for 106 yards and a touchdown, all in about eight minutes. Freshman defensive lineman Keyon Ware-Hudson jumped a screen pass for an interception and return it 7 yards for a touchdown with 3:05 to go, ultimately the decisive score.\nContact the writer: kglaser@pe.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T15:19:03.719+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
