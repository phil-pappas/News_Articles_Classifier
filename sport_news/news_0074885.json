They run a spread offense so we’ll have to be ready on defense. It will be nice to be at home, though.”\nThe Hoyas are looking to knock off an Ivy League team for a second consecutive week, after last week’s 24-16 win over Columbia.\n“I think Georgetown is a good team on offense. They return pretty much all their skilled players. But up front they have a lot of young players and they’ve been having issues, so maybe that’s a place where we can take advantage,” said Koran.\nHarvard defeated Georgetown, 34-3, a year ago in Washington. Thus far, in 2015, the Ivies have gone 4-4 against teams from the Patriot League.\nThe Hoyas’ big connection this season has been senior quarterback Kyle Nolan (87-of-148 passing) finding junior Justin Hill (18 catches, 292 yards) for four touchdowns. Georgetown also features two Bay State products on its roster in senior wide receiver Harrison Glor of Boston and Belmont Hill, where he won 13 varsity letters, and sophomore running back Alex Valles of Danvers. Valles made his first career carry last year against Harvard.\nNo. 24 Harvard (2-0, 1-0) has won 16 straight games, the second-longest active streak in Division 1 after Ohio State’s 17. The Crimson has won 12 consecutive games against nonconference foes. Harvard pummeled Brown, 53-27, a week ago for its 12th straight Ivy League win. It was the most points scored by the Crimson against its rival from Providence since the initial series meeting in 1893. Harvard has now scored points in a Ivy record 170 consecutive games.\n“Last week, the defense was playing lights out. Coach (Scott) Larkee always does a real good job of getting everyone in the program ready,” said Koran, crediting the Crimson defensive coordinator. “We have a lot of returning veterans and I don’t think we’ve hit our stride yet.”\nDuring that win, Harvard took the reins off freshman running back Noah Reimers, who scored the first two touchdowns of his career on scampers of 16 and 27 yards before finishing with eight carries for 60 yards. Senior quarterback Scott Hosch, who already has thrown for six touchdowns in two weeks, hit three against the Bears on tosses of 4, 12 and 25 yards.\nLast season, Harvard led FCS in points per game (12.3) and ranked second in tackles for loss (3.5 per game) and the group has picked up where it left off — holding Rhode Island to 10 points in the season opening 41-10 win before demolishing Brown last week in a game that featured two safeties by the Harvard defense.\n“A very solid effort across the board,” said Harvard coach Tim Murphy, who is chasing his 150th victory with the Crimson. “We need to keep that going this week against a rejuvenated Georgetown team that beat Columbia on the road.\n“They’ve been an opponent for a couple of years now and people ask me, ‘Why Georgetown?’ It makes sense to us. It’s a great recruiting area. It has a great alumni base. Obviously, a very strong athletic program. Obviously, a very strong academic institution. So, for all those reasons. It makes it a no-brainer for us.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T09:21:21.807+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
