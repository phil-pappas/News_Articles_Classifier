According to Indian media reports, Shiv Sena activists waving placards of ‘Shahryar Khan, Go Back’ crashed through the gates of the office in Mumbai's Wankhede Stadium that serves as the headquarters of the BCCI in India. They entered BCCI chief Shashank Manohar's office and crowded around his desk, shouting slogans and appearing determined to stop him from meeting the Pakistan cricket board chief to discuss a bilateral series in December. Later speaking to the media, the PCB chief said he is visiting India at BCCI’s invitation. Besides meeting the new BCCI President Shashank Manohar, Shahryar Khan and Najam Sethi were also expected to meet Secretary Anurag Thakur along with other government officials in New Delhi. Sethi, who heads the Pakistan Super League project, will also be officially asking the Indian board to allow some of their players to appear in the league scheduled for next February in Dubai and Sharjah.
