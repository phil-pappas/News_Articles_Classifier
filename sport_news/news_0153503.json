Jays’ GM Alex Anthopoulos believed it was less luck than a matter of being prepared via an off-season of accumulating depth to cover just such situations.\nFinishing up his sixth season as Jays’ general manager, the 38-year-old Montrealer sees this success as part of a personal evolution, of learning the ropes of being a major-league GM, especially his winter decision to leave $8 million in payroll that had already been approved by ownership, to put it aside for the July trade deadline. It created flexibility and confidence that he would indeed be able to fill holes and make changes according to team needs, at the halfway mark. It’s how he could afford to take on David Price, following the salary neutral Jose Reyes for Troy Tulowitzki deal with the Rockies.\n“We knew we were going to have flexibility,” Anthopoulos explained. “We had prospect capital. We had the assets. We also had the financial flexibility to do some things, as well, and not deviate. What we spent was what we had in the off-season. We just didn’t choose to spend it all at once. In the off-season we just spent on what we felt strongly about. Otherwise we didn’t take a lot of fliers.”\nAnthopoulos recalled the hard lessons learned in the off-season of 2012 when he missed out on a trade for a closer that he thought had been agreed upon, then went out and spent that leftover money before opening day, just because he had it in his pocket. Never again.\n“We did it with Francisco Cordero (in ’12),” Anthopoulos said. “We had a trade for Koji Uehara and we were not planning on pursuing Cordero. I think he had turned down two-times ($8 million) from the Mets and Frank Francisco got two-times ($6 million). So (Cordero) is sitting out there at one-year ($4.5M) and we talked ourselves into it, because we knew that we had the money.”\nThat was one factor. Here are some of the devastating injuries that, at the time seemed destined to take the Jays away from any chance of contending, but eventually turned out well.\nMarcus Stroman: The future Jays’ ace tore his ACL in a freak injury early in spring training and was declared out for the year. It meant that Aaron Sanchez was definitely going to have to start, a decision that would open the door for two 20-year-olds to make the roster, Roberto Osuna and Miguel Castro. Castro became a key part of the Tulowitzki deal, while Osuna is the Jays’ closer. If not for the Stroman injury, Osuna would not have had his opportunity. And now they have Stroman back.\nBrendan Kennedy\nBlue Jays outfielder Michael Saunders, who has been rehabbing a knee injury suffered ahead of spring training, has now been shut down for the season.\nMichael Saunders: When the Victoria, B.C. native tore his meniscus on an exposed sprinkler head the day before full squad reported in February, it allowed Kevin Pillar an opportunity to be the starting left-fielder. When Saunders returned to action in late April, Pillar moved to centre field and posted the second highest defensive WAR to the Rays’ Kevin Kiermaier. When Saunders was shut down again, the collection of less-than-stellar defensive fill-ins, including Chris Colabello, demonstrated the need for a defensive left-fielder. That led Anthopoulos to acquire Ben Revere.\n“Pillar played well at the end of last year,” Anthopoulos said. “He made some changes, some adjustments and his swing was unbelievable. I remember telling him, we had our meeting at spring training, I was saying, hey, everyone’s talking about Pompey and we like Dalton, but this is a competition. You have a chance to win this thing. The fact that the kids had an opportunity.”\nMaicer Izturis: The Jays had a guaranteed commitment to the veteran Izturis in the final year of his free agent deal. The plan was to ease rookie Devon Travis in, send him to AAA-Buffalo for a month and then bring him up. But Izturis was hurt, as was veteran invitee Ramon Santiago. Travis became the opening day second baseman and the rookie of the month of April. It became best case.\nMore infield. When Jose Reyes was injured, Ryan Goins got a chance to impress Gibbons with the importance of great defence. When Travis was injured, Goins moved over to second base and eventually, with thoughts of how much of a difference defence up the middle can make, Anthopoulos was able to make the Reyes for Tulowitzki deal and the team took off up through the standings.\nSteve Russell\nAaron Sanchez throws in the ninth inning as the Toronto Blue Jays beat the Boston Red Sox 6-1 at the Rogers Centre in Toronto on September 18, 2015. Steve Russell/Toronto Star\nAaron Sanchez: The talented right-hander suffered a strained right lat injury in his best start of the season to date, in early June. As he was rehabbing in the minors in July and the trade deadline approached, the Jays were able to make the decision to bring Sanchez back as a late-innings reliever and that immediately solidified the bullpen. Even that injury had turned into a team positive.\nThe reason Anthopoulos was able to do that was because he had kept his war-chest of extra payroll set aside and was confident that he was going to get a starter to fill in for Sanchez at the trade deadline. He just didn’t know it was going to be Price until Tigers GM Dave Dombrowski called him late in the afternoon of July 29. If he didn’t save the money, Sanchez would be starting again.\n“We felt there was more options (for starters),” the GM explained. “We had been trying to make trades all summer, but I guess we felt that we would come away with a starter. We didn’t know who, but a starter or two. We felt there were enough guys out there who were in play. If you look back at how many got moved, a bunch got moved: (Mike) Fiers, Price, (Mike) Leake, (Scott) Kazmir, (Mat) Latos. (J.A.) Happ got moved. We had talked about him for a while. So we just thought Sanchez could be dominant late-inning and we needed that depth.”\nThen of course, to top it all off was the return to health of Stroman after doctors had predicted he was out for the year. But as the 5-8 Stroman says: “Height doesn’t measure heart.” Yes it was a series of potential disasters that turned around and sees the Jays ready for a legitimate World Series run.\nMore on thestar.com\nSepp Blatter facing suspension amid criminal investigation\nFIFA suspends Sepp Blatter and Michel Platini for 90 days", "external_links": ["http://static.freeskreen.com/publisher/52/freeskreen.min.js"], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T14:21:05.055+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
