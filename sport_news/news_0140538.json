(AP Photo/Denis Poroy) \nBEREA, Ohio (AP) — The Browns are still a little jumpy over an offside call late in last week’s loss at San Diego. \nCornerback Tramon Williams was penalized when he appeared to beat the snap before Chargers rookie kicker Josh Lambo pushed his 39-yard field-goal attempt to the right. The ball was moved 5 yards closer and Lambo drilled a 34-yarder after time expired for a 30-27 win. \nBrowns special teams coordinator Chris Tabor said Thursday that he believes Williams timed the snap perfectly and did not commit a penalty. Browns coach Mike Pettine would not divulge what the NFL told the team regarding its review of the contentious play. \nLeague spokesman Michael Signora said it did not have the right angle of the play and its video is inconclusive. \nWilliams said discussing the matter now is irrelevant since the Browns lost. \n___ \nAP NFL website: www.pro32.ap.org and http://twitter.com/AP_NFL Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T23:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T00:27:01.452+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
