October 25th 2015 an hour ago /video/video.news.com.au/Sport/Cricket/Highlights/ \nSouth Australia has set New South Wales a target of 222 to win in the Matador Cup final at North Sydney Oval. \nAfter losing the toss and being sent into bat, the Redbacks got off to an awful start, losing Travis Head for one in the first over to a Mitchell Starc yorker. \nThe South Australia skipper was joined by Tim Ludeman in the sheds five overs later, with the opener caught in the slips off Josh Hazlewood for seven. ODD2015-160301 \nThe wicket of Head saw Starc equal Shane Harwood for the scalps most in a one-day domestic season, but he didn’t break the record until the 46th over when he knocked over Joe Mennie for nine. He took his wicket-tally for the season to 26 with the scalp of Kane Richardson four balls later. \nStarc and the Blues were made to toil for much of the innings thanks to a 154-run stand from centurion Tom Cooper (105) and Callum Ferguson. \nFerguson made a patient 61 from 87 before falling to Stephen O’Keefe (1-53), triggering a batting collapse. From 3-166 in the 37th over, the Redbacks were all out in the 47th.
