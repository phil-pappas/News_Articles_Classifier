It’s time-consuming and frustrating. But it’s not as much frustration for us as it is for the individual. I mean, you stop and think about an 18-year-old kid that he comes from Africa and been here for 3 1⁄2 years and does what he’s asked to do, and all of a sudden he’s got goals, he’s got dreams, he’s got all these things that are hinging on this, and find out that that may not ever come to be. Press Conferences & Post-Game Interviews Bill Self discusses upcoming season, Cheick Diallo’s situation \nKansas basketball coach Bill Self answers questions about the coming season, freshman Cheick Diallo’s eligibility and the Jayhawks’ potential at KU’s annual media day. \n“There’s a lot of stress involved, a lot of stress, and, sure, we want to win games, but that’s not more important than what’s in the best interest of the young man. We’ve had other cases where this has happened, where it didn’t work out great for us or the youngster, i.e. Ben and Jamari (McLemore and Traylor ineligible for year), and then we’ve had other cases where it has worked out good for us (Morris twins, Brandon Rush) and the student-athlete, and this one is one that we’re hopeful, obviously, but we’ll get a fair ruling on it.” \nIs there a timeline for this? \n“Not really, but it’s not a negative thing because part of the sense is we’re still gathering and presenting stuff to them (NCAA),” Self said. “Can’t really give a decision if you don’t have the information in front of you. We hope it’s sooner rather than later.” \nFans have shot at $10K \nTwo Kansas basketball fans will have the opportunity to win $10,000 from Self at the 2015 Late Night in the Phog, a week from today in Allen. \nOne male and one female present will be randomly selected to each attempt two half-court shots. Should they make one of the two attempts, Self will write a $10,000 check made out to them on the spot. Additionally, should the contestant not want to shoot, she/he can choose anyone in the facility, other than a current KU player or recruit, to shoot on their behalf. Only high school graduates or older will be eligible to participate. \n“I hope they both win,” Self said. \n“This event is for our fans who come from all over to get a first look at our team, and this is a way to give a couple of them a chance to walk away with some cash.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T08:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T09:24:04.864+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
