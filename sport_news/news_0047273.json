The rookie left-hander threw about 90 pitches in a simulated Instructional League game Thursday in Florida to test himself and followed up with a long-toss session Friday.\nMatz figures to be in the mix as a starter for a possible Game 4 next week.\nManager Terry Collins wouldn't commit to Game 1 starter Jacob deGrom returning on three days' rest.\n\"It all depends a lot on tonight,\" Collins said before the game. \"If he goes deep into a game, if he has to work hard, he probably won't come back on three days' rest. This kid's never done it in his whole career. When you're asking young guys to do things that they've never done before, you can set yourself up for some failure.\"\nThe roster includes six infielders and six outfielders, two catchers and 11 pitchers.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
