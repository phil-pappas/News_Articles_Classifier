Carroll also forced a fumble by running back Rashad Jennings.\nUnsung hero Philadelphia linebacker DeMeco Ryans stemmed the Giants early momentum with an interception of a Manning pass in the first quarter as the Giants looked as if they were driving toward a second score. Ryans also recovered the fumble by Jennings that Carroll forced.\nZero Giants quarterback Eli Manning looked terrible after the opening series, throwing two interceptions, one of which was returned for a TD, fumbling once and getting called for two intentional-grounding penalties.\nKey stat 3 : Turnovers the Giants committed in a span of 14 offensive plays in the first half.
