Despite the Tampa Bay Lightning coming quite close to winning the Stanley Cup last season — all games in the finals against Chicago were one-goal games with the exception of a 2-0 Cup-clinching Game 6 — the Flyers say they aren't intimidated by their competition . In fact, starting on the road may benefit them and keep them from the distractions of being at home. \n2. Sean Couturier had a career year in goals last season with 15, but the Flyers were hoping for more offense out of him. After spending four years as a defensive center, he and the team are hoping for a turnaround . Linemate Wayne Simmonds knows about being pigeonholed into a certain role. He got out of it and is hoping Couturier can, too. \n3. The Tampa Bay Lightning got to Game 6 of the Stanley Cup finals last season and are trying to get back. Here's the thing as the NHL opens another season: nothing is guaranteed. \n\"The odds are really stacked against us,\" general manager Steve Yzerman told the Tampa Bay Times . \"There's no guarantee we're getting back. I think 29 other teams would disagree with it being our turn.\" \n4. Where are the Flyers heading this season? With not much different on their roster from last season, they appear likely to be the same place they were last season — on the outside of the playoff picture looking in on a tough division . As for who will be in on the next run for the Stanley Cup, here are Dave Isaac's playoff picks for the 2015-16 season . \n5. If things go wrong in Tampa Thursday, or any night this season, really, look out for what those in North Dakota call the \"Hakstol Stare.\" Some of Dave Hakstol's college players, like Chris VandeVelde, are all too familiar with it. Here's some more insight on what Hakstol brings to the NHL after 11 seasons at the University of North Dakota. \n“He is a great man,” said Brad Berry, his successor at UND. “When I worked underneath him, he gave you the authority to control parts of the game that each coach had and he was very, very open to input from other coaches. From that standpoint, it was kind of a team effort from everybody as far as coaches putting in the time. As far as personality-wise, he’s very business-like, very personable with everybody. Very humble and down to earth.” Read or Share this story: http://on.cpsj.com/1RvzWq1 Most Popular", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T15:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T20:40:04.864+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
