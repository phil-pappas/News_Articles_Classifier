When the dust settled, he crossed the finish line with the best time still of one hour, 14 minutes and 46 seconds. \nThough slower compared to the 1:13:10 clocking he posted last year, Tillor's time was still good enough for him to qualify for the National Finals that will be staged for the first time in Angeles City, Pampanga on December 6. \n\"I was able to endure an upset stomach in the last 10 kilometers of the race because of my desire to win. Though not my personal best, I'm still happy having claimed back-to-back titles,\" said Tillor, a mechanic who also dabbles as part-time running coach. \nWhat made Tillor's triumph more sweeter is that he was the only runner in the men's division to breach the cut-off of time of 1:15:00, earning him an all-expense paid trip to the grand finals courtesy of the organizing Milo Philippines.   \nTillor was trailed by Narceso Deterala of Leyte with a time of 1:16:36, while former regional champion Adonis Singson could only make it to third place in 1:17:29. \nRounding up the top 10 cast were Jerry Adap(1:18:11), Florendo Lapiz (1:19:00), Michael Largo (1:19:04), John Darryl Manos (1:19:11), Andy Toniacao(1:20:37), Azlan Pagay (1:21:22) and Rolly Omnos(1:21:24). \nIn the distaff side, Sorongon stood the proudest among the podium finishers with the fastest time of 1:29:05. She stunned Miscelle Gilbuena, a veteran runner from the Philippine Air Force, who placed second in 1:29:05. \nLike Tillor, both Sorongon and Gilbuena will get a free trip to the Angeles finale for completing the race under the cut-off time of 1:35:00 in the women's category. \nCompleting the top 10 list in the women's 21K were Lizane Abella (1:42:58), Sandra Soliano (1:45:40), Virginia Parajenog (1:51:38), Wilma Theresa Lugay (1:52:43), Daisy Batac (1:53:45), Anita Balaga (1:57:44), Tessie Escarinas (1:58:15) and Margarette Jaranilla (1:58:36). \nAmong the top 10, Escarinas caught past of the spotlight because even if she will be turning 59 years old already or just one year shy from being a 'senior citizen' this October 28, she still has the strength to be among the best and even qualify for the national finals under her age-group. \nA total of 104 runners out of the 771 entries in the 21K qualified for the finals, but only Tillor, Sorongon and Gelbuena will enjoy an all-expense paid trip. \nIn the 3K battle participated in not only by kids aged 12 years old and under but also by a fleet of adults, Joseph Antiola came out the fastest with the time of 11 minutes and 34 seconds. \nJay Rey Gaerlan was just one second behind Antiola, while Carl Jhon Beboso landed at third in 11:42. The top three in the girls side were Jessel Ochia (12:00), Michelle Beboso (12:07) and Catherine Angeli Yu (12:23). \nIn the 5K action, Maryjoy Loberanis, the most bemedalled runner in the Milo Little Olympics, and John Cliff Debulosan topped their division with a 18:58 and 16L14 clockings, respectively. \nPrince Joey Lee, on the other hand, finally got the men's 10K plum he missed last year after clocking in 33:22, way ahead of Franie Canumay (35:52) and Riez Enriquez (37:01). The top three among female contenders were Geneda Arcuino (42:35), Lovely Fe Andrin (44:05), and Melody Perez (48:03). \nIn the equally-exciting sidelights, the Cebu Technological University bagged the biggest delegation award with 2,412 entries, while the University of the Visayas emerged as the fastest contingent with an average time of 29:10. In the inter-company, Accenture go the biggest delegation award with 157. \nUV also ruled the cheerdance contest in the tertiary level, while Mabolo Elementary School and Zapatera National High School lorded it over their respective classes. \nMeanwhile, Cebu leg organizer Ricky Ballesteros credited the success of the race due to the concerted effort of all sectors involved. Though second only to Manila in terms of the biggest number of participants, race technical director Rio de la Cruz gave his seal of approval to Cebu being the best organized leg, so far. \n\"One of the Japanese runners who joined really liked the race that he promised me they will come back next year. That itself speaks of how smooth is this year's race,\" said Ballesteros.
