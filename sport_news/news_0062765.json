(AP) â€” The Philadelphia Eagles announced that left tackle Jason Peters wouldn't return to return to Sunday night's game at Carolina with what was described as lower back spasms.\nThe seven-time Pro Bowler was blocking Jared Allen when he crumpled to the grass with 5:21 left in the opening quarter, remaining face down until medical staffers could come to his aid.\nTeammates gathered around him as he was loaded onto a cart and several came by to speak with him before he headed to the tunnel for X-rays.\nHe was originally questionable to return, but was ruled out by early in the third quarter.\nCarolina pass rusher Mario Addison also left midway through the third with a right shoulder injury and was doubtful to return.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
