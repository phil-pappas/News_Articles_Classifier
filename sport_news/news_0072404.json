(AP) - The Mississippi State Fair Commission is suing the city of Jackson to try to force the police department to provide security and traffic control outside the fairgrounds.\nThe 12-day state fair starts Wednesday.\nThe Clarion-Ledger reports ( http://on.thec-l.com/1JKHPBt ) the commission filed a complaint Friday in Hinds County Chancery Court, and a hearing is set for Tuesday.\nJackson Police announced this year it wouldn't provide help during the State Fair because of city budget cuts. Police Chief Lee Vance says Jackson typically pays about $320,000 in personnel and overtime costs for the annual event.\nIn previous years, Jackson has provided up to 70 police officers to help with State Fair security.\nThe Hinds County Sheriff's Department still plans to provide protection this year on the fairgrounds, near downtown Jackson.\nInformation from: The Clarion-Ledger, http://www.clarionledger.com\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
