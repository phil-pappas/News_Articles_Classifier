As a promoter I can only promote what you give me and if that isn't up to standard, people aren't going to buy.\" \nAllen added: \"I've said that people don't come to watch guys looking at data screens. Fans want to see gladiators racing and fighting it out in a fair fight. \n\"Nobody wants to hear drivers getting told to 'lift', 'coast' or 'we're not going to catch the guy in front, settle for second'. \n\"I think it is criminal when we have got to that state of racing and that is not saleable. I think Bernie is as frustrated with it as we all are. \n\"How long is it before the technical director is stood on the top step, not the driver? You've just got to throw the towel in then and look for something else.\" \nAllen's comments ahead of this week's Russian Grand Prix come after Ecclestone claimed the sport could be under new ownership by the end of the year. \nIt was reported over the summer that CVC Capital Partners, the private equity firm which has owned F1 for the last 10 years, was in talks with a US-Qatari bid to sell its 35.5 per cent controlling stake, while Ecclestone confirmed he would sell his five per cent stake as part of any deal. \nAnd when asked on Tuesday about those negotiations, the 84-year-old told the Camp Beckenbauer Global Summit in Austria: ''There has been a lot of interest and I would say there are three parties at the moment where I would be surprised if one of them did not buy them (the shares) shortly.'' \nQuizzed on what kind of timeframe in which he would expect to see a new owner in F1, Ecclestone said: ''This year.''
