Let's just take one drive. To try and explain the wonder of Paxton Lynch.\nThis particular drive began in the second half, when Memphis fans were starting to feel a little bit nervous. Tulsa had scored on a Hail Mary to end the first half and avert a rout, and had scored on an 80-yard strike to draw within a single touchdown.\nSo, yes, Memphis fans were starting to fret, just a little. Until Lynch went back to work.\nFirst, he fired a sweet back-shoulder pass to Mose Frazier for 30 yards.\nNext, he threw a block to help spring Jamarius Henderson for a 28-yard ramble to the 4-yard line.\nFinally, he rolled right, looked for a receiver, kept rolling, and finally decided to keep the ball, and beat the Tulsa defense to the flag for a touchdown.\nSo there it was, the complete package. The arm, the leadership, the mobility. The wonder of Paxton Lynch.\nHe is the single biggest reason the Tigers defeated Tulsa 66-42 to raise their record to an impeccable 7-0. He is also the best quarterback in the country, and I'm not sure it's close.\nThat's right, the best. You can have your Trevon Boykins and your Seth Russells and your Jared Goffs. I'll take the 6-7 guy who is redefining a whole program with his excellence, and is the difference between victory and defeat every time out.\nIt happened again Friday, on another national stage. All day long, ESPN talking heads were debating the merits of the Memphis Tigers. Could the Tigers really run the table? Might they really be a playoff threat?\nOr, as spelled out in big letters on ESPN's Pardon The Interruption: \"Is it time to take Memphis seriously?\"\nThe answer is \"Yes.\" Because how can you dismiss a program that is led by a quarterback that is better than any you will find in the SEC? How can you disregard a team that is led by a future pro who can seemingly do whatever is required to produce a win?\nAgainst Kansas, that meant throwing for a career-high 354 yards and two touchdowns.\nAgainst Bowling Green, that meant throwing for a career-high 386 yards and three touchdowns.\nAgainst Cincinnati, that meant throwing for a career high 412 yards and two touchdowns.\nAgainst Ole Miss, that meant throwing for 372 yards and two touchdowns.\nSo, no, the Ole Miss game wasn't a career high. But Tulsa certainly was. Lynch completed 32 of 44 passes for 447 yards and four touchdowns, and caused yet another press box of cynical journalists to react with slack-jawed amazement at what they were seeing.\nIt's astonishing, to watch it unfold. It happens in nearly every new press box these days. It's a lot like it was when DeAngelo Williams was on the team. Back then, reporters would gasp — actually gasp — when they first saw Williams break off a run. Now, they do the same when they see Lynch unleash a throw.\nSo you should have heard them when Lynch fired a rocket to Tevin Jones for the first score.\nAnd then again when he dropped a perfect pass to Anthony Miller for a 45-yard touchdown.\nAnd then again when he threw a perfect ball to Mose Frazier for 45 yards to the 1.\nTweeted George Schroeder, of USA Today: \"Paxton Lynch is easily the most talented passer I've seen in person this season.\"\nHe's easily the most talented passer who anyone has seen in person this season. And as more people see him — in person or otherwise — this truth is becoming harder to ignore.\nBy the end of the evening, NFL fans from Washington to Chicago were tweeting about the Memphis quarterback. The words \"Paxton Lynch\" were trending in Philadelphia.\nESPN commentator Mack Brown may have had some trouble pronouncing the name of the Memphis coach — he went with three syllables, Foo-en-tay — but he didn't have any trouble proclaiming Lynch the best quarterback he's seen.\nSo Memphis won another one. The undefeated dream stays alive. And as long as Lynch is lining up at quarterback, it may well never end.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T08:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T10:42:08.166+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
