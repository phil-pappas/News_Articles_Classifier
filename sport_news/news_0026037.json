Brown can elect free agency. \nBrown was an All-Star in 2013 but struggled since. He even had an inglorious finish to his 2015 season. It ended prematurely when he suffered a concussion Sept. 2 at Citi Field when he flipped over the low wall down the right field line after he failed to make a catch. \nThe 28-year-old Brown, a 20th-round pick of the organization in 2006, hit .228 with a .634 OPS, five home runs and 25 RBIs in 63 games this season. After hitting 27 home runs and recording 83 RBIs in 540 plate appearances during his All-Star season in 2013, Brown combined for only 15 homers and 88 RBIs in 716 total plate appearances since. \nConcussion issues have plagued Joseph's career since he joined the organization. Joseph, 24, was the Phillies' primary acquisition in the trade that sent Hunter Pence to the San Francisco Giants at the deadline in 2012. Joseph has played in only 149 minor league games over his 3.5 seasons in the Phillies' organization.
