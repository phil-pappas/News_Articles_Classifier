Fitch Ratings on Monday lowered the rating on $26 billion in general obligation bonds from A- to BBB+. That's a few levels above what's considered \"junk\" status. Fitch cited lawmakers' failure to pass a budget for the July 1 fiscal year, above-average debt and \"exceptionally high\" unfunded pension liabilities. Catherine Kelly, a spokeswoman for Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner, said he is fighting to \"put the state on the path to fiscal health,\" but the Democrat-led legislature is standing in his way. Rikeesha Phelon, a spokeswoman for Democratic Senate President John Cullerto, said Illinois can't afford for Rauner \"to prioritize his corporate class agenda over basic budget math and governing.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T00:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T01:53:03.641+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
