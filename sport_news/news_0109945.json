(Adam Wesley/The Gazette) Most Popular October 9, 2015 | 11:07 pm \nIOWA CITY — If at first you don’t score a touchdown, try again. \nOliver Martin and Iowa City West did just that Friday night in a 63-27 Class 4A District 7 win over Dubuque Hempstead. West improved to 2-5 overall, 2-0 in district play. Hempstead fell to 5-2, 1-1. \nDenied the end zone on a big punt return late in the first half, Martin responded by returning a punt 79 yards for a touchdown early in the second half. \n“We’ve got playmakers, we just need to get them the ball,” said Trojans head coach Garret Hartwig. \nLater in the half, Martin was stopped on a loss of six yards. The next play, Trojans quarterback Alex Henderson bought a little time and hit Martin for a 75-yard touchdown catch. \n“The key for our guys is to just make it simple and play fast,” Hartwig said. “Just let them do what they do and stay out of the way.” \nBig plays dominated the first half for West. Devontae Lane opened the game with a 79-yard kickoff return for a touchdown. Just three minutes later, Henderson connected with Martin on a 67-yard touchdown pass to put the Trojans up 14-0. \n“Those two (Henderson and Martin) are incredible athletes,” Hartwig said. “They’ve been in big games their whole life and are used to making plays. \nThe Mustang defense kept their composure and held the Trojans to just 36 yards rushing in the first half. After the long touchdown pass early, the Mustangs contained the Trojans to just 97 yards passing. \nThe Hempstead offense found a groove in the passing game. Cole Muehring completed his first five passes for 80 yards. Tay Collins got the Mustangs on the board with a 28-yard touchdown run. \n“We made some good throws and some good catches,” said Hempstead head coach Bob McIntyre. “We had some good yards after the catch.” \nHempstead continued to battle in the second half, but the Trojans offense was just too much.
