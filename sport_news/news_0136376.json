In both of Wednesday night’s ALDS Games 5, the home team and team that won Game 4 was the victor. However, each ALDS had an additional factor not present in this series. The Astros ' loss to the Royals was a dead-team-walking game; Houston came just a handful of outs from a series victory in Game 4 before losing that game, then suffered a relatively listless loss in Game 5. The Blue Jays ' victory over the Rangers , meanwhile, completed a comeback from an 0–2 deficit; teams that lose the first two but then force a Game 5 are now 9–5 in those decisive games.\nEven with those victories, the home team has won just half of the decisive Games 5 in major league history (19 of 38), and the Game 4 winner has won just one more than half of those games (20 of 38). The Mets and Dodgers have alternated wins to this point in this series. Of the dozen best-of-five series to follow that pattern, seven stayed on turn, with the Game 1 winner winning Game 5, while five saw the pattern snapped in Game 5.\n• MORE MLB: Full postseason schedule, start times, TV listings\nMets at Dodgers\nSeries: NLDS Game 5; series tied 2–2\nStart Time: 8:00 p.m. ET\nTV: TBS\nStarting Pitchers: Jacob deGrom (1–0, 0.00 ERA) vs. Zack Greinke (1–0, 2.57 ERA)\n• In a series featuring several of the game’s best pitchers, deGrom’s Game 1 outing at Dodger Stadium remains the most dominant of the eight starting pitching performances we’ve seen thus far. The 27-year-old righty struck out 13 across seven scoreless innings and didn’t allow a runner to reach third base. He was just as good in his lone regular season start against Los Angeles this season, throwing 7 2/3 scoreless innings and again not allowing a runner to reach third base. In those two starts combined, the Dodgers have hit .145/.203/.182 against him, and Adrian Gonzalez , who is the active Dodger with the best career numbers against the sophomore fireballer, has gone 0-for-5 with four strikeouts.\nMLB Video Three Strikes: Mets' mission; speak up, umps; are Rangers new Red Sox? by Tom Verducci", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/cliffcorcoran"], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T00:38:14.135+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
