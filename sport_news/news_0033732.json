First, he waived fourth-line wing Sean Collins on Wednesday. Then, with Michael Latta skating with the extras after Thursday’s morning skate, Chandler Stephenson was recalled to center the fourth line. \nStephenson was among the last players cut from training camp. In 54 games with the Hershey Bears last season, Stephenson served mostly in a checking-line role, but Trotz said he thought there was more offense to be unlocked. Thursday night will be his NHL debut. \n“I just need a little bit more,” Trotz said. “I feel like we can play better and individuals can play better. We’re looking to find the right mix right now, and there’s some flexibility, so we’re going to try and do that. … I’m looking for a little bit of change in the way we’re playing and the way that we’re executing and hopefully a different result.” \nTrotz also made a change in his defensive core. Taylor Chorney will make his Capitals debut, replacing Nate Schmidt. He will skate with Dmitry Orlov as the third pair. \n“There’s nothing that really gets a player’s attention other than ice time,” Trotz said. “That’s the one thing that gets their attention. You can say it, you can talk about it, you can explain it, and some players really grasp hold of that. But nothing does it like ice time.” \nSaid Chorney: “It’s pretty exciting. It’ll be a good atmosphere playing against the defending champs. Should be a fun night.” \nTrotz’s changes reflected his urgency in getting the Capitals off to a stronger start than last year. The Capitals won just 10 of their first 24 games last season, but it was under a new coach and a new system, excuses no longer viable. \n“Every game matters right now,” Trotz said. “I look at it and the Montreal Canadiens are already six points ahead of us. I know they’ve played a couple more games, but they’re six points ahead of us. That’s a long way to make up even though we have 80 games left.” \nBackstrom a possibility to play Saturday \nWith top-line center Nicklas Backstrom cleared for contact earlier this week , his return to the lineup appears to be approaching. He could even play Saturday against the Hurricanes. \n“I think based on my conversation yesterday — and I haven’t talked to him today at all — that there is a possibility for Saturday,” Trotz said. “I’m not going to confirm or deny anything, but he’s feeling better and anytime a good player tells me he’s feeling better and better, I say there is a possibility.” \nTrotz said he doesn’t know if Backstrom, recovering from a May hip surgery, will be immediately inserted back onto the top line or if he would play with the second line first. If he doesn’t play Saturday, look for him to potentially make his season debut during Washington’s western Canada three-game road trip. \nHere’s the projected lineup for tonight: \nForwards", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T19:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T20:08:07.430+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
