It may soon, but, only in the event that the Dodgers’ season ends and the Mets’ campaign continues.\nThe largest crowd in Citi Field history booed Utley with fervor during the on-field introductions. The cameraman and scoreboard operator kept his face on the massive screen twice as long as his teammates, and the anti-Utley chants never stopped for long in the Dodgers’ four-hour, 13-7 loss to the Mets.\n“I think the boos at the introductions were kind of a big statement leading into the game,” Mets starter Matt Harvey said. “We knew the biggest thing going in was coming on top and scoring as many runs as we did, and, you know, that kind of did all the talking. So, for us, it was to stay focused, go out and let our play do all the talking.”\nSomehow, September’s Harvey storyline seems too far away. It was once unclear whether he’d even be available in the postseason. He and his agent talked about innings limits and concerns about the long-term safety of his arm. It dominated this city’s media landscape for the better part of a week. Monday night, the Mets ace did not pitch particularly well in his playoff debut, and it was a non-story.\nA story once again is the Dodgers’ impending doom, and how their situation is remarkably similar to what it was a year ago at this time. To survive, they need Clayton Kershaw to pitch well and for a long time, and then they need Zack Greinke to do the same.\nShould they somehow win these next two games against the Mets and advance, similar fortunes seem to wait. The problems that plagued them in the past still do. All Mattingly could say after Monday night’s game was that Brett Anderson and Alex Wood have been “OK”. They are his options to start game beyond Kershaw and Greinke\n“You know, yeah, they’ve been fine,” Mattingly said.\nEven Tuesday, should Kershaw tire early on short rest, who will pitch the seventh inning? Pedro Baez, the man who did Friday night and gave up the winning hit, and then struggled again Monday?\nThere are problems without solutions, and solutions do not often appear in the middle of October.\n1 2 Next Page", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T09:14:10.770+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
