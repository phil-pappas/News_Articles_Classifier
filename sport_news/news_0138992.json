Dan Jennings, the Marlins' general-manager-turned-manager, is reportedly set to return to the front office. \nBowa, who turns 70 in December, is expected to interview with the Marlins on Monday, according to MLB.com. He was one of four coaches the Phillies asked to return for next season. Pitching coach Bob McClure, hitting coach Steve Henderson, and first-base coach Juan Samuel were the others. \nAssistant hitting coach John Mizerock and bullpen coach Rod Nichols were the only coaches let go. Mizerock had coached third base since Pete Mackanin replaced Ryne Sandberg, who resigned on June 26. It is possible that Samuel, if he opts to return, could move across the diamond to coach third, a post he has manned in the past. \nJorge Velandia, who came down from the front office to assume a utility-coach role when Mackanin took over, will remain in the organization. It has yet to be determined whether he will return to the coaching staff or to the player personnel department.
