Gen. Tom Arwood addressed the troops, thanking them for their service and for taking the time to travel to the Village to spend a day on the course with appreciative Village residents. \nEmcee Dreiling also thanked Dick Hoepner, who has been organizing the event “for 200 years.” \nThe airmen joined Dreiling in the tongue-in-cheek “Air Force pledge,” and then were asked to introduce themselves and indicate their hometowns and jobs at the air base. \nChief Ralph Babcock told the gathering how much the troops enjoyed the outing, saying, “We have never been treated this well at any event we’ve gone to.” \nThe airmen received hats, balls and tees, and one lucky (or skilled) golfer won a PING golf bag for his closest putt on a specially set-up green. \nWeidert said, “As we all know, the United States armed forces are the first ones called upon to defend this great nation of ours against armed aggression throughout the world. \n“Our armed forces do so much for us, and we were honored to do a little something for these…young Air Force personnel.” \nBoard president and retired USAF Col. Harv Shelton added, “This is one of the hardest times in the history of the U.S. to be in the armed forces, and we are happy to do anything we can for these young men.” \nFunds raised from the tournament are used to provide scholarships to high school students enrolled in the Junior Reserve Officer Training Corp. program who plan to attend college. MOAA also purchases scooters for wounded warriors and provides funds to maintain the Hot Springs Village Veterans Memorial. \nWeidert said the troops all “hoped to be invited back again,” and said, “No doubt, they will get invited back again!”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T10:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T10:13:36.214+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
