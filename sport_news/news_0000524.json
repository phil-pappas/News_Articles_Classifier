Last season, the Spearville Lancers football team had just one blemish on their record. That was a 42-40 loss in the 8-man division-one state quarterfinals to the eventual state champions, Central Plains. This season, the Lancers are looking to take the next step. Through four games, the Lancers look primed to take that next step. On Friday, Spearville will host Ness City. A win would mean a 5-0 start to the season. Coming into the season, head coach Matt Fowler wanted to see his team lock down on the defensive side of the ball and they have done just that. Through four games, the Lancers have allowed just 18-points. \"I think we have been much better on that side of the ball,\" Fowler said. \"Just getting our calls in and having some experience. We’ve been really fast, we have some speed and we get to the ball. We’ve been pretty disciplined so far.\" The defense has been impressive. The offense might be even more impressive. The Lancers are averaging 52 points per game this season. Spearville returned a majority of their offense from last season and they have kept the ball rolling in 2015. One area that the Lancers did have to fill was the offensive line and Fowler has been pleased with his boys in the trenches. Senior Nathan Stein and junior Luke Heskamp have been the keys to both the offense and defense for the Lancers in 2015. The two have combined for 16 touchdowns on offense and 27 total tackles on defense. \"It’s a good feeling knowing that you have a good offensive line to help you get in the end zone,\" Stein said. \"That’s when our defense comes in. If you have a strong defense then the offense can take care of the rest.\" While the Lancers goal is to get further than they did last season, they are taking it one Friday at a time and this week, Ness City (2-2) is the focus. \"They look pretty solid,\" Heskamp said. \"Their running game is solid and they have a quarterback who can sling it pretty well. We’ve been working on our pass coverage and that will be big.\" Kickoff is scheduled for 7 p.m. on Friday.
