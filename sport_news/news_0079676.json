It is the largest anticipated turnout in the 29 years of Mecum Auctions and indicative of the surging popularity of live car auctions.\n\"In the past seven years, the business has taken off to a new plateau,\" said Dave Magers, CEO of Mecum.\nLive television coverage has been the main driver, and a switch last year from Velocity to NBCSN increased the viewing audience by over 500 percent.\n\"When you have a big TV audience, you have big crowds. When you have big crowds, you have a lot of buyers and sellers,\" Magers explained. \"It snowballs.\"\nMecum has 24 events in 2015, up from seven in 2008.\nTo get a robust television following, the auction has to be about more than just cars.\n\"We're loud, we're exciting, we're fast,\" Magers said. \"It's as much entertainment as it is a car auction.\"\nThe cars make up an endless sea of bright-polished steel both inside and outside the convention space. Outside, a dozen massive tents protect the lots from the elements and allow for a cruise-night type display. Inside, a row of Corvettes ranging from a 1957 convertible to a C6, line up along one wall, while other inside stars include a Batmobile, a 1967 Volkswagen Microbus and a '53 Buick Roadmaster Estate woodie wagon. From the whimsical to the arcane, the car show is an art, history and economics lesson rolled into one.\nThe 2015 Mecum Chicago Auction takes over the Renaissance Convention Center in Schaumburg from October 8 through October 10. Over 1,000 American muscle cars, collectibles, classics, resto-mods and other cars will be auctioned. Here are the top 20.\nBut the auction itself is about action.\nThe red carpet auction block is lit with neon and projected on a 20-foot-by-20-foot screen to the audience. Spotters whoop and holler out bids from those in the dozens of rows of seats on the bid floor, which is ringed by three sets of bleachers crowded with spectators. Top-dollar vehicles surround the adrenaline-filled auction. The smell of engine oils and fuel, mixed with Mothers car cleaning products, fills the air. The left-to-right parade of cars crawls from the massive carnival tents outside down the red carpet — each car for no more than 2.5 minutes into, ideally, the possession of another enthusiast.\nThe spectacle is all about connecting a seller to a buyer, with the auctioneer goading the parties to resolve an impasse.\n\"Holy Schaumburg!\" auctioneer Jimmy Landis exclaims at the reluctant reaction to a 2001 Mercedes-Benz CL600. The crowd twitters in appreciation.\nLandis is known to pause the breakneck pacing to interject some humor and humanity into the spectacle.\nCollector car auction driving big business Robert Duffer Take the flipped hoods and rumbling engines of cruise nights and blend it with the high-gloss presentation and massive scope of an auto show, take five generations of living automotive history and supercharge it with the instantaneous exchange of millions of dollars and you get the Mecum Collector...\nTake the flipped hoods and rumbling engines of cruise nights and blend it with the high-gloss presentation and massive scope of an auto show, take five generations of living automotive history and supercharge it with the instantaneous exchange of millions of dollars and you get the Mecum Collector...\n(Robert Duffer) \"Are you bidding, sir, or just waving?\" Landis calls out. The embarrassed response elicits a crowdsourcing opportunity. \"I'll show you how friendly we are in Chicago. Everybody wave at him.\"\nThey do.\n\"I love the excitement, the people,\" said Mike Graf, a 40-something real estate broker and self-professed car connoisseur from Iowa.\nHe was with his wife and another couple, beer in hand, enjoying the opening block Thursday. Graf brought five cars to sell and was expecting to buy five more to maintain his stable of 20 classic cars.\nThis was his 12th year in a row at Mecum, and while he's attended other auctions, Graf said Mecum has something no other car auction has.\n\"Frank and Dana,\" Graf said, referring to founding father, Dana Mecum, and his son Frank, one of four Mecum sons who are all active in growing the Mecum auction business.\n\"You can go up to any one of them, doesn't matter if you're bidding $5,000 or $500,000, and they'll give you five minutes of their time,\" said Randy Yockey, co-owner of Friendly Ford in Roselle, Ill., who was buffing his 1929 Ford Model A Roadster before it hit the block. \"Good guys, very honest.\"\nThe family business has deep roots in Chicagoland.\nFrom Maregno, Ill., the Mecum family held its first auction in 1988 in Rockford, where Dana's father, Eddie Mecum, runs Speedway Auto Mall. It was supposed to be a one-time event, but it ended with a tornado that destroyed tents and unsold cars. Dana Mecum had to have another one the following year to recoup the losses.\nNow Mecum is a leader in the industry, with $300 million in sales per year, and is helping fuel the classic car market.\nIn July 2014, Mecum had the biggest first-time event in the history of the company with an auction in Harrisburg, Pa. Over 2,000 people were waiting in line at 8 a.m. for the doors to open, Magers said.\nWith demand growing and a supply that's fixed, prices are increasing. In the past year, two Plymouth Hemi Cudas have sold for $3 million and $2.25 million, Magers said, proving that classic American muscle is getting its rightful value next to rare supercars.\nThis kind of growth seems limited by supply and a purported disinterest in cars by the latest generation of car buyers.\nYet there's a resurgence of modern muscle cars — with the Ford Mustang, Chevy Camaro and, especially, the Dodge SRT and Hellcat lineup laying rubber on the mental marketplace.\n\"We're seeing a lot of new, younger entrants coming into the business,\" Magers said.\n\"From the late '70s to late '90s, we manufactured transportation, not cars — nothing that anybody would say, 'Gosh, isn't that just a beautiful piece of art.' There's been an awakening by American manufacturers.\"\nrduffer@chicagotribune.com\nTwitter @DufferRobert\nParking is a problem, but shuttles are available.\nCost: $25 per day per person, children 12 and younger free\nLocation: Schaumburg Renaissance Convention Center, 1551 N.
