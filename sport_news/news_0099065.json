Aaron Ramsey was quick to the rebound but fired wide. \nIt was a save of such quality, it drew a standing ovation from the home fans. \nBayern continued to dominate possession in the second half, but Per Mertesacker and Laurent Koscielny stood strong, heading everything away that was thrown into their penalty area. \nWhen Lewandowski did break free of their shackles on 54 minutes, Cech was once again there to tip a ferocious half-volley over the crossbar. \nThe battle between the Polish striker, who has already scored 22 goals in all competitions this season, and Cech increased in intensity and importance on 74 minutes. \nLewandowski broke free down the right-hand side of the box, but the Arsenal keeper stood tall and deflected the ball over the crossbar when everyone was expecting the net to bulge. \nIt was a match-defining save and one, with hindsight, that kept Arsenal's Champions League hopes alive. They were ahead with their next attack. \nGiroud had only been on the pitch for three minutes after replacing Walcott but he caused nuisance from a long Santi Cazorla free-kick, which drew Neuer off his line, and the striker awkwardly bundled the ball home from eight yards. The Emirates erupted. \nLewandowski had one more chance in injury time, but he missed his kick when in a great position inside the box. \nFrom that near miss, Arsenal cleared the ball and Hector Bellerin sped away down the right flank before crossing for Ozil to force the ball over the line from close range despite Neuer's best efforts. \nThere was a moment of confusion as it seemed that Neuer had once again produced a truly stunning save but the goal was given by the extra official behind the goal. \nArsenal are now back on course to reach the knockout stages for the 13th season in a row.
