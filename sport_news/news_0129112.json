I'm not sure what the protocols are. \n\"I think you can see from the way he was taking his time ... he was certainly having a look at the big screen and wasn't sure himself. And then he made a sharp exit at the end of the game, that's for sure. I never got a chance to speak to him after the game, he was off that quick. \n\"It looked like to me that it hit Nick Phipps and it went back and then another player caught it. I've not had a chance to look at it on the TV, but at the time I thought there was an Aussie arm. \n\"But we're not the type of people to blame the little things, and if we'd tightened up on other areas we might not have been in that situation. \n\"At this moment in time it's very hard to take. It's a very upset dressing room as you can imagine.\" \nCoach Vern Cotter added: \"I didn't see the referee leave the pitch so I have no idea about that. We'll take time to review the end of the game properly. We need to take the emotion out of it. \n\"I feel for these guys. It was a tough day and you can question those fine margins. They stayed in the game and I'm proud of them as men and as rugby players. It's a tough one to take.\" Promoted Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T11:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T12:48:41.939+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
