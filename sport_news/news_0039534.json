I would imagine he served an ace on at least half of those. He served very well when he was behind.” \nThe two-and-a-half-hour workout puts the Briton into a quarter-final against Gilles Simon of France or Czech Tomas Berdych as he seeks his third title in Shanghai. \nThe 70th-ranked Ramos-Vinolas came through qualifying before stunning defending champion Roger Federer in the second round for the biggest win of his career – but Tsonga proved a match too far. \nHowever, the 27-year-old Spaniard gave the mercurial Frenchman a massive scare when he took the first set before going down fighting 6-7 (5-7) 7-5 6-4 in two hours and 45 minutes. \nTop seed and world No.1 Novak Djokovic had an easier time, beating Spanish 15th seed Feliciano Lopez 6-2 6-3.
