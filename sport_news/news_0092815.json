The loss dropped the 49ers to 2-5, relegating them to \"keep going\" mode.\n\"We can't hold our head down on another loss,\" wideout Quinton Patton said. \"Just have to keep on going.\"\nAdded safety Tramaine Brock: \"We've got to keep going. Can't give up.\"\nAnd running back Carlos Hyde: \"Just keep fighting. Stay positive and we'll be all right.\"\nSounds like everyone got Tomsula's message.\n--The 49ers have three extra days after a Thursday game to ponder changes. Tomsula said Friday that changes would be considered ... in all areas but three.\nOn his starting quarterback: \"Colin is our quarterback. There's no controversies.\"\nOn possibly making a change on his offensive coaching staff: \"No.\"\nOn possibly making a change on the coaching staff as a whole: \"No. I'm not there at all.\"\nSo where then?\n\"Scheme,\" Tomsula began. \"Putting players in the best positions that we can put them in. Getting players in positions to make plays to their strengths.\"\nNotes: Quarterback Colin Kaepernick reported a swollen thumb, but not a significant injury, in the wake of Thursday's loss to Seattle. Kaepernick was sacked six times in the game. ... Guards Jordan Devey and Andrew Tiller continued to share time in Thursday's loss to Seattle. Both played 23 snaps, the second time in the last three games they've split the offensive plays exactly in half. ... Outside linebacker Aaron Lynch ran his season total to five sacks with two in Thursday's loss to Seattle. Only four players league-wide entered the weekend with more sacks than Lynch.\n  Hyde's late score lifts 49ers over Redskins NFL Game Summary - Washington at San Francisco San Francisco 49ers activate RB Carlos Hyde San Francisco 49ers surprise with NaVorro Bowman, Carlos Hyde", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T04:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T09:00:05.468+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
