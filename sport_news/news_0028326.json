I am disappointed that it did not work out.” \nA witness said the altercation was ignited when Williams’ friend was asked to leave the bar for violating its dress code policy. The 22-year-old senior was said to have been intoxicated at the time of the incident.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T07:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T08:44:14.809+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
