The Scorpions methodically rushed to victory , compiling 220 yards on the ground in the first half en route to a 42-7 win over the Bulldogs in an East Central 2-A Conference game. North Brunswick (5-3, 2-1), which plays host to Northside next week, ended with 288 yards rushing against the Bulldogs (3-6, 0-3), who travel to Southwest next week. Dixon first-year coach Chris Morris was asked what he and his staff could take from this loss. “ Probably not as much as other game s,” he said. “For the f irst time we were really outplayed .” Shaquan Graham led the Scorpions with 121 yards rushing on just six carries while Jordan Howard added101 yards on 15 carries. North Brunswick led 7-0 after the first quarter, but ran away for a 35-0 lead after three quarters. “W e thought we saw some things we could take advantage of ,” North Brunswick coach Larry Brock said. “ Our defens ive coaches did a great job all week preparing for their option , and congrats to Coach Morris, who is obviously in a tough spot to fill, but hes doing a good job of always having them ready . “M y game plan was to get it to a fast guy and if he ’ s having off night, get it to another fast gu y. I t worked pretty well tonight .” Graham made it 7-0 with 8:08 left in the first quarter when he scored on a 23-yard touchdown run. Tiger Bryant then added a 3-yard scoring just six seconds into the second quarter to make it 13-0. The Bulldogs avoided the shutout with 59 seconds left in the game on Marcuz Estrellado’s 6-yard touchdown run. “It’s not back to the drawing board, but let ’ s build on what we can do well ,” Morris said. “We will get our film work tomorrow and get ready for the next opponent . For the most part we play hard and dont quit .” Meanwhile, Brock looks forward to next week’s home game with Northside. “W e got a big game next week … we now qualify for playoffs ,” he said.
