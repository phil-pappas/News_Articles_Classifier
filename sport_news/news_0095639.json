Add those two elements with a legitimate outside shooter in Robert Covington, an improved offensive player in Nerlens Noel and a point guard contingent that possesses the ability to score (Isaiah Canaan and Tony Wroten) and dish the ball (Kendall Marshall).\nSure, that's a pretty positive outlook, but the potential is there for Brown to have much more offensive explosiveness at his disposal than perhaps at any time during the team's rebuild. But if the coach is busy drawing up plays and manufacturing a new offensive look, he's not admitting to it.\n\"That's the stage that this program is at. It's all vanilla and it's all vanilla off the court, too,\" Brown said.\nMore coverage Download FREE Philly Sports Now app for iPhone! VOTE: Will 76ers make playoffs this year?

It's everything. I like the responsibility. It's a different set of circumstances because of what their birth certificates say and what their NBA resume says. It's not anything that I'm shying away from. I enjoy it.\"\nBrown says he still wants his team to play at a frenetic pace, one that will be set in motion by the point guard, although the starter at that position is unknown. Brown prefers three-pointers to long twos, drills that the pass is the most important aspect of the offense, and wants his team to be cerebral at all times.\nConquering the simple stuff will allow the team to progress to the more complicated. Just not yet.\n\"We start at what is vanilla and as vanilla as vanilla can be,\" he said. \"It's just very simple and deliberate and we try to focus on the teaching part of vanilla. Everybody around me knows what I want to leave the week with, and we haven't let it go. We've been disciplined to have pace in our practice, pop in our practice and a rhythm, and it moves quick and we're so much better organized. It's done in an environment that has an incredible feel and pace to it.\"\nHe will, of course, have to design some halfcourt offensive plays for Okafor, even if the running game is working well.\n\"Jahlil is going to be able to score on almost anybody in the league,\" said forward Jerami Grant. \"He's young and has a lot to learn, but he's a talent. I think it helps us as a team. I think just having (Okafor and Nerlens Noel) on the court is a presence. On the defensive end you can presssure on the ball (knowing two bigs are protecting the rim) and on the offensive end you know you're going to get shots with 'Jah' on the court.\"\n\"Me and the team, especially our shooters, having Jah on the floor, it changes a lot,\" said forward JaKarr Sampson.\n\"I think he's going to demand some double-teams. I think he's that good right now. It's going to change for everybody. There's going to be a lot of open shots for our shooters on the perimeter and for myself. He is just so versatile. He's got a big body and a big frame on him and he can move, he's mobile. That's what makes him very special. He's not also big and mobile, his skills are at a very high level.\"\nAs much anticipation as there is in wanting to see Okafor and Noel on the court together, they mostly went against each other in training camp. Sampson and teammates enjoyed that.\n\"Normally we'll have Nerlens on him so that's a big battle, Nerlens being one of the best post defenders in the league and Jah coming in as a rooking trying to establish himself,'' Sampson said. \"That's a good little matchup so we just let them got at it. It's fun to watch.\"\nEventually, the offense could be fun to watch. No doubt Brown is thinking the same thing, with plays and schemes running through his mind, even if he won't admit it.\nSix shots Though six point guards are in camp, half of them are battling injury. Both Kendall Marshall and Tony Wroten (ACL surgeries) are at least a month away and Pierre Jackson has a groin injury. Also on the injury front, Nik Stauskas and now T.J. McConnell are hobbled by a sore knee . . . The team opens the preseason tomorrow in Washington. They will host the Cleveland Cavaliers at the Wells Fargo Center on Thursday . . .
