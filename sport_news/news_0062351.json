(AP) - Georgia running back Nick Chubb has left Saturday's game with Tennessee after injuring his left knee on the first play from scrimmage. Chubb was running toward the sideline when he was hit by cornerback Emmanuel Moseley and later by linebacker Jalen Reeves-Maybin. He was helped off the field and remained on the sideline surrounded by a crowd of players and team officials as Georgia's offense began its second series. Georgia officials said he wasn't expected to return to the game. Chubb had rushed for at least 100 yards rushing in 13 straight games and was leading all active Football Bowl Subdivision players with a career average of 127.3 yards rushing per game. He entered Saturday ranked third nationally with 801 yards rushing on 91 carries.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T01:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T03:22:11.831+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
