You don’t say. \nFueled by an inner confidence that has buoyed her all season, Furtney shot a 3-under-par 69 at Monday’s Class AA Oak Park-River Forest Sectional at Cog Hill No. 1, taking medalist honors by five strokes. \nMore importantly to Furtney, the score helped North to the first team sectional title in school history, a 311 that vaulted the North Stars to this weekend’s state tournament at Hickory Point Golf Club in Forsyth. \n“It’s been a great experience, really,” Furtney said. “Just the whole team aspect, I just love it. It’s something I absolutely enjoy.” \nNorth, which finished 11th among 12 teams at state in 2014, topped runner-up Wheaton Warrenville South (320) and third-place St. Charles East (344), who also earned team entries to state Monday. \n“I knew we had a pretty good team because we only lost one (dual) all season,” Saints junior Rose Bundy said. “Our 18-hole wasn’t really showing it for low scores. But today we just all were really close together, and when you do that, you advance sometimes.” \nBundy (83) trailed sophomore Nicole Jordan (82) for the Saints’ top score, with Kacie Gaffney (89) and Riley Sullivan (90) next. \nJordan, who represented East at state last fall, became the second member of her family to punch a ticket from Cog Hill since 2011. That’s when her older sister, Paige, a one-time women’s golfer at Bradley, qualified. \n“Yeah, it’s exciting,” Nicole Jordan said. “I had a chance to shoot what she shot, but she beat me by a couple strokes.” \nThree Kane County Chronicle-area golfers advanced as individuals, led by Batavia sophomore Madi McCoy (83), who smiled upon admitting she hadn’t heard of Hickory Point until this year. \n“Honestly, it hasn’t really sunk in yet,” McCoy said. “But it feels really good.” \nA pair of seniors also are Forsyth-bound. Burlington Central’s Josie Kurosky (85) will make a return trip downstate, while Geneva’s Natalie Saeger (87) just snuck ahead of the individual cut. \n“It’s great to go back,” Kurosky said. “I’m relieved that my score was good enough, because I played very bad.” \nSaeger shed tears of joy once the final scores were scrawled onto the scoreboard and she realized she had advanced. \n“She’s excited about it,” Vikings coach Doug Ross said. “We’re very happy for her. Team captain and everything, you know. Senior. It was nice.” \nGroups navigated a snag of at least 30 minutes after the starter at hole No. 10 mistakenly sent a handful of groups off from the wrong tee box to start the day. \nThe gaffe necessitated a de facto do-over, but if there was a silver lining, it was the eventually picturesque weather that included sun, slight wind and highs in the mid-70s by the time the round concluded. The day started with cool temperatures and light rain. \nEarly afternoon recreational golfers encountering the slow-down news seemed to take it with a little less frustration. One alternative was playing Cog Hill’s famed Dubsdread course – albeit an aerated version – at a discounted rate of $100. \nHad budgets and daylight not been an object, you wondered if the North Stars might have stuck around. It’s been perpetually sunny for the program this season, and remained so Monday as juniors Gianna Furrie (79) and Kate Lillie (81) followed Furtney, with freshman Emma Hayes (82) next. \nAfter shaving 35 strokes from its 2014 regional score, North was 20 shots better than its output at last fall’s soggy Conant Sectional at Fox Run in Elk Grove Village. \n“Me and Kate, with the incoming freshmen, we kind of knew a little about them, that we’d be a good team,” Furrie said. “And then that first invite, when we shot a 299, that (proved it), pretty much.” \nNow, the North Stars have assured themselves of another weekend of memories. They figure those should last awhile.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T06:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T07:00:44.351+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
