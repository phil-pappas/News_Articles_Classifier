Kraemer \nTri-City Herald Order Reprint of this Story \nTwo Pasco brothers with possible gang connections are wanted as suspects in the murder of a Pasco teen shot this week near the cable bridge. \nPolice announced Friday that Nathan T. Quintero, 23, and Jaden F. Quintero, 17, are being sought in the shooting death of George Garcia Thacker. \nThe 18-year-old former New Horizons High School student was found shot Wednesday night at 6:45 p.m. in the street near Ninth Avenue and River Street. \nThe Quinteros are considered armed and dangerous, police said. No motive for the shooting has been released. \nWarrants were issued for their arrest and bail is set at $1 million each. \nPolice searched two different Pasco locations Friday in connection with the case. It’s unclear if any evidence was seized. \nCourt records show Nathan Quintero has a felony criminal history in the area, including being involved in a drive-by shooting. \nNathan Quintero has served a one-year, three-month prison term for an October 2009 drive-by shooting on West Sylvester Street in Pasco. \nAccording to court documents and Herald records from that case, the driver of an SUV was confronted by a group of gang members at the Carjo Apartments, so he drove to east Pasco and picked up three members of a rival gang. \nQuintero — whose nickname is “Flaco” or skinny in Spanish — was one of those picked up. \nBack at the apartment complex, Quintero was seated behind the driver when he fired several shots from a shotgun out the window as the SUV sped north on Sylvester. \nPeople standing outside the apartments reportedly shot back. No one was wounded. \nHe pleaded guilty and was sentenced in February 2010. At the time, Judge Bruce Spanner told Quintero: “I hope this does turn your life around and change your life. A couple more of these ... you'll go away for the rest of your life.” \nQuintero also has a 2008 Franklin County conviction for possessing a stolen gun. \nAnyone with information on the whereabouts of the brothers is urged to call 911.
