A win there would force a decisive Game 7, which would be played at 8:07 p.m. EDT and pit Toronto’s Marcus Stroman against Kansas City’s Johnny Cueto. \nBUSY BIG APPLE \nThe Mets kept themselves occupied in New York while waiting to find out where they’ll travel for Game 1 of the World Series on Tuesday. The team had a voluntary workout at Citi Field, and later in the day, David Wright, Matt Harvey, Jacob deGrom and others appeared on Jimmy Kimmel Live. \nYO OK? \nNew York is confident that Yoenis Cespedes will be back for the World Series after a sore left shoulder forced an early exit from Game 4 of the NL Championship Series. Cespedes received a cortisone injection and did not participate in Friday’s practice. “We’ve got it taken care of,” manager Terry Collins said. “The doctors, they said, look, he’ll be OK, and so tomorrow we’ll find out.” \nRESTING UP \nThe Mets are embracing their nearly week off between the end of the NL Championship Series and the start of the World Series. New York plans to have some pitchers throw live to hitters this weekend after letting players with small injuries mostly rest on Thursday and Friday. “I don’t know if every team’s the same. You know, we’re going to ride that pitching. And by the way, our pitching right now could use a blow because we’re pushing them pretty hard,” manager Terry Collins said Friday. “I’m glad our starters are going to get an extra day.” \nCopyright © 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T04:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T04:27:49.671+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
