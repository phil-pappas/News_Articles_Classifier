U.S. Attorney Randolph Seiler says 34-year-old Markus Daniel Knight has been sentenced to more than three years in prison. The Eagle Butte man, who pleaded guilty to second-degree burglary earlier this year, was also ordered to pay over $2,000 in restitution. Federal authorities say Knight failed to return a borrowed vehicle to its owner on Dec. 4, and the owner reported it as stolen. Authorities say Knight drove the vehicle to a Timber Lake home, where he stole items worth more than $4,000. Knight is under the custody of the U.S. Marshals Service. Â© 2015 Associated Press.
