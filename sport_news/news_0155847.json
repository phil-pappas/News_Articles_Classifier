You have to move forward and keep working just as hard. \n\"It is a learning process that football gives you, tough moments that make you mature and grow. They are the things you learn from the world of football. You have to keep working and try to improve in every training session .\" \nLouis van Gaal substituted De Gea at half-time during a tour match against Paris St Germain in July and then did not play the 24-year-old until the transfer window closed. \nDe Gea still trained with his team-mates and took part in team talks during his exile, however, and he insists he never lost the respect of his fellow players over the summer. \n\"I have always had the confidence of my team-mates and workers at Manchester United,\" he said. \n\"Everyone who works for Manchester respected me, they tried to help me and I am very grateful to them.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T13:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T19:53:38.375+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
