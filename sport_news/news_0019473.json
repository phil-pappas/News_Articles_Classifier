Rainey raced by on a 58-yard bring-back.\n“I can’t really explain it,” Pierce said Sunday, via the Associated Press. “I really don’t have an answer for it.”\nBut Jaguars coach Gus Bradley offered a possible explanation Monday when he said, according to SB Nation, Pierce had been evaluated for a concussion .\n“When I saw it I couldn’t believe it, but I know he’s in the concussion protocol,” Bradley said. “I know after the game he had concussion symptoms. That’s where I’ll leave it at that, the play itself if you watched it.”\nBut, wait, in today’s more vigilant NFL, Pierce suffered a concussion before the punt return, but was allowed to re-take the field?\n“I don’t know. I imagine so,” Bradley said. “It’s just unfortunate that he had those symptoms and that play happened.”\n  concussions ,  jacksonville jaguars", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T15:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T03:45:35.526+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
