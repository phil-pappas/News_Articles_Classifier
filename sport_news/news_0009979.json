He has asked officers to rededicate themselves to the service of people, particularly the poor and disadvantaged sections of society. He was delivering the valedictory address at the mid-career training programme for IAS officers in New Delhi today. The programme, organised by Lal Bahadur Shastri National Academy of Administration, Mussoorie, is being attended by 97 senior IAS officers working with the Government of India and various state governments and UTs. The Governor dwelt in detail on the historic evolution of civil services in pre-Independence and post-Independence India and commented on challenges being faced by IAS officers in states in the context of the rising aspirations of people at large viewed in the backdrop of inadequate delivery of services. He stressed on the vastly increased responsibility of officers in view of their increasing accountability in an environment which was technologically advanced and increasingly globalised. The Governor emphasised that governance in states did not fully succeed in eradicating poverty and economic inequalities and rising dissatisfaction of neglected segments would pose a threat to democracy. The address was followed by a lively interactive session, during which the Governor replied to queries of officers. He wished all of them bright careers ahead. Earlier, the Joint Director, Lal Bahadur Shastri National Academy of Administration, Mussoorie, Tejveer Singh, in his welcome address, informed the Governor that course objectives include the training of officers for the next level of competency, that is, to be effective Additional Secretaries and Secretaries to the Government of India. He said this entailed better appreciation of strategic levels of governance requiring vision, depth, perspective and awareness of policy options. Jayant Singh, Deputy Director, presented the vote of thanks.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T04:17:17.955+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
