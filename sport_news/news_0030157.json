The justices are to decide whether their ruling in 2012 to throw out mandatory life in prison without parole for juveniles should apply retroactively to older cases.\nA half century ago, Henry Montgomery shot Deputy Charles Hurt to death in a Baton Rouge park. Montgomery was playing hooky from school and Hurt was on truant patrol.\nMontgomery has been behind bars for the past 52 years and wants the Supreme Court to give him a chance at freedom before he dies.\nThe court is hearing arguments on Tuesday about the reach of its ruling barring automatic life terms for teenage killers.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
