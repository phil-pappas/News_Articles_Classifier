We have the memorial park over there, we have a great place right across from the high school. If you put it there it’s like an entry into the town, it’s the first things you’ll see coming into town,” Haworth said. \nAccording to records, Paul Revere crafted the bell in his Boston foundry in the 1790’s. The bell was delivered to the Second Church of Christ in New Bedford in 1796, where is stayed for over 100 years. \nPresident of the North Fairhaven Improvement Association, Robert Cormier, says the bell honored some historical figures while in New Bedford. \n“The bell was rolled out to the street to toll for the deaths of President Lincoln, President Garfield and General Sheridan as his body was conveyed from Nonquitt to New Bedford,” Cormier proclaimed during the ceremony. \nThe bell was purchased by the Fairhaven School Committee around 1915 and was placed in the copula on the roof of Oxford School. \nThe town is currently attempting to sell the property, but wanted to make sure the bell was safe before moving forward with any proposals. \nAfter the bell was placed on the school’s front lawn, visitors got the chance to touch the bell and take photos with a piece of history.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T00:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T08:58:32.517+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
