The Waldoboro resident has finished second in his age group in that event two straight years. \nWaldoboro — Daniel Bubar always has been game for a personal challenge, even if it meant increased work, dedication and sacrifice, as well as, of course, a boatload of intestinal fortitude. \nThose personality traits and positive attributes probably are why Bubar, an 18-year-old Waldoboro resident, has become one of the state's most successful high school distance runners, a leader by example for the Medomak Valley cross-country team and, in recent years, a strong half-marathoner. \nJust a day after competing with his team in the Festival of Champions high school cross-country event on Saturday, Oct. 3 in Belfast, the senior student-athlete was up early Sunday morning to tackle the 13.1 miles of the second annual Maine Half-Marathon on Sunday, Oct. 4 in Portland. \nIn an event based at the University of Southern Maine campus, Bubar finished second in his age group for those 19 and younger in a time of one hour and 33 minutes. It was the second straight year the Panther student-athlete finished second in his age group in the event. \nBubar, the top runner for the Panther squad — he often is among the top few finishers in races, including winning some — and his family had to get out of bed at 5 a.m. to get to the Portland race for the 7:45 a.m. start. \nThe half marathon had about 1,765 runners, including nine in Bubar's age division. Bubar finished 74th with a 7:13 per-mile pace, which is fast for that distance. \n\"His division is small because distance running tends to be really hard on young runners,\" said Bubar's father, Jonathan. \"Not many are willing or ready to bite off that big of a challenge.\" \nBubar said he started running half-marathons because it seemed like a cool challenge and it was something he had never done before. He accompanied his father to the 2012 Maine Marathon when Jonathan ran his first full marathon. It was there that Bubar decided he wanted to try the half in the near future. \n\"The atmosphere of the event was exciting and fun,\" Jonathan said of that 2012 Maine Marathon. \"He watched myself and a friend of mine, Scott Harris, run our first marathons there and he was inspired by us setting our sights on a goal and following it through. He wanted to experience that as well. The crowd was so engaged and encouraging, cheering on total strangers. There were people all along the route cheering, holding signs, offering water, even playing live music. It was that sense of community and enthusiasm from the city of Portland that made him choose to run the Maine Half-Marathon.\" \nBubar's first year he only trained to six miles and still finished second in 1:42:29. The winner of that age group in 2014 was Michael Dik in 1:36:54. This year, Bubar hoped to win his age division, but came in second at 1:33:27 (an improvement of near 10 minutes) to Thorne Boucher of Augusta, who finished with a blazing time of 1:31:26 \nFor his next running challenge, Bubar will train for his first full marathon, 26.2 miles, at the Maine Marathon in Portland next fall. \n\"If you are willing to put the effort in, anyone can do it,\" Bubar said. \"Don't let the high mileage scare you away from a marathon. Running isn't about beating other people. It's about seeing how fast you can run and your own personal journey compared to you and you alone.\" \nBubar, the son of Jonathan and Jennifer Bubar, is a four-year cross-country runner for MVHS, coached by George Gould.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T18:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T19:34:59.567+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
