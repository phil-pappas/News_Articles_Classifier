Really, the world is their oyster. I’m betting on the latter. \nChris Mottram : Bucs, 24-16 \nThe Panthers play Sunday Night Football here in Charlotte, so I’m going tailgating for the first time in a couple years. Really excited about it. Probably gonna smoke some encased meats to bring, but not totally sure yet — I have some other ideas swirling around. Should be about 10 of us, including a couple Eagles fans, but they’re alright guys actually. \nJP Finlay : Skins, 23-21 \nI fear Doug Martin in this one, but think the return of Jordan Reed can help a lot. Doomsday is avoided, but take the points. \nAndy Peden: Bucs, 31-18 \nSo we get a rookie QB who hasn’t looked that good in a game that is a Code Red, which if we lose are effectively 2-6 due to the Pats game after the bye, which would officially mean the season is off the tracks. All that adds up to Winston going for 350 and 3 TDs.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T22:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T20:00:43.316+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
