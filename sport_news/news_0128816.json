But more than that, having a pair of quality corners on the outside gives the defensive line the freedom and confidence it needs to operate. \n“I think the ability for us to have confidence in each other is big,” Dimon said. “I trust him, he trusts me. That might not have been there last year and I feel like that’s definitely here this year. \n“On the pick that Jordan had, I turned around and watched him act like he was the receiver breaking towards the ball. That’s always a good feeling.” \nAnd as Thomas points out, Oklahoma’s newfound flexibility on defense will be even more valuable as the Sooners advance through conference play. It \n“If you’re solid on the outside edges, they can’t really throw the ball and they have to start running,” Thomas said. “When you’re confident in your corners you can run a lot of zero coverages or depend on them to make plays in one-on-one situations.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T04:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T19:25:08.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
