You can't spot any team 18 points, let alone Ridgewood. That's a great football team.\" \nIt wasn't that the Mustangs (2-1-1) didn't have their early chances, though. \nAfter a Maroons field goal, Clifton scored a fumble recovery that put it well into Ridgewood territory. \nBut Jack Kiernan picked off Clifton quarterback Joe Santillo just one play later, killing any chance for the Mustangs to build momentum-or generate points. \nThe Maroons also maintained a noticeable advantage at the line of scrimmage, using disciplined blocking schemes to execute their Wing-T offense to near-perfection. \nIt was easily the most difficult night of the year for the Clifton front four, which had been outstanding in its first three games. \n\"The offense Ridgewood runs is about angles,\" Cinque noted. \n\"Defensively, I think our line was coming upfield too much, creating some gaps. I think our kids had a learning experience Friday night, and I know they are going to work hard this week to get better.\" \nA blackout in the second half failed to stymie Ridgewood's groove, and the Maroons (4-1) led by 30 before Santillo and wide receiver Delano Dixon hooked up for two touchdowns in the fourth. \nThe loss makes Clifton's matchup with struggling Kennedy one of greater consequence. \nA loss would be devastating to Clifton's playoff hopes. \nThe Mustangs currently sit in sixth place in the North 1, Group 5 power point standings, according to GridironNewJersey.com. \n\"This will be most important game of the year because it is the only one we are playing,\" Cinque said of the showdown with the Knights. \"It's definitely a must-win. If we have any hopes of making the playoffs and playing into November, we have to win Friday.\" \nThe Mustangs host Kennedy tonight at 7 p.m. Â© 2015 North Jersey Media Group Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T16:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T02:34:05.544+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
