Campus is quiet on the first day of fall break, save for the tuba players and mellophonists warming up. They are under the command of Chris Hoch, the interim director, for the next three hours, and he leads them through songs and drills, fussing over 16th notes and fixing drifts in the on-field formation. They are preparing to perform a British Invasion-themed show for an NFL game in London, but first Hoch harps on what needs fine-tuning. He trains his attention on the trumpets in Bar 35. The song is the Beatles’ “Drive My Car.” Hoch considers the phrasing. He calls for a halt to inhaling and exhaling. \n“Let’s not breathe there, OK?” he says. \nHoch sighs. There is plenty on his plate. These are uncommon times for the brassy group that traces back to 1878. He is the third director in five years, his ascension coming in light of previous leader, Jon Waters, being fired last year after a university investigation found conduct by past band members and staff that created a hostile environment. Hazing rituals and songbooks with alternate sexual and anti-Semitic lyrics came to light, but current members played on in spite of the revelations, drawing plaudits for their creative drill designs and attracting attention across the Internet. While the football team claimed the national title, the band left a trail of GIFs and Vine posts in its wake. More than 15 million YouTube users have viewed their salute to video games. Encore calls keep coming in for more spectacles. The London show Sunday, before and during halftime of the Bills’ game versus the Jaguars at Wembley Stadium, will be the band’s first reveal on international soil. \n“It’s been a whirlwind, just a slew of emotions and experiences and phenomenal growth,” says John Banghoff, a squad leader in charge of the E-Flat cornets and B-Flat trumpets. “This is a monumental year in the midst of transition.” Khris Hale/AP The Ohio State marching band performs the Script Ohio prior to the game against Northern Illinois. \nHoch waves the conductor’s baton now, overseeing a transformation of the band’s culture while adding to the inventory of inventive maneuvers that have gone viral since the program pivoted toward more picture shows in 2012. He positions his charges across the field in sequences that go beyond traditional block shows and rotations, implementing freefalling Tetris pieces one week and moonwalking figures in a salute to Michael Jackson the next. They will take their act over the Atlantic Ocean this weekend, leaving Ohio State’s top-ranked football team — typically their autumnal travel partners — to handle domestic affairs in Piscataway versus Rutgers. The halftime performance will include staples like “Hang On Sloopy” and “Script Ohio,” moving from image to image like a shaken Etch A Sketch. At one point, 192 members will align to form a rock star doing a split — legs stretching from the 10-yard line to the 45-yard line — in front of a tilting microphone stand that goes 35 yards long between sidelines. Military in their style, it is a signature flash of flair. \n“It’s funny,” Banghoff says, “among the band, we always kind of talk about and joke, are the fans really going to like this? The shows we think are going to be huge aren’t, and the shows we don’t think are going to be huge, tend to be huge.” \nThe band is ubiquitous these days. If they aren’t on the practice field outside Ohio Stadium, they are seen at all hours inside the otherwise empty Horseshoe, envisioning a game day role on field. They are featured in an iPad commercial that highlights their decision to go paperless, shelving the idea of printing out 80-page drill and music packets in order to go with digital drill books, instead. Their biggest shows come on weekends, starting with a “Skull Session” in an old barn of an arena and halftime performances before 108,000 fans. Celebrated subjects have included a remembrance of the Gettysburg Address on the Civil War battle’s 150th anniversary, a melting Wicked Witch at the title game and a tribute to James Bond, replete with theme music and a martini glass. Accompanying banners read: “Shaken, not Stirred.” Jared Wickerham For The New York Daily News Interim director Chris Hoch leads the section leaders during their music check. \nHoch is the steady hand now, and he is looking for just the right score in England. His London show is coming along, mixing “God Save the Queen,” The Who’s “My Generation” and the Beatles’ “Yesterday.” He turns the page to a Rolling Stones number, one that will play while the rock band’s tongue logo is formed. He requests that his pupils follow along for what he calls the greatest challenge of his life. \n“‘Satisfaction,’ please,” he says. \n* * * \nNathan MacMaster, the drum major, stands 6-foot-4, taller than any previous drum major he knows. He is also 25 years old, more mature than most to have strut across the field in his role’s peacocking manner. He played golf in high school, but wishes he took up track and gymnastics instead. The demands of his current job range from catching a baton between his legs to bending over backward until the scarlet plume atop his white busby touches the field’s turf. He gradually gained the flexibility to do so after performing enough core exercises to test his back’s response to such strains. He used to stack pillows behind him, removing them one by one as he progressed downward. He finally trusted that he would not fall down on his head. \n“Tough job to have when you’re tall,” he says. \nEverything is measured in the band. The standard marching movement is an 8-to-5 step. On the field, that adds up to eight steps for every five yards. To track their status, members rely on hash marks and yard lines as cues, eyeballing each other all the while. The chair step — knee raised 90 degrees with a pointed toe — allows them to breathe steadily as the toes absorb any shock from foot placement. Banghoff considers balancing the beat and precision “a very intellectual exercise.” To keep the standards, three bandleaders stand atop ladders. Hoch watches from a tower above the practice field’s 50-yard line and addresses his troops via loudspeaker. Higher up, on the roof of the 23-story Lincoln Tower, a camera records wider angles, allowing Hoch to hold a mirror up for each member in film reviews. On a recent morning, his undergraduate degrees in mathematics and music are evident below him. He sketches his drill designs by hand first before entering key elements in the Pyware computer system. There are impact points to highlight and then transitions that tie it all together. It took him two weeks to write the visual routine for London after Jim Swearingen, a long-time arranger, provided the score. Jared Wickerham For The New York Daily News Drum major Nathan MacMaster (l.), and Dan McCullough using iPad to go over formations. \n“This was a concerted effort,” Hoch says, “absolute focus on this show.” \nIt is about execution thereon. There are plenty of measures in place to inspire sharpness. Have a hat fall off during the halftime show? You will be the one member wearing the full headgear during practice sessions all the next week. Collide with a fellow member on a transition? You can lose a tooth or two, as past members have. There is also the element of competitiveness that doubles as a driving force. The band is divided into 16 rows with 14 members in each one, except for one row that holds 15. Two members from each row do not march each week, but open challenges are allowed on Mondays. Any member can battle another row member. These situations provide intense times when reserves can work their way in. On Fridays, there are musical checks. Last week, squad leaders paced the rows of the practice hall, leaning into horns and baritones to gauge their players’ performance. \n“It’s ultimately about who is prepared,” Banghoff says. \nMacMaster’s assistant, John LaVange, knows the ethic well. He plays second fiddle typically, leading the band only through the post-game performance off the field. He learns on Thursday, though, that MacMaster, who is pursuing a master’s degree in the John Glenn School of Public Affairs, will not be able to lead the band through “Script Ohio” in Friday’s practice. MacMaster must report to the state capitol for meetings as part of his academic program. LaVange, a sophomore, doesn’t miss a beat. He marches on, like a Pied Piper with 191 band members trailing his every step. There are horn flashes and players in perfect posture. He carries the position well, expressing relief afterward. He beams about doing the back bend. \n“There is no crazier, no better, no more amazing feeling than wearing the hat,” he says. \n* * * Jared Wickerham For The New York Daily News A row of trumpets sits on the practice field during Ohio State University marching band practice. \nNight falls over Ohio Stadium as a crowd of 108,423 enters through the turnstiles and spreads out along the concourse. Band members arrive beneath the red “O” stained-glass window on the north end. They stretch hamstrings and congregate by the ramp entrance, holding arms like a team in a pregame huddle. Some sway back and forth; others bounce up and down. Theirs is a kinetic energy. Police unroll yellow caution tape to keep away fans milling about. Eleven students are standing above the mouth of the tunnel. They wear black body paint with white lettering on their bellies that reads: “Y-O-U-S-U-C-K-P-N-S-T.” They start to stomp. \n“Best Damn Band! Best Damn Band! Best Damn Band!” they chant. \nDrummers with sparkles on their sticks nod to each other. They are the first ones to emerge. Horns and baritones follow. They march in lockstep, tapping their chests in a mechanical motion. MacMaster stands back. He is the last to leave. He embraces two sheriff’s officers and four state highway patrolmen. He bangs his baton against the cement before sprinting out. He anticipates a wall of noise. Jared Wickerham For The New York Daily News Members of the Ohio State University marching band practice outside of Ohio Stadium. \n“I’ve never felt adrenaline like that,” he says. \nIt is overcoat-and-earmuff weather. The band does its show with sousaphone player Mark Tareshawty dotting the “i” in the “Script Ohio” before yielding the stage to the team. Coach Urban Meyer likes to say that the school is “knee-deep in traditions,” and his team does its part. Banghoff notes that the band members stand in the south end zone each first half, hoping the team’s momentum carries them into intermission. That is the case on this night with the Buckeyes up, 21-3, early. The band reclaims the field at halftime, going through “Rule Brittania,” forming Big Ben and a crown and ending with a London Bridge formation. In between, the fans were taken to Abbey Road, one band alternate rushing on the field to blow a fire extinguisher where the exhaust pipe would be on the vehicle formed to represent “Drive My Car.” Red fireworks explode to offer a pyrotechnic punctuation. \nThey will not be able to bring the explosives on their Virgin Airlines charter to London. Most of the members are looking ahead to the trip by the time the game ends and the Buckeyes win, 38-10. Meyer, growing grayer by the week, leads his team over to face the band as they play “Carmen Ohio.” The football team departs soon after, but the band offers one last march as the stands empty. Once on the other side and through the tunnel, they continue on. MacMaster grabs a ladder and sets it up by Gate 10. He steps up below exposed pipes. Alternates steady the ladder.
