He has completed 30 of 44 passes for 417 yards, four touchdowns, and one interception. \nKemp (6-1, 207) has completed 154 of 215 passes for 1,556 yards, 10 touchdowns, and six interceptions. He is credited with minus-36 yards rushing. \nTemple's P.J. Walker is a third-year starter who has shown good leadership and toughness in running the offense. He separated his shoulder in the first game, against Penn State, but he hasn't missed any time. \nIn the 30-16 victory over winless Central Florida on Saturday, Walker seemed to take a hard hit late in the game. \n\"I got hit in my jaw, but I am good, though,\" Walker said. \nDespite being ranked No. 22 in the Associated Press poll and No. 24 in the USA Today coaches poll, Temple is a 21/2-point underdog. \nNo doubt the Owls' inconsistent performance, plus ECU's strong season, which includes a win over Virginia Tech, played a factor in Temple's underdog status. The Pirates are also 3-0 at home after their 30-17 win over Tulsa on Saturday. \n\"We are underdogs in this game and it is a role we have done for a long time,\" Rhule said. \"The kids probably relish that role.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T07:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T07:15:39.296+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
