Here's a hint for Wehby: Byzantine structures are not good for transparency, and \"not illegal\" is a very low bar to set for someone who wishes to root out corruption.\nJames Johnson\nNortheast Portland", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T15:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T00:36:33.957+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
