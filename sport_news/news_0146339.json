Well, thanks to an inventor from Florence, S.C., it will be a lot easier to fill your freezer with deer meat.\nHe developed CORN SCENT KIT to conceal a hunter's human scent from deer and other game animals. At the same time, it attracts the deer to a hunting spot and allows a sportsman to remain undetected by the deer. Therefore, it increases a hunter's chances of succeeding at getting a deer. What’s more, it is convenient, user friendly, effective and affordably priced. It is also lightweight, portable and easy to pack and carry. In addition, its simple formula and kit design minimize production costs.\nThe inventor’s personal experience inspired the idea. “As a hunter, even though I knew deer were attracted to corn, I rarely used it because it was too expensive. This cost-effective formula not only attracts the deer but conceals the hunter’s scent as well,” he said.\nThe original design was submitted to the Columbia office of InventHelp. It is currently available for licensing or sale to manufacturers or marketers.
