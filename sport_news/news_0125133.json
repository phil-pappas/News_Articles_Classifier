With patented friction technology on its scientifically engineered surface, Lynx represents the next generation of the full body workout.\n\"With proper use, Lynx is one of the safest, most effective fitness tools,\" said Lynx Co-founder and Master Trainer David Morin. \"Compare it to virtually any fitness equipment, from your treadmill to your elliptical to your fully integrated home gym, and users will see the Lynx Board is the vehicle to better results in half the time while eliminating harmful impact on the body. My team and I have created limitless exercises and routines for users to capitalize on Lynx's versatility and powerful results.\"\nThe Lynx Board technology was carefully developed during several years of research and it provides multifunctional training, with 360-degree range of motion, to isolate and strengthen muscles with little to no impact on joints. Using body weight and the friction created by the foot and hand pads on the patented surface technology, users can increase intensity of the workout by the amount of pressure exerted and number of repetitions performed.\n\"Lynx is the best new thing in fitness,\" said Lynx Co-founder and former WWE star Barbie Blank . \"Not to be confused with a slide board, Lynx is in a league of its own because of the resistance it creates when users glide on the patented friction surface. You burn more calories, faster and are able to tone all muscles through low-impact movements.\"\nPeople of all fitness levels can benefit from the Lynx Board. Results include improved mobility and flexibility, as well as increased coordination, endurance and weight loss, amongst others. The Lynx Board has also been shown to improve core strength when used properly for just a few minutes per day and with a strong core, users are less prone to injury among many other benefits.\nThe Lynx Board is offered in two models. First, the Lynx Board Home Gym model is designed for individual and/or group use at home or in the gym. It remains flat and is easily stored. Then, the Lynx Travel model is to be used on the go. It easily rolls up, similar to a yoga mat, and is stored in an accompanying carrying case so that it can be taken virtually anywhere.\nWith the Lynx Board, users also have access to Lynx TV online that provides more than 150 videos by elite Lynx trainers who demonstrate the most effective techniques on the Lynx Board for beginners, intermediate and advanced users. To live the full Lynx lifestyle, other Lynx Fitness resources online include nutrition tips by registered dietitians.\nAbout Lynx Fitness\nEstablished in 2015 and founded by elite fitness experts David Morin and Barbie Blank , Lynx specializes in innovative, low-impact fitness solutions.
