They heard a gunshot as they arrived and found a man in his early 40s injured. The man was transported to the hospital with life-threatening injuries. He was later flown by helicopter to a hospital in Fort Worth for treatment. \nThe suspected shooter apparently fell while attempting to flee, was injured and was also taken to the hospital, Cook said. The suspect was charged with assault with a deadly weapon and will be jailed once he is released from the hospital. \nThe incident happened about 90 minutes after the game had ended but many fans remained and there were numerous witnesses, Cook said. \n\"There were still a lot of people who were tailgating after the game,\" he said. \nThe Cowboys lost the game to the Patriots. The Texas Rangers were also playing at the time in a baseball playoff with the Toronto Blue Jays on the other side of the grounds. \nCook said the cause of the fight was not immediately known. The identities of the two men have not been released. \nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
