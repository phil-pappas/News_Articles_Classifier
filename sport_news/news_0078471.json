(AP) - Kendrick Bourne scored on Eastern Washington's first play of overtime before Cal Poly lost the ball on a two-point conversion attempt and the Eagles shocked the Mustangs 42-41 on Saturday. \nBourne caught a short pass from Jordan West, broke a tackle at the 20, fended off two other tacklers inside the 10 and dove over the pylon to give the Eagles (3-2, 2-0 Big Sky) their first lead. \nCal Poly (2-4, 1-2) countered with Chris Brown's third touchdown, a 1-yard run, but his option pitch went off the facemask of Kori Garcia and bounced way. \nWest, who completed 27 of 35 passes for 224 yards and four touchdowns, forced overtime with a 16-yard TD pass to Nic Sblendorio with 57 seconds in regulation and two-point conversion to Terry Jackson after the Mustangs were called for holding when intercepting the first PAT attempt. \nBrown rushed for 173 yards and Joe Protheroe had 121 yards and two TDs as Cal Poly piled up 503 on the ground - and just 16 passing.
