Through the first two weeks of the season, the B’s are the league's second-highest scoring team (3.67 goals per game), better than a goal ahead of last season when they ranked 22nd at 2.55 per.\nCredit that improvement to the success of their power play. A punchline for the past several years, it has already bagged a league-high eight goals in just six games and tops the charts at an astounding 38.1% success rate.
