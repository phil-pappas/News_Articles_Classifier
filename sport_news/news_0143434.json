He came onto the pitch immediately after halftime with Delhi already having conceded both goals.\nCarlos, who showed a glimpse of his past with a firm shot toward goal during injury time, briefly held a similar player-manager role at the Russian club Anzhi Makhachkala in 2012.\nHis managerial experience includes stints with Turkish sides Sivasspor and Akhisar Belediyespor.\nCarlos is the second-highest capped Brazilian player and scored 11 goals in 125 appearances. The marauding defender was a member of the World Cup squads which reached the final in 1998 and won in 2002. He also helped Brazil win the Copa America in 1997 and 1999 and won the Champions League three times with Real Madrid.\nFrenchman Nicolas Anelka has a similar double role with the Mumbai City franchise while Portugese player Helder Postiga (Atletico de Kolkata), Romanian Adrian Muti (Pune City) and Brazilian Lucio (Goa) are among the other top names in the second edition of the league.\nThe ISL, which got underway Saturday with a colorful opening ceremony in the southern city of Chennai, has put the game in the domestic spotlight with several semi-retired stars from around the world but India is ranked a low 167th.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T16:42:07.896+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
