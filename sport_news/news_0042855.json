Barnidge, who turned 30 on Sept. 22, has turned into one of the NFL’s top stories. He has influenced games every week in the eighth year of a previously nondescript pro career. Barnidge, averaged 6.3 catches a year from 2008-14. He has 24 catches in five games, including eight for 139 yards and the cheekiest TD catch ever seen against the Ravens. “Big Play Gary” ranks second among tight ends with 374 yards. Rob Gronkowski is No. 1 with 375, although he has played one fewer game because the Patriots already have had their bye week. Long story short: Scouts and coaches missed on Barnidge for all these years. He still thinks of himself as the all-around tight end who was a pretty good college receiver at Louisville. Perhaps, Barnidge supposes, NFL types were put off by his “weird” running style. “You wouldn’t put him on a form-running clinic tape,” Mike Pettine said, “but Gary is faster than people give him credit for.” McCOWN TOWN Browns quarterback Josh McCown leads Peyton Manning 300.8-246.8 in passing yards per game, even though McCown sat out all but the first quarter of one of his four games with a concussion. That’s quite a leap for a player who wondered if his career was over in 2010, when he was playing for coach Chris Palmer in the United Football League. McCown reflected on his UFL fling on the Monday after one of the brightest moments of his 14-year pro career. “There were very tough moments being in that league and away from my family and just feeling ‘Hey, is this what I’m supposed to be doing? Is this really how I want to end this thing?’” McCown said. “At the same time, I just felt like, as a person of faith, that’s where the journey had led me, and that’s where I was supposed to be.” • McCown threw for a Browns-record 457 yards at Baltimore. Four other Browns QBs topped 400 yards previously. The list: Brian Sipe, 444 yards in 1981; Bernie Kosar, 414 yards in 1986; Kelly Holcomb, 413 yards in 2004; Otto Graham, 401 yards in 1952, Kosar, 401 yards in 1986. “Am I surprised that it happened, especially this early in the season, on the road in Baltimore? Maybe so,” McCown said. “But did I think we were capable of it? Yes, absolutely.” • McCown leads Manning 102.8-77.3 in passer rating heading into their Sunday duel in Cleveland. Page 2 of 2 - QUIET PRESSURE Two Browns defensive linemen whose names are seldom heard played a big part in the overtime stop that turned the ball over to Josh McCown. Ravens quarterback Joe Flacco faced a third-and-10 from his own 15 on the opening series of OT. He had little time to find a receiver with pressure in his face. “I was working with Randy Starks on the inside,” said John Hughes. “Randy and I had a little ‘game’ on and got good pressure on him.” Starks began the sequence leading to a punt by making a stop on the kickoff return at the 15. “It’s hard to explain how satisfying it is to finish a game like that,” Hughes said. “At the same time, you don’t want to get the win and be on your high horse and not be ready to play the next game.” SOLOMON’S TOUGH LUCK A Browns defense that is giving up 400.4 yards a game will have to deal with Peyton Manning without cornerback Joe Haden (concussion) and outside linebacker Scott Solomon (knee). Haden had been dealing with a broken finger and aching ribs before he got caught up in a play involving Solomon. Along the lines of Josh McCown’s helicopter play that left him with a concussion in the opener, Haden got hit while airborne Sunday and landed hard. Solomon, one of the team’s best run-defending prospects, suffered a high ankle sprain in the opener and now is dealing with a knee problem.
