Senior outside hitter Nick Malak was proudly hoisting a championship trophy.\nAnd the Lasers — exhausted and ecstatic — were all smiles.\nKettle Moraine survived a grueling day, one that saw the Lasers go a perfect 6-0, and won the star-studded, 16-team Whitefish Bay Invite. The Lasers defeated New Berlin United, 25-12, 23-25, 15-8, in the championship match.\n\"We're all tired,\" said Malak, who left most of his foes even more fatigued. \"But this is great. We all thought we could win this.\"\nKettle Moraine, ranked fourth in the latest WBVCA poll, has had a terrific season. But the Lasers highlights were runner-up finishes at invites in Middleton and Kaukauna.\nThis time, though, the Lasers weren't settling for silver.\n\"I'm really excited,\" said Gulak, who has taken three Kettle Moraine teams to state. \"This is a group that's pretty darn close and has played together a long time. I think our best is still to come.\"\nThat could be frightening, considering how good the Lasers were Saturday.\nKettle Moraine rolled past Kenosha Tremper, Middleton and West Allis Hale without losing a set in pool play. The Lasers defeated third-ranked Germantown, 25-16, 25-16, in the quarterfinals and toppled No. 6 Brookfield East, 25-15, 25-21, in the semifinals.\nIn the finals, Malak and fellow outside hitter David Waltz were terrific. Senior libero Alex Gerencir shined, while the serving of senior Nick Davies changed the match.\n\"We've got a lot of people that can help and play almost any position,\" Malak said. \"Everyone contributes.\"\nDavies had five straight service points in Game 1 as the Lasers raced to a 5-1 lead. Kettle Moraine pushed its lead to 16-5 before cruising home.\nNew Berlin answered back, though, and stormed to a lead of 19-11 in Game 2. Kettle Moraine rolled off five straight points late and pulled within 24-23, but United held on when Kyle Kraninger had a huge kill.\n\"I thought we were sluggish in the first game and played a lot better in the second,\" New Berlin coach Jay Szatkowski said. \"We just couldn't build on that momentum.\"\nNew Berlin built up plenty of momentum through the day. United went 3-0 in pool play and avenged early-season losses to Germantown and Nicolet on its way to the finals.\nBut in the deciding game against Kettle Moraine, the Lasers simply had too many weapons.\nDavies had six straight service points — including two aces — as Kettle Moraine jumped to a 7-1 advantage. New Berlin pulled within three on two occasions, but consecutive kills from Waltz, Alex Dallman and Malak pushed the lead to 13-6.\nThen on match point, Malak hammered home another winner.\n\"I was a little worried because we had our best warm-up of the year at the start of the day,\" Gulak said. \"And I told the guys, 'You better have that later on,' and they did. They kept it going all day, and it's really a great win for us.\"\nPool A — Kettle Moraine 3-0; Middleton 2-1; Kenosha Tremper 1-2; West Allis Hale 0-3.\nPool B — New Berlin 3-0; Germantown 2-1; Racine Horlick 1-2; Waukesha West 0-3.\nPool C — Nicolet 3-0; Brookfield East 2-1; Shorewood 1-2; Westosha 0-3.\nPool D — Wauwatosa East 3-0; Whitefish Bay 2-1; Catholic Memorial 1-2; Burlington 0-3.\nCONSOLATION BRACKET\nQuarterfinals\nRacine Horlick def.
