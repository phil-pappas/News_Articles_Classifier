And there comes the hard part. \nThe Pumas' passion revolves around the collective ahead of the self, and Fernandez Lobbe embodies such togetherness. \nWhen the time comes to remove the fabled blue and white hoops for the final time, the sadness will doubtless overwhelm one of rugby's most fluent performers, and candid talkers. \nBut he will pass that shirt to the next generation, giving coach Daniel Hourcade a full four-year cycle to build a new back-row for World Cup 2019 in Japan. \nThere are those who would cling on until the bitter end, and then there is Fernandez Lobbe. \n\"Ireland have a great scrum,\" said Fernandez Lobbe, immediately refocusing on Sunday's quarter-final at the Millennium Stadium. \n\"We've been analysing it this week: they have 95 per cent of good, clean ball to play from and that's really, really good. \n\"They don't give away penalties from it and they have a great lineout too. \n\"They have lost maybe their leader in Paul O'Connell to injury, but we saw Devin Toner last week against France taking control of their lineout. \n\"After that, one thing that impresses me the most is the way they keep the ball. \n\"We must be very clinical with the ball, we need to use it very well, because if we give the ball away it's maybe going to get very complicated to recover it.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T14:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T20:13:09.697+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
