Ben Bishop stopped 27 shots. It was Tampa Bay's first win in Boston since March 25, 2010. \nLoui Eriksson had two power-play goals, and David Krejci also had one for Boston. The Bruins have opened with three straight losses for the first time since 1999. \nBoston captain Zdeno Chara played his first game after missing most of the preseason with an undisclosed upper-body injury. \nIn New York, John Tavares had a power-play goal and added two assists, and Thomas Greiss made 22 saves as the Islanders beat the Winnipeg Jets 4-2 for their first victory in their new Brooklyn home. \nThe Islanders came out with purpose after losing their opening two games to the defending champion Blackhawks, one in overtime at home and the other in regulation in Chicago. \nThe Islanders outshot the Jets 16-6 in the opening period and had a 20-9 shots advantage in the second. Jets goalie Ondrej Pavelec made a number of key saves in the first as the Islanders had four power-play chances. \nVancouver's Radim Vrbata and Alex Burrows scored in the shootout as the Canucks spoiled the Anaheim Duck's home opener with a 2-1 win. \nRyan Miller made 28 saves and Adam Cracknell scored in regulation for Vancouver, which beat the Ducks for just the third time in their last 12 meetings. \nSami Vatanen scored and Frederik Andersen stopped 24 shots for the Ducks, who are winless in the first two games of the season. \nThe Philadelphia Flyers blanked the Florida Panthers 1-0 after Michael Neuvirth stopped 31 shots for his first shutout in more than 3 1/2 years. \nBrayden Schenn scored to help the Flyers win for the first time in three games this season. \nIn Buffalo, rookie Jack Eichel scored a hustling unassisted goal as Buffalo beat the Columbus Blue Jackets to give coach Dan Bylsma his first victory with the Sabres. \nEichel, the former Boston University player selected No. 2 overall in the June draft, bodied off Boone Jenner in a loose-puck battle, kept the puck in the offensive zone, wheeled to his forehand and ripped a shot over goalie Sergei Bobrovsky to give Buffalo a 3-1 lead at 9:21 of the third period. Eichel has two goals this season. SHARE", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T19:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T02:01:27.125+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
