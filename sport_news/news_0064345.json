She scored one goal as a freshman, produced 13 goals and five assists as a sophomore, 22 goals and eight assists as a junior, and has 27 goals and 12 assists this season. \nSouthern Lehigh coach Adrienne Searfoss placed a strong emphasis on marking Bachman on Wednesday. Spartans junior Allison Schroy was primarily responsible for keeping her in check. \n“(Bachman) is very good,” Searfoss said. “We needed to adjust and put somebody on her.” \nCatasauqua’s next highest goal scorer after Bachman is Olivia Schlofer with five. Not surprisingly, Bachman consistently receives the most attention from opponents and frequently gets double-teamed. \n“That’s what most teams do,” she said. \n“She stays composed,” Saul said. “She knows how to read the defense and beat the defenders. And she passes to the open person if she has to. She figures out what’s going to work best.” \nBachman hopes to play field hockey in college. Appalachian State, Washington & Jefferson, East Stroudsburg, Kutztown and Allegheny are at the top of her list. \nBachman is busy all year-round. She’s a shooting guard on Catasauqua’s girls basketball team and a runner and jumper on the track and field squad. But her biggest joy that past four years has been spent playing field hockey. \n“I love the girls on the team and I love my coach (Saul),” Bachman said. “(Field hockey) is definitely something I plan to do in the future.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T05:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T02:49:20.495+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
