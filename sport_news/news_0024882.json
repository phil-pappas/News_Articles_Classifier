Broadneck's wide receiver Robert Schwob crosses the goal line for a touchdown after a catch in the third quarter. The Broadneck Bruins defeated the visiting Glen Burnie Gophers, 41-20, in high school football Saturday afternoon. (By Paul W. Gillespie /) Bob Hough Contact Reporter bhough@capgaznews.com \nComing off a victory over Arundel on Monday and with Old Mill on the schedule this Friday, Broadneck's football team had to be careful to not overlook Glen Burnie Saturday. \nWhile the Bruins might not have overlooked the improved and upset-minded Gophers, it took a pair of plays by the defense in the final minutes to secure a 41-20 victory. \nThe Gophers had the ball and were down by seven points with a little more than a minute left in the game, but Broadneck's Ashton Johnson and Thorton Ferreira returned interceptions for touchdowns on consecutive plays to help the Broadneck sideline breathe a sigh of relief in a game that was closer than the final score indicated. \n\"Any 'W' we can get, we'll take,\" Broadneck coach Rob Harris said. \"Glen Burnie has some players. Are we happy that we won? Absolutely.\" \nThe Bruins scored 10 points on their first two drives, which included a 24-yard field goal by Riley McNulty that was set up by a one-handed interception by Darnell Creek that gave the Bruins the ball on the Glen Burnie 9. Broadneck didn't get on the board again until McNulty's 34-yard field goal as time expired in the first half gave the Bruins a 13-6 halftime lead. \nEmmett Davis, who completed just six passes in the first half, did most of his damage in the second half and finished 14 for 22 for 232 yards and a touchdown. He also scored on a 5-yard run that gave the Bruins a 20-6 lead with four minutes left in the third quarter. \n\"The second half, it was just a matter of execution and getting a better feel for the game,\" Davis said. \"The coaches harped on us that they have some athletes and some really good players, and they do. They really tried to preach to us that we can't overlook them.\" \nThe Bruins went up by two scores twice in the second half, but he Gophers responded each time. \nFollowing Davis' touchdown, Glen Burnie's Dami Adekunjo scored on a 63-yard run on Glen Burnie's first play to make it 20-12. Broadneck came right back and went ahead 27-12 when Davis hit Robert Schwob for a 12-yard score, but the Gophers responded when Brady Helinski found tight end Eric Powell for a 24-yard touchdown on a fourth-and-long. Taylor Johnson's 2-point conversion made it 27-20 with 5:50 left in the third. \n\"We made some adjustments and went to a different formation (in the second half),\" Glen Burnie coach Eric Woodson said. \"We really tried to attack some areas we felt we were stronger at.\" \nAfter McNulty was short on a 27-yard field goal with 6:17 left, the Gophers had the ball three more times, but each ended in interceptions. Johnson had the first of his two interceptions midway through the fourth when he simply took the ball from the intended receiver and set the Bruins up at the Glen Burnie 40. \nChris Watts opened the scoring for Broadneck with a 4-yard touchdown run and added seven catches for 138 yards. Schwob and Niumatalolo each had a pair of catches, while Ryan Kennedy led the defense with 71/2 tackles — including four for losses — and a sack. Alli'iNiumatalolo added seven tackles and Creek added six. John Forrester added a sack and two tackles for losses for Broadneck, which will play at Old Mill on Friday in a matchup of teams with combined records of 13-1. \n\"On to Old Mill. That's going to be a heck of a challenge,\" Harris said. \"They're rolling through this county, so we'll see how we can match up.\" \nAdekunjo ran for 150 yards on 18 carries and Johnson added 99 yards on 17 carries for Glen Burnie, which averaged 5.1 yards a carry. The Gophers actually outgained the Bruins, but were done in by the four turnovers and 17 penalties for 145 yards. Ra'Quain McCain had an interception and Kylen Rebstock blocked a punt for Glen Burnie. \n\"I feel for these guys because we're there, but the record doesn't show it,\" Woodson said. \"We'll just go back to the drawing board and see if we can take these next three games.\" \nGlen Burnie (2-5)0668—20Broadneck (6-1)1031414—41 \n\nBN — Watts 4 run (McNulty kick) \nBN — McNulty 24 FG \nGB — Ta.
