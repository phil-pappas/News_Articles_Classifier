Because the Yankees lost Tuesday night, the Blue Jays need to win one game of a doubleheader against Baltimore. Toronto's starting pitchers will be Marcus Stroman (3-0, 1.89 ERA) and R.A. Dickey (11-11, 4.00). \nCENTRAL CELEBRATION \nAce Adam Wainwright is expected to be activated by the Cardinals after spending five months on the disabled list with a torn left Achilles, just in time for a potential NL Central-clinching celebration. All St. Louis needs to wrap up its third straight division title is win either game of a day-night doubleheader against the rival Pirates. The Cardinals will start Michael Wacha (17-6, 3.15 ERA) in the opener against Pittsburgh's Gerrit Cole (18-8, 2.60) and send Tyler Lyons (2-1, 3.96) to face Charlie Morton (9-8, 4.54) in the second. \nTANAKA TIME \nYankees ace Masahiro Tanaka returns from a strained hamstring to make his first start since Sept. 18. He hopes to put an end to New York's two-game skid against Boston as they close in on a playoff berth. \nDOUBLE TROUBLE \nAfter a rainout, the Minnesota's route to the final AL wild card got a little more difficult. The Twins trail Houston by 1 1/2 games and now have to play a doubleheader against Cleveland. \"It's hard to win one game,\" Twins manager Paul Molitor said. Kyle Gibson faces Carlos Carrasco, coming off a 15-strikeout on-hitter, in the opener. Mike Pelfrey will start the second game against Indians rookie Cody Anderson. \nHOME DONE \nThe Angels wrap up their home schedule against Barry Zito and the Oakland A's one day after overtaking Houston for the final AL wild-card spot. Garrett Richards (15-11) gets the start, lining him up for a potential Sunday start if Los Angeles is still in the hunt for a wild card on the final day of the regular season.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T09:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T07:28:42.592+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
