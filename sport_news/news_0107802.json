(AP) - A city council candidate in southwestern New Hampshire is facing animal cruelty charges after police say he kicked his neighbor's 17-year-old dog to death after it tried to relieve itself on his lawn.\nPolice say 55-year-old Toby Tousley turned himself in Monday evening after kicking Teddy, a Pekingese-Chihuahua mix, Saturday afternoon. Tousley is running for Keene City Council in Ward 2.\nThe owner tells WFXT-TV he let two dogs, including Teddy, who was losing his eyesight and hearing, outside to relieve themselves.\nTousley tells the station that the dogs were \"menacing\" him and that he's sorry Teddy's owner \"didn't take care of it and keep it under his control like the state of New Hampshire requires.\"\nHe was released and is scheduled for arraignment on Dec. 10.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
