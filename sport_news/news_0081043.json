The cheers were even louder after Kane’s saucer pass led to Artemi Panarin’s first career goal in the first period.\n“It was fun, playing hockey’s fun,” said Kane, who also was warmly received on the pregame red carpet outside the arena. “That’s what I love to do. The crowd was supportive and in this situation, I guess you don’t really know which way it’s going to go, one way or the other.”\nThere are significant segments of the fan base that are justifiably upset at how the Blackhawks have handled themselves and Kane in light of the police investigation into a sexual assault allegation against him in Western New York, especially since the ham-fisted press conference that opened training camp. But from Day 1 at Notre Dame, to the training camp festival at the United Center, to the preseason and now into the regular season, the Hawks fans who are buying tickets have been overwhelming supportive of Kane.\nBut Friday night in Brooklyn, Kane — who has not been charged with a crime — will be on the road for the first time since the allegations surfaced, as the uprooted New York Islanders host their first game at the Barclays Center. Kane has no idea what to expect, but it’s a safe bet that he’ll encounter some hostile crowds on the road. Some surely will be more merciless than others — Brooklyn isn’t exactly Philadelphia or St. Louis or Vancouver — but it’ll be the first look at how Kane is being viewed outside of the Chicago bubble.\nJoel Quenneville said it was “tough to say” whether it’ll be harder for Kane on the road than it is at home, but praised the winger’s focus through his off-ice troubles.\n“Kaner’s had a good approach in camp here,” Quenneville said. “He hadn’t skated much coming in here, but I felt he’s gotten better every day. … He’s focused in the right way. Commend him on how he’s handled things.”\nThe investigation kept Kane off the ice for most of August and September, but he continued to work out during that time. So physically, he feels good. The timing is what he’s working on now. But given all the chances the second line of Kane, Panarin and Artem Anisimov created, he seems to be getting closer to top form.\n“I was able to train the way I wanted to, I just wasn’t on the ice as much as I wanted to,” Kane said. “Conditioning-wise, I feel really good. The skating is really starting to come around. I feel good on the ice and my shot and my hands are probably the last things to come back, but those are starting to come, too. I’m pretty happy with where I’m at.”\nTwitter: @marklazerus\nEmail: mlazerus@suntimes.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T23:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T23:37:40.487+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
