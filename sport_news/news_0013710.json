The reward for the power forward’s perseverance through that protracted situation and the rehab process that followed has been his return to playing and practicing and partaking in events like the Late Night with the Phoenix get-together Friday at Alumni Gym. The redshirt sophomore Dawkins, one of Elon’s biggest bodies at 6-foot-8 and 240 pounds, scored seven points during the team’s five-minute scrimmage, a contribution that he highlighted somewhat surprisingly by swishing a 3-pointer from the top of the key. “I’ve been trying to expand a little bit,” he said, smiling afterward while signing autographs. “I feel pretty good and I’m very excited. It feels nice to be back out here competing and everything. I’m enjoying it.” Equally encouraging was the image of point guard Luke Eddy moving at what appeared to be full capacity — swiping a steal on defense, pushing the ball in transition and feeding freshman guard Sheldon Eberhardt, who drilled a 3. Eddy had knee surgery after suffering a torn anterior cruciate ligament that forced him to miss the final 22 games of last season. Coach Matt Matheny had hoped Eddy, a junior, would be able to participate when preseason practice started earlier this week. Eddy was ready to go. “I think he looks good right now,” Matheny said. “He has consistently been ahead of schedule throughout his rehab, because he works really hard.” Elon opens the season Nov. 13 on the road against the Charlotte 49ers. The Phoenix had held three practices prior to Friday night’s scrimmage. Eddy kicked off the scrimmage by scoring on a layup in matter of three seconds after the opening tip-off. He ended it in a similar manner with a driving lay-in just before time expired. Sophomore guard Dmitri Thompson’s nine points led all scorers. Five players hit 3s, an assortment that included one each from big men Dawkins, 6-8 sophomore Jack Anton and 6-11 freshman Karolis Kundrotas. Elon was without senior forward Tony Sabato (hairline fracture in thumb) and junior forward Christian Hairston (surgery for broken wrist). Matheny said both players likely are at least a couple weeks away from returning.
