They may not have Odell Beckham Jr. They may not have Rueben Randle. And they almost certainly won’t have Victor Cruz.\nBut on Monday night against the Eagles, the Giants will still have Shane Vereen. And if they can continue to unlock the secrets of their most versatile running back, they just may have enough offense to continue to thrive in Philadelphia.\n“Have we ever had a player like this, to be able to utilize his talents?” Tom Coughlin said of Vereen. “Probably not to this degree. So we’re just looking forward to continuing to utilize his talent and his ability, along with the other players that we have offensively.”\nThink about this: Eli Manning put on quite a show in Sunday’s win over the San Francisco 49ers, despite the fact that he’s still learning about one of his most dangerous offensive toys. When the Giants signed Vereen away from the Patriots this offseason, he was widely viewed as a good fit, a quality pass-catching running back joining a West Coast offense that lacked a backfield playmaker.\nBut early on this season, Vereen seemed more like a luxury than a key element of the offense. And it wasn’t until the waning moments on Sunday night, when hamstring injuries forced Beckham and Randle to join Cruz on the sidelines, that Vereen became valuable.\nFOLLOW THE DAILY NEWS SPORTS ON FACEBOOK. \"LIKE\" US HERE\nIt remains possible that Beckham, Randle and Cruz (knee/calf) will sit out on Monday, too, which could lead the air attack to rely more heavily on Vereen. Thus far, he’s been mostly a checkdown option, but he believes he can be more, that the Giants haven’t fully tapped his potential.\n“I think it’s a learning process on both ends,” Vereen said.\nOn Sunday, he caught three passes on the 82-yard game-winning drive, accounting for 51 yards, including a 24-yard catch-and-run on a screen pass that Coughlin described as “the Red Sea parting.” He finished with a team-high eight receptions for 86 yards, and once again showed chemistry with Manning.\n“(Sunday) night was a great example of some of the things that he can do in certain situations when the defense may in fact think they’ve got you in a position where they have an upper hand,” said Coughlin. “And someone like Shane can determine that might not necessarily be so.”\nVereen has managed to do that all season, even though he is still learning Ben McAdoo’s offense. In New England, he made a career as a running back with a receiver’s knack for finding openings in zones, and he routinely exploited mismatches against linebackers. The Giants haven’t relied on those skills when leading, but in clutch moments, Manning trusts Vereen. Fifteen of his 20 receptions and 138 of his 208 receiving yards have come when the Giants have been tied or trailing.\nAnd the next step may come Monday night. With so many receivers ailing, the Giants may design more plays around Vereen, relying on the most dynamic playmaker they have left.\n“There’s a lot of room for adjustments and things to change throughout the rest of the season,” Vereen said.\nStarting in Philly.\nRelated Stories Ex-Giant Tyler Sash overdosed on pain pills: autopsy Vacchiano: How Giants can be beasts of NFC East", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/NYDNSports"], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T07:32:13.985+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
