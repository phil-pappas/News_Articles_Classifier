(AP Photo/Charlie Neibergall) ORG XMIT: IACN1 (Charlie Neibergall / Associated Press) Matt Murschel Contact Reporter Orlando Sentinel North Texas parts ways with Dan McCarney following loss to FCS opponent. \nDan McCarney was relieved of his coaching duties at North Texas following his team's loss to Portland State Saturday. \nAthletic director Rick Villarreal announced the move following the Mean Green's 66-7 defeat at the hand of the Vikings. \n\"This is a really a tough decision, but after a complete evaluation of the University of North Texas football program, we have decided to make a change at head coach,\" Villarreal said in a statement on the team's website. \"I will always cherish my relationship with coach McCarney and he's done nothing but great things for us in his time here, but we felt like this was the best thing we needed to do for the program moving forward.\" \nThe move was first reported by Denton Record-Chronicle's Brett Vito on Twitter. \nThe 66-points were the most ever scored against a Football Bowl Subdivision team by a Football Championship Subdivision opponent. \nThe loss dropped North Texas to 0-5 on the season. \n\"The people here at North Texas are great, we couldn't have been embraced or supported any better during my time here,\" McCarney said. \"Obviously we have been really struggling lately, and Rick (Villarreal) felt it was in his best interests with the University and the athletic department and the football program to go another direction. I will always be grateful to President Rawlins, Rick and President Smatresk for this opportunity.\" Matt Murschel", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T05:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T19:30:06.860+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
