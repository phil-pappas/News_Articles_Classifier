Still, with the regular season approaching, plenty of questions remain surrounding the crowded roster that Danny Ainge has amassed. Here’s a look at five issues that Stevens and Ainge will need to solve in the coming weeks.\n1. Who makes the final roster? With 16 players signed to guaranteed contracts, Danny Ainge will need to make a notable cut prior to opening night on October 28. Offseason trade addition Perry Jones is the odds-on favorite to be let go after seeing limited playing time in Boston’s first four preseason games. Still, don’t rule out the possibility that Ainge will trade away a redundant piece within the team’s frontcourt and wing spots. Jared Sullinger and Evan Turner are options on that front, as both will be free agents after this season.\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below 2. What starting lineup will Brad Stevens settle on? The head coach has kept fans guessing by using a different starting lineup during each of Boston’s preseason games thus far. The only player who can probably feel safe about his status in the starting five is Avery Bradley at shooting guard. Isaiah Thomas and Marcus Smart are battling it out for the starting point guard spot, and Jae Crowder may force Turner to the bench at the wing, thanks to his strong contributions on both sides of the ball during the preseason. The frontcourt has seen a myriad of combinations between David Lee, Amir Johnson and Tyler Zeller, so look for Stevens to choose the duo that complements each other best on the floor.\n3. Who are the odd men out of the rotation? Ainge has assembled an impressive collection of depth at nearly every position on the roster heading into the 2015-16 season. Stevens has said he only wants to play four big men most nights, meaning Kelly Olynyk or Jared Sullinger may be watching some games from the sidelines if they can’t outplay the veteran bigs in practice. There won’t be enough minutes to keep everyone in the backcourt happy either, especially with rookies like R.J. Hunter and Terry Rozier making a strong case for minutes. Vital contributors from last year’s squad like Jonas Jerebko and Evan Turner may be left wondering where they’ll fit in if they can’t show their worth in the preseason.\n4. Was last year’s strong finish a fluke? With 10 players returning from last year’s roster, and useful additions to the team’s frontcourt in Lee and Johnson, the Celtics appear poised to take a strong step forward within the Eastern Conference. However, many across the league are wondering just how much carry over there will be from last year’s fast finish. The effort produced at the end of last season, with 24 wins in the final 36 regular season games, may not be sustainable, but remaining an over .500 team for a full 82 games would not be a stretch either. With more firepower and stability in place in 2015-16, Stevens has the tools and continuity to silence the skeptics.\n5. Which young players are keepers for the Celtics long-term? After stockpiling assets for the past two seasons, the time has come for Ainge to make some judgments on the returns. He’s put together a talented collection of players together, but with 10 players under age 25 on the roster, there’s still plenty of untapped potential. Whether it’s a lottery pick like Marcus Smart or a more experienced youngster such as Avery Bradley, Ainge needs at least one player to make a major leap so he can better construct this roster moving forward. In order to acquire the next franchise building block via trade or free agency, Ainge must also figure out which upcoming free agents (Sullinger, Zeller) are expendable. Having plenty of young depth is nice, but you ultimately have to cash in some of it to take a bigger step forward. The performance of this year’s squad will be a crucial evaluation tool for Ainge on that front.\nPhotos: Meet the 2015-16 Boston Celtics\nPrevious -- of -- Next Isaiah Thomas, guard, four-year veteran, second season with Celtics: In 21 games with the Celtics in the 2014-15 season, Thomas averaged 19.0 points, 2.1 rebounds, and 5.4 assists in 26.0 minutes.
