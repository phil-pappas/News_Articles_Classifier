He had a 12-year NHL playing career with the Buffalo Sabres and the Rangers that was followed by a more successful coaching career, first during a long run in Buffalo and now with Dallas. \n\"Lindy's a guy that since I was young everybody in our town looked up to,\" said Hakstol, who was hired by the Flyers in May after having lots of success as a college hockey head coach for 11 seasons at North Dakota. \"As a kid, I remember when he was a first-round pick and when he played his first games in the league.\" \nThis story of two residents now making it big includes sadness, as Hakstol was friends with Ruff's late younger brother. \nBrent Ruff, who was two years younger than Hakstol, was killed on Dec. 30, 1986 at age 16. He was playing junior hockey for the WHL's Swift Current Broncos when his team bus crashed on icy roads traveling to a game in Regina, killing four players. The survivors included a future Hockey Hall of Famer, Joe Sakic. \nLindy Ruff remembers Hakstol as a kid and got to know him a little better in September 2007 when his Buffalo squad played a preseason game against the Minnesota Wild at Hakstol's North Dakota rink. \n\"He's a little bit younger, but when you live in a town that small you know everybody,\" Ruff said. \"Dave was about the age of my younger brother and it wasn't the only Hakstol family (in the area). There was a couple of them around. But that's a small town and for him to make it, too, I think is in incredible feat. And congratulations because he did a great job in North Dakota and now to get this opportunity, I'm happy for him.\" \nThe Warburg natives didn't have make time for a dinner after the Stars got into Philadelphia on Tuesday night, but planned to chat before their 7:30 p.m. Wednesday matchup. \n\"My dad called me and said I gotta make sure to say hello to his mom,\" Ruff said with a laugh. \"I said, how would you like me to do that? The building's pretty big. I got work to do.'\" \nRegardless of how much they talk, the two Warburgers are fans of each other because of their roots. Ruff rooted on Hakstol when he was at North Dakota, while Hakstol has looked up to Ruff for years. \n\"Their family is very, very important to our community — the entire family, including Brent,\" Hakstol said. \nRandy Miller may be reached at rmiller@njadvancemedia.com .
