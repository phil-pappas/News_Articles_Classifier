Sandhu, considered a close confidante of the Badal family, cited the decision of the Five Takht Jathedars to exonerate Dera Sirsa chief and the recent incidents of desecration of Guru Granth Sahib in the state as reasons for his decision. Takht’s Jathedar’s decision, which he claimed was “influenced by politics alone”, had humiliated Sikh the world over. He also held the state government “solely” responsible for the increasing incidents of the desecration of ‘birs’ in the state. “Had the police taken cognisance when the first instance of sacrilege at Burj Jawahar Singh Wala village, Faridkot, came to light, the present situation could have been averted. What was the point of announcing awards of Rs 1 crore to find the culprits now? My conscience didn’t allow me to be part of this degrading political game. So, I decided to stay away and sent my resignations,” he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T20:26:10.894+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
