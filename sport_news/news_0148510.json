The Tide are set to kick off versus Arkansas at 6 p.m. \nWith Dafford Smith Stadium still condemned, the Purple and Gold are in the second year of playing their home games in Bearcat country. This week is homecoming at Cullman, however, taking Thursday and Friday out of the equation and leaving Saturday as the only legitimate option. \nFairview is 2-4 overall and winless in region play. Undefeated Guntersville (6-0, 4-0) is coming off its closest contest, a 21-20 thriller over Etowah. \nOliver Woodard Stadium also hosted West Point, Fairview and Curry for a preseason jamboree, though the evening was shortened by showers. \n% Rob Ketcham can be reached at 256-734-2131, ext. 138 or at robk@cullmantimes.com.​ Sign Up / Sign In With your existing account from... {* loginWidget *}", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T21:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T02:58:40.087+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
