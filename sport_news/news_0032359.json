It’s because I believe there’s so much potential in this team and I just don’t think we played well last week. I am happy that we got in now. I’m proud as all could be.” The defense led the way limiting Plainwell to a first quarter score. And they were letting Plainwell know physically. “That was a heckuva defensive stand by us and we learned some things about our defense tonight that I was a little curious (about) coming in, especially after last week’s lost to Dowagiac,”Lamb said.“We hit people. I’m proud of our seniors, senior night. They took care of business.” Plainwell opened the scoring with 1:26 to go in the opening quarter as Alex Brown busted through a hole on fourth-and-two and raced 44 yards for the score. JosephFazio added the point after for a 7-0 lead. Sturgis opened the game throwing often and it paid off in the second quarter as it opened up the running game also. “I wanted to throw the ball early,”Lamb said.“I needed to see some coverage alignments from what they were going to give us. At times they had four over three, so we had a box we should have been running in. Other times, they had some things that were favorable to them, so we were doing our next option. It’s a chess-match game and I got to see it from upstairs for the first half and saw what I needed to. “So when I came downstairs in the second half, it was easy to make some adjustments.” Cole Campbell got Sturgis within a point as he scored on a 2-yard run with 6:40 left before halftime. The defense set the drive up stuffing Plainwell on a fourth down attempt near midfield. A couple of passes fromTristen Stewart to Liam Adams got Sturgis down inside the 5-yard line. However, the extra point was block leaving Plainwell ahead 7-6. After a three-and-out by the defense, Sturgis took over again near midfield. A couple of runs by Stewart got Sturgis to the edge of the red zone.After a pass connection with BrandonWetzel for five yards, Stewart hit Salvadore Mangandi in the flat and he dodged and ducked his way into the end zone for a 16-yard score. Page 2 of 2 - “We went no-huddle tonight, we took some shots,”Lamb said. “ (I tell Tristen) just settle down and see the whole field, see your options and say okay this is what I like and then go for it.And that’s what he’s starting to do. Tristen tonight, pulled it down on the pass plays, tucked it and ran.And that’s what we have got to have, because that’s another option now.” Stewart then connected with Wetzel for the two-point conversion and Sturgis took a 14-6 lead into the break. Sturgis opened the second half with the ball and drove it 80 yards for the score. The possession was capped with a quick slant from Stewart to Adams and he raced for a 52-yard score and a 21-7 lead after Rodrigo Garcia slammed home the point after just over three minutes into the third quarter. Sturgis played conservatively for most of the second half relying on the ground game and defense. “We got up there and were able to grind it out a little bit,” Lamb said. Plainwell would get a late safety for the final score. Sturgis had a few miscues that may have kept them from a more lopsided score. “We dropped some balls,”Lamb said.“Down here on a third-and-four, we busted on a blocking assignment and went the wrong way.Otherwise, we probably have a couple more touchdowns we put in.” And while Sturgis is in the playoffs, next week is what the team will be focusing on starting tomorrow. “Now it’s like let’s go play Edwardsburg,”Lamb said. “Plainwell showed us some things that Edwardsburg does and I like the way we defended it.We just have got to continue to do that, because that’s what Edwardsburg is going to do.It’s going to be Wishbone, Wing-T all night long and it’s going to be ground and pound.So we just have to read and be ready to come up and make tackles. “And if we play defensively like we played tonight, there should be no reason why we can’t walk off with a win.” Stewart finished 12-for-28 for 166yards with two touchdowns and an interception. He added eight carries for 54 yards on the ground. Adams caught seven passes for 118 yards, Mangandi added four receptions for 43 yards. Campbell ran 16 times for 35 yards. Tristen Stewart and Brecken Stewart each had interceptions, while Jon Sholl added a recovery of a muffed punt.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T07:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T03:35:56.147+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
