Penn State's defensive coordinator called it the \"no-huddle defense,\" and his players liked the idea.\nPenn State would approach the Hoosiers' hectic pace with one even faster. They wanted to be at the line of scrimmage before Indiana, play at a faster tempo and curb any advantage such a strategy provides.\nFollowing a 29-7 win, in which Penn State held Indiana's conference-leading offense to seven points, the players loved their new defense.\n\"We're the first team to be a no-huddle defense,\" safety Marcus Allen said. \"That's all I've got to say.\"\nIndiana arrived at Beaver Stadium with the Big Ten's top offense in points (36 per game) and yards (498.2) but without its starting quarterback or running back. Still, the Hoosiers ran their up-tempo offense behind backup quarterback Zander Diamont, who directed one good series.\nThe Penn State Nittany Lions line up against the Indiana Hoosiers on Saturday at Beaver Stadium in State College.\nDiamont led the Hoosiers on an eight-play, 65-yard scoring drive that tied the game 7-7 in the first quarter. After recovering an ensuing onside kick, Indiana had momentum on its side as well. But Penn State's defense outpaced the Hoosiers from there.\nAfter the onside kick, Penn State forced Indiana into a three-and-out, one of six such series in the game. The Hoosiers punted 11 times overall, nine after the touchdown drive. Penn State also forced a turnover on downs and a real turnover via freshman John Reid's interception in the fourth quarter.\nThe Lions credited their defensive tempo for making a difference. Penn State practiced at a high pace against the scout team last week. Even walkthroughs went at a high pace to keep players \"thinking fast,\" linebacker Jason Cabinda said.\nChristian Hackenberg leads Penn State to big win over Indiana Mark Wogenrich STATE COLLEGE — Christian Hackenberg credited his touchdown dive to a former Penn State quarterback who blamed his 2012 end-zone plant on running with a clumsy knee brace.\n\"Took a little lesson from Matt McGloin,\" Hackenberg said, laughing.\nPenn State's quarterback was in a good mood Saturday afternoon,...\nSTATE COLLEGE — Christian Hackenberg credited his touchdown dive to a former Penn State quarterback who blamed his 2012 end-zone plant on running with a clumsy knee brace.\n\"Took a little lesson from Matt McGloin,\" Hackenberg said, laughing.\nPenn State's quarterback was in a good mood Saturday afternoon,...\n(Mark Wogenrich) \"When you see we're right there, down before the ball is even snapped, that's very intimidating,\" said defensive tackle Austin Johnson, who tied for the team-high with nine tackles. \"They were like, 'Hey, they're going at a faster pace than us, so this isn't going to work as well as we thought.'\"\nIt didn't help that Diamont was injured in the second half, ceding to third-string quarterback Danny Cameron, a redshirt freshman playing in his first game. The Lions sacked Cameron once and chased him more.\n\"Especially since he's a freshman, he's inexperienced,\" Allen said. \"He was basically like lunch to us.\"\nINJURY UPDATES: Coach James Franklin said Penn State got through the game without any significant injuries. Further, he expected to have several injured players, including running back Saquon Barkley, for next week's game at Ohio State.\nFranklin said that Barkley, who has missed the past two games with an ankle injury, was ruled out late in the week. Fellow back Akeel Lynch also missed the game.\nAmong those returning were Allen, linebacker Brandon Bell and offensive tackle Andrew Nelson. In addition, tight end Adam Breneman was in uniform for the first time since 2013, though he did not play.\nNOTEWORTHY: Franklin replaced kicker Joey Julius in favor of Tyler Davis in the second half. Julius missed two extra points and sent a kickoff out of bounds. Davis made his first extra-point attempt and also a 30-yard field goal. … Penn State completed its first five-game home stand since 1922 at 5-0. The Lions are 5-0 at home for the first time since 2008. … The Lions are 2-0 in the Big Ten for the fifth time since 2005. … Receiver Geno Lewis caught a season-high three passes for 39 yards. … Quarterback Trace McSorley completed his first career attempt to Gregg Garrity, who made his first career reception.", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-561973ce/turbine/mc-pictures-sports-indiana-at-penn-state-colle-025", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-561932a3/turbine/mc-penn-state-football-indiana-game-20151010", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-561973d0/turbine/mc-pictures-sports-indiana-at-penn-state-colle-024", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-56197408/turbine/mc-pictures-sports-indiana-at-penn-state-college-football-20151010"], "published": "2015-10-11T06:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T11:24:14.613+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
