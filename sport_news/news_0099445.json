He didnâ€™t know it at the time, but one of the tintype photos he bought showed William H. Bonney, aka the Kid, playing croquet, according to authenticators.\nIts discovery would make it the second known photo of the legendary outlaw.\nCollectibles analysts at Kagins Incorporated said they studied the tintype for more than a year, KOB reported. They believe it was taken in 1878 and shows the Kid along with the other \"Regulators\" that were deputized during the Lincoln County War .\nSallie Chisum, whose journals provided first-hand accounts of Bonney's exploits, is also in the photo, Kagins said.\nJeff Aiello , executive director of the documentary Billy the Kid: New Evidence , told the Gate it was \"the holy grail of not just western photography; it's the holy grail of photography.\"\nBilly the Kid: New Evidence is scheduled to air at 9 p.m. ET Sunday on the National Geographic Channel.\nCopyright 2015 Raycom News Network.
