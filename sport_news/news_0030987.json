It is a great tribute to our Park Superintendent Greg Johnston and his staff that the park still feels brand new. This year we celebrate our tenth season and look forward to the next 10.\" \nHistory at Dickey-Stephens Park: \nThe first-ever Travs game at Dickey-Stephens Park was played on April 12, 2007 vs. Frisco with the RoughRiders winning 6-5 in front of a sell-out crowd of 7,943. Trailing by five entering the bottom of the ninth inning, Travs outfielder Curtis Pride belted a three-run home run, the first in Dickey-Stephens Park history, to cut the deficit to one, but Arkansas fell just short of completing the comeback. \nOn April 30, 2010, RHP Ryan Brasier tossed a complete-game nine-inning no-hitter for the Travs, the first and still the only in Dickey-Stephens Park history in a 4-0 win over Tulsa. \nThe Arkansas Travelers hosted the 2014 Texas League All-Star Game at Dickey-Stephens Park, with the North winning 3-1 over the South. Current Major Leaguers Alec Asher (PHI), Cam Bedrosian (LAA), Delino DeShields (TEX), Taylor Featherston (LAA), Jon Gray (COL), and Jake Smolinski (OAK) each played in the game. \nArkansas has made the playoffs in five of its first nine seasons at Dickey-Stephens Park, including each of the last three seasons and won the 2008 Texas League Championship. \nNotable Arkansas Travelers who have played at Dickey-Stephens Park: \n2007: Sean Rodriguez, Bobby Wilson, Darren O'Day \n2008: Mark Trumbo, Kevin Jepsen, Fernando Rodriguez, Francisco Rodriguez \n2009: Peter Bourjos, Hank Conger, Jeremy Hill, Alex Torres, Jordan Walden \n2010: Alexi Amarista, Efren Navarro, Steve Geltz \n2011: Mike Trout, Garrett Richards, Matt Shoemaker \n2012: Jean Segura \n2013: C.J.
