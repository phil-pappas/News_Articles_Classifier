The rap, along with Rs 25,000 costs, by Justice Raj Mohan Singh, came on a regular second appeal filed by Haryana and other appellants against legal representatives of a former General Manager at the District Industries Centre, Rohtak. He was accused of acts of omission and commission while in service; and penalty of reduction in pension up to 10 per cent was imposed on him. The case hovers around the issuance of a genuineness certificate to a mill for sales tax exemption. As the matter reached the High Court, the Bench observed that the inquiry officer gave findings in the plaintiff’s favour and stated that extraneous consideration was not involved in issuing the genuineness certificate. But the competent authority took a divergent view. The Bench added opportunity of being heard was apparently not granted at the time of inflicting punishment. Rather, the appellants also filed an appeal against his heirs on the issue of withholding gratuity of Rs 70,125. The department pleaded that the employee was charge-sheeted at the time of retirement. As such, gratuity was withheld and the punishment of a 10 per cent cut in pension was imposed after a regular inquiry. Dismissing that appeal, the High Court observed that it was not the appellants’ case that the order for recovering financial loss had been passed against the employee. It was also not the case that disciplinary proceedings had been initiated against the plaintiff for recovery of loss. In fact, the appeal was found to be totally devoid of merits and a result of callous attitude of the state authorities. Before parting with the orders in the present case, Justice Raj Mohan Singh asserted: “In view of above, it has been found that the impugned action of the department in reducing the pension by applying a 10 per cent cut is wholly unsustainable in law and the same is required to be refunded to the legal heirs of the plaintiff, who died during the proceedings…. Resultantly, this appeal is dismissed with costs of Rs 25, 000 to be paid to the legal representatives of the plaintiff within three months….”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T08:09:10.093+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
