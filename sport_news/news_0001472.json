Sunday night’s 4-1 Rangers comeback win over the Calgary Flames deserved an asterisk, just like their enviable 6-2-2 record through 10 games of this regular season requires a qualifier.\nAbsolutely, the Big Apple’s Stanley Cup hopefuls know how to win and deserve credit for doing so, even when they’re not at their best. But there can’t be one Ranger player that believes hockey like theirs in Sunday’s start belongs anywhere near a team with their lofty aspirations.\n“I think our record’s really good, but at the same time we know in here that maybe one or two games we’ve played a 60-minute game really hard,” said alternate captain Dan Girardi, whose go-ahead goal at 16:57 of the second period held up as the game-winner for his 200th career NHL point. “There’s been really good spots in games, but we’ve been obviously not great during times in the games.”\nCoach Alain Vigneault sees it. He practically ran down the bench in disbelief after one of defenseman Keith Yandle’s many turnovers, and afterwards summarized his division-leading team as “a work in progress.”\n“I don’t think that anybody in our dressing room believes that there’s not room for improvement in our play,” said Vigneault, whose team is nevertheless 3-0-1 in its last four games.\nBryan Pace/for New York Daily News Rookie Oscar Lindberg scores a goal in the second period. Granted, the Rangers were playing their third game in four days, just 24 hours after a physical, emotional and draining 3-2 shootout loss to the Flyers in Philadelphia. However, the persistent defensive lapses and puck management problems out of the back – namely from players such as Dan Boyle and Yandle – is worrisome.\nSo is the inability of top forwards such as Rick Nash and Chris Kreider to sniff the net.\nFortunately backup goaltender Antti Raanta made 22 saves, improving to 2-0-0 this season with one goal allowed in 120 minutes. Vigneault said the game’s turning point was Raanta’s back-to-back saves on a Mikael Backlund shorthanded breakaway and Michael Frolik’s rebound with Calgary up, 1-0, late in the first.\nFlames forward Jiri Hudler scored on the first shot for either team 3:06 into the match after a Marc Staal turnover. Raanta said the Rangers “weren’t there early in the game,” when it took them almost 32 minutes (31:58) to reach just 10 shots on net,\nJared Silber/NHLI via Getty Images Anti Raanta makes 22 saves in net for the Rangers on Sunday. But Rangers Oscar Lindberg, Girardi, Kevin Klein and Derick Brassard scored on shaky Calgary goalie Jonas Hiller (17 saves) to douse the Flickering Flames (2-6-0). Klein was the team’s best defender and player. Forward Emerson Etem, acquired in the summer Carl Hagelin trade with Anaheim, played well in his second appearance as a Ranger and grabbed his first point assisting on Girardi’s goal.\n“We came out in the third period and went after them,” Staal said. “We found a way to win the game.”\nThey’ve found a way to win six of 10, but it’s got to be better – a whole lot better – starting with Friday night’s home game against the Toronto Maple Leafs.\nRelated Stories Rangers fall to Flyers in shootout, 3-2 Tanzania trip an eye-opening experience for Mats Zuccarello", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T06:14:25.282+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
