And with the prodding, Anthony put together the best season of his career, finishing third in the NBA’s MVP balloting.\nKidd is long gone, a coach on the sidelines now for the Milwaukee Bucks. So Anthony took it upon himself this season to ask the Knicks’ coaching staff to serve as the prodding voice and critic.\n\"I kind of challenged the staff to kind of push me and stay on me when I’m not doing something,\" Anthony said. \"Call it out in the film session so everybody can see that and hear that. By them doing that, when that time comes, it kind of forces me to be at the top level of my game on both ends of the court.\"\nKnicks coach Derek Fisher has been willing to play the part, although he was quick to point out that his star isn’t exactly a flawed product. Even with the roster makeover Anthony is the lone star on the Knicks, who improved to 4-0 in the preseason with a 101-95 win over the Boston Celtics on Friday at Madison Square Garden.\n\"Everybody gets their fair share,\" Fisher said. \"But I think he’s just letting everyone know he’s accepting more leadership and expects to be held accountable. We have a group of guys that all want to be treated that way and so I think he’s just expressing to make sure everybody else knows.\n\"The two things that we talked about the most from our perspective as coaches is to run the floor. Our wings have to run the floor to get back in defensive transition. … Defense is always an area where everybody’s leash is kind of the same length. … So that’s an area where everybody gets called out.\"\nAnthony has worked his way through the rehabilitation process from February’s surgery on his left knee. Through the first three preseason games he averaged 18.7 points in just 22 minutes, converting 67 percent from the floor and 43 percent from three-point range.\nBut nearly all of his work has been done on the perimeter — and he started the night off Friday against the Celtics the same way, smoothly draining a jumper from the top of the key.\nBRIEFS: Kristaps Porzingis worked out before the preseason game and said he felt fine, but Fisher held him out as he works his way back from a left quad strain that has kept him out of action since Sunday. He is expected to play tonight in Charlotte. … Arron Afflalo made his first appearance of the preseason.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T04:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T08:33:43.081+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
