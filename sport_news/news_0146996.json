Both games are set for 2:25 p.m. Mountain Time.\nWhat? Mouthy Greg Hardy — returning from his four-game suspension for domestic violence — and the banged-up Cowboys (2-2) vs. Deflategate QB Tom Brady and the high-scoring Pats (3-0), and a super-model wife as a side story?\nThe Cheater vs. The Beater. Allegedly.\nThis isn’t just a huge game, it’s a reality show.\nJust not one that will be aired locally.\n“It’s about a 50-50 passion split between the Cowboys and Broncos,” KRQE general manager Bill Anderson told the Journal on Wednesday. “In a toss-up. It’s really difficult for us to go against the Broncos because we not only cover the state but cover southern Colorado, and we have a station in Durango.\n“This literally becomes an issue that I will hear from Congress on. I do everything I can to serve all the communities we’re licensed to serve. It’s a pretty big deal for me to not go with the Broncos when there’s a conflict.”\nThe same type of situation occurred in 2013. On that occasion, Anderson told the Journal he chose the Broncos’ game over the Cowboys’ game because he tries to “bounce back and forth” and the Cowboys had won out the previous such conflict.\nSo wouldn’t that make it the Cowboys’ turn again this time?\n“What’s changed since then, is there is just more pressure on our TV license to make sure that we’re respectful of the fact that we have a Colorado license,” Anderson said. “There’s an audience there for the Broncos that won’t be served if we don’t carry that game. It’s still very much a station discretionary thing. I won’t say it’s an absolute that it will always be this way, but we’re definitely inclined to give the Broncos the advantage because of the station there.”\nIn 2014, there was a new NFL-TV agreement allowing Fox (which has NFC road games) and CBS (which has AFC road games) to flip games from one network to the other in certain cases. Since the KRQE Media Group also operates KASA (Fox) in Albuquerque, couldn’t he then put the Dallas-New England game on the local Fox affiliate?\n“I don’t think the flex-out gives us the ability to move the Cowboys’ game to another network,” Anderson said. “The horse-trading has to be done with the networks, but we can’t make that decision.”\nAnderson said he has to request the games the station wants to air before the season, and the networks typically cooperate. He said there is a window, “I think about 15 days,” in which a local affiliate can request to switch a game during the season, but he chose to remain with the Broncos this time.\nThe KRQE Media group also operates KBIM in Roswell, and the Journal asked Anderson how much that came into play — knowing that is nearly 100 percent Cowboy Country.\n“It’s probably even a higher percentage than that,” Anderson said. “But that’s still a city in New Mexico we’re talking about, and we’re talking about a city — Durango — that’s in an NFL market.”\nAnderson said he will hear plenty of complaints from Cowboys fans. But he would have heard just as many from Broncos fans had he gone with the Dallas contest.\n“That’s what we’re trying to balance,” he said. “There’s no way to wind up being a hero. I signed up for that, and that’s my job on weekends like this. But what has changed is there has literally been Congressional pressure and Congressional offices asking because their constituents need to know.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T05:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T18:27:00.891+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
