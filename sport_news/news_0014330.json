The Tigers didn't yield a first down or TD on the first three plays, but on 4 th down, Harris rolled right in play-action and flipped the ball to McGee on the edge of the end zone for the score.\nSECOND QUARTER\nFLORIDA 7, LSU 7 (12:23)\nLSU -- Leonard Fournette 2 run (Trent Domingue kick)\nDRIVE: 12 plays-88 yards-5:09\nKEY PLAYS: After going into witness protection in the 1 st quarter, the Tigers' offense came alive, sparked by Brandon Harris, who showed poise and patience in the pocket. Harris was 4-for-5 on the series for 56 yards, with three of those connections to Travin Dural for 48 yards – the last converting a 3 rd -and-9 play. Fournette did his work as well with four gritty carries for 17 yards, the last out of the wildcat formation for a easy TD.\nLSU 14, FLORIDA 7 (5:00)\nLSU – Malachi Dupre 9 pass from Brandon Harris (Domingue kick)\nDRIVE: 9 plays-67 yards-5:12\nKEY PLAYS: The Tigers clicked again and methodically churned through the normally stingy Gators' defense, converting three consecutive third downs to keep the chains moving. Fournette lit the fuse with a 25-yard burst as he pin-balled off tacklers on his way through the secondary to flip the field. Harris slipped a middle screen pass to Fournette on another third-down snap that gobbled up 15 yards and then floated a perfect strike to Dupre in the end zone on a corner route for the go-ahead score.\nLSU 21, FLORIDA 7 (2:24)\nLSU -- Fournette 3 run (Domingue kick)\nDRIVE: 2 plays-58 yards-51 seconds\nKEY PLAYS: After both teams were flagged on the first snap of the series to prompt a do-over, Harris drifted back on a flea-flicker toss from Fournette and pegged a perfect in-stride bomb to Dupre that devoured 52 yards to the 3-yard-line. Fournette plowed in untouched from there.\nLSU 21, FLORIDA 14 (1:34)\nFlorida -- McGee 19 pass from Harris (Austin Hardin kick)\nDRIVE: 4 plays-80 yards-50 seconds\nKEY PLAYS: The Gators showed some fight by retaliating quickly as Treon Harris got things started with his legs on a 12-yard scramble and then kept another play alive long enough to rifle a pass down the right sideline that Antonio Callaway bobbled but yanked down for a 48-yard reception. On the next play, McGee somehow wound up wide open on a sideline route and scored easily.\nLSU 28, FLORIDA 14 (0:15)\nLSU -- Dupre 50 pass from Harris (Domingue kick)\nDRIVE: 5 plays-75 yards-1:19\nKEY PLAYS: An offsides on Florida gave LSU 5 easy yards and Fournette carved out the next 19 on two carries to get the Tigers near midfield. After a rare loss by the LSU star, Harris zipped a short pass to Dupre to get the ball to midfield and on third down, he sprinted away from pressure, stiff-armed one would-be-tackler and heaved the ball downfield where Dupre yanked it down inside the 5-yard-line, spun and ran to paydirt to cap a zany second quarter.\nTHIRD QUARTER\nLSU 28, FLORIDA 21 (8:03)\nFlorida -- Kelvin Taylor 2 run (Hardin kick)\nDRIVE: 10 plays-66 yards-5:08\nKEY PLAYS: The Gators put together their best offensive series of the game, with Treon Harris igniting the much-needed march. After two runs for 13 yards got things started, Harris lofted a 40-yard strike to wide-open tight end DeAndre Goolsby to move the ball from the Florida 47 to the LSU 23. LSU stiffened and didn't yield a first down until freshman Jordan Scarlett rattled off an 11-yard run on a stretch play on 4 th -and-1 from the 14. Taylor scored on a very similar play.\nLSU 28, FLORIDA 28 (1:04)\nFlorida -- Callaway 72 punt return (Hardin kick)\nKEY PLAYS: LSU's offense went three-and-out for a third consecutive series to keep shifting bits of momentum to Florida and Callaway seized it completely for the Gators when he gathered in a 48-yard Jamie Keehn punt in the middle of the field, dodged two early tackle attempts and found a lane on the left sideline for the TD.\nFOURTH QUARTER\nLSU 35, FLORIDA 28 (10:40)\nLSU -- Domingue 16 run (Domingue kick)\nDRIVE: 11 plays-75 yards-5:24\nKEY PLAYS: Finally some life from the Tigers' offense, and then when things bogged down, some razzle-dazzle from the beleaguered special-teams units. Fournette grinded out 45 yards on six carries, Harris zipped a 15-yard pass to Dural to keep the drive alive on a 3 rd -and-5 from just inside midfield and then things got a little crazy. After the Tigers lost 5 yards on third down, Domingue lined up for a 33-yard field goal, but holder Brad Kragthorpe instead floated the ball to him as he broke to the left and Domingue dashed the distance without getting touched for the go-ahead score.\nRecords: No. 8/11 Florida 6-1, 4-1 SEC; No. 6/5 LSU 6-0, 4-0\nAttendance: 102,321 (hard sellout)\nUp next: Western Kentucky at LSU, 6 p.m. Oct. 23 (ESPNU)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T05:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T07:20:37.633+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
