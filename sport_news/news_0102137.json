But a victory in Douglasville also guarantees that the Indians will continue to be included in the conversation among a four-team race with Newnan (3-1) in determining this year’s region title. \nWith winable games tonight, both East Coweta and Newnan could easily enter next week’s annual meeting with much more than bragging rights on the line, with both title implications and home-field advantage for the postseason at stake. \nBut first, the Indians have to make sure that an injury-plagued Douglas County lineup doesn’t find a way to salvage its season with a victory tonight. The Tigers’ misfortune has included losing senior quarterback Malik Oliver twice so far, the latter in a 49-21 loss to Newnan. Things didn’t get any easier in last week’s 41-0 loss to Westlake, where Douglas County was held to 72 yards total offense. \n“We told the kids that if we don’t take care of this week, next week won’t matter,” Pardue said of tonight’s trip to Douglas County. “I feel like they’ve been snakebit. I’ve gotten to know [head coach] Jason [Respert] real well and he does a good job with that program. I just hope that when they get things going, it’s not against us.” \nBoth teams have been deal- ing with transitions at quarterback due to injury, though \nEast Coweta’s has gone better so far. Sophomore Christian Reid made the first start of his varsity career in last week’s 34-7 homecoming vic- tory. The results were both hit (76 yds rushing, 2 TDs; 4 of 9 passing) and miss (INT). \n“I thought Christian looked poised out there for his first start. He made a couple of mistakes, one of them in the red zone,” Pardue said. “I think the best thing we did was keep him with the varsity last year.” \nJunior Will LaGuardia hasn’t practiced all week while limited to a thigh bruise suffered against Hughes. Pardue said LaGuardia has yet to resume running. \nDouglas County, meanwhile, has gone to junior backup Deven Williams, who went 7-for-10 passing for 61 yards against Westlake. He’s thrown an interception in each of the Tigers’ last three games, which included a 40-15 win over South Cobb on Oct. 9. \nReid couldn’t have a better mentor, though, in Indians quarterback coach J.R. Revere, who knows a thing or two about becoming a starter in the wing-T. \n“He started for me in the wing-T as a tenth grader, so he’s been there before,” Pardue said. \nLast week, East Coweta concentrated on its ground game, rushing 51 times for 387 yards and four touchdowns against Pebblebrook. \nDouglas County has shifted defensive schemes this year, going to a 3-5 formation. \n“We’ve treated this week as we have every week this season,” Pardue said. “We’re working on East Coweta no matter who we play.” \nMatthew Bush and Blake Crow took greater roles in the starting defense for the Indians in their first game since linebacker Alec Jimerson suffered a season-ending knee injury, finishing with eight and seven tackles, respectively. Junior Jeremiah Gemmel also had seven tackles. More", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T09:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T14:11:20.701+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
