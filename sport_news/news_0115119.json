Would you like to be filmed while naked? https://t.co/0cWsGDE5zj\n— Katherine McCarron (@_KatherineWebb) October 19, 2015 While NFL Network reporter Albert Breer interviewed Bengals cornerback Adam \"Pacman\" Jones in the locker room, Cincinnati players could be seen in the background walking to and from the showers. This went on for more than half a minute before a graphic replaced the locker room on the screen.\nCincinnati offensive tackle Andrew Whitworth was the most outspoken player about the incident on Monday. He called for a change in the NFL's media-access rules.\nWe work in large massive stadiums. There's plenty of other spaces to interview. #NoExcuses https://t.co/uLgMYh0eRX\n— Andrew Whitworth (@BigWhit77_fndn) October 19, 2015 \"Being a guy that has been a player rep and a guy that's always been against this policy, it's a great example of why the open (locker) room policy is old and needs to change,\" Whitworth told the Cincinnati Enquirer. \"You can't judge us off who we will and won't accept into our locker room and then say all these things we have to do, but then also put us in a situation where every single day I have to change clothes and be naked or not in front of media. It's just not right. There's no office, there's no other situation in America where you have to do that. It's dated, it's old and it needs to change. ...\n\"This is my office space. I shouldn't have to change in it and be in front of people I don't know or really don't have any purpose for being near me other than the fact they are interviewing other people. If I was a woman, this would be a completely different subject, and it would be a complete firestorm. We can't always just serve women and everyone else. Men deserve a right, too. We have rights. We have privacy. We deserve all the things we want as well. As a man, I think it's right the policy is changed.\"\nThe NFL allows media members to have postgame access to locker rooms after a 10-minute \"cooling off\" period. Locker rooms at team practice facilities are required to be open at least 45 minutes on Mondays, Wednesdays, Thursdays and Fridays.\nwhy do I have to explain to my kids why their dad is naked on tv? @nflcommish ?? @nflnetwork ?? Time for a media policy change!!\n— Andrew Whitworth (@BigWhit77_fndn) October 19, 2015 An NFL Network spokesman said the network regretted the incident.\n\"It was a regrettable mistake by our production team,\" said Alex Riethmiller , NFL Network's vice president of communications, in a statement, \"one where we have already done a pretty thorough review of the procedures and processes by which were dropped along the way to make sure it doesn't happen again. When we say it's a regrettable mistake, I think implied in that is an apology to everyone that was affected, the players, the organization, the viewing public first and foremost.\"\nFOR MORE OF AL.COM'S COMPREHENSIVE COVERAGE OF THE NFL, GO TO OUR NFL PAGE\nThe Bengals, who have a 6-0 record this season, has four former Alabama players – McCarron, defensive end Wallace Gilberry , cornerback Dre Kirkpatrick and offensive tackle Andre Smith – and two former Auburn players – defensive tackle Pat Sims and tight end C.J. Uzomah – on their roster.\nFormer Dallas County High School standout Michael Johnson also plays for Cincinnati, one of the five former Alabama prep stars on the Bengals. Gilberry played at Baldwin County, Kirkpatrick at Gadsden City, McCarron at St. Paul's and Smith at Huffman.\nHere is the video of the interview, with the offending portions blurred:", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/BigWhit77_fndn/status/656107615588626433", "https://t.co/0cWsGDE5zj", "https://twitter.com/_KatherineWebb/status/656217677699162112", "https://twitter.com/nflcommish", "https://t.co/uLgMYh0eRX", "https://twitter.com/BigWhit77_fndn/status/656176955025436673", "https://streamable.com/e/1f8y", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/NoExcuses?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/nflnetwork", "http://www.cincinnati.com/story/sports/nfl/bengals/2015/10/19/andrew-whitworth-frustrated-naked-video-nfl-policy/74227884/"], "published": "2015-10-20T11:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T07:35:12.744+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
