(Photo: Clarence Tabb Jr., Detroit News) \nAuburn Hills — Pistons coach Stan Van Gundy not only attended the Lions' 42-17 loss to the Cardinals, but he also made it a teachable moment for his team.\nHe told his players about the loss and the mistakes that sunk the Lions. It was an important message because he has a young team prone to brilliant moments that can be offset with silly mistakes.\n\"I thought the (Lions') game plan was good,\" Van Gundy said. \"They did a lot of good things, but penalties and the turnovers were too much. And for us, it is turnovers and mistakes. You can't beat yourself.\"\nLions quarterback Matt Stafford threw three interceptions as the Lions turned the ball over five times.\nVan Gundy wants an up-tempo style that could result in mistakes, but hopes to keep them to a minimum.\n\"You can't beat yourself,\" he said. \"(The Lions) were able to move the ball. I think they did a good job of that. It's just they kept giving it away. It was unfortunate.\"\nThe Pistons were in a similar spot last week, committing 21 turnovers in a \"selfish type\" game during a 93-83 loss to the Nets. They rebounded and had nine turnovers during a 117-88 victory over the Bucks last weekend.\n\"(Mistakes) is a fear with any team,\" Van Gundy said. \"For us, turnovers are coming in two ways. One is carelessness, which I thought we did a much better job (against the Bucks). The second thing is we have instances in that we are in such a hurry, we get a bit out of control instead of settling. We had a little bit of that in practice, but they caught themselves.\"\nSlam dunks \nWith back-to-back road games against the Pacers and Bulls, some veteran players will rest one game.\nPoint guard Reggie Jackson and rookie forward Stanley Johnson will play both games.\n... Guard Steve Blake passed the first stage of concussion protocol and could return this week. He rode a stationery bike and appears to be recovering.\nThe Pistons are hopeful he can join the team at the beginning of the season.\nterry.foster@detroitnews.com \ntwitter.com/TerryFoster971 \n\nPistons at Pacers \nTip-off: 7 Tuesday, Bankers Life Fieldhouse, Indianapolis\nRadio: WMGC\nOutlook: This is the first of back-to-back games for Detroit, which heads to Chicago on Wednesday ...
