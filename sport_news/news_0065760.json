In this role, Throwe will manage the day-to-day operations and execute the direction and vision of DNR. \n“Joanne’s level of energy, experience and expertise made her an obvious choice for this role,” Belton said. “Her past experience in financing various environmental initiatives will be a huge asset for DNR as we work to implement and achieve the Chesapeake Bay Watershed Agreement, and other critical departmental initiatives.” \nThrowe brings 25 years of environment and natural resource experience at the state and federal level. Most recently, she served as the director of the University of Maryland Environmental Finance Center, where she provided technical assistance on financing issues related to environmental protection activities to help communities better manage their limited resources. \n“It’s a privilege to work with Governor Hogan and Secretary Belton in this capacity and I look forward to advancing the Administration’s priorities through public and private means,” Throwe said. “I thank them both for this exciting opportunity to help change Maryland for the better.” \nPrior to her work at the Environmental Finance Center, Throwe held leadership roles at the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Cooperative Research and Extension Services, and the USDA Foreign Agricultural Service. She graduated from Central Connecticut State University with a B.A. in Political Science and holds an M.A. in Public Policy and Private Enterprise from the University of Maryland. \nThrowe’s first day will be Wednesday, Oct. 28.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T05:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T09:58:03.368+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
