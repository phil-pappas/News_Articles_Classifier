Fitzgerald, in his 12th season, has reinvented his game after a couple of lean seasons. So, Mitchell isn't exactly sure what to expect when the Steelers host the Cardinals at Heinz Field on Sunday. However, he's looked at the stat sheet and studied enough film to know that Fitzgerald still fuels a balanced attack that relies heavily on his hands and unique blocking skills. “When you look at him this year, they move him around and he plays more in the inside,” Mitchell said. “Usually, your premier receiver plays on the outside like AB (Antonio Brown) is our X. You would think he would play outside, but I think it's a schematic thing. “He's played for so long, he knows how to navigate the waters in between the linebackers and the safeties. He's really killing people a lot because he knows where to sit down.” Fitzgerald leads the Cardinals with 35 receptions, 490 receiving yards and six touchdowns — four more scores than he had all of last season. “They're putting him inside to let him take advantage of those matchups,” Mitchell said. “I think it's a beautiful thing to do, and it's extremely smart of them. We're going to have similar challenges of other teams, trying to figure out how to match up with a No. 1 receiver on the inside. “Whenever you see him at the end of the line, you have to get ready. I have a lot of respect for Fitzgerald as a blocker. Usually, I disregard wide receivers in the run game. I'm being honest because (receivers) can't block you, they don't want to block or they physically can't block you. He's big enough to get your attention.” Still, cornerbacks William Gay and Antwon Blake can't cheat up at the line of scrimmage to defend the run when Arizona deploys its bunch formations. Quarterback Carson Palmer has caught pass defenders out of position to connect with Fitzgerald and John Brown for long completions. “We have to be aware where (Fitzgerald) is on the field,” said Blake, who returned an interception 70 yards for a touchdown against San Diego. “It's important to be on your keys when you're covering him, and you have to respect him in the run game.” Injury report Linebacker Ryan Shazier and safety Will Allen, along with quarterback Ben Roethlisberger, will miss Sunday's game because of injuries. Shazier will be sidelined for the fourth consecutive game with a shoulder injury while Allen sits with an ankle injury. Coach Mike Tomlin said earlier this week that he hoped to have Shazier back in the lineup. Shazier was limited in practice, but hasn't progressed enough physically. Again, Sean Spence will get the start with Vince Williams as his backup. For Allen, it's the first game the 12-year veteran has missed because of injury since a knee injury sidelined him for the AFC Championship game against the New York Jets in 2010. Allen will be replaced in the lineup by fourth-year safety Robert Golden. Golden, making his first NFL start, had three tackles in relief of Allen on Monday. Defensive coordinator Keith Butler opted for Golden over Shamarko Thomas, who lost the job to Allen prior to the season opener at New England. “The chemistry is good between (safety) Mike (Mitchell) and I,” Golden said. “It's not going to be a problem because we've both played strong and free safety. I'm going to just do my job and make the plays that come to me. This game isn't about me starting; it's about getting a victory.” Also, cornerback Cortez Allen (knee) and outside linebacker Jarvis Jones (hip) are listed as questionable. Linebacker James Harrison (illness) and nose tackle Daniel McCullers (knee) are both probable. Putting in the time The Steelers' revamped secondary has worked overtime to deny the big plays that haunted the past three seasons. A seemingly more aggressive secondary has recorded an interception the past three games — including Antwon Blake's 70-yard return for a touchdown at San Diego. “We're playing confident,” Mitchell said. “It's allowed us to be aggressive. We're meeting on our own when we're off. You don't study all that time not to make plays.” Ralph N. Paulk is a staff writer for Trib Total Media.
