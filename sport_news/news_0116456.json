GameDay will originate from Ann Arbor, Mich., where Michigan is set to take on Michigan State in a battle of highly ranked Big Ten contenders.\n\"Rece Davis has asked me to be on GameDay up in Ann Arbor, Michigan, for the Michigan-Michigan State game,\" Spurrier said. \"Right now I'm planning on going. I've never been to the Big House in Ann Arbor. That's one reason I'm going, because it's a new adventure. I'd love to see that big stadium up there.\"\nPatrick then asked if Spurrier had considered a television analyst career full-time.\n\"Oh, I don't know, Dan,\" Spurrier said. \"I'm just not sure. I do want to do something, though. I'm not going to sit around and try to be a real good golfer. I am going to play some golf, but I'm smart enough to know that my best golf days are a little bit behind me.\"\nSpurrier, 70, went 86-49 in 10-plus seasons at South Carolina, including 2-4 this year. Overall, in 26 seasons at Duke, Florida and South Carolina, he was 228-89-2, including seven conference titles and the 1996 national championship.\nYou can watch Spurrier's full interview with Dan Patrick below:", "external_links": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/ez3roKvhFwQ"], "published": "2015-10-15T02:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T21:38:52.161+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
