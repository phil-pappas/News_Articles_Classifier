When she arrived at the party, Tarala rushed toward his aunt exclaiming, “Auntie Jen, Auntie Jen!”\n“All of a sudden he was there in the air. I had to catch him, and we tumbled onto the ground,” Connell testified of her interaction with the 50-pound boy. “I remember him shouting, ‘Auntie Jen, I love you,’ and there he was flying at me.”\nConnell says she didn’t complain at the time because, “it was his birthday party and I didn’t want to upset him.”\nTarala is now 12-years-old. His father accompanied him to court on Tuesday. His mother died last year.\nGavel\nTrending on Facebook\nCouple reveals too much in their engagement announcement Florida baby dies from flakka Video: Florida woman live streams herself while driving drunk according to police Oregon eighth grader suspended for refusing to remove patriotic t-shirt School district cancels Halloween, parents outraged More popular and trending stories", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/CMGNationalNews", "http://www.ctpost.com/news/article/Jury-Aunt-who-sued-8-year-old-gets-zero-6568677.php", "http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/img/photos/2015/10/10/cc/2a/Gavel.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-13T16:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T04:33:30.101+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
