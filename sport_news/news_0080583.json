She joins Agnieszka Radwanska, who pulled out Sunday saying she wanted to recover after winning the Tianjin Open. \n“I don’t feel 100 percent ready. The doctors recommended I rest so that I can recover,” Kerber said in comments released through the tournament organizers. \nSvetlana Kuznetsova, ranked 32nd in the world, wrapped up a straightforward 6-0, 6-3 win over Czech player Katerina Siniakova. She next faces Czech qualifier Klara Koukalova. \nLast year’s Australian Open finalist Dominika Cibulkova of Slovakia also reached the second round with 7-5, 6-1 over Russian wild card entry Elena Vesnina. Awaiting Cibulkova next is a tricky meeting with fifth-seeded Carla Suarez Navarro, who is in the hunt for a place at the tour finals. \nIn the men’s competition, seventh-seeded Joao Sousa of Portugal went out in the first round, losing 7-6 (2), 4-6, 7-5 to Spain’s Daniel Gimeno-Traver. \nSousa had reached the final at the St. Petersburg Open this season, but more success in Russia eluded the Portuguese player as he lost a close match against Gimeno-Traver, who goes on to play either Italy’s Simone Bolelli or France’s Lucas Pouille. \nThere was also an easy win for Russian player Teymuraz Gabashvili, the world No. 57, who swept past Turkish wild card Cem Ilkel 6-2, 6-1. That sets up a second-round meeting with third-seeded Serbian Viktor Troicki. \n___ \nThis story has been corrected to show that Irina-Camelia Begu beat Tsvetana Pironkova 1-6, 7-6 (2), 6-2, not 6-1, 7-6 (2), 6-2 Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T20:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T21:18:58.621+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
