But then Gottlieb turned to a line of inquiry that Webber emphatically did not appreciate: his relationship with former Michigan Fab Five teammate Jalen Rose.\nWebber did not appear in the Rose-produced documentary on the Fab Five, and was not happy that he wasn’t asked to contribute until the filming was almost complete, Webber said. Rose responded to Webber’s criticism by calling him “delusional.” \nWhen Gottlieb asked how things were between Webber and Rose these days, Webber asked the host to repeat the question, then responded: “Wherever it was.”\nAnd it didn’t get any better from there as Gottlieb persisted.\n“I mean, Doug, we ain’t talking about that,” Webber said. “You ain’t getting that interview. I’m talking about Wake Forest. I don’t talk about him. I talked about him one time on ‘The Dan Patrick Show.’ That was it.”\nBut that wasn’t it.\n“I don’t want to answer the question,” Webber said. “So what would you ask me after that? … I respectfully ask you not to ask me that again so you can blow your numbers up for your show. I don’t want to talk about that, Doug.”\nWhen Gottlieb said it was his job to ask the question, Webber said: “I don’t know what it’s like to do your job, Doug, so thank you for explaining that to me.”\n(You may need a towel to clean up the sarcasm dripping from that response.)\nIn the end, Webber wrapped things up with a final reference to his Wake Forest endeavor and a dig at his Gottlieb show experience: “I hope the students sign up, because the class is going to be way more fun than this interview. It’s going to be crazy. Thank you.”\n(H/T CBS Sports — Gottlieb asks Webber about Rose at the 14-minute mark in the video at the bottom of this CBS Sports story .) \nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google Whatsapp Email This article originally appeared on Fox Sports .\nFiled under chris webber ,  jalen rose ,  michigan wolverines", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T14:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T04:11:22.050+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
