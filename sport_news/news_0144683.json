PETERSBURG - \nThe string of wise decisions for Alex Anthopoulos didn’t begin with a call to Colorado. \nThe general manager’s run of success and helping make the Blue Jays 2015 American League East champions began long before obtaining Troy Tulowitzki. \nIt goes back before trading for Josh Donaldson or signing free-agent Russell Martin last fall. \nAnthopoulos was assistant general manager in 2008 and was involved in the decision on Aug. 21, to acquire Jose Bautista, whom the Pittsburgh Pirates had demoted to triple-A Indianapolis after placing the outfielder on waivers. \nAfter receiving approval from GM J.P. Ricciardi, he worked out a deal with the Pirates, sending catcher Robinzon Diaz to the Pirates. \nHe also made the phone call in November of 2012 to San Antonio, Tex., where Gibbons had just finished managing the Padres’ double-A team. The Jays were in need of a manager after John Farrell opted out of his contract and was dealt to the Boston Red Sox on Oct. 21. \nAt first, Anthopoulos discussed a scouting job and a coaching job for Gibbons. And then ... \n“He was good with the players. He is a great in-game manager, handles people well, deals well with the front office and has a good relationship with the media. He checked a lot of boxes as a manager,” said Anthopoulos while sitting in the Jays dugout here Saturday night. “Can he improve on some things sure? We all can. \n“People forget he had a .500 record first time here when the New York Yankees and Boston Red Sox were basically superpowers.” \nThe Red Sox went to post-season play four times from 2004-08 while winning two World Series. The Yankees reached the playoffs four times while the Tampa Bay Rays even reached the Series during that span. \nGibbons, who started this season on the managerial hot seat as the favourite to be the first AL skipper to be fired, is headed for post-season play. \n“I’ll say one thing,” said an advance scout from another club. “Players play hard for him. That’s a good sign. And in three weeks, I haven’t seen Bautista turn around and complain to an ump once. \n“The frustration is still there, but no carrying on like we used to see.” \nAnother scout was impressed with Gibbons’ decision to give the ball to LaTroy Hawkins, who arrived in the Tulowitzki deal and is retiring, to get the final three outs in the 15-2 clincher Wednesday in Baltimore. \nBack in 2012, there was shock and surprise to the Gibbons announcement. Reaction ranged from president Paul Beeston’s initial “are you nuts?” when Anthopoulos told his boss, to yawns from fans, at the arrival of a retread. \nThe Jays’ 2013 “all-in” season with 74 wins was not the fault of the manager and neither was last year when the Jays had 83. This year, there were grumbles when his team sat 50-50 and Gibbons was criticized in some media outlets. \n“It’s lazy to knock the manager. It was my fault, I didn’t get him the players,” said Anthopoulos. \nDuring Gibbons 1.0, he challenged Shea Hillenbrand to a fight, which almost cost him his job as the suits at Rogers Communications human resources department didn’t think it was a proper way to do business ... like letting a president hang for three months was good management. \nHillenbrand’s crime was writing “This Ship is Sinking” on the white board. Gibbons also tussled with lefty Ted Lilly, who didn’t want to give the ball up after almost giving up the lead to the Oakland A’s. \nGibbons 2.0 demoted Kevin Pillar last year after the outfielder was pinch-hit for and over-reacted. He told Brett Lawrie to “shut up and sit down. We’ve got a game to win,” when the third baseman complained loudly why Adam Lind had not tagged up on a shallow fly. And he went the length of the dugout to bark at Melky Cabrera, earning $8-million, for loafing on a single to left that cost the Jays an extra base. \n“He knows when to call a guy out,” said Anthopoulos. “A lot of managers would have let things go until after the game and do it behind closed doors.” \nThere have been plenty of closed-door sessions we don’t know about. \nIn some wawys, Gibbons is like hitting coach Brook Jacoby. Neither wants any credit, nor are they self-promoters. \nThe biggest criticism Anthopoulos has had about Gibbons in his second tenure? \n“A good manager to me is like a good ump, or a good third base coach — you don’t notice him,” said Anthopoulos. “The worst fire storm I can remember was when he pinch hit last September for Ryan Goins, the game went into extras, Steve Tolleson made an error at second and we lost. \n“It was the right move. It didn’t work out.” \nBringing back Gibbons was a good move. \nSo, Cito Gaston of San Antonio, the cradle of Blue Jays managers had guided four Blue Jays teams to post-season play. \nGibbons is tied with Bobby Cox, of Selma, Calif. ,and the Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, for getting the Jays to October ball at once each. \nNot bad company. \nSAUNDERS TO START IN LEFT? \nIt’s been a rough year for Michael Saunders. \nAcquired from the Seattle Mariners for J.A. Happ to be the Blue Jays’ everyday left fielder, Saunders stepped on a sprinkler head at the Bobby Mattick Training Center down in dangerous Dunedin. He made nine starts for the Jays before he had to shut things down. \nBut on Saturday night inside Tropicana Field, the sun finally shone down on Saunders’ locker. \nIt was asked if the Victoria, B.C., native would be the Jays’ left fielder next year? \n“Yes,” general manager Alex Anthopoulos told reporters. “If he’s back and healthy and productive. We didn’t plan on any of that changing at all. It’s a good problem to have. You’ve got Ben Revere playing great and Mike who we think the world of. We’ll see how that all plays out through the off-season and spring training. \n“No harm in having depth. We know guys get hurt.” Sponsored Links", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T04:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T05:56:51.487+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
