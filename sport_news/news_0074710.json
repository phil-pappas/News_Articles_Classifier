It’s no coincidence that Seattle also has the longest playoff drought. \nThe first key decision by new Mariners general manager Jerry Dipoto could very well be the one that determines his legacy. \nSince the departure of Woody Woodward 16 years ago, the Mariners have struggled to maintain continuity in both the GM and managerial positions. In fact, since the seven-season run of Woodward as GM and Lou Piniella as manager ended in 1999, the Mariners have had less continuity at those two spots than any team in baseball. \nEvery franchise except the Mariners has, since 1999, managed at least one run of four consecutive seasons with the same manager and GM. For Seattle, no GM and manager has lasted more than three seasons together over that time. That makes Dipoto’s looming decision on current field boss Lloyd McClendon critical. MLB managerial longevity \nLongest manager/GM combos over consecutive full seasons since 1996: \n12 – Braves (Bobby Cox/John Schuerholz) ‘96-‘07 \n12 – Cardinals (Tony LaRussa/Walt Jocketty) ‘96-‘07 \n12 – Yankees (Joe Torre/Brian Cashman) ’96-‘07 \n11 – Padres (Bruce Bochy/Kevin Towers) ’96-‘06 \n9 – Giants (Bruce Bochy/Brian Sabean) ’07-‘15 \n8 – Red Sox (Terry Francona/Theo Epstein) ’04-‘11 \n8 – Tigers (Jim Leyland/Dave Dombrowski) ’06-‘13 \n8 – Angels (Mike Scioscia-Bill Stoneman) ’00-‘07 \n7 – Indians (Eric Wedge/Mark Shapiro) ’03-‘09 \n7 – Rangers (Ron Washington/Jon Daniels) ’07-‘13 \nGeoff Baker \n“I hope today is the day that I have my last press conference, that I retire a Mariner after multiple World Series championships and having built a great organization with one manager,’’ Dipoto said when asked about the importance of continuity at a Tuesday news conference.

Dipoto’s predecessor, Jack Zduriencik was on his third manager by the time he was fired, continuing a trend where the Mariners couldn’t go more than two or three seasons without announcing a new field boss or GM. \n“Any decision that I make, that will be the goal,’’ Dipoto said of continuity. “I say this – and it’s going to sound a little bit goofy — but every day that I wake up, I want to be as great a parent as I can be. I want to be as great a husband as I can be. I want to be the best general manager that I can be … I want to hire the greatest manager that’s ever managed. \n“It’s a tall order, but that’s what I want to do,’’ he added. “I think the idea that Lloyd (McClendon) is here, that a staff is in place, that a team is ready to go compete, all of those things will be taken into consideration and I am in no rush to judge.’’ \nIt’s no coincidence that teams with some of the longest-serving GM-manager duos the past two decades have also enjoyed the most success. Having a GM and manager familiar with one another often allows a better exchange and implementation of ideas. \nThe New York Yankees won multiple World Series titles and were a perennial contender under manager Joe Torre and GM Brian Cashman. The Atlanta Braves won a championship and 14 division titles in 15 seasons under manager Bobby Cox and GM John Schuerholz. More recently, a nine-year run by San Francisco Giants manager Bruce Bochy and GM Brian Sabean produced three World Series wins the past five seasons. \nThe Boston Red Sox, Los Angeles Angels and Detroit Tigers have all been to the World Series since 2002 with GM-manager combos of eight years. The Texas Rangers made two World Series during seven full seasons of manager Ron Washington and GM Jon Daniels. \nIn contrast, teams that lack continuity have struggled. The Mariners are a case in point. \nThe Toronto Blue Jays squeezed just more than four seasons from manager John Gibbons and GM J.P. Ricciardi from 2004 to late 2008. Previously, their last extended run of management continuity was manager Cito Gaston and GM Pat Gillick, who teamed up for four playoff seasons from the late-1980s to mid-1990s. \nThe Blue Jays had the game’s longest playoff drought at 22 seasons before snapping it last week, passing that dubious claim to the Mariners. \nMariners CEO Howard Lincoln said he’s happy Dipoto is taking time to get to know McClendon. But as much as Lincoln wants managerial stability, he says keeping McClendon was not a requirement of Dipoto getting the job. \n“We’ve had a number of field managers, and that’s not a good thing,’’ Lincoln said. “There’s always an explanation for it, but the fact remains we’ve had a number of field managers. I would prefer that not continue on, but I’m also cognizant of the fact that Jerry (Dipoto) has to make the decisions, not me. And if he chooses to go in a different direction, as I’ve said, I will support him.’’ Geoff Baker: 206-464-8286 or gbaker@seattletimes.com .
