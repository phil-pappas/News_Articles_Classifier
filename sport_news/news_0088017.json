Haffey/Getty Images \nThe intensity of Game 3 of the National League Division Series between the New York Mets and Los Angeles Dodgers on Monday figures to be cranked up a few notches after a controversial play in Saturday's game. Related Giants engineer last-minute victory... \nThe Dodgers won Game 2 by a 5-2 score, evening the best-of-five series at a game apiece. During Los Angeles' pivotal four-run, seventh-inning rally, the Dodgers' Chase Utley used a late slide into second base to foil a double-play attempt. Utley also crashed into Mets shortstop Ruben Tejada, causing him to be taken off the field in a stretcher with a broken right leg. \nOn Sunday night, Major League Baseball suspended Utley for two games. The penalty was set to be served in Games 3 and 4 of the NLDS, but Utley will be allowed to play pending an appeal. \nAccording to a report from ESPN's Karl Ravech, an appeal hearing will not be held Monday, meaning Utley will at least be able to play in Monday night's Game 3. \nUtley's move was not received well by the Mets, who will start right-hander Matt Harvey against Dodgers left-hander Brett Anderson on Monday in New York. \nMets manager Terry Collins has not yet decided on a starting shortstop for Game 3, trying to choose between Matt Reynolds, who was called up from the minors on Sunday, and Wilmer Flores, a second baseman who began the season at short. \nHarvey hit Utley with a pitch earlier this season when the veteran second baseman was with the Philadelphia Phillies. \n\"I think history has kind of shown that he's kind of been in situations like that before,\" said Harvey, who will be pitching a postseason game for the first time. \"I know personally, you know, after watching in 2010 and hearing about it with Ruben as well, you know, there's some situations that need to be taken care of.\" \nUtley reportedly tried to apologize to Tejada on Sunday, sending a message through a Mets player that he did not mean to injure the New York shortstop. \nRegarding possible retaliation against his team, Mattingly said, \"Just one of those things I don't really concern myself with. We've been involved with a few things over the years, and we really don't start anything, but we've never backed away. The five years I've been here, we've had a few altercations. I don't feel like we've started any of them, but we really haven't backed away either.\" \nHarvey's No. 1 priority has to be the Dodgers' hitters, and Monday's start will be his first appearance on the mound since Oct. 3, when he pitched six innings, struck out 11 and yielded one unearned run. \nHarvey finished the season with a 13-7 record and a 2.71 ERA, and he yielded just two earned runs over his final three starts covering 17 2/3 innings. \nAnderson went 10-9 with a 3.69 ERA during the regular season. He last pitched Oct. 1, and he was not particularly sharp in his last three starts, yielding 13 earned runs and 24 hits in 16 1/3 innings. Distributed by LAKANA and The Sports Xchange.
