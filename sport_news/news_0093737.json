Yes, Hot Springs is rolling, but their weak schedule catches up with them here. 28-14 Colts Farmington vs. Piedra Vista Battle for Durango (JK). Piedra Vista edges out district rival in OT. This would could go either way. 38-31 Panthers Chaparral @ Valencia Great story out of Chaparral to see the Lobos at 4-1, but Friday these Lobos won't be able to keep up with the Jaguars. 33-17 Valencia Alamogordo @ Artesia Game outcome changes with Houghtaling not playing for Artesia (or does it) Alamogordo is about to win another statement game. 41-30 Tigers Cibola vs. Volcano Vista Battle for Rainbow Road (JK) It's a rivalry game, so throw it all out the window. Back and fourth game with a lot of emotion. 34-21 Hawks West Mesa vs. Valley Valley opens up district in style rolling past the Mustangs. Michael Barboa goes for 200+ in back to back weeks. 35-14 Vikings Goddard @ Carlsbad This is going to be a tough game for the Rockets. Carlsbad is the best 0-6 team maybe ever? Upset city baby! Carlsbad tops Goddard in thriller 21-19 La Cueva @ Eldorado Rivlary Game, La Cueva is healthy, could it be close Friday? Anything is possible, but feel that after halftime, Eldo pulls away. Can I get a EL? Eagles 35-17 Moriarty @ Roswell Pintos are riding into the Wool Bowl with a 4-2 record, but Roswell is peaking at the right time. Coytoes 28-14 Portales @ Hope Biggest game both teams have played in. Is Hope for real? We're about to find out Saturday.
