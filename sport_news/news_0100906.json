Manchester United and City were made to work hard for 2-1 wins against German clubs Wolfsburg and Borussia Moenchengladbach, respectively, on Wednesday, 24 hours after Chelsea and Arsenal had both crashed to defeats. Former United star Ronaldo, meanwhile, scored his 500th career goal and then equalled Raul Gonzalez Blanco’s club record tally of 323 goals for Real Madrid as the Spaniards won 2-0 against Malmo in Sweden. Both Manchester sides were looking to bounce back from defeats in their opening Champions League group games two weeks ago and United got their campaign back on track in Group B, although only after falling behind. Daniel Caligiuri put Wolfsburg in front after just five minutes at Old Trafford, but Juan Mata won and converted a penalty to pull United level before the break. Mata then produced a superb flick to set up Chris Smalling, who scored the winner early in the second half. The Premier League leaders now find themselves in a four-way tie on three points in Group B after CSKA Moscow defeated PSV Eindhoven 3-2 in Russia in the night’s other game. Meanwhile, City had Sergio Aguero to thank for winning and then scoring a last-gasp penalty as they beat Gladbach 2-1 at Borussia-Park in Group D, securing a precious victory after they lost at home to Juventus in their first outing. It was a happy ending to a difficult evening, with the Bundesliga side missing the chance to open the scoring in the first half when Raffael won a penalty, only to see his kick saved by Joe Hart. They did go in front through Lars Stindl nine minutes after the restart, but City equalised when a Nicolas Otamendi shot took a decisive deflection off Andreas Christensen before Aguero’s heroics. It is Juventus who top the section, though, after Alvaro Morata and Simone Zaza netted to clinch a merited 2-0 win over Sevilla in Turin. ‘No limits’\nIn Sweden, Mateo Kovacic and Isco combined to set up Ronaldo for the opener, his 500th career goal in 753 games, in the first half of Madrid’s clash with Malmo in Group A. The hosts had Yoshimar Yotun sent off before Ronaldo made sure of the win at the death, and equalled Raul’s tally. “Hopefully, he has no limits. I said he was unquestionable in the past and his merit is what he has done in far less time than the rest. That adds more value to what he achieved,” said coach Rafa Benitez. —Reuters", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T08:03:56.866+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
