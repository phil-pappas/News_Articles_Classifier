Pete Simpson, a Portland police spokesman.\nThe incident occurred near the Marquam Bridge, Simpson said. Southbound motorists on Interstate 5 were blocked from entering Interstate 405, Simpson said.\nThe man was on the freeway, and he appeared to be under the influence of drugs or suffering from mental health issues â€“ or both, Simpson said.\nScanner traffic indicated that officials closed the freeway before 11 p.m. and reopened it shortly after 11:30 p.m.\nIt wasn't immediately clear whether an arrest was made.\n-- Luke Hammill\nlhammill@oregonian.com\n503-294-4029\n@lucashammill", "external_links": ["http://www.twitter.com/lucashammill"], "published": "2015-10-09T07:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T14:37:36.163+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
