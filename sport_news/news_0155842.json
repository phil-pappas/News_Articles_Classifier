By ROB OESTERLE - roesterle@shawmedia.com \nMORRIS – When it gets to this time of the football season, every game is a big one. Related Links Morris football gets shut out by Yorkville \nNone will come bigger for Morris than Friday’s game against Kaneland – which also will be homecoming and senior night for the Redskins. The varsity game is scheduled to kick off at 7:15 p.m. \nBoth teams enter the game with 3-3 records and neither wants to add a fourth loss to the ledger and begin fighting for their playoff lives next week. Both teams also are coming through Northern Illinois Big 12 East losses, with Morris falling, 35-21, to DeKalb last week, and Kaneland falling, 35-7, to Sycamore. \n“We are two pretty evenly matched teams,” Morris coach Alan Thorson said. “If you look at the conference right now, aside from DeKalb (which is 5-1), everyone else is 3-3. Someone is going to get left out of the playoffs, and we don’t want it to be us. \n“I am sure this is going to be another battle with Kaneland, and we have had some great games with them over the years. We know Kaneland isn’t going to drive all the way down here and just hand it to us. We are going to have to play well.” \nPenalties at inopportune times were the theme in Morris’ first two losses of the season, but the Redskins officially did not have any penalties in Friday night’s game against DeKalb. The one flag thrown against them was declined. That’s a trend Thorson would like to see continue. \n“If the team that showed up last week, especially in the second half, shows up for us again this week, then I like our chances,” he said. “If we don’t make the key mental mistakes, I like our chances against anybody. That seems strange to say with a 3-3 record, but I really believe that if we don’t beat ourselves, this team can play with any team out there.” \nKaneland features its typical spread offense and has put up plenty of points this season – 171 to be exact. However, they have allowed 173 points, which is the most of any team in the conference. Morris has allowed the fewest points in the conference through six games with 97, while scoring 141. \n“They are a spread team and they have some good players,” Thorson said. “Their quarterback [Jake Marczuk] can throw pretty well and he will run it, too. They also have a freshman running back, Jonathan Alstott, that’s [former NFL star] Mike Alstott’s nephew, and he runs pretty well. They will spread it out and run a lot of stuff out of a lot of different formations. Our defense is going to have to be prepared for anything.” \nMorris came into last year’s meeting with Kaneland with a 2-4 record and came away with a 26-21 road win that started a five-game winning streak that saw the Redskins reach the Class 5A quarterfinals. \n“This was the game that was the turning point for our season last year,” Thorson said. “Obviously, right now, we would feel better having six wins at the end of the year, but we have to get this one first. \n“I don’t think Homecoming will be any distraction to our guys. They know what’s at stake, and being on our home field should help. It’s a big game for them, with Homecoming and Senior Night. They will be ready to go.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T05:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T08:42:15.573+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
