(Photo: AFP) Colombo : Sri Lanka captain Angelo Mathews gave his backing to spin bowler Tharindu Kaushal despite a ban for one of his bowling actions, raising the prospect of him being selected for the upcoming test series against the West Indies.\nThe International Cricket Council has banned Kaushal's way of bowling a \"doosra\" — a ball delivered with an off spinner's action but which spins away from a right-handed batsman — because it exceeds the level of allowed elbow flexion.\nHowever, the ICC cleared the 22-year-old Kaushal to bowl his stock ball, the off spin.\nMathews said that he and the team management hoped to rectify Kaushal's doosra action and have it cleared as well.\nThe two-test series between the two sides starts on October 14.\n\"We strongly believe that Kaushal is a very valuable player in the side.\nThere is no problem with his off spin and we hope to rectify his doosra and have it cleared as well,\" Mathews told a news conference.\n\"We have a lot of trust in him.\"\nBoth teams are in transition after the retirement of many experienced players.\nJason Holder, 23, leads the West Indies in a test series for the first time and the team is without players like Chris Gayle and Shivnarine Chanderpaul.\nCoach Phil Simmons is suspended pending an inquiry after his criticism of selection of the limited-overs side for the Sri Lanka tour. Selection committee member Eldine Baptiste has taken over coaching responsibilities in the interim.\nHolder said Simmons' suspension was a setback for the team, but hoped he returns soon.\n\"No doubt it is a bit of a setback for us, but at this present stage all we can focus on is cricket,\" he said.\n\"I hope the situation with him is solved, and solved quickly because we'd love to have him back. He's been a wonderful inspiration to our team thus far.\"\nSri Lanka is without a permanent head coach after Marvan Atapattu resigned last month, following successive home test series defeats against Pakistan and India.\nOrganisers announced that the series will be played for the Sobers-Tissera trophy, named after West Indies great Garfield Sobers and Sri Lanka pre-test era captain, Michael Tissera.\nPages 1 2 next › last » Tags: Cricket Tharindu Kaushal Sri Lanka Angelo Mathews doosra Also Read Sri Lankan off-spinner Tharindu Kaushal barred from bowling 'doosra' Sri Lankan offie Tharindu Kaushal reported for suspect bowling action Angelo Mathews hits ton, Pakistan to chase 377 Preparation not ideal to tackle India: Angelo Mathews", "external_links": ["http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/connect.php/js/FB.Share", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/Tkaushal.jpg", "https://apis.google.com/js/plusone.js", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/151007/sports-cricket/article/angelo-mathews-backs-tharindu-kaushal-despite-ban", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/styles/article_node_view/public/Tkaushal.jpg", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php", "http://vuukle.com/js/vuukle.js"], "published": "2015-10-08T01:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-07T14:37:22.601+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
