(AP) Clint Bowyer will spend next season with HScott Motorsports before he takes over for Tony Stewart in 2017. \nBowyer was released from his contract with Michael Waltrip Racing because the team is folding at the end of the season. He was named this week as Stewart's successor in the No. 14 Chevrolet. Stewart is retiring from Sprint Cup racing following the 2016 season. \nBowyer now has a ride with team owner Harry Scott in a deal that will give him a seat and likely team support from Stewart-Haas Racing. \nHScott Motorsports fielded Chevrolets this season for Justin Allgaier and Michael Annett. \nBowyer is 16th this season in the Chase for the Sprint Cup championship standings. Barring a victory, Bowyer will not advance to the second round.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T19:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T19:45:39.977+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
