The clutch putt that turned a rookie into the hero. The stubbed chip that made the local star cover his face with both hands as if he wanted to hide. The Presidents Cup, packed with raw emotion and endless nerves, was unlike any other over the last 10 years. Except for the outcome. The Americans won for the sixth straight time Sunday when Chris Kirk made a 15-foot birdie putt to win his match in a stunning turnaround on the final hole, and Bill Haas provided a storybook ending with the winning point for his team and for his father. \"A moment I'll never forget,\" U.S. captain Jay Haas said, so choked up when it ended that he couldn't speak. Haas used a captain's pick on his son, sent him off in the 12th and final singles match at the Jack Nicklaus Golf Club Korea and then saw Bill Haas hit all the right shots to hold off Bae Sang-moon for a 2-up victory. The 15½-14½ margin was the slimmest since the famous tie in South Africa in 2003. Not since 2005 has the Presidents Cup been decided by the final match. That's what the International team wanted when it demanded the number of matches be reduced (from 34 to 30). It almost got something even better — the shiny gold trophy that again stays with the Americans. \"Irrelevant of the outcome — we obviously would have loved to have won — we put on a show of golf this week,\" captain Nick Price said. The final session was not without its share of heartbreak. Anirban Lahiri, the first player from India to make the International team, battled Kirk shot-for-shot over the final hour holes and looked like a winner when he played a delicate pitch to perfection on the par-5 18th and had 4 feet for birdie. Kirk's chip ran 15 feet by. Based on the status of other matches still on the course, it looked like the International team would finally emerge a winner. And then Kirk made his putt on the final turn, and one of the most stoic players on the PGA Tour unleashed a fist pump. Moments later, Lahiri missed. His putt caught the right edge of the cup and spun out, and he dropped his putter over his back in disbelief. \"I have to give credit to Chris for making that putt,\" Lahiri said. \"These things are scripted, I guess, and I wasn't in the script this time.\" Neither was Bae, the only player under the Korean flag who was playing for the final time before he starts mandatory military service. When it became evident the Presidents Cup would be decided by his match with Haas, the American was 1 up and not giving away any shots. Bae holed a 10-foot putt on the 16th to halve the hole. He came within inches of holing a bunker shot on the 17th to halve the hole, which assured the Americans would do no worse than tie. Page 2 of 3 - Facing that tough chip below the 18th green, Bae hit it heavy and the gallery groaned as it rolled back to his feet. He crouched over that covered his face as his caddie, Matt Minister, placed a hand on Bae's shoulder to console him. Bae chipped about 12 feet by the hole, and when Haas blasted out of a bunker to 8 feet, Bae conceded the putt. \"I wanted to make the winning point for the team, but at the end of the day, our team lost,\" Bae said. \"So I was very sad and disappointed about it.\" The Americans had a one-point lead going into the decisive singles session, and for the longest time, appeared to be in control all day. They had early leads in nine matches. The International side had to have all the close matches go their way, and that's what happened. Marc Leishman took his first lead against Jordan Spieth on the 15th hole and made a 7-foot putt on the 18th for a 1-up victory. Hideki Matsuyama won the 18th hole with a birdie to beat J.B. Holmes. Two halves were just as critical. Louis Oosthuizen hit a splendid second shot to 12 feet for eagle on the 18th and tied Patrick Reed, and Thongchai Jaidee escaped with a half-point against Bubba Watson in the most unlikely scenario. Thongchai drove into the water and saved par, while Watson missed a 5-foot birdie putt. Phil Mickelson had an unbeaten record (3-0-1) for the third time in the Presidents Cup, trouncing Charl Schwartzel. Zach Johnson also went unbeaten in easily beating Jason Day, the PGA champion and No. 2 player in the world who failed to win a match this week. The shortest match belonged to Adam Scott, who won six straight holes against Rickie Fowler and ended it on the 13th green. LPGA Malaysia KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia — Jessica Korda won the LPGA Malaysia for her fourth tour title, closing with a 6-under 65 in sweltering conditions for a four-stroke victory. After winning twice last season, the 22-year-old American entered the week with only one top-10 finish this year, a tie for second in January in Florida in the season-opening event. She made five birdies in a seven-hole stretch that ended on the 10th, dropped a stroke on the par-4 11th and sealed it with birdies on the par-3 15th and 17th. Second-ranked Lydia Ko, No. 3 Stacy Lewis and 2014 winner Shanshan Feng tied for second. Korda finished at 18-under 266 and earned $300,000. She opened with rounds of 69, 67 and 65 to take a two-stroke lead into the final day. The weekend 65s are her two best scores this year. Ko finished with a 66. The 18-year-old New Zealander was coming off consecutive victories in Canada and France, where she became the youngest major champion. Feng also had a 66, and Lewis shot 67. Page 3 of 3 - SAS Championship SAS CHAMPIONSHIP CARY, N.C. — Tom Lehman had an eagle and three birdies in the final four holes to win the Champions Tour's SAS Championship. The 56-year-old Lehman birdied the par-4 15th and 16th, eagled the par-5 17th and birdied the par-4 18th for a 7-under 65 and a one-stroke victory over Joe Durant. Lehman finished at 12-under 204 at Prestonwood Country Club and earned $315,000 for his ninth victory on the 50-and-over tour.
