The next longest? 14 yards, to another running back (Trevor Bouma). \n“That’s just Missouri Valley football, I think,” said Saeger, who completed 9-of-25 passes. “There’s a lot of tugging going on, and their corners did a good job of getting up in their face and not letting them get a clean release.” \nThe Coyotes certainly had a chance early to stretch the field, but a deep pass on their first drive was narrowly missed by receiver Eric Shufford (who would catch a team-high three passes). After that point, there were few times when a USD receiver or tight end had much space between them and a defender. \n“It’s totally what you see, it’s kind of vogue in football right now, people get up and get in your face,” Glenn said. “It’s kind of a streetball. And we didn’t handle it.” \nThe question now is, how much of that style will the Coyotes see throughout the rest of the Missouri Valley schedule? \n“I don’t think there was anything really different that we’ve seen thus far this year, but we’ll see more of it as the year goes on,” Saeger said. \n“It’s something we have to practice and get better at, I guess.” \nFollow @jhoeck on Twitter", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T05:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T03:39:19.030+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
