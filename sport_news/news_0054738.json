But although Kinnelon's gamesmanship kept them within striking distance, in the end it was the Panthers' grinding running game and vicious defensive front that decided the contest. Photo by Joe Phalon Jon Toye and the Kinnelon offense was hounded by a strong Pequannock defense on Friday night. \n\"When you have a rivalry game – these guys have played against each other since they were in third grade – you can kinda throw the records out the window,\" Kopp said. \"We made some key plays at key moments, and we were able to execute … the kids are gamers, and they understand what's at stake.\" \nPequannock started quickly, scoring on a 15-yard touchdown run by quarterback Tommy Crooks on its first drive, and again late in the second quarter when Crooks capped a mammoth 19-play, 95-yard drive with a touchdown dive from three yards out. They missed the extra point, and held a 13-0 lead. \nA promising Kinnelon drive early in the second quarter ended when running back Chris Hausler was stuffed on a fourth-and-three from the Pequannock five-yard line, and Pequannock's overwhelming defensive front often kept the Colts off-balance. Kopp said his front seven played an \"outstanding game,\" and tight coverage by the secondary complemented the effort. \nWhen Pequannock running back Sean Klimek scored on a 10-yard touchdown run midway through the third quarter, the game began to turn decisively in the Panthers' favor. \nKlimek later said he could feel the momentum shift after the score, which he attributed to the blocking of the offensive line and fullback. \n\"It put the game away,\" he said. \nKinnelon (0-5) did get on the scoreboard on a 1-yard Hausler run late in the fourth, but did not attempt an onside kick. \nPequannock will take their four-game win streak into Newton next week, where the 3-3 Braves – who defeated Wallkill Valley 41-0 Friday night – are waiting. \nAlthough everyone on the Panther roster is healthy for the first time this year just as the team hits the home stretch, Kopp won't let players look too far into the future because \"that's what gets you beat.\" \n\"I think the kids themselves …. They're not satisfied. They know they can play better and we have to continue to play better,\" he said. \"We're on a mission right now … but it can only be done one foot in front of the other.\" \nEmail: janoski@northjersey.com © 2015 North Jersey Media Group Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T07:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T00:30:50.575+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
