So there is no question of that,\" he said.\nGRIEVANCES RAISED\nForce India, Sauber and Lotus first raised grievances about the distribution of revenues a year ago when the Caterham and Marussia teams went into administration and there was a risk of others following.\nIndebted Lotus, now seemingly set to be taken over by Renault after fending off attempts to put them into administration, have not joined in the EU complaint.\nIn a letter to commercial supremo Bernie Ecclestone , the three teams spoke then of a \"a questionable cartel\" controlling \"both the governance of Formula One and, apparently, the distribution of... funds.\"\nA briefing note after the formal complaint to the EU spoke of 'unfair' side payments and 'unlawful practices'.\nTop teams Mercedes, Ferrari, McLaren , Williams and Red Bull receive special payments in recognition of past performance and sit with the commercial rights holder and governing FIA on the sport's core decision-making 'strategy group'.\nThe smaller teams say the system is skewed unfairly in favour of the big ones who are guaranteed millions of dollars regardless of how they perform on the track and also get to determine future rule changes.\nFernley, whose team are also on the Strategy Group as the 'best of the rest', said the smaller teams had been assured by majority rights holders CVC that something would be done about the distribution of revenues but nothing had happened.\nRIGHT APPROACHES\n\"They've had a year to be able to make the right approaches, to be able to put something in position that had been promised if you like after the Austin Grand Prix,\" he said.\n\"The only way it can work now is for CVC to be accountable to a body that has the power to be able to bring them to task.\n\"I think 12 months of opportunity to correct things, or at least to be seen to be moving in the right direction, is more than enough time. And clearly that hasn't happened and we need to refer it to a body that has the powers to look into it independently,\" he added.\nFernley, who has put his head above the parapet in the past as deputy to the team's Indian drinks magnate owner Vijay Mallya , said he wanted to ensure the existing private teams survived and others might still be able to enter.\nIf that meant he had to pay a personal price, so be it.\n\"You've got to say, are you prepared to stand up for what you believe?,\" said the Briton, who has worked with Mallya since the 1970s when they bought and sold old Formula One cars and raced them in India.\n\"I had a very privileged life for 30 years with motor racing, I would hate to think that the way Formula One is going spirals it down to a point where other people are not going to be able to have that opportunity.\"", "external_links": ["http://www.zigwheels.com/newcars/Renault", "http://www.speakingtree.in/topics/nature/lotus"], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T23:37:23.924+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
