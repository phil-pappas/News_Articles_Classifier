Washington State won the day \nWashington State doesn't win very often at Oregon. \nIn fact, before the Cougars' 45-38 double-overtime win that dropped the Ducks to a mediocre 3-3 on the season, the last Wazzu win at Autzen Stadium came in 2006. \nOn a day inspired by Oregon's \"pioneer\" uniforms with a design dedicated to portions of the Oregon trail, Washington State's Twitter handle celebrated the victory appropriately. — WSU Cougars (@WSUCougars) October 11, 2015 \nHopefully Wazzu stocked up on provisions, ammo and clothing to make it through the rest of the journey. Dabo Swinney wants you to stop saying 'Clemsoning' \nDefine \"Clemsoning.\" According to the Urban Dictionary , it is \"the action of delivering an inexplicably disappointing performance, usually within the context of a college football season.\" \nIt's a term that has been thrown around by college football fans (and some media) over the past several seasons, alluding to a strong start of the season that precedes a staggering middle of the season by Clemson. \nAnd Tigers coach Dabo Swinney is tired of it, as he mentioned in a fiery rant directed at a reporter following Clemson's 43-24 demolition of Georgia Tech. \n\"We ain't lost to anybody unranked since 2011, but I have to come to press conference in 2015 and get asked that,\" Swinney said. \"That's all media bull crap … it's a lack of respect. It's not doing your homework and paying attention to what reality is. \n\"Should not be asked that question. Period.\" \nWatch the complete answer in the video below . UConn continues to play for a made-up trophy \nFresh off a 30-13 loss at BYU, Connecticut jumped back into American Athletic Conference play with a road game at Central Florida. Or as the Huskies call it, the \"Civil ConFLiCT\" (get it?). \nToo bad the Knights disagree. But hey, at least UConn has its own trophy. — UConn Football (@UConnFootball) October 8, 2015 \nFor the record, the Huskies took home the \"trophy\" after a 40-13 win in Orlando on Saturday. \nOf course, UConn doesn't accept every result in the series — as UCF Twitter users have pointed out. @UConnFootball @UCF_Football You forgot to add the 62-17 beatdown in Orlando. Have therapy sessions wiped the memory? pic.twitter.com/MAAmt3JzOy \nTo paraphrase Regina from \"Mean Girls:\" \"Stop trying to make Civil ConFLiCT happen, UConn; it's not going to happen. Chubb loss \nAll is not bad or silly or hurtful on the Internet, though. \nGeorgia running back Nick Chubb went out of Saturday's 38-31 loss to Tennessee that shook up the SEC East race with an injury to his posterior collateral ligament, and it didn't take long for former SEC stars to reach out to the injured standout. \nNaturally, former Bulldog rusher Todd Gurley was among the first. Prayers for my boy Chubb. SMH — Todd Gurley II (@TG3II) October 10, 2015 \nSouth Carolina alum Marcus Lattimore, who knows plenty about knee injuries , also extended a hand of support. Praying for a clear conscience for the GREAT Nick Chubb. God doesn't make mistakes. — Marcus Lattimore (@MarcusLattimore) October 10, 2015 \nFormer Georgia/all-everything standout Herschel Walker, Florida quarterback alum Tim Tebow and one-time Bulldogs quarterback Aaron Murray were also among those who reached out via Twitter. Keep your head up @NickChubb21 !!! — Herschel Walker (@HerschelWalker) October 10, 2015 Praying for you @NickChubb21 — Tim Tebow (@TimTebow) October 10, 2015 Wow! Prayers up to my brother Chubb — Aaron Murray (@aaronmurray11) October 10, 2015 \nFootball is often described as a fraternity, and it's cool to see the brotherhood of ex-players and — in some cases — rivals, when tragedy strikes.
