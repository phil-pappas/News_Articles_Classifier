Willard guided Louisville against a Pitino-led Puerto Rican national team in August. \nWillard expressed disappointment in a statement Monday, but Pitino said his concern is making sure Willard \"gets healthy and has a speedy recovery from some problems that need immediate attention.\" \nPadgett was a three-year Cardinals starter from 2005-08 and played professionally in Spain before serving three seasons as an IUPUI assistant. Pitino said Padgett \"knows the system as well as anyone here\" and expects a smooth transition. \nAll content copyright ©2015 Pendleton Times-Post, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T23:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T00:06:15.643+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
