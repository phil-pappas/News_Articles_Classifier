He says it doesn't mean anything extra to beat Marrone, but that smile says otherwise. Ask his teammates and they'll tell you, too. \n\"I know that's probably going to give EJ a lot of motivation,\" tight end Chris Gragg said. \"I know he's going to go out there and want to play harder. We really want to get this win against the Jaguars.\" \nGragg is one of the only players who admit that Marrone being on the sideline is a bit of a motivator. Center Eric Wood said he's \"not really worried about it.\" Gragg said Marrone has been a topic of conversation, though, and that the Bills circled this game on the schedule. \n\"It gives you a little bit of motivation,\" Gragg said. \"Last year, it was the best season Buffalo's had in a long time, best one since I've been here. I was with him all his years that he was in Buffalo and it was kind of a shock. Yeah, it will be a little extra bulletin board pump up for us. \n\"Some of us old players have, you know what I'm saying? Just sitting in the meeting room watching them on film like, 'Oh, I see what they're trying to do.'\" \nFor some, the mere mention of Marrone's name makes things awkward. General manager Doug Whaley was asked whether there was added motivation playing against Marrone and quickly steered the topic away. \n\"No, not whatsoever,\" Whaley said. \"We gotta look at it this way: We're three-and-three right now. We want to go into the bye four-and-three, and what we want to do is hold serve with these rash of injuries. If we can come out of this and go into the bye four-and-three, I think we'll be in a good position because we'll start getting a lot of those guys back and then make a final push for the end of the season.\" \nManuel said he doesn't hold a grudge, and if he sees Marrone before the game he'll happily say hello. Gragg echoed that. When asked whether he would catch up with his old co-worker, Whaley didn't exactly light up at the idea. \n\"I mean I'm out here working, so ...\" Whaley said. \nWe'll take that as a \"no.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T18:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T21:19:40.194+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
