Subban, right, and center Tomas Plekanec congratulate goalie Mike Condon as the Canadiens defeat the Ottawa Senators in an NHL hockey game, Sunday, Oct. 11, 2015 in Ottawa, Ontario. (Adrian Wyld/The Canadian Press via AP) MANDATORY CREDIT \nOTTAWA, Ontario (AP) — Tomas Plekanec scored twice in the first period and Mike Condon made 20 saves in his NHL debut to help the Montreal Canadiens beat the Ottawa Senators 3-1 on Sunday night. \nThe 25-year-old Condon allowed only Jean-Gabriel Pageau’s short-handed goal midway through the second period in the Senators’ home opener. Torrey Mitchell added a goal for Montreal in the third period. \nMontreal improved to 3-0-0, while Ottawa dropped to 2-1-0. \nMatt O’Connor made 31 saves for Ottawa in his NHL debut. \nPlekanec opened the scoring at 9:41 of, beating O’Connor with a sharp angle shot. Plekanec added his third the season with 1:26 left, breaking in alone and beat O’Connor through the legs. \nPageau pulled Ottawa with one in a 2-one-1 break with Curtis Lazar. \nMitchell redirected P.K. Subban’s shot from just inside the blue line at 5:41 of the third, leaving O’Connor with little chance. \nNotes: Senators owner Eugene Melnyk took part in a ceremonial opening faceoff with his two daughters. He had a liver transplant this year. … Condon and O’Connor are the first goalies to make their first NHL starts in the same game since Oct. 14, 1967.
