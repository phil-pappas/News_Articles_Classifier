The sophomore from Iowa had gotten action on kick returns in 2014, whenever John Tidwell or David Clark got gassed or the Cougars didn’t want them to take to many knocks. \nBut in USF’s game against Minnesota-Duluth on Sept. 19, there was no other choice but Groeneweg. An injured oblique took Tidwell down, so it was Groeneweg on punts. The Clark hurt his shoulder, so it was Groeneweg on kickoffs. \n“In those kind of situations, you have to be mentally prepared for that,” Groeneweg said. “You have to know going into that game (that) okay, I’m the next guy up if John or David goes down.” \nWhether it was Groeneweg’s preparedness making the difference or the Cougars’ exceptional offensive depth paying off, USF hasn’t suffered a bit on kickoff returns. Groeneweg leads the Northern Sun Intercollegiate Conference in kickoff return average yardage and is second in punt returns. \nThat success culminated in his performance last Saturday against Wayne State, when Groeneweg set a school record with a 99-yard kickoff return for a touchdown and earned NSIC Special Teams Player of the Week honors. \nThat return was a simple one from Groeneweg. He caught the kickoff near the goal line, surveyed his blocks and found the opening where he could use the speed that made him a state champion in the 200 meters in high school. He hit the hole and he was gone. \n“I give all credit to the guys blocking for me, becasue they made it as easy as it can get,” Groeneweg said. “If you’ve seen it on film, the hole was huge.” \nThat’s the plan for Groeneweg: Speed over trickery. Though he won’t totally rule it out for the future, he’s not about to put any Dante Hall-style runs of cutbacks and jukes and field reversals together.

The senior cornerback has certainly earned the reps, with four touchdowns and punt and kickoff returns. \nBut between the team wanting to keep Tidwell healthy and Groeneweg showing that he’s completely capable in his current role, the sophomore likely won’t become strictly a backup. \n“This wasn’t just a replacement thing, while John and David are hurt,” Cougars head coach Jed Stugart said. \nGroeneweg gives an already lethal Cougars offense another area for opposing defense to stress over. And while he’s still behind more experienced players like Josh Angulo, Brady Rose and Garrett Shutt in the wide receiving corps, getting more time on the field can only help. \n“You get more comfortable being out there,” Groeneweg said. “And I feel like the more reps you take out on the field, the more comfortable you get overall.” \nHis success on returns also lets his teammates share in the glory, as blockers are as important a part of a return as the man running with the ball. \n“Give me a shoutout, Groeneweg!” yelled wide receiver Andrew Buchele he left practice on Tuesday. “I block for you!” 2 CONNECT 6 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://argusne.ws/1LiEC1w TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T00:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T01:54:12.050+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
