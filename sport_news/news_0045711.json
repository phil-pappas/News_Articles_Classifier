South) followed by a pair of service aces by Gabrielle Martin (DeMotte, Ind./ Kankakee Valley) to put the Black and Gold within one, 9-8. \nThe Tigers would take a 13-11 lead before Akeelah Muhammad (Chicago Heights, Ill./Bloom Township/Kishwaukee) recorded a kill to tie the match, 13-13. \nBoth teams would trade the next several points, until the Peregrines took an 18-16 advantage after an ace by Carley Bartolini (Portage, Ind./Chesterton) gave the Black and Gold momentum heading in to an ONU timeout. \nThe Tigers would eventually tie the match at 19-19 before taking a 22-20 on a kill from Becky DeRuiter. \nThe Peregrines would use the Tigers miscues to tie the match at 22-22, but ONU would rattle off the next three points to take a 25-22 Set 1 win. \nOlivet would take the second set 25-15, followed by a 25-16 victory in the third set to solidify their 3-0 victory. \nThe Peregrines were lead by Carissa Jones (Hammond, Ind./ Bishop Noll) who recorded five kills and a match high 11 digs, while Bartolini registered 17 assists to lead Purdue Calumet in the setback. \nThe Black and Gold return to action Saturday, Oct. 10, as they travel to Upland, Ind. to play in the Taylor University Tri-Match. The Peregrines will face the host Taylor University at 10:30 a.m. followed by a 1:00 p.m. match with St. Catherine at Odle Arena.
