The Galaxy (14-10-9) conceded the most goals at home since Sept. 12, 2009, in a 6-3 loss to FC Dallas. \nAdi tied it at 1 in the 65th minute with a turnaround left-footed strike from the middle of the box. Three minutes later, he converted from the spot to give Portland the lead for good. \nDiego Chara netted a leaping header to make it 3-1 in the 74th minute. The Galaxy's Robbie Keane closed the deficit in the 84th, but Darlington Nagbe answered with a breakaway goal 18 seconds after the ensuing kickoff. \nKeane gave the Galaxy the early lead in the 36th minute. The Galaxy would have clinched a berth in the conference semifinals with a win. \nMaximiliano Urruti capped the scoring in the 90th minute. It was the Timbers' first road win against the Galaxy. \nAll content copyright ©2015 Pendleton Times-Post, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T04:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T04:57:46.356+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
