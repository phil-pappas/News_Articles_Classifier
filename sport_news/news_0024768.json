By KAREEM COPELANDAP Sports Writer \nSALT LAKE CITY (AP) - Devontae Booker ran for a season-high 222 yards and two touchdowns and No. 5 Utah forced six turnovers in a 30-24 victory over No. 23 California on Saturday night. \nThe Utes (5-0, 2-0 Pac-12) are the lone undefeated team remaining in the Pac-12. \nCal's Jared Goff threw a career-high five interceptions, and had 340 yards and two touchdowns. The Heisman contender couldn't overcome the ball-control issues that put the Golden Bears (5-1, 2-1) in a hole. \nThe Utes entered the game with seven interceptions and Marcus Williams, Justin Thomas, Gionni Paul and Dominique Hatfield all picked off passes in the first half. Hatfield had another interception in the fourth quarter. \nUtah quarterback Travis Wilson couldn't recapture the magic that led to a 42-point victory at Oregon two weeks ago. He finished with 170 yards, one touchdown and two interceptions.
