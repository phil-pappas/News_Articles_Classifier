Texas lost to California, 45-44, when senior kicker Nick Rose missed the game-tying extra point. The Longhorns fell to Oklahoma State, 30-27, when a mishandled snap helped set up the Cowboys' game-winning field goal.\nAt 1-3, Texas is off to its worst start since 1956. An upset win against TCU in Fort Worth would go a long way for Texas' confidence.\nThe Horned Frogs are coming off a big 55-52 win over Texas Tech. Senior wide receiver Josh Doctson had a big day as he caught a school-record 18 passes. He won the Walter Camp National Player of the Week award after his 267 yards and 3 touchdowns performance.\nA win would keep TCU in contention for the Big 12 Championship and a potential College Football Playoff berth.\nWhen Texas has the ball\nTexas will continue to use redshirt freshman quarterback Jerrod Heard's athleticism. His ability to run the ball creates a tough challenge for defenses. But Texas is aware that team's will try to stop Heard from running, it'll try to counter with Heard's arm.\nThe Longhorns will need to protect their quarterback better as he was sacked several times in the second half against Oklahoma State. Senior offensive lineman Kent Perkins is day-to-day after suffering an injury against the Cowboys. The Longhorns will need him to help keep Heard upright.\nTexas will try to utilize its running game but the running backs have yet to breakout this season. In short-yardage situations, junior quarterback Tyrone Swoopes could be used. He racked up 35 yards and a touchdown on three carries against Oklahoma State.\nWhen TCU has the ball\nWhen the Horned Frogs have the ball they'll look to use their own dual-threat in senior quarterback Trevone Boykin. Boykin passed for 485 yards, four touchdowns and added 42 rushing yards on 14 carries against Texas Tech. He's recorded 1,470 passing yards and 14 touchdowns in 2015. He's also run for 190 yards.\nTCU will try to get the ball into Doctson's hands. He's the Horned Frogs' leader in receptions, receiving yards and touchdowns. He's caught 35 passes for 593 yards and six touchdowns in 2015.\nThe Horned Frogs will also use senior running back Aaron Green. He leads TCU's ground game as he has run for 434 yards and six touchdowns this season.\nPrediction\nDespite Texas' three losses, the Longhorns are showing signs of improvement. With a revitalized offense led by Heard and an improving defense, Texas should be able to keep up with the Horned Frogs on Saturday. The Longhorns should be able to take advantage of TCU's struggling defense.\nBut the Horned Frogs will present plenty of challenges for the Longhorns' defense. Boykin and Doctson will look to take advantage of a secondary that has had trouble containing wide receivers this season. Green also presents a threat as Texas' defense has struggled to stop the run at times.\nSaturday's game should see a lot of points scored but Texas will be on the losing end in Fort Worth.\nScore: TCU 48, Texas 35\nOn Twitter:\n @Nick_Castillo74", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/Nick_Castillo74"], "published": "2015-10-01T20:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T03:04:58.732+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
