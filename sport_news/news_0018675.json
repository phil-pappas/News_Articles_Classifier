So perhaps, this won’t be as one-sided as the records might indicate. If last week was about the Bengals winning a “statement game” against Seattle, this week the division-rival Browns can prove they’re no longer wall-flowers at the NFL dance party. \nThe Browns have one of the 10 toughest schedules in the league this season. But with Josh McCown playing more like vintage Peyton Manning, than Manning himself, Cleveland has been better than many expected. \nMcCown threw for a franchise regular season-record 457 yards and two touchdowns while running for another score in last week’s 33-30 win over Baltimore. He has completed 68.1% of his passes over his last three starts, and he’ll need to be every bit as good against one of the league’s toughest defences for the Browns to take another step in shedding their doofus image. \n“We have a ton of respect for them, but we have to trust our ability to go out and execute as well,” McCown said. “You just can’t fold up the tent and go, ‘We’ve got the No. 1 D this week, who do we got next after that?’ \nBesides, “next” doesn’t get much easier anyway. The Browns play the AFC and NFC West teams plus six games against division rivals Pittsburgh, the undefeated Bengals, and Baltimore. \n“The NFC West and the AFC West are arguably the two best divisions in football, so it’s a tough draw,” McCown said. “But at the same time we lace ’em up every week for a reason. You just have to play them one at a time. You know Peyton Manning and that defence playing the way it is we’ll have our hands full. \n“But at the same time we’ll be prepared ... and I think all of our guys, we just believe we can get it done.” \nThe Browns get a bit of luck with Denver’s NFL-leading pass rush playing minus an injured DeMarcus Ware. And, Denver’s offence hasn’t been nearly so scary this year with Manning having more interceptions (seven) than TD passes (six). \n“(The offence is) going to pick it up,” said Chris Harris, who had a key interception in last week’s Denver win. “We have faith in Peyton. We know it’s not just him. We know we need to ... get everybody going. We know that once they start clicking, it’s going to be over.” \nMcCown is 36. Manning is 39. If anything is to start clicking, aside from the usual assorted worn-out body parts, now would be a good time — for the Broncos if they want to be considered serious Super Bowl contenders; for the Browns if they want to shed their image as football’s version of a punch line. \nVIRTUE OF PATIENCE \nOne reason the Steelers will start Michael Vick at quarterback over a still recovering Ben Roethlisberger? \nHistory suggests it’s better to wait until Roethlisberger is completely healthy rather than having him play hurt. According to ESPN, Roethlisberger is 2-4 in his first game back after injuries, averaging 191 passing yards, with eight touchdowns and seven interceptions. \nConclusion: Know pain, no gain. \nMANUEL IN CHARGE \nEJ Manuel received the majority of first-team reps for the Bills again Thursday: Another indication he’ll start ahead of the injured Tyrod Taylor. \nCoach Rex Ryan wouldn’t rule out Taylor, though. “Tyrod’s progressively getting better but I’m not comfortable saying that he will definitely be (starting) yet.” \nEND GAMES \nThe Seahawks have had the finishing touch of a surgeon wielding a meat cleaver, blowing fourth-quarter leads in all three losses. \nThey’ve been outscored by 24 points in the final 15 minutes/overtime. According to ESPN Stats & Information, opposing quarterbacks are 40-for-48 (83.3%) for 449 yards and three touchdowns in the fourth quarter, and Russell Wilson has averaged just 6.1 yards per attempt with one touchdown and one interception. \nThis week coach Pete Carroll held a team meeting to discuss how to close out games. Of course, after last year’s Super Bowl, this topic might not be Carroll’s forte. Just saying. \nPILING ON \nAs if the Seahawks didn’t already have enough to worry about, the club Thursday suspended fullback Derrick Coleman, who was being held in a jail cell. \nColeman was arrested on investigation of vehicular assault and hit and run and the Seahawks said he’s been suspended indefinitely “pending further information.” \nMedia reports indicate Coleman’s pickup truck hit another car around 6 p.m. Wednesday and that Coleman walked away from his car after the accident. Police found Coleman nearby and arrested him. The driver of the other vehicle, according to a police source, suffered a broken collarbone. \nColeman’s agents released a statement saying: “While the facts of the case are still being determined, it seems Derrick may have fallen asleep while driving home from a Seahawks’ facility.” \nQUICK HITS \nPanthers defensive end Jared Allen, suffering from a pinched nerve in his back says he’s “trying to get feeling back in my foot” and probably won’t play this week ... Raiders are expected to place Justin Tuck on season-ending IR with a torn pectoral muscle ... Receiver Rueben Randle (hamstring) practiced Thursday but Giants’ team-mate Odell Beckham’s hamstring kept him sidelined ... An infection and a second surgery on an ankle Maurkice Pouncey injured in preseason will likely sideline him the rest of the season .... DeSean Jackson left practice early after feeling a “twinge” in his injured hamstring.
