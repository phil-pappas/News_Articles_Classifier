Odom blinked, Harrick said. \nThe former Rhode Island coach said doctors were taking \"some things\" -- Harrick implied they were breathing tubes and taking him off kidney dialysis -- out of Odom on Friday afternoon. \n\"... And he's awake now,\" Harrick said. \"So that's probably the most encouraging news we've had since it all started.\" \nOdom is not in a coma and is using a mask to breathe, but has serious damage to his vital organs, the former NBA star's mother-in-law, Kris Jenner, told \"Access Hollywood\" on Friday. \nOdom has been at a Las Vegas hospital since Tuesday, after being found unresponsive at a brothel. \nEarlier a source close to the situation told CNN that Odom, 35, improved a \"tiny bit\" during his third night at Sunrise Hospital & Medical Center. \nOdom \"got a tiny bit better -- emphasis on tiny -- and he was responsive in the middle of the night for a moment,\" the source said. \nOfficials at Sunrise have not commented on the condition of Odom, whose medical decisions are being made by Kardashian, a source has told CNN. CNN has reached out several times to the hospital for comment and no one has returned any of the calls. \nLittle is known about what left Odom unresponsive at a brothel in Crystal, Nevada, where he was found Tuesday, three days after he checked in. \nNor is much know about what is going on inside his hospital room. \nThe husband of a woman who is on the same floor as Odom said security is extremely tight. \nGeorge Cooper said Odom has had many visitors. \"All throughout the night there is banging and clicking as his entourage, managers, basketball players and what not coming and going off the floor,\" he said, adding that his wife's room is right by the doors to the wing. \nOdom spent tens of thousands at brothel \nAs his private struggle turns into a public spectacle, a few details have emerged about Odom's time at the brothel. \nMost of the information is coming from Dennis Hof, the owner of the Love Ranch, where the former basketball player was found. \nIn three days, Odom spent $75,000 there, which guaranteed two women would \"take care of any of his needs,\" Hof told CNN's sister network HLN. \nHe used cocaine on his first day at the brothel Saturday, employees told 911 dispatchers. On a 911 call played at a news conference, a woman said she also saw him take 10 herbal supplement tablets over three days. \nThe brothel's employees also told 911 operators that when they found him Tuesday, Odom was lying in bed on his side with a pinkish fluid coming from his mouth and nose. \nOdom's children speak out \nHis father and two children have joined Kardashian family members at the hospital, but have revealed few specifics on his condition. \nIn a statement Thursday, his children Destiny Odom, Lamar Odom Jr. and their family asked for prayers. \n\"Thanks for your outpouring of prayers and support for our dad. We are here with our family and friends,\" the statement said. \"We appreciate everyone respecting our privacy at this time. We ask for your continued prayers.\" \nIn addition to appearing on \"Keeping Up With the Kardashians,\" Odom and Kardashian had their own reality show, \"Khloe & Lamar.\" It lasted for two seasons and 20 episodes. ‹previous", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T06:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T06:04:25.777+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
