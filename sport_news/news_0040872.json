They won 97 games, so that’s a lot of boogie-oogie-oogie ‘til they just couldn’t boogie no more.\nEven a day late and after a loss, they celebrated clinching a playoff berth.\nThen, after beating the Pirates in the wild-card game Wednesday night, they sprayed champagne everywhere on everyone, celebrating as if they won the World Series, or at least reached it, instead of just the division series.\nI believe the Cubs also celebrate when a red light turns green.\nBut hey, good for them. Winners get to order bottle service.\nThe endless celebration in the clubhouse in Pittsburgh had to make you smile. If you’re a Cubs fan, that is.\nCubs fans had to love the unbridled and unadulterated joy. From rookies such as Kyle Schwarber to veterans such as David Ross, nobody is permitting the pressure of the next game to exceed the pleasure of winning the last one.\nBut you watch, it won’t be long before their expression of joy makes some people around baseball hate the Cubs and take greater joy themselves in beating them.\nWho knows, it might already be the case. Who knows, it might even bother opponents enough to pull the kind of idiotic stunt Pirates pitcher Tony Watson did with Jake Arrieta at the plate in the seventh inning.\nWord gets around. Some teams get prickly because that’s the way some teams are, especially when it’s a team that hasn’t won a World Series in 107 years.\nWhen Dusty Baker was mismanaging the Cubs, he griped about the way some teams celebrated after beating his team. This, mind you, while Baker’s Cubs were bouncing all over the field following their victories. Clueless, that Baker.\nBut it points up the kind of edginess and pettiness that develops.\nIt might not make sense to you, but understand there’s a lot that doesn’t make sense in a sport made up of unwritten rules.\nThe response, though, is pretty simple. If that kind of bad feeling develops, then opponents can stop it by beating the Cubs. Have at it. Take your best shot. Pop your own corks.\nBut I’ll tell you what: I’d rather watch the Cubs' display after victories than the one in which the Cardinals honor drunk drivers every game.\nArrieta joined Madison Bumgarner, Justin Verlander and Sandy Koufax as pitchers who threw shutouts with at least 10 strikeouts in winner-take-all games, according to Jayson Stark of ESPN. And Arrieta didn’t think he had great stuff. Goodness.\nMaddon reached back to his youth to find stud comparisons to Arrieta, seizing on Cardinals Hall-Of Fame pitcher Bob Gibson and the Super Bowl-guaranteeing Joe Namath.\nGiven that we’re talking about the 1960s, who completes Maddon’s hat trick in describing Arrieta? It feels like there should be a third name. So, who?\nI’m going with Muhammad Ali, Wilt Chamberlain or Batman.\nTweet from Toronto Star columnist Bruce Arthur: “Jake Arrieta is an American badass.’’\nArrieta or Schwarber -- who’s your early leader for the Conn Smythe?\nGerrit Cole started on his home field, and couldn’t get started. Dexter Fowler singled, stole second, and scored on Schwarber’s single the opposite way. Cubs 1, Pirates lamenting not starting an offensive lineup 0.\nNext time around, Fowler and Schwarber went single and nuclear explosion. I believe Schwarber’s homer and the Pirates’ postseason hopes headed for a drowning in the Allegheny River simultaneously. Cubs, 3, Pirates done.\nBy the time Fowler homered to make it 4-0 in the fifth, he and Schwarber combined to go 5-for-5 with all four RBIs and runs scored.\nNow it didn’t matter what Hurdle did, not with Arrieta on the mound. He hadn’t allowed four runs in his 20 previous starts and was showing he could finish the job with the last seven hitters in the Cubs batting order tied behind his back.\nIt was laughable. But it was not an exaggeration. This is not snark. This is the truth, and the truth is the Cubs are playing a Cardinals team they can handle.\nThe Cubs might not beat them, but they can handle them. They can handle any remaining NL team because they already have.\nThey just beat the 98-win Pirates on their turf. They’ve beaten the 100-win Cardinals in the regular season. They’ve no-hit the NL West champion Dodgers, and they’ve skunked the NL East Mets. What else you got?\nTweet from Hall-of-Fame pitcher Jim Palmer after Watson drilled Arrieta: “This is the crap you pull when your losing. In a big way. Nonsense. #machoBS @Cubs @JArrieta34’’\nSean Rodriguez claimed a Cubs player choked him after the benches emptied. Nope. Sorry. Rodriguez’s team beat the Cubs to it.\nRodriguez was thrown out for punching Ross and then went nuts on the Gatorade cooler in the dugout. Get a load of this: Several years ago, Rodriguez broke his right hand punching a locker in frustration. If the phone doesn’t ring, Sean, it’s Mensa.\nTweet from Tribune Hockey First-Liner Chris Kuc: “Gatorade cooler currently putting on the foil.’’\nTweet from the newly inspired account called Pirates Water Cooler: “All I’m saying is he’s lucky he walked away.’’\nLate in the game, TBS analyst Ron Darling said Arrieta and the Cubs “can smell the finish line.’’ Darling attended Yale.\nSuddenly, Kris Bryant has gone from too tall to play third base to too good to move to the outfield.\nThe Cubs started three rookies, and all of them made significant contributions, Bryant and Addison Russell in the field and Schwarber of course at the plate.\nRussell’s best moment ought to wise up even the dumbest, fairy-tale believing Cubs fan.\nOne hitter after Russell failed to handle a grounder that loaded the bases in the sixth inning, he snared Starling Marte’s shot and started an inning-ending double play. That was for the idiots who believe in curses and ghosts and hooey obviously borne of lobotomies.\nNever permit the pressure exceed the pleasure of eliminating the evil, dreaded Cardinals.\nBased on the Cubs wild-card roster, I’m guessing Kyle Hendricks, not Jason Hammel, starts Game 2 in St. Louis on Saturday after Lester starts Game 1 on Friday.\nTweet from NBC News reporter Luke Russert: “Unless you have a team in the fight, you have to be a Satanic puppy hater not to pull for the #Cubs to go all the way.’’\n Major League Baseball Baseball Chicago Cubs Jake Arrieta Pittsburgh Pirates St. Louis Cardinals Joe Maddon", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-56166ed1/turbine/ct-cubs-celebrate-and-play-hard-rosenbloom-20151008"], "published": "2015-10-08T16:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T18:29:39.198+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
