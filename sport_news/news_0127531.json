Paasch was a four-year member of the Golden Eagle baseball team from 2011-14, setting the school record for appearances as a pitcher. He will help work with the pitchers, as well as assist by throwing bullpens in practice, while also assisting the overall operations of the UMC baseball program and helping recruit student-athletes. “We are excited to add someone that has such a deep connection to the program to our staff,” said Head Coach Steve Gust. “Ryan is a professional both on and off field. He has the skill set that we need to help build this program and get it to the level of competitiveness that we would like to have it at.” “I am excited to join the staff as an assistant coach,” Paasch said. “It is exciting to see what this team was able to do last year under Coach Gust. I stopped by a couple of games last year and saw a lot of the new faces but it was fun seeing some of the guys I played with and see them be a big part of what the team was able to accomplish. I played here for four years and had a blast and I am excited to be a part of the coaching staff under Coach Gust and help this program continue to improve.” A native of Sauk Rapids, Minn., Paasch served mostly as a relief pitcher under former Head Coach Chris Vito. Paasch appeared in 118.2 innings and had a school record 73 apperances, a mark that should stand the test of time. He also set the school record for games finished. In addition to pitching for the Golden Eagles, Paasch also spent two summers pitching for the Moose Jaw Miller Express in the Western Major Baseball League in Canada. In his final summer during the 2013 season, appeared in 21.0 innings with 12 strikeouts. Paasch earned his Bachelor of Science degree in Marketing from the University of Minnesota Crookston in May of 2015. He resides in Crookston. Paasch will help the Golden Eagles continue make improvements in the NSIC. With an understanding of where the program has been and where Coach Gust hopes to bring the program, Paasch should be an asset as UMC looks to build upon their 14 wins during the 2015 season. The previous two seasons, UMC had won just two games. The Golden Eagles return eight starters in the field including All-NSIC Gold Glove team member Ryan Haggstrom (Sr., 1B, Apple Valley, Minn.), who also led the team with a .346 batting average and 38 runs scored, along with four triples. UMC also returns four starting pitchers including Nolan Wahlberg (Sr., RHP, Blaine, Minn.), who was 6-4 with a 4.52 ERA in 77.2 innings pitched with 44 strikeouts. Wahlberg set the career mark for wins. The Golden Eagles return 25 players from last year’s roster while adding 20 players to have a roster of 45 for the 2016 season. Page 2 of 2 - In addition to Paasch, Alex Sumner will also have an increased role with the team, moving up from his volunteer assistant position that he served in during the 2014 season. Sumner will work with the infielders and help the team with hitting. Sumner earned his Bachelor of Science degree in Sport Management from Dakota Wesleyan University, where he played under Coach Gust. He set several school records while playing for Gust at DWU and helped lead the team to the NAIA National Tournament. Following his time at Dakota Wesleyan, Sumner played three years of independent minor league baseball earning honors as an All-Star Short Stop in the New York State League. He led the league in batting average and stolen bases. Sumner continues to serve as Director of Sports for Special Olympics North Dakota in Grand Forks, N.D. Former Assistant Coach Michael Lukkason will continue to serve in a volunteer assistant role with the Golden Eagles.
