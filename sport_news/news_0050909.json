Sufferers Really Need: Financing for Research To the Sports Editor: Re “A Trip to Fenway as Summer Wanes,” Oct. 4: Dan Barry’s article about his friend Bill Malinowski revealed the insidious nature of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, the way in which it saps the life of those it strikes, one day at a time, until the patient becomes a protoplasmic mass with a mind that may still function, but a body that can’t move, a throat that won’t swallow and lungs that will not breathe. What those of us who suffer with A.L.S. need is the power of a Viagra/Cialis-type drug that will give us back our lives. Not to resurrect our sexual appetites, but to resurrect our humanity. As Gretchen Reynolds noted in September 2014, the greatest obstacle to advancing A.L.S. research for that power pill is the absence of financing. The 2014 Ice Bucket Challenge raised $115 million that contributed significantly in less than a year to the discovery that a protein, TDP-43, when functioning properly, may provide the key to reversing the destructive path of A.L.S. PHIL AVILLO, York, Pa. Risks Are No Fantasy To the Sports Editor: Re “Scandal Erupts in Unregulated World of Fantasy Sports,” Oct. 6: Betting on unregulated gambling with those not subject to strict public scrutiny and regulation is always a mistake and a greater risk than gambling itself. That something like fantasy sports wagering is not unlawful does not make it the equivalent of something legal and closely regulated, such as casinos in the United States. Americans lose $70 billion a year in legal commercial and Indian casinos in 44 states. They wager at least $75 billion on state lotteries and billions more on horse racing, pull tabs and the like. The major sports leagues, especially the N.F.L., are outright hypocrites — fiercely opposing legalization of betting on their actual games while working hand in hand with unregulated businesses to enable so-called fantasy betting on them. It is no fantasy, it is sports betting — and it is meant to be illegal. All of it should be shut down by federal law until Congress decides how to sort it out. CARL ZEITZ, Union City, N.J. The writer was a member of the New Jersey Casino Control Commission from 1980 to 1988. Lessons From Sabathia To the Sports Editor: Re “Leader’s Abrupt Departure Brings Only Respect from Yankees,” Oct. 6: C. C. Sabathia and the Yankees deserve respect and support for Sabathia’s decision to miss the playoffs and seek immediate treatment for alcohol addiction. The American Medical Association declared more than 50 years ago that addiction is a disease, as Sabathia said, yet many do not know it. That’s part of the reason only 10 percent of the 23 million Americans with alcohol and drug problems receive treatment. Sabathia is right to treat his addiction to alcohol as a serious health issue requiring immediate care. Addiction is as at least as serious as the elbow, knee and back injuries that Tyler Kepner lists as the typical causes of player absences. \nAdvertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T23:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T00:07:43.424+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
