So I just followed my heart to try the best.” \nSuch difficulties are not what Li would recommend to China’s emerging players, and she said they needed to be given “room for them to make fun,” something she had to learn to do for herself. \nLi’s on-court victory speeches often had fans in stitches, but there were also confrontations with Chinese media including one episode when she fled the Australian Open press room in tears. “If someone likes you, of course someone (else) will hate you,” Li said. “In the last couple of years (of my career) I think I learned a lot, how to communicate with some media.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T19:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T06:38:51.102+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
