Mark Lewis, the NCAA's executive vice president of championships, informed DraftKings and FanDuel of the decision in a letter sent Tuesday. Lewis wrote that it would be \"inappropriate\" to conduct meetings now with investigations at the federal and state level currently underway. In addition, the letter said, advertising from the sites will be banned during NCAA championships, both on site and on television. Lewis said the Indianapolis-based NCAA also is informing referees and other game officials that they are prohibited from participating in paid fantasy sports games. \nLawmakers in many states are taking a close look at the two websites. Several have already deemed the Web-based contests to be illegal gambling.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T22:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T03:38:08.856+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
