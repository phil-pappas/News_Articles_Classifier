With Rachel Parson and Talia Thompson leading the attack from the left, the Knights also got 10 kills and four blocks on the right from sophomore Alo Thompson, Talia's younger sister.\nFremont (15-10, 8-2), which was plagued by service errors in the first two games, got a spark in the third game from outside hitters London Smith and Madeline Vigil. Vigil finished with 30 kills and Smith added 17 as the Silver Wolves got its first lead at 17-16 in the third. \nEventually, the home team forced a deciding fifth. That's when the Parson sisters stepped to the fore and led a decisive 8-1 run to star the final game. \nWeber State-bound Rachel Parson, who reeled off 20 kills, put away four spikes in that stretch. Senior setter Marisa Parson also contributed a pair of service aces as Northridge got the early advantage.\n\"They came out strong with the intensity that was needed,\" Garver said. \"I think we just had to push through.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T15:16:13.790+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
