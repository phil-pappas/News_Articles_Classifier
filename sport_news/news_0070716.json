(AP) — Buffalo Bills running back Cierre Wood will miss the remainder of the season because of a knee injury. \nAnd the Bills filled Wood’s roster spot on Monday by activating defensive end Ikemefuna Enemkpali, who finished serving a four-game suspension for violating the NFL’s player personal conduct policy. Enemkpali was suspended for a punch that broke the jaw of New York Jets quarterback Geno Smith during a locker room altercation in Aug. \nThe Bills, who claimed Enemkpali on waivers, were granted a one-week roster exemption and had until Monday to activate or cut the player. \nWood was placed on injured reserve after he was hurt in Buffalo’s 14-13 win at Tennessee on Sunday. \nStarting running back LeSean McCoy (hamstring) is out indefinitely. Backup Karlos Williams (concussion) has a chance to return Sunday, when Buffalo (3-2) hosts Cincinnati (5-0). \n___ \nAP NFL website: www.pro32.ap.org and http://twitter.com/AP_NFL Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T21:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T21:25:05.171+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
