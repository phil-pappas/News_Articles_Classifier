Dawabsha died after sustaining serious burns.\nThe parents of the toddler, Riham and Saad, and their other son Ahmad lost their lives after suffering serious injuries as a result of the attack.\n* The story was edited by Ahram Online.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T16:54:47.602+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
