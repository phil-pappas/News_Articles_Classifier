Recalling their first meeting, Brennan laughed while telling Abella, \"I thought you were odd.\" \n\"It was because of the food I brought to school,\" Abella explained. \"It was my first year in America, and it was a whole new culture. I was bringing traditional food from home, like rice with other stuff.\" \nBrennan said her mother was sending her to school with macaroni and chicken nuggets, but that the two still got along great. She said their county title was their friendship's \"icing on the cake.\" \n\"I couldn't have asked for a better partner,\" Brennan said. \"To win it with someone I've been friends with my whole life is unbelievable.\" \nRIGHT CALL: Pompton Lakes middle school teacher Matt Hales spent three years trying to convince Charlotte Yates to play tennis. The Cardinals' coach thought the tall and athletic-looking Yates had the look of a player. \nYates always said no, planning to continue her field hockey career. But the summer before her freshman year, she went away with her family, missed the field hockey team's preseason and was told she couldn't come out for the team. \n\"I called Mr. Hales and said, 'Hi â€¦ Mr. Hales? Is it OK if I play tennis?' \" Yates said in the sheepish tone she used that day. \"And he was like, 'I told you.' \" \nDespite never picking up a tennis racket until high school, Yates, a junior, won the Passaic tournament third singles championship, besting Wayne Hills' Maddy Flynn in straight sets. \nBEARS ON THE PROWL: Hawthorne made a strong showing at the Passaic tournament as two Bears reached the semifinals. Senior first singles player Erika LaMonaca lost in straight sets to eventual champion Jess Goldman of Wayne Hills, while sophomore third singles player Rachel Zuckerberg lost a three-set thriller to Wayne Hills' Flynn. \nHawthorne coach John Codomo feels Zuckerberg is one of Passaic County's most promising players. In losing to Flynn, 3-6, 7-6 (2), 6-4, Zuckerberg had two match points in the second set. \nAs for the team, Hawthorne went .500 last season, but is 6-3 this year. Codomo feels the leadership provided by seniors Nicole D'Ascoli, Martina Rogers, Briana Garcia and LaMonaca has made a huge difference. The lineup also includes Jacquelyn Campos and Jacqueline Hampson. \nMORAL VICTORY: Winning a set against state power Newark Academy is considered a major accomplishment. Dwight-Englewood's second doubles pair of senior Nicole Marino and freshman Olivia Greenberg accomplished the feat in their team's 5-0 loss in Tuesday's Non-Public B final. \nGreenberg and Marino lost their first set to Rakhi Kundra and Jocelyn Tolpin, but rebounded to win a 9-7 tiebreaker. Since the overall outcome already was decided, a 10-point super tiebreaker would determine the match. The Minutemen won it, 10-6. \n\"We were losing in the [second set] tiebreaker, but we just kept fighting back,\" Marino said. \nDwight-Englewood reached its first sectional final since 2010.
