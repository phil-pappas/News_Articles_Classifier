Here's some of the best and worst from the game.\nSAINTS\nBrandon Browner and Delvin Breaux intercepted passes in the end zone in the first half. The Saints' 10-7 halftime deficit could have been far worse without those plays. The diving interception for Breaux was the first of his career, and came soon after he was flagged for pass interference. Credit Keenan Lewis with a solid play on a pass breakup on fourth-and-9 to stop another Eagles drive late in the second quarter. Willie Snead caught another four passes on third-down plays, raising his team-high total to 12. He came into the game with eight catches on third downs, with six good for first downs. Another bullet point for Snead, this time for his 59-yard gain on a long pass down the left sideline in the fourth quarter. Drew Brees connected with Brandin Cooks for 46 yards on the first drive of the second half. Those are the big pass plays many hoped for from Cooks this season. Stephone Anthony 's backfield stop in the fourth quarter was so notable because of how infrequent those plays occurred against the Eagles. SINNERS\nWe never heard Andrus Peat 's name much before Eagles defensive end Fletcher Cox strip-sacked Brees midway through the third quarter. The sack of Brees was the third of the game, and the fumble was Brees' second. Peat made his first NFL start in place of injured left tackle Terron Armstead . Cox beat Peat around the end for a sack in the second quarter, and he barreled his way by guard Senio Kelemete for the first fumble by Brees later in the half. Another pressure given up by Peat to a different Eagles defender resulted in a late interception. Eagles tight ends Brent Celek and Zach Ertz combined for eight catches, 104 yards and a touchdown by Celek. Tight ends against the Saints caught 20 passes for 313 yards and three touchdowns in the first four games, with the Carolina Panthers' Greg Olsen doing plenty of damage two weeks ago. The Saints let DeMarco Murray post his best game yet with the Eagles. His run of 24 yards came one play before Sam Bradford completed a 41-yard touchdown pass to Josh Huff to tie the score 7-7 in the second quarter. Murray averaged 1.6 yards per carry before Sunday, and that included a run of 30 yards last week against the Redskins. He ended Sunday with 120 yards on 27 touches and a rushing touchdown. Jairus Byrd and Kenny Vaccaro collided into each other and fell, leaving Huff with an easy path down the left sideline for a touchdown. Brees' failed third-and-goal pass from the 3 to Snead seemed odd, with two defenders on him. Cooks appeared to be open on a slant. A field goal tied the score at 10. That look Sean Payton gave Rob Ryan in the third quarter. That holding penalty on Browner to negate a sack by Cam Jordan . That 13-yard punt by fill-in punter Brandon Fields , who struggled most of the day. That fumble by Michael Hoomanawanui , who was acquired from New England in the Akiem Hicks trade. Those five sacks of Brees. No sacks on defense. And very little pressure put on Bradford.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T23:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T02:22:01.892+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
