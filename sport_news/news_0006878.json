They're really good upfront. Justin Houston is one of the best pass rushers in this league, so we know what we're going up against. And they've got Tamba Hali on the other side. They do a good job on the back end. Guys have to make contested catches against them, in the man coverage and stuff that they do. Another week, another good test for us.\" \nThis has been the best start of your career, does it feel different from other years? \n\"Yeah, I mean, it's another year. I feel more comfortable. I feel really good where we are right now. We've done some good things, but it's just the beginning. We've got to keep it going, we've got to keep playing well and keep finding ways to win. But I think we've put ourselves in a good spot right now.\" \nHow do you prevent what happened after last year's 3-0 start? \n\"It's a new year; it's a new team. We feel like we've got the right mentality, and so we've got to do whatever it takes to not let anything slip. I think it’s just the way that we're being coached, the way that Marvin's doing things, and offensively Hue's doing things. I know Paulie (defensive coordinator Paul Guenther) is going to be doing things with the defense. I think that our mindset is, we're not satisfied with where we are. It's only three games into the season, we're on our fourth game. That's the attitude you have to have.\" \nAre there different circumstances from last year's 3-0 start? \n“Different things go on in every year. I think there's some different things that happened last year. But I feel good about where we are right now.\" \nNo bye week after the 3-0 start like last year. Does that help you stay in a rhythm? \n\"It's always nice. I think when everybody looks at the schedule and you have a Week 4 bye, it's not ideal. We are in a rhythm right now, we are in a good routine, and it's nice that we just get to keep going with it.\" \nDoes it feel good to be 3-0 and know you haven't played your best yet? \n\"Yeah, I mean it's great. And I think that however you can get to 3-0 is always a great thing, and we're there. So now this week our goal's to be 4-0.\" \nYou had a smile on your face before the winning play at Baltimore. What were you thinking before that play? \n\"I mean, we had a good look for what I saw, and I guess I didn't realize I was smiling. But it's one of those things. When you get those opportunities, you've got to make that play. And we were able to make it. I was smiling for a while after that.\" \nHue Jackson talked about your composure on the sideline after the fumble return for a touchdown ... \n\"At that point in the game, we were down, but one score would put us back on top. I think there was over six minutes left in the game at that point. So we didn't have to press, we didn't have to get it all in one play even though we did. It's just one of those things like, ‘Let's just stick with what we're doing.’ We obviously hit the big play that scored fast for us. Even going in after that drive when they scored again and we had to go down and score, I felt there was no panic. There was no indecision on the sideline. Everybody was confident and felt like we were going to go down and score.\" \nYou had to do that twice, can there be a carry-over effect from it? \n\"I hope so. It's the mentality that you have to have: Whatever it takes, however you can do it, go down and score when you need to. It was good to do it last week, and it's not going to be the last time that we're going to have to do that this year.\" \nWhen you have edge rushers like the Chiefs do, how does that affect your approach? \n\"Yeah, you know that you've got to get the ball out of your hands, you can't hold onto it longer than you usually do because the longer that they're rushing, the more chance of them being able to get to you. So you've got to be smart with what you're doing and understand where they're coming from.\" \nWhat makes Justin Houston a little different than other edge rushers? \n\"He's got an ability to hit you with a speed rush, he's got a bull rush, he's got a lot of different things that he's able to do, and he's a big strong guy. So he's got a lot of different stuff that he's able to do which allows him to get those sacks.\" \nIs Sean Smith back this week? \n\"Yes, I think so.\" \nSo you've got (Sean) Smith, (Marcus) Peters, the rookie, and playmakers on the back end? \n\"Yeah, I think they've got some young guys playing, and one of the corners has two picks already this year. They've definitely done some good things, so it's going to be a good test this week for our guys outside, and I think we'll be ready for it.\" \nYou have to be aware of safety Eric Berry ... \n\"He's got a good understanding of what they're doing. He kind of plays all over. He's been in the box, he's been deep, he does a lot of different things. Just his ability to move around, his versatility is big for him.: \nA.J. Green was the AFC Offensive Player of the Week. Can anyone stop you when you're playing like this? \n\"We feel good about where we are. There's still some things we can do better. We feel like the only thing that can stop us is ourselves. So we've just got to keep pushing and be the best we can be. I'm really happy for him. He deserves to be the player of the week this week. Huge game for him, and I'm really happy for him.\" \nIs anything different for you mechanically in throwing the ball this year? \n\"No, I think it's just I'm sticking to my plan of what I've been doing. I feel my arm's gotten stronger, I've been more accurate with it, and I've just got to keep that going.\" \nFollow us on Twitter @Local12 and LIKE us on Facebook for updates! \nTo get \"The Skinny\" on local sports be sure to follow Local12 Digital Sports Columnist/Editor Richard Skinner on Twitter @Local12Skinny and LIKE him on Facebook for updates or email him raskinner@sbgtv.com.
