So it's all got to do with how we prepare for the game.\"\nJones has handed a World Cup debut to 35-year-old center Craig Wing in one of four changes to his side from the victory over Samoa, with Justin Ives also coming into the starting line-up in the second row in place of Hitoshi Ono.\nUnited States coach Mike Tolkin has brought back his first choice side after his second string were humbled 64-0 by South Africa on Wednesday with fullback Chris Wyles restored to the captaincy.\nTeams:\nJapan: 1-Keita Inagaki, 2-Shota Horie, 3-Hiroshi Yamashita\n4-Luke Thompson, 5-Justin Ives, 6-Michael Leitch (captain), 7-Michael Broadhurst, 8-Ryu Koliniasi Holani, 9-Fumiaki Tanaka, 10-Kosei Ono, 11-Kotaro Matsushima, 12-Craig Wing, 13-Harumichi Tatekawa, 14-Yoshikazu Fujita, 15-Ayumu Goromaru\nReplacements: 16-Takeshi Kizu, 17-Masataka Mikami, 18-Kensuke Hatakeyama, 19-Shinya Makabe, 20-Amanaki Lelei Mafi, 21-Hendrik Tui, 22-Atsushi Hiwasa, 23-Karne Hesketh\nUnited States: 1-Eric Fry, 2-Zach Fenoglio, 3-Titi Lamositele, 4-Hayden Smith, 5-Greg Peterson, 6-Al McFarland, 7-Andrew Durutalo, 8-Samu Manoa, 9-Mike Petri, 10-AJ MacGinty, 11-Zach Test, 12-Thretton Palamo, 13-Seamus Kelly, 14-Takudzwa Ngwenya, 15-Chris Wyles (captain)\nReplacements: 16-Phil Thiel, 17-Oli Kilifi, 18-Chris Baumann, 19-Cam Dolan, 20-John Quill, 21-Danny Barrett, 22-Niku Kruger, 23-Folau Niua\nReferee: Glen Jackson (New Zealand)\n(Editing by Justin Palmer )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T23:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T22:41:35.457+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
