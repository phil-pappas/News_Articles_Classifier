This allows us to start the trip with a win, which is exactly what we wanted.\"Nolan Patrick opened the scoring six minutes into the first period on a bad angle wristshot that eluded Chiefs starter Tyson Verhelst of Brandon.Kailer Yamamoto tied the game five minutes later on a rebound, and the Chiefs (3-5-1-1) took the lead with a power-play goal by Jaret Anderson-Dolan 12 minutes into the second period.After Riley Whittingham made it 3-1 for the Chiefs with just over a minute left in the second, John Quenneville scored his sixth of the season 46 seconds later to pull the Wheat Kings back within a goal.The ice resurfacing machine broke down, causing a 45-minute break between the second and third periods.After a slow start to the third, the Wheat Kings began to control the play and defenceman Ivan Provorov tied the game with a slapshot from the point that got through a screen by Jayce Hawryluk and past Verhelst at 11:34.McCrimmon said both teams took control of the game at varying points.\"We were good early but I thought that Spokane was better than us in the second period and took the lead, 3-1,\" McCrimmon said. \"We did score late in the second to make it 3-2 and then in the third I thought that we had the momentum for most of the period.\"Papirny made 21 saves for the Wheat Kings while Verhelst made 34 stops for the Chiefs.The Wheat Kings next see action when they visit the Tri-City Americans on Friday.ICINGS: The Wheat Kings scratched forwards Tim McGauley and Ty Lewis (upper-body injuries, out week-to-week), and healthy scratches F Garrett Armour and D Mark Matsuba … The Prince Albert Raiders acquired 17-year-old Drew Warkentine, a hometown boy, from the Kootenay Ice for 18-year-old Dylan Stewart and a conditional fifth-round WHL bantam draft pick on Wednesday in an exchange of forwards.
