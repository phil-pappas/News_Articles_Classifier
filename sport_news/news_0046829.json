Candidates include former major league managers Manny Acta, Larry Bowa and Bo Porter. \nJennings made the unusual move from GM to manager when the Marlins fired Mike Redmond after a 16-22 start. The change failed to spark a turnaround, and the injury-riddled Marlins finished 71-91, their sixth consecutive losing season. \nJennings has been with the Marlins since 2002 and is under contract through 2018.
