Angelidis will be the Crunch's captain for the fourth straight season while Marchessault returns as the team's leading scorer from 2014-15 (67 points).\nAlso, the Lightning assigned goalie Kristers Gudlevskis and defenseman Luke Witkowski to Syracuse. Syracuse coach Rob Zettler said Gudlevskis will likely get the start Saturday night when the Crunch opens its season at Lehigh Valley.\nThe return of Witkowski, a third-year pro, is something of a surprise. For now, second-year blueliner Slater Koekkoek has beat him out for a spot with the Lightning.\nTampa Bay is now down to the maximum 23 players, with goalie Andrei Vasilevskiy on injured reserve.\nEarlier on Tuesday, Tampa Bay assigned goalie Allen York and defenseman Charlie Dodero to Greenville of the ECHL.\nAlso, the Lightning released forward Ryan Martindale from his tryout contract.\nContact Lindsay Kramer anytime: Email | Twitter | 315-470-2151", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/LindsayKramerPS"], "published": "2015-10-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T22:36:24.253+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
