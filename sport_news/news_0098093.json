The game featured 1,357 yards of total offense in the game with TCU responsible for 750 of those yards with over 500 yards passing. \nThe high-octane offense isn't new for TCU. The Horned Frogs are ranked fifth in the country in scoring offense, averaging 51 points per game. TCU is also second in the nation in total offense per game, piling up 636.5 yards per game this season. Not surprisingly, TCU does plenty of damage through the air, averaging more than 401 passing yards per game. But don't sleep on the Horned Frogs' running attack which averages 235 yards on the ground per game. \nTexas will counter the Horned Frogs' offensive attack with a defense they hope can improve on a stifling performance against the Oklahoma State Cowboys. On average, Texas allows 35.3 points per game, 105th in the nation. But last week, Texas held Oklahoma State to fewer than 400 yards of offense while also intercepting the ball twice and forcing a fumble. Texas scored two defensive touchdowns in the game, which helped them stay even with the Cowboys until the final minute of the game when a kicking gaffe gave OSU the victory. \nStill, TCU's passing proficiency will be attacking Texas' major weakness. The Longhorns rank 107th in the nation in passing defense, giving up 276.8 yards per game this season. The run defense isn't much better with Texas ranked 105th in the nation, allowing 206.3 yards per contest, according to cfbstats.com. \nWhen Texas takes over on offense, TCU will mount some resistance, but still allows 405..8 yards per game, 82nd in the nation. The Horned Frogs are susceptible to the run, giving up 169.8 yards per game along with 10 rushing touchdowns on the season. \nTexas' offensive output isn't great on the season, averaging just 345 yards per game this year, 111th in the nation out of 128 schools. The Longhorns will run the football, averaging 37.8 runs for 166.5 yards per game, with some of the offense led by quarterback Jerrod Heard. But unlike TCU, Texas can't count on the passing game to get them out of a jam. The Longhorns' passing attack ranks 107th in the nation, averaging 20.3 passes for 178.5 yards per contest and having just two passing touchdowns on the year. \nLas Vegas oddsmakers have installed TCU as a more than two touchdown favorite over the Longhorns. Offensively, TCU has all of the numbers in their favor. Still, the same could be said for Cal and Oklahoma State and Texas had a chance to win both games all the way until the clock hit zero. \nIf the Longhorns spring an upset on TCU, it would go a long way towards taking the heat off head coach Charlie Strong. The team, which is very young, is showing rapid improvement each week. But, a loss to TCU and possibly Oklahoma next week could have the Longhorns staring at a 1-5 record heading into a late October matchup with Kansas State at DKR Stadium.
