CONNECT 3 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nTROY — A singular sound echoed through Veterans Memorial Stadium, signaling another loss for the Troy and symbolizing the deep despair the Trojans are in. \nTheir 19-16 loss to Idaho may have hit a crescendo when a 32-yard field goal gonged off an upright in the final minute, but the rumblings were persistent Saturday. \n“I want to apologize to our fans,” first-year Troy head coach Neal Brown said. “We didn’t show up and play very well at homecoming.” \nJed Solomon’s 32-yard kick with 32 seconds remaining — and the ringing sound it made off the right upright — was just the final note. \n“Everybody is disappointed — that was a tough loss — but the game wasn’t decided by that last kick,” linebacker William Lloyd said. “Offensively, defensively, we both made mistakes that played a part. \n“The last kick wasn’t to win or lose the game. We just all have to do better.” Troy coach Neal Brown makes his opening statement and apologizes to fans after the Trojans' 19-16 homecoming loss to Idaho on Saturday. Stacy Long \nThe Trojans (1-5, 0-2 Sun Belt Conference) mustered just 108 yards — and no points — in the first half. \nThey suffered three second-half turnovers. The first came on Idaho’s 2-yard line. The last two led to 10 points for the Vandals (2-4, 1-2). \nThey did enough to dig themselves a two-touchdown fourth-quarter deficit. \n“We lost that game long before that field goal,” Brown said. “We didn’t do it, and that’s where we are. \n“I’m not happy at all, but we can’t change the result.” \nWith Solomon going out for a short field goal, the Trojans said they were already thinking ahead to the final 30 seconds and likely overtime. \nSolomon, a senior, had already nailed three kicks, including a career-long 41-yarder. \n“Spot on,” receiver Teddy Ruben said, describing what he expected of Solomon. Said Lloyd: “Lights out.” \n“We had all the confidence in him,” Ruben said. “He did a great job (Saturday).” The Troy Trojans say they had confidence in kicker Jed Solomon and remain confident in the senior, despite Saturday's final-minute miss that ended their 19-16 loss to Idaho. Stacy Long \nTroy had taken a shot at the end zone and a go-ahead touchdown. \nThird-string quarterback Dallas Tidwell — in due to an injury to starter Brandon Silvers and ineffectiveness by backup Dontreal Pruitt — almost hit freshman Deondre Douglas just before the Trojans called on Solomon. \n“We win the game if I make that throw,” Tidwell said. \nWith Troy on the right hashmark, Solomon’s kick squarely met the right upright. \n“He’s been solid all year,” Brown said. “He had a really good spring, a really good (preseason) camp. It probably would have been better if we were toward the middle, but we had all the confidence that he would make it. \n“We were already thinking ahead to what we would do on the kickoff and in overtime.” \nInstead, the Vandals celebrated their first road win in three years. \nAfter Troy erased a 16-3 fourth-quarter deficit with two Solomon field goals and a long touchdown pass from Tidwell to Teddy Ruben, Idaho drove for the go-ahead points. \nAustin Rehkow kicked his fourth field goal, a 19-yarder, with 3:01 remaining to put the Vandals ahead. \nThe drive lasted 14 plays, 73 yards and 5:06. \n“We’re not where we want to be, and we just have to get better,” Brown said. “There’s no easy way to say it.” Read or Share this story: http://on.mgmadv.com/1LBjHXH TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T06:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T05:15:03.953+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
