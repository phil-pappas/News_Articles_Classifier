Baylor (5-0) 129 (8) 2 2. TCU (6-0) 122 (3) 1 3. Texas A&M (5-0) 112 3 4. Texas Tech (4-2) 96 4 5. Houston (5-0) 87 5 6. Texas (2-4) 81 6 7. Rice (3-3) 65 7 8. SMU (1-5) 49 8 9. UTSA (1-5) 45 10 10. UTEP (2-4) 34 9 11. Texas State (1-4) 27 11 12. North Texas (0-5) 11 12 (How the poll works: A first-place vote is worth 12 points, second-place is worth 11 and so on. First-place votes are placed in parentheses next to a school's point total.)\n(Poll voters: Chuck Carlton, Nick Castillo, Shehan Jeyarajah, Kate Hairopoulos, E.J. Holland, Tommy Magelssen, Bill Nichols, Jose Rodriguez, Kevin Sherrington, Brett Vito, Brandon Wheeland.)\nCLICK HERE TO SEE THE INDIVIDUAL BALLOTS\nBiggest margin: There are four 16-point gaps between consecutive places in this week's poll. So with that in mind, here's a look at the biggest margin between teams separated by two spots: There's a 32-point gap between No. 6 Texas and No. 8 SMU, essentially making spot No. 7 the dividing line for teams our voters consider \"good.\" Rice, fittingly at 3-3, is right at that border.\nSmallest margin: SMU and UTSA. The Mustangs and Roadrunners are only separated by four spots as they try to avoid the bottom third of the table. SMU's only win of the season (North Texas) keeps looking worse and worse, while UTSA is staying competitive despite only one win of its own.\nTeam everybody agrees on: UNT is in full-on disaster mode, but the Mean Green brass are at least taking steps to improve on this woeful season. North Texas is the unanimous pick for last in the state. Fifth-year coach Dan McCarney was fired Saturday night after the Mean Green were destroyed by FCS program Portland State, 66-7. It will take more than a firing to turn this program around (just take a look at SMU).\nTeam nobody agrees on: SMU. As mentioned above, SMU's one win of the season isn't very good -- 31-13 over now 0-5 North Texas. But at the same time, three of the Mustangs' five losses have come to still-undefeated teams: Baylor, TCU and Houston. The Ponies range from seventh to 10th in the poll. There likely won't be too much change next week -- SMU has a bye.\nBiggest riser: UTSA. The Roadrunners lost their fifth game of the season but still managed to jump up an impressive 14 points in the poll. UTSA, which lost to Louisiana Tech, 34-31, on a last-minute field goal, now owns three losses by 10 points or less, including two by three points or less. Clearly, the voters are impressed with UTSA's fortitude.\nBiggest faller: UTEP. While UTSA is on the rise, UTEP is down. The 2-4 Miners were waxed by Florida Atlantic on Saturday, 25-12. While they have twice as many wins as in-state rival UTSA, the Roadrunners' only win is over the Miners -- making this a rather easy choice.\nPrevious polls Oct. 5: Baylor, TCU in fight for top spot; Houston gains ground on Texas Tech\nSept. 28: Bears breathing down Frogs' neck for top spot\nSept. 21: SMU gets fewer votes after close game against TCU\nSept. 14: Despite win, Texas continues slide in poll\nSept. 7: TCU maintains top spot; Longhorns drop in rankings after blowout loss\nPreseason: TCU gets nod as state's best over Baylor to start 2015\nOn Twitter:\n @SportsDayDFW", "external_links": ["http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/09/27/best-texas-breakdown-928-bears-breathing-frogs-neck-top-spot", "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/182tS2k9ta0RGkx59NRiL-3LGpePGnE4YjJMMb0WzAQU/edit?usp=sharing", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/10/04/best-texas-105-baylor-tcu-fight-top-spot-houston-gains-ground-texas-tech", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/10/12/best-texas-1012-move-tcu-new-1-state", "https://twitter.com/SportsDayDFW", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/09/20/best-texas-921-smu-gets-fewer-votes-close-game-tcu-texas-tech-closer-3-spot", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/09/13/best-texas-914-despite-win-texas-continues-slide-poll"], "published": "2015-10-12T08:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T07:21:43.240+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
