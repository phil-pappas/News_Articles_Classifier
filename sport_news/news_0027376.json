But fame is a funny thing. The ferocious loyalty of their supporters is one of the distinctive qualities they share.\nBoth men have made an art form of turning controversy into gold. Each has stirred up a grievance-based movement with an ambitious agenda for political and social change that, more than anything else, promotes the brands of the two leaders.\nThey do this partly by defying \"political correctness,\" as some people like to call what most of us like to call good manners. The most bland of reputations can be quickly spiced up by the knowledge that any moment now you just might test public sensibilities by saying something outrageous.\nJust when I thought Farrakhan, for example, had given up his reputation for baiting Jews and Israel with thinly veiled anti-Semitic statements, he went full anti-Semitic birther earlier this year.\nIn a speech earlier this year live-streamed on the Internet, Farrakhan blamed the Sept. 11 attacks not on Arabs or Muslims but on Jews and Israelis. \"It is now becoming apparent that there were many Israelis and Zionist Jews in key roles in the 9/11 attacks,\" he said, as the audience voiced its approval. If it wasn't a hate rally, it was a stunningly close imitation.\nWelcome to Rev. Trump's Church of Emotional Economics Clarence Page Donald Trump would not tell reporters whose advice he received in creating his tax plan, but I hear a familiar voice in its 3 1/2 pages.

It sounds like Jeb Bush.\nBush released his own tax reform plan a couple of weeks earlier in September than his fellow Republican presidential candidate Trump...\n(Clarence Page) The video led Anti-Defamation League director Abraham Foxman to name the Nation of Islam minister America's \"leading anti-Semite\" and \"pied piper of bigotry.\"\nIndeed, by comparison Trump sounds tame with his infamous claim that Mexico is \"sending\" immigrants who are \"bringing drugs …, bringing crime,\" are \"rapists and some, I assume, are good people.\"\nWhen I interviewed Farrakhan back in the 1980s, he assured me that he believes some Jews are good people, too. But that doesn't forgive either his or Trump's spreading of paranoid conspiratorial delusions.\nThe New York Times also reported in 1995 that his condemnations of gay lifestyles had caused some consternation among black gays, lesbians, bisexuals and transsexuals over whether to attend the first Million Man March on the Washington Mall.\nBut rest assured, Farrakhan scrupulously avoided taking the cheap-shot route in his Million Man March speeches, whether at other Jews or the gay and lesbian communities. Instead he gave rambling two-hour sermons that he delivered in the way Trump enjoys: off-the-cuff ad libs that occasionally return to a central theme.\nRupert Murdoch's 'real black' for the White House Clarence Page No one should be surprised that Rupert Murdoch likes Ben Carson.

The crowds at events for both men are excited to be there. Their presence is in itself a statement that their followers want to send the world about their frustration with the status quo.\nIn politics, after all, this is the year of the populist. Insurgent, outside-the-mainstream presidential candidates in both parties are experiencing surprising success in polls. Voters are tired of Washington's \"business as usual,\" however they define that business to be.\nAs the nation's first nonwhite president nears the end of his time in office, African-Americans are expressing their frustration over the limits of his power, even as his conservative opposition claims that he has had too much power.\nSmall wonder then that thousands of black folks returned to the mall, perhaps to find new answers or merely to get their spiritual batteries charged.\nThe recent rally essentially was a big nostalgic celebration of the first. Its oddly ominous theme \"Justice — or Else,\" echoed the frustrations of the Black Lives Matter movement, but left open the question, \"Or else what?\"\nFarrakhan's representatives suggested maybe a national black boycott of the Christmas holiday season. Good luck with that, folks.\nLeft unanswered is the larger question raised by the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. 50 years ago amid the hard-won victories of the civil rights revolution: \"Where do we go from here?\"\nHe answered himself, saying we should continue to fight poverty, inequality and injustice with a \"divine dissatisfaction.\" We've got lots of dissatisfaction now. The divine part may take a little longer.\nClarence Page, a member of the Chicago Tribune Editorial Board, blogs at www.chicagotribune.com/pagespage .\ncpage@tribpub.com\nTwitter @ cptime\n Donald Trump Clarence Page Commentary Martin Luther King Jr. Opinion", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-561d3930/turbine/ct-farrakhan-trump-slam-black-lives-matter-perspec-1014-jm-20151013", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-560eca07/turbine/ct-donald-trump-jeb-bush-tax-perspec-1004-jm-20151002", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-56180b3c/turbine/ct-rupert-murdoch-ben-carson-obama-black-president-perspec-1011-jm-20151009"], "published": "2015-10-13T20:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T21:10:50.807+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
