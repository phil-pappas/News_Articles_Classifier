We didn’t do that. We had one offsides penalty and that was it. \n“We cleaned everything up and we’re happy with where we are at. We’re getting healthier and we might get another player back this week so we’re happy.” \nThe Northern Lehigh offense was basically unstoppable and that was evident because the Bulldogs didn’t have to punt once. \n“Chad (Cederberg) ran the option well. Kellen (Hendrix), I mean we took what they gave us. He ran possessed tonight. And when Taz (McNair) was in at quarterback too, he ran the ball tough and ran the ball hard. Our goal is to spread it around so defenses can’t concentrate on one guy and I think we’re doing that.” \nThe Bulldogs don’t put the ball up in the air much, but Cederberg found a wide open C.J. Young for a 48-yard completion and touchdown on their first possession with less than two minutes gone in the contest. \nCatasauqua came right back through the air as Christian Burker completed three passes before taking it seven yards in for the tying score with 6:13 left in the first quarter. \nThen the Bulldogs went to work as Young scored his second TD on a three-yard run. \nMcNair took over the controls for a while and wound up scoring the first second quarter TD on a three-yard run before Young broke loose for a 25-yard jaunt into the end zone again with 1:20 left in the half. \nThe Bulldogs weren’t done yet though as Ryan Greene caught a pass from Burker, but coughed it up and Cederburg picked it up and ran 36 yards untouched for another Bulldog score and a 35-7 lead at the half. \nHendrix scored on a two-uard run with 1:42 left in the third quarter to send the game into the “Mercy Rule”, while McNair scored on a 22-yard run and Justin Paul ended the scoring on the night with a 9-yard run. \nCatty managed to squeeze one in on a 56-yard completion from Andrew Brett to Corey Raysely between the last two Nolehi scores. \nHOME SWEET HOME ... The Bulldogs have not only won all three games at home this season, the last two have come under the “Mercy Rule”. Before beating the Roughies last night, the Bulldogs handed Wilson a “Mercy Rule” loss by a 39-7 score after opening the schedule with a 20-7 triumph over Pen Argyl. \nQUADRUPLE QUARTERBACKS ... Having the luxury of the big lead, Northern Lehigh was able to use four quarterbacks in the game. Chad Cederberg (who hooked up with C.J. Young for a TD reception), Taz McNair (who rushed for 118 yards on seven carries and a TD), Zach Long who picked up four yards on a carry and newcomer Tekoah Guedes, who rushed once for 21 yards. \nSACK ATTACK ... The Bulldogs had a fun time blitzing Catty quarterback Christian Burker, with Brandon Smith and Tanner Filchner getting to Burker the most. Burker was sacked eight times. \nHOMECOMING ... Northern Lehigh held its homecoming with Kasey Wayda being crowned queen and Gavin Kemmerer king.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T16:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T18:10:49.036+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
