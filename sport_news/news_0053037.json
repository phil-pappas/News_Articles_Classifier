King had eight catches for 128 yards. \nThe Battlers (4-1) jumped to a 3-0 lead on Jordan Butler's 40-yard field goal, but Buechel hit Capers with a 65-yard TD pass on the Dukes' opening drive and Duquesne (4-2) never looked back. \nAfter Austin Crimmins' 39-yard field goal put the Dukes up 46-12 in the fourth quarter, Marcus Anderson returned the ensuing kickoff 100 yards for a Battlers' score, then Nehari Crawford returned the ensuing 100 yards for Duquense's final score. \nAll content copyright ©2015 Pendleton Times-Post, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T23:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T23:48:00.713+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
