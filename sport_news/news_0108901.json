Photograph by: Darryl Dyck, The Canadian Press Files , Ottawa Citizen \nVANCOUVER — Which teams look to win this week’s matchups, and where do they rank in the league’s pecking order, in Week 18 of the Canadian Football League season: \nFRIDAY \nMontreal at Toronto, 4 p.m. PT, TSN \nIt's hard to find an example of a more chaotic, disjointed situation in professional sports than the one the Argos have had to deal with this season, with home games in Fort McMurray, Ottawa and now a second at Tim Hortons Field in Hamilton, the playpen of Toronto's fiercest rival. Improbable as it may be, the Argos still have an outside chance to finish first in the East, and Friday's game should get them back on track after a listless performance against Calgary. The Als' offence is making a desperate attempt to get it together under QB Kevin Glenn, but it's probably too late. \nPick: Argonauts. \nHamilton at B.C., 7 p.m. PT, TSN \nAt the time slotback Courtney Taylor suffered a season-ending foot injury last year, the B.C. Lions were 7-4. Since that Sept. 13, 2014, game, the team has lost 16 of 23 starts. Taylor, now healthy, can't get in the lineup - another peculiarity of the idiosyncratic Lions. As with most losing teams, B.C. does just enough to get close before making that one fatal mistake (a goal-line fumble by backup QB Greg McGhee last game) that keeps them from gaining traction. Still, they're inching closer to a complete effort. \nPick: Lions. \nSATURDAY \nOttawa at Winnipeg, 1 p.m. PT, TSN \nHenry Burris is not only having a season for the aged (he's 40), but his ability to stay upright and avoid the butcher's bill of quarterback injuries makes him a true marvel. One wonders where the Blue Bombers would be if Drew Willy had escaped catastrophe with similar aplomb. His replacement, Matt Nichols, threw three picks last Friday in Ottawa, a game that wasn't close, except on the scoreboard. Still, the Blue Bombers blew 12 of a possible 17 kicking points against the Eskimos on Oct. 3, their last home game, and lost by one. \nPick: Blue Bombers. \nEdmonton at Saskatchewan, 4 p.m. PT, TSN \nWhere would the Eskimos be without Sean Whyte? Probably not in a position to win their first division title since 2003. Cut loose by the Alouettes, the diminutive kicker contemplated retirement before being recruited by the Eskimos to replace the injured Grant Shaw. His onetime mentor and rival with the Lions, Paul McCallum, has been mothballed and replaced by Tyler Crapigna, 23, as the Roughriders look ahead to 2016. \nPick: Eskimos.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T23:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T07:10:25.443+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
