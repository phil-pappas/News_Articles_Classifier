That continued into this season as Eagles quarterback Sam Bradford rarely threw deep to Cooper, or anyone else, through the first three games. \nStill, Eagles offensive coordinator Pat Shurmur stood by his wideouts. \n“We’ve got receivers that can get deep and if you look at it in total over the course of the year, we’ll be able to throw it deep,” Shurmur said last month. \nSure enough, over the last three games, Cooper has hauled in two passes of 40 or more yards. In the last game alone, a 27-7 win over the Giants, Cooper caught a 32-yard touchdown pass and had a 43-yard reception. \nJust like that, he is tied for seventh in the NFL in receptions of 40-plus yards with two, despite having only 11 catches this season. It’s reminiscent of his 2013 season, when Cooper tied for sixth with six receptions of 40-plus yards out of his 47 catches. \nLast season, that deep ball production declined sharply. Cooper set a career high with 55 receptions, but just one of those went for 40 or more yards. His average yards per reception went from 17.8 in 2013 to 10.5 last season. It’s up to 18.6 yards per reception this season. \n“A lot of it is just the coverage dictated,” Eagles coach Chip Kelly said. “We are seeing a little bit more man [coverage] now. Last year we saw a lot more zone. Last year was like 60-40 [percent] zone and right now I think it’s 51-49 [percent] man. So I think it’s just how people are defending us now compared to in the past. \n“It’s skewed back a little bit towards maybe where it was closer to our first year [in 2013]. If you’re going to play man coverage, then we are going to try to get some matchups that are favorable to us.” \nThe Eagles and Cooper hope to exploit those matchups this Sunday night against the Carolina Panthers. That's if Cooper plays. He has been dealing with a knee injury all week and hasn’t practiced. \nAfter the win over the Giants on Monday night, Cooper said his ability to catch the deep balls is “nothing special.” \n“It’s just running around, going to get the football, [Bradford] putting it where only I can catch it,” he said. “The easy part is running and catching. The hard part is the pinpoint accuracy where only the wide receiver can catch it.” \nBut Cooper has always been able to take advantage of man coverage because of his size and baseball background. Cooper is 6-foot-4 and 230 pounds. He was also drafted by the Phillies as an outfielder in 2006 before deciding to play football at the University of Florida. \nCooper’s 32-yard touchdown against the Giants was a good example of that. He got open on a post pattern and was well behind the defensive backs. But Bradford underthrew the ball, so Cooper had to adjust his route. He came back for the ball, dove and caught it in the end zone. \n“Coop’s obviously a big target down the field,” Bradford said. “But he also runs really well. You see him track the ball really well down the field the past couple of weeks. He’s got a great feel for some of those backside post routes we’ve hit him on. I feel comfortable throwing it up to him.” \nThat, however, has been a learning process for Bradford. \n“I think it’s always evolving,” Bradford said. “I’m not sure that there’s a set process that says, ‘By this day, you feel comfortable with him.’ I think it’s something that, as you put the game plan in each week, you get feels for how guys run those routes. After a couple weeks, you get a feel for who likes certain routes and who doesn’t.” \nIt’s becoming clear which routes Cooper likes. \nWing tips \nThe Eagles ruled out WR Nelson Agholor (ankle) and LB Kiko Alonso (knee) for the game Sunday. Cooper, LB DeMeco Ryans (hamstring), LB Mychal Kendricks (hamstring) and DE Brandon Bair (groin) were listed as questionable. WR Josh Huff (knee) was listed as probable. \nContact Martin Frank at mfrank@delawareonline.com .
