His favorite target all season, senior wideout Elijah Robinson, was the biggest beneficiary, catching 3 balls for 133 yards, all for touchdowns. \nSeton Hall QB Zach Keller completed 18 of his 34 attempts for 267 yards, including nine completions to junior Dwayne Warren. \nFor Montclair, Saturday was the first of several \"must-win\" contests. A loss would likely have ended their NJSIAA playoff hopes; now, with a win over the team pegged to win the SEC-American Division, the Mounties (1-4, 1-0)can feel confident that they are capable of beating everyone else on their schedule. \nNext up for MHS is an away trip to West Orange this Friday night. Kickoff is set for 7 p.m. \n\"The kids played great with their backs against the wall,\" head coach John Fiore said. \nMontclair held a nine-point advantage for most of the fourth quarter Saturday before Dylan Badger’s 1-yard touchdown run pulled the Pirates (3-2, 1-1) within 28-26 with 2:43 remaining. \nThe Mounties were able to recover the ensuing onside kick, but were forced to punt, giving Seton Hall the ball back with 11 seconds remaining. \nAfter a 12-yard completion from Keller to Warren and a spike to kill the clock, Seton Hall took its final snap from the Montclair 48 with four seconds remaining. \nKeller was pressured and flushed out of the pocket by Jason Campbell, and nearly sacked by Jeremiah Chinn-Drayton before breaking into the open field. He uncorked a deep ball at the Prep 45-yard line towards the 6-foot-2 junior Warren. \nThe ball looped just over the heads of sophomore corner Erik Grant and senior safety Nasir Walker, finding its way into the hands of Warren, who made a brilliant catch just inside the Mountie 5-yard line. \nKeller’s pass was excellent, but it needed to be perfect. It was just a tiny bit overthrown, the momentum taking Warren out of his stride and giving Walker and Grant the opportunity to make the game-saving tackle three yards from the goal line. \nIt was a narrow win in a game Montclair had controlled for much of the day, at least after withstanding the Pirates’ hot start.
