Simpson (c.) cheers while standing with his attorneys F. Lee Bailey (l.) and Johnnie Cochan Jr. (r.), after hearing the not guilty verdict in his crimininal murder trial in Los Angeles, California on Oct. 3, 1995. (Originally published by the Daily News on October 4, 1995. This story was written by David L. Lewis and Michelle Caruso in Los Angeles and Jim Dwyer and Jere Hester in New York.)\nWith the two magical words he'd longed to hear for nearly 16 months - \"not guilty\" - O.J. Simpson, American icon branded heartless killer, left court a free man yesterday.\nThe nation breathlessly watched the trail's final act as the gridiron great triumphantly returned home - and vowed to spend the rest of his life rearing his kids and tracking down their beloved mom's killer.\nMeanwhile, the Daily News learned last night that shortly after Simpson's release, he had telephone discussions with his slain ex-wife's parents over the future of his children, Sydney, 9, and Justin, 7.\nThe children - the youngest victims of the sordid killings - have lived with their maternal grandparents since the June 12, 1994, slayings of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman.\n\"My first obligation is to my young children, who will be raised the way Nicole and I had always planned,\" O.J. said in a statement yesterday.\n\"When things have settled a bit, I will pursue as my primary goal in life the killer or killers that have slaughtered Nicole and Mr. Goldman. They are out there somewhere.\"\nThe dramatic pledge came as a suspense-ridden worldwide audience watched the jury render the stunning and climactic verdict - capping the wildest trial in U.S. history with a final flurry of heart stopping drama.\nBut the verdict - which ignited a cauldron of emotion in the courtroom and around the country - left the killer's identity a secret that died with the victims' last breaths.\nAbout an hour after the verdict, O.J. returned to his mansion in a prison-owned white Ford Aerostar van, trailed by a police caravan - a scene eerily reminiscent of the June 17, 1994, white Ford Bronco chase that ended with the athlete's arrest.\nYesterday, O.J. bounded out of the prison vehicle and into the arms of his childhood buddy and Bronco getaway driver, Al Cowlings. The two hugged for 30 seconds before heading into the mansion, walking arm over arm, brushing away tears.\nO.J. was followed home by family members, who arrived in stretch limos. A white Rolls Royce carried his frail mother, Eunice. Relatives danced and hugged in the front yard, and O.J.'s sister Shirley Simpson Baker cried, \"He's home! He's home!\"\nFamily and friends partied into the night. But sources said O.J., in his mansion for the first time in months, was disoriented - and was disturbed by the helicopters that were buzzing overhead.\nThe verdict from the jury of nine blacks, two whites and one Hispanic ended the Trial of the Century at 1:07 p.m. (EDT) - unleashing pentup emotions from both sides.\nHearing the words \"not guilty,\" the gridiron great smiled and cried in the same instant, his body crunching as he mouthed \"thank you\" and waved to the jurors who set him free after nine months of testimony and less than four hours of deliberations.\nLead defense lawyer Johnnie Cochran clutched O.J.'s shoulder as the football star turned to his family and pumped his fist in the air.\nThe verdict, which ended the most explosive murder case in modern times, ignited emotions in the victims' families. Goldman's sister Kim, who doubled over as her cries pierced the courtroom, muttered, \"That piece of s---.\"\nNew York Daily News Cover of the New York Daily News on October 4, 1995.

Previous Next Enlarge Goldman's father, Fred, muttered angrily as he left the courtroom, \"Murderer.\"\nBut Nicole's family betrayed little emotion, save for her youngest sister, Tanya, who wept outside the courtroom in the arms of a friend.\nCochran hugged his client, who sported the famous grin not seen since the slayings of his 35-year-old ex-wife and her 25-year-old friend.\nO.J.'s adult daughter, Arnelle, shouted \"praise Jesus,\" and smiled through her joyful tears. His son Jason wept so violently that he had to be comforted by a phalanx of lawyers and family members.\nA black male juror, who had smiled at O.J., 48, he entered the courtroom, thrust his fist in a \"black power\" salute as Simpson left the court a free man.\nProsecutors Marcia Clark and Christopher Darden sat stone-faced.\nThe trial cost Los Angeles taxpayers more than $8 million and O.J. an estimated $10 million - but the emotional toll on the main players proved overwhelming.\nTheir bags already packed, the longest-sequestered jury in U.S. history returned to their homes 266 days after they were first squirreled away in a hotel.\nJudge Lance Ito thanked the panelists, who had deliberated for three hours and 40 minutes, for their service.\n\"The burdens we placed upon you were enormous and I can't begin to express the debt we owe you,\" he told the panel of 12 and the two remaining alternates.\nOutside the courthouse throngs of O.J. fans let out a whoop of cheers at news of the verdict as Los Angeles cops strived to keep order.\nIn New York, the city that never sleeps stopped in its tracks - from Wall Street to local taverns - to hear the long-awaited answer to one of the most talked about questions of our time.\nAlso watching was President Clinton, who said, \"The jury heard the evidence and rendered its verdict. Our system of justice requires respect for their decision. At this moment our thoughts and prayers should be with the families of the victims of this terrible crime.\"\n\"The President didn't seem to be surprised\" at the outcome, said White House press secretary Mike McCurry, who described Clinton as somber.\nCochran refused to say what O.J.'s plans were and it wasn't immediately clear when he would be reunited with his children. He also would not comment on reports that O.J. was planning a move to Mexico, though sources told The News that the NFL Hall of Famer had had plans in the works to build a Mexican mansion even before the slayings.\nCochran said that his famed client would not speak out immediately, but he did not address rumors of defense plans for a lucrative pay-per-view TV victory party.\nMYUNG J.

And the heinous slur he was so fond of spewing became euphemistically known as the N word.\nTwo lives were lost but many more were changed, as were long-held ideas of celebrity and justice.\nAnd amid tragedy, the hidden shames of domestic violence and racism were brought to the forefront.\nBooted jurors became instant celebrities, and even the mumbling freeloader Kaelin got his own radio talk show. The initially publicity-shy Goldman family, who attended the trial almost daily, lashed out at the judge and O.J. when the pain became to much to bear.\nFRED PROUSER/REUTERS Nicole Simpson, ex-wife of O.J. Simpson, is shown in this March 16, 1994 photo. HO/REUTERS Ron Goldman, one of the murder victims, is shown in his California driver's license photo. Previous Next Enlarge The Brown family - who initially defended O.J. - channeled their agony into a foundation for domestic violence victims led by Nicole's sister Denise, who took the crusade to Congress.\nO.J.'s adult children, Arnelle and Jason, became adept dodgers of the paparazzi, while his sisters, Carmelita Simpson Durio and Baker, proved his most outspoken defenders.\nShielded from the spotlight by the Browns were Sydney and Justin, who haven't seen their father since their mother's funeral.\nThe case has sparked calls for legal and jury reform - and intensified the national debate surrounding the use of TV cameras in the courtroom.\nAnd the truism that money buys justice was never more apparent. O.J.'s cadre of high priced lawyers included Cochran, F. Lee Bailey and Alan Dershowitz.\nLos Angeles taxpayers doled out millions for prosecution salaries, jury sequestration and jail and court costs. The money trail extended from T-shirt hawkers to tell-all authors to the media - who made the killings of two innocent people a cottage industry.\nBut, ultimately, it was a trail of blood that linked the beloved Heisman Trophy winner O.J. Simpson to the slayings.\nIt was shortly after midnight on June 13, 1994, when the victims' butchered bodies were discovered in the front yard of Nicole's Brentwood condo.\nWhen detectives arrived at O.J.'s estate, 2 miles from the crime scene, to notify the football star of the killings, no one answered the door.\nFuhrman testified that he spotted blood on O.J.'s white Ford Bronco, sparking the decision by cops to hop the wall to the superstar's estate.\nInside they found incriminating blood drops - and the bloody glove matching one found at the crime scene.\nCops slapped the cuffs on O.J. after he returned home from his trip to Chicago, but quickly took them off.\nAs evidence was leaked to the press, O.J. underwent four days of intense media and police scrutiny, culminating in Nicole's emotional funeral June 16, 1994. But apparently no one was looking next day as O.J. took off with his pal Cowlings in a white Ford Bronco. Traffic helicopters got the beat on the Bronco nearly as quickly as cops, while 95 million Americans viewed the spectacle on TV and hundreds formed a gauntlet of highway cheerers.\nPal Robert Kardashian read O.J.'s suicide letter, while Cowlings insisted to cops that the football star was holding a gun to his head in the back of the vehicle.\nO.J. finally returned home, where he was arrested. But in the end, the trial - and its dramatic finale yesterday - would prove to be even more memorable than the Bronco chase.\nWith Timothy Clifford in Washington\nTags: archives", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T20:07:36.905+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
