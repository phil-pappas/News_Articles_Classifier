By KRISTIE RIEKENAP Sports Writer \nHOUSTON (AP) - Texans running back Arian Foster is out for the season with an Achilles tendon injury. \nCoach Bill O'Brien says he expects Foster to miss the rest of the season but didn't elaborate on the injury to Foster's right leg. \nFoster was injured without being hit late in the Texans 44-26 loss to Miami on Sunday. He was in motion when he fell to the ground at the beginning of a play. \nThe injury is a significant blow to a team that has struggled on offense and is just 2-5 after its second blowout loss of year. \nFoster missed the first three games of the season after tearing his groin muscle in training camp. \n___ \nOnline: \nAP NFL website: www.pro32.ap.org and www.twitter.com/AP_NFL Copyright 2015 The Associated Press.
