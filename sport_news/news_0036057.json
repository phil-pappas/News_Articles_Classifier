He is due to be released from King County Jail Friday with the investigation underway. A decision on charges will wait for toxicology results, which could take a month or so. \nCarroll said after Friday’s practice he had yet to talk to Coleman but anticipates being able to do that Saturday morning. Coleman has been indefinitely suspended by the team with his spot on the 53-man roster filled Thursday by the re-signing of receiver B.J.Daniels. \n“We haven’t talked to him nor seen him at all,” Carroll said. “Can’t wait for him to get out and we’ll see him first thing in the morning and I don’t have any information about it right now. … he had a serious accident and there were some serious issues there. We are concerned for everybody’s health and that’s the first thing we want to take a look at.
