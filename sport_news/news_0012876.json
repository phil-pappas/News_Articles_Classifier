And for events to unfold the way they did, it’s hard to put words to it.\n“But I’m a strong believing man, a Biblical man and it’s always darkest before you see the light. And that’s where we are at now. We’ll come out of it and there will be light again like there was 23 months ago and this place is going to be what it’s supposed to be,” added Chick.\n“It’s tough,” said receiver Weston Dressler.\n“In this team’s history, winning that Grey Cup was pretty special and to do it at home made it even more special.\n“You look at our locker-room now compared to then, there’s a lot of new faces. New coaches. Everyone. I wish we had all the answers because then we wouldn’t be finishing up the season like this.”\nSaskatchewan hasn’t had a two-win season since 1980. If this were the final game in Mosaic Stadium, the fan base might be able to convince itself the remnants of the wreckage might be able to patch this team together with bailing wire and binder twine to get one last win. But the Roughriders have all next year in old Taylor Field before moving into the $278 million 33,000-seat New Mosaic Stadium coming out of the parking lot 300 yards away.\nThe Roughriders are a rudderless regiment being coached by interim coach Bob Dyce and run by interim general manager Jeremy O’Day, under new president Craig Reynolds replacing retired Jim Hopson this season.\nGrey Cup-winning coach Corey Chamblin was fired. Grey Cup-winning general manager Brendan Taman was gassed. Quarterback Kevin Glenn was traded to Montreal for a fifth-round selection in the Canadian college draft.\nJerome Messam was dispatched to Calgary for Canadian kicker Tyler Crapigna, a third-round draft pick, and the right to a negotiation list player with the fifth-round pick from Montreal deal for Glenn going the other way.\nLately the Roughriders have taken to “deactivating” players such as Jamal Richardson, Taj Smith and Paul McCallum. Deactivating is apparently a new term meaning ‘still paying a player who is no longer with team.’\nTwo other players, Tyrone Brackenridge and Tearrius George, are on the roster but will be game day scratches.\nDue to injury, quarterback Darian Durant has played nine games since the Grey Cup.\n“Obviously we’ve had some changes we went through. It’s been a difficult stretch. Any time you lose key members of your team it’s going to have a toll but that’s no excuse for the way this year has gone. We’ve definitely had opportunities to win games and unfortunately we weren’t able to,” said receiver Chris Getzlaf of seven games the Riders lost by four or fewer points.\nFunny the way it has worked. Twenty-three months ago when the Roughriders were winning the Grey Cup, Edmonton had just completed a 4-14 season very much like the one Saskatchewan is experiencing right now.\nFollow me on Twitter.com/sunterryjones\nterry.jones@sunmedia.ca\nJust 23 months after their championship, Saskatchewan Roughriders limping to end of two-win season\nBy Terry Jones , Edmonton Sun First posted: Friday, October 23, 2015 07:17 PM EDT | Updated: Friday, October 23, 2015 07:48 PM EDT\nREGINA — Twenty-three months ago the Saskatchewan Roughriders won the Grey Cup here in Mosaic Stadium.\nOf the 42 Grey Cups your correspondent has covered it provided the most memorable scene I’ve ever witnessed.\nDowntown Regina was absolute gridlock.
