In a verdict that could spark a civil rights lawsuit against the New York Police Department, a jury on Friday cleared the 31-year-old Sefolosha of misdemeanor charges for resisting arrest and obstructing the administration of government. Sefolosha will now return to the Hawks’ training camp, but he might also be planning a high-profile lawsuit against the New York Police Department.\nSefolosha’s criminal charges arose after he scuffled with NYPD officers outside the Manhattan nightclub “1 OAK” on Apr. 8. Sefolosha, who happened to be standing near the location where a man had stabbed Indiana Pacers forward Chris Copeland , insists that he was the victim of racial profiling due to being, in the words of Sefolosha attorney John Spiro, “a black man in a hoodie.” Sefolosha also blames the police for causing him to suffer a broken fibula in his leg and ligament damage to his ankle—injuries that prevented him from playing in the 2015 NBA playoffs and continue to plague him.\nNBA Hawks’ Thabo Sefolosha found not guilty of charges in nightclub incident by SI Wire", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/McCannSportsLaw"], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T15:13:23.734+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
