After a lengthy holdout, Tristan Thompson finally agreed to a new contract with the Cavaliers which will pay him a lot of money.\nAdChoices Thompson originally turned down a proposed 4-year, $48 million extension last year. The decision worked out in Thompson's favor as he was able to secure an extra year and higher average annual value. Thompson's new deal will pay him $82 million over five years .\nGranted, teams will be flush with cash when the NBA's new TV deal takes effect. However, that's still a considerable amount of money for a guy who comes off the bench and never averaged more than 31.6 minutes per game. Among those to do a double-take after learning of the contract was Sacramento Kings big man DeMarcus Cousins, who asked a question via his Twitter account.\nHow much???\n— DeMarcus Cousins (@boogiecousins) October 21, 2015 As you can probably expect, Cousins received lots of responses, including one who that took a shot at the center's much chronicled behavior . It didn't go unnoticed though, as Cousins issued a response.\nOoh ok I understand now RT @DekamNeil : @boogiecousins @HPbasketball stop pissing off coaches and organizations and you will get yours.\n— DeMarcus Cousins (@boogiecousins) October 22, 2015 Cousins signed a four-year extension with the Kings in 2013 worth $62 million. When it comes time for him to sign his next deal, it'll be time for others to question how much money he was able to negotiate.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.yardbarker.com/", "https://twitter.com/boogiecousins/status/656981828662726656", "http://larrybrownsports.com/basketball/tristan-thompson-cavs-82-million-deal/278880", "https://twitter.com/boogiecousins/status/656991585180123136", "http://larrybrownsports.com/basketball/vlade-divac-relationship-george-karl-demarcus-cousins-not-pretty/266896", "https://twitter.com/HPbasketball", "https://twitter.com/DekamNeil", "https://twitter.com/boogiecousins", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T20:59:40.861+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
