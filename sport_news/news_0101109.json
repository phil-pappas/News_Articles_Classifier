Slauson didn't need much time to count. \"About six,\" he said.\nSo consider how quickly Slauson, the starting left guard, had to adapt when starting center Will Montgomery suffered a broken left fibula on the game's third play. With rookie center Hroniss Grasu inactive, Slauson shifted in to handle snapping duties for the final 72 plays.\nIt was an uneven performance that included a high shotgun snap deep in Bears territory that quarterback Jay Cutler had to rescue as well as a bungled second-quarter exchange that turned into a Raiders fumble recovery. (The Raiders turned that takeaway into a touchdown.)\nYet Slauson's grit and determination served as buoys for a line that was also playing without starting left tackle Jermon Bushrod.\nSlauson owned up to Cutler's fumble on the second-quarter exchange, admittedly uncomfortable with the Raiders nose tackle lined up directly over him, \"about an inch away from my face.\"\n\"I was really trying to hunker down and really trying to come off the ball hard,\" Slauson explained. \"And I ended up short on the snap.\"\nWith Montgomery potentially done for the season, the Bears must weigh their options at center going forward — Slauson vs. Grasu vs. a potential street free-agent signing. Yet Slauson's effort Sunday, as awkward as it felt, deserved commendation.\nRich Campbell and Brad Biggs on Jay Cutler stepping up Rich Campbell and Brad Biggs on Jay Cutler stepping up when the Bears needed him most.\nRich Campbell and Brad Biggs on Jay Cutler stepping up when the Bears needed him most.\nSee more videos \"That's part of being a pro,\" Slauson said. \"I have to do what I'm asked. And in that type of scenario, I have to do it and I can't have any reservations about it.\"\nComing up big: Martellus Bennett was arguably the offense's greatest catalyst, recording 11 catches for 83 yards and a touchdown. Three of Bennett's catches converted third downs. And his final grab — a 7-yarder along the sideline — came on fourth-and-5 from the Bears' 25, extending the game-winning drive.\nBennett also scored a 5-yard TD in the second quarter, uncovered on a corner route when linebacker Malcolm Smith covered Matt Forte in the flat while two other Raiders converged on tight end Zach Miller at the goal line.\n\"Jay threw a great ball,\" Bennett said. \"And everybody was flying to their spots. And when everybody's flying to their spots like that, there's always going to be somebody to come open on that type of play.\"\nInjury update: Starting safety Antrel Rolle left Soldier Field with a walking boot on his right foot after suffering an ankle injury early in the second half. Rolle was replaced in the secondary by Harold Jones-Quartey . His departure was the latest significant injury for a team that also played Sunday without receiver Alshon Jeffery (hamstring), defensive lineman Jeremiah Ratliff (ankle) and cornerback Alan Ball (groin).\nExtra points: Matt Forte surpassed 8,000 rushing yards for his career. His 25 carries for 91 yards gave him 8,071 for his career. He's No. 2 in Bears history behind Walter Payton (16,726). ... Charles Woodson's fourth-quarter interception was the 62nd of his career and his seventh against the Bears.\n Chicago Bears Martellus Bennett Matt Slauson Will Montgomery Matt Forte Hroniss Grasu Jay Cutler", "external_links": ["http://www.tribpub.com/privacy-policy-and-your-privacy-rights/", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-5611ccc3/turbine/ct-rich-campbell-and-brad-biggs-on-jay-cutler-stepping-up-20151004", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-56127d7e/turbine/ct-matt-slauson-bits-bears-raiders-spt-1005-20151004"], "published": "2015-10-05T05:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T01:48:45.397+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
