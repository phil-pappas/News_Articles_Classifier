Romania's joint-top international goalscorer with 35 goals (sharing the distinction with Gheorghe Hagi) and FC Pune City's marquee player, Mutu now hopes for another chance to set the record straight.\nExcerpts from an exclusive telephonic interview with TOI on Sunday.\nYour move to FC Pune City is out of compulsion or choice?\nI had offers from a couple of European clubs but I chose FC Pune City. I am grateful to the president after what happened last year. I could not get to India on time and he behaved very well with me. I appreciate that. It was one of the reason why I chose to stick with FC Pune City.\nYou did not play competitive football for almost a year...\nI didn't play for almost nine months but I have been working hard in training. The pre-season here (in Turkey) has helped a great deal. I know there is lot of work ahead of me but I am sure I will be in good shape when the tournament starts next month.\nAre you happy with those around you at FC Pune City?\nI think we have a very good team. I know these are early days but I am impressed by the Indian players. I did not expect them to be so good. Of course, they lack experience but they are all good players.\nYou are 36 now. How many more years do you give yourself at the top?\nI don't know. I still have that passion of playing football and I will keep doing it even after India. But, honestly, I cannot put a time frame on it. Let me see how this (season) goes and then I will take a call.\nYou had an unremarkable past, especially those days at Chelsea FC, Fiorentina and subsequent bans for failing anti-doping test. Do you get upset when someone reminds you of your past?\nAll this is something of the past but I know it's going to follow me wherever I go for the rest of my life. There is no denying I made mistakes. But everyone makes mistakes, isn't it? Those days are all behind me.\nYou are Romania's joint top international goal-scorer, alongside the great Gheorghe Hagi. Any regrets that you could not surpass his record?\nFor that to happen, I have to get another chance. I am now focused on FC Pune City and the ISL, and I hope I will be in good shape at the end of it all to get a call from the national team.\nFollow TOI Sports on Twitter >> @TOISportsNews ", "external_links": ["https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.toi.reader.activities", "https://twitter.com/TOISportsNews"], "published": "2015-09-07T16:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T13:26:06.615+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
