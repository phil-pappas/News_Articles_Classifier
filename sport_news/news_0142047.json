Back | Next Photos by Josh Galemore/Savannah Morning News\nSavannah’s Ken Schuster sits in his 1990 Mazda Miata.\nBy Nathan Dominitz\nSavannah’s Ken Schuster isn’t just talking a load of fertilizer — that’s his day job — about his sincere love of auto racing.\n“I always wanted to race since I was a little kid,” said Schuster, 60, the vice president of Gavilon Fertilizer LLC. “I finally found a race car I could afford, and this is what I have.”\nHe has a 1990 Mazda Miata, which he bought in June for under $10,000 and entered for the first time Saturday in the eighth annual Savannah Speed Classic. A member of the Oglethorpe Driving Club, Schuster said that for years he has assisted other local drivers at the Grand Prize of America road course on Hutchinson Island.\n“I crewed for them,” said Schuster, who also has served as a co-driver with Savannah’s Mickey Carter and his 1988 Nissan 300ZX for endurance races at other venues. “They ran their Porsches. I helped out, whatever they needed, checking tires, checking oil, helping them get to the grid.”\nIt was his turn Saturday in the Group 3 race — more precisely, Schuster and Kermit’s turn. The deep-green Miata is nicknamed Kermit, and a frog doll was lashed to the roll bar during the race.\nThe field, originally at 34, included 26 cars and nine different classifications. Among them was Savannah native Jim Dixon, who drove his 1986 Mazda RX7 to eighth place overall and second in the SSB class.\nBefore the race, Schuster explained that his car wasn’t built to be as fast as others in Group 3, but he hoped to do well among the four cars in the SSC class.\n“It’s a very friendly environment. It’s racing, but it’s like polite racing,” he said. “Everybody wants to win, but most people have a lot more invested in their cars than I do. A lot of these cars are worth hundreds of thousands of dollars. ... If you wreck your own car, that’s bad enough, but you really don’t want to wreck somebody else’s car.”\nSchuster didn’t wreck — “Kermit came home in one piece,” he said — but he was a bit disappointed in how his Speed Classic debut played out.\nFor starters, his car was among the last released from a parked position in the pit area. Another car stalled ahead of him and then, instead of pulling over, continued onto the track, creating a larger gap between the first bunch and last. The pace lap should have closed the margin, and Schuster noted that there were three pace laps, but “for whatever reason, people weren’t getting close enough so they had to keep going until everybody grouped together.”\nCars can’t pass during the pace laps, and when Schuster finally could go full-out, he was on lap 4 and in 25th place overall. That was an issue, too, because the race was slated for 25 minutes. It was scheduled for 2:20 p.m. but a delay from the prior race pushed the start to 2:39 p.m. for the first pace lap.\nThe white flag — indicating one lap to go — came out at 2:54 p.m. — indicating the race would be abbreviated. It finished a minute later for 16 minutes of track time.\n“I kept thinking, ‘I’m getting closer and closer to some other guys, another couple of laps I can pass them,’” Schuster said. “I thought I could get up to (place) 22, 21, but there wasn’t enough time.”\nAs Kermit the Frog would say, it’s not easy being green.\nSchuster finished 24th overall and fourth in his class, as he was on Lap 6 when the fastest car, Alan and Jonathan Ziegelman’s 1973 Porsche 914 from Boca Raton, Fla., crossed the finish line on Lap 7.\nStill, Schuster was happy with his car and making incremental progress in his racing experience.\n“If you can make improvements, eventually you’ll get faster and faster, and you can compete with those other guys,” Schuster said.\nDixon’s run\nDixon was having a bittersweet day before the Group 3 race. In an open-wheel grouping, he drove his 2000 Star Pro Mazda to the second-fastest qualifying time. But Dixon, who has had great results in the IndyCar class at his favorite racing venue in the country, had to withdraw the car.\n“The motor was retired today ... It blew up,” Dixon said of the qualifying session. “We knew it was down on power, but we thought we’d give it a shot.\n“We’re going to rebuild it,” he continued. “We’ll be back next year.”\nHe raced later Saturday in Group 3 and credited the aggressive driving of SSB class winner Joey Sullivan of Greenville, S.C., whose 1989 Porsche 944/S2 finished two spots ahead of Dixon overall.\n“He ran a really good race,” said Dixon, who grabbed a piece of paper to show how tight the space was between cars at some points of the race.\n“I couldn’t believe nobody exchanged body paint,” Dixon said. “It was that tight, especially the first two laps.”\nDixon was hampered by a “fuel delivery issue” with the fuel pump which slowed him “about a second a lap.”\n“It was starving for fuel,” Dixon said of his car. “I had to get back on the brakes and let the fuel settle in the tank. It was one of those things.”\nWhile he wanted to win his class, Dixon could only shrug and say he had fun, anyway.\n“No scratches. That’s a good day,” he said. “Any time you finish, that’s a good day.”\nNote: The Speed Classic concludes today. For more details and a full schedule, go to www.SavannahSpeedClassic.com .
