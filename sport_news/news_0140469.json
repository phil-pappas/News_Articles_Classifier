Aaron Schooler of Edmonton was one second faster to take the bronze medal. Van den Ham’s teammate, Raphael Gagne of Quebec City, topped the field at 1:02:35. \nVan den Ham’s brother, Doug, who now lives in Ottawa, placed third in the master men’s event for riders at least 30 years of age. He completed his five laps in 45:25. \n» The Brandon Sun Rate this This article has not yet been rated. We want you to tell us what you think of our articles.
