There’s no sugar-coating it,” said captain Mark Giordano. “It hasn’t been good. But sitting here today, we’re still in position we can get some points and get back in it. We’ve got to play with a higher level or energy and compete and we’ll be fine.” \nOnly a couple of weeks into the season and already the Flames are facing the reality their season could be slipping away in a hurry. \nFortunately, they know the issue to solve is pretty simple: They’re not playing with enough urgency and determination. \n“We came in real hungry last year and had that us-against-the-world-type attitude,” said forward Joe Colborne, who’s nearing a return from a pre-season broken thumb. “I think we’ve seen it in spurts, but it’s tough. Watching those games, I didn’t really recognize our hockey team sometimes.” \nThe whips appear out, with Monday’s practice at the WinSport facility at Canada Olympic Park very intense and business-like. \nObviously, they all know there’s a job to do. \n“We know we’re better than this. We can hold ourselves accountable and need to,” said head coach Bob Hartley, who also has mixed up his top two lines. \n“It’s always about being urgent. Everything we do, it’s about being urgent. We just have to get back to our good habits, get back to our preparation and we’re gonna be fine. No one feels sorry for us and no one will do it for us. We’re on our own.” \nBut Hartley’s formula isn’t just to put his players through harder paces. \nHe’s decided to separate Jiri Hudler from Johnny Gaudreau and Sean Monahan, opting for him to skate with Sam Bennett and Mikael Backlund. In turn, Michael Frolik skated on right wing with Gaudreau and Monahan. \n“After many years of (marriage), sometimes a weekend off is good,” Hartley said. \nThat said, changing up the lines will be akin to re-arranging the deck chairs on the Titanic if the Flames don’t find what’s missing from their game and find it in a hurry. \n“Right now, there’s a lot missing,” Bennett said. “We’ll have a couple good shifts but I think just overall there’s not enough compete and there’s not enough effort from all the guys, including myself. I think everybody has to be better. \n“This game is gonna be huge, just to prove we’re gonna respond and we’re gonna bounce back from the bad start we’ve had,” he added. “We’ve got to play a lot more hungry and a lot more aggressive, and there’s no doubt in my mind you’re gonna see that Tuesday.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T02:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T20:22:28.765+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
