But a dud can drag down an entire night. And that hurts the bottom line, since networks charge advertisers top dollar to run commercials during a hit show.\nSo how's the Fall 2015 TV Season shaping up, now that we're in the thick of it? Early ratings seem to reflect the ongoing trend of viewers moving away from watching shows when they first air on TV. The erosion is caused by viewers waiting to watch a show recorded on the DVR; checking it out later on demand; waiting for it to show up on Hulu or Netflix; watching it on a network's streaming service; and so on.\nThere are still new shows yet to debut, including the promising \"Supergirl,\" which premieres on CBS Monday, Oct. 26. But with the majority of new shows having made their bid for our attention, some newbies are showing signs of life, while others have already worn out their welcome.\nBiggest Trend: Networks are declaring – and is that a note of panic we hear in their press releases? – that ratings from a show's initial broadcast are just a shred of the story. We have to wait for the ratings that indicate how it did in delayed viewing from DVRs, etc., to get the full picture, we're told. For example, Fox has been attempting to swat away the disappointing live ratings for its highly hyped \"Scream Queens,\" by telling us to look at how its numbers go up in time-shifted viewing.\nTime-shifting is a fact of viewing life, but there's also no denying the fact that new series such as Fox's \"Minority Report\" and ABC's \"Blood and Oil\" have been leaking viewers each week. When a new show sees its numbers go down each week, that's a sign that viewers sampled, and didn't like what they saw.\nQuality Doesn't Necessarily Count: The new ABC comedy, \"Dr. Ken,\" has done surprisingly OK so far on Fridays. Which is good news for the network and star Ken Jeong. But \"Dr. Ken\" was one of my picks for worst new shows of the season. I guess somebody's liking it more than I did.\nWinners: New shows that seem to be clicking with enough viewers to hang around for a while include NBC's \"Blindspot,\" ABC's \"Quantico,\" CBS' \"Life in Pieces\" and \"Limitless,\" and Fox's \"Rosewood.\"\n\"American Horror Story: Hotel,\" on FX, got a lift from time-shifted viewing, reaching more than 12 million viewers between its debut on Oct. 7 through Oct. 11, as Variety reports. AMC's monster hit \"The Walking Dead\" again scared up plenty of viewers for its Season 6 premiere Oct. 11, with 14.6 million viewers. That was a drop from the Season 5 premiere, which was seen by 17.3 million viewers. But the 14.6 million number doesn't include time-shifted viewing, which was still being calculated as I write this, so the rating will go up.\nLosers: I'm gnashing my teeth that Fox's \"The Grinder,\" which I think is one of the better comedies this season, isn't doing better. NBC's \"The Player\" hasn't set the Nielsen ratings on fire, either. And I'm distraught that the Season 2 premiere of FX's \"Fargo,\" the best show of the Fall 2015 season, was watched by only 1.6 million total viewers in its initial broadcast Oct. 12. Again, I hope that increases with delayed viewings. People, please – you can watch \"Fargo,\" and you're watching \"Dr. Ken\"?\nWhat We've Learned: At the risk of sounding like a broken record (to cite technology from the days when there were only three TV networks), viewers have so many options now, it's harder than ever to a) get people to check out a new show; and b) take a chance on something different. The series that are doing well this fall are all familiar, or offer slight riffs on the same-old, same-old.\n\"Blindspot\" is going for the \"Blacklist\" mystery/adventure audience; \"Limitless\" is a CBS procedural with a twist (the hero takes a pill that super-powers his brain); \"Quantico\" borrows some pages from the \"Scandal\" / \"How to Get Away with Murder\" playbook; and \"Life in Pieces\" is, at root, an ensemble family comedy, the same formula that's worked for \"Modern Family\" for years now.\nIt may make business sense to follow these templates, but overall, it's produced a Fall TV season that's been generally uninspiring and undistinguished.\nCancellation and Renewal News: And the churning never stops, as recent news about shows that have been picked up for another season, and those that are getting the ax reminds us.\nIn the \"Thank goodness it's going\" category, CBS saw the light and canceled \"Under the Dome.\" The network also gave up on the Halle Berry series, \"Extant,\" which never managed to get a head of steam going. But CBS renewed its freshman summer series, \"Zoo.\"\nThe CW announced that the upcoming fourth season of \"Beauty and the Beast\" is the last, and they haven't even said when that final season will air (Variety says probably in midseason or Summer 2016.) And \"America's Next Top Model\" won't return once Season 22 (!) wraps up this winter.\nIn cable, AMC did the right thing and renewed the creatively resurgent \"Halt and Catch Fire\" for a third season. FX approved a Season 3 for \"Tyrant,\" which I gave up on after its flawed first season. Lifetime ordered another \"Devious Maids\" season. TNT will set sail on another season of \"The Last Ship.\" Syfy renewed \"Killjoys\" and \"Dark Matter.\" And Comedy Central wisely renewed \"The Nightly Show with Larry Wilmore.\"\nThe news wasn't so good for USA's one-and-done season of \"Complications,\" which won't return. TNT also bid a fast farewell to the one-season drama, \"Proof.\" Syfy canceled \"Dominion\" after two seasons.\nAnd it looks like \"Community\" is finally, really canceled. The hard-to-kill cult favorite comedy was canceled by NBC, then moved to Yahoo for a sixth season. Star Joel McHale said in an interview this summer that the show won't be coming back.\nWith all those cancellations, there's more time to watch \"Fargo.\" Right? Tune in Mondays at 10 p.m., on FX. I'm going to keep nagging until you do.\n-- Kristi Turnquist\nkturnquist@oregonian.com\n503-221-8227\n@Kristiturnquist", "external_links": ["https://screen.yahoo.com/community/", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/IQt9iwHgaMo", "http://www.usanetwork.com/complications", "http://www.nbc.com/blindspot", "http://www.nbc.com/the-player", "http://www.fox.com/scream-queens", "http://abc.go.com/shows/dr-ken", "http://www.tntdrama.com/shows/the-last-ship.html", "http://abc.go.com/shows/blood-and-oil", "http://abc.go.com/shows/scandal", "http://variety.com/2015/tv/news/american-horror-story-hotel-ratings-fx-delayed-viewing-1201615829/", "https://twitter.com/kristiturnquist", "http://www.syfy.com/darkmatter", "http://www.fxnetworks.com/shows/american-horror-story/episodes", "http://www.cwtv.com/shows/americas-next-top-model", "http://www.fox.com/the-grinder", "http://www.cbs.com/shows/limitless/", "http://abc.go.com/shows/how-to-get-away-with-murder", "http://www.fxnetworks.com/shows/tyrant/extras", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/QEBqs6DHVc4", "http://www.syfy.com/dominion", "http://abc.go.com/shows/quantico", "http://www.fox.com/minority-report", "http://www.tntdrama.com/videos/proof/season-1/extras/1064406/teaser.html", "http://www.amc.com/shows/halt-and-catch-fire", "http://www.amc.com/shows/the-walking-dead", "http://www.cc.com/shows/the-nightly-show", "http://www.mylifetime.com/shows/devious-maids", "http://www.syfy.com/killjoys", "http://www.cbs.com/shows/life-in-pieces/video/", "http://www.fox.com/rosewood", "http://www.fxnetworks.com/shows/fargo/episodes", "http://www.cwtv.com/shows/beauty-and-the-beast/destined/?play=091a8d1f-63d9-460b-8206-fa2b14b45d1c"], "published": "2015-10-16T13:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T16:28:43.754+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
