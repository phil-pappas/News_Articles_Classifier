The triceps was swollen afterward, but Harvey has improved.\nThe right-hander threw a side session before Tuesday's game and said he felt fine. He defeated the Cubs by throwing 7 2/3 innings of two-run ball in Game 1. \nMATZ'S TURN: Steven Matz makes his second postseason start tonight in Game 4. He allowed three runs in five innings in his playoff debut during the division series against the Dodgers.\nMatz will be pitching on seven days' rest.\n\"It hasn't been too challenging,\" Matz said of not starting on regular rest. \"I'm still able to get my work in between starts. You know you're not on necessarily a routine as much as you were during the regular season. I'm still able to get my work in, and I still feel fresh for each start.\"\nAgainst the Dodgers, Matz had just one bad inning in which he allowed all three runs. He surrendered six hits on 85 pitches.\nPitching coach Dan Warthen said Monday the team considered starting Matz in Game 2 of this series, but opted for Noah Syndergaard when Syndergaard said he felt fine after a relief appearance in Los Angeles.\nMatz hopes to build off the success the team's other starters have had.\n\"[The Cubs] look like a tough lineup. They're a bunch of young, fiery guys,\" Matz said. \"Matt and Noah have done a great job the first two games, so I'm just going to watch Jacob [deGrom on Tuesday night], see how he attacks them, and try to build off those guys.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T04:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T08:41:30.083+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
