(WKYT) - Kentucky Sports Radio's Matt Jones shares his thoughts on the importance of tomorrow's game for the Kentucky Wildcats. \nI'm Matt Jones and this is Overtime. \nKentucky plays Eastern Kentucky tomorrow night and in a big game, as the Cats want to get a big win. It's also a chance to get some guys in the game that we haven't seen. \nThe biggest is Drew Barker. \nNow everybody knows about Drew Barker. He played at Conner High School and he's very good, but we haven't had a chance to see against other teams in live action. \nFor Barker, it's a chance for him to finally show people he can do something other than make news off the field. He's a scrambler. I call him the Johnny Maziel of Kentucky. \nWe're going to get to see a little bit of that tomorrow night, hopefully. \nHe's able to run around alot, he's got a pretty good arm and he's got great feet. Unfortunately, because these games have been so close, we haven't seen Drew. \nTomorrow he will. \nThe key is, he can't lose his mind against an Eastern team that was part of that fight you may remember last spring. He needs to play, show fans what he can do, get the ball down field and get through the game. \nThe SEC is very difficult, guys get hurt and Patrick Towles could end up getting hurt. If so, the season could rely on Drew Barker. \nIt's important that he shows what he can do tomorrow, so if they need him later, he'll be ready. I'm Matt Jones and this has been overtime.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T23:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T06:10:21.990+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
