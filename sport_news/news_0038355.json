Staff photo by Kathryn Ingall slideshow After keeping its playoff hopes alive with a big win over Cherokee last week, Woodstock will look to stay the course Friday at Walton.A big reason the Wolverines (4-3, 2-3 Region 5 ) were able to win last week was due to the play of quarterback Liam Byrne, who threw for 345 yards and three touchdowns. The junior has looked more comfortable every week since taking over the starting job from the injured Garrett Bass, and Woodstock coach Brent Budde expects to continue. “The conditions were better,” he said. “(Byrne) understood his reads better, and he understood he couldn’t take the sacks. He played a fantastic game. The offensive line did a good job protecting him, and he got the ball out of his hands quickly. All that played into it, but I expect him to keep playing better and keep getting more comfortable out there.”That improvement was also noted by Walton coach Maurice Dixon, who said the ninth-ranked Raiders (6-1, 4-1) will have their hands full trying to contain Louis Hall, Jerrail McMickens and the rest of the Wolverines’ playmakers.“They’re a team that really likes to spread the ball around,” Dixon said. “They’ll put a lot of athletes out there, and they love to test you deep. It’s going to be important that we don’t give up the big plays, because they’ll definitely take their shots.”While Walton will have the tall task of stopping Woodstock, the Wolverines will likely have just as much trouble stopping the Raiders, who have been impressive with quarterback Addison Shoup spreading the ball around to receiver Dominic Blaylock, tight end Sam Letton and running back K.K. Brooks.“I feel really good about our offense,” Dixon said. “I feel like we have the players to score a lot of points, and we don’t have to be one-dimensional. We can throw it when we need to throw, and we can run it when we need to do that.”Stopping that versatility will not be easy, but Budde said he has seen his defense improve each week. Led by ball-hawking cornerback Da’shaun Tanner, the Woodstock held Cherokee scoreless until midway through the fourth quarter last week.“I have a lot of confidence in our defense right now,” Budde said. “I think our defense has really stepped it up the last couple weeks, and we obviously have to continue with that. Along with that is playing your assignment, getting pressure on the quarterback and stopping the run, all those basic things that every defense is trying to do. It’s just a matter of going out and executing.”Friday’s game will have playoff implications for both teams. Walton is one game back of first-place Roswell and cannot afford to drop another game to contend for the title. Woodstock is tied with Wheeler in fifth place, a half-game behind Cherokee, and will have its back against the wall for the remainder of the season.Dixon said motivation is never an issue for his team, especially when it plays at home. Budde said his players know how important the game is, but he has not strayed from his original message.“We just have to keep getting better every week,” Budde said.” That’s what it’s about. We played our most complete game of the year last week against a good Cherokee team, and we’re going to have to turn it up another notch this week to get ready for Walton.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T08:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T10:05:08.853+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
