To turn this thing around in a few days and handle the challenge of the week. I was really proud of these guys, like we told you, their attitude was really good going into it. They wanted to have a good week. They wanted to get this thing done and get feeling right, and we did all of that. It was a good solid win. It’s always cool to win in the division. It’s great to win on the road and all that. Defense played really well all night. One drive gets them some points, but other than that I thought it was a great night and a fantastic night rushing the passer. Really highlighted by [Seattle Seahawks DE] Michael Bennett, did a great job tonight with a bunch of sacks and all. So, it was really good to see that. It’s nice to see us run the football again run it with success. [Seattle Seahawks RB] Marshawn Lynch had a really solid night tonight, and the guys up front did a good job too. It all felt well organized and all, so a lot of good things. There was a terrific play pass [Seattle Seahawks offensive coordinator] Darrell Bevell called to rocket the ball down the field. Great pass by [Seattle Seahawks QB] Russell [Wilson], and that was good stuff for us. So, it was a good night all around and solid. We’d like to get out of here and get a little break this weekend. The players are going to take advantage of that. Come back with a big week next week and start Monday with Dallas.”\nJust overall can you talk about the finish on both sides of the ball the way you did? “Yeah, that’s the way it’s supposed to be. I mean, that’s supposed to be normal, to be able to finish a game like that. And so, I don’t make a big deal about it. That’s just the way we should be playing. We should be finishing like that.”\nThe defense and the running game, how much more did this feel like a program tonight? “Yeah, it felt like a really normal Seahawk night tonight. It was great to have an opening drive like that with eating up a bunch of clock and run the football to the end of it and stay with the run to get it done. All of that. Just the feeling of the here we go, closing out, we’ve got the ball the last three or four minutes or whatever it was, and we take it to the end of the game. That’s how we’re supposed to finish these games.”\nIt looked like you used a lot of I-formation with Seattle Seahawks FB Will Tukuafu and stuff like that, I mean is that something you kind of wanted to get back to? “We had some good force with it. Will’s playing really good football for us. We’re really excited about what he’s doing. We’re fitting together a role for him. And, he’s a live component on defense as well. He’s just doing a nice job. There’s a big load coming up in there and he’s got a good attitude about it, of course. And, Marshawn really could feel that he was running behind him well, and I think we’re going to continue to see that grow and open. And, I’m just really proud of Will. He’s a terrific kid, and you know he was kind of forgotten for a little bit, and he’s back in action and we love what he’s offering our team right now.”\nWhat allowed the pass rush to be so effective all night long? “Guys were getting off the ball great. I think [Seattle Seahawks DE] Mike Bennett was causing problems and just getting off of the line of scrimmage really well. Everybody contributed. [Seattle Seahawks DE] Cliff Avril had a really good night too. So, it was good to see everybody being involved. Mike is such a disrupter. He really caused problems even when he wasn’t getting to the quarterback he was causing some issues and some guys were giving it up. It was a really good night for us.”\nSome big plays for Russell, but also a couple picks. How do you kind of assess this? “I was really disappointed in the long ball. That was too bad. We don’t need to do that. He thought he had something, but we don’t need to throw the ball like that. The other one, it was a scramble and he saw [Seattle Seahawks WR] Doug Baldwin and he flashed to throw that ball and he lost track of what was going on. And so, that’s a mistake for us, but the other one, the last time we did that it was against the Cardinals. I think it was the first game or something like that. So, no need to throw the ball like that.”\nYou were kind of moving Seattle Seahawks T Garry Gilliam and Seattle Seahawks G/T Bailey Alvin, they were rotating or was that a performance thing? “No, no, Garry came in with a sore ankle and so, we just wanted to see how he could do. So then, we had prepared Alvin to play. We wanted to give him some time to see how he was doing and not give Garry the whole burden of the game. And so, they’re in and out a little bit. We need to do better on that edge though, they got to us pretty good on there.”\nYou had Seattle Seahawks CB Richard Sherman follow San Francisco 49ers WR Torrey Smith it looked like, what was the thought process behind that? You’ve moved him around more this year. “Well, we thought that it was a good matchup. [Seattle Seahawks CB] Cary [Williams] played against the other guy for a long time and know him, so we thought that familiarity might help a little bit. We respected 82, getting downfield and he had a big game last week. We just thought it was a good idea.”\nWhat did you see from these guys in the three days in between the Panthers loss and tonight that made you convinced they were going to come out like this? “Well, like I think I told you guys all week, they responded well coming back on Monday. We had to go right to work and get into the game plan on Monday. We were on field for an hour or something the day after the game. Their attitude about it was they were going to go ahead and look forward. It’s a huge asset when you have the ability to focus like that and let things go, win or lose, and come back to the work mentality. That’s so important. They demonstrated that Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday. We did a walk-thru today. A full Saturday walk-thru today to get prepared. Everybody was in the right mentality, attitude, and it showed. It was a really complete game for us.”\nWhat was Marshawn Lynch’s early game nausea? “He just, I think the first drive just got him a little bit. He carried a bunch with that first drive, fighting in the line of scrimmage and all just gassed him right off the bat, and then he came back fine. It was good to have [RB] Thomas Rawls go in there, we didn’t have any hesitation putting him in. Tom’s supposed to get a calf, something with his calf, a little strain or something. It might be a bruise but we don’t know yet.”\nAny other injuries, Seattle Seahawks T Russell Okung went out? “He’s fine.”\nSeattle Seahawks WR Tyler Lockett had the big play but got involved in a lot of other plays too as a receiver, I mean was he – “Yeah, he did a nice job tonight. Unfortunately, we can’t shake loose on the returns like we’d like. We’ll just keep focusing on it. We know we can, but we didn’t. The execution of the big play was perfect. It was really beautiful job of protection and the quarterback throwing, and he ran the route to get open, and the execution of the catch too. It was a challenge at the back end. That was just a beautiful play for us. One of the best plays of the year, I think.”\nRussell and Tyler have been close to connecting previously. “Yeah, last week we missed a 65-yarder, and I hope we can continue to find him deep. He’s obviously a big threat.”\nIt’s just one night, but the music bumping, the guys are laughing. Does it feel a little bit back to normal? “These guys love to win. They play to execute like this, they’re having a blast and we’ve got a weekend break here coming up. A huge opportunity coming back next week with Dallas. These guys know how to have fun. They’ve done enough winning, they want to enjoy that, so it’s really a good feeling though.”\nYou had another game where the turnover margin was not – “I don’t want to talk about that. I can’t, there’s no place in my brain, like I told you, for this. I don’t understand. Minus two, I don’t know how that happens. What’s going to be really exciting is if we turn this thing in the right direction. We’re going to really be in great shape and that’s I can’t even imagine if that continues to happen.”\nWith Richard’s versatility, has he allowed you to do more with him this year? “Absolutely he has, but we haven’t been able to take advantage of him working in the nickel spot, but that’s an illustration of that, exactly and he’s very comfortable with all of that. The best part about it mentally, he’s so up for the challenge and all those kinds of things and so we can use just about anything he can do in the corner with Richard.”\nWhat effect do you think Seattle Seahawks LB Bobby Wagner’s had on the defense? “Well, he’s going to have an effect. He’s that good of a player, he’s terrific, and he was a little rusty tonight. He had a couple plays he could fix, but he played really well. It’s just great having him back. It’s having like the gang back together, and it’s just the right way that we’re fitted, and he’s a big asset to us.”\nThere were a couple special teams tackles for Seattle Seahawks SS Kelcie McCray. How big a pickup has he been on special teams? “He’s been really good. He has really been one of the real standouts for us on special teams. He’s got tremendous discipline about him and he really has a great respect for the job that he has, and he applies himself beautifully. He’s become a real leader and production-wise as well. That’s a great pickup, a great job by [Seattle Seahawks general manager] John [Schneider] to find him.”\nt seemed things shifted when the San Francisco 49ers got an interception in the third quarter, but you held them to a field goal. How big was that? What did you say to the team? “I told them we needed to not let them score again, and they did just exactly what the coach said. That was one of the opportunities that things could have switched and could have flipped, but it didn’t. It was a really good job of going up and not letting them get a touchdown down there. The statements that you have to make at the end of these games, to finish the way we want to finish. We did on the other side of the ball, killing the clock, we converted a couple of third downs when we needed to and that’s really the difference. Our games are so close. We’ve been so close to a totally different outcome right now and these guys know that, and so we’re holding on to that and we’re going to try to take it one week at a time. It’s a long season, a lot of time left.”\nDo you get a sense that the catch from Tyler was almost like a game-saving catch. There aren’t a lot of plays, but you guys are taking advantage of the few big plays. “I don’t think it was a game-saving catch, I thought it was just great execution. It was too early in the game to think it was game-saving, but it was a beautiful play.”\nBob Condotta : 206-515-5699 or bcondotta@seattletimes.com ; on Twitter: @bcondotta .
