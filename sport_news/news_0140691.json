There are no easy games in the Premier League but hopefully we can get the three points on Sunday.\" \nAlli will be competing with the likes of Mousa Dembele, Eric Dier and Ryan Mason for a place in Mauricio Pochettino's midfield. \nAnd although the former MK Dons man is expecting a challenge, he has backed Spurs to do the business on the south coast. \n\"I'm really excited and I can't wait to get out there for the game,\" Alli said. \n\"It's not going to be easy. Bournemouth are a great team, they've got a lot of strengths but so have we, so hopefully we're going to go there, play our own game and try to get the three points. \n\"We're going to their patch, they're not going to make it easy for us and we know we're going to have to fight for the win, but I think we've got a great team so we'll work as hard as we can.\" \nLike Alli, Harry Kane came off the bench in Brussels having only been deemed fit enough to be a substitute after sustaining a knock in the draw with Liverpool. \nBut the England forward is also likely to come back into the side having once again been backed by Pochettino despite only scoring one club goal this campaign.
