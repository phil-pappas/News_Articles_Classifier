Patrick Gengler.\nDeputies said the pair was part of a group of motorcyclists participating in a charity ride sponsored by the motorcycle riders rights advocacy group A.B.A.T.E. of Illinois.\nCrash reports indicate that as Dalton and Nickence approached the intersection of Main Street and Green Road in unincorporated Blackberry Township, Dalton swerved his 2000 Yamaha motorcycle in an attempt to avoid a helmet that had fallen off of another rider.\nDalton ended up crashing the bike, and both he and Nickence were severely injured, Gengler said.\nNickence was taken to Delnor Hospital in Geneva for treatment. Dalton was airlifted to Advocate Good Samaritan Hospital in Downers Grove. Gengler said their condition is unknown.\nMain Street was closed for about two hours while the crash was investigated. Deputies said no tickets have been issued.\nGengler could not confirm if Dalton or Nickence were wearing helmets.\newurst@tribpub.com\nCopyright Â© 2015, Aurora Beacon-News Aurora", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-561be23b/turbine/ct-abn-kane-bike-crash-st-1013-20151012"], "published": "2015-10-12T19:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T22:34:49.453+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
