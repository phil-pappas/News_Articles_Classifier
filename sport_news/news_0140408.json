I said to them at halftime I would rather lose than play the way we did the first half.\"\nWestern Sydney dominated the first 45 minutes without being able to break down the Sydney defense. Jaushua Sotirio's appeared to have scored from a header for the Wanderers before halftime but was deemed offside.\n\"It's a goal,\" Wanderers coach Tony Popovic said. \"If it's line ball and we're supposed to be giving the attacking team an advantage then that's a goal.\n\"We were clearly the better side, not probably better but clearly better.\"\nNewcastle extended an eight-game and six-year winning streak over the Victory at home with Friday's 1-0 win at Hunter Stadium. David Carney scored in the 75th minute to give Newcastle the points and to leave Victory coach Kevin Muscat to lament his team's poor finishing.\n\"We dominated the game territorially, just in the final third, the end-product, creating those opportunities and turning good chances into goals wasn't there and we paid the price for it,\" Muscat said.\nWellington conceded an early goal to Dimitri Petratos, but rallied for a 3-2 win after substitute Blake Powell scored in the 78th minute.\n\"I thought the first goal was against the run of play,\" Wellington coach Ernie Merrick said. \"I thought we had them on toast. We've got so many boys now that want to score goals.\"\nMelbourne City beat Central Coast 3-1 on Sunday. The third round will conclude with a match between Perth and Adelaide.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share?text=Sydney+wins+tight+derby+to+go+atop+A-League+table", "http://player.mediabong.net/se/56.js?url="], "published": "2015-10-25T20:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T17:39:28.282+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
