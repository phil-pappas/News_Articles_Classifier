For the first timers, this year you’re getting a succinct review. Essentially, we’ll talk fantasy relevant touch, target, and snap count data to help identify any trends that can improve your roster. I’ll try to avoid discussing anything overly obvious and stick to that which could provide you with actionable information to help improve your rosters. \nAnything I missed? It’s all being charted, even if it doesn’t make the article. Feel free to get at me on twitter ( @joncollinsFSLR ) or ask in the comments section. \nOne final note: this column uses Pro Football Focus’ ‘thrown at’ data which occasionally differs from a standard ‘target’ count in that it’s charting throws that were truly intended for a receiver, rather than throwaways which may have been aimed in his direction. \n… Onwards. [ Jump to the NFC ] Touches and Targets Week 6: Baltimore Ravens \nI won’t regale you with tales of Steve Smith ‘s toughness, as you’ve heard that all weekend and saw it for yourself against the 49ers. I will note that he went right back to double digit targets, drawing ten and securing seven balls including an impressive 34 yard score. \nKamar Aiken joined him in the endzone, and while his three reception line wasn’t all that exciting, the seven targets he drew are healthy and were the second most on the team after Smith. That fact is relevant in that Baltimore’s secondary is going to necessitate a lot of passing in the second half all season, and, that Smith may fade down the stretch. \nMarlon Brown , meanwhile, saw just three targets while the newly signed Jeremy Ross had five, so, if you’re holding shares of Brown, they can be released. \nCrockett Gillmore split the TE targets with rookie Maxx Williams (three and four, respectively) capping his fantasy value in his return to the lineup. \nIn the ground game, Justin Forsett is starting to get the kind of volume as a receiver that had me so excited about his PPR prospects in the preseason. Despite his questionable status coming in, Forsett had 16 carries and was targeted eight times, securing seven balls. That gives him 12 targets over his last two games. Touches and Targets Week 6: Buffalo Bills LeSean McCoy carried the ball 17 effective times in his return (Photo: Tom Szczerbowski/Getty Images North America). \nLeSean McCoy looked healthy, and ran hard in his return to the lineup, including a 33 yard sprint that featured impressive burst to open the game. All told, he put up 90 yards on 17 carries and added two receptions on three targets. No other back had a carry. That will change when Karlos Williams returns to the lineup, but, in the meantime Dan Herron (two targets, two catches) is playing ahead of Anthony Dixon … so, you can probably release any shares you have of Boobie. \nSammy Watkins asked for the ball and was getting his wish before injuring his ankle. He finished with five targets, four receptions and a score – an impressive catch on a play where Watkins slipped, fell and sustained that injury before lunging to catch the ball in the endzone. His final target numbers, however, pale in comparison to TE Charles Clay (13/9/62) and fall behind Robert Woods , while tied with Chris Hogan . \nBoth Watkins and Harvin are in jeopardy of missing Week 7 in London, which leaves Clay as an enticing PPR play at TE. Touches and Targets Week 6: Cincinnati Bengals \nI’ve already lamented about AJ Green’s target load in our weekly review, noting that a more polished, wiser Andy Dalton with multiple weapons is leading to wise reads of coverage and the ball being distributed to the open man. It’s awful news for Green’s fantasy value. He still leads the team by a wide margin with his 48 targets, and is the unquestioned number one. \nThat said, this week it was Marvin Jones ‘ time to shine. Dalton targeted him 10 times (double Green’s five) and Jones made nine receptions, including an acrobat stretch to push the ball over the goal line and score an impressive receiving TD. Tyler Eifert also scored, on four targets. Mix in a little Mo Sanu (4/2/30) and there wasn’t a lot of work available for Green this week. \nMarvin Jones summed things up quite well with his review of the offense, per PFT : \nIt’s crazy how good our offense is… You never know, game-in and game-out whose turn it’s going to be? \nWith Cincinnati controlling the game flow, Jeremy Hill easily out-touched Giovani Bernard . All told, Hill had 16 carries and a reception while Bernard had eight and one, on two targets. As I’ve noted throughout the year in this space, that is standard and logical operating procedure. Hill is the early down back, and the grinder. When the Bengals are in control, he’s going to run hard up the middle, eat some clock, and gain positive yardage. When the Bengals get down, it’s Bernard time. Gio was more efficient as a ball carrier again this week, picking up 50 yards on his eight opportunities, but, what’s really relevant is game flow. Each back has their role. Touches and Targets Week 6: Cleveland Browns \nRobert Turbin was active for the first time this season and found himself engaged heavily early on. All told, he finished with 10 carries (for 27 yards) which was one more than Duke Johnson and one fewer than Isaiah Crowell . Johnson was the most effective rusher against a tough Bronco front, producing 38 yards on his nine carries and adding four receptions on four targets. Turbin’s even carry split came as a significant surprise, and only further serves to undermine Crowell’s value. At this stage, my only interest is in Johnson who has shown great hands and playmaking ability, but, I wouldn’t be surprised to see Turbin eventually take an even greater share of Crowell’s (rushing for a 3.7 YPC average this year) workload. \nGary Barnidge , Travis Benjamin , Fantasy Stars. That’s the truth. I’ve been on Benjamin since his early contributions with Johnny Manziel , and each week his target load and production continues to justify his use as a WR2/3. Benjamin converted a two point play this week, but otherwise had no huge gainers and didn’t score, and still managed a big fantasy output as a result of his 12 targets, and nine receptions for 117 yards. \nAs for Barnidge, I’ve been a little slow to come around: Gary Barnidge breaks the internet. @joncollinsFSLR hates it! Picked him up WK 3 vs Raiders. 5 TDs and counting \n— Chris Meaney (@chrismeaney) October 18, 2015 \nI’m on board now. He’s been one of Josh McCown ‘s first reads in the red zone and made good with two scores again this week. He caught just three of his nine targets, but, when the receptions are the high value ones in the end zone, they play just fine. I’m still not convinced he’s a TE1 on a regular basis, but, if he continues to see heavy red zone use he’ll certainly have his share of productive weeks, and given how uninspiring the lines are from the back end of TE1 anyhow, I’d rather chance it on Barnidge keeping his scoring streak going than roll with most other options. Touches and Targets Week 6: Denver Broncos \nFinally, the time has come. Ronnie Hillman notched 20 carries this week (adding three catches for four yards on five targets) while CJ Anderson had just 13 carries (though, his 4/4 receiving day yielded a more impressive 25 yard output). Watching the game, Hillman was a greater threat in all scenarios, hitting the hole hard but also getting to the edge and turning up field quickly on outside runs. He’s been the team’s most efficient back in every game so far, and this week the workload finally represented his efforts. With the team likely to retreat further into hide Peyton mode there should be plenty of carries to go around, but, look for Hillman to hold onto his role as the back on the heavier side of the scale. On the note of that hide Peyton concept, it really was another bad outing. The interceptions tell the story, but, Manning missed a number of other open throws high and has not shown the touch on his deep throws to suggest he should be taking those shots (though, he did throw a perfectly placed ball to Emmanuel Sanders for his 75 yard score). Further, he consistently checked down short of the line on third down and looks both inefficient and with shaken confidence. Here’s the thing, though. It hasn’t hurt the production of Sanders and Demaryius Thomas . The team doesn’t have a third receiver or a Tight End it trusts, so, Manning’s production will be driven through his top two receivers who remain WR1s despite his struggles. Thomas had 17 targets (making 10 receptions) while Sanders had 12 (making four). No one else had more than three looks, and no one has more than 27 on the season vs. 74 and 63, respectively. They’re now volume plays more than they are receivers attached to a quality offense, but, the production should continue either way. Touches and Targets Week 6: Houston Texans \nWith all parties available, Chris Polk backed up Arian Foster this week. He didn’t come near Foster’s 23 touches and was used only to spell the starter, but, he did pick up nine touches. Houston’s backfield has been an odd rotation this year, though, so I wouldn’t necessarily take this as a suggestion that Polk is the appropriate handcuff. We’ll need to continue to monitor the workload, as both Jonathan Grimes and Alfred Blue were dinged up coming into the game. Jalen Strong is hardly the focus, but, there’s only so much we can say about DeAndre Hopkins ‘ incredible pace (15/10/148/2TD), so, let’s talk Strong.With Cecil Shorts III back in the lineup (and Nate Washington held out) Strong was active for the second time in his career this week, picking up one target and making one reception. That was two fewer looks than Keith Mumphery and four less than Shorts (5/4/63). Strong has likely done enough to remain active on game day moving forward, but, with Washington returning he’ll be a mere footnote despite a big fantasy number dropped in Week 5 – at least for the time being. Touches and Targets Week 6: Indianapolis Colts \nWhen the Colts weren’t calling the dumbest play in the history of football, they were distributing the ball throughout their offense. \nColts getting ready to raise another banner after tonight’s game (H/T @jmarchandkpaz , @mhenderson95 ) pic.twitter.com/feAzW3FGCD — Darren Rovell (@darrenrovell) October 19, 2015 \nAndre Johnson finished with six targets after his big week against his former team, but, those six looks were five fewer than Donte Moncrief , three less than TY Hilton and just two more than Phillip Dorsett . At best, Johnson is indeed the third option at WR with Moncrief continuing his strong play this week (11/6/69/TD). For all receivers there were a few yards left on the field as Andrew Luck made a few high throws and missed the open man, but, all told this was a productive Indianapolis offense undone by a strong showing from New England and a few poor choices (the faked punt, and the onside kick). Moving forward, that’s promising news after Luck’s slow start to the year and missed time. \nAt TE, five players saw more targets than Dwayne Allen this week. He’s a TD dependent play that hasn’t been scoring and can safely be released in most formats. Put simply, there are too many mouths to feed. \nThat the Colts signed Ahmad Bradshaw this week suggested that they weren’t pleased with the work they were getting from Josh Robinson backing up Frank Gore . That Bradshaw was active after just signing with the team and was the only back besides Gore to touch the ball confirms it. Bradshaw is no threat to Gore – who continues to run well as the season moves along (13-78, 3/2/16 with plenty of yards called back by penalty) but is quickly entrenched as the team’s number two. Touches and Targets Week 6: Jacksonville Jaguars \nWith TJ Yeldon out, Toby Gerhart started for Jacksonville and picked up 12 touches, including three receptions on four targets. Denard Robinson , active for the first time since Week 1 played behind him, and had 10. That could have been a product of him being eased back into the lineup, and Robinson will undoubtedly play ahead of Gerhart when Yeldon is active, but, that workload split states clearly that the team does not view Robinson as a 20 touch back and is no threat to Yeldon as such. \nAfter a slow start to his Jacksonville career in his first game active last week, Julius Thomas was a big part of the game plan in Week 6. He was targeted 13 times and produced seven receptions for 78 yards and a score. That, more or less, was the expected script when the team signed him and it seems safe to assume he’ll draw a lot of looks from Blake Bortles on a regular basis. \nWith those 13 targets sent his way, Allen Robinson was just fine (10 looks, six receptions, 86 yards and a score) but Allen Hurns needed a late score to save his fantasy day (6/2/30/TD). That he found the end zone for the fourth straight game is a great thing, and he won’t be targeted behind slot WR Bryan Walters every week, but, it stood up to the expected script that Hurns was the player to lose some of his work when Thomas was integrated into the offense. Touches and Targets Week 6: Kansas City Chiefs \nJeremy Maclin missed a significant portion of this game with an injury, so, we can’t read too much into the target count in the first game of the post-Charles era, but, his four targets and three receptions left lots of work for others in the receiving corps. Chris Conley was targeted seven times (and made three receptions) which was one more look than Albert Wilson , but, Wilson was relied upon with KC making a late push and he was the one to score the TD as part of a 6/3/57/TD line. \nUnsurprisingly, Travis Kelce led the group with seven looks, five catches and 88 yards. Minnesota was a tough test this week, but it should be noted that Alex Smith threw 37 passes against 18 combined rush attempts and we may notice the team change its identity to a degree moving forward. Make no mistake, they’re going to want to win running the ball, but, the 37 passes were the third most of Smith’s season and the other two totals came in games where the Chiefs trailed significantly. \nAs for those contributing to the 18 carries, Charcandrick West led the group with nine as expected. Knile Davis pitched in with five. Each added a reception, with West’s coming on two targets vs. Davis’ one. That touch count makes sense, and, is a reasonable expectation moving forward as long as the team doesn’t hold West’s lost fumble against him. The matchup was tough this week, and doesn’t get much easier against Pittsburgh in Week 7 but West had the most work, and was the most effective, suggesting that he’ll see the lion’s share of the touches moving forward. \nThere are, however, better Week 7 options. style=\"display:inline-block;width:728px;height:90px\" data-ad-slot=\"1507870491\"> Touches and Targets Week 6: Miami Dolphins \nKenny Stills was announced as the starter in the first game of Dan Campbell’s tenure, but, the targets didn’t shake out any differently than they had under the prior regime. Jarvis Landry had just four, but, was given two first half carries and scored on one of them. \nMeanwhile, Rishard Matthews drew a healthy six targets and caught all of them. I’ve been reticent to trust him as a WR3 all season, but, he’s been a fairly consistent producer for those in deeper pools. Stills, meanwhile, had just two looks. The move was bad news for Davante Parker who was active but didn’t see a target from Ryan Tannehill . \nAt RB, Jonas Gray has formally passed Damien Williams at the back up to Lamar Miller . Miller had a 19 carry, 113 yard outing and is the lead back, but, Gray had seven carries and a reception behind him with Williams netting just a pair of rushes. Touches and Targets Week 6: New England Patriots \nIt would be easy to blame Julian Edelman ‘s finger injury for Danny Amendola ‘s bulk of targets, but, Amendola was involved throughout the game. In fact, it seemed as if he was schemed in at Rob Gronkowski ‘s expense in the first half, rather than taking looks from the similarly skilled Edelman. All told, Edelman held his traditional role a top the team’s target totem pole (10/6/50) but Amendola was consistently involved and put together a 9/7/105 line of his own. \nThat meant less work for everyone else, as noted, with Gronkowski drawing four looks and not making a contribution in the first half, and Keshawn Martin targeted on two deep balls – reeling one in. \nThe heavy use of LeGarrette Blount may have also contributed to the heavy engagement of Amendola, as he posted an average depth of target of 5.8, operating on screen routes that would typically have gone to Lewis had this not been Blount’s time to shine. All told, he finished with 16 carries for 93 yards and a reception on one target. Lewis had just seven touches, his lowest of the season. \nThe moral here, though: Amendola sympathizers shouldn’t get all that excited about his big target load and Lewis investors shouldn’t feel down. This big outing from Blount was an easy one to forecast, given the success that New England’s big backs have had against Indianapolis in recent meetings. I’d expect it to be the Lewis show for most of the game next week against the Jets – no controversy here. Touches and Targets Week 6: New York Jets \nI had a sizable argument on Monday Night around whether or not Chris Ivory was a weekly lock as an RB1, with my opponent suggesting he hasn’t played any quality defenses yet. I think that’s malarkey, but, in any case I think his volume assures that status. Bilal Powell (four carries, one target) barely touched the ball this week coming out of the team’s bye, while Ivory netted 20 carries and three receptions on three targets, totaling 196 yards. His 83 carries through four games place him easily among the league leaders on a per outing basis. \nIn the passing game, Brandon Marshall (9/7/111/TD) continued his own ‘1’ status pace, while Eric Decker found the endzone as well (7/4/57). If you own these guys, you’re trusting them and Fitzpatrick pretty much every week. In other news, though, rookie Devin Smith was active but played sparingly and wasn’t targeted. He’s not the third option just yet. Touches and Targets Week 6: Pittsburgh Steelers \nPerhaps the most surprising outcome from this week’s Steelers game is not Martavis Bryant ‘s big day, or Landry Jones ‘ strong debut, but that Le’Veon Bell didn’t see a single pass target (nor did DeAngelo Williams ). He did have 24 carries for 88 yards, but, the limited passing game use was indeed a surprise. With that in mind, don’t expect it to continue. \nAs for the receivers, Darrius Heyward-Bey wasn’t targeted in Bryant’s return while Markus Wheaton drew just two looks. Both outcomes are expected, and, even when Ben Roethlisberger returns I wouldn’t expect a lot of use for Wheaton. The forecast for the week ahead is a bit murky, given the uncertain QB situation with Big Ben working to get back, but, with Bryant and Jones showing great chemistry in the second half (Bryant’s 80 yards of YAC on his second TD helped the stat line, but, he was still clearly Jones’ favorite receiver) he could be the most valuable Steeler again this week. He and Brown both drew eight looks, mind you, and with anyone but Vick at QB you can expect #84 to be actively engaged. Count on him returning to near-WR1 levels this week, with Bryant possessing great upside as always. Touches and Targets Week 6: San Diego Chargers \nThe Chargers threw the ball all day, and all will against Green Bay. Keenan Allen was the biggest contributor early, essentially playing only the first half and drawing an astonishing 15 targets for 14 receptions and 157 yards. These weren’t softball grabs, either, Allen caught everything thrown his way including an impressive toe tap on the sidelines and a number of contested catches in traffic. This marks his third double digit target/reception game of he season in six tries, while he’s had just 12 catches combined in the other three games. This week’s usage was aided by Steve Johnson ‘s injury, and the up and down makes him a frustrating own… but… Allen is a legit WR1 with both volume and talent accounting for his production. Dontrelle Inman scored a TD and stepped up with the team’s top-2 WRs out in the second half, contributing a 6/3/18 line, while Malcom Floyd saw 12 targets and caught five balls for 95 yards. When your aDot is 20.8, you only need five grabs to be productive. \nStill, San Diego won’t pass so maniacally in every week – that was a special plan for Green Bay and a product of trailing in the game despite Philip Rivers ‘ 500 yards through the air. Those two will have a hard time being regular contributors, particularly with Allen and Johnson healthy. \nAntonio Gates was thrown at 12 times, for nine receptions. Those numbers are going to come down a degree or two as well, but, his are more reliable. He’s been heavily involved in the offense since his activation and is very much back on the TE1 radar. Meanwhile, Ladarius Green got the score at TE but drew just four looks in a game where Philip Rivers put the ball in the air 65 times so he still lives squarely in the can’t trust his workload pile for me. \nBy now, you all know Melvin Gordon was benched for fumbling. What matters more is how the workload is distributed in the week to come – will he regain a role as an early down back? Touches and Targets Week 6: Tennessee Titans \nIn the running game, Antonio Andrews led the backfield with nine carries but that means that no back reached double digit carries. The highest total output for anyone in the rotation this year is 13. Trust no one, is the short answer. The long answer does indeed seem to indicate that Andrews is the best bet to lead the unit in carries each week. Dexter McCluster chipped in with a score and a PPR-friendly 4/3/19 receiving line to go with his five carries. \nAt receiver, the team finally engaged Dorial Green-Beckham as they should a week after he wasn’t targeted at all. In fact, aside from TE Delanie Walker (9/8/97). DGB’s five target, three catch, 57 yard outing came a week after coach Ken Whisenhunt noted that he wants more ‘contested catches’ , something that the big receiver’s frame positions him well to do.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T15:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T20:59:08.460+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
