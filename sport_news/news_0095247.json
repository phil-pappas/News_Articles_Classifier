A 58-yard scamper by quarterback Will Kirkpatrick set up Blake Treisch’s 3-yard touchdown plunge. Both teams combined for 13 plays of 20 or more yards in the contest. \n“We didn’t gear up to stop one kid — we geared up to stop their whole team, but he (Will Kirkpatrick) is a tough kid,” Upper Sandusky coach Chris Rodriguez said. \nUpper Sandusky (3-6, 3-5 N10) clawed back, but couldn’t connect on its first drive, and the Eagles took advantage with another score — this time a 29-yard field goal to claim a 10-0 lead. Moments later a blocked punt gave the Eagles a short field, and they would complete the 17-0 run with a short touchdown run by Kirkpatrick. \nThe Rams pulled back though — big runs by Kolin Holloway and Shane Pack set up Brandon Miller’s 37-yard field goal to trim the deficit to 17-3. They nearly pulled to within a score, but a fourth down pass fell incomplete in the end zone, and the Eagles held a 17-3 lead going into the locker rooms. \nAfter the break, the Rams botched the opening kick gifting the Eagles the ball on the 33-yard line. Six plays later Kirkpatrick found Owen Adams in the end zone from 25 yards out to take command with a 24-3 lead. \n“We have weapons on the edge,” Colonel Crawford coach Ryan Teglovic said, “Will did a good job getting the ball to those guys, and they made big plays for us.” \nThe Rams fought back again with a safety followed by another 37-yard field goal to trim the lead to 24-8. The Eagles and Rams then traded touchdowns and went into the final period with Colonel Crawford leading 31-14. \n“We scored at some key times where the momentum was swinging in the other direction,” Teglovic said. \nIn the final period Crawford looked like it had put the nail in the coffin with Kirpatrick’s fourth touchdown of the night — a seven yard burst. Kirkpatrick finished the game with 189 yards through the air —including a 89-yard bomb to Brock Cotsmire — and 175 yards on the ground to pace the Eagles’ attack. However, the Rams rebounded again with a 27-yard touchdown strike from Jaden Siebeneck to Harrison Sheaffer, but they couldn’t trim the deficit any further and fell 38-20. \n“Our kids are resilient, they’re tough, and they like to fight hard,” Rodriguez said. \nBoth teams continue play next week. Upper Sandusky takes on Western Reserve Academy, and Colonel Crawford travels to Carey. 15 CONNECT 3 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://ohne.ws/1S1N9qV TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T06:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T16:50:44.172+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
