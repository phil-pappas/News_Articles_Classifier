The surprise and delight campaign created by the Atlanta Falcons and Verizon Wireless was launched to spread kindness throughout the Atlanta community.\n“We wanted to do something that was unique and impactful and allowed us to connect with the community,” said Chris Millman, director of community relations for the Atlanta Falcons.\nDuring the season-long program, Verizon Wireless employees and Atlanta Falcons employees, players, cheerleaders and Freddy the Falcon will surprise Atlantans across the city with random acts of kindness at various retail and public locations.\nAtlanta Falcons cheerleaders greet shoppers at a local Publix where the football team and Verizon Wireless suprised shoppers by paying for groceries.

Past events have included welcoming kids back to school at Venetian Elementary School, offering free groceries at Publix, buying lunch at Taco Mac and distributing donuts at Sublime.\nThe bigger goal is to create a positive social movement that begins with these events, encouraging recipients of the surprise-and-delight campaign to “pass it forward.” In turn, by using the power of social media, Atlantans will be encouraged to share their own personal random acts of kindness using the hashtags #VerizonATL and #RiseUp on Facebook and Twitter.\nAnd its working say organizers. Locals are giving back in thoughtful ways such as helping buy gas for someone stranded on the side of the road to babysitting while the parent works a second job.\nAtlanta Falcons’ fullback Patrick DiMarco (left) buys lunch for customers through Pass It Forward, a surprise and delight campaign hosted by the Atlanta Falcons and Verizon Wireless to spread random acts of kindness.

These simple gestures can make such a difference,” added Kate Jay, public relations manager for the Georgia/Alabama region of Verizon Wireless.\nThe Falcons and Verizon have a long-standing relationship of giving back to the community. Verizon collected cell phones at the Washington Redskins game on Oct. 11 for the HopeLine, an exclusive Verizon Wireless equipment recycling program assisting victims of domestic violence. Earlier this spring, the partners also raised money for the Wounded Warrior Project.\nThe Pass It Forward campaign will continue through December.\nIn other news: As part of its 5th annual “Salute Our Troops” campaign, Kangaroo Express donated $55,000 to the Georgia National Guard Family Support Foundation to help support military families in Georgia. From July 8 through Sept. 8, Kangaroo Express invited store guests and communities to demonstrate united support for military personnel and their families by making donations to the Salute Our Troops campaign at its checkout counters. The campaign raised more than $1.5 million, adding to the $10 million that it has already raised.\nWho’s doing good?Each Tuesday, we write about charity events such as fun-runs, volunteer projects and other community gatherings that benefit a good cause.
