I think that we deserved to win, because we created much more chances than Wolfsburg, when you count all the chances.\"\nDaniel Caligiuri put Wolfsburg ahead in the fourth minute, after United right-back Antonio Valencia failed to step up and play him offside, but then conceded the penalty when Mata's cross struck his outstretched hand.\nMata scored the penalty, teed up Smalling's 53rd-minute winner with a delightful improvised flick and proved a constant source of invention, but Van Gaal was reluctant to join in with praise of the Spaniard's display.\n\"I don't speak about individual performances, but I have seen Mata playing better than today,\" he said.\nVan Gaal was more forthcoming with plaudits about Smalling, whose neatly taken goal capped another commanding performance at centre-back.\n\"He played a very good match, especially defensively,\" the United manager told his post-game press conference.\n\"The way he scored the goal was outstanding, especially for a defender and especially for him because he is not doing that so much. Now he has the confidence to do that. I'm very pleased with his performance.\"\nMata revealed after the game that he had replaced Wayne Rooney -- who spooned a glorious first-half chance over the bar -- as first-choice penalty-taker and Van Gaal confirmed that it had been his decision.\n\"I take all the decisions,\" he said when asked by a journalist if he had discussed the matter with Rooney.\n\"I communicate always with my players. Everybody knows that, except you.\"\nWolfsburg coach Dieter Hecking felt that his side were \"unlucky\" to concede the penalty from which Mata equalised and described Smalling's winner -- which stemmed from a mishit shot by Bastian Schweinsteiger -- as a \"shit goal\" to concede.\nHe also made a convincing argument that Morgan Schneiderlin should have been shown a second yellow card for tripping Julian Draxler as the Wolfsburg playmaker bore down on goal late in the game.\nBut with all four teams in the group now level on three points, he is optimistic about his side's chances of reaching the last 16 ahead of a double-header against PSV, who lost 3-2 at CSKA Moscow.\n\"When the draw was made it was clear we could get results against any of the teams,\" Hecking said.\n\"I saw that in Moscow where we dominated and won (1-0). We showed what we could do here against Manchester United.\n\"It comes down to the next two games against PSV, where we can establish the basis for progressing to the next round. But as Louis van Gaal said, you have to win your home games.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T17:16:08.797+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
