It was seriously from zero to 60 in like 30 minutes,” she said. “I was in total shock. It was the craziest thing that I could’ve ever imagined. There it was, me having a baby at Petco Park.” Jaime said she had felt some contractions earlier in the day but thought her labor would progress very slowly, as it did when she had her first son, Grayson. Jankowski Dubs Baby Born at Ballpark Lucky Charm Padres outfielder Travis Jankowski says the baby born at Petco Park on Sept. 24, 2015, may just be the team's good luck charm -- at least his.
