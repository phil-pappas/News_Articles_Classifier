(Photo: Daniel Mears, Detroit News) \nFollow along here with Geoff Robinson for live updates of the Lions-Cardinals game at Ford Field in Detroit.\nAbdullah fumbles as Lions offense gives it up again \nThe Lions looked like they had something going as they crossed midfield into Cardinals territory, but Ameer Abdullah fumbled after a nifty move to avoid a loss on the play, and now the Lions have turned the ball over on their first two possessions of the day. That's not really a good way to put the bad juju that's been surrounding this team to rest.\nStafford picked off \nThe boo-birds are out early at Ford Field as Matt Stafford threw an interception on the opening possession.\nFacing 3rd & 2, Stafford got out of the pocket and appeared to have plenty of room to pick up the first down with his feet. Instead, he tried to force a ball to Tim Wright. Rashad Johnson went up with ease and snatched the ball out of the air to give Arizona possession at the Lions 39.\nLuckily for the Lions, the defense continued its stout play by not allowing the Cardinals to gain a single yard, and the turnover ended up not costing the team any points.\nLions looking for a spark \nThe way last Monday's game in Seattle ended was gut-wrenching for the Lions and the fans, but it's time to focus on Arizona as the Lions will look to avoid an 0-5 start.\nThe offense is still a problem for this team. Put simply, it just hasn't produced. Things won't get any easier today as the Cardinals bring one of the best secondaries in the NFL to Ford Field.\nThe Lions will be missing Eric Ebron due to a knee injury, and Joique Bell is still a no-go. That means it's up to Matt Stafford to get things going with Calvin Johnson and Golden Tate against a ball-hawking secondary. Tate's lack of production this season is especially disturbing. The Lions throw the ball a lot thanks to an anemic run game, so surely there's enough targets to go around to both he and Johnson.\nThis team is running out of time to right the ship, and it's not going to be easy today against a Cardinals team that presents problems on both sides of the ball. A win, however, does seem to be necessary if the Lions want to hold out any hope of playing in the postseason.\nTweets from https://twitter.com/detroitnews/lists/lions-beat", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T19:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T23:33:09.200+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
