He was then transferred to Sunrise Hospital and Medical Center in Las Vegas. \nOwner Dennis Hof said Odom had been at his brothel since Saturday. \nBy Associated Press writer Sally Ho. \nAll content copyright ©2015  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T17:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T17:41:54.869+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
