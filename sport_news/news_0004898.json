Greg Abbott for Monday night's loss against the Kansas City Royals. \nWhen the Astros were leading 6-2 in the eighth inning, Abbott reportedly tweeted his congratulations to the team saying, \"Congrats to the @astros on advancing to the ALCS!. Hoping for an all-Texas #ALCS. Looking at you @Rangers.\" \nAfter the tweet was posted, the Royals ended up winning the game 9-6, and extending the series. \nAbbott's tweet has since been deleted but #AbbottCurse became a trend on Twitter. \nCopyright   Monday, October 12, 2015 at 5:37PM", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T00:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T20:17:51.753+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
