The guy that makes a play on special teams. \nBut he also does the dirty work outside of football. \nFor the past four summers, the 5-foot-10, 180-pound senior worked with the landscaping crew on campus. He’d run with the team at 6 a.m., and then from 7 a.m. to 3 p.m., cut the grass and pull weeds until afternoon workouts at 3:30 p.m. \nBut even after long days under the Alabama summer sun, he’d give it his all. \n“It just makes me grateful for the opportunity. It just taught me to work hard and be disciplined. You have to be disciplined, because after work you feel like just going home and relaxing, but you know you need to get the extra work in to get better,” Hawkins said. “I’d go workout, run routes, run hills, just really try to give my best effort and work as hard as I possibly could just to help the team and better myself. So hopefully I’m able to help the team this week and do the best I can.” \nThe Golden Tigers travel to UNC Pembroke this weekend, and Hawkins’ hard work has helped the team to their first 4-0 start since 2008. \nIt’s also earned him respect from his teammates and coaches. \n“Great leader, but he’s probably a better person. He’s the kind of guy you want representing you. In my opinion, he’s the ultimate student athlete. Makes excellent grades, and he’s the hardest worker on this football team. That’s the kind you want to coach,” coach Willie Slater said. “He’s always under the radar, but when he does make catches, he normally does something with it too. But at the same time, he’s our best blocker. Just the ultimate team player.” \nHawkins doesn’t get a ton of catches, he has three receptions for 56 yards this season. Most of the passes go to guys like Marquel Gardner and Desmond Reece. Most wide receivers get stereotyped as divas or selfish. For a guy like Hawkins, that couldn’t be further from the truth. \n“I just try to do my role to the best of my ability, and when the opportunity comes, just try to make the most of it. So whether it’s blocking, or whether its special teams, whether it’s holding the field goal, just do it the best,” Hawkins said. “I just try to work hard, and when my opportunity comes, try and make a play. I don’t mind ‘sacrificing’ catches to block or open up stuff or Reece and Gardner. That’s just my role.” \nThough soft spoken, his effort hasn’t gone unnoticed by his teammates. Players like quarterback Kevin Lacey would stop by in the summer to give him a Gatorade while he cut the grass. And his effort motivates his teammates to give their all as well. \n“He’s always giving his all. Even when I watch his routes and he’s dog tired, he runs it full speed. It just makes me say, ‘Come on. Hawkins can do it. You can do it. Just keep pushing. Just keep fighting.’ It means a lot,” Lacey said. “You can really look to him for more than on the field. Off the field, he’s a great student, he’s a great person in the community. Even though he’s a part of your team and you’re about the same age, he’s really somebody you look up to.” 88 CONNECT 1 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://on.mgmadv.com/1RjQilu TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T12:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T17:22:50.291+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
