He then wept; kissed a black armband he wore, before being mobbed in solidarity by his teammates.\n\"It was a special moment for me and my family,\" Kouka said a post match interview.\n\"I'm here because of my father. I tried to score a goal for him. He was everything for me,\" the Egyptian star added.\n\"He always helped me. He taught me to be strong. I hope he rests in peace. He deserves it,\" Kouka concluded.\nBraga lead Group F with nine points with Marseille six off the pace.\nKouka opened his account for Braga, whom he joined from Rio Ave in the close season, in a 1-0 victory over Dutch side FC Groningen in their previous Europa League Group F clash on 1 October.\nHe also bagged a brace in Egypt’s 3-0 friendly win over Zambia in Abu Dhabi earlier this month.\nKouka seems favourite to lead the Pharaohs’ frontline in their upcoming World Cup qualifier against Chad next month.\n(For more sports news and updates, follow Ahram Online Sports on Twitter at @AO_Sports and on Facebook at AhramOnlineSports .)", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/AO_Sports", "https://www.facebook.com/AhramOnlineSports?fref=ts"], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T18:19:41.374+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
