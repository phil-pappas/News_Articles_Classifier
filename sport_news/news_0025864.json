Turned out, the crowd was saving one of its loudest ovations for one of the Mets’ most overshadowed players. \n“I think what was going through my mind is that they're cheering because we're still getting to play,” Murphy said. “That is the coolest part.” \nMaybe that’s true, or maybe it’s just a deflection by 30-year-old who’s used to saying the right things while letting others stand in the spotlight. \nMurphy bats third, right in between the captain David Wright and the mercenary Yoenis Cespedes. He’s a homegrown standout, but he’s not part of the high-profile pitching staff. There was a time this season when it seemed the Mets might trade him before he becomes a free agent at the end of the year. \nIn the postseason, though, Murphy has become the Mets’ offensive superstar. He homered four times in the Mets’ first six playoff games. After hitting one home run off a left-handed pitcher in the regular season, he’s hit two off Clayton Kershaw and one off Jon Lester in the playoffs. \n“Sometimes on this team you can get overshadowed by all the stars that are here,” Mets manager Terry Collins said. “In the past when Jose (Reyes) and Carlos (Beltran) and Johan (Santana) and David (Wright), I mean, there’s been a host of guys that have come through here, and Dan Murphy has been that one steady guy that you look up (and realize) he plays hard. He’s always coming through for you. He learned how to play second. He’s done a good job. You put him at first, he never says a word. He’s a baseball player. I’m not surprised at anything that he does.” \nA free agent at the end of the year, Murphy’s future with the Mets is uncertain, but his present has become one of the breakout performances of the postseason. \n“I don’t think this is a phase for him,” general manager Sandy Alderson said. “I think that in some ways he’s a fundamentally different hitter than he was as recently as three, four months ago.” \nThat different approach, Murphy said, started after some mid-season work with hitting coach Kevin Long. In the final two months of the season, Murphy hit .296 and slugged .533 including four home runs and 11 extra-base hits during one 13-game stretch at the end of September. \n“We really starting hunting pitches in the middle of the plate in,” Murphy said. “That was the biggest thing that we did. I started getting, I think, a little more aggressive, so we’ve kind of talked and found out, what are my strengths and what are my weaknesses. He really helped me to play as much as I could to one of my biggest strengths, I think, which is that I don’t swing and miss a lot. So if I can get a good pitch to hit, there’s a good chance I should be able to hit it hard.” \nMurphy turns 31 on April 1. If this is his last stint in Queens, he’s leaving a lasting impression. \n“He's a baseball junkie,” Collins said. “You know, when you spend as much time as I have in the game, you love those guys. So that's why I love being around Dan, because it's about playing the game.” 1 CONNECT 2 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://lohud.us/1RQpLwu TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T02:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T04:05:40.438+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
