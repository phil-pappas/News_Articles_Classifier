Then, they capitalized on Maryland’s shortcomings. Undefeated Northwestern has stuffed Stanford and Duke, QB Clayton Thorson’s improving rapidly, this is Pat Fitzgerald’s best defense — and ’Cats have three years of agonizing fourth-quarter losses to avenge. Vastly overrated Jim Harbaugh goes down. Go, ’Cats, for one unit.\nSunday Browns (+7) over RAVENS: Fabled home-field advantage might yield shaky win, but covering this caliber of number’s unlikely since Ravens are running on fumes. After being handed a gift by Mike Tomlin, John Harbaugh’s troops stumble on without Terrell Suggs (the soul of the defense) and Steve Smith (the spark of the offense). Josh McCown gets the ball to Travis Benjamin and Duke Johnson, the stout Browns offensive and defensive lines do their jobs, and you have another AFC North meatgrinder. Cleveland rocks, for one unit.\nLast week: 2-0\nSeason: 9-2\nTo contact Cat about his comprehensive advisory service, write P.O.
