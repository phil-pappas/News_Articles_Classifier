Rebilas-USA TODAY Sports Dodgers pitchers Clayton Kershaw, right, and Zack Greinke could feasibly finish 1-2 in the NL Cy Young voting this season. Unlike the American League, where the Toronto Blue Jays seem to be this year’s team of destiny, the National League is wide open as the playoff are set to begin. A strong case can be made for each of the five teams that have made it to the postseason in the NL. So with that in mind, let’s make a case for each NL playoff team, and give three reasons each one of them could win it all.\nAdChoices Los Angeles Dodgers\nReason one: The Kershaw-Greinke combo\nThe Los Angeles Dodgers have the best 1-2 starting pitcher combination in the MLB since Randy Johnson and Curt Schilling were pitching for the Arizona Diamondbacks. Clayton Kershaw and Zack Greinke have been utterly dominant this season. Kershaw became the first pitcher in over a decade to strike out over 300 batters, and Greinke may win the NL Cy Young, as he went 19-3 and led the MLB in ERA and WHIP (1.66 and 0.84, respectively). Just as Johnson and Schilling did for the D-backs back in 2001, the Dodgers could feasibly ride Kershaw and Greinke to the World Series. Throw in the fact that the Dodgers' NLDS opponent is the red-hot New York Mets, and they will truly need Kershaw and Greinke to be at their best.\nReason two: The emergence of Corey Seager\nSince calling up top prospect Corey Seager in early September, the young shortstop has had his way in the majors. Seager hit .337 with four home runs and 17 RBI in 27 games for the Dodgers to end the season. More important, however, unlike teammate Joc Pedersen, major league pitchers haven’t seen enough of Seager yet to figure out the best way to approach him at the plate. Expect the 21-year-old Seager to play a major role in the Dodgers' postseason run, as he could be the spark at the plate this team needs.\nReason three: Defense\nThe Dodgers were the best defensive team in the NL this season. They committed the fewest errors, and had the highest fielding percentage out of every NL team. Adrian Gonzalez is a Gold Glove player at first base, Joc Pedersen (despite his struggles at the plate) is an excellent defensive center fielder, and both A.J. Ellis And Yasmani Grandal are high-quality catchers. For that matter, even Kershaw and Greinke are great fielders for their position. If the Dodgers fail to make a deep postseason run this October, it won’t be because of their defense.\n© Jeff Roberson/AP Photo Cardinals catcher Yadier Molina throws during practice on Wednesday in St. Louis. Molina has been out since Sept. 20 with a partially torn ligament in his left thumb but expects to play in Friday's NLDS opener. St. Louis Cardinals\nReason One: The Cardinals are the best team in baseball\nWith a record of 100-62, the St. Louis Cardinals were by far the best team in the majors this season. That consistency goes a long way towards playoff success. If winning is a habit, the Cardinals have become masters at it over the past few years, and are all the more dangerous for it.\nReason Two: Experience\nThe St. Louis Cardinals are becoming baseball’s version of the San Antonio Spurs; they always seem to make the playoffs. The Cardinals have appeared in the World Series four times since 2003, winning twice. Now led by manager Mike Matheny, catcher Yadier Molina, and an always superb pitching staff, the Cards are a threat to win the World Series every year. Unlike their NLDS opponents, the Cubs, playoff baseball isn’t new territory for the Cardinals; rather, it’s home for them.\nReason three: The return of Adam Wainwright\nAlthough pitcher Carlos Martinez has been shut down for the year, the Cards should be receiving ample reinforcement in the form of star pitcher Adam Wainwright. Wainwright was believed to be lost for the season in April after he tore his Achilles tendon, but miraculously, he has rehabbed his way back onto the Cardinals' pitching staff. A three-time All-Star, Wainwright has 82 2/3 innings in the postseason for his career, and coming out of the bullpen should back up a Cardinals rotation that already boasts Michael Wacha, Lance Lynn and John Lackey. The return of Wainwright could tip the scales in the Cardinals' favor.\n© Kathy Willens/AP Photo After missing most of the season due to a back injury, Mets star David Wright hit .299 for the month of September. New York Mets\nReason one: Starting Pitching\nOut of every team contending in the NL, the New York Mets have the most reliable and trustworthy four-man rotation. Jacob deGrom established himself as a legitimate number one this season, going 14-8 with an ERA of 2.54 and WHIP of 0.98. Behind deGrom, the Mets have Matt Harvey and Noah Syndergaard. Although both pitchers have struggled at times this season, both of them are capable of throwing a shutout on any given night. The Dodgers, New York's NLDS opponent, have struggled tremendously to score runs against quality pitchers this season. Additionally, Mets manager Terry Collins will have the choice of starting either Bartolo Colon or Steven Matz in Game 4, allowing deGrom to get as much rest as possible for a potential and decisive Game 5.\nReason two: David Wright is back and healthy\nThe heartbeat of this Mets ballclub is seven-time All-Star third baseman David Wright. After missing the majority of the regular season due to a back injury, Wright is now back in the Mets lineup and looking like his old self again. Wright batted .299 for the month of September with an OPS of .879, and has been solid defensively along the third-base line since his return. The Mets were able to win the NL East largely without the services of one of their best players. Now Wright is back, and is playing best baseball of the season at just the right time.\nReason three: Momentum\nSince acquiring outfielder Yoenis Cespedes from the Detroit Tigers at the trade deadline, the Mets have gone 37-22. While the Blue Jays' move to nab David Price will likely go down as best trade of the year, the Mets' acquisition of Cespedes, and the winning ways that followed, would have to be considered a close second. Simply put, since the start of August the Mets have been playing great baseball, and this team, along with the city behind them, has the look of a team that believes it can make a deep postseason run.\n© Getty Images Chicago Cubs\nReason one: Starting pitching\nAs great as Kershaw and Greinke have been for the Dodgers, Jake Arrieta has actually been even better for the Chicago Cubs. Arrieta won 22 games for the Cubs and has had an ERA below 0.50 since the start of August. He even threw a no-hitter against the Dodgers earlier in the season. The point is, Arrieta is the best pitcher in baseball right now, and when you throw in the fact that Cubs boast a two-time World Series champ in Jon Lester as their number two starter, you can see begin to see how this might be the Cubs' year.\nReason two: Joe Maddon\nThe Cubs forked over $25 million (plus incentives) to bring in the ethereal Joe Maddon as their manager this season, and the move is already paying off. There isn’t a manager in all of baseball who gets his players to believe in themselves quite like Maddon, and his off-beat personality seems to be a perfect fit with the Cubs franchise. Now getting ready to face the St. Louis Cardinals in the NLDS, no other manager is better at getting his players mentally prepared for the postseason than Maddon.\nReason three: The Cubs are due\nThe Cubs have not won a World Series since 1908. You would think at some point the team might just be able to luck into one. They nearly did it in 2003, but then Steve Bartman happened. Luckily for Cubs fans, Bartman won’t be attending any Cubs playoff games, and a team can only have so much bad luck for so long. If the Red Sox can break the curse of the Bambino, then the Cubs can break the curse of the Billy Goat.\nIn reality, any one of these four teams could win the NL pennant. They all posted similar records, have similar strengths and weaknesses, have great managers, and have comparable levels of talent on their roster. Much will change between now and the end of October, but for now, there is a strong case to be made for each of these teams to make it to the World Series.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T14:31:57.684+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
