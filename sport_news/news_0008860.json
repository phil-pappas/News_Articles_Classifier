Just like every class before them though. The seniors, we try to teach them how to lead and let them go with it. But they've just been remarkable because they don't have a lot of people around them. It's only two of them. We were concerned that maybe with a huge junior class, the two seniors wouldn't be able to lead. But they've just done a fantastic job.\" \nThe lack of size in the senior class doesn't bother Guetzlaff much. \n\"I don't think it's really that difficult,\" Guetzlaff said. \"I think it's easier to lead because it's only two people making a decision versus a big group making a decision. So it's easier for us to compromise than a big group.\" \nThe two seniors made an impact on Senior Night as the Trojans beat Whitehall 5-0 on Wednesday night. \nGuetzlaff got the Trojans on the board with a penalty kick midway through the second half. \nShe and Allsop also were able to help the Trojans record their 14th straight shutout. \nAllsop recorded three saves, including a big one against Kylee Cunningham with 2:15 left in the first half. \n\"It was awesome,\" Allsop said of the night. \"The atmosphere was incredible, having all our families and friends out here to support. Definitely always a good win against Whitehall and I couldn't be happier with the team I've had this year to get this win on my Senior Night.\" \n\"It was really a good atmosphere,\" Guetzlaff said. \"We were really pumped up to play. I think after we got the first goal, it really helped us play with a better passion and to get more pumped up.\" \nParkland will play either Stroudsburg or Pleasant Valley in the first round of the Eastern Pennsylvania Conference tournament on Saturday. \n\"We just got to stay motivated,\" said Allsop, who is a captain along with Guetzlaff and Rachel Medlar. \"Work hard at practices all the time. Play feet and play our game and it should take care of itself.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T12:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T02:52:05.462+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
