The hosts were leading the standings by four points, and need just one more win to secure the title for a record fifth time in a row. But Luneng's veteran striker Han Peng would ruin the planned celebration with a very late goal. It's undoubtedly the most important week of the season for Luiz Felipe Scolari's Evergrande after reaching the AFC Champions League final following a second leg 0-0 draw at Gamba Osaka on Wednesday, and the chance to claim the CSL title with a win here over Shandong.The hosts have a dream start off a brilliant through ball from Zheng Zhi springs Ricardo Goulart who nets his 18th goal of the season in the 6th minute. Amazing pass from Zheng and Goulart shows his finishing touch and then goes on to lead the Brazil internationals in showing off some pretty fancy dance moves. But Shandong find the equaliser on the hour mark â€“ Argentine star Walter Montillo's brilliant free kick gives Zeng Cheng little chance and it's 1-all. Luneng are fighting with Beijing Guoan for a spot at next season's AFC Champions League. And the pinpoint strike from Montillo helps them to that end. Guangzhou restore their lead 15 minutes later, thanks to Elkeson's individual effort. The second half substitute beats two defenders in the area before slotting the ball past Chinese international Wang Dalei.While many players would have cried for the foul, Elkeson takes care of business himself to make it 2-1 Evergrande.However, Guangzhou have to play the final ten minutes with one man down when their full back Zhang Linpeng receives his second yellow card for tackling Yang Xu from behind.With Evergrande just two minutes away from celebrating their domestic title at home, they concede another goal. Wang Yongpo is totally unmarked at far post while substitute Han Peng is only needed for a tap-in on the goal line to give Shandong the equaliser in the fourth of five-minute stoppage time. \nGuangzhou players believe it is offside but the referees don't agree. Elkeson could have scored in the final action of the match, but his header is denied by the crossbar.It finishes 2-2. Guangzhou now need at least a draw in the final league game to secure the title when they visit Beijing Guoan on Saturday. \nAlso on Sunday, Beijing Guoan visited Tianjin Teda. The hosts were in desperate need of three points to avoid relegation. Zhou Hanbin would stand out in the 55th minute, when Hernan Barcos' shot accidently goes to him and the Chinese international delivers. One nil, Tianjin. The hosts are at it again in the 67th minute, when Brazilian international Wagner beats the defenders with his speed and scores. 2-nil Tianjin.In the 75th minute, Nie Tao would make it 3-nil for Teda with a beautiful shot. 4-nil is the final. Tianjin get 3 precious points and Guoan may lose next season's AFC Champions League berth with the defeat.
