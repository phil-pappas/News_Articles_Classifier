It won't be there unless you live in the Buffalo and Jacksonville markets (even if you Sunday Ticket). The game between the 3-3 Bills and the 1-5 Jaguars is the first to be offered exclusively online to those outside the competing markets. Yahoo! paid a reported $20 million for the rights to live stream the game (on both Yahoo.com and Tumblr) across the world in an event the NFL and the advertising world will be monitoring closely. If Yahoo! gets the kind of viewership it hopes, live streaming could become a fixture in NFL broadcasting. Next year, the Thursday night slate of games CBS is currently broadcasting is up for grabs and Yahoo! or someone else could purchase the rights if the payoff is good enough. According to Adweek, Yahoo! sold out all of its advertising, but one report said it had to lower its ad rates drastically to do so. Still, the broadcast will be available to more than 1 billion monthly users. One positive feature of the broadcast is that there will be 7 to 8 fewer minutes of advertising than a traditional game. That should appeal to most viewers. The 90 minutes of pregame will be heavy on fantasy football with experts conducting a live chat. Kevin Harlan and Rich Gannon will handle the play-by-play. If you happen to catch the game, feel free to let the rest of us know how it went.\nON DECK Five teams in the NFL are still undefeated: Carolina (5-0), Cincinnati (6-0), Denver (6-0), Green Bay (6-0) and New England (5-0). And three of them — the Bengals, Broncos and Packers — have the weekend off. The five unbeatens are the most after six weeks of the season since 1970, and with the Panthers hosting Philadelphia and the Patriots hosting the New York Jets, there's a decent chance the record will be stretched to seven weeks. The high number of unbeatens can mean two things: There are a lot of really bad teams or most every one else is middling. The latter appears to be the case. Consider in the AFC that the only teams other than the Bengals, Broncos and Patriots that are above .500 are the Jets (5-1) and Pittsburgh Steelers (4-2). In the NFC, the only teams above .500 besides the Panthers and Packers are Atlanta (5-1), Arizona (4-2) and Minnesota (3-2). That means 22 teams are at .500 or worse. So if you're watching Cleveland at St. Louis, Oakland at San Diego or Dallas at the New York Giants, you may very well be watching a playoff team. It's turning out to be that kind of season.\nNORTHERN EXPOSURE Heading into their bye, the Packers have a 2&frac12;-game lead on the Vikings, four-game lead on Chicago (2-4) and five-game lead on Detroit (1-5). It's safe to say the Vikings are the only team with a chance of catching the Packers. The Vikings' next four opponents, starting with the Lions at Ford Field on Sunday, are all under .500. They could be 7-2 when they host the Packers on Nov. 22. The Packers play at the 6-0 Broncos and at the 5-0 Panthers in back-to-back games upon their return from the bye and could have two losses by the time they meet the Vikings. The key will be the Vikings showing they're a true contender. The Bears head into their bye week having won two of their last three, losing in overtime to Detroit a week ago. Cutting defensive tackle Jeremiah Ratliff after an incident at Halas Hall robs them of talent but probably helps their locker room. The Lions, meanwhile, finally have a victory under their belt and will be welcoming four starters back from injury: defensive tackle Haloti Ngata, running back Joique Bell, safety James Ihedigbo and tight end Eric Ebron. Can they win two straight? Stay tuned.\nGAME OF THE WEEK New York Jets (5-1) at New England Patriots (6-0)\nWhen: Noon Sunday (CBS).\nKey injuries: Jets — RB Bilal Powell (ankle) is out; S Jaiquawn Jarrett (knee) is doubtful; G Willie Colon (knee) is questionable. Patriots — T Marcus Cannon (toe), LB Rufus Johnson (illness) and DE Jabaal Sheard (ankle) are out; DE Trey Flowers (shoulder, knee), LB Dont'a Hightower (ribs), G Josh Kline (shoulder), RB Dion Lewis (abdomen), G Shaquille Mason (knee) and WR Matt Slater (knee) are questionable.\nPlayer to watch: Jets running back Chris Ivory is the first Jet to rush for 140 or more yards in back-to-back games since Freeman McNeil in 1985.\nRecent history: New England has won eight of the last nine regular-season meetings but swept the Jets last year by a combined margin of three points.\nKey statistic: The Patriots have the best division record (25-6) in the NFL since 2010.\nBottom line: The Patriots have the NFL's highest-scoring offense at 36.6 points per game. The Jets have the NFL's best scoring defense at 15.0 points per game. The Patriots have the No. 2 offense in total yards at 422.4. The Jets have the No. 1 defense in total yards allowed at 269.2. The Patriots have the No. 2 passing offense at 325.2 and the Jets have the No. 1 rushing offense at 146.0. If ever there were two really good teams that were polar opposites, this is it. The Jets' pass defense, which features former Patriots cornerback Darrelle Revis, is loaded at the coverage positions. In addition to Revis, Antonio Cromartie and Buster Skrine are top-notch cover men who will be able to hold their own in man coverage. The Jets will be able to double-cover tight end Rob Gronkowski much of the day even with wide receiver Brandon LaFell adding to quarterback Tom Brady's options for the Patriots. The key to the game probably will be the performance of Jets quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick, whose modest 83.4 passer rating is all you need to know about the passing game.\nBY THE NUMBERS PACKERS 8-1 Coach Mike McCarthy's record after the bye, tied with Marv Levy for the best in NFL history among those with at least eight games.\nPlus-57 Margin by which Green Bay has outscored its opponent in the first quarter this season, best in the NFL.\n20 Highest the passing offense has been ranked this season.\n4 Games in which kickoff returner Ty Montgomery has had one or fewer attempts.\n7 Halves in which the offense has scored a touchdown on its opening drive.\nNFC NORTH 12 Touchdowns Minnesota Vikings RB Adrian Peterson has scored in 13 career games against the Detroit Lions.\n19.8 Rushing attempts per game the Lions are averaging, second-fewest in the NFL.\n110.3 Opponent passer rating the Lions are allowing, highest in the NFL.\n3 Division teams that have missed an extra point (Vikings, Lions, Bears).\n9 Interceptions Lions QB Matthew Stafford has thrown, one fewer than Aaron Rodgers (2), Teddy Bridgewater (4) and Jay Cutler (4) combined.\nNFL 0 Rushing touchdowns the Jacksonville Jaguars have scored, the only team in the NFL without one.\n675 Passing attempts San Diego QB Philip Rivers is on pace for. It would be the fourth-most in NFL history.\n130.1 New England QB Tom Brady's passer rating at home this season.\n23 Pass breakups Buffalo CBs Stephon Gilmore (12) and Ronald Darby (11) have, the top two totals in the NFL this season.\n1,936 Receiving yards Houston's DeAndre Hopkins is on pace to gain, which would be 28 shy of Calvin Johnson's all-time single-season record.\n ", "external_links": ["http://analytics.apnewsregistry.com/analytics/v2/image.svc/JSI/RWS/jsonline.com/CAI/336743591/E/prod/PC/Basic/AT/A"], "published": "2015-10-25T12:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T13:43:34.930+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
