(AP) — Wake Forest guard Codi Miller-McIntyre will miss 4-6 weeks with a broken foot. \nCoach Danny Manning said Monday that Miller-McIntyre had surgery on his foot during the weekend, but did not specify which foot. \nMiller-McIntyre averaged a team-best 14.5 points last season while starting all 32 games. The senior has missed just two games during his college career — one as a freshman and another as a sophomore. \nWake Forest begins the season Nov. 13 at home against Maryland-Baltimore County.
