He added that the rate in some areas is “as high as 60 percent.”\nDeLoach’s numbers echo the language on the Step Up Savannah website, which prominently mentions the current 26 percent poverty rate and includes this line: “While more than a quarter of Savannah’s residents live in poverty, that percentage jumps to 50 percent and higher in some neighborhoods. Such high rates have persisted for more than 30 years.”\nThe data are more nuanced than suggested by those quotations from DeLoach and from Step Up Savannah, but the general point seems sound. We have a high rate of poverty in Savannah — well over 20 percent — and much of the city’s poverty is concentrated in specific neighborhoods.\nChildren who live in poverty often have parents who also grew up in impoverished families. It’s a tough cycle to break.\nBut I’m not writing this column to quibble with Eddie DeLoach’s broadly accurate characterization of poverty in Savannah. I was prompted to do a little digging after Mayor Edna Jackson directly challenged DeLoach’s numbers.\n“We’re talking about poverty here like poverty just came to Savannah,” Jackson scoffed.\nThat didn’t seem a fair characterization at all of the comments that had just been made by DeLoach and by Murray Silver. Poverty may finally be a major campaign issue, but no one has been arguing that we have all just become aware of poverty.\n“Your figures are wrong,” Jackson told DeLoach. “Before the recession, the poverty rate in Savannah had dropped tremendously to about 17 percent, but because of the recession, poverty levels have gone back up. And I admit it is too high.”\nObviously, such a sharp disagreement warrants a closer look at the poverty estimates, as well as consideration of the policy ramifications.\nSo what do the numbers say?\nAccording to U.S. Census estimates, Savannah’s poverty rate in 1980 was 22.4 percent. By 2000, the rate had declined slightly to 21.8 percent. Over those same 20 years, Georgia’s poverty rate declined from 16.6 percent to 13 percent. In other words, during the late 20th century, statewide poverty was clearly declining, but Savannah’s poverty rate barely budged.\nThe 2010 data showed a sharp increase in poverty. Savannah’s poverty rate jumped from 21.8 percent in 2000 to 25.1 percent in 2010, while the state’s rate went from 13 percent in 2000 to 17.9 percent in 2010.\nKeep in mind that the so-called “great recession” ended in summer of 2009, but jobs were still being lost for many months after the recession.\nSome sectors have still not recovered all the jobs that were shed in the wake of the downturn, and we’ve also seen a very slow recovery in wages.\nAnd keep in mind that many Savannah workers live in households that fall below the poverty line. As of 2010, according to numbers available through Step Up Savannah, the average annual wage for retail employees in Chatham County was $25,012. The average annual wage for jobs in accommodation and food services was $16,224.\nThe U.S. Census is now producing five-year poverty estimates through the American Community Survey. The most recent estimate is that 26 percent of Savannahians were living below the poverty line between 2009 and 2013. That number is actually down slightly from the 2008-2012 estimate of 26.6 percent, although it is still significantly higher than the 23.8 percent poverty rate from 2006 to 2010.\nSo did Savannah’s poverty rate decline “tremendously” before the recession, as Mayor Jackson said? Well, it all depends on the definition of “tremendously.” I could find no numbers confirming that the rate ever fell as low as 17 percent, although it seems safe to say the rate might have dropped to around 20 percent after 2000.\nJackson is correct that the poverty rate rose during the recession, but the trend lines suggest that our current poverty rate is probably close to 25 percent even though the recession ended six years ago.\nIn simpler terms, Savannah’s poverty rate in 2015 is higher than it was in 1980.\nMany powerful people in Savannah, including the members of the current city administration, seem to think such grim numbers will remain the norm. That belief limits policy options. We can boost the economy in any way possible so that some money trickles down and we can provide services that ensure basic needs are met, but we aren’t going to make much of a long-term dent in the poverty rate.\nMany likely voters in next month’s election are not ready to throw in the towel and accept that our poverty rate must remain so high. That position demands more ambitious policies designed to break the cycle of entrenched inter-generational poverty.\nCity Talk appears every Tuesday and Sunday.
