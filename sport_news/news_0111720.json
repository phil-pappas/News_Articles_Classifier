Person, who was upgraded to full participation in Thursday's practice, also is expected to start on Sunday. \nQuinn said there was no limitation for Durant or Person on Friday. \n\"It was awesome having everybody available, practicing full,\" Quinn said. \"I can't remember the last time that happened. For us to have that opportunity was really great.\" \nWide receiver Julio Jones, who has been a regular on the injury list this season, has been fully cleared all week for the first time since Week 1. \nAtlanta's players had three straight days off following their Thursday night loss at New Orleans on Oct. 15. That helped some of the injured players accelerate their recoveries, and that momentum continued through the practice week. \n\"The thing I've been encouraged by is how hard guys have worked to get back,\" Quinn said. \"When they have gotten banged up, it's 'How fast can I work to get back out there with the guys?' That's appreciated on lots of levels, from the team to the coaching staff through the training staff and all the way through.\" \nHankerson said he began thinking in the middle of the week it might be possible to have all players on the active roster available for the game at Tennessee. \n\"The trainers and coaches have been putting us in the right position to take care of our bodies, and it's going well,\" Hankerson said. \nQuinn said he has not decided if linebacker Phillip Wheeler, who signed on Tuesday, will play this week. \"I was impressed by the week, I'll tell you that,\" Quinn said. \nAP NFL website: http://www.pro32.ap.org and AP NFL Twitter feed: http://www.twitter.com/AP_NFL \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T21:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T22:04:20.344+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
