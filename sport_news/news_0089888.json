It was the Breaux Bridge offense looking like it was putting on one of its best performances of the season. \nIn a game that featured a pounding rushing attack, Tigers sophomore QB Julien Leon also took to the air on a couple of incredible passing plays as BBHS rolled up a 30-8 victory over the home standing Wildcats. \nAfter Izrael Ledet set the Tigers offense up in Abbeville territory on a great punt return, Malik Leblanc capped off a short drive with a 3-yard rushing touchdown to give the Tigers a 7-0 lead with :58 in the 1st Quarter. \nAfter an interception set them up in Wildcat territory once again, the Tigers offense scored its second touchdown with 9:04 left in the 2nd Quarter on a sensational pass from Leon to Daniel Lee from 20 yards out – a pass that showed great touch on the ball as well as location. The extra point was missed. \nA Bailey Thibodeaux field goal pushed the Breaux Bridge lead to 16-0 at the half. \nIn the second half, the Tigers offense took its opening drive and displayed a great mix of the run with the pass. Lee capped the drive off by taking Leon’s bubble pass and outmaneuvering his way around the Abbeville defense, juking defenders and reversing his field for a 23-yard touchdown to give the Tigers a 23-0 lead with 8:34 left in the 3rd Quarter. \nThat score would hold until 9:03 left in the 4th Quarter as Matthew Johnson would get the Wildcats on the board with a 1-yard touchdown plunge. The 2-point conversion would cut the deficit to 23-8. \nBut that was as close as the score would get as the Tigers took the ensuing possession and put the game away. Daniel Lee took the handoff and followed his two fullbacks up the middle for a 30-yard touchdown run, his third scoring play of the night. \nWith the victory, Breaux Bridge improves to 4-3, 1-1 on the season. With the loss, Abbeville falls to 3-4, 0-2 on the season.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T06:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T08:20:16.773+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
