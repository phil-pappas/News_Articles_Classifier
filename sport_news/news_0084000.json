HILLSDALE – The regular season is history, and the selection process is done - now it all comes down to the players on the field and the coaches on the sidelines in Michigan high school football - both in 11 and 8-man play in the MHSAA post-season. And it all begins on Friday, when the Hornets of Hillsdale make the trip to Buchanan, to take on the state-ranked Bucks, while Waldron High School will make school history as the Spartans host their very first ever MHSAA playoff football game, with Lawrence coming to town, and Pittsford also has the luxury of home-field advantage, meeting a familiar foe in Colon. HiLLSDALE HORNETS 'A football coach's work is never done …' as Hornet head coach Mark Lemerand was already hard at it on Sunday night. \"I was just watching films of them (Buchanan) and from what I've seen they have a quarterback who can throw the ball all over the place, and have several guys who can catch it. And they look to have a big and physical line, so it's going to be a real challenge for us.\" It's the 15th straight season that the Hornets have taken part in the MHSAA post-season. Meanwhile, Buchanan last play-off appearance was 2012, but the Bucks have made the play-offs six times since 2004. \"Just a casual observation is that they have some athletes,\" Lemerand said. Lemerand expects multiple looks from the Bucks on offense. \"They spread things put even more than we do,\" Lemerand said. \"Plus it looks like they have a power runner so it's going to be tough for our defense.\" \"We'll have to be disciplined on defense and make our reads and we can't afford to make any mistakes,\" Lemerand added. \"Defensively, they offer a couple of different fronts, with a couple of big guys inside, and they rest of them just run to the football,\" Lemerand said. In the latest Associated Press poll, Buchanan was No. 8 in Division 5. Hillsdale is 6-3 coming off a 35-0 win over Hudson \"When it comes down to the playoffs, it's comes down to execution,\" Lemerand said. The veteran Hornet coach added. \"We have to play disciplined football, limit our turnovers, and special teams play is always important in post-season.\" PITTSFORD WILDCATS Mission accomplished - one of the two main goals that the Wildcats of Pittsford set for themselves this season was to make the MHSAA post-season. However, the Wildcats got an additional bonus. \"We're happy that we've got another home game,\" Pittsford head football coach Mike Burger said. \"That's the really exciting thing, both for our players and our fans. Especially for our seniors - another chance to play on our home field. You figure you were done and then you get a chance that not everyone gets. Then luck of the draw.\" Page 2 of 2 - And the Wildcats play host to a Colon team that they defeated 27-8 on the road on Sept. 25. Of the rematch and the familiarity, Burger said. \"I don't know if it's a negative or a positive. Who knows. It's a new new season and whoever prepares and plays well will win. \"They run a lot of split back, triple option, veer-option and have a very good quarterback in Dan Alva and have a couple of very fast (running)backs,\" Burger said. \"On defense, against a triple-option our kids have to be sure of their reads and not make mistakes,\" Burger added. \"We have to think - use our heads. \"We also have to show them more than just one option on offense. We know they well key on Matt Rogers so we have to come up with some other options. We have to sustain drives.\" Pittsford is 6-3, coming off a 46-7 win over North Adams, and Colon is also 6-3. WALDRON SPARTANS Of the Spartans hosting a play-off game, head coach Mark Long said. \"It's big for our school, our community and our kids. This is something that they have been talking about ever since they were freshmen; a personal goal and now it's come true. \"And anytime you get home field advantage it's big,\" Long added. Lawrence is a defending state champion, Long said of the 7-2 Tigers. \"They have lost to two good teams, St. Philip and a Wisconsin team that's won 17 or 18 straight.\" Long said of the Tigers offense. \"They want to spread out your defensively from side to side. And have a quarterback who can throw the ball and is athletic.\" On defense 3-4, angle well, and a lot of man-to-man coverage, according to Long. And it's all about ball control, Long said. \"We have to mange the football game. Limit turnovers, and we have to control things and keep their offesne of the field. They want to do things quickly, run no huddle.\" Waldron is 8-1 coming off a 52-12 win over Carsonville. It's the fourth straight season the Spartans have made the post-season.
