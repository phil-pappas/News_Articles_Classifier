Special photo by William Lofton slideshow CANTON — Lalo Pena’s 38-yard field goal sailed through the uprights as time expired, completing a comeback that left Sequoyah’s home crowd stunned and gave Creekview a dramatic 38-35 win over its archrival Friday at Skip Pope Stadium.Sequoyah (2-5, 2-2) scored with 4:34 left in the third quarter to take a 35-7 lead in the Region 7 (A) game, but Creekview (5-3, 4-1) scored the game’s final 31 points.It was the fourth time in the teams’ eight meetings — and the third straight year — that the game was decided by three points or less.“Our guys didn’t have any quit in them (Friday),” Creekview coach Terry Crowder said. “We fell behind pretty bad for a while, but our defense came up huge for us. We kept telling them we were just one play away from getting back into it, and they proved that (Friday). It’s the kind of win you can really build off of.”With the win, Creekview was able to keep pace with Dalton for the subregion lead. However, the Grizzlies’ only hope for winning the subregion rest on Dalton being upset by Woodland next week, since the Catamounts own a potential tiebreaker.Sequoyah’s loss dropped it into a three-way tie with Cass and Rome for third place in the subregion, and the final opportunity to play for a state playoff berth Nov. 6.Friday’s comeback began with quarterback Kyle Wilkie finding Brian Davis for a 2-yard score, and Trevor Kolb from 13 out in the third quarter. Andy Davis’ 1-yard touchdown run brought the Grizzlies within a score with 4:30 left in the game, and Wyatt Hepburn’s 45-yard interception return on the Sequoyah’s ensuing drive knotted the game at 35-all.After Creekview was forced to punt, Sequoyah had the ball at its own 24 with 6 seconds to play. Instead of playing for overtime, the Chiefs tried for a big play, but quarterback Austin Tracy was intercepted by Terry Williams, and the ball was returned to the 21.Pena made his field goal on the next play.“We wanted to throw a safe pass to the short side,” Sequoyah coach James Teter said. “They’re kids, and they make mistakes. We’ll learn from it and get back at it next week.”The Chiefs jumped out to their lead by taking advantage of some early Creekview miscues. Derrion Rakestraw intercepted two first-half passes, and the Chiefs blocked a punt to set the offense up in good field position.Running back Trey Mitchell was the primary beneficiary of that field position, as the senior scored three short touchdowns while rushing for 126 yards on 23 carries. Cameron Gales also played a big role with 57 yards on 13 carries.Tracy finished with 156 yards on 10-of-23 passing with one touchdown and two interceptions. He also carried the ball three times for 35 yards, including a 25-yard touchdown run in the first quarter.“We just need to learn to hold a lead,” Teter said. “We got up big, and we tried to get more conservative. Obviously, that didn’t work out too well for us.”While the Sequoyah offense got conservative late, Creekview found its stride in the second half. After completing just seven of 21 passes for 99 yards, a touchdown and two interceptions through the first two quarters, Wilkie was 16-of-23 for 110 yards, two touchdowns and no interceptions the rest of the way.Even once the comeback began, Sequoyah did not give up anything easily through the air, sacking Wilkie five times. Freshman Cade Radam picked up the slack though, rushing for 111 of his 153 yards in the second half. Radam also caught six passes for 64 yards.“I’ve always said, if people want to stop the pass, we can run it,” Crowder said. “Cade played fantastic (Friday) picking up the slack. For a freshman to come in and have that kind of impact, it was awesome.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T10:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T14:17:35.314+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
