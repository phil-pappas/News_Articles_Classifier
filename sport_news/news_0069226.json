His combined total of 35 goals and assists is a league record.\nThe five-foot-four 135-pound forward has one goal in 21 appearances for the Italian national team.\nItaly travels to Azerbaijan on Oct. 10 before hosting Norway on Oct. 13 in Rome. Italy currently leads Group H with 18 points, two ahead of Norway.\nGiovinco would likely just miss one game with Toronto FC. The MLS club has a bye next week and doesn't play again until Oct. 14, when it hosts the New York Red Bulls.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T17:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T05:05:47.036+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
