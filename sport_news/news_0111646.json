We had total contract value wins of close to $1 billion that is the largest ever... we have had great progress. However, it is still early in our journey, we are making great progress on our ‘new and renew’ strategy. All in all, it is a good and encouraging quarter,” said Infosys CEO and MD Vishal Sikka.
