Sometimes I think of mistakes that I made years ago that I still feel embarrassed — and even shame over. What can I do about this?\nEmbarrassed in Colorado\nDear Embarrassed: View your mistakes as valuable teachers. If you think about it, some of your greatest lessons have come from your mistakes. You have a temper outburst, and because of that your boss fires you — and that teaches you what you can and cannot do in the world. It's how we grow, how we gain wisdom and maturity, how we acquire a better understanding of the way the world works, and it teaches us how we can and cannot behave. Mistakes give us feedback. Every one tells us what we need to learn, change or reconsider.\nWith every misstep or error that you make, ask yourself \"What is the lesson in this mistake? What can this teach me?\" And do not let your past mistakes stop you from going after what you dream of. Feel the fear or the embarrassment or the anxiety — and then go after making your goals and dreams come true. Nothing will heal the sting from a mistake faster than going out and doing things right the next time. This is how we learn to do things better. It's how we learned when we were young, and it's how we learn as adults.\nYou may be doing far more right than wrong, so don't be so focused on your errors, faults, miscalculations or slips of the tongue that you lose sight of the larger picture that is your life. We all make mistakes — sometimes huge mistakes — but that doesn't mean that we aren't worthwhile, lovable, worthy of trust, worthy of benefit of the doubt and worthy of another chance.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T20:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T14:14:14.656+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
