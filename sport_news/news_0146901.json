Mark Gonzales Contact Reporter Chicago Tribune Dexter Fowler and Kyle Schwarber assist Jake Arrieta in leading the Cubs to a tense 4-0 win over the Pirates \nWith the hottest pitcher in baseball representing his greatest weapon, manager Joe Maddon believed he needed only early run support to add another chapter to the Cubs' remarkable season. \nMaddon tweaked the Cubs' lineup, but it was mainstays Dexter Fowler and rookie Kyle Schwarber who delivered the offense for a 4-0 victory Wednesday night in a manner that stunned Pirates fans and heightened the dreams of long-suffering Cubs fans. \nFowler went 3-for-3 with a home run off Pirates ace Gerrit Cole and Schwarber displayed the talents of a skilled veteran with an RBI single and two-run homer. \nThat was plenty for Jake Arrieta, who continued his mastery by extending his scoreless streak to 31 innings with a four-hit shutout to eliminate the Pirates in the National League wild-card game. He struck out 11 while throwing 113 pitches. \nBefore the Cubs left for St. Louis to start their best-of-five NL division series against the Central champion and longtime rival Cardinals, they left an emotional scar on the Pirates. \nWith two out in the seventh, Arrieta — who led the majors with 22 victories during the regular season and was 16-1 with an 0.86 ERA over his final 20 starts, was hit on a first-pitch fastball from reliever Tony Watson. Arrieta took a few steps toward first before steering toward the mound, where Watson and catcher Francisco Cervelli moved toward Arrieta.

(WGN-TV) \nThe benches emptied, with Sean Rodriguez, who was lifted for a pinch-hitter in the third inning, sprinting toward Arrieta to start a bench-clearing scrum to the right of home plate. Rodriguez was ejected, and Arrieta rubbed salt in the Pirates' wounds when he stole second base on the first pitch without attracting a throw. \nThis marked the Cubs' first postseason victory since Game 4 of the 2003 NL Championship Series, and Maddon couldn't have scripted the triumph any better, thanks to the heroics of Fowler and Schwarber. \nFowler led off the game with a single, stole second and scored on Schwarber's opposite-field single to left. \nIn the third, Fowler pulled a single to right and raised his fist as he watched Schwarber crank a pitch over the right field stands to extend the Cubs' lead to 3-0. Fowler then added insurance with a homer to right-center in the fifth. \nMaddon opted for a lineup that included left-handed hitter Tommy La Stella batting fifth and starting at third base for only the seventh time to take advantage of his ability to put the ball in play. The agile Bryant moved to left field, with Schwarber moving to right — where he never had started until Friday in Milwaukee. \nLa Stella went 0-for-2, but it was Maddon's scripted defensive changes that paid off. The 6-foot-5 Bryant moved from left to third after five innings and reached quickly to bobble but catch Gregory Polanco's line drive in the sixth. In the seventh, Bryant made a backhanded stop of an Aramis Ramirez grounder to start an inning-ending double play. \nThrough the first five innings, Arrieta dominated the Pirates, throwing his fastball more frequently than he did in two starts against them last month. \nThe Pirates finally put a runner in scoring position in the sixth and loaded the bases before rookie shortstop Addison Russell atoned for an error when he started an inning-ending double play that prompted Arrieta to pump his fist. \nThe Cubs won four of their final seven games against the Pirates during the regular season.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T07:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T07:33:41.435+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
