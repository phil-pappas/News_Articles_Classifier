(I still have no idea what was said, but \"caring\" seems unlikely.) \nOf course there was an Elsa, and probably my favorite was \"Book Girl — because I love reading books,\" for whom I did a silent little jig and felt my hope for the human race had been at least partially restored. \nLittle Roy has decided she would like to be a fox, inspired by a winter hat she already has. (See Item No. 2 below: already following in her mother's footsteps.) \nLittlest Roy, who tends to be fickle, at first decided on Winnie the Pooh, then switched to Piglet, then changed her mind and decided she, too, would like to be a fox. \nI guess there's no telling what a fox would do to a Piglet, so it's probably better that way. \nI figured we could probably go the \"stick-some-faux-fur-on-a-pair-of-sweats, make-a-tail-and-call-it-a-night\" route, but I checked out a couple costume websites just to be safe. \nMy search confirmed two things: First, that I don't need to spend $40 for an outfit that will only be worn for a couple hours; secondly, that I still don't understand how you can put the word \"sexy\" in front of anything and call it a Halloween costume. \nEnd of rant. \nI know it seems early, but especially if you're hoping to make a DIY Halloween costume this year, I figured I'd give you a heads-up on ways to save. And for those of you not inclined to head out for tricks or treats, I've included some universal frugal principles that you, too, can apply. \n1. It's OK to buy a cheap costume ... if you're only going to wear it a couple times and you'd spend less than you will making your own — but make sure you check the items below first. \nThere are a variety of Halloween costumes you can buy at Walmart, for example, that cost between $10 and $15. I realize that the quality of said costumes isn't what you'd get from your local seamstress, but they only need to last through a class party and trip around the neighborhood, so it's at least worth considering. \nUniversal application: Everyone has things they're picky about, but let's think about \"one-time-use\" items like paper products. Of course the best thing is to avoid using them at all — use rags instead of paper towels, for example, or real dishes instead of disposable — but clearly 8-ply toilet paper and Chinet paper plates will cost you more in the long run than store-brand wax-coated paper plates — or if you're feeling particularly skimpy, the non-coated kind that I buy and reinforce plastic plate holders. \n2. Make it with items you already have. Case in point: my elementary school skunk costume, a pair of black sweats to which my mom affixed a faux fleece stripe and tail stuffed with newspaper. Simple, comfortable, warm, unique — everything a practical second-grader could ask for in a Halloween costume, and budget-friendly for Mom; my brother, likewise, once dressed up as a robot using a spray painted cardboard box. \nUniversal application: That oft-repeated tenet of frugal living: \"Make do with what you have.\" Whether that means repurposing some picture frames by painting them; spicing up your living room by moving around furniture (instead of buying a new piece); using cardboard boxes instead of buying a bunch of storage totes; if you spend time thinking before making a purchase, you may be able to save yourself a good chunk of change — that you can then use for 8-ply toilet paper, if that's your thing. \n3. Make it with items you can reuse. The skunk costume just barely surpasses my Laura Ingalls Wilder costume, a calico dress sewn by mom, complete with petticoat, a borrowed sunbonnet and boots I used to wear with my stirrup pants. ...Yeah, I was that kid. \nSince I went through a major Little House on the Prairie phase, the dress was worn to church many Sundays and now is a relic in Little and Littlest Roys' dress-up box. \nHad I not been so attached to the skunk costume that I wore it at least another year or two, we could probably have recycled the sweatshirt; the pants I could wear anytime. \nUniversal application: As I mentioned in Item No. 1, rags are better than paper towels and real dishes are better than disposable. Newspaper can be reused as mulch in your garden; cereal boxes can be cut to serve as paper and coloring book holders. Anything that can be given a second — or third, or tenth, or hundredth — life is better than something that will end up in the trash. \n4. Try secondhand. Check out eBay, your local consignment store and your circle of friends. The great thing about Halloween costumes is that you're likely to find a gem that has only been worn once or twice \nUniversal application: You're intelligent, so I don't need to spell this out. Anytime you can get something secondhand — with, of course, a few exceptions — why not save the money, as long as it's in good shape? \nTrick-or-treaters, I think that's enough to get you started. Non-costumed set: See? There's always something to learn. Happy planning, and if you're one of those people with an irrational fear of clowns — don't worry, I've met plenty of friendly ones. \nIf you have insight about a frugal living topic or an idea for a future column, please email me at amroy@nncogannett.com . I'd love to hear from you! \nHappy saving, 3 CONNECT 2 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://ohne.ws/1LboAqa More Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T14:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T01:20:42.493+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
