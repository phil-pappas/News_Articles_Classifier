(AP) — LSU's live mascot, Mike VI, won't make any more appearances in Tiger Stadium this football season, the university announced Saturday.\nThe tiger will remain in his 15,000-square-foot habitat on game days, said Ginger Guttner, spokeswoman for the LSU School of Veterinary Medicine.\nFans can see Mike in the habitat, which is next door to the stadium.\nThe 10-year-old tiger is in good health but hasn't wanted to get in his trailer, Guttner said.\n\"He's fine,\" Guttner told The Associated Press.\nBut, at 450 pounds, the predator gets to make his own decision about staying or going.\nTigers are not motivated by food, so getting him into the trailer is not as simple as tossing in a steak and hoping he'll follow it, she said.\n\"Mike's safety and well-being is the most important thing,\" Guttner said.\nMike is the only tiger that lives on a college campus in the U.S., Guttner said. He attended the first LSU game this year. He didn't go to any games in 2014.\nA photo posted to Mike's Facebook page Friday showed him eating \"Gator tartare\" — a meaty concoction laid on the floor in the shape of the Florida mascot.\nNo. 6 LSU plays No. 8 Florida on Saturday in Baton Rouge.\nAdvertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T18:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T02:34:51.776+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
