Teddy Bridgewater played like he had the Chiefs defense on his fantasy football team. The Vikings offensive line will spend the week drinking tea infused with honey and lemon to ease throats sore from yelling “Look out!’’\nThe Vikings on Sunday played poorly enough to lose to a bad team, poorly enough that TCF Bank Stadium almost became home to a Red Wedding Weekend, with Nebraska trouncing the Gophers on Saturday and Kansas City falling one fourth-quarter touchdown drive short of winning.\nOn a day both offenses looked like they were driving into a hurricane wind, Stefon Diggs saved the day. The Vikings’ rookie receiver made his first NFL start and caught seven passes for 129 yards. In his first two NFL games, Diggs has produced 13 catches for 216 yards, prompting his teammates to speak of him in terms usually reserved for stars, not fifth-round draft picks.\n“He’s polished,’’ veteran cornerback Terence Newman said. “Runs good routes. Quick as a hiccup. Very smooth. When I first got here I was like, ‘Hey, who is this kid?’ I was impressed with him from Day 1.\n“If he keeps his head on straight and keeps doing what he’s doing, he’ll be one to watch. Potential Hall of Famer, down the road.’’\nFellow veteran corner Captain Munnerlyn nodded emphatically. “He’s so special,’’ Munnerlyn said. “He’s one of the most polished receivers I’ve ever seen come out of college. I’m glad he dropped into our hands. I feel like we got the steal of the draft. Great routes, great hands, works hard, great attitude.’’ Minnesota Vikings wide receiver Stefon Diggs (14) runs with the ball during the first half of an NFL football game against the Kansas City Chiefs, Sunday, Oct. 18, 2015, in Minneapolis.\nNFL defensive backs are the foremost finger-waggers and trash-talkers in pro sports. They know they may never get to celebrate in an end zone, so they act out all over the field. They are the last people to give credit to a young receiver, unless they believe that guy can help them win.\n“Diggs is one of those guys,’’ cornerback Trae Waynes said, “who if you’re going half-speed, he’s still going 100 percent.’’\n“You never know how things are going to go on Sundays, but day in and day out, that’s what we’ve been seeing,’’ said safety Harrison Smith. “He’s an explosive player with great hands, but for me what’s most impressive is his understanding of the game. He knows how to get that good separation. He’s incredibly well-rounded for such a young player.’’\n“He’s really crafty, really smooth on his routes, runs tremendous routes,’’ cornerback Xavier Rhodes said. “He’s going to be a great receiver.’’\nAdrian Peterson called Diggs “a game-changer,’’ noting that Diggs’ hands are almost as big as Peterson’s famously powerful bear claws.\nThe Vikings have been looking for a star receiver since they traded Randy Moss in 2005. Since then they have tried out Troy Williamson, Bernard Berrian, Marcus Robinson, Travis Taylor, Sidney Rice, Bobby Wade, Percy Harvin, Jerome Simpson, Greg Jennings, Cordarrelle Patterson, Charles Johnson and Mike Wallace as potential No. 1s. In two games, Diggs has indicated he might be the one.\nHe spent last season at Maryland studying under coach Keenan McCardell, the former Jaguars receiver, who was known as an undersized technician.\n“It’s how you study,’’ Diggs said. “Some people just look. There’s different angles of film. You see how people’s bodies are and how they react to certain plays — their hands, their feet, little things.’’\nDiggs has the quickness to get away from defenders at the line of scrimmage. He has the football sense to find openings in the defense. He has hands that enable him to catch the ball well away from his body. He has footwork that enables his precise route-running and elusiveness after the catch.\nYou don’t get the sense, standing next to him, that he’s a future star wide receiver. He’s slender, and humble. He also might be the player the Vikings have been looking for since they drafted Williamson.\n“It’s hard being a young guy,’’ Diggs said. “It’s hard earning your stripes. Once I earn that trust, I’m going to keep it.’’\nJim Souhan’s podcast can be heard at MalePatternPodcasts.com .
