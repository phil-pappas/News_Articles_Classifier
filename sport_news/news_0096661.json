But now that they have it, is it a case of being careful what you ask for?\nProvinces and cities will need to come up with much more cash themselves to participate in the Liberal government’s plan to double the spending on roads, bridges, public transit, social housing and other forms of infrastructure during the next 10 years.\nThe formula for participating in the program isn’t known, but the usual system requires each level of government to contribute one-third of the cost of a project. Many federal programs provide less than a third of total funding.\nCities across Canada are struggling financially, but it will be tough for them to turn down cash gifts from Ottawa, even if they are expected to participate as equal partners, as if their financial resources are equal.\nThe additional borrowing will force Winnipeg to increase its debt ceiling, which in turn will hike debt-serving costs while reducing funds needed for other services.\nIn fact, the city needs to raise its debt ceiling just to come up with its share of the cash for the Waverley underpass. Any further borrowing could lower its credit rating, which would automatically increase interest rates on debt, leading to a vicious cycle for civic finances.\nOther major cities are in the same boat, or worse. They want additional federal infrastructure money, but paying their share won’t be easy, or without consequences for their bottom lines.\nThey will have to go into debt, raise taxes or cut services to afford the whopping $125 billion coming their way under the Liberal infrastructure plan.\nSome of that money will be earmarked for provinces to spend on highways, flood protection, or whatever, but a good chunk will be available for municipalities. Public transit, for example, has been identified as a priority.\nThe province faces the same dilemma as the city, but it is much better positioned to manage the increase in spending. Premier Greg Selinger, for example, said one reason he raised the PST by one percentage point was so the province could participate in federal cost-sharing programs.\nThe province raises about $300 million a year by increasing the PST. In comparison, a one per cent increase in property taxes earns the city just $5 million.\nSome city councillors are wondering if the city will be able to afford to participate in the new, expanded infrastructure program.\nThe city really has no choice, however, since turning down the federal gift horse would be politically disastrous for Mayor Brian Bowman.\nCities may wish to lobby Ottawa for direct funding without strings on smaller projects, or ask their provinces to pick up a larger share of the tab. Large projects, however, such as Winnipeg’s ambitious plan for bus rapid transit, will require partnerships between the three levels of government. That’s because it is unreasonable and impractical to expect Ottawa to pick up the entire tab for Winnipeg’s rapid transit system.\nAfter whining for increased federal infrastructure money, cities will simply have to find a way to come up with their share of the cash, or drop plans for ambitious megaprojects.\nThe dilemma illustrates once again why cities need a new deal that would increase their political and financial self-sufficiency, particularly in an age where cities are the prime drivers of the economy.\nIt’s another reason why Mr. Bowman must step up his plan to push for more diversified revenues and taxing powers. Otherwise, the focus on big projects will compromise the rest of the balance sheet and reduce spending on the smaller amenities the public also needs.\nA city with rapid transit and freeways, but shuttered libraries and swimming pools, is not a city that works.\nEditorials are the consensus view of the Winnipeg Free Press’ editorial board composed of Catherine Mitchell, David O’Brien, Shannon Sampert, and Paul Samyn.\nReport Error Submit a Tip Refund Refund", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T01:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T03:04:02.801+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
