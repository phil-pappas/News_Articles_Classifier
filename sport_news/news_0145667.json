A report indicates that Williams got into altercations at a bar on Saturday. (USA Today Sports) \nWhile the first five weeks of the college football season have provided plenty of drama and surprises, the attrition among some of the game's most talented individual players has been staggering and has cast a shadow over the action on the field. \nMost of it has been unfortunate injury luck among high-profile players, from Notre Dame quarterback Malik Zaire to UCLA linebacker Myles Jack to Pitt running back James Conner to BYU quarterback Taysom Hill to West Virginia safety Karl Joseph, who suffered a season-ending injury in practice this week . \nSome of it, however, has been self-inflicted. On Monday, Auburn dismissed senior wide receiver D'haquille \"Duke\" Williams. Coach Gus Malzahn did not provide a specific reason, but AL.com did. \n\"When individuals fail to meet the expectations of our program, there has to be consequences,\" Malzahn said in a statement. \"I gave D'haquille the chance to prove himself. I am disappointed that it did not work out.\" \nOn Wednesday, AL.com reported that , according to a witness, Williams punched four people at a local bar after Auburn's 35-21 win over San Jose State on Saturday. \nThis is not the first time that Williams has been in trouble. A touted junior college transfer, Williams caught 45 passes for 730 yards and five touchdowns in his debut season for the Tigers in 2014. He returned for his senior season as Auburn's top receiver with Sammie Coates gone, and he was widely expected to become one of the nation's top receivers and a possible early draft pick. \nBut not much has gone right since the beginning of the year. He was suspended from the Outback Bowl after a violation of team rules, and he missed several days of fall camp because of \"discipline issues.\" With Auburn struggling in the first month of the season , Williams caught just 12 passes for 147 yards and a touchdown. The expected connection between Williams and new quarterback Jeremy Johnson fizzled, with redshirt freshman Sean White taking over for Johnson after three games. \nWilliams wasn't the only SEC receiver dismissed form his team this week. Tennessee senior Pig Howard was let go by Tennessee on Wednesday because of a violation of team rules. Howard has previously been suspended for the team's opener and also missed the last two games because of injuries. After catching 98 passes over the last two seasons, Howard had only one catch for eight yards before his dismissal. \nWith Williams and Howard gone, one well-known wide receiver has returned to action. Amid a tumultuous season for the team a whole , star Rutgers senior Leonte Carroo has been reinstated after an assault charge was dropped. Carroo was suspended for the first half of the first game of the season for an unrelated issue, then was suspended indefinitely after an altercation outside the stadium following Rutgers' Sept. 12 loss to Washington State. Carroo was arrested and charged with simple assault under domestic violence, but the charge was dismissed on Tuesday. \nWilliams and Carroo were both listed among Sports on Earth's top wide receivers entering the season in June after both returned for their senior seasons. The perception of both going forward has changed drastically over the last two months. \n* * *", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-07T21:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T02:50:10.061+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
