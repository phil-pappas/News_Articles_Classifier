With that goal unattainable, Ridder made it clear he wanted his players to close things out the right way. \nThe Indians took his words to heart. \nSenior Blake Bialas tossed four touchdown passes, three of them coming on fourth downs, and Camanche’s defense held strong when it had to in order to preserve the Indians’ lead. When Will Bentley’s conversion attempt to tie fell by the wayside, Camanche had sent its seniors off with a victory, edging the Wildcats 34-32 on Friday night at Durant High School. \n“We believed in the kids,” Ridder said. “They believed they could make one play, and they showed that tonight. It’s a credit to those seniors. It hasn’t been easy for them, and it hasn’t been easy for a lot of these kids. \n“It’s a big win for those kids. I told them how resilient they were, and after a night like this, I think they’re starting to believe that they are resilient. They’re continually able to bounce back after being kicked and kicked. We did it tonight, and I’m so proud of them.” \nNobody showed more resiliency for the Indians (2-7) than Bialas, who shook off a first-half interception to make sure Camanche kept responding when necessary and kept Durant (1-8) from taking the momentum. \nThe final pass of his high school career, a 10-yard touchdown strike to Dylan Dodson on a fourth down that extended the Indians’ lead to 34-26, proved especially crucial. \n“Blake came out and was ready to play, and he had a key interception on defense as well,” said Ridder, whose squad was on the wrong end of a 43-0 defeat to the Wildcats a season ago. “He made some great reads and found Will Seeser down the middle a few times. (Durant) made some good adjustments that stopped that for us, but we kept believing, we kept fighting and this time we were on the right side of things.” \nBialas finished with 214 yards through the air, finding Seeser for two scores and hitting Dodson and Ethan Schaffer for his second-half scores after the Wildcats stepped up their defense on Seeser. \nCamanche’s largest offensive output of the season proved to be just enough to allow its defense to hold on in the face of Durant’s ground tandem of Gavin Blake and Brandon Dykes. Along with setting up Bentley’s aerial assault of three touchdown passes, the duo also proved to be a combination that the Indians never managed to stop. \nBlake rushed for 130 yards and a score, while Dykes added 84 rushing yards and a 19-yard receiving touchdown with 1:44 left that sliced the Indians’ margin to 34-32, forcing Camanche to come up with one more play on the conversion to preserve the victory. \nBut after spending most of the game on their heels, the Indians dug in when it mattered most, closing off Bentley’s lane to the end zone and stopping him a yard short of the conversion. \nDurant had one final chance when it recovered the ensuing onside kick, but the officials ruled that the Wildcats had touched the ball before it traveled the necessary 10 yards, handing the ball back to the Indians and allowing them to finally exhale. \nCAMANCHE 34, DURANT 32 \nCamanche 14 7 7 6 — 34 \nDurant 6 14 0 12 — 32 \nC — Will Seeser 3 run (Tristan Connell kick), 7:12 \nD — Gavin Blake 3 run (pass failed) \nC — Seeser 53 pass from Blake Bialas (Connell kick), 2:52 \nD — Jacob Conley 10 pass from Will Bentley (Bentley pass to Brandon Dykes), 8:10 \nD — Mason Compton 39 pass from Bentley (pass failed), 2:42 \nC — Seeser 22 pass from Bialas (Connell kick), 0:42 \nC — Ethan Schaffer 10 pass from Bialas (Connell kick), 8:59 \nD — Bentley 2 run (pass failed), 8:27 \nC — Dylan Dodson 10 pass from Bialas (kick failed), 2:44 \nD — Dykes 19 pass from Bentley (run failed), 1:43 \nINDIVIDUAL STATISTICS \nRushing — Camanche, Blake Bialas 10-31, Will Seeser 7-6, Alex Babcock 8-8, Kolby Snodgrass 2-1; Durant, Gavin Blake 26-130, Brandon Dykes 12-84, Tanner Kleppe 7-15, Noah Cawiezell 2-27, Will Bentley 7-9. \nPassing — Camanche, Blake Bialas 12-20-214-4-1; Durant, Will Bentley 9-12-144-3-1. \nReceiving — Camanche, Will Seeser 5-121, Jacob Pulse 1-37, Ethan Schaffer 3-23, Dylan Dodson 3-33; Durant, Mason Compton 3-65, Brandon Dykes 3-46, Jacob Conley 2-27, Gavin Blake 1-8.
