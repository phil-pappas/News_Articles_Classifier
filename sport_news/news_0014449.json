Only one Schuylerville girls' soccer player proclaimed herself a goal-scorer to the new coach. It was a group focused on the middle of the field and defense.\nThere have been net gains, though. A Black Horses team with speed and depth managed more than enough offense, and they thrived enough in the Foothills Council to be a dark horse postseason candidate when Section II tournament play gets under way this week.\n\"At any given game, we will start 7-8 sophomores. My team is very committed, tenacious and eager to learn tactics and formations,\" Kopp said. \"I am fortunate to be able to sub liberally and never see a dip in quality of play.\"\nDuring one midseason stretch, Schuylerville surrendered just two goals in seven games — a run of about 400 scoreless minutes. There were nine shutouts this year and 12 second halves without giving up a goal.\nSchuylerville has been one of the more charming Section II stories of the season. South Glens Falls and Queensbury have been the traditional favorites in the North division. And South Glens Falls did win both meetings by a combined three goals — it won the league, too — but the Black Horses had a win and a draw against Queensbury. They also lost just 2-1 Oct. 5 at state-ranked (and undefeated) Scotia-Glenville. It was one of only two games Scotia had decided by a goal.\nThe Horses went 10-3-2, scoring 40 goals and allowing 12 heading into the Class B sectionals. That's not bad for a rookie coach with a unique background.\nThis is Kopp's second year at the high school level. He coached the boys' junior varsity at Stillwater last year.\n\"You could tell his enthusiasm for the game itself from the first 10 seconds of when we talked about the job,\" Schuylerville athletic director Heath Morris said. \"He's a very passionate person. And he explains things to the girls in a way that makes sense ... and same with everyone else around.\"\nMorris credited his new coach for meeting future players on their club teams during the summer, along with their parents.\nThe 49-year-old has the time. He retired six years ago from the corporate credit-card world. He sold a 6-year-old transactions business and moved from Florida back to upstate New York.\nThese days are hardly so buttoned-up. He runs six study-hall periods at the high school and also patrols a few lunch hours.\nThat keeps him work-sharp, he said, and allows him to get to know his team off the field. The native Long Islander first fell in love with the area while playing at SUNY Oneonta, when it was a Division I program.\nKopp also played one year professionally in the USISL. One of his requirements that season in Tennessee was to coach a youth team, he said.\nThe former forward smiles when noting his old soccer friends \"can't believe\" Kopp has built a team on defense.\nWatch them, though, and it's like watching the Syracuse basketball team's famed zone defense — cohesiveness and trust are constantly in play.\n\"We have a lot of speed and just good team anticipation,\" Kopp said. \"Fierce tackling, too. They tackle hard and tackle clean. We rarely get called for fouls.\"\nAnd there's another reason teams can't find the goal: Sara Baker .\nThe 5-foot-7 senior also sports a stars-and-stripes jersey and bandana.\n\"I just love America,\" she said.\nBaker said the beginning of the season was tough, because new roles were being sorted out.\n\"Everyone was nervous, and that made me nervous,\" she said.\nThe season took a dramatic turn Sept. 15 when Schuylerville beat Queensbury, 1-0.\nSection II's all-time leading scorer, Brittany LaPlant, failed to score despite 10 shots. Queensbury's coach, Jason Tenner , said that was historic.\nBaker made a few phenomenal saves (among an 88 percent rate this year). Defenders also helped create low-percentage angles.\n\"They all trust each other,\" Gloversville coach Mike Hallenbeck said. \"They have a great goalie, read angles well, anticipate well. It looks like they've been playing together for a while.\"\nHaving that defense allows Kopp to continue building offense around sophomore striker Emily Vallee .\nAmy Moreau (another sophomore and also a captain) \"can change a game within seconds,\" Kopp said.\nKopp is animated on the sidelines, but seemingly never negative. Concepts like quick switches, movement off the ball and playing it to open space are what he harps on daily. He praises his team for playing a style that \"is appealing to the eye.\"\n\"Sometimes I'm trying to teach, in my mind, the college-level dynamics of fitness to 10th-graders,\" he said. \"And I forget that sometimes. But it's awesome when it works.\"\nJason Franchuk is a freelance writer.", "external_links": ["http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/47/55/8813417/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/47/55/8813414/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/47/55/8813415/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/47/55/8813416/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/47/55/8813416/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/47/55/8813415/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/47/55/8813417/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/47/55/8813414/3/920x920.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-19T06:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T13:30:14.302+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
