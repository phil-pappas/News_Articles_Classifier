(Tribune News Service) — For nearly two years, Josh Peyton's goal was to get back the use of his right hand. After nearly losing the hand in a vehicle rollover in 2011 while deployed in Iraq, the company commander with the 4th Brigade Combat Team, 82nd Airborne Division was stuck at Walter Reed Army Medical Center, spending each day trying to inch back toward normalcy. Well, that and win hot dogs. During his time at Walter Reed, he became part of a regular golf group made up of fellow wounded soldiers. Usually playing at the nearby Argyle Country Club, they'd square off in matches with the losers buying the winners hot dogs. Being the driven group that soldiers usually are, the matches got intense. \"If you won that hot dog, you'd definitely let everyone know it,\" Peyton said. But those rounds proved to be about more than just an outlet for competitive urges. Peyton described them as a four-hour escape from the reality of their situation. The soldiers didn't have to talk about war. They didn't have to talk about their injuries. They were bonded by shared experience, but that wasn't why they were there. Now retired, Peyton, 38, has made it his mission to spread that kind of camaraderie. In January, he launched the Veteran Golfers Association . The organization is based out of Southern Pines, where Peyton settled thanks to many years stationed at Fort Bragg. It aims to help all military veterans stay active and connected through the game. \"There wasn't an organization that catered specifically to veterans,\" Peyton said. \"I felt like if we put that organization together, it would help a lot of people.\" Now with around 700 members, Peyton said it's open to members of all branches of the military, active duty or retired. \"If you've ever raised your right hand to serve our country, you're eligible to participate in the Veteran Golfers Association,\" Peyton said. And next month, the fledgling organization will hold its showcase event. After months of qualifiers, the VGA National Championship will take place in Pinehurst on Nov. 8-11. Held over Veterans Day weekend, the event features the VGA National Championship on Pinehurst No. 2, the Wounded Veteran Open on Pinehurst No. 5, a concert by country star Colt Ford and a screening of Black Hawk Down with an appearance by actor Tom Sizemore. Information on the event can be found at vgachampionship.org . Peyton said that seeing the event become a reality has been satisfying. But with plans for a series of tournaments coming next year and a constant search for members, volunteers and sponsors, the work isn't finished. But he's undaunted, fueled by the desire to give other veterans the kind of escape that kept him going. ©2015 The Fayetteville Observer (Fayetteville, N.C.)
