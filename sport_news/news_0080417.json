(Photo: Mickey Welsh / Advertiser) \nTUSCALOOSA — When I played at Alabama, Tennessee was a huge rivalry. \nAlabama had just beaten Tennessee for the first time in a long time in 1990. \nThen, we won for a long time after that. But the series hadn’t turned yet when I first got there. \n(Former Tennessee star) Carl Pickens said something about Alabama being a high school team, and it was really hot. \nIt has lost a little bit of luster now because Tennessee hasn’t been at the top echelon of the SEC like it used to be. \nIt’s a streaky series, and it seems like it has been that way for a long time. \nWhen one team gets on top, it stays there for a while. Nick Saban has never lost to Tennessee since he has been at Alabama, and that’s a big deal. \nEven in 2007, when Saban had a 6-6 team in his first year, with a bunch of players suspended for the textbook scandal, they still beat Tennessee. \nWhen you beat a team for as long as Alabama has beaten Tennessee, there is a confidence that goes along with that. \nBut on the other side, Tennessee knows how long it has been since it’s won, and I think that does more for Tennessee. \nConfidence is great, but if you’re overconfident, it’s better to have motivation. UT is a good football team, and I don’t care what its record is. \nThe Vols have capable talent, and they are dangerous to anyone they play. \nComing off the Texas A&M game, it doesn’t look like Alabama needs much improvement anywhere, but the quarterback position can still make progress. \nNothing is good as a standstill. The <FZ,1,0,6>improvement doesn’t necessarily come in statistics, but it comes in how the coaches grade you on film. \nThose are two different things. If Ryan Kelly doesn’t play at center, it will be a big chance for J.C. Hassenauer to prove he can play well in a full game at the center position. The Alabama defense seems to be in a real groove right now, so I think the offense is the area where the most improvements can be made. \nAs far as Alabama’s goals for the season, this game is no different than any other. \nIf Alabama loses, the Crimson Tide is out of championship contention. \nThat’s the position they’ve put themselves in by losing to Ole Miss, but that position also allows a team, mentally, to take things one game at a time. \nThe SEC title is secondary in the Nick Saban program. The No. 1 goal is the national championship. \nWhen you have a program like Saban has developed, anything less than a national championship is not a successful season. You have to understand that’s not going to happen every year, but you also have to embrace that as the goal. The players understand the environment and the expectations. \nI think Alabama right now is more concerned with the week-to-week things that will help them win, instead of the big picture. The Crimson Tide knows if they lose another one, there is no shot. But they have no reason to worry about Ole Miss right now. They can only worry about themselves. \nOle Miss still controls things because it’s beaten Alabama, but players don’t need to worry about Ole Miss because they have to keep winning or it won’t matter how Ole Miss finishes. \nOne area Alabama needs to be on top of its game is in special teams coverage. Tennessee has some very talented return people. \nDefensively for Alabama, the dual threat quarterback (Josh Dobbs) could pose some problems. \nThat’s the kind of quarterback who has been a problem for Alabama in the past. \nIf he gets some cheap first downs with his feet to keep drives alive, Alabama might find itself in a football game. I don’t expect Tennessee to get much yardage on the ground with Jalen Hurd, so Dobbs will have to be the man to keep Tennessee in the game if it’s a close one.
