David Duncan deserves praise \nThe tough talking coach has been the subject of discussion for quite some time after he failed to claim the MTN FA cup trophy. The defeat to Medeama meant Duncan has gone another year without winning any major silverware in the country but the reality on the ground is Duncan was appointed to the club after an abysmal start to the league not the cup. \nAfter Didi Dramani’s sack in the seventh round of the league, most Kotoko fans would have seen a second placed finish in the league as wishful thinking rather than reality. Duncan took over the side on matchday 11 and prior to that, the team had played 10, won two, drawn five and lost three. \nKotoko had scored nine goals and conceded nine prior to his arrival. Duncan therefore took charge of Kotoko for the remainder of the 20 games and in these games, he won eleven which represents exactly 55% win percentage, lost four and drew five. \nThey were only four points off winners Ashantigold and should he have been in charge from the start, we would have possibly been talking about Kotoko’s fourth consecutive league triumph. \n2. Hearts of Oak need a holistic review \nAfter the appointment of Herbert Addo coupled with wholesale signings, much was expected from the Phobians. The return to form of Gilbert Fiamenyo further increased expectations but within a few weeks, both Fiamenyo and Hearts were on the decline. \nHearts have gone six years without a league title and in all that time, they have really failed to mount a title charge. Big name coaches such as David Duncan, Herbert Addo and Charles 'CK' Akunnor have all had stints with the Phobians but there seems to be one outcome: perform poorly on the pitch and sack the coach. \nThe team needs to review the past six seasons and identify stumbling blocks which have made the former continental Champions a pale shadow of themselves. The ruling, in reality, leaves Hearts on 40 points - same as relegated Heart of Lions and Olympics. \nThe Accra side escaped relegation by virtue of the head-to-head record which is a great testament to how poor their season was. This is a forgettable campaign for the Phobians and more must be done. \n- \nFollow Kweku on Twitter: @nana_odum.
