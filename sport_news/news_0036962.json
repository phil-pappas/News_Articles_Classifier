Perhaps they would not then mislead readers by stating that \"(h)ealthy standing forests along streams ... shade and cool water.\" (Emphasis mine.)\nThere is absolutely no lowering of water temperature as a result of shade. Given any degree of thought and a little basic science, it is easy to conclude the physical impossibility of any cooling effect. Sounds good, though.\nThis writer learned in a high school physics class that water has a high energy absorpsion coefficient, which means that water can absorb high amounts of energy without raising the water temperature. Conversely, the same is true to get any appreciable amount of cooling. Obviously, expanding the buffers of small and medium streams would not be sufficient to make any noticeable difference in stream temperatures. Water temperatures may be impacted by ambient air temperature, but, of course, that is not an element of buffers or shading.\nInitial stream temperatures are a factor of water origin. Ground water from aquifers and/or from high-elevation melting snow and ice are the primary sources of lower stream temperatures. Ground water in our area has a temperature of 54 degrees Fahrenheit, but varies about 4 degrees depending on the season. Melting snow and ice water are near the freezing temperature of water. Shade does, of course, help maintain stream temperature.\nFurthermore, the RipStream research study does suggest that when timber harvests remove all the trees allowed to be removed in Oregon's progressive forest practice laws, stream temperatures could increase on average as much as 0.7 degrees Celsius, if one assumes all the increase is attributed to reduction of shade, which is a false assumption. Science clearly shows there are many natural stream attributes that influence forest stream temperate unrelated to removing shade. Science also clearly shows any minor temperature increase in a forest stream is temporary. Streams return to their normal temperature within 300 meters downstream of a timber harvest. Shade returns to normal levels within the harvest area within a few short years.\nThat same RipStream study did not suggest any increase in stream temperature created any harm to fish. Temperatures in forest streams are well below the numeric criteria desired by fish. There are paired watershed studies in Oregon (Alsea River, Hinkle Creek and Trask River) that clearly show no harm to fish with any minor temporary increases in forest streams that result from timber harvest. This writer would suggest no fish has died from such negligible change in stream temperature, and there is plenty of science to suggest fish can actually benefit from the minor temporary increase.\nInterestingly, studies have shown that streams without direct sunlight are not very healthy in terms of the production of plants, phytoplankton and, of course, a host of species, including insects, upon which the fish feed. Consistently, changing regulations and changes in statutes have had a very deleterious effect on the management our forestland, not to mention income. If stream buffers are increased as proposed, that part of our property becomes a tax obligation without much chance of any recovery or harvest.\nForestland owners are currently positively impacting water quality through best forest management practices. More regulations and \"takings\" are uncalled-for and unnecessary. Forestland owners are doing significantly more than their fair share.\nâ€¢\nPaul and Judy Nys own and operate a 160-acre certified tree farm in Columbia County.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T20:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T22:27:48.598+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
