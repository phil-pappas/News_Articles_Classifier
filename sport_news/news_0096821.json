The problems overshadowed the tenure of former CEO Jeff Smisek, who took over the combined airline when the merger closed on Oct. 1, 2009.\nOn Sept. 8, Chicago-based United Continental Holdings said Smisek was ousted following an internal investigation into the airline's dealing with the public agency that operates its hub airport in Newark, New Jersey. That agency, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, is part of a federal investigation into abuse of power. Munoz, a railroad executive and head of United's audit committee, was named president and CEO.\nIn his letter, which ran in national newspapers, Munoz didn't offer any hints as to how he will actually fix United's many problems except that he will listen to fliers and employees.\n\"We are committed to re-earning your trust,\" he wrote.\nThe company set up a website, UnitedAirtime.com, for people to ask questions and provide feedback to the airline. The airline posted a few questions and answers in advance of the site's launch that focus on delayed luggage delivery, aging airplanes that lack Wi-Fi or working TVs and the poor quality of first-class meals.\n\"Let's be honest, the implementation of the United and Continental merger has been rocky for customers and employees,\" Munoz says on a video greeting on the site. \"While it's been improving recently, we still haven't lived up to our promise or our potential.\"\n__\nScott Mayerowitz can be reached at http://twitter.com/GlobeTrotScott .\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
