Receiving a fourth Golden Boot in an honour and a privilege. \n\"This trophy is very important for me and I want to thank my team-mates and all the people who have helped me. It's a special moment. I'm not satisfied yet though; I still want to be more. I want a fifth and a sixth if it is possible. I know it will be difficult. \n\"We want to win the league, the Champions League and the Copa del Rey. We'll see each other again next year, I hope.\" \nIt is the third time Ronaldo has won the Golden Shoe at Madrid after previously collecting the trophy for 20101-11 and 2013-14. \nHe also won in 2007-08 with his 21 goals for Manchester United and is the only player to have won it four times. \nGreat rival Lionel Messi is the only player to have won the award three times, with greats such as Gerd Muller, Eusebio and Thierry Henry only managing it twice. \nMadrid president Perez said: \"Just a few days ago he became the highest scorer in the history of Real Madrid with 324 goals. Cristiano is the only player to win four Golden Boots, though his talent, his devotion and his love of having the ball. He is an undeniable legend of the football world. \n\"His profile is enormous and his statistics confirm the dimension of this player. He has won every title and nobody should forget that Cristiano still wants much more. He has never let these awards allow him to slip into complacency and that is in line with the identity of Real Madrid.\" \nFollow Joy Sports on Twitter: @Joy997FM.
