Molloy (7-10) and Christ the King (1-16) had more difficult times, but all the Queens squads return with renewed optimism.\nPerhaps Prep has the greatest cause for confidence. The Terriers were the only team - aside from Xaverian - to receive a first-round bye in the playoffs, and they're returning a seasoned rotation in which every pitcher performed well in prime time last year.\nThat includes Lebro Burnette . The lefty ate up innings as a sophomore last year and his command of a fastball, change-up and slider make him one of the Terriers' top pitchers.\nAlso on the mound will be senior righthander Sal Minichino , a power pitcher with good location, and senior Pat Hornek.\nBrother Robert Kent , the Terriers' longtime coach, calls Hornek a bulldog who \"doesn't always throw hard, but always is around the plate.\"\nSenior Ariel Gomerez and junior Chris Fesler round out the Terriers' pitching staff, and Chris Cannon will be making the calls behind the plate as catcher.\nXaverian remains the unanimous choice as the team to beat, but Kent likes his team's chances of chasing the Clippers.\n\"I feel good about this season, I really do,\" Kent said. \"I'd say Xaverian is still the team to beat, but I think we'll be good. Realistic expectations for us … first, we have to win the league and make the playoffs. There are a lot of good teams out there.\"\nAROUND THE BASES: Surveying the boro's CHSAA field\nMCCLANCY (12-5)\nMcClancy and St. Francis Prep finished with identical 12-5 records during the regular season last year and were it not for the Terriers owning the tiebreaker, the Crusaders would have earned the first-round bye.\nIn retrospect, McClancy understands the importance of clinching a bye.\n\"It's very hard to win if you don't finish first or second,\" McClancy coach Nick Melito said. \"That's key.\"\nStill, last year's run has left McClancy hungry for more. Although the Crusaders have a brand new infield, they return No. 1 pitcher, senior Frank DiMaria.\nThey also return seniors – C Brandon Ferguson and CF Tommy Cloonen (r). Although Cloonen was the Crusaders' leadoff man last year, he may be counted on to hit third in the lineup this season.\nMelito is also looking for 2B T.J. Fox to fit in defensively and also work innings on the mound.\n\"Top to bottom, anybody can beat anybody,\" Melito said. \"It's a really good league.\"\nHOLY CROSS (11-6)\nReturning seniors such as SS Mike Socci, C Matthew Valle and OF A.J. Morena should help the Knights build on their impressive run last season. That said, coach Doug Manfredonia predicted another crapshoot.\n\"I think it's always so tight in 16 games,\" Manfredonia said. \"It's always within a couple of games. Any of those teams (from Queens) can come in second, third or sixth. Xaverian is the favorite, though.\"\nMOLLOY (7-10)\nJack Curran has been coaching on the diamond for a long time. So, when he says his pitching this season is looking solid, he's probably correct.\nThe Stanners return a rotation full of capable righthanders, including Pat Brown , Chris Franzese , John Dugan and Chris Mignoli .\nCHRIST THE KING (1-16)\nCK hopes to improve on last year's last-place finish, and it hopes its senior-laden lineup will help.\nCK returns senior P/SS Steve Verala as its No. 1 option on the mound, while Frank Milito hopes to give the Royals a boost. According to CK coach Bill Oettinger , Milito sat out last year because of academics, but should help the pitching staff and become a staple at third base.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T06:52:43.238+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
