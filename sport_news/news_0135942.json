(Matt Hazlett / For The Baltimore Sun) Edward Lee Contact Reporter The Baltimore Sun Morgan State men's basketball eager to forget last year's 7-24 record, first-round exit in MEAC tournament. \nMorgan State stumbled to a 7-24 overall record and a 5-11 mark in the Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference and was bounced in the first round of the league tournament for the second time in the last nine years. \nSo, it’s not shocking that the Bears are eager to put the memory of that season in the rearview mirror. \n“Last year was a very challenging year,” coach Todd Bozeman said Thursday morning during a preseason men’s basketball conference call organized by the MEAC. “They always say in the church that you should welcome challenges because they only make you better. That’s how I’m approaching it.” \nMorgan State returns three starters in forward Cedric Blossom (14.3 points and 7.1 rebounds per game) and guards Donte Pretlow (5 points and 3.3 assists) and Rasean Simpson (4.2 points and 2.8 rebounds), and they are the only seniors on the roster. Bozeman said he is counting heavily on the seniors to lead the team. \n“Those guys, they’ve been here,” he said. “They’ve played in the championship games in the tournament, but they’ve also had a tough season last year. So they’ve seen both sides. They can choose which one they’d like to experience again and dictate that. Experiences in life can determine how you approach things. We’ll be leaning on those guys just for experience.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T20:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T21:47:18.256+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
