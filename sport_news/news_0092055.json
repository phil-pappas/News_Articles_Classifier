He’d like to talk to the Seattle Reign. Wants to tell them that he can relate. \nClyde Drexler is holding on Line 2. The Glide has a similar message. He’s willing to lend a sympathetic ear if necessary. \nBoth of those guys were part of that University of Houston “Phi Slama Jama” squad that ravaged college basketball for two straight years. Except in the championship game. \nAnd unfortunately for the Reign, that feeling is all too familiar. Most Read Stories Unlimited Digital Access. $1 for 4 weeks. \nFor two consecutive seasons, Seattle has stood above the rest of the National Women’s Soccer League like a redwood among pines. Its record of 29-5-10 over that span has earned them 97 points — 24 more than anybody else. \nThe club was like the 2001 Mariners last year, and the 2014 Seahawks this year. No team was even close to as dominant coming into the playoffs — and no team was more disappointed upon its postseason defeat. \nThursday night, FC Kansas City went bomb squad on the ever-explosive Reign. Seattle came into the match having averaged more than two goals per game, but in its 1-0 loss, fired off just seven shots. \nThe team never found a rhythm. \nThe passing game never discovered a flow. \nAnd aside from Kim Little’s 20-yard strike on net in the first half, and Megan Rapinoe’s laser off the cross bar in the second, the offense never gave itself much of a chance. \nObviously, history isn’t going to group the 2015 NWSL title game with some of the great upsets in sports. But if one were to look strictly at the disproportion in talent, Kansas City was the undisputed underdog. \nSeattle had the best goalkeeper in the world in Hope Solo, one of the best passers in the world in Rapinoe, and possibly the best player in the world in Little. But when Kansas City forward Amy Rodriguez headed Heather O’Reilly’s pass past Solo in the 78th minute, all of that skill was reduced to second place. \nReign players were dejected after the game. Coach Laura Harvey, an England native who isn’t used to the playoff system, was disappointed as well. \nShe knows how dominant her team was in the regular season and was irked that there was no hardware to show for it. \n“We play each other all year, and we define ourselves by one game,” Harvey said. “Ultimately you have to learn to be better in one game, which is hard.” \nRapinoe echoed her coach’s thoughts. \n“We play the regular season with pride, and I think we’ll be disappointed and look back knowing that we were better at times this year than we were last year,” she said. “We want to be dominant all the time and right this.” \nWe’ll see if they can. The Reign has the talent. It has the track record. It has a lot to be proud of. \nBut if it can’t translate that success into a trophy, then like Houston, it will have a problem.
