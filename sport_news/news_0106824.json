Owners of the Bourbon Barrel at 208 S. Green St. have requested a temporary closure of Green Street between Church Street and the business’s north property line next to the city’s Coffill parking lot from 5 to 10 p.m. Oct. 23 and 24. According to the owners, the closure is intended to accommodate the anticipated overflow of patrons for their grand opening. Alcohol would not be allowed outside of the business. City staff is recommending approval of the request with some conditions, including that the owners notify surrounding businesses and advertise the street closure 72 hours in advance, provide a traffic control plan for the city’s police and public works departments and provide the city with evidence of insurance as required by city policy. Later at Monday’s meeting, TUD spokeswoman Lisa Westbrook is scheduled to give the council a presentation on the district’s proposed water and sewer rate increases. The district is proposing to raise rates by nearly 80 percent for the average customer in five years to help cover about $20 million worth of upgrades to TUD’s aging water and sewer system. District staff have held two community forums in Columbia and Soulsbyville over the past week to discuss the plan with customers. Community forums in Tuolumne and at TUD headquarters in Sonora are scheduled for Thursday and Oct. 26, respectively. The TUD Board of Directors is scheduled to vote on the proposed rate increases and a five-year capital improvement plan at a public hearing on Nov. 17. Also at Monday’s meeting, the council is scheduled to consider: • A proposal from Sonora property owner Elena Linehan about moving the city’s six permit-only parking spaces from first- to third-floor of the Terzich parking structure on North Washington Street. • Setting a date and time for the council’s annual planning retreat. • Hold a conference in closed session prior to the regular public meeting to negotiate the purchase of property at 852 Mono Way, the current site of the Corner Gas station and mini-mart owned by Ken Keagy. The station and mini-mart building would need to removed to accommodate a planned widening of the intersection at Greenley Road and Mono Way. Any action taken by the council in closed session must reported publicly at the beginning of the regular meeting.
