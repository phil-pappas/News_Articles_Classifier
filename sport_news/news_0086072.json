(lehighvalleylive.com file photo) By Greg Joyce | For lehighvalleylive.com on October 07, 2015 8:03 PM View/Post Comments \nWhat the future holds for Luke Daub after the next five football games is unclear. \nIt’s why the Easton senior offensive guard and middle linebacker is putting it all on the line beginning Friday night \n“I don’t know if I’ll ever be playing football again, so these next five weeks I’m going to play harder than I’ve ever played in my life before,” Daub said. \nThe Red Rovers stand at 4-1, heading into the second half of their schedule with a grueling slate of games. Their first five opponents have a combined record of 8-17. Their final five? 20-5. \nAttitudes like Daub's will be key in making sure Easton gets through the grind still standing. \n“Our coaches are definitely reminding us that now we have nobody light on our schedule,” Daub said. “All five teams are tough, real tough. …We want home field advantage in the playoffs and we want to go in being 9-1, playing at Cottingham. That’s what we’ve been working for.” \nRELATED : PIAA Board of Directors vote in favor of expansion for football and more \nDaub has long been working for a starting role, which he earned this year at right guard and middle linebacker, in addition to being named one of four captains. He contributed on special teams last year at long snapper while filling in on either side of the ball when need be. \nAnd he hasn’t let his 5-foot-10, 200-pound frame get in the way of achieving his goals. \n“First of all, he’s terribly undersized up there, but he seems to get things done with technique,” coach Steve Shiffert said. “He’s a hustler. He’ll get in people’s way, he’ll make them work for everything they get. It’s a typical Easton scenario: a young man waits till he’s a senior to get his chance and takes advantage of it.” \nShiffert said Daub was on the practice field all summer long refining his technique, which has turned into consistent play this fall. \nThe work ethic, in part, is sparked by a chip on his shoulder for being undersized. He’s not alone, though. \n“Our coaches remind us all the time that we’re undersized,” Daub said. “Nobody on our team is really that big.” Luke Daub (lehighvalleylive.com file photo) \nThe average size of the five starters is 5-foot-11 and 210 pounds. And yet they still have nights like last Friday, when they cleared the way for 338 rushing yards even though East Stroudsburg South defense knew Easton was running it every time (the Red Rovers did not complete a pass). \n“We definitely take pride in it,” Daub said. “We know in order for us to do good, we have to be more physical than everybody else. We just try to use our technique and our physicality and be better than the other defensive lines. \n“… Honestly, last week we were just trying to ground and pound cause we knew we could be more physical than them. We just tried to out-power them, outmatch them physically and just drive the ball down their throat until they could stop it. It seemed to work for us, so we just kept doing our thing. There was no need to change it up.” \nThe road ahead will only get tougher, with opposing defensive lines getting bigger. \nBut Daub and his teammates are on high alert and ready for the challenge, believing their one loss is long in the past. \n“Ever since we lost, we’ve been coming out in practice ready to work,” he said. “Just because we lost doesn’t mean we don’t think we can do the same thing just because we have one loss. We’re ready to come out and fight for the league championship, get back to districts and do it all again.” \nBecause after that, who knows what next? \nDaub hasn’t thought much about continuing his football career at the next level. For him, there’s only the next five weeks. \n“I’m not really worried about that cause education is the most important thing to me,” Daub said. “I’m gonna just try to have the best high school football senior season of my life.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T02:11:24.347+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
