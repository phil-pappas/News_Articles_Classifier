Bob Hough Contact Reporter bhough@capgaznews.com \nSouth River's Savannah Siegrist wasn't looking for style points as she went for a kill to close Thursday's match with Broadneck. \nSiegrist made good contact with the ball, which tipped off the top of the net and fell harmlessly to the ground to wrap up the Seahawks' 25-21, 30-28, 19-25, 25-23 victory over the Bruins. \n\"That was fortunate,\" said Siegrist, who finished with 10 kills and 11 digs and went 16 for 16 serving with three aces. \"That got my heart racing there for a second.\" \nSiegrist's hit capped off a fourth-set comeback for the Seahawks, who rallied from a 19-15 deficit to prevent them from going to a fifth set for the second time this week. \n\"We didn't want to go to a fifth set. We went five sets with Dulaney the other night,\" South River coach Maureen Carter said. \"I'm just glad we came out with the win.\" \nTaylor Mungin led South River (8-3) with 12 kills, including three late in the fourth to help the Seahawks rally and close it out. One of her biggest kills of the match came late in the second set and gave the Seahawks a 28-27 lead in a set they eventually won, 30-28.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T04:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T05:15:11.940+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
