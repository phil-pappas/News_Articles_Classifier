David Jablonski/Staff Sponsored Links Staff Writer COLUMBUS — Braxton Miller’s first touchdown at Ohio Stadium in almost two years is the difference so far as No. 1 Ohio State leads Maryland 21-14 at halftime Saturday. The Wayne grad Miller caught a 19-yard touchdown pass from Cardale Jones with 6:41 left in the second quarter to give the Buckeyes a 21-7 lead. Miller hadn’t scored since the season opener at Virginia Tech. Maryland cut the deficit to 21-14 on a 3-yard run by quarterback Perry Hills with 43 seconds remaining before halftime. A long run by Hills straight up the middle set up that score. Earlier in the half, J.T. Barrett scored on a 3-yard run, and Ezekiel Elliott scored on a 2-yard run. Barrett has been replacing Jones in the red zone. The Terrapins got on the board first with a 52-yard touchdown pass by Hills with 10:52 left in the first quarter. Jones has completed 15 of 20 passes for 195 yards. Elliott has rushed 11 times for 25 yards. Miller has three carries for 11 yards and five catches for 79 yards.
