As a result, Tejada fractured his leg and will miss the remainder of the postseason.\nAfter the game, here's what Utley had to say about the controversial and series-changing slide: \n\"It was one of those awkward plays, first and third. Tying run's on third base, going hard to try to break up the double play. Obviously, I feel terrible that he [Tejada] was injured. I had no intent to hurt anyone whatsoever. But I did have an intent to try to break up the double play.\" ( Via SportsNet LA ) Utley's manager, Don Mattingly, had similar words. ''I know Chase is not trying to hurt anybody. He's just playing the game the way he plays it. He plays it hard, he's aggressive.''\nAs for Mets manager Terry Collins, here are his (very measured) comments about the slide and the rest of the series in general: \nYour browser does not support iframes. \nGame 3 of the NLDS between the Dodgers and Mets will be in New York on Monday. First pitch is scheduled for 8:37 pm ET. \n\nChase Utley said he did not intend to injure Mets shortstop Ruben Tejada.
