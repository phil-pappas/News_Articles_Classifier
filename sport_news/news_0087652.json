Miscommunications between the sponsoring Mojave Off-Road Enthusiasts and the Bureau of Land Management threatened to postpone the race at the last minute. But intervention by local Congressman Paul Cook brought all parties together and saved the race. As a result more than 50 entries lined up Saturday morning at the Stoddard Valley Off-Highway Vehicle Area near Barstow’s Tanger Outlet Mall for the two-part event, raising more than $25,000 for breast cancer research. Most races are about seeing who can cover a set distance in the least amount of time, but for this event the idea was to see who could cover the most distance in a set amount of time. There were two heats, one in the morning and one in the afternoon, each lasting 3 hours and featuring different racing classes. With the rains of the previous days gone and a cool and cloudy day perfect for racing, the first heat started at 8:30 a.m. with the trucks and buggies left the starting line at intervals and headed onto the 18-mile course. Kali Nguyen, in a Class 1300 buggy, completed seven laps in 3 hours, 12 minutes, 11 seconds to take the overall victory, finishing just over a minute ahead of Oak Hills’ Julie Meehan. Tanya Watson took the victory in Class 30 with Lois Ramey taking the Class 2000 title. Stephanie Lofano brought her Class 5/1600 Baja Bug home in first place in that class after her only competition broke down. Chloe Atchison finished first in Class 9 buggies and Lacrecia Beurrier won Class 1900. Kaylee Guilford, driving a Class 11 stock Volkswagen Bug, a racecar from off-roading’s past that had been rebuilt to race again and is affectionately known as The Scrapers, took the honors in that class. The afternoon heat featured the faster racers — the higher-tech, higher-horsepower cars and trucks. It was no surprise when Kelly Boyle Mather, driving a Class 1 buggy, the Formula One of off road racing, took the overall victory by completing eight laps in 3:29:46. Right behind was Jennifer Cleminson, first place in Class 10 buggies, finishing eight laps in 3:34:20. The biggest class of the afternoon was the Class 1600 (1600cc buggies) with a dozen entries. Kori Dalbey finished seven laps in 3:26:58 to just barely edge out Meehan, who had the early lead but broke a torsion bar and had to pit for repairs. She made up almost 15 minutes to finish less than 2 minutes behind Dalbey. Meehan, a veteran off-road racer and past winner of this event, was part of a three-car team based in Oak Hills that finished second, third and fourth in Class 1600. She was followed by teammates Nellie Kitterman and Robin Kardos. Class 11 winner Guilford was also part of the Motorsports Race Prep team. Other winners in the afternoon heat were Westley Bostwick in Class 1400, Raeann Munoz in Class 1350, Karyn Cluff in Class 12 and Savannah Spitz in Class 5.
