Dickey's fourth pitch of the game, Alex Rios connected an inning later and the Kansas City Royals routed the Toronto Blue Jays 14-2 Tuesday to move one win from a second straight World Series.\nKansas City moved ahead 3-1 in the best-of-seven AL Championship Series and can win the pennant Wednesday, when Edinson Volquez starts against Toronto's Marco Estrada in a Game 1 rematch.\nLorenzo Cain scored on a passed ball and Mike Moustakas had a sacrifice fly in an LCS-record four-run top of the first.\nKansas led 5-2 in the seventh before breaking away.\nBlue Jays infielder Cliff Pennington relieved in the ninth inning, becoming the first primarily position player to pitch in the postseason, STATS said.\nYour browser does not support iframes.\nALCS Game 3\nThe Toronto Blue Jays beat the Kansas City Royals 11-8 in Game 3 of ALCS.\nJosh Donaldson, Troy Tulowitzki and Ryan Goins connected as the Blue Jays matched a postseason team record with three home runs while building a 10-4 lead against the Royals.\nToronto also hit three home runs in Game 4 of the Division Series against Texas. Donaldson went deep in that game as well, along with Chris Colabello and Kevin Pillar.\nDonaldson has three homers this postseason, matching the Blue Jays record held by Joe Carter (1992), Candy Maldonado (1992) and Paul Molitor (1993).\nThe Blue Jays reached double figures in runs for the third time in their postseason history. Toronto beat Philadelphia 10-3 in Game 3 of the 1993 World Series, then used a six-run eighth inning to outslug the Phillies 15-14 in Game 4.\nYour browser does not support iframes.\nALCS Game 2\nJust as it was against Houston in Game 4, it did not look good for the Kansas City Royals.\nDown 3-0 to Toronto Blue Jays ace David Price, a five-run seventh inning was key in the Royals latest Houdini act in the postseason.\nWith the 6-3 win, the Royals are up 2-0 in the series.\nMagic seventh inning leads to 2-0 lead\nThe Royals finally broke through against David Price, rallying to take the lead in the seventh by batting around.\nThe surge started when Ben Zobrist hit a shallow pop fly to right that second baseman Ryan Goins, running back, appeared to call for. Jose Bautista started to slow up but Goins, perhaps distracted by the loud crowd noise, stopped and slid to the ground as if he was ceding to the outfielder. Instead, the ball fell in for the Royals' first hit since Alcides Escobar singled to lead off the first.\nEric Hosmer, Kendry Morales, Mike Moustakas and Alex Gordon each drove in a run before Price was pulled. Alex Rios drove in one more run with a single off Aaron Sanchez for a 5-3 lead.\nALCS Game 1\nKansas City Royals beat Toronto Blue Jays 5-0 in Game 1 of ALCS.\n8:15 p.m.\nThe Royals are playing from ahead in the postseason for a change.\nAlcides Escobar hit an RBI double and Lorenzo Cain a run-scoring single to give Kansas City a 2-0 lead over the Toronto Blue Jays after three innings in Game 1.\nEscobar already has a pair of doubles off Marco Estrada, who got the starting nod for Toronto over former Cy Young winner and Game 2 starter David Price.\nThe only baserunners that the Royals' Edinson Volquez has allowed came when Jose Bautista walked in the first inning and Kevin Pillar walked in the third.\nBautista was left stranded on first. Pillar was bunted to second but left there when Ben Revere flew out to center and Josh Donaldson -- who had a dustup with Volquez during the regular season -- grounded out to shortstop.\nYour browser does not support iframes.\n---", "external_links": ["http://m.royals.mlb.com/shared/video/embed/embed.html?content_id=523610283&topic_id=8877722&width=400&height=224&property=mlb", "http://m.royals.mlb.com/shared/video/embed/embed.html?content_id=524476883&topic_id=8877722&width=400&height=224&property=mlb", "http://m.mlb.com/shared/video/embed/embed.html?content_id=524713183&topic_id=94786876&width=400&height=224&property=mlb"], "published": "2015-10-17T07:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T17:26:47.133+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
