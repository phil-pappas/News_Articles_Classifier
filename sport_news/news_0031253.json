One sure-fire way to grab the attention from the Presidents Cup is to televise a brutal shank.\nThe victim? Ian Poulter. While playing the 415-yard par-4 fifth hole at Woburn Golf Club, Poulter’s approach from the rough was a brutal, unapologetic shank. The 39-year-old couldn’t even keep his right hand on the club, quickly stunned at his own errant shot.\nThe video catches the shank quite well, and even shows Poulter beginning to grin after watching where his ball ended up. Poulter would finish the hole with a double bogey, but added a birdie on the seventh to ease the sting.\nIan Poulter shank from Francisco Domingues on Vimeo .\nAdChoices Go to MSN Home", "external_links": ["https://vimeo.com/141903604", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "https://vimeo.com/userhuman66", "http://www.golf.com/"], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T03:51:33.719+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
