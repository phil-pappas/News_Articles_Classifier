(AP) - Bond has been set for a Forrest County volunteer firefighter facing an embezzlement charge.\nWDAM-TV reports ( http://bit.ly/1GnkoU8 ) Carl Swann made his initial appearance in court Monday where his bond was set at $5,000. It was unknown if Swann has an attorney who could comment on his behalf.\nSwann, arrested last Thursday, is accused of embezzling money from donations received by the Rawl Springs Volunteer Fire Department. Officials say no tax dollars or county or state funds are involved. The funds in question stem from those that were donated to the department through fundraisers by the department's volunteers.\nIn addition to being the department's assistant chief, Swann is also a former reserve deputy for the Forrest County Sheriff's Department.\nInformation from: WDAM-TV, http://www.wdam.com\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
