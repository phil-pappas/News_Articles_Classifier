As staffers exit the ESPN site, a clearer picture of life there before and after the departure of Bill Simmons is emerging. by \nhttps://twitter.com/JimMiller/status/656124610191183872 \nWith a staff exodus underway , a clearer picture of the site’s last year of operations has emerged. Though Simmons has only technically been out at Grantland for five months, many began to see the writing on the wall last fall, when Simmons was suspended for calling N.F.L. commissioner Roger Goodell a liar on his podcast. \nInsiders at Grantland point out that in the aftermath of Simmons’s suspension, executive vice president Marie Donoghue told the staff that they “shouldn’t worry, because whether or not Bill stays at ESPN, the company is committed to Grantland.” \nESPN management says that Donoghue, who oversaw the site, made that statement because staffers were specifically asking whether they should fear for their jobs, “given Bill’s behavior.” She was trying to calm them down, ESPN brass points out, she wasn’t trying to suggest she and the network didn’t want Bill to stay. \nSeveral key Grantland members, however, took it another way. Says one, “That was the tipping-point moment. What do you mean if Bill’s here or not? Bill is Grantland! What are you talking about? Bristol never recovered with the staff after that.” \nDigging deeper into the steaming remains of the ESPN-Simmons divorce, it becomes clear that while the breakup may have been bloody, costly, and emotionally exhausting, it was also certainly worthwhile for both sides. \nOver 48 tempestuous hours, in more than 15 conversations with current and former ESPN employees, current and former Grantland staffers, and current ESPN senior management, additional information has surfaced suggesting there were numerous areas of major conflict, and several more defined by personal animosity, fundamental misconceptions, and even accusations of sexism. \nAs ports of entry into this Byzantine world, we can look to three major stress points. \nFirst: Simmons’s relationship with the rest of ESPN outside Grantland. There was no love lost between the two. During his last year at ESPN, many at the network believe, Simmons still respected and had warm feelings toward executives John Skipper , John Walsh , and several others at the company. It was equally evident to many that he resented the way he was treated by other executives and was largely dismissive of the way they conducted business. \nA major fork in the road arose when Magic Johnson left NBA Countdown in 2013 and, Simmons’s associates believe, Bristol was spreading the story that Simmons was to blame, even as Simmons swore to co-workers that he had not put that in motion. Being blamed for Johnson’s departure enraged him, in fact. Try living in L.A. and being regarded as the guy who dumped Magic Johnson. \nFor ESPN’s part, the animosity was mutual. “Nobody at ESPN wanted to work with Simmons,” says a high-ranking executive. “He was loathed throughout the company. He kept up a long-running diatribe on how terrible it was to work here.” \nThere were also complaints that Simmons would not allow Grantland writers to contribute to ESPN.com or to the magazine—or, for a long time, to appear on any of ESPN’s TV shows. Some of that was true: The Grantland staff was intent on building the Grantland brand. \nAnd, at least one executive complains—somewhat ironically, given his feelings toward Simmons—that Simmons seldom came to Bristol, but Simmons would tell the Grantland staff and others that it was hard for him to get to Bristol from the site’s Los Angeles headquarters, that he didn’t have the time, and that he didn’t think it necessary. He did, however, go at least once three years in a row, and traveled at least four times a year to New York, where he would meet with the network’s executives. \nNevertheless, bitterness was palpable and plentiful. \nSays Donoghue: “I think Bill sometimes tries to associate whatever frustration he had at ESPN onto something with me personally, and I don’t want to play into that narrative. I was one of his biggest champions at ESPN and defended Bill many, many, times.” \nA senior ESPN executive adds this: “I bet you a dollar to a dime that many of your sources are men who do not like Marie Donoghue, because women are still subject, in the workplace, to a lot of prejudice and lack of acceptance. A lot of people don’t want to work for a woman, even if they say they do.” \nSecond: resources. ESPN sources say there are 55 full-time staffers at Grantland, but Grantland sources put the full-time number at only 42, and point out they didn’t have a photo staff, a social-media staffer, a Web designer, or an app specialist. Bristol, however, doesn’t want to hear any of that. \n“Bill Simmons’s suggestion that we did not support him is the whiniest and most asinine argument possible,” says a high-ranking executive. “He got a free pass, he got good office space in L.A. When he asked for more employees and more office space, he got it. There is indignation about Bill’s lack of gratitude and his mischaracterizations of support.” \nA senior member of the Grantland team puts it this way: “Bill was trying to build something truly special, and was aggressive about it. We never had the army that ESPN the Magazine had, and besides, look at all the great things Bill was doing for the company.” \nOver the years, there were in fact a multitude of things Simmons did for ESPN, many of which weren’t in his contract, including two N.B.A. drafts, commercial shoots for NBA Countdown , multiple ad-sales trips, and developing TV shows like Bad Boys Remix and Grantland Basketball Hour . \nThird: the culture at Grantland. “Bill created a culture in L.A. that was ‘I’m Bill Simmons and I’m protecting you from the Big Bad ESPN. I’m buying you freedom. If it weren’t for me, they wouldn’t be letting you do this,’” says the same high-ranking executive. “Which is smart. It’s why every coach says, ‘It’s us against the world, we’re gonna surprise the world,’ even when they’re ranked No. 1. \n“So there’s no question we’re surprised at some of the defections. But they’re loyal to Bill,” the executive continued. “I think we’d be disingenuous to suggest they’re not.” \nThere are numerous other factors that could be analyzed and discussed here, but all would point in the same direction: as great and as valuable as the Simmons contributions to ESPN had been for many years, there were too many holes to be sewn together, and far too much insanity. In fact, ESPN confirmed it received at least one death threat made to an executive after Simmons’s suspension. Clearly, it was time to part ways, but that doesn’t mean the arguments will stop. \n“I will guarantee you,” says this high-ranking ESPN executive, “it will not be a year before Bill Simmons will not be satisfied with the support he is getting from HBO. He won’t think the marketing is good enough. He’ll think he’s got to live with some terrible producer.” \nOn the record, ESPN issued this statement: “ESPN is proud of the unprecedented support we gave to Bill and the Grantland team during his time with us. The company afforded Bill a very unique opportunity. ESPN has moved forward with confidence and no regrets.” \nBut a filmmaker who has spent time with both sides says, “ESPN has acted immature, paranoid, and threatened throughout this entire Bill episode. They have no understanding how to deal with people who are truly artistic. Is Bill temperamental and needy? Yes, but so what? He’s probably the single most creative force that’s been at that company for a long time.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T14:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T23:38:01.700+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
