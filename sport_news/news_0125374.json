Got some pressure 1-on-1. Tre' Williams and Tim Irvin (bone bruise, foot) are expected back at Kentucky Carlton Davis doing well. On TD he was beat on, not a lot Davis could do, was in position to make a play. On T.J. Davis: \"Another guy that (could) be able to go in the fold.\" Byron Cowart is \"playing very well\" in ~20 snaps per game Says Cowart is someone who is very hard on himself and getting freshmen to understand they can play well without having production is always a challenge On another 400-yard performance: \"Certainly not something I'm used to\" and not something they want anyone to be accustomed to Jaun'tavius Johnson is closer to playing, considered a zero Says Devaroe Lawrence and Maurice Swain need to improve", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T10:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T07:34:18.029+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
