Forecasters say some areas could see storm totals as high as 15 inches.\nOnce the rain ends, as early as Saturday in some places, the threat of flooding persists because the ground is too saturated to absorb water, meteorologists say. And high winds could bring down trees like the one that hit a vehicle near Fayetteville, North Carolina, killing a passenger.\nPedestrians negotiate rainy conditions along Lexington Avenue Friday, Oct. 2, 2015, in New York.

Chris Christie said amid street flooding at the Jersey shore, devastated by Superstorm Sandy nearly three years ago. \"Let's keep our fingers crossed.\"\nAdvertisement Forecasters warned that even as Joaquin peels away from the coast, its effects will be felt, because it will continue supplying tropical moisture to the gusty rainstorm stretching from Georgia to New England.\nSouth Carolina could get more rain in three days than it normally gets during the entire fall.\nSkies begin to darken as Hurricane Joaquin passes through the region, seen from Nassau, Bahamas, early Friday, Oct. 2, 2015.

A lot of places are going to have 5, 6, 7 inches of rain, particularly the whole state of South Carolina.\"\nParts of Virginia and Maryland could get up to 5 inches.\nThe storm was blamed for the death of Sylvia Arteaga, 56, drowned in a flash flood under a railroad bridge in Spartanburg, South Carolina, while driving home from the night shift.\nOcean City, Maryland, had 5 feet of water in low-lying areas at high tide Friday afternoon. But by evening the floodwaters had largely receded, easing Geri Stoll's concern that successive high tides would bring significantly worse flooding.\n\"As long as we get rid of what occurred already, then when the new tide comes in, we might get a couple more inches into the yard, but it won't be anything major for us in downtown Ocean City,\" she said.\nIn Poquoson, Virginia, Joy Bryant canceled a yard sale because her property was half-submerged and cars couldn't get down the road. Still, she was relieved Joaquin was moving away.\nSteve Stougard of Norfolk, Virginia, called Joaquin's course \"an answered prayer.\"\nJoaquin tore off roofs, uprooted trees and unleashed heavy flooding in the Bahamas, and the U.S. Coast Guard searched for a missing 735-foot cargo ship with 33 people aboard.\n———\nDishneau reported from Chincoteague, Virginia; Borenstein from Washington.\n———\nAssociated Press writers Jonathan Drew in Raleigh, North Carolina; Tom Foreman Jr. in Spartanburg, South Carolina; Wayne Parry in Sea Isle City, New Jersey; Alanna Durkin in Poquoson, Virginia; and Ben Nuckols in Washington contributed to this report.", "external_links": ["http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site333/2015/1003/20151003__USEastCoastRainstorm~p2_200.jpg", "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site333/2015/1003/20151003__USEastCoastRainstorm~p3_200.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-03T20:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T11:01:36.461+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
