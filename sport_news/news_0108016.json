I will go back to India and announce my retirement.\"\n\nMCL is supposed to be played in February next year, which means that Sehwag will complete his Ranji Trophy commitments with Haryana before joining the veterans' league.\n\nIn a glorious international career spanning over 12 years, Sehwag played 104 Tests scoring 8586 runs at an impressive average of 49.34, hitting 23 centuries and 32 half-centuries.\n\nHe is the only triple centurion in Tests for India having scored career-best knock of 319 against Pakistan at Multan, which also is an Indian record. He is also one of those rare batsmen to have scored two triple ton with his next one (309) coming against South Africa.\n\nIn 251 ODIs, he accumulated 8273 runs at an average of 35.05 and scored 15 hundreds apart from hitting 38 fifties.\n\nIn 19 Twenty20 Internationals, he managed 394 runs with two half-centuries.\nHe has been a part of two World Cup winning teams under Mahendra Singh Dhoni's leadership --- 2007 World T20 in South Africa and the ICC Cricket World Cup in India.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T20:47:57.862+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
