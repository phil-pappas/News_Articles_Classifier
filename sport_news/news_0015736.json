I feel like I have always been playing catch-up because I usually start my PGA Tour season at the end of February and most guys are starting now.\n\"So it's nice to get a couple of events in before the turn of the year. Hopefully when I get back to Florida (in late February) I won't be feeling the pressure of trying to catch up to these guys.\"\nWith a grin on his face, McIlroy suggested that his biggest challenge this week would be trying to remain in contention while also making the most of his first trip to the Napa Valley.\n\"I'd never been to this area before but you can see why everyone is relaxed. Beautiful weather and there's a lot of stuff to do away from the golf course,\" the 26-year-old said.\n\"So I'm trying to find a balance between enjoying myself this week and still trying to play well. It's a great event and I'm obviously very happy to be here.\"\n(Reporting by Mark Lamport-Stokes in Los Angeles; Editing by Frank Pingue)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T02:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T02:08:13.163+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
