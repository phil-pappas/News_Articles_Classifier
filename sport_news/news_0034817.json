NBC also was inspired by a New York magazine cover story this summer that gathered many of Cosby's accusers together for a photograph, although Snow said the network had begun working to gather the interviews before that.\nSnow said all of the women who have publicly accused Cosby were asked to participate in the interview, which was recorded in Los Angeles in late August. Twenty-seven women agreed. Snow said she interviewed four other women involved anonymously in a 2005 case against Cosby, and two of them subsequently said they would join the other women on camera.\nThe interview took five hours, and NBC's team had to edit it down to a one-hour special that airs at 9 p.m. EDT and PDT.\nSome of the women hadn't discussed their cases before in such a public forum, Snow said. The special includes no women who had not previously made allegations against Cosby.\n\"They didn't know each other before, and now they are sitting in a room talking about intimate personal details about the allegations,\" she said. \"They say there is a power in that.\"\nWhile it's a challenge to interview so many people at the same time, Snow tried to use the sheer numbers to connect dots between their allegations. She asked the women for a show of hands on how many believed Cosby had raped them, had sexually assaulted them and had drugged them.\nShe also asked how many had reported their allegations to police at the time, or had asked for an examination with a rape kit following the encounters. No women raised their hands to that question, she said.\n\"I believe it's healing and it's cathartic to be able to talk to each other, to look around and be together,\" said one woman, Sunni Welles.\nSnow said there were several attempts to get Cosby or his representatives to appear on \"The Cosby Accusers Speak,\" to be broadcast on the network where the comic had his greatest success during the 1980s. They were all declined. A Cosby representative, Monique Pressley, declined to comment to The Associated Press about the NBC show.\nRelated Stories Judge won't toss lawsuit against Cosby despite procedural error Model sues Cosby over alleged sex assault in 2008 Fordham, Marquette rescind Cosby's honorary degrees", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T01:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T01:20:04.559+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
