Even pre-expansion, during his brief stay as Montana's football coach in 2000 and 2002, the Griz frequently drew crowds of 18,000. \nYears later he'd tell stories of the stadium's impact on visiting foes. Those tales trickled back to the Grizzly players when Glenn's South Dakota Coyotes came to Missoula for a game in 2012. \n\"It's funny; I had a friend who went there,\" relayed senior Montana cornerback Nate Harris, a freshman in that year's game. \"(Glenn) talked about how they had to get on us and fast in the third quarter 'cause the fans are all out tailgating.\" \nWashington-Grizzly is notoriously light in attendees around halftime as fans stream outside to continue tailgating, as allowed by official UM policy. As the years went by, some fans have grown increasingly more bold, delaying their return. At Montana's most recent home game, the loss to Weber State on Oct. 10, the sellout crowd of 25,500 still had major cleavages running through it as the third quarter expired. \nThe mass vacancy is hard not to notice, but it's a minor negative that the university isn't worried about avoiding, Montana athletic director Kent Haslam explained. \n\"Quite honestly, we have not had a lot of discussions about keeping fans in at halftime,\" he said. \"It'd be great to have more people in the stands, but ... letting the facility breath has worked pretty well.\" \nMontana's tailgating policy allows for re-entry with a ticket and hand stamp, and Haslam said he loves that Griz supporters utilize that option. With narrow concourses and limited restroom facilities, at least compared to the stadium's capacity (25,217), the place could be a zoo should all those people mill around and remain within the gates. \nHarris said all the players are aware of the suddenly unoccupied seats, numbering in the thousands each week, and the void in noise that accompanies the vacancies. But they don't care, he said. \n\"You hope not; you hope they're just coming out and playing the game,\" Montana coach Bob Stitt added. \"We definitely would like to have our fans out there in the third quarter and we've been taking the ball first so they're having their offense out there (to start the third). \n\"It's not the same without the fans in here. We'd love to have them stay and cheer us on in that first series.\" \nOne option often floated to retain some spectators involves serving alcohol for the general seating population, something UM currently does not do at any of its facilities. Beer sales could keep more fans out of the parking lots at tailgaters as well as increase revenue. \nIn September, Montana State mulled the idea, which could also help limit binge drinking and increase fan safety. \nThat discussion, which Haslam said UM has not had in detail, has two main snags in Missoula. Stadium-wide beer sales would invariably cannibalize Montana's famous tailgating scene and any added revenue would not stay within the athletic department. \nThe department contracts all its concessions for sporting events through UM Dining Services for a flat annual rate of $20,000. Dining Services collects the revenue from home games. \n\"Any of the profit that is taken off of that, we'd have to renegotiate or figure out how that would be split,\" said Haslam, who reiterated the conversation, which would include Montana president Royce Engstrom, is not one UM is currently having. \nMontana allows alcohol sales only in private suites and club sections at its events. That includes the Canyon Club on the east side of Wa-Griz and the Sky Club above Dahlberg Arena in the Adams Center. Drinks may not be removed from those areas. \nThe policy is fairly consistent throughout the Big Sky Conference, where general seating beer sales are available in only three locations. North Dakota and Northern Colorado each serve alcohol throughout their various arenas, and Portland State does for football only. \nThe Vikings play their football as off-campus tenants of Providence Park, home of Major League Soccer's Portland Timbers. \nBeer is not sold at any NCAA championship event, ranging from basketball's Final Four to the FCS championship game. \nGriz fans will continue to have their opportunities to imbibe on game days, Haslam assured. Tailgates close down much of Campus Drive, various parking lots and nearby fields on Saturdays. \n\"Part of the real draw of the University of Montana is our tailgating,\" Haslam said. \"I hear that constantly from opposing teams when they come here. Their administrators and others just say, 'Boy, I wish we could replicate this where we're at.' \n\"It's a carnival and it's a party and it's fun.\" \nA party with strict policies that is. Fans may bring their own drinks to private tailgates, and no sale of alcohol is allowed outside of the official Grizzly Scholarship Association tailgate. \nFans may not begin their festivities more than 2 hours in advance and are restricted from continuing beyond kickoff of the second half of the football game. \nShepherding 10,000 fans back to their seats, though, appears to take the length of the third quarter.
