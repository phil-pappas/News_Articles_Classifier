It is impossible to overhype, to overstate, to – yes, I’m going to say it – overinflate the importance of this game to the Patriots and their fans. The Patriots may not want to talk about it, but this game is the one every Pats fan has been talking about ever since the Indianapolis Tattle Tales complained about the air pressure in the footballs while they were getting blown out in the AFC Championship Game. Pressure? The Colts clearly couldn’t handle the pressure. And not just in the rout that was the AFC tilt. They’ve been manhandled by the Patriots the last four times they’ve played, including a couple of playoff games, and are 0-6 against them over the past five seasons. Since Indianapolis made quarterback Andrew Luck the top pick in the 2012 draft, the Patriots have clobbered the Colts by lopsided scores: 59-24 in his rookie year; 43-22 in the AFC semifinals in the’13 season; 42-20 in the regular season last year; followed by the 45-7 trouncing in last season’s AFC Championship Game. If the Pats fans have their way, those games will seem like nailbiters compared to the hoped-for final score of the Deflategate Bowl. Patriots fans who became more angry and frustrated with each passing day as Deflategate dragged on, month after month, circled tonight’s game on their calendars when the NFL schedule was announced in April. They don’t want the Pats merely to win, they want them to win big. They want them to pummel – and punish – the Indianapolis Whistleblowers. They want the Indianapolis Snitches to be slaughtered. They want the Whining Colts to be beaten to the proverbial pulp. In the 1940 NFL championship game, the Bears routed the Redskins, 73-0. Nothing would make New England fans happier than if the Pats led by that margin by halftime. And then continued to pour it on in the second half. The players say they’re not looking at it that way. Brady says he’s “always motivated,” and that he needs no extra incentive – even from incendiary subjects like the Colts’ role in smearing his reputation in Deflategate – to be ready to play. While Patriots fans are openly craving revenge, coach Bill Belichick says he wants only a victory. “We’re just going to try to do our best to go out there and play well,” he said. “There are always a lot of things [going on] on the outside. We just try to focus on what we need to do to coach and play well on Sunday night.” Page 2 of 2 - Like the Patriots, the Indianapolis Rats didn’t want to talk about Deflategate, either. The final score of the AFC Championship Game was embarrassing enough. It makes it worse for the Colts to appear to be blaming that thrashing on underinflated footballs. So, like the Pats, they’ve been saying this game is the one they happen to be playing in Week Six – nothing more. But we know better. We know this is the Biggest Game of the Year. The One We’ve Been Waiting For. The outcome seems obvious. Is there any doubt that the Patriots will win? The only question is whether they will win by enough to satisfy their fans’ thirst for revenge. Because this is the Deflategate Bowl, and the Patriots not only want to win, they want to win big. If they say anything else, if they downplay the significance of this game, well, I’m here to tell you that’s only so much hot air. -jdonalds@providencejournal.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T01:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T06:15:36.881+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
