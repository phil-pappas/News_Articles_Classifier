That's much more important than individual evaluation in a newspaper.\" \nVan Gaal will not see his players again until after the international break and he expressed frustration that he will not have an opportunity to help them shake Sunday's result out of their systems. \n\"We've lost in a way you cannot lose when you're top of the league. You cannot start like we have started,\" said the Dutchman, whose side visit Everton in their next league game on Oct 17. \n\"The worst thing is that everybody is going away, even from London airports. And I cannot build up a new situation so that they have the confidence to play football and win the next battle away at Everton, for example.\" â€“ AFP Opinion", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T04:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T04:50:30.472+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
