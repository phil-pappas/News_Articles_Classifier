National Congress of American Indians Executive Director Jackie Pata and Oneida Nation Representative Ray Halbritter said RISE should spearhead the charge to have the Washington team change its moniker.\n\"It seems a natural fit for the organization to address the outlying NFL franchise in Washington which is not only dividing and isolating people with its offensive team name, but directly denigrating a segment of our nationâ€™s population based on their alleged skin color,\" they said Friday in a statement.\n(Reporting by Steve Ginsburg in Washington; Editing by Andrew Hay)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T22:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T22:35:47.136+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
