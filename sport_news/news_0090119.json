Smith-USA TODAY Sports Kevin Durant vehemently denied a Stephen A. Smith report about his purported interest in playing with the Lakers. The impending free agency of Kevin Durant took an intriguing turn when ESPN’s Stephen A. Smith said the Oklahoma City Thunder superstar considers the Los Angeles Lakers a top destination.\nAdChoices However, according to Anthony Slater of The Oklahoman , Durant said the rumors Smith shared are a lie.\nKevin Durant on the Lakers rumors: \"I don't talk to Stephen A Smith at all. No one in my family, my friends do. So he's lying.\"\n— Anthony Slater (@anthonyVslater) October 2, 2015 Per Slater , Durant further clarified his statement:\n“If you ask me a question, I’ll talk about [the rumors]. But like I said before, I have people who I talk to about everything and I know for a fact they didn’t talk to him, so he’s making up stories.”\nDurant is due $21.2 million ( h/t Hoops Hype ) in 2015-16, which is the final year of his contract. Barring an unanticipated extension in the near future, the 2013-14 NBA MVP will be an unrestricted free agent next summer.\nAnd the number of questions about Durant’s future basketball home will only intensify.\nWill Durant stay with the only franchise he’s ever known? Or will he return to home and play for the Washington Wizards. An anonymous player told Basketball Insiders he’s “pretty sure” that’s Durant’s plan. Or will the 27-year-old head elsewhere?\nAlthough Durant said the Lakers rumors are a lie—and that validity is not being addressed here—the Lakers are a legitimate landing spot anyway because of the cap room they’ll have available.\nThe rumors won’t stop throughout the 2015-16 NBA season, but hopefully Durant will be willing to set the record straight whenever one worth addressing hits the headlines.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.yardbarker.com/", "http://www.basketballinsiders.com/nba-pm-will-stars-bolt-from-west-to-east/", "https://twitter.com/anthonyVslater/status/649999240932950016", "https://twitter.com/anthonyVslater/status/649998099331485696", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "http://hoopshype.com/salaries/oklahoma_city_thunder/"], "published": "2015-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T10:11:58.872+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
