Scream. Swear if it helps.\nYou have every visceral right to vent after an embarrassing 8-3 loss Wednesday night at Wrigley Field that allowed the Mets to sweep the National League Championship Series. You earned it after sitting through the forgettable final four games of a memorable season that deserved a more fitting conclusion.\nNow you can change the hash tag to #WeWereGood and shave the Jake Arrieta playoff beard. Start waiting till next year, again. But remember, feeling pain in October instead of feeling numb represents progress for the Cubs. How many fans of other teams this week would trade your anger for their apathy?\nYes, Cubs hitters slumped badly this series. Yes, starting pitcher Jason Hammel stunk in Game 4. And yes, the calendar said 2015 but it resembled awful endings to so many other years on the North Side.\nExcept, it wasn't.\nThis felt more like an opening act for the Cubs than a curtain closing, like a precursor to future postseasons when the lessons learned from this fiasco will come in handy. The National League runners-up still possess enough talent that manager Joe Maddon was right when he proclaimed pregame, \"This is just the beginning.''\nPhotos from Game 4 of the NLCS at Wrigley Field.\nPostgame, inside a quiet Cubs clubhouse, Anthony Rizzo reiterated Maddon's message.\n\"We set a tone for how we are going to be for a long time,'' Rizzo said.\nChalk this up to the youngest NL playoff team playing two weeks of bonus baseball. The Cubs emerged from the Cardinals series as World Series favorites but acted their age against the Mets, with slow hands at the plate and all thumbs in the field. Their pitching disappointed in New York and disappeared in Chicago.\nWhat happened? Rest assured, the big brains that run the Cubs will spend the winter studying every facet of their NLCS failure. One theory: Maybe a franchise known for waiting had to wait too long before the Mets series, losing mojo, momentum or whatever intangible that made Maddon's team special. Maybe not. As Maddon preached daily, the Cubs never let the pressure exceed the pleasure, but it's fair to wonder after four lousy games if they stayed too loose during three days off and lost their edge.\nWhatever it was, the same Cubs team that won 97 regular-season games looked drastically different against the Mets. Daniel Murphy dominated like few major leaguers have in October. The Mets' powerful four starting pitchers — Matt Harvey, Noah Syndergaard, Jacob deGrom and 24-year-old rookie Steven Matz — reminded some in New York of the 1986 and 1969 staffs. Their pitching prevented the Cubs from ever leading in the series.\n\"They did not let us up for air at any point,'' Maddon said.\nBack in April, the Cubs would have considered an 88-win season a success but walked off the field a final time on a downer after raising expectations. Not surprisingly, Maddon turned philosophical after meeting with his team and saluting fans who stayed to say goodbye.\n\"I walked in the door not really knowing anybody in Arizona when we got there in February, and how we built relationships and created a culture within one year is pretty spectacular,'' Maddon said.\nThe Cubs came closer to the World Series than most people imagined yet feel further away than ever because of the lopsided series. That's a negative President Theo Epstein can turn into a positive. Getting swept exposed what the Cubs lack and showed Chairman Tom Ricketts firsthand it will take another payroll increase to push his team over the top. The Cubs need an upgrade at No. 3 starter, a big-ticket free agent such as David Price or Jordan Zimmermann. They need to improve their outfield defense, which was abysmal. They need to add hitters who can manufacture runs on a team overly reliant on the home run.\nBut it's worth repeating that the Cubs need much less than most teams — a fact easy to overlook sifting through the rubble of Game 4.\nThe Mets hammered Hammel in the biggest start of his career, the death blow delivered by Lucas Duda with a three-run home run in the first. When Travis d'Arnaud followed with an opposite-field home run, it stunned the crowd of 42,227 into silence.\nFans woke up by the time Hammel left in the second, booing him initially before offering polite applause. But hearing the crowd's reaction won't be Hammel's lasting impression of his final start. Getting rocked in the first will be, forever.\n\"They didn't miss pitches,'' catcher David Ross said.\nThe Mets batted around, meaning Matz made his Wrigley debut at the plate instead of on the mound. Then Matz mowed the Cubs down like every other Mets starter, giving up one run in 42/3 innings. The amazin' Matz indeed.\nThe Cubs scored as many runs in the series — eight — as the Mets scored in the clincher. They went 0-for-28 leading off innings until Jorge Soler singled to start the fourth. They looked like a team that had run out of magic.\nStarlin Castro striking out on a pitch that hit his foot, knocking him over, summed up the game. Castro lining out to third baseman David Wright with the bases loaded and nobody out summed up the series.\nA moment of levity came when catcher Ross ran away from home plate and gave the ball to a fan, thinking the third inning was over. It was only the second strike — but everybody in the ballpark understood, and probably appreciated, Ross rushing to finish the game as soon as possible. The offseason couldn't get here soon enough for everybody who endured that debacle.\nBut for a Cubs team on the rise, neither can spring training.\ndhaugh@tribpub.com\nTwitter @DavidHaugh\nPrivacy Policy Copyright © 2015, Chicago Tribune Major League Baseball Baseball Chicago Cubs New York Mets Joe Maddon National League Championship Series Jason Hammel", "external_links": ["http://www.tribpub.com/privacy-policy-and-your-privacy-rights/", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-562866ff/turbine/ct-cubs-mets-nlcs-future-haugh-spt-1022-20151021", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-56286b84/turbine/ct-nlcs-game-4-photos-cubs-vs-mets-20151021"], "published": "2015-10-22T08:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T08:09:27.059+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
