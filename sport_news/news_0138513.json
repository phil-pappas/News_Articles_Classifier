(USATSI) Charlie Strong has maintained confidence in his team's ability, asking the Texas fans for patience as this group puts it all together on the field. The Longhorns looked like a Charlie Strong-coached team in Saturday's 24-17 victory against Oklahoma , pushing the Sooners around on both sides of the ball and winning one-on-one battles with a heightened level of physicality. \n\"I'm just so proud of our players and the way they came out and competed. They heard so much about how they didn't have any pride, and they battled back,\" Strong told ESPN after the game. \"I've been saying it, and I truly believe it: we have a good football team. We lost some, and I don't have an answer for last week, but come back next week.\"\nThe Longhorns got some breaks eaerly, and considering how two losses (Cal, Oklahoma State) came in heartbreaking fashion it seems some breaks are deserved for this group. After Marcus Johnson ran right through Oklahoma's arm tackles for the first touchdown of the game, Oklahoma fumbled the next kickoff and Texas was able to score again quickly to take a quick 14-0 lead.\nThat lead took a ton of presure off Jerrod Heard and Tyrone Swoopes and allowed the Longhorns to lean on a steady ground attack to power the offense. \nThat poor tackling effort, and really good run by Marcus Johnson, is worth another look. \n\nThree takeaways from Texas' big win on Saturday:\n1. Texas was the more physical team for most of the game . The Longhorns are banged up on the offensive line, have a lot youth playing on defense and yet still won battles in the trenches against Oklahoma throughout the game. Winning at the point of attack played into Texas' ability to build its offense off the ground game, totaling 313 yards at 5.5 yards per carry. Having an effective ground game kept Oklahoma's pass rushers at bay -- Jerrod Heard didn't face many third-and-long situations -- and helped Jay Norvell, as play-caller, set up some of the biggest explosion plays of the day for the Longhorns. \n2. Maybe Oklahoma isn't the best team in the Big 12 . The story on Oklahoma coming off a strong performance against West Virginia was that the Sooners could challenge Baylor and TCU in the Big 12. The Sooners moved into the Top 10 of the polls and showcased a nasty defense that many had been expecting to see all season. The Sooners are talented and have the potential to knock off anyone in the Big 12, but failing to beat your rival as a three-score favorite is not the mark of a title contender.\nThe offensive line was mauled by Texas up front, giving up six sacks and failing to spring explosive backs Samaje Perine or Joe Mixon for any runs of more than 15 yards. Between Mayfield running for his life against Texas' pressure and OU's inability to force a turnover or come up with the much-needed big play on defense this did not look like a team ready to beat Baylor. \n3. The tire fire has stopped, for now . The good news for Strong is that his win mutes some of the negativity around the program for a little bit. The Longhorns are off next weekend, then play Kansas State, Iowa State, Kansas and West Virginia (in Morgantown). While things are happy now, Texas needs to make a bowl game to avoid an offseason of rumors, reports and hot seats. That means going 3-1, or better, in that stretch of four games so that the season finale against Baylor is not a game the Longhorns need to win to make the postseason.\nTopics: Oklahoma Sooners , Texas Longhorns , NCAAF", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T19:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T23:04:01.629+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
