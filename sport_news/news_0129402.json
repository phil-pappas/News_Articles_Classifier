So we have to try to fix that and analyse why and what.\n\"This throttle issue is a brand new one...it worked perfectly for a long time so this is a surprise to everybody. But it will be fixed and will not happen again,\" added the Austrian.\nRosberg, now 73 points behind Hamilton, also retired in Italy with an engine failure while his team mate failed to score in Singapore due to a loss of boost pressure.\nWhile Mercedes team bosses and drivers were due to thank the assembled staff at the factory at Brackley in England, and the engine side at nearby Brixworth, they will want to waste no time in addressing the other issues.\n\"It is a strange one. We were looking so good on reliability then to have quite a few issues. It is surprising and it has gone worse and worse through the season especially in the last few months,\" said Rosberg.\n\"We must look into that again and continue to improve that area because it seems we have not made as big steps as we thought.\"\nMercedes have taken 12 wins in 15 races, with eight one-twos, but Ferrari have also closed the performance gap.\n\"Reliability, of course, is something we've focused on a huge amount over the last year and a half,\" said Hamilton after his ninth win of the season.\n\"For whatever reason...we are struggling or having a little bit more problems with it and Nico's been incredibly unfortunate to suffer the worst.\n\"I know we'll be working as hard as we can to rectify it and hope that in these next races we don't have a problem, but of course it is a concern for us.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T23:40:49.177+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
