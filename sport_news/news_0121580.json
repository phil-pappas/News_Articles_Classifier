He will be making his seventh career playoff start.\n\"It's a very talented group, a lot of power, a lot of experience,\" Ventura said of the Toronto offense.\nVentura has pitched seven innings of postseason baseball this year, giving up seven runs on eight hits while striking out 10.\n\"I think it's going to help him a lot,\" Royals manager Ned Yost on the experience Ventura gained in the playoffs during the Royals run last season. \"I think he's made great improvements from the beginning of the year on. And a lot of them were just learning how to deal through adversity and how to become a better professional. And I think he's learned those lessons really, really well.\n\"The quality of stuff is the same. I don't think he's gotten any better in terms of his talent, but as a professional and as a competitor he's gotten a lot better. He's matured a lot, which is a good thing. Young guys go through some tough times up here. And the more you endure it, the more you learn from it, the better off you're going to be.\"\nThe Royals' plan against Toronto is to pitch inside aggressively, which worked to perfection Friday. Ventura will have to follow Game 1 starter Edinson Volquez 's lead to be successful in Game 2.\n\"Again, it's not anything new,\" Ventura said. \"That's been part of our game plan from the very beginning against any team. We've got to establish the inside part of the plate and execute pitches. The fact that it's them, it's not a new approach to how we do things.\"\nIt will be a tough task Saturday, as Ventura faces Blue Jays lefty David Price . But for all his regular-season success, Price is still searching for his first postseason win as a starter. He is 0-6 with a 5.23 ERA in the playoffs as a starter in his career.\n\"No, I know it's going to come,\" Price said, when asked if he was under any undue pressure given his postseason record. \"I have a hundred percent confidence in myself. I know my teammates do, as well, and our coaching staff. This is part of it. You've got to be able to live in the moment. I want to be able to step up for my teammates and this organization and all our fans in Canada.\"\n  Royals' Edinson Volquez, Blue Jays' Marco Estrada to start ALCS opener Royals starter Ventura leaves game 5 ejected after Royals, White Sox brawl Ventura among 8 players signed by Royals", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T03:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T10:00:02.168+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
