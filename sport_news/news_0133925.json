Show Caption Previous Next \nVero Beach High School will be well represented during Tuesday’s 6-3A regional golf tournament, as both the boys and girls teams advanced through their district tournaments last week. \nThe boys shot a 291 to capture the District 16-3A championship, while the girls (344) finished second to Viera High School. \nLast season, the girls advanced to the state tournament, finishing seventh. After losing their two top golfers and hiring a new coach, it appeared they might be in for a rebuilding year. But the consistent play of juniors Sarah Noonan and Mary Kate Hiller have the Fighting Indians’ hopes for another state appearance still alive. \n“They’ve worked hard, all of them,” girls head coach Joe Kern said. “My goal (this season) was to teach them how to manage themselves and learn how to manage their games.” \nThe boys fell just short of advancing to the state tournament last year, missing the cut by nine strokes. Despite losing Treasure Coast Newspapers All-Area Boys Golfer of the Year Jake Leffew, the Fighting Indians returned this season fielding one of the deepest teams in the area. \n“We feel pretty confident that we’ll be one of the two teams to move on,” boys head coach Mark Cammarene said. “I’ve got a very deep team this year, which is nice. My number five man can be low, or my No. 1 man can be low.” \nVero Beach High School is hosting the 6-3A regional tournament Tuesday at Pointe West Country Club, 7500 14th Lane, Vero Beach. \nREGIONAL GOLF TOURNAMENTS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T23:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T01:18:24.347+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
