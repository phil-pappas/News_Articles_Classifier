However, Vietto’s goal means Rafael Benitez’s side remain behind Villarreal in second place. \nKarim Benzema continued his goalscoring form by opening the scoring after just nine minutes, with Keylor Navas preserving Real Madrid’s lead by saving a first-half penalty kick effort from Antoine Griezmann. \nReal Madrid looked set to claim all three points until Vietto finished from close range after good work from Jackson Martinez down the left and Griezmann in front of the goalkeeper. And Navas was required to make a save in stoppage time to keep the scoreline at 1-1. \n- \nFollow Joy Sports on Twitter: @Joy997FM.
