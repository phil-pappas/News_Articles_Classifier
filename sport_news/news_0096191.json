The goal represents Knudson's fourth of the year, good for the team lead. Duchscherer's assist marks his second of the season. \nThe Pack battled through two scoreless overtime periods before settling for the tie. State outshot the Irish 23-11 in the match, 22-5 through regulation, but ended up with just one score to show for the effort. The Wolfpack forced five Notre Dame saves to one, earning 10 corners to five for the Irish. \nWolfpack soccer's 1990 ACC Champion, Final Four squad was honored on field at halftime. \nCopyright 2015 North Carolina State University.
