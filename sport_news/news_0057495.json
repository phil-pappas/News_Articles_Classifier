(AP) Rafiq Douglas ran for a career-high 172 yards, Nehari Crawford hauled in a fourth-quarter touchdown pass and Duquesne held on Saturday for a 16-7 win over Robert Morris. \nTrailing 7-6 at the half, Duquesne (5-3, 2-1 Northeast) took the lead in the third quarter with a 44-yard field goal from Austin Crimmins , who also had kicked a pair of field goals in the second quarter. Dillon Buechel , who was 16 of 33 for 167 yards, padded the lead early in the fourth quarter with the 8-yard touchdown pass to Crawford, which was set up by Chris King's 40-yard catch. \nRobert Morris (2-5, 1-2) was held to just 84 yards passing but got a 5-yard touchdown run from Rameses Owens . Mathew Barr twice drove the Colonials into Duquesne territory late in the fourth quarter but threw his second interception of the game and gave up the ball on downs. 0", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T04:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T04:25:59.845+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
