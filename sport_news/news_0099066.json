The Marquette coach has yet to land a headliner for next year, but he’s got the program’s 2016 haul off to a promising start. On Tuesday, rising senior small forward Brendan Bailey issued a verbal commitment to the Golden Eagles.\nAdChoices “It's time to announce that I will be attending Marquette University to extend my career in Basketball,” Bailey, the son of former NC State and NBA player Thurl Bailey, wrote in a message posted to his Twitter account.\nBailey chose Marquette over Gonzaga, Michigan, Utah and San Diego State. The American Fork (Utah) High standout visited all five schools, including a trip to Milwaukee in August. Bailey initially committed to Arizona State in November 2014 but backed off after coach Herb Sendek was fired in March. Marquette reportedly extended Bailey a scholarship offer in early June, after the program hired former Sun Devils assistant coach Stan Johnson.\n“It’s just always good to know someone there,” Bailey told Scout.com on Tuesday. “Me and Stan are really close. He’s been recruiting me as long as I’ve been recruited. It’ll be good to get there and I already have a great relationship with coaches.”\n• GREEN: Big East preview: Villanova again the team to beat in 2015–16\nAt 6'7\", 190 pounds, Bailey is highly regarded for his shooting ability. “A player whose game is based on skill and finesse, Bailey does have to get stronger,” Eric Bossi, a national recruiting analyst for Rivals.com, wrote of Bailey in June. “However, because of his size and length, he could be a versatile player as more and more college teams move to non-traditional lineups.” Bailey averaged 14.1 points and 7.5 rebounds per game on the Adidas Uprising circuit this year.\nRivals.com currently pegs Bailey as the No. 48 player in the class of 2016, though he’s not expected to join Marquette until 2018 after serving a Mormon mission. The only other player in the class of 2016 committed to Marquette is Sam Hauser, a three-star small forward ranked the No. 133 player in the country who attends Stevens Point Area (Wisc.) Senior High. Basketball players can begin signing National Letters of Intent on Nov. 11.\nLast season, their first under Wojciechowski, the Golden Eagles posted a 13–19 record and finished 4–14 in the Big East. They were voted this week to finish sixth in the conference in 2015–16.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["https://marquette.rivals.com/content.asp?CID=1778461", "http://sports.yahoo.com/fau/basketball/recruiting/player-Henry-Ellenson-130527", "http://www.scout.com/college/basketball/recruiting/story/1601520-source-brendan-bailey-commits-marquette", "http://www.jsonline.com/blogs/sports/334844601.html", "http://www.bigeast.com/news/2015/10/13/MBB_1013152011.aspx", "http://www.jsonline.com/blogs/sports/320899131.html", "http://www.si.com/", "http://www.si.com/college-basketball/2015/10/19/big-east-preview-villanova-georgetown-kris-dunn-providence", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T22:48:04.198+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
