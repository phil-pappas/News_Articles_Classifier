Goalie Michal Neuvirth made 31 saves for his first shutout in 3Â½ years. The Flyers, under new coach Dave Hakstol, had a players-only meeting after their blowout loss Saturday. ... The Flyers have just 4 goals in their three games. ... The Hawks and Flyers split their two meetings last season with Philly winning 4-1 at home on March 25. ... Corey Crawford will start in net for the Blackhawks. Scott Darling will likely be in net Thursday against the Capitals.\nNext: 6 p.m. Thursday at Washington\n-- John Dietz \"He's a great motivator, really got the guys on the same page, especially in the latter half of the years that I was there,\" Toews said.\nThe 47-year-old Hakstol is the first rookie NHL head coach to come directly from the college ranks since Bob Johnson went from Wisconsin to the Calgary Flames in 1982.\nHakstol had great success at North Dakota, compiling a .654 win percentage and reaching the Frozen Four seven times in 11 seasons. His teams never won it all, though. Toews was on teams that finished third both times.\nIn addition to Toews, T.J. Oshie and Drew Stafford also played under Hakstol.\nToews believes the No. 1 reason it's so difficult for a head college coach to make the jump to the NHL boils down to the dynamics in the locker room. To go from coaching kids to coaching grown men who have been pros for three, five and 10-plus years is not an easy task.\n\"It's just a whole different animal in the way you talk and the way you treat your players,\" Toews said.\nThe Flyers finished sixth in the Metropolitan Division last season and then fired Craig Berube. They are off to a rough start so far, although they shut out the Panthers on Tuesday behind a stellar effort from backup (and now starting) goaltender Michal Neuvirth.\nAs for Toews, he said he's happy for his old coach.\n\"Obviously he had a great career at the college level,\" Toews said. \"So it's great to see him get an opportunity at the profession that all head coaches usually want to test themselves (at) and see what they can do at the next level.\"\nNot strange: Jeremy Morin wasn't happy with his role in Chicago last season and was subsequently traded to Columbus for defenseman Tim Erixon. Then, during the off-season, Morin was sent back to the Hawks as part of the seven-player deal that included Artem Anisimov and Marko Dano for Brandon Saad.\nHaving Morin in the organization could provide an awkward moment or two, but coach Joel Quenneville said that isn't the case for him.\n\"As players, situations change quickly,\" Quenneville said. \"It's never personal and the opportunity is real. This is a business that, sometimes as players you can't control everything. What you want to do is get back here as best you can.\"\nMorin is skating with Rockford, the Hawks' AHL affiliate, and has a goal and 2 assists in two games.\nSee the Cup: The Stanley Cup will be at Millennium Park's Jay Pritzker Pavilion Stage on Wednesday from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. Lines can begin forming at 8 a.m. west of the Jay Pritzker Pavilion. Viewers may take a photo with the Cup, but they must bring their own camera or smartphone. No professional photographers will be on site.\nHe said it: \"He either scores or he hits me with the puck.\"\n-- Scott Darling on whether there's anything a goalie can do to stop Patrick Kane on shootout attempts\nGet great articles like this sent to your inbox!
