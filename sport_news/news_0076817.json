Dust Devils pummel Parker 65-6: Economou, Anderson shine; River Valley will be preparing for Havasu showdown By RODD CAYTON The Daily News MohaveDailyNews.com | 0 comments \nMOHAVE VALLEY — Ryan Economou and Devin Anderson put on an offensive fireworks show Friday night, and the River Valley High football team stormed past visiting Parker High School 65-6. \nJacob Lee blocked two punts to set up scores for the 8-1 overall Dust Devils, who play at Lake Havasu High School on Friday for the Arizona Interscholastic Association Division IV, Section III title. \nEconomou threw five touchdown passes and opened the scoring with a 1-yard TD run just over two minutes into the game. \nAnderson scored three TDs, including an 8-yard catch and a 41-yard run in the third quarter. \nRVHS co-head coach and offensive coordinator Paul Duchaineau said he wanted to work on the passing game before then showdown with Havasu. \nHe said that Economou made a lot of smart decisions on which throws to make, and that the team’s receiving corps ran good routes. \nEconomou said that when he saw the pass-heavy, game plan, he thought, “I’m about to get a lot of touchdowns.” \nThe Dust Devils got off to a quick start, shutting the Broncs’ offense down after three plays and taking over within a step of the goal line after Lee blocked Marcus Drennan’s punt. \nEconomou scored on the next play. \nThe Dust Devils’ next possession ended with Pablo Sandoval intercepting Economou’s pass at the Broncs’ 1-yard line. \nOn the next play, Lee sacked Broncs quarterback Josh Golding for a safety. RVHS led 9-0 at 7:12. \nEconomou then ended a 45-yard drive with a 30-yard TD pass to Anderson 58 seconds later. \nLee blocked a punt on the ensuing possession, leading to Economou’s 10-yard TD pass to Tristen Dozier. RVHS was up 23-0 less than eight minutes into the game. \nDuchaineau said Lee has blocked at least one kick in each of the past four games. He declined to talk about the senior linebacker’s/fullback’s technique. \n“We’re opening holes for him,” he said. \nLate in the quarter, Economou hit David Larrabee on a 24-yard TD pass. \nA 24-yard screen pass to Anderson set up Walter Klock’s 1-yard run to make it 37-0 about two minutes into the second quarter. \nParker got on the board after starting with a short field due to a kickoff that went out of bounds and two personal-foul penalties. \nJacob Gottula scored on a 1-yard run to make it 37-6 with 6:38 left in the half. \nThe Dust Devils quickly answered with Economou’s 49-yard pass to Jesse Bravin, who bobbled the ball briefly before securing the catch and sprinting the last 25 yards or so. \nHalfway through the quarter, River Valley led 44-6. \nThe clock ran continuously for most of the second half. Lee closed out the scoring with a 17-yard carry that Duchaineau called a reward for his hard work on defense and special teams. \nBroncs coach Jeston Lotts said that the plays RVHS ran were no surprise, but that the Dust Devils’ execution made an upset unlikely. \nAnderson had high praise for the defense, which he said was aggressive and flew to the ball as co-head coach and defensive coordinator Mark Ruckle teaches. \nDuchaineau said the Dust Devils will ramp up the intensity of this week’s practices in preparation for the contest against the 9-0 overall Knights. \nLHHS, like River Valley, is 6-0 in section. \nThe Knights are ranked No. 4, according to the aiaonline.org ’s power-point system. \nThe Dust Devils are ranked No. 9. \nEconomou said he achieved one goal this week, namely sending his senior teammates out as winners in their last regular-season home game. \nNext up: defeating the Knights. \n“I’m excited about it,” he said. “I’ve heard they’ve been talking some smack. We need to go down there and beat them.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T09:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T12:22:29.397+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
