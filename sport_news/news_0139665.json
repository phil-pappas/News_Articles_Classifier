Dallas has lost four in a row.\n“We were a plus-4,” Coughlin noted as a key to the victory. “We played hard, we wanted it bad.”\nMost Read Stories Will Pullman and the WSU Cougars get ESPN's College GameDay?

Coughlin, 69, joined Hall of Famer Steve Owen as the only Giants coaches with 100 wins. And Coughlin also has 12 in the postseason, with those two championships.\nNew York snapped a five-game slide against Dallas, who will host the Seahawks at 1:25 p.m. Sunday, as Dwayne Harris ran back a kickoff 100 yards for the winning points in the fourth quarter against his former teammates. That boosted the Giants (4-3) into first place in the NFC East after Philadelphia (3-4) lost to Carolina (6-0).\n“We’ve been overdue for a long time,” Harris said. “Always one block away, one man away. Tonight it was blocked perfect. Anybody could have ran through that, the hole that was made.”\nDominique Rodgers-Cromartie had two interceptions, returning one 58 yards for a touchdown.\nNotes •Pittsburgh’s Landry Jones made his first NFL start in place of the injured Ben Roethlisberger and Mike Vick and threw for 209 yards and a touchdown, but he also was picked off twice and lost a fumble that helped end the game — a 23-13 win for Kansas City. Steelers coach Mike Tomlin said Roethlisberger, still out with a knee injury, was close to being ready to play, and that the quarterback should be ready to go next week against Cincinnati.\n• Tom Brady overcame New England’s shaky first three quarters by throwing for a pair of touchdowns in the fourth, and the Patriots defeated the New York Jets 30-23 to remain unbeaten. He completed 14 of 17 passes in the final quarter to overcome a 20-16 deficit and give New England (6-0) a two-game lead over the Jets in the AFC East. Brady was 34 of 54 for 355 yards overall and also had an 11-yard scramble on a third-and-10. With 15 yards rushing, he was the Patriots’ leading rusher for the first time in his career. “I should enjoy this, because it will probably never happen again,” said Brady, who threw the ball on all but nine plays — tying the NFL record for the fewest rushes in a win.\nSeattle Times staff", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T23:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T06:12:15.339+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
