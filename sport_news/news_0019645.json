Our athletes are not just civil servants but some are current national athletes and former national athletes. \n“With shuttlers like Iskandar Zulkarnain Zainuddin and Wong Choong Hann in our stable, we are confident of achieving the target,” he told reporters after an ACSG chef-de-mission (CDM) meeting, here today. \nThe meeting was chaired by ACSG deputy chairman Datuk Seri Zolkples Embong and Malaysian contingent CDM Datuk Zaiton Othman. \nThe ACSG will feature five sports, namely futsal, badminton, tenpin bowling, table tennis and golf and involve 550 civil servants from 10 Asean countries. \nMalaysia, hosting the inaugural ACSG as the Asean Chairman, will be represented by 60 civil servants who will participate in all five sports contested. \nThe event is organised by the Malaysia Civil Service Sports Council (Maksak) with the cooperation of the Ministry of Youth and Sports and relevant ministries and agencies. \nApart from ACSG, Malaysia will also organise two main events for the civil service of Asean member states under the theme ‘Towards A People-Centred Civil Service in Asean.” The two events are the Asean Heads of Civil Service Retreat in Cyberjaya on Nov 17 and the Asean Civil Service Innovation Conference at KL Hilton on Nov 18 and 19. — Bernama", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T12:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T12:59:44.367+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
