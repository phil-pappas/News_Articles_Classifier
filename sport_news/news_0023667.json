(Photo: John T. Greilick, Detroit News) \nAnn Arbor — Mark Dantonio rarely smiles.\nYou can imagine, then, how often the Michigan State football coach has the burning desire to bust a move.\nOn Saturday night, he had that desire — and let loose with some dancing in the middle of the visiting locker room at Michigan Stadium following the most improbable victory over the program's chief rival.\n\"He looked pretty happy in the locker room,\" quarterback Connor Cook said, smiling. \"I've never seen him dance like that, ever. He was doing some moves I've never seen him do.\"\nHit the Quan dad \nA video posted by Kristen Dantonio (@k10dantonio) on Oct 17, 2015 at 9:22pm PDT \nDantonio's daughter, Kristen, captured the moment on camera and posted video on Instagram following MSU's 27-23 victory, capped off by a fumble recovery for a touchdown as the clock struck zero.\nDantonio said this isn't the first time he's gotten down after a victory, though he usually saves it for the real special ones.\nBy his count, he's danced after the last two wins over Michigan, last season's Cotton Bowl, and after the Rose Bowl and Big Ten championship wins two years ago.\n\"We've been involved in some crazy deals, I guess,\" Dantonio said. \"So I have got experience.\n\"I was all right.\"\ntpaul@detroitnews.com \ntwitter.com/tonypaul1984", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T23:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T04:28:06.292+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
