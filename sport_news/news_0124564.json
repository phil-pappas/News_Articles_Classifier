Then we did some research and found out that a lot of teams make the playoffs with three losses. We said, ‘Buckle down.’ We said, ‘No excuses.’ We had to man up.”\n\nMarion-Franklin took another step out of that large crater it dug for itself with a 48-14 victory over Independence on Friday on Senior Night at home.\n\nLeeper, a 227-pound junior, ran for touchdowns of 11, 6 and 57 yards and three two-point conversions. Quarterback Anthony Hodnett threw for touchdowns of 65 and 27 yards, and Justin King ran for a 57-yard touchdown and two-point conversion.\n\nThe Red Devils (6-3, 5-1) are a sure bet to rise from ninth into one of the eight playoff spots in Division 3, Region 9. They remain tied for first place in the City South going into the final regular-season game at South.\n\nCoach Brian Haffele said a difficult schedule, which included nonconference losses to Beechcroft and Hartley, was the problem more than anything else.\n\n“This team could have folded,” he said. “The senior class found a way. We found ways to stay strong. We expected to be in the playoffs even when we were 1-3. But every Friday has been like a playoff game for us. This team has responded.”\n\nThe game plan on offense was for Marion-Franklin to pound Independence (6-3, 4-2) with a mammoth line of Chris Ayers (265 pounds), Landon Saulsberry (250), Jamari Walker (269), Demetrius Ervin (301) and Travis Geiger (302).\n\n“We knew we were bigger, strong and faster than them,” Walker said. “We had to man up play for play. We were intense, and that’s because practices were tough — intense. We had the right mindset.”\n\nThe big guys up front made the touchdown runs and two-point try look easy. \n\n“Our big men executed the gaps,” Leeper said. “We got big holes and got big yards.”\n\nHodnett got things started by hitting Derrick Cole for a 65-yard touchdown pass on the Devils’ first possession. Cole slipped a tackle at midfield and outraced the defense to the goal line.\n\nLeeper scored the second touchdown on an 11-yard run up the middle with 4:50 left in the first quarter. He scored standing on the two-point conversion run for a 16-0 lead.\n\nIndependence cut the lead in half on a 2-yard run by quarterback De’Zhan Townsend and two-point conversion pass to Malik Adams.\n\nBut Marion-Franklin scored on a 57-yard run by King out of the wildcat formation, a 27-yard reception by Allen McMichael-Roberts and a safety when Malik Bowers tackled Townsend in the end zone for a 34-8 lead at halftime. \n\nThe Devils’ defense was outstanding, with 12 tackles for loss in the first half alone.\n  \nmznidar@dispatch.com \n@MarkZnidar", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T03:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T08:25:26.401+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
