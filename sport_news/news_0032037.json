Aravind has 14 national titles and one international title to his name, but he admits his neighbours barely know what he does. \"When will you race (Valentino) Rossi?\" is one question that is often throw at him. He finds it annoying at times, but often sees the funny side of it. It stems from confidence. He is supremely aware that he is in an elite group of riders — only last week he won the Raid de Himalaya in the extreme bike category.\nThe raid is India's only motorsport event listed on the off-road rallies calendar of the Federation Internationale Motorcyclisme and involves both bikes and cars. When he crossed the line on Oct 17, Aravind was thrilled — not least because he clinched the title. \"I have a knack for not finishing rallies so this victory was really great,\" the TVS Racing rider, who edged out R Nataraj to win the title, told Mirror. \"The win was sweet because it eluded me last year. It was good to have led the rally all six days. The plan everyday was basic — just finish the race.\"\nIn 2014, Aravind had crashed out after running into black ice on the second day. \"I was blinded by the intensity I was putting into the rally,\" he said of last year's debacle. \"It was early in the morning and the sun hadn't risen yet. The route was between two mountains and it was dark. I was going a little faster than I should have been when I rode into the ice. When I crashed, I must have doing 90-100km. My focus at the start had been to charge full-steam. But then someone told me finish first. And that's how my fortunes changed.\"\nBorn in Manipal, Aravind's tryst with racing began when he used to race his elder brother, Prashanth, on his way to school on a cycle. He then turned out on a Yamaha RX 135, before beginning competitive racing — without his parents' knowledge — when he was studying in the St Aloysius College, Mangaluru. \"I then met an ex-TVS racer in a local race,\" Aravind said. \"He told me that the factory team takes part in national races and I would be supported if I do well. I fortunately won the first round of the Gulf dirt-track national championship and they took me in.\"\nBack in the city, it is back to work for Aravind, who trains at the TVS factory track in Hosur. \"I hope to get back to practice by this weekend,\" he said. \"I have round four of the Indian National Rally Championship coming up on the Oct 31 and Nov 1 in Chikmaga-luru.\" He leads overall.\nThe ultimate aim for Aravind, though, is to turn out at the Dakar Rally, where his inspiration CS Santosh finished an impressive 36th on debut earlier this year. \"I am working on participating in the Dubai nationals next month,\" he said. \"And also the Asian rounds starting in March 2016. But every off-roader wants to finish the Dakar. It's an accomplishment and dream come true for a rider. If time and funds permit, I will be at the Dakar soon.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T12:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T03:34:25.216+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
