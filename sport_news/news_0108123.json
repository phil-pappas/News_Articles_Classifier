The Canucks will pay a “large portion” of Tortorella’s pay each season, a source told The Dispatch. \nBut the Blue Jackets, per the NHL’s collective-bargaining agreement, will surrender a second-round pick in one of the next three drafts to Vancouver as compensation for the Canucks’ loss of Tortorella. \nTortorella, 57, will make his debut tonight when the Blue Jackets play the Minnesota Wild at 8 p.m. in Xcel Energy Center in St. Paul. \n“This is a pretty good challenge here, just the situation the club is in,” Tortorella said. “There are some good players in that room. It’s a good team. \n“It’s just ... gone. The confidence isn’t there. I think this situation — no points, this deep into the season — it will make our team better once we get through it.” \n>> Sign up for our free, daily newsletter on the Blue Jackets, get a chance to win tickets! \nTortorella met briefly with the Blue Jackets in the dressing room on Wednesday after a brief practice run by associate coach Craig Hartsburg. \nHaving accepted the job late Tuesday after the Jackets lost 4-0 to the New York Islanders, Tortorella flew to Columbus from New York on Wednesday morning and watched practice from high above the rink with members of the Blue Jackets’ front office. \n“The message was, ‘We’re going to do this together; we’re going to try and figure this out,’” Blue Jackets captain Nick Foligno said. “It’s not going to happen right away on Thursday, but it’s going to be a process. It has to be all of us on the same page. \n“He knows what this team is capable of, because he’s seen us play. We have to get back to that.” \nThe Blue Jackets have been the early surprise of the NHL season, for all the wrong reasons. \nAt 0-7-0, they’re the only club among the league’s 30 without a point, and they’ve allowed by far the most goals: 34. \nAnother loss in regulation tonight would give the Jackets the worst start to a season since the 1943-44 New York Rangers lost 11 straight. \nAll this happened in a season that started with such high hopes. Almost every NHL expert predicted that the Blue Jackets would make the playoffs; some foresaw them contending in the Metropolitan Division and even vying to win the Eastern Conference. \nThe Blue Jackets players and management spoke openly before the season about their high aspirations, beyond just making the Stanley Cup playoffs. \nThen, mysteriously, the Blue Jackets forgot how to play. \n“It’s a team that’s 0-7, but that’s a group that cares,” Tortorella said. “It’s an easy target right now, as far as where the club is, but it’s a group that cares. \n“Just a little bit of patience here, and allow us to chip away at it and get it back. To me, the most-important thing is developing an identity. And it will happen. Just be patient with us.” \nPatience is hard to find among Blue Jackets’ fans — two playoff berths in 14 seasons will do that — and it rarely appears in Tortorella’s vocabulary. \nHe won the 2004 Stanley Cup with the Tampa Bay Lightning; beginning in 2008, he coached the New York Rangers for five seasons, once reaching the Eastern Conference finals. \nAlong the way, Tortorella has become well-known for his acerbic interaction with the media and his confrontational approach with players. \nHis antics reached a climax during the 2013-14 season, his only one as coach in Vancouver, when he tried to charge into the Calgary Flames’ dressing room during an intermission in an attempt to get at his nemesis, Flames coach Bob Hartley. \nTortorella was suspended for 15 days (seven games) by the NHL; he later admitted his embarrassment. He was fired by the Canucks after the 2013-14 season. \n“Torts is good at pulling more out of guys,” said Blue Jackets center Brandon Dubinsky, who played for Tortorella in New York. “That’s one of his biggest strengths as a coach, and I think it’s one of the reasons he’s here now. He’s going to drag everybody into the fight. He’s going to get the most out of every guy. We all need that, and we’re all anxious for it. \n“It’s really a blue-collar style he teaches. He forces it on guys and holds them accountable. I’m sure you’ll see me benched at some point. He’s not afraid to do that to guys. It’s for the good of the team, and maybe the kick in the butt we need.” \nTortorella plans to meet with the players at 10 a.m. today before running his first practice. \n“I think there are capable players, and I think there are some leaders in that room,” Tortorella said. “That’s going to help. We have to be talking and helping one another through this year. \n“I do think we’ll get this going in the right direction quickly.” \naportzline@dispatch.com \n@aportzline Weekly Online Chats \nEach week (usually at 1 p.m. Wednesdays) during during the NHL season, Dispatch beat writer Aaron Portzline answers readers’ questions.
