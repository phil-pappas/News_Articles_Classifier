Posted: Wednesday, October 7, 2015 1:13 pm Kansas soccer program is strengthened through a move to Rock Chalk Park for first full season Skylar Rolstad | @SkyRolSports kansan.com Mark Francis wraps up a phone call with a new recruit. On a rainy Monday afternoon, his Kansas Jayhawks are practicing in preparation for Baylor — the team's third Big 12 matchup, happening on Friday. This particular recruit has told Francis, the team's manager of 15 years, that she will be committing to Kansas. “You’ll love the facilities here,” Francis said. It’s the first thing he mentions about the program in the call, although the recruit has surely seen them before. For the first full season, Francis’s team is playing at Rock Chalk Park, a 2,500 capacity stadium the Jayhawks call home. The grass that the Jayhawks practice on — about a 6.5 mile drive from Rock Chalk Park on the south end of campus — is impeccable. The team has played home games on it since the program began in 1995, and it's been up-kept since. The scoreboard still stands on the northwest corner of the field, but with the bleachers removed, the Jayhawk Soccer Complex no longer has the looks of anything more than a cutting-edge training ground. “It’s [a] completely different experience,\" said associate head coach Kelly Miller. \"Just the mentality of us training here [at the Jayhawk Soccer Complex] and going to a different park for games is a different mentality.\" The best thing to players is playing under the stadium lights. Miller said the professional environment afforded by Rock Chalk Park changes the mentality completely compared to the team’s previous digs. In the building process of the stadium, Frank Masterson, director of Rock Chalk Park, said a locker room close to the field was at the top of the team’s wish list for the new park’s features. Now, only feet from the locker room’s door is the walkway to the pitch. Miller said this attention to detail is what makes Rock Chalk Park feel like a professional environment. Initially, artificial turf was discussed for the stadium’s playing surface, but that discussion was short. “When we were building the new facility, [grass] was something that we talked a lot about to the architects,” Miller said. “There’s nothing like playing on grass.” Senior forward Ashley Williams played at the Jayhawk Soccer Complex for her freshman and sophomore year as well as half of her junior year. The complex and Rock Chalk Park aren't comparable for her. “It’s night and day from this field to that [Jayhawk Soccer Complex],” Williams said after practice at Kansas’ home-field-turned-practice-field. Kansan File Photo Masterson’s preparation for each game is a weeklong process that has been developed and refined over the last year. The field is mowed each day, and fertilizer is applied after two days. The day before the match, Masterson and his staff paint logos. The lines are then added to the field the day of. In Kansas’ Big 12 opener against Texas, a 2-1 loss, the full atmosphere was present for the first time at Rock Chalk Park; attendance was 1,074. “I was not too nervous until I stepped on the field before the first Big 12 game,” said freshman midfielder Parker Roberts. “After just stepping on the field you look around and you get some butterflies in your stomach. You definitely don’t have that anywhere else.” Roberts was one of the most immediate and direct fruitions of the park's luxury and atmosphere the facility creates. Roberts was recruited after Rock Chalk Park was built. She was one of the latest recruits of the 2015 freshman class, Miller said. Roberts’s club team played on the field in a match against the Jamaican national team, which helped her choose Kansas for her collegiate career. Roberts was recruited by almost every Big 12 school, including West Virginia, which is currently ranked fourth in the nation. Francis and Miller hope to use Rock Chalk Park to build the program, but the full benefit of the change hasn’t been realized yet. “A lot of the freshmen have contributed and done really well, but the other thing is that the recruits we’ve brought in on visits during the home games [are] just totally impressed,” Francis said. “Not just with the facility but with the atmosphere of the game.” Recruiting in soccer begins very early. Most players will have decided where they are headed after their sophomore year. Most of Kansas’ current freshmen were recruited with the promise that they would play at Rock Chalk Park but not the guarantee it would have the gameday atmosphere it has proven to have. Freshmen like Roberts were shown renderings and drawings of the park before signing with Kansas but didn't really get a feel for the finished product until they stepped on the pitch. This season is the first time the coaching staff can bring recruits into games at Rock Chalk Park. “The ‘17 and the ‘18 class will be the first kids that actually got to see a game there live,” Francis said. “And that’s probably the first class that is really going to be influenced by actually seeing it.” — Edited by Abby Stuke \nWho: Kansas Jayhawks vs. Baylor Bears \nWhat: Women's soccer \nWhen: Friday, Oct. 9, 7 p.m. \nWhere: Rock Chalk Park — 6100 Rock Chalk Drive, Lawrence, KS 66049 \nWho: Kansas Jayhawks vs. Oklahoma Sooners \nWhat: Women's soccer \nWhen: Sunday, Oct. 11, 1 p.m. \nWhere: Rock Chalk Park — 6100 Rock Chalk Drive, Lawrence, KS 66049", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-07T21:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T12:28:20.513+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
