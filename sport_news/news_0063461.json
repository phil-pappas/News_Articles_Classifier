It gives me a chance to see what the kids coming off the bench can do.” \nKonawaena jumped out to an 8-0 lead in the first set, forcing Christian Liberty to call a time out. Chanelle Molina, as she has done all season, put the Wildcats up early with a couple of well placed kills. \n“Chanelle is a firecracker,” Keawekane said. “When she puts her mind to it, it is effortless how she plays.” \nTaiana Tolleson also added a pair of points off net shots. Celena Molina was on the service line and put Konawaena up by nine before a serve floated out of bounds for the first point for the Canefire. \nAfter a quick turnover, The Wildcats got the ball back and pushed the lead to 20-1 as Christian Liberty struggled to return the serves of McKayla Ventura. \nThe Canefire got their first offensive point on a kill down the middle of the court by Chantal Koon. Teammate Joy Rimel added a point on a ball that hit the top of the net and landed in Wildcat territory. \nKonawaena allowed two more points near the end of the set, but put the game away on a McKenna Ventura cross-court kill. \nKeawekana began to sub in a lot of his players at the start of the second set. Christian Liberty took a 1-0 lead off a misplayed ball by Konawaena, their only lead of the match, but the Wildcats bounced back with 12 straight points behind four kills by Rashai Kailiwai. \n“Rashai stepped up and really impressed me,” Keawekane said. “She had nice sets and did exactly what she was supposed to do. She will be a force for the playoffs.” \nLeisha Sesson led the Wildcat run from the service line. \nKonawaena emptied the bench during the middle of the second set and Christian Liberty managed to make a run, closing the gap to 17-12. The Wildcats gave up most of the points with shots out of bounds or miscommunications. \nCherilyn Molina entered the game to serve eight straight points as Konawaena took a 2-0 match lead. \nThe Konawaena starters took the floor once more to start the third set and Chanelle Molina quickly set the pace with a shot down the line. The Wildcats led 7-0 before the Canefire picked up their first point. \nChristian Liberty showed fight, making one last effort to get back into the match by outscoring the Wildcats on a 4-1 run, but Konawaena pulled away from there to advance to the semifinals in Hilo on Thursday.
