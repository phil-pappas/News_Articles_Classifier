But the season-ending fractured fibula that former starter Will Montgomery suffered last week gave him time to practice with the first team during the week.\n\"I had a good feeling about it,\" Grasu said. \"Even though I was inactive the (first four weeks), I was preparing like I was playing.\n\"These guys, the O-line, the whole offense accepted me. They brought me in with open arms and made me feel comfortable.\n\"When we're out there, there's no panic for any of us.\"\nMatt Forte, who had game bests with 71 yards and 18 carries, said the rookie recovered well.\n\"Probably pregame jitters,\" Forte said. \"He's a rookie, first time starting and not only did he have a (346)-pound nose guard on him, but it's his first time being out there.\n\"Once he settled down and (Matt) Slauson took him under his wing and got him calmed down and talked to him, he got back into his groove, and we started moving the ball a little better in the run game in the second half.\"\nGrowing up: Marquess Wilson has picked up a lot of the slack left by the absence of Pro Bowl wide receiver Alshon Jeffery, who has been inactive the past three games.\nThe Bears also were without their other starting wide receiver, Eddie Royal, against the Chiefs.\nBut Wilson, a seventh-round pick in 2013 out of Washington State, had his second straight 6-catch game, getting 85 yards Sunday after he had 80 yards a week earlier.\n\"He has kind of grown up; he's kind of had to,\" quarterback Jay Cutler said. \"He doesn't have a choice. He has to make plays. We kind of holler at him during the week, and Saturday we have to let up on him a little bit getting ready for Sunday.\n\"But he's reacting. He's making plays for us and making big-time catches for us.\"\nWilson's 22-yard touchdown catch with 3:05 left to play got the Bears to within 17-12. Told he did a nice Alshon Jeffery imitation on his TD, Wilson didn't agree.\n\"I'm not going to take anything away from my guy,\" he said. \"We're expected to make those plays. I don't think they were spectacular catches. They were just catches.\"\nDown and out: Bears linebacker Shea McClellin left with a knee injury in the third quarter and did not return.\nCornerback Terrance Mitchell did not return after suffering a hamstring injury, and Jacquizz Rodgers had an elbow injury that prevented him from finishing.\nChiefs running back Jamaal Charles left in the third quarter with what is believed to be a serious knee injury and did not return. Chiefs coach Andy Reid said: \"It probably looks more like a torn ACL than anything.\"\nYoung and helpful: The Bears started three rookies: safeties Adrian Amos and Harold Jones-Quartey and center Hroniss Grasu. Jones-Quartey tied for second on the team with 4 solo tackles.\nRookie nose tackle Eddie Goldman also had 2 solo tackles playing in the D-line rotation.\nSitting it out: Bears inactives Sunday were wide receivers Alshon Jeffery (hamstring) and Eddie Royal (ankle), safety Antrel Rolle (ankle), offensive linemen Jermon Bushrod (concussion) and Patrick Omameh (ankle) and defensive lineman Will Sutton (elbow).\nGet great articles like this sent to your inbox!
