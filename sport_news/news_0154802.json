The decision seemingly ends Platini's bid to succeed Blatter as FIFA president in the emergency election in February.

(AP Photo/Michael Probst, file) \nAnother presidential hopeful, Chung Mong-joon, was suspended for six years in a separate case and FIFA secretary general Jerome Valcke was banned for 90 days. \nThe suspensions can be extended by up to 45 days. \nBlatter's suspension brings a sudden halt to a 40-year career that had survived waves of scandals until he was placed under criminal investigation. \nLast month, Swiss authorities turned up at Blatter's office at FIFA headquarters and interrogated him. The criminal case centers on Blatter allegedly misusing FIFA money by making a $2 million payment to Platini, who was questioned as a witness. \nBlatter was also questioned by Swiss investigators about broadcasting contracts sold to former FIFA vice president Jack Warner in 2005 that were supposedly undervalued. \nPlatini's suspension could have the most far-reaching implications. The former France great said he submitted his formal candidacy to stand in the Feb. 26 election to replace Blatter on Thursday morning. \nChung, a former FIFA vice president, was found guilty of breaches relating to South Korea's failed bid for the 2022 World Cup. Valcke had already been put on leave last month after being the subject of allegations over a deal for black market sales of tickets to 2014 World Cup matches.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T14:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T15:13:53.375+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
