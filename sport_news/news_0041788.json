Proceeds from his appearance will go toward STEP Industries and the Mooring Programs, non-profit organizations in the Fox Cities that help those struggling with alcoholism, substance abuse and other chemical dependency disorders. \nHerren, who has been sober for seven years, didn’t hold anything back. A schoolboy legend at Durfee High School in Fall River, Massachusetts, Herren told how he first started using cocaine at the age of 18 as a freshman on the campus of Boston College. \n“Chris, put a little on your finger, it’s not going to kill you,” said Herren, recalling a fellow student urging him to try cocaine for the first time. “I was 18 years old and scared to death, but I told myself that I’ll try it and never do it again.” \nBut he did and it led to his eventual expulsion from Boston College after he failed three drugs tests. He failed another at Fresno State, but was able to resurrect his basketball career under legendary college basketball coach Jerry Tarkanian and was the 33rd overall pick in the 1999 NBA Draft by the Denver Nuggets. \nHerren’s drug use escalated in 2000 when he was traded to the home-state Boston Celtics and he began using painkillers, primarily high amounts of Oxycontin. \n“In 1999, I had never heard of Oxycontin,” said Herren. “I had no idea that it was going to change my life. I bought it for 20 dollars the first time I tried it. That 20 dollars eventually turned into 20 thousand a month for that little yellow pill. I had just been traded to the team I grew up with. It should have been a dream come true, but it was the start of a nightmare. There was a game that I had started at home and I should have been excited to hear the public address announcer announce my name during the starting lineups. But I didn’t even hear it. I had no recollection of it. That little yellow pill cost me a lot more than 20 dollars.” \nHerren played just two seasons in the NBA before playing six more overseas. Heroin eventually became his drug of choice and it led to a car accident in which paramedics believe he was actually dead for about 30 seconds. \nHerren told the audience the story of how he turned down a friend’s offer one night to do heroin despite constant urging and phone calls from the friend. The next day that person was found with a bullet in his head, the victim of an execution. \n“It was probably the first time in my life I said no to drugs and it saved my life that night,” said Herren. \nDespite that frightening incident and even though Herren had a wife and two children at home, he continued to struggle with drugs. He was in and out of treatment centers before finally getting sober in August of 2008. \n“I think my faith is probably the biggest thing in my recovery,” said Herren. “There was a day when a counselor asked me to play dead. He told me to pretend that I was in a car accident and I was dead and my kids were burying me. I thought about it and at the time it was probably my best option. I prayed about it and have been sober ever since.” \nHerren, 39, gives presentations across the country, discussing his struggles with his drugs and his recovery. He addressed the Green Bay Packers a few years ago and speaks each year at the NFL’s rookie symposium. His family has stayed with him and his 16-year-old son is a standout basketball player in Rhode Island. \nBut Herren still pays the price for his past addictions. \n“There’s been games when my son goes to the free throw line and the kids chant, ‘Heroin! Heroin!,’ said Herren. “I have to listen to kids taunt my son because of my struggles.” \nIn addition to his speaking engagement, Herren oversees the Herren Project, an organization that helps those struggling with addiction. \n“We sent 300 people to treatment this year for free,” said Herren. “I am who I am today because of people who have showed me how to do it. If it wasn’t for people who took the time to share their recovery with me, I wouldn’t have recovered myself.” \nDuring his struggles with drugs and alcohol, Herren even attempted suicide. He says he shares his story to let others know that there is hope. \n“We get hundreds and hundreds of emails from kids who are contemplating suicide,” said Herren. “I think it’s important that they know there is a voice out there and it’s a voice who has recovered. There’s two sides of what I present. There’s a message of despair and a message of hope.” \nThe large crowd attending Thursday’s event seemed to hang on Herren’s every word. \n“I thought it was great,” said Joe La Chapell, the girls’ basketball coach at Appleton East and a father of three. “He was open and genuine. I remember watching him on TV in his college years at Fresno State. Plus, I read his book and saw the ESPN documentary. Being the public figure that he is he has a lot of credibility.” \nTim Froberg: 920-993-1000, ext. 423, or tfroberg@postcrescent.com; on Twitter @twfroberg 1 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://post.cr/1Ll6our TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T07:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T09:03:27.886+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
