Medics said three others were still trapped under the home's ruins in the Zeitun sector south of Gaza City.\nIsrael said it had targeted \"two Hamas weapon manufacturing facilities\" in response to two rocket launches at Israel during Saturday, as well as a number of attempts by Palestinians to violently break into Israel from Gaza.\nOne of the rockets had hit an open field in southern Israel and the other was intercepted, while nine Palestinians were killed during the border clashes with Israeli soldiers.\nSunday's deaths come as violence between Israelis and Palestinians, which began in east Jerusalem and the West Bank several days ago, threatened to spiral out of control.
