Izzo empathizes with Dantonio, rejects motto Graham Couch , Lansing State Journal 8:50 a.m. EDT October 9, 2015 As injuries take control of MSU’s football season, Spartan basketball coach recalls pitfalls of similar plight two years ago Tom Izzo completely understands Mark Dantonio’s plight with injuries, and how sometimes a coach can lose control of what could have been a special season. What happened to Izzo two years ago is happening to Dantonio now. (Photo: LSJ file) No. 4 MSU (5-0, 1-0 Big Ten) at Rutgers (2-2, 0-1) When: 8 p.m. Saturday TV/Radio: Big Ten Network/WJIM 1240-AM and WMMQ 94.9-FM \nEAST LANSING — When Tom Izzo sees Mark Dantonio these days, he instantly recognizes the helplessness and frustration he once saw in the mirror. \n“I can see it about as loud and clear as you can see it,” Izzo said. \nMichigan State’s basketball coach knows too well the sense of losing control of a season once positioned to be special. \nJust two years ago, the team Izzo considers the second-most talented of his tenure — behind only his 2001 squad — won 29 games, a Big Ten tournament title and reached the NCAA tournament regional finals. \nAnd not much fun was had. \nMSU came up short . Keith Appling’s wrist, Adreian Payne’s foot, Branden Dawson’s hand, Appling’s confidence — the Spartans never were again as whole as they were at the beginning. \nMSU’s football program has that feel now. Still ranked No. 4, but without several the of the pieces that led to that billing, Ed Davis and Vayante Copeland through Dennis Finley and RJ Williamson, with Jack Conklin, Kodi Kieler, Josiah Price and Macgarrett Kings in-between — a rash of injuries threatening the Spartans’ dreams. \nAll of it compounded by soaring expectations and an unforgiving system. Couch: MSU and its fans still chasing happiness amid winning \n“In basketball, we have a saving grace, if some things go wrong, you can come from a 3 seed, a 5 seed (in the NCAA tournament) and still survive,” Izzo said. “As a 4 seed, we were the President’s pick (to win a national title). In football, you have to be a 1 seed (among the top four teams) or you’re not even in.” \nCollege football’s four-team playoff has created a toxic all-or-nothing environment for programs like Michigan State. It’ll remain unhealthy — with many teams essentially seeing their seasons end in October — until the playoff goes to eight teams, restoring oomph to conference championships while crippling the relevancy of snarky and ill-informed September prognostications. Couch: New college football playoff already doesn't work \n“In basketball, you have to win six in a row to win the national championship,” Izzo continued. “It’s hard to be consistent for six in a row with that kind of pressure on you. (In football) you’ve got to almost win 12 in a row.” \nSome would argue that’s part of the beauty of college football — every week matters. But it’s hard to see the beauty of weekly elimination when you don’t have two healthy functional offensive tackles on your roster. \nTwo of MSU’s injured tackles, starters Conklin and Kieler, are expected back soon, perhaps as early as Saturday night. Price and Kings could also return, giving quarterback Connor Cook two seasoned and critical targets. The others are done for a while or for the season. \nBut if you’re keeping score in the infirmary, the offensive depth chart has a chance to again read as it did in August. A year ago, when it was intact, it was a record-setting unit, one that might be capable this season of carrying MSU beyond its defensive shortcomings. \nThat’s if it all comes back together easily.

It temporarily left MSU with a mess on its offensive line. (Photo: Rod Sanford / Lansing State Journal) \nFor Izzo’s crew two years ago, which reassembled bit by bit, it didn’t. \n“I remember the game I got Payne back, we played Nebraska here and we absolutely stunk,” Izzo said of a 60-51 loss on Feb. 16, 2014. “And we had played without him for eight games. \n“Now you’ve got to learn to play with them again. Like an offensive line, they play as a unit. You lose two here and you get one back and he’s not as good right away, it’s brutal.” \nMore than challenges of reassembly, Izzo laughs at the notion that a coach is supposed to pretend an injury sub is just as capable as the player in front of him. \n“I told Mark, quit being macho. Quit using that phrase, ‘Next man up,’” Izzo said. “That’s what he’s got to say to you guys. That’s what he’s got to say to the general public. Did you ever think if the next man up is replacing somebody, he’s replacing a guy that was better than the next man up, or that guy would be the other guy.” \nChew on that paragraph for a minute. \n“Oklahoma, Ohio State, Michigan, Nebraska, back when they had 100 guys on scholarship and they were three-deep at every position, ‘Next man up’ was a good line,” Izzo continued. \nIn recent MSU football lore, this steadfast mantra has come true too often to run back toward logic now. Kyler Elsworth, for example, made perhaps the most iconic tackle in program history filling in for Max Bullough and, a year earlier, Trae Waynes was a bowl-game injury replacement for Johnny Adams. \nBut Izzo’s point is a refreshing stray from coach speak. \nFor this MSU team, there is no choice but to turn to the next man at a few positions. But with that, expectations for style should be tempered. In this playoff system, style points are unimportant for an unbeaten power conference team anyway. Couch: Big Ten bowl results highlight inept evaluations \nIn college football, like hoops, it’s now about surviving and advancing. And for an MSU team both battered and mending, weekly survival is the only outcome of consequence. That’s the four-team playoff at work. \n“That’ll become the new football motto, which it was never like that before,” Izzo said. “You never heard that term in football — survive, advance ... stay healthy.” \nDantonio is losing the fight with the last of those. At this rate, he won’t control the former two. \nFor Izzo, a memory stirs. \n“We had very similar issues,” Izzo said. “But to me, his is compounded tenfold. \n“They just went from the hunter to the hunted, too. Let me tell you, boy, that’s something. \n“It’s all hitting (the program) at once. You know what, we’re still standing. That’s pretty damn good.” \nContact Graham Couch at gcouch@lsj.com.
