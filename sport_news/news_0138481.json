Comment   Writer Posted Oct. 24, 2015 at 1:19 PM Posted Oct. 24, 2015 at 1:19 PM HAVANA The North Fulton Wildcats closed out the year at 5-4 after beating the Havana Ducks 50-7 Friday night. With their one-game above .500 record, coach Elliott Craig's club won't be in the playoffs as they had just 22 playoff points before their season-ending victory. The winners took the lead early as Jordan Stewart scored on a 28-yard run just 1:13 into the game. The conversion was no good. Craig's club scored their second touchdown at the 6:02 mark, still in the first quarter. Cylas Krieger was the man with the ball in the end zone as he found paydirt from 15 yards out. Once again, the conversion failed. Krieger accounted for his team's last TD in the quarter, scoring on a 5-yard run with no time left on the clock. His 2-point conversion run increased his team's lead to 20-0. The Ducks were the first team to score in the second quarter as Ian Foutch scored on a 5-yard run. The PAT closed the hosts to 20-7. However, the Ducks got no closer as the Wildcats pitched a shutout the rest of the game while scoring 30 more points. With 1:18 left in the second quarter. Lucas Krieger scored on an 18-yard run. Cylas Krieger ran in the 2-point conversion. The Wildcats' final touchdown before the intermission came on Lucas Krieger's 20-yard run. Austin Bradford ran in the 2-point conversion. The final points in the game came in the third quarter. Stewart produced a 47-yard TD run at the 11:01 mark before the run failed on the conversion. Then with 7:10 left on the clock, Bradford raced in from 26 yards out. Cylas Krieger had the 2-point conversion. The winners had 269 net yards on the ground. Cylas Krieger rushed for 117 yards and Lucas Krieger rushed for 106 yards. Stewart finished with 89 yards. Nathan Wood had 134 yards rushing for the Ducks, who end the year 1-8.
