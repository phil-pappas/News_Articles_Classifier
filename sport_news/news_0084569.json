Dallas won the game 108-93. (Stephen M. Dowell/Orlando Sentinel) (Stephen M. Dowell / Orlando Sentinel) Josh Robbins Contact Reporter Orlando Sentinel Former Magic coach Jacque Vaughn returned to Amway Center on Friday \nJacque Vaughn returned to Amway Center on Friday night for perhaps the first time since the Orlando Magic fired him as their coach and also dismissed two assistant coaches on Feb. 5. \nVaughn attended the Magic's preseason finale against the Memphis Grizzlies in a formal role: as the San Antonio Spurs' new pro scout. The Spurs hired Vaughn for the role last month. Pro scouts spend most of the season on the road, gathering intel on future opponents. \nBefore the game, Vaughn said hello to a few old friends and former players. Vaughn and third-year Magic guard Victor Oladipo embraced and spoke a bit before Oladipo did his usual on-court shooting routine. \n\"It was fun just to see him again, talk to him, catch up with him, see how his family's doing,\" Oladipo said. \"He's doing good, and that's what really matters.\" \nFamiliar faces \nMagic fans inside Amway Center on Friday night could be forgiven if they glanced at the Grizzlies and suddenly felt overwhelmed by déjà vu. \nThe Grizzlies bear a strong Magic influence. Orlando Magic fire Jacque Vaughn Orlando Sentinel columnist Mike Bianchi and Sports Editor Roger Simmons talk about the firing of Orlando Magic coach Jacque Vaughn. Orlando Sentinel columnist Mike Bianchi and Sports Editor Roger Simmons talk about the firing of Orlando Magic coach Jacque Vaughn.

The move reunited Barnes and Carter, who played on the 2009-10 Magic team that finished with the NBA's second-best record and advanced to the Eastern Conference finals, falling in six games to the Boston Celtics. \n\"Matt and I, we talk about it every now and then,\" Carter said. \"Of course we remember that year, losing to Boston in six. It was a special year.\" \nLee played just one season with the Magic and earned a starting role on the 2008-09 team that reached the NBA Finals. Shortly after the Finals ended, Orlando traded Lee, Rafer Alston and Tony Battie to New Jersey for Carter and Ryan Anderson . \nAlthough he grew up in Indiana and went to college in Kentucky, Lee makes his permanent offseason home in Orlando. \n\"Once you come to Florida, there's nothing like it,\" Lee said. \"The sun shines every day. It may rain for about five minutes, but the sun is right back out. Then I can get in my car and go in either direction and find myself on the beach somewhere. I didn't have that growing up, and it's always nice to go walk outside and see palm trees.\" \nIn February 2013, the Milwaukee Bucks sent Udrih, Tobias Harris and Doron Lamb to Orlando for J.J. Redick , Gustavo Ayón and Ish Smith . \nUdrih played 27 games for the Magic. In August 2013, he signed a free-agent deal to join the New York Knicks. \nUdrih's Magic tenure was so brief that Lee was surprised when a reporter told him Udrih once played in Orlando. \n\"Beno was here?!?\" Lee exclaimed. \nBack in action \nC.J. Watson started at point guard for the Magic while Elfrid Payton missed his fifth consecutive exhibition game because of a sore right hamstring. \nWatson, 31, was one of the Magic's key offseason acquisitons. \nHe entered Friday averaging 5.4 points, 5.8 assists and 1.8 turnovers per game. He hadn't shot the ball well, going just two for 13 from beyond the arc. \n\"I definitely want to get everybody involved before I get myself involved,\" Watson said. \"But I still want to be aggressive and be a threat out there so guys can guard me [and I can stretch the floor]. I haven't made shots like I wanted to, but I know they'll come. I've just got to keep at it.\" \nWatson will enter the regular season as a 38.3 percent career shooter from 3-point range. \n\"We're confident when we start from the opener he's going to make shots,\" Magic coach Scott Skiles said. \"But has run the team well, and his assist-to-turnover ratio and steals is good.\" \njrobbins@orlandosentinel.com .
