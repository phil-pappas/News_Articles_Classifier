He saw it on film and, if that wasn't enough, heard about it from his coaches.\n\"I kind of caught myself these last couple games playing hesitant and not just letting loose, overthinking things and not just playing football,\" Orchard said after practice on Thursday, \"and so (defensive coordinator Jim O'Neil and Orchard) talked earlier today and I agree with him and my position coach, (outside linebackers coach) Brian Fleury, and so I just need to go out and play ball. Do what I'm here to do.\"\nHead coach Mike Pettine praised Orchard and fellow rookie Xavier Cooper on Thursday for their lack of mental errors, but still sees things he considers part of the \"learning curve.\"\n\"We just want (Orchard) to cut it loose a little bit more,\" Pettine said. \"Sometimes when a guy gets out there, he gets afraid to make a mistake and that slows him down a little bit where they are thinking too much. Pick your aiming point and go.\"\nCooper, who recorded his first career sack on Sunday, said the physical aspect of the game at the NFL level is an area where he needs to continue to grow.\n\"I think at this level it's being more violent, being more physical,\" Cooper said. \"You can never be too physical out there. That's the game. Just continue to bring that force in practice so it can translate to the game, being as violent as I can.\"\nPettine stressed Cooper's pad level as an area for improvement moving forward.\n\"Some guys have the tendency to -- once they get the stalemate -- put the periscope up and try to find the ball,\" Pettine said, \"and that is where they find themselves losing ground whereas we have to get knocked back first, but we are pleased with where they are and it is about where we thought they would be.\"\nOne thing Orchard, who recorded 18.5 sacks during his final season at Utah, understands is that, in the NFL, improvement has to come fast.\n\"It's tough, because there's no time for a redshirt year,\" Orchard said. \"You can't sit around and wait for me for a year to finally blossom and do good. I just need to go out and play like my hair's on fire and do well.\"\nBack on the grind: The Browns are hoping to get Robert Turbin , claimed off of waivers prior to the first game, back on the field this week. Turbin participated in team drills for the first time this week.\n\"It's a little early to tell, but he had a good day yesterday,\" Pettine said. \"Most of his reps were on the scout team. I think he'll tell you that he's not there yet, but he's close.\"\nTurbin said that his ankle started to \"loosen up\" as practice went on Thursday. He said last week that he hoped to return to the field this Sunday in Baltimore or next week at home against Denver. That hasn't changed.\n\"My goal is to be able to play some this Sunday,\" Turbin said. \"Obviously (head athletic trainer) Joe (Sheehan) and those guys and coach Pett will make the decision, ultimately, this weekend. I am hopeful. They are hopeful and we will just see how the rest of the week goes with practice.\"\nInjuries: Turbin joined defensive lineman Desmond Bryant (shoulder), linebackers Karlos Dansby (ankle) and Scott Solomon (ankle) and cornerback Joe Haden (ribs/finger) as limited in practice on Thursday. Defensive backs Donte Whitner (illness) and K'Waun Williams (concussion) returned to full participation. Safety Tashaun Gipson (ankle), running back Shaun Draughn (back), wide receiver Brian Hartline (ribs/thigh) and linebacker Craig Robertson (ankle) did not practice.\nGipson was seen at the Browns facility in a walking boot.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T02:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T06:18:33.724+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
