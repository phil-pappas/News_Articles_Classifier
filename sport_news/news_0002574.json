His No. 12 Cubs jersey hangs in stores all over Chicago. \nThe rookie slugger, who plays with a calm that belies his experience, takes it all in stride. But Schwarber, a former IU player, is looking forward to his postseason debut. \n\"I got an idea of kind of what it will be like,\" he said, \"but then it's probably going to be nothing close about what it's going to be like.\" \nSchwarber gets to find out next week when the Cubs make their first playoff appearance since he was a teenager growing up in Middletown in southwestern Ohio. Schwarber and teammates Kris Bryant, Addison Russell, Jorge Soler and Javier Baez are among a stellar group of big league rookies who could determine which teams play deep into October. \n\"I'm going to really count on kind of the veterans who've all been there and kind of give us the low down on what it's going to be like and how to prepare,\" said Schwarber, who had two hits and walked twice in a 4-1 victory at Cincinnati on Tuesday night. \"They say it's a different feeling every time, so I'm looking forward to it personally. I want to get that feeling.\" \nSchwarber had 16 of the 653 homers for rookies heading into Tuesday's games, the highest such total for a single season in major league history, according to STATS. The 5,727 hits and 9,164 total bases for rookies in 2015 also rank among baseball's best classes, same for the 409 wins and 6,692 strikeouts. \nSchwarber got an opportunity to play more when veteran catcher Miguel Montero sprained his left thumb in July. \nSchwarber batted .348 with five homers and 15 RBIs in his first 21 games after the All-Star break, including a memorable night near his hometown when he connected twice and drove in four runs in a 5-4 victory against the Reds. \nHe played in some big games down the stretch as Chicago secured its first playoff berth since 2008, and he is hoping that experience will pay off in the postseason. \n\"You got to know that it's the major leagues, every possible situation is probably going to happen,\" he said, \"and you've just got to stay level and keep your head in the same spot through it all.\" Read or Share this story: http://indy.st/1KMcAd7 TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T23:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T00:07:26.942+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
