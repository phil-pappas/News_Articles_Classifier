(Andy Abeyta/The Gazette) ¬ Most Popular By Jason Brummond, correspondent October 9, 2015 | 11:04 pm \nIOWA CITY – Dan Sabers has Iowa City High on a roll before the biggest game of the year. \nThe Little Hawks held Burlington to only 69 yards and five first downs in a dominating 38-0 shutout Friday night at Bates Field. \nCity High (5-2, 3-0) has won five straight games, but the real test is next week: a showdown with fifth-ranked Cedar Rapids Washington (6-1, 3-0) for the district lead. \n“There have been a lot of great games here and we’re hoping to make that a great game next week,” Sabers said. “We want to keep going and I think it’s good timing to play a great squad like Wash. We know we’re going to have to be at our very best.” \nCity High, which clinched a playoff berth after a rare postseason miss last season, racked up 465 yards and led 31-0 at halftime. \nQuarterback Jared Taylor, starting again for the injured Nate Wieland, threw for 191 yards and two touchdowns – including a nicely thrown fade to Jason Jones for a 34-yard score. \nSabers stressed defense in practice this week after City High gave up 21 points in a win last week against Cedar Rapids Prairie. \nThe Little Hawks gained more first downs than Burlington (1-6, 0-3) had yards until midway through the second quarter. The Grayhounds had seven three-and-outs as City High earned its first shutout since 2012 – a 33-game span. \n“Tonight we did a much better job,” Sabers said. “We certainly emphasized that.” \nThe Little Hawks dominated this one from the start. \nBryce Frantz ran for a 21-yard touchdown on City High’s opening drive. The junior added a 4-yard TD run at the end of the first quarter. \nEarlier in the first quarter, City High tight end Charles Johnson caught a short flip pass from Taylor and rumbled 44 yards for the score. The 6-3, 250-pound Johnson broke at least three tackles on the play, including two down the sideline in the open field. \nMacio Gordon added a 63-yard TD run in the third quarter that started the continuous clock.
