The discussion was well-timed, given the recent upward tick in Oregon's unemployment rate and economic trends that are squeezing the middle class everywhere, and especially in high-growth cities like Portland.\nOregonian editorials Editorials reflect the collective opinion of The Oregonian/OregonLive editorial board, which operates independently of the newsroom.

Earlier this week, the Oregon Employment Department reported that the state lost jobs in September , ending a 36-month streak of gains. The unemployment rate inched up from 6.1 to 6.2 percent. Economists at the forum generally were optimistic that the economic recovery will continue for another two or three years, though likely at a slower pace. But they did not project a significant change in the types of jobs created. Since the recession ended, the bulk of new jobs have been at the top and the bottom of the pay scale.\nKeynote speaker Jim Tankersley, a McMinnville native who writes about the economy for the Washington Post, used material from a 2014 Post series he helped author to describe how the middle class declined and how it might rebound. Many of the reasons for the decline are well-known by now: the loss of manufacturing jobs because of both technology and foreign competition, declining wages for those without college degrees and concentration of high-pay jobs in the technology and financial sectors. Tankersley pointed out a less-discussed trend, a steady decline over the past 30 years in the rate at which new businesses are being started.\nTankersley avoided politics in his presentation. But there's little doubt that some recent political decisions, as well as ones currently under discussion, have hurt the middle class more than they have helped.\nConsider what has happened since the financial crisis of 2008. Congress passed a financial reform bill that was supposed to rein in risky behavior on Wall Street and improve consumer protections. There's little evidence that much has changed on Wall Street. But it has become much more difficult for borrowers to qualify for a mortgage, and those who do qualify must provide a mountain of paperwork. Other types of credit, including small-business loans, also have become more difficult to obtain. The notable exception is student loans, which have increased to the point that they limit the ability of even the most educated workers to buy homes. In other words, the big loser has been the middle class.\nThe current push for a $15 minimum wage could end with similar results. The lowest-paid workers would get a pay raise. Highly skilled workers, particularly those in technology-related fields, still would command top dollar. And those in the middle likely would get squeezed as the pool of money available for raises is redirected elsewhere.\nRebuilding the middle class will be a long process with few, if any, shortcuts available, and policymakers are at an important crossroads. Do they try to force employers to pay more for bad jobs – an approach that at most will push some families into the lowest strata of the middle class – or do they do the harder work of finding a way to create more good jobs? To re-create an America that looks like the second half of the 20 th century, someone has to find the missing ingredient for generating more jobs that deliver value to employers and a family wage to workers.\nMaking it easier to start a business is a good first step. If financial reform has made it harder to get a loan to start a business or buy a home and has done little to change Wall Street behavior, it has failed. That appears to be the case, and adjustments should be made before more harm is done.\nAlso, as Tankersley noted, someone needs to find a way to help people specialize in what they are best at and find employers who need those skills and can compensate them appropriately. That's a much bigger challenge than cleaning up financial regulations – which will be far from easy. It certainly requires improvements in the education system from pre-school through college, including an increased emphasis on counseling and vocational education. But that's just one step, not the full answer.\nIf nothing else, everyone needs to stop pretending that increasing the minimum wage and cracking down on Wall Street amount to anything more than Band-Aids. Those politically popular treatments won't even stop the bleeding, much less cure the ailment.\n--The Oregonian/OregonLive editorial", "external_links": ["http://oregoneconomicanalysis.com/2014/04/02/update-job-polarization-in-2013/", "http://www.washingtonpost.com/sf/business/2014/12/12/why-americas-middle-class-is-lost/", "http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/07/15/AR2010071500464.html", "http://econforum.uoregon.edu/"], "published": "2015-10-15T23:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T16:06:30.820+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
