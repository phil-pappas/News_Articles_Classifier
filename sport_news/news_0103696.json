Defense continues to make big plays in 25-13 win over Cardinals Lucy Schaly/The Times \nLawrence Timmons celebrates a fumble recovery in the first quarter. \nPITTSBURGH — On a day in which the Steelers had several former players from the 2008 Super Bowl Championship team that beat the Arizona Cardinals in Super Bowl XLIII, it was fitting the guy who made the most memorable play in Super Bowl history that night made the play that turned the game around for the Steelers’ defense in their 25-13 win over the Cardinals at Heinz Field Sunday. \nLinebacker James Harrison, whose 100-yard interception return helped the Steelers capture their sixth title that night in Tampa, forced a fumble early in the third quarter when he laid a vicious hit on Cardinals receiver John Brown. \nThe Steelers, trailing 10-6 at the time, went on to score four plays later to give them a lead they never relinquished. It was all part of a day in which Harrison had four tackles and recorded another sack to run his total as a Steeler to 71.5. \n“They did an out pass, I’m just trying to get out there and make the tackle,” Harrison said. “The DB (Antwon Blake) is the one that forced him (Brown) back inside and (I) just put as much force into it as I can and knock the ball loose.” \nHarrison’s fumble recovery is just one of the many big plays the Steelers’ defense made that helped turn a game that statistically should have been a blowout into a game in which the Steelers won by two scores. \nAlthough, statistically, the Steelers defense did not have a great day, they “held the rope” as coach Mike Tomlin put it, making the plays when they needed to to once again find a way to win. Cardinals quarterback Carson Palmer was 29-for-45 for 421 yards, but was intercepted twice, by Lawrence Timmons and Mike Mitchell. \n“We gave up a few big plays here and there, but we tightened it up to a field goal instead of scoring six and seven,” Harrison said. “They got a bunch of yards, but the biggest thing that counts is the scoreboard at the end.” \nMitchell’s interception came in the end zone with 2:25 remaining and the Steelers leading 18-13, all but sealing the win. For Mitchell, the play was equal parts of athleticism and film study. \n“I knew he (Palmer) was going to throw it,” Mitchell said afterwards. “That was a play that we had seen on film. That play was able to come back to my memory. I just used my instincts. I just trusted it.” \nSunday’s win is not only a gratifying one because the Steelers beat one of the best teams in the league to keep pace with the Cincinnati Bengals, who beat Buffalo to improve to 6-0, but because the Steelers defense has carried a chip on their shoulder throughout the entire season. \nAs many have pointed to the defense as the weak link on the team, they were able to make the impact, or “splash” plays as Tomlin calls it, to help them in their last three wins. Of course, winning is nice, but proving the naysayers wrong makes it even better. \n“Some guys have taken it to heart, the coaches especially,” linebacker Lawrence Timmons said. \n“No one wants to give us any respect,” Mitchell said. “We’re gonna take it by force.” \nOn Sunday, the Steelers’ defense did just that.
