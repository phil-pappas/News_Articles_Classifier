I thought it would, but things happened. And it's understandable. \n\"But it was very impressive how they competed, how they fought hard. And the atmosphere that they had there with all the fans coming out for the blackout. So it was definitely a good game. I was very impressed by what I saw, especially on the defensive side of things.\" \nWATCH: 4-star cornerback Patrice Rene's Rutgers commitment ceremony \nRene, who watched the game from his high school dorm, got even more specific as to what stood out to him. \n\"Their mentality, how they came into the game with all the adversity that they had going on, you know, with the coaches and everything, with coach Flood not being able to be there,\" he said. \"Just how they came out. They had a plan and stayed focused. \n\"They had that family atmosphere. They wanted it. You could tell that they wanted it. On the defensive side of the ball, they are very physical, which I like a lot. Definitely, you could see that they have a little bit of holes in the secondary. That's something they can work on. But they are definitely on the right path.\" \nRene admits to hearing often from UNC, Virginia Tech, Wisconsin, Nebraska, and Wake Forest. And although he has kept his ears open, he's still committed to the Scarlet Knights. \n\"These types of things, they kind of happen. It comes with it,\" said Rene. \"I know coach Flood and I committed to him and his staff for a reason. And I'm being strong and supportive of them. But at the same time, I wanna be smart with what I do. So I am committed right now, but I'm talking to other schools to keep my options open. But as of now, I'm definitely committed to being a Scarlet Knight.\" \nTodderick Hunt may be reached at thunt@njadvancemedia.com . Follow him on Twitter @TodderickHunt .
