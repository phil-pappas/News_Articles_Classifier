Mich (Photo: Rod Sanford | Lansing State JJournal) \nOne play lifted a team from the very bottom to the very top, and the team that was going to be at the very top now sits at the very bottom. Sports, I tell you. \n(Weekly disclaimer: This is not a power ranking. This is how the Big Ten teams and their fans are feeling at the moment). \n1. Michigan State. Some fans are going to worry more about being properly credited for the win at Michigan, and some are spending the week sniping at U-M fans about shoulda-been/shouldn'ta-been penalties and crying to media folks who don't blindly support their position on every play of the game. No matter. This is as close to pure elation as a program and its fans can get after game seven. The Spartans are unbeaten. The dreams are intact. The U-M game unveiled a quarterback and No. 1 receiver playing like pros, an offensive line getting healthier, a defense that gave up 230 yards and 10 first downs with two promising freshmen at safety, and a kicking game … well, it did win the game! The Spartans were in position to win at U-M despite missing their All-America center (Jack Allen), top cornerback (Vayante Copeland), top linebacker (Ed Davis), top safety (RJ Williamson), starting running back (Madre London) and another starting cornerback (Darian Hicks). Allen, London and Hicks will be back soon. This team clearly has some intangibles to it. And these fans have enough YouTube videos of U-M fans weeping to enjoy for hours. BTN airs inside look at final play of U-M game \n2. Iowa. New Kirk – much better than New Coke! That came out in 1985, by the way, the same year the first \"Back to the Future\" movie was released. And though many of the fake Cubs fans in the world hail from Iowa, they should be able to move on rather quickly from the only inaccuracy I can find in \"Back to the Future II.\" See, Iowa has made it three Big Ten teams with a legitimate chance to make the College Football Playoff, and in that 40-10 win at Northwestern the Hawkeyes looked the part. Games ahead at Indiana and Nebraska could be tricky, but this should be a 12-0, top-10 team in Indy, playing a game that can vault it into the top 4. \"Great Scott!\" \n3. Ohio State. J.T. Barrett comes in against Penn State, the Buckeyes go on a tear to blast James Franklin and Co. back to State College, and Barrett finally wins the starting job. That's good news for Ohio State fans who have been calling for him for weeks. Also good news: The Buckeyes could use any number of folks with the initials J.T. (Justin Timberlake? John Travolta? Joe Theismann?) and get to the Nov. 21 game against MSU unbeaten. \n4. Nebraska. It's but a crumb of positivity in a desert of misery for the Cornhuskers, but it felt like a gut-busting afternoon at the Old Country Buffet. The Cornhuskers dominated Minnesota up front on both sides of the ball. Tommy Armstrong Jr. and Terrell Newby played like stars. Defensive tackles Vincent Valentine and Maliek Collins are monsters. It can't be easy to think of how easily this team could be 7-0 instead of 3-4, but at least there are some games left. \n5. Wisconsin. It's not that a 24-7 win over Purdue was especially impressive – it wasn't. And the Badgers really needed the Wildcats to take a bite out of the Hawkeyes, which sounds like a fierce wildlife scenario. But this is still a team on course to finish 10-2, and some future help from the Hoosiers and Cornhuskers against the Hawkeyes isn't out of the question. What are Hoosiers and Cornhuskers again? \n6. Illinois. You didn't play, but you're 4-2 with a chance to follow up an upset of Nebraska and sorta-near upset of Iowa with an upset of Wisconsin. Plus, you don't have to hear any more of this Northwestern garbage! \n7. Rutgers. What an incredible win at Indiana, with 28 straight points, 22 in the fourth quarter, to prevail 55-52. Chris Laviano overcame his Turf Mary against MSU to put up huge numbers, and Leonte Carroo showed again that he's one of the best receivers in the nation. He also showed up on the sideline late in a walking boot. That's not ideal with Ohio State visiting next. Hey Joe: Mailbag on lucky wins, cheering in the press box \n8. Maryland. Not playing. It's better for everyone. \n9. Northwestern. Well, it hasn't been pretty the past couple weeks – that's Michigan and Iowa 78, Northwestern 10. And now everyone in Chicago is looking for something to do other than booing the Bears, mourning the Cubs and pretending to be longtime Blackhawks supporters. Can you fill that void, 'Cats? \n10. Penn State. Sure, Penn State was made to look like the JV by Ohio State, not a team soon to challenge in the Big Ten East. And now Pat Narduzzi is rolling at Pitt and taking shots at the Penn State play calling. But have you noticed that Temple is ranked and unbeaten entering tonight's big game at East Carolina? Kind of puts that season-opening Penn State loss to Temple in a different light, right? Wait, how many teams in the state of Pennsylvania are better than Penn State?! \n11. Indiana. The public outcry over the latest setback in Kevin Wilson's tenure is bound to last until that first Yogi Ferrell jump shot tickles the twine. That would be Nov. 3, in an exhibition game against Ottawa. You only have to pretend for a couple more weeks, Hoosier Nation. \n12. Purdue. Not playing. It's the best way to avoid falling to 1-7. \n13. Minnesota. Mitch Leidner plays out of his mind. The Gophers lose by 23 at home to 2-4 Nebraska. This team is extremely versatile in its displays of bad football. Couch: Sizing up the CFB playoff - Spartans, Big Ten and beyond \n14. Michigan. Some fans are going to worry more about being properly credited for the near-win (non-win?) against MSU, while sniping at MSU fans and crying to media types, to be as miserable as they should be. But it's impossible to keep the haunting alternative reality from crossing those minds forever. What if Blake O'Neill catches that snap and gets off any kind of punt? The Wolverines are well into the top 10. In position to win the Big Ten East. A strong playoff contender. The toast of college football. The best team in the state, having relegated State to also-ran status in what was supposed to be Sparty's dream season. And all that Harbaugh hype for the past 10 months? It would have seemed like a passing mention compared with what was about to happen. National coach of the year awards? They wouldn't have gone to him, they would have been named after him. But you know, this is still a surprisingly good team with a chance to do a lot of things and OH GOODIE THE FUMBLE RETURN IS BEING REPLAYED AGAIN, LET'S WATCH IT ONE MORE TIME. 55 CONNECT 7 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://on.lsj.com/1RZDOjm TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T00:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T19:56:32.042+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
