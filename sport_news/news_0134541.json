By the end of the night, however, he had amassed 124 yards on the ground and 301 through the air. \nDefensive end Jordan Willis said the defense was disappointed after allowing the two long scoring plays late in the game. \n“It’s frustrating because it’s been two weeks now that we needed to make a stop on defense and we didn’t make it happen,” Willis said. “Then they get those big plays - the long pass to Doctson and the zone read — those are kind of heartbreaking because you need to make them earn that touchdown, and we just gave that to them. That hurts, but in the end you have to deal with it and move on to the next game.” \nIn addition to containing Boykin and his running attack, the Wildcats benefited from a pair of turnovers caused by linebacker Elijah Lee. \nAfter playing almost exclusively as a situational pass rusher last year as a true freshman, Lee transitioned into an every-down role this season and happened to be in the right place twice to pick off Boykin. \nThe first came in the second quarter and led to a K-State touchdown four plays later that gave the Wildcats a 28-17 lead. \nThe second pick came in the third quarter as Boykin threw low and missed his receiver, with Lee getting under the ball. K-State didn’t score following the turnover, but did pin the Horned Frogs at their own 10-yard line after a three-and-out. \nSnyder said the turnovers were much needed. \n“He reacted well — that was a key element,” he said. “One of them was a poor throw and he did a nice job. I’m proud of him, I know that.” \nThe pick in the second quarter was Lee’s first career interception. \n“It’s very tough to prepare for a guy like that,” Lee said of Boykin. “You never know if he’ll take off or throw the ball. To get two picks off of him was nice, but at the end of the day we lost, so those two picks don’t really mean anything at this point in time.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T08:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T10:36:56.051+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
