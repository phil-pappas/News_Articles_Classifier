Everest. “Everest” attempts to tell the story of one of the all-time worst disasters on the world’s tallest mountain, when a wicked storm hit in May 1996, killing eight climbers and injuring many others. Of course, this story has already been told with aplomb in Jon Krakauer’s runaway best-seller, “Into Thin Air.” Krakauer was actually up on the mountain as part of a team led by mountaineering legend Rob Hall and saw the devastation firsthand--bad luck for a human being, but pretty great fortune for a writer. Having been enthralled by the book when I read it many years ago, I must advise, if you’re even remotely interested in this tragedy, read the book--it’s gripping and excellent. The film mostly follows the team led by Hall (played with alacrity by Jason Clarke), but it also finds time for Scott Fischer (Jake Gyllenhaal), another climbing rockstar, and his team. (Both Fischer and Hall ultimately perished in the tragedy.) We watch Hall and his team arrive in Nepal, acclimate to climbing, make their push to the summit, and try to get back down alive. One thing the movie does adroitly is explain to lay individuals how one goes about trying to climb a peak like Everest, the inherent dangers, and the reasons people chase the summit like Jay Gatsby pursued Daisy Buchanan. Hall pioneered the business of leading people on Everest expeditions--you paid him to help guide you to the top. This was lucrative, and others, like Fischer, soon followed, but it’s also inherently dangerous, as it presents a conflict. When someone shells out a munificent sum of money for you to get them to the top of Everest, you’re going to feel responsible for delivering. Unfortunately, there’s a very limited window to try and summit Everest--for only a couple weeks out of the year is it possible--and many factors, from weather, to the way climbers are responding to the hike, determine if it’s prudent to make a run. The guide has to be able to say, “No, we’re not going to try it, it’s too dangerous,” but you can see how that might be difficult with so much money on the line. The film posits that Hall buckled to that pressure and contributed to the loss of life. Early in the movie, when one of his team members starts carping about how he paid Hall to get him up the mountain, Hall corrects him, informing him, no, he’s paid to get him up and down, safely . (People tend to overlook the crucial, yet pivotal, aspect of descending the mountain, but not Sir Edmund Hillary, the first man to summit Everest; years after his feat, some conjecture arose that perhaps Hillary wasn’t first to the top, that some other mountaineering master, like climbing pioneer George Mallory, who died on Everest, had done it first, but perished on the way down, and Hillary explained, \"To mountaineers, it's one thing getting to the top, but another getting back to the bottom. I'll settle for that.\") In the moment of truth, when Doug Hansen (John Hawkes) so desperately wants to reach the summit, Hall capitulates, even though they’re well-past their alloted “window” for safe summit. They both pay for the gamble with their lives. Page 2 of 3 - I wish I could tell you the practice of checkbook climbing has abated since the ‘96 tragedy, and others, like the death of 16 Sherpas last year, but, in fact, it’s only gotten worse. At least the members of Hall’s team were reasonably experienced climbers, like Yasuko Namba, who had already climbed the highest mountains on six continents and needed only Everest for her final leg; she did summit, but died in the storm on the way down. Since ‘96, even less-competent climbers have ventured to the mountain; sadly, if you have a big enough wallet, you can now find some guide willing to try and carry you to the top, no matter how much you shouldn’t be up there. In the film, Fischer dismisses Hall as “a hand-holder,” saying all Fisher’s climbers can reach the top with only minimal assistance from him, and if they can’t, they don’t belong on the mountain in the first place. Seeing the members of Hall’s team endure their acclimatizing hikes, where they climb partially up the mountain to acclimate their bodies to the thin air and conditions, was interesting for me. The movie also does a quality job of illustrating just how onerous and dangerous--one of Fisher’s men impresses on him that the mountain always gets the last word-- climbing Everest remains, even with all the advances in science, equipment, and technology, and that serves as a reminder why what Hillary and his Sherpa companion, Tenzig Norgay, did was one of the two greatest sporting accomplishments of the 20th Century. They reached the top Everest in 1953, when no one had done it, when many thought it wasn’t even possible, that the human body would simply capitulate at that height. As Clarke’s Hall explains in a monologue, the human body simply isn’t meant to function at roughly the cruising altitude of a passenger jet; when you get up that high, you are literally already dying, which is why that altitude is referred to as the “death zone.” So, with all the attendant danger, why do it? Why is it such a dream to summit Mt. Everest? Well, much of the truth lies in Mallory’s oft-repeated line, “Because it’s there.” Mountaineering, climbing Everest, is unalloyed; there’s a mountain there, the tallest in the world, let’s climb to the top--it speaks to everything that is elemental and instinctual in humanity, our need to challenge, excel, and surpass in pure child-like fashion. Even though many have made it to the top since 1953, summiting Everest remains a legacy-cementer, like winning an Academy Award or a Super Bowl. If you accomplish any of those types of achievements, it’s in the first line of your obituary--”Ryan Anderson, who climbed Mt. Everest, died Monday at age...,” or, “Academy-Award winning actor Ryan Anderson died Friday at...,” or “Ryan Anderson, who won a Super Bowl as quarterback of the Miami Dolphins, died Tuesday at...” Page 3 of 3 - If you do see plan on seeing “Everest,” see it in a theater--yes, it’s one of those movies. The majestic mountain scenes are the real star of the show, and you need to see that on a massive screen. The film loses gravity and momentum when it strays from the mountain and into the home lives of its characters, but the story and scenery are entertaining enough to warrant a 60--plus--rating on the 20-80 scale.
