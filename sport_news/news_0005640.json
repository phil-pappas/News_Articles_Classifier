The Owena Waves are second on the log, five points adrift of leaders Enyimba who face a tough away trip to Oriental rivals, Heartland, in Owerri on Sunday. Warri Wolves sit in third place, one point behind Sunshine Stars. A win for either side will increase their chances of winning the title especially if Enyimba lose against the Naze Millionaires. Odunlami told completesportsnigeria.com that he and his colleagues know the importance of the game and will give their all to ensure they leave Warri unscathed. “The game against Warri Wolves is very important and we must give our best to ensure we don’t lose against them,” the Super Eagles defender told Completespoersnigeria.com. “Every game is like a final now until the end of the season. “To win the league, we must be prepared to play anywhere and get positive results.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T10:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T10:48:33.330+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
