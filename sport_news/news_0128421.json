Instead of moving forward with someone who had differing baseball views, Dipoto will start his tenure in Seattle with someone he chooses. \n\"Everything we do is as a group,\" Dipoto said. \"This isn't an indictment of Lloyd. This is a representation of what we would like to build going forward. That is what we'll do.\" \nMcClendon's firing was far from a surprise and came less than a week after the Mariners concluded a disappointing 76-86 season. Seattle started the year with expectations of contending in the A.L. West and reaching the postseason but instead finished in fourth place in the division. \nDipoto was hired during the final week of the regular season to replace Jack Zduriencik and said he would take his time evaluating whether McClendon would return. McClendon was under contract for the 2016 season. \nDipoto said he has great respect for McClendon but realized in meetings this week and last that their baseball philosophies would not be the best match. \n\"This was an opportunity to come into an organization and create a vision, and I feel like this is the best way to do that,\" Dipoto said. Advertisement \nDipoto came to Seattle after leaving behind a rocky relationship with the Angels and manager Mike Scioscia over the summer. Scioscia was already entrenched when Dipoto was hired in Los Angeles. \nMcClendon was 163-161 in his two seasons with the Mariners. Yankees: Manager Joe Girardi went to his office for the first time since New York was eliminated in the wild-card game Tuesday with a 3-0 loss to Houston. After wasting a seven-game A.L. East lead and finishing six games behind Toronto -- the largest blown lead in Yankees history -- New York's return to the postseason after a two-year absence lasted nine innings. \"I did what I thought was right every day. The bottom line is we didn't win, so that's going to be questioned,\" Girardi said. \"People thought that I could have done better. I understand that, and so you live with it.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T05:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T05:21:06.049+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
