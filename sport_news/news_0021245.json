He climbed the flight of stairs to the second floor of the football complex 12 times last year. \nWith each trip, Prescott’s responses evolve more from unfiltered college student to robotic coach speak. \n“I don’t know why you guys still ask for me,” Prescott joked with reporters Tuesday evening. \nThe vanilla answers don’t offer much insight into the fifth-year senior’s season. His teammates and coaches offer another point of view. \n“Last year, he was a big playmaker,” MSU coach Dan Mullen said. “He made a lot of plays out there on the field, maybe some flashier plays, but I think his control of the game is so much better this year than last year.” \nPrescott is no longer listed among the favorites for the Heisman Trophy, according to Bovada sports booking. He had odds of 7/1 in January and 20/1 when the season opened. \n“I think he is much better this year,” Mullen said. “The production numbers might not be as high for him. He might not have been making these spectacular plays, but he makes some plays out there on the field that he wouldn’t have been able to make last year. \n“I’m not talking about running over a safety and diving into the end zone. I’m talking about he’s getting to a fourth progression and getting the ball out of his hands to a guy that’s wide open on the field. I think that is a real progression that he’s made as far as becoming a quarterback instead of just a playmaker.” \nPrescott has 356 fewer rushing yards so far this season. His passing numbers are down 125 yards. At this point last year, the Haughton, Louisiana, native had accounted for 23 touchdowns. This year, he has 11. \n“The numbers probably aren’t as good as they were last year, but he’s making plays,” MSU quarterbacks coach Brian Johnson said. “Like big time quarterback plays, where he’s getting through stuff extremely fast, and his third, fourth and fifth reads.” \nThrough six games, Prescott has attempted 26 more passes this year compared with his junior season. The quarterback only played a half against Northwestern State and three series last week against Troy. His completion percentage is up three points and he hasn’t thrown an interception. \n“Last year, it might be him saying I’m going to go try to make a big play to change the whole game around,” Mullen said. “Now, it’s I’m out here making sure we have to do what it takes to win the football game. I think that growth and that maturity is huge.” \nJohnson added: “I think everything has really just slowed down for him. He’s in complete control in every situation. Nothing fazes him. He’s got an even-keeled demeanor, not too high, not too low. He just goes out there and does and takes cares of his responsibilities.” \nIn his final season at Mississippi State, Prescott has his deepest collection of weapons on the outside. Fred Ross has 35 receptions. De’Runnya Wilson has 22 catches. \nThrough six games last year, Wilson led the team with 18 receptions. \n“I think Dak’s arm has improved tremendously. He’s been wonderful,” Ross said. “There’s times where Dak puts it in such a nice spot you have to catch it.” \nNo wide receiver would notice Prescott’s improved accuracy more than Ross. The duo spent every day this summer running routes on Mississippi State’s practice fields. \nRoss could break MSU’s all-time single season reception record this season with a strong second half. It won’t be because of Prescott’s desire to help set another school record. \n“He goes through all his reads,” Ross said. “He’s not afraid to just go through read one, two, three and four. Last year, I think it was kind of one, two, three and tuck and run.” \nMississippi State’s running backs had 14 receptions at the mid-season point last year. This year, they have 26. \nInstead of pulling it down and running, Prescott is more likely to drop it off to a running back. \n“He keeps his eyes downfield more,” offensive lineman Justin Senior said. “When we run those play-action passes and he scrambles, he keeps his eyes downfield to find targets instead of just running. I think that’s really upped his game.” \nThe pass to Brandon Holloway in the flat won’t earn Heisman Trophy votes, but it will turn the heads of NFL scouts. \n\"He’s going to make a lot of unspectacular plays he wouldn’t have made in the past and not many guys in college football would make,\" Mullen said. \"But when you watch and study the film, you say wow, that’s pretty great a quarterback can do that even if it’s only a 7-yard play.” \nContact Michael Bonner at mbonner@jackson.gannett.com.
