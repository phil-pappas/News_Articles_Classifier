The coach blamed a mixture of alcohol and painkillers for his odd conduct, which included slurred speech and even blurting out an expletive before telling the team “Fight on,” the Los Angeles Times reports. After players said he showed up intoxicated to a practice this weekend, Sarkisian was asked to take an indefinite leave from coaching.USC Athletic Director Pat Haden said he determined the coach wasn’t healthy after speaking with him.“I called Steve and talked to him. It was very clear to me that he is not healthy,” Haden said, according to the LA Times . “I asked him to take an indefinite leave of absence.”One USC student is still hopeful about Sarkisian’s recovery.“Here at USC, we say ‘fight on,’ and so, like that’s something that I know he’ll keep in mind though whatever he’s got to deal with personally, and what our boys are going to keep in mind as they transition with their new coach,” the student said.Offensive coordinator Clay Helton will take over as interim coach for the 3-2 Trojans.
