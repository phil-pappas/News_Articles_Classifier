Several other outlets reported Monday that Spurrier was set to retire. \nThe press conference is set for 12 p.m. ET/ 11 a.m. central time. \nESPNU is televising the press conference. You can stream ESPNU here . PROGRAMMING ALERT: @ESPNU will cover the Steve Spurrier retirement press conference LIVE at 12ET. pic.twitter.com/lcX5xvDFOJ — ESPNU (@ESPNU) October 13, 2015 \nTo check out the live stream of the press conference, watch below or check out WJHL . \nSpurrier, 70, is in his 11 th season at South Carolina. He is 86-49 with the Gamecocks, including three straight 11-win seasons from 2011-13. \nA person close to the situation told The Associated Press on Tuesday that South Carolina co-offensive coordinator and offensive line coach Shawn Elliott will be the interim Gamecocks coach the remainder of the season. The person spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because the school has not announced Spurrier's decision to retire or who will be the interim coach. \nAfter the news broke Monday night, Alabama coach Nick Saban told ESPN he was sad to see the Head Ball Coach go. \n\"I hate it for Steve and hate it for college football,\" Saban said. \nSouth Carolina slipped to 7-6 in 2014, and is 2-4 this season heading into Saturday's home game with Vanderbilt. The Gamecocks are 0-4 in the SEC, including a 45-24 loss to LSU last Saturday in a game that was moved to Baton Rouge following extensive flooding in South Carolina. \nSpurrier won the Heisman Trophy as a quarterback at Florida in 1966, and later spent several seasons playing in the NFL. His first head-coaching job came with the USFL's Tampa Bay Bandits in 1983, and he got his first college head-coaching job at Duke in 1987. \nAfter three seasons with the Blue Devils — including a share of the ACC title in 1989, Spurrier returned to his alma mater in 1990. He won six SEC titles — four straight from 1993-96 — and the 1996 national championship in 12 seasons with the Gators, leaving Gainesville to take over the NFL's Washington Redskins in 2002. \nFollowing two miserable seasons in Washington and a year away from coaching, Spurrier returned to the college game at South Carolina in 2005. He has an overall record of 228-89-2 in 26 seasons as a college head coach, is a seven-time SEC Coach of the Year and was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame as a player in 1986. \nThe Spurrier news was the latest in what turned out to be a newsworthy Monday around college football . \n(Creg Stephenson contributed to this report.)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T18:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T18:49:51.816+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
