First and foremost, here's the big one we're thinking about: which of EMC's several business units is Dell most interested in? \nThe reason Dell would go for a big deal like this is obvious, even if it seems like a big leap for a company still saddled with debt: EMC ( $EMC ) is one of the biggest and most established players in the enterprise IT market, and buying it would up Dell's enterprise game like never before. \nWe still don't know if Dell plans to buy all or some of EMC, and the reason that's a question in the first place is because of the data storage giant's unique corporate structure. \nThe federation structure, as it's called, splits EMC into three businesses: EMC Information Infrastructure, Pivotal and VMware (EMC's information storage, enterprise content and information security segments fall under the first one). Basically, this type of corporate structure lets each business operate on their own while still being strategically aligned. \nSince we don't know how this will end up, we decided to break EMC down by segment and show what Dell can expect to get if it decides to buy all of EMC's segments or just a few. The interactive graphic above shows each unit sized by revenue. Here's a little more context on each: Information Storage \nEMC's original bread and butter, this segment brought in the highest gross profit in 2014, but it actually had the second-to-lowest gross profit percentage (55 percent) out of the company's five segments. That's because competition has been heating up on this area. But as company CEO of Information Infrastructure David Goulden noted in EMC's second quarter earnings report this year, its Emerging Storage business — which includes XtremIO, its all flash storage solution — had reached a $3 billion revenue run-rate and was expected to grow more than 30 percent this year. Enterprise Content Division \nPreviously known as its Information Intelligence Group, this segment works on products and services that let businesses manage, distribute and collaborate on information on a secure platform across multiple device types. One of its top products is Documentum, which is used by companies in healthcare, life sciences, financial services and other sectors. The size of its 2014 gross profit is considerably lower than most of its segment counterparts, but on the flip side, it had one of the highest gross profit percentages (65.2 percent) that year, putting it behind RSA and VMware. RSA Information Security \nAcquired by EMC in 2006, the Bedford, Mass-based computer security company represents EMC's information security segment, and, as previously mentioned, pulled in the second-highest gross profit percentage (67.4 percent) in 2014. RSA's security products include Via, a secure delivery platform; Web Threat Detection, which fights against cybercrime with web-session intelligence and real-time behavioral analysis; and SecurID, an authentication platform. Pivotal \nThe Palo Alto-based provider of agile software development services and tools is a joint venture that was started between EMC and VMware in 2013 after EMC acquired Pivotal Labs the year before. This segment uses the cloud to helps companies develop custom applications for data and analytics purposes. It had the lowest gross profit percentage (46.5 percent) in 2014, and it makes up the smallest piece of EMC's revenue pie by segment. However, EMC said in its second quarter report that revenue was up 18 percent from 2014 about 60 percent from the previous quarter. VMware \nVMware, also based in Palo Alto, was acquired in 2004 by EMC, which then sold 15 percent of the cloud and virtualization software and services provider in an IPO. It is, by far, EMC's biggest cash cow, bringing in the most money out of all of EMC's segments and with the highest gross profit percentage in 2014. But it's also the segment activist investor Elliott Management Corp. has been pushing EMC to spin off, at least until now (a truce between Elliott and EMC ended last month, but Elliott hasn't said a word ever since). The segment only saw small minor growth in EMC's second quarter this year: a meager 4 percent increase from 2014. \nInfographic by Brian Warmoth.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T01:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T11:31:00.290+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
