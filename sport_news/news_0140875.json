EAST RUTHERFORD – Dwayne Harris had returned 84 previous kickoffs in his NFL career and he stepped into the end zone to receive each one with the same mind-set.\n“I’m always thinking about scoring,” Harris said. “Every time I get the ball in my hands, I’m thinking, ‘Score.’ I’m always thinking touchdown.”\nAnd for the first time as a professional, Harris finally got one.\nThe Giants’ $17 million free-agent acquisition went 100 yards in 13 seconds, from one end of MetLife Stadium to the other, turning dejection and concern into elation and euphoria with precision and speed that stunned his former team Sunday night before a crowd of 80,319.\nHarris delivered the knockout punch in the Giants’ 27-20 victory over the Cowboys, finally making good on a promise he made to himself on every kickoff since the last one he took to the house … as a college junior at East Carolina University in November 2009.\n“We just hadn’t broken that one big one yet,” Harris added with a smile after the game. “It’s always one block away, and tonight, we got that one block.”\nWhen Orleans Darkwa provided the crease by stopping the Cowboys’ Kyle Wilber cold, Harris raced off the right hip of Jonathan Casillas and, in his words, “into daylight.”\nJust like that, the Giants were back in front, putting the frustration of the game-tying Matt Cassel-to-Devin Street touchdown pass in Harris’ proverbial rearview mirror.\nThe former Cowboy finally helped the Giants get over the hump against their NFC East rivals, snapping a five-game losing streak in the rivalry. This was Big Blue’s first home triumph over Dallas since their NFC East-clinching triumph in Week 17 of the 2011 season, the game that sparked the franchise’s run to Super Bowl XLVI.\nThe performance was far from perfect for the Giants, but the finish far outweighed the flaws, considering the circumstances and the stakes. They had Dallas beat in Week 1, only to suffer one of the most embarrassing losses in franchise history when the Cowboys overcame a fourth-quarter, double-digit deficit with a touchdown with seven seconds left.\nThe Giants again took it on the chin in prime-time last week when the Eagles pulled even atop the divisional standings, sending the former reeling a bit with a 27-7 setback.\nThis was the Giants’ chance at redemption, not to mention some payback against the Cowboys, who have now lost four consecutive games after losing quarterback Tony Romo and wide receiver Dez Bryant to injury.\nIt just so happened that the Giants, who have been dealt many a blow on special teams since their last Vince Lombardi Trophy coronation, finally flipped the tables.\nDominique Rodgers-Cromartie had not recorded two interceptions in a game since 2012.\nThe Giants had not returned a kickoff for a touchdown since then.\nAnd the Giants had not beaten the Cowboys since that season, either.\nSomething finally gave on all three, and Harris tied a franchise record in the process.\n“Getting 17 [Harris] in the end zone against his old team, man, there’s really nothing better than that,” Casillas said. “He’s a great player. He’s very patient, very persistent in what he’s doing, and I think he ran a little faster today against his old team.”\nTom Coughlin was 5 years old the last time the Giants scored on both an interception return and a kickoff return (Nov. 4, 1951). In that game, two Hall of Famers teamed up to do it, as Tom Landry brought an interception back 55 yards for a touchdown and Emlen Tunnell went 100 yards for another score in a 37-31 victory over the New York Yankees.\nEli Manning presented Coughlin with a game ball in the middle of the Giants’ celebration in their locker room, a nice gesture after a much-needed triumph.\nBut this latest victory was not theirs because Manning and Odell Beckham Jr. took starring roles; rather, because Harris found a way to live up to expectations and bury the team that let him walk, the Giants find themselves in first place heading into back-to-back road games with New Orleans and Tampa Bay.\n“Not again,” Darkwa said. “That’s all we kept saying: ‘Not again, not against this team again.’Ÿ”\nThe Giants made upgrading their special teams a priority this March.\nThe Giants brought back Mark Herzlich and signed free agents Casillas and J.T. Thomas, both of whom were lauded for their prowess in coverage and blocking.\nThey also brought in Harris with a lucrative five-year contract, criticized by some because of how much guaranteed money was included ($17 million) for a player whose primary role had been as a returner and a gunner on special teams and not at wide receiver.\n“The Giants told me they’d give me a chance to play receiver and they kept their word,” Harris said. “That was the main reason I came here. Cowboys didn’t really want me to be nothing but a blocking receiver, so I came here.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T01:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T05:48:26.786+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
