Auclair Â© Provided by PGA\nWe've seen our share of golf trick-shot attempts where we think, \"that's probably not a great idea.\"\nAdChoices This one, however, tops them all -- literally and figuratively.\nCheck out Sigurdur Hauksson (an Icelander living in Norway, as he describes himself in his Instagram profile, @officialg0lfer) . Hauksson is performing his trick shot from 3,245 feet above the ocean on Kjeragbolten boulder -- a glacial deposit wedged in a crevasse at Kjerag mountain in Rogaland, Norway, and a popular spot for BASE jumping:\n#Tb to the 19th hole! Made my heart go a little bit wild, only 989 m above the ocean (3,245ft) @kjeragbolten #kjeragbolten #golfing #golfgods #golfcourse #oldcourse #par #birdie #adreninline #golf #golfer #golflife #golfclub #golfers #golfballs #19thhole\nA photo posted by Sigurdur Hauksson (@officialg0lfer) on Oct 4, 2015 at 9:48am PDT\nMost impressive trick-shot ever?

It had to take incredible composure to concentrate on anything other than balance from up that high.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["https://instagram.com/officialg0lfer/", "https://instagram.com/p/8bEZgyTN9I/", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-10-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-07T19:44:16.916+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
