That followed a 2.2 percent drop in July.\nOrders from other countries in the euro area were up 2.5 percent, following a smaller gain in July. However, demand from inside Germany was off 2.6 percent and orders from outside the eurozone dropped 3.7 percent. The Economy Ministry noted that demand from countries beyond the euro area appears to be \"less reliable at present.\"\nGermany has Europe's biggest economy and is one of the world's biggest exporters.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
