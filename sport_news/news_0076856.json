A surge in no-cause evictions. Persistent homelessness. A shortage of affordable homes for low-income families and individuals.\nIn the midst of this crisis, many potential solutions are off the table. Require developers to set aside a few affordable units in each new building? Nope — the Legislature has preempted cities like Portland from even discussing inclusionary zoning. Place limits on the rents landlords can charge? Nope, also preempted. Look to Washington, D.C., for help? Don't count on it. In fact, Republicans have targeted key federal housing programs for big cuts.\nSo what can we do locally? And what responsibility do developers have to help solve the problem? These are important questions raised by reporter Jeff Manning in his recent story on OregonLive, \"City affordable housing program does zero deals in 2015 amid the boom.\" Unfortunately, he lets private developers off the hook.\nEveryone agrees we need to increase the supply of affordable homes. For families of four making about $22,000 a year, Portland is currently short at least 20,000 apartments – and that number is growing. Because the market isn't addressing this shortage, government has a major role to play in filling the gap. One tool is to offer subsidies to private and nonprofit real estate developers who agree to build and preserve affordable homes. Direct subsidies include state and federal funds, local urban renewal dollars and the city's general fund — collectively, by far, the biggest tool in our kit. Indirect subsidies, also called incentives, include tax breaks to developers and are an important, albeit small, tool in the kit.\nHere is how tax breaks work: When a developer agrees to charge an affordable rent, the city and county forgive the building's property taxes for a period of time. Private developers are eligible for a 10-year tax break if they agree to make 20 percent of the units affordable. Nonprofits are eligible for a tax break for the life of the project. For example, as Manning noted, Guardian Real Estate Services recently agreed to make 57 of the 284 apartments in their new development on Burnside affordable, in exchange for $8 million in tax breaks over 10 years. That's a pretty sweet deal, with significant foregone tax revenue that would otherwise go to basic services.\nIn 2011, during the recession, tax breaks for private developers came under fire as \"giveaways\" that local governments could no longer afford. To address these concerns, the city and county worked with developers, homebuilders and housing activists to reform the programs, building in more accountability and capping the foregone revenue at $1 million each year.\nSo, how are tax breaks working? Of the more than 11,000 new apartments built in Portland since 2012, private developers used the program to make just 188 homes affordable. That's less than 2 percent. Some developers blame the city, claiming the reforms made the program too \"clunky.\" This, of course, ignores the program cap.\nBut I suspect there is a bigger problem: greed and the market. Tax breaks are an imperfect tool — they didn't work very well during the Great Recession when there was little new construction, and they aren't working very well during the Great Recovery, when out-of-state developers are making huge profits on high-end apartments.\nThis year, responding to industry feedback, the City Council adopted changes to make the tax breaks more flexible and developer-friendly. Time will tell whether developers step up to the plate and start building more affordable homes.\nMoving forward, if we want Portland to be a place where everybody is welcome, we should be guided by a number of common sense principles. First, significantly increase the supply of affordable homes. This will require new public resources, new tools like inclusionary zoning, and political will. Second, target public resources where the greatest need is: the most vulnerable families and individuals in our community. Third, be honest about the challenges we face. The city has a limited toolkit to address powerful market forces; we need to be strategic and focused. And finally, challenge private developers to be part of the solution.\nNo one should get a pass during this housing crisis.\n•\nNick Fish is a Portland city commissioner.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T20:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T02:08:27.370+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
