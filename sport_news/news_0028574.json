The Anaheim Ducks are still looking for a way to get their offense going. \nRadim Vrbata and Alex Burrows scored in the shootout, and the Canucks spoiled Anaheim's home opener with a 2-1 victory Monday night. \nMiller made 28 saves and Adam Cracknell scored in regulation for Vancouver, which beat the Ducks for just the third time in their last 12 meetings. \nVancouver improved to 2-0 on the road in the young season, with Miller yielding just one goal in each game. That's encouraging to the veteran, who played in only four games after Feb. 22 last season while dealing with a knee injury. \n\"I'm just trying to go out there and battle and compete,\" said Miller, who stopped a third-period redirection by Carl Hagelin with his mask. \"That was my mindset coming off an injury. That's what it really comes down to, getting back the focus early on. I didn't play hockey for a while. The technical stuff I worked on this summer and I pay attention to in practice.\" \nEven with twins Daniel and Henrik Sedin combining for just one shot, the Canucks won the new season's first meeting between the Pacific Division's top two teams last year. Anaheim won its third straight division title, while Vancouver finished a surprising second before losing in the opening round of the playoffs. \nSami Vatanen scored and Frederik Andersen stopped 24 shots for the Ducks, who have scored just one goal while going winless in the first two games of a season that begins with Stanley Cup aspirations. \nAnaheim was shut out in San Jose on Saturday in its opener before returning to Honda Center for its first real game on home ice since Game 7 of the Western Conference finals, when Chicago advanced to win the Stanley Cup. \nKevin Bieksa played nearly 24 1/2 minutes in his second game with the Ducks. Anaheim acquired the veteran defenseman from Vancouver last summer after he played 10 years with the Canucks, who drafted him in 2001. Bieksa was reunited with Ryan Kesler, the longtime Vancouver forward who moved to Anaheim before last season. \n\"We fought back a lot better than we did in San Jose,\" Bieksa said. \"So we need to keep building on this in the rest of this homestand here. If we do that, we're going to be all right.\" \nAfter the Ducks failed to score on a power play during their first official taste of 3-on-3 overtime hockey, Vrbata and Burrows got stuttering, halting shots past Andersen, who stopped Burrows' shot before watching it trickle under him. \n\"I've done that move a few times against a few goalies, but I don't think I've ever done it against Freddie,\" Burrows said. \"So I tried it, and I'm lucky it went in tonight. It hit his stick and trickled in.\" \nJakob Silfverberg scored in the shootout for the Ducks, who lost their home opener for just the second time in six seasons. Anaheim's talented offensive players aren't clicking so far, but nobody is panicking yet. \n\"I think we're doing things the right way now,\" Vatanen said. \"We battled hard. We got some good chances. The season is long, so we're going the right way.\" \nBoth teams opened at a furious pace, with end-to-end chances throughout. After a scoreless first period, Vatanen got the Ducks' first goal of the season when his long, low shot went through Mike Santorelli's screen. \nCracknell evened it later in the period with a sharp-angled shot that somehow deflected off Andersen's shoulder or stick and landed behind the goalie. The journeyman got his first regular-season NHL goal since April 4, 2013, and just the seventh of his 85-game NHL career. \n\"Pretty fortunate goal on their part,\" Anaheim coach Bruce Boudreau said. \nNOTES: A small group of vocal protesters gathered outside Honda Center to call for the suspension of Ducks D Clayton Stoner, who faces charges in Canada related to a 2013 grizzly bear hunt. ... Cracknell hadn't scored a goal in his last 49 regular-season games, although he got a postseason goal in 2014 for St. Louis. \nAll content copyright ©2015 The Tribune, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T08:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T10:40:44.553+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
