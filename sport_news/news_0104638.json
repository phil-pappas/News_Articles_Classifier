''When we play together and we move the ball and play really good defense, there are very few teams that are going to be able to deal with that for 40 minutes. It's just about persistence.'' \nAtlanta's Angel McCoughtry added 15 points, and Chicago's Elena Delle Donne, Phoenix's Brittney Griner and the University of Connecticut's Breanna Stewart each had 10. \n''I thought the first 15 minutes that we played in the first half was our best 15 minutes of basketball of the whole trip, against the best team that we played the whole trip,'' said coach Geno Auriemma of Connecticut. ''After all the travel and after all the time in hotels and buses and planes, and only three practices and three shootarounds, for our team to come out and play the way we did against a very good team, I think that says a lot about the group that we have. It couldn't have ended on a higher note.'' \nKia Vaughn led Prague with 13 points. She also plays for Washington in the WNBA. \nThe Americans opened Sunday night in Spain with a 94-52 victory over Spanish League champion Uni Girona, beat the Italian national team 79-66 on Wednesday night in Rome, and topped Dike Naples 86-50 on Thursday night in Naples.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T00:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T02:53:26.999+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
