If not for a sloppy, penalty-filled loss at Ohio in Week 2, the Thundering Herd would be entertaining thoughts of a perfect season again. \nDoc Holliday, now in his sixth season as Marshall’s head coach, doesn’t buy into so-called good losses, but that game shaped the next several weeks. \n“I like where we are because I think we’ve gotten better every week,” Holliday said Tuesday in his weekly press conference. “That’s what good teams do and every year is a new year. You get to a point about this time in the season where teams start to go in different ways and different directions. \n“One thing I like about our team that I think from the first game to the second game, where we took a step back a little bit, in the next three games I saw improvement every week from those guys.” \nThe loss at Ohio was followed by a win over FCS team Norfolk State, in which true freshman quarterback Chase Litton made a successful debut. \nThe following week saw the Herd survive Kent State, winning 36-29 in overtime, before back-to-back home wins over Old Dominion (27-7) and Southern Miss (31-10). \nThe Herd, which visits Florida Atlantic at noon Saturday (Fox College Sports), was dominant on defense against Southern Miss. They had four quarterback sacks and 17 hurries, as well as 15 passes defended. \n“Ultimately, last week was the best game we’ve played to date and we have to continue,” Holliday said. “I don’t think there’s any question that these guys are playing with a lot of confidence right now, which is huge. They feel good about themselves and I think we’re getting better as a team.” \nWhile Marshall has the top ranked defense in Conference USA, the offense hasn’t been as explosive as in the past. But that’s what happens when you’re breaking in a true freshman quarterback and your top two running backs are hurt. \nDevon Johnson and Remi Watson returned against Southern Miss, which Holliday says is big in Litton’s progression. \n“(Litton and junior Michael Birdsong) are a lot more comfortable with Remi and Devon in there picking up blitzes for four years,” Holliday said. “They give a lot more confidence, I’m sure, to Chase.” \n“Ultimately, whenever you go out there and step on that field on Saturday, you have to be the best team on that field,” he added. “You may not be the best offense and you may not be the best defense, but you have to be the best team in all three phases (combined) and we’ve done that for the last couple weeks. It’s critical that it happens again Saturday.” Sign Up / Sign In With your existing account from... {* loginWidget *}", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T17:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T18:05:02.026+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
