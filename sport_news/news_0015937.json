Just a great effort by this team. I couldn’t be prouder.” \nTulare Western (4-3, 2-0) is tied for first place in the EYL with crosstown rival Tulare Union (7-0, 2-0). The Mustangs take on three-time defending EYL champion Mission Oak (3-4, 1-1) next week at Bob Mathias Stadium. \n“We couldn’t wait until league started. It meant the start of a whole new season for us,” Rocha said. “This team is battle-tested. They’ve been through it all. They’ve had big leads that turned into losses. They’ve lost on the road. We had our struggles, but they’re coming together at the right time. We knew when we started league that we were 0-0, Union was 0-0 and Mission Oak was 0-0. We just have to take it one game at a time. And this was a big game to get.” \nJust about every vital detail from this game is worth its own story, so here’s a quick synopsis: \n• Six lead changes: The fifth lead change appeared to be the final one of the contest with Porterville’s Isaiah Jones scoring on a seven-yard run and punching in two-point conversion that gave the Panthers a 42-38 lead with 1:10 left in the fourth quarter. \nBut the Mustangs had a couple of tricks up their sleeve to pull the win away from the Panthers’ grasp. \nJosh Portillo returned the ensuing kickoff to the Panther 37-yard line. Three plays laters, Mustang junior quarter Andre Aguilar worked his way through a befuddled Panther defense for a 20-yard touchdown with 31 seconds on the clock for the game-winning score. \nIsaiah Jones Express runs wild, sometimes a little too wild: One week after rushing for 302 yards and six touchdowns in Porterville’s 61-35 win over Mission Oak, Jones topped the 400-yard mark with 426 yards and five touchdowns on 34 carries. The 426 yards rushing might be a Bob Mathias Stadium record. But Jones lost two fumbles, and the Mustangs cashed in both miscues with touchdowns. \nOn Jones’ first lost fumble near the midway point of the third quarter, Aguilar threw a 51-yard scoring strike to Jesse Macias that turned a 28-24 Panther lead into a 31-28 Mustang lead. \nJones coughed up the ball again later in the third quarter, and the Mustangs’ Elijah Alonzo recovered at the Panther six. After a five-yard penalty, David Alcantar darted over the left side — with the aid of a splendid spin move — for an 11-yard Tulare Western touchdown that extended the Mustangs’ lead to 38-28. \nJones would have a starring role in the Panthers’ comeback efforts, as Porterville scored two touchdowns over a 68-second span that erased the Mustangs’ 10-point lead. \nPorterville quarterback Alfredo Verduzco scored with 2:18 remaining in regulation on a 1-yard run. The Panthers recovered the ensuing onside kick at their 49, and three plays later, Jones was in the end zone for his fifth score. \nBut when Aguilar danced through the Panther defense for the game-winning touchdown just a few seconds later, an exasperated Jones was storming down the Panther sideline in disbelief. \n“Stats are stats. We just came out with the ‘W.’ That’s the most important stat, getting that ‘W,’” Rocha said. “We just knew going into this game that Jones was going to get his yards. Jones is a helluva player. We just had to make the right plays at the right time.” \nSpecial Forces: What shouldn’t be overlooked is the impact of the Mustang specials team unit in Friday’s game. Senior placekicker Cameron Horsting connected on all six of his extra-point attempts, and nailed a 34-yard field goal in the second quarter that proved to be the difference of the game. \nHorsting recorded six touch backs on kickoffs, and the Panthers didn’t pick up a first down in four of those possessions — two ended in turnovers (an interception and a lost fumble). Horsting executed a perfect coffin-corner punt late in third quarter that pinned Porterville at its 1-yard line. On the Panthers’ first play from scrimmage following that punt, Jones fumbled for the second time, which was recovered by Alonzo, setting up Alcantar’s touchdown. \nAlonzo, who has become a major X-factor for the Mustang defense over the last two weeks (he returned an interception and a touchdown in last week’s win over Delano), commenced the game’s scoring by returning a short punt 15 yards for a touchdown. \n“We knew going into this season that our special teams was going to a major strength for us, and it has been exactly that. Cameron made some big kicks throughout the game. He really helps our defense with his kicking and punting. He does a phenomenal job. He had a major part in this win,” Rocha said. \nThe Rise of Aguilar: In his second career varsity stat, Aguilar played with the poise and play-making ability of a three-year veteran. After throwing a couple of first-half interceptions, Aguilar settled down in the second half, and the Mustang aerial attack proved to a valuable weapon. Aguilar finished 18-of-29 passing for 199 yards and two touchdowns. Five Mustang receivers had at least two catches, topped by Macias with five receptions for 83 yards. \nPorterville", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T10:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T18:51:45.696+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
