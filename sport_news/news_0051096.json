His role was much more important against the Vikings, as the Chiefs were without start running back Jamaal Charles due to a torn ACL against Chicago.\nRather than try to replicate Charles’ production on the ground, Andy Reid elected to give Smith more opportunities to produce. He completed 22 of 37, one of which for a touchdown. The backfield duo of Knile Davis and Charcandrick West, totaled only 14 carries for 46 yards on the day.\nIt really was a tale of two halves for the offense, as most of their big plays came after the break. Kansas City went into the half with just 51 first-half yards and only six rushes from their running backs.\nThe adjustments made opened things up for Travis Kelce, as four of his five catches came in the second half totaling 88 yards. Albert Wilson also saw more targets, including a designed screen on third down that he took 42-yards to the end zone for his first career touchdown.\nThe disappointing weapon was Chris Conley, who made the start in place of Wilson. Conley had multiple third down drops that would have converted first downs, one of which would have put Kansas City in field goal range. He did flash a fingertip grab late in the game, but the drops simply can’t happen at this level especially on third down.\nThe play calling started off more of the same for the Chiefs, as the first half was filled with draws and screens behind the line that ultimately proved futile. In the second half the offense opened up with Smith utilizing his weapons more down the field, and the results improved.\nJeremy Maclin continued to be a strong off-season signing, as the former Eagle hauled in a big 39-yard catch, part of 48 yards on the day. He might have ended with even more, but had to exit in the 4th quarter with a concussion and would not return.\nWhile Maclin and Kelce continue to produce, the offensive line seems to regress each week. Grubbs is no where near the veteran he was expected to be, Stephenson was blown up on a crucial fourth and one play, and Morse, Fulton, and Fisher have generated little no push in the run game.\nThis led to almost a non-existent run game, as Davis only went for 13 yards and West 33 yards. West was the man called upon for fourth and one in the goal line, and was stopped behind the line with almost no opportunity. He then had the ultimate dagger with just minutes remaining and the Chiefs driving, when he fumbled the ball entering Minnesota territory.\nThe big moments that won’t show up in the stat sheet came from the tight end Kelce. A very passionate player, he was the one firing up the team on 4th down in the huddle, and he was the one who slammed his helmet on the field following West’s fumble.\nThe final play resulted in a penalty for Kelce, but seeing that the team still cares and fights is a good sign going forward especially if the struggles continue. Every team needs a leader and the quarterback usually is, but Kelce’s actions can really set the tone and send a message to the team.\nThe offense will hope to improve next week, as the Pittsburgh Steelers travel to Arrowhead Stadium with kickoff set for noon Sunday on KCTV5.\nCopyright 2015 KCTV (Meredith Corp.)
