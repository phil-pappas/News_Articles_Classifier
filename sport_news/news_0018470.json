According to the Ohio Department of Natural Resources, the day can be mild and pleasant, but water temperatures are falling due to cooler nights, and if an accident occurs and a craft capsizes, hypothermia could easily set it. More than one-third of Ohio’s boating-related fatalities from 2010-14 resulted from people falling overboard and boats capsizing or swamping. The easy solution is to dress for the water and not the air temperature, and always wear a life jacket. Information on boating safety and tips for avoiding hypothermia are available at watercraft.ohiodnr.gov/safetytips. \nThis winter could be tame \nLast winter was a bad one in Ohio with heavy snow and bitter temperatures that made life difficult for wildlife, hunters and ice fishermen alike. Will that happen again this year? Maybe not. According to the national weather folk, chances are good the winter will be average to above average and fairly dry with a 60 percent chance of not much snow. El Nino will cause some beneficial changes in Buckeye weather patterns, and the forecast is for a 180-degree turnaround from last year. We’ll have winter, of course, but it won’t be as cold, and while we could still get a major snow storm, the general prediction is for less over the winter. That’s good news for all, whether it be turkeys and cottontails or humans. \nLearn how to field dress a deer \nOutdoor enthusiasts interested in learning to field dress their own whitetails are encouraged to attend a free informational workshop provided by the Division of Wildlife on Nov. 18. Trained professionals will cover topics such as field dressing, skinning and butchering deer. The workshop will be held from 6 to 9 p.m. at the Wildlife District 1 office at 1500 Dublin Road, Columbus, 43215. Pre-registration is required as space is limited. Register by calling Karen Norris at 614-902-4197. Please dress appropriately for the workshop and the weather. \nODNR giving grants to schools \nOhio teachers who have successfully used Project WILD in their classrooms can now provide students with additional hands-on learning about wildlife and habitat through grants from the ODNR. The grants, totaling $500 each, will be awarded on a competitive basis to 40 schools currently participating in Project WILD, a supplemental environmental education curriculum for grades K-12. Interested educators should submit an application from now through May 31 to the Division of Wildlife, Outdoor Education Section, 2045 Morse Road, Bldg. G, Columbus, OH 43229. To learn more about Project WILD or find an area workshop, go to wildohio.gov or call 800-WILDLIFE. \nRegister for the Bassmaster Open Series \nSome of America’s best bass fishing waters will play host to competitors in the 2016 Bass Pro Shops Bassmaster Open Series. The series will span 10 months, visit seven states and offer nine invitations to the Super Bowl of Bass Fishing. Anglers will compete for a portion of more than $250,000 awarded at each open event, including a boat and motor package to the winners. Registration for B.A.S.S. Nation and Life members begins online Nov. 17. Other details and complete registration information will be posted on Bassmaster.com. \nWildlife officers on the lookout for drug use, litter \nApparently, a number of people have decided that Ohio’s often remote wildlife areas are good places to litter and abuse drugs. Not true. Throughout the summer, District 3 state wildlife officers worked several projects at the Beach City Wildlife Area to address the problem. During the course of the projects, numerous subjects were observed using the wildlife area. More than 50 individuals were contacted and 26 subjects were issued summonses for various offenses, including litter, possession of drugs, possession of drug paraphernalia and criminal damaging for painting graffiti. A hard lesson for all. \nDick Martin is a retired biology teacher who has been writing outdoor columns for 30 years.
