The right-hander lasted six innings before turning the game over to his bullpen, which scattered just three runners over the final three frames. \nTony Sipp, Will Harris and Oliver Perez got the game to Luke Gregerson, part of Oakland's wild-card collapse in Kansas City last year. He handled the ninth to earn the save. \nGeorge Springer and Colby Rasmus went deep for the homer-happy Astros, but they also scored via the same sort of small ball the Royals used in reaching the World Series last season. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T06:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T06:52:22.472+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
