Jim Dedmon / USA TODAY Sports FOX Sports   10:41p ET \nWith Missouri 's offense struggling, it needs to rely on Mr. Reliable this week at Georgia. \nSenior running back Russell Hansbrough has been battling a balky ankle for the duration of the season. As a result, it's undoubtedly had an adverse affect on Missouri's offensive output. Coach Pinkel said today on @InsideSTL that Russell Hansbrough should be 100% this week. \"He told me yesterday that he's ready to go.\" — Brandon Kiley (@BKSportsTalk) October 13, 2015 \nGary Pinkel's team ranks towards the bottom of the conference in most offensive categories. \nAgainst Georgia this weekend, Hansbrough's effectiveness (or lack thereof) will be a massive determiner as to how well the team will perform. \nIf he's running without any noticeable discomfort, it adds a completely different dimension to the offense. Freshman quarterback Drew Lock wouldn't feel pressured to win the game with his arm. Hansbrough's potentially brilliance running the ball would also help things in the passing game from a play-action standpoint. Russell Hansbrough becomes the 6th Tiger under Gary Pinkel to rush for 2,000 yards in his career! #MIZ pic.twitter.com/YRCkWXyfXs — Mizzou Football (@MizzouFootball) October 3, 2015 \nHis play in recent weeks is an encouraging sign. Hansbrough rushed for 43 yards on 11 carries versus South Carolina, and scampered for 74 yards on only nine carries last week in the loss to Florida. \nHis battle against Georgia running back Sony Michel will also be fun to watch. Should Hansbrough out-gain Michel, Missouri has a great shot at pulling the upset. MORE NEWS: Want stories delivered to you?
