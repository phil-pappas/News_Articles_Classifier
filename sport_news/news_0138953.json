A meeting to chalk out the preparatory schedule for Sarbat Khalsa will be organised at Gurdwara Singh Shaheedan, Model Town, on October 12. The Sikh faction headed by SAD (Amritsar) head Simranjit Singh Mann, Mohkam Singh, SAD (Panch Pardhani), Dal Khalsa, Damdami Taksal (Ajnala group), SAD (Delhi), Akhand Kirtani Jatha, Sant Samaj, Haryana Sikh Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee and All India Sikh Students Federation have come on a single platform against pardoning the dera chief. Sources said a majority of these factions want Sarbat Khalsa to be called up tentatively at Amritsar, but not at Sri Akal Takht Sahib, a day prior to Diwali. The agenda of the Sarbat Khalsa would be rejecting the Sikh clergy’s decision to exonerate the dera chief and remove the jathedars who took this unpardonable politically motivated decision. Akali Dal (United) chief Bhai Mohkam Singh said this move would not be “politically motivated”, but for saving the dignity of religion and the Sri Akal Takht. “The final date and venue of holding the Sarbat Khalsa would be taken in the October 12 meeting at Ludhiana and the Sikh community residing across the globe would be taken into confidence before taking any decision. A committee is being constituted for the preparations. A website will be soon launched through which suggestions from the entire Sikh community will be invited over the issue,” he said. Former Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee (DSGMC) chief Paramjit Singh Sarna opined that the Sarbat Khalsa’s schedule would be finalised only after receiving feedback from Sikhs residing all over. “In my opinion, the Sarbat Khalsa should be called up at a place where the SAD (Badal) has no reach. It could be held overseas too. Yet, the final date would be decided at the meeting which will be attended by various Sikh factions at Ludhiana,” he added.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T12:32:32.269+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
