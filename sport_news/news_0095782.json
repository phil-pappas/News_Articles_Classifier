The Cardinals are out to tackle the Bondurant-Farrar BlueJays on Friday in Class 3A District 6 play at Bondurant. By Jocelyn Sheets Newton Daily News \nThere’s no secret to winning football games. Newton High’s Cardinals know that fact. Another fact is to win, a team needs to play a complete, consistent game against opponents. The Cardinals recognize that also. \n“We need to play a complete game. We haven’t been consistent. We’ve seen it at times — a good drive on offense or a big stop on defense, but we haven’t put it together for four quarters,” Newton head coach Ed Ergenbright said. \n“As coaches, we’ve been striving for our guys to put together a solid defensive effort and match that with putting up some points and get over the hump.” \nNewton (0-7) steps back into Class 3A District 6 play for its final two games of the season. The Cardinals go into Friday’s at Bondurant-Farrar at 0-4 in district action. It is a 7:30 p.m. kickoff at the BlueJays’ stadium in Bondurant. \nThe BlueJays are in the middle of a playoff spot run in the district. Gilbert sits atop District 6 at 4-0 followed by Ballard at 3-1. Bondurant-Farrar and Benton are both 3-2, but Benton is in non-district action this week. \nNewton faces the top passing offense of the district led by senior quarterback Dylon Story and senior receiver Payton Duit. The Jays’ top rusher is senior Jarrid Clark, who is the team’s No. 2 receiver and leading scorer. \nStory is the No. 1 quarterback in District 6, completing 79-of-125 passes for 1,295 yards. He has 11 touchdown passes and two interceptions. Duit ranks No. 1 on the district receiving list, making 46 catches for 683 yards, averaging almost 15 yards a catch. He has five touchdown catches. \nFriday’s game will feature the No. 4 and No. 5 rushers in the district in Newton senior Joseph Banfield and B-F’s Clark, respectively. Banfield has gained 773 yards on 152 carries while Clark has 690 yards on 108 carries. Clark has made 18 receptions for 436 yards. \nBanfield has scored nine touchdowns for the Cardinals. He has a kickoff return for a touchdown and a two-point conversion, putting him fifth in the district in scoring with 62 points. \nClark had seven rushing touchdowns and five receiving touchdowns as he sits No. 2 in scoring in District 6 with 72 points. \n“Bondurant-Farrar has a good quarterback, and they like to get Duit in one-on-one situation as their top receiver. He is athletic and can make plays in the passing game,” Ergenbright said. “Their top running back is good as well.” \nStopping the run has been problematic for the Cardinals this season. Ergenbright said his team is building on its solid performance in curtailing top-ranked Pella’s run game last week in a non-district loss. \n“We’ve had trouble stopping the run, but we got a few guys back in the defensive lineup last week — Alex Miller and Ryan Constant were back and it made a difference. We grew up a little bit as a team against Pella, both defensively and offensively,” Ergenbright said. \nNewton has senior running back Dalton Nevels, who has 418 yards on 64 carries, to share in the rushing attack with Banfield. Sophomore quarterback Garrett Sturtz is 31-of 54 passing for 247 yards with two touchdown passes and six interceptions. \nBanfield has caught 10 passes for 59 yards and senior tight end Bryce Tish has nine receptions for 93 yards. \nTwo seniors will see action in the defensive backfield again. Cole Peters, who was injured in the opener, and Jwan Roush, who has been out since the second game, are coming off the injured list to play Friday. Newton will be closer than it has been all season to playing at full force on both sides of the football. \n“For us to be successful Friday, we need to run the ball, protect Garrett (Sturtz) long enough to get our passing game going. We need to control the ball and score,” Ergenbright said. “I like the scheme we have in place for this week.” \nContact Jocelyn Sheets at 641-792-3121 ext. 6535 or jsheets@newtondailynews.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T19:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T08:14:09.311+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
