Instead of buying private insurance, Coloradans would pay another 10 percent in premium taxes to cover their medical care.\n\"The Affordable Care Act has made insurance available to more people, but we haven't made a dent in the under-insured people who struggle to afford the deductibles and other out-of-pocket expenses,\" said Sen. Irene Aguilar, a Denver Democrat who is a medical doctor who tried and failed to set up a single-payer referendum during the 2013 legislative session.\nSupporters of the single-payer plan have until Oct. 23 to collect the signatures of 98,492 registered voters to get Initiative 20 on the ballot.\nCritics say the proposed $25 billion a year in premium taxes — roughly the size of the entire state budget — is an expensive gamble on something no other state has tried successfully.\n\"A lot of sweat and tears has been invested the last three years getting what we have, and we're in support of that,\" said Tammy Niederman, a Highlands Ranch insurance agency owner who serves as legislative chair for the Colorado State Association of Health Underwriters, referring to Connect for Health.\nAdvertisement \"I can't imagine scrapping that and starting all over again with something that's going to be this unknown ... that's a massive tax increase.\"\nPrivate insurers doubt the 10 percent premium tax is a reliable figure to cover the costs and that it could force locally elected ColoradoCare boards to raise premiums, she said, adding it would be costly and difficult to switch back to the old system if ColoradoCare failed.\n\"It completely dismantles the private health care marketplace we have now,\" she said.\nHow it would work\nPeople would still be able to choose their medical provider, but the bills would be paid for by ColoradoCare, the same way bills are paid by private insurance companies or government programs such as Medicare and Medicaid.\nSavings and extra benefits would be paid for by cutting down administrative costs, according to ColoradoCare supporters. They point to a 2012 Institute of Medicine report that indicated 27 percent of the $2.8 trillion spent annually on health care in the U.S. pays for unnecessary administration, duplication and other waste.\nTo pay for ColoradoCare, employers would put in 6.67 percent in payroll \"premium\" taxes and the employee would pay 3.33 percent to replace current insurance.\nOn the median $50,000 income for Coloradans, that would work out to $278 a month from the employer and $139 a month from the employee, according to ColoradoCare.\nWith Connect for Health, an individual policy for a nonsmoking 40-year-old earning $50,000 would cost $167.41 a month to $226.02 with a $6,250 deductible.\nColoradoCare would have no deductibles or co-pays on primary and preventive care, though co-pays would remain on other services and prescriptions. One plan at 10 percent of each adult's pay would cover an entire family.\nBesides primary and specialty care, hospitalization, prescription, emergency room and preventive care costs that current plans cover, ColoradoCare would cover mental health, substance abuse, limited long-term care, vision, hearing and dental benefits.\nSelf-employed people would pay 10 percent of their net income, and unemployed or disabled people would be covered by grants and existing government programs, such as Medicaid.\nAlimony, unemployment insurance and the first $33,000 of Social Security or pension income for an individual would be exempt from the assessment.\nNothing would change for those whose health care is covered by Medicare, Medicaid or the Veterans Administration.\nOpponents wary of promises\nIf ColoradoCare passes, the state would qualify for a waiver from the Affordable Care Act, which proponents offer as a selling point to conservative voters.\nSome conservative critics monitoring the proposal however, aren't swayed, even if replacing Obamacare is appealing.\n\"You're trading the antichrist for the Devil himself,\" quipped Jonathan Lockwood, a Republican communications, strategy and social media consultant in Denver.\nKelly Sloan, a Grand Junction-based political consultant and a policy fellow at the conservative Centennial Institute in Lakewood, has been looking for organizations to mount an opposition campaign.\n\"Initiative 20 will exacerbate the problem that is driving up health care costs, which is the increase in demand caused by a disconnect between what health care costs and what most people actually pay, either because government (through Medicaid, etc.) or insurance pays most of the costs. A single-payer system only makes that situation worse,\" he said.\nNiederman, the insurance agency owner, said none of the information she's seen posted online by ColoradoCare campaigns assures her that 10 percent is a reliable figure.\nIn January, Vermont's Democratic governor, Peter Shumlin, a supporter of universal care, killed a $4.3 billion single-payer proposal , saying it proved too expensive.\nIvan J. Miller, president of the Colorado Foundation for Universal Health Care Board, responded that Colorado is much different than Vermont, including lower health care costs, a stronger economy and a larger pool of enrollees — 5.3 million to Vermont's 626,000. Vermont's proposal was \"based on ideology and human rights and bragged that policy didn't matter,\" Miller said, referring to the way its finances were designed compared with those drafted for over six years by the Colorado Foundation for Universal Health Care . \"We say policy does matter, and we have spent six years developing a strong policy.\"\nAguilar, meanwhile, is driving across the state to sell the plan to community groups on the basis of fairness.\n\"Everybody pays something based on income — nobody gets a free ride,\" Aguilar said. \"But in exchange, we get a health care system that doesn't discriminate between those who can afford to pay the most for the best care and those who can't.\"\nJoey Bunch: 303-954-1174, jbunch@denverpost.com or @joeybunch", "external_links": ["https://prd.connectforhealthco.com/individual/prescreen/search/quotes?anonymousFlag=true&gId=mGroup2&isOEPFlow=true", "http://www.healthaffairs.org/healthpolicybriefs/brief.php?brief_id=82", "https://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2015/01/25/costs-derail-vermont-single-payer-health-plan/VTAEZFGpWvTen0QFahW0pO/story.html", "http://www.couniversalhealth.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/coloradocareeconomicanalysiswith2016and2019projections.pdf"], "published": "2015-10-12T20:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T16:20:13.669+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
