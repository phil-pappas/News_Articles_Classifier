The speedy ship is designed to fight in shallower waters with a smaller crew than older Navy ships. \n“On this class of ship, depending on the mission, we can bring on different modules that will totally change the missions we can do,” said Cmdr. Kenneth Lieberman, the executive officer – the second in command – for the crew currently serving on Milwaukee as it undergoes final work before delivery to the Navy. “As the world evolves, and the Navy evolves, this ship can evolve with it.” \nTwo designs of the ship — built at Fincantieri Marinette Marine in Marinette and at Austal USA in Alabama — are replacing older ships in the fleet. Crews are still refining operations and discovering new ways to use the ships as more enter service. \n“This is a very big change for surface warfare officers and the surface warfare community,” said Lieberman, who will likely move to commanding officer of the USS Sioux City as that ship nears completion. “Traditionally we are off the coast 17, 20, 25 miles, launching missiles and doing air strikes. This ship is designed to operate very close to shore.” \nThe future USS Milwaukee is expected to be commissioned Nov. 21 in Milwaukee. Seven of the ships are under construction in Marinette, including the USS Sioux City. Connecting the crew and ship with the community it is named after is part of a long-standing naval tradition, and the reason behind this week's ship tour and interviews with news crews from Sioux City. \nCrew size \nThe LCS program also marks a shift in crew levels. The core compliment of sailors is about 50, a number that increases during deployments when aviation crews and mission specialists are added to the mix, but it’s significantly fewer than on older ships in the fleet. \n“Traditionally, you have 300 sailors who would have one or two responsibilities and one or two auxiliary jobs,” said Lieberman, a 22-year veteran of the Navy from Philadelphia. “Here, each of our sailors… hold seven to nine jobs. They may go from driving the ship to refueling a helicopter, refueling the ship (while underway), to manning the guns. That’s within in a 24-hour period.” \nCrew size didn’t deter gas turbine systems mechanical technician Richard Holsapple from selecting the LCS program for duty. He chose the assignment to be part of the new program and what he sees as the future of the service. \n“It’s exciting being on the cutting edge of all this technology. It’s a smart ship,” the Ansonia, Ohio, native said. “We’re doing the job of 200 sailors with a quarter of the people… It’s high demand and fast paced, but it’s very rewarding. I’ve been to several schools and have done a lot of jobs I never thought I’d do in the Navy. \n“I’m an engineer, and if I get a gun, normally there’s a problem, but I’ve been trained in that in this program,” said Holsapple, who spent five years serving on a guided missile destroyer. \nHe said the core LCS crew is roughly the same size as his graduating high school class. \nOne of the staterooms for crew aboard the future USS Milwaukee, also known as LCS-5, a littoral combat ship undergoing testing at Fincantieri Marinette Marine in Marinette, Wis. on Monday, Oct. 12, 2015.

The Fort Worth is in the late stages of a 16-month assignment in that region and has operated in contested coastal waters near the Spratly Islands in the South China Sea. \nWhile the Milwaukee is preparing to sail away from Marinette, the future USS Sioux City has yet to hit the water. The ship is housed inside the massive Building 10 at the shipyard where workers build sections — some much larger than others — of several ships at once. \nIn the next two to three months, when construction is about 80 percent finished, Sioux City will move out of Building 10 for a sideways launch into the Menominee River, where workers will continue construction. \nAt full production, building a ship takes about three years from the time the contract is awarded to the time it is delivered to the Navy, according to Lockheed Martin, the prime contractor on the Littoral Combat Ships built in Marinette. \nFor members of LCS Crew 108, the wait for Sioux City to be completed is filled with training and certification. \n“It doesn’t feel like a wait,” said chief engineer Lt. Kevin Rhyne, an 18-year veteran of the Navy from McAdenville, North Carolina. “We’re busy, very busy. Every week there’s a different certification in a warfare area leading up to the crew’s full certification to take over the vessel.” \nJUNG YEON JE, AFP/Getty Images The USS Fort Worth is moored at a South Korean naval port March 14.
