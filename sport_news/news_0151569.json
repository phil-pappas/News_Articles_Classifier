(AP) - Atlanta Falcons receiver Roddy White is back with the team and says he is encouraged about his role following a meeting with coach Dan Quinn. \nWhite said Thursday he missed Wednesday’s practice to be with his mother, who had surgery. He said the surgery went well. \nWhite complained about his diminished role in Atlanta’s offense earlier in the week. On Thursday he said it’s “really not a controversy.” After meeting with Quinn before practice White said “we’ve gotten past that.” \nWhite says he’s taking a positive outlook into Sunday’s game against the Washington Redskins. \nWhite has six catches, including only two in the last three games. He says he expects more opportunities as defenses key on leading receiver Julio Jones. \n___ \nAP NFL website: www.pro32.ap.org and www.twitter.com/AP_NFL \nCopyright © 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T20:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T21:24:41.566+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
