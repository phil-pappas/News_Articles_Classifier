Since Chicago won their third title in six seasons, one player was charged with impaired driving, another was charged with possession of a controlled substance and another returned home to Russia in the wake of domestic violence charges.\nTwo days before the start of the season, the NHL acknowledged that more of its players are using cocaine than in previous years and the league might have to be more proactive in testing for it.\nBut for one night at least, all that seemed forgotten as fans packed arenas from Toronto to Los Angeles to kick off an 82-game regular season that will be followed by a grueling two-month postseason that will crown a winner in mid-June.\nOpening night also saw one of the NHL's new rules utilized as Toronto Maple Leafs coach Mike Babcock made the first coach's challenge in league history after his goalie was interfered with on a goal that would have put the Montreal Canadiens ahead 2-1.\nThe referee's original call was overturned but Montreal still went on to earn a 3-1 victory behind a 36-save performance from reigning NHL Most Valuable Player Carey Price.\nIn the two late games, San Jose were at Los Angeles while Calgary hosted Vancouver.\nThe anticipation for the first slate of games will most likely spill over into Thursday when 18-year-old Edmonton Oilers forward Connor McDavid, the league's most marketable prospect since Sidney Crosby, makes his NHL debut.\nMcDavid, a so-called 'can't-miss' prospect who has already been compared to some of the game's greatest players, will be the star attraction when Edmonton visit the St. Louis Blues.\n(Reporting by Frank Pingue in Toronto; Editing by Julian Linden )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T08:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T07:30:41.810+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
