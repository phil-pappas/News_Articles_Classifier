Jamar Simpkins made the recovery, and two plays later WMU quarterback Zach Terrell found receiver Daniel Braverman in the back of the endzone for a 6-yard touchdown pass. \n\"It kind of set the tone for the beginning of the game,\" Terrell said of the early turnover. \"It definitely puts them on their heels. Our defense came out strong and really put us in an elite position to score and we executed.\" \nMiami responded with a six-play, 82-yard drive capped off by a 8-yard touchdown run by backup quarterback Gus Ragland. \nThe RedHawks made it to the redzone on their next possession, but were held to a 31-yard field goal by Kaleb Patterson to give Miami an early 10-7 advantage. \nThe remainder of the game belonged to the Broncos. \nJust before a brief heavy downpour soaked Waldo Stadium early in the second quarter, WMU rattled off a 10-play, 74-yard drive that ended with Terrell finding Carrington Thompson for a 6-yard touchdown pass. The play helped the Broncos regain the lead at 14-10. \nWMU marched down the field on its next drive, and facing a fourth-and-inches on their own 17-yard line, running back Jamauri Bogan powered through the line of scrimmage and broke free for a touchdown to help give his team a 21-10 halftime lead. \nBraverman caught his second touchdown pass of the game on the Broncos' opening drive of the second half, ending a 12-play, 78-yard drive with a 5-yard strike from Terrell to make it 28-10. \nThe RedHawks' Patterson got three back when he booted a 38-yard field goal that bounced off the right upright and through to cut WMU's lead to 28-13. \nBogan capped off the scoring with his second touchdown run of the game, coming from 2-yards out with 2:11 left in regulation. \nTerrell finished 25-of-32 for 278 yards and three touchdowns. Bogan carried the ball 19 times for 84 yards and two scores; Braverman had 13 catches for 135 yards and two touchdowns; and Corey Davis had seven catches for 113 yards. \nDefensively, the Broncos limited Miami to just 59 rushing yards - with 38 coming on one play. Linebacker Robert Spillane had nine tackles, including 3 1/2 for loss and 1 1/2 sacks, while fellow linebacker Caleb Bailey had nine tackles, including three for loss. \n\"We did not play our very best football today,\" said WMU head coach P.J. Fleck. \"I thought it was kind of an up-and-down game. We'd execute and then we'd take a few steps backwards... Offensively we've got to play way better. We've got to run the ball harder and execute in the passing game better. \n\"The whole day, I think it was just OK. We know we can play better and I think if you felt that locker room after the game they know they can play better.\" \nWMU returns to action Thursday when it visits Eastern Michigan University for a 7:30 p.m. contest. \nNOTES : Before the game it was announced that senior guard Jimmy Kristof was lost for the season with an undisclosed lower-body injury. Kristof had missed the previous three games. \nNick Buckley can be reached at nbuckley@battlecreekenquirer.com or 269-966-0652.
