They held hands and prayed in remembrance of junior Cam'ron Matthews, who died after a game under the Friday night lights the day before, marking the sixth U.S. high school football player to die this season. Related Eugenie Bouchard sues over U.S. Open... \nIt was not clear from local media reports what exactly happened, but CNN affiliate KLTV in Tyler, about an hour's drive from Alto, reported that the 6-foot junior told his teammates during a huddle that he felt dizzy shortly before halftime. \nHe then collapsed, and a helicopter transported him to a Tyler hospital, the station reported. The game against Carlisle High School of Price, Texas, was postponed. \nMultiple media outlets, including CNN affiliate KETK, reported that Matthews suffered a seizure during the game and died Saturday. \nA GoFundMe page set up to gather donations for Matthews' parents and sister described the teen as \"a great kid, athlete, strong in his faith & a friend to many.\" \nAlto Independent School District Superintendent Kerry Birdwell grew teary as he described the youngster, who played wide receiver, quarterback and safety. He told CNN affiliate KTRE that the school would have counselors on hand Monday for any students who need them. \n\"When you have your own children and you want them to emulate someone and to follow in their footsteps, Cam'ron was a perfect example of that,\" Birdwell told the station. \"He was a great kid in the classroom, unbelievable athlete, but more importantly just a great, great kid.\" \nNeither the Cherokee County Sheriff's Office nor the nearest coroner, in Dallas County, had Matthews' cause of death Sunday. The Dallas County coroner said it would forward its autopsy results to Cherokee County, where Alto is located. \n11 deaths in 2014 \nIn 2014, five of the country's 1.1 million high school football players died of causes directly related to the sport, such as head and spine injuries, according to a survey by the National Center for Catastrophic Sports Injury Research at the University of North Carolina. \nAnother six players died of indirect causes: Three were heart-related, one was from heat stroke and two were caused by hypernatremia (an electrolyte imbalance) and water intoxication, the survey found. \n\"Certainly this is not going to be one of the low years,\" Robert Cantu, medical director for the NCCSIR and a professor at the Boston University School of Medicine, said during an interview earlier this month. \nThe past decade has seen an average of three fatalities each year directly attributable to high school football, the survey said. \nIn 2013, there were eight deaths directly linked to high school football. \nBetween 2005 and 2014, the deaths of 92 other high school football players were indirectly related to the sport, according to the NCCSIR survey. \nHere's a look at the other players who have died this season: \nRod Williams \nRoddrick Williams was a popular offensive lineman and tuba player at Georgia's Burke County High School. On the football field, the bespectacled 17-year-old was known for his hard play and lighthearted song and dance numbers that made teammates laugh. \nOn October 10, one day after the Burke County Bears took the field without their beloved No. 71, the Pride of Burke County symphonic band played his favorite songs as part of his funeral service. His tuba rested on the 50-yard line in the school stadium. \nWilliams' October 5 death, two weeks after he collapsed during a practice in Waynesboro, was heart-related, Burke County Coroner Susan Salemi told CNN, declining to elaborate. \nThe 5-foot-11-inch, 300-pound junior collapsed September 22 shortly after football practice began, CNN affiliate WSB reported. The school trainer performed CPR until an ambulance arrived, according to the station. \nKenney Bui \nKenney Bui, 17, a wide receiver and defensive back for Evergreen High School near Seattle, died October 5 after suffering a traumatic brain injury during a game the previous Friday. \nVideo shows Bui making a hard tackle on a running play and getting back up, CNN affiliate KIRO reported. He was later taken away in an ambulance after taking a hit to the head near the end of the game. \nBui died from blunt force injuries to the head, according to the King County medical examiner's office. \nHis father, Ngon, a janitor in Seattle's public schools, told KIRO he learned of his son's death via text message: \"Your son is dead.\" \nClose to tears, Ngon Bui said, \"I love my son. I don't want nothing to happen to ... kids. And a parent to have to worry.\" \nBui's father asked his son to quit the game after a previous injury, but the teen's mother and Bui overruled him, the station reported. \nBui suffered a mild concussion in early September but had been medically cleared to play, Highline School District spokeswoman Catherine Carbone Rogers told CNN earlier this month. \nEvan Murray \nEvan Murray, a senior at Warren Hills Regional High School in northwest New Jersey, died September 25 after leaving the game with an injury, according to the school. \nA GoFundMe page to assist Murray's family said the quarterback and captain -- a popular student who also played baseball and basketball -- \"felt woozy\" after getting hit in the backfield. \n\"He was always there for all of his teammates. Played hard, all the time. He's going to be sorely missed by everybody,\" baseball coach Michael Quinto told CNN affiliate News 12 New Jersey. \nBen Hamm \nBen Hamm, a junior linebacker and team captain at Wesleyan Christian School in Bartlesville, Oklahoma, died September 19 after suffering a head injury during a tackle in a game eight days earlier, CNN affiliate KOTV reported. \nHamm was in a coma after being rushed to the hospital with bleeding in his brain, according to the station. \nHis father, Steve, wrote of his son's death on the team's Facebook page: \"Ben's condition has deteriorated ... because of a lack of oxygen in his blood and this morning I am saddened to let you know that the world has lost a spiritual warrior!\" \nTyrell Cameron \nTyrell Cameron, 16, a student at Franklin Parish High School in Louisiana, died September 4 after a game injury, the Franklin Parish coroner's office said. He died at Franklin Medical Center. \nCameron was hit during a punt return in the fourth quarter of the game against Sterlington High School, Franklin Parish head coach Barry Sebren told CNN affiliate KNOE.
