Director Gunashekar has tried to tell her story on the big screen on a budget of Rs 80 crore (in 3D and 2D) with VFX and the works. Rudhramadevi’s story is unique in that her parents conceal her identity as a girl and she’s seen as a young prince by the entire world. At a time when queens were not seen as fit to reign kingdoms, Minister Shivadeviah (Prakash Raj) advises King Ganapatideva (Krishnam Raju) to let the world think his daughter was a boy and, hence, Rudhradeva (Anushka Shetty) is born. Rudhradeva is a handsome young prince who knows how to wield the sword and rule like a king. Two other princes - Gona Ganna Reddy (Allu Arjun) and Veerabhadra (Rana Daggubati) – come into her life and both play important roles. Veerabhadra, Rudhradeva’s best friend, falls in love with Rudhramadevi while the rebellious prince-disguised-as-a-thief Gona Ganna Reddy helps Rudhramadevi subtly. How is Rudhradeva’s real identity revealed What happens when everyone knows she’s actually a woman? How does she save her kingdom?\nWhat’s hot: The whole story obviously revolves around Anushka who plays Rudhradeva/ Rudhramadevi. The juxtaposition of the male versus female that Anushka constantly goes through in the film is easily handled by the talented actress. Actresses here rarely get films where they are the protagonist and in this film, Anushka has proved that an actress can carry off as film as well as any actor. Despite the few liberties director Gunashekar has taken, he has kept the script as close to the actual history as possible. He brings to life the story of this warrior princess whose history is hardly known about in India today. Prakash Raj, Allu Arjun and Rana Daggubati also deliver some fine performances as per their roles. Music director Ilaiyaraaja’s work is apt for this period film.\nWhat’s not: Considering that this film released after the super-successful Baahubali , there are bound to be comparisons between the two. Rudhramadevi is far below average on many aspects. Right from the first scene, it’s like watching one of those poorly-made historical TV dramas. The sets are tacky, the costumes and dialogue-delivery similar to TV soaps and the battle scenes just as amateurish. The grandeur for the big screen is missing and the VFX is another story altogether. Take for instance, the elephant scene with Rudhradeva, Allu Arjun’s scenes where he’s suspended in the sky for some reason or a later scene where the elephant, like a Trojan, is burnt. The VFX is plain terrible. So one wonders what the Rs 80 crore was spent on. In the first half, there seem too many bathing scenes involving Rudhradeva (is it for the audience’s benefit?) till she turns into this killer princess in the second half. After the first hour of a heavily dialogue-filled narrative, it starts to drag and makes viewing a pain. Allu Arjuna and Rana Daggubati save the day with their looks. But why Rana chose to do this film after a fabulous film like Baahubali , is a question he needs to answer. Though director Gunashekar’s script may have looked good on paper, the making is far less desirable.\nWhat to do: Anushka Shetty deserves a pat on her back for doing this film and being convinced with the script. Wait for the film to premiere on television.", "external_links": ["https://apis.google.com/js/platform.js", "https://plus.google.com/u/1/104841276583076607065/posts"], "published": "2015-10-17T18:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T08:03:59.784+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
