Had Castro been hustling on the double, the Cubs would have been up 2-1.\nIn the bottom of the inning, Lester appeared to work himself out of a two-on, one-out jam when Harvey bunted right to Rizzo for what looked like an easy double play, but third baseman Kris Bryant dropped the ball on the transfer and Harvey was safe at first.\nInstead of being out of the inning, Curtis Granderson singled home a run and the Mets had a 2-1 lead.\nThey increased it to 3-1 in the sixth when Travis d'Arnaud sat on a 3-1 Lester changeup and hit a bomb to the Big Apple in center field.\nAt that point, with the run the Cubs didn't score and the one they gave away, it should have been a 2-2 game, but they trailed by a pair.\nThe Mets failed to turn a pair of double plays in the seventh, but Harvey pitched out of trouble when he struck out Baez and pinch hitter Tommy La Stella to end the inning.\n\"His command was outrageous,\" Joe Maddon said of Harvey. \"You know he has good stuff, but when his command is like that he's really tough.\"\nNew York added a run in the seventh playing small ball, and Kyle Schwarber got it back in the eighth on his fourth home run in six postseason games, a monster shot to right center, but the 2 runs the Cubs flushed were the difference in the game.\nHarvey was the big story for the Mets after a strange September amid the bizarre innings-limit controversy. The New York starter was going on his regular rest against the Cubs after a mediocre outing against the Dodgers in the NLDS, and he looked like the real Harvey again.\n\"The biggest thing was I finally had a stretch here where I could be on a normal routine,\" Harvey said. \"I'm not using 10 days off as an excuse, but going down the stretch there we had 10 days off here, 10 days off there, and as a starting pitcher to get into a routine with that going on, it's a little bit difficult.\n\"I was mostly excited to get a chance to get back out there again and have a normal routine.\"\nSo the Cubs trail in the series but did not seem fazed Saturday night, knowing they have ace Jake Arrieta going in Game 2 Sunday and a good chance to turn it into a best-of-five.\nExpect more long balls … and hope the Cubs can do the little things it takes to win.\nbrozner@dailyherald.com\n• Hear Barry Rozner on WSCR 670-AM and follow him @BarryRozner on Twitter.\n MLB Cubs Rozner, Barry Baseball Pro Sports Newsletter", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share"], "published": "2015-10-18T06:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T12:35:15.964+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
