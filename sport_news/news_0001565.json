After five weeks of action, some trends have emerged but it’s been too early to make unequivocal statements.\nAdChoices After this weekend’s slate of games, some teams will have crossed beyond the point of no return, while others will make significant statements regarding their supremacy.\nThese following games will tell us a lot about the rest of the 2015 NFL season, and they’re simply too good to miss.\nCincinnati Bengals vs. Buffalo Bills\n© AP Photo/Frank Victores, File Cincinnati Bengals quarterback Andy Dalton (14) celebrates after scoring a touchdown in the second half of an NFL football game against the Seattle Seahawks in Cincinnati. Dalton got booed in Cincinnati over the summer when he was introduced before an All-Star celebrity softball game. He doesn't hear boos anymore, not with the Bengals (5-0) unbeaten. Of the early games on Sunday, this one stands out as the one to watch.\nA big win at home for the Bills would put them at 4-2, which would be phenomenal considering the many impactful injuries dealt to the offense. On the flip side, a road win against a top defense would be another huge step taken by Andy Dalton and his surging offense and would give the Bengals a 6-0 record.\nBut can Andy Dalton continue performing like a top quarterback, or will Rex Ryan’s defense snuff the life out of the Red Rocket? We’ve seen the likes of Eli Manning and Tom Brady have success against the Bills, so it’s quite possible Dalton will do the same if he continues dealing like we’ve seen this year.\nCan Buffalo’s offense stay afloat while Tyrod Taylor likely watches from the sideline? Surely, if EJ Manuel plays up to his potential. Of further concern could be finding an answer to the team’s injury woes at the running back position. Both LeSean McCoy and Karlos Williams remain unavailable with injuries, and there ins’t much of a rushing attack without them.\nPrediction: Bengals take that next step and win, 27-24.\nCarolina Panthers vs. Seattle Seahawks\n© Reinhold Matay-USA TODAY Sports Carolina Panthers quarterback Cam Newton (1) celebrates during the first half of an NFL football game against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers at Raymond James Stadium. This is easily the most enticing game in the afternoon on Sunday.\nThe once unbeatable Seahawks are suddenly vulnerable, but their home field is still hollowed ground that usually grants victory to Seattle. The team’s two wins both came at home this year, and the Panthers must be sharp to avoid becoming victim No. 3.\nSeattle has beaten Carolina five times in a row, too, and Panthers quarterback Cam Newton hasn’t been sharp going up against the “Legion of Boom” in the past.\nThings could certainly change this time around. In addition to the boost getting linebacker Luke Kuechly (concussion) back will be for the team’s already impressive defense, Newton has been outstanding this year. In his fifth season now, there is no doubt he has full command of the offense and understands his role. Newton has thrown seven touchdown passes compared to just two interceptions this year, and he’s added another two scores on the ground.\nAnd, given the way Seattle’s offense has sputtered this year, nobody should be surprised if Carolina’s feisty front seven feasts on Russell Wilson’s body. The dual-threat quarterback has already been sacked 22 times (leading the league).\nPrediction: Carolina reverses the trend by winning in Seattle, 24-13.\nNew England Patriots vs. Indianapolis Colts\n© Brian Spurlock-USA TODAY Sports The Sunday night showdown between the Patriots and Colts certainly qualifies as must-see TV. Grudge matches are the best, especially when Tom Brady is involved, and this one is being featured on NBC’s \"Sunday Night Football.\" New England’s quarterback pretended not to care about the fact Indy called him out on manipulating air pressure in footballs (allegedly), but his fire burns far too hot.\nAnyone thinking Brady isn’t staying awake at night thinking about how he’s going to destroy the Colts is just not seeing the world through the correct lens.\nThis entire season so far has been one big grudge match for Brady, and the results speak for themselves. New England is undefeated, and Brady is putting together a virtuoso of a campaign that rivals anything he’s done in seasons past.\nOn the other side, there might be a few fires of a different kind burning in the locker room of the Colts. There have been rumors of head coach Chuck Pagano’s impending departure following the season since early in the 2015 calendar year. And after the team’s 0-2 start, those rumors heated up in a big way. Three wins in a row to the Titans, Jaguars and Texans haven’t really done much to put them to rest, either.\nThis upcoming game against the Patriots could be a defining moment in the season for Pagano. Given the lack of competition in the AFC South, Indy will probably get into the playoffs, even if it is limping badly. But a big loss at home to the hated Patriots could doom the head coach.\nPrediction: Tom Brady gets his revenge and the Patriots win 45-28.\nNew York Giants vs. Philadelphia Eagles\n© Matthew Emmons-USA TODAY Sports New York Giants quarterback Eli Manning (10) throws in the pocket against the Dallas Cowboys at AT&T Stadium. NFC East rivalry game on \"Monday Night Football\"? Yes, please.\nIt seems everyone expects the New York Giants to run away with the NFC East while the Dallas Cowboys are reeling with injuries to Dez Bryant and Tony Romo. No doubt the Eagles will have something to say about all that at home this Monday night.\nThe Giants could conceivably be 5-0 if not for some really bad decisions made by Tom Coughlin and Eli Manning. That said, the receiving corps has been recently decimated with injuries, and if not for another remarkable sticky-hands type of catch at the end of Week 5’s contest — at home against the one-win San Francisco 49ers — New York would be 2-3.\nPhilly, which actually is 2-3, looked like it finally got some things figured out last weekend against the New Orleans Saints. And, if DeMarco Murray can get another 20 carries this week to match his opportunities in the big win over the Saints, then the offense should be golden against New York’s porous defense.\nGiven the fact that the Eagles are at home, and that their front seven on defense is dominant, it’s easy to see Philadelphia sitting pretty atop the NFC East heading into Week 7 with a record of 3-3.\nPrediction: Eagles win at home, 31-27.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.yardbarker.com/", "http://sportsnaut.com/2015/09/buying-and-selling-hot-takes-from-nfl-week-1/9/", "http://sportsnaut.com/2015/09/chuck-pagano-slams-andrew-luck-and-ryan-grigson-after-loss-to-jets/", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "http://sportsnaut.com/2015/10/tom-brady-is-not-looking-for-revenge-against-colts/"], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T01:06:02.386+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
