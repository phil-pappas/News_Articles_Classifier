But it wasn’t as tall, and it wasn’t even green. But the tall structure has been an iconic part of Red Sox history since Fenway opened in 1912. Photo courtesy of Boston Public Library Previous -- of -- Next The wall originally had a 10-foot grass incline in front of the fence nicknamed “Duffy’s Cliff,” coined after Red Sox outfielder Duffy Lewis for mastering the uphill territory. The incline was used to balance the grade between street and field level, and to seat overspilled crowds. Boston Globe Archives Previous -- of -- Next A five-hour fire destroyed much of Fenway Park in 1934. When the park was rebuilt, a 37-foot left-field wall with an electronic scoreboard replaced the 25-foot tall, left-field fence. Photo courtesy of Boston Public Library Previous -- of -- Next The new wall was built out of concrete and tin. Boston Globe Archives Previous -- of -- Next Advertisements draped down “The Wall,” as it was called at the time, until the ballpark ditched wall-ads in 1947. That same year, the wall was painted green, paving the way for the beloved “Green Monster” nickname. Deniis Brearley / Boston Red Sox Previous -- of -- Next Advertisement Previous -- of -- Next Taller, green, and ad-free, the Green Monster started taking its current shape. Boston Globe Archives Previous -- of -- Next Then the Green Monster was dismantled before reconstruction began, prior to the 1976 season. Photo courtesy of Boston Red Sox Previous -- of -- Next 1976 marked the final restoration of the Green Monster. The use of the wall’s electronic scoreboard ended, National League scores were removed, the interior was replaced, a new exterior replaced the old tin panels, and new 6-foot tall padding protected players when they crashed into the wall. Boston Globe Archives Previous -- of -- Next The scoreboard began being updated by hand from behind the wall after the construction of a center-field scoreboard in ‘76. Boston Globe Archives Previous -- of -- Next The Green Monster hasn’t been completely rehashed since the ‘70s. Boston Globe Archives Previous -- of -- Next Advertisement Previous -- of -- Next Three 25-foot high “Monster Refreshment” Coke bottles hung from the left-field light tower over the Green Monster from 1997 to 2008. The Fenway/Coca-Cola project benefited the Jimmy Fund. Barry Chin / The Boston Globe Previous -- of -- Next The Green Monster was given 269 barstool seats in 2003. Until then, the Green Monster had a 23-foot net above to protect stores on Lansdowne Street from flying balls, and a worker would climb up a ladder to retrieve any balls. The ladder is now obsolete but still in place. Stan Grossfeld / The Boston Globe Previous -- of -- Next Now, fans regularly enjoy a game from “Monster seats” and look out for flying balls. Jack Maley / Boston Red Sox Previous -- of -- Next Ads were also placed on the wall in 2003—that was the first time since ads were banned in 1946. National League scores were re-added to the wall’s hand-operated scoreboard, and permanent ads were added above the wall.
