It would be closer to 90 percent Steelers fans if that game had been in L.A.\n• People in charge of the football team and the stadium in San Diego have displayed little interest in improving either. Season-seat people are fed up. They’re selling their seats on the secondary market where visiting teams’ fans will purchase them at inflated prices, so Chargers fans will be in the minority again for the next game at Qualcomm – Oct. 25 against the Raiders.\n• Local Steelers fans are broken down into three categories: former residents of the Pittsburgh area who left that area because they know Southern California is superior; Southern California natives who become fans of whatever team has success, no matter that team’s city; and those fans’ children who are forced to cheer for their parents’ team just like how those kids are forced to work the mine in “Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom.”\n• The Chargers would make a lot more money if they sold visiting team’s gear at the souvenir stands at Qualcomm Stadium.\n• Average NFL teams weekly are only two or three plays away from winning or losing a game to a good team. The Chargers are an average NFL team. If they executed better on two or three plays, the Chargers would have beaten Pittsburgh.\n• The Chargers go to Green Bay this Sunday. They will be 2-4 after that. That’s not a horrible situation because their following five games are all winnable, so San Diego could be 7-4 with a home game Dec. 6 against Denver.\n• AC/DC, having ruined baseball stadiums they played during their summer tour, looks to be the likely halftime performer for this season’s Super Bowl.\n• Irrelevant Week founder Paul Salata celebrates his 89th birthday Saturday. Salata wore No. 89 when he played football at USC. You couldn’t meet a kinder or more generous person.\n• Jim Rome’s Jungle Racing horse-ownership firm added another big winner to its collection Sunday at Santa Anita when Stays In Vegas won the $100,000 Surfer Girl Stakes. Jungle Racing co-owns the horse with Kevin Nisch’s KMN Racing and Jamie Roth’s LNJ Foxwoods.\n• If one of his USC coaches mishandled a personnel situation as poorly as USC athletic director Pat Haden mishandled the Steve Sarkisian situation, Haden would fire that coach.\n• Our sports section ran a list of nine potential USC football coaching candidates. Only one, Tom Herman, head coach at the University of Houston, seems like a man who would leave his current situation for the challenges and financial opportunities of USC.\n• Golden West and Saddleback are tied for first in the community college football National Southern League standings. Both are 2-0 in league. This Saturday, Golden West has a bye, Saddleback is home against Grossmont (0-2), Santa Ana (0-1) plays Fullerton (0-2) at Yorba Linda High and Orange Coast (1-0) is home against Palomar (1-1).\n• Dean Chance’s 1964 season was the best season of any Angels pitcher. Chance, who died Sunday, was 20-9 with a 1.65 ERA and won the Cy Young Award when there was only one Cy Young Award, not one for each league as there is now. He pitched a franchise-record 11 shutouts in ’64.\n• As a batter in those pre-designated hitter days, Chance hit into only two double plays in 662 career at-bats. That’s because he rarely made contact. Chance struck out 420 times in those 662 at-bats; his career batting average was .066, his career strikeout average .634.\n• If Texas beats Toronto and Houston beats Kansas City in Wednesday’s American League Divisional Series Game 5s, people will say what a great division the AL West is, with two representatives advancing to the ALCS. If Texas and Houston lose, people will say what a weak division it was. Which is messed up thinking, but that’s the way it works.\n• Four of the past five National League managers of the year are no longer with their teams: Matt Williams (2014 winner with Washington) was fired a few weeks ago; Davey Johnson (2012, Washington) resigned after the ’13 season; Kirk Gibson (2011, Arizona) was fired during the ’14 season; and Bud Black (2010, San Diego) was fired this season.\n• Clint Hurdle was NL manager of the year in 2013 with Pittsburgh, where he still is the manager.\n• The seventh game of the World Series is Nov. 4. The way the playoffs have gone so far, with so many Game 5s in the division series, a World Series Game 7 would be fitting.\n• TV networks are missing out if they aren’t pursuing Angels radio analyst Mark Langston for studio or game coverage work.\n• The Chase Utley slide … he was trying to break up the double play. His intention was not to injure Mets shortstop Ruben Tejada. But in the act of breaking up the double play, Utley was excessively reckless and endangered Tejada – and that was on the mind of MLB chief baseball officer Joe Torre when he correctly assessed the two-game suspension on Utley.\n• Torre played in the rough-and-tumble 1960s and ’70s. He played in the National League that had Pete Rose and Larry Bowa and all sorts of crazies running the bases. Torre was a catcher for much of his career, too, so he knows all about the violent side of the game.\n• Torre worked with the late Bob Starr on Angels TV broadcasts in the ’80s. The San Diego Chicken, the first of the Sesame Street-style mascots to work baseball stadiums, was to make an appearance at Anaheim Stadium. Starr promoted it by saying the Chicken and Torre would race, Torre would get a head start and, Starr concluded, “we’ll see the Chicken catch a Torre.”\n• Chicken cacciatore is a dish, you see, and … never mind.\nContact the writer: sfryer@ocregister.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T06:43:25.067+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
