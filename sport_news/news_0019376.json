But don't worry if you can't afford to visit because Portland Cocktail Week is bringing those cities to you.\nCocktail Week, kicking off this weekend, is a chance to show off our local bar community to hundreds of mixologists flowing in from across the country. The National Bartender Showcase — which caps five days of frenzied classes, field trips and all-important cocktail \"research\" — gives the out-of-towners a chance to exhibit some hometown pride, too.\nEach U.S. city with an active United States Bartenders Guild chapter was invited to participate. And 46 signed up, with one star bartender from each presiding at the event, set for Thursday at the Really Big Video event space in the Pearl District.\n\"Bartenders have been asked to make a cocktail that best showcases their skills but also evokes their city,\" says Lindsey Johnson, who co-founded Cocktail Week a half dozen years ago with local bar luminary David Shenaut. \"In the past, we've seen green chiles included from the New Mexico contingent, hot chocolate from Colorado, local bitters from Detroit.\"\nThe showcase, which costs $20 at the door and includes food and drink, is one of a few Cocktail Week events open to the public, along with the U.S. Bartenders Guild party that immediately follows and the Swig 'n Swine bash, which kicks things off in a big way — lots of pig, punch and music — at the White Owl Social Club in Southeast Portland. That event, hosted by national bar consultation and marketing firm Bon Vivants, benefits Knowledge is Power Program charter schools.\nIn between these big tentpole parties, education remains the heart of Cocktail Week. Though she hints at some big changes ahead for 2016, Johnson says this year things won't change much from the successful program of the past couple of years, which has seen attendance grow annually, with just under 4,000 last year. This year, Johnson anticipates about a thousand more people — growth reflected in a new site for classes at the Oregon Convention Center.\n\"This year, a number of past students will be getting up in front of the class, which is always so exciting,\" says Johnson, CEO of the wine and spirits marketing firm Lush Life Productions. \"I love seeing students grow in their careers to the point that they then become the educators. Truly, that's what this is all about.\"\nAlthough certain classes and events allow only enrolled Cocktail Week students, those who register for a festival pass online can attend selected events on a first-come, first-served basis, including audit classes and after-school activities, where nobody goes thirsty because they're generally sponsored by major spirit companies. For example, Hennessy hosts a closing-night party at Bit House Saloon . Again this year, a handful of local bars will host late-night mash-ups with famed watering holes from across the country, offering up collaborative cocktails.\nAlthough some of these events are closed or a tough ticket — and a lot of the parties are geared toward industry professionals looking to network — there's still plenty for local enthusiasts to get excited about. Many Portland bars looking to show off for visitors will take part in an unofficial capacity, from simple specials to, in the case of Teardrop Cocktail Lounge , a tribute to past bartenders who just might be visiting town.\nThe venerable Pearl District lounge's fall menu features eight drinks under its regular \"friends\" section from Teardrop alumni leading or working in bar programs across the country. One of those is New Orleans' Ricky Gomez, whose Americano??? — a meeting of bar-world and coffee-world Americanos, triple question mark included — mixes cold-brewed coffee, vermouth and Campari.\nIt's the kind of cocktail that may just have you amped up to see what top bartenders around the country — perhaps some Portland natives returning home — will whip up in that closing bartender showcase.\n\"Where else can you get a cocktail from Pittsburgh and one from Hawaii made under the same roof?\" Johnson says.", "external_links": ["http://www.whiteowlsocialclub.com/#about"], "published": "2015-10-16T13:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T16:07:01.477+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
