Germany is a powerhouse — a four-time world champion that wins big games by the bushel. Its World Cup typically starts in the quarterfinals, which is a stage the U.S. has reached just once in the past 70 years. When Germany faces a must-win situation, it typically wins.\n• All of Sports Illustrated’s coverage for USA’s playoff against Mexico\nU.S. coach Jurgen Klinsmann, a product of that German powerhouse, is trying to lay the foundation for a similarly successful program in his adopted home. One significant hurdle the 1990 World Cup winner faces is the dearth of games against the teams he’s chasing. Klinsmann hasn’t been shy about scheduling tough friendlies in forbidding places. He’s taken the U.S. to Italy, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Chile and elsewhere. But in the end, those were friendlies — matches the opponent didn’t have to win. Desperation is hard to fake. There is no crucible like official competition.\nKlinsmann has coached 75 games with the U.S. Only four came in official competition against teams from outside CONCACAF (Ghana, Portugal, Germany and Belgium at last summer’s World Cup). His 76th game in charge, Saturday against Mexico in nearby Pasadena, Calif., is critical because a win would guarantee at least three more of those vital, meaningful matches, plus a sneak peak at life and logistics inside Russia, the 2018 World Cup host.\nPlanet Futbol Jurgen Klinsmann's history vs. Mexico: Undefeated as player, coach by Grant Wahl", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/BrianStraus"], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T09:16:36.521+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
