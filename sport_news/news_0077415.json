Here's @coachBillick 's stats as an NFL \"football player\" 0 games played 0 catches for 0 yards. Oh and 0 fg attempts https://t.co/lCsyvDQmtD \n— Jon Ryan (@JonRyan9) October 11, 2015 \nBillick was drafted as a tight end in 1977, but never played in the NFL. \nIt’s unclear what, exactly, Billick has against kickers, but they’re arguably more important than ever in today’s NFL, particularly with the new extra point rules. A high quality kicker can be the difference between victory and defeat in a close game, as many NFL teams could attest. Saying they’re not football players just seems ignorant. \nAnd as an added bonus, Ryan happens to be one of the funniest dudes in the NFL . Billick needs to cut the guy some slack.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T19:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T20:09:13.753+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
