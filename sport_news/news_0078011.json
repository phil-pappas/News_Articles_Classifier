With a win and a Laurier loss at Queen’s, the then 3-5 Gee-Gees would make the OUA playoffs. The Gee-Gees will have to do it against a Toronto team that ranks sixth in the country in rushing yards. However, the Varsity Blues allow an average of 452.4 yards, and score 21.4 points per game, while allowing 25.6. This bodes well for an Ottawa offence which averages 36.4 points per game. \nThe Carleton Ravens, who knocked off the Gee-Gees 48-45 in a thrilling double-overtime Panda Game matchup three weeks ago, host (at MNP Park, 1 p.m.) the mighty Guelph Gryphons, who have a 6-1 record. With a win, the 5-2 Ravens would host their first OUA football playoff game since 1986. That would be a big deal. \n“In Year 3, our No. 1 goal was to try and get into the playoffs,” said Ravens coach Steve Sumarah. “We accomplished that. Now, we have an opportunity to host a playoff game. That’s something we weren’t thinking about at that point.” \nFor Sumarah, whose Ravens were in a final-regular-season-game must-win situation against Queen’s to qualify for the playoffs a year ago (then lost 37-15), he hopes his team doesn’t get lost in the moment against Guelph. \n“Man for man, we have the type of talent to compete,” he said. “But the biggest challenge is still us. Sometimes we battle our own instincts and self doubt. That showed against Western. It seemed like before we even got off the bus, we’d lost. Hopefully (Saturday), we can get past that. I hope we just go out, execute and have some fun.” \nMeanwhile, Ottawa’s junior football team, the Sooners, travels to Hamilton for an OFC semi-final playoff game against the Hurricanes at 4 p.m. Both teams finished at 6-2, but Hamilton won the tiebreaker based on a 38-31 win over Ottawa earlier this season. With the OFC’s second-leading rusher, Jurrell Gaddishaw, in their backfield, the Hurricanes surprised the Sooners with their game plan. \n“They were very effective passing the ball against us,” said Sooners coach John Buck. “They had an empty backfield and they picked away at us. They can run a jumbo set with three tight ends. They can beat you in many ways. This time, we’re prepared for anything.” \nThe Sooners have a strong running game, something they’ll look to establish again Saturday. Kwasi Gyamfi led the OFC in rushing with 783 yards and had eight touchdowns. \nDechaun Beals, who had 466 yards rushing, will also be in the backfield. \n“We’ve sort of evolved into a run-first team,” said Buck.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T03:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T13:52:23.244+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
