That's usually a safe guess. After all, Brantley is a career .329 hitter with runners in scoring position (RISP).\nBut he's not No. 1 this season on the Tribe, despite hitting .324 in those situations.\nThe top hitter in the clutch was ... Francisco Lindor.\nYet another reason for him to be Rookie of the Year.\nAs a team, the Tribe batted .250 with runners in scoring position. That was No. 11 in the American League, and it explained some of their problems scoring runs.\nThat's especially true when you add in the fact that they were .212 with the bases loaded, dead last in the league. Even Lindor had a problem with the bases loaded, as he was 1-of-9.\nHere's the breakdown of RISP for the Tribe in 2015:\nLindor, .350. Chris Johnson, .333. Michael Brantley, .324. Ryan Raburn, .313. Jason Kipnis, .298. Lonnie Chisenhall, .277. David Murphy, .265. Carlos Santana, .261. Jerry Sands, .233 Mike Aviles, .224 Michael Bourn, .218 Roberto Perez, .216 Jose Ramirez, .200 Brandon Moss, Giovanny Urshela, .185. Abraham Almonte, .184 Yan Gomes, .141 Nick Swisher, .138 ABOUT ZIMMER AND FRAZIER\nDuring the post-season meetings, the Indians talked about top outfield prospects Brad Zimmer and Clint Frazier.\nA few points were made:\n1. The 21-year-old Frazier had a major breakthrough in the second half of his season at Class A Lynchburg. Frazier was a first-round pick in 2013. Frazier batted .248 before the All-Star break. After, it was .325 (.961 OPS). The key was Frazier no longer being so fixated on pulling the ball.\n2. For the year, he hit .285 (.842 OPS) with 16 HR and 72 RBI. Frazier turned 21 on September 6. The right-handed hitting outfielder will open 2016 at Class AA Akron. The Indians believe he will soon hit with even more power, and do it to all fields.\n3. Zimmer fouled a pitch off his foot in late June. The foot was x-rayed, and no break was found. Zimmer continued to play. He batted .308 (.896 OPS) with 10 HR and 39 RBI in 286 at bats for Class A Lynchburg. He also stole 32 bases. He was promoted to Akron, but batted only .219 (.687 OPS) with 6 HR and 24 RBI in 187 at bats.\n4. Zimmer didn't tell anyone that his foot was bothering him until after the season. It was x-rayed again and revealed a hairline fracture. He finished the season 1-of-27. The team's top pick in the 2014, Zimmer and the Tribe were relieved to discover the problem. It explained his second-half problems and drop in speed.\n5. Zimmer will be 23 on November 27. He is expected to open 2016 in the same outfield as Frazier. Zimmer will be in center. Frazier will play left or right. The Indians believe one (or maybe both) will be big league ready by 2017. Zimmer could advance faster because he is older.\nABOUT THE LITTLE TRADES\nThe Indians made three small deals during the season. I'm not talking about the Nick Swisher/Michael Bourn for Chris Johnson deal with Atlanta. That was a major trade because of the payroll implications.\nHere's a look at the other small mid-season moves:\n1. The best was sending lefty reliever Marc Rzepczynski to San Diego for Abraham Almonte. Rzepczynski had a miserable time with the Padres, 0-1 with a 7.36 ERA in 14 2/3 innings. Almonte batted .264 (.766 OPS) with 5 HR, 20 RBI and was 6-of-6 in stolen bases. In 196 plate appearances, he also had 6 triples and 9 doubles.\n2. The Indians rated Almonte's defense above average in center field. Manager Terry Francona praised Almonte's baseball acumen, throwing to the cutoff man, etc. Fangraphs rated him at No. 9 among 17 American League center fielders in defense. He was a definite upgrade over Bourn, who was well below average.\n3. Almonte will have a role on the team next year, either as an extra outfielder or a starter. It depends what moves can be made to help the outfield in the off-season.\n4. The Tribe traded David Murphy to the Angels for shortstop Eric Stamets. Murphy hit .265 (.681 OPS) with 5 HR and 23 RBI after the July 28 trade. He has a team option for $7 million and it's doubtful the Angels will pick it up.\n5. The Indians considered Murphy a below average right fielder, and rating services such as fangraphs agree. That opened the position for Lonnie Chisenhall, who recreated himself as an outfielder. Chisenhall played an outstanding right field. The question for him will be if he can hit enough to play every day. But had they kept Murphy, they would not have had an opening for Chisenhall.\n6. Stamets is a very good fielding shortstop. He made only five errors in 95 Class AA games. He played 33 errorless games at Akron after the deal. But Stamets batted only .197 (.500 OPS). The 24-year-old is a career .257 minor league hitter. A native of Dublin, Ohio, it's hard to see Stamets in the Majors unless he can figure out how to produce more with his bat.\n7. This is a two-part deal. Before the 2015 season, the Tribe sent second base prospect Joey Wendle to Oakland for Brandon Moss. With the Tribe, Moss had a miserable time, batting .217 (.695 OPS) with 15 HR and 50 RBI. He hated playing in Progressive Field. He thought the wind was usually blowing in from his power zone of right field. He had only two homers in 185 at bats in Cleveland.\n8. Wendle had a good year in Class AAA for Oakland, batting .289 (.765 OPS) with 10 HR and 57 RBI. He batted .342 after the All-Star break and was named the All-Pacific Coast League second baseman. He has a good chance to make Oakland's roster next season.\n9. The Tribe traded Moss to the Cardinals for pitcher Rob Kaminsky. He was the Cardinals first-round draft pick in 2013. In the minors, he has a career 14-11 record with a 2.22 ERA. Last season, he was 6-6 with a 2.24 ERA in Class A. He had some minor back problems and didn't pitch in the last three weeks of the season. Kaminsky is an excellent prospect. He had a 1.79 ERA in his last 10 starts.\n10. After the trade, Moss batted .250 (.753 OPS) with 4 HR and 8 RBI in 151 plate appearances for the Cardinals. Moss is not a free agent, but arbitration eligible. He earned $6.5 million in 2014. The Cardinals have some interest in bringing him back, but it will depend on the price.\nTerry's Talkin' Browns Terry's Talkin' Cavs", "external_links": ["http://espn.go.com/mlb/team/stats/batting/_/name/cle/split/39/cleveland-indians"], "published": "2015-10-17T17:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T17:18:23.955+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
