After initially holding out hope that Lynch would be able to play through a hamstring injury, the Seahawks announced Sunday that Lynch will not suit up this week.\nLynch played against the Bears this past Sunday, but received only five carries and was on the field for just 11 snaps before suffering a knock to his hamstring. On Wednesday, ESPN's Adam Schefter reported that Lynch's status for Monday should be considered 50/50. \nBut Lynch was downgraded from questionable to out on the Seahawks' injury report Sunday.\nLast week, with Lynch sidelined for much of the game, the Seahawks turned to rookie Thomas Rawls , who carried the ball 16 times for 104 yards. Meanwhile, veteran Fred Jackson only received two carries, but he could be in line for a heavier workload against the Lions.\nSo far this season, Lynch has failed to reach the end zone and has totaled only 128 yards on 38 carries. Beast Mode is currently stuck in neutral.
