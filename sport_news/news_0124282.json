After scoring the first three goals, the Islanders held off the Winnipeg Jets for a 4-2 victory on Monday afternoon.\nJohn Tavares scored a power-play goal and added two assists, and Thomas Greiss made 22 saves for his first Islanders win and the team’s first at Barclays Center.\nDuring the game, the N.H.L.’s deputy commissioner, Bill Daly, addressed complaints that the ice was slow and choppy during the Islanders’ season-opening defeat on Friday. After the 3-2 overtime loss to the Blackhawks, Tavares was particularly critical of the playing surface.\n“It’s something we look at in every arena,” Daly said. “There is a new building for the N.H.L., and it’s going to be a work in progress. I understand there were some comments from Friday night’s game. From what I understand, today the ice is much better.”\n Related Coverage Blackhawks 3, Islanders 2: A Chilly Housewarming in Brooklyn as the Islanders Are Handed a Loss OCT. 9, 2015 An Exhibit Looks Back as Brooklyn and Islanders Look Forward OCT. 8, 2015 Islanders Fans Came. They Didn’t See. They Griped. OCT. 9, 2015 Barclays Center, which opened three years ago, was not built expressly with hockey in mind and had hosted only five hockey games before Friday’s opener. This week will give the Islanders a better idea of life as a co-tenant, with two Nets preseason games, a concert and a Joel Osteen religious event scheduled around three Islanders games.\nThe arena felt colder for the matinee against the Jets, and Tavares said the ice had improved.\n“It seemed like it wasn’t as choppy today; pucks weren’t bouncing as much,” he said. “Towards the end, it was starting to get a little slow again, but it was better. On Friday, it was tough to make plays.”\nIslanders center Frans Nielsen was not as impressed, saying the ice was “hit or miss.”\nHe added: “The ice was really tough out there today. We tried to simplify and take more shots. I didn’t mind it too much the first game against Chicago, but it was worse today out there.”\nThe Islanders, who followed the opening loss with a 4-1 defeat in Chicago on Saturday, played a strong game on Monday from start to finish.\nTavares, who is the face of the franchise and is in his third season as the captain, was especially dominant against Winnipeg, recording five of his team’s 44 shots against Jets goaltender Ondrej Pavelec.\nTavares assisted on Ryan Strome’s power-play goal with 12 seconds left in the first period and set up Brock Nelson’s goal 6 minutes 46 seconds into the second period. About four minutes later, Tavares scored his second goal in two home games, rifling a rebound past Pavelec to make the score 3-0.\nThe crowd’s tenor was different from that of Friday night’s audience, which seemed edgy and not sure what to expect. The afternoon crowd included many families, creating an atmosphere that was more typical of matinees through the years at Nassau Coliseum.\nMost of the upper bowl was full, as it had been for the opener, with a majority of fans wearing blue-and-orange Islanders jerseys. The announced attendance was 11,183, about 4,600 short of capacity.\nStrome, who is playing on the top line with Tavares, smiled after the game as he contemplated the team’s first victory in Brooklyn.\n“Two games felt like 30 games when you lose the first two,” Strome said. “Obviously it’s great to get the win out of the way. It’s great for Brooklyn and great for the fans who have been loud and supportive. Hopefully we get on a roll here.”", "external_links": ["http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/10/sports/CITY-ISLANDERS-1/CITY-ISLANDERS-1-thumbStandard.jpg", "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/09/sports/09ISLANDERSweb1/09ISLANDERSweb1-thumbStandard.jpg", "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/10/sports/BARCLAYS/BARCLAYS-thumbStandard.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-13T06:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T05:51:26.206+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
