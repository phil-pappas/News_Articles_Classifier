Since then, the number of horses that might actually reach the gate Oct. 31 at Keeneland has narrowed significantly.\nSo to sort it all out, we'll track through the end of the month when connections mention the $5 million Classic, scheduled as Triple Crown winner American Pharoah's final race.\nAutomatic qualifiers still in training include Hard Aces (Santa Anita Gold Cup), American Pharoah (Haskell), Honor Code (Whitney). Beholder (Pacific Classic), Smooth Roller (Awesome Again) and Tonalist (Jockey Gold Cup Invitational).\nPROBABLE\nAmerican Pharoah -- The Zayat Stables colt is likely to train up to the Classic in Kentucky. At what point he ships, we still don't know. After American Pharoah's five-furlong workout Oct. 3, trainer Bob Baffert said he wouldn't load the Triple Crown winner on a planned flight to Louisville two days later. Pharoah's on the rebound from his first defeat of the year in the Travers Stakes.\nBeholder -- By way of wins in the Pacific Classic and Zenyatta, the mare's connections have their choice of the Classic or Breeders' Cup Distaff. The former is, for now, their preference as Beholder has won six straight. \"She's back galloping, doing great,\" trainer Richard Madnella said Oct. 3. The 5-year-old will breeze twice at Santa Anita and once at Keeneland.\nFrosted -- After a third-place effort in the Travers, trainer Kiaran McLaughlin said his gray colt could point next to the Jockey Gold Cup as a prep for the Breeders' Cup. Instead, he was entered for the Sept. 19 Pennsylvania Derby and won with jockey Joel Rosario back aboard. Jose Lezcano took the mount for the injured Rosario on Travers day. \"Joel has been working him since March and knows him so well and rides him so well,\" McLaughlin said.\nHonor Code -- Trainer Shug McGaughey cut the Whitney Stakes winner back to a mile in the Grade II Kelso, and a soft pace yielded a third-place result. \"I thought he kicked home strong,\" McGaughey said. \"...Going forward, this race should still set him up for Kentucky.\" McGaughey will ship Honor Code to Keeneland \"the last possible minute unless the weather gets bad up there.\"\nKeen Ice -- Trained by Dale Romans and owned by Donegal Racing, the Travers winner is a go for the Classic, connections said after his upset of American Pharoah. As with the Triple Crown winner, Keen Ice won't prep for it. Romans said after the Travers, \"I'd never seen him tired, but he's tired now, and with every right to be so.\" A typically slow worker, Keen Ice drilled four furlongs in 50.60 seconds Oct. 4 at Churchill Downs.\nSmooth Roller -- A 4-year-old Hard Spun gelding trained by Victor Garcia, he emerged as a Classic contender by taking the Awesome Again in just his fourth start overall and first attempt at a graded stakes. \" I thought we had a good shot in the race,\" said Garcia, a trainer since 1985, \"but the only way to find out is to run with the big boys, and the horse ran like I expected.\"\nTonalist -- The 2014 Belmont Stakes winner earned a signature win as a 4-year-old Oct. 3 by taking Belmont's Jockey Gold Cup Invitational, the final Classic \"Win and You're In\" test. \"If you believe in speed figures, this horse has been running very good races all year long,\" said trainer Christophe Clement. \"He went 111 when he won the Westchester, 105 in the Met, 107 in the Suburban, 110 in the Whitney and 111 for (the Jockey Gold Cup). He's been running similar (figures) all year long, very consistent. I've never been disappointed with him.\"\nPOSSIBLE\nGleneagles -- The Irish-bred turf star, as with American Pharoah, has a Coolmore connection. But that doesn't seem to be a problem as he targets an overseas trip to the Classic for trainer Aidan O'Brien, who last won at the Breeders' Cup with Magician in the 2013 Turf. He'll first run a mile at Ascot on Oct. 17, though, possibly too quick a turnaround to then head to Keeneland.\nLiam's Map -- A winner of Saratoga's Grade I Woodward on Sept. 5, Liam's Map will target the Breeders' Cup Classic or Mile. Trainer Todd Pletcher isn't yet sure which one. \"He just gets into that rhythm and he just runs horses off their feet,\" Pletcher said.\nHard Aces -- Not much has been said about the surprise Gold Cup winner's future since he finished sixth as a follow-up in the Pacific Classic and Awesome Again, the next tests on the west coast's road to the Breeders' Cup Classic.\nUNLIKELY\nLea -- Second in Churchill Downs' Stephen Foster Handicap and sixth in the Whitney, the 6-year-old trained by Bill Mott went a much different direction in contesting the Sept. 13 Woodbine Mile. He finished runner-up by a half length as the race favorite. \"He really handled the turf well and put in a very good run today,\" said Rosario, Lea's jockey. Will he stay on grass?\nOUT\nBayern -- Last year's Classic winner didn't return with the same form as a 4-year-old. The front-running colt went 0-for-5 in 2015, his finale a fade to third in the Awesome Again before connections announced Bayern's retirement from racing.\nDortmund -- For this 3-year-old's comeback -- he hasn't raced since the Preakness but has worked plenty in recent weeks -- Dortmund will likely prep for and then run Churchill Downs' Stephen Foster Handicap, the Grade I, $500,000 centerpiece to the track's Fall Meet.\nNoble Bird -- Trainer Mark Casse reported Sept. 12 that the Stephen Foster winner, unraced since running last in the Whitney, suffered a hip injury during that race and hadn't trained the same since. The 4-year-old will return to the track in 2016.\nTexas Red -- Co-owner Erich Brehm tweeted Sept. 17 that the son of Afleet Alex and winner of last year's Breeders' Cup Juvenile is done for the year due to cannon bone bruising.\nWicked Strong -- Without a win, but never worse than fifth since last year's Jim Dandy, he's set to enter the Breeders' Cup Dirt Mile rather than go the Classic distance again.\nUNKNOWNS\nA number of horses are listed by the Wynn and would make sense as contenders, but their connections haven't publicly discussed whether the Classic is a target. Among them are Catch a Flight, Cigar Street, Coach Inge, Commissioner, Constitution, Effinex, Hoppertunity, Madefromlucky, Prospect Park, Protonico, Race Day and V.E. Day.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T00:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T12:08:00.884+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
