Bedard Twitter Email Posted: Thu Oct. 8, 2015 Who’s going to have to step up after another Cowboys injury? Is Kirk Cousins for real this time? Is the Seahawks ’ defense really that much better with Kam Chancellor ? Andy Dalton for MVP? What would Rex be talking about if his Jets were 3–1? Those questions are discussed, along with a Brady–Rodgers debate among NFL executives and 10 thoughts about Week 5 in this week’s Blanket Coverage. But first, we need to pick up where we left off talking about the state of NFL offensive lines.\nTo get a sense for where offensive line play stands according to those that coach it, I made my annual pilgrimage to the C.O.O.L Clinic (C.O.O.L. stands for coaches of offensive linemen) in May and sat down with three generations of line coaches: Alex Gibbs, the semi-retired legendary godfather of the zone blocking scheme; Paul Boudreau , the Rams ’ offensive line coach who is in his 29th NFL season; and Joe Gilbert, who is in his third season directing the Colts and spent several years at the college level.\nThis is the second installment of a two-part roundtable. If you missed the first half in last week’s column, you can catch up here .\nAlex, you said there are more great left tackles than there have ever been. Can you expound on that?\nAlex Gibbs : There are more that are more than adequate. Exceptional? There have never been a massive amount of them simply because there’s a big mismatch between the best defensive pass rushers in football and the best offensive tackles. There's just too many of those guys that are coming on. There's such a disparity in skills that you have to just about be perfect. A lot of times you might be surprised to find out that Joe Thomas might be the fourth- or fifth-best guy if the coaches talked about them.\n• FANTASY FOOTBALL: Start ‘Em, Sit ‘Em | Rankings | Risers/Sliders\n​ Really?\nGibbs : Yeah. He hasn't exactly been on a team where he's had to do it, where it's been playoff time. Some of those guys have really played well. I think there's more. Now that we've been throwing so much more, and out of show [shotgun] pass, the pass rushers have a little bit of an advantage. I think how we get them, how we keep them and keep them well is just so crucial. I think [left tackles] are the second most valuable player on offense.\nWho do you think is the best left tackle in the game?\nGibbs : I don't know if I study them like that anymore. The only ones that you study after you finish the draft are the ones that become free agents. But they don't let the good ones get free. You don't get to study the good ones that other people have. Joe Thomas is good, don't get me wrong. But he hasn’t exactly been in the big, nasty and hard games like the kids from New England [ Nate Solder ] and Green Bay [ David Bakhtiari ], San Francisco [ Joe Staley ] ... there are more of them out there than you think. Could Bill O'Brien and Chip Kelly be the next coaches fired?\nJonathan Vilma and Tony Richardson discuss NFL coaches on the hot seat.\nWhat is the toughest position to play on the offensive line?\nJoe Gilbert : I would say center and left tackle. From the mental standpoint, we put a lot on that [center] to put everybody going in the right direction. The center has a lot on his plate. And we all have a tendency to put the onus on the guy on the left that's really going to block the backside of the quarterback one-on-one. You have a tendency to give the right tackle a little bit more help then you do.\nPaul Boudreau : I agree. The center is your quarterback. It's funny, I kind of hold my breath when they say, “We're talking about a center in the first round.” In my 29 years, there's a handful of guys that have been that first-round choice as a center. You’ve got guys in the league, Todd McClure played 14 years in Atlanta, was a seventh-round choice, Scott Wells was a seventh-round draft choice with Super Bowl, Pro Bowl. Tommy Nalen in Denver. Dan Koppen in New England. All fourth-, fifth-round draft choices. I cringe when they say this guy is a first-rounder because you can find some damn good football players at center. I told Jeff Fisher, I'll take five left tackles and teach one how to snap because there's a lot of teams that don't have one left tackle. I have three. If I was going to build a team, other than quarterback, I'm going to get left tackles and corners. You can't hide those guys.\nGibbs : Mentally, center, without question. But physically, the left tackle.\nIs it more difficult to play guard or tackle?\nNFL Video NFL Power Rankings Week 5: It may be Bengals' year as they jump into top 3 by Chris Burke", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/GregABedard"], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T04:34:35.111+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
