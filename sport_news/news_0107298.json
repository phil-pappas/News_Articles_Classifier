I remember talking to them in August and saying, it’s going to take a minute. But you gotta just stay with it. My leadership had pulled us through this last quarter of a season.” \nEast Coweta’s trio of senior standouts — Smith at setter and Ingram and Winters on the inside and outside hitter positions up front was joined by junior libero Riley Padgett in what was otherwise a lineup dotted with newcomers making their first contributions in the surroundings of the GHSA Sweet 16. \n“It means a lot,” said Ingram afterwards. “We knew right from the start, it was going to be a fight [Tuesday].” \nThe Lady Indians rallied in sets 1 and 3 against a 36-10 North Gwinnett lineup led by senior Taylor Spence and juniors Ogosha Ehigiator and Grace Rigsbee. \nThe Lady Indians trailed 23-19 in set one before rallying and then fought off five consecutive set points in set four with the Sweet 16 match poised to go the distance. \n“I was really starting to expect a Game 5,” McClure said. “We are doing right now what everybody said we wouldn’t.” \nAt times, all three seniors put the team on their shoulders as East Coweta rallied back from set point on six consecutive serves in game four. Winters put together seven of her 25 kills in the fourth set, pushing the Lady Indians out to an early lead. A 10-3 North Gwinnett surge put East Coweta down by as many as seven points, however, before eventually fighting off set point with a 5-0 run. \n“This year just brought our team together. We had a lot to overcome,” Winters said. “I feel like at the beginning of the season it was more of a focus to go out and prove ourselves. But as the season went on, it became more of a focus that we are our own team.” \nKills by Ingram completed a comeback that tied the set 24-24 and 25-25 before she eventually combined with Padgett on a bang-bang play from the middle of the net to silence North Gwinnett’s vocal crowd and send the Lady Bulldogs home unhappy. \nIngram finished with 18 kills and 5 blocks, helping negate some of Ehigator’s effectiveness from the middle. Smith, meanwhile, closed out the match with 47 assists, some from seemingly impossible angles on the floor to set up teammates while also coming up with several key digs — one of which helped pull East Coweta back to within a 16-14 deficit in game one after trailing by as many as five points earlier. \nPadgett led a staunch defensive effort with 19 digs while Winters and freshman Becca Sieckmann added 16 and 14 respectively. \nAlong with Sieckmann freshmen Isabel Moller and Nahla Muhammad along with sophomores Kirby Olive and Allie Edwards came through with key contributions. \nEdwards and Sieckmann each had two aces, each coming through with key serves in the game one comeback. Olive joined Ingram with a team-high five blocks, with the duo teaming for a block that pulled East Coweta to within a 24-22 deficit in game four. \nThe Lady Indians closed out the victory on consecutive serves by Moller, who also contributed digs and assists in the match.
