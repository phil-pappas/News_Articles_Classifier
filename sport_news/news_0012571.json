Comment Posted Oct. 17, 2015 at 2:00 AM Updated at 6:36 AM Posted Oct. 17, 2015 at 2:00 AM Updated at 6:36 AM » Social News HARWICH — Although the deadline to file nomination papers to run for state Senate is half a year away, the field of potential candidates to replace Sen. Daniel Wolf in 2016 is beginning to take shape. Wolf’s planned departure next year after three terms will leave the seat without an incumbent, opening up the field for both political parties. On the Democratic side, state Rep. Brian Mannal, Barnstable County Commission Chairwoman Sheila Lyons and Brewster Selectman Ben deRuyter are all mulling a run for the Cape & Islands District seat. Lyons lauded Wolf for his support on county issues and said she was saddened to hear of his pending departure but expressed interest in the job. “He’s leaving big shoes to fill,” she noted. “Right now I’m focused on being chair, but I will consider it down the road. If I run, I will run to win.” Lyons ran for Senate in 2010 but lost to Wolf in the primary. She said at the time that his campaign spending made the seat unattainable for citizens of modest or average income. Since that time, however, she said the senator has been very supportive of the district, fighting the opioid abuse problem, securing funding for the Cape via the state environmental bond bill and earmarking $150,000 in the state budget for a rehabilitative day center to replace the NOAH Shelter for the homeless in Hyannis. DeRuyter, chairman of the Brewster Board of Selectmen, also is considering a run for the seat, according to sources with knowledge of his plans. Last year, deRuyter campaigned to replace retiring state Rep. Cleon Turner but dropped out of the race before the primary. Mannal, now in his second term representing the 2nd Barnstable District in the House, said Thursday night he would consider a run for the Senate but also noted that Wolf would be a tough act to follow. “No one should enter into the Senate race lightly,” he said. The Republican field may include conservative Ronald Beaty, of West Barnstable. He lost to Wolf by a 25-point margin in the 2014 Senate race and is currently challenging Fran Manzelli for a spot on the Republican State Committee. He said he was carefully considering another run for state Senate. Beaty considers himself a community activist who knows how to shake things up. He is concerned that the Cape has an unfriendly stance toward business, leading to fewer opportunities for young people. Wolf, the founder of Cape Air, briefly ran for governor in 2014 before the State Ethics Commission found his connection to the airline posed a conflict of interest. Among his committee assignments he has been chairman of the Joint Committee on Labor and Workforce Development and the Senate Committee on Steering and Policy. He was known for his progressive stance on issues such as health care, gay marriage, gun control, energy and the environment. Although from the opposite end of the political spectrum, Sen. Viriato \"Vinny\" deMacedo, R-Plymouth, whose district includes sections of the Upper Cape, said Friday he and Wolf were able to come together on many issues, finding common ground. “He works hard for the community. We could put aside our views to work on issues that mattered.” — Follow Carrie Gentile on Twitter: @Cgentilecct.
