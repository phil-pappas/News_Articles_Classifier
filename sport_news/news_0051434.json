who shortly before had performed a try-saving tackle on Marcelo Bosch - floated a perfectly judged long-range pass to Ashley-Cooper who raced over in the right corner. \nArgentina trailed 14-3 after just 10 minutes and the bad news continued to pour in with a groggy Juan Imhoff being helped from the pitch with what appeared to be concussion. \nTwo penalties by Sanchez gave the Pumas hope, but this faded once more when lock Tomas Lavanini was sent to the sin-bin by Wayne Barnes for an illegal tackle on Folau, an act that resulted in jeers for the English referee from the pro-Argentina crowd. \nAustralia took the bold step of sending successive penalties into touch instead of going for goal and while the move did not immediately pay off, eventually the reward came. \nAfter repeatedly switching the point of attack, holes began to appear in the Pumas' defence and Matt Giteau intelligently capitalised on an overlap by flinging a long pass to Ashley-Cooper for the wing's second try. \nArgentina lost captain Agustin Creevy to injury, but there was an irrepressibility about their play and only desperate tackles prevented wing Santiago Cordero and centre Juan Martin Hernandez from scoring. \nFoley missed a penalty, Australia's scrum collapsed in front of the posts and Sanchez slotted the three points as the deficit was narrowed to 19-12 amid a nervy start to the second half. \nAn exchange of penalties by Foley and Sanchez kept the scoreboard ticking over in a hard-fought third quarter that almost saw Argentina unlocked when Foley gathered a clever kick from Kurtley Beale, but the fly-half's final pass fell short of Ashley-Cooper. \nNerves were starting to afflict Australia, Foley steering a drop-goal off-target before Folau kicked into his own player to concede accidental offside that allowed the Pumas to renew their attack. \nArgentina continued to be hamstrung by their error-count as they repeatedly coughed up possession and they were eventually caught on the counter with Mitchell blazing a trail into the 22 before supplying Ashley-Cooper with the final pass. \nAustralia had done enough to win and refused to allow their line to be breached as the Pumas pounded away in the final minutes.
