But what if you take it off a T-Bird? \nIt's hard to find a weakness in the Southern Utah defense. The T-Birds rank fourth in the FCS in scoring defense, giving up a mere 12.8 points per game. They are first in turnover margin, first in interceptions, and near the top in a number of other defensive categories. \nSo of course defensive coordinator Demario Warren opened up the weekly press conference with this gem: Outside the state of Utah, the T-Birds are giving up 55 points a contest. \nThere was a lot of laughter from Warren when the silliness of the stat was mentioned (SUU has played just one game outside of the state, and it was easily its worst performance of the season), but with SUU is on its way to California to play UC Davis on Saturday. there might just be something to it. \n“We haven’t won an away plane game in like two years,” defensive end James Cowser said. \nOr maybe not. \n“The last game we won flying by plane was at Montana State,” SUU head coach Ed Lamb said. “(Last year) was a rough year for us. We didn't pick up a lot of wins period. It’s just like (Warren's) stat here, digging up some reasons to be motivated. There’s no reason to cross reasons to be motivated off the motivation list.” \nSUU will be heavy favorites on Saturday. The Aggies are 1-6 and coming off a 56-27 loss to Northern Colorado. It’s the same situation the T-Birds faced last week against Sacramento State and they handled it well, winning 44-0. \nBut even with team learning how to play as favorites, there’s still nothing wrong in finding some things to add to that motivation list. \nFor example, Cowser hasn’t had much success against UC Davis -- even though he hasn't had the the longest history with the Aggies. \n“I’m winless against UC Davis in my career, never beat them,” Cowser said. \nReporter: “0-3?” \nCowser: “0-1.” \nBut that one game left a bad memory. \n\"They came into our home and smacked us,” Cowser said. “They ran it right down our throat and there was nothing we could do about it.” \nThat contest was back in 2013, and the circumstances leading up to that game, have a lot of similarities to the lead up of this season's matchup.. \nThe T-Birds were 4-1, with their only loss to Washington State, and the Aggies were 1-4. But UC Davis rolled out of Cedar City with a 21-3 victory. \n“It just goes to show the parity in this conference, so you just have to be ready for anyone,” Cowser said. \nThat parity has already showcased itself this season in the Big Sky, with results that have left many scratching their heads. Weber State beat Montana, Northern Arizona beat Montana State, and UC Davis beat NAU. It seems in this year’s Big Sky every team can beat just about everybody. \n“I just think of our team last year,” quarterback Ammon Olsen said. “I feel like we were very talented and a few plays and games didn't go our way, and we didn't have a good win/loss record. But the games we did win were games we weren’t expected to win against big teams. So that’s how I see teams we play that don’t have a great record, they’re really good teams and will bring everything that got.” \nIt’s something everyone knows, but sometimes it helps to throw in some extra motivation, no matter how contrived a certain stat may seem. \nFollow Ryan Miller on Twitter, @millerjryan. 1 CONNECT 6 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://www.thespectrum.com/story/sports/college/southern-utah/2015/10/21/suu-football-t-birds-interesting-motivation-list/74312846/ TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T07:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T12:09:09.249+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
