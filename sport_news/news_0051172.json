Norris told his story in an Instagram post published on Monday afternoon.\nAdChoices He learned of the diagnosis during his time in Triple-A, before being traded to the Tigers. Norris pitched for Blue Jays' affiliate in Buffalo from May until July. He finished the season with Detroit, missing several weeks due to an oblique injury but returning ahead of schedule to finish the year strong with the Tigers.\n\"Hearing this was alarming, yea,\" he wrote. \"Weird, yea, that too. I was given the option to shut my year down & get it removed immediately. However, seeing another doctor that determined I could wait until the end of the season reassured my gut feeling. Just Keep Playing. Baseball kept me sane.\"\nThe Tigers were aware of the cancer at the time of the trade, GM Al Avila says. From #Tigers GM Al Avila: Team WAS aware Daniel Norris had cancer at time of the trade, and he is expected to be ready for spring training.\n— Tony Paul (@TonyPaul1984) October 19, 2015 #Tigers Avila on Norris: \"We were very happy with how he pitched for us and expect for him to recover and compete for spot in the rotation.\"\n— Tony Paul (@TonyPaul1984) October 19, 2015 The full text posted at Instagram :\nI've been debating for months as to how or even if I should share this with people. - I'm a firm believer in the power of prayer. So now, I'm asking for prayers. - A few months ago, after I was optioned to AAA, I found out I had a growth on my thyroid. Flying back & forth from Toronto to Buffalo after pitching to have more and more tests done it was finally concluded that the growth is considered malignant.. Meaning it contained the C word.. cancer. Hearing this was alarming, yea. Weird, yea, that too. I was given the option to shut my year down & get it removed immediately. However, seeing another doctor that determined I could wait until the end of the season reassured my gut feeling. Just Keep Playing. Baseball kept me sane. Regardless of results on the field, I forgot about it when I was between the lines. Afterall, I was just trying to get the heck out of AAA. & I did. I was revived with an opportunity, a blessing from God, with the Tigers back in the Big Leagues. So yea, the power of prayer.. It got me through this season. Now that it's over it's time to get this thing out, so please keep me in your thoughts & prayers as I undergo surgery & come out 100% cancer free!
