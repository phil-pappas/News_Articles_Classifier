The phrase “Peyton Manning gets picked off” has become the NFL version of “gets past a diving Derek Jeter.”\nWe hear it a lot these days because it seems to happen an awful lot. No one likes to see a legend struggle in the twilight of his career, especially someone as classy as Manning. The same with Jeter … until he made it his life’s mission to singlehandedly put newspapers out of business. But that’s another story for another day.\nThe founder of The Players’ Tribune couldn’t help the Yankees win in his final season(s). Manning, however, keeps winning despite not being close to his former self. It really is remarkable.\nThe Broncos QB has thrown seven touchdown passes and 10 interceptions this season, including three on Sunday against the Browns. And yet, Denver is 6-0 following Sunday’s 26-23 overtime win in Cleveland. It is the seventh time in franchise history the Broncos have started a season 6-0. And in five of those seasons they reached the Super Bowl. Imagine that, Super Bowl 50 featuring a 39-year-old Peyton Manning, who throws like he’s 50.\nWinning is the true measure of greatness. It also helps when you have a championship-caliber defense and you get a tad lucky. Remember Week 2 vs. Kansas City?\nOn the Broncos’ first possession of overtime, Browns linebacker Barkevious Mingo intercepted Manning, and Cleveland took over at its 40-yard line needing a field goal to win. The Browns then lost 18 yards when Denver twice sacked Josh McCown.\nManning finished 26 for 48 with 290 yards and one TD, a 75-yard catch and run courtesy of Emmanuel Sanders. The Broncos went 25 possessions without a touchdown before Sanders’ score. Just think about how many bad quarterbacks are starting and it was Manning who hadn’t engineered a touchdown drive for 25 possessions. Denver still hasn’t scored a first-quarter touchdown this season.\n“We’re not playing as well as we would like,” Manning said, “but we’re playing well enough to win.”\nDenver doesn’t play again until a Nov. 1 home game against the Packers. They still have to face New England, Pittsburgh and Cincinnati. The schedule gets tougher. And Denver better hope Manning gets a lot better.\nFOLLOW THE DAILY NEWS SPORTS ON FACEBOOK. \"LIKE\" US HERE\nREX’S ROYAL TROUBLES\nWhen Rex Ryan arrives in London this week he should declare, “I will not kiss Sir Alex Ferguson’s rings.”\nNot sure what Great Britain did to deserve Buffalo-Jacksonville this week but a change of scenery couldn’t hurt the Bills, who have lost three straight home games after falling, 34-21, to the Bengals.\n“You take away this guy, you take away that guy,” Ryan said. “Well, this other dude beats you.”\nIt’s not every day when you hear Rex admit that his baby, his defense, didn’t have any answers. Who knew Andy Dalton could do that?\nCincinnati gets the week off before heading to Pittsburgh for a key divisional game on Nov. 1. The Bengals were also 6-0 in 1975 and 1988.\nPOOR HARBAUGHS\nMichigan State’s epic last-second miracle win at Michigan isn’t the first time Jim Harbaugh’s team was betrayed by its special teams.\nIn the NFC Championship Game in January 2012, the 49ers’ Kyle Williams fumbled a punt that set up Lawrence Tynes’ 31-yard field goal in overtime in the Giants’ 20-17 win. On Saturday, Michigan punter Blake O’Neill looked like Garo Yepremian when he dropped a snap in the final seconds that Michigan State picked up and ran into the end zone for the winning TD as time expired.\nIt was a wild finish with an ugly aftermath. Some Michigan fans, who clearly need a reality check, took to social media to say despicable things to O’Neill. Michigan athletic director Jim Hackett released a statement urging a “small minority” of losers to cease and desist.\nBad weekend for the Harbaughs all around. Brother John and the Baltimore Ravens fell to 1-5 with a loss at San Francisco.\nCLUELESS IN SEATTLE\nA third straight trip to the Super Bowl may not be in the cards for Seattle, which lost at home to Cam Newton and unbeaten Carolina and is now 2-4.\nThe Jets’ Todd Bowles and the Red Bulls’ Jesse Marsch are in a dead heat for best football coach in New York.\nDid you see Alex Rodriguez toss a football on Fox’s pregame show? He throws like a designated hitter.", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/NYDNSports"], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T07:58:20.056+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
