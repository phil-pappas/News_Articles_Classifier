Sadly, they will have become involved in what the Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency refers to as incidents, not accidents.\n\"The reason we use the term incident is that when people hear the word accident, they immediately think of something that could not have been avoided,\" said Major Brian Thompson, law information supervisor for the TWRA's Region 1 office based out of Jackson. \"They are for the most part results of some type of negligence or something the hunter did or didn't do. Therefore, they could have been avoided.\"\nNo one knows this better than Master Senior Sgt. James \"J.D.\" Crawford of Mayflower, Arkansas, an occupational safety manager for the 189th Airlift Wing of the Arkansas Air National Guard, who is also an Arkansas hunter education instructor and a master bowhunter education instructor.\nOn Oct. 7, 2012, at 5:30 a.m. Crawford, 44, found himself dangling from a tree 30 feet off the ground.\n\"While climbing up or down a tree, and the entire time I'm in the stand, I use a climbing rope with a Prusik knot to keep me secured to the tree and prevent me from becoming a statistic on some spreadsheet,\" Crawford says.\nAfter making the climb and securing his stand in place, he pulled his bow up by the haul line and placed it on a hanger he'd left from a previous hunt.\n\"The next thing I know I'm hanging by my safety harness after dropping about 2 feet,\" he says. \"Remember, it's 5:30 in the morning and still dark, my headlamp and hat have fallen to the ground and I'm hanging in a tree 30 feet off the ground.\"\nAfter the initial shock that something had gone terribly wrong and realizing that he was not hurt (other than his pride) or lying at the bottom of the tree with broken legs or worse, Crawford says he began to laugh. He didn't panic. He evaluated his situation and decided that the best way for him to get down was to just slide down the tree, which is what he did.\n\"Now, I'm safely back on solid ground, unhurt and thankful that I'd practiced what I've taught in so many hunter and bowhunter education courses,\" Crawford says. \"I never thought having a tree-stand accident could happen to me, but it did and I'm thankful that I was prepared.\"\nAre you prepared?\nIf it can happen to someone like Crawford, it can happen to the rest of us.\nBelieve me, it is going to happen to someone in 2015-16 whether he or she is using a bow, muzzleloader or rifle ... or maybe just watching deer or other critters in the field from a stand.\nA team of medical researchers in Pennsylvania several years ago did a study on tree-stand falls. During the 14-year study, 280 hunters received treatment for falls. Six resulted in fatalities; the highest rate of falls came in the 50-59 age group and the median height for the falls was 18 feet.\nIn another national study, it was determined that 75-80 percent of all tree-stand incidents happen while climbing up or down. Most of the hunters injured were not wearing a safety harness or vest. Common injuries from falls included broken bones, spinal cord injuries and brain damage.\nFive hunters have been killed in tree-stand-related incidents in Tennessee since 2010, ages 59, 62, 22, 42 and 68. Only one had taken a hunter-education course. None was wearing a safety harness. One fell 38 feet.\nIn that same time frame, there have been 43 non-fatal tree-stand incidents in Tennessee, resulting in an assortment of injuries, including broken backs, legs and arms, some resulting in full disability. Tree-stand incidents are the leading cause of injury to hunters. One in three people who hunt from an elevated stand will have a fall resulting in serious injury, according to a study by Deer and Deer Hunting magazine.\n\"We experienced one incident involving a tripod or tower stand,\" said Randy Hussey, statewide law enforcement training and hunter education administrator for the TWRA. \"Many of the incidents involved climbing stands occur when the lower platform falls down the tree. Leaving a stand out all season long causes many problems with metal corrosion and rotting of straps.\"\nJoe Huggins, hunter education coordinator for the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission, agrees. He also emphasizes the importance of wearing a full-body harness when hunting from an elevated stand and to be sure you are connected from the point you leave the ground to the point you set foot back on the ground.\n\"Although there are many reasons for fails from tree stands such as the recoil of the firearm knocking the victim off balance and causing a fall, equipment failure (broken straps, broken welds, etc.) to people falling asleep and falling out, most falls occur while climbing in and out of the stand.\"\nHussey says the AGFC has received two reports of falls from tree stands since July 1, including one that is still under investigation. From July 1, 2010, through June 30, 2015, Arkansas reported 55 falls from tree stands with seven fatalities.\nNotice the word \"reported.\"\nNot all incidents are reported. Not everyone who falls seeks medical attention. Not all all tree-stand incidents are recorded as a category by themselves in hospitals. Recording varies from state to state. There is no national data.\nAll of which brings us back to Crawford.\n\"He (Crawford) did all the right things by wearing a harness and being connected to the tree,\" Huggins says. \"It is a story that could have been tragic but was positive. He was able go back hunting that afternoon.\"\nIn closing, Huggins says, \"Make these memories in the woods positive by always coming home safe.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T01:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T16:27:15.688+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
