Utah scored on the next play. pic.twitter.com/5WPJafwWB1\n— Dr. Saturday (@YahooDrSaturday) October 25, 2015\nTwitter went nuts, and the Utes scored on the next play to take a 14-7 lead.\nA four foot tall soccer midfielder from Utah is clowning USC on a punt return right now, Trojans have to close their football program now\n— SPENCER HALL (@edsbs) October 25, 2015\nBritain Covey out there being a man and whatnot.\n— Ashley Adamson (@AdamsonAshley) October 25, 2015\n#MightyMouse showing some moves! Oh wow!!\n— N8 the Spoon (@utefan99) October 25, 2015\nIt's too bad Covey isn't a D-1 player.\n— Brad Pierce (@UTAHSportsBar) October 25, 2015\nI am going to delay every flight that tries and take Covey to his mission after the season.\n— benji (@BiH_Benjo) October 25, 2015\nSECOND QUARTER\nIf the wheels on the bus had been going round and round, they started to fall off for Utah about four minutes into the frame as Wilson threw the first of four interceptions (three of which went to freshman linebacker Cameron Smith) on the night, and USC scored less than a minute later to tie things up at 14.\nLike with the Trojans’ first score of the game, folks didn’t get too riled up about Wilson’s mishap. Seven minutes later, however, USC led 21-14, and Wilson threw another pass to Smith, which he took 54 yards to the end zone to make it 28-14.\nCameron Smith is going to boot Utah out of the playoff at this rate. Wow.\n— Pat Forde (@YahooForde) October 25, 2015\nMaybe Travis Wilson has a medical condition where he can't see people named Cameron\n— SPENCER HALL (@edsbs) October 25, 2015\nOn the Utes’ next possession just before halftime, Wilson took a sack that pushed his team to the edge of field goal range. Twitter responded.\nTravis Wilson is NOT having a good half. Good gravy.\n— Pat Forde (@YahooForde) October 25, 2015\nWe need to sell our soul for a quarterback\n— Michael Bodell (@mikebodell1978) October 25, 2015", "external_links": ["http://deseretnews.sportsdirectinc.com/football/ncaaf-teams.aspx?page=/data/ncaaf/teams/team33.html", "https://twitter.com/ArmstrongABC11/status/658070653711568896", "http://deseretnews.sportsdirectinc.com/football/ncaaf-teams.aspx?page=/data/ncaaf/teams/team93.html", "https://twitter.com/BiH_Benjo/status/658072612803772416", "https://t.co/5WPJafwWB1", "https://twitter.com/AdamsonAshley/status/658072256350810112", "https://twitter.com/YahooDrSaturday/status/658073581046206465", "https://twitter.com/YahooForde/status/658085970294738944", "https://twitter.com/utefan99/status/658072374445666304", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/MightyMouse?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/edsbs/status/658072460042985472", "https://twitter.com/UTAHSportsBar/status/658072587142983681", "https://twitter.com/mikebodell1978/status/658088108009787392", "https://twitter.com/YahooForde/status/658087806196150272", "http://deseretnews.sportsdirectinc.com/football/ncaaf-teams.aspx?page=/data/ncaaf/teams/team71.html", "https://twitter.com/edsbs/status/658086155691380736"], "published": "2015-10-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T21:17:33.307+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
