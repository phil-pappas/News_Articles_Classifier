Again. \n\"Same answer,\" Murray told members of the media at Canadian Tire Centre Tuesday. \"I got a text from Mikael yesterday afternoon. I haven't answered him yet, I will today. He would like to stay home. He can stay home but he can't play hockey, and he wants to play over there. \n\"We have to take a stand here at this time. If it changes later on, it changes later on. But that's not the message I'm sending to him.\" \nDespite knowing the Senators' preference -- and despite saying he would be fine with playing in Binghamton -- Wikstrand bolted from Ottawa just before main camp started without informing the team of his intentions until he was at the airport. \nAt the time, Murray said Wikstrand can \"be a grocery clerk and play beer league hockey,\" but he just couldn't play hockey for money with any other team. \nWikstrand countered by stating he didn't want to leave home because a family member was seriously ill. \n\"Supposedly his brother is sick, and he'd like to be closer to home,\" Murray said Tuesday. \"But I think the team he hopes to play for would be three hours away, and we're about eight hours away on an airplane, so I don't think there's that big a difference. \n\"But I do understand, if there's an illness. I understand that part of it. The point being he made a commitment to play here, we signed him to a contract and paid him accordingly, to our obligations, and we're asking him to honour that contract at this point in time.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T23:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T00:28:23.619+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
