Caption (Troy Hyde/Daily News) Collins-Maxwell/Baxter senior Brady Stover had seven catches for 61 yards during the Raiders’ 24-7 loss to North Polk in Alleman on Friday. CMB needs to win Friday at Centerville to qualify for the Class 2A playoffs as the fourth seed out of District 7. By Troy Hyde Newton Daily News \nALLEMAN — As many breaks and good fortunes that came with Collins-Maxwell/Baxter’s 9-0 regular season last year, the Raider football team is almost on the complete opposite end of the spectrum in 2015. \nCMB has battled through suspensions and several injuries, and another potential season-ending injury got the Raiders off on the wrong foot Friday night. It proved costly during a 24-7 loss to North Polk in Class 2A District 7 play. \nCoach Rob Luther’s plan was to give leading rusher Blake Coughenour a heavy dose of action against the Comets’ stingy defense, but a knee injury just three plays into the game ended the junior’s night and may have ended his season. \nCoughenour gained 18 yards on his first carry and then rumbled for 23 yards on his second attempt. Unfortunately, Coughenour injured his knee on a cut back and did not return. \n“I was right there, and he cut on the turf and wasn’t being hit,” Luther said. “It didn’t look good. I have seen enough of them that I just know it didn’t look good.” \nLuther said Sunday that Coughenour was getting an MRI on Monday. Hunter McWhirter and Toren Shultheis also left Friday’s game with concussions in the first half. It was McWhirter’s second concussion in three weeks, which means he will have to go through the five-day protocol and could be sidelined Friday when the Raiders travel to Centerville for the regular season finale. \n“I feel bad for this football team in that as great as the gods shined on us last year in a 9-0 season, catching every break possible, we have paid it right back this year,” Luther said. “We just can’t catch a break.” \nAside from the injuries, CMB also turned the ball over five times against the Comets. North Polk’s Max Karpinske had three interceptions and returned two for scores. \nIt was Karpinske’s first pick six that shifted the momentum to the home team for good. \nCMB went 55 yards in four plays on its opening drive and an 11-yard touchdown run by Nate Bishop gave the Raiders’ a 7-0 lead rather quickly. \nThe Raiders forced North Polk to turn it over on downs on the Comets’ first possession and then put together a long drive that could have given them a big advantage. \nOn the 17th play of the drive, Karpinske picked off a Brady Stover wide receiver pass at the 5-yard line and sprinted 95 yards down the home sideline to tie the game. \n“The play was wide open, but it got tipped,” Luther said. “I thought that play changed the game. We just never recovered from it.” \nCMB punted on its next two possessions, and Grant Rampton picked off Bishop on the final play of the first half to keep the game even at the break. \nHunter Gunderson intercepted Karpinske on the Comets’ first drive of the second half, but the Raiders gave it right back on a fumble. \nThat gave North Polk a short field and a 30-yard pass play from Karpinske to Rampton set up the Comets for a 27-yard field goal by Carter Hartwig. \nThe Comets converted the kick with 3:33 to play in the third and never trailed again. \nKarpinske hit Matt Cox for a 45-yard touchdown pass on the first play of the Comets’ next possession, and Karpinske returned his second interception 60 yards for another score that made it 24-7 early in the fourth quarter. \nThe Raiders turned it over twice on downs in the final period. Karpinske ended CMB’s only other drive with his third interception. \n“You won’t beat anybody turning it over five times,” Luther said. “We hung in there, but we needed to make some plays early in the second half and just didn’t do that.” \nThe Comets improved to 5-3 overall and 4-1 in district play. North Polk can claim a first-round home playoff game and the district’s No. 2 seed if it can win at PCM Friday. \nCMB dropped to 5-3 overall and 2-3 in league play. The Raiders need to win at Centerville to earn a playoff spot as the district’s No. 4 seed. \n“We still have some football left,” Luther said. “We have to go down to Centerville and make sure we get that win so we can get into the playoffs and then come up with a plan from there.” \nThe Raiders finished with 321 total yards and out-gained North Polk offensively, but the turnovers proved to be too costly. \nBishop was 24-of-36 for 184 yards and three interceptions. He did rush 11 times for 32 yards and scored CMB’s only touchdown. \nStover had seven catches for 61 yards, Gunderson had four catches for 58 yards and Brady Kemp hauled in eight catches for 55 yards in the loss. \nCoughenour returned to action after missing three straight games. He gained 41 yards on his only two carries of the game. \n“We still had enough players to win, but it changed our mentality when (Coughenour) went down,” Luther said. “Our plan was to give (North Polk) a huge dose of (Coughenour). \nTwo bright spots for CMB’s adversity-filled month has been Gunderson and Charles Robertson. \nThe two seniors led the defense against North Polk and both will be key components to Friday’s road game against Centerville. Luther said Robertson will likely get more carries at running back. \nI am more proud of that kid than I have ever been of almost anyone else in my 25 years of coaching,” Luther said of Gunderson. “His effort, his heart, his coach-ability, you just have to love a kid like Hunter Gunderson. He’s making plays all over the place. \n“(Robertson) had a great night on defense, and we’ll probably get him in the backfield again next week and see if we can run him downfield a little bit.” \nThe other three playoff spots out of 2A District 7 have been decided. Albia clinched the top seed with its win over Prairie City-Monroe on Friday. PCM and North Polk will play for the No. 2 seed in Monroe this week. \nCollins-Maxwell/Baxter 7-0-0-0—7 \nCMB — Bishop 11-yd run (Caple kick) \nNP — Karpinske 95-yd interception return (Hartwig kick) \nNP — Hartwig 27-yd field goal \nNP — Cox 45-yd pass from Karpinske (Hartwig kick) \nNP — Karpinske 60-yd interception return (Hartwig kick)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T19:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T21:15:17.476+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
