Picture: Quinn Rooney/Getty \nSCOTT Selwood’s move to Geelong as a free agent has been completed after the West Coast Eagles did not match the Cats contract offer. \nSelwood was a restricted free agent, meaning the Eagles had the right to match Geelong’s offer that was lodged with the AFL on Friday. \n“Scott has shown over his time with the Eagles that he is capable of playing a number of roles and that will give us additional flexibility in how we set up,” Geelong coach Chris Scott said. \n“He is a person of high quality and will also bring exceptional leadership to our club.” Scott Selwood Selwood will bolster the Cats midfield depth after spending eight seasons as a key component of the Eagles line-up. \nSelwood paid tribute to the Eagles and is looking forward to returning to Victoria. \n“The West Coast Eagles have been a great football club to have been a part of over the last eight years, they gave me my first opportunity and I’ll always be grateful,” Selwood said.

He won the club’s best and fairest in 2012 was acting co-captain in 2014 and vice captain in 2015 and played in six finals. \nMeanwhile, Patridt Dangerfield will play for Geelong next season after Adelaide agreed to a trade for the star onballer on Monday. \nOn the opening day of the AFL trade period, the Crows sent Dangerfield to the Cats in exchange for picks No.9 and No.28 at this year’s draft, along with untried South Australian midfielder Dean Gore. \nAdelaide also sent their third-round pick (No.50) to Geelong as part of the deal. \n“All along we were intent on doing what was in the best interests of our club, and we have been able to deliver the best possible outcome,” Adelaide list manager David Noble said via a club statement. \n“Securing picks 9 and 28 allows us to add some more quality talent to our playing list, while Dean is a young man who has the makings of a long-term player. \n“I would also like to acknowledge Geelong for the professional manner in which these negotiations where handled.” Dangerfield, 25, was a restricted free agent but the trade agreed to by the clubs means that he didn’t need to exercise his rights under the free agency system in order to get his wish to move back to his home state. \nIf he had departed under that system the Crows would have received pick 14 at the draft in compensation from the AFL. \nGore, 19, was selected by the Cats with pick 55 at last year’s national draft but didn’t play an AFL game in 2015. “Our recruiting team rated Dean highly in the lead up to last year’s draft and he was on the verge of playing AFL football in his debut year,” Noble said. \nAdelaide currently holds selections 9, 13, 28, 32 and 68 in next month’s national draft.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T07:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T10:00:56.646+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
