Resiliency. \nThe Chillicothe Cavaliers used those three ingredients to fight back from a 2-1 match deficit and end Waverly's season in a Division II Sectional Semifinal Wednesday night in five sets; 25-17, 23-25, 22-25, 25-19 and 15-13. \nThe victory secured a spot for Chillicothe (16-7) in a sectional final and avenged an earlier season loss to the Tigers â€” also in five sets. \n\"First of all, I love these kids. They showed a lot of heart today,\" Chillicothe coach Greg Tracey said. \"They came into an environment where we thought we should've had a home game. We had a girl go down with an injury last night in practice. We went down 2-1 in someone else's gym. They didn't let any of those things defeat them. I can't say enough about their heart today.\" \nAt the \"heart\" of the effort was junior Olivia Eblin, who time and time again found ways to keep the Tigers' defense off balance. \n\"We've talked about getting Olivia to play to her potential and she's done that for the most part all year,\" Tracey said. \"But I think she's going to realize just how good she is after tonight. She was very important and you know what, everybody that got her the ball was just as important. If we don't pass it and set it, she doesn't have the opportunities that she had.\" \nIn the first set, Chillicothe took an early lead on the heels of Eblin and built the edge to 16-10. However, trouble at the serving line allowed Waverly (16-7) to creep back into contention cutting the deficit to 18-14. \nWith momentum on the Tigers' side, senior middle hitter Malia Berry had seen enough and sparked a 5-2 run, helping the Cavs take the first set 25-17. \nAs good as Chillicothe was in the first set, they were equally as bad early in the second. \nWaverly went on a 9-3 run to start and saw its lead grow to counts of 12-7 and 15-8 before the Cavaliers finally rediscovered a rhythm. Thanks to a hot serving streak from senior libero Ashley Coats, Chillicothe put together a 6-0 run midway through to crawl back within a point, 15-14. Realizing their miscues, the Tigers then kicked things back into gear, taking a 22-18 lead en route to a 25-23 win, tying the match 1-1. \nThe back-and-forth affair continued in the third as spectators witnessed 14 ties and seven lead changes before it was all said and done. The Cavaliers led 20-18 late but Waverly mounted a 4-0 run and used the momentum that came with it to win the set, 25-22. \nWith their season on life support, the Cavaliers counter-attacked with a hot start in the fourth, taking a 6-3 lead. But per the trend, Waverly fought back to tie the game, 10-10. While holding a 19-18 lead, senior Tamia Mills rose above the net and powered the Cavaliers to a 6-1 run, securing a 25-19 victory and forcing a fifth and deciding set. \n\"We haven't advanced in the tournament or beat Waverly in a really long time,\" Mills said. \"I wanted to come out and give it my all in case this was my last time on the court as a senior. It seems like going to five in big games is our trend. We did that at Washington Court House, as well. But our parents cheering for us in the stands and the thought that it could be our last game really helped.\" \nMills continued her strong play in the fifth, finding open spots on the floor and pounding balls onto the defense with authority. \nHer efforts, combined with Eblin's strong play, gave Chillicothe leads of 4-3, 8-7, 11-10 and 13-12 on the way to a match clinching 15-13 victory. \n\"I just really wanted to win this game,\" Eblin said. \"I knew that if we played with heart and if we played like we did with Washington Court House, we'd kill it, and we did. On the fifth set of every game, our parents would stand up and cheer for us. That just reminds us that if we don't play for anything else, we need to play for them because they come to every game and support us.\" \nEblin led the way with 28 kills, 16 digs and four blocks while Mills finished with 17 kills and five blocks. Gabby Lapurga had 25 assists while Courtney Barnes dished out 20 and Malia Berry added 13 kills and four blocks. \nChillicothe will now travel to top-seeded Gallia Academy Saturday at 4 p.m. for a chance to win a sectional title. \ndwebb@chillicothegazette.com 32 CONNECT 5 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://ohne.ws/1LNb6kH TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T06:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T17:04:04.865+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
