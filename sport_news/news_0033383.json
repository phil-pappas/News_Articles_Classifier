His putter tumbled out of his hand and over his back. He stood on the 18th green with his hands clasped together, the tips of his fingers covering his mouth. \n\"I would like to rewind and just change the last 10 seconds of it,\" Lahiri said. \nIt wasn't all on Lahiri, the 28-year-old who made history in these matches as the first player from India. The Presidents Cup would have then ended in a tie the way it played out with Bill Haas winning the final match for a 15½-14½ victory for the United States. \nAt that moment, rarely has such a competition seen such a swift turnaround. \nThe Presidents Cup was tied, and with the status of other matches on the course, a point from Lahiri looked as though it would be the winner for the International team. Lahiri was all square with Chris Kirk, both players short of the green on the par-5 18th and facing tough chips. \nLahiri played his to near perfection, up the slope and rolling to 4 feet away. Kirk had a steeper slope and, wanting to at least make sure he had a putt, he chipped in 15 feet long and faced a tough downhill putt that broke two directions. \nKirk's putt dropped on the final turn. Lahiri quickly settled over his putt ... and missed.

It's going to be hard for me to sleep tonight. I'm sure the rest of the team is going to help me out with that with the evening's festivities.\" \nLahiri finished fifth in the PGA Championship and narrowly missed earning enough money for a PGA Tour card. But he did well enough in the Web.com Tour Finals to earn a U.S. card, and he plans to play a full schedule in America. \nAnd he would like nothing more than to be on the next International team in 2017 at Liberty National. Champions Tour: Tom Lehman had an eagle and three birdies in the final four holes to win the Champions Tour's SAS Championship in Cary, North Carolina. The 56-year-old Lehman birdied the par-4 15th and 16th, eagled the par-5 17th and birdied the par-4 18th for a 7-under 65 and a one-stroke victory over Joe Durant. \nBritish Masters: Matthew Fitzpatrick signaled his emergence as one of Europe's most prominent young golfers, shooting a 3-under 68 to complete a wire-to-wire victory in the British Masters at Woburn for his first professional title. The 21-year-old Englishman shot five birdies in his final round to win by two strokes and finish on a 15-under total of 269. \nLPGA: Jessica Korda won the LPGA Malaysia for her fourth tour title, closing with a 6-under 65 in sweltering conditions at Kuala Lumpur Golf and Country Club for a four-stroke victory. She made five birdies in a seven-hole stretch that ended on the 10th, dropped a stroke on the par-4 11th and sealed it with birdies on the par-3 15th and 17th. Second-ranked Lydia Ko, No. 3 Stacy Lewis and 2014 winner Shanshan Feng tied for second. \nSymetra Tour: Jackie Stoelting won the IOA Golf Classic in Longwood, Florida, for her second straight Symetra Tour title, shooting her third 4-under 67 for a two-stroke victory. ---", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T05:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T05:12:19.080+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
