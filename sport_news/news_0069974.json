Jordan and the Eagles will try to get a Region 3 victory tonight when they travel to Campbell. Game: South Cobb (2-5, 1-3) at Campbell (2-5, 0-4), 7:30 p.m.Last year: South Cobb 62, Campbell 39All-time series: Campbell leads 13-11Prediction: South Cobb 28, Campbell 21Campbell hosts South Cobb tonight at McDaniel Stadium in a matchup between Region 3 rivals who are hoping to gain some winning momentum as the season starts to wind down.The Eagles have dropped two in a row and four of their last five, while the Spartans are out to turn around a five-game losing skid.Neither squad is in the position they thought they’d be prior to the start of the 2015 campaign, but they also haven’t given up.“We have struggled this year since starting 2-0,” Campbell coach Ryan Brady said. “We had great expectations going into this season, but our players have been resilient through it all, and they continue to practice and play hard every day.”Perhaps having homecoming festivities as part of tonight’s battle against South Cobb will help jump-start Campbell’s offense, which hasn’t scored more than 14 points in any of its last four games.“We just have to continue to do what we do and limit mistakes,” Brady said. “We have to move more guys off the line of scrimmage and get our running game going. We’ve been down to our freshman quarterback the last couple of games, but we should have (starting quarterback) Jawan (Nobles) healthy again and other guys coming back from injury. Hopefully, that will help kick-start our offense, not just physically, but mentally as well.”Campbell leads the all-time series 13-11, but South Cobb has been gaining ground fast. The Eagles have won five straight and six of the last seven meetings in the rivalry, which dates back to 1989. Campbell will need to match South Cobb’s athleticism and execute well in all phases to give itself the best chance at snapping its losing streak.“South Cobb throws the ball well and they have some scary kids that can take it to the house if they get in open space,” Brady said. “We have to stay on the game plan, establish the run and try to make plays in our passing game.”— By Carlton D. WhiteGame: Newnan (5-2, 3-1) at Pebblebrook (3-4, 1-3), 7:30 p.m.Last year: Newnan 35, Pebblebrook 6All-time series: Newnan leads 3-0Prediction: Newnan 30, Pebblebrook 12Pebblebrook is having a rebuilding year. The 2015 season is all about making strides, which they’ve done. The Falcons have cut down on turnovers, and they’re also scoring more points than last season. Defensively, they’re yielding 10 fewer points than last season.Even more important, Pebblebrook has already won more games than last season. But the Falcons still aren’t at the level of some of their Region 3 competition, hence the 1-3 record, but it plans to change that in the next couple of seasons. Meanwhile, Pebblebrook plans on giving everything it has when Newnan comes to visit. And Newnan is still in the mix to win or finish in the top four of the region.“They’ve got a great team, a great quarterback and a great running back,” Pebblebrook coach Kevin Saunders said. “Their defensive line is physical and their defense flies around. I think it’s great that we have a chance to compete with these guys. That’s what makes football fun.”Saunders has praised the effort his team has given through the first seven games, but Pebblebrook’s main deficiency will likely not be addressed until the offseason. The Falcons’ region losses, including their 34-7 setback last week against East Coweta, has a lot to do with the lack of size. “We never play as bad as you think or as good as you think, all of that deals in building a program,” Saunders said. “Our deficiencies were shown Friday (against East Coweta). These kids need to be in the weight room. That’s an issue we’re going to solve between now and next year, and we will. We physically got manhandled.” The Falcons will continue to establish their ground game. Trey Wright leads Pebblebrook with 433 yards rushing. Tyreek King-El has 352 yards and Gianni Montgomery has rushed for 330. — By Adam Carrington", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T06:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T08:53:07.203+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
