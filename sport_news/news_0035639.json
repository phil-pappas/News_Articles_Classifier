The organizers explained that Gong did not appear anywhere in the official video that only recorded the first three runners during the race. Gong took to the Internet to contest his innocence and the organizers were forced to review his result until Friday when they decided Gong did not cheat.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T19:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T22:11:01.175+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
