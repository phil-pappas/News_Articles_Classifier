(AP) - Civil-rights leader Myrlie Evers-Williams, Mississippi-born rapper David Banner and a prominent South Carolina lawmaker are calling on Mississippi to remove the Confederate battle emblem from its state flag.\nAbout 400 people took part in a change-the-flag rally Sunday outside the Mississippi Capitol. No alternative design was proposed, but rally leaders said the flag used since 1894 is racially divisive.\nRepublican state Rep. Jenny Horne of South Carolina says Mississippi is hurting its own economy with the flag. Horne gave an impassioned speech in July as South Carolina lawmakers voted to remove a Confederate battle flag from the Statehouse grounds, weeks after nine black worshippers were massacred in a Charleston church.\nThe suspect, in what police called a racially motivated shooting, had previously posed for photos with the rebel flag.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
