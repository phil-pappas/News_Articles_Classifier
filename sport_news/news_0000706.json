After losing to that older squad earlier, the South Florida hoopsters (3-1) avenged that setback in the title showdown.\nHead Coach Lorenzo Williams is the former starting center of the Dallas Mavericks. The 46-year-old Sunrise resident has been coaching and conducting clinics for young players for the last seven years.\n\"My interest is in developing kids â€¦ and to giving them a foundation to build on,\" Williams said. \"It was a great opportunity and experience for our kids to test their skills against kids from the Bahamas, and we played some very competitive games. Our players also had a chance to see some of the challenges the kids face in the Bahamas.\"\nWhile in the Bahamas, Williams conducted a free three-hour basketball clinic for boys and girls. He also emphasized the importance of education and how the sport brings many cultures together.\n\"Education is something nobody can take away from you,\" Williams said. \"I left college early to play [pro] basketball, but the first thing I did after I retired was to finish my studies and get my degree.\"\nThe Let It Fly organization includes teams from grades 4-7 and is a year-round program.\nHave an idea for a sports digest story?
