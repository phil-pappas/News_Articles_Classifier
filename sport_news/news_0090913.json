Perhaps it was because the statue of Harry Carey was temporarily removed from Wrigley Field grounds because of the remodeling. \nPitching was certainly a key for the Mets, and likely will be in the World Series. Pitching in baseball brings to the field what defense does in football. Teams that score a lot of points are good enough on defense to control the tempo of the game. \nNonetheless, it time for me to make my Week 10 picks and hopefully I fared better than the Cubbies. \nMt. Pleasant vs. Summertown \nThe Tigers have the speed advantage on the Eagles, who will be wrapping up their first varsity season tonight in Lawrenceburg. \nMt. Pleasant over Summertown \nSonny Moore’s pick: Mt. Pleasant by 26. \nZion Christian at Mt. Juliet Christian \nThe Eagles will fly into Mt. Juliet with a productive offense. Defense, however, is a key. \nMt. Juliet Christian over Zion Christian \nSonny Moore’s pick: Mt. Juliet Christian by 16. \nLipscomb Academy at Spring Hill \nBoth the Mustangs and the Raiders have played a challenging schedule, and their records are reversed, but don’t be surprised at the score when the final horn sounds. \nSpring Hill over Lipscomb Academy \nSonny Moore’s pick: Lipscomb by 10. \nStewart’s Creek at Summit \nEvery other week it seems that the Spartans pull a stunning upset. Can Summit make it three in a row? \nStewarts Creek over Summit \nSonny Moore’s pick : Stewarts Creek by 13. \nShelbyville at Columbia Central \nThe Eagles have to win, or they will be eliminated from playoff contention. It’s the final home game for the Lions seniors, it’s “Pink Out” and a TV game … and the ‘59 Lions who won their first game played on this field would like to see the 2015 Lions prevail. \nShelbyville over Columbia Central \nSonny Moore’s pick : Shelbyville by 11. \nColumbia Academy at Whitwell \nThe Bulldogs travel over Monteagle to meet the Tigers, who will likely fill a No. 2 spot behind South Pittsburgh in the playoff bracket opposite an area team from our Region 4. CA will have to adjust to a different environment, but it will help for a road playoff game. \nColumbia Academy over Whitwell \nSonny Moore’s pick : CA by 22 points. \nOther games: Independence over Franklin County; Lincoln County over LaVergne; Lawrence County over Lewis County; Giles County over Signal Mountain; Page over White House; Marshall County over Maplewood; Pearl-Cohn over Tullahoma; Hillwood over Hickman County; Sycamore over Stewart County; Fayetteville over Cornesville; Moore County over Richland; Huntland over Grace Christian; Forrest over Eagleville; Westmoreland over Cascade; Watertown over Community; Jackson County over East Robertson; Harpeth over Cheatham County; Wayne County over Huntingdon; Colliwood over McEwen; Hollow Rock-Bruceton over Houston County; Clarksville Academy over Perry County; Decatur Riverside over McKenzie. \nLast Week: 13-4, 80.9 percent \nFor the Year: 135-38, 78.3 percent  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T07:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T08:43:47.295+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
