Lakeside trims Lake Mills, closes in on Capitol title Mike Klawitter | Leader sports editor Daily Jefferson County Union \nLAKE MILLS — With a Capitol Conference championship on the line, the Lakeside Lutheran High School boys’ soccer team’s senior leadership did what it had to do Tuesday night against crosstown rival Lake Mills. \nStephen Phelps scored in the first three minutes and Nathan Lemke added a goal midway through the first half as the Warriors remained unbeaten in conference with a 2-1 win. \nLakeside Lutheran (10-1-2 overall) finished with an 8-0-1 record in the Capitol and holds a half-game lead over Sugar River (7-0-1), which beat Wisconsin Height 6-2 Tuesday. Sugar River plays its final league game at Columbus Thursday. \nPhelps’ goal came on a lengthy shot that got past L-Cats senior keeper Andy Mitchell in the 15th minute. \n“We’ve had Stephen play defense, but he has been playing offense for the last three years,” Warriors’ head coach Pastor Clark Schultz said. “He’s always creeped up in the space we had and drilled a laser in there.” \nLemke’s goal, in the 25th minute, was also from long distance and gave the Warriors a two-goal lead. Schultz said it was nice to see other players participate in the offense when opposing teams focus their defense on senior forward Joe Graumann, the conference’s leading goal scorer. \n“When everyone is ‘Joey focused,’ everybody else on the team has to step up,” he said. “That is the sign of a team win.” \nLakeside had other chances to score with Graumann coming close on some headers off corner kicks and crossover passes. Lake Mills gained some momentum late in the first half as senior Adam Smith deflected a shot past junior keeper Josh Higgins to cut Lakeside’s lead to 2-1 late in the first half. \nBut in the second half, the Warriors were able to fight off the L-Cats’ offensive attack led by sophomore Michael Wilke, junior Ian Collins and senior Zach Runte. \n“In the second half, it was strong Lake Mills pressure, and it was just us trying to hold them at bay,” Schultz said. “We didn’t have those shots we had in the first half. Lake Mills is probably one of the strongest counter attack teams we have faced all season.” \nLake Mills head coach Sam Fahsel said falling behind 2-0 in the middle of the first half did not influence a change in the game plan. \n“We worked the ball around, we dominated possession and we dominated the game,” he said. “It was just one of those nights where it was lucky and good for Lakeside, I guess. We were the better team.” \nLake Mills’ record fell to 4-4-1 in the conference and 10-6-3 overall. \nLakeside Lutheran will travel to Jefferson for a non-conference match Thursday at 6:30 p.m. Meanwhile, Lake Mills will await to see who and where it will play in the WIAA Regionals which begin next Tuesday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T17:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T00:59:28.436+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
