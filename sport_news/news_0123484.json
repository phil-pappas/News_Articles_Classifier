So take his perspective on the final 20 seconds against Rutgers late Saturday night for what it's worth.\n\"It (was) very hectic. Absolutely, it's extremely hectic in those last seconds,'' Dantonio told NJ Advance Media after watching his team survive Rutgers' rally attempt.\nRELATED: What happened on last play of Rutgers' loss to Michigan State?\nTold that Norries Wilson in an adjacent room had just taken the blame for telling quarterback Chris Laviano to spike the ball on fourth down, Dantonio said both Rutgers' interim head coach and quarterback should be given a pass.\n\"There's 17 seconds to go, he's trying to get people lined up,'' Dantonio said. \"The clock's probably going to run down to two seconds, or something like that. It was chaotic.\n\"All of sudden he spikes the ball and everybody on our sideline was yelling, 'It's fourth down.' It was chaotic so I wouldn't be too hard on the quarterback. He made a lot of plays. He made a lot of plays.''", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T19:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T21:00:27.674+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
