Let's review the Hapursville/Afton win before going to the schedule. The Hornets beat Thomas A. Edison 39-20 yesterday thanks 5 turnovers on defense and the running of Josh Wilson. Harpursville caused 3 interceptions and recovered two fumbles while Mr. Wilson rushed for 150 yards and 4 scores. This team lost their starting quarterback Tyler King to injury and they've won their last two games by two scores or more because Wilson and Senior Dillon Lindsey have led the charge in his absence. \"It's great to be in the playoffs, that was our goal when the season began. The last two weeks we haven't executed the way we are capable of because of too many mistakes and some sloppiness and it certainly will not bode well for the playoffs. We will fix things during the week in practice and we will be just fine, next week, said Head Coach Tim Petras. The Hornets always seem to be playoff bound. Tim Petras has done a good job making them a postseason team since he has arrived.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T07:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T10:58:51.405+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
