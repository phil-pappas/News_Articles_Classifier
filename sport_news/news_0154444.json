It's a basic lesson in the ideals of civics and local government.\nWhat makes a recent case in Glencoe uniquely impressive is the resident advocating for change is 12 years old.\nMolly Bingham, a Central School seventh-grader, lives near a stretch of the Green Bay Trail near Hazel Avenue. For years, she watched bicyclists going in either direction on 5-foot-wide sidewalks, leaving walkers and others vulnerable to being hit given the narrow passage.\n\"We knew it was a safety hazard,\" Bingham said.\nMarisa Bingham, Molly's mother, also knew of the issue.\n\"I love bikers as much as anybody, but they don't use the proper safety protocol,\" she said. \"Some do, but a lot don't warn you that they are coming by.\"\nYet, it is one thing to know of a problem; it is another to do something about it. Molly decided it was time for action when one of her younger sisters came terrifyingly close to being in an accident and the question at the Bingham house shifted to what could and should be done.\nMolly Bingham Karie Angell Luc / Pioneer Press Molly Bingham (left), 12, of Glencoe and a Central School seventh-grader, near the Old Green Bay Road line Sept. 25, where additional cement was added to accommodate cyclists like Karla Cavanagh of Glencoe (on right).

(Karie Angell Luc / Pioneer Press) \"She would always complain about it, so I said 'let's make a lesson out of this, let's learn.' I think as a parent, something we need to do is we need to teach our children how to use our voices,\" Marisa Bingham said. \"We don't want to pass the baton to someone else to do that. I honestly felt that we knew this path better than anyone else. So we said 'what can we do?'\"\nFor generations on many types of causes, citizens have collected signatures on petitions, and the Binghams thought that might be the best course of action in this case.\nSo last March, on what they remember being a beautiful day, Molly and other family members walked down the block to the troublesome portion of the trail and set up shop for a couple hours asking people coming by to sign up and show support.\nAs luck would have it, one of the people that happened to be going by that day was village board trustee Joel Solomon, who was in his final days in office. He arranged for a meeting with Village Manager Phil Kiraly for Marisa and Molly.\nMolly admitted there were some proverbial butterflies in her stomach when she met with Kiraly.\n\"I had no idea who he was or what he looked like,\" she remembered.\nNerves aside, Molly came prepared to not just talk about the sidewalk's shortcomings, but also to show it.\n\"We wrote up this big paper and the cons of the path and what could be done to make it better,\" Molly said. \"We had pictures that showed the congestion.\"\nIn an added streak of good fortune, the Binghams were pleading to a friendly audience as Kiraly uses that portion of the trail himself.\n\"It helped that he was familiar with that path,\" Molly said. \"It was easier for me to explain because he understood and he had seen bikers and knew what it looked like.\"\nHer presentation worked and Kiraly agreed that a change was necessary. During the summer, the village widened the concrete portion of the sidewalk to eight feet. Public Works Director David Mau said the project cost about $5,000.\n\"After the meeting, I felt really good that I had accomplished something,\" Molly said.\nKiraly was impressed by Molly's initiative and she was honored for her efforts at the Sept. 17 village board meeting.\n\"She went above and beyond to address an issue that was affecting her community and ... she took some civic-minded steps to see that the situation was resolved and worked toward a situation that made sense and made a really salient argument to me when she met with me,\" Kiraly added.\nMolly, whose interests include swimming, biking, walking and rollerblading, admitted to another case of nerves when she was honored by the board of trustees, yet was very pleased.\n\"It felt good that people had seen what I did,\" she said.\nToday, as Molly walks to school using the trail, she notices the extra room for everyone to navigate and takes pride in how she made her neighborhood a little safer.\n\"I see a lot of people using both sides,\" she noted. \"So it makes me happy.\"\nDaniel I.
