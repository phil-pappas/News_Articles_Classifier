More from KOTA Territory NBA investigating Barnes-Fisher incident \nTesting will begin at MetLife Stadium, a league spokesman told USA Today, this season and provide multiple games of data for the NFL to evaluate. \nFor up to 12 games the \"boundary camera\" system will be in place with views across the goal line, back of the end zone and sideline that aren't always available to replay officials. \nHowever, there are questions among competition committee members about expanding replay.
