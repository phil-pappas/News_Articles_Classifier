(AP) - Paxton Lynch threw for 305 yards and two touchdowns, helping unbeaten Memphis extend its winning streak to 12 games with a 24-17 victory over South Florida on Friday night. The junior from Deltona, Florida, also scored on a 3-yard run for the Tigers (5-0, 2-0 American Athletic Conference). They are off to their best start in 54 years and tied No. 4 TCU for the nation's second-longest Football Bowl Subdivision winning streak behind top-ranked and defending champion Ohio State's 17. South Florida (1-3, 0-1) led 10-0 early, but sputtered offensively after putting together a 12-play, 95-yard touchdown to begin the game. Quinton Flowers threw a 23-yard TD pass to Elkanah Dillon to trim USF's deficit to seven points with 1:49 remaining, but his last pass was intercepted by Reggis Ball to end the prospect of a comeback. Lynch topped 300 yards passing for the fourth straight game and eighth time in his career. He threw a 20-yard TD pass to Sam Craft in the second quarter, then watched 215-pound running back Doroland Dorceus rumble up the right sideline before cutting back to the middle to turn a screen pass into a 55-yard scoring play that put Memphis up 24-10 in the fourth quarter. Lynch finished 20 of 33 with no interceptions. Flowers was 17 of 26 for 198 yards for USF, which also got 108 yards rushing from Marlon Mack, last year's AAC rookie of the year.
