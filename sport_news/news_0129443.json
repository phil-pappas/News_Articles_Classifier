Related \nBut running back Charcandrick West's critical fumble on the Vikings' half of the field spoiled a potential game-winning drive as Minnesota held on for a 16-10 win at TCF Bank Stadium. \nFor three quarters, Minnesota looked like it was going to cruise to an easy win. \nKansas City couldn't get out of its own way offensively, gaining just two first downs before halftime, and getting one more via penalty. \nThe Vikings led by 13 after 45 minutes, thanks for a 4-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Teddy Bridgewater to tight end Kyle Rudolph and a pair of Blair Walsh field goals. \nBut Cairo Santos' 48-yard field goal got the Chiefs on the board two minutes into the fourth quarter, and quarterback Alex Smith connected with receiver Albert Wilson on a 42-yard middle screen for a touchdown to make it a three-point game. \nThe Vikings drove 53 yards on 10 plays, killing four minutes off the clock and setting up Walsh for his third field goal of the day from 45 yards out. \nThe Chiefs' potential winning drive got off to a good start, with Smith connecting on a 37-yard pass to tight end Travis Kelce, but West's fumble on the next play was recovered Minnesota defensive end Brian Robison at the Vikings 38-yard line. \nKansas City had one more crack at it with under three minutes to play, but four straight incompletions from Smith turned the ball over on downs. \nBridgewater finished 17-of-31 through the air for 249 yards and a touchdown with two interceptions. Kansas City held Minnesota to just 84 yards on the ground, including 60 yards on 26 carries by running back Adrian Peterson. \nMinnesota wide receiver Stefon Diggs, starting in place of injured Charles Johnson, went over the 100-yard mark for the first time in his career, catching seven passes for 129 yards. \nSmith was 22-of-37 through the air with 282 yards and a score. \nKelce hauled in five passes for 88 yards. \nNOTES: Chiefs DT Dontari Poe was inactive with a high ankle sprain. ...
