Photograph: Atsushi Tomura/Getty Images \nA ustralian wild thing Nick Kyrgios edged a step closer to a possible ATP ban when he was fined for a verbal outburst in his first round match at the Shanghai Masters. \nThe ATP confirmed that the 20-year-old had been fined $1,500 for an 'audible obscenity' during his 6-3, 6-2 victory over Austrian Andreas Haider-Maurer on Monday. \nKyrgios, ranked 32 in the world, received a suspended 28-day ban and $25,000 fine in August for vulgar comments directed towards Swiss player Stanislas Wawrinka at the Rogers Cup tournament in Montreal.
