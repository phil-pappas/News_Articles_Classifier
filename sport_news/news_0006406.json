'Running footy' \n\"Usually if you kick a goal at the end of the game to win, it's a pretty good escape,\" said Cheika. \"Saying that, if you score five tries, then you expect to be near the winning side. \n\"Maybe we shouldn't have opened it up for them but we wanted to play to our identity which is to play running footy,\" he added. \n\"When the goal (conversion) went over for Scotland, many teams would have thought 'let's go home, we have had a good run'. I just liked the way we got back into the game any way we could.\" \nAustralia prop Sekope Kepu told AFP : \"It's funny, it's just dawned on me that it's now a Rugby Championship affair. But it's irrelevant what we did in the Rugby Championship, this is a whole new beast. We're very excited.\" \nWallaby wing Adam Ashley-Cooper, a try-scorer against Scotland, warned an improved performance was needed to tame the Pumas next weekend. \n\"Each game presents you with areas you need to address,\" he said. \"We need to tidy up our exits, get out of our half a lot better. \n\"I think the most important thing is to know that we're in a semi-final and be happy about that. They don't come around often.\" \nThe Wallabies beat the Pumas 34-9 in Mendoza in July. \nBut Argentina served notice of their World Cup quality with a convincing 40-23 quarter-final win over Six Nations champions Ireland in Cardiff on Sunday. \n\"They've improved a lot,\" said the 31-year-old Ashley-Cooper of Argentina. \"They have the ability to tackle all over the field now. \n\"We know they've got a dominant forward pack. They've got great set-piece and now they've got outstanding backs,\" added Ashley-Cooper, a veteran of 112 Tests. \n\"They're a threat from one to 15 so we're going to have to look very closely at their game and formulate a strategy that we think will beat theirs.\" â€“ AFP Opinion", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T06:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T20:46:16.748+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
