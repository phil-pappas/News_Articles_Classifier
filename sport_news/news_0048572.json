To hear them explain it, they're this close to turning it around.\n\"Execution,\" Kelly keeps saying is the culprit, with the insinuation that the players are good enough, but the plays have not been. \"Hit two kicks, and we're sitting here 3-1,\" Kelly even said, in a dose of both fuzzy math and unchecked optimism.\nMore coverage VOTE: Can Eagles contain Saints' passing game?

Latest NFL odds SHOP: Eagles Training Camp sportswear The Eagles will try to salvage their season Sunday before it goes awry. It's sheer coincidence that the game comes against the New Orleans Saints, whose last visit was Jan. 4, 2014. That was the first round of the 2013 postseason and perhaps the apex of Kelly's tenure in Philadelphia. His team hosted a playoff contest in his first season after winning seven of eight games and thriving with a young quarterback who threw 27 touchdowns and only two interceptions.\nNow, the Saints visit in what's perhaps the nadir of Kelly's tenure in Philadelphia. He has replaced many of the key players from the playoff team, and the current iteration - one assembled by Kelly - is underachieving. If their mission is reflected by their habits, then those habits must change.\n\"Nobody here likes losing,\" safety Malcolm Jenkins said. \"We've invested a lot. Just haven't gotten that return on the investment yet. We expect that to bear fruit soon.\"\n'A lazy man's excuse' Heath Evans, the former NFL fullback who is now an NFL Network analyst, has never been nominated to run Kelly's fan club. He was critical of Kelly from the time the Eagles hired him in 2013. Evans believes Kelly needs to adjust his offense to focus on more power running, and he does not subscribe to the suggestion that the Eagles' issue is \"execution.\"\n\"That's a lazy man's excuse,\" Evans said during an interview on Thursday. \"I can give you a whole bunch of plays that don't have a chance to succeed because the defensive coordinator of the opposing team whooped Chip mentally before the snap. And I can give you a bunch of plays where . . . to the average eye, it looks like those guys didn't get the job done. And I would say, 'Why did you block it that way to begin with?' \"\nEvans' contention is that the scheme is the issue more than the personnel, or even the execution. Evans likes the roster that Kelly assembled and said he \"can't speak more glowingly\" about the defense \"despite the . . . lack of complementary football.\" He believes if the Eagles revamped their rushing offense to a downhill, power style, it would open up the passing game and alleviate the pressure on the defense.\nKelly said the coaching staff assessed the play-calling that has led to the team's poor third-down performance, but don't expect the Eagles to introduce a new offensive system against New Orleans. Kelly believes in his scheme, and he also believes the margin between winning and losing has been so tight - they've lost three games by an average of five points - that it's not time to make dramatic changes.\n\"It's razor thin, so you don't throw the baby out with the bath water and say, 'OK, we are going to change our offense, change our defense, and change everything we are doing in our approach,' \" Kelly said. \"It is just that we just need to settle down, take a deep breath, and when we have an opportunity to make a play, we've got to make a play.\"\nThat view is more optimistic than another possibility, that the team is not good enough after Kelly's major offseason changes. The Eagles did not address the offensive line, and their depth at key positions is a concern. Sam Bradford was supposed to be an upgrade at quarterback, but he's been inconsistent. And the team has not been able to match the production of Pro Bowl wide receiver Jeremy Maclin.\nCharley Casserly, the former general manager in Washington and Houston, said on NFL Network last week that \"most general managers who are head coaches are better head coaches than general managers.\" He said the Eagles improved at cornerback under Kelly, but they are \"still not good enough;\" the team still has not replaced DeSean Jackson's speed at wide receiver; and the \"running game is not as good\" as it had been. At quarterback, Casserly said Nick Foles played better in the system than Bradford. And Casserly thinks Sproles is the Eagles' best running back.\nPerhaps most importantly, Casserly does not think the Eagles adequately replaced their starting guards.\n\"That does not give a passing grade for general manager Chip Kelly,\" Casserly said.\nEvans still thinks it's an enviable roster. Although depth is a concern, the Eagles' starting lineup includes high-caliber players at most position groups.\n\"Chip's got to take the talent he's acquired there and put them in a place to succeed - I mean, they're 1-3, they're one game out,\" Evans said. \"This team could still could easily be a 10-win ball club and win the division, but everything offensively will have to change to suit the talent at hand. In a heartbeat, there's a whole bunch of . . . head coaches that would be clamoring for this collective 53-man talent that Andy Reid had and that, honestly, Chip has added to in some good ways.\"\n'This team is better' Three months before the Eagles hosted the Saints in January 2014, they were 1-3 in Kelly's first season. The Eagles rebounded to finish 10-6 and win the NFC East.\nKelly said the situation was different in 2013 than 2015. He's been consistent with the \"execution\" explanation since the beginning of the season. It can sound like Kelly is passing the blame off to the players, but he said execution entails \"all of us,\" and he disputed the interpretation that he was not shouldering responsibility.\n\"We're a 1-3 football team, so that falls on everybody's shoulders in this organization,\" Kelly said. \"Coaching staff, players. We're all in this thing together, and it's not one individual's fault.\"\nMost players don't go into a season expecting to lose three of their first four games, but the Eagles had Super Bowl aspirations before Week 1. And even now they're confident that they are superior to what the standings suggest.\n\"This team is better than 1-3,\" defensive lineman Fletcher Cox said. \"The record doesn't say it, but the people in this locker room know we're better than our record.\"\nThe problems are quantifiable. The offense cannot extend drives because of a running game that's unproductive on early downs. The Eagles average 2.76 yards when running the ball on first and 10. They have 78 second downs this season, and 42 of them were 8 yards from a conversion or farther. That has made it harder on third down, when the Eagles have needed 5 yards or more on 71.4 percent of their attempts.\nThat has led to a 26.5 percent third-down conversion rate. It means the offense has been forced off the field too often, exposing the defense to more plays.\nThe Eagles defense has been on the field for 294 plays, the most of any team that has played four games. It averages more than 37 minutes on the field per game - almost four minutes more than its average the last two seasons, when it spent the most time on the field of any team.\nThe offense's problems and the defense's exposure are a bad recipe for winning football. It's a habit the Eagles must break, and as the sign they'll walk by on Sunday will remind them, their habits reflect their mission.\nzberman@phillynews.com\n@ZBerm", "external_links": ["http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&mi=11081&pw=159355&ctc=TrainingCamp&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.fanatics.com%2FNFL_Philadelphia_Eagles_NFL_Training_Camp"], "published": "2015-10-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T13:07:38.609+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
