By EDDIE CARIFIO ecarifio @shawmedia.com \nMAPLE PARK – Kaneland wasn’t about to let Sycamore run all over the place in its homecoming game Friday night. \nSo Brett Bemis and the Spartans threw all over the Knights instead. \nBemis threw for 230 yards in the Spartans’ 35-7 win over the Knights, although the senior quarterback left the game late in the third quarter with an apparent leg injury. \nSycamore coach Joe Ryan said Bemis showed what he was capable of in his 9-for-11, three-touchdown performance – with all of his stats coming in the first half. \n“I think the game really slowed down for him,” Ryan said, adding that he thought Bemis would be ok and will “fight through” the injury. “They say that all the time, but you really saw it for him tonight.” \nThe Spartans (3-3 overall, 1-1 Northern Illinois Big 12 East) led 28-0 at halftime. \nMatthew Coovert, who had a couple of big plays on defense and a touchdown catch in the first half, returned the kickoff 97 yards to start the second half and put a big dent in to any hope of a comeback for the Knights (3-3, 1-2). \n“We talked about it how we needed that big play to spark us,” Coovert said. “It quieted them down. It was just a dagger.” \nKaneland got its touchdown early in the fourth on a 4-yard run by Jake Marczuk, who finished with 16 carries for 45 yards, plus was 10 of 24 with an interception for 107 yards passing. \nThe Sycamore defense spent the game swarming Marczuk, preventing him from being his normal self both running and throwing the ball. \n“We got into some predictable situations there where they could come after us” Kaneland coach Tom Fedderly said. “If we catch the ball, it opens up other things. If we execute, it’s a different game. If you get in predictable situations with the athletes they have, they can just let them loose. That’s what happens.” \nNick Niemann led that swarm, sacking Marczuk twice and breaking up a pass as well. \n“We were able to get to (Marczuk) and that’s the key,” Ryan said. “He’s such a good rhythm thrower and he wants to throw on time. We felt like if we got people at least to his feet it could give some issues. But we were getting people at his chest, which makes it a lot better, too.” \nSycamore went three and out on its first two possessions, but Bemis found Jackson Ryan for a 64-yard pass on the first play of its third drive for the game’s first score late in the first quarter. \n“We busted a long one early... and that got us going a little bit,” said Joe Ryan of Bemis’ long pass to his son. “We needed something. We punted the first two series and Brett did a nice job counting the coverage up, saw the middle of the field and threw a nice ball. Those are big plays that got the momentum going our way early.” \nThe Spartans added touchdowns on all three possessions of the second quarter, starting with a screen pass Coovert turned into a 35-yard touchdown on the first play of the frame. \nThey added a 4-yard run from Chris Pawola and closed out the big quarter with a 30-yard pass to Niemann with 55 seconds left to take a 28-0 lead into the half. \n“I just give them credit, they made the plays and we didn’t,” Fedderly said. “I’m not going to say anything about our kids. Our kids fought hard. That was a good team and they made more plays than us.” \nFor the Spartans, it was their second win in a row after a 1-3 start to the year. \n“We got off to a good start and we know we had too,” Ryan said. “We dug ourselves a hole to start the season, and this type of score against this type of team – you don’t think these things are going to happen. Things just started going our way and it was our night.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T08:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T04:13:06.209+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
