Just ask the Dodgers’ ace right-hander Zack Greinke. It’s a method he has adopted watching teammate Clayton Kershaw.\nIt all comes down to making good pitches. It can’t get simpler than that.\n“The thing I learned most from [Kershaw] is just, if you got some good pitches you can almost have the same sequence to where the hitters almost know what you’re doing,” said Greinke, who will face an almost must-win Game 2 of the NLDS at Dodgers Stadium on Saturday.\n“But if your pitches are that good, they can’t do anything with them. That’s what Kershaw has done ever since I’ve been here. So I’d probably stop trying to trick guys as much as I used to and try to make my pitches as good as possible.”\nIt boils down to: Here’s my best pitch. Hit it. Or try to. That’s what the Mets will face again after finding a way to scratch enough runs off of Kershaw in a 3-1 victory on Friday night.\nGreinke, in most parts of the known galaxy, would be the unquestioned ace. But when a team also has Kershaw, that No. 1 billing can be tough to claim. So even with his credentials — including a major league-best 1.66 ERA and a 19-3 record — Greinke goes second in the NLDS. That’s fine, especially if short rest becomes a factor.\n“I told them three years ago, I’ll pitch on short rest. I just haven’t done it good in my career,” Greinke said. “I haven’t done good doing that in the past, and Kershaw is more confident than me doing it. … But I’ll do it. I just haven’t done good at it.”\nThat’s about the only thing he hasn’t done, to use his word, good. So rather than worrying about short-rest games, he simply focuses on his assignment, which he tries to treat like any other game. Good luck with that.\n“I do sort of treat it similar to just a regular game, or I try to as much as possible,” Greinke said. “I feel it’s helped out just trying to keep [routine] as similar as just any other game.”\nSo he will just go follow Kershaw. And that’s what makes the Mets’ task so tough. The Mets boast robust starting pitching, but Kershaw backed by Greinke is special.\n“In Greinke, you’ve got a guy that’s going to throw a lot of strikes, a guy that’s really going to hit his spots. Kershaw will make you chase pitches more out of the zone. He probably has better off-speed stuff,” one league executive said. “Greinke has more of a late-moving fastball. Kershaw is like Randy Johnson in some ways, and I think of Greinke being like Greg Maddux.”\nMaking good pitches, of course. Greinke made them in two starts against the Mets this season. He got one win, one no decision and surrendered two earned runs in 14 innings — a 1.29 ERA.\nBut Greinke is the first to acknowledge the difference in the Mets’ makeup, so he admits there’s only a “little bit” to take from his prior starts\n“They’re a little bit different than most teams,” Greinke said. “But [it’s] still making as good of pitches as you can, and that’s kind of the plan.”\nSounds simple enough.\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google Whatsapp Email Filed under clayton kershaw ,  los angeles dodgers ,  mlb playoffs ,  new york mets ,  zack greinke", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T06:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T13:40:36.804+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
