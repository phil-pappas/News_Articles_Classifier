Then if we play a really good team and don't play our A-game, they b---- that something's wrong with UConn: 'This kid's not any good. That kid's not any good. Geno Auriemma got outcoached by this coach.' It's unbelievable.\"\n\"I heard this WNBA coach say, 'I don't like Connecticut,\" Auriemma said. \"They're bad for the game because they dominate so much. They get the best players and they kill everybody.' And I'm like, 'That's the most idiotic statement I ever heard.' That just goes to show you how ignorant some people are.\"\nConnecticut, led by Syracuse native Breanna Stewart, won a third straight national championship in April.\nAuriemma has never been shy with an opinion.\nBack in April, he said that the men's game was a \"joke.\"\n\"I don't coach it,\" Auriemma said. \"I don't play it, so I don't understand the ins and outs of it. But as a spectator watching it, it's a joke. There's only like 10 teams, you know, out of 25, that actually play the kind of game of basketball that you'd like to watch.\"\nUConn makes a stop in Central New York this season.
