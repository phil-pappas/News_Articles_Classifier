It has been 18 years since the Aggies beat the Broncos, and these three things are critical if Utah State is to stop that streak. \n\nThe Aggies do not have the offensive firepower to make a large comeback in this game. Additionally, there is the issue of the Broncos' run defense. The Broncos have given up an average of just over 60 yards rushing. However, most teams are out of the game so early they become one-dimensional and just throw the ball. \nHowever, when Colorado State managed to keep the game within reach through the first half last week, the Rams did it with a healthy amount of rushing. In fact, they racked up nearly 100 yards rushing against the second-ranked Bronco defense in the first half alone. The Aggies need to take the early lead and avoid becoming one-dimensional if they want to upset Boise State. \n\nOffensively, the Aggies need to just protect the ball. Besides the obvious benefit of not putting the defense in tough situations, protecting the ball works for Utah State. Over the last three seasons, Utah State is 12-1 when controlling the ball for more than 32 minutes in a game. That trend will hold especially true Friday night. If the Aggies can control the ball and not make reckless mistakes, they will be able to control the game and keep the Bronco offense off the field. \n\nWith a true freshman guiding the ship, the Aggies sat back and let him get comfortable. That cannot happen Friday night. \nFortunately for the Aggies, the Boise State offensive line has had some issues protecting true freshman quarterback Brett Rypien giving up 2.5 sacks a game, which is tied for 84th in the nation. The Aggies will need to pressure Rypien early and often. They need to take him out of any rhythm early to keep him from gaining confidence in a hostile environment. \nThe Aggies will look to pull off one of the biggest wins in program history when they take on Boise State at Maverik Stadium at 7:05 p.m. MDT and can be seen on the CBS Sports Network.
