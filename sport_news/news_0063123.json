He has played just about 30 minutes total in three preseason games so far.\n* Mitchell said he also wants to play Zach LaVine a little more at point guard these last three games while the Wolves still apparently try to figure out just what LaVine is. He's struggled shooting this preseason at the other guard position but stepped up and hit a big shot late in Wednesday's victory over the Raptors in Ottawa.\nThe Wolves fly to Memphis this afternoon and won't shoot around tomorrow because it's a 5 p.m. game.\nOlder Post Rubio practices fully today, aims for Sunday return at Memphis", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T22:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T00:40:16.870+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
