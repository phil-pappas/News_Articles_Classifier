The salaries of seven coaches at private universities — such as Steve Sarkisian at USC — were not included.\nIt represents a big bump for Helfrich, whose $2 million salary last season ranked him 51st nationally , the lowest of any top-25 ranked team at the time. In his first season as head coach in 2013, Helfrich earned $1.8 million.\nThe Ducks rewarded him with a new deal (read the contract here) on Feb. 9, less than a month after leading the Ducks to a school-record 13 victories, an appearance in the College Football Playoff national championship game and soon after he was a finalist for two coach of the year honors, by the Football Writers Association of America and the Maxwell Football Club.\nThe deal escalates by $150,000 per year until 2019-20, when he tops out at $3.85 million.\nHelfrich, who has a 27-6 career record, now ranks as the fourth highest-paid Pac-12 Conference coach, trailing Washington's Chris Petersen ($3.4 million), UCLA's Jim Mora ($3.35 million) and Arizona's Rich Rodriguez ($3.23 million). Helfrich is 7-4 against coaches ranked ahead of him in USA Today's latest survey .\nOregon State coach Gary Andersen's $2.45 million salary this season ranks 45th.\nAs is custom with most coaching deals, Helfrich's offers big-paying incentives for the Ducks' academics and on-field performance. He'll also earn bonuses if Oregon wins 10 and 11 games, compared with his former deal, which kicked in a bonus only at 12 victories. A national title will earn him $500,000, double what his previous deal would have paid out.\nAt $7.08 million, Alabama's Nick Saban is America's highest-paid college football coach. Trailing him is Michigan's Jim Harbaugh, earning $7.0 million in his first year at his alma mater.\n— Andrew Greif\nagreif@oregonian.com\n@andrewgreif", "external_links": ["http://sports.usatoday.com/ncaa/salaries/"], "published": "2015-10-08T20:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T04:21:32.743+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
