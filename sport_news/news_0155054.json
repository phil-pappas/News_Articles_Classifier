Even veteran Mets infielder David Wright was out at the time.\n\"There's a lot of guys that I'll be seeing for the first time this season,\" Kershaw said Thursday. \"Definitely a completely different team. Obviously, a lot better than what we faced in July.\"\nThe Dodgers aren't the same team that got chased out of the Division Series by St. Louis a year ago. They shipped out Matt Kemp , Hanley Ramirez and Juan Uribe (now a Met), and ushered in veterans Jimmy Rollins , Howie Kendrick and Yasmani Grandal.\nWhen Kershaw takes the mound for Friday night's opener at Dodger Stadium, he'll be trying to earn just the second postseason win of his career after going 0-4 in his past two series against the Cardinals.\nMore Information\nNL Division Series\nMets vs. Dodgers\nWhen: 9:45 p.m. Friday\nWhere: Dodger Stadium, Los Angeles\nTV/radio: TBS, WMML 1230 AM, WTMM 104.5 FM\n\"I definitely remember,\" he said, \"but it's a new team, new season and, hopefully, for me a new outcome.\"\nThe Mets won four of seven meetings between the teams, all in that month before Yoenis Cespedes arrived from Detroit in a trade that boosted the Mets' anemic offense. They are in the playoffs for the first time in nine years; the Dodgers are making their third straight appearance for the first time in franchise history.\nKelly Johnson and Uribe joined the Mets shortly before Cespedes, acquisitions manager Terry Collins credited for turning around the team along with his message to the players: If you hit, you'll play.\n\" Lucas Duda took off, (Wilmer) Flores took off, Kelly Johnson and Juan kept playing, as well,\" Collins said. \"All of a sudden guys are looking at their jobs saying, 'Oh my gosh, I've got to step up here,' and they did.\"\nKershaw will be opposed by Jacob deGrom, last year's NL Rookie of the Year and a converted infielder who is making his playoffs debut. The right-hander isn't about to compare himself to Kershaw, last year's NL MVP and a three-time Cy Young Award winner, except in one area.\n\"The way he takes the mound, he goes out there and attacks hitters,\" deGrom said. \"I try to do the same thing, not get intimidated by anybody who steps in the box and go out there and make your pitches when you need to.\"\nNote: Mets left-hander Steven Matz , who has been bothered by back stiffness, threw approximately 90 pitches in a simulated game in Port St. Lucie, Fla. If he is put on the Division Series roster Friday, he likely would start Game 4. Otherwise, it likely would be 42-year-old right-hander Bartolo Colon , or deGrom on short rest.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T07:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T08:58:32.822+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
