And no one would’ve blamed her for opportunistically pulling away from the Atholton runner. \nBut Bernardoni did none of those things. \nInstead, she encouraged O’Brien to keep up with her during the third mile, and the Atholton runner did just that. Bernardoni placed 30th, while O’Brien was 32nd. \nBernardoni’s performance helped the Lions finish a respectable second, but the sportsmanship she demonstrated was just as meaningful, maybe even more so. \nOn Tuesday, O’Brien sent an email to Lions coach Rob Wilhelm, telling him how helpful and inspiring Bernardoni had been during the competitive event. \nWhat made Bernardoni make such a gesture? \n“I had been behind her for most of the race, but when we got to the third mile, she started to pull back,” she said. “And I think as an athlete, it’s kind of hard to watch. Someone who’s pushed you the entire race starts to fall back. \n“So I think as a competitor, I would hope that all athletes would do that. I think it’s hard to get on the starting line in the first place. So to finish the race together is kind of a nice feeling.” \nSuch an attitude isn’t surprising, considering the reason Bernardoni took up running. \n“I started running for two soldiers that were killed in Afghanistan, and so I always feel their presence in the race,” she said. “Spiritually, I feel like they would want me to push other people because they pushed me. So I think it’s easier to do things when you’re working with someone else.” \nThe soldiers, staff sergeant John Hansen and first lieutenant Sean Jacobs, were under command of her father, Colonel Kolin Bernardoni. Regan didn’t know them, but she was inspired through her father’s relationship with them. \n“When you’re little and your dad goes to Afghanistan, it’s kind of like, ‘Dad’s taking a vacation,’ and you have more time with your mom,” she said. “And to get a phone call from your dad who’s crying because he’s lost two soldiers, it changes your perspective on what’s actually happening. And it becomes real. Your dad’s in a war zone, people are hurting.” \nBernardoni is new to Walkersville’s team — the senior moved from Washington state. Wilhelm wasn’t a bit surprised when he learned she tried to help a runner from another team during Saturday’s race. \n“When I first talked to her, you could tell the maturity level was there,” Wilhelm said. “The way she supported somebody like that — it’s in her nature.” \nBut such things don’t happen every day on the cross-country course. \n“It doesn’t happen too often, especially in a varsity race, and especially toward the front of the pack, where she was,” Wilhelm said. “You don’t see that too often at all in that kind of situation.” \nExpanded standings \nCentral Maryland Conference records will be used to determine which teams play in CMC championship games, so those conference records are now provided on this Prep Page in addition to each team’s division and overall records.
