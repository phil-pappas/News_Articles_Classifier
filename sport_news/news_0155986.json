Twice.\nJustin Tucker could. Twice.\nThe big-legged Baltimore kicker hit a 42-yard field goal to tie the Steelers in the final seconds of regulation and made a 52-yarder with 5:08 left in overtime to give the Ravens a 23-20 victory Thursday night in Pittsburgh.\nScobee had two chances to give the Steelers a cushion late in the fourth quarter only to pull both kicks wide left. The second miss gave the Ravens (1-3) enough time to put Scobee well within range to send the game to an extra period.\nPittsburgh then twice opted to go for it on fourth down in Baltimore territory in overtime rather than send Scobee out for a long attempt into the tricky wind at the open end of Heinz Field. Michael Vick, starting in place of injured Ben Roethlisberger, was stopped on fourth-and-2 at the 39 and later overthrew Antonio Brown on fourth-and-1 from the 33.\nNeither Vick nor Scobee would get a third shot. Joe Flacco led the Ravens to the 35 and Tucker's winner was never in doubt.\nJustin Forsett ran for 150 yards for the Ravens. Flacco threw a touchdown pass and did just enough late to help Baltimore end the worst start in franchise history.\nVick threw for 124 yards and a score and Le'Veon Bell ran for 129 yards and a touchdown but the Steelers (2-2) bumbled late.\nFor most of the night, it appeared Pittsburgh would survive with Roethlisberger relegated to a sweatsuit after spraining his left knee last week against St. Louis.\nThe Steelers sacked Flacco five times, forced a pair of turnovers and twice stopped the Ravens on fourth downs in the fourth quarter to seemingly seize control only to have Scobee let Baltimore back in it.\nScobee, acquired from Jacksonville in August after injuries to Shaun Suisham and Garrett Hartley, saw a 49-yard attempt sail wide with 2:24 to go. Pittsburgh forced a four-and-out only to watch Scobee flutter another one wide left with a minute left.\nIt gave Flacco just enough wiggle room to force overtime. Seven plays took the Ravens from the Baltimore 31 to the Pittsburgh 24, with Tucker drilling the 42-yarder to tie it with 3 seconds left.\nPittsburgh received an unexpected boost from cornerback Ross Cockrell, signed off the waiver wire at the end of the preseason. Cockrell picked off Flacco to end one Baltimore drive in the second quarter and scooped up a Flacco fumble early in the third that set up a 9-yard touchdown pass from Vick to Darrius Heyward-Bey as the Steelers took a 20-7 lead.\nHURRICANE WATCH: The NFL reportedly is watching the projected path of Hurricane Joaquin and making plans in the event Sunday's Philadelphia Eagles-Washington Redskins game needs to be moved. \nThe NFL Network said one option being considered is shifting the game to Ford Field in Detroit.\nAt this point the game is still scheduled for 1 p.m. at FedEx Field in Landover, Md.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T04:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T10:32:48.828+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
