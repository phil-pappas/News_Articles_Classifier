(Photo: Bill Vilona/bvilona@pnj.com) CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nThe team's first homecoming event at the University of West Florida became part of quarterback Grey Jackson's incremental progression. \nIt has been a challenging five months. \nJackson, who became one of the top prep quarterbacks in Alabama during his career at Fairhope High, has faced an arduous comeback from a broken collarbone. He sustained the injury while playing in the Alabama High School Association All-Star game in June. \n\"I am still in red (non contact jersey). Still not 100-percent,\" said Jackson, following UWF's intrasquad scrimmage Saturday that was scheduled around homecoming events on campus. \"I still have to get a lot of strength back. I think it showed on the field, really, \n\"There were a lot of passes I missed that I feel I can definitely make. I just have to keep working on the strength of my arm.\" Setting shines bright at UWF scrimmage \nJackson was among the most-touted signees of UWF's inaugural recruiting class. He was the named the Coastal Alabama Player of the Year by Al.com and was Class 7A all state. He said he endured injuries in high school, but \"none this debilitating, none that needed surgery to fix.\" \n\"It's taken a lot longer than I expected,\" he said. \nAlong with his collarbone injury, he also needed wisdom teeth removed during the summer. \n\"All that took place in the same six week period before camp,\" said UWF coach Pete Shinnick. \"He didn't start throwing until a month into (practice). And he started with a tennis ball. Then when we got him, it was five yard throws, then it was 10 yards. Every week he has added about three yards to his deep ball. But it started at 23 and we are about 38 right now.\" \nWhile regaining strength, Jackson has tried to work through being limited on throws. Sometimes the lack of zip results in a misplay. Editorial: Keep UWF games downtown \n\"His mind knows what it should be doing, but his arm doesn't respond all the time,\" Shinnick said. \"He knows when he floats a ball and when he throws a deep ball and it's five or six yards short because the doesn't have the arm strength. I see the frustration. \n\"But he is an amazing competitor and he keeps coming back every time wanting to do it and wanting to put himself in that position.\" \nPart of that competitive nature showed itself late in the first half of Saturday's scrimmage. Working a two-minute drill, UWF called for a throw to Rodney Coates who played at Clarke County (Ala.) HIgh. UWF promises new life for Historic Pensacola \n\"After the play was called, (Coates) was running past me and I said, hey Rodney, do you want to score a touchdown? He said, yeah, throw it up .If a receiver tells you to throw it up, you have to trust him,\" Jackson said. \nHe did and it worked. For most of the scrimmage, however, it was UWF's defense in control. Cornerback Marvin Conley from Cocoa Beach, who has shined throughout the three months, had a pair of interceptions. Linebacker Andre Duncombe from Miami-Jackson High, spent a lot of time in the offense backfield. \n\"These guys playing defense are really good,\" said Jackson, who passed for 2,241 and 23 touchdowns last season at Fairhope, along with 863 rushing yards and 16 touchdowns.\"They are really fast. The speed of the game speeds up so fast. \n\"Your windows are so small to make those passes, whereas in high school they are much bigger. It is definitely humbling playing at this level.\" \nJackson is counting on being at full strength and back to his former self during the Argos spring practice in preparation for the inaugural 2016 season. Saturday he was used in plenty of snaps with quarterback Mike Beaudry sidelined with a sore elbow. Jackson and Gunnar Ballant took the snaps for the Blue and White team. \nThis was the only time UWF had back-to-back scrimmages. It followed last Saturday's marquee event at the Blue Wahoos Stadium. The Argos will end their fall schedule with a final scrimmage on Nov. 7 at the UWF University Park Field, which has been well-worn from lack of rain and three months of practices. \n\"I knew this would be hard to go back to back,\" Shinnick said. \"I knew it would be hard to create the same energy and excitement, but like I told the team at the end, hey this is next year, this is every week and that's where they have to understand the maturity level it takes, the expectation level we have for them and what we looking for.\" \nWHAT'S NEXT?EVENT: UWF final 2015 scrimmage \nWHEN: Saturday, Nov. 7 \nWHERE: University Park Field at UWF. \nWHO: Blue vs. White in divided team. \nADMISSION: Free. \nBehind the merchandise tents at UWF scrimmage is the area were the new artificial turf field and the football training center will be constructed.
