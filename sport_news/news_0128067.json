I’ve been trying to get my s**t together,â he said in one video, “and I’m doing pretty damn good.” \n“I just really had to take a look at myself and my life and the way s**t was going and all the crazy stupid s**t I was doing and just finally admit to myself that it wasn’t working,” Chet said in another video. \nNEWS: Tom Hanks’ Son Chet Hanx Threatens Howard Stern \n“A couple months ago I was selling coke [and] doing coke until I couldn’t even snort it up my nose anymore because it was so clogged. I even smoked crack,â said the 25-year-old rapper, who used to go by Chet Haze. âIf I can change, you can change. There is a solution.” \n“I only say this to show y'all how real it is, not to glorify anything I’ve done,” he captioned the video. “There’s nothing glorious about bringing yourself closer to death and prison with each day of active addiction.” \nChet also apologized for his past use of the N-word in the videos, and opened up about the pressure of growing up with a famous father . \n“I’m genuinely sorry for the people I offended,” he said of his past use of the racial slur. \n“It’s been a long journey discovering who I am,” Chet continued. “Because all the pressures that I’ve dealt with in my life – you know, being the son of my dad and everything. Just trying to find where I fit in.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T21:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T06:39:41.097+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
