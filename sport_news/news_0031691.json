If not for Chase Utley’s Phillies, then Monday night’s National League Division Series Game 3 at Citi Field might have a different vibe to it, for the suffering wouldn’t have been as severe.\nAnd now, just as the Mets prepared to launch a new era of good feelings, their old rival has assumed a far greater place on the enemy scale.\nYes, Utley, at age 36, far closer to the end of his career than the beginning, suddenly finds himself as the most hated man in New York.\nThe term generally doesn’t last long — it could end in the next few days — but boy, it can be a doozy.\nUtley, who joined the Dodgers in August after spending his first 12-plus seasons in Philadelphia, put himself in the cross hairs with what MLB, in suspending him, called an “illegal slide” in Saturday’s NLDS Game 2. When he tried to break up a Mets double play, he plowed into shortstop Ruben Tejada, fracturing Tejada’s right fibula and thereby ending Tejada’s postseason, if not jeopardizing his career . The play proved to be the turning point in a 5-2 LA victory at Dodger Stadium that evened the series at one game apiece.\nFox Sports’ Ken Rosenthal reported Sunday that Utley reached out to Mets captain David Wright in an attempt to apologize to Tejada. Utley told Rosenthal, via text message, “In no way shape or form was I trying to hurt Ruben. I slid in hard like I have for 12 years. I feel terrible about the outcome.”\nSuch an attempt at compassion probably won’t reduce the loathing Utley figures to hear if, after appealing, he gets to play at Citi Field Monday. It won’t help that the Mets, including Wright, understandably were livid.\n“Everybody saw that it was more of a tackle than anything,” Game 3 starter Matt Harvey said Sunday at a Citi Field news conference, and Harvey added of Utley, “History has kind of shown that he’s kind of been in situations like that before.” In a 2010 Mets-Phillies game, Utley slid into Tejada similarly, only without resulting in such a catastrophic injury.\nAfter the game Saturday, Mets General Manager Sandy Alderson and his assistant GM, John Ricco, raised their voices repeatedly in a conversation with Major League Baseball chief baseball officer Joe Torre, arguing that Utley should have been called out for interference. Former Yankees manager Torre kept his calm, as is his nature, before disciplining Utley on Sunday night for his late slide.\nIf not for Tejada’s injury, this might have gone by without incident; the Yankees’ Didi Gregorius made an aggressive slide into second base in last week’s American League wild-card game, yet it’s already forgotten because Astros second baseman José Altuve is healthy.\nNow that Torre has ruled that Utley should be suspended, it’s fair to assume that public relations had a role in the sentencing.\nThe Mets can’t afford such a diversion as revenge. Their fans will bring the high heat for now, and if Utley, a pending free agent, returns to play next season, he probably should wear body armor when the Mets come up on his schedule.\nHey, you have to be great to be the most hated, so the soft-spoken Utley has that going for him.\nAnd the rest of us have this series, on its way to being a classic, with a villain for the ages and a hero still to be determined.\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google Whatsapp Email Filed under chase utley ,  los angeles dodgers ,  new york mets ,  philadelphia phillies", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T03:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T09:18:50.337+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
