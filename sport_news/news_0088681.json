(CHRIS SHIPLEY FILE PHOTO / SPECIAL TO THE MORNING CALL) Tom Housenick Contact Reporter Of The Morning Call Kutztown gets robbed on last play of game at first-place Bloomsburg. \nKellen Williams worked on a drill hundreds of times specific to the situation the Kutztown wide receiver was in on the last play of Saturday afternoon's game. \nThe junior co-captain beat a Bloomsburg defender to a spot in the right corner of the end zone, secured a perfectly thrown ball by quarterback Chad Barton, dragged his right foot inbounds and …. \nIncomplete, according to the official who was a mere few feet away. Game over. Bloomsburg wins 27-21 in overtime. \n\"[Kutztown wide receivers coach Steve Heck] always says to focus on the ball and feel the sideline,\" Williams said. \"I felt it. That was one I felt I was in.\" \nKutztown TV appeared to show Williams was correct, that he secured the ball and gotten at least one foot inbounds. \n\"I just saw the replay,\" Kutztown coach Jim Clements said. \"It was clear. We kick the extra point and we win. \n\"Last week, we got our [butts] kicked. This game, we played well enough and should have won this game, and our kids got robbed.\" \nAfter getting drilled last week at West Chester and having a players-only meeting, the Golden Bears (3-4 overall, 2-2 PSAC East) pushed the defending division champion Huskies (5-2, 4-0) to the limit. \nBloomsburg scored on Joe Parsnik's 22-yard touchdown run to start overtime. It came on a third-and-5 play from the Kutztown 20 (each overtime series starts at the opponent's 25). \nThe play went from being a first down to a touchdown thanks to a downfield block by tight end Nate Hoenl, a Whitehall High graduate. \nIt was one of two blocks on the play that Clements took issue with. \n\"We [had] two of our guys tackled to the [expletive] ground and no flag,\" he said. \nBut Kutztown had life because Bloomsburg's extra-point attempt by Tyler Smith, much like his 40-yard field goal midway through the first quarter, hit the left upright. \nAfter the official paused for a moment before ruling Williams out of bounds, a Bloomsburg player punched Kutztown's Kodi Reed three times in the face. Officials threw a flag, but there was no affect on the play because it occurred when the game was over. \nIf this were a Division I game, review would have determined what the right call should have been on the Williams catch. \nInstead, Clements and his players will have to move on. \n\"We have to forget about this,\" the Kutztown coach said. \"East Stroudsburg is coming in and they throw for 9,000 freakin' yards a game. \n\"We needed this win. We had this win. We had it.\" \nBloomsburg forced overtime by driving 87 yards in 11 plays. Tim Kelly's 12-yard touchdown pass to Chad Hoffman with 5:47 left in the fourth quarter capped it. \nKutztown's drive to take its third lead of the game was an uphill battle. \nAfter Bloomsburg senior captain Gary Postell was ejected for a late hit on Barton on the first play of the fourth quarter, Kutztown overcame three holding penalties on successive first downs. \nEach time, the Golden Bears executed, the last time when Barton hit Anthony Kelly on a 27-yard TD pass with 10:01 left in regulation. \nBloomsburg tied the game at 14 early in the third on Lawrence Elliott's 20-yard touchdown run. Elliott had 69 of the Huskies' 81 yards on the drive and finished with 209 yards on 29 carries. \nKutztown took a 14-7 lead at halftime thanks to Barton's 17-yard touchdown pass to Williams in the right corner of the end zone with 2:23 left in the second quarter. Williams beat double coverage to grab Barton's perfect throw. \nTyler Pratt's interception set up the drive. It was Bloomsburg's first turnover in 12 quarters. \nBloomsburg tied the game at 7 on a Tim Kelly 10-yard run on third-and-goal with 6:56 left in the half. Elliott's 62-yard run set up the score. \nKutztown scored first when Terry Williams' 1-yard TD run capped an 11-play, 48-yard scoring drive with 9:26 left in the second quarter. \nOn Kutztown's overtime series, Barton and Kellen Williams nearly connected in the end zone on first down, but it was incomplete. \nAfter Whitehall's James Wah gained four yards on second down and Barton's third-down pass was incomplete, Kellen Williams and Barton appeared to have teamed up for the game-winning score. \n\"I look to see the leverage of the safety,\" Williams recalled. \"I check to one route or another. I liked the leverage. Chad liked it. I looked at him. I didn't need to look at him. We just know. \n\"It was a perfect throw. It just didn't come out the way we wanted.\" \nGame Notes: Whitehall grad Andrew Harris had two tackles and one fumble recovery for Bloomsburg. Teammate Scott Beltz, a Pen Argyl grad, had two tackles. Salisbury product Tony David had four tackles and a fumble recovery. … Whitehall grad Zack Delp had five tackles and Wah ran for 55 yards for Kutztown.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T05:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T05:22:58.568+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
