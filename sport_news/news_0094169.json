His only trouble occurred when he walked the first two batters in the sixth, but he wiggled out of it without any damage.\nThe Royals' bullpen finished off the club's eighth consecutive ALCS victory.\nAlcides Escobar and Lorenzo Cain drove in runs off Estrada (1-1), while Eric Hosmer and Kendrys Morales tacked on two more off LaTroy Hawkins to put the game away.\nThe Blue Jays' three hits were their fewest ever in a postseason game.\nAs if the outcome wasn't bad enough for them, designated hitter Edwin Encarnacion left in the eighth inning to get X-rays on the middle finger of his left hand. The initial report was a strain of the ligament and Encarnacion was listed as day-to-day.\nThe Royals will try to take a 2-0 series lead when they send Yordano Ventura to the mound on Saturday. Toronto will counter with former Cy Young Award winner David Price .\nThe teams entered the best-of-seven series with plenty of history.\nTo start with, the defending AL champs beat Toronto in the 1985 league championship series, then beat the St. Louis Cardinals for the Royals' only World Series triumph. But far more recently was the tense, benches-clearing game that the teams played at Rogers Centre in August.\nVolquez was right in the thick of things.\nThe veteran starter kept pitching the Blue Jays inside, finally hitting Josh Donaldson with a fastball in the first inning. Tensions escalated as the game went on, with Toronto reliever Aaron Sanchez returning the favor by hitting Escobar to trigger a benches-clearing scuffle.\nAfterward, Volquez said Donaldson was \"crying like a baby\" over his inside approach.", "external_links": ["http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/45/64/8805651/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/45/64/8805651/3/920x920.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-17T08:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T08:25:03.425+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
