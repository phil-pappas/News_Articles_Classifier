At the moment it’s a long way off,” Pickering told SEN. \n“We’ve requested a trade at Brisbane and Collingwood will have to do a trade if it’s to happen. \n“If someone requests a trade and they’re out of contract, you either do a trade or there’s other options. \n“He’s keen to play in Melbourne and he’s keen to play with Collingwood, so it’s pretty straight forward, I would have thought.” \nMeanwhile, The Age has reported that Adelaide and Geelong are close to a deal on restricted free agent Patrick Dangerfield. \nThere is speculation Dangerfield will go to the Cats in a trade, without exercising his free-agent rights, in exchange for first and second-round draft picks. \nHawthorn youngster Jed Anderson apparently wants to leave the AFL premiers and could go to West Coast in a trade.
