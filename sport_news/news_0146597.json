It's the most ever in a game by a Bengals opponent (the previous most was five) and is tied for second most in a game in NFL history. \nThe Bengals led just 14-12 at halftime, but got a 55-yard touchdown pass from Dalton to Brandon Tate early in the third quarter, and then took advantage of a fumble late in the quarter by Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce, a University of Cincinnati product, to score a touchdown to pull ahead 29-15. \nKelce's fumble was caused by defensive end Michael Johnson, and safety Reggie Nelson scooped the ball up around the Chiefs 30 and returned it to the Kansas City 5. Two plays later Hill scored from five yards out and then added the two-point conversion run that was ruled no good at first, but was overturned on replay. \nHill also scored on a one-yard touchdown run with 4:50 left and had a first-half TD run. \nThe Bengals went ahead 21-12 after scoring a touchdown on their first drive of the second half following a stop of the Chiefs on their first possession of the half. \nTwo plays after Dalton had a 54-yard touchdown pass dropped by Marvin Jones, he rolled away from pressure to his right, fired deep for Tate, who laid out to make the catch around the Chiefs 8, then scrambled to his feet and raced into the end zone to complete a 55-yard touchdown. \nKansas City (1-3) followed that TD by driving to the Bengals 29, but had to settle for a 40-yard field goal by Santos, to close within 21-15 with 4:37 left in the third quarter. \nThe Bengals held a 14-12 halftime lead after 80-yard touchdown drives on each of their first two possessions of the game. \nDalton picked up where he left off in the Baltimore game by completing all four passes he attempted on the opening drive for 69 yards with wide receiver A.J. Green catching three of those passes for 51 yards. Hill capped the drive by running in from eight yards for his first touchdown since the season opener at Oakland. \nKansas City followed by driving from its 18 to a first down at the Bengals 10, but then stalled out and had to settle for the first of Santos' field goals, this one from 22 yards out to close within 7-3. \nThe Bengals responded by driving for their second touchdown. \nDalton completed two more passes to Green for 22 yards meaning over the last four quarters the duo had hooked up 15 times for 300 yards after Green didn't have a reception in the first quarter of last Sunday's win at Baltimore, but finished with 10 catches for 227 yards. \nThe big play of the touchdown drive was a 27-yard pass up the left sideline to Rex Burkhead. On the play Dalton avoided a blitzer coming right up the middle toward him, scrambled to his left and found Burkehead wide open. Two plays later, Giovani Bernard scored on a 13-yard run to put the Bengals on top 14-3 with 53 seconds left in the first quarter. \nKansas City put together another good drive the second time it had the ball, moving from its own 20 to the Bengals 20, but had to settle for a 40-yard Santos field goal 2:16 into the second quarter to pull within 14-6. \nAfter the Bengals went three-and-out, the Chiefs overcame a 67-yard punt by the Bengals Kevin Huber that gave them the ball at their own 7 and drove to the Bengals 34, but could get no closer. Santos connected on a 51-yard field goal making it 14-9 Bengals with 6:09 left in the first half. \nDalton hit Mohamed Sanu with a 52-yard pass on the Bengals first play following the field goal, but the drive stalled at the Chiefs 26 and Mike Nugent hit the left upright from 44 yards out. \nKansas City got a 34-yard field goal by Santos with four seconds left in the first half to cut the Bengals lead to 14-12. \nEach team had 240 yards total offense in the first half. Dalton completed 10 of 12 passes for 179 yards, while Chiefs quarterback Alex Smith was 16 of 19 for 190 yards. Chiefs running back Jamaal Charles had a big half with 113 yards from scrimmage (57 receiving and 56 rushing). \nSmith finished 31 of 45 for 386 yards with no interceptions, while Charles had 145 yards from scrimmage (70 receiving and 75 rushing) and wide receiver Jeremy Maclin had 11 catches for 148 yards. \nNOTEWORTHY: Bengals safety George Iloka was among the seven players made inactive for Sunday's game. Iloka missed practice Wednesday, Thursday and Friday after leaving last Sunday's game against Baltimore in the second half due to an ankle injury. Leon Hall started in his place, although Shawn Williams entered the game on the second play. ... Also made inactive for Sunday's game by the Bengals were: wide receivers Mario Alford and Greg Little ; tight end C.J. Uzomah ; rookie defensive tackle Marcus Hardison ; defensive tackle Brandon Thompson and defensive end Margus Hunt. It marked the fourth straight game that Alford, Little, Uzomah, Hardison and Hunt were made inactive. Thompson was active for last Sunday's game in Baltimore and played 24 snaps with two tackles, including one for loss. ... The return of defensive tackle Pat Sims led to Thompson being made inactive. Sims missed last Sunday's game in Baltimore due to a hip injury. ... The Chiefs made the following seven players inactive for Sunday's game: quarterback Aaron Murray; wide receiver Albert Wilson ; cornerback Steven Nelson; linebacker Desman Moses; offensive lineman Jah Reid; tight end Brian Parker and defensive lineman Rakeem Nunez-Roches . ... Defensive end Michael Johnson and defensive tackle Domata Peko each recorded their first sack of the season in the first half, while Carlos Dunlap and Geno Atkins each had a second-half sack. ... Cornerback Adam Jones left the game in the third quarter with groin injury and cornerback Dre Kirkaptrick played in the second half with an injured right wrist. \nPhoto: Tony Tribble \nFollow us on Twitter @Local12 and LIKE us on Facebook for updates! \nTo get \"The Skinny\" on local sports be sure to follow Local12 Digital Sports Columnist/Editor Richard Skinner on Twitter @Local12Skinny and LIKE him on Facebook for updates or email him raskinner@sbgtv.com.
