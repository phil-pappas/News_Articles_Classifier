Phil Mickelson and Zach Johnson were handed a one-hole penalty on the seventh when the former breached the 'one-ball condition' by playing a different model of the Callaway ball he had started the match with. \nA subsequent statement from the Presidents Cup match committee read: \"The committee is not allowed to have Phil go back and play in an attempt to correct the error. \n\"This is because once any player in the match plays a subsequent stroke, allowing a correction could potentially undermine the strategy already employed by both in the match in completing the hole.\" \nKeegan Bradley, not a member of this USA team but a former partner of Mickelson in international play, later tweeted his disbelief, writing: \"How can you lose a hole twice???! #usgarules #wow\" \nMickelson did go on to provide American fans with something to cheer about, however, the left-handed player holing out for an eagle from a fairway bunker on the 12th.
