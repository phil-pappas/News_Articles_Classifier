I know we've had a lot focus there, with the three guys that we've had there, but we have a lot of issues to clean up in our game. \n\"This move was made to clean up the situation and allow everybody to have some clarity, in terms of their minds, and hopefully get all three goaltenders playing.\" \nRamo will now report to the American Hockey League's Stockton Heat, while Jonas Hiller and up-and-comer Joni Ortio will share the netminding duties at the Saddledome. \nHiller will be between the pipes as the Flames try to snap out of a four-game funk in Friday's home date with the Detroit Red Wings (7 p.m., Sportsnet One/Sportsnet 960 The Fan). \n\"I was hoping for (Ramo) that he'd get picked up and get a chance somewhere else, which didn't happen,\" Hiller said after Thursday's practice. \"That's kind of too bad. I hope for him that he'll get to play a lot and find his game, find his confidence.\" \nIf that happens, Ramo could eventually find his way back to Calgary. \nKeep in mind, it was just over two weeks ago the 29-year-old was introduced as the starting netminder for their season-opener at the Saddledome. He was shelled for five goals that night by the Vancouver Canucks, but the rest of the Flames played so poorly they probably would have lost even if Carey Price and an in-his-prime Jacques Plante were both guarding the twine. \nAll told, Ramo posted an ugly 4.37 goals-against average and .879 save percentage in three starts -- and three losses -- this fall. \nRamo will share the net in Stockton with top prospect Jon Gillies, who has two shutouts and a .950 save percentage in three AHL outings so far. \n\"I said the same thing to him -- we're not sitting here because of Karri Ramo in this situation,\" Treliving said. \"Karri needs to get up and going. Jonas and Orts, they need to get up and going. So this just allows everybody to get some playing time and try to get their games in order. So he understood it. He's eager to get up and going and we'll see where it goes.\" \n\"We met a few days ago and we decided that everyone needs to play,\" added Flames head coach Bob Hartley. \"Is it final, our setup? I don't know. Obviously, performances will dictate our decisions. But right now, there are enough nets in Stockton and enough nets here to get everyone going, and we'll go from there.\" \nRamo was re-signed to a one-year US$3.8-million contract on Canada Day. He'll collect every cent of it even while stashed in the minors, but his 'buried' salary-cap hit will be $2.85 million against the Flames. \nTreliving and the other higher-ups can worry about the financial implications. With the crease now a little less crowded, Hiller and Ortio can just focus on stopping rubber. \n\"With all the stuff not going our way right now, it was something else to worry about,\" Hiller admitted of the three-goalie logjam. \"You want to just focus on your job, and knowing what your job is definitely makes it easier.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T01:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T20:32:33.096+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
