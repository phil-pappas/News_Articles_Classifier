The route passes through cities including Burlington, Vermont, Springfield, Massachusetts, and New York, with D.C. as the final destination.\nAmtrak said in a statement that the train \"reportedly\" struck a rock slide on the tracks and that no critical injuries had been reported.\nVermont State Police and local fire and rescue agencies responded to the derailment, and numerous emergency vehicles were at the scene.\nAt least several dozen passengers were loaded onto school buses to be taken to an armory at nearby Norwich University.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T19:49:15.891+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
