Steve Lewis/Durango Herald file photo Bayfield senior Kelton McCoy has gotten it done on the ground and through the air this season. Bayfield is 3-0 and is in first place in the 2A Western Slope (South) League. O ne of the toughest things a football team can do is to follow up an emotionally-charged win with another win the following week. That’s what the Class 2A No. 2 Bayfield Wolverines football team will try to accomplish this week after defeating the Class 1A No. 3 Paonia Eagles (formerly No. 1) last Friday on homecoming night, 35-0. As the Olathe Pirates come knocking, Bayfield head coach Gary Heide assured there will be no let-down game. “It won’t be hard,” Heide said when asked if it would be hard to get up for the game. “They have great coaches, and the fact that it’s a league game, there’s some motivation there. If you don’t win your league opener, nothing else matters, for sure.” The Olathe Pirates sit in second place in the Class 2A Western Slope (South) League, and will bring their 3-1 record to Bayfield. The Pirates have shut out their last two opponents with wins against Coal Ridge (38-0) and Roaring Fork (24-0). Olathe knows how to score, as the Pirates have put up 103 points. “Olathe spreads out the ball a lot,” Heide said. “Their bread and butter is the run mixed with some options. So we’ll have to play assignment football. We’ll have to play with passion and 100 percent effort.” Olathe’s previous two wins have come against teams that sit at the bottom of the 2A Western Slope (North) League, and considering how Coal Ridge (228 points allowed) and Roaring Fork (317 points) don’t have the most intimidating defenses, it’s safe to say Olathe hasn’t faced an offense quite like Bayfield’s, one that is far more physical than that of Coal Ridge and Roaring Fork. Bayfield’s offense is averaging 419 yards per game and 37 points per game. The majority of offense has come on the ground, as the Wolverines have put up 645 yards on the ground this season while averaging 322 yards per game. Senior running back Zane Phelps has carried a huge portion of the ground attack, totaling 301 yards of his own this season with four touchdowns. According to Heide, Phelps is healthy and ready to go. “Zane’s our go-to guy. He’s ready – he’s always ready to go,” Heide said. Last season, Bayfield beat Olathe 48-22. In that game, Phelps went for 180 rushing yards, 32 receiving yards and three total touchdowns. But according to Heide, fans won’t see the same team as last year. “I don’t want to compare anything to last year because they’re a lot stronger this year,” Heide said. The last time these two teams played at Wolverine Country Stadium, Olathe narrowly pulled off the win, 21-20, in 2013. The Wolverines are heavy on seniors with quarterback Kelton McCoy shouldering much of the leadership role. Even though his stats don’t tell the whole story of what he does, it’s McCoy’s his composure that is the difference. “Kelton is the leader of the team,” Heide said. “He directs the offense, and I expect him to do the same Friday night. His leadership off the field as a captain is what you’d expect from your quarterback.” With the offense hitting on all cylinders, Olathe also has to worry about Bayfield’s versatile defense. “Our defense has been playing lights out, disciplined and assignment football,” said Heide, whose defense has allowed only 20 points all season while being led by senior Noah Loutherback. “Noah is one of our leaders on the line,” Heide said. “We expect the best from him. Our whole offensive and defensive lines have been playing well.” With everyone healthy and ready for Friday night under the lights, one thing is for sure: the public will see another slobber knocker. Bayfield’s battle against the Olathe Pirates will be at 7 p.m. Friday night at Wolverine Country Stadium in Bayfield.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T06:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T16:15:00.987+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
