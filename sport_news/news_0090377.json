Clinging to a 14-point lead late in the fourth quarter, Jaier Garrett stepped up and made his biggest play of the season, picking off Sayreville quarterback Jayson Demild and returning it 27 yards for a touchdown, icing a 32-12 victory for the South Brunswick High School football team on Friday night. \nGarrett finished with two interceptions, a forced fumble and a fumble recovery as the Vikings turned Sayreville over four times in downright miserable conditions. \n“That felt great; we finally beat Sayreville after four years of not beating them, so it was great to put the icing on the cake. We played so well and we did this one together,” Garrett said. \nGarrett, a senior, forced and recovered a fumble with the game tied 6-6 in the second quarter and picked off Demild on Sayreville’s opening possession of the second half, when the game was still a one-possession affair. \nBut after Garrett’s interception with 8:12 to go in the third quarter, it was all South Brunswick (3-1), as the Vikings turned to bruising tailback Phil Campbell to put the Bombers away. MyCJSports \nCampbell finished with 20 carries for 114 yards and two touchdowns, the second of which came with 1:09 left in the third quarter to put South Brunswick up 26-12. Campbell intercepted a Demild pass three plays later to further dampen the spirits of Sayreville (2-2). \n“We have a lot of chemistry on the defensive side of the ball and we all step up in the big games,” Campbell said. \nCampbell led the South Brunswick rushing attack as the Vikings outgained Sayreville 243-109 on the ground. \n“Coach said that the weather was going to be bad and maybe play a factor in the game and we just had to grind out on the ground,\" Campbell said. \"I knew I had to step up today.” \nSayreville got on the board first when Demild hit Jahsim Floyd for a 9-yard touchdown four plays into the second quarter, but the Bombers were limited to just six points the rest of the way, only scoring again when Demild hit Bertrand for a 15-yard score on a fourth-and-6 from the South Brunswick 15 with 1:54 left in the third stanza. \nDemild finished 5-of-12 for 64 yards and those two scores, but was picked off three times. Michael Liberti paced the Sayreville offensive attack with 68 rushing yards on 19 carries. \nBut in the second half, when South Brunswick outscored Sayreville 20-6, it was all about the defense of the Vikings, led by Garrett. \n“Our line starting playing really great in the second half and they got some good pressure on their running backs and they didn’t get a ton of yards. We had so much aggression, wanting to win this game, so we left it on the field,” he said. “The weather didn’t play a factor in our game and we felt great. I love this team; they’re my brothers and no matter what, rain or shine, we’ll always do our best.” \nSAYREVILLE (2-2) 0-6-6-0-12", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T05:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T06:50:09.230+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
