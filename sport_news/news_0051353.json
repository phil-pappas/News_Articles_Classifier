(AP) - Attorney General Joseph Foster says New Hampshire will get about $160,000 from a multistate settlement with a nursing home pharmacy accused of taking kickbacks from a manufacturer in return for promoting a certain drug.\nFederal prosecutors announced last week that the $9.25 million settlement with Kentucky-based PharMerica Corp. resolves claims that it got kickbacks from Abbott Laboratories in exchange for recommending that physicians prescribe Depakote, made by Abbott.\nThe settlement partially resolves allegations in two whistleblower lawsuits.\nIn 2012, Abbott pleaded guilty and agreed to pay $1.5 billion over allegations that it promoted Depakote for patients with dementia and autism - uses not approved by the Food and Drug Administration.\nDepakote is an FDA approved drug used to treat manic episodes associated with bipolar disorder and certain types of seizures.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
