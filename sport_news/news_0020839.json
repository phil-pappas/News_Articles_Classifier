The two schools will take their rivalry to a new level — a few levels, actually — on Saturday when the Junior ROTC programs clash in their inaugural “Army-Navy” flag football game in Minden. A 1 p.m. kickoff at Keith Roman Field is scheduled for a game that is serving as a fundraiser for the Douglas Army JROTC and the Carson Navy JROTC programs. As far as rivalries go, the game will feature more than just Douglas vs. Carson. You also have Army vs. Navy, and yes, veterans are encouraged to come out and be part of the festivities. “It’s really to raise funds, have fun and have a fun rivalry,” said retired Major Bud Ford, dirtector of the Douglas Cadet Battalion. “Hopefully, we’d like to get as many vets out as we can.” Oh, and by the way, which is the bigger rivalry? Carson vs. Douglas or Navy vs. Army? “That’s a very good question,” said Dan Meyer of the Carson NJROTC program. “It kind of goes hand-in-hand and that’s the cool thing about it. The two high schools are big rivals and so are our respective (JROTC) programs. And it’s kind of fun to see two schools get back into the spirit of the Army-Navy rivalry.” This will be a unique football game, to say the least. For example, it’s an 11-man coed flag football game in which both teams are required to have three female players on the field for each play. To add an extra little twist to the rivalry, each team is required to have two members of each class (freshman, sophomore, junior and senior) on the field for each play. “That means you also have the unit vs. unit rivalry,” Meyer said, referring to the grade level. “And with the male-to-female ratio, that kind of makes the playing field more fair.” Douglas JROTC director and retired Major Bud Ford is coaching the Army squad. Before coming to Douglas in 2013, Ford coached wide receivers and special teams at Grimsley High School in Greensboro, N.C. Carson’s head coach is Chief Petty Officer Daniel Ingram. Another element to the game is the number of students from the two neighborhood schools are acquainted, many of whom are friends. “Kids like the competition, especially when they’re friends,” Meyer said. “You always want to be the winner.” The plan is to make this game an annual event in which the site will alternate each year between the two schools. “The kids are looking forward to it ... we’re looking forward to,” Ford said, “It should be a lot of fun; we hope people come out and watch.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T03:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T04:06:44.421+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
