Yep, they can throw a game together in a few days' time, and still out-tailgate the rest of the nation. We do football right.\nIt hasn't happened yet but scroll down for 5 things to know about the game, regardless of what else happens. Here are some times of interest for on-campus activities and here is a position by position game breakdown .\nAnd away we go:\nA season to remember?\nWhat the heck is going on out there? LSU has enough off-the-field football news for five seasons, and maybe 10, and it may not be over with the latest. LSU has been handed an extra SEC home game when South Carolina was forced to move its home game against the Tigers to. . . Tiger Stadium. It's enough to make coach Steve Spurrier hang up his visor for good by tossing it out of Death Valley. The Golden Band from Tigerland will be playing the South Carolina alma mater and fight song, the lyrics of the latter having been written by former LSU and South Carolina football coach Paul Dietzel. What's next, Les Miles resigns and Nick Saban returns?\nLeonard Fournette on LSU single-game rushing record: 'My job is to win' | Video Leonard Fournette talks to reporters on Tuesday.\nIt's only the second week of October and already in 2015 LSU has been sued by a former coach, John Chavis, who threatened to depose assistant coaches during the season; had its returning starting quarterback arrested with two other players in June; its offensive coordinator, Cam Cameron, undergo treatment for prostate cancer during fall camp; its season opener cancelled because of lightning, the first LSU football game cancellation since the 1918 campaign was dumped because of World War I; and LSU has perhaps the nation's best player and almost unanimous Heisman Trophy frontrunner in running back Leonard Fournette. It's all keeping us in the media busy. Maybe LSU officials should get to work on having the Alabama and Ole Miss games moved to Baton Rouge also.\nSpeaking of Fournette . . .\nWith all the hoopla over moving the game, the starting time, the network, everybody and their brother weighing in and scrambling to get tickets and parking straight, Fournette has flown under the radar, relatively speaking. He has rushed for 864 yards and 11 touchdowns â€“ both leading the nation -- on 99 carries and he gets to run an extra game on his own turf. Perhaps it makes up for having lost the McNeese State game, in which he might not have been in long enough to get 200 yards. But the Gamecocks' defense has been more of a hen session, with South Carolina allowing 388 yards per game of offense and 170 on the ground. It sounds like Fournette will have an opportunity to stretch his lead and the LSU passing game to get healthy. He needs 136 yards to hit 1,000 and 171 to surpass last year's 13-game total in only five games.\nLeonard Fournette 'ready to get out there with my boys again' LSU running back Leonard Fournette talks to the media about this week's game with South Carolina.\nFournette appears to be truly relaxed about living in this white-hot spotlight, at least his body language suggests that. He doesn't act like the annoyed athlete rolling his eyes (Zach Mettenberger) or the one who sneers and barely listens to the question (JaMarcus Russell). He doesn't always give the most in-depth or insightful answers, but he plays ball with the media and if you work hard enough, you can get something out of it, like the story he told recently about taking selfies with students. The point is that he seems mentally strong enough to handle the attention and not have it change the way he treats the rest of his life. He's more mature than most 20-year-olds but without having lost his youthful exuberance and charm.\nWide receivers running crossroads route\nLately, LSU wide receivers have played more like wide senders, or wide rejecters, or wide deceivers. They are the ones clearly dragging down the LSU passing game. Even the never-before-used tight ends are outperforming them with the starter on the injured list for two games. Seven drops in the last two games and it's time for this supposedly talented crew to snap out of the funk. Or perhaps they never will and we are at an it-is-what-it-is moment. What it is is baffling.\nLSU WR John Diarse discusses team's passing game, drops Tigers take 4-0 start to South Carolina at 11 a.m. Saturday\nThis group, led by fourth-year junior Travin Dural, vowed to get on the same page with quarterback Brandon Harris and make the passing game go. Harris has done his part, he is way better than last year. But the receivers, particularly Dural, don't seem to have moved an inch. Dural should be the guy getting upset at the others and whipping them into a focus-frenzy. He isn't the loud, motivating type, though, and he's making it worse by dropping passes. The ugliest of the seven drops cost LSU a chance at a touchdown, which would have cut off Eastern Michigan's momentum going into halftime. LSU kicked a field goal one play after the drop but there was nary a single cheer to be heard as the Tigers trudged off the field one play from falling behind the biggest cupcake on the schedule.\nHot starts, cold finishes\nLSU has not trailed this season. Sounds incredible, but it's true. LSU has started well in most every game with 14-0 leads in three of the four and 7-0 in the other. The defense has given up two first-half touchdowns, both last week and one of them set up by a fumble return to the LSU 3-yard line. The offense hasn't needed much time to gear up, although it can't depend solely on Leonard Fournette much longer. After South Carolina, LSU will be facing teams with winning records the rest of the season, with the possible exception of Arkansas. Blowing hot and cold will ultimately catch up with a team bidding for a College Football Playoff spot.\nLSU heads for South Carolina with anemic passing game | Vlog LSU beat writer Jim Kleinpeter and columnist Ron Higgins look ahead to the Tigers game with South Carolina.\nThere are two key \"pieces\" to borrow from the Bard on the Bayou, Les Miles. The passing game is an obvious one and the other is special teams. This season's Tigers are on a track similar to 2011, but with a better offense. But that team had a monster defense and special teams that made up for an offense that really wasn't as good as its numbers. LSU doesn't have to become Air Coryell and Jamie Keehn doesn't have to become his Outback brother Brad Wing, but both must get better and stay consistent to get the payoff. And it pretty much has to start this week.\nThe Old Bald Coach\nSteve Spurrier is starting to look done, like a frayed, bleached-out visor, without its once-snappy elasticity. Time to hang that one up and go with a newer model. Spurrier talked at the summer SEC media days about having turned 70, that he still wants to coach. He's probably more fit than sports writers 15 to 20 years his junior. He could pass for 60. The vitality is there. The problem is, the recruits aren't. Now in his 11 th season, same as the younger Les Miles, he had a great run with three consecutive 11-2 seasons. Then, he followed it with 7-6 and he wasn't happy about it. Right now for 2015, 7-6 would be a miracle.\nSouth Carolina coach Steve Spurrier stays because 'we're winning' | Video Steve Spurrier talks to the media about what keeps him going.\nIn some ways, Spurrier was lucky to get recruits like Marcus Lattimore and Jadeveon Clowney, which fortified his three-year hot streak. The problem is, the state of South Carolina doesn't produce athletes like that often, and they don't come in large quantities when they do appear. It's not the Louisiana bounty that Les Miles enjoys, which is deep even in down years. Spurrier loves the coaching part of his job but when he was at Florida, he didn't have to work as hard at recruiting because the Sunshine State is even more ripe with talent than Louisiana.\nHe can still talk a blue streak but most of today's recruits were 3 years old when he won his last SEC title and weren't born when he won a national title. This season looks to be hard on Spurrier and moving a home game to the opponents' site doesn't help. One more aggravation: LSU is scheduled to play host to South Carolina in Baton Rouge again five years from now. Spurrier might make it a couple more but, otherwise, Saturday probably will be the last chance to see the Ol' Ball Coach throw his visor for the last time in Tiger Stadium.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T15:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T23:45:04.008+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
