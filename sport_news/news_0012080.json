The tentative polling percentage was 65.16 and might go up as final details of polling in far-off and inaccessible areas were yet to be compiled by poll officials. Barring a clash between two groups in Lamayouru constituency, where a Congress candidate was allegedly roughed up, polling went off peacefully. However, a decline in voting percentage was recorded compared to the last Assembly elections. Nobra recorded 75.6 per cent polling and Leh 67 per cent in the Assembly polls last year. “As per tentative figures, 52,863 of the 81,134 voters exercised their right to franchise in 26 constituencies. The polling percentage, which is tentative, is 65.16 per cent and may go up as details from far-off and inaccessible areas are yet to reach us,” said election authority and Leh DC Prasanna Ramaswamy G. He said a clash between two groups took place in Lamayouru constituency, where a contesting candidate was reportedly roughed up. “We are collecting details and have sought an FIR. The incident did not affect the poll process, which went off smoothly,” he said. Sunil Gupta, SSP, Leh, said polling was completely peaceful in all constituencies of the district. “In Lamayouru, a Congress candidate was roughed up. Due to poor connectivity, we are unable to know factual position. We may register an FIR. Except this, there was no major cognisable incident,” he said. Sources said 103 polling parties reached the district headquarters and shifted ballot boxes and other election material to the strongroom at Government Degree College, Leh, where counting would take place on October 23. At least 171 polling parties from far-off and inaccessible would reach Leh tomorrow and deposit their ballot boxes and other poll material, sources said. They added that there was enthusiasm among voters, especially women, at all polling stations as they queued up to vote, braving the morning chill. The Lingshet constituency witnessed the highest polling percentage of 86.58, followed by Sku-Markha with 84.16 per cent. Lower Leh constituency, where outgoing LAHDC Chief Executive Councillor Rigzin Spalbar was in the fray, witnessed lowest turnout with just 51.56 per cent voting.
