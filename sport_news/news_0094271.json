City police allowed the protestors to camp out on State Street and blocked off traffic all weekend. In a posting on Facebook , police officials said it was their duty to protect the constitutional rights and the safety of the protestors. They said shutting down \"a single block of State Street accomplishes both without significantly hampering travel or access to emergency services.\"\n\"We're making a really serious stand, and people are coming in from all over the state blockading the main street of the government of a state in the United States, saying, 'No, we can't continue to burn down our planet,'\" said Henry Harris with Rising Tide Vermont.\nMontpelier Police issued a statement Sunday evening saying that they had reached an agreement with protestors that would allow them to re-open the street to traffic by 4 a.m. Monday.\nGov. Peter Shumlin said Sunday he appreciated the work of the police and the latitude they have gave the protestors to have their voices heard. he also said he was also pleased State Street will be open for the morning commute.\nRelated Story:\nVt.
