VERNON, Iowa â€“ The Monmouth College football team laid claim to sole possession of first in the Midwest Conference South Division with a commanding 49-7 win at Cornell on Saturday. Highlighted by a juggernaut defense, the Fighting Scots limited the Rams to one first down, 25 total yards of offense, and no trips to the end zone in the first half. Monmouth held the Rams to 172 yards of total offense and only one touchdown which didn't come until the final four minutes of the game. Monmouth was led on defense by end Thomas Lesniewski who finished with five solo tackles, seven total, one sack, two quarterback hurries, and two tackles for a loss. Senior Ben Ketchum gave the Scots six of his own tackles, which included a sack, as Monmouth clogged up the middle only allowing 80 yards on the ground. Quarterback Tanner Matlick and the offense got things rolling early and often for Monmouth. Adam Parr, Connor Frakes, Easton Schaber, and Yansay Williams would go on to find the end zone on the other end of Matlick passes to give the Scots a 28-0 lead in the first half. The success through the air was met on the ground as Tanner Shafer, DeAndre Wright, and Austin Ray rumbled into the end zone in the second half as the Scots cruised ahead to a 49-0 lead early in the fourth quarter Monmouth's offense managed to stay balanced producing 526 yards of total offense, 244 yards on the ground and 282 through the air. With Matlick at the helm, the Scots offense converted on third down at a sixty-percent success rate (9-15). Matlick finished the game 19-27 for 282 yards, four touchdowns, and 63 yards on the ground. Parr left the field as the leading all-purpose yardage man for the Fighting Scots, totaling 48 yards on the ground and 71 yards through the air. Parr capped off his two receptions with a 70 yard catch and sprint to the finish. The Scots move to 6-1 on the season and 3-0 in South Divisional play.
