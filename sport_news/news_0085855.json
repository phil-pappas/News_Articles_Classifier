Manuel hasn't thrown a regular season pass in over a year but reports say he will be under center against the Bengals on Sunday.

The Bengals’ 27-24 overtime victory over the Seahawks was punctuated by a 331-yard performance by Andy Dalton and four sacks of Russell Wilson. \nBuffalo kept pace in the surprisingly competitive AFC East with a 14-13 victory over the Tennessee Titans. Bills quarterback Tyrod Taylor led his own comeback as the Titans held a 10-0 lead late in the third quarter. Taylor attempted just 17 passes and threw for 109 yards and a score while rushing for another 79 and an additional touchdown in the victory – but he injured a knee in the effort. \nSurprisingly, new Buffalo head coach Rex Ryan has seen his defense fall to 17th in the league and 14th in points allowed. Mario Williams leads the team with just two sacks, but the Bills do have a nose for the ball – linebacker Preston Brown and cornerbacks Ronald Darby and Stephon Gilmore have two interceptions apiece. \nBills of note on offense \nQB E.J. Manuel \nLate reports Tuesday say the erstwhile franchise quarterback, who was taken 16th overall in 2013 under a different regime in Buffalo, will be at the helm Sunday due to an injury to Tyrod Taylor. While Manuel has appeared in two games this year, he has not attempted a regular season pass since Sept. 28, 2014. Manuel presents the same dual-threat challenge Taylor would in the run game, but he is far less efficient as a passer. Manuel has completed just 58.6 percent of his passes in his career and has a 78.5 quarterback rating. He has also been intercepted 12 times. \nG Richie Incognito \nHead coach Rex Ryan gave the veteran guard a second chance after he missed all of 2014 following his suspension from the Miami Dolphins for bullying a teammate. Before Week 1, his last game was Oct. 31, 2013. Incognito is 32 and in his ninth year, but he is playing at a level reminiscent of his 2012 Pro Bowl campaign. He will need to play well as Geno Atkins continues to disrupt offenses inside. \nWR/KR Percy Harvin \nHarvin remains one of the most interesting and confounding players in the league. New to Buffalo this year – his fourth team since 2012 – Harvin caught 16 passes through the first three weeks but has just three since, and he was shut out against Tennessee as he’s gotten more attention due to Sammy Watkins’ injuries. If left to single coverage, he still presents an issue. He also remains a threat on kick returns (21.6 average). \nBills of note on defense \nCB Stephon Gilmore \nThe No. 10 overall pick in the 2012 draft has played up to that billing and is considered one of the league’s top cover corners. He came up with the game-clinching interception against the Titans, his eighth career interception and the third straight year in which he has had at least two. He has also forced three fumbles in his career. \nDE Mario Williams \nOne could argue the 30-year-old defensive end is off to a “slow” start with two sacks through the first five weeks, but the 6-foot-6, 290-pound pass rush specialist remains a handful for offensive linemen. He’s lived up to his near $100 million contract since joining the Bills in 2012, recording 40 sacks. \nFS Corey Graham \nHe’s not one of the “big” names on the Buffalo defense, but the nine-year veteran has developed from a special teams ace in Chicago into a solid contributor in the defensive backfield since joining the Bills from Baltimore in 2014. He’s been a part of 47 tackles the last four games (35 solo), including one sack. He hasn’t had a pass breakup yet, however, and has already suffered a concussion and is nursing a shoulder.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T22:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T00:07:44.953+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
