Peters also realized he was defending a tight end on a vertical route while another receiver broke toward him on a crossing route. So he decided to take a gamble.\nWhat happened next was a big reason the Chiefs selected Peters, a 6-foot, 197-pounder, with the 18th overall pick in the NFL draft. He abandoned his man, broke hard on the ball and beat Bridgewater’s intended receiver, Mike Wallace, to the spot.\nInterception.\nMost Read Stories Fugitive felon, linked to motorcycle gang, captured in Lynnwood after 4-month hunt Seahawks’ Fred Jackson crashes car; Cops say no evidence of drag racing Oregon alum to abusive Huskies fans: This rivalry doesn't need you Bill the Butcher workers still seeking CEO who vanished with their pay Loss of middle-income jobs seen as threat to region’s competitiveness Unlimited Digital Access. $1 for 4 weeks. Peters’ pick, which came in the fourth quarter with his team trailing by 10, led to the Chiefs’ only touchdown in their 16-10 loss to the Vikings.\nAnd while the Chiefs fell to 1-5, the play is an example of why the play of their first-round pick has been a bright spot in an otherwise disappointing season.\n“If you really study that play, that was a heck of a play,” Chiefs coach Andy Reid said. “That was a crossing route coming from the other side. He held his guy off and had vision back to that and had the instincts enough and awareness to take care of it; that was a big-time play.”\nThe Vikings acknowledged as much.\n“It was one of those plays where he understood who was our flanker on that play and we had a tight end out there, (so) I guess he was confident that we weren’t going to throw it deep to a tight end or something like that,” Bridgewater said. “It was a great play by him.”\nThrough six games, Peters ranks third on the Chiefs in tackles with 31 and is tied for fourth in the NFL with three interceptions. He also leads the team in passes defensed with 10, which is twice as many as the next-closest player, safety Ron Parker (five).\nThe way Peters was able to bounce back with a strong performance against the Vikings after he was whistled for a game-changing pass-interference penalty in a loss to the Chicago Bears a week before was also encouraging for the Chiefs.\n“He’s a young guy, so … (and) he hears me say it to him all the time … you just stay aggressive and something good is going to happen,” Reid said.\nNotes • Miami Dolphins defensive end Olivier Vernon not only plans to appeal his NFL fines for the low hits he made on Tennessee Titans quarterback Marcus Mariota , but he vehemently denied claims that he’s a dirty player. Vernon said he was fined for both his personal fouls that occurred when he was trying to sack Mariota. He wouldn’t disclose the total amount of his two fines, but he admitted it is enough to purchase a luxury car.\n• Mariota, who suffered a sprained MCL in his knee, did not practice Wednesday. The rookie was not wearing any protective gear on his injured leg as he talked about playing Sunday against Atlanta. “I’m going to do my best to make sure that I’m prepared and hopefully can go on Sunday,” he said.\n• Tom Brady , 38, has no plans to retire anytime soon. The New England Patriots quarterback said he wants “to play for a long time. Maybe 10 more years. I think that’s probably what my goal is.”\nSeattle Times staff", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T05:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T07:57:09.345+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
