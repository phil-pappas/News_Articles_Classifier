(Photo: Patrick Oehler/Poughkeepsie Journal) Story Highlights #PJTop3: Three of the top football performances in Week Six. Nominate performances by using #PJTop3 on Twitter. Luke Timm, Our Lady of Lourdes: How could Timm top teammate Billy Riccardi and his three rushing touchdowns for this spot? In beating John Jay-Cross River 56-15, Timm caught 12 balls for 241 yards and a touchdown, returned the opening kickoff 95 yards to the end zone, and picked off a pass. Rino Tamburri, Marlboro: The running back ran for 223 yards and four touchdowns, made 10 tackles and recovered two fumbles in blanking Wallkill. Camron Abalos, Spackenkill: In beating Red Hook, the quarterback threw five passes that were caught in the end zone, threw for 215 yards, ran for 138 and returned a punt for a score. \nSolve the following equation and show all work: \nAssigned multiplier (W% + OW% - OL%) = X \nIf that looks more complicated than some of the problems you remember from 11th grade math class, that's because it probably is. \nBut it’s essentially what the Section 1 high school football committee worked out Sunday morning when it convened to determine the seeding for this week's qualifying round. \nThe points system, which Section 1 has employed for its playoffs, was a cause of consternation for some time. It was adjusted last spring to greater factor in strength of schedule and to create the upcoming 16-team quasi-bracket that will eventually decide the eight teams that advance to the sectional playoffs. \nThe result: Mixed opinions and a bit more consternation. \nFor instance, Arlington coach Dominick DeMatteo entered Sunday believing his team, by his calculations with the formula, should have been no lower than a sixth seed in Class AA. The Admirals (3-3) ended up being slotted eighth and will host No. 9 Roy C. Ketcham on Friday. \n\"I don't know; I don't have an answer,\" DeMatteo said Sunday, shortly after the seeding was released. \nIn simple terms, the new formula goes something like this: Take a team's winning percentage, add the winning percentages of the teams it beat and subtract the losing percentages of the teams it lost to. Then, once you've found that sum, multiply that by the “multiplier” number assigned to your team before the season based on its preseason ranking. (Still following?) \nJohn Jay, for example, as the defending champion and preseason No. 1 seed, had the league's toughest schedule. With that came the highest multiplier figure of 14.5. And down the line it goes. The multiplier was implemented to add more value to the strength of schedule, weighing it heavily against the win-loss record to almost assure the top preseason seeds, barring a collapse, would earn the top slots in the qualifier. Football: John Jay win was worth the wait \nArlington was seeded second in the preseason poll and two of its losses came to New Rochelle and John Jay, the respective No. 1 and 2 seeds entering the qualifier. \n\"It appears the multiplier was either tweaked or not used at all,\" DeMatteo said. \"We're trying to figure it out.\" \nThe Admirals were jumped by teams like Carmel and Clarkstown South. Both are 5-1 but didn't play as challenging a schedule. \n\"We're not where we thought we would be and I'm sure a few other teams aren't either,\" DeMatteo said. \"But it is what it is and we have to move forward.\" Spackenkill's Dhyquem Lewinson breaks away from Red Hook's Nick Mchitsch during Friday's game in Poughkeepsie.

Or a misunderstanding of the multipliers on the part of the coaches. Or a misunderstanding of the formula altogether. Whatever the case, Section 1 will have some explaining to do this week. \nSeveral coaches also said it would have made sense to have a centralized posting, or for the section to provide regular updates of the seeds to keep teams abreast of their standing throughout the season and to avoid potential surprises. \nOur Lady of Lourdes coach Brian Walsh said he wasn't in favor of the system at all. \n\"It doesn't need to be this complicated with the whole points system,\" he said. Lourdes, in its first season in Class A, secured the third seed and hosts No. 14 Pearl River. Nevertheless, Walsh said he would prefer \"a more common-sense type of approach\" to seeding. \nHe said the simplest solution would be a division of each class into two leagues and, based on an S-curve, having the top four teams in either make the playoffs. \"I don't think there should be 16 teams,” he said. “I'm all for the strongest teams being in the playoffs. You get ranked low in the preseason, play a weaker schedule and then you're in the playoffs?\" Spackenkill football on its big win & Abalos' huge performance Stephen Haynes/Poughkeepsie Journal \nHe has a point. That certainly would reduce some of the confusion and free Section 1 of some of the complaints it's sure to receive. And playoffs, traditionally, were designed to pit the elite against each other. Although, technically, this weekend's games are not considered \"playoffs\" because state rules won't allow a 16-team tournament. After this qualifying round, the remaining eight teams will be re-seeded for the official start of the sectional tournament. \nBut flaws, fuzzy math, controversy and all, what this round does add is a level of intrigue and excitement to Week Seven. October Madness! \nFriday's games will be the high school football equivalent of the first day of the NCAA basketball tournament. An oversized bracket removes the exclusivity of the postseason, but it does keep more teams and communities invested. \nTypically, you can start writing some teams off after the third game. But for one week at least, there can exist the hope of an upset leading to a miracle run. Don't tell that 14th seed they can't pull what the George Mason basketball team did in 2006. Not this week. \n\"I think the bigger pool helps grow the game,\" Ketcham coach Bryan Hogan said. \"One of the reasons they did this is because a lot of teams would be out of it early in the season and the kids wouldn't have much to play for down the stretch.\" \nNow almost every team can fancy itself Cinderella.
