The one thing they haven’t done in more than five seasons was the rival St. Xavier Bombers. \nOn Friday night, St. X senior Nick Arcuri kicked a go-ahead 52-yard field goal with six minutes remaining, and junior quarterback Sean Clifford passed for 141 yards and ran for a clinching TD as the Bombers ended La Salle’s 14-game winning streak with a 24-14 victory at St. Xavier Stadium. \nSt. Xavier, ranked No. 3 in the Enquirer Division I coaches’ poll and No. 9 in the state poll, was coming off a tough overtime loss to Elder. \nRelated: La Salle schedule, stats \n“I’m awful happy,” said Bombers coach Steve Specht. “I thought our defense was lights out in the second half. We got better offensively as the game went on.” \nLa Salle running back Jeremy Larkin was sensational again, rushing for 96 yards and a touchdown with a 23-yard TD reception.

Nobody’s going to feel sorry for us.” \nLa Salle ranked No. 1 in the Enquirer and state Division II polls, hadn’t defeated St. X since October 8, 2010 beginning a streak of five straight wins for the Bombers. \n“The rivalry means so much,” said Clifford. “For a Division II (team) they sure know how to play football. They’re still a GCL team.” \nFriday’s game was considered among the nation’s top prep football contests to watch according to MaxPreps.com. It didn’t disappoint. \nA 24-yard TD run on a jet sweep by Larkin put La Salle ahead 7-0 with 5:16 left in the first quarter. \nSt. X junior running back Quinn Earley tied the score 7-7 on a 39-yard TD run. Earley led the Bombers with 66 yards on seven carries on Friday. \nLa Salle unleashed its passing game late in the second quarter. \nThe Lancers got fortuitous bounce when a pass caromed off a receiver and into the hands of junior Ben Brabender for a 34-yard gain. \nDana Reeves’ 12-yard reception on fourth-and-11 set up Larkin’s 23-yard TD catch putting La Salle back in front, 14-7. \nBoth teams missed scoring chances late in the half. \nAn interception by Lancers safety Tre’Sean Smith stopped a St. X drive. \nChrisman missed a 27-yard field goal attempt for La Salle just before halftime. \nThe Bombers received the opening kickoff of the second half and marched 68 yards in 13 plays. Clifford scored on a 1-yard run to tie the score 14-14. \nA sack by Lancers linebacker Jerell White forced St. Xavier into a fourth-and-16 at the Lancers’ 35. \nWith the wind at his back, Arcuri, the grandson of legendary Bombers coach Steve Rasso, boomed it through the uprights, putting St. X ahead 17-14 with 6:24 remaining. \n“He came through tonight and I’m awful proud of him,” said Specht. “I came over to him on the sideline, put my arm around him, and said ‘Your grandpa’s smiling on you’.” \nLa Salle 7 7 0 0 - 14 \nSt. Xavier 0 7 7 10 - 24 \nLarkin 24 run (Chrisman kick) \nEarley 39 run (Maciag kick) \nLarkin 23 pass from Watson (Chrisman kick) \nConnor 1 run (Maciag kick) \nArcuri 52 FG \nClifford 17 run (Maciag kick) \nRecords: L 6-1 (1-1 GCL), X 5-2 (2-1 GCL).
