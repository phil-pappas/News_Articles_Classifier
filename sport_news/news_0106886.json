Mandatory Credit: Kim Klement-USA TODAY Sports (Kim Klement) Comments \nThe New York Daily News reported Sunday that Yankees ' slugger and designated hitter Alex Rodriguez will spend time on television as an analyst for FOX throughout the remainder of the 2015 postseason, starting with Game 3 of the American League Championship Series between the Toronto Blue Jays and Kansas City Royals on Monday night. \nThe report says Rodriguez will stay on through the World Series, possibly offering thoughts on the crosstown Mets if they're able to knock off the Chicago Cubs in the NLCS. ( They're up, 1-0 .) \nA-Rod will make his debut in FOX's baseball studio, the report said, and work Monday's pre-game show. PLUS : Can you believe A-Rod is just 27 home runs shy of Babe Ruth's record? \nThe News notes that A-Rod will be joining Pete Rose, who was hired by Fox earlier this season, in the studio. Rose was banned from baseball over 20 years ago for his link to betting on baseball. \n\"Now Rose, banned from the game for gambling, and Rodriguez, the steroids tainted slugger who served a season-long suspension for his role in the Biogenesis scandal, will join forces in a postseason gabfest,\" the News wrote. \nRodriguez, of course, was suspended for the entire 2014 season due to his link to performance-enhancing drugs. A-Rod hit 33 home runs this season en route to passing Willie Mays for fourth all-time in baseball history. He now stands just 27 shy of Babe Ruth's home run record of 714. (Ruth is third all-time behind Barry Bonds and Hank Aaron.) \nA-Rod apparently hung with the football guys on Sunday: . @AROD over-throws @JayGlazer & breaks a monitor! What a first day at FOX! http://t.co/h3kvSVTUan — FOX Sports (@FOXSports) October 18, 2015 \nA source told the News there didn't appear to be a lot of drama around Rodriguez this summer—all things considered, perhaps—and it went a long way into the hiring. \nA-Rod loves baseball, loves talking baseball. Maybe it's a perfect fit. Ryan Hatch may be reached at rhatch@njadvancemedia.com . Follow him on Twitter @ryanhatch .
