Sources said the 1986-batch officer would find place in the CMO headed by Sanjeev Kaushal,Principal Secretary. The CMO has Special Additional PSCM Rajesh Khullar as also APSCM Rakesh Gupta. However, it remains to be seen where Sibal will be accommodated since she is senior to Kaushal. Sibal is known for her stand in the JBT recruitment scam in which former Chief Minister Om Prakash Chautala, his son Ajay Chautala and his aides are presently serving jail term. Sibal had refused to manipulate interview scores in the recruitment of 3,200 teachers made in 1999 at the behest of politicians. Subsequently, she was transferred from the Department of Elementary Education. However, before leaving, she ordered thick cotton bandages and sealed the steel cupboard and got five of her officers to sign on these at different places. She took the keys and hid these, making it impossible for the list to be tampered with. Later, she became a witness in the JBT scam, which was probed by the CBI. Sources said the idea to get her back to the state was in keeping with the government’s much-professed campaign to weed out corruption.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T02:19:36.357+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
