Photograph: Lee Smith/Action Images via Reuters \nM anchester United battled back after conceding a fourth-minute goal to grind out a hard-fought 2-1 victory over VfL Wolfsburg at Old Trafford on Wednesday, the English side's first Champions League win of the season. \nThere was huge pressure on United after they lost to PSV Eindhoven in their opening Group B match two weeks ago and their night got off to the worst start when Daniel Caligiuri opened the scoring for the well-drilled visitors after some poor defending. \nUnited, who came from behind to beat Wolfsburg 2-1 exactly six years ago to the day, followed the same script with Juan Mata equalising with a 34th-minute penalty, while defender Chris Smalling proved to be the unlikely match-winner when he slid in to score his first goal of the season after 53 minutes. \nWith CSKA Moscow beating PSV Eindhoven 3-2 in Russia, the four teams are all level after two matches. CSKA Moscow host United and Wolfsburg are at home to PSV in Matchday Three on Oct.21. \nUnited started the match buoyed by going top of the Premier League at the weekend, but they were reeling after Wolfsburg struck to take the lead after a six-pass move. \nUnited were guilty of woeful defending as Antonio Valencia played Caligiuri onside and he picked his spot to beat David De Gea. \nWayne Rooney should have equalised for United after 26 minutes after fine work down the right from Anthony Martial, but the United skipper, who had a poor game in attack, blasted the ball high and wide when it looked easier to find the net. \nThey drew level when Mata sent goalkeeper Diego Benaglio the wrong way with his penalty after Hungarian referee Viktor Kassai ruled scorer Caligiuri handled in the box. \nMata was instrumental in setting up United's second goal as well, providing the final pass with a creative, backheeled flick that allowed Smalling to slide home his first goal of the season after 53 minutes. \nAguero's last gasp penalty earns win for City at Gladbach IMAGE: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero (2nd from right) celebrates after scoring a penalty against Borussia Moenchengladbach during their Champions League Group D match in Moenchengladbach, Germany, on Wednesday. Photograph: Wolfgang Rattay/Reuters \nS ergio Aguero scored a last minute penalty to give Manchester City a 2-1 comeback win at Borussia Moenchengladbach in the Champions League on Wednesday and their first three points in Group D. \nGladbach, having waited 37 years for their first home game in Europe's premier club competition, stunned their big-name opponents with a 54th minute goal by Lars Stindl. \nCity, who have goalkeeper Joe Hart to thank for keeping them in the game with half a dozen superb saves, drew level with Nicolas Otamendi's deflected effort in the 65th before launching a late rally in search of a winner and with Argentine striker Aguero scoring from the spot. \nThe result sees City move up to three points with Gladbach still to earn any in Group D. \nBenfica battle back to claim 2-1 win at Atletico \nB enfica seized control of Champions League Group C when they fought back from a goal down to secure an impressive 2-1 win at 2014 runners-up Atletico Madrid on Wednesday. \nAngel Correa fired Atletico ahead in the 23rd minute at the Calderon when Antoine Griezmann cushioned a delightful pass into his path and he cracked the ball past Julio Cesar from close range. \nNicolas Gaitan levelled for the visitors in the 36th minute, smashing a first-time shot through a crowd of players, and teenager Goncalo Guedes made it 2-1 six minutes into the second half when he converted a Gaitan cross at the far post. \nThey were the first goals Atletico had conceded at the Calderon in Europe’s elite club competition in more than 700 minutes and prevented them from setting a Champions League record of eight consecutive home clean sheets. \nDiego Simeone's side have won 21 of their last 25 European matches at home and it was their first defeat since a 2-0 reverse to Rubin Kazan in the Europa League last 32 in 2013. \nWith two matches played, Benfica top the section with a maximum six points, with Atletico in second place on three. Astana and Galatasaray each have one point after they drew 2-2 in Kazakhstan earlier on Wednesday. \nThe game in the Spanish capital, the first competitive meeting between the sides, was marred by Benfica fans throwing flares towards the Atletico supporters after Gaitan’s equaliser.
