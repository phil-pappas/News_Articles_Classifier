That's the key piece to it,” said Jets head coach Paul Maurice, who bit his tongue and didn't criticize the officials. “(Playing) On back-to-back nights where we have a run of penalties, we didn't lose our focus. We got the kill and got stronger and then got a real nice payoff on it, for doing the right things.”\nThe Jets aren't about to let this strong start fool them, there's no time to put their collective feet on the desk and get fat reading their press clippings.\n“We weren’t happy with (Monday's 4-2 loss to the Islanders) but it’s (about) how you respond,” said Jets defenceman Mark Stuart. “That’s a great way to respond. We can go home feeling good about that, but it’s a long road ahead.”\nIt most certainly is, but with six games on home ice upcoming, the Jets have already put themselves in a much better position than they did 12 months ago when they stumbled out of the gate with a 1-start and were searching for answers before committing to the style of play that eventually got them into the Stanley Cup tournament.\nken.wiebe@sunmedia.ca\nTwitter.com/WiebeSunSports\nJets fly out of the gate Plenty of impressive things, still work to do\nBy Ken Wiebe , Winnipeg Sun First posted: Wednesday, October 14, 2015 01:05 PM EDT | Updated: Wednesday, October 14, 2015 08:49 PM EDT\nBetter than expected, yet ample room for improvement.\nThose are my prevailing thoughts after watching the Winnipeg Jets win three of four games on the road to start a new season.\nAs is often the case at this point of a fresh campaign, there are issues to be sorted out for every team around the NHL and the Jets are no different.\nWhen you earn road wins over the Boston Bruins, New Jersey Devils and New York Rangers and the lone loss comes against the New York Islanders, you won't hear a lot of complaints from either the Jets' players or members of the coaching staff – though they weren't blind to the warts either.\n“We’ve just got to keep building,” said Jets captain Andrew Ladd. “In this league you take the points when you can get them.”\nLadd couldn't be more right.\n Hockey Babcock\n'Personal reasons'?
