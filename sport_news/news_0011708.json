(SOUNDBITE) (English) CHELSEA MANAGER JOSE MOURINHO, SAYING: \"I'm happy that I don't have an electronic tag, I think it's not far from (it) but I'm happy that I don't have an electronic tag. I also think that 50,000 pounds in the world where we live today is an absolute disgrace, an absolute disgrace.\" 2. (SOUNDBITE) (English) CHELSEA MANAGER JOSE MOURINHO, SAYING: \"It's difficult to say, but if for example now you ask me how many years I'm going still to coach, I would risk 15 more, I'm in the middle, I did 15 and I have 15 more to do, finish with 67, I think so. Maybe later if I can, but I would say normally 15 more years. Can I stay 15 more years at Chelsea football club? I don't think so, I don't think modern football allows it anymore so normally I will not finish my career at Chelsea, I would like to, but I don't think it's possible.\" STORY: Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho described his Football Association fine as a \"disgrace\" on Thursday (October 15) and branded his suspended one-match stadium ban \"astonishing\" after his comments about referees. Mourinho was fined 50,000 pounds ($77,425) and threatened with a future stadium ban on Wednesday (October 14) for saying referees were afraid to award penalties to the Premier League champions after Chelsea's 3-1 home defeat by Southampton on Oct. 3. \"I'm happy that I don't have an electronic tag, I think it's not far from (it) but I'm happy that I don't have an electronic tag. I also think that 50,000 pounds in the world where we live today is an absolute disgrace, an absolute disgrace,\" he said at a news conference for a book launch. The FA said the stadium ban would be invoked should Mourinho commit a similar offence in the next 12 months. Mourinho said he would like to continue coaching for another 15 years at least, but voiced pessimism over his chances of continuing the rest of his career at Chelsea. \"It's difficult to say, but if for example now you ask me how many years I'm going still to coach, I would risk 15 more, I'm in the middle, I did 15 and I have 15 more to do, finish with 67, I think so. Maybe later if I can, but I would say normally 15 more years. Can I stay 15 more years at Chelsea football club? I don't think so, I don't think modern football allows it anymore so normally I will not finish my career at Chelsea, I would like to, but I don't think it's possible,\" he said. Chelsea, whose poor start to the season has left them languishing in 16th place after eight games, 10 points adrift of leaders Manchester City, will host Aston Villa on Saturday (October 17).
