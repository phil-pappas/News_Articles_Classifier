But it sure didn’t take him long to get introduced to Phillipsburg High School football. \n“I was born during football season,” Melise said. “I was born on a Wednesday, came home Thursday night, and went to my first game that Friday night. My aunts were cheerleaders and my uncle (the late Robert Lurig) played for P’burg. I feel that might have had a little something to do with my love for the sport.” \nLurig, who Melise was named after, tragically died in a car accident at the age of 16 in 1998. Robert Melise (lehighvalleylive.com file photo) \nMelise began playing football at an early age and today is a junior two-way lineman for the Stateliners. He contributed two sacks and a fumble recovery in P’burg’s last game, a 28-21 win over Hillsborough . \n“Personally I’m very happy with the way I’ve played (on defense),” Melise said. “I’m just trying to keep it up, trying to be the destructive player that I am. I want to give the guys something to feed off of. If you get the energy going, you can definitely keep the ball rolling.” \n“(Melise) has a tremendous motor on the defensive line,” P’burg coach Ryan Ditze said. “He’s strong, understands the concept, and asks good questions. He’s very, very talented.” \nMelise is quick to admit that his defense is ahead of his offense at this point. \nRELATED : P'burg lineman Robert Melise was a terror on both sides of the ball \n“I’m still fighting for a spot on the offensive line right now,” said Melise, who’s been rotating in and out. There are kids who are pushing me all the time. There are a couple guys who could take my spot in a minute.” \nAlthough Melise is starting to make his mark in football, his most effective sport might be wrestling. He took the NJSIAA by storm last season by going 30-5 in the 220-pound weight class and finishing fifth in the state tournament in Atlantic City. \nMelise already has received several offers to wrestle in college, but says he doesn’t favor one sport over the other. \n“Honestly, I don’t really have a No. 1 sport,” he said. “I play them because I love them both.” \nSurprisingly, Melise considered giving up wrestling when he was in sixth and seventh grade. Melise credits Eric Monk and Tim Longacre, two of his youth coaches, for inspiring him to stick it out. \n“I always looked at football as my first love back then,” Melise said. “Confidence-wise, I always thought I was better in football than wrestling. But they (Monk and Longacre) knew I could be a really good wrestler. They saw it and they taught me confidence. By my eighth grade year I started to take wrestling serious.” \nMelise singled out senior Kyle Nothnagel as one of several teammates who have pushed him in the wrestling room. \n“The kids in the room really helped me out,” he said. “I’ve really had a lot of wrestling support.” \nMelise feels the technical points of wrestling help him in football, and vice versa. \n“Wrestling taught me agility for football,” he said, “and football gives me power and strength for wrestling. There are aspects from each sport that carry over to the other.” \nMelise is leaning on P’burg offensive line coach Mark Bigelli for direction on that side of the football. \n“The last game I was really flat on offense,” Melise said. “I have a lot to work on, definitely. Coach Bigelli is tough on us, and that’s a good thing because he sees we have talent. He sees what we can be like and he tries to get it out of us.” \nPaying attention to detail in the film room helps Melise work out his flaws. \n“I’ll see what I did wrong and work on that,” he said. “I look at everybody else, too. I see what everybody’s strengths and weaknesses are and learn from it.” \nMelise is uncertain what sport he’ll play in college. But academics ultimately will be his No. 1 priority. \n“I don’t know exactly,” he said. “I don’t like to speculate. But I want to go to a good academic school because you’re not going to play sports all your life.” \nFor now, wrestling and football are Melise’s passion, and he vows to get the most out of both during his remaining time as a Stateliner.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T21:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T02:38:33.577+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
