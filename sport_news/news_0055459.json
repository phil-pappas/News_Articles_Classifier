Spiller with a short pass that the running back turned into an 80-yard touchdown — the 400th of the Saints quarterback's career — on the second play of overtime, and New Orleans won for the first time this season, 26-20 over the injury-decimated Cowboys on Sunday night.\nBrees, who missed New Orleans' previous game because of a bruised rotator cuff in his right (throwing) shoulder, completed 32 of 39 throws for 279 yards in his return.\nMark Ingram gained 126 yards from scrimmage on a combination of runs and short passes, and Khiry Robinson had a 1-yard touchdown run for New Orleans (1-3).\nJoseph Randle scored the lone TD for Dallas (2-2) on a 1-yard run in the first half. The winning score enlivened a Superdome crowd stunned by Saints kicker Zach Hocker's 30-yard miss in the final seconds of regulation.\nBRONCOS 23, VIKINGS 20\nDENVER — Brandon McManus kicked a 39-yard field goal with 1:51 left and Denver had seven sacks in the Broncos' win over Minnesota.\nVon Miller smothered the loose ball after T.J. Ward's sack-strip of Teddy Bridgewater in the closing seconds, sealing the win for the unbeaten Broncos (4-0), who got a 72-yard touchdown run from Ronnie Hillman.\nPeyton Manning has led his teams to a 4-0 start seven times, most in NFL history by a long shot. Next up at four is Fran Tarkenton. Manning also joined Brett Favre as the only QBs to win 100 home starts in the NFL.\nIt wasn't a great day for Manning, who was picked off twice by the Vikings (2-2).\nRAMS 24, CARDINALS 22\nGLENDALE, Ariz. — Todd Gurley was a second-half sensation and sure looked as though he justified being the No. 10 pick in the NFL draft.\nThe St. Louis rookie rushed for all but five of 146 yards after halftime and the Rams held on to hand the Arizona Cardinals their first loss of the season.\nGurley saw his most extensive action as a pro and his 52-yard run set up what was the winning touchdown.\nNick Foles threw for three TDs, two after Arizona turnovers, and St. Louis' defense held the Cardinals (3-1) to field goals on four of five trips inside the red zone.\nPACKERS 17, 49ERS 3\nSANTA CLARA, Calif. — Aaron Rodgers passed for 224 yards and a touchdown, ran 17 yards to set up a key second-half score, and the Green Bay Packers beat the hapless San Francisco 49ers for their first 4-0 start in four years.\nRichard Rodgers caught a 9-yard touchdown pass on the game's opening drive before Rodgers got his team going in the second half after a slow start to snap a four-game losing streak to San Francisco, which included a pair of playoff defeats.\nClay Matthews added his own flair to this one. When he sacked Colin Kaepernick in the third quarter, he kissed his right biceps Kaepernick-style to punctuate the play — one of Green Bay's six sacks.\nFALCONS 48, TEXANS 21\nATLANTA — Devonta Freeman scored three touchdowns and the Atlanta Falcons remained unbeaten, romping to a 27-point victory over the hapless Houston Texans.\nFreeman, who took over as the starting running back after rookie Tevin Coleman sustained a rib injury in Week 2, has scored six TDs in the last two games. The Falcons improved to 4-0 for only the fourth time in club history.\nFreeman had touchdown runs of 16, 23 and 6 yards. He set up another score with a 44-yard reception.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T11:21:07.788+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
