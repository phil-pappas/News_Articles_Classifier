Modi said: “Sonia Gandhi and Nitish Kumar have so far remained quiet over the issue, while Lalu Prasad is adamant over his stand that Hindus eat beef. But if the NDA comes to power, it would ban cow slaughtering in the state.” Meanwhile, advocate Sudhir Ojha today lodged a complaint in the court of chief judicial magistrate (CJM) Sushma Trivedi at Muzaffarpur against RJD supremo Lalu Prasad. In his complaint, Ojha said Lalu deliberately delivered a hate speech on beef eating that disheartened Hindu’s sentiments and tried to spread communal tension only to woo voters for the elections. Ojha said: “CJM Trivedi transferred the case lodged against Lalu Prasad in the court of additional chief judicial magistrate (ACJM) Ram Chandra Prasad, who taking cognizance in the case put his final hearing for October 7.” Lalu had said, “Poor people eat meat to beat their hunger… Those who go outside (the country) eat beef. Even Hindus eat beef. There is no difference between beef and goat meat…” After he was verbally assaulted by NDA leaders, Lalu took a turn on his statement and said he was talking of meat and not beef. The BJP has been critical of the grand alliance after Lalu’s controversial remark and his accusations against the BJP and its ideological mentor, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) of communalising the Dadri issue. BJP leader Sushma Swaraj while addressing a rally in Samastipur said allies of its grand alliance (JD-U, RJD and Congress) are united under compulsion, but they differ in their ideologies. Lalu calls PM Dhritarashtra for staying mum RJD chief Lalu Prasad on Monday took potshots at PM Narendra Modi calling him Dhritarashtra, who is not only “blind” but also a “coward,” as the chorus of criticism against the Prime Minister’s “silence” on Dadri lynching grew louder Against the backdrop of Modi not having made a statement yet over the horrific lynching of a man in Dadri in Uttar Pradesh over rumours of alleged beef consumption, Lalu said he (Modi) observed silence when there was a need to speak “Ye Dhritarashtra andar se darpok hai. Dikhawe ka chilata hai. Jab bolne ki zaroorat hoti hai to maun dharan kar chhup ke baith jata hai (This Dhritarshtra is a coward. He shouts only to show off. When there is a need to speak, he observes silence and hides somewhere),” Lalu said. — PTI (With agency inputs)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T02:01:40.263+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
