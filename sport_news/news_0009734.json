After a delay of 2 minutes, 32 seconds, the play stood and fans continued to throw objects on the field.\nToronto Mayor John Tory tweeted, \"Don't hurt each other or our city over this. We can prove ourselves in more ways than one. #ComeTogether\"\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
