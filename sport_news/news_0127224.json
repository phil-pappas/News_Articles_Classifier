Army entered averaging 287.8 yards rushing per game, 5.6 per carry. \nQB Thomas Sirk threw for 197 yards and one touchdown and Jela Duncan and Parker Boehme each scored twice as Duke (5-1) boosted its record to 11-1 in its last 12 road games. The Blue Devils are 5-1 in consecutive years for the first time since 1952-53. \nArmy gave away the ball twice on consecutive possessions in the first half and trailed, 27-0, at halftime, never crossing midfield. The Army blunders came in a span of just over six minutes spanning the first and second quarters. \n\"As agonizing as it is to lose, there's no time to feel sorry for yourself and sulk,\" Army coach Jeff Monken said. \"You've got to move on.\" \nCOLUMBIA 26, WAGNER 3 (at New York) — Cameron Molina ran for a touchdown and Max Keefe scored on a fumble return 16 seconds apart early in the first quarter as Columbia ended it 24-game losing streak. The Lions (1-3), who hadn't won since beating Cornell, 34-17, on Nov. 10, 2012, rolled to a 26-0 lead early in the second half in their first home game under the lights in 11 years. \nMolina capped a 15-play, 66-yard drive with a 6-yard run at 9:47. Wager (0-5) bobbled the snap on its next play and Keefe scooped up the bouncing ball at the 2 and stepped into the end zone.

Syracuse (3-2) lost for the second straight time after matching last year's win total in the first three weeks of this season. \nFORDHAM 48, PENN 45 (at Philadelphia) — Chase Edmonds rushed for 230 yards and scored four TDs but it was Makay Redd's 31-yard field goal with eight seconds left that lifted Fordham. \nPenn (1-4) tied it with 1:46 to play. But Kevin Anderson, who completed 29 of 36 passes for a career-high 377 yards and two touchdowns, took the Rams 51 yards in nine plays to set out the win.

The Eagles (3-3, 0-3) have lost three straight. © 2015 North Jersey Media Group Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T08:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T18:23:36.498+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
