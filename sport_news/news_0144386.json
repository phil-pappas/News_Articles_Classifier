Conestoga slipped to 3-3 and 2-2. \nDown the stretch, the Pioneers threatened to pull off the comeback. But a holding penalty negated Tim Miller's 21-yard TD pass with a little over a minute remaining. And on fourth down from the Upper Darby 37, Tyler George's sack of Miller forced a fumble that lineman Malakhi Maddox recovered at the 48. \nFor Conestoga, Corey Manning, who also has a bruising running style, carried 28 times for 200 yards and a pair of scores. \nRoyals quarterback Christoff Minott threw for 212 yards and two TDs. Late in the second quarter, his 75-yard connection with wideout Brandon Morton made it 19-On the second play after intermission, Manning found a seam and dashed 58 yards to cut Upper Darby's lead to 19-7. \nAfter the Pioneers' defense forced a three-and-out on the ensuing series, Manning rumbled 43 yards to the Royals' 16. Five plays later, Miller connected with Pete Jean for a 7-yard TD. \nUpper Darby's botched center snap on a punt attempt then gave Conestoga the ball 11 yards from pay dirt. After a pass-interference call against the hosts, Manning went five yards to give the Pioneers a 22-19 advantage. \nConestoga 0 0 22 0 - 22 \nUpper Darby 6 13 6 0 - 25 \nUD: Isaiah Bruce 39 run (kick failed) \nUD: Brandon Morton 75 pass from Christoff Minott (Derrick Korboi kick) \nUD: Bruce 57 pass from Minott (kick failed) \nC: Corey Manning 58 run (Christopher Smith kick) \nC: Peter Jean 7 pass from Tim Miller (Smith kick) \nC: Manning 6 run (Jean pass from Miller) \nUD: Bruce 68 run (kick blocked)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T06:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T07:08:04.898+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
