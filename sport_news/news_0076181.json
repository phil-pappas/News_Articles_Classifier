But Lunt and the Illini offense struggled to get much going as Illinois lost 24-13 to Wisconsin in front of a homecoming crowd of 45,438 Saturday at Memorial Stadium. “He’s got to be great every single game,” Illinois coach Bill Cubit said of Lunt. “Today was probably the most pressure he’s faced, but he’s handling it great.” The Rochester High School graduate managed what he could, completing 22 of 43 passes for 278 yards. Senior wideout Geronimo Allison, the team’s receiving leader, once again led the Illini with eight catches for 99 yards but dropped a few passes on key first-down situations. Even still, the Illini (4-3, 1-2 Big Ten) kept within striking range, trailing 17-13 in the fourth quarter before the Badgers (5-2, 3-1) engineered a quick, 86-yard scoring drive that gave them a two-possession lead. Comeback chances were muted on the next drive when the Badgers picked off Lunt, snapping his streak of 190 passes without an interception. “I feel like we kind of let this one slip away,” Allison said. “I feel like we have to watch film, learn from our mistakes, and just move on and not dwell on it.” Backup leads Badgers Wisconsin, too, faced similar pressure at the quarterback position but for much different reasons. After Badgers starter Joel Stave was knocked out of the game with a head injury late in the first quarter, junior Bart Houston entered the game and to manage a balanced offensive attack with multiple drives of 60-plus yards. Houston, who entered Saturday with a career-high four completions in a game, completed 22-of-33 passes for 232 yards with a pair of touchdowns and interceptions. “It didn’t seem too big for him,” Wisconsin coach Paul Chryst said. “I thought he competed. I thought he stood in there. He made some throws, and that was good.” The Illini defense held up its end of the bargain, especially in the early in the game. On its first two drives, Wisconsin netted minus 23 yards in a sequence capped with back-to-back sacks by defensive end Carroll Phillips. Senior safety Clayton Fejedelem also recorded a career-high 19 tackles and recorded his second interception in three games. “Bottom line, we’ve got to come out and win,” co-defensive coordinator Mike Phair said. “There are some good things that you see happen, but we’ve got to come out and win games like that.” Page 2 of 2 - The Illini could their offense limited further without tight end Tyler White, who left the game in third quarter with an undisclosed injury that “doesn’t look good,” according to Cubit. Illinois dropped its sixth straight game to Wisconsin and has now lost 10 of the last 11 matchups. “We didn’t make the plays — they did, we didn’t,” Cubit said. “We weren’t good enough today.” — Jordan Wilson can be reached at wilsn07@yahoo.com.
