The Blues are seven points adrift and 10 behind leaders Manchester City. \n\"Somebody will be out [of the top four]. Do I think it's Chelsea? No,\" Mourinho said. \nMourinho says he brought up the prospect of his sacking - he broached it in a seven-minute monologue in a live interview on Sky Sports - in anticipation of the question coming. The club's statement was issued two days later. \n\"For me the important thing is the owner and the board's message to myself,\" Mourinho said. \n\"Before the statement came out, I was having the feedback from the owner and the board. So the statement was not something new for me. I met the owner before dinner so, when I went to dinner, I knew. \n\"But even before that, I knew what brought me here. I know the conversation we had two years ago. I know what made me sign a new contract, and the reasons why the owner and the board decided to give me a new contract. \n\"They didn't have to. I had still two more years, so they didn't have to give me a new contract. After a bad result - which is not the first bad result of the season, it's one more bad result - obviously I was not happy, far from it. But I never thought about that (being sacked).\" Promoted Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T07:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T11:28:53.967+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
