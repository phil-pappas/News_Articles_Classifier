Then, Shreyas Iyer and Tare scored big hundreds to ensure Mumbai didn't have to bat again. Later, part-time spinner (he doesn't like to be called that!) Akhil Herwadkar picked up a career-best haul to give Mumbai an outright win.\nIt wasn't a surprise then, that Tare harped on the fact that a win was that much special when at least six seven members of the team performed in it. \"You need 7 or 8 guys out of 11 to perform and help the team win. So, I'm very happy that they have chipped in with their efforts. Winning is important to make the dressing room happy and we're upbeat about it,\" Tare said on the eve of Mumbai's match against Tamil Nadu.\nBut the skipper strictly maintained that playing a new match brings a new challenge. And the game against Tamil Nadu would be no different.\n\"For me, every game is important and every opponent is good. We want to concentrate on our own game and how well we play. That's the ultimate thing for me,\" he said.\nAsked if there were any concerns despite the outright win over a formidable Punjab team, he said: \"It is too early to judge a team. For me, how our boys play and how they can perform consistently is important. How they better themselves is what concerns me. It's a long season and you can't judge a team on one or two matches. We still have big challenges ahead, and the boys are working hard to meet them.\"\nTare, who marshaled his resources extremely well against Punjab, and is now up against a side which has quality players, felt that no team in the Ranji Trophy could be taken lightly. \"I don't rate any team big or small in this tournament. One cannot take any game lightly. My boys thrive on big opposition and big challenges. The younger guys love taking on opponents,\" he said, while elaborating on taking on reputed sides early on in the season.\nOn his part, Tamil Nadu skipper Abhinav Mukund said: \"We have had a good start to the season. We had some good contributions in the team. We have had two good wins, a good lead against MP and a good win against Baroda. So, we have momentum.\"\nSpeaking about danger man Murali Vijay, who is back in the team after a two-month hiatus, Mukund said: \"He always looks to contribute as much as he can while playing for TN. I think he is a big plus for us. I enjoy batting with him and his experience will definitely come handy for us.\" Stay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device.", "external_links": ["https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.toi.reader.activities"], "published": "2015-10-15T18:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T11:08:43.328+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
