Employed as a pinch hitter in Game 1 of the NLDS, Soler drew a walk.\nGetting the start in Game 2 and batting second, Soler was 2-for-2 with a 2-run homer and 2 walks. In Game 3, he was 2-for-2 with another 2-run shot and 2 more walks.\nThe streak ended in Soler's first at-bat in Game 4 when he struck out swinging.\nSoler has immense power, so the 2 home runs in the NLDS are no surprise.\nThe 6 walks in 13 trips to the plate are a huge surprise. During the regular season, Soler drew only 32 walks in 404 plate appearances.\n\"I've got tremendous confidence right now,\" Soler said through a translator. \"I'm seeing the ball really well, and I'm just trying to get on base and help our team win.\"\nLike most young power hitters, Soler was guilty of chasing bad pitches and taking big swings. He picked the perfect time to make an adjustment.\n\"That's what happens with hitters,\" manager Joe Maddon said. \"If they're going through a bad moment, they want to chase things. They want to study more video or they want to do something differently, but it pretty much comes down to stop swinging at balls, organize your strike zone.\n\"Once you organize your strike zone and you accept walks, then at that point you should be able to hit pretty close to your potential.\"\n• Follow Scot's reports throughout the playoffs @scotgregor.\nGet great articles like this sent to your inbox!
