(AP Photo/Patrick Semansky) Sponsored Links The Associated Press BALTIMORE â€” \nThe Toronto Blue Jays yelled, hugged and jumped for joy around the mound after clinching their first AL East title in 22 years. \nTwo months earlier, such a celebration was almost impossible to imagine. Yet, with their 15-2 rout of Baltimore on Wednesday, the Blue Jays brought an appropriate conclusion to their unstoppable, late-season run. \nToronto entered the doubleheader needing only one victory to eliminate the New York Yankees and claim its first title since 1993. The suspense ended quickly as the Blue Jays built a 4-0 lead in the fourth inning before adding four unearned runs in the fifth. \nThe remaining innings were a mere prelude to a celebration more than two decades in the making. There were several hundred blue-clad Toronto fans in the small crowd that gathered for the makeup of a game washed out by rain on Tuesday. \n\"You're on the road, but it felt like a home game,\" said Marcus Stroman, who pitched eight strong innings. \"I thought the majority of the stadium was Blue Jays fans. So that just goes to show how excited people are to take the trip down from the North to see us clinch. It's been special.\" \nBecause there was a second game to be played, the Blue Jays opted to put off the champagne celebration until after the nightcap. After waiting this long to toast a division title, a few hours probably wasn't going to make much of a difference. \n\"Everyone is elated,\" Stroman said. \"Everyone is ecstatic and happy. But we have 30 minutes in between games so we have to lock it back in quickly. I am sure there will be a celebration postgame.\" \nStroman (4-0) allowed one run and five hits with eight strikeouts in his fourth start since returning from left knee surgery. \nJose Bautista hit his 40th home run, Edwin Encarnacion delivered No. 37 and Justin Smoak also connected for Toronto. Ryan Goins had a career-high five hits to help the Blue Jays win their sixth straight. \nToronto was fourth in the AL East on the morning of July 29 with a 50-51 record, eight games behind the Yankees. But boosted by the acquisitions of David Price, Troy Tulowitzki, Ben Revere, LaTroy Hawkins and Mark Lowe, the Blue Jays won 42 of their next 56 games, outscoring opponents 342-200. They ended the major leagues' longest playoff drought on Sept. 26 when they clinched no worse than a wild-card berth. \nGeneral manager Alex Anthopoulos insists that in late July, the goal was merely to reach the playoffs. \n\"We felt we had a real good team that underachieved to this point,\" Anthopoulos said outside the Toronto clubhouse. \"We knew we were playing New York a lot. We were playing the Twins. We were playing the Rangers. We were playing the Orioles. \n\"So, our last two months, we were playing really good teams that we were going to chase. So, we thought we had a shot. There is no doubt about it. If we didn't play New York as many times, maybe things wouldn't have been the same.\" \nStroman's exceptional pitching this month added to the surge. The right-hander has a 1.67 ERA and has beaten the Yankees twice. \nIn their first postseason appearance since Joe Carter's World Series-winning homer sealed their second straight title, the Blue Jays open the AL Division Series at home on Oct. 8. They are just ahead of defending Kansas City for best record in the AL, which would bring a matchup against the wild-card winner. \nA year ago, Baltimore celebrated its first AL East title since 1997. On Wednesday, the Orioles watched their successors end an even longer wait. \n\"Congratulations to them. They earned it,\" Baltimore manager Buck Showalter said. \"We had something that people came after, and they took it from us.\" \nThis was Baltimore's first game since being officially eliminated from playoff contention, and it showed. Seven pitchers combined to issue 10 walks and the Orioles committed four errors despite coming in with the best fielding percentage in the majors. \n\"We've got to be better than that. That was disappointing,\" Showalter said. \"In any form of life, when you take hope out of the picture it really challenges you mentally and emotionally. We didn't respond to that in the first game.\" \nAfter Miguel Gonzalez (9-12) walked three and gave up four runs in 3 2/3 innings, errant throws by pitcher Jason Garcia and first baseman Chris Davis on the same play fueled a fifth-inning uprising that turned the game into a rout. \nSteve Pearce homered in the seventh for Baltimore. The loss ended any hope the Orioles had of salvaging a winning season. \nTRAINER'S ROOM \nBlue Jays: Tulowitzki (back, shoulder) is rapidly mending and could return before the postseason, manager John Gibbons said. \nOrioles: CF Adam Jones remains sidelined with back problems. He's played in one game since Sept. 20. \nON DECK \nThursday's series finale was moved up to 12:05 p.m. from 7:05 because of the threat of rain. David Price (17-5, 2.34 ERA) pitches for Toronto and rookie Tyler Wilson (2-2, 3.60 ERA) is on the mound for Baltimore.
