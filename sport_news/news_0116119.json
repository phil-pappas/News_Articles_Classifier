(Brian Cassella / Chicago Tribune) Fred Mitchell Contact Reporter Lowry sets school record with 6 tackles for loss \nNorthwestern senior defensive end Dean Lowry has been named Big Ten Defensive Player of the Week and quarterback Clayton Thorson is the Big Ten Freshman of the Week. \nLowry set a school record with his six tackles for loss in Saturday’s 30-28 win at Nebraska that improved the Wildcats to 6-2 and made them bowl eligible. \nThe 6-foot-6, 290-pound Lowry totaled 10 tackles, including two sacks and a pass break-up. The six tackles for loss were the most by a Big Ten player in a single game since Purdue’s Rob Ninkovich had seven tackles for loss on Nov. 19, 2005. \nThorson had runs of 68 and 49 yards en route to a 126-yard rushing game that included a TD plunge. He passed for 177 yards and one TD. This is Thorson’s second career weekly honor from the Big Ten. \nNorthwestern, 2-2 in the conference, is off this weekend and will host Penn State on Nov. 7. \nfmitchell@tribpub.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T21:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T22:23:14.057+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
