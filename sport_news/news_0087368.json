He stated this while addressing a gathering during the Jal Prabhandhan Rally at the local ITI ground before inaugurating a power feeder project here today. “The BJP government is committed to resolve the decades old issue of shortage of drinking and irrigation water in the Ahirwal region. Hence, the first major project has been inaugurated to strengthen the lift irrigation system in Mahendragarh and Rewari districts. The project costing Rs143 crore will prove to be a lifeline for Southern Haryana on completion in two-and-a-half-years,” he added. Referring to the demands put up by the local legislator, the Chief Minister announced to get a bypass constructed on the eastern side of Narnaul town by requesting the National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) to make it a part of the national highway from Nangal Chaudhary to Hansi. He also announced a grant of Rs10 crore for repairing 15 roads, desilting of canals at a cost of Rs13 crore under the Prime Minister’s irrigation scheme and sanctioned Rs3.5 crore for 35 anganwari centres. Speaking on the occasion, Union Minister Rao Inderjit Singh urged the Chief Minister to get the Ravi-Beas water dispute resolved with the help of Prime Minister Narendra Modi so that Haryana could get its due share of water at the earliest. “Since you (Khattar) are a friend of the PM and the BJP coalition government is ruling in Punjab you should persuade Modi to talk to Chief Minister Prakash Singh Badal and get the matter resolved amicably,” he added. Significantly, Khattar did not say anything on the issue during his 44-minute speech in the rally.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T04:02:46.742+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
