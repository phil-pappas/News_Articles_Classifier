Alf (Langer) was just a boy that played all the backyard footy and had all these wonderful skills,” Bennett told Triple M radio. \n“Milford’s very much the same. Alf was a fun guy; Milford’s a fun guy. \n“If you get too serious with them, it doesn’t work for them. He’s a very genuine kid.” \nMilford and No.7 Ben Hunt have earned comparisons with Brisbane’s last great halves pairing of Langer and Kevin Walters – and Bennett didn’t exactly hose down the speculation. \n“They’re different players – I’m not saying they’re the same players when I make the comparison,” Bennett said. \n“What I’m saying is that they do play for each other. They’re very compatible, they’ve got a great deal of ability the pair of them – which Alfie and Kevin had – and they have a great combination with each other.” \nBennett is aiming for an unprecedented eighth premiership as coach, seven with Brisbane, and the first since his 2010 triumph with St George Illawarra. \nBut he was reluctant to take credit for his staggering resume. \nBennett said boasting a player roster of the likes of greats Langer, Darren Lockyer, Glenn Lazarus, Shane Webcke and Steve Renouf would have made most coaches successful. \n“I’ve had lots of mentors, lots of guys who have influenced me greatly … people that took a shine to me and helped me along my journey,” Bennett said. \n“But I’ve also been blessed with wonderful players. \n“You can’t do what I’ve done without that.” \nRemarkably, Bennett boasts a 7-0 grand final record as sole head coach. \nFor the record, he lost the 1987 decider as Canberra co-coach with Don Furner.
