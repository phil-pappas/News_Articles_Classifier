(Photo: Ron Page/Post-Crescent Media) \nGreen Bay Packers left tackle David Bakhtiari co-hosted Monday's Clubhouse Live, Gannett Wisconsin Media's live weekly football show. Packers wide receiver Ty Montgomery was Bakhtiari's guest. \nAmong the topics they touched on were the bye week, being a contributor, dealing with injury and growing up. The show can be seen live at The Clubhouse Sports Pub & Grill in downtown Appleton or at clubhouselive.com . \nHere are select and edited answers from the interview: \nREPLAY: Clubhouse Live with Bakhtiari and Montgomery \nQ: You're 6-0 and atop the NFC North standings. What do you like most about this year's team as you reach the bye week? \nBakhtiari: I like that we win. Because when we win, we have more fun. Everyone's a little more relaxed. ... The thing I love most about this team, and I'm a little biased because I'm mainly talking about the offense because that's who I hang out with the most, we just have a really good time. We goof around. We have a good time. It's a very close-knit group that we have. And I would be surprised to see any other teams in the league be as close as we are now as a whole unit — as an offense. \nQ: Once again, we're seeing rookies and younger players stepping in and making plays. You did so, too, when you were a rookie. What do you remember about your learning curve? And why do we see that happening with the Packers on such a consistent basis? \nBakhtiari: (The Packers) provide a really good environment for growth. That's the No. 1 thing. That goes to the coaches. That goes to them drafting the player. We all think when we come in, when we decide to leave college, we think we're definitely confident in our skills and what we can do. But you definitely get humbled once you get in the league. Being in this type of environment when you're able to grow, especially here, I was able to pick things up quickly. Not perfectly, but I was able to come along, and I had a great supporting cast. It wasn't only just the coaches and me being able to develop, it was the guys around me that gave me the opportunity — with Aaron (Rodgers), with Josh Sitton. Josh, I would say, is a huge factor in my growth for where I was as a rookie, to where I am now, to where I continue to go. He's a special guy on this offensive line.
