And it’s a win over the Oakland Raiders. But in this age of mediocrity in the NFL, that 22-20 victory on Sunday could mean a whole lot to the rebuilding Bears. While the victory sparked a celebration in the Chicago Bears’ locker room unlike any other under first-year head coach John Fox, it was far from a season-changing epiphany. The Bears merely appear to be closer to average than we had thought. But average is running rampent in the NFL. So a little growth here and there, and improvement throughout the year, could go a long ways in Chicago. And let’s not forget that the Bears just got their starting quarterback (Jay Cutler) back from injury, and they soon expect to see the same happen to their No. 1 receiver (Alshon Jeffery) and their top defensive lineman (Jeremiah Ratliff). How important was that win? Well, now a whole lot of upcoming games on the Bears’ schedule look winnable (or at least not as lopsided as previously expected). Let’s examine: Up next is road games at Kansas City (1-3) and Detroit (0-3 headed into tonight’s game). In Sunday’s 36-21 loss to the Bengals, Chiefs’ quarterback Alex Smith was sacked five times, and Kansas City could muster only seven field goals, a team record they won't be bragging about. The Chiefs have a minus-4 turnover margin and a three-game losing skid. “It’s all about confidence – you know, everyone talks about how you need confidence – well, if nothing good happens to you, it’s hard to have confidence,” Fox said. “Hopefully we can build on that, and guys understand how to deal with a win.” There’s now a glimmer of hope that the Bears can get some more. Fans who were clamoring for the No. 1 pick in next year’s draft may wind up disappointed after all. In fact, if the growth and improvement continues, they could realistically get back to .500 by their Week 7 bye. Then after that comes another stretch of mediocrity. The Bears host the Vikings (2-2) and then travel to play the Chargers (2-2) and Rams (2-2) in consecutive weeks, three teams that appeared to be light-years ahead of the Bears just a couple of weeks ago. Now, in the land of The So-So NFL, who knows. After taking on the undefeated Broncos (Nov. 22) at home and Packers (Nov. 26) on the road, the Bears host San Francisco (1-3) and Washington (2-2). Closing the season with road games at Minnesota and Tampa Bay (1-3) and at home against Detroit is not an intimidating finishing stretch either. Page 2 of 2 - If they’re not careful, the Bears could all of the sudden burst into that 7-win tier before it’s all said and done. Chances are they won’t be alone. And while that would certainly damage the team’s high-draft status, it would also revitalize the winning attitude in and around Halas Hall and Soldier Field. That may be just as important in the rebuilding process as anything else.
