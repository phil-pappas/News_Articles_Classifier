Officers said a suspect entered the unlocked home and left with cash. \nPrevious Story: Police Investigating Reports Of Attempted Home Larceny \nWhile officers were at the scene, McIntire said a second report came from West Oriole Circle. A suspect entered a garage, then moved to vehicles parked nearby. McIntire said there's no indication that anything was stolen at the second location. \nPolice think the same suspect is involved in both burglary reports. He was described by a witness as a tall, skinny man wearing a black-hooded sweatshirt. \nMcIntire advises the public to keep homes and cars locked. \nIf you have any information, contact Crimestoppers at 605-367-7007.
