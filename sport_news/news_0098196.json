He's already given him the title as a sophomore. \nFAN CAM: Pinecrest at Scotland \nNo doubt, White was stellar Friday, rolling up four touchdowns in Scotland's 35-31 win over fellow unbeaten Pinecrest. \nBut before we hand Player of the Game laurels to White, a deeper look at the statistics shows something that helped him and the Scots get the win. \nCoach Richard Bailey warned his team during practice that they were going to have to pass the football more than they had against any opponent this year. \nSLIDE SHOW: Photos   \nBailey respected the Patriots defense and with good reason. As far back as the summer, Bailey told anyone that would listen that Pinecrest was going to be a good team. Nothing he had seen on video this fall has changed his mind. \nSo he began exploring how Scotland could attack the Patriots through the air in the event White and the ground game were contained. \n\"We had worked a lot on screens,'' Bailey said. \"They play a lot of soft coverage, basically trying not to give up big pass plays.'' \nMoving into the spotlight for the Scots were unlikely heroes Dashaun Ferguson and Randy Leak, quarterback and receiver, respectively. \nWhen they got the word they were going to have to do more than normal, were there any sudden lumps in the throat or cold sweats? \nNot for a second. \n\"It's always exciting knowing you're going to get the ball,'' Leak said. \"I'm always ready. They've got a saying, big players make big plays in big games.'' \nFerguson said it's all about being game ready. \n\"When he calls your number, you've got to do what you do,'' he said. \nTheir reaction wasn't a surprise to Bailey. \n\"Both those guys are senior returning starters,'' he said. \"It's great when you have that veteran presence. You've got to put your faith in those guys.'' \nFerguson completed 16 of 19 passes for 199 yards and one score to Leak. He was 8-for-8 in the final half, all to Leak, who finished with 12 catches for 138 yards. \nWhat the pair did was take advantage of what Pinecrest was allowing, the classic football challenge of adapting and overcoming when the usual strength simply isn't enough. \n\"The screens were what opened up our offense,'' Ferguson said. \"They respected the screens. That led to the off-tackle runs getting open.'' \nThe biggest play of the night for Ferguson and Leak came in the waning seconds of the game as Scotland faced fourth-and-4 at the Pinecrest 20. \nInstead of going to White, the call was a hitch pattern to Leak. Ferguson rolled to his left and hit Leak just beyond the first-down marker. Three plays later, White scored the clinching touchdown with 30 seconds left. \n\"As a receiver, you've always got to be aware of where you are,'' Leak said. \"I knew it was fourth and 4.'' \nThe play went for 9 yards, which was 4 more than Ferguson said it was designed to gain. \n\"We had one last shot and we made it happen,'' he said. \nWhich is exactly how a couple of veteran seniors are supposed to deliver.
