It played scoreless soccer in the second half against Marshall but it was three goals by Marshall’s Diego Umana in the first half that was just too much for Kirksville to overcome as it fell, 3-0. “I think the thing that changed was the physicality of the game. We were playing physical because we knew that the referees weren’t calling a whole lot, so we were able to get away with a bit more,” Kirksville coach Manny Tovar said. “That’s just what we’re going to have to do because that second half was really good compared to the first half.” In that first half, Marshall’s offense cut through the Kirksville defense with relative ease. Every attacking run Kirksville would have, Marshall would have a response and picked on the right side of Kirksville’s defense. “Two of their goals were scored because they played it down the right side and our opposite wingback didn’t get back quick enough and they crossed it,” Tovar said. Umana opened the scoring at the nine-minute mark in the first half, breaking free from the defense. Marshall continued to be the aggressor and Umana benefited again seven minutes later with his second goal of the game. Umana would complete the hat trick seven minutes later with his third goal of the game. At halftime, Ruu Pultz and the defense got a little bit of a jump start to try and get back into game. “I think we just needed a little jump start. I think we needed to come out with more energy,” Pultz said. “In the second half, we realized that they were playing more physical and we realized we could, too.” Tovar switched up his defense in the second half as well as preached more physicality out of his defenders. “We knew that they were fast, so we went to a 5-3-2 (five defenders, three midfielders, two forwards) and it was a bit different because we played with a sweeper and we normally don’t do that,” Tovar said. “But we knew they play a lot of through balls and they’re fast up at the top, so that’s why we had Cohen (Holte) be the sweeper back there.” Pultz added that Marshall’s defense kept funneling all the action back to the middle of the field and prevented the long runs by the offense. “They just did a really good job defending us and in general they really cut off our outside runs and kept the outside congested and forced us back inside,” Pultz said.

After a positive second half, Kirksville will look to send its seniors off with one last win at home. “I think we can bring this momentum from the second half into the game tomorrow against Father Tolton,” Pultz said. “I think we’re going to be really motivated tomorrow like we need to be.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T06:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T07:48:29.830+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
