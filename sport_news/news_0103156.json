Surely McDavid’s presence would change it all for the Edmonton Oilers.Saturday night, at least, it did. \nThe saviour himself — who had the best game of his short, five-game professional career — scored his second and third NHL goals to spark the visitors and lead them to a 5-2 win over the host Calgary Flames. \n“I think first and foremost, the team played well,” McDavid said. “When the team has success, it’s easy to have personal success. \n“Obviously, it feels pretty good to get the first one.” \nMcDavid, Edmonton’s shining star from the 2015 NHL draft, snapped a 1-1 tie with 3:29 left in the second period. It wasn’t a magnificent one; good enough to sneak through Jonas Hiller’s legs. But it did the trick. \nThat’s when the flood gates opened. \n“He was great,” Hall said. “He’s got all the tools to take over a game and that’s what he did tonight. It was fun to watch. I hope he gets a lot of confidence from that game because it’s a tough building to come in and play. \n“A really good road game for our team.” \nIncluding Nugent-Hopkins’ marker in the first period to open the scoring, all of Edmonton’s first overall picks scored on Hiller. \nHall connected with 25 seconds into the third off a Sean Monahan face-off loss while Nail Yakupov also slipped one in (McDavid’s handiwork). McDavid came through again, a beauty with 3:40 left — although his best play of the night happened when he tried to dangle his way around Hiller but, sprawled out on his back, the Flames goalie managed to stick out his paddle on the Oilers phenom. \n“I think I’m just getting more and more comfortable and it’s only the beginning, five games in,” McDavid said. “I just hope to get better and better.” \nSure, Flames winger David Jones connected for good measure. Twice, in fact; once after the Oilers went up 4-1 in the third period and 5:07 into the second period to tie the action 1-1. He was even promoted to the first line while Hudler was plugged in with Michael Frolik and Mikael Backlund for much of the third period. \nBut, for the first time in a long time versus Edmonton, it wasn’t pretty for the home team which fell to 1-4-0 on the season. \nThe Oilers, winless before entering the Dome, earned their first dub-ya of the season. \n“It’s not like we’ve won the ‘Cup or anything,” Hall said. “We’ll enjoy it for a little bit … we didn’t play measured at all. We weren’t caught up in wins and losses. We just wanted to go after that team, just like they played all last year. They went after it. \n“It’s fun to play like that.” \nMcDavid’s goal in the second period was a microcosm of the Flames’ middle frames this season. \nThey took two straight penalties in less than four minutes with Micheal Ferland and Dougie Hamilton serving time. \nThe Oilers almost capitalized, too, and McDavid put on a show almost scoring on a one-timer and controlling the play for much of Hamilton’s high-sticking infraction. Sign of things to come. \nEarlier in the period, Backlund also saved the day when he backhanded a rebound into the corner — also helping on the sequence were Wideman and Russell. \nThe sad part about it was they had 1:43 of power-play time to start the middle frame when Matt Hendricks took an interference penalty with 17.4 left in the first. \nThe Flames also had a three-on-one short-handed opportunity between Frolik, Hamilton, and Mark Giordano while Johnny Gaudreau sat off for high sticking at the end of the second period. \nThey were out-shot by the Oilers 14-5 in the middle frame; 28-24 in the end. And this came one night after they’d only managed four shots in the second period of Friday’s 3-1 loss to the Winnipeg Jets. \nAnd, to think, their start hadn’t been that bad. Really. \nHiller looked sharp when he came out of his crease to challenge Yakupov in the first minute of the game while, on the other end, Ferland had a partial breakaway scoring opportunity on Oilers’ goalie Cam Talbot. \nNeither scored and left it up to Deryk Engelland and Luke Gazdic to provide the entertainment 6:06 into the game — the obligatory Battle of Alberta scrap at centre ice. \nShortly after, things took a wrong turn for the Flames. \nNugent-Hopkins scored the lone goal of the frame with 7:01 left in the first period, capitalizing on a massive rebound allowed by Hiller on Eric Gryba’s shot. This came just minutes after Nugent-Hopkins hit Hiller’s far post. \nLater, McDavid was the star of the show. \n“Connor’s speed, it’s incredible,” said Oilers forward Mark Letestu, who, with the Pittsburgh Penguins, had watched Sidney Crosby develop over the years. \n“Sid can get around, he can skate, but not quite at that speed … the skill set is a little different but the impact they have on the team itself very similar. At a young age, they’re able to control the flow of the game and the team. \n“(Saturday) he had some help, but he was a big part of the reason we won … he was the catalyst.” \nHeading into the game, the Flames had won their last seven meetings with their provincial rivals and outscored them 21-10. Last year, it was hardly a Battle of Alberta as Calgary won all four meetings.Might be a different story this year. \n“I hope so,” Letestu said. “Unfortunately, we’re the reason the Battle of Alberta wasn’t at its’ intensity. Calgary was just playing some good hockey. It’s on us to raise our level to get this to a rivalry.” \nkodland@calgaryherald.com \nTwitter/KristenOdlandCH", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T15:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T18:53:31.405+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
