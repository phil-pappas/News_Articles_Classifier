Atlanta quarterback Matt Ryan was sacked five times, and the Falcons had five fumbles. Three were recovered by New Orleans. \nThat didn't stop the angry herd from Atlanta. Many of the responses referred to stickum, which Rice said he never used. \"Never used Stickum! Don't blame me for dropped footballs. My work effort speaks for itself. #Goat.\" \nBeautiful. The hashtag Goat stands for \"Greatest of all-time,\" and who's going to argue with the NFL's all-time leader in catches, yards and touchdowns.
