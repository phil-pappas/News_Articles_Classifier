(Supplied) \nNisha Ali cracked a superb half century as the Sharjah Cricket Council Academy coasted to a 32-run victory over ICC Academy in the inaugural Dubai Cricket Council Women's League at the Fairgrounds in Dubai Men’s College. Turning lucky with the coin, SCC Academy chose to bat but lost a wicket quickly with Subha Srinivasan contributing just three runs. Nisha Ali and Esha Oza (13, 26b, 1x4) then stitched together a fine 71-run partnership for the second wicket to put SCC Academy in a commanding position. Ali struck two sixes and 11 boundaries during her impressive 31-ball 69. Natasha Cherrith scored a patient 26-ball 14 before SCC Academy lost a few quick wickets as they posted a healthy 145 for five in 20 overs. Chasing a challenging target, ICC Academy got off to a roaring start with openers Priyanjali Jain and Kaveesha Kumari posting 87 runs. While Jain struck 38 from 44 balls, Kumari hit 33 from 50 deliveries. It looked like ICC would cruise comfortably towards victory when SCC Academy’s key bowler Humaira Tasneem got into the thick of action. She picked up three quick wickets to turn the tables around for SCC Academy as ICC Academy managed to pile on only 113 for three in 20 overs. Tasneem gave away only 18 runs in her four overs, while Natasha and Samia Salim supported her well with eight tidy overs.
