JMU gears up for ESPN's 'College GameDay' By Richie Bozek | The Breeze The Breeze In less than 140 characters Thursday, Lee Fitting, the producer of ESPN’s “College GameDay” and a JMU alumnus (’96), excited the JMU fan base with a single tweet. The tweet read, “JMU is on the ‘to be considered’ list for next week.” On Sunday morning, the JMU community’s hope of having the national ESPN broadcast come to campus became a reality. Fitting again took to Twitter to announce that JMU was selected to host “GameDay” for its Homecoming football game against the University of Richmond on Saturday. The program will air on ESPN from 9 a.m. to noon. “This game with Richmond has been on our potential site list now for a little bit over a month,” Fitting said. “When Texas A&M and Ole Miss lost [Saturday], we were pretty firm in our stance that we were going to JMU … It just kind of worked out the perfect week. If this game versus Richmond was this past weekend, there would have been no shot of us coming to Harrisonburg.” The initial wave of “GameDay” staff will arrive to Harrisonburg to survey the campus on Monday, scouting out locations to set up things such as offices and trucks. On Wednesday, a larger wave of technical staff will arrive with a caravan of ESPN trucks and buses. Setup will begin early Thursday morning, and by Thursday evening, the “GameDay” set will be ready for TV for “College Football Live” on Friday afternoon. Ideally, Fitting wants to set up in front of Wilson Hall on the Quad. “A stadium backdrop you can get any week,” Fitting said. “The Quad is the school’s character, its flavor. That’s ultimately what we’re looking for.” Admission to be behind the “GameDay” set is free and first-come, first-serve with no limit on attendance, according to Fitting. But it’s a polar opposite for the game. As of late Sunday afternoon, both student tickets and public seating for next Saturday’s game at the 25,000 capacity Bridgeforth Stadium had sold out. “I look at this as a great opportunity for the Harrisonburg community,” JMU Director of Athletics Jeff Bourne said. “It’s one of those moments that’s going to be very special, and it’s not something that you can ever really replicate.” According to Bourne, game time will remain 3:30 p.m. and the broadcast will remain on Comcast SportsNet. JMU initiated contact with “GameDay” back in August in hopes of being considered later in the season. According to Interim Director of Athletics Communications Kevin Warner, there was more conversation after the Dukes defeated Football Bowl Subdivision opponent Southern Methodist University 48-45 on Sept. 26. “We knew if it’s going to happen we need to lay the groundwork in advance,” Warner said on Friday. “Really it was just this past week as we knew Homecoming was getting closer and that was shaping up to be a really good game that we wanted to make a little more push.” The JMU fan base helped with this push, voicing its reasonings on why “GameDay” should be brought to Harrisonburg. “It was an outpouring of support trying to bring ‘GameDay’ to JMU, which was awesome,” Fitting said with a chuckle. “By no means is that a deal breaker … but it certainly helps ... It makes you sort think if we did bring the show there, [about] the crowd involvement and support.” Other non-Football Bowl Subdivision “GameDay” stops have included Williams College in 2007, Florida A&M University in 2008, North Dakota State University in 2013 and North Dakota State and Harvard University in 2014. “We’ve just had such good luck with these FCS programs and getting a great turnout at the show,” Fitting said. “That’s something we’ve tried to be more cognitive of, is recognizing all of college football. The competitiveness, and that passion and pageantry goes along with all these schools, not just at the [FBS] top 25 level.” Warner feels that the storylines associated with JMU football this year justify ESPN’s visit. Some of these stories include Dukes’ undefeated 7-0 record, the second-longest regular season winning streak in the FCS (14), the presence of JMU alumnus Charles Haley (’86) — a 2015 Pro Football Hall of Fame inductee and five-time Super Bowl champion — for Homecoming, JMU’s offense, which leads the nation in multiple categories and redshirt senior quarterback Vad Lee as a front-runner for Player of the Year, and his decision to transfer to JMU last year from a starting position at Georgia Tech University of the Atlantic Coast Conference. The success of Ohio State University’s head football coach Urban Meyer’s coaching tree presents a compelling story too, as JMU’s second-year head coach Everett Withers is a branch of that tree. The University of Utah and the University of Houston are also coached by former Meyer staff, and both programs are also undefeated. JMU and Richmond are the only remaining undefeated teams in the Colonial Athletic Association and are poised for a marquee conference matchup. JMU is currently ranked No. 4 in the FCS, while Richmond is No. 11. “It’s terrific exposure for the conference, it’s terrific exposure for FCS football,” CAA Commissioner Tom Yeager said. “I think that it’s a tribute to the kind of support that JMU has around their football program … It’s a big, big event for everybody involved.” It’s tradition to return to campus for Homecoming as an alumnus at any school — this round of “Gameday” is a little different for Fitting. “Never in my wildest dreams did I ever think we would bring ‘College GameDay’ to JMU,” Fitting said. “Sure we joke about it and people bust my chops about it … Here we are at Homecoming, JMU’s a top-five team in a highly ranked versus ranked game. It’s crazy, it’s kind of surreal.” Kickoff on Saturday at Bridgeforth Stadium is at 3:30 p.m. Contact Richie Bozek at breezesports@gmail.com .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T05:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T03:02:15.439+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
