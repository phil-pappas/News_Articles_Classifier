St. Joseph next plays Nov. 7 against Paramus Catholic. \nORADELL — The St. Joseph football players sat in the two buses in the Bergen Catholic parking lot Saturday afternoon. Heads in hands or leaning up against the windows, the Green Knights were the very picture of dejection. \nThat’s what happens when you get your heart broken, in overtime, by your biggest rival two years in a row. \n“It’s crushing,” St. Joseph coach Augie Hoffmann said after his Green Knights dropped a stunning 16-13 decision to Bergen Catholic at Crusader Stadium. \nAnd it’s a loss that hurts on so many levels. Not only does it drop the Green Knights (5-3), No. 2 in The Record non-public football Top 6, out of first place in the Big North United Division, but it is sure to shuffle the Non-Public Group 4 power-point standings in BC’s favor. \nThe St. Joseph defense, one of the best in North Jersey, played quite well. They put a lot of pressure on BC sophomore quarterback Johnny Langan, even on the game-winning touchdown pass, quelling several BC drives along the way. \n“They hit really hard,” said Langan, who has stepped in for injured senior Jarrett Guarantano. “I think they compare to the IMG [Academy, Florida] defense. They were really tough.” \nFair enough, but the BC defense was a touch better, keeping the St. Joseph offense from making big plays. St. Joseph’s one touchdown, a 2-yard run by senior running back Brian Kearns, was set up by an interception that junior linebacker Jack Agnew returned to the BC 2-yard line. \nSophomore quarterback Nick Patti threw for only 34 yards and was intercepted once. Kearns, who a 62-yard run in the second quarter, finished with 72 yards on eight carries, and the Green Knights had only two first downs in the second half when a sustained drive or two could have put major pressure on the Bergen Catholic offense. \nThe best offensive performance of the day came from freshman kicker Angelo Guglielmello, who booted a career-high 39-yard field goal in the first quarter to give St. Joseph a 3-0 lead, and a 33-yarder in overtime to make it 13-10. Guglielmello has eight field goals on 10 attempts in eight games, and it was the second time he’s kicked two in a game. \nThe Green Knights bounced back with four straight wins after last season’s double-overtime loss at Dinallo Stadium in Montvale. They’ll have to stew on this one for a while, though, because they have a week off before facing Paramus Catholic in their Big North United finale Nov. 7. \nLangan said he was looking forward to the possibility of seeing the Green Knights again in the playoffs. Hoffmann, however, wasn’t quite ready to start looking for solace there. \n“We’ve got to worry about Paramus Catholic now,” Hoffmann said.
