Lamb to the slaughter. Patsy to the laughter.\nAnd then, goodness, STEEERRIIIKKKE 1!\nIn the dugout, teammates’ jaws dropped and mouths opened.\nFor a few fleeting moments, all the wretchedness of Tuesday was forgotten, the grotesquely crooked numbers on the scoreboard, the embarrassment of a butt-kicking in your own house, the failure to advance a single runner beyond first base after the third inning — apart from a stolen base (on indifference) in the eighth, and the skinny window ledge on which the team is now so precariously standing.\nThe bottom line, the reason Toronto was eviscerated 14-2 by Kansas City in Game 4 of the American League Championship Series, is now on the verge of the elimination: Pennington, who hasn’t thrown a ball off the mound in a dozen years, wasn’t even the worst pitcher on the day for the Jays.\nThe Babe Ruth connection, Pennington only learned of it afterwards, when the team and its despondent fans had finally been put of their misery, three hours and thirty-nine minutes after R.A. Dickey had opened the taps, allowing a leadoff bunt to Alcides Escobar, who would score on Ben Zobrist’s homer. K.C. was off: 14 runs on 15 hits, and depleting Toronto’s bullpen in the process.\n“That’s pretty cool,” said Pennington, about the Ruth reference asterisk affixed next to his name. “Maybe I can hit 700 homers and join him in that group too.”\nPennington was a good sport about the eccentricity of this blob game, while being careful not to get too smiley. It’s really not very funny, down 3-games-to-1, although you might recall that the Royals were in precisely this same predication — other side of the equation — the last time these two clubs met in the post-season, 1985, and stormed back to reel off three wins in a row.\nNot much more than a slippery foothold to keep from plummeting, though.\nPennington’s contribution — because he’d been a full-time pitcher in high school and minored in pitching at college — arose from an eighth-inning discussion with pitching coach Pete Walker in the dugout. In the event of an emergency. . . break case.\nWith Aaron Loup again unavailable — he had left to deal with a family matter — the cupboard was nearly bare and manager John Gibbons had to consider the urgency of Game 4 on Wednesday. Aaron Sanchez and Roberto Osuna, who had both seen service Monday, were untouchables.\n“We weren’t going to use those guys,” said Gibbons, of the young ’uns. “They’ll be good for a couple of innings each tomorrow.’’ So, reluctantly, after churning through Liam Hendriks, LaTroy Hawkins and Ryan Tepera, Gibbons turned reluctantly to Mark Lowe — the third member of the relief trinity, with Sanchez and Osuna, whom he trusts, reluctantly summoning him in the eighth, an arm-burn.\n“He’s been one of our go-to guys. It was getting so ugly. You try to have a little pride anyway.’’\nGrinding on, the only ninth-frame option was Pennington, who had volunteered for the potentially suicide mission. Gibbons loathed the circumstances, the mess forced upon him by Dickey’s abysmal start — the shortest outing, at one and two-third innings, in the 40-year-old’s career as a knuckleballer, his shortest since 2008 as a “normal’’ pitcher.\n“I hate to use position players,’’ Gibbons said. “Maybe we made history today, I don’t know.’’ Then, just about spitting it out: “A big game like that, a position player pitches . . .”\nPennington was, as catcher Russell Martin noted, not half-bad, and very much in the supportive crowd’s affections. He hit 91m.p.h. on the radar gun, surrendering two runs on two hits. It could have been so much worse.\n“I was just trying to throw strikes.’’\nOf the prologue mound-conference with Martin: “He hadn’t caught me before. So I had to tell him what I had.’’\nFastball, curveball, change-up.\nDickey, on the other hand, had nothing, nada, zilch, on a day when the knuckler was treacherous. It felt like he died a thousand deaths out there, in a 22-pitch, 12-minute first inning that started out bunt, home run, walk, stunning the audience into silence. Four runs scored before Dickey got back into the dugout, then another home run in the second.\nThe knuckleball, Dickey said later, was good in the bullpen. It must have stayed there.\n“They hit the ones that were a little bit flatter. Two singles, two home runs, and I’m out of the game quickly.’’\nToronto got two back in the third off Royals starter Chris Young, narrowing the deficit to 5-2, but never came close again.\n“They did a really good job of arresting the momentum,” Dickey said, “whereas, my first inning, I had trouble arresting the damage. I put us in a hole. They kept tacking on, kept hitting, kept hitting, and put it away pretty easily.’’\nToronto got yeoman long-innings relief from Liam Hendriks, who carried the burden through four and one-third innings behind Dickey, giving up only one hit and no runs. Though once upon a time a starter, the Aussie had thrown no more than three innings (twice) all season. He persevered through 59 pitches.\nAnd eager for more, in Game 4. “I’m sure they’ll try to tell me I’m down tomorrow. I’m not going to let ’em.’’\nMore on thestar.com\nRoyals a better team than Blue Jays in every way in ALCS so far: Arthur\nFive key moments from Blue Jays’ Game 4 ALCS loss to Royals", "external_links": ["http://static.freeskreen.com/publisher/52/freeskreen.min.js"], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T06:00:29.648+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
