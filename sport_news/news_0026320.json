I did not record all of it and it proceeded to get worse during the national anthem when they charged the band. Please repost and share this is not ok. Posted by Sam Whipple on Friday, October 16, 2015 PITTSBURG -- School district officials in Antioch and Pittsburg will investigate an incident before Friday's football game between Deer Valley and Pittsburg high schools, an official for one of the districts said Sunday. \nVideo circulated on social media Sunday of Deer Valley's football players and members of the Pittsburg marching band appearing to warm up on the same stretch of football field. The two sides continued through their pregame routines, which for the band included a rendition of the national anthem that was played as Deer Valley players continued to move around on the field. \nA video shot from the Pittsburg side of the field does not appear to show any physical confrontations between any of the players or the band members. \n\"Both Antioch and Pittsburg school administration will jointly review the events that occurred before the start of the game,\" Antioch Unified School District Superintendent Donald Gill said in an email Sunday. \"Based upon the review, any disciplinary action needed will be taken.\" \nIn a video circulated on Facebook, Deer Valley players appear to be warming up when the Pittsburg band marched onto the field and into their space as the band takes formation. Some Deer Valley players then appear to walk through the band members en route a team huddle formed amid the band, as it continues to play. Advertisement \nAt no point in the Facebook video -- a clip lasting 2 minutes, 43 seconds -- do the Deer Valley players appear to stop what they are doing, even as the national anthem and \"God Bless America,\" are played. Referees penalized Deer Valley 15 yards for unsportsmanlike conduct before the kickoff in a game Pittsburg won 31-28. \nA second video posted on this newspaper's site showed Deer Valley players walking around and through the band during the playing of both \"God Bless America\" and the national anthem. \nDeer Valley coach Robert Hubbard said he could not comment on the incident but said insinuations that his players caused the ruckus were incorrect. Pittsburg coach Vic Galli did not return a phone call seeking comment. Emails to the school's respective athletic directors were not returned immediately. \nCheck back for updates.
