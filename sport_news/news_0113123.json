After Manchester United had enjoyed 63% of the ball at home on Sunday he was not going to change his tune.\nUnited managed one shot on target, and that was not until the 88th minute. But Manchester City, which Van Gaal had proclaimed the favorite before the game, did no better. A sterile match ended 0–0.\n“We had 90 minutes control of the game against a side like Manchester City. I cannot complain,” Van Gaal told the BBC, before adding: “But you want to win and we did not.”\nManuel Pellegrini, the City manager who had been deprived by injury of David Silva and the United killer Sergio Agüero, was less happy with the stodgy fare.\n“Unfortunately for the fans it was not a very attractive game,” Pellegrini told the BBC. “We are two creative teams but we could not do it today.”\n“It was a very tactical game.”\n• Highly anticipated Manchester Derby ends in scoreless draw\nUnited struggled in attack. Wayne Rooney, the center forward, completed only 17 of his 31 passes, or a horrible 55%. The numbers were worse where it mattered. In the attacking third, Rooney completed only three of 13 passes. Vincent Kompany, once again, owned Rooney.\nUnited only began to look dangerous when Van Gaal reverted to an anti-possession tactic he adopted with success last season. With 15 minutes left, the United manager threw on Marouane Fellaini to act as an aerial target.\nIn the last few minutes, Jesse Lingard hit the bar after a high cross fell to him. Then Fellaini beat the City defenders to a long, high, free kick and headed down to Chris Smalling who shot low and hard. Joe Hart saved at full stretch.\n“It didn’t feel like it was a dynamic derby, I think both of us didn’t want to lose the game,” Kompany told Sky TV. “For us a good draw, definitely.”\nIt was ugly, but Pellegrini also found a silver lining: “We are back at the top of the table.”\nYour browser does not support iframes.\nLeap of Faith After Christian Benteke rose to rocket a header into the goal in the 77th minute at Anfield on Sunday, Jürgen Klopp leapt almost as high on the sideline. The new Liverpool boss might have broken the Premier League manager’s high jump record as he punched the air to celebrate the first goal since he took over.\nSomewhere far from Anfield two out-of-work managers may have sunk deeper into their sofas.\nKlopp was less happy 10 minutes later when Southampton also took to the air. Sadio Mané bundled in the equalizing goal after the Saints had won two headers in the penalty area. The game ended 1–1.\n“We have to be more calm in these moments,” Klopp told Sky TV.\nPlanet Futbol Video Jurgen Klopp brings needed vitality to Liverpool as club's new manager by Ben Lyttleton", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T21:04:27.362+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
