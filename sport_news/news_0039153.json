(Or so she said.) In another couple of decades, inflation will make $20 bills about as valuable as floss. But now, what can you really get for $20? A Chipotle burrito and a beer. A ticket to a formulaic sequel and a small popcorn. A half-hour of Skee-Ball at Dave and Buster’s.\nBut if you’re young and live near Boston, you can also do something pretty extraordinary with that $20: You can get fantastic seats for almost any concert from the Boston Symphony Orchestra with their $20 under 40 promotion . The BSO is one of the great orchestras in the country so the value is incredible. To take advantage, you don’t need to do anything special. Just order your tickets online and show ID confirming your age when you pick them up.\nThe BSO started the $20 Under 40 promotion in 2007, when their research showed that young people avoided the Symphony because of the cost, according to BSO marketing director Kim Noltemy. “We wanted to take the price part out of the equation,” Noltemy said. Since the program’s inception, 8,000-12,000 people have taken advantage of the offer each season.\nFor the 2015-2016 season, which kicked off Thursday, Noltemy has a few suggestions for those making their first BSO outing. The November 19 program features works by J.S. Bach, Shostakovich, and Alan Berg. “Those who come will recognize the music, ” Noltemy said. “The music is really rich and beautiful.”\nThanksgiving week’s program of Haydn, Bartók, and Tchaikovsky is “very easy to listen to. It would give the listener a good overview of the kinds of music we regularly perform.” The featured pianist for this program, Yefim Bronfman, is spectacular.\nIf you’re in the mood for a more adventurous outing, check out the November 15 and 17 performances of Strauss’s opera Elektra . Many people are skeptical of opera, but, said Noltemy, “the cast is unbelievable, and it’s really going to be an event--a really special night that will not be forgotten.”\nAnd for $20, what do you have to lose? You can get a burrito another night.\nBy Jay Greenspan @mizdflop Share 0 Tweet 0 Advertisement Life He missed out on qualifying for the Boston Marathon by one (one!) second 10.05.15 | 5:15 PM Pets Puppy found in Maine that had mouth bound shut undergoes successful surgery 10.05.15 | 4:54 PM Mass. travel Things you didn’t know about these iconic Boston landmarks 10.05.15 | 4:42 PM Life Under 40?
