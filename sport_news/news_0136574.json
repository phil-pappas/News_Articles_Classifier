Breslow started last Saturday at home against the Orioles, leading the charge with four scoreless innings in what turned into an 8-0 shutout victory. Breslow threw 55 pitches in that outing — the most he'd thrown in a game since his rookie season in 2005. He's actually felt pretty good this week after that performance, though. \"I was as concerned as anyone about what the repercussions of going out there and blowing it out would be. I actually bounced back well,\" Breslow said. \"I feel pretty good. I actually felt like getting a chance to extend myself and pitch out of the windup, I felt comfortable and I felt like I was able to get in a good rhythm with my delivery.\" Interim manager Torey Lovullo said Breslow's pitch count will again be in the range of 50 to 60 pitches. Breslow was taken aback by how smoothly he transitioned to the starting role last time out, especially to a windup that he hadn’t used since college. \"For me, it was like, if this is going to be a one-time thing, I'm going to look the part as much as possible. It wasn’t really too much more than that,\" Breslow said of breaking out the windup. \"I thought it would feel so incredibly uncomfortable that I would give up a hit to the first hitter and be in the stretch the rest of the way. I just felt like I had a good rhythm, and so much of pitching is finding that comfortable rhythm and tempo. Whether it's just the almost harmonic movements of the delivery, it just felt comfortable. It felt like it kept me under control where it would have been really easy to get maybe out of sorts because it was such an unfamiliar situation.\" Ortiz talks way into lineup Contrary to some expectations, David Ortiz returned to the Red Sox lineup on Friday night for the opener of their final series of the year in Cleveland. Ortiz had started two of the four games in New York, and he had left both of them after three plate appearances. Lovullo had talked about using that same pattern \"if (Ortiz) plays again\" in his comments Thursday. But a postgame discussion that night led to Ortiz being back in the lineup Friday. \"I just asked him how he felt, he said I’m ready to go,\" Lovullo said. \"That was really it. Maybe I gave you guys the wrong impression, which I apologize for. All along, we were going to re-evaluate where he was at today and just talk it over and see how he felt. Obviously, he wants to play. \"The best parts about David are the things nobody knows about. He wants to play for all the right reasons. He wants to play to win a game. He wants to play to do well. He wants to play to show his younger teammates that this is what a championship-style player does. It speaks volumes about his character, that he is here to play.\" \"I'm playing today,\" Ortiz said. \"We'll see how that goes.\" Hanigan still out Ryan Hanigan is still available only on an emergency basis as the Boston catcher tries to work through a hand injury. \"We miss him. We miss his presence,\" Lovullo said. \"We're not going to put him out there unless he's 100 percent ready to go.\" Hanigan hasn’t played since Sept. 24. Outfield alignment Mookie Betts was in center field again for the series opener in Cleveland. Betts was flanked by Rusney Castillo in left field and Jackie Bradley Jr. in right field. Boston has toyed with its outfield alignment over the last five weeks, moving Castillo from right to left and Betts from center to right for a time. A quad strain for Castillo, though, meant Betts went back into center earlier this week, with Lovullo also saying he didn’t want Betts to forget the position this late in the season. Nevertheless, Lovullo said the Sox were confident with what they saw from Betts in right, which included arguably the team's catch of the year to preserve Rich Hill's shutout last week against the Orioles. \"We saw the footwork. We saw how he goes back on some balls, the comfort level he had in that open space,\" Lovullo said. \"We’re going to be fine with what we’ve seen. What we’ve discovered is those three athletes out there are pretty talented.\" By Tim Britton", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T04:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T21:22:55.436+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
