Heiko Junge NTB scanpix via AP 1 of 2 \nBy MARK LEWIS and KARL RITTER \nAssociated Press Order Reprint of this Story OSLO, Norway \nA Tunisian democracy group won the Nobel Peace Prize on Friday for its contributions to the first and most successful Arab Spring movement. \nThe Norwegian Nobel Committee cited the Tunisian National Dialogue Quartet “for its decisive contribution to the building of a pluralistic democracy” in the North African country following its 2011 revolution. \n“It established an alternative, peaceful political process at a time when the country was on the brink of civil war,” the committee said in its citation. \nThe prize is a huge victory for small Tunisia, whose young and still shaky democracy suffered two extremist attacks this year that killed 60 people and devastated the tourism industry. \nTunisian protesters sparked uprisings across the Arab world in 2011 that overthrew dictators and upset the status quo. Tunisia is the only country in the region to painstakingly build a democracy, involving a range of political and social forces in dialogue to create a constitution, legislature and democratic institutions. \n“More than anything, the prize is intended as an encouragement to the Tunisian people, who despite major challenges have laid the groundwork for a national fraternity which the committee hopes will serve as an example to be followed by other countries,” Nobel Peace Prize Committee Chairwoman Kaci Kullmann Five said. \nThe National Dialogue Quartet is made up of four key organizations in Tunisian civil society: the Tunisian General Labour Union; the Tunisian Confederation of Industry, Trade and Handicrafts; the Tunisian Human Rights League; and the Tunisian Order of Lawyers. \nKullmann Five said the prize was for the quartet as a whole, not the four individual organizations. \nHoucine Abassi, the leader of the Tunisian General Labour Union, told The Associated Press he was “overwhelmed” by the award. \n“It’s a prize that crowns more than two years of efforts deployed by the quartet when the country was in danger on all fronts,” he said. \nThe decision came as a surprise to many, with speculation having focused on Europe’s migrant crisis or the Iran-U.S. nuclear deal in July. \n“It is a very good prize that tries to get into the heart of the conflict in the Muslim world,” said Oeyvind Stenersen, a Nobel historian. “But it was a bit bewildering. It was very unexpected.” \nEuropean leaders welcomed the prize, with EU commission president tweeting that “after visit to Tunisia in March I understand & respect choice.” \nThe prize comes the day after unidentified assailants shot repeatedly at a lawmaker and prominent sports magnate in Sousse, underscoring a sense of uncertainty in the city, which depends heavily on tourism. \nWhile Tunisia has been much less violent than neighboring Libya or Syria, its transition to democracy has been marred by occasional violence, notably from Islamic extremists. \nAn attack in June on a beach resort in Sousse left 38 dead, mostly British tourists. Another in March killed 22 people, again mostly tourists, at the country’s leading museum, the Bardo in Tunis. \nThere were 273 candidates nominated for the 2015 peace prize, five fewer than in 2014. \nThe award capped a week of Nobel Prize announcements, with the winners of the medicine, physics, chemistry and literature awards presented earlier in Stockholm. \nThe economics award – not an original Nobel Prize but created in 1968 – will be announced on Monday. \n––– \nRitter reported from Stockholm.
