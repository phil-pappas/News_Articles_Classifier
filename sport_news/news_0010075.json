This year, the Red Raiders are hoping to get back on top Comment By Jack Flagler Posted Oct. 14, 2015 at 7:42 pm Updated at 7:47 PM GASTONIA – Over the last two seasons, the South Point and Forestview teams have proven themselves not just among the best in the Big South 2A/3A Conference, but able to hang with the best in the state. The Jaguars ended the Red Raiders’ seven-year run on top of the conference last season thanks to a thrilling 34-31 overtime victory in Belmont. But at the end of the year, it was the Red Raiders who were the last team standing, advancing all the way to the 3A state semifinal before falling to Crest. The season before, the roles were reversed. South Point won the regular season matchup between the two teams 49-34 and went undefeated in conference play. But it was Forestview that advanced further in the state tournament, winning three playoff games before a loss to Concord in the state semifinal round. All that is to say, next week’s matchup between the Jaguars and Red Raiders is not necessarily the game of the year. South Point coach Mickey Lineberger likes to say the most important game on the schedule is the next one, and both teams have proven with their recent tournament performances that a loss in this matchup won’t necessarily define the season as a whole. But in mid-October – as both teams enter with perfect 3-0 conference records – regular season games don’t come much bigger than this one. Forestview (4-3, 3-0) enters having outscored conference opponents 111-27 over the last three weeks, earning wins over Lake Norman Charter, Stuart Cramer and North Gaston. Running back Moe Neal has broken the Gaston County career yards from scrimmage and scoring records, and the senior Syracuse commit has posted three straight 100-yard rushing performances. “It’s hard to tackle him in a phone booth,” Lineberger said of Neal. “He makes a lot of great defenses miss – he really does. We’ve got to get eleven hats to the ball. If one misses the next one has to be right there to take his place. It’s all about effort. It’s all about intensity. It’s all about getting there and arriving in a bad mood.” On the Forestview side, coach and South Point grad Chris Medlin expects a well-prepared, well-disciplined and well-organized opponent Friday night. “Schemes are going to be irrelevant if we don’t play hard, because they’re going to play hard. They always have,” Medlin said. “We need to match their intensity. That’s the key.” Like Forestview, South Point has also won all its conference games by double digits. The Red Raiders (5-2, 3-0) have yet to allow more than 14 points against a Big South opponent, while posting 89 points total in those three contests. Combined, quarterback Diontrea King and fullback Ryland Etherton have been steady and nearly unstoppable on the ground this year – that duo is averaging 5.99 yards per carry and 238 yards per game. Last season, after Forestview’s victory, Lineberger said the loss “tore up” his players. But the Red Raiders picked themselves up, got back to work, and closed the year strong, using the loss as a wake-up call to play more disciplined football while maintaining the focus of the larger picture. Medlin also stressed the importance of keeping the long-term goals in mind while preparing for each opponent week-to-week. A conference championship is a major goal for his team, but there will be more challenges ahead no matter the outcome of Friday’s game. “Either way it doesn’t have to define your season, the past two years have proved that,” Medlin said. Lineberger used the metaphor of headlights on a dark road to illustrate his point about the journey of the season. “They shine out about 200 feet, and we want to be about 200 feet closer to Chapel Hill every day – that’s where the state championship will be played – that’s our mentality and that’s our goal. We don’t do it every year, but that’s our goal every year. We’re trying to get 200 feet closer.” This weekend, one of these teams will be 200 feet closer to a conference championship. We’ll have to wait until the end of Friday night’s game to find out which side that will be.
