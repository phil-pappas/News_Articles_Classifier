Lions (4-8) today to build on the momentum of their 33-21 victory over the Montreal Alouettes on Sunday: \nPRESSURE THE QUARTERBACK \nIt’s hardly bulletin-board material, but the Riders need to make rookie quarterback Jonathon Jennings uncomfortable whether it’s in the pocket or running around. Jennings is making his second start in relief of the injured John Beck and could be flustered by an aggressive front four. The Riders don’t need sacks, though that would help. The pressure from defensive ends John Chick and Alex Hall could force the young quarterback into making mistakes. \nWATCH FOR RAINEY \nHeading into Week 15, Lions returner Chris Rainey led the CFL in punt-return yardage (325) and kickoff return yardage (404). The Riders are among the league’s best on punt coverage. They are coming off Sunday’s game in which they held the explosive Stefan Logan to a combined eight returns for 124 yards. Shorter returns would mean a longer field for Jennings to navigate. That would allow the defence to increase the pressure on Jennings. \nMESSAM THE MAN \nJerome Messam headed into Week 15 as the CFL’s leading rusher and he likes that spot. Messam is a bruising fullback with running back speed. The Riders boast the league’s best running attack and the Lions are the worst at stopping the run. It sounds like an opportunity to turn Messam loose. If he needs a breather, Anthony Allen is more than capable of breaking off a long run of his own. \nBE FREE \nHead coach Bob Dyce and defensive co-ordinator Greg Quick have allowed the Riders’ defenders to play more freely than under former head coach Corey Chamblin. The players aren’t worried about making mistakes. Macho Harris had a career-high three interceptions against the Alouettes because he was allowed to make plays. That’s part of the defensive scheme and a reason why the defence has played better on Dyce’s watch.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T05:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T08:07:57.574+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
