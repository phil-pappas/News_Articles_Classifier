With Steven Vitoria backpedaling, Grella juked left and sent a left-footed shot deflecting off the defender and past goalkeeper Andre Blake. Tim Cahill scored the previous fastest goal at 8 seconds in the Red Bulls' 3-0 victory over the Houston Dynamo on Oct. 20, 2013. \nGrella also scored in the 17th minute to give New York a 3-0 lead. \nWright-Phillips added his 16th goal of the season on a right-footed volley in the fourth minute. Kemar Lawrence scored his first MLS goal to make it 4-0 just before the half. \nThe Red Bulls are level with FC Dallas in the Supporters' Shield race for the overall regular-season title with one game left. \nSebastien Le Toux scored for the Union in the 55th minute. \nIn Washington, Chris Pontius scored in the 39th minute and D.C. United added three second-half goals to beat the Chicago Fire 4-0. \nUnited moved into second place in the East and can secure an automatic berth in the conference semifinals with a win over Columbus in the regular-season finale. \nPontius opened the scoring when he pushed the ball past Chicago's Jon Busch with a heavy touch and raced behind the goalkeeper to finish in the open net. \nBobby Boswell headed home Fabian Espindola's corner in the 67th minute, Espindola knocked in a left-footer with the benefit of defender Lovel Palmer's deflection in the 71st, and Alvaro Saborio volleyed in a high-arching deflection from point-blank range in the 80th. \nPortland's Fanendo Adi scored two second-half goals in the Timbers' 5-2 victory over the Los Angeles Galaxy . \nThe Timbers scored all five goals in a 25-minute span in the second half and moved into a third-place tie with the Vancouver Whitecaps in the West. \nAdi made it 1-1 in the 65th minute with a turnaround left-footed strike from the middle of the box. Three minutes later, he converted from the spot to give Portland the lead for good. \nDiego Chara netted a leaping header to make it 3-1 in the 74th minute. The Galaxy's Robbie Keane closed the deficit in the 84th, but Darlington Nagbe answered with a breakaway goal 18 seconds after the ensuing kickoff. \nKeane gave the Galaxy the early lead in the 36th minute. The Galaxy would have clinched a berth in the conference semifinals with a win. Maximiliano Urruti capped the scoring in the 90th. \nThe Seattle Sounders eliminated the Dynamo from playoff contention after Obafemi Martins scored in the 82nd minute for a 1-1 draw in Houston. \nThe Sounders extended their undefeated streak to seven games, but missed a chance to clinch off a playoff spot. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T06:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T07:19:05.596+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
