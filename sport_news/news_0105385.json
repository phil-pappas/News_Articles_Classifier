But they had to make it through a little drama first to claim a 4-3 win and capture the American League’s berth in the World Series for a second straight season. Royals manager Ned Yost had it all planned out – then the rains came. With his team leading 3-1, he was going to bring Ryan Madson into the eighth inning, allow a brief shower to shut down play 20 minutes, then come back with closer Wade Davis. Leading 3-1, Yost summoned Madson from the bullpen to start the top of the eighth inning. He gave up an infield single to Ben Revere and then struck out Josh Donaldson. Jose Bautista, the man Royals fans love to hate, then slammed his second home run of the game, deep into the left-field seats to knot the score at 3-all. Yost had seen enough and brought in Wade Davis, who walked Edwin Encarnacion and then retired the next two batters before the skies opened the tarp was put on the infield. After a 44-minute delay, play was resumed in the bottom of the eighth inning and Davis was able to pitch out of that inning, setting up an ending that defies belief. The Royals put up the winning run in the bottom of the eighth when Lorenzo Cain singled off Blue Jays 20-year-old closer Roberto Osuna. Eric Hosmer, who is hitting .053 without runners on base and .348 with runners in scoring position in the postseason, then hit a line drive to right field. \"Mike (Jirschele, third base coach) told us that if the ball is hit to right, and Bautista throws to second, he's sending the runner home,\" said Cain, who scored from first on the single. \"It's a hustle play and shows that Mike does his homework.\" Jirschele, who was criticized for not sending Alex Gordon home in Game 7 of last year's World Series as the game ended with him stranded at third base, said, \"The minute Lo turned second I was sending him. \"He's so fast and they need a perfect throw (home) to get him. Lo made me look good tonight.\" Then, it was up to Davis, who took over the closer's role after Greg Holland went down late in the season following Tommy John surgery. \"Wade comes in and it's ball one, ball two and I'm thinking, 'That's not Wade Davis.' But that 45-minute rain delay is tough,\" Royals legend George Brett said. \"And what's he do? Gets the likely league MVP out to end the game.\" Russell Martin opened the ninth with a single. Dalton Pompey came in as a pinch runner and stole second and third with no outs. Davis walked Kevin Pillar, then struck out Dioner Navarro and leadoff man Ben Revere. Page 2 of 2 - With runners on second and third and Donaldson at the plate, Davis knew he had to get that final out. \"The last time I pitched after a rain delay, I think, was when I was starting with Tampa Bay and we had a rain delay against Boston,\" Davis said. \"I came out and I don't think I got out of the inning. \"I just knew I had to get that final out.\" Donaldson hit a ground ball to Mike Moustakas at third base and he threw across the diamond to Hosmer, who leaped in the air in celebration. The drama was over and the Royals were American League champions again. \"Moose makes the last out for the second year in a row to send the team to the World Series,\" Brett said. \"When I was playing, I'm saying, 'Hit it to anyone but me.' Moose wanted that ball hit to him.\" Solo home runs by Ben Zobrist (first) and Moustakas (second) gave the Royals a 2-0 lead. Moustakas’ blast was reviewed when a fan – Blue Springs South High School graduate Caleb Humphreys (see related story) – caught the ball as it crossed the fence. The umpires ruled there wasn’t enough evidence to overturn it. But the Jays came back to tie the game, setting up the dramatic eighth and ninth innings. \"This club has a lot of determination,\" Yost said. \"Toronto is dangerous in so many ways, and we found a way to win. \"We knew the rain was coming and we were hoping to get Madson through the eighth. That didn't happen, so we brought in Wade to hold them (at 3-3). Then the rain came and Wade did a great job keeping his arm warm, riding the bike, walking around, keeping warm. \"I talked to Holly (Holland) and he said, 'Wade's going to be fine. He wants to go to the World Series again.’ That gave me a little comfort, coming from a fellow closer. With those runners on second and third, Wade has that extra gear and boy, did he find it tonight.\" Brett was amazed. \"Anyone who saw this game,\" Royals Hall of Famer George Brett said, \"will call it one of the greatest games they have ever seen. The way we won it – Wade pitching in the ninth – amazing! I love this team!\" • Shortstop Alcides Escobar was named the ALCS MVP. He hit .478 and was flawless in the field. \"For me, it is a surprise,\" Escobar said. \"I know I am playing good and my team is playing good, but when I heard the news that I was the MVP I was happy and surprised. Going to World Series two years in a row is so exciting for me, my teammates and our fans.\" By Bill Althaus", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T09:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T16:42:59.869+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
