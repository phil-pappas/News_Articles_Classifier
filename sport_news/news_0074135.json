As she tapped each one, she pronounced the letters \"T-T-P-U,\" standing for \"Time to Pumpkin Up.\"\nIt was Tualatin's 12th annual West Coast Giant Pumpkin Regatta, and there were plenty of interesting characters gathered for the day's main event: Four races around the lake, with participants kneeling inside gigantic pumpkins and paddling their darndest.\n\"The more stupid, the more fun it is,\" said the winner of the first race, Mike Walton, of Aloha.\nThousands of people came and went Saturday, Oct. 17, to Tualatin Lake of the Commons. Swarms of children feasted their short attention spans on virtually limitless activities. Pumpkin bowling, wiffle golf, crafts, animal balloons, and more ensured everyone had something to do.\nThe adults also had time to play, but their toys required trackhoes and forklifts.\nVeined orange and tan behemoths, with stems thicker than a fist, were weighed one after another by the Pacific Giant Vegetable Grower association in its annual \"weigh-in.\"\nThe biggest one?\n1,794.5 pounds.\nTwenty-one giant pumpkins made it into the water, tops carved out and guts scooped out. Participants reported that paddling around a lake inside a giant pumpkin is not easy.\n\"It's brutal,\" said Larry Nelson, 50, who was second place to Walton. \"It's just exhausting.\"\nNelson, who is from Albany, looked to be the likely winner at the beginning of the race, far ahead of his competitors. But then he started going off to the side, and Walton came out ahead.\n\"Pumpkins aren't very aerodynamic in the water,\" Nelson said.\nOthers had an even tougher time of it. A man in the second race had to bail out of his pumpkin two minutes after starting because the vegetable started taking water.\nKyle Doyle, 23, decided he wasn't going to give up. All participants had to get balls from five baskets in the lake, and he swam to each one and got the balls, pumpkin in tow.\nThe MC of the event did offer some encouragement.\n\"I think I know who's gonna win 'Best Sport,\" he said to the hundreds of people gathered around the lake. \"Keep on swimmin' there, fella.\"\n-- Fedor Zarkhin\nfzarkhin@oregonian.com\n503-294-7674; @fedorzarkhin", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T01:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T12:17:21.950+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
