But the Boynton Beach native will make this weekend's trip with a heavy heart after the death of his friend Corey Jones, who was shot by a police officer Sunday in Palm Beach County . \nWilfork, a likely Hall of Famer who starred at Santaluces High School and the University of Miami, touched on that and various other topics during a conference call Wednesday with South Florida reporters. \n\"We're going to pray about it, and hopefully God answers our prayers,\" said Wilfork, who also posted a message about Jones' shooting on Twitter. \"But at this point and time all I want to do is show respect and let them know we're all thinking of him. \n\"This matter got attention around the nation, and it's something that really touched me very deeply. It's just sad.\" \nJones, a popular church drummer and the younger brother of ex-NFL wide receiver C.J. Jones, was shot early Sunday morning in Palm Beach Gardens. His car broke down off I-95 and he was approached by a plain-clothes officer in an unmarked car. Police say Corey Jones, 31, confronted the officer with a weapon and that's when the officer shot him. Star defensive tackle Vince Wilfork, who won two Super Bowls with the Patriots, says New England's front office told him it will not be picking up his option. He will become a free agent next week. \nWilfork said he plans to spend some time with Jones' family Saturday. \nThe 6-foot-2, 325-pound Wilfork, one of the NFL's most immoveable forces and best run-stuffers for more than a decade, is accustomed to making trips back to South Florida from his first 11 seasons in the league with the AFC East rival New England Patriots. Sunday's game could be the five-time Pro Bowler's last at Sun Life Stadium. \n\"Every time I come there it's always kind of special,\" Wilfork said, \"just knowing that that's basically in my backyard, growing up in Florida and playing for the University of Miami.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T02:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T02:30:29.663+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
