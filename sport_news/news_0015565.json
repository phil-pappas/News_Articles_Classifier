RSL suffered its 14th shutout defeat in 33 games this season. \nThe lone breakthrough came in the 57th minute, when Mauro Diaz's pass split Salt Lake center backs Aaron Maund and Elias Vasquez, and David Texeira let it roll into his path and inside the 18-yard box before blasting it over a diving Jeff Attinella. \n\"Really unacceptable,\" RSL coach Jeff Cassar said after the match. \"Two simple balls, two simple passes and it's in the back of our net. I think we tuned off for a half-second.\" \nRain began to fall just prior to the buildup that led to Texeira netting the game-winner, and it continued during the remainder of RSL's final league home match of the year. \nThe home side's playoff hopes had all-but washed away for the first time in seven seasons — a streak that was the longest in MLS — and any hope of victory in the regular-season finale was extinguished by RSL's anemic finishing. \nIn the 31st minute, Javier Morales played a picture-perfect ball off a free kick from the right edge of the 18 onto the head of Kyle Beckerman near the back post, but the RSL captain's header sailed over the crossbar from just 6 yards out. \nRSL continued to push forward in search of a first-half lead, and after a decent string of passes in front of the 18, the ball ricocheted fortuitously to Juan Manuel Martinez about 12 yards out, but his shot was saved in the 36th minute. Related FC Dallas clinches Western Conference with 1-0 win over RSL David Texeira scored and FC Dallas beat Real Salt Lake 1-0 on Saturday night to clinching the Western Conference title and a berth in the conference semifinals. FC Dallas (17-10-6) also is contention for the Supporters' Shield as the overall regular-season champion. \n\"I thought we got ourselves into good spots all night long,\" Cassar said. \"If it was a different time in the year you would say let's keep continuing to get in there and over a stretch of the year you'll get the results that you wanted. But obviously we're not in that.\" \nAfter dominating the opening 45 minutes, it seemed it was a matter of time before RSL would find a goal. Instead, RSL was left to rue missed opportunities. \n\"There's times in a game where you need to capitalize,\" Cassar said. \"Dallas was bending all over the place in the first half, but they didn't break. We didn't make them break, we didn't put it in the back of the net and we fell asleep on a play and we paid the price.\" \nOn a night that Beckerman broke the MLS record for appearances by a field player with the 379th in his 17 seasons, RSL \"created enough chances to score, to win,\" Cassar said. \nRSL still leads its Champions League group and can clinch a spot in the knockout stage with a draw or win Tuesday night against Guatemalan side Municipal.
