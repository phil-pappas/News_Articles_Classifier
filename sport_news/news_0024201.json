A bad loss.\nBut the Vikings defense saved their bacon against the one-win Kansas City Chiefs in a 16-10 victory that, if accompanied by music, would sound a lot like teeth grinding. Adrian Peterson’s numbers would have even less pretty if not for a 23-yard run in the third quarter.\nIt was painful to watch at times.\n“We knew coming into the game that we were playing against a physical group,” Peterson said. “It was going to be a good challenge for us.”\nThey certainly got their money’s worth. One play in the fourth quarter highlighted their tough sledding.\nClinging to a 13-10 lead with five minutes remaining, the Vikings faced a third-and-1 at the Kansas City 27-yard line.\nPeterson was on the sideline with a jammed finger and because Matt Asiata had given the offense a little spark.\nBridgewater faked a handoff and rolled to his right. Tight end Rhett Ellison was wide open for what looked like a simple pitch and catch.\nBut Bridgewater said linebacker Justin Houston got enough pressure to disrupt his touch, and the pass sailed high and incomplete.\nThe Vikings still got points on Blair Walsh’s 45-yard field goal, but they failed to put the game on ice, which might have come back to bite them against a better opponent.\n“That’s the play that I’m most upset about,” Bridgewater said. “Wish I could have thrown a better ball.”\nBridgewater’s performance was uneven in the absence of a viable running game. He passed for 249 yards and showed nice chemistry with rookie Stefon Diggs. Their 30-yard connection on third-and-15 in the fourth quarter was one of those game-defining plays that coaches and players often reference.\nBut Bridgewater also missed some throws he normally makes, and his two interceptions kept the game closer than it needed to be.\nHis interception in the end zone on the opening drive was a poor decision. He tried to squeeze a pass to Kyle Rudolph in traffic on what should have been a throwaway.\nHis interception early in the fourth quarter was more a product of an alert defensive play than a poor decision or throw.\nRookie cornerback Marcus Peters made a smart read by peeling off his coverage to jump Bridgewater’s pass to Mike Wallace.\n“A great play by him,” Bridgewater said.\nAs limited as the Chiefs are on offense, their defense — particularly their front seven — gave the Vikings fits in terms of establishing their identity.\nPeterson had nowhere to run. Twelve of his 26 carries went for either no gain or negative yards. The Chiefs kept Peterson hemmed in the backfield, resulting in one negative run after another.\n“I tell you, [defensive end Allen Bailey] grabbed me one time and slung me down,” Peterson said. “I was able to feel the force that he has. That guy is extremely strong.”\nThe Vikings offensive line lost its matchup decisively. They struggled to open even a sliver of running room for Peterson, who averaged only 2.3 yards per carry.\n“I was telling those guys, if you get knocked down, get back up and hit them in the face and knock them down,” he said.\nPeterson didn’t disclose too many details about his jammed finger, other than it happened early in the game. He didn’t sound concerned.\nIf anything, he said his body feels refreshed after the bye, though it was hard to know since he kept running into a brick wall.\n“You look at the yards and you wouldn’t think that [I’m] satisfied or happy with how thing played out,” he said. “But I am.”\nHappy because they won on a day when he was rendered ineffective and his quarterback made a few costly mistakes.\nThat’s not a script they should follow too often.\nChip Scoggins chip.scoggins@startribune.com", "external_links": ["http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_144521318624380.jpg?w=263"], "published": "2015-10-19T03:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T13:39:35.013+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
