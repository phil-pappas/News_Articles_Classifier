NASCAR will implement a low-downforce package that showed promise in for improving the quality of racing in races at Darlington (shown) and Kentucky. Matt Hazlett Getty Images i Order Reprint of this Story \nIn a move it hopes will improve the quality of racing, NASCAR announced Wednesday a low-downforce aerodynamic package for the all the events except those at Talladega, Ala., and Daytona Beach, Fla., in the 2016 season. \nThe package will include a 3.5-inch spoiler, a .25-inch front leading splitter edge and a 33-inch wide radiator pan. Combined, those tweaks might add up to more exciting and competitive racing, according to Steve O’Donnell, NASCAR’s executive vice president and chief racing development officer. \n“This is where we want to go,” said O’Donnell. “It’s a step in the right direction for us and we’ll never stop. We’ll take this to 36 (events) in 2016 and then evolve into 2017.” \nNASCAR has taken criticism in recent years for what has been perceived for a lack of exciting racing, with passing hard to come by. Drivers, for instance, complained Sunday after they had problems passing during the Bank of America 500 at Charlotte Motor Speedway. \nNASCAR has been experimenting with the rules changes this season, using the low downforce package at races with success at Darlington (S.C.) International Speedway and Kentucky Speedway. \nHigh draft packages were used at Michigan International Speedway and Indianapolis Motor Speedway, where the quality of the racing was not as high. \nThe spoiler in 2016’s regular package – which will continue to be used through the end of the season – is 6 inches high. \nThe lower downforce package will allow drivers to stay off the throttle more and slow their speeds in the corners, generating more passing zones over the track and multiple tire combinations. \nEach track will also still feature its own package, more aimed at tires and gear ratios. \nO’Donnell also announced several safety updates for the 2016 season, including a double air duct at the right-hand side window, a fire suppression activation system routed to the dash or right-hand side leg board, and a seat belt system that meets higher standards. \nO’Donnell said that a digital dashboard will be mandatory on Cup cars in 2016. He said new aerodynamic packages for NASCAR’s Xfinity and Truck series will be considered for the future.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T22:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T01:21:21.779+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
