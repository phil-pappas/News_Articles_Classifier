Evan Turner finished with 10 points, seven assists and five rebounds in his first action of the preseason. The Celtics played their first game in the U.S. and against an NBA team after opening exhibition play with two victories in Europe. Thaddeus Young had 19 points and eight rebounds for Brooklyn. CELTICS: Jae Crowder, Kelly Olynyk and rookie R.J. Hunter finished with 11 points apiece. NETS: Shane Larkin got the start at point guard and scored 10 points. Brook Lopez scored 12 but took just six shots. JACK'S HACK: Point guard Jarrett Jack was ejected in the second quarter for a flagrant foul. He turned the ball over, then raced back to throw his shoulder into Jonas Jerebko to prevent a fast-break basket. SMART SICK: Coach Brad Stevens said second-year guard Marcus Smart has strep throat and probably wouldn't be available for the Celtics' game at the Knicks on Friday. UP NEXT: The Celtics remain in New York to face the Knicks on Friday. The Nets host Philadelphia on Sunday. capecodtimes.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T07:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T16:35:15.334+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
