Riley, averaging 182 yards a game, nearly had that amount in the first half when he racked up 176 yards and two touchdown. \n“All the credit goes to the O line,” Riley said after his standout performance. “They open things up. I look for the openings and the holes. We practiced all week on facing this tough Lebanon defensive line.” \nCoach Anthony Hays said Riley’s performance was “Riley being Riley.” \n“He not only leads on the field but did you see him on the sidelines? He’s getting people up. He’s a leader,” Hays said. \nRiley showed off his talent when it was needed the most, late in the game when Lebanon looked to be turning the tide and putting together a rally. \nAfter a Lebanon score cut the lead to 35-28 with 4:56 left in the game Parkview took the ball on its own 20 and handed it to Riley on five of its seven offensive plays before he scored his final touchdown of the night on a 2-yard plunge. \nEarlier in the quarter, a Lebanon touchdown by quarterback Luke Winfrey cut the lead to 27-21 with 8:22 left, but Parkview took the ball from its own 20 and scored in three plays, ending with a thrilling 58-yard run by Chaviz Nyguen, who raced down the right sideline and veered across the entire width of the field to beat the Lebanon defense to the end zone. \nOn the first possession of the game, Parkview dodged a bullet when an 11-play Yellowjackets drive came to a sudden stop when Lebanon fumbled on the Parkview 22 and the Vikings recovered. \nParkview took the turnover and drove 78 yards for its first score, a 13-yard run by Riley. \nBut Lebanon (5-4) scored twice in the next 22 seconds to take the lead, scoring on the first play of its possession, a 72-yard run by Brandon Horsley, who took a pitch, ran around left end and scampered down the sideline for the score. \nOn the ensuing kickoff, Parkview’s receivers bobbled a handoff and Lebanon recovered on Parkview’s 3. It took Lebanon on play — a 3-yard run by Adrian Palmer — to put Lebanon ahead with 1:22 left in the first half. Lebanon would not score again until early in the fourth quarter. \nParkview responded with a 9-play drive and scored on a 9-yard run by Riley to tie the ballgame. Parkview then took Lebanon’s first punt of the game at its own 32 and put together a 4-play drive, highlighted by a 61-yard run by Nyguen to take a 20-14 lead. \nIt looked like Lebanon was going to score just before halftime, but Lebanon quarterback Luke Winfrey fumbled at the goal line and Parkview recovered. 49 CONNECT 3 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://sgfnow.co/1RNFuw9 TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T07:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T09:40:38.934+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
