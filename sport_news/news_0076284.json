(USATSI) Update at 8:49 p.m. ET: The NCAA has clarified the situation and say that Leonard Fournette will indeed be allowed to auction off his jersey for the South Carolina flood victims. \n\nLeonard Fournette can auction his jersey for SC flood victims.\n— NCAA (@NCAA) October 11, 2015 Original Story: \nLeonard Fournette had another stellar performance on Saturday against South Carolina with 158 yards and a touchdown on 20 carries. He tied 10 others as the fastest in FBS history to reach 1,000 yards, doing so in five games . \nDespite all of those accomplishments, Fournette's best moment on Saturday came after the game when he read a touching letter to the flood victims of South Carolina in his on-field postgame interview. \n\nWow. Leonard Fournette says he's auctioning off his game jersey to help out SC flood victims pic.twitter.com/mWQiMJfQWU \n— Barstool Sports (@barstoolsports) October 10, 2015 \n\n\"I want to send my prayers, condolences and empathy to the people of South Carolina,\" said Fournette. \"It reminds me of what we went through, my people of New Orleans went through, 10 years ago in Hurricane Katrina. We played the game today, but the people of South Carolina right now are in need. I would like to auction off my game jersey, as is, to the highest bidder to help with the relief efforts. People of Louisiana not only care, but know what you in South Carolina are going through.\"\nDespite Fournette's good intentions of auctioning his jersey for the benefit of the people of South Carolina, he said later in the locker room that he was told the NCAA won't let him do it. \n\n#LSU RB Leonard Fournette says the NCAA will not allow him to auction his jersey for the SC flooding relief. \"Violation,\" he said.\n— Ross Dellenger (@DellengerAdv) October 10, 2015 \nI would hope the NCAA would reconsider that ruling, or circumvent the rules by having LSU auction off the jersey -- or all the jerseys from today's game -- for charity rather than Fournette doing it himself, because it's a great gesture for a great cause. \n\nTopics: Leonard Fournette , SEC , LSU Tigers , South Carolina Gamecocks , NCAAF", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T02:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T04:05:41.925+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
