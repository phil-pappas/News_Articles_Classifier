The Red Wings scored three goals in the third period Saturday, including two by Teemu Pulkkinen to down the Hurricanes 4-3. Panthers backup G Al Montoya will receive his first start of the season because of the back-to-backs. Montoya, who was 6-7-2 with a 3.01 GAA last season, is 0-2-1 with a 2.56 GAA against Carolina. The Hurricanes will go with their backup in net as well as Eddie Lack is expected to start over Cam Ward, who's 0-2 with a 3.08 GAA this season. Lack, who was acquired from the Canucks during the draft last June, is 1-0 with a 2.77 GAA vs. Florida. The Panthers used three different goalies in three wins over the Hurricanes last season by a combined 9-1 score, including two shutouts. The Hurricanes, who finished last in the Metropolitan Division last season with just 71 points, have added former Panthers wing Kris Versteeg and D James Wisniewski. However, Wisniewski tore his ACL in the season opener and is out for at least six months. Carolina was ranked 27th in scoring last season as they were paced by captain C Eric Staal with just 54 points, the same modest point total that Jonathan Huberdeau led the Panthers with.\n-Harvey Fialkov\n Florida Panthers James Wisniewski Eddie Lack Al Montoya Kris Versteeg Cam Ward Eric Staal", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-561c1063/turbine/fl-florida-panthers-hurricanes-preview-1013-20151012"], "published": "2015-10-12T20:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T12:18:29.078+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
