Jared Goff debuted for the Bears, throwing for 2,016 yards, nine touchdowns and six interceptions in his first six games. He has since blossomed into one of the best college quarterbacks in the country, and a likely NFL first-round pick. \nThursday at 6 p.m., he’ll stand across the field from UCLA freshman Josh Rosen. The Bruins quarterback has already seen more team success than Goff did en route to a 1-11 record in 2013. Rosen’s stats measure up too: 1,569 yards, 12 scores and seven picks. \n“I think they’re really similar,” Dykes said. “I think Josh has a big arm like Jared had. Josh is pretty far along developed, physically. He’s a strong kid. he has good size. What makes those guys special is his demeanor. … I think that’s what allowed Jared to win the job as a freshman.” \nAsked this summer about what it takes to play quarterback as a true freshman, Goff said: every time I’m on the field, I think I’m the best player on the field. You have to as a quarterback. That’s the kind of mentality you have to have.” \nRosen certainly isn’t lacking in confidence. After UCLA’s 56-35 loss at No. 10 Stanford last Thursday, he cited his frustration at not being able to make a bigger statement — then promised an encore against the Cardinal. \n“We’ll face them again in the Pac-12 Championship game,” he said. \nStanford (5-1, 4-0) is the only Pac-12 team that has not yet lost to a conference opponent. With six games left, UCLA (4-2, 1-2) is fourth in the Pac-12 South. Breast cancer awareness \nTo help promote breast cancer awareness, Mora said that relatives of players and staff who have been affected by the disease will serve as honorary captains Thursday. \nMora’s grandmother died of breast cancer, and his mother is a two-time survivor. UCLA will also have pink ribbons printed on their helmets, but won’t otherwise supplement its all-black alternate uniforms with any additional flourishes. \n“The pink towels, the pink shoes, the pink wristbands — to me, sometimes it becomes more about the fashion than the cause,” Mora said. “The cause is breast cancer awareness, not looking good in pink.” Adams won’t miss more games \nUCLA does not have plans to further discipline defensive back Ishmael Adams, charged on Monday with misdemeanor battery. Advertisement \nThe redshirt junior had been suspended indefinitely following his Aug. 30 arrest on suspicion of robbery, one in which he was alleged to have stolen a cell phone from an Uber driver. After three games, the Bruins reinstated Adams when the Los Angeles district attorney declined to file felony charges. \nAsked if Adams’ status with the team has changed in lieu of the misdemeanor charge, Mora said: “No, sir.” \nA conviction could result in a fine of up to $2,000, and/or six months in county jail.
