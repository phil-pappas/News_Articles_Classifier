However, the police today said a watertight case was being prepared against the suspended official. Gurjit Kaur, wife of the Assistant Superintendent of Police, claimed her husband had earned several appreciation letters for his work but all hell broke loose ever since he exposed the scam. Bhullar is slated to appear before a special investigation team (SIT) to furnish documents showing his good conduct during service. The ASP was to earlier appear before the SIT on October 3, but his wife alleged the Faridkot police registered a fresh drug case the same day to prevent him from producing documents that proved his innocence. “My husband had accused the jail higher-ups of bypassing the mandatory tender process while procuring ration and other goods for canteens. If the due process was followed, the essential items could have reached the inmates at half the price,” she said. She claimed Bhullar had first confided about the alleged irregularities in Deputy Inspector General (Jails) Lakhminder Singh Jakhar in 2013. She alleged instead of being appreciated, her husband was “punished with frequent transfers”. Jakhar, however, claimed Bhullar was trying to mislead the investigations by raising the ration issue. “He has already submitted documents linked to his disclosures about the Rs 97 crore ration scam in the High Court. We too are in the process of submitting relevant record before the state information commission. “The Jail Canteen Rules 1965 mandate a jail SP, welfare officer or jail committee to buy canteen supplies without following the tendering process. Since the jails started buying supplies from an international chain, Metro Store, canteen sales have gone up three to four times,” he said. Following directions from the High Court, Bhullar had joined investigations before the SIT on September 26. The three-member SIT is headed by Kapurthala SP (Investigation) Jagjit Singh Saroya while DSP Sarabjit Rai and CIA in charge Ravinder Singh are its other members. Saroya said, “The SIT will conduct investigations into the case registered against Bhullar for supplying drugs in Kapurthala jail and extorting money from inmates. Eleven inmates have recorded their statement against Bhullar under Section 164 of the CrPC.” In their statement before the court under Section 164 of CrPC, the inmates alleged that Bhullar was regularly supplying drugs to Pargat Singh, a prisoner undergoing 12-year imprisonment in a drug smuggling case. Pargat was further selling and distributing these to the addicts in the jail, alleged the inmates. Sources said with Bhullar’s interrogation, the SIT was hopeful of getting information about the network running drug racket in jails in which some prisoners and jail officials too were involved. A large number of drug addicts in the jails are getting the drugs from this racket at premium rates and the price for these drugs supplied within the jail are paid by the family members of the addicts to some specific bank accounts, operating in the name of the relatives of the drug suppliers, it is learnt.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T12:33:27.197+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
