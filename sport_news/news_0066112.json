America's Greatest Homecoming Game: A glance at the homecoming games from the Cowboys' greatest seasons Sam Grubenhoff, Sports Reporter, @GHoff17 The O'Colly \nOklahoma State is 6-0 for only the sixth time in the history of the program, and although all of those teams went on to have a fair amount of success, how did they fare on homecoming weekend? \nWith the 2015 homecoming game against Kansas quickly approaching, the O’Colly looked back at what those Cowboy teams were able to accomplish on Stillwater’s biggest holiday. \nNov. 10, 1945 \nOklahoma A&M 12, Tulsa 6 \nThe Aggies, as they were then known, came into the game ranked No. 11 by the Associated Press and were looking to continue their winning ways against No. 19 Tulsa. Led by coach Jim Lookabaugh and star halfback Bob Fenimore, the Aggies pulled out their most impressive win of the season to that point. Fenimore was the team’s offense in game, throwing a 63-yard touchdown pass to Bill Grimes and returning a punt to the 11-yard line before lateralling the ball to teammate Neil Amstrong, who took it the rest of the way for the game-sealing score. \nOct. 11, 1997 \nOklahoma State 33, Colorado 29 \nBob Simmons coached the No. 20 Cowboys to their first 5-0 start since 1987 as the team headed into its homecoming game against 24th-ranked Colorado. Trailing late in the fourth quarter, Cowboys defensive back Maurice Simpson snagged an interception that set up Tony Lindsay’s 19-yard game-winning touchdown pass to Alonzo Mayes two plays later. \nOct. 18, 2008 \nOklahoma State 34, Baylor 6 \nIn Mike Gundy’s fourth year as coach of the Cowboys, the eighth-ranked team looked to continue its streak of dominating performances against Robert Griffin III and unranked Baylor. The Cowboys delivered. Baylor scored early in the first quarter and never reached the end zone again, while Dez Bryant caught two Zac Robinson touchdown passes in the second quarter and Dan Bailey nailed two short field goals in the third to put the final nails in Baylor’s coffin. \nOct. 23, 2010 \nNebraska 51, Oklahoma State 41 \nComing off a 34-17 victory over Texas Tech, Brandon Weeden and the No. 17 Cowboys were looking for an upset victory over No. 14 Nebraska. Despite a 201-yard, two-touchdown effort by halfback Kendall Hunter, the Cowboys never held a lead in the second half and could not contain Nebraska quarterback Taylor Martinez, who had 435 total yards and five touchdowns. \nOct. 29, 2011 \nOklahoma State 59, Baylor 24 \nAfter Joseph Randle punched the ball into the end zone with 13:10 remaining in the third quarter, No. 3 Oklahoma State led Baylor 42-0. The day never got any better for the Bears as all three of their touchdowns were scored in garbage time, and Heisman candidate Robert Griffin was intercepted twice. The Cowboys’ rushing attack picked up 333 yards and five touchdowns; quarterback Brandon Weeden added three more touchdowns through the air, including two to 2010 and 2011 Biletnikoff winner Justin Blackmon.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T00:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T01:26:44.660+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
