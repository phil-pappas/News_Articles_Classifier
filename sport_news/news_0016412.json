There are no good guys.\nThe game has become, to outsiders at least, the ultimate passion play. It is Good vs. Evil, the definition of good and evil depending on the color of the 17 team jerseys you’ve bought over the years.\nIf your colors are the ones of patriotism — red, white and blue with a hint of silver on top — then the Colts are the football version of the Evil Empire. They deflated the game on the Patriots and smeared the good name of the Mother Teresa of Football, Tom Brady. That’s the way you see it.\nWe hate them because they exist. We hate them because they once employed Peyton Manning. We hate them because they once employed Bill Polian. We even hate them because they once employed Johnny Unitas back when all of New England was made up of Giants fans. We hate them because they’re them.\nMost of all, we hate them because of Deflategate, which we believe was the football version of Hillary Clinton’s vast left-wing conspiracy against all things that are good for America, which in our case is seeing the Patriots dominate. After all, aren’t we all Patriots today, as the Patriots’ owner once claimed?\nWe don’t necessarily need a reason to hate the Colts and for most of the time Bill Belichick and Tom Brady have been beating up the Colts they didn’t give us one, but we did it anyway. Now they’ve made it easier.\nWe see our left rear tire is under inflated and we think “I hate Ryan Grigson.” We notice our kid’s soccer ball that’s been out in the backyard for a month and has gone soft and think “I hate Roger Goodell.”\nAs we pack to make a weekend trip to Indianapolis, we carefully fold our new Patriots game jersey we plan to unveil Sunday night at Lucas Oil Stadium. The one with the name on the back that reads: “I Hate He.” He, of course, is the Colts.\nNow, if you happen to be a Hoosier and grew up way down yonder in a field of corn you view things differently. To you the colors of patriotism run true blue and pure white. You believe a horse shoe brings you Luck and Luck would bring you to the Super Bowl if it weren’t for that damn Brady.\nThis Luck, being the one named Andrew, is 0-4 against the Patriots however and often has looked like a guy not only without any luck but also like a guy without any clue when he faced the Patriots. This is irksome if you are a Hoosier, so to all you in blue and white the Patriots are the Evil Empire.\nThey cheat. They trash talk. They rob from widows and orphans. Lock up the women and children — not to mention the footballs and air pumps — when these guys come to town.\nThey are not Patriots to the people of Indianapolis. They are marauders coming into Lucas Oil Stadium with bad intentions and evil purposes on their mind. They are coming to deflate you.\nThe beauty of Sunday night’s game then is that evil will exist on both sidelines, depending on your point of view. One will wear a hoodie, like those guys you see in grainy security camera pictures robbing a 7-Eleven. The other will wear a shaggy beard that makes him look like he joined the Taliban not the Colts.\nYou hate Indianapolis and Indianapolis hates you. If you grew up in New England it’s the way you like your sports. Your guys are good. Their guys suck. All you have to do is squeeze your kid’s Nerf ball to remind you why. Soft balls.\nIf this was New York, this all would be easier to understand of course. Everybody hates New Yawkers, but who outside of the good pilgrims in New England hates Indiana?\nAll week the talk around here has been not simply that the favored Patriots will beat the Colts to push their record to an unblemished 5-0. It’s that the Patriots are obsessed with beating them 500-0. Deflate that, Grigson!\nFortunately, as the players keep trying to tell a media horde less willing to listen to reason than Roger Goodell, that isn’t how Tom Brady & Associates view it. Do they want to score every time they have the ball? Yes they do. But they wanted to against Jacksonville too and who hates Jacksonville? Only Northerners who go there and spend too much time out in the sun.\nIn fact, Tom Brady did score every time he had the ball against Jacksonville, going a perfect 9-for-9 before it was time to take a knee and then a bow. What have they ever deflated but their own fans’ hopes?\nWednesday, Brady clearly grew annoyed as media members kept asking him if revenge was on his mind. Thankfully, the Colts’ secondary is instead, but nobody believes him. Finally he was asked if he wasn’t human enough to want to win this game “a little extra” this week.\nBrady looked at his inquisitor as if he thought he’d just been released from a loony bin before confirming he was, indeed, human. As for the “extra” part, not hardly.\nDoes Brady hate the Colts? Probably not. His thoughts on Ryan Grigson, if he even knows who he is, might be different but Grigson isn’t the problem Sunday. The problem is an opponent that has, by hook or by crook, won three straight games and has a couple of dangerous weapons in a healthy Luck (if such a thing exists) and receiver T.Y. Hilton.\nAre they enough to beat the Patriots? Please.\nSo why hate them?\nBecause this is New England, a place where if you’re not mad about something you’re not awake.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T07:18:41.547+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
