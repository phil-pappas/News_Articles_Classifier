They have a good fullback and several good receivers. They always play Mount View tough and we're expecting another tough game this Saturday.” \nIn the Maine Principals' Association Crabtree Point Standings for Class D North, Mount View (5-2, 123.9714 points) is third, while Maine Central Institute (7-0, 148.2143 points) is first in the 12-team region.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T02:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T02:31:30.111+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
