But receiver Kevin White, the Bears’ first-round pick, was spotted doing on-the-field work for the first time since training camp in Bourbonnais on Thursday.\n“They are continuing to rehab,” coach John Fox said. “The training staff, they’ve been doing a lot of indoor work. Now, he’s progressing to where he can get on the grass a little bit. He’s not been activated.”\nAt this point, it’s uncertain if White, who had a rod inserted in left shin to repair a stress fracture on Aug. 23, ever will be this season. The Bears have no issues if White misses the entire season if it’s best for him in the long term.\nWhite must miss the first six games this season since he’s on the physically-unable-to-perform list. After that, he can practice up 21 days before Week 11. The Bears must make a decision whether to activate White before or when that 21-day period concludes.\n“I know he’s made good progress,” Fox said. “We’ll just cross that bridge when we get to it.”\nWhite will begin traveling with the team soon, but the objective is to get him acquainted with the team’s routine. Fox, of course, won’t say whether White is ahead of schedule. But White last practiced with the Bears during the offseason program.\n“I don’t like putting schedules and timelines [on injuries],” Fox said. “[It’s] just kind of day to day.”\nFollow me on Twitter @adamjahns\nEmail: ajahns@suntimes.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T02:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T15:39:49.219+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
