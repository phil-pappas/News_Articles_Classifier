As I said, many matches won on this court as well helps me to be more comfortable starting the match and playing in it, as well.\"\nMurray, another two-time winner at Shanghai's Qi Zhong Stadium, also zipped past Steve Johnson 6-2, 6-4 and French Open champion Wawrinka beat Viktor Troicki 7-6 (7/3), 6-3.\nCombustible Kyrgios\nAfter Roger Federer's shock loss to 70th-ranked Albert Ramos-Vinolas late on Tuesday, there were no banana-skins for Djokovic, Wawrinka or Murray, who was returning to action following a four-week break.\nOutspoken Australian Nick Kyrgios flirted with a 28-day ban after he was slapped with his second code violation in as many matches during his 1-6, 6-4, 6-4 loss to Japan's Kei Nishikori.\nBut Australian number one Bernard Tomic reached the third round when he beat David Ferrer 6-4, 6-2 -- denting the Spaniard's hopes of reaching the World Tour Finals in London.\nFederer complained that he found it tough to adapt to the Shanghai conditions after the defending champion went out to Ramos-Vinolas, but Murray said he had arrived early enough to acclimatise.\n\"I think it's not so much that the conditions are really tricky here, it's that they're quite different to Beijing and Tokyo. All of the players say that,\" said the 2010 and 2011 champion.\n\"It does take a bit of time to get used to the conditions here. But for me, that was a big positive in getting here early this year, that I've had five days to get used to it.\"\nKyrgios was again at the centre of controversy when he received a code violation for smacking away a loose ball and nearly hitting a line judge -- a day after he was fined $1,500 for an audible obscenity.\nIf the 20-year-old totals $5,000 in fines by February 24 he will trigger the 28-day suspended ban he received in August for making a sexual comment about Stan Wawrinka's girlfriend.\nBut Kyrgios, who sparred with umpire Mohamed Lahyani in yet another combustible display, insisted he wasn't concerned about a potential ban, even with the Australian Open looming in January.\n\"Not concerned at all. If it happens, it happens,\" shrugged the world number 32, adding: \"I probably shouldn't have done it. But I didn't think it was too bad. I don't know, can't really change it now.\"\n(For more sports news and updates, follow Ahram Online Sports on Twitter at @AO_Sports and on Facebook at AhramOnlineSports .)", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/AO_Sports", "https://www.facebook.com/AhramOnlineSports?fref=ts"], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T18:48:26.309+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
