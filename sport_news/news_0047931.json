Pele, Brazilian legend and 3-time World Cup winner, has stated that Lionel Messi is the world's best, ahead of Cristiano Ronaldo. \nWhile on a trip in India , Pele was pressed about the great debate as to who is the best player in the world between the prolific goal scoring talents. \nThe #legend \"On behalf of all the Brazilians from home, I thank you for this warm welcome.\" #Pele #PeleinIndia pic.twitter.com/EYqZynyrbY \n— Atlético de Kolkata (@atletidekolkata) October 12, 2015 Messi, who is currently out with a knee injury, was named the best player in Europe in August . Pele would not go as far as ranking them on an all-time list as he did not want to compare either Ronaldo or Messi to past players. \n“But, of course, in the last ten years, Messi was the best player,” Pele said.\n“Lot of people compare Messi with Ronaldo. But they are two different kind of players. Roanldo is more [of a] scorer...more [of a] center forward. Messi plays more deeper. But both are fantastic.\" \nHe did not do as fellow Brazilian Roberto Carlos did. The former Real Madrid man said Neymar was the best . \nWho is your choice for the best player at the moment? \n\nPele picks Messi as the best in the world.
