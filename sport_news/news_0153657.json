CAAHEP, in cooperation with the Committee on Accreditation of Polysomnographic Technologist Education (CoA PSG) and the American Association of Sleep Technologists (AAST) and the Board of Registered Polysomnographic Technologists, works to maintain and promote nationally recognized standards of excellence for education programs in Polysomnographic Technology. \"This accreditation shows that upon completion of the Polysomnography program at COD, students will have the knowledge and skills needed to successfully enter the field of polysomnography,\" said Polysomnography Program Director Melissa Henry. The 24-credit hour program includes classroom instruction two days a week and clinical practice at sleep centers two days a week. Training occurs at night for clinical practice and in the evening for classroom instruction. Henry said the accreditation is for a period of five years and indicates the program meets or exceeds the standards set forth by the CAAHEP. She also said that graduates will be immediately eligible to sit for the National Board for Registered Polysomnographic Technician's exam and will be recognized by healthcare companies and sleep laboratories as being well-prepared. \"Employers know graduates of an accredited program are competent with the knowledge and skills needed to be successful healthcare professionals,\" said Henry.
