Douglas has been fantastic defensively for the Bolts and in this matchup he will be called upon to stop all three Bridgeton backs. Basil Williams has seen the majority of the carries and is coming off a three-touchdown performance against Lower Cape May. Revell Williams has shown big-play potential by racking up 345 yards on just 21 carries this season while Daquan Soloman can fill in at any time. Millville CB Marcial Ramos (5-9, 152) vs. Bridgeton WR Markquese Bell (6-4, 215). Even though the Bulldogs like to run the ball, Bell is the best weapon on offense. Bell has tallied 320 yards on 24 receptions this year and can be dangerous in the ground game when called upon. Ramos has been effective on the outside for Millville and must try to contain Bell as best as possible. It’s hard to bottle him up, but preventing big plays will go a long way towards a win. Millville QB Will Polhamus (6-2, 210) vs. Bridgeton QB David Mosley (5-10, 170). Both quarterbacks aren’t afraid to air things out to make things happen, but each has the capacity for turnovers too. Polhamus threw a winning 67-yard touchdown late in the fourth quarter against Ocean City last week, but also misfired on three interceptions. Mosley has connected with Bell for six passing touchdowns, but he also has six interceptions on the season. Cutting down on turnovers will be important for both quarterbacks. \nKeys to the Game Millville has to control the running game. Both teams have improved their running attacks in recent weeks and controlling the pace of play will be important. Clayton Scott has emerged as the go-to runner for Millville over the last two weeks. He has rushed for 253 yards during Millville’s two-game winning streak. Repeating that kind of success and stopping Bridgeton's rushing game will be paramount. Millville cannot fall behind. Playing with the lead is always a good thing, but it also helps make an opponent one-dimensional. The Bridgeton offense can struggle at times if they are asked to throw more often than they are running. Allowing the Bulldogs to maintain the lead and play it safe on the ground will only make things tougher for the Millville defense, which will have to account for a lot of different playmakers. The Millville defense must keep showing up. The Bolts intercepted four passes against Ocean City’s Andrew Marcucci and allowed fewer than 100 total yards defensively. Another dominant performance like that would make this game a sure-fire win. However, Bell presents a big matchup concern and it will be interesting to see how Millville prepares for him. If they allow it to alter their game plan too much, it could cause major problems. \nPrediction", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T23:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T04:09:59.785+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
