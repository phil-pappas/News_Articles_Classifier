Instead, the physicality is expected from up and down the lineup, no matter players’ size or fight history.\n“That’s just part of the right way to play,” Vigneault said after Monday’s practice in Westchester. “I think we’re one of those teams that does it the right way.”\nTanner Glass and Dylan McIlrath are the two most pugilistic players on the roster, and both are set to be healthy scratches as the Blackhawks raise their championship banner at the United Center, their third in the past six years. Although the Rangers will be in the visitors’ dressing room when the ceremony takes place, it’s still a reminder of how close they have come in the past four seasons, reaching the conference finals three times.\n“I don’t think we can get caught up in looking long-term,” Vigneault said. “On a personal note, I don’t need that motivation.”\nWhat can be beneficial is to look at how the Blackhawks have been built, and that is without a big-time physical presence in their lineup. Viktor Stalberg, for one, was part of their 2013 Stanley Cup-winning team, and signed this offseason with the Rangers.\nThe 29-year-old Swede is an offensively talented winger, but at 6-foot-3, 210 pounds, he’s also a big body and a physical presence on the ice. He said it’s just recently that he’s really learned how to use that to his advantage.\n“The longer my career has gone on, I’ve realized that the more physical you get, the more the puck seems to follow you around out there,” Stalberg said. “You finish your checks, create turnovers, and in the long run, you get rewarded. Sometimes it’s tiring at first, but for some reason, when you keep being physical, it seems like you get rewarded some way later in the game.”\nStalberg will start on a line with Oscar Lindberg at center and J.T. Miller on the left. Miller bringing his own brand of physicality and skill. It was a line put together near the end of training camp, as Kevin Hayes was moved out of the middle and up to the right wing on a line with Chris Kreider and Derek Stepan.\nThose combinations leave a top line of Rick Nash-Derick Brassard-Mats Zuccarello, where play-making abilities abound, but not without a touch of grit coming from Nash and Zuccarello. The fourth line will at least start with Dominic Moore moving out of center and to the wing, with new addition Jarret Stoll taking over the role as the pivot and Jesper Fast — nicknamed “Quickie” — playing on the right.\nAs Vigneault was quick to point out, almost all the lines have some sense of hard-nosed play.\n“I think we have guys like that on all our lines,” Vigneault said. “Mats Zuccarello might not be the biggest player, but he goes out, and when he’s got an opportunity to play the body, he does. Rick Nash is the same way, Kreids is the same way. Kevin Hayes is a big body, you have Stalberg there, you have J.T. that can be physical. Quickie never slides by an opportunity to hit someone.”\nWith Stalberg having his four-year, $12 million contract bought out by the Predators this offseason, it was clear since the beginning of training camp he was hungry to prove himself. In his second preseason game, Sept. 22 in Philadelphia, Stalberg leveled a Flyers’ player who had come a little too close to goalie Henrik Lundqvist. It made the point that he’s not going to be a bystander when a bit of aggressiveness is needed.\n“One of the things that caught our attention right off the hop is that he never slides by an opportunity to take a guy out,” Vigneault said. “He would finish his checks. That’s an important part of forechecking, it’s an important part of wearing the opposition down. It’s something that he did, and I’m confident that he’s going to continue to do.”\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google Whatsapp Email Filed under alain vigneault ,  new york rangers ,  viktor stalberg", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T00:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T05:34:38.281+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
