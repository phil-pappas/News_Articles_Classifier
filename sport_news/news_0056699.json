By Jocelyn Sheets Newton Daily News \nIn the grueling 400-meter freestyle race, it was Madeline against Madelyn. Sophomore Madeline Webb was in the water for NCMP just a bit behind Madelyn Kickland of Atlantic in the next lane. \nKickland led the race most of the way as Webb would surge forward to pull even or just ahead then Kickland would regain a small lead. With about 35 meters left in the race, Webb made her final move and stayed in front coming off the final turn. \n“My endurance is strong, so I believed in myself to have the kick at the end to beat the girl next to me,” Webb said after Thursday’s home meet. “My legs were tired in the last 50 meters, but I just told myself not to hold back.” \nWebb claimed first place in the 400 in 5 minutes, 8.80 seconds while Kickland finished second in 5:10.36. NCMP’s Kaelee Knoll placed third in 5:36.19. \nThe NCMP Aquagirls won seven of the 11 events in a home double dual with Atlantic and Williamsburg, which are both smaller swim teams. The Aquagirls defeated Atlantic 51-41 and posted an 83-11 win over Williamsburg. \nFor the first time this season, NCMP lost two relay races at home. According to the high school swimming Team Power Rankings on QuikStats Iowa, NCMP is 11th as a team. In the 200 and 400 freestyle relays, Atlantic has faster times than NCMP. \n“Atlantic could win the state in the 400 relay. They are super fast,” NCMP head coach Sarah Patterson said. “It is a small team, but has some really good freestyle swimmers. We knew that coming into the meet.” \nThe Aquagirls opened with winning the 200 medley relay race with the foursome of Sydney Jenkins, Hannah Rhoads, Samantha Hedrick and Alexis Stout in 2:10.95. The NCMP team of Knoll, Webb, Lakin Jenkins and Jaclyn Michener finished third in 2:24.62. \nAtlantic’s Mycala Kickland and McKenna Ewoldt finished first and second in the 200 freestyle and the 50 freestyle races. Sarah Prendergast touched the wall in a third-place time of 2:28.04 in the 200 and Emily Miller was fourth in 2:33.73. \nStout and Jessica Zahn went 1-2 in the 200 individual medley in 2:47.98 and 2:57.21, respectively, for NCMP. In the 50 it was Knoll in third at 30.45 and Alexis DeVries in fourth at 32.12. \nNCMP’s Rhoads claimed first in the 100 butterfly in 1:18.23 and Sierra Griffith was second in 1:20.77. Later in the meet, Griffith won the 100 breaststroke race in 1:24.39 and DeVries was third in 1:31.10. \n“We had a tough week of practice and I was sore and tired, but all of us were,” Griffith said. “I just worked through it and went for it. We’re close as a team and are having a lot of fun together.” \nHedrick pulled away from the field in the 100 freestyle to win in 1:02.12 and teammate Elizabeth Myers placed third in 1:07.99. Sydney Jenkins did the same in the 100 backstroke, winning in 1:13.76 and Prendergast was third in 1:18.95. \n“Madeline stayed right on that girl’s shoulder during the 400 and did not give up. She swam an aggressive final 50 meters,” Patterson said. “Sierra had a great breaststroke race and Sydney pushed through being tired to swim well in the backstroke.” \nAtlantic’s team of Ewoldt, Mycala Kickland, Madelyn Kickland and Abbie Brown won the 200 freestyle relay in 1:16.69. NCMP’s team of Stout, Miller, Rhoads and Hedrick was second in 1:58.87 and the foursome of Myers, DeVries, Alex Inskeep and Zahn was third in 2:07.80. \nIn the final race of the night, Atlantic’s Kickland, Kickland, Ewoldt and Cambry Miller pushed to a 4:13.74 victory in the 400 freestyle relay. NCMP’s Webb, Prendergast, Sydney Jenkins and Hedrick took second in 4:20.27 followed by the team of Zahn, Lakin Jenkins, Knoll and Miller in 4:40.88. \n“Overall, it was not a bad swim by our girls. We had good senior leadership as always,” Patterson said. “I thought we were a little flat all night, but as long as they don’t become complacent, I’m OK with that.” \nNCMP overpowered Williamsburg’s junior varsity, 73-15. Atlantic did not have a junior varsity. The Aquagirls won 10 of the 11 races in junior varsity competition. \n“As a group our junior varsity swimmers are on an amazing journey. So many of the girls are brand new to competitive swimming and they are having fun competing together,” Patterson said. “We are like a family and everybody is pulling for each other. They have an opportunity to go out and compete and that is important.” \nIndividual race winners for the NCMP junior varsity were Sarah Urias in the 200 freestyle; Taylor Tremmel in the 200 individual medley; Jaclyn Michener in the 50 freestyle; Alex Inskeep in the 100 butterfly; Lakin Jenkins in the 100 freestyle — a second ahead of Lindsey Blommers — Julia Prime in the 100 backstroke and Elizabeth Myers in the 100 breaststroke. \nThe Aquagirls won all three relay races. \nNCMP is home next Thursday for Senior Night against Boone. \nVarsity Dual Meets \nNCMP 83, Williamsburg 11 \nNCMP Overall Results \n200-m medley relay: 1.
