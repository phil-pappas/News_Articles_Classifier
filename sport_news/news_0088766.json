Midfielder Andrew Crofts was called up for his first start for a year with Beram Kayal banned, and Rohan Ince replaced the injured Dale Stephens.Brighton's Israel international Tomer Hemed should have hit the target in only the seventh minute following skilful play from strike partner Sam Baldock, but wastefully shot over.Referee Andy Davies waved away a strong appeal for a Preston penalty two minutes later when Jordan Hugill went down under a challenge by Lewis Dunk.Preston, making their first-ever visit to the Amex, went close through Irish striker Eoin Doyle, whose glancing header from a Paul Gallagher corner was parried by goalkeeper David Stockdale.Preston number one Jordan Pickford came to his side's rescue at the other end by diving to keep out a low shot from Murphy after a cleverly-worked free-kick involving Liam Rosenior.Pickford again did well to hook a curling goalbound free-kick from Murphy over before Albion had a let-off when Alan Browne set up Hugill in front of goal, but his tame shot was easily gathered by Stockdale.Preston striker Doyle narrowly failed to get on the end of a dangerous cross by Adam Reach shortly after the break.Reach threatened again with a strong run down the left but the move ended disappointingly for the visitors with skipper Gallagher firing wide.Hughton made his first change when veteran striker Zamora, match-winner in the previous two games, was introduced for Hemed in the 62nd minute.Preston defender Bailey Wright was off-target with a header at the far post following a deep free-kick by Gallagher.Preston manager Simon Grayson attempted to freshen up his front line by bringing on striker Joe Garner for Doyle with 24 minutes remaining.Garner wasted no time in making his presence felt and he had a powerful header at the far post cleared off the line by Bruno following a cross by Gallagher.The Seagulls, having used all their substitutes, had to play eight minutes of added time with 10 men after defender Gaetan Bong was carried off injured.
