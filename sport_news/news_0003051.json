Co-defendants Mark Harrington, 61, of Andover; Daniel Redmond, 47, of Medford; and Robert Cafarelli, 45, of Middleton — all members of Local 25 — pleaded not guilty and were released yesterday on $50,000 unsecured bonds.\nAnother co-defendant John Fidler, 51, of Holbrook will appear for a detention hearing this afternoon.\nRoss was arrested after prosecutors dismissed their indictment against another Teamster who was misidentified by the FBI. Kristin Koch, a special agent with the bureau, wrote that she had identified the man incorrectly from a video tape she obtained.\nThe tape showed Teamsters at a restaurant in Milton on June 20, 2014, “making threatening gestures and statements to the production crew” who were on scene, according to court documents.\nOne of the alleged co-conspirators later told Koch that the man wasn’t there, and that Cafarelli, Fidler and Ross had driven to the restaurant.\n“Ross bears a strong physical resemblance to (the man); both are bald, both have grey goatees, and both have tattoos down both arms,” Koch wrote. “In addition, both men have had gastric bypass surgery and lost over 100 pounds in the last year and ride Harley Davidson motorcycles.”\nOnce he was arrested, Ross said that when he had seen that the other man had been arrested he “knew that he was, in fact, the one authorities were looking for,” according to Koch’s affidavit.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T19:30:38.645+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
