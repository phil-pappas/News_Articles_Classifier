If you watched us during the first week there were a lot of questions about how good we will be. Our record may not show it, but we are a better team now than we’ve been since I’ve been here.” More News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T19:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T20:10:06.623+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
