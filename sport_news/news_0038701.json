David Desharnais kept a puck in at the blue line and then saw his shot go off Rangers defenseman Ryan McDonagh. Fleischmann batted the bouncing puck past Lundqvist on the short side. \nThe end of the third period saw the goalies at their finest. Montreal killed a two-man New York Advantage when Price made a brilliant stop short side on Derek Stepan and thwarted Rick Nash on a short-range blast. \nAt the other end, Lundqvist snared a bullet from Alex Galchenyuk. The Swede then kept the Rangers in the game in the third by stopping Brian Flynn on a breakaway and robbing a wide-open Desharnais from close range. \nHe was finally beaten again at 17:55 when Weise picked out an opening with a shot from the right circle. Plekanec then put his fourth of the season into an open net. \nAll content copyright ©2015 The Tribune, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T06:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T07:12:58.793+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
