(AP) â€” Mike Smith shook off a hard collision to stop 27 shots, Jordan Martinook scored his first career NHL goal and the Arizona Coyotes withstood a late flurry to beat the Pittsburgh Penguins 2-1 on Saturday night.\nSmith was injured in the first period after being run into by teammate Brad Richardson, who was shoved from behind by Pittsburgh's Patric Hornqvist. Smith lay on the ice for a couple minutes, but stayed in and made some big saves down the stretch, giving him 67 in two games.\nTobias Rieder also scored for the Coyotes, who have won their first two games for the first time since 2009-10.\nPhil Kessel scored his first goal with Pittsburgh and Marc-Andre Fleury stopped 37 shots for the Penguins (0-2).\nArizona's new-look team had an impressive debut Friday night, opening the season with a 4-1 win over the Los Angeles Kings despite getting off just 22 shots. Max Domi had a goal and an assist in his NHL debut and Smith was superb in goal, turning away 40 shots.\nThe Coyotes had a short turnaround before playing their home opener against Pittsburgh, one of the NHL's most talented offensive teams.\nBut for all their firepower, the Penguins fell flat in their opener, losing 3-0 at Dallas on Thursday. Kessel, Pittsburgh's latest sharpshooter, took six shots, but Sidney Crosby failed to get one off and the Penguins failed in 37 attempts against Antti Niemi.\nThe first period had plenty of shots by both teams, but no goals.\nThose came in rapid succession in the second period.\nRieder scored early after the Penguins knocked the puck into their own zone to negate an offside on Arizona. Anthony Duclair gathered the puck off the backboards and wrapped a pass around the goal to the slot, where Rieder one-timed a shot past Fleury.\nThe Penguins answered 17 seconds later, when Kessel scooped up a neutral-zone turnover by Shane Doan and beat Smith to the stick side.\nMartinook put the Coyotes back up midway through the period, punching the puck past Fleury after a wild scramble in front that included five players hitting the ice at one point.\nThe Penguins cranked up the offensive pressure in the third period, peppering Smith with one shot after another.\nHe made one tough save after another, including one midway through where he did the splits to get a pad on Nick Bonino's shot.\nNotes: Pittsburgh D Olli Maatta played in his 100th career NHL game. ... Arizona D Zbynek Michalek was out with an upper-body injury and is listed as day to day. ... Doan turned 39 on Saturday and passed Roman Hamrik for 34th on the NHL's all-time games played list with No. 1,396. ...
