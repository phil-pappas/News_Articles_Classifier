But the best stat of the night for Wolken was not turning the ball over. \n“We knew coming out of Blair Oaks that we needed to come back with a strong win, put some points on the board and help us in our district standings,” Wolken said. “We were going to put some points on the board no matter what. We were just going to come out, play our best and hopefully come out with a win in the end.” \nThe Pintos started the game exactly like last week’s loss to Blair Oaks, scoring a touchdown on their opening drive. But this time, they matched the score with two additional touchdowns on consecutive drives to take an early 22-0 lead. \nCalifornia’s first drive covered 58 yards on 10 plays, converting two fourth downs in the process. Facing a fourth-and-3, senior Landon Mouse lined up to punt the ball, but took off toward the right edge for a 4-yard gain and the first down. \nOn a third-and-6 four plays later, Osage missed an interception opportunity, forcing the Pintos into another fourth down. Mouse hauled in a 17-yard pass on fourth down to give California a first-and-goal on the 10-yard line, then Wolken scored on the next play as he ran the ball to the right pylon to give the Pintos an 8-0 lead after the 2-point conversion. \n“They wanted to prove themselves,” California head coach Marty Albertson said. “We knew we didn’t play our best game last week. They had a lot to prove it this week.” \nThe Pintos’ defense had back-to-back pass breakups on Osage’s first offensive possession to stop the drive at midfield, then California quickly found the end zone again. Wolken connected with senior Ethan Hodges over the middle in traffic, and Hodges turned on the jets and outraced the defenders for the 56-yard touchdown. \nWith the 14-0 lead, it took the Pintos just three plays to push their lead to 22-0. Senior Brandan Gump — who has made his biggest impact on defense this season — ran up the middle for a 71-yard score. \n“That was great,” Albertson said. “The A gap was there tonight. It was a zone read and I thought it worked well.” \nMidway through the second quarter, after holding the Pintos to a three-and-out, Osage finally got on the board to cut the lead to 22-7. It took just one play as Dylan Riley broke free up the middle for a 52-yard rushing touchdown. \nOn the Indians’ next drive, which started on their own 6-yard line, quarterback Zach Wheeler tossed his second interception of the game to California’s Gunner Baquet. That gave the Pintos the ball on the Indians’ 24-yard line. \nAfter an incompletion and a 6-yard run by Baquet, Wolken ran the ball to the 1, then pushed ahead for the touchdown on a quarterback sneak. Wolken’s second rushing touchdown extend his team’s lead to 29-7. \n“We were running the inside zone with our running back, then faking it to (the running back) and keeping it on the outside trap, which was open quite a bit for Jacob,” Albertson said. \nOsage scored just before halftime to bring the Indians to within 15 points when Riley rushed for a 2-yard touchdown to make it 29-14. \nCalifornia scored twice in the second half off a 21-yard reception by Mouse and an 8-yard rush by Wolken to give the Pintos a 41-14 lead. \nMouse caught seven passes for 126 yards and a touchdown. \nCalifornia (5-3 overall, 5-1 Tri-County Conference) ends its regular season Friday with Senior Night against Warsaw (0-8, 0-6). \nOsage (3-5, 2-4) will host the Hallsville Indians (4-4, 2-4) on Friday. ﻿", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T08:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T13:30:17.960+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
