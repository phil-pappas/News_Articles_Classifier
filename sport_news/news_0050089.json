Kaepernick hadn't performed well in recent games, but he played his best game of the season in the 30-27 loss at the New York Giants. He hopes to produce a second straight strong performance when the 49ers host the Ravens on Sunday Night Football (KGW-8 (NBC), 5:25 p.m. PT/8:25 p.m. ET).\nKaepernick completed 23-of-35 passes for 262 yards, two touchdowns and no interceptions. Kaepernick had completed a combined 22-of-44 passes for 227 yards and five interceptions in his previous two games. It's no surprise the 49ers kept the game against the Giants. Why? Kaepernick didn't throw an interception.\nBaltimore coach John Harbaugh said he's got enough to worry about than wondering why his brother Jim Harbaugh is no longer the coach for the 49ers. The Ravens may not have wide receiver Steve Smith for the game. Smith is nursing a back injury and if he can't go, quarterback Joe Flacco will rely on running back Justin Forsett and then challenge a 49ers secondary that has had trouble containing receivers throughout the season.\nIf you want to watch the 49ers face the Ravens, here's what you need to know:\nWhat : Baltimore Ravens at San Francisco 49ers\nWhere : Levi's Stadium, Santa Clara, CA\nWhen : Sunday, Oct. 18, 1 p.m. PT/4 p.m. ET\nTV : KOIN-6 (CBS)\nWatch online : You can watch the live stream online on DirecTV's live stream package.\n-- Geoffrey C.
