But claiming these things, having this type of tool behind helps them to begin to get that business listing, get that business recognition online,” says MSSU Marketing & Outreach Specialist Sherry Noller.\nListing your business on Google is simple. Just go to gybo.com which stands for \"Get Your Business Online\" and input your information. Once that's done all you really need to do is wait for a postcard in the mail from Google and you're good to go.\n\"You know for marketing and things small businesses need every opportunity they can to be found by their customers and with people being on their smart phones more often and using those searches quite a bit, every little bit helps them,” says Noller.\nAccording to Google, businesses with an online presence are set to grow 40% faster than those don't, results that give promise to small business owners like Betty.\n\"My generation is not always real tech savvy and the generations below us are, and to keep the art of quilting going I need to be within that social media and internet advertising for those generations,” she says.\nMissouri Southern will be hosting another Google workshop in Neosho tomorrow from 8:30-10:30am at the Neosho Chamber of Commerce.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T02:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T09:03:17.529+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
