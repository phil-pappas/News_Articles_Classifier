The latest from SportsLine Week 7 NFL Picks Mallett, the team's backup quarterback, will be on hand for the Texans' game against the Dolphins on Sunday, but he arrived in Miami later than his teammates. According to John McClain of The Houston Chronicle , Mallett missed the team's charter to Miami and had to book a commercial flight in order to get himself to the game.\nIt's not known why Mallett wasn't there for the team's flight.\nTexans QB Ryan Mallett missed team charter and had to fly commercial to Dolphins game. I can imagine Bill OBrien reaction.\n— John McClain (@McClain_on_NFL) October 25, 2015 How dumb can Mallett be? Missed practice in camp cause he overslept. What will this excuse be?\n— John McClain (@McClain_on_NFL) October 25, 2015 If Tom Savage wasn't on IR and could be the backup I bet OBrien would cut Mallett. He's got to be livid!\n— John McClain (@McClain_on_NFL) October 25, 2015 As McClain alluded to above, this isn't an isolated incident. In training camp, after head coach Bill O'Brien awarded Brian Hoyer the starting quarterback job, Mallett was a no-show at practice. Mallett claimed he slept through his alarm clock. \nThen, after Mallett became the team's starter, he was benched mid game against the Colts when he came off the field due to an injury and wasn't allowed to continue as the starter. Mallett looked like he wanted to return to the game, but O'Brien stuck with Hoyer.\nMallet didn't seem pleased with O'Brien's decision. \nWhen Chipotle runs out of guac. pic.twitter.com/z2WP7Z5xAG \n— Sean Wagner-McGough (@seanjwagner) October 9, 2015 Since then, it's been Hoyer's job. Given this latest development, it doesn't seem as if Mallett is any closer to snatching the job back. Ryan Mallett reportedly missed the Texans flight to Miami.
