There's a lot of pride. We've been battling them and had some really good games the past three years.\n\"As coaches, we try to explain to them that this is just a great test for us. Our ultimate goal is a state championship. When you play a team like that, they're going to give you their best and you're going to see where you're at this time of year. Which is exactly what we wanted and got out of it.\"\nMarquette also got what it wanted, a 1-0 victory thanks to a first-half goal by Alec Philippe. The reigning state champion Hilltoppers, ranked No. 1 in the state, improved to 14-2.\n\"We want to get the toughest teams to get ourselves ready, and we knew Bay was one of the top teams in the state,\" Marquette coach Steve Lawrence said. \"So whatever we can do to get ready for the playoffs, we'll do. Having Bay here the last game of the year is a good last prep now that we get into the playoff run.\"\nBay, ranked No. 1 in the state in Division 2, fell to 17-2-1 after losing for the first time in 17 games.\n\"The players are pretty down,\" Worzella said. \"They got really up for this game. I'm really proud of how we played and battled. It might not have been our best game. But we kept in it the whole time.\"\nThe only goal came 17 minutes, 31 seconds into the first half. Marquette's Chaney Christenson created the scoring chance by dribbling down the left sideline.\n\"(The defender) was giving me my right foot so I cut in, then I looked up and saw (Philippe),\" Christenson said. \"So I led him into the box and he had an open shot. We've been doing that all season.\"\nPhilippe beat his defender and got the ball at the right side of the six-yard box. He quickly shot and scored after the ball bounced off the leg of goalkeeper Adin Chiappa.\n\"I knew (Christenson) was either going to shoot it back post or cross it, and so I took the chance,\" Philippe said. \"He crossed it, and I was just on the end of it and put it away.\"\nMarquette's plan was to spread the ball out and try to attack on the wings, according to its coach.\n\"I thought we did a good job in the first half of getting the ball wide, getting overlapping runs, which ultimately created the goal we had,\" Lawrence said. \"Michael Russell gets an overlapping run, Chaney cuts it in, plays a perfect ball, we hit Philippe on the back post. That's the ideal scenario we were looking for.\"\nJust over 10 minutes later, Chiappa made a diving stop in midair on a penalty shot by Christenson. The goalie also made a similar diving save on a shot by Nicholas Cheung in the second half.\n\"Adin was fantastic,\" Worzella said. \"That's one of the best performances a goalkeeper has had in the state all year....The PK save was huge, but he had a couple of other huge ones. He's fantastic.\"\nSUMMARY Whitefish Bay 0 0 — 0 Milwaukee Marquette 1 0 — 1\nFirst Half : 1, MARQ, Alec Philippe (Chaney Christenson), 17:00. Saves — MARQ, Josef Jochem, 2; MARQ, Tristan Bosch, 3.
