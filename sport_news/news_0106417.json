I believe he will be out until after the next international break. \n\"With the (last) international break, the fact that he played against Andorra certainly cost (Gareth) Bale and him as well.\" \nRamsey and Bale both faced Andorra in a Euro 2016 qualifying match on October 13. \nRamsey was taken off injured in the 2-0 Champions League win over Bayern Munich on Tuesday, having played 90 minutes against Watford three days before.
