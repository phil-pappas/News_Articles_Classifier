Last year, the North Jersey power handed the visiting Prep a 47-29 defeat.\nDuMond, a rugged defensive end who also sees time at fullback and tight end, was involved in five first-half tackles, with two solos, as the Prep took a 14-3 lead into the locker room. The Hawks limited the Green Knights to 38 yards rushing and 99 passing before the break. \n\"Our defense is built on setting the edge,\" said DuMond, a first-team all-Catholic pick last season. \"We always have to keep outside leverage.\" \nWhile the 6-1, 230-pound senior did not want to make too much of the Week 6 victory, he said there was \"something special\" about the Prep's team dinner and meeting the night before. \nDid the Prep (3-2) make a statement by beating St. Joseph? \"Not at all,\" DuMond said. \"We have to get back to work, make the necessary corrections, and get ready for our next opponent.\" \nOn a right-side, play-action pass in the third-quarter, a wide-open DuMond hauled in a toss from Kevin Shaw and rumbled for an 11-yard touchdown that put the Hawks in front, 21-5. \nIn addition to DuMond, linebackers James Johnson (11 tackles, with eight solos) and Nick Vandevere (nine, five) shined on defense. Backs Benny Walls (six), Ricky Goodson (five), and Zach Goss (five) combined for 16 stops. \nThe defensive line rotation included DuMond, Jackson Evans (6-4, 290), Charlie Holsopple (6-4, 265), Sal Cinaglia (6-2, 265), Kevin Hanley, Chris Lowndes, and Rayshad Wallace. \nThe Prep's D'Andre Swift, a speedy junior tailback, carried 23 times for 217 yards. The Division I prospect ran for scores of 2, 32, and 4 yards. \"He's just amazing,\" DuMond said. \"It's incredible the things he can do.\" \nDuMond, who lives near Second and Jackson Streets in South Philly, has a scholarship offer from Old Dominion. \"I'm hoping to make a visit on our next bye week,\" the 17-year-old said. \nExtra points. Walls, a safety who made a fourth-quarter interception in the end zone, is mulling offers from Boston College, Rutgers, Syracuse, and Temple. He made a 17-yard catch to set up Swift's first tally. . . . After spending the week as a guest coach with St. Joe's Prep, Susie Cook, an English teacher at the school, received a game ball from Hawks coach Gabe Infante. . . . Upper Dublin senior quarterback Ryan Stover recently received an offer from Towson. \nAfter being held to 42 total yards and going scoreless in the first half of Saturday night's 27-24 nonleague loss to Archbishop Wood, La Salle posted 17 third-quarter points in 10 minutes. Sophomore end Chris Maloney's fumble recovery set up Chris Ferguson's 25-yard TD pass to Nick Rinella. . . . Wood sophomore linebacker Matt Palmer notched six solo tackles, including a second-quarter sack, vs. the Explorers. Tackle Omar Peterkin and end Mack Schwartz also had first-half sacks for the Vikings. . . . Central Bucks South linebackers Luke Kohler and Matt Hemsley have made 51 and 50 tackles, respectively.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T08:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T08:45:08.335+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
