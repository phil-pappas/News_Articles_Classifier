We've got you covered.\n ESPN's 'College GameDay' set to converge on Salt Lake City Whittingham No. 40 in USA Today's head coach salary rankings Utah enemy camp: Five questions with a Cal beat writer Top 10 'College GameDay' signs of the 2015 season Utah notebook: Fake punt return catching on elsewhere SALT LAKE CITY — For the first time in nearly five years, ESPN's \"College GameDay\" is returning to Utah and bringing the spotlight of the college football world to the University of Utah campus on Saturday.\nWhat's in store for the fans both on the university's campus, as well as those at home? Here's a look at the highlights of the show:\nCorso and the headgear\nReality shows have come and gone with contests built in to entice viewers to keep coming back until the end to find out which contestant comes out on top.\nBut those shows have nothing on GameDay's final act, when 80-year-old college football analyst Lee Corso makes his headgear game pick, reserved for the contest being played at their GameDay destination.\nA tradition that began in 1996, Corso chooses who will win the game by putting on the headgear of their mascot. Over the years, he has made 262 headgear picks, according to ESPN Front Row , and has accurately picked the winner almost 68 percent of the time.\nHe is, however, just 1-4 on headgear picks this season and is on a four-pick losing streak.\n\"Coach Corso is a legend. There are very few must-see moments in television, and we are lucky enough to have one every Saturday morning,” ESPN senior coordinating producer Lee Fitting said, according to ESPN Front Row, when Corso made his 250th headgear selection last November. “Regardless of what Coach does at the end of the show, it brings a smile to your face — what more could you want?”\nIn 2011, GameDay eloquently shared the backstory of Corso's headgear picks and why it has become such a beloved part of the program.\nCorso's most successful headgear picks have revolved around the USC program. He has accurately predicted all 21 games involving the Trojans, including 16 when he predicted USC to win and five others when he picked them to lose.\nGuest picks\nCorso and other members of the GameDay staff, which includes Kirk Herbstreit, Rece Davis, Desmond Howard, David Pollack and Sam Ponder, also make their picks on several other college football games each weekend, in addition to the headgear pick. They also bring on a guest to make their picks as well.\nFrom entertainers to college football legends, as well as athletes from other sports and plenty of others with ties to the premier games, hundreds of guests have joined the show to predict the nation's top weekly contests. In 2009, for instance, legendary BYU head coach LaVell Edwards lent his expertise for the game predicting session of the show when GameDay headed to Provo for BYU's matchup against TCU that year.\nOne of the most bizarre guest appearances, though, was when Katy Perry joined the show last season when they visited The Grove at Ole Miss.\nSpecial features\nEach week's three-hour program, which airs from 7-10 a.m. MDT, provides ample opportunities to share feature stories from around the college football world. From the wacky and the weird to the touching and the emotional, these segments provide a perfect capstone to the previous week and an inviting window into what lies ahead.\nThese segments also provide a platform for stories that would usually stay on a local scene to be transmitted on a national stage.\nEarlier this year, the early college saga of BYU quarterback Tanner Mangum was shared on \"College GameDay.\"\nOn Saturday, the Utes ' story, which includes them being 4-0 and ranked No. 5 nationally, will be told prior to their matchup against No. 23 California.", "external_links": ["http://deseretnews.sportsdirectinc.com/football/ncaaf-teams.aspx?page=/data/ncaaf/teams/team33.html", "http://deseretnews.sportsdirectinc.com/football/ncaaf-teams.aspx?page=/data/ncaaf/teams/team93.html", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/z5ylorB9U2o", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr-KCTFVvyk", "http://deseretnews.sportsdirectinc.com/football/ncaaf-teams.aspx?page=/data/ncaaf/teams/team110.html", "http://espn.go.com/video/clip?id=13688536", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/mW3w3H0fUVQ", "http://player.espn.com/player.js?playerBrandingId=4ef8000cbaf34c1687a7d9a26fe0e89e&adSetCode=91cDU6NuXTGKz3OdjOxFdAgJVtQcKJnI&pcode=1kNG061cgaoolOncv54OAO1ceO-I&width=446&height=270&externalId=espn:13688536&thruParam_espn-ui", "http://www.espnfrontrow.com/2014/10/gamedays-corso-to-make-250th-headgear-pick-saturday-at-west-virginia/", "http://deseretnews.sportsdirectinc.com/football/ncaaf-teams.aspx?page=/data/ncaaf/teams/team71.html"], "published": "2015-10-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T02:46:56.671+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
