It was taken earlier this evening around 5pm...\nPosted by US National Weather Service Portland Oregon on Monday, October 19, 2015 The cloud has since dissipated, said NWS meteorologist Colby Newman, and it is not clear if it ever touched the ground. The radar barely picked up the showers from which it was derived.\nIt's not unusual to see funnel clouds on a day like today, Newman said, adding it is unlikely Coburg residents will see any tornadoes Monday.\n\"It's not the kind of day where we see the strong tornadoes we've seen in the past,\" Newman said.\n\"If the public sees something like this in the future,\" however, \"they should either take shelter or get somewhere that's safe. Being inside a car is generally not a good thing,\" Newman said.\nFunnel cloud sighted at Coburg 5pm.
