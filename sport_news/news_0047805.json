Los Angeles lost 8-7 Wednesday against Oakland to fall three games back in the division. \nHouston, with the same 83-75 record as the Angels, played at Seattle later Wednesday night. \nYovani Gallardo (13-11) allowed nine hits over 5 1-3 innings, but gave up only two runs to win for the first time in his last four starts. The right-hander struck out five and walked one. \nDetroit took a 2-0 lead in the first inning for the second night in a row, this time on a two-run double by Tyler Collins. \nThe Rangers got even in the bottom of the first on Beltre's 17th homer, a shot to left-center field. Beltre has an AL-best 29 RBIs in September, and 74 for the season. \nChirinos led off the second with his 10th homer, putting Texas ahead to stay. Beltre had a two-out double off the left-center wall and scored on Prince Fielder's bloop single before Napoli hit a blast to the wall behind the lower deck of seats in left field. \nTigers left-hander Matt Boyd (1-6) allowed all three Texas homers while giving up seven hits in 2 2-3 innings. He struck out two and walked one. \nBeltre is hitting .416 (32 of 77) in his last 19 games, raising his season average from .261 to .283. Shin-Soo Choo, who singled and scored before Beltre's homer in the first, has an eight-game hitting streak and is batting .444 (24 of 54) over his past 14 games, and has reached base in 49 of his last 51. \nTRAINER'S ROOM \nTigers: Victor Martinez missed his second consecutive game with a sore left quad. ... 3B Nick Castellanos was back in the lineup after coming out in the first inning Tuesday because of a bruised right finger and sore left wrist. \nRangers: C Robinson Chirinos made only his second start since being activated from the disabled list Sept. 7 after missing more than a month with a left shoulder strain. \nUP NEXT \nTigers: After its final off day of the season, Detroit opens a three-game series Friday night at the Chicago White Sox. \nRangers: LHP Derek Holland, 0-2 with an 8.59 ERA his last four starts, pitches the series opener against the Angels. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T06:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T07:17:51.913+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
