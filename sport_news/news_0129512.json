South Carolina, which opened practice Monday, anticipates having her back within two weeks. (AP Photo/Rogelio V. Solis) × COLUMBIA — As head coach Dawn Staley shouted commands toward the end of the first practice of the preseason for South Carolina’s women’s basketball team, Tiffany Mitchell could only sit on the bench and watch. The two-time SEC Player of the Year remains out following surgery to repair a stress-related injury in her left foot, which followed a sprained left ankle in July that took her out of the Pan-American Games in Toronto. The senior from Charlotte is within two weeks of being cleared, said Staley, who anticipates having Mitchell back before the Nov. 13 opener against Ohio State. “We’ll have her for the start of the season. She’s getting acclimated, she’s sprinting this week. I’m quite sure she’s been in here shooting a lot,” Staley said Monday after the Gamecocks wrapped up their opening practice. “But Tiff knows what we’re doing now. She’ll be able to easily acclimate to what we’re doing. So it’s a good thing. Her body needs to rest.” A first-team All-American, Mitchell had two of the best games of her career last season to lift USC to its first Final Four. She’s one of three returning starters on a team which said goodbye to Goose Creek product and emotional leader Aleigha Welch, but is set to move forwards A’ja Wilson and Alaina Coates into the starting lineup and added Sarah Imovbioh, the ACC’s leading rebounder at Virginia last year. For a team which went 34-3 last season and spent several weeks ranked No. 1, the national championship remains the goal. But this team is younger and less experienced, Staley said, and perhaps needs to be reminded of what it took to reach Tampa last year. “They might be a little bit complacent, and probably forget about what it took to get to that point,” she said. “We almost have to break them down and build them back up. Last year, we worked for that. It wasn’t something that came easy. ... I want them confident, but I also want them respecting the journey.” Mitchell, who led the Gamecocks in scoring last season at 14.1 ppg, will certainly be a large part of that. In the meantime, though, she’s watching and waiting, and yearning to get back out on the floor. “She’s doing everything in her power to get back out here with us,” Coates said. “Her transition coming back has been a lot faster than we expected, especially with the surgery being what it was and what happened in July in Canada. She’s got that motivation to get back as soon as possible. She doesn’t want to feel like she’s letting us down.” Keywords", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T01:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T01:27:09.314+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
