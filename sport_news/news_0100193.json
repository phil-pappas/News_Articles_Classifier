Going To Five: Almost like the 2014 season when UNF went to five sets 11 times, five-set matches are becoming a slight norm for UNF in 2015. The Ospreys have played at least one five-set match in five of the six weeks played thus far this season. UNF is 5-0 in five-set matches this season, an improvement from 2014's 4-7 mark in five sets. Scouting Lipscomb: Only team entering the weekend with an undefeated conference record... had a marquee win during the first tournament of the season, upsetting No. 23 Utah 3-1 during the Utah Classic... has gone to three sets in last four matches, winning three of those... comes off a pair of 3-0 sweeps against Stetson and Florida Gulf Coast... returns the 2013 Atlantic Sun Player of the Year Jewell Dobson, who missed the 2014 season after suffering an injury... Dobson leads the team with 3.16 kills per set... Molly Spitznagle is hitting an Atlantic Sun-best .358, while Kayla Ostrom leads the conference with 11.55 assists per set. UNF-Lipscomb Series: Lipscomb leads the all-time series 11-2, but both of last year's matches went to five sets. Scouting NJIT: In its first season as an Atlantic Sun member... snapped a six-match losing skid with a 3-1 win over Stetson on Sunday... begins its trip to the River City on Friday night at Jacksonville.... Danica Vukotic leads the Highlanders with a 3.98 kill-per-set average... earlier this season, Nina Vukotic registered 32 kills and Danica Vukotic had 30 kills in NJIT's 3-2 victory over Rider on Sept. 18.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T19:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T01:56:16.296+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
