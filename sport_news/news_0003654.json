On Thursday, the Conway sophomore won the event by a single shot, holding off four others for the title. \n\"I'm feeling really good about this one,\" said Ott, who shot a 4-over 76 on the 5,771-yard course at Pleasant Valley Country Club. \"I'm really happy that I made it here, and I'm really happy I played as well as I did.\" \nOtt made a tournament-high five birdies, including two on the final four holes. Ott also had seven bogeys and a double bogey. \n\"Those birdies definitely helped knock off some of the bad holes I had,\" Ott said. \"My goal was to shoot a 74. I didn't think a 76 would win with all the great competitors that were out there today.\" \nRogers junior Brooke Matthews, North Little Rock junior Hannah Bakalekos, Wynne junior Elizabeth Moon and Baptist Prep sophomore Katelyn Dunstan all posted 77s on a clear, hot and windy afternoon. \nMatthews, the 2014 Overall champion, earned runner-up honors when she parred the first playoff hole. Bakalekos secured third place when she parred the second extra hole while Moon and Dunstan both made bogey. \nMatthews struggled early Thursday, dropping three strokes on the first two holes, but the University of Arkansas commitment was only 2 over on her final 16 holes. \n\"There was just a lot of stuff out there where I felt like I just made some stupid mistakes,\" Matthews said. \"I could have done better, but it's OK.\" \nMatthews and Ott traded places from the Class 7A state tournament two weeks ago in Conway. Matthews birdied the final hole of that two-day event to earn a one-stroke victory. \n\"Casey is one of my best friends and I'm really happy for her,\" Matthews said. \"Coming down the stretch, I didn't know what the scores looked like. I was just trying to make a few birdies. Unfortunately for me, that didn't happen.\" \nBakalekos, who also finished third in the 7A tournament, turned in the top score on the back nine with an even-par 36. Bakalekos played the first seven holes in 1 over, but the North Little Rock junior took a triple bogey on No. 8 and a bogey on No. 9. \nOtt was especially pleased with her birdie on the par-4 No. 15, which is regarded as the second-toughest hole on the course. \n\"I used a wedge [on the approach shot] and stuck it to within 3 feet,\" Ott said. \"I was happy with that one.\" \nOtt's victory marked the third consecutive year that a sophomore has won the Overall title. \nThe tournament was sponsored by the Arkansas Women's Golf Association. \nSports on 10/16/2015", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T10:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T11:08:09.507+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
