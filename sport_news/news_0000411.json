GM search reportedly down to three Ryan Lawrence Posted: Friday, October 23, 2015, 3:34 PM \nThe six-week search for the Phillies next general manager is likely drawing to a close as the front office readies for next week’s organization meetings. \nA hire may be imminent with team president Andy MacPhail reportedly down to three finalists. According to ESPN.com, Philadelphia native Chaim Bloom, currently in the Tampa Bay Rays front office, is one of the three candidates who could succeed Ruben Amaro Jr. as the Phillies next general manager. \nAlthough MacPhail has done an admirable job of conducting his search in secrecy, it would not be surprising if one of the other finalists is the name that has been floated in reports the most often, beginning when the process got underway after Amaro was fired last month: Los Angeles Angels assistant GM Matt Klentak. \nThe 35-year-old Klentak has been the closest thing to a favorite since the process began, mostly due to his history with MacPhail. Klentak, a Dartmouth grad, was hired by MacPhail to be the Baltimore Orioles director of baseball operations in 2008. Klentak was a candidate for the Angels GM job, which went to Billy Eppler earlier this month. \nThe 32-year-old Bloom, meanwhile, was under consideration for the Milwaukee Brewers GM position last month. Bloom, a Yale University grad, has worked in the Rays front office for a decade and is currently the team’s vice president of baseball operations. \nKansas City Royals assistant GM J.J. Piccolo, a Cherry Hill native, was labeled a \"heavy favorite\" earlier this week by USA Today. But, on Friday, ESPN.com reported that Picollo was no longer in the running. \nOther names that have surfaced as potential candidates include Dan Kantrovitz (Oakland), Thad Levine (Texas), Kim Ng (commissioner’s office), Matt Slater (St. Louis), Ross Atkins (Cleveland) and Ben Cherington (formerly of Boston). Kantrovitz, who went in for a second interview recently according to foxsports.com, is an intriguing candidate: he spent the last year as an assistant GM in Oakland after succeeding current Houston GM Jeff Luhnow as the St. Louis Cardinals director of amateur scouting. \nMacPhail and company would probably like to have their hire in place by early next week: the Phillies are holding their annual organizational meetings in Clearwater, Fla., beginning on Monday. Baseball’s General Manager Meetings, meanwhile, begin on Nov. 9 in Boca Raton, Fla. \nThere’s a fairly high probability the Phillies could make their hire on Monday: the World Series begins on Tuesday and Major League Baseball is not a fan of teams making major announcements or news on the same day as the sport’s most signature of events.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T22:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T22:52:51.450+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
