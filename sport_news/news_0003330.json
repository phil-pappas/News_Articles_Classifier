Organisers hurriedly place trophies on plinths.\nThose present are drawn from among Qatar's army of Indian, Pakistani, Bangladeshi and Sri Lankan workers, all prominent cricket-playing nations.\nBetween them, these four countries account for almost 40 percent of Qatar's population.\n\"You see the workforce that comes from the subcontinent -- India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka -- they love cricket,\" said a smiling Shahid Iqbal, captain of the victorious team, Qalco, a local oil company.\n\"So, because the national game of Qatar is football, we are looking for some opportunities to play cricket. That is our national game.\"\nThe joyous scenes are worthy of one of the almost 90 major sporting events, including the current Paralympics world championships, to be held in Qatar in the 12 months up to March 2016.\nBut this jubilant night on the grim fringes of the capital does not even register as a footnote on the country's A-list sporting calendar.\nIt wasn't advertised, no promotional banners were stuck to lampposts, no tickets sold in the city centre, nor any international superstars flown into highlight the event, as usually happens in Doha.\nYet, despite the sweaty conditions, a good size crowd -- around the same as that at a recent Qatar World Cup football qualifier -- has turned out for a seemingly inconsequential eight-overs-a-side cricket competition between teams composed entirely of labourers or those representing local companies.\n - Labourers come to relax - Well away from the bright lights of Doha's ultra-modern city centre stands the Asian Town Cricket Stadium, where many of the Gulf state's labourers come to relax.\nBoth Qalco and their opponents in the final, QDVC, battled through a competition involving up to nine teams.\nThe tournament itself is like a form of street cricket, which just happens to be played in a 14,000-seater stadium.\nThere is no hard \"real\" cricket ball -- more a slightly harder and bouncier tennis ball -- so there's no need for batsmen to wear protective pads, or anything else.\nHeading into the final Qalco are clear favourites, thanks in no small part to their star Pakistani batsman Ifzal Khan.\nQDVC skipper, who gives his name as Zuheb, admits his team, made up of an assortment of workers, has little chance as the final begins.\n\"Some of them are drivers. I do HR work. Some of them here are AC technicians. Some of them are stall-keepers, those kinds of things.\"\nThis being Qatar it is hard to escape the vexed issue of workers' rights -- an international cause and a sensitive topic within the country itself.\nThe match takes place close to a Labour City, a sprawling new accommodation centre for up to 70,000 workers, many from South Asia.\nOne of the teams taking part, QDVC, a subsidiary of French construction company Vinci, has been accused of using forced labour on sites in Qatar and taken to court in France, a claim it vehemently denies.\nPrizes include sharing 25,000 Qatari riyals ($6,800, 6,100 euros) among the winning team, and 10,000 for the runners-up.\nOne Bangladeshi player tells AFP he is desperate to win a share of the money as it will equate to around a month's wages, which he could then send home to his family.\nThe conversation is overheard and leads to accusations of trouble-making, a jarring note on an otherwise sportsmanlike evening.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T21:20:17.510+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
