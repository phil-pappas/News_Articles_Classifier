Friday night in Waynesville, it was the Tigers' defense that played the largest role in helping them to advance in Class 5 District 4, holding Camdenton to 60 first-half yards and 178 total (unofficially) en route to a 19-7 victory. Waynesville moves on to the Class 5 District 4 semifinal round to play Battle next Friday at 7 p.m. If it weren't for a 54 yard touchdown through the air to Austin Stamper with 50 seconds to go, the second-half would've featured a paltry 64 yards from the Lakers' offense and a goose egg on the board. Junior linebacker Raishon Pickett said that could've been the story in the first meeting between the two teams too, but the execution was lacking a bit. \"The game plan was just to line up right and play ball,\" Pickett said. \"If you look at the last game, the times they scored was when we weren't lined up right. If we lined up right, they couldn't run nowhere.\" Camdenton likes to go with a jumbo set, putting in extra offensive linemen at the tight end spot at fullback, forcing the defense to either match them with run stoppers or get ran over. \"I think our coaches did a great job of getting a good game plan together,\" Drehle said. \"They put a lineman where a tight end would be and it makes it an unbalanced formation. So, if you slide your defense to what would be the normal strength, you end up with a gap exposed.\" So, the defense called Camdenton's bluff, stayed balanced and trusted the play call. Both defenses, actually, played well. The Lakers' 'D' opened with an interception on the Tigers' third play of the opening drive of the game. It was one of two picks by the secondary, which was much improved from the last trip to Waynesville. Camdenton's defensive backs held sophomore Ethan Brown to 9-18 passing for 125 yards and only trailed by seven at halftime. The first of Brown's two touchdowns came with 4:58 in the first quarter, hitting junior running back Elton Bradford for a five yard score. That score was the only time either team found paydirt until the fourth quarter. Waynesville had a 36-yard touchdown by senior David Hawk called back on its first drive of the third quarter and wound up turning the ball over on a fumbled pitch two plays later at Camdenton's 32. But the defense continued its trend of slapping handcuffs on the Lakers, allowing them to cross midfield on only four of their 10 drives of the game, and two of those drives ended at the Tigers' 48 and 47. Page 2 of 2 - \"I thought we played pretty well on the defensive end,\" Camdenton coach Jeff Shore said. \"We just couldn't find an answer and get it in the end zone.\" With 5:57 left in the third quarter, Camdenton drove down inside Waynesville's 30-yard line, but the Tigers' defense stiffened up, stopping a Jay Griffin run for no gain and Pickett wrapped up Camdenton quarterback Dyllan Decker for a loss of three. It was one of Pickett's two and-a-half sacks in the game. Later, Decker and a Lakers' receiver missed on a connection on fourth down that would've netted them a first down at the least. \"We had a post pattern there that was close,\" Shore said. \"It would've scored or put us down there inside the five.\" The Tigers padded their lead with 9:57 left on the fourth-quarter clock on sophomore David Adams' run from 3 yards out and later on a 12-yard screen to senior Seth Hedrick with 2:26 left in regulation. On the first of those two touchdowns, a two-point conversion failed on a rushing attempt and on the second the point-after kick missed. Camdenton's next two drives never reached midfield as the Lakers watched Waynesville put the game out of reach. Pickett said the intensity of the game, aided by the fact it was their main nemesis on the other side of the ball, helped the defense to up its game. \"I think it's just the rivalry,\" Pickett said. \"Something inside of us just said, 'We've got to get this done.' This is civil war right here.\" So, does that mean they'll be at the same level next week when they play the seventh-ranked (by Missouri Media Rankings), 7-2 Battle Spartans that ousted them in the first round of districts last year? \"It's not about revenge, it's just an opportunity to move on,\" Drehle said. \"Right now it's about 48 minutes and being 1-0 at the end of the night.\" By Derek Dueker   Derek Dueker", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T06:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T11:29:16.589+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
