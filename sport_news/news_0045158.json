(AP) - An Oregon State University soccer player charged with public indecency after an alleged incident in which he exposed himself to a woman near campus has prior convictions for a similar offense. \nDavid James Brown was arrested Sept. 30 for allegedly masturbating while standing naked outside a woman's residence. He has since pleaded not guilty to public indecency and sex abuse charges. \nMore: Arrest after naked man frightens women near Oregon State campus \nCourt documents say the 19-year-old soccer player was convicted of two counts of indecent exposure in Texas in July 2014. \nUniversity spokesman Steve Clark told the Corvallis Gazette-Times that the school was unaware of his criminal history. Last February, the athletic department singled out Brown for praise on its website. \nBrown has extensive experience with the Houston Dynamo Academy as well as the Dallas Texans club system. He was invited to play in international friendlies against Chivas, Tecos and Chiapas while with the Dynamo Academy. He was the 2014 Dynamo Alumni Cup Man of the Match. \n“David is one of the better youth left backs in the country.” Simmons said. “He is a strong 1v1 defender and can get forward to help in the attack. His cultured left foot provides a wide variety of passing ranges.” \nBrown also helped Dallas Texans win the U13 Tivoli Cup and make the semi-finals of the Gothia Cup while playing as a guest-player. \nFollowing Brown's arrest, references to him as a member of the soccer team's freshmen recruit class were removed from the school's website. \nClark said that was done in error. The changes were restored online Wednesday. He has been suspended indefinitely from the soccer team and he does not appear on the team roster. \nBrown remains in jail on $160,000 bail. \nHe may also face other university sanctions up to and including expulsion, Clark told the Gazette-Times.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T19:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T20:07:23.886+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
