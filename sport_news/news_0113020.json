Posted: Thursday, October 15, 2015 7:43 pm | Updated: 9:00 pm, Thu Oct 15, 2015. For Cowboys, bye week comes at perfect time Dekota Gregory, Sports Reporter, @dekotagregory The O'Colly \nAfter Saturday’s overtime victory against West Virginia, Oklahoma State defensive end Emmanuel Ogbah walked in to do postgame interviews with ice wrapped around his right shoulder. Linebacker Chad Whitener winced as he sat down. Even defensive coordinator Glenn Spencer had to lean against something for support during interviews. \nAfter six straight weeks of football, it was obvious that the Cowboys were in desperate need of the upcoming bye week. \n“(We’re) 6-0 going into the bye week; we’ve felt like we’ve done a great job,” Ogbah said. “A lot of guys are getting banged up though, so this will be a perfect week to rest up.” \nFor players to recover from half a season of football, coach Mike Gundy reduced practice time during the week. The week also includes a day off Saturday. During this time, recovery is a necessity for the Cowboys. \nThe OSU defense has been one of the best in the country through six weeks, but it would not be as effective without some key components. Cornerback Kevin Peterson left Saturday’s game early in the first half due to injury. Peterson has tallied 20 tackles and an interception for the Cowboys this season. OSU is also already without linebacker Ryan Simmons, who will miss the rest of the season with a torn MCL and PCL, which required surgery. Linebacker Seth Jacobs has also worn a cast on his right hand for most of the season thus far. Spencer is even battling a sore knee after getting ran into during a kickoff return on Saturday. More missing pieces would hinder the top defense in the Big 12. \n“If we would have played this Saturday, we would have been out two or three critical, impactful players,” Spencer said. “We would have been out them this week, but they will be back next week. (The bye week) is very critical to our success on our side of the ball.” \nRest won’t be the only help for the Cowboys from the week off. Despite leading the Big 12 in nearly every defensive category, OSU is still looking for improvements. The offensive side of the ball is also looking for ways to jumpstart its running game, which is averaging 3.7 yards a carry, and improve its first-down productivity. The Cowboys’ running game is currently ninth in the Big 12. The defense’s weakest phase has been against the run game, which still ranks fourth in the Big 12, giving up 152.7 yards a game. \n“We’re gonna be a better team this week than we were last week,” Spencer said. “How better you are is all about how you execute when you get the opportunity when they start keeping score again. We’ll see two Saturdays from now if that happened or not. But, the practice and the effort to do that is here.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T02:56:35.507+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
