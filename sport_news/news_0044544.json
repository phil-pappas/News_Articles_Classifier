More \nThe 49ers, who trailed 13-6 at the half, scored 21 points on touchdown passes by quarterback Colin Kaepernick to wide receiver Anquan Boldin and tight end Garrett Celek, plus a 2-yard carry by running back Carlos Hyde, each of those scores capping drives that spanned at least 80 yards. \nHyde's touchdown with 1:45 to play put San Francisco on top 27-23. \nHowever, New York, even with top receivers Odell Beckham Jr. and Rueben Randle missing chunks of the second half due to hamstring strains, found a way to get it done. \nManning, who finished 41 of 54 for 441 yards and one interception, connected on two of his three touchdown passes in the second half. He threw a 17-yard scoring pass to Beckham prior to the receiver exiting the game with a hamstring injury, and the game-winner to Donnell, his second touchdown catch of the year. \nNew York (3-2) increased its grip on first place in the NFC East. The Giants will visit the Philadelphia Eagles a week from Monday with an eye toward avenging last year's embarrassing 27-0 loss, which also took place in front of a national television audience. \nThe 49ers (1-4) lost their fourth in a row. They head home to host the Baltimore Ravens next Sunday. \nThe Giants led 13-6 at halftime, with Beckham catching five passes for 89 yards. He finished with 121 yards on seven catches, the ninth time in his career that reached triple figures in receiving yards. \nBoldin finished with eight catches for 107 yards. Hyde gained 93 yards on 21 carries, and quarterback Colin Kaepernick was 23-for-35 for 262 yards and two touchdowns with no interceptions. \nTwo of Beckham's longest receptions in the half were directly responsible for New York's first 10 points. \nHis first was a 49-yard grab that set up the first of Josh Brown's two field goals to knot the game at 3-3. \nBeckham made a 31-yard catch to set the stage for running back Shane Vereen's 2-yard touchdown reception, his first score as a Giant, to make it 10-3. Vereen wound up with eight catches for 86 yards and five carries for 24 yards. \nThe 49ers' only points of the half came on their opening and final drives of the half, both field goals by kicker Phil Dawson. \nOn the first drive, Kaepernick was 2-for-2 for 39 yards, including a 30-yard receiver screen to Bruce Ellington that pushed the ball deep into Giants territory. \nBrown added his second field goal of the half, a 41-yarder, to give the Giants a 13-3 lead with 4:02 left in the half. San Francisco responded with a 22-yard Dawson field goal. \nThe Giants came close to extending their lead in the final seconds of the half, but Manning tried to force a pass to Beckham in the corner of the end zone, and it was picked off by safety Antoine Bethea for a touchback. \nNOTES: Giants MLB Jon Beason was injured while tackling RB Carlos Hyde on the 49ers' opening possession. Beason was taken into the locker room, where he was diagnosed with a concussion. ... The 49ers had 115 passing yards in the first half, 66 of which came on three pass plays of 15 or more yards, including a 30-yard screen to WR Bruce Ellington, a 19-yard reception in the flat by FB Bruce Miller and a 17-yard catch by WR Torrey Smith. ... Giants TE Will Tye made his first NFL reception, a 12-yard gain that went for a first down late in the first quarter. ... With the win, his 167th in the regular season, Giants coach Tom Coughlin passed Hall of Famer Paul Brown for the 12th most regular-season victories in NFL history.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T08:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T13:59:48.380+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
