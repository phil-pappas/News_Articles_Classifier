The whole crew is happy and relaxed, though a bit exhausted because we have had 15-20 knots every day. It’s been a challenge to keep energy levels high.” \nOf the 23 races completed so far over the past three days, TWM has achieved a remarkable 11 wins with a total of 19 podium places, while Stevie Morrison’s Oman Air has to date posted 13 podium spots, including one outright win, which according to the skipper reflects a strong performance. \n“We are loving Istanbul and feel we deserve these results because we always knew we had good sailors on board and have worked very hard all season. But I have never made it to the podium in this format, which I am keen to do with this team,” said Morrison. “We feel confident that we can carry on sailing well and if we do that and continue enjoying some good fortune, the result will take care of itself.” \nOman Air is heading for its best result of the series. Its previous best was fourth in Muscat earlier this year and Ali al Balushi, who joined the ESS for the last event in Sydney in 2014, describes the prospect of finishing on the podium as ‘something huge’. \n“We are fighting hard and pushing hard all the time. We have been improving with each event. We are sailing well and loving it. Finishing second will be huge,” Balushi said. \nResults [Act 7]: 1 The Wave, Muscat (203 pts), 2 Oman Air (168), 3 SAP Extreme Sailing Team (159), 4 GAC Pindar (145), 5 Lino Sonego Team Italia (137), 6 Gazprom Team Russia (121), 7 Red Bull Sailing Team (120), 8 Team Turx (119).
