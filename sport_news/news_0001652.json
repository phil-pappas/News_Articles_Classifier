He got a key block around the 10-yard line from teammate Chris Outterbridge and completed a remarkable 57-yard touchdown run on a first-and-27 play to give Red Bank its first lead of the night with 6:04 left.\nThe Bucs’ defense then stopped Red Bank Catholic inches short of a first down on the Red Bank 20 with 1:57 remaining and then ran out the remaining time to record a 24-21 win before an overflowed crowd.\nThe win, Red Bank’s first over Red Bank Catholic since 2004, enabled it to improve to 6-0 and continue the magical start to its season.", "external_links": ["http://www.hudl.com/athlete/4446654/chris-outterbridge", "http://www.hudl.com/athlete/3055211/jack-navitsky"], "published": "2015-10-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T02:25:59.937+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
