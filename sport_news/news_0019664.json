The answer is \"No\", but the Ravens gave it one helluva try, falling short, 63-58. Frederick Douglass Academy III High School was electric on Tuesday evening. The packed gym had a regular season vibe and intensity as the two Bronx schools faced off against each other. Wilson and Washington were both sidelined due to disciplinary issues which gave some Ravens role players and newbies a chance to steal the spotlight in the semifinal round of the Tru-Ballaz Pre-High School Classic and pilfer they did. St. Ray's led 5-0 lead early off inspired play.The Ravens run would end, but impressive play by 6'3\" Darius Lee '18 and Omar Silverio '18 kept the Catholic school out front, 11-2 with 2:07. Wings Academy closed the gap but Rays finished the quarter strong and led by 9 to begin the second quarter.The game moved at a frenetic pace and the question would be, could the Ravens keep playing efficiently at this tempo?
