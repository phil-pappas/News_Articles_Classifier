Posted Oct. 3, 2015 at 12:03 AM Updated at 12:09 AM Posted Oct. 3, 2015 at 12:03 AM Updated at 12:09 AM CRESTVIEW – Kalin Lovett jumped in the air Friday and grabbed Crestview quarterback Corey Armstrong’s pass as if he was a Bulldogs receiver. He was wearing the black and green Choctaw jerseys, though. And when he landed and sprinted the other way, all he saw was “green grass” and a big district win. The Indians' defense led Choctaw's 21-6 win in the District 3-6A clash and Okaloosa County rivalry, and it was that defense putting Choctaw in what might be a de-facto district championship game in two weeks against Niceville. “I think the defense is playing really well,” Choctaw coach Greg Thomas said. “We turned it over. We have to take care of that. But I’m proud of them.” No matter how many chances Crestview (3-3, 0-1) had, and the Bulldogs had quite a few to take the lead or complete a 14-point comeback, the defense from Choctaw (4-2, 1-0) stood tall time and time again. There were three Choctaw fumbles, all in Crestview territory. There was the failed fourth-and-2 play in the first quarter. Crestview managed only 198 yards on offense, 100 from Armstrong’s 16-of-33 passing night. Choctaw, which could’ve won by more if not for the costly turnovers, gained 331 yards. Yet, the only time Crestview capitalized was after a roughing the kicker penalty on a punt. Crestview quarterback Corey Armstrong found Andrew Adkins on a 13-yard touchdown in a fourth-and-short situation. That cut the Choctaw lead to 14-6, but it was merely a short rally for Crestview. Choctaw quarterback Jake Fairly fumbled on the next possession, but Crestview’s drive stalled at the Indians’ 34-yard line with Armstrong’s incomplete pass into the end zone. “When we get down on offense,” Lovett said, “we pick it up on defense. That’s what we do.” The stop energized Choctaw’s offense, which scored on Fairly’s 9-yard swing pass to running back Marquise Kane. That was Fairly’s second touchdown pass, the first a short strike to Chris Pickett in the second quarter. Choctaw led 7-0 at halftime and quickly stretched the lead to 14-0 with Lovett’s interception return. Fittingly, Pickett secured the win with an interception in the final minute. It was him, Lovett and the Indians’ defense celebrating, something the group definitely deserved.
