And if the Eagles, who stand at 3-4 overall and 0-4 in the ACC, are to snap a three-game losing streak this Saturday at Papa John’s Stadium against Louisville (Ch. 38, 12:30 p.m.), the offense is going to need to continue to improve. After scoring a grand total of one touchdown in their first three conference games -- all losses -- the Eagles put up 17 on a strong Tigers’ defense in a 34-17 loss. And true freshman quarterback Jeff Smith, while still having trouble connecting on passing attempts, at least showed the ability to take advantage of good field position in the first start of his career after splitting time with redshirt freshman Troy Flutie the three previous games. “Obviously we're a young team,” said BC coach Steve Addazio, “so we’re having a hard time making explosive plays and we’ve made some mistakes along the way. That’s a sign of a team that’s not very (experienced), especially on the offensive side of the ball. But they play hard, which lays the groundwork for the future, where we know we’ve got some talent. “Now it’s about growing that talent and getting experience.” As it’s been against each of BC’s four ACC opponents, scoring will be difficult against the Cardinals. Louisville, though just 2-4 overall and 1-2 in the ACC, has played a murderous early season schedule that includes Auburn, Houston, Clemson, and Florida State. But despite playing a slate that includes three undefeated teams with high powered offenses and a 4-2 squad from the SEC West, the Cardinals have allowed a respectable average of 23.7 points per game. They rank 37th in total defense giving up 354.8 yards per game, and are 45th in rushing defense allowing 144.5 yards per game. BC, particularly with Smith, who is a runner first while he struggles in the passing game, as always will attempt to establish the run. It’s the one part of the offense that’s been decent all season, averaging 206.1 yards per game, and if the Eagles can grind out yards on the ground they won’t have to rely on Smith’s erratic arm -- he’s completing just 30.8 percent of his passes. Still, if Smith is forced to throw, the freshman has something to build on after throwing the first touchdown pass of his career in the first quarter last weekend. “We’ve been getting better the last couple of weeks,” said Smith. “We just have to keep that going and keep improving on our execution and scoring points.” He added, “I think we kind of set forth that we’re getting better. We put up 17 points. We have to build off of that.” While the offense’s greatest obstacle is its own inexperience, the defense faces a stiff challenge. After dominating the first six games of the season -- BC led the nation in both rushing defense and passing defense prior to playing Clemson -- the Eagles faced a dual threat quarterback for the first time last weekend, and the Tigers’ Deshaun Watson exposed some weaknesses while throwing for 420 yards against the Eagles. Louisville also boasts a dual threat quarterback. Freshman Lamar Jackson has thrown for 905 yards with six touchdowns and five interceptions, and has also run for 467 yards and five scores. If he’s able to extend passing plays with his legs he’ll have the opportunity to beat BC downfield, but if the Eagles can keep him contained they should have more success against the Louisville offense than they did against Clemson. “That quarterback is really fast, extremely fast, so we have to be really disciplined keeping him inside the pocket,” said junior defensive tackle Truman Gutapfel. “Like we’ve been doing all season, we just have to keep up with that stuff.” Similarly, senior safety Justin Simmons said, “Offensively, they’re a great team. They move the ball well. Their quarterback is an outstanding athlete and we just have to make sure that we compete and make the plays that we’ve been making all year.” Given how well the BC defense played throughout the first six weeks of the season, and given that players were in the right position to make stops against Clemson but just missed on their opportunities, it’s likely that Louisville won’t put up 34 points on the Eagles. It’s instead likely that BC will hold the Cardinals down the way they’ve held most opponents down. And that puts the game -- the possibility of breaking a three-game losing streak -- in the hands of Smith and the young offense.
