Friday and Belmont, the Cavaliers advanced the ball into opponent territory. Belmont already had the game well in-hand, leading 50-0 as the clock counted down the last seconds on their regular season. But although the result was already determined, the Wildcats were determined to keep W.C. Friday out of the end zone on this particular drive. Belmont coach Danny Green and assistant Hunter Armstrong gestured from the sideline to position their defenders, and the Wildcats tackled a W.C. Friday ball-carrier well short of the end zone as the clock ran to zeroes. It was the seventh straight shutout for Belmont, whose defense did not allow a single point through seven regular season games. The Wildcats head to Gaston County playoffs with a 7-0 record, and outscored their opponents 271-0 in the regular season. Green said the team worked hard through practice to make the impressive accomplishment possible, and never lost focus during a game to allow a big play against them. “They’re hard-nosed kids, when it’s 32 minutes on that clock they want all 32 minutes of the time. That’s the way they are. It’s a good group of kids and I’m very proud of them,” Green said. Belmont will face Southwest Middle School of Gastonia Tuesday at South Point High School in a 4:15 p.m. game to start its postseason. If the Wildcats can keep the shutout streak going, they will put themselves in the history books. Two teams, Ashley in 1980 and Bessemer City in 2004, are tied for the record for fewest points allowed, each with six. No middle school team has ever gone through a complete season without allowing a point.
