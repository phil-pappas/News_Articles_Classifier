Their demand for revocation of the suspension of Jaspal Rana, against whom an FIR has been lodged, was not acceptable, he added. Kherwal told mediapersons that the government had kept its doors open. “We are willing to act on the genuine demands of workers but as the programme is funded by the Central Government. The demand to regularise their services and give them maternity leave cannot be met. The Centre approves the project and the number of employees to be employed,” he said. The contractual employees are boycotting work for the past five days and demanding permanent jobs, maternity leave, Human Resource Manual, provident fund and above all revocation of Jaspal Rana’s suspension. “The issue of Jaspal Rana is non-negotiable, a criminal inquiry is underway as he had torn the pages from an official file,” said Kherwal. So far, 20 workers have reported back to work. Today, the government invited the workers for talks to break the impasse. The National Rural Health Mission was started in Uttarakhand in 2006 to arrest the infant and maternal mortality rate in the state. Now, it is known as NHM.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T04:03:29.783+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
