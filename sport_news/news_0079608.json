Johnson finished with six catches for 77 yards. \nThe Colts extended their AFC South division winning streak to an NFL-record 16 games. \nThe 40-year-old Hasselbeck was filling in for Andrew Luck, who missed his second straight game with a shoulder injury. \nHasselbeck's performance was even more impressive given the fact that he was battling a bacterial infection that hospitalized him this week. He started feeling ill just before halftime Sunday in a victory over Jacksonville and didn't start feeling better until Thursday night. \n\"You get over the age of 30, they kind of count you out,\" Johnson said. \"But we proved to people that we could still play.\" \nJohnson entered the game without a catch in the last two games after having just one such game in his entire career in Houston. \nHouston quarterback Ryan Mallett was replaced by Brian Hoyer after going down hard from an illegal hit midway through the second quarter. \nHoyer finished with 312 yards passing with two touchdowns and an interception. Both of the touchdowns were to rookie Jaelen Strong and they came on his first two NFL receptions.
