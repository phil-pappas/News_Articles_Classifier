His big, physical presence — he’s listed at 6-foot-5, 220 pounds — matches well with a puck-moving offensive-minded player such as Yandle.\n“Usually, that’s what you’re looking for,” Vigneault said. “I’m anxious to see how they’re going to play together. It’s going to be Dylan’s first game. I’m hoping we’re going to see the Dylan we saw in training camp. He was a real effective player for us.”\nIt may not last more than one game, Vigneault cautioned, but McIlrath is ready for the chance he is being given.\n“Very excited,” McIlrath said. “I’m looking to make the most out of a good opportunity.”\nVigneault said Henrik Lundqvist will be back in net Tuesday, and declined to give a timetable on when he plans to get new backup Antti Raanta a start. Lundqvist has played very well, allowing just six goals in three games while making 100 saves.\n“Our goaltender is where we want him to be, there’s no doubt there,” the coach said. “He’s played extremely well.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T17:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T01:31:17.283+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
