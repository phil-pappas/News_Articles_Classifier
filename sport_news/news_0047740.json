When he arrived at the gas station parking lot, he saw a four-door white Ford Focus leaving and a black pickup truck parked there. Another officer saw a white car speeding west on 10th Street. The officer followed the car and discovered the shooting victim was inside. She had suffered a gunshot wound that traveled through her neck. The teen was transported from St. Mary Medical Center in Hobart to an Illinois trauma center for treatment.\nFive other people in the car said they had been at a party earlier that evening and all decided to leave with other friends. They traveled in two vehicles and planned to meet at McDonald's, which is next door to the gas station. One witness told police the group was \"horsing around\" with one another. As they began to get back in their cars to leave, a Hispanic man with long hair who was wearing a cowboy hat, boots and jeans walked toward the car, court documents said. The witness said he looked back as they were driving away and noticed the same man reach across his body, pull a handgun from his waistband, point it at their car and begin firing, the probable cause affidavit states. It was then that the witness realized the teen had been shot.\nPolice obtained surveillance video from the gas station and noted that the pickup was a mid-1990s black Chevrolet with after-market chrome rims.\nPolice spoke with an officer who had worked security at a quinceanera earlier that evening. That officer recalled seeing guests wearing cowboy boots and hats. Police viewed surveillance video from the party and noticed the same truck had arrived at the American Legion Post 54 that evening around 5 p.m. and that the same man appeared to have gotten out of the truck and went inside the hall. The man left with another individual around midnight. The family who had rented the hall assisted police in identifying the man as Sanzon, according to court documents.\nSuburban Chicago arrest photos Open link According to the Hobart police Facebook page, Sanzon is not in custody and is considered armed and dangerous.\nThe victim has been released from the hospital and is recovering from her injuries.\nRuth Ann Krause is a freelance reporter for the Post-Tribune.\nCopyright Â© 2015, Post-Tribune Shootings Crime", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-56211bfc/turbine/chi-suburban-chicago-arrest-photos", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-56202d23/turbine/ct-ptb-hobart-shooting-charge-st-1016-20151015"], "published": "2015-10-16T15:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T19:03:30.089+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
