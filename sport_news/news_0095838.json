That’s clear, and then we will play again against Benfica and Galatasaray to determine first place.” \nIn the other group match, Benfica travels to Galatasaray to play against a Turkish team that has taken just one point from the first two matches and sits last alongside Astana. \nHere are some things to know about Wednesday’s matches: \n___ \nWAITING FOR GOALS \nMartinez scored a combined 81 goals in the Portuguese league and the Champions League during three seasons at Porto. \nHis move to Spain was widely seen as an upgrade from the departing Mario Mandzukic and sparked talk that Atletico could field an attack potent enough to rekindle another outsider run at the league title it won in 2014, the same year it also reached the Champions League final. \nBut Martinez has yet to click with his new team and has netted only one goal in 10 appearances. Torres hasn’t done much better with two goals in 10 matches, leaving Antoine Griezmann to hold up the front line. \nGriezmann has scored six goals this season, including a brilliant solo run to open Atletico’s 2-0 win at Real Sociedad on Sunday. \nDespite his mantra of going ahead “game by game,” Atletico coach Diego Simeone will likely deploy a starting lineup keeping in mind Sunday’s visit by Spanish league rival Valencia. \n___ \nOUT OF SORTS \nWhile Astana may have earned its first Champions League point with a draw against Galatasaray, its recent form has been patchy. \nWins in its last two Kazakh league matches ended a five-game winless run for Astana, though neither of the recent performances was particularly impressive as Astana scraped one-goal wins over lower-ranked opposition. \nThe Champions League’s first Kazakh club has a fight on its hands to retain its domestic league title, sitting five points behind league leader Kairat Almaty with four games to play. To add to the pressure, Astana’s lengthy trip from Central Asia to Madrid is followed Sunday by a make-or-break game against Kairat. \n___ \nLONG TIME, NO WIN \nGalatasaray, which claimed both the Turkish league and cup last season, is in dire need of breaking a winless streak in Europe. \nGalatasaray hasn’t won in 10 consecutive matches against continental opponents. This season it started its Champions League campaign with a 2-0 home defeat to Atletico before the humbling draw at Astana. \nTwo-time champion Benfica has its own bit of history to go against: the reigning Portuguese champions haven’t won in four visits to Turkey.
