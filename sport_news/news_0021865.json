The accessory stops the bench from being soaked by the perspiration of the current user. This leaves the bench surface clean and dry for the next user. The unit eliminates the need to spray and wipe the bench before and after each use. All of this enhances hygiene among fitness enthusiasts who enjoy working out at health clubs and gyms. Furthermore, the device is easy to apply and remove.\nThe original design was submitted to the Charlotte office of InventHelp. It is currently available for licensing or sale to manufacturers or marketers.
