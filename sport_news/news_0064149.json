But that's not my job.\" \nCouturier missed the final two periods of the Flyers' 5-4 overtime victory in Boston and likely will sit out Saturday's home game against the New York Rangers with an upper-body injury. \nRinaldo's hard check just before the first-period horn was a shoulder-to-shoulder hit, but his follow through caught Couturier's chin, snapping his head back. \nRinaldo received a five-minute charging major and game misconduct, but avoided being suspended for the fourth time in five NHL seasons after a review by the league's department of safety. \n\"On our side, you argue that there was head contact and they say it wasn't principle point of contact,\" Hextall said \"It's a tough one and there is a lot of subjectivity. Obviously, they came up with their decision and we're going to live with it.\" \nDirector of player safety Patrick Burke announced his department's decision Thursday night in a video that explained his decision in detail. \nALSO: Flyers practice: Brayden Schenn back; Neuvirth comes and goes \n\"In fairness to the league, I would not want to have that job,\" Hextall said. \"It's a hard job. It's a hard job trying to figure out what's legal, what's illegal. I know this: They do a lot of due diligence. They look at everything, and then they make their decision. And it's almost like no matter what decision they make, one team's upset.\" \nIn this case, Hextall isn't happy that Rinaldo's latest controversial hit injured his second-line center. \nCouturier practiced on Friday, but didn't take part in line rushes and is \"not probable\" to play Saturday, Hextall said. A return for Tuesday's home game against the Buffalo Sabres seems likely. \nLast January, Hextall stood up for Rinaldo after an illegal check that injured Pittsburgh Penguins star defenseman Kris Letang got him an eight-game suspension. \n\"When someone's on your team, you tend to look at things different from when they're on another team,\" Hextall said. \"That's reality, right? There's always two sides to a story. Which side you support tends to be what favors you. It's sometimes hard to be objective, I guess.\" \nRinaldo has a long history of being a bad boy. In 229 NHL games, he has 16 points, 597 penalty minutes and three suspensions. Before that, he had 69 points, 649 penalty minutes and six suspensions in 185 junior games, and 16 points and 434 penalty minutes and four suspensions in 95 AHL games. \nWas Rinaldo's dirty play a reason the Flyers traded him? \n\"I'll not going to talk about that,\" Hextall said. \"Zac's an effective NHL player.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T20:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T23:29:39.633+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
