Taran Lambert, who ran for 111 yards and a touchdown, suffered a game-ending injury. QB Hunter Anderson finished with 243 yards and a TD, and Jacob Zamora caught three passes for 75 yards and a score and returned an interception for a touchdown. \nLions update : Lynden now has won two straight, both in decisive fashion, after starting the year 1-2. Powered by Sterling Somers’ 275 yards and three touchdowns, the Lions earned a 47-14 NWC road win against Sehome last week. Jordan Wittenberg logged six catches for 138 yards and a touchdown, and Lynden’s defense held Sehome’s rush attack to 2.8 yards per carry. \nKey to the game: This should be Lynden’s first real test since Week 3. Lynden has the secondary to limit Burlington-Edison’s pass attack. It’s the Lions’ defensive front that will need a big game against the Tigers’ strong run game. \nPlayer to watch: Nathan Gomes and the physicality he can bring up front on the defensive line should be important in this game. \nPrediction: Lynden 31-27 Anacortes (2-3, 0-3 NWC) at Blaine (3-2, 1-2 NWC) \nTime: 7 p.m. \nSite: Blaine High School \nSeahawks update: Anacortes’ defense was no match for Ferndale’s offense last week, and the Seahawks took a 55-14 NWC road loss. Anacortes yielded 296 rush yards and six TDs on 28 carries (10.6 avg.). Running back P.J. Monroe saw his first action of the season and went for 74 yards on 21 carries. QB Camden McLaughlin was 8 of 13 for 62 yards, a TD and an INT. \nBorderites update : Blaine’s air attack was grounded last week, and on defense, the Borderites couldn’t stop Sedro-Woolley’s passing game during a 48-8 road NWC defeat. Riley Fritsch racked up 112 yards on 19 carries, but Jalen Kortlever threw for only 88 yards on seven completions. Blaine yielded 329 pass yards and four scores and 232 rush yards and three TDs. \nKey to the game: Anacortes should be a good opponent for Blaine to get back on track with its passing attack. If the Borderites can shake the rust from last week, they should have no problem with the Seahawks. \nPlayer to watch: Look for Kortlever, Anthony Ball and Jonathan Starcer to get their chemistry back in the pass game this week. \nPrediction: Blaine 42-7 Lynden Christian (4-1, 1-1 NWC) at Mount Baker (4-1, 2-0 NWC) \nTime: 7 p.m. \nSite: Mount Baker High School \nLyncs update: Breakout running back David Bladies continued his impressive season with another huge performance, rushing for 249 yards and three touchdowns to help Lynden Christian earn a 19-14 NWC home win over Nooksack Valley last week. LC, in all, racked up 301 rush yards, and the Lyncs’ defense limited the Pioneers to 22. \nMountaineers update : Quarterback Mason Bass connected with T.J. Bass for a 16-yard touchdown with less than a minute remaining to propel Mount Baker to a thrilling 33-28 NWC road win over Meridian last week. Bass had a career game, throwing for 258 yards and three touchdowns. Carson Engholm added 120 rush yards on 21 carries. \nKey to the game: If LC stands a chance, it needs a huge defensive effort. The Lyncs have been good on defense this year, and surely they’ll need to key on NWC leading rusher Jed Schleimer. \nPlayer to watch: It’ll be interesting to see how LB’s Nathan Wynstra and Lucas Roetcisoender handle Mount Baker’s physicality. \nPrediction: Mount Baker 45-17 Crescent (2-3, 0-1 NW1B) at Lummi (3-1, 1-0 NW1B) \nTime: 6 p.m. \nSite: Lummi High School \nLoggers update: Crescent fell behind 50-20 last week to Tulalip Heritage and took a 78-48 home loss. Receiver Eric Emery had 106 yards and two TDs and returned a kickoff for a TD. \nBlackhawks update : Trazil Lane caught seven passes for 256 yards and scored six touchdowns to help Lummi earn a 72-22 league win over Clallam Bay last week. QB Jonathan Casimir threw for 437 yards and nine TDs. \nKey to the game: If Casimir does a good job of getting the ball in his playmakers’ hands, Crescent has no shot. \nPlayer to watch: Jeff Cultee will look to replicate last week’s effort when he ran for 100 yards and a TD on six carries. \nPrediction: Lummi 74-22 Ferndale (4-1, 3-0 NWC) at Squalicum (5-0, 3-0 NWC) \nTime: 7 p.m. Saturday, Oct. 10 \nSite: Civic Stadium \nGolden Eagles update: Ferndale’s offense carved up Anacortes last week, and the Golden Eagles earned a 55-14 NWC home win. Running back Cole Semu ran for 139 yards and two touchdowns on seven carries, and QB James Hinson completed 6 of 7 passes for 106 yards and had touchdown passes to Justice Powell and Winterhawk Leighton. \nStorm update : Ben Peterson scored Squalicum’s first 24 points last week and helped the Storm earn a 54-31 NWC road win over Burlington-Edison. Josiah Westbrook caught four passes for 125 yards and two touchdowns and also added a rushing score. QB Garrett Sorenson completed 8 of 14 passes for 227 yards, three TDs and two INTs. \nKey to the game: Squalicum’s offense has been terrific this season with a wealth of playmakers. But Ferndale has arguably the best defense in the NWC. Squalicum’s ability on defense to match Ferndale’s physical run game could be the key here. \nPlayer to watch: Squalicum needs to establish a run game, and with Damek Mitchell likely not available, the Storm will turn to backup Triston Smith. Squalicum will need a strong game out of the capable senior. \nPrediction: Squalicum 27-21 Sehome (2-3, 1-2 NWC) at Sedro-Woolley (3-2, 1-2 NWC) \nTime: 7 p.m. \nSite: Sedro-Woolley High School \nMariners update: Sehome used a fifth quarterback last week, Jace Rinker, and took a 47-14 NWC home loss to Lynden. The Mariners had no answer for the Lions’ pass attack, yielding 273 yards. Kevin Sun led Sehome with 32 rush yards and a TD, and Rinker was 14 of 21 for 152 yards and threw two INTs. \nCubs update : Sedro-Woolley welcomed the return of Carter Crosby, and the senior helped the Cubs roll to a 48-8 NWC home win over Blaine last week. Crosby ran for a team-high 94 yards and two TDs, and QB Devin Willard threw for 253 yards and four touchdown passes. \nKey to the game: Without an explosive offense, Sehome needs to get back to its stingy defensive play. The Mariners will need to be disciplined against Sedro-Woolley’s many offensive looks. \nPlayer to watch: Tanner Patrick plays with a physical edge, and he’ll need to help set the tone against Woolley. \nPrediction: Sedro-Woolley 41-14 Meridian (2-3, 1-1 NWC) at Nooksack Valley (0-5, 0-2 NWC) \nTime: 7 p.m. \nSite: Nooksack Valley High School \nTrojans update: Meridian gave up a touchdown with less than a minute left last week and suffered a 33-28 heartbreaking NWC home loss to Mount Baker. QB Simon Burkett completed 15 of 31 passes for 166 yards, two TDs and had an INT. He also ran for a score. The Trojans’ defense slowed down league-leading running back Jed Schleimer, but allowed 258 passing yards and three touchdowns. \nPioneers update : Nooksack Valley had its narrowest margin of defeat last week, taking a 19-14 road loss to Lynden Christian. QB Casey Bauman completed 20 of 40 passes for 230 yards and threw touchdowns to Tre Silva and Michael O’Bryan. The Pioneers amassed only 22 rush yards and 24 attempts. \nKey to the game: The Pioneers have given up 972 rush yards the past two games. Nooksack Valley needs to place a premium on its rush defense. \nPlayer to watch: Nick Dritsas could be in line for a big day against Nooksack Valley’s defense. \nPrediction: Meridian 55-21 Bellevue Christian (3-2) at Bellingham (2-3) \nTime: 7 p.m. \nSite: Civic Stadium \nVikings update: Bellevue Christian failed to score a touchdown last week, but put together a gritty defensive performance to earn a 9-7 win over Cascade Leavenworth. Dylan Parsons ran for 87 yards on 27 carries. \nRed Raiders update : Isiah Harrington ran for 108 yards and three TDs, Nick Knutson threw for 218 yards and three scores, Zach Lorenz hauled in two long touchdown passes and Bellingham earned a 54-8 road win over Friday Harbor last week. \nKey to the game: As good as Bellingham’s offense was last week, Bellevue Christian’s defense is more on Sehome’s and Squalicum’s level. If the Red Raiders can keep their offensive momentum, they have a shot. \nPlayer to watch: Lorenz has emerged as a big-play target for Knutson. Look for the duo to hook-up a time or two against Bellevue Christian. \nPrediction: Bellevue Christian 24-14", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T00:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T03:25:49.049+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
