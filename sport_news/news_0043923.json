He added that it was their opinion that such entertainment programmes should not be held under such circumstances.\nWhile the state government, in which the Shiv Sena is the BJP's junior partner, had offered to provide security to Ghulam Ali, Aditya said instead of securing the singer, it was necessary to beef up security at the border for Indians.\nThe Shiv Sena opposes cultural and sports ties with Pakistan over sponsoring of terrorism and crime in India. In October 1991, former MNS MLA Shishir Shinde, who was then in the Shiv Sena, had dug up the pitch at the Wankhede stadium to protest an India-Pakistan cricket match which was to be played there.\nIn 2013, the Shiv Sena had protested against the inclusion of Pakistani players in a hockey match, forcing the organisers to remove them from the team. It also opposed the Centre's plans to grant a visa to cricketer Javed Miandad and charged that this would be akin to \"laying out a red carpet\" for underworld don Dawood Ibrahim, whose daughter is married to Miandad's son.\nThe Sena had also castigated Narendra Modi, who was then the BJP's prime ministerial nominee, for allowing the Pakistan cricket team to play a match on Indian soil at Rajkot.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T14:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T06:32:10.684+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
