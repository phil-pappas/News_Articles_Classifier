I give no quarter and I ask for none. Out there I'm going to fight for my team and do the best I can.\n\"I got where I am because of the way I play. I'm not going to change because of other people's opinions.\n\"On the pitch you do everything to win the game, when the match is over I go home to my friends and family, I joke around, I'm a normal guy, but on the pitch don't put wings on me because I'm no angel.\"\nCosta said he has had to learn to look after himself in the Premier League, where he believes referees give less protection to attacking players.\n\"I receive fouls that would result in yellow or red cards in Spain, but here it's seen as part of the game,\" he said.\n\"The countries have different footballing theories. But I'm not going to start complaining. It's my job to adapt to the culture and the way the game is played here, not to complain.\n\"I think that my efforts are there for all to see.\"\nChelsea have made a poor start to the season and are in 12th place, 10 points behind leaders Manchester City, going into this weekend's London derby at high-flying West Ham United.\nHowever, Costa says rumours of discontent in the Chelsea dressing room are way off the mark.\n\"Things aren't going so well for the team right now, but it's not because of the changing room,\" said Costa.\n\"The atmosphere is great. During the year I've spent here, there hasn't been one argument. There are normally disagreements in all changing rooms, but it hasn't happened here.\"\n(For more sports news and updates, follow Ahram Online Sports on Twitter at @AO_Sports and on Facebook at AhramOnlineSports .)", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/AO_Sports", "https://www.facebook.com/AhramOnlineSports?fref=ts"], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T18:16:31.218+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
