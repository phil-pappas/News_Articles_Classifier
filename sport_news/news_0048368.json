While the game slipped away from the Pirates relatively fast, in terms of the literal time it took for Temple to take its lasting lead and score an insurance touchdown, East Carolina felt it prevented itself from securing the win solidly long before the final minutes. \n“Penalties, that’s the whole game,” running back Chris Hairston said. “We had too many, we can’t have that many penalties. If we just cut that in half, the outcome could’ve been different. Penalties just held the whole team back.” \nECU had six penalties in the first half for 79 yards and a total of nine in the game for 99 yards, and while Temple had more (12 penalties for 114 yards), the effects of the flags resonated even harder with the Pirates than in just the number of yards ECU lost on any given play. \n“Penalties, it kills a team,” defensive back Josh Hawkins said. “It gives the offense a free down – you’re third-and-five, now you’re first and ten. Penalties really kills us and coach Ruffin (McNeill) exaggerates on how we never want penalties because it’s us beating ourselves.” \nThe timing of the penalties – negating big yards and giving the opponent a mental reset – and the number of penalties that ECU had against Temple was “very deflating,” according to Hairston (who had 65 yards, leading his team in ground gains) and quarterback Blake Kemp – who lead all but two of ECU’s drives – agrees. \n“We kind of shot ourselves in the foot with penalties and couple turnovers and Temple’s a good team,” Kemp said. “(The difference in the game was) putting ourselves in bad situations. We never were ahead of the chains the whole night. We were third-and-long or second-and-long, it makes it really hard on coach (Dave) Nichol to make a call when we put ourselves in those positions.” \nAfter the loss, head coach Ruffin McNeill talked to his team about the same things he said he’s discussed with them since the week before the Pirates played at Florida – harping on the same things he has since that week. \n“When I started reading off the things that we’ve been talking about, it clicked – not stopping ourselves, penalties,” he said. “That stopped us early, we overcame some but that gives you a strain to overcome penalties like we did.” \nIt’s clear that the errors did in fact resonate with the Pirates. \n“It held us back tremendously and we have to fix that,” Hairston said. “There’s no excuses for that, it has to be fixed.” \n“That penalty it sets the team back, we can have a good drive and the penalty just brings it all back. Coaches tell us not to worry about it, just play the next play, but it just eveyrbody’s got to continue to work technique and no more stupid penalties.” \nThe effects of the penalties were clear to the players in their loss. \n“I think we gave them 100 yards, we basically said, ‘Walk down the field for free,’” Kemp said. “You can’t beat good teams when we do that and Temple’s a good team.” \n“It was big, we were fired up. We fully expected to win the game and it just didn’t happen.” Credits", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T09:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T10:21:28.556+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
