One player that will probably still be on the team is veteran first baseman Ryan Howard. Howard, who turns 36 in November, is owed $25 million in 2016, the final guaranteed year of his contract.\nThe Phillies hope he will be healthy heading into the year. Mackanin said before Wednesday’s game that it is “probably unlikely” Howard plays another game this season. Mackanin will talk with Howard, though, and see if he’s interested in getting into a game at some point during the Phillies’ final three-game series this weekend. Howard has not played since he left the game Sept. 14 with a left knee contusion.\nWhile he was considered to be available as a pinch hitter during Wednesday’s game against the Mets, Howard reported to Citizens Bank Park feeling under the weather and did not participate in pregame batting practice.\nManaging a rebuilding team next season won’t be easy for Mackanin, but his greatest test is shaping up to involve the aging veteran that is a shell of his former self. When asked Wednesday if handling Howard and his playing time will be one of his biggest challenges next year, Mackanin replied, \"Yep, for sure.\"\n“He put up some productive numbers, but his average is down, not to where we’d want it to be,” Mackanin said. “Very similar to last year. So as far as analyzing his performance, it wasn’t the best performance, it wasn’t the greatest. He needs to get better.”\nIf Howard’s season is over, he finishes with a .229 average, career-low .277 on-base percentage, 23 home runs, 29 doubles (his most since 2011) and 77 RBI. Although Howard showed he’s capable of hitting for power, a valuable asset for a Phillies offense that has desperately needed power hitters in the lineup this season, he has often been a liability in other areas of his game.\nMackanin also dodged a question about whether Howard is a platoon player, an expensive one too, at this point in his career. Howard owns a .130 average against left-handed pitchers this season with 40 strikeouts in 100 at-bats.\n“For me, numbers mean something,” Mackanin said. “When I have a player in [Darin] Ruf who’s hitting [.370] against lefties and has the highest OPS [1.092] in the major leagues against left-handed pitchers and only leads me to believe that’s the guy we should play against lefties. So I’ll just leave it at that.”\nMackanin conceded it’s possible that the player Howard is right now in his career is the type of player he will remain going forward. But he made clear there are areas of Howard’s game he must improve on, including his defense, which might be difficult due to his history of leg and knee injuries.\n“I don’t want to go there yet,” Mackanin said of whether Howard’s legs are getting better. “You look at a guy like Raul Ibanez, a guy who was pretty productive when he was 39 or 40. It all kind of comes down to Ryan’s health. How healthy his legs are next year. That’s going to be a determining factor.”\nSince earning the full-time managerial gig for 2016, Mackanin has talked about how he wants to emphasize fundamentals, base running and defense during spring training. None of those areas of Howard’s strength, and it’s clear Mackanin will want effort and dedication from Howard on the field and behind the scenes to improve. The problem is the Phillies don’t have much better options behind Howard to push him or replace him. While Ruf has been intriguing this season, punishing lefties in his limited playing time, there’s no Maikel Franco-caliber prospect at first base that Howard is blocking. It’s also difficult to imagine the Phillies releasing Howard and eating the $35 million he’s owed, which includes a $10 million buyout for 2017.\nHoward will probably be on the Phillies’ roster next season. However, there is no promise from Mackanin as to how much he will play next year, and that’s the right stance for the manager to take as he faces a tough balancing act between a former star in Howard and the desire to get other guys in the lineup who better fit the style of play he wants.\nContact Meghan Montemurro at mmontemurro@delawareonline.com .
