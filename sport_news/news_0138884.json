This pilot program is in response to thousands of Bud Light fans across the country contacting the brand via social media and customer service (close to 3,000 calls and emails), requesting the opportunity to purchase their favorite team's localized Bud Light packaging. Today, in New York City's borough of Manhattan , for the first time ever, fans of any of Bud Light's 28 teams can order Bud Light adorned with the NFL logo and colors of their choice delivered exclusively through Minibar.\nLaunched in August, the new NFL team-specific Bud Light packaging has been extremely popular with football fans across the country.

Geography doesn't affect their team spirit, and we don't want it to affect their ability to toast their favorite team with a cold Bud Light. Fans asked us to find a way, so we are delivering. The Minibar relationship in Manhattan is a pilot program. It's an example of how Bud Light is truly the beer of the fan, always working to bring people the convenient customization they're looking for – whether it's with the NFL, music or beyond.\"\n\"We're always exploring new, innovative ways to enhance the football watching experience, both in the stadium and in the home,\" said Lucas Herscovici , Vice President of Connections at Anheuser-Busch. \"Minibar already offers fans the ability to re-stock their fridge on game day without missing one second of the action. Now, in addition to choosing their favorite brand, Bud Light drinkers in Manhattan can choose their favorite NFL team as well. Technology and advanced customization continue to improve fans' personal relationship with sports.\"\nAvailable on the web and smartphone apps, Minibar ( www.minibardelivery.com ) gives football fans in Manhattan the opportunity to order their favorite NFL team's Bud Light cans for fast on-demand delivery within 30-60 minutes.
