(AP) - North Dakota State has confirmed that starting quarterback Carson Wentz will miss 6 to 8 weeks after breaking a bone in his throwing wrist. Bison athletic department spokesman Ryan Perreault says Wentz will undergo surgery Wednesday for the right wrist injury he suffered Saturday during the team's 24-21 loss to South Dakota in Fargo. Perreault says Wentz has a \"non-displaced fracture\" and is expected to miss the regular season. The team hasn't ruled out a possible return in the postseason. NDSU is the four-time defending Championship Subdivision champion. The Bison are 4-2 this season after the upset loss to the Coyotes that ended NDSU's 26-game home winning streak. Wentz is a senior from Bismarck. He passed for 1,454 yards and 16 touchdowns in the season's first six games. Â© 2015 Associated Press. All rights reserved.
