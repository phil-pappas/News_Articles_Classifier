Tide defensive lineman Jonathan Allen leads the team with five sacks. Eleven Alabama players have at least one sack. \nTwo of the biggest keys to the Tide’s improved pass rush have been outside linebacker coach Tosh Lupoi and increased snaps for junior Tim Williams. \nLupoi, who’s in his first year as the position coach at Alabama, is by far the Tide’s most animated player during practice drills. Lupoi can even be seen occasionally running through drills with the players. \n“He will always get you going, no matter what or how you feel,” Tide outside linebacker Denzel Devall said. “It has been an advantage for us because we been working on moves and stuff that we haven’t worked in the past, and it’s just been a positive.” \nSaban said Lupoi has been a “really positive addition” to the Tide’s coaching staff “in a lot of ways.” \n“He’s really positive, upbeat, the players like him, he has a lot of energy,” Saban said. “He’s been a defensive line coach and one of the things he’s spent a lot of time on is pass rush, and improving pass rush. I think he and (defensive line coach) Bo (Davis) work well together and that’s helped our edge rushers a little bit. It’s also helped us have some new ideas about the way we go about how we play third down and how we pressure people which has been beneficial to us to this point. So he’s made a very positive impact on all of the players we have who rush from the outside.” \nWilliams is second on the team with 3 1 / 2 sacks. Williams is a part of the Tide’s third-down rushing group, and has thrived when given the opportunity to get after the passer. \nAfter some struggles early in his career, Williams has matured off the field, which has led to more playing time. \n“Tim Williams has grown a lot, man, into a great pass rusher,” Devall said. “He’s just locked in right now. Every movement, everything you can work on, he takes it to practice every day and works on. It shows up every Saturday. \n“I look forward to every third down watching Tim get off on the edge because it’s crazy. It’s kinda like fireworks going off when he comes off the edge.” \n(8) ALABAMA VS.
