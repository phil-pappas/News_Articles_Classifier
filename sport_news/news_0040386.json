I'm flabbergasted about it. But as my father used to say: 'You make your bed, you've got to sleep in it.' I just think at this particular point of the season it's really, really not good.\n\"But I'll leave it at that. And I'm a Matt Harvey fan; I'm a Matt Harvey fan. I've defended him during his crisis, but as he said, there's no excuse.\"\nOn Wednesday, Ron Darling -- Hernandez's former Mets teammate and current SNY colleague -- told Newsday, \"It's really hard for me to criticize [Harvey]. Half our team didn't make the [1986 World Series] parade . . . We had guys who barely showed up to games.\"\nMets Darling on Harvey: 'It's not a big thing' Darling was responding to a crack from Mets pitching coach Dan Warthen, who had said, \"There were a lot of boys on that '86 team that didn't make practice, either.''\nSaid Hernandez: \"Oh, I think Ronnie was embellishing. We showed up on time. I think he was being funny. We showed up on time.\"\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T06:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T08:40:00.543+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
