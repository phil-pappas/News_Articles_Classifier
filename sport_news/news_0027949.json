But how much did they jump after beating a sluggish Bears team? Is it time to change the No. 1 team in the rankings? We'll see, as Brian Manzullo goes from No. 32 to No. 1... USA TODAY Sports 32. Jacksonville Jaguars (1-5, last week: 30): Blake Bortles is putting up fine fantasy numbers. So is Allen Robinson. Other than that, there’s nothing to look at here. USA TODAY Sports 31. Tennessee Titans (1-4, last week: 27): This team needs Marcus Mariota. Not for any other reason other than the fact that he’s the only reason they’re worth watching. USA TODAY Sports 30. Baltimore Ravens (1-5, last week: 25): They may be the biggest disappointment of the season so far (other than, you know, the Lions). USA TODAY Sports 29. Chicago Bears (2-4, last week: 21): When you lose to a bad Lions team, you drop big time. USA TODAY Sports 28. Detroit Lions (1-5, last week: 32): About time. The Lions are out of the basement, but they won’t go much higher unless they beat the Vikings this weekend. USA TODAY Sports 27. Kansas City Chiefs (1-5, last week: 24): 18 carries, 57 yards for the running game. Life without Jamaal Charles this season’s going to be rough. USA TODAY Sports 26. Houston Texans (2-4, last week: 29): DeAndre Hopkins (10 catches, 148 yards, 2 TDs) is filling in admirably for the departed Andre Johnson. USA TODAY Sports 25. Washington Redskins (2-4, last week: 23): Fans aren’t happy with ex-Spartan Kirk Cousins. That’s too easy. The whole team’s a mess. USA TODAY Sports 24. Miami Dolphins (2-3, last week: 31): See what happens when you get rid of Joe Philbin? Lamar Miller comes through with a big game and Miami wins -- and they could win again at home vs. Houston next week. USA TODAY Sports 23. San Francisco 49ers (2-4, last week: 26): Colin Kaepernick (340 yards, 2 touchdowns) looked pretty good Sunday. Problem is, it doesn’t take much to look good against Baltimore these days. USA TODAY Sports 22. Tampa Bay Buccaneers (2-3, last week: 22): Bye week. Not much to see here. USA TODAY Sports 21. New Orleans Saints (2-4, last week: 28): That’s two wins in three games now, though handing Atlanta its first loss is by far the most impressive of the two. Can they keep it up in Indianapolis? USA TODAY Sports 20. Dallas Cowboys (2-3, last week: 20): No matter who’s at quarterback, I can’t see America’s Team breaking its 3-game losing streak vs. the Giants. USA TODAY Sports 19. Oakland Raiders (2-3, last week: 19): This Sunday’s duel against the Chargers may be one of those games you should watch that no one’s talking about. USA TODAY Sports 18. Cleveland Browns (2-4, last week: 18): There’s so much mediocrity in this league right now, I can’t even drop the Browns though, to be fair, they came close to upsetting the Broncos. USA TODAY Sports 17. St. Louis Rams (2-3, last week: 17): They could be a winning team after the next two weeks (Browns, 49ers). USA TODAY Sports 16. San Diego Chargers (2-4, last week: 16): For the most part, the Chargers looked solid in Green Bay, but they need to find a way to finish games against teams not named the Lions or Browns. USA TODAY Sports 15. Seattle Seahawks (2-4, last week: 13): I’m starting to think the Seahawks aren’t a great team this year. Now where’s the bandwagon going to go? (Just a joke, guys.) USA TODAY Sports 14. New York Giants (3-3, last week: 12): Now there’s the G-Men we know and love from earlier this season. USA TODAY Sports 13. Philadelphia Eagles (3-3, last week: 16): Sam Bradford (three INTs) needs to take better care of the ball, but DeMarco Murray is showing signs of life. USA TODAY Sports 12. Indianapolis Colts (3-3, last week: 9): Yes, Monday looked bad. Yes, that punt formation was putrid. But there’s not much shame in losing to the Patriots these days. It’s not as gloomy as you think in Indy. USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 11. Buffalo Bills (3-3, last week: 11): This is the state of the NFL right now: I can’t even drop the Bills after losing an ugly one to the Bengals at home and bungling their quarterback situation. In my mind, there are currently 21 teams in the league worse than Buffalo. USA TODAY Sports 10. Minnesota Vikings (3-2, last week: 14): Tough day for AP, but it didn’t matter. The Vikings are now 3-0 at home. USA TODAY Sports 9. Arizona Cardinals (4-2, last week: 7): The running game has to get going; Chris Johnson is not a lead back anymore. And John Brown can’t do everything. USA TODAY Sports 8. New York Jets (4-1, last week: 7): Todd Bowles already has this defense ranking No. 1 in the NFL in yards allowed per game. That’s impressive. USA TODAY Sports 7. Pittsburgh Steelers (4-2, last week: 10): They’re good enough to win despite putting Landry Jones out there. With Big Ben possibly returning this week, the Steelers are poised for a run. USA TODAY Sports 6. Atlanta Falcons (5-1, last week: 5): We’ll consider last Thursday the Falcons’ hiccup. I still think they’re a Top 10 team. USA TODAY Sports 5. Carolina Panthers (5-0, last week: 6): Cam Newton’s doing everything he can to lift the offense, and the defense is pretty stout. Solid win in Seattle on Sunday. USA TODAY Sports 4. Denver Broncos (6-0, last week: 3): Peyton Manning leads the NFL in interceptions, yet his team is 6-0. Big thanks to the defense, but you didn’t see that coming, did you? USA TODAY Sports 3. Cincinnati Bengals (6-0, last week: 4): Could this finally be the year they move past the Wild Card round? USA TODAY Sports 2. New England Patriots (5-0, last week: 2): The Pats could easily be No. 1 right now, the way they’re playing and dominating opponents. USA TODAY Sports 1. Green Bay Packers (6-0, last week: 1): It got interesting against the Chargers, but the Packers got it done. Therefore, they stay No. 1. USA TODAY Sports Like this topic?
