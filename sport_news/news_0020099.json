Their answers illuminate why the sophomore will be a center of attention this winter. \n“He has a motor like no other,” Xavier senior James Farr said. “You could tell by how hard he played, it meant something to him.” \n“If not the most physical, he’s one of the most physical players I’ve had to go up against,” DePaul senior Myke Henry said. \n“He’s big and strong, and he goes after the ball so hard on the glass,” Georgetown sophomore Isaac Copeland said. Position battles raging up front for Seton Hall hoops \nAfter being named Big East Rookie of the Year last season, Delgado begins 2015-16 as a preseason second-team All-Big East selection. With returning averages of 9.3 points and 9.8 rebounds, he might be the league’s best big man. \nThe other player in that conversation, Villanova senior Daniel Ochefu, said Delgado’s overall skill set impressed him. \n“He’s obviously a tenacious rebounder, but his offensive game is something a lot of people don’t talk about,” Ochefu said. “He had a nice little jump shot, a good post-up game, and he probably developed a lot over the summer, so I’m looking forward to playing him.” \nSeton Hall's Angel Delgado (Photo: Seton Hall Athletics) \nDelgado did work on expanding his shot out to 15 feet, but that won’t be the biggest difference for the former Patrick School standout this season. \n“I learned to take care of my body,” he said. “My body was done by the end of last season. I really prepared this year. I gained some weight (he’s listed at 245 pounds, up from 230). Now I feel like I’m ready to face anybody.” \nThe other change? \n“I will take my time with the ball,” he said. “I won’t be in a rush in the post.” \nIf Seton Hall is going to rise above the seventh-place projection of the Big East coaches’ poll, Delgado will have to carry the load inside. He’s surrounded by inexperience and unknowns in the Hall’s frontcourt. \n“I think Angel will be in the running for Player of the Year this year,” said Seton Hall point guard Isaiah Whitehead, a fellow second-team All-Big East preseason selection. “He’s working on his free throws (Delgado shot 41 percent from the line as a freshman). If you think about how many free throws he missed last year and how he’s improved, I think that will shoot his average up to 15, 16 (points). Add in his rebounds, and that’s your Player of the Year.” Jerry Carino's Big East, Big Ten hoops forecast \nProvidence point guard Kris Dunn is the overwhelming favorite for Player of the Year, but league-wide, the frontcourt is close to a blank canvass for the 6-foot-9 Delgado. \n“Winning Big East Rookie of the Year meant a lot to me, but I’m not really focusing on stuff like that,” he said. “I’m focusing on the team, and that’s all I care about. If I score 90 points and we lose, it’s nothing. I’d rather score two points and we get the win.” \nSeton Hall is coming off a 16-15 campaign that nosedived after a strong start. All three Pirates who attended media day — Delgado, Whitehead and sophomore guard Khadeen Carrington — said they were motivated by the poor finish. \n“We learned from last year,” Delgado said. “We’ve got bumps. Nobody’s perfect. But all of us learned how to lose and how to win. This year, guys are going to be prepared. I’m going to be prepared.” \nBig East Preseason Coaches’ Poll \n1.
