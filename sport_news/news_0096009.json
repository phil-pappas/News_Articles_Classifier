Huge scalps like Wolfsburg were not exempt from this treatment with Robert Lewandowski seemingly going for every chance that presented itself. \nArsenal fans may have been a little worried, but that was before their own team started performing convincingly. The Gunners dispatched Manchester United with simply incredible ease, displaying an amazingly fluid and clinical attack, whilst also maintaining an assured defensive solidity. The team looked united in their cause and seemed to stick to Arsene Wenger’s script as required. \nAlmost as if on cue, just in time for back-to-back clashes against the German giants, Mesut Ozil and Alexis Sanchez are in top form. The pair seem hell-bent on ensuring that Arsenal are as clinical as circumstances permit whilst also providing much needed defensive security when needed. \nArsenal’s good fortune seems to have coincided with a fairly rare slump in Bayern’s form as they only managed to score one in their last match. This of course does not ensure that Arsenal will have it easy but with confidence and form so high, one cannot put it past the Gunners to deliver when it counts like they so often do.
