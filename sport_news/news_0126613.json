What do you think? Log in and start commenting \n“I would be happy with that. It has to be his aim but he will be pleased with what he has done so far and happy with the game time he has got and the effect he has had.” \nSako, who joined Wolves in 2012, scored 36 goals in 118 league games before moving to the Premier League with Crystal Palace when his contract expired. \nOjo has been limited to just three starts since his arrival but has scored two goals and impressed in last month’s 3-0 win at Fulham. \n“I think he has made an impact since he has been here,” he said. “The early cup games he played in and then coming off the bench have been big features. Sheyi Ojo of Wolverhampton Wanderers celebrates after scoring a goal to make it 0-2. \n“He has also had starts against good sides, with the first two of those, Cardiff and Brighton, being pretty difficult. I am pleased he is here and can affect games. \n“He is a natural wide-left player with good pace and I just feel he is going to continue to improve over the course of the season. \n“He will want to be in a position where he is starting on a regular basis. He has seen plenty of game time so far and has deserved that.” More on this story:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T10:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T19:37:43.797+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
