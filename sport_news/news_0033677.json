The former Borussia Dortmund manager replaced Brendan Rodgers and has set out his philosophy on how he will go about bringing success back to the former European champions. “Winning is important but so is how you win and how you play the game. I believe in a playing philosophy that is very emotional, very fast and very strong,” Klopp was quoted as saying by the club’s official website after signing the deal on Thursday. “My teams must play at full throttle and take it to the limit every time. It is important to have a playing philosophy that reflects your own mentality, reflects the club and gives you a clear direction to follow. Tactical, of course, but tactical with a big heart,” he said. Klopp thanked the club’s owners for choosing him for the job and said he is looking forward to the season with a talented bunch of players. “I am very excited by the challenge we face and eager to start the job and begin implementing our ideas and ways of working with this team. This is a talented group of players and there is still much to compete for this season,” the 48-year-old said. “I would like to offer thanks to the ownership of Liverpool for showing faith in me and my staff and presenting us with this wonderful opportunity. They have presented to me a very clear vision and I share their ambitions and model of work,” Klopp remarked.
