(Dash Coleman/Savannah Morning News) By Dash Coleman\nKenneth Fox is tired of living in a tent in the woods. It’s mosquito-infested, and he’s worried about getting sick.\nSoon, the Navy veteran and his wife can move from their tent in Savannah into a “tiny house” built by 3rd Infantry Division soldiers.\n“It’s been a long time coming,” Fox said Thursday afternoon at Fort Stewart, where the Army showcased the prototype unit built by soldiers through a partnership with Home Builders Institute and the Chatham-Savannah Authority for the Homeless.\n“This program means a lot for the people that are like me who have somehow managed to slip through the cracks,” Fox said. “We try, but sometimes it just takes one small misstep and you end up in a place that you really didn’t want to be.”\nThere are more than 4,000 people without homes in Chatham County. More than 280 of them are veterans.\n“That’s too many,” said Cindy Kelley, the executive director of the Chatham-Savannah homeless authority. The partnership aims to build 12 of the miniature houses and create a site for homeless veterans in the city.\nEach house will be about 128 square feet with 12-foot roofs. They have windows and, while permanent, can be moved if necessary. In May, Kelley told the newspaper that the houses would be placed in Savannah’s east side at a central location with shower and laundry facilities. The facility should open by next fall, she said.\nAbout 150,000 veterans are unemployed across the country, said retired Gen. George Casey Jr.\n“We can do better than that as a country,” Casey told soldiers and civilians gathered for the showcase. “And the only way we’re going to do better than that as a country is if we continue public-private partnerships.”\nCasey was the commanding general of the Multi-National Force in Iraq from mid-2004 to early 2007, and he retired in 2011 as the Army’s chief of staff. He’s now a member of Home Builders Institute’s board of trustees, and he called programs like the one being pioneered through Fort Stewart and the Chatham-Savannah homeless authority “absolutely vital” in helping military service members transition into civilian life.\nThe 25 soldiers learning to build homes through the program at Fort Stewart are also getting some skills the Army hopes will help them land jobs when they leave the service.\nNine of them already have post-Army employment secured, Casey said.\nStaff Sgt. Dennis Patterson said the experience has inspired him to work his way up the ladder somewhere and become a project manager. Knowing the tiny house he helped build will be a prototype for the rest is a good feeling, he said.\n“A lot of these homeless people become drug addicts or alcoholics, and I wanted to do something where I could help take care of my fellow comrades,” Patterson said.\nSpc. Jesus Carrion has a gig as a carpenter lined up after he leaves the Army in February, but he said the home-building program has given him some new know-how.\nWhen Carrion joined the program, he had no idea he and other soldiers would be starting from scratch.\n“We started form the base up,” Carrion said. “... I have my own little portfolio on my phone.”\nAnd for Air Force veteran Kendall Huskey, programs like the partnership at Fort Stewart represent a change in the way members of the military returning from war and other duties are treated. When he came back from Vietnam in the mid-1970s, the climate couldn’t have been more different.\n“I don’t think anybody ever cared we were back,” Huskey said after touring the prototype home.\nHuskey’s been an advocate for the homeless in Savannah for a while now. For a veteran of the Vietnam War era like him, seeing partnerships like the one showcased Thursday was comparable to the iconic celebrations in New York’s Times Square when the end of World War II was announced.\n“We’re all American,” Huskey said. “We’re all veterans. We’re all humans.”", "external_links": ["http://sav-cdn.com/sites/all/themes/whitelabel/images/blank.gif", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/14831013.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/14831022.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/14831014.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/14831014.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/14831004.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/14831004.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/14831022.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/all/themes/savannahnow/images/blank.gif", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/14831013.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-22T19:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T08:15:06.077+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
