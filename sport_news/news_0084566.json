He scored on a 1-yard run later in the third quarter and on a 43-yard run in the fourth quarter. \nThe win all but clinches the Santa Clara Valley Athletic League De Anza Division championship for Milpitas (6-2, 4-0), which has a bye next week and finishes up with games against Saratoga and Homestead. \nAndrade carried 10 times for 216 yards in the first half and then picked up right where he left off in the second half, finishing with 438 yards rushing and four touchdowns. \nHe broke a 60-yard run on the first play of the game, had touchdown runs of 49 yards and 63 yards and another 45-yard run late in the second quarter. \nHe had to carry a bigger load than normal after Manu Turituri, Wilcox's leading rusher on the season with 709 yards through six games, had to be helped off the field in the second quarter and did not return. \nAndrade's 49-yard touchdown run made the score 14-0 with 6:51 left in the first quarter. \nMilpitas responded when Oliver Svirsky's screen pass to Tariq Bracy on third-and-14 went for a 44-yard touchdown as Bracy flashed terrific speed and open-field running ability. Advertisement \nWilcox went up 21-7 on Andrade's 63-yard touchdown run. Milpitas came right back with Svirsky connecting with Devin Crummie on a 7-yard touchdown pass. \nBut in the second half, Milpitas disdained the pass and went to power football, a strategy that paid dividends. \nAndrade scored on 53- and 13-yard runs in the third quarter, the latter touchdown giving Wilcox its final lead at 34-28. \nIt took Milpitas one play to regain the lead as Dejuan Crummie broke loose on a 62-yard touchdown run. Cesar Silva's extra point gave Milpitas a 35-34 lead. \nThen after the Milpitas defense forced Wilcox to turn the ball over on downs, the Trojans again needed only one play to score as Chavez went 43 yards for a touchdown, his third of the game. \nWilcox 14 7 13 0 -- 34 \nMilpitas 7 6 22 7 -- 42 \nW -- Turituri 7 run (Revoredo kick) \nW -- Andrade 49 run (Revoredo kick) \nM -- Bracy 44 pass from Svirsky (Silva kick) \nW -- Andrade 63 run (Revoredo kick) \nM -- Dev.
