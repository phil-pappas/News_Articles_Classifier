That's how fast and physical he is. He's just got to keep getting in that playbook and keep learning it because I know he's physical. He's got to come in. And if [he does] what he's got to do, he's going to be hard to stop.\"\nWilliams has started to make an impact as a pass rusher during the Tide's last two games.\nSeeing increased playing time as one of Alabama's reserve outside linebackers, the 6-foot-4, 230-pound Williams posted 1.5 tackles for a loss, a half-sack and a quarterback hurry during the Tide's 34-0 win over Louisiana Monroe and a sack in Alabama's 38-10 win over Georgia last Saturday.\nWilliams was one of Alabama's players of the week following the win over ULM.\nRELATED: Redshirt freshman guard has been one of Alabama's 2 most consistent O-linemen, Nick Saban says\nThe sack against Georgia came on the last play of the first half.\nWilliams got past Bulldogs three-year starter at right tackle, Kolton Houston, and sacked quarterback Brice Ramsey after he stepped up in the pocket.\nWilliams had just one tackle with no stops for a loss, sacks or quarterback hurries in the Tide's first three games. He has three tackles, 2.5 stops for a loss, 1.5 sacks and a quarterback hurry in the last two games.\nThe Louisiana native recorded only eight tackles and 1.5 sacks during his first two seasons at Alabama.\n\"Tim has always been a good pass rusher,\" coach Nick Saban said. \"The biggest issue is getting him to play with the kind of discipline to do his job the way he needs to do it, and that's the one thing he's matured into during this year. We have a greater trust in playing him, and he has been more productive. He's been much more consistent as a player, and that's what we look for in all of our players.\"\nWilliams ran the 40-yard dash in 4.75 seconds during Alabama's spring testing.\nHis 545-pound squat was the best among Tide linebackers. His 315-pound power clean was tied for the best. He also bench-pressed 405 pounds. That was tied for sixth-best on the team among non-linemen.\n\"Tim always had that it factor about him,\" outside linebacker Ryan Anderson said, later adding, \"Tim is going to be a great player.\"\nNick Saban Press Conference Videos, Oct. 07, 2015 Nick Saban talks about Arkansas Wednesday at his press conference.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T18:44:25.954+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
