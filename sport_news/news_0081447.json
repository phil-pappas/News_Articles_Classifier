This time, Kansas City Chiefs running back Jamaal Charles saw his season end when he suffered a torn ACL against the Chicago Bears.\nPlenty of fantasy owners spent an early first-round pick on Charles, and those people will be scrambling to the waiver wire to find a suitable replacement.\nHere are the top guys to look at on your fantasy football waiver wire this week.\n1. Willie Snead, wide receiver, New Orleans Saints We mentioned Willie Snead in this column a week ago, and he continued to be a featured piece in the Saints offense, catching six passes for 141 yards. Marques Colston is now dealing with a shoulder injury, so Snead's role should continue to grow.\n2. Gary Barnidge, tight end, Cleveland Browns Browns tight end Gary Barnidge was another one of our recommended adds a week ago, but he's still not owned in enough leagues. That should change after he caught eight passes for 139 yards and a touchdown against the Ravens. Make sure to pick him up.\n3. Charcandrick West, running back, Kansas City Chiefs Charcandrick West stepped in and received seven carries of Charles left the game against the Bears. He will split time with Knile Davis, but he looks like he could be involved enough to make an impact. In fact, Davis had onlytwo carries after Charles got hurt, so West looks like the back to own.\n4. Knile Davis, running back, Kansas City Chiefs Knile Davis has shown flashes of brilliance in his NFL career, but he may have been passed over on the depth chart by West. Davis got only two carries in Charles' absence, but he's worth adding for his upside alone.\n5. Marquess Wilson, wide receiver, Chicago Bears Stepping in for Alshon Jeffery and Eddie Royal, Marquess Wilson caught six passes for 85 yards and a touchdown against the Chiefs. His value is limited when those two return, but he's a talented player worth picking up for the short term.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T02:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T07:33:30.463+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
