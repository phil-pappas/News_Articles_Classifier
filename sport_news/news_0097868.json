Ravens fan disgusted. CONNECT 2 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nThe Baltimore Ravens will be making their first appearance ever to University of Phoenix Monday night to play the Arizona Cardinals. \nNow I know it's easy to look at the Ravens 1-5 record and think, easy win, but remember all five of their losses have been by six points or less. But after you get past that stat, I have to say, yes it looks easy. \nThe Ravens defense has not been the same since Hamilton High School's own Terrell Suggs went down with a season ending injury. The once proud unit is giving up 27 points per game, sixth worst in the NFL. \nAnd nobody in the league has faced more third downs than the Ravens (92) with a 47.8 conversion rate. John Harbaugh who is in his 8th year as Baltimore coach will be hard pressed to continue his streak of being in the playoffs six of his first seven years. \nIn fact, ESPN's Football Power Index gives the Ravens a better chance of finishing with the number one draft pick (3.6%) then they do of making the playoffs (2.2%) \nAs for the offense, Joe Flacco has the 27th highest passer rating (80.1) in the league. And he has thrown seven interceptions in six games. \nThink the Cardinal secondary isn't licking their lips? \nAnd what do the Ravens surround Flacco with on offense? Steve Smith Sr., a 36 year-old receiver who has four microfractures in his back, Justin Forsett a running back who has never gone over 700 yards in a season, and Marlon Brown, an undrafted free agent who has gone 20 straight games without a TD catch. OUCH! \nThis is the second of three straight games for the Cardinals versus the AFC North. They'll travel to the Dawg Pound on November 1 to tackle the Cleveland Browns. After this game with the Ravens and the Nov. 22 game versus the Begals, it will leave only the Jags, the Titans and the Jets as the only teams not to play at University of Phoenix Stadium. \nThe Patriots haven't played the Cardinals there yet, but, they have played a couple of memorable games in Glendale over the years.
