That certainly wasn't the case for Navy football with regard to right tackle. \nJunior Blake Copeland initially beat out sophomore Robert Lindsey in a spirited battle that went back-and-forth throughout August camp. Copeland started the season opener against Colgate, but did not perform to the satisfaction of tackles coach Chris Culton. \nLindsey took over as the starter for the second contest against East Carolina and held the job for the next three games. Lindsey got nicked up against Air Force and also did not grade out highly in that service academy showdown so Culton went back to Copeland for the Notre Dame game. \nCopeland suffered a foot injury versus the Fighting Irish and is currently in a walking boot. Instead of going back to Lindsey, who finished the Notre Dame game, Culton has elected to start senior Brandon Greene. \n\"I always say that we're going to play the best five and I don't care who it is, whether it's sophomore, junior or senior,\" Culton said this week. \"Right now, Brandon Greene gives us the best chance to win.\" Navy Sports Chat: Tulane game preview \nSportswriter Dave Broughton and Navy beat writer Bill Wagner recap Navy football's loss to Notre Dame and preview this weekend's homecoming game against Tulane. \nSportswriter Dave Broughton and Navy beat writer Bill Wagner recap Navy football's loss to Notre Dame and preview this weekend's homecoming game against Tulane.

Ryder regained the starting job versus East Carolina, but Greene remained at center and shared the game repetitions while his classmate worked into game condition. \nWhen the coaching staff determined that Ryder was capable of going a full game, Greene was moved to right tackle – the position at which he started as a sophomore. \n\"I knew eventually I was going to make the switch back to tackle once we knew Blaze was fully healthy. So I really wasn't worried about how much time I was getting at center,\" Greene said. Last Green Wave visit to Annapolis came after Hurricane Katrina (Bill Wagner) \n\"I knew I'd come back at tackle and have a chance to prove myself. \nGreene was thrust into the starting lineup in 2013 after senior Graham Vickers suffered a season-ending injury. The 6-foot-3, 265-pound California native started seven straight games before losing the right tackle job to Joey Gaston. \n\"Joey and I were neck-and-neck as sophomores. I knew if I slipped up Joey would get a chance to come in. He did and played really well so I couldn't really be mad. It was through my own faults,\" Greene said. \"I just kept my head down and kept working. I knew the next time my turn came around I would be better.\" \nCulton felt bad about demoting Greene prior to a road game at San Jose State because the youngster was really looking forward to playing in front of family and friends from his hometown of Highlands. \nGaston grabbed hold of the right tackle job and never let go, starting all 13 games in 2014. Meanwhile, Greene played in just six games last season as the backup to Gaston and left tackle Bradyn Heap. \n\"I'm excited for Brandon. He's come a long way. He went from being a starter to a backup and never complained,\" Culton said. \"I think when Brandon looks back he'll remember that he was unselfish and toughed it out. A lot of people would have gotten frustrated, but he didn't.\" \nCulton said he has no idea how long the foot injury will sideline Copeland, whom the coach felt had improved during the season and was \"doing some good things.\" Navy now fields an all-senior offensive line with the addition of Greene, who has 21 career games under his belt. \n\"Brandon has a lot of experience, has played quite a bit. Also, Robert did not do as well in the Air Force and Notre Dame games as I hoped,\" Culton said when asked why he went with Greene over Lindsey. \"I think Robert still has a chance to be a very good player, but right now when you pop on the tape you can see there are flaws and mistakes. The one thing Robert does really well is he comes off the football. We just have to fine-tune the rest of his game.\" \nAll the shuffling at right tackle shows how competitive some positions have become at Navy and backs up the coaching staff's promise to put the best players on the field. \n\"We're a results-based operation. You're graded on everything – from when you're underneath the chute in practice to classroom material to game reps,\" Culton said. \"We care about all these kids outside the football arena, but when we're inside here it's binary. Are you getting the job done or not? And the players can see it. They see it on film and on the grade sheet.\" \nGreene has been practicing at right tackle for the last two weeks and called it an easy transition since he was already so familiar with the position. He did not deny a sense of accomplishment over regaining the starting job almost two years after losing it. \n\"It feels good. I'm ready to go out there this Saturday and solidify a spot,\" he said. \nWhile Greene will start, Culton said Lindsey and freshman Andrew Wood will definitely see action on Saturday against Tulane.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T02:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T20:24:49.410+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
