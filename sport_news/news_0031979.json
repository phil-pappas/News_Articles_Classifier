The third quarter scores came on runs of 24 and 16 yards after pounding away for a lead that would result in a 28-14 win . \nT.J. O'TOOL, Fort Dodge St. Edmond: The top returning rusher in Class 1A produced one of his finest performances in an upset of then-No. 2 Madrid. Offensively, the senior back took 34 carries for 160 yards and two touchdowns. His defensive contribution may have been even more important in the 31-26 win, as he totaled 12.5 tackles, a sack and a fumble recovery. \nKOLTEN WILWERDING, Glenwood: The only unbeaten team in 3A-8 is led by a quarterback that has 20 touchdown passes and just two interceptions this season. Wilwerding threw six scores in Friday's 42-0 win over Denison-Schleswig, a class-best through six weeks. The junior was 15-of-22 passing for 174 yards and did not toss an interception. \nNATHAN McADOO, South Tama: As the Trojans posted their fifth straight shutout in a 49-0 win over Roland-Story, McAdoo led the way with 12 tackles and a sack. The senior linebacker recorded just one total tackle in South Tama's first two wins this season, but has come on strong as the scoreless streak rolls on. \nKO KIEFT, Sioux Center: Last year's Class 2A runner-ups came up just short against unbeaten Spirit Lake on Friday, but it wasn't for Kieft's lack of trying. The senior threw for 346 yards and rushed for 37 more, scoring five touchdowns along the way. On defense, Kieft recorded seven tackles and a sack in an exciting 41-38 game. He finished 22-of-48 passing with one interception.
