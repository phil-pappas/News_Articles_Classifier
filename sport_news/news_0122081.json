We could really feel the pressure hanging on us.” \nThe Tigers entered the meet 24-0 on the dual meet and as overwhelming favorites. The final score wasn’t especially close; Northwestern totaled 36 points to runner-up Wilson’s 74 and Saucon Valley’s 84. \nAnd yet Northwestern, which was led by sophomore Molly Tarvin (second, 20 minutes and 13 seconds) and freshman Madeline Consuelos (third, 20:18) was worried. \n“We have to pay attention to every little thing that we have to do and we don’t take anything for granted or overlook anyone,” said Smith, who finished fourth on the Tiger ladder and ninth overall at 21:22. “Winning this meet is what we have been working for all season. We have a great tradition and we want to carry it on.” \nOf course it may be precisely that kind of attention to detail and dedication to excellence that keeps Northwestern on top. \n“Every year we have older girls on the team who have won before and then pass that on to the younger girls,” Smith said. “They want us to keep the winning attitude and to keep working hard. We don’t know any other way but to race all together (their spread between 1 and 5 Wednesday was 1:19) and it’s a good way to help the younger runners along.” \nAnd it’s a proven winning formula – even if all the winning comes with a pressure of its own. \nBrad Wilson may be reached at bwilson@lehighvalleylive.com .
