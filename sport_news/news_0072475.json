He’s inviting all stakeholders to bring forward ideas to solve this.\n“What the answer is? I’m not sure at this point, but I do know that this is something we need to sit down collectively and look at.”\nRelated Stories Record number of calls to North Shore Rescue this year North Vancouver mayor challenges others to join the Great Canadian Shoreline Cleanup", "external_links": ["http://www.northshorerescue.com/"], "published": "2015-10-04T22:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T19:26:37.057+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
