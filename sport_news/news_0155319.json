We are told that studies prove that they are not a safety hazard. Only studies done by the Outdoor Advertising Association say that. Independent studies say otherwise.\nWe are told that these signs are only permitted in commercial areas, yet I submit that these spaces should be beautiful too.\nFinally, we are told that businesses need these signs to increase the number of customers who frequent their establishments. However, it has been proven that the more attractive commercial areas are, the longer people linger and the more they spend. Beauty is good for business!\nLast year I wanted to buy something at Auto Zone on DeRenne. I knew I had seen their sign. Yet when I tried to find it, I couldn’t find it in the plethora of signs on that stretch of the road, so I came home without patronizing that store.\nThe proposed new law to let digital on-premise signs change four times a day would be another bit of visual blight leading us down the slippery slope of diminishing Savannah’s beauty. I hope council is wise enough to just say no.\nARDIS WOODS\nSavannah\nMedia-fog may have left a lingering cloud over Tybee\nOn Sept. 13, the Savannah Morning News reported that the Tybee City Council had empowered a study group to look into banning alcohol on the beach (“ Tybee targets beach booze ”).\nDoesn’t Tybee, Chatham County, the state of Georgia and the federal government have law books full of laws that address the abuse of alcohol, other legal/illegal substances and littering?\nUnless I am mistaken, the existing laws on the books are to protect the safety of the law-abiding citizens from those citizens that do not abide by the laws. A trip to the beach is a chance to relax from the daily stresses of life and a beer on the beach while breathing in the warm salty air, which has been a rite of passage on Tybee for generations. It still works whether you’re a day-tripper, renting a vacation house for a week or a part-time or full-time resident.\nCreating new layers of laws, rules or regulations that will restrict the beach experience for all citizens, guests and visitors to address the disregard of the laws and rules by a minority of citizens is not the answer.\nI would suggest instead of offering up new layers of laws and rules that limit the quiet enjoyment of Tybee’s beaches by law-abiding citizens, the City Council should empower a panel to study whether the media-fog of political-correctness may have left a lingering cloud over Tybee, obscuring the vision of the uniform enforcement of existing laws, rules and regulations.\nTOMMY THOMPSON\nTybee Island\nStop fear-mongering about Syrian refugees\nIn response to your editorial about Syrian refugees, I feel that you’ve greatly oversimplified the matter (“ Syrian refugee response: Reckless endangerment ,” Sept. 23).\nSo ISIS is going to send operatives here disguised as refugees? First of all, these refugees will all be carefully screened and are not going to be allowed into this country for quite some time. How about all the operatives that ISIS has converted here in this country through the use of the Internet? I’m sure that they could do damage here more quickly than having to wait a year for them to try and sneak a couple of people through a highly intensive screening process.\nYes, the U.S. is a very giving country. Please don’t insult our intelligence that it is always from altruistic motives. Have you ever read any in-depth historical analysis of our investments in South and Central America over the years from the government and multi-national companies often in conjunction with one another?\nFor example, how about Sam Zemurray and United Fruit in Honduras where they had the government overthrown so they could monopolize the banana business. Or the infamous CIA overthrow of the Guatemalan government in 1953 spurred largely from business considerations. And of course, the Middle East is in turmoil because of President Barack Obama when the whole region was destabilized by the invasion of Iraq, but not even going to blame former President George Bush because the Middle East always seems to be in turmoil.\nSo if you can suggest how to change that, I’ll be glad to listen to your in-depth solution.\nAs for Saudi Arabia and Qatar and other countries like that, I’ll be expecting anything out of them — well don’t hold your breath. If you visited Iran, you would think it was a far more progressive country than those others.\nLastly, comparing the Mariel Boat situation to the Syrian refugee situation might have been worth examining if you hadn’t misrepresented the Mariel Boat situation. You said many of the refugees from Cuba were criminal and mentally unstable. There were 125,000 refugees and a few thousand were determined to be in this category — although many of the people designated as Fidel Castro as being criminal were of a political nature or gay.\nThe fact that many of the refugees were black elicited a racist response from some elements in the U.S. Anybody who thinks the drug situation in south Florida was greatly affected by the Mariel Boat Lift has not read about Miami and the Key West in the ’70s.\n“Scarface” was a great historical reference to back up those allegations. I’ll Quote: the Palm Beach Post from people who dealt with the problem first hand, “Mariel was very bad in the beginning, but good in the end. The vast majority were honest, decent, industrious people.”\nLike most immigrants and most refugees, this fear-mongering that somehow we are being infiltrated by outsiders who are up to no good when most of the violence in this country is home grown so that the allocation of resources is misguided, is a huge problem in this country.\nThrough sensible means, we can remain secure and deal with the problems that can truly threaten our security long term.\nKEITH REILLY\nSavannah", "external_links": ["http://sav-cdn.com/sites/all/themes/savannahnow/images/blank.gif"], "published": "2015-10-01T20:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T01:58:32.405+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
