While the ride was a New Zealand record, it wasn't officially recognised as a world best record. \nWith UCI officials in Invercargill for the Oceania Track Cycling Championships, Grandiek made an official attempt on Thursday. \nGrandiek said the support of a small, but vocal home crowd helped him. \n\"It was tough. An hour is a long time,\" he said. \n\"The home support helped. I could hear them and it just made me think that I have to do it. Everything feels good, although the legs feel a bit tired.\" \nGrandiek wasn't sure if he had broken the record until the last five minutes. \n\"I didn't realise until the last minutes, when I had ridden 100 laps,\" he said. \n\"I thought I still had to do 13 more laps to break it and that is hard, and then I put my head down and I then looked up and realised I had done 115 laps and broken it.\" \nGrandiek hopes to continue riding now that he has achieved the record. \n\"I will ride in the Southland champs, and then if selected I will ride in the New Zealand age-group champs in the 85 plus age-group,\" he said. \nThe Invercargill cyclist has quiet plans to celebrate his achievement. \n\"I think I will have something to eat and go to sleep,\" he said. \n\"I will see what the family wants to do, but I won't go up town or anything like that. I might come down and watch the Oceania champs tonight.\" \nThe Oceania Track Cycling Championships run from October 8 to 11 at the SIT Velodrome in Invercargill. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T06:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T06:58:55.300+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
