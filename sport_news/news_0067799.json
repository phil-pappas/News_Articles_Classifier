Heyward's father, Craig Heyward, went by \"Ironhead\" during a standout career at Pitt and then another 11 years in the NFL as a running back for four teams. The elder Heyward died after a long fight with cancer in 2006. \nThe NFL hit with Cam Heyward with $5,787 fine for displaying a personal message. Heyward said he'll continue to pay the fine, adding he doesn't \"want to ruffle any feathers, but this is bigger than all we play for. There are people fighting for (their) lives.\" \nAP NFL website: http://www.pro32.ap.org and http://www.twitter.com/AP_NFL \nAll content copyright ©2015 Pendleton Times-Post, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T01:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T02:44:31.008+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
