Rebecca Blackwell Associated Press People make final preparations for the arrival of Hurricane Patricia in the Pacific resort city Puerto Vallarta, Mexico on Friday. Cesar Rodriguez Associated Press 1 of 9 \nBy Deborah Bonello, Alexandra Zavis and Matt Pearce \nLos Angeles Times MEXICO CITY \nThe Western Hemisphere’s most powerful hurricane on record roared into Mexico on Friday, knocking down trees and light posts, closing schools and airports, and sending people fleeing the popular resorts and small fishing villages that dot the country’s central Pacific coastline. \nThere were reports of flooding and landslides as Hurricane Patricia swept into Jalisco state early in the evening, bringing lashing rain, crashing waves and winds as strong as a tornado. But there was no immediate information on possible casualties or severe damages. Air transport was being readied to perform search and rescue operations Saturday, authorities said \nThe center of the extremely dangerous Category 5 storm made landfall in a relatively sparsely populated area about 55 miles northeast of the nearest major city, Manzanillo, and was expected to dissipate as it moved inland over a mountainous region with isolated hamlets. \nBy late Friday, Patricia had been downgraded to a Category 4 storm, but hurricane warnings remained in effect along the western coast, said Dennis Feltgen, spokesman for the U.S. National Hurricane Center.  ; \n“It'll take some time for the winds to spin down,” he said. “Don’t get fooled. Right now this is a very dangerous hurricane. It’s not gone. It’s just inland.” \nOn Twitter, Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto said the nation had never seen a hurricane this strong. \n“Do not go outside. Protect yourselves and follow instructions from the Civil Protection. I am thinking of you all,” he said. \nThe storm had grown at “an incredible rate” over a 12-hour span from Thursday night to early Friday, according to the United Nations’ World Meteorological Organization. By Friday morning, Patricia’s power was comparable to Typhoon Haiyan, which displaced millions of people and left more than 7,300 dead or missing in the Philippines in 2013. \nRecord-beating wind speeds of more than 200 mph had weakened slightly when the storm hit land at about 6:15 p.m. But the National Hurricane Center in Miami said the storm was still carrying sustained winds of 165 mph and was considered dangerous. \nEverything in the street, such as cars, are going to turn into projectiles, so it’s very important that people seek shelter. \nRicardo de la Cruz, director of civilian protection \nTens of thousands of people up and down the coast were evacuated into shelters and out of the danger zone. Some left on government-provided flights and ground transportation, while others piled into cars and local buses. \n“Everything in the street, such as cars, are going to turn into projectiles, so it’s very important that people seek shelter,” said Ricardo de la Cruz, director of civilian protection. \nResidents stocked up on food and boarded up buildings in preparation for the storm. &mdash; Scott Kelly (@StationCDRKelly) October 23, 2015 \nAlma Aguirre, who works at the Viatore pizza restaurant in Puerto Vallarta, said she had turned off everything in the kitchen, disconnected gas and electricity, and placed sandbags in the doorways to stop water from getting in. \n“All that leaves is for us to pray to God that it’s not going to be too strong,” Aguirre said by phone. “People here are very frightened, and they say the hurricane is going to hit very hard.” \nStates of emergency were declared in Colima, Nayarit and Jalisco states, which include the tourist resorts of Puerto Vallarta, which appeared to have been largely spared the worst of the storm, and Manzanillo. \nAbout 3,000 soldiers and more than 800 federal police officers were dispatched to the area. More than 1,200 shelters were set up, able to accommodate 240,000 people. Schools were closed, and three airports shut down: in Puerto Vallarta, Manzanillo and Tepic. \nAs the storm approached, television video showed federal police pickup trucks driving through the streets of Puerto Vallarta with sirens blaring. Beaches that are usually teeming with local and international tourists appeared deserted. \nWhen Jesus Anguino Salazar arrived Thursday at a hotel in Puerto Vallarta, employees told him that he wasn’t a guest but a refugee. So he headed to a bus station Friday to make his way back to the city of Guadalajara, about 125 miles east of Puerto Vallarta. \n“I got a bus ticket but everything was full, and I had to wait in a really long line, “ he told a Mexican newspaper. When he finally got onto a bus, he said, all the passengers could talk about was the storm and what it might do to their homes. \nMartin Tapia, head of civil protection in Nayarit, said most electricity service had been suspended as a precaution and warned residents that they could expect to be without power for at least 24 hours. \nTourism Secretary Enrique de la Madrid told Milenio TV from Nayarit that about half of the 15,000 tourists there would have been evacuated to Guadalajara by the time the storm hit. About 10,000 others were evacuated from the coast of Jalisco. \nHeidi Jones-DiSaia, who works for a telecommunications company in Pittsburgh, spent her Friday holed up in ballroom of the Four Seasons Punta Mita with several hundred other guests. \n“They played movies on a projector, some played cards & read books,” Jones-DiSaia via Facebook. “Four Seasons has been wonderful – providing food & drinks & periodic updates.” \nThe thing that touched her, Jones-DiSaia said, was that “everyone who was here was a ‘volunteer' who chose to spend their day with us instead of being with their families.” \nPresident Barack Obama wrote on Twitter: “Our thoughts are with the Mexican people as they brace for Hurricane Patricia. USAID disaster experts are on the ground and ready to help.” \nTens of thousands of Americans are believed to be living or vacationing in areas likely to be affected by the storm, State Department spokesman Mark Toner said. \nHe said U.S. officials were coordinating closely with Mexican officials and advising U.S. citizens to follow guidance from the local authorities. \nBri Kromm, a registered nurse from Olympia, Wash., first heard that a storm might hit on Thursday. On Friday morning, staff at the Grand Mayan Nuevo Vallarta hotel told guests that the situation had gotten much worse and that everyone would have to take cover. \nOur thoughts are with the Mexican people as they brace for Hurricane Patricia. USAID disaster experts are on the ground and ready to help. \nPresident Barack Obama \nWhen the storm hit, Kromm was sheltering in the hotel parking garage with hundreds of other guests. It wasn’t ideal, she said, but the staff had moved all the pool chairs into the garage and handed out blankets and pillows. \n“We are incredibly lucky,” Kromm said in an exchange over Facebook. “We have nice bathrooms here and running water … Everyone is in good spirits given the circumstances.” \nLee Gonzales, an American missionary, said he was hunkering down with family and friends on the second floor of his nonprofit organization in Manzanillo called Hope Fan. \nEarly in the afternoon, residents hurried through the streets to pick up food and water from suppliers who were quickly running out, said Gonzales, a Texas native reached by phone. A few hours later, with the rain slashing down and waves pounding the beaches, hardly anyone was outside except for the occasional passing police truck or Red Cross vehicle. \n“Pretty much the streets are empty now,” Gonzales said. \nDavid Wilkins, a sound and lighting production professional on vacation in Puerto Vallarta from Sunriver, Ore., tried to make it out of the city before the storm hit but couldn’t get onto the last flight. So he was evacuated with his wife to a college in the hills of the city \n“They fed us!” Wilkins said in an interview via Facebook. “Class rooms were clean.. desk style chairs around … there were about 25 to 30 (people) in each room. Water … blankets … ham sandwiches. ..we were well cared for by the support teams.” \nOverall, Wilkins wrote, the mood was “calm,” with “lots of kids playing games with some of the staff … and grouchy old people.” \nThe couple planned to try again to leave Saturday. But every visitor was trying to skip town. Wilkins said he was sharing a room with a couple who planned to go ahead with their wedding ceremony at the hotel on Saturday. \n“Patricia can’t stop love!” Wilkins wrote.
