After an 0-7 start, the Columbus Blue Jackets fired coach Todd Richards and replaced him with Tortorella on Oct. 21, 2015. Photograph by: DARRYL DYCK , AP \nVANCOUVER — It was We Day at Rogers Arena, forcing the Vancouver Canucks to practise at UBC, where it quickly became He Day. \nHe was John Tortorella, suddenly back in the news after being hired in Columbus to try to stop the bleeding of the 0-7 Blue Jackets. \nHard to believe on several fronts, but a distinctly lucky break for his former employers. \nAfter all, Tortorella’s last National Hockey League job was supposed to be … well, his last NHL job, at least for a few years, long enough for the odour of his abysmal season in Vancouver to be absorbed into an otherwise respectable resume, allowing him to re-enter the league’s Coach Recycling Rotation at the lower end. \nBut desperation makes strange bedfellows, and the Blue Jackets panicked, and the Canucks — taking advantage of a compensation rule that many in the NHL are clamouring to be changed — will receive a second-round draft pick in addition to off-loading roughly three of the six million they still would have owed Tortorella if he had remained unemployed. \nThat’s a big day in the lives of GM Jim Benning, who has made his bones as a shrewd drafter of kids, though it will be Columbus’s choice which year they will surrender the draft pick: 2016, ’17 or ’18. \nIt’s an even bigger day for Canucks’ president of hockey ops Trevor Linden, who was hired the day after the man who signed Tortorella, Mike Gillis, was fired. \nSo Linden didn’t have to eat any of the blame for an egregious error in judgment, and he comes out of it smelling of roses. Until Columbus fired Todd Richards after the Jackets staggered out of the gate, the Canucks were looking at eating a total of $8 million to be rid of the coach. \nInstead, 17 months after Linden tied the can to him, Tortorella — the walking, talking incendiary device who guided the Canucks and the Sedin twins to a precipitous fall-off, set in motion the departure of Roberto Luongo by benching him for the Heritage Classic and was suspended 15 days for charging at the Calgary Flames’ dressing room hoping to get his hands around the throat of coach Bob Hartley — is working in the world’s best hockey league again. \nBenning and Linden declined a request to be interviewed for this column, saying it was Columbus’s day and they didn’t want to steal the Jackets’ thunder. \nFor their part, the Canucks players took the high road on their former coach. \n“Obviously, it wasn’t a great year for anybody,” said Alex Burrows, whose contract Tortorella had lobbied management to buy out. \n“Looking back now, I don’t know if we had a total buy-in to what he was preaching. And on his side, he was so emotionally attached to the Rangers for so long, I don’t know if he was that much committed to our group at the start. \n“At Columbus, I think he’s going to be really good. He’s had time to reflect on his past with Tampa, the Rangers, us ... \n“People like to make fun of some of his rants on TV, but he’s a really smart man. I’m sure he did think about things and look in the mirror and say: ‘How can I improve this, how can I do better at that?’” \nHenrik Sedin, who like his brother Daniel wore down as the Canucks’ 2013-14 season did the same, acknowledged that Tortorella overplayed his stars. \n“Yeah, he did. But he came into a new team and didn’t really know what he had,” said the captain. “I think he wanted to trust us and see where we could take it. If he gets time with a team, he will be successful.” \nThe Canucks were mocked for the paltry return they got for goalie Eddie Lack (a third-rounder from Carolina) and Kevin Bieksa (a second-rounder from Anaheim) this summer. \nSo the pick from Columbus looks like something for nothing, but in reality, it cost them the $2 million they paid Tortorella not to coach last year, plus whatever portion of his Columbus contract they are picking up, speculated to be $1 million a year for three years. \nPlenty of hockey people think it’s ridiculous a team can fire a coach and still retain compensation rights to him, when it is already getting off the hook for what remains of his contract. \nCompensation was intended for teams that have to replace coaches or managers who are hired away by another team. Fired is fired. This man had already been replaced. \nIn a teleconfer", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T05:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T14:58:12.156+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
