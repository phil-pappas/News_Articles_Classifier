After Northern Iowa (2-3, 0-2 Missouri Valley) missed a 38-yard field-goal attempt, Wentz led a 10-play, 79-yard drive capped by Shepherd’s twisting catch while blanketed by two defenders in the corner of the end zone. Wentz threw 33 yards to Shepherd with 7:49 left to lead 24-21 but on the first play after the ensuing kickoff Northern Iowa’s Aaron Bailey broke loose for an 83-yard scoring run. Wentz finished 26 of 40 for 335 yards and four scores but also threw his first two interceptions this season. Wentz had 143 attempts without a pick until then. Bailey ran for 157 yards and Daurice Fountain had 110 yards receiving for the Panthers. The Bison (4-1, 2-0) have won four straight. \nSouthern Illinois 73, Missouri State 26 \nCARBONDALE, ILL. \nMark Iannotti passed for three touchdowns and rushed for one as Southern Illinois raced to a one-sided win. Southern Illinois (2-3, 1-1 Missouri Valley) rushed for 416 yards — the most since recording 435 in 2009 — and finished with 673 total yards, the second time they’ve totaled at least 600 this season. Ianotti’s 61-yard touchdown run on the second play of the game set the tone for things to come, as the Salukis tallied 38 points by halftime, including all four of Iannoti’s touchdowns. He was 13 of 20 for 206 yards and had 106 yards on six carries. Chris Perkins added 116 yards and two touchdowns on six carries. Jason Randall scored on runs of 4 and 2 yards for Missouri State (1-4, 0-2), and Malik Earl caught a 2-yard touchdown pass from Brodie Lambert in the second quarter. Lambert totaled 106 yards on four receptions. \nSouth Dakota State 24, Indiana State 7 \nBROOKINGS, S.D. \nTaryn Christion threw for one touchdown and ran for another as South Dakota State beat Indiana State. Christion was 15 of 24 for 221 yards passing for the Jackrabbits (4-1, 1-1 Missouri Valley Conference). He was also the team’s leading rusher with 99 yards on 16 carries. Kyle Paris ran for another 49 yards and a score. Christion scored on a ‘10-yard run early in the second quarter and connected with Jake Wieneke for a 34-yard touchdown pass to close the first half and the Jackrabbits led 14-0. Indiana State scored late in the third quarter to shrink the gap to 14-7. But a Jay Carlson field goal and a 1-yard TD run by Paris early in the fourth quarter sealed the win for South Dakota State. Matt Adam threw for 198 yards and a touchdown for the Sycamores (3-2, 1-1). \nAssociated Press", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T07:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T09:46:17.277+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
