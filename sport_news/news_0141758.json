Offensive coordinator Adam Gase went the other direction knowing the Raiders pass defense had been susceptible to tight ends and backs, allowing 305 yards and five touchdowns to tight ends in the first three games and 24 receptions for 120 yards to running backs.\nThat left Leno on his own for the majority of the game. On 48 pass plays, Leno got chip help only four times. He solo blocked Aldon Smith 29 times, allowing one sack and one pressure. Cutler consistently got the ball out quickly and that kept a pass rush that also included Khalil Mack and Justin Tuck at bay.\nThe Bears chipped to help on the right side eight times. Leno wasn't as effective run blocking, and it looked like Gase went away from pulling the guards in the running game after left guard Matt Slauson shifted inside to center. The Raiders hit Cutler only four times and the trend against Oakland continued as tight end Martellus Bennett (11 catches, 83 yards, touchdown) and running back Matt Forte (four catches, 64 yards) combined for more than half of Cutler's 281 passing yards.\nRight guard Vladimir Ducasse was called for two penalties giving him seven, tied for the most in the NFL and more than any other offensive player.\nOffensive line grade: 6\nQuarterback\nGrade: 7\nReturning from a hamstring injury after missing one game, Cutler was effective climbing the pocket at times as well as sliding to create time and find passing lanes. He was effective with throws into tight windows on the game-winning drive and had only one really bad play, when he threw off his back foot across the field to Bennett for a Charles Woodson interception.\nRunning backs\nGrade: 5\nForte gained what was blocked in the running game. He lost a fumble and missed a block on Mack as Cutler was pressured on the interception. But he produced 155 yards of offense.\nWide receivers\nGrade: 7\nPlaying without Alshon Jeffery again, this group stepped up. Marquess Wilson overcame a drop to turn in some nice catches, none finer than the high grab when he was tightly covered by David Amerson on the boundary to get in range for the game-winning field goal. Wilson also made some nice blocks downfield. Josh Bellamy dropped what would have been a nice touchdown catch and Eddie Royal had a terrific grab of a low throw in the closing minutes. Royal also displayed his shiftiness working the middle of the field.\nTight ends\nGrade: 6\nBennett produced in the passing game — his fourth-down catch with Ray-Ray Armstrong all over him was a game-saver — but consistently missed blocks on running plays. Zach Miller had some nice blocks but got caught holding Smith near the goal line. Khari Lee had a holding penalty and struggled run blocking.\nDefensive line\nGrade: 6\nRookie nose tackle Eddie Goldman had his best game of the season, consistently pushing up the middle against the run in 36 snaps. Jarvis Jenkins added his third sack of the season and the Raiders averaged only 3.2 yards per run.\nLinebackers\nGrade: 6\nPernell McPhee intercepted Derek Carr when the ball bounced off running back Latavius Murray, but his best play came with the game on the line when he whipped tight end Clive Walford to stop Roy Helu in the backfield for a 1-yard loss on third-and-2. Willie Young had two nice pass rushes in the first half. Christian Jones was out of control when Helu cut back for a touchdown on a 4-yard swing pass.\nCornerbacks\nGrade: 9\nCarr was 1-for-6 throwing to Amari Cooper with Tracy Porter in coverage as the cornerback followed him from side to side. Cooper caught a 26-yard touchdown from the slot against nickel back Sherrick McManis and caught two quick throws at the line of scrimmage. Otherwise, the only damage he did was on a 16-yard slant. Kyle Fuller made a physical hit on tight end Mychal Rivera to prevent what would have been first-and-goal and force a field goal. Alan Ball was in uniform but did not play.\nSafeties\nGrade: 4\nThe Raiders didn't challenge the deep middle often and Adrian Amos was solid in run support.\nSpecial teams\nGrade: 7\nRobbie Gould's game-winning field goal lifted a unit that had been under scrutiny. Popped-up kickoffs helped the coverage unit. A low kick led to a blocked extra point.\nbmbiggs@tribpub.com\nTwitter @BradBiggs\n Jay Cutler Oakland Raiders Chicago Bears Martellus Bennett Adam Gase Aldon Smith Matt Forte", "external_links": ["http://www.tribpub.com/privacy-policy-and-your-privacy-rights/", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-5612f2c3/turbine/ct-biggs-film-session-spt-1006-20151005"], "published": "2015-10-06T00:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T01:59:45.124+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
