The duo battled back and forth before Gill pulled away the last half mile of the race.\nGill, who only started running cross country this season, clocked 18:30.34 and won by more than 32 seconds over Cruz despite taking a wrong turn at the tail end of the race. She was on pace for a 17:30 finish. She was fourth in the 1,600 meters in track last year and fourth in the 3,200 meters.\n\"Alexa was right beside me. She was pushing me,\" said Gill, whose father, Davidson Gill won back-to-back state titles in the 800-meters in 1992 and 1993 and trains her. \"I'm glad I started it because I didn't know I was this good. After the first race, I wanted to get better at it and hopefully win states.\"\nAt the very least she wants to at least equal Lisa Brown's (Dillard) second place state finish in 1986 when the distance was 2-miles.\nCruz, a senior, who has committed to the University of Alabama, was second at 19:02.63. St. Thomas senior Lily Kloepfer (19:45.40), Douglas junior Halie Murphy (20:51.20) and Boyd Anderson freshman Daishon Spann (20:56.20) rounded out the top five.\nLatest Cross Country Results (Oct. 15) Both Broward and Palm Beach held its County Championships on Thursday.\nBCAA Championships\nBoys team scoresSt. Thomas Aquinas 18, Cypress Bay 94, Coral Glades 192, West Broward 221, Dillard 230, Boyd Anderson 235, Douglas 251, Cooper City 284, Cardinal Gibbons 284, Flanagan 335, Everglades 363,...\nBoth Broward and Palm Beach held its County Championships on Thursday.\nBCAA Championships\nBoys team scoresSt. Thomas Aquinas 18, Cypress Bay 94, Coral Glades 192, West Broward 221, Dillard 230, Boyd Anderson 235, Douglas 251, Cooper City 284, Cardinal Gibbons 284, Flanagan 335, Everglades 363,...\nRead the story \"I wanted to win, but it didn't turn out the way I planned,\" said Cruz, who finished third in the Class 4A state meet last year after winning in 2013. She was second in the state meet as a freshman. \"That is how cross country is and I am just going to use this as motivation for the next one. I can't feel bad for myself because then you won't make progress.\"\nThe Raiders girls placed four runners in the top 11 to finish with 46 points, while Cardinal Gibbons and Douglas took second and third with 79 and 88 points respectively. It was the sixth straight BCAA title for the Raiders.\nSt. Thomas boys swept the top four places and took five of the top eight spots as it placed all seven of its runners in the top 16 to finish with 18 points. Runner-up Cypress Bay was a distant second with 94 points. St. Thomas' boys have won 10 consecutive BCAA titles.\nSt. Thomas Aquinas junior Sean Breslin eliminated sugar and bread from his diet, and focused on his race strategy and it paid huge dividends. He trimmed two seconds off his personal best time of 16:29 from last year and won his first major meet. His 16:27.83 clocking was nearly three seconds faster than sophomore teammate Nick Rischar (16:30.58) who placed second.\n\"I performed pretty poorly in the past two races,\" Breslin said. \"I had some heath problems and fell apart the last mile of my last two races. I was pretty worried coming into this one that it might happen again, but I am glad everything worked out well. I felt great. I felt strong coming into the finish. My teammates helped me a lot and pushed me through the whole time. We were all working each other.\"\n\"I was happy with the boys side because they went out and did what they were supposed to do,\" said Raiders cross country coach Trish Butler. \"They worked as a pack together.\n\"On the girls side we are trying to get back and win a state championship,\" Butler added. \"I am pretty pleased that they came away with another championship today, but the real picture is pulling it together for the state championships.\"\n Cross Country Running Running Broward County Athletic Association", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-56208c4d/turbine/fl-brow-xc-championships-1016-20151015", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-56204a33/turbine/sfl-latest-sun-sentinel-cross-country-results-oct-15-20151015"], "published": "2015-10-16T03:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T10:59:44.332+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
