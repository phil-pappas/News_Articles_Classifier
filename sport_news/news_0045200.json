(Photo: Eric Draper, AP)\n7 CONNECT 39 TWEET LINKEDIN 1 COMMENT EMAIL MORE The former cellmate Lawrence Phillips is accused of killing hid razor blades in a Bible, soap and in his pubic hair and once attacked an inmate with a razor-edged weapon, according to custody records.\nThe razor blades were discovered during three incidents between 2004 and '06 and the attack took place in '08 when Damion Soward was in San Bernardino (Calif.) County Jail, the records show. Prison guards also recovered a six-inch knife in Soward’s shoe in 2014 when he was going through a metal detector at Calipatria State Prison, according to records.\nPhillips, the former football star, faces first-degree murder charges in Soward's death in April at Kern State (Calif.) State Prison.\nUSA TODAY\nLawrence Phillips seeks to pay murder defense with NFL concussion settlement\nJesse Whitten, a private attorney who will be representing Phillips, and Andi Bridges, a deputy district attorney for Kern County who is prosecuting the case, both declined to comment.\nIn total, Soward was involved in 12 incidents involving weapons or violence while incarcerated dating back to 2004, according to the records.\nIn 2008, Soward assaulted an inmate with a razor-edged weapon in the San Bernardino County Jail and the inmate suffered injuries to his face and arms, records show. A year earlier, according to records, guards found Soward and another inmate pinning down a third inmate and beating him with chains, fists and elbows.\nSoward, who was serving an 82-year sentence before he died April 12, was a member of the Projects Gangland Black Rag Mafia Crip Street Gang, records show.\nIn letters Phillips wrote to former coaches over 18 months before Soward’s death, he said he’d had conflicts inside prison with gang members. Phillips also wrote that he’d accepted solitary confinement rather then share a cell with a gang member.\nUSA TODAY\nLawrence Phillips hinted at murder a month before cellmate found dead\nPhillips, who was the star running back on the University of Nebraska's championship teams in 1994 and 1995 and played three seasons in NFL, is due back in court in December for a preliminary hearing.\n7 CONNECT 39 TWEET LINKEDIN 1 COMMENT EMAIL MORE TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/d67a734d404ba527840e56746b7a9d10c2859808/c=0-43-1279-1322/local/-/media/2015/09/26/USATODAY/USATODAY/635788772395305586-AP-IB05-ANOTE-25-RAMS-PHILLIPS.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/734fac10538d13406c1d7cd31ef155a9e07b4676/r=300x400/local/-/media/2015/10/08/USATODAY/USATODAY/635798990150689307-AP-OSBORNE-PHILLIPS.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/629d653a071cca7d75927821d27cec993e450283/c=0-0-1341-1788&r=537&c=0-0-534-712/local/-/media/2015/10/08/USATODAY/USATODAY/635798990150689307-AP-OSBORNE-PHILLIPS.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/fed4a6db661651f6f32381c6fa0ac1583618b4e8/c=168-0-1028-860/local/-/media/2015/06/02/USATODAY/usatsports/ap_c11g1eddie14_6p3_x_10_lines_487013-e1433245584550.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/10/08/USATODAY/USATODAY/635798990150689307-AP-OSBORNE-PHILLIPS.jpg", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1Rwagto&mini=true", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1Rwagto&text=Lawrence%20Phillips%27%20dead%20cellmate%20hid%20razor%20blades%20in%20Bible%2C%20pubic%20hair&via=usatoday"], "published": "2015-10-08T21:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T22:04:21.257+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
