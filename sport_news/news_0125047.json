I think we made everybody in the audience feel something and that was the goal.\" \nEight ladies competitors followed the pairs and all eyes were on 20-year-old Gracie Gold, who finished fourth at the 2014 Olympics and came into Skate America as one of the favorites. \nGold, 20, skated well but made one costly mistake, turning her triple flip into a double. She received a score of 65.39 and was in second place, trailing 15-year-old Russian dynamo Evgenia Medvedeva (70.92) by a considerable margin going into the long program. \n\"I'm really pleased with how I performed today but I'm also very, very frustrated,\" Gold said. \"Things that I did in the program were so good, but you just can't mess up a jump in the short program. \n\"It was really frustrating because I did the two (jumps) that were harder for me, which would be the triple-triple and my double axel. I conquered those and then just didn't hit the triple flip.\" \nSatoko Miyahara of Japan, the reigning world silver medalist, was in third place (65.12) and American Karen Chen was in fourth (62.28). \nChen, 16, won bronze at the U.S. championships earlier this year. She was making her Grand Prix debut. \n\"I'm very excited to be here,\" she said. \"I remember as a little kid watching these competitions on TV. I'm very happy with how it went. I knew I could do a clean short program.\" \nThe 4-9 Medvedeva also was making her senior Grand Prix debut after an undefeated 2014 season on the junior Grand Prix circuit. She's the latest in a long line of talented Russian skaters. \n\"Every year there are new girls coming up and you have to be on top of your game if you want to be a competitor,\" she said through a translator. \"If you work hard enough, things will fall into place.\" \nU.S. pairs Tarah Kayne and Daniel O'Shea and Jessica Pfund and Joshua Santillan, making their Grand Prix debuts, were in sixth and eighth place, respectively. \nPfund and Santillan, who have been skating together for just six months, were last-minute replacements for Gretchen Donlan and Nathan Bartholomay. Donlan is recovering from symptoms related to an acute viral illness. \n\"It's still kind of hard to grasp the concept that we are here at Skate America right now,\" Santillan said. \"Once I got out on the ice I felt the energy of the crowd. There were a thousand thoughts going through my head, but we really tried to sell it out there.\" \nMore than half the seats in the Panther Arena were empty in the afternoon session, but the crowd was enthusiastic. \n\"I thought the crowd was amazing,\" Chen said. \"They cheered from beginning to end.\" \nThe Skate America competition concludes with two sessions Saturday. The pairs and ladies free skate starts at 1:20 p.m. and the free dance and men's free skate starts at 7:30 p.m. An exhibition, the Smucker's Skating Spectacular, is scheduled for 2 p.m. Sunday.
