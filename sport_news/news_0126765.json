In the first moments of gazing at our test car, a 2016 Forester 2.5i Premium, you may marvel at how they have managed to wrap all that interesting technology—Subaru’s inimitable front-mounted, horizontally opposed four-cylinder engine with permanent all-wheel drive—in all that frump. Oh, honey. You’re not going to the prom in that?\nBut the epic dowdiness is camouflage. Lying just beneath the baggy-pants sheet metal, and behind that turned-up mush of a face, is one of the market’s best cars. Nothing is sacrificed to appearances; all is function. For example, the Forester’s unglamorous profile is primarily an effect of its low belt line—the lower edge of the windows—and the large window area and arching hatchback roofline. The big greenhouse with clear outward and downward views is one of those critical segment differentiators for the Forester, another facet of its worthiness off-road.\nBut compared with finely tapering compact crossovers like the Ford Escape, the bubble-topped Subie looks like it should be dispensing soda.\nENLARGE LOOKS AREN’T EVERYTHING | The Subaru Forester boasts impressive mileage and handling and some best-in-class features on the inside. Photo: Dan Neil/The Wall Street Journal It’s the same with the Forester’s hitched up pants: those wheel-arch clearances, full wrap of lower-body plastic cladding, and the segment-superlative 8.7 inches of ground clearance, isn’t even a little rakish. Nobody cares. A Forester with winter tires is pretty much unstoppable, and that’s what matters. And as for aesthetics, the most beautiful thing in the world is a car that doesn’t get stuck in a snowdrift.\nI took my eye off the Forester for a year or so. Motor Trend named it 2014 SUV of the Year in the meantime, so it’s not exactly a well-kept secret. But when one showed up in front of my house recently, I was stunned. This is just a flat lot of automobile for the money. The Forester, representing about a third of Subaru’s overall U.S. sales, achieves its value shrewdly, by putting its brains and costs right where they matter and few places they don’t.\n2016 Subaru Forester 2.5i Premium ENLARGE 2016 Subaru Forester Interior Photo: Subaru of America, Inc. Base price: $25,795\nPrice, as tested: $28,540\nPowertrain: Naturally aspirated 2.5-liter DOHC flat-four engine with variable valve timing; continuously variable transmission; full-time all-wheel drive\nPower/torque: 170 hp at 5,800 rpm/174 pound-feet at 4,100 rpm\nLength/weight: 180.9 inches/3,366 pounds\nWheelbase: 103.9 inches\n0-60 mph: 8.4 seconds\nEPA fuel economy: 24/32/27 mpg, city/highway/combined\nCargo capacity: 34.4/74.7 cubic feet, rear seat back up/down\nSo, no automatic headlights or keyless start until you get to the tippy-top packages. The Subaru seats, padding and upholstery are serviceable but they exhibit no great ergonomic insight or particular effort. No one in China is reverse engineering the Subaru’s cutting-edge floor mats.\nBut the rear 60/40 seat back does the one thing it has to do—fold flat to create open cargo space—flawlessly. The Forester’s recent increase in acreage puts it in the hunt with segment leaders such as the Honda CR-V , Toyota RAV4 , and Ford Escape . With the Forester’s rear seat backs down, cargo space expands to 74.7 cubic feet, a bit bigger than a Honda CR-V for instance\nRight, then, let’s put on the overalls. The price out the door for the Venetian Red Pearl Forester 2.5i Premium with navigation, the all-weather package and EyeSight driver-assist system: $28,540. That provides for a full-time all-wheel-drive system churned by a 2.5-liter boxer engine (170 hp and 174 pound-feet of torque) buttoned to a continuously variable transmission (CVT). Subie’s CVT includes a low-range function for softroading; a hill-descent logic to control speed going downhill; and a gear-simulating, step-change logic to limit the engine drone at highway speeds. This is a very smart box.\nAdd our test car’s 17-inch alloy wheels with all-season radials, and you are looking at a premium-entry powertrain at budget prices.\nNotes on the 2.5i: Engine vibration and noise abatement are further improved from the mark last time around. Refinement is pivotal in small-displacement engines because they have to work so much harder to answer the same driver demands, and, as I say, with CVTs the sound of whining engine can go right through your soul’s eyeballs.\nNail the throttle and the boxer engine jumps up like a dog by the door, and as the CVT finds its ratio the Forester bays mournfully.\nIn a car like this you look at peak acceleration not as entertainment but as satisfying the occasional imperative for safety. If I had to accelerate to avoid an accident, could I? With a 0-60 mph acceleration time of 8.4 seconds, the answer is a definite maybe. If you need more scoot, the Forester comes in a more asphalt-y 2.0 XT edition, with a turbocharged, 250-hp version of the boxer four.\nOur test car was proudly labeled PZEV, the low-emission gold standard set by California clear-air regulators. In light of the recent unpleasantness with Volkswagen, it’s worth noting that the Forester is rated at 27 mpg average and, in my 300-mile test drive in mixed driving over two weeks, my displayed mileage was right on top of that.\nIf mileage is your thing you may want to give up the six-speed manual: The highway fuel economy of the cars with the CVT is 3 mpg higher than the stick-equipped cars.\nThe Subaru’s construction is unexceptional—a welded unit-body of stamped-steel parts—but it’s leveraged into being very safe, with Five Star ratings from NHTSA and “Top Safety Pick+” status from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. Subaru’s suite of seven airbags around the cabin, including driver knee bag, is reassuring.\nThe underpinnings are unstinting in the sub-$30,000 segment: struts up front and independent double wishbones in back, and stabilizers front and rear. No one is going to buy the car to run a daringly wide road in Wales. But the compliance and articulation that might make the Forester a little pitchy on asphalt also make the run smooth and stable on your nearest logging road.\nThrow in the Premium trim level’s panoramic moonroof, roof rails, the previously noted alloy wheels, and that’s the outside. The only other budget item was the bullet to put down the stylist. Where did all the money go? Inside. Subaru is trying to gain market share outside the Snow Belt, in the South, and the Forester is sweetened like iced tea. For example, our unassuming test car was equipped with Subaru’s EyeSight Driver-Assist system that relies on binocular lenses to see the road and traffic ahead. The EyeSight unit is built into the ceiling above the rearview mirror. If it senses the driver has failed to slow sufficiently to avoid an accident, the system will step in. The EyeSight system comes bundled with steering-responsive fog lamps, which is a nice value-added touch.\nIn the middle of the dash is the voice-activated multimedia navigation head, with satellite radio and smartphone connectivity and apps such as Pandora, also providing the display for the rear camera.\nThough it’s the Forester’s rivals that should be looking behind them.", "external_links": ["http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/OD-BH882_RUMBLE_M_20150929150035.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KO164_Rumble_P_20150930094658.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/OD-BH882_RUMBLE_P_20150929150035.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KO164_Rumble_M_20150930094658.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-01T23:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T00:34:01.220+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
