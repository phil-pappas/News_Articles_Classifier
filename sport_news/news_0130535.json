They made a 25-yard first-quarter field goal by Matean Sedaghat stand up in a 3-0 win over the Lancers.\nAs the emotional exuberance of the win set in, Indian Hills coach Joe Sabella praised his defense.\n“We said all week long leading up to this, bend but don’t break, and I think that’s what we were able to do,” he said. “They had some drives, but we never faltered, never let up the big play and kept them out of the end zone.”\nThe Lancers (2-2) got inside the Braves’ 30-yard line only twice, with both drives ending on fourth-down incomplete passes that were knocked away by Trevor Spitaletta (first quarter) and Ryan Janiga (5:59 left in the game).\nIndian Hills also was able to contain Lakeland quarterback Danny Mullin, who spent the majority of the game doing a wonderful impression of Fran Tarkenton, scrambling out of the pocket and slicing and dicing for yards.\nMullin had 103 rushing yards on 16 carries, but his longest gain was 17 yards. He was sacked twice and was pressured into a 4 of 17 passing effort for 56 yards.\n“That was the focus all week,” Sabella said. “We knew there were going to be times he was going to make us pay, but it was about keeping him in the box, not letting him get the edge.”\nThe only score of the game came when the Braves were facing a fourth down on their 40-yard line and went with a fake punt. The pass went incomplete, but there was a roughing-the-passer penalty on Lakeland that extended the Indian Hills possession. Two plays later, Nick Wisnovsky found a crease off left tackle and went 33 yards to the Lancer 12. They stalled at the 8, but Sedaghat knocked the field goal through with 5:50 on the first quarter clock.\nIndian Hills had another golden chance after a botched Lakeland punt set them up at the Lancer 7. On fourth down, Braves QB Tim O’Brien was stopped inches short of the goal line.\n“I was thinking 9-0 at that point and being up two scores” Sabella said. “With the rain and wind I wasn’t sure about the field goal, but I was kicking myself at halftime.”\nHis defense picked him up and his offense, specifically wide receiver Derek Anderson, made his decision moot. After a first half that saw the two teams go a combined 0 for 14 passing, Anderson made a pair of solid catches to give his team field position.\nThe first was a 34-yard reception on third and 11 from the Hills 21-yard line. That drive ended in a fumble, but the Braves held on defense. After being buried at the IH 7-yard line off a punt, Anderson made an 18-yard grab on third-and-18 that helped Hills move into Lancer territory.\n“I just had to catch the ball with my hands,” Anderson said. “I had one in the first quarter that I didn’t hold on to. It was about making the plays we needed to keep possession.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T03:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T08:10:23.181+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
