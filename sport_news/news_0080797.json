We came out with a positive mindset, and we let up a little bit too much and we paid for it a little bit.\" \nHills called his own number on first-and-goal from Ohio State's three-yard line and cut the Buckeyes' lead over the Terrapins to 21-14 with just 43 seconds left to play in the first half. \nBefore finishing the scoring drive, Hills and the Terrapins faced a first-and-15 from their own 22-yard line after a false-start penalty backed them up five yards. However, Hills was undeterred by the early setback. After taking the snap from center, Hills sprinted through all three levels of Ohio State's defense and gained 75 yards before being tackled inside the five. \nAlready with momentum on their side after a late touchdown run in the second quarter, the Terrapins marched 69 yards in nine plays and drew even with the Buckeyes, 21-21, with 11:17 to play in the third period. \nHills completed three straight passes to start the second half, which totaled 23 yards, and the Terrapins got an extra 15 yards on a roughing-the-passer penalty against Ohio State All-American defensive end Joey Bosa. \nThe penalty moved the ball from midfield to Ohio State's 31-yard line, and three plays later, Hills extended the drive with a three-yard rush on third-and-three. Three plays later, he ran through Ohio State's interior defense and into the end zone for his second rushing touchdown of the game. \n\"The thing about a running quarterback is he changes the math,\" senior linebacker Joshua Perry said. \"It's another guy you have to defend, so when you think you have an advantage in the box, that guy comes in there and he starts running. You're a little bit short on numbers. You've got to be creative; you've got to be really sound doing it. You've got to prepare for it. \n\"You go in the locker room and tell everybody to keep their damn head up. That's the first thing. You don't want guys moping around, which we really didn't have, and then, we knew we were going to be on the field first and we said, \"Make a stop and get off the field. Make a point. Let them know that they're not going to be able to cut down the field like that again.' I think that's huge just being able to go out there, know we're going to have to respond in a big way and then, just doing it.\" \nAlthough the Buckeyes struggled against a running quarterback for the second straight week, Perry believes the Buckeyes will correct course and become the defense they want to be as Big Ten Conference play continues next week against the Penn State Nittany Lions at Ohio Stadium. \n\"We played really, really hard,\" Perry said. \"The effort was there and the energy and the demeanor was, and I think that's big. That's something we take pride in. Obviously, we wish would've played a little better. I saw that we gave up quite a few rushing yards and the quarterback probably had the majority of them. That's something we're definitely going to have to work on, and I know our coaches our going to have the answer. \n\"Our coaches probably get a little more flustered on the sideline and probably press a little bit more than the players do just because I think we trust each other so much that we know all we have to do is go back on the field and get another chance. That's one of the great thing that we do, just trust in one another to go out there and make plays.\" Read or Share this story: http://on.wkyc.com/1LonWWo TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T01:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T01:55:18.921+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
