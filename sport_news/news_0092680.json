Gardner of the Journal Sentinel Oct. 12, 2015 9:08 p.m. \nSt. Francis — Rashad Vaughn can shoot it. \nThat's why the 19-year-old is a member of the Milwaukee Bucks. \nAnd the rookie could get a chance to make a significant contribution this season, adding his perimeter pop to the slashing dunks expected from Jabari Parker and Giannis Antetokounmpo and the low-post game of Greg Monroe. \nBucks coach Jason Kidd is known to use his entire roster, so it won't be a surprise to see the slender youngster in the lineup in key moments. \n\"I think he can participate,\" Kidd said after practice Monday. \"He's working extremely hard in preseason and we do play everybody. \n\"He'll have his opportunities throughout the season to show us he deserves more minutes and hopefully he gets more minutes, because that means he's doing the right thing.\" \nKidd boosted Vaughn's confidence by putting him in the starting lineup in the preseason opener in Chicago last week, and the former Nevada-Las Vegas player responded with a team-high 20 points in 35 minutes. He hit 8 of 14 shots and 3 of 6 from three-point range. \nVaughn followed up with 11 points in 23 minutes off the bench in the Bucks' loss to Detroit on Saturday night. \n\"I didn't know what to expect coming in,\" Vaughn said. \"It's basketball and I've been playing this all my life. Once I took my first shot, it was comfortable after that. \n\"You've always just got to get that one shot up or that one moment in, and everything goes back to normal. Now it's each day trying to get more confidence in myself.\" \nVaughn said he didn't interview with the Bucks at the pre-draft combine in May, so he had little inkling he would wind up in Milwaukee. \nBut Bucks officials saw him in a multiple team workout and invited him in a few days before the draft. Milwaukee selected him with the 17th overall pick on draft night. \n\"He could shoot the ball, that's one,\" Kidd said of what caught the Bucks' attention. \"And also his demeanor, being 19 years old, he's very mature, acts a lot older on the court and off the court. \n\"Making shots, he's not one to celebrate. He just does his job. Every shot looks like a good shot, and he'll learn what's a good shot and a bad shot. He just plays the game. Make a mistake, he moves on to the next moment. \n\"When he does well, it's not as if he needs the whole world to know. He just keeps playing. That's what really stuck out for us when we saw him working out.\" \nVaughn already has received a major compliment from a veteran NBA coach. Detroit's Stan Van Gundy was impressed after watching the Minneapolis native play against the Pistons on Saturday night. \n\"The Vaughn kid put on a show in the fourth quarter, as he did in Chicago the other night,\" Van Gundy said. \"We're going to be dealing with him for a long time in the league. He's got a quick release and can really, really shoot the ball.\" \nVaughn knows the three-pointer is a huge weapon for NBA teams — witness Golden State with the Splash Brothers tandem of Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson. \n\"You look at the Warriors; they won a championship and they live and die by the three,\" Vaughn said. \"For me to shoot threes is definitely going to help me along the line. \n\"When (the Bucks) drafted me, I knew why. I was happy coming in knowing they drafted me for something they needed.\" \nKhris Middleton ranked 10th in the league in three-point percentage last season and will be a weapon on the perimeter, and Greivis Vasquez, O.J. Mayo and Vaughn also have the ability to score from beyond the arc. \nVaughn weighs just 202 pounds and already has seen the speed and strength of NBA players will be a challenge for him. \n\"These are some grown men; everybody is strong here,\" Vaughn said. \"I've got to get in the weight room.\" \nNotebook: Miles Plumlee is day-to-day with right knee soreness after taking an awkward fall on a dunk attempt Saturday against the Pistons. Plumlee made the trip to Cleveland but Kidd said the center would not play in Tuesday night's preseason matchup against the Cavaliers....Jabari Parker also is on the trip but will not play as he continues his recovery from off-season knee surgery. Chris Copeland (family situation) is not with the team. © 2015 , Journal Sentinel Inc. All rights reserved. About Charles F.
