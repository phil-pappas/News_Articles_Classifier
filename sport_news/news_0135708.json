Nevada, last week's opponent, reportedly tried to simulate the 6-5, 260-pound sophomore's speedy first step in practice by lining up offsides. Some national pundits are including the defensive end among Heisman Trophy contenders.\nAs the Arlington Martin product comes home Saturday to open SEC play against Arkansas at AT&T Stadium, he shrugged off the attention, even as his profile and production continue to increase.\n\"I'm no different than anybody else,\" he said. \"I ride my bike to class, get my work done, ride back. Go to practice.\"\nGarrett said he doesn't have a targeted number of sacks he wants to reach this season, after his 11 1/2 last season broke Jadeveon Clowney's SEC freshman record. Just three of Garrett's sacks came in SEC play, in part because he dealt with torn ligaments in his thumb for the second half of the season.\n\"There's a lot of plays that I could've had more effort,\" Garrett said. \"I just want to affect the offense every time I'm on the field.\"\nBut Garrett is also cognizant of wanting his life to be more than football. He writes poetry and tries to read a book every two weeks.\nHe left Twitter and refrains from social media because, \"I don't need to let people's opinions and other things stick with me ... when I have other things that I can do with my time -- getting better as a person, football player and leader,\" he said.\nWhen he finally met with the media members who cover A&M for the first time -- he declined many requests for interviews previously -- during preseason camp, he left the curious horde with, of all things, a homework assignment.\nWhat is the largest carnivorous dinosaur?\nGarrett, an unabashed, lifelong dinosaur fan, confirmed this week it's the Spinosaurus aegyptiacus.\nEarly promise \"That's Myles to a T,\" said Anthony Gonzales, aka Coach Gonzo, who coached the defensive line at Martin while Garrett attended. \"I know he wants to be in the NFL and to be the best. But he wants people to know there's more to Myles Garrett than sacking the quarterback.\"\nGonzales, now the defensive coordinator at Fort Worth Dunbar, and his wife are attending Saturday's game as Garrett's guests, along with Garrett's parents, Lawrence and Audrey.\nThey all grew tight over the years as Gonzales also coached Garrett and his sister, Brea, a former A&M athlete, in track and field.\nGonzales said he helped provide extra structure for Garrett, part of a support system that helped Garrett realize just how good he could be entering his sophomore year at Martin.\nGarrett said playing at home in front of family and friends Saturday gives him an extra boost.\nFor Gonzales, he's found the most satisfaction in watching Garrett when he's away from the ball, still drawing attention from the offense.\n\"I'm happy when he makes a big-time play,\" Gonzales said. \"But when the ball is away from him, he's just as phenomenal.\"\nLeader emerges In last week's win over Nevada, Garrett made two of his 3 1/2 sacks on back-to-back snaps in the fourth quarter to seal the result. It turned out, Garrett had two wisdom teeth removed earlier in the week, was suffering from cramps and just wanted to end his day's work.\n\"I was exhausted,\" he said.\nGarrett and the entire defense, the worst in the SEC the last two seasons, have thrived so far in the aggressive attacking scheme of new defensive coordinator John Chavis. He's called Garrett and end Daeshon Hall two of the best in college football.\n\"Myles has really grown in his leadership ability, and he should,\" Chavis said. \"You don't have to talk a lot to be a great leader. You have to be about your work, and get it done.\"\nArkansas has yet to allow a sack. Garrett said it doesn't matter if he gets sacks Saturday, as long as he can affect the game with tackles for loss, batting down balls, whatever.\nHe said A&M's overtime win last season against Arkansas opened his eyes, as the Hogs ran the ball 47 times for 285 yards behind its hefty offensive line. Garrett focused on improving against the run this season.\nAs opponents grow ever more wary of Garrett's impact on the game, he said he just wants to keep having fun on the field by making plays. Off the field, well, Garrett may surprise.\n\"I like to go around and meet people,\" he said. \"They don't get the chance to meet somebody on the football team. ... I like putting a smile on peoples' faces. I like being nice.\"\nFollow Kate Hairopoulos on Twitter @khairopoulos\nTale of the tape Texas A&M defensive end Myles Garrett's statistics as a freshman and through three games of his sophomore season:\n2014 Category 2015 12 Games 3 53 Tackles 16 14 For loss 6 1/2 11 1/2 Sacks 5 1/2 67 Yds. on sacks 27 On Twitter:\n @kHairopoulos", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/kHairopoulos"], "published": "2015-09-24T06:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T14:33:45.064+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
