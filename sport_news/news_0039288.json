All 14 eligible Spartan players saw court time on the evening, and MSU was paced by setter Rachel Minarick , who's sixth double-double of the season was sweetened by four blocks and three kills. Alyssa Garvelink turned in another impressive performance, hitting .647 on a match-best 12 kills. \nThe Spartans win their third straight match, and own a 13-6 overall record, and improve to 5-3 in the Big Ten. The Scarlet Knights fall to 3-16, 0-8 in Conference play. \n\"It was nice for us to be able to get all of our players in tonight, because everyone has been working so hard every day in practice and really deserve the opportunity,\" coach Cathy George said. \"We also need them to gain that experience beccause you never know when you will need someone to step in. We focused this week on our game, and getting better - next week will wrap up the first half of Big Ten play, and we're going to be facing two top-ten teams. We'll focus on the same things this week - improving and fine-tuning to make our game better.\" \nThe Spartans continue a four-game homestand on Wednesday when they host No. 7 Ohio State on Wednesday, followed by a Saturday date with No. 5 Penn State. 2015 graduate Kori Moster will have her All-America banner lifted into the Jenison Field House rafters prior to the Penn State match. \n-MSU athletic communications Read or Share this story: http://on.lsj.com/1RP7OhL TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T08:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T17:14:47.371+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
