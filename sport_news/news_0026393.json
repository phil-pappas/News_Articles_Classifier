(Wade Spees/Staff) A man was diagnosed with prostate cancer about six years ago, and underwent robotic surgery at the Roper St. Francis Cancer Center. One day, a familiar face appeared in the doorway of his hospital room. “It was Ken Burger,” said the patient, Joe Thompson. “And when he walked in the room, I knew I was not in this alone.” Thompson is among the many whose lives were impacted by Burger, a journalist and novelist who gained national fame as a Post and Courier sports columnist and turned his prostate cancer into an awareness campaign. Burger died Tuesday night in Mount Pleasant. He was two days shy of his 66th birthday. During his tenure at The Post and Courier from 1984 to 2011, Burger also served as Washington correspondent, executive sports editor and metro columnist. He is survived by his wife, Bonnie Grossman; his brother, Frank and sister-in-law Shirley; children Allyson, Courtney and Brent; and six grandchildren. ‘Extraordinary devotion’ Burger was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2007 and began using his Post and Courier column to urge men to get checkups. The Ken Burger Prostate Challenge Golf Tournament became an annual Kiawah Island staple, raising more than $400,000 in seven years to cover the costs of a nurse-navigator and other patient support at the Cancer Center. In May of 2015, the Roper St. Francis Foundation and Cancer Center dedicated the Ken Burger Consultation Room on the 7th floor of Roper Hospital. Charleston Mayor Joe Riley said he has no doubt that Burger’s work saved and extended lives. “The power of his writing about his battle with prostate cancer was so instructive to the citizens of our region,” Riley said. “You don’t know how many lives Ken saved with his courageous writing about his battle. He was such a powerful writer, and he made such a huge contribution to the fight against cancer.” Burger did more than write about the fight. He was in hospital rooms with patients in the midst of their own battles. “His devotion to his fellow patients was extraordinary,” said Scott Broome, service line director for oncology at Roper St. Francis. “Ken was a charismatic person, and had a way of being honest with people, but also encouraging. I know he has helped people choose to get checked, or at least be made aware of the risk factors of prostate cancer.” Thompson, a 1968 graduate of The Citadel who lives on Johns Island, was one of those patients. “He has made a tremendous impact in bringing prostate cancer to the forefront,” said Thompson. “If anybody tells you they don’t know who Ken Burger is, they haven’t lived in Charleston very long. Everybody knew him and knew his passion for this, and that made you pay more attention when he talked about prostate cancer. He made a tremendous positive impact.” ‘He was the man’ An Allendale native, Burger boasted that he was 12 before seeing a town larger than Walterboro. He attended Swallow Savannah Methodist Church as a boy and used “Swallow Savannah” as the title of his first novel in 2008. Burger wrote about graduating last in his class at the University of Georgia’s Grady College of Journalism, but his distinguished newspaper career made him a popular guest speaker at Georgia and other universities. Burger worked for newspapers in Columbia for 10 years before joining The Post and Courier (formerly News and Courier). Early in his 40-year tenure as mayor, Riley encountered Burger for the first time. “I was a feisty young mayor and he was a feisty young reporter,” Riley said. “But I really grew to like and admire Ken very much. He was just a fabulous writer, seemingly born with a pen in his hand. A brilliant, colorful writer with such a wonderful love for his craft.” As a sports columnist from 1988-2008, Burger covered the Masters, golf’s U.S. Open, the Super Bowl, World Series, Final Four, college football national championship games, various other bowl games and the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta. “Ken had a very creative pen and could write about sports and life equally well,” said former College of Charleston basketball coach John Kresse, who led the Cougars to four NCAA Tournament appearances in the 1990s. “His words had a magical beauty as he described and analyzed the game, the players and the coaches. I really admired that after his first bout with cancer, Ken shared his experiences with the community and visited hospital patients to encourage and motivated them to fight the cancer battle.” Just as much as major events, Burger enjoyed covering “human interest” stories closer to home and was widely known for rich writing that touched heartstrings among sports fans and non-sports fans. “Everyone knows Ken was a great sportswriter, and he has plenty of national and local awards to prove it,” said former Post and Courier Executive Editor Larry Tarleton. “But he was much more than that. Ken was a great writer, period. He didn’t necessarily write about sports; he wrote with compassion about people and lifestyle because he knew that was much more important.” Three times, and as recently as 1999, Burger won Associated Press Sports Editors contests for best column writing in a national mid-range circulation category. He won dozens of South Carolina Press Association writing awards, including Journalist of the Year in 1996. “No one was better at what he did,” said Associated Press national columnist Jim Litke. “His columns reminded me of the warning that used to be stamped onto the sideview mirrors of cars: Objects may be closer than they appear. He’d slow-walk you into a story about someone else — the famous and not-so, sometimes himself — then drop in a sentence or two that rang so emotionally true it made you remember why those games matter so much to you, too, if only for the course of a few hours.” After his retirement from The Post and Courier in 2011, Burger remained active as a writer with blogs and books. Along with “Swallow Savannah,” his works included novels “Sister Santee” and “Salkehatchie Soup” and a collection of columns titled “Baptized in Sweet Tea.” “You wrote better about iced tea than any southerner in history,” bestselling author Pat Conroy said, “but most of all, great Ken Burger, you brought enormous joy to the readers who learned from you and your friends who loved you. I’m proud to be one of those friends.” In his own words, Burger said he “graduated dead-last in his class at the University of Georgia, has been married five times, is a gratefully recovering alcoholic, a cancer survivor, and a happy man.” “He was the man in Charleston, and in the state,” said basketball coach Les Robinson, whom Burger covered during his days at The Citadel, East Tennessee State and North Carolina State. “Athletics wasn’t what he was writing about; he was writing about life.” Keywords", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T06:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T05:53:27.095+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
