The visiting Hermits went on to trounce the Eagles 56-0 on Friday night, staying undefeated at 7-0 with their first shutout. \nSt. Augustine’s seven-touchdown advantage was the largest lead the team has held at any point this season. Starters were relieved in the second half with the game in control. \n“I loved (the lead) for a lot of reasons obviously because we were probably going to win the game, the clock runs,” Reardon said. “But we get a chance to get the kids who practice all week with us, who may not be getting onto the field as much as they’d like to be playing, we get a chance to get them in for a full second half. It’s just a good night on all ends.” \nAfter finding pay dirt on just the fifth play of the game last week, the Hermits needed only the opening kick to jump ahead as junior Ezekiel Ennis ripped off an 84-yard return touchdown. \n“That definitely gave us a lot of momentum,” Ennis said. “It put us in a great position to go up and play great football at a high level. It just set the momentum for us going forward and in the next quarters.” \nOn St. Augustine's first possession, Ennis followed his return score with a scamper from eight yards out on a 4th and 1 play. Dobbins capped off the next drive with a 7-yard rushing touchdown and the Hermits quickly built a 21-0 lead before the end of the first quarter. \nDobbins surpassed 1,000 yards rushing for the season on the night, doing so on his third run, a 17-yarder. In just a half of action, the sophomore bell cow totaled 181 yards on 16 carries and reached the end zone three times. \n“He’s playing awesome,” Reardon said. “He runs hard, he’s physical, he’s just a really, really good player.” \nAn interception by senior A.J. Baxter around midfield set up the drive that led to the first Dobbins score. The defense had big takeaways all game, with all but one of four interceptions resulting in points. \nSenior linebacker Jim Brady picked off Eagles senior quarterback David Price with just over three minutes to go in the first and finished the play with a 19-yard score. \nAt the end of the quarter, sophomore Shamere Collins hauled in Price’s third interception of the game. The turnover would eventually result in a touchdown run of 47 yards by senior quarterback Jose Tabora at the 10:12 mark of the second. \nSt. Augustine held Egg Harbor to just 80 yards of total offense and did not allow a completed pass from Price in six attempts. It took backup quarterback Billy Germana coming into the game for the Eagles to have any life. He was just a mere 3-of-8 for 24 yards with an interception on the final play of the game. \n“[The defense] played great,” Ennis said. “We’re arguably one of the best defenses and it showed tonight.” \nIn his first action, quarterback Josh Zamot manned a six-play, 57-yard drive for St. Augustine and ran in a 14-yard touchdown. The sophomore finished 2-of-2 passing for 29 yards after replacing Tabora. \nThe Hermits travel to face off against Vineland on Friday, Oct. 30 in the team's final American Conference game of the season. A win would hand the Prep the conference crown. \n“It’s the first of hopefully many steps down the road,” Reardon said. “So from my perspective, winning our conference is the most important thing we can do right now and then we’ll see what happens at the state playoffs.\" \nSt. Augustine Prep 28 21 7 0 - 56 \nEgg Harbor Twp. 0 0 0 0 - 0 \nScoring summary SA- Ennis 84-yard return (Fondacaro kick) SA- Ennis 8-yard run (Fondacaro kick) SA- Dobbins 7-yard run (Fondacaro kick) SA- Brady 19-yard interception return (Fondacaro kick) SA- Tabora 47-yard run (Fondacaro kick) SA- Dobbins 2-yard run (Fondacaro kick) SA- Dobbins 75-yard run (Fondacaro kick) SA- Zamot 14-yard run (Fondacaro kick) \nTeam Stats St. Augustine Egg Harbor Township \nFirst Downs 9 6", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T07:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T03:08:07.286+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
