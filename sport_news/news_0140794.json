Mangus will be named interim coach on Tuesday. Several other outlets reported Monday that Spurrier was set to retire. \nSpurrier, 70, is in his 11 th season at South Carolina. He is 86-49 with the Gamecocks, including three straight 11-win seasons from 2011-13. \nSouth Carolina slipped to 7-6 in 2014, and is 2-4 this season heading into Saturday's home game with Vanderbilt. The Gamecocks are 0-4 in the SEC, including a 45-24 loss to LSU last Saturday in a game that was moved to Baton Rouge following extensive flooding in South Carolina. \nSpurrier won the Heisman Trophy as a quarterback at Florida in 1966, and later spent several seasons playing in the NFL. His first head-coaching job came with the USFL's Tampa Bay Bandits in 1983, and he got his first college head-coaching job at Duke in 1987. \nAfter three seasons with the Blue Devils — including a share of the ACC title in 1989, Spurrier returned to his alma mater in 1990. He won six SEC titles — four straight from 1993-96 — and the 1996 national championship in 12 seasons with the Gators, leaving Gainesville to take over the NFL's Washington Redskins in 2002. \nFollowing two miserable seasons in Washington and a year away from coaching, Spurrier returned to the college game at South Carolina in 2005. He has an overall record of 228-89-2 in 26 seasons as a college head coach, is a seven-time SEC Coach of the Year and was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame as a player in 1986. \nDanny Wuerrfel won the Heisman Trophy as Spurrier's quarterback at Florida in 1996: Thanks @SC_HBC Spurrier for all you've done for college football...and for me. Your impact on me changed the trajectory of my life.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T14:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T14:34:47.871+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
