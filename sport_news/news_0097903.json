And Bulls fans might jump in, now that Derrick Rose (aging, oft-injured diva and orgy aficionado with the $93 million contract) has announced he's doesn't feel financially \"comfortable\" anymore.\nSo what of Chicago Fire fans?\nThe Chicago Fire was once a franchise that meant something, a team that prided itself on honor, tradition and passion.\nBut the Fire now are so pathetic that we Fire fans can't even get into the wallowing pits. Even if they allowed us in, no one would know why we were there.\nBecause after years of meddling, Chicago Fire owner Andrew Hauptman has finally achieved something amazing:\nThe Fire are completely irrelevant in Chicago sports.\nIt's so bad that the Fire are now cemented in last place, a laughingstock of Major League Soccer.\nOnly a few weeks ago, fans were angry. We talked of revolution. Now we just sit there, numb, taking it.\nThe coach, Frank Yallop, was fired after winning only 13 games in two years. They've already set records for losses and it will get worse.\nExcept for a brief in the papers, perhaps a 20-second mention on a broadcast update, there was little or nothing on Yallop's ouster.\nSo the coach was run off and there was nothing. That tells you.\nThe soccer bloggers covered it of course, and they do a fine job. But that's not enough for Fire supporters to gain entry to the Chicago sports fan wallowing pits. You need to register in the city's sports universe to get in. But the Fire does not. So we're lonely nomads in our misery.\nAnd Fire management must like it this way: the Fire, irredeemably incognito.\nYes, I know there are more important subjects than Fire soccer fan anguish. And I'm sure a few of you will take thick red crayon to paper and remind me.\nBut sometimes you just need a break. Call it a mental health vacation, call it fishing. That's why sports fans are sports fans. It helps us keep away from the truly bad in the world for a few hours.\nAnd who can afford to fly to Virgin Gorda on a whim? I don't own a sports team, do you?\nBut since I'm a glutton for punishment, I drove out to the heart of pain, to the sullen village of Bridgeview. Under a gray, spitting sky, it looked rather like the fictionally corrupt town of \"Vinci\" in season two of \"True Detective.\"\nAnd there, behind Toyota Park, was the practice field. So I stood watching the team train under interim coach Brian Bliss and his assistant, Fire legend Logan Pause.\nI could have watched it all day, the skill of it, the players shouting for the ball, warning of onrushing defenders, that wondrous thud when they'd drive their laces through it, and the ball snicking into the net.\nSo I waited, for team officials to come out and presumably love bomb the columnist-season-ticket holder out there on the sideline.\nThere had been news, besides giving away games. After bouncing Yallop, Hauptman hired a general manager, Nelson Rodriguez, a respected soccer executive, who'll be tasked with finding a new coach and signing players.\nUnfortunately, Rodriguez will have a phone. So Hauptman will be calling.\nHauptman did not hire a team president to run the club. And that's what the Fire need, a strong president, someone to tell Hauptman to become a fan again and just love the game and let the president run things.\nI know of one such person in the Chicago area who is capable, familiar with the market and well-respected in the game, with contacts among agents all over the world, a man accomplished in finance and in soccer, who ran a famous club in Europe and another in the U.S.\nI don't want to say his name, but he'd be perfect for it. But Hauptman hasn't hired him, because strong, accomplished team executives don't dance when owners snap their fingers. Instead, they run teams and wise owners listen. Just look at how the Cubs are doing.\nAtul Khosla, the Fire's chief operating officer, had an answer for me.\n\"Andrew owns the team, and if he has questions about the budget or the cost of a player, it's his team,\" said Khosla. \"He has the right to ask. But he hired Nelson Rodriguez to be the GM and run the soccer side.\"\nPractice was over, but a few remained on the field. Among them were young Chicago-area players on the team: Chris Ritter, Harry Shipp, Patrick Doody and 18-year-old Collin Fernandez.\nThe great Logan Pause, who played 12 years for the Fire and endured much of the long, gruesome decline, worked with them. And aging veterans like defender Jeff Larentowicz and goalie Jon Busch stayed too, helping out.\n\"The young players want to work. They want to get better. They want to improve,\" said Pause, his steel gray hair wet in the rain.\nI asked him how he was dealing with it.\n\"Of course it hurts,\" Pause said. \"The fans are hurting, players, no one is happy with this season. No one in the Fire organization thinks it's OK. So you work. You don't stop working.\"\nHe'll never give up. But do Chicago Fire season ticket holders stop paying? As long as Fire management is mostly about meddling, I can't say.\njskass@tribpub.com\nTwitter @John_Kass\n Chicago Fire Frank Yallop Chicago Cubs Logan Pause Jon Busch Opinion Commentary", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-560d446a/turbine/ct-chicago-fire-despair-kass-met-1001-20150930", "https://twitter.com/John_Kass"], "published": "2015-10-01T01:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T21:58:02.171+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
