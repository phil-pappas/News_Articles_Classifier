The impending free agent faced only three over the minimum. \nJimmy Rollins singled in the fourth for the Dodgers, who remain one game behind the New York Mets for the No. 2 seed in the NL. The two teams will play each other in the NL Division Series, though homefield advantage for that showdown has yet to be decided. \nMatt Duffy had three hits, including a two-run home run, while Nick Noonan hit his first career homer for the Giants, who have won four of five. \nThe game drew another sellout crowd to the Giants' waterfront ballpark, but had far less emotion than Tuesday's game, which ended with Los Angeles players celebrating their third consecutive NL West title in the defending World Series champions' stadium. \nThere was no celebration this time, though the Giants relished playing spoiler to their long-time rivals by keeping them behind the Mets. \nDuffy hit his 12th home run of the season in the first after Kelby Tomlinson drew a one-out walk off Dodgers starter Mike Bolsinger (6-6). Duffy, who went into the game leading all NL rookies in hits, also singled in the sixth and in the ninth. \nAngel Pagan reached on an infield single in the third when Bolsinger was late covering the bag, and Tomlinson followed with an RBI double into the right field corner to make it 2-0. \nNoonan homered off Joel Peralta in the seventh. \nBolsinger gave up three runs and four hits in 3 1-3 innings. He struck out seven and walked two but remained winless since Sept. 4. \nTRAINER'S ROOM \nDodgers: Yasiel Puig faced live pitching but has not yet been cleared to run the bases. Puig has been out since Aug. 28 with a hamstring injury. \nGiants: 1B Brandon Belt underwent surgery to repair a torn meniscus in his right knee. Belt, who hasn't played since Sept. 18, has been sidelined with a concussion and recently visited concussion specialist Dr. Michael Collins in Pittsburgh. He's expected to be recovered in time for spring training. . INF Nori Aoki is also meeting with Collins to see if he can be cleared to return before the season ends. \nUP NEXT \nDodgers: LHP Brett Anderson (9-9) pitches against San Francisco on Thursday afternoon. Anderson has beaten the Giants just once in eight previous career starts. \nGiants: RHP Tim Hudson (8-8) will make the final start of his 17-year career in the series finale. Hudson, a four-time All-Star, has 222 career wins, including two against the Dodgers this season. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T08:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T08:46:20.676+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
