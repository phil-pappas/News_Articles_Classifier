If he acted quickly, it was a 3-on-2 opportunity.\nBut Teravainen momentarily lost control of the puck and dumped it off to Duncan Keith, which killed the momentum.\n• The worst gaffe came with 1:57 left in the game when Rick Nash stole Teravainen's attempted pass to Trevor van Riemsdyk.\nNash nearly made it 4-2, but only a brilliant save by Corey Crawford kept the Hawks in the game.\n\"Of course when you see those things again, you want to do something different,\" said Teravainen, who admitted that he may have been a bit nervous during the season opener.\n\"I'm not happy (with) how I played. There's a lot of things I want to do differently.\"\nCoach Joel Quenneville doesn't think his young forward should be so hard on himself.\n\"I think everybody has high standards and (had we won) everybody would have been a little bit more comfortable,\" Quenneville said.\nSvedberg's chance: The Blackhawks called defenseman Viktor Svedberg up from Rockford on Thursday. Quenneville said the 6-foot-8 Swede will make his NHL debut Saturday against the New York Islanders. The Hawks reassigned Ville Pokka to the IceHogs.\n\"I saw big progression in his game,\" Quenneville said of Svedberg. \"A lot of poise with the puck, positioning improved, that long reach. … His effectiveness with the puck is where he really made big strides. … Certainly deserves a chance to play.\"\nSvedberg spent the last two seasons playing for Rockford, scoring 5 goals in 84 games. Quenneville wouldn't say which defenseman would be sitting out in favor of Svedberg.\nHe said it: \"(Artemi) Panarin today, I think he's getting better with his English. I asked him if he's married and he goes, 'No. Single.' And a smile, so that was progress.\"\n-- Quenneville on the Russian forward who is still trying to learn the language\nGet great articles like this sent to your inbox!
