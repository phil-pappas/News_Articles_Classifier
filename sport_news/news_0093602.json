Abdullah Mohammed of Saudi Arabia with a time of 10.48s claimed the bronze. Oman's other entrant Khalid al Ghailani was sixth in a time of 10.94s. \nOman's Ahmed Mubarak earned the other medal in athletics when he clinched the bronze in the 400m event with a time of 47.24s. Saudi Arabia's Yousef Ahmed won the gold in a time of 45.57s, while Bahrain's Abbas Abubakar Abbas won the silver in a time of 46.72s. Oman's Othman al Busaidi was fifth with a time of 48.21s. \nThe national handball team after clinching the bronze medal \nThe two medals helped Oman's overall tally rise to 26 and maintain the third spot among the five nations. Kuwait is not participating in the Games. \nOman has so far four gold, 11 silver and 11 bronze medals, with one more day left. Saudi Arabia leads the standings with 80 medals, including 45 gold, 22 silver and 13 bronze. UAE is second with 65 medals that includes 25 gold, 18 silver and 22 bronze. \nOman's four gold medals came in swimming competitions, with Issa al Adawi claiming three and Abdulrahman al Kulaibi taking the fourth gold in the 400m individual medley in a time of 4m48.99s on Thursday. \nOman's sprint coach Mohammed al Hooti blamed the false start as one of the reasons for Barakat missing out on the gold. “He got distracted and had a poor start, but he did well to finish second. Had he got a good start, he would have fetched the gold as he has shown impressive form in recent times.” \nAbdulrahman al Kulaibi after winning the 400m IM event \n“Barakat had clocked 10.17s at the World Military Games earlier this month in South Korea to win a gold. He was the favourite to win here,” said Hooti. \nOn Thursday, the national handball team claimed a bronze despite losing to eventual champion Saudi Arabia 27-30 in the concluding league match. \nSaudi Arabia won all its four matches to claim the gold, while Bahrain was second with six points. Oman settled for bronze with four points with two wins, against UAE and Qatar, respectively. \nMeanwhile, the sultanate's bowling team failed to make it to the medal round.
