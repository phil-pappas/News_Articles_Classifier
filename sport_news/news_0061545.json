Outside of Lehigh and Bucknell the league is wide open. Hopefully the guys can use (seventh place) as some type of motivation.\" \nLoyola was 11-19, 7-11 last season under Smith, who is 22-38 in two seasons with the Greyhounds. Loyola returns sophomore guard Andre Walker (10.2 points last season), junior guard Eric Laster (10.9) and junior Tyler Hubbard (10.8), who played at Montrose Christian in Rockville. \n\"I think he is playing with a chip on his shoulder this year,\" Smith said of Laster. \"He has been our best player in practice by far. He is more vocal in practice. He is very assertive, which is what we need.\" \nWalker sprained his ankle last week but has returned to practice, according to Smith. \"He is one of our better players. He is playing under control better. Hopefully he can step up and be one of our leaders,\" Smith said. \nThe Greyhounds, who return nearly 90 percent of their scoring, also have senior forward Jarred Jones (John Carroll), who was the team's top returning scorer at the start of last season but his year was derailed with an injury in the second game. \nNavy is 33-89 in four years under DeChellis, the former head coach at Penn State. The Midshipmen were 13-19 overall last season and tied for sixth in the Patriot League at 8-10. Navy loses two starters, Worth Smith and Brandon Venturini, who combined to average 26.5 points per game and nearly 10 boards last season. \n\"We are closer than people may think,\" DeChellis said. \"Our administration has been very supportive. I don't ever look over my shoulder. (The administration) sees where we are going. Four years ago we couldn't beat anybody. Now recruiting has improved every year; that is important. This is a big year for us to continue that trend\" of winning more league games than the previous season. \nThe top returning players for Navy are senior guard Tilman Dunbar (9.1 points per game last season, 3.3 assists), senior guard Kendall Knorr (4.2 ppg) and junior center Edward Alade (4.1 ppg, 3.4 rebounds). One of the newcomers for Navy is freshman guard Aaron Briggs, who is from Largo and played at Bullis in Montgomery County. \n\"He was in our prep school last year. We are hoping he continues to grow and improve,\" DeChellis said of Briggs. \"We have a good nucleus of freshmen coming in.\" \nThe Midshipmen begin the season at home Nov. 13 against Florida in the Veterans Classic. Navy will also face Oregon on Dec. 7, Pearl Harbor Day, in Hawaii. \n\"We have the number one team in the country coming in,\" DeChellis said of North Carolina, which will face Temple in the other game Nov. 13 in the Veterans Classic. \"The game is sold out. I can't think of a better way to kick off the season.\" \nLoyola starts the season at home Nov. 13 against Tennessee State. \nHere is a look at the 2015-16 Patriot League preseason poll, as voted on by coaches and sports information personnel, with first-place votes and total points \n1.
