Next Friday, they’ll play at first-place Burroughs.\nPasadena (4-4, 2-3) suffered its first home loss in five games.\nNelson’s first scoring plunge early in the second quarter put Crescenta Valley up 13-0. The touchdown ended a three-play, 20-yard drive gift-wrapped by the first of three takeaways by the Falcon defense.\nPasadena’s ensuing possession ended with an interception at the Bulldogs’ 37, and Nelson completed three passes for 32 yards to set up Joe Suh’s 4-yard scoring run for a 20-0 lead.\nAt that point, Crescenta Valley had run 22 plays for 151 yards (6.9 yard average) and 12 first downs.\nFollow SoCal Prep Legends on Facebook , Twitter , Instagram and SnapChat and sign up for our newsletter .\nAdvertisement", "external_links": ["http://www.twitter.com/socalpreplegend", "https://instagram.com/socalpreplegends/", "http://socalpreplegends.com/", "https://www.facebook.com/socalpreplegends", "http://socalpreplegends.com/newsletter", "http://widgets.outbrain.com/outbrain.js"], "published": "2015-10-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T13:03:01.366+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
