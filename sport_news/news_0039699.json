He led the Gulls to eight Commonwealth Coast Conference titles and nine NCAA tournament appearances. Quirk will remain at the school as an associate athletic director.\nAs a player, Quirk was a two-time All-American goalie at Springfield College and helped lead the Pride to an NCAA Division 2 championship in 1994.\nQuirk replaces John Tucker, the MLL Coach of the Year last season after leading the Cannons back to the postseason after a two-year drought. Tucker left during the offseason to become the coach and general manager of the expansion Atlanta Blaze.\nWhile the Cannons interviewed candidates from across the country, bringing in a coach with New England roots was a big factor in the decision.\n“He’s very dedicated and loyal and after speaking with him, we knew that he was the right person to keep the same focus and mentality of what we’ve built built for the last two years,” Barney said. “We also knew he was very entrenched in the lacrosse community of New England and could be that ambassador and face of the team in the community as well. At the end of the day it was an easy decision and we’re confident that he’s going to help continue our team in that direction towards bringing back the championship.”\nFrenette also has New England ties, having spent the last six years as the Celtics’ vice president of corporate sponsorships.\nIn related news, the Cannons today will release their 12-man protected list for next month’s expansion draft.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T09:35:38.434+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
