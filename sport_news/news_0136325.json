The team also announced Saturday it has picked up the fourth-year team option for guard Trey Burke and center Rudy Gobert — both in their third year. \nAll four options are for the 2016-17 season. \nThe team has committed to keeping the current young corps together. Gobert is a potential franchise player that finished second in the league in blocks. The 6-foot-6 Exum moved into the starting lineup last season as a rookie after being selected No. 5 overall. \nBurke is back in the starting lineup after Exum tore his ACL during the summer. He was the No. 9 pick of the 2013 draft. \nHood struggled with injuries as a rookie, but quickly developed into a versatile scorer and defender on the wing.
