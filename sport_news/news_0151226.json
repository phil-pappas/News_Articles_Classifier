The rugged winger was drafted by Chicago in 2004 and signed a $16 million, four-year deal after he played a crucial role in the Blackhawks' 2013 Stanley Cup title.\nLooking for more room under the salary cap, Chicago reportedly shopped Bickell around this summer, but was unable to put together a trade. Bickell's contract likely was a major stumbling block.\n\"I'm thankful,\" Bickell said. \"There's a business part of it too, where we have a lot of high-end players here that a lot of pieces are moved. Over the course of the summer, I had an opportunity to stay and they made moves to make the cap, and I just need to perform if I get an opportunity tonight to play and to prove myself. Hopefully, I can stay here.\"\nThe 29-year-old Bickell had nine goals and eight assists in the 2013 playoffs, including four points in the final three games of the NHL final against Boston. He had another solid postseason last year, but had no goals and five assists in 18 games in the 2015 playoffs.\nBickell was hampered by vertigo at the end of last season, and the symptoms lingered into the summer.\n\"I'm feeling good,\" he said. \"Every day's getting better. Every week. I just need to get up there and prove myself. It's all in my hands now.\"\nBickell said he was a little shocked when he was placed on waivers on Friday. But he planned to use the move as motivation.\n\"Really show that I really want to be here and I don't want to leave,\" he said, \"and you know play like I used to play and be a physical presence on the ice, and with this team that's what I think we need and I need to bring it every night.\"\nAlso Saturday, the Blackhawks assigned goaltender Michael Leighton to the IceHogs. The move lowers Chicago's active roster to 13 forwards, nine defensemen and two goalies.\n___\nJay Cohen can be reached at http://www.twitter.com/jcohenap", "external_links": ["http://www.twitter.com/jcohenap"], "published": "2015-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T00:30:53.663+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
