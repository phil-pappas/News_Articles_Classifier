Freshman Kaydan Johnson turned in the top time for the Lady Tigers, placing fourth in the girls Class 5A varsity race in a time of 21 minutes, 14 seconds. Sophomore Destini Sampson was seventh in 21:20. Junior Caitlin Bart was 21st in 22:19. “That was a good race for them,” Ardmore coach Steve Wright said. “They’re starting to coming around at the right time of the year. They got out like they needed to and ran good in the middle of race and at the end of the race. Their conditioning is coming around. We have three weeks until regionals. Everything is looking pretty good.” Sophomore Yurisia Garcia completed the course in a time of 23:35, good for 49th. Freshmen Katelyn Shelley and Breanna Martinez placed 90th and 104th, respectively, in 25:49 and 27:07. Senior Chris Garcia was the top performer for the Ardmore boys, placing 13th in a time of 17:44. Sophomores Nick Wilson and Jose Dominguez finished 110th and 117th, respectively, in 21:37 and 22:04. “He (Garcia) came back more like I expected him to run,” Wright said. “I think he’s probably going to run better by regionals. He has a couple of weeks more to condition. He’s a senior and wants to do better than last year. I think that he will work hard and do the best that he can.” Ardmore will run closer to home Saturday when it makes the short drive to Madill, where it will participate in the Reuel Little. The first race starts at 8 a.m. “It’s a fun race,” Wright said. “They feed us pancakes and breakfast after we race. It is a nice break of the competition of running against the other schools. We will use it for a workout. It’s a good chance of pace.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T16:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T22:02:47.029+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
