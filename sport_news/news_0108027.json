Comment Posted Oct. 17, 2015 at 1:48 AM By Mike Mendez Posted Oct. 17, 2015 at 1:48 AM NICKERSON — It was a tough start to districts for Smoky Valley, losing to Nickerson 28-0. Big plays in the first half helped the Panthers open up a lead. In the first quarter, Nickerson sophomore Payton Kuhns opened the scoring in a big way, ripping a 67-yard touchdown run to put the Panthers up 6-0 with 4 minutes left in the first quarter. Nickerson wasn’t done finding the end zone from its own side of the 50. Just 10 seconds into the second quarter, quarterback Wyatt Henson hit Braden Stewart for a 66-yard touchdown pass to give the Panthers a 14-0 lead with two touchdown plays over 65 yards. Jordon Lehman added another score on a dramatic play with an interception return for a touchdown to make it a 20-0 Nickerson lead at the half. Late in the third quarter, Austin O’Toole had a 22-yard touchdown run for the Panthers to cap the scoring at 28-0. Allan Wampler had a big day on the ground for Smoky Valley, getting 24 carries for 88 yards. Riley Odell picked up 59 yards rushing on 19 carries. Brett Heitschmidt completed 7 of his 18 passes, for 97 yards through the air for the Vikings. Defensively, Odell led the way with 9 tackles. Smoky Valley moves to 2-5 on the season after losing to Nickerson. The Vikings will have a chance to rebound in the district next week, when the Vikings host Wamego at Bethany College. It will not be an easy test. Wamego opened the district with a 34-0 win over Chapman. Contact Mike Mendez at mmendez@mcphersonsentinel.com and follow him on Twitter @MendezSentinel.
