Kennedy football coach Andrew Maurizio, who guided the Mustangs to consecutive playoff berths for the first time in school history, has resigned, according to Sean Daly, the high school’s athletics director. \nDaly said Maurizio stepped down of his own accord and would have no further comment on the coach’s resignation, citing a personnel matter. \n“He’s been a great coach for Kennedy football,” Daly said of Maurizio, who graduated in 2002 from the high school, where he was the team’s quarterback and safety. “He bleeds green and loves the kids. We wish him the best of luck in his future endeavors.” \nA text message left for Maurizio was not immediately returned. Daly said Maurizio will remain a physical education teacher in the Woodbridge Township Public Schools district, but will be transferred from the high school to a different building. \nFreshman coach Tom McFadden has been promoted to interim head coach and will lead the Mustangs (0-5) into their next game at Monmouth Regional on Saturday. \nDaly said J.F. Kennedy Principal Mike Cilento met with the Mustangs on Monday afternoon to inform them Maurizio resigned. \n“Obviously they were upset,” Daly said, noting he “saw the impact (Maurizio) had on the kids.” \nMaurizio exits with a 12-15 career record. The Mustangs are in the midst of a six-game losing streak dating back to last season during which they have been outscored 203-71, or by an average of 22 points. \nGraduation decimated J.F. Kennedy, which has struggled to overcome the loss of two of its three biggest playmakers, Terrence Young and Stepp Oziegbe, who combined for 980 receiving yards last season. \nThree-year starting quarterback Andrew Roberts entered last weekend’s game against Bishop Ahr having passed for 297 yards and rushed for 171 more, accounting for 77 percent of his team’s offense. \nMaurizio took over the program in 2013, inheriting a 2-7 team.The Mustangs made the playoffs in his first season and made a second consecutive postseason appearance for the first time in school history last year. \nJ.F. Kennedy’s 7-4 record a year ago marked the school’s first winning record since 2004, when the Mustangs finished 7-3. \nMaurizio served as an assistant coach at Newark West Side for two years before returning to his college alma mater, Montclair State University, where he was the tight ends coach and strength and conditioning coordinator for four seasons. \n7 CONNECT 35 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://mycj.co/1RExzRF TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T04:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T13:42:21.524+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
