Sports’ Pat Forde predicts big things already for the Michigan football team this season. \nAnd, as a result, bad news for its biggest rivals. \nIn his weekly “Forde-Yard Dash” published Tuesday morning , Forde predicts the “expiration date” for the remaining unbeatens in college football. That includes Michigan’s opponent Saturday, Northwestern, as well as its two biggest rivals in Michigan State and Ohio State (in no particular order, of course). \nAll three, Forde says, will meet an untimely fate against coach Jim Harbaugh and his Wolverines, who he has in his list of one-loss teams that can still contend for a playoff spot. \n“The Wolverines have allowed 14 points in the last four games,” Forde wrote, “and if they win what could be a three-and-out-a-thon against Northwestern on Saturday, they will likely come into Oct. 17 against Michigan State playing better than the Spartans. Win that game, and Michigan State will taste a defeat most bitter at a time when it assumed it had the upper hand in the state. \n“Keep winning from there, and Harbaugh-Urban I could be the stuff of legend. The Michigan man-crush hero worship already in full effect over Harbaugh would reach screaming-teenage-girls-over-One-Direction levels. It would rival the Saban idolatry in Alabama, perhaps even exceed it. \n“Hey, it’s a lot less crazy a scenario now than it was a month ago.” \nForde ranked the 20 unbeatens in terms of “undefeated shelf life” from shortest (Northwestern) to longest (Ohio State). Michigan State checks in at No. 8 on Forde’s list. \n“There has been no domination from the Spartans,” Forde wrote. “They beat Western Michigan by 13; Georgia Southern beat Western Michigan by 26. They beat Oregon by three; Utah beat Oregon by 42. They beat Air Force by 14; Navy beat Air Force by 22. They beat Purdue by three; Virginia Tech beat Purdue by 27. Comparative scores suggest that there simply hasn’t been much to justify the high poll ranking. \n“If (Michigan defeating Michigan State) comes to pass, the Mitten may lose its mind,” Forde continued. “But which team is playing better football at the moment? The Wolverines.” 2 CONNECT 25 TWEET LINKEDIN 4 COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://detne.ws/1Rstkss TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T20:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T23:07:05.199+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
