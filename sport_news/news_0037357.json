Manziel was pulled over at around 6 p.m. that day on I-90.\nAccording to the report, Manziel was pulled over after a witness told police Manziel used the shoulder to pass her vehicle at a high rate of speed. The witness said Manziel and girlfriend Colleen Crowley were arguing and that Crowley threw a wallet out the window of Manziel's vehicle.\nManziel was stopped in Avon, Ohio. Crowley reportedly told police Manziel pushed her head into the window and that she had an abrasion on her arm from where Manziel attempted to keep her from exiting the vehicle.\nThough Manziel admitted to drinking, police did not believe he was intoxicated and thus did not charge him with driving under the influence. Crowley declined to press charges.\nManziel, in his second season in the NFL, spent part of the offseason in rehab for alcohol abuse.\nManziel tweeted about the incident late Friday:\nColleen and I got into a dumb public argument on the way home Monday afternoon. It probably looked more interesting than it was and...\n— Johnny Manziel (@JManziel2) October 16, 2015\nI know I would stop and check if I saw a couple arguing on the side of the road. It was embarrassing but not serious...\n— Johnny Manziel (@JManziel2) October 16, 2015\nand when we talked to the police and they realized everything was alright and I was sober, we went home together and everything is fine.\n— Johnny Manziel (@JManziel2) October 16, 2015\nHe also tweeted out a statement from Crowley:\npic.twitter.com/qFpIRi3rhg\n— Johnny Manziel (@JManziel2) October 17, 2015", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/JManziel2/status/655179745919897600", "https://twitter.com/JManziel2/status/655166174418870272", "http://t.co/qFpIRi3rhg", "https://twitter.com/JManziel2/status/655165925822480384", "https://twitter.com/JManziel2/status/655166124254994436", "http://www.newsnet5.com/sports/police-report-johnny-manziel-pulled-over-during-domestic-argument-admits-to-drinking"], "published": "2015-10-17T08:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T06:16:43.246+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
