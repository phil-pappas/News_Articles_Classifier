Mail Today | New Delhi, October 5, 2015 | UPDATED 23:56 IST Mail A+ A- Coe envisages better testing measures and awareness programmes for youth to fight the menace. (Reuters Photo) \nTwo-time Olympic gold medallist Sebastian Coe has taken over the reins of the world athletics body at a time when the sport has drawn negative publicity after allegations of mass doping around the world. \nIn this backdrop, Coe has called for a more independent dope testing system. He envisages better testing measures and awareness programmes for youth to fight the menace. \"We need to introduce more independence into our testing system. The gap between a sample that returns positive and the sanction is often too long. So I think we can introduce faster systems. Relieving IAAF member federations of some of the testing procedures and allowing more international testing of more independent nature will make a difference,\" Coe said in the Capital on Monday, on his first visit to India after becoming IAAF chief. \nSpeaking about his plans for anti-dope awareness, the Briton said, \"I am creating a Values Commission in November that will be specifically aimed at helping young people understand the values of our sport. It's important to actually allow athletes from the age of 15-16 onwards to really understand why it is important to do sport with integrity and in a clean way.\" \nMedia had reported recently that 12,000 blood samples collected between 2001 and 2012 showed an extraordinary extent of doping. At the IAAF World Championships in Beijing in August, two cases of doping were reported. \n\"Since 2003 we have conducted 19,000 tests. We have to be very careful before giving a verdict on a dope offender. There are anti-doping protocols involved. The athletes' careers are at stake. The federation's reputation is at stake. You cannot make errors. But I would prefer dope cheats to get caught to think about complications involved in handling their cases,\" he said. \nCoe, a 1,500m gold medallist at the 1980 and 1984 Olympics, is on a two-day visit to India, and he attended the Athletics Federation of India's executive committee meeting in the Capital on Monday. \nOn Tuesday, he will hold a meeting with sports minister Sarbananda Sonowal and Sports Authority of India secretary general Injeti Srinivas to discuss India's future plan in athletics. \nDespite having a world-class facility at the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium in New Delhi and a plethora of sponsors willing to back sports events, India isn't able to hold any of the Asian or world-level athletics event. \nCoe has a word of advice for the AFI. \n\"The proposed Indian Diamond League seems an interesting thing and I will discuss it with the AFI officials tomorrow. India has sponsors and so many big multinational companies. You need to engage with them. Athletics should be popularised by having more competitions at the domestic level, to get media involved, and engage with youth through social media.\" \nAsked about how India can learn from the success of Kenyan and Jamaican athletes who have made a phenomenal rise in the last decade, Coe says a strong school-structure should be in place. \n\"Jamaica and Kenya are winning medals at Olympics and world meets because they have strong school-level programmes. The records that Usain Bolt created at youth meets in Jamaica are being broken by upcoming athletes. \n\"Recently, I was in Jamaica to attend an inter-school meet and a crowd of 50,000 people came to watch it. It was because athletes are world-class. It will be possible only if countries introduce athletics in the school curriculum.\" For more news from India Today, follow us on Twitter @indiatoday and on Facebook at facebook.com/IndiaToday For news and videos in Hindi, go to AajTak.in . ताज़ातरीन ख़बरों और वीडियो के लिए आजतक.इन पर आएं.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T21:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T22:45:18.180+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
