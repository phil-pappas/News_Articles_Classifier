Gary McAllister is also due to relinquish his current post as first-team coach but will remain at Anfield in an ambassadorial role following the decision to sack Brendan Rodgers after three-and-a-half years in charge. \n\"Liverpool Football Club can confirm Sean O'Driscoll, Gary McAllister, Glen Driscoll and Chris Davies have left their respective first-team roles at the club,\" the Reds confirmed in an official statement on 8 October. \"The club would like to place on record its thanks to all four men for the professionalism, commitment and dedication they have displayed during their time here, and the positive impact they have had in helping to support football operations and the team. \n\"McAllister will remain with the club, albeit in a different role, not connected to first-team duties. The Scot has accepted an ambassadorial position, which will allow the club to benefit from his strong connection and affinity with the supporters. The club would also like to take this opportunity to wish Sean, Glen and Chris every success in the future.\" \nAlthough Klopp is yet to be officially unveiled as Liverpool's new manager, he was clearly the number one target to replace Rodgers from the outset and widespread reports have suggested the charismatic German has now agreed terms on a three-year deal and will put pen to paper upon his arrival in England this evening (8 October). The club have called a press conference for 10am on 9 October in order to make a \"major announcement\". #LFC confirm a press conference will be held 10am on Friday for a major club announcement http://t.co/Q5KynqtFKC pic.twitter.com/jn0eBwWntx â€” Liverpool FC (@LFC) October 8, 2015 Twitter/@LFC \nFormer Nottingham Forest and England U19 manager O'Driscoll only joined Liverpool in July as a replacement for Colin Pascoe after the latter was dismissed alongside first-team coach Mike Marsh during the summer as part of Rodgers's attempts to appease owners Fenway Sports Group (FSG) and find a solution to his side's underwhelming 2014-15 season, which culminated in a 6-1 defeat to Stoke in May. \nKlopp, generally regarded as one of European football's most popular and charismatic managers following his successful seven-year stint in charge at Borussia Dortmund, is expected to draft in his own staff over the coming weeks. Zeljko Buvac and Peter Krawietz are both expected to move to Merseyside having worked with the highly rated 48-year-old during his time at Mainz and Signal Iduna Park.
