(AP) - State transportation officials say Interstate 90's westbound lanes have reopened but two of the three eastbound lanes are closed as crews make repairs to a bridge.\nDepartment of Transportation officials say two of I-90's three westbound lanes between Exit 6A in Rensselaer County and Exit 6 in Albany reopened after being shut down for several hours Friday morning as crews worked on the bridge over Broadway in Albany. The work site is about 500 feet west of the Patron Island Bridge that carries the highway over the Hudson River.\nDOT says two of the three eastbound lanes are now closed as the work continues. The repairs are expected to be completed by the evening rush hour.\nThe bridge is located near where I-90 connects with Interstate 787, a major commuter route for state employees heading to work in downtown Albany.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
