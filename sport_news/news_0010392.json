The uniforms feature silver panels with silver, black and white trim and the accompanying shorts also include the Spur logo on each side.\nThe Spurs will debut the new uniforms at the home opener vs. the Brooklyn Nets on Oct. 30 and will be worn multiple times this season. The Black Signature Spur uniforms will join the lineup of traditional home white and away black uniforms, along with the camouflage military and silver alternate versions. The Spurs debuted the silver version of the Signature Spur uniforms in 2012 and they were the first-ever NBA jersey logo without any writing or peripheral design.\nThe Spur logo has featured on jerseys in the past, notably the \"Los Spurs\" version used during the NBA's \"Latin Nights\" program, but it features far more prominently in this \"Black Signature Spur\" design.\nThe new jerseys join an ever-expanding roster of alternates that have become increasingly popular across the sports world due to their high marketability and ability to push merchandise sales.\nClick through the above slides to see Manu Ginobili and Patty Mills show off the new look.\nnmoyle@express-news.net\nTwitter: @NRMoyle", "external_links":
