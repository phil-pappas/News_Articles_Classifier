They reached 90 wins for the first time in nine years and snapped a five-game losing streak that cost them home-field advantage in the upcoming Division Series against the Dodgers.\nNext up, deGrom starts Game 1 in the best-of-five matchup Friday at Los Angeles.\nBOX SCORE: METS 1, NATIONALS 0\nSeven pitchers combined to hold Washington to two hits - the first was Clint Robinson's two-out single in the seventh inning off reliever Jonathon Niese.\nBryce Harper hustled for a two-out double in the ninth to finish 1 for 4, but that wasn't enough to beat out Miami speedster Dee Gordon for the National League batting crown.\nGordon went 3 for 4 in Philadelphia and finished with a .333 average to Harper's .330. The favorite for NL MVP, Harper began the day ahead by the slimmest of margins - .330754 to .330606.\nThe slugger also ended his sensational season with 42 homers and 99 RBIs.\nJeurys Familia retired Jayson Werth on a fly to center for his 43rd save, equaling the franchise record set by Armando Benitez in 2001.\nWith the Mets gearing up for their first postseason appearance since 2006, deGrom was pulled after throwing 72 pitches in four innings. He struck out four of his first five batters and finished with seven strikeouts.\nBartolo Colon and Logan Verrett each tossed a hitless inning of relief before Niese entered in the seventh. With two outs, Robinson sent a sharp two-hopper up the middle that went between Niese's legs and caromed off the shin of shortstop Ruben Tejada as he tried to make a sliding stop.\nThe ball ricocheted into right field, and official scorer Jordan Sprechman ruled it a hit almost immediately.\nTyler Clippard (4-1) struck out two in a perfect eighth. Moments later, Granderson launched a drive to center off Blake Treinen (2-5) for his 26th homer of the season and third hit of the game.\nIt snapped New York's scoreless stretch of 18 innings and marked the team's second run in a span of 43 innings.\nFollowing the final out, Mets players came back onto the field to salute a crowd of 41,631 that pushed New York's season attendance to 2,569,753 - the highest since the club drew more than 3 million during Citi Field's inaugural season in 2009.\nWith the NL East championship banner flying above the ballpark and flapping in the wind, captain David Wright grabbed a microphone and thanked fans for their support.\nFor the Nationals, heavily favored to win the division and - by some - even the World Series way back in spring training, it was a fitting end to a tumultuous and disappointing season.\nKey players such as pitcher Jordan Zimmermann and shortstop Ian Desmond can become free agents, and it might have been the last game with Washington for embattled manager Matt Williams.\nAmid speculation Williams is likely to be fired, general manager Mike Rizzo said a decision about Williams' future with the team will be made soon.\n< PREVIOUS SLIDE SLIDE 1 of 10 NEXT SLIDE > Washington Nationals starting pitcher Tanner Roark delivers in the second inning of a baseball game against the New York Mets in New York, Sunday, Oct. 4, 2015.
