We always respect our opponents but we were never scared and never thought we couldn't make it.\"\nOlympiakos led 1-0, 2-1 and finally 3-2 in the game at The Emirates which condemned Arsenal to bottom place in the group with no points from their opening two matches.\nSilva noted that Arsenal made his team work for the victory.\n\"Whichever team comes here to win needs to know how to suffer, to put up with the pressure, and I think that was one of the key features here today,\" he said.\n\"We ran a lot and resisted when Arsenal tried to tire us, we were very well organised defensively and had very quick responses to Arsenal's goals which was very important.\"\nHe also said they were aiming to go further than last season when they finished third in their group.\n\"We can't set limits, we are here and our duty is to improve every day. We know that there are a lot of differences between our team and others like Bayern (Munich) and Arsenal.\n\"Our budget is much smaller than theirs but we can't set a limit to what we want to achieve and how hard we work.\n\"These kids believed they could take a win in this stadium and worked really hard for it.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T17:28:54.915+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
