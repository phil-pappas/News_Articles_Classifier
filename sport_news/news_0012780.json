Last season’s over.”\nThe two were preparing themselves for a wide range of questions about the season ahead, including anticipating reporters asking both about their ankle injuries — Neal redshirted last season after suffering a high ankle sprain in the third game and Logwood had surgery two months ago to remove a bone spur.\n“They keep asking (Neal) about his, but not me,” Logwood said with a smile. “I don’t know if they even know about it. I hope not, anyway.”\nLobos coach Craig Neal said past preseason media events he attended always focused on the season ahead, but not this one.\n“They’ve all been asking about it,” Craig Neal said of his team’s 15-16 record and eighth place finish to the 2014-15 season. “But it’s one of those things. We never expected that — what happened last year. The thing is, we’ve been very lucky over the last nine years not to have injuries and last year, we had them and we ended up having the season we had. So people want to try and figure out why.”\nVIVA LAS VEGAS : Annual griping about the unfairness of the MWC tournament being played in the Thomas & Mack Center, home of regular-season games for the UNLV Runnin’ Rebels, aren’t likely going anywhere anytime soon, despite the league’s contract with the venue being up after this season’s 2016 tourney.\nMWC commissioner Craig Thompson said the current arrangement to play it at the T&M, which is undergoing a $73 million renovation expected to be completed this month, comes with hotel rooms for 22 league teams and “a figure in the low seven figures” being given to the league for rent of the facility being paid by the Las Vegas Convention & Visitors Authority. That money would go away if played at any venue tied in with a casino.\n“I’ve asked (the school presidents and athletic directors), what is your price for neutrality?” said Thompson, who also pointed out statistics don’t actually show the Rebels have had much of a home-court advantage at all in the tournament.\nFor now, the MWC is awaiting a decision from the Pac-12 on whether it will play future conference tournaments at the MGM Grand Garden Arena or at the still-being-built Las Vegas Arena. When that decision is made, the MWC will explore the final costs of playing their tournament at the other venue and hope to have a final decision for 2017 tournaments and beyond by March.\nUNDER PRESSURE : This certainly isn’t the first time UNLV’s Dave Rice has entered the season on the coaching hot seat due to his team’s performance not being on par with high-level recruiting and expectations.\n“Pressure is a privilege,” said Rice, explaining he’d much rather be under constant scrutiny of a fan base with high expectations than coaching at a program stricken by fan apathy.\nBEST DRESSED? Maybe it was his way of getting back at his dad for a comment two weeks ago to Albuquerque media in which Craig Neal suggested Lobo freshman Anthony Mathis “might” be the best shooter on the team rather than Neal’s son Cullen.\nAsked by ROOT Sports who the best-dressed head coach in the league was, Cullen first said his dad, but added if the question was for all coaches, he “might” have to go with former UNM assistant and current UNLV assistant Ryan Miller.\n“He’s got some style,” Cullen Neal said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T04:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T07:38:59.537+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
