It was Kitwara’s second consecutive finish as the runner-up in Chicago.\nThe runners were slowed down by headwinds late in the race, but Chumba was able to pull away, then had the wind at his back at the end.\n“I tried to push,” he said, but the wind first held him back. “It was a problem.”\nKitwara couldn’t close the gap.\n“My legs were not moving anymore at times,” he said.\nSammy Ndungu finished third, giving Kenyans a sweep of the podium.\nKiplagat, who holds the world record in the half-marathon, beat the Ethiopian Yebrgual Melese by 10 seconds. Birhane Dibaba of Ethiopia was third.\nKiplagat, who finished third in Chicago last year, briefly lay on the asphalt after finishing, then rose with a bright smile and jumped in celebration.\n“I love my kids, and I told them when I win, I’ll jump,” said Kiplagat, who has two daughters. “It’s been a long time since I’ve been in Position No. 1.”\nKiplagat’s last marathon win was in Berlin in 2013.\nJoan Benoit Samuelson, who had been set to commemorate the 30th anniversary of a record-setting Chicago run, was a late scratch because of illness. She had hoped to finish within 30 minutes of her 1985 time of 2:21:21.\nForty-two-year-old Deena Kastor, the 2004 Olympic bronze medalist and the 2005 Chicago champion, led parts of the race before finishing seventh, in 2:27:47, as the top U.S. woman.\nLuke Puskedra was the top American man, with a fifth-place finish in 2:10:24.\nSunday’s race was the first without pacesetters, which officials said would result in a more competitive but slower event with record-breaking performances less likely.\nThe men’s and women’s champions each won $100,000.\nThe Australian Kurt Fearnley won his fifth Chicago men’s wheelchair title, his first since 2011. The American Tatyana McFadden captured her fifth straight women’s wheelchair championship and sixth over all.\n ", "external_links": ["http://a1.nyt.com/assets/article/20151008-165249/images/foundation/logos/"], "published": "2015-10-12T04:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T03:59:50.474+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
