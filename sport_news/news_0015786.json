Hence the adjective: Evil.\nOK, I’m probably cooking the books a little to put it out there that Bautista “revealed his satisfaction.” The truth is that he did a bit more than that. You know how some guys stop to admire their home runs? You know how some guys flip their bat? Jose Bautista did both, with the bat flip going into the books as a) demonstrative, b) memorable and c) painful-looking.\nGo down the cellar and grab that old Louisville Slugger from your days with the Avi Nelson Club in the Boston Park League. Try flipping the bat as Bautista did. If you don’t sprain a wrist or fracture an ulna, you’ll be OK to high-five your buddies come Sunday night when Tom Brady and the Patriots are running it up against those dime-dropping Indianapolis Colts.\nBautista’s bat flip was awesome. And it perfectly expressed the emotions, the mood and the vibe of what was happening at Rogers Centre. It was in the top of that inning, remember, that the Rangers took a 3-2 lead on one of the strangest plays you’ll ever see: With Rougned Odor on third, Shin-Soo Choo watched an offering from Jays pitcher Aaron Sanchez sail across the plate for a ball and then fidgeted about and extended his arms in preparation for the next pitch, as hitters will do. But that’s when catcher Russell Martin’s return throw to the pitcher managed to deflect off Choo’s bat and roll away, allowing Odor to scamper home with the go-ahead run.\nIt took plenty of discussion for the umpiring crew to get the call right, but it did get it right. Yet the Blue Jays were livid, and, well, why not: They were now staring at the possibility that they were going to lose, and that their magical season was going to end, right here, because of a freak play. (Toronto headline writers would have had a field day: “Odor at Home Plate a Rotten Way for Jays to Lose.”)\nAll this became moot in the bottom of the seventh when the Blue Jays put it away with four runs, thanks to a horrible collapse by the Texas defense, and, yes, Bautista’s three-run homer off reliever Sam Dyson.\nFor the Blue Jays, this was not a sad, solemn occasion. As such, Bautista was not obligated to circle the bases head-down, arms at his side, as though ashamed at what he’d done. No. It was a happ y occasion. Moreover, the home run was a statement: WE ARE NOT GOING TO ROLL OVER AND CRY BECAUSE OF A FREAK CALL.\nHe watched, he styled. Man, did he ever. But he could have done a moonwalk and it would have been OK. He could have stopped at second base to recite a limerick about that woman from Nantucket. He could have slid into the plate while doing an imitation of Little Richard singing “Kansas City.” (Site of tonight’s Game 1 of the ALCS.)\nUnder the circumstances, and at this time of year, and in this day and age, pretty much anything is acceptable.\nUnless you happen to be Sam Dyson, the pitcher who served up Bautista’s home run. Now here’s a guy who had a fine season for the Rangers — a 1.15 ERA in 31 relief outings after being acquired from the Miami Marlins on July 31. And he’s probably a fine person with lots to give back to the game, but, geez, what about this: After Bautista’s Vegas floor show (Home runs! Bat-flipping!) he felt the need to lodge a complaint with Jays DH Edwin Encarnacion.\nThat’s right, folks: He squawked to the next batter about the previous batter’s stylin’.\n“I told him Jose needs to calm that down,” Dyson told reporters after the game. “Just kind of respect the game a little more.”\nAnd so I ask you: What disrespected the game more, Bautista’s stylin’ or Dyson’s taking a moment to lecture Encarnacion about said stylin’?\nBut, hey, no problem with Dyson: He was just displaying human emotions.\nWhich is exactly what Bautista was doing.\nWe need more of it.\nIn October, it should be mandatory.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T19:06:05.499+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
