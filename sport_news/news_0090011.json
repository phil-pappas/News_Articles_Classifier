(Mark Weber/The Commercial Appeal) In an otherwise even match, it only took a couple of minutes for St. George's to see its shot at the Division 2-A West Regional soccer championship evaporate.\nVisiting University School of Jackson scored twice early in the second half and went on to defeat the Gryphons 3-1 on Tuesday at St. George's. Thanks to their runner-up finish, St. George's will host Franklin Road Academy on Saturday for a chance to go to next week's state tournament in Murfreesboro.\n\"They're a good match-up for us,\" said Gryphons coach Tony Whicker. \"They possess the ball well; they're smart and organized, and they counter what we do.\"\nAddison Dunn put the visitors ahead 1-0 late in the first half before freshman Ann Wallace Scott tied it just before intermission. The Bruins then struck for two goals early in the second half to put it away.\nDunn got the first one off a nice cross from Holeh Heydari before Abbey Fleming clinched it with a beautifully struck free kick.\n\"That free kick was the icing on the cake,\" Whicker said.\nIn the third-place match, ECS overcame a slow start before defeating St. Mary's 2-1. The Eagles travel to face Knoxville Webb on Saturday with the Turkeys visiting Battle Ground Academy.\nECS lost in a thrilling penalty shootout against St. George's in the semifinals last week, and Eagles star Molly Martin said that loss was still weighing on her team.\n\"That just ate us alive inside,\" she said of the loss. \"And I think we were overconfident because we beat (St. Mary's) 4-0 the first time we played.\"\nEllie McGhee gave the Turkeys a 1-0 first-half lead before Martin's near-immediate equalizer tied it up. Maddie Stolnicki then scored the winner for ECS early in the second half.\n\"It's the kind of game where you warn and warn and warn and warn them,\" said ECS coach Jordan Thompson. \"It's frustrating as a coach and as a former player. I think bottom line we didn't respect St. Mary's, and we should have because they're a good team.\"\nIN OTHER GAMES\nRegion 8-AAA: Houston and Collierville will meet for the title Wednesday at 7 p.m. at Houston Middle after victories on Tuesday.
