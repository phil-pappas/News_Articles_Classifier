(AP Photo/Alvaro Barrientos) more > By TALES AZZONI -   \nMADRID (AP) - Spain will defend its European Championship title next year, while Switzerland will return to the tournament for the first time since co-hosting it eight years earlier. \nSpain secured its Euro 2016 spot by easily defeating Luxembourg 4-0 at home, while Switzerland trounced San Marino 7-0 to clinch its berth for the tournament in France. \nSwitzerland missed the 2012 European Championship after co-hosting the tournament with Austria in 2008. \nAlso Friday, already qualified England beat Estonia 2-0 to win for the ninth time in as many qualifying games. \nHere’s a look at the Euro 2016 qualifiers on Friday: \n___ \nGROUP C \nSanti Cazorla and substitute Paco Alcacer scored two goals each to help Spain beat Luxembourg 4-0 and secure its spot in next year’s European Championship. \nCazorla scored in the 42nd and 85th minutes, while Alcacer netted in the 67th and 80th to give Spain 24 points in Group C, five more than Slovakia and Ukraine. Slovakia lost 1-0 at home to Belarus, while Ukraine defeated Macedonia 2-0. \n“It’s great to finally advance, but we know it wasn’t easy,” Spain coach Vicente Del Bosque said. “The loss to Slovakia (last year) made things harder for us.” \nIn the final round, Ukraine hosts Spain, which will be looking for a third consecutive European title in France next year, and Slovakia plays at Luxembourg. \nSpain came into Friday’s home match with a depleted squad because of injuries and suspensions, and it only got worse after David Silva had to be substituted early on with an apparent ankle injury. Also in the first half, Alvaro Morata had to leave on a stretcher because of a right leg injury. \n___ \nGROUP E \nSwitzerland will return to the European Championship for the first time since it co-hosted the tournament eight years earlier after thrashing San Marino 7-0 with seven different scorers.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T01:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T03:07:53.761+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
