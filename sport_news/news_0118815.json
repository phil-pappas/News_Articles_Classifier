The Raiders - ranked No. 12 in 2A - trailed only the 25-point outing by a Gilbert team rated No. 2 in 3A and a 36-point performance from a North Polk squad ranked 10th in 2A. \nHeather Jessen led the all-HOIC pack of CMB runners with an eighth-place 5-kilometer time of 22 minutes, 2.90 seconds. Jessen said good experience running on the ISU course helped her overcome strong winds to turn in a strong time. \n“I knew what was coming,” Jessen said. “Then I just used the wind when it was at my back to surge a little bit.” \nFreshmen Brenna Thomson and Shasta Moody were CMB’s other all-HOIC runners. Thomson placed 12th in 22:18.59 and Moody was a step back with a 13th-place time of 22:19.45. \nAnother freshman - Lauren Ratliff - battled through shin splints to place 23rd for CMB with a 22:57.44 showing. Jessen - a junior - said she enjoys having such a strong freshman class to run with. \n“I like that they’re there to push me,” Jessen said. “I know when I graduate, they’ll still have a great team afterwards.” \nWinter Brown - Jessen’s running mate at the head of the CMB pack last year - returned from injury to run her first varsity meet of the season. She placed 43rd in 24:50.85. \n“She was my partner last year,” Jessen said. “I’m excited she’s back on the course.” \nAnna Jones was the other varsity competitor at the HOIC meet for the CMB girls. Jones took 50th in 25:29.58. \n“Our girls ran a competitive race tonight,” CMB head coach Jerry Meinerts said. “Three of our girls made all-conference in a tough conference, so I am really proud of those three. Lauren (Ratliff) didn’t have her ‘A’ game tonight. You could tell she wasn’t quite herself.” \n“It will be nice having a week and a half before our (state qualifying) meet,” Meinerts added, “so we can get over some of these nagging injuries.” \nGilbert’s Carly Rahn, Maggie Pollard and Emily Branson took first, second and third individually in the girls’ race with respective times of 20:46.70, 20:56.31 and 21:09.09. Seven Tiger and six North Polk runners placed in the top 20 individually. \nIn the boys’ race, CMB took sixth out of nine teams with 155 points. \nA Gilbert team rated 10th in 3A won the boys’ race with 30 points. North Polk took second with 83 points and Nevada and South Hamilton both scored 91 points to place third and fourth respectively. \n“Sometimes it’s tough to get motivated, knowing that you don’t really have a chance to win the meet,” Meinerts said. “But I thought our guys did a great job motivating themselves to run hard and continue improving. Even with the 30-plus mile-an-hour wind gusts, all of our guys were anywhere from 1.5 to two minutes faster than our first meet of the year on the ISU course.” \nIan Thomson continued his outstanding freshman season by earning all-HOIC honors for the CMB boys. Thomson ran a 5-kilometer time of 18:09.95 to place 12th. \n“I was very happy,” Thomson said. “I didn’t expect to come in 12th at all.” \n“He ran a great time on a great course, and without the wind would’ve been in the 17s easy,” Meinerts added. “Ian ran a great race against some great runners.” \nMax Van Maanen took 25th in 19:09.90 as the second runner for the CMB boys. Carter Fricke came in 34th at 19:25.37, Eric Wagner took 62nd in 21:25.50 and Josh Bruntz was the final runner to earn points for the Raiders with a 65th-place time of 21:33.52. \nBrady Ross and Noah Rhoades also ran varsity for the CMB boys. Ross came in 84th at 22:30.13 and Rhoades clocked in at 22:52.31 to place 92nd. \nGilbert’s Jason Taylor won a competitive battle for the boys’ individual title with a time of 17:44.16. Nevada’s Malachi Hornbuckle took second in 17:47.82, Gilbert’s Owen Whitham placed third in 17:49.25, North Polk’s Austin Smith took fourth in 17:59.52 and Gilbert’s John Ockey ended up fifth in 17:50.02. \nFinal team scores \nGirls: 1.

Gilbert - the No. 2 team in 3A - easily won the meet with 29 points. \n“Every one of our girls ran their season-best times today,” CMB head coach Jerry Meinerts said. “Gilbert is a great team and I really challenged our girls to get our pack right in with their number three and four girls. That is right where they ran. Our goal now is to keep everyone healthy and just keep working hard and improving for the (state qualifying) meet coming up soon.” \nBrenna Thomson and Heather Jessen both placed in the top 10 and Shasta Moody finished just outside it for the CMB girls individually. \nThomson completed the 5-kilometer course in 21 minutes, 18 seconds to place eighth.

Gilbert won with 62 points, Eagle Grove took second with 95 points and East Marshall scored 131 points to edge Madrid’s score of 136 for third. \n“Most of our boys ran their best times of the season, but as you can see from the results, so did everyone else,” Meinerts said. “This was a tough meet, just loaded with a bunch of good runners and good teams.” \nIan Thomson ran the fastest 5-kilometer time for the CMB boys.
