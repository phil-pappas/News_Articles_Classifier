So, (you) gotta ask Doc.”\nSometimes, the tweets were more vague.\nCrawford tweeted “Actions speak louder than words” on the morning the core of the team was in Houston to meet with free agent DeAndre Jordan. Crawford wasn’t at the meeting.\nHe wasn’t happy. He was venting. And, Rivers let him be.\nFor a while.\n“Some guys,” Rivers said, “you do reach out to.”\nThe two men eventually spoke over the summer, and had another conversation shortly before the opening of training camp, an important conversation that solidified things between the two.\nCrawford saw the vision. He saw his place on the team. And, he bought in.\nBut, it took some selling.\nOver the offseason, the Clippers added Lance Stephenson and Josh Smith. They re-signed Austin Rivers. And, with the addition of Paul Pierce, there was a chance the new Clippers bench would have a lot of people who would want the ball in their hands.\n1 2 3 Next Page", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T01:11:00.343+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
