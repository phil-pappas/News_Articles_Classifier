With a time-shifted story that caught us up on what happened since the Season 5 finale, and a terrifying plot twist that led to a cliffhanger that may be the scariest in the show's history, \"The Walking Dead\" season premiere was bold, confident, compelling, gory and a sign that showrunner Scott Gimple is in full command.\nWhat made it such a strong season opener? Let's count the ways (Spoilers ahead; so, West Coast viewers, if you haven't watched it yet, be warned):\n1. The back-and-forth structure: We could tell what were flashbacks, because they were in black-and-white. And, Rick (Andrew Lincoln) was still sporting his face full of bandages. Good to know the Band-Aid supply hadn't disappeared in the zombie apocalypse.\n2. The Morgan-Rick relationship: Instead of being predictable, and giving us a rivalry between these two old friends, the episode smartly showed how Rick quickly trusted Morgan (even letting him hold baby Judith.) Morgan (Lennie James) was also cognizant of what Rick has had to do to survive, even if he seems shaken by seeing Rick's cold-blooded side.\n3. Nothing happened to Glenn, thank goodness: I'm worried about Glenn (Steven Yeun) this season. He made it through the season-opener, but will he live to regret letting that weasel Nicholas live?\n4. Jessie isn't Rick's girl: There's nothing like seeing a man kill your husband, and then stand there covered in blood to give a gal pause. If Rick thought he and Jessie (Alexandra Breckinridge) would get closer now that she's free of the abusive Pete, he guessed wrong. She deflects his attempts to help train her in Survival 101, and she looks at him like he's some kind of feral animal.\n5. Carol's still playing it cool: She's not yet ready to let on to the Alexandrians that she's more than a cardigan-wearing pie-baker. But Morgan's not fooled, as he sees how watchful Carol (Melissa McBride) is.\n6. Daryl leading the walker herd: On his motorcycle, leading a herd of walkers away from Alexandria, Daryl (Norman Reedus) looks like he's in the most depressing parade ever.\n7. The walker herd: The army of walkers who have been stuck in the nearby quarry are such a vast, terrifying number they look like something out of one of the \"Lord of the Rings\" movies.\n8. Oh, shut up, Father Gabriel: The useless Father Gabriel (Seth Gilliam), who tried to convince Deanna (Tovah Feldshuh) that Rick and his group were threats to Alexandria, offers to help with Rick's plan of directing the walker herd away from the town. Rick has a succinct answer to Father Gabriel's offer: \"No.\"\n9. Rick's in charge: His plan for diverting the walkers away from Alexandria may sound \"insane,\" as Rick himself admits, but Deanna is OK with Rick calling the shots. If you doubt that, go ask Carter (Ethan Embry), whose abortive uprising against Rick goes nowhere. Rick doesn't kill him, even though he wanted to, because he knows Carter's the type who shouldn't be alive. Sure enough, a walker chomps on Carter, who doesn't make it out of the episode alive.\n10. Questions! So many questions!: We're left with a cliffhanger, as the walker herd responds to a horn that's coming from Alexandria. Who'd do something that dumb? Will the herd overrun Alexandria? When's Carol going to get out of the pantry and start showing what she can do? And where's Carl?\nWhat did you think?
