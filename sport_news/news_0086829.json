She was sacrificed to second by two-hole hitter Emilee Jones. Staggs hit an infield single deep in the hole at shortstop to bring up Hannah Schroeder. Schroeder hit a sharp grounder the second baseman couldn’t handle to score Buschjost. \nBlair Oaks stranded six baserunners through three innings to hold on to a 1-0 lead headed to the top of the fourth. \nAfter a dazzling 18-strikeout semifinal performance, Staggs faced the minimum through three innings. \n“For Payton to give us that kind of start allows for the confidence to be at a higher level in the dugout,” Blair Oaks head coach Sharon Buschjost said, “and you couldn’t ask for more in a district championship game.” \nIn the fourth inning, Staggs surrendered a leadoff walk to Lexi Dickerson, the first baserunner for the second-seeded Lady Eagles. After a wild pitch advanced Dickerson to second, Tavia Matthews broke up the no-hitter with a perfectly placed bunt single. \nNola Polly drove in Dickerson with an infield single to tie the game at 1. Staggs walked cleanup hitter Rachel Surface to load the bases with nobody out. \nWith the pressure mounting, Staggs got a strikeout before Eugene tried to bunt home a run. But first baseman Natalie Mudd cut the runner down at the plate with a force out to keep the lead intact. Staggs then recorded another strikeout to end the only threat Eugene mounted. \n“It’s nice to know that you can start off an inning rough and then get out of it with just one run,” Staggs said. \nStaggs isn’t concerned about the slow starts on offense. \n“Sometimes we’re a little iffy in the beginning and then we always pull through, whether we get them one after the other or they’re spread out,” Staggs said. \nThe Lady Falcons’ time to break out came in the fifth inning. They scored five runs, and it all started with designated player Mackinnley Hamacher. The junior broke the tie with a two-RBI single back up the middle to plate Hannah Schroeder and Macyn Wilbers. \n“Mackinnley’s one of those players that’s deserved time,” Sharon Buschjost said. “It’s been a struggle trying to get everyone in, so for her to come through, it was huge. She said she was still shaking after the game.” \nStaggs led off the inning with a walk, Schroeder singled and Wilbers singled on a bunt to loaded the bases for Sydney Wilde, who popped out to short center field for the first out. Staggs was cut down at the plate on a Mudd bunt, setting up Hamacher’s two-out hit that would prove to be the decisive blow. \n“Normally, I want to see Payton up with runners on, but that particular at-bat, I knew they wanted to be careful with her,” Sharon Buschjost said. “She worked the walk which was the start to some good stuff.” \nPitch hitter Lydia Pointer drove in Mudd with an ground-rule double to push the lead to 4-1. Carli Buschjost continued the offensive outburst with a single that plated Hamacher and Pointer to wrap up the scoring. \nStaggs added three strikeouts to her district tournament total of 32 in the final frame to help her team claim the district championship. \n“I know that now is the time to kick it up a notch and go after it,” Staggs said. \nBlair Oaks will host Fatima at 6 p.m. Wednesday. ﻿", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T11:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T13:28:29.699+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
