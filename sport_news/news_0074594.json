The No. 1 overall pick in June's draft, who had two goals and an assist in the win at Calgary on Saturday, picked up the puck in the neutral zone and stepped around a check before feeding Yakupov for a one-timer that beat Miller from the slot. \nVancouver tied it with 4:17 left in the period when Bartkowski scored his first regular season goal in the NHL. Playing in his 138th game, the defenseman fired a shot from the point that nicked an Edmonton player on the way through and found its way past Nilsson. \nThe Canucks had plenty of chances to grab the lead in the second period. \nDaniel Sedin had two opportunities early before Brandon Sutter sent a backhand wide. Sven Baertschi then moved in alone on a breakaway after a big collision in the neutral zone, but Nilsson made a nice save. \nMiller had to be sharp at the other end with about eight minutes to go in the period, stopping Korpikoski on back-to-back opportunities from in close. \nNOTES: The Canucks squandered two power-play chances and fell to 1 for 20 with the man advantage this season. ... Edmonton opens a three-game homestand Wednesday against Detroit. ... Vancouver continues its five-game homestand Thursday against Washington. ... Bartkowski's only other goal came in Game 7 of the Boston Bruins' memorable first-round series with Toronto in 2013. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T07:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T07:18:54.900+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
