Driving it can be a day at the beach, especially in tight, Boston traffic. Bill Griffith Related Links A lot of Teslas just became semi-autonomous overnight The only Bentley SUV in America rolled through Boston on Thursday People abandon their cars at Logan Airport and now they are up for auction When today’s test car arrived, my heart sang. It was a 2016 Subaru WRX.\nThe WRX is Subaru’s APC. That’s “affordable performance car,” not “armored personnel carrier.”\nAny time I see one, my reaction is predictable and simple: I want to drive it. After all, this is the street version of the car you see competing in the World Rally Championship.\nBut this car was a bit different from WRXs of the past. It had an automatic transmission.\nMy first reaction was something akin to seeing Tom Brady run onto the Patriots’ field wearing a tutu.\nHow could Subaru be peddling a WRX with only two pedals (throttle and brake)?\nWell, of course, they are offering this because a majority of the buying public has no use for a clutch pedal, and Subaru wants the WRX to join the rest of the company’s model lineup in setting all-time sales records.\nFiguring that a WRX with an automatic—and a CVT (continuously variable transmission) to boot—still might be fun, we gave it a try. I just started to type that “this WRX wasn’t half bad,” then realized that wasn’t fair. It was really fun. And the day I got stuck in traffic for 45 minutes, not having to deal with a clutch was really welcome. Given Boston traffic these days, a lot of commuters would agree.\nLet’s continue discussing the CVT for a while.\nGenerally, I eschew using paddle shifters except perhaps to downshift for a highway off-ramp or to slow for a red light on a high-speed road.\nBesides, without a clutch you can get lazy and the CVT eventually shifts back to first gear for you when you stop at a light without flipping down through the gears.\nBut this CVT was fun. The gearbox mimicked a six- or eight-speed gearbox and the instrument panel had a gauge right in front of you telling you what gear you were in and whether the car recommended you upshift or downshift. Often, it had both the upshift and downshift arrows lit, waiting for you to tell the car whether you were going to slow or accelerate.\nBy now you know this review isn’t for the WRX lover, the gearhead who can tell you 50 ways to tweak these cars for more power and performance and who wouldn’t think about driving anything but the six-speed manual.\nStory contintues after gallery.\n10 consumer cars that the pros drive:\n Rally car drivers, both amateur and professional, fly across dirt, gravel and sand during races. But maybe the best part of the rally car circuit is that all vehicles need to be street legal, meaning it’s easy to get your hands on models that are pretty similar to what you see taking on the most brutal courses. Here are some of the most popular rally cars and the info you need to know about the consumer versions. FRANCK FIFE/GETTY IMAGES Ford Fiesta: The consumer version of the Ford Fiesta includes both sedan or hatchback options, at a base price of $14,455 to $21,435. Consumer Reports gives the 2015 good marks for fuel economy and cost, but poor ratings for reliability and owner satisfaction. Only the Fiesta ST is called “truly fun to drive.” The rally car version is seen above competing at the Lotos Rally Poland race in July 2015. JANEK SKARZYNSKI/GETTY IMAGES Ford Focus: Consumer Reports (CR) says the consumer version of the Ford Focus “is among the better compacts...thanks to its agile handling and steady ride.” Like the Fiesta, however, reliability is below average. The base price is $17,170 to $29,170. The rally car version is seen above competing on a French course in 2010. AFP/GETTY IMAGES Volkswagen Polo: The Volkswagen Polo, which has morphed into the GTI on the consumer market, is a sporty hatchback with a starting price of $24,785 to $32,640. CR praises the drive, fuel economy, interior and infotainment system of the 2015 GTI. The rally version is seen above racing at the Lotos Rally Poland race in July 2015. JANEK SKARZYNSKI/GETTY IMAGES Hyundai I20: The I20 has a base price of $15,828 to $27,588. Top Gear puts the newest version at the front of the supermini pack, along with the Volkswagen Polo and the Ford Fiesta. Reviewers there praise the car’s “comfort and ease-of-use,” as well as its slick interior. The rally version is seen above competing at a Lotos Rally Poland race in July 2015. JANEK SKARZYNSKI/GETTY IMAGES Toyota Yaris: The Yaris may look fun on the track but CR calls the 2015 consumer version a “slow, noisy, and tinny subcompact with a choppy ride and an awkward driving position.” At least it comes with solid reliability and a low starting price of $14,845 to $17,620. The rally version is seen above during the two-day Sasol Rally in South Africa during April of 2014. Gallo Images/Getty Images Subaru WRX/STi: The WRX is a seriously powerful four-door sedan, and one of the few that still has manual as the standard option (though there is also an automatic version. WRX STi is more powerful still, with a 350-horsepower engine. The base price is $26,295 to $38,495. The rally version is seen above during a qualifying lap of the Hoon KaboomTX Global Rallycross Championship at Texas Motor Speedway on June 8, 2012. Ronald Martinez/Getty Images Subaru Impreza: The Impreza is among CR’s recommended compact sedans, praised for being well-rounded and maintaining good gas mileage even with standard all-wheel drive. It has a base price of $18,195 to $23,295. The rally version is seen above competing in the WRC Rally Finland in 2010. Massimo Bettiol/Getty Images Mitsubishi Lancer Evo: The Lancer didn’t impress Consumer Reports, which called it “an insubstantial and unimpressive compact sedan.” Still, CR acknowledged its the agility and secure handling, at least with the base 2.0-liter, 148-horsepower engine. The Lancer’s base price is $17,395 to $38,995. The rally version is seen above competing in the FIA Middle East Rally Championship (MERC) candidate event near the Iranian city of Shiraz on September 25, 2014. BEHROUZ MEHRI/GETTY IMAGES MINI Cooper: The MINI Cooper is a rally car born and bred. It’s now on its third generation in the consumer market, which CR describes as “a fun to drive car, with very nimble and sporty handling.” Fuel economy and accident avoidance systems are also above average. The MINI’s base price ranges from $20,700 to $36,250. The rally version is seen above racing across the dunes during the 2013 Dakar Rally in South America. FRANCK FIFE/GETTY IMAGES Volkswagen Golf: Consumer Reports sums up the Golf by saying it’s “a notch above other compacts, and is priced accordingly.” Engine options range from the 115-horsepower electric version to a 292-horsepower four-cylinder turbo. The base price is $19,295 to $39,090. The rally version can be seen above at a launch even for MotorSport Vision Racing in Engand in February 2015. Charlie Crowhurst/Getty Images Instead, this is for the person who might have wanted a WRX but didn’t want to deal with a clutch for whatever reason.\nThere’s a big hidden plus for that person with the CVT.\nHidden among the eight or more trim levels of the WRX and its higher performance STI variant is this equipment nugget: “Subaru’s EyeSight front collision mitigation system is reserved for the WRX Limited with a CVT.”\nHmm. That happened to be the version we were driving.\nThe EyeSight system includes adaptive cruise control, automated pre-collision braking, and a lane-keeping assistance system. It also adds steering-responsive fog lights (operating independently) to illuminate curves.\nThe throttle is responsive and the base 2-liter, twin-scroll 4-cylinder engine has 268 horsepower and 258 lb.-ft. of torque laying the power to all four wheels through Subaru’s all-wheel-drive system.\nThis is a quick car, which means you can get into trouble quickly, too.\nSo these top-of-the-line driver assistance systems are welcome.\nA base WRX sedan (there’s no hatchback version) goes for $27,390 (including destination). The CVT only is available with the next steps up the model line, Premium and Limited. Those are available with manual or CVT, but the two high-performance STI versions (each $40,790) are only available with a manual.\nDRIVER’S VIEW: The WRX has a standard gauge package, high center onboard computer info, and center stack/infotainment center that, like most, is a work in progress. Bill Griffith Standard on the base are AWD, traction and stability control, and backup camera.\nStandard on the base are AWD, traction and stability control, and backup camera. Our Limited model’s base price was $32,390 (including destination). The only option was a Code 23 package that added navigation, an upgraded Harmon/Kardon audio system, keyless access and start, blind-spot alert, and rear cross-traffic alert, plus the aforementioned Eyesight suite of driver assistance systems.\nBottom line: $36,485.\nThe WRX pretty much stands alone in this version with its performance, safety, and AWD abilities.\nOne of the most common questions we get about test cars is, “Are the seats comfortable?” Given that any adult with zero back issues is a rare and fortunate person, this is a hard-to-answer question, given that many vehicles have 8- or 10-way power adjustments, extendable thigh bolsters, some sort of lumbar support, and perhaps side bolsters. I found the sport seats in the Limited model to be as comfortable as I’ve experienced.\nSame for the interior: It was just right, neither Spartan nor bare bones.\nThe heated seats were welcome, the controls intuitive, and visibility was good.\nOn the road, the WRX has a stiff ride made stiffer by 18-inch low-profile tires, and there’s some road noise thanks to Subaru’s weight-trimming efforts. However, this isn’t supposed to be a library.\nWe enjoyed the high-resolution touch screen and overall performance of the Starlink infotainment system. One nit to pick was that my hand would hit one of the other buttons (Home) when I’d change volume via the knob. Of course, that’s avoidable by using the steering wheel control.\nRear seat space was compact-car tight, but the trunk had a surprising amount of useful space for all the gear we took on a weekend road trip.\nAnd the driving experience: Everything you could want (except a clutch).\n2016 WRX Limited Sedan\nTHE BASICS : Price, base/as tested (with destination): $32,390/$36,485. Fuel economy, EPA estimated: 19 city, 25 highway, 21 combined. Fuel economy, Globe observed: 23.9. Drivetrain: 2.0-liter turbocharged, 4-cylinder, CVT, all-wheel-drive. Body: 5-passenger sedan.\nTHE SPECIFICS: Horsepower: 268. Torque: 258 lb.-ft. Overall length: 180.9 in. Wheelbase: 104.3 in. Height: 58.1 in. Width: 70.7 in. Curb weight: 3,450 lbs.\nTHE GOOD: Performance and handling, availability of Subaru’s EyeSight driver assistance technology suite.\nTHE BAD: Some road noise in cabin. No hatchback version. Rear seat is kind of an afterthought.\nTHE BOTTOM LINE: In a class of its own.\nALSO CONSIDER: Mini’s John Cooper Works Edition, Ford Focus ST, VW Golf GTI.\nShare 0 Tweet 0 Advertisement", "external_links": ["http://c.o0bc.com/rw/SysConfig/WebPortal/BDC/Framework/img/bcom_logo_with_name.png"], "published": "2015-10-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T10:06:27.029+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
