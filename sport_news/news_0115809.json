My beloved Washington Redskins are 2-2 and playing much better than I expected, although it could absolutely be better. Still the biggest problem relates to the biggest non-football problem in our nation’s capital (politicians), who the heck are these guys really? They have looked good for two games and bad for two. Inconsistency in D.C? Never change Washington. Actually do change, please change. The Redskins sit in a three-way tie for the NFC East division with the Giants and Dallas. I see both Washington and New York with a hugely advantageous opportunity to run away with the division while the Cowboys are ripped apart by injuries. To do that, they are going to have to find an identity. They cannot keep being this present that is wrapped up every week and then on Sunday it’s either a new car or a bag of Kingsford charcoal. They need to be that car every week. Starting with the quarterback, Kirk Cousins, who has not played terribly, but not great either. He’s been what the team has been, up, down and average. Cousins has thrown for 1,005 yards with a completion percentage of 68.6, four touchdowns and four interceptions. An area I thought Washington would be strong in before the season, they have also been hit or miss, is the running game. Pro-bowl caliber back Alfred Morris has rushed for 261 yards but has not found the end zone yet this season. Rookie Matt Jones has tallied 200 yards on the ground and has scored twice, most of that coming in one game against the Rams. Now we have the ever-familiar plight of injuries that seems to be hitting. After losing Niles Paul and DeSean Jackson early, Jordan Reed is banged up again. Three of Cousins’ four touchdown passes have gone to either Pierre Garcon or Reed. Reed has been the leading pass catcher as the tight end has caught for 278 yards and a score. Washington could easily be 3-1, if not for letting Miami wide receiver Jarvis Landry run wild and almost single-handedly beat them in week one. Then a win over a solid St. Louis team in week two got the fans feeling good only to fall flat against the Giants in a Thursday night game. Now, we are back on the positive, winning train. Can they stay on it and lay more track down on the tough terrain ahead? Page 2 of 2 - One thing is for sure, this is the time that we get to see what this team is really made of. Three of the next four for the Skins are on the road – at undefeated Atlanta, at the Jets and at unbeaten New England.
