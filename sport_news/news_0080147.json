Many of the attacks were carried out by residents of east Jerusalem, the sector captured and annexed by Israel in 1967 and claimed by Palestinians as a future capital. \nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government has portrayed the measures as temporary, in line with what his advisers say any police department in the U.S. or Europe would do to quell urban unrest. But some allege he is dividing Jerusalem, something Netanyahu has said he would never do. \nArab residents, who have long complained of discriminatory Israeli policies, say the latest closures are bringing them to a boiling point and lead to more violence. \n“They want to humiliate us,” said Taher Obeid, a 26-year-old janitor at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. He spoke over the din of car horns, as drivers stuck at one of the new checkpoints vented their anger. \n___ \nIsrael: Arab assailant opens fire on bus station, killing a soldier and wounding 10 others \nJERUSALEM (AP) — An Arab attacker armed with a gun and a knife opened fire in a southern Israel bus station on Sunday, police said, killing an Israeli soldier and wounding 10 people in one of the boldest attacks yet in a monthlong wave of violence. \nThe attack came as Israel further tightened security around the country, highlighted by the construction of a barrier separating Jewish and Arab neighborhoods in east Jerusalem. In a bid to halt the fighting, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said he would meet the Israeli and Palestinian leaders in the coming days. \nIsrael has deployed thousands of police, backed up by troops, to maintain order following a spate of attacks, mostly stabbings, by Palestinian assailants. Those measures have so far failed to stop the violence. \nIn Sunday night’s attack, police said the Arab assailant entered the central bus station in the southern city of Beersheba and began shooting and stabbing people. They said an Israeli soldier was killed, five police were lightly wounded and five civilians were wounded to varying degrees. \nYoram Halevy, a police commander in southern Israel, told reporters that in addition to the knife and gun he entered with, the attacker also snatched a weapon from the soldier he killed. \n___ \nAP Interview: MSF says damage at bombed Afghan hospital ‘does not indicate a mistake’ \nKUNDUZ, Afghanistan (AP) — The head of an international medical charity whose hospital in northern Afghanistan was destroyed in a U.S. airstrike says the “extensive, quite precise destruction” of the bombing raid casts doubt on American military assertions that it was a mistake. \nThe Oct. 3 attack on the compound in Kunduz city, which killed at least 22 patients and hospital staff, should be investigated as a possible war crime, said Christopher Stokes, general director of Doctors Without Borders, which is also known by its French abbreviation MSF. \nThe trauma hospital was bombed during a firefight between Taliban and government troops, as U.S. advisers were helping Afghan forces retake the city after the insurgents overran it and seized control on Sept. 28. Afghan authorities say they are now largely back in control of Kunduz. \nU.S. President Barack Obama has apologized for the attack, and the commander of U.S. and NATO troops in Afghanistan, Gen. John F. Campbell, said it was a mistake. He said the strike had been called in by Afghan forces, but has not explained exactly how it happened or who granted final approval. Internal military investigations are underway, with preliminary results expected in coming days. \nAccording to Associated Press reporting, American special operations analysts were scrutinizing the Afghan hospital days before it was destroyed because they believed it was being used by a Pakistani operative to coordinate Taliban activity. The analysts knew it was a medical facility, according to a former intelligence official who is familiar with some of the documents describing the site. \n___ \nVoter apathy, frustration characterize Egypt’s parliamentary election, first under el-Sissi \nCAIRO (AP) — A mix of voters’ apathy and frustration characterized elections held Sunday for Egypt’s first legislature in more than three years, a chamber widely expected to be compliant with the policies of President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi who, as military chief, ousted the country’s first freely elected leader before he was elected to office himself a year later. \nEgypt’s last parliament, elected less than a year after the 2011 ouster of longtime autocrat Hosni Mubarak, was dominated by supporters of the now-outlawed Muslim Brotherhood as well as ultraconservative Salafi Islamists. It was dissolved in June 2012 following a ruling by the nation’s highest court that its election was unconstitutional. \nA largely toothless upper chamber, also dominated by Islamists, continued to sit until el-Sissi’s July 2013 ouster of the Islamist Mohammed Morsi, when it was also dissolved. \n“There’s no incentive to vote,” declared 38-year-old Mohammed Mahmoud, owner of a carpentry workshop across the street from a polling center in Boulaq el-Dakrour, one of the most densely populated districts in Egypt. \n“Even if a candidate has a platform, I don’t think it’s true. I don’t think it will be implemented. It will be just talk,” he said in Cairo’s twin city of Giza, located in one of 14 provinces in which the first of two days of voting took place Sunday. \n___ \nA year after renewed assault allegations, Bill Cosby suffers series of legal setbacks \nBOSTON (AP) — In both the court of law and the court of public opinion, the case is growing against Bill Cosby. \nA year after allegations of sexual assault resurfaced and snowballed, women who’ve accused him of sexual assault are giving emotional interviews en masse, judges are ruling against him and colleges are continuing to revoke honorary degrees bestowed upon him when he was one of the country’s most admired entertainers. \nCosby, 78, now faces five separate lawsuits, including one filed last week by a woman who says Cosby repeatedly sexually assaulted her beginning when she was 16. Earlier this month, a judge in California refused to throw out a lawsuit filed by a woman who accuses Cosby of molesting her when she was 15. Days later, a federal judge in Massachusetts rejected Cosby’s bid to dismiss a defamation lawsuit brought by three women who’ve accused him of sexually abusing them decades ago. He spent a day being deposed in Boston in connection with a lawsuit by attorney Gloria Allred. And more depositions are likely in the weeks ahead. \nIf that weren’t enough, 27 of the women who say Cosby sexually assaulted them were interviewed together on “Dateline NBC.” Ebony magazine ran a cover with a photo of “The Cosby Show” cast under broken glass. And at least three more universities rescinded honorary degrees in the past week. \nTufts University in Massachusetts delivered a double blow, withdrawing both an honorary doctorate of arts and an award for excellence in children’s media, saying Cosby has “demonstrated a lack of character and integrity.” It joined a growing list of schools — including Fordham, Marquette and Brown University — that have sought to erase any affiliation with Cosby. \n___ \nGowdy: Stevens emails show ‘total disconnect’ between security needs in Benghazi, Washington \nWASHINGTON (AP) — The chairman of the panel investigating the deadly 2012 Benghazi attacks said Sunday that new information reveals a “total disconnect” between the security needs of U.S. personnel on the ground and the political priorities of Hillary Rodham Clinton’s State Department staff in Washington. \nRep. Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., described emails from Ambassador Chris Stevens to the State Department requesting more security almost from the moment he arrived in Libya. The request virtually crossed paths with one Clinton’s staff sent to Stevens, asking the new ambassador to read and respond to an email from a Clinton confidant, according to Gowdy. At another point, Clinton aide Victoria Nuland asked Stevens for advice on “public messaging” on the increasingly dangerous situation in the region, Gowdy said. \n“He didn’t need help with (public relations), and he was asking for more security,” Gowdy said on CBS’“Face the Nation.” Gowdy refused to release the emails on Sunday. But he said they point to “the total disconnect between what was happening in Libya with the escalation in violence — that we were a soft target, that there was an increase in anti-Western sentiment … while Washington is asking him to read and react to a Sidney Blumenthal email and help on how to message the violence.” \nAt one point, according to Gowdy, Stevens joked in an email: “Maybe we should ask another government to pay for our security upgrades because our government isn’t willing to do it.” \nGowdy described the emails as he defends his 17-month probe into the Sept. 11, 2012, attack that left Stevens and three other Americans dead, and anticipates Clinton’s long-awaited public testimony on Thursday. The event is a make-or-break moment for the investigation that even some Republicans say was designed to undermine Clinton’s second bid for president. \n___ \nThousands of migrants stranded in the Balkans on their new route toward Western Europe \nOPATOVAC, Croatia (AP) — Tension was building among thousands of migrants as they remained stranded in fog and cold weather in the Balkans on Sunday in their quest to reach a better life in Western Europe, a day after Hungary closed its border with Croatia and the flow of people was redirected to a much slower route via Slovenia. \nTiny Slovenia has said it will only take in 2,500 people a day, significantly stalling the movement of people as they fled their countries in the Middle East, Asia and Africa. On Saturday, more than 6,000 people reached Croatia, but most of them were stuck in the country as well as in neighboring Serbia on Sunday— and thousands kept on arriving. \nOn the Serbian-Croatian border, tensions flared and scuffles erupted as hundreds of irritated migrants faced a cordon of Croatian policemen preventing them from entry. \nThe Balkan migrant route switched to Slovenia early Saturday after Hungary’s right-wing government closed its border to Croatia for the influx, citing security concerns and saying it wants to protect the European Union from an uncontrolled flow of people. \nSlovenian officials said they can’t accept 5,000 migrants per day as asked by Croatia, which is likely to cause a further backlog in the flow. Interior Ministry official Bostjan Sefic said Slovenia can’t take more than neighboring Austria, which said it can accept 1,500 per day. \n___ \nDevelopment plans for an enormous Mormon cattle ranch in Florida stirring controversy \nDESERET RANCH, Fla. (AP) — Under one of the biggest land development plans ever proposed in Florida, a tract more than six times the size of Manhattan could be transformed from a home for cows and alligators into new housing developments for half a million people. \nOver the next six decades, the plan being developed by the Mormon church-owned Deseret Ranch promises to convert the largest undeveloped section of metro Orlando into more than a dozen bustling neighborhoods. In the process, it would radically reshape Osceola County, a suburb that has been transitioning from cowboy culture into a major destination for Puerto Ricans moving to the mainland. \nOpponents say the plan to convert cattle pastures to cul-de-sacs could destroy tens of thousands of acres of important habitat near the headwaters of the St. Johns River flowing north and the Kissimmee River flowing south. They also worry that Osceola County has been doing the bidding of Deseret Ranch, one of the nation’s largest ranches. County commissioners approved the ranch’s plan unanimously in September and now it awaits a state review. \n“There are no checks and balances happening,” said Karina Veaudry, a landscape architect, who is with the Florida Native Plants Society. “The county has been bending over backward pretty much to do whatever they say.” \nBut other environmentalists who once opposed Deseret’s proposal have dropped their objections, saying the plan shifts population growth to east of the county’s urban core, rather than to its south where development might pose a greater threat to the headwaters of the Everglades. They also say it’s better to have a comprehensive plan rather than breaking off 1,000-acre tracts at a time for piecemeal development. Osceola County currently is about three-quarters rural. \n___ \nEddie Murphy receives Mark Twain Prize, nation’s top humor award, at Kennedy Center \nWASHINGTON (AP) — Eddie Murphy is trading places with Mark Twain. \nThe Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts is honoring the comedian, film star, producer and director Sunday evening with the nation’s top prize for humor. \nA lineup of funny men and women including Dave Chappelle, George Lopez, Kathy Griffin, Arsenio Hall, Trevor Noah and Whitney Cummings will salute Murphy with the Mark Twain Prize for American Humor. \nOther performers include stars from “Saturday Night Live,” where Murphy had an early break. Among the SNL alumni paying tribute to Murphy are Tracy Morgan, Chris Rock, Jay Pharoah, Kevin Nealon and Joe Piscopo. \nThe humor prize honors those who influence society in the tradition of Samuel Clemens, the writer and satirist known as Mark Twain. Past honorees include Jay Leno, Carol Burnett, Tina Fey, Whoopi Goldberg, Ellen DeGeneres, Will Ferrell, Richard Pryor and Bill Cosby. \n___ \nPeyton Manning overcomes 3 interceptions, Broncos stay unbeaten with 26-23 OT win over Browns \nCLEVELAND (AP) — As is often the case, Peyton Manning made all the plays when it mattered most. \nManning shook off three interceptions and drove Denver in range for Brandon McManus’ 34-yard field goal with 4:56 left in overtime, giving the unbeaten Broncos a 26-23 win over the Cleveland Browns on Sunday. \nManning took the Broncos from their 12 to the Cleveland 16 before McManus kicked his game-winner to make Denver 6-0 for the seventh time in franchise history. The Broncos only rallied thanks to their top-ranked defense, which came up huge in overtime. \nAfter Manning’s third pick, Denver recorded a tackle behind the line of scrimmage and then made two consecutive sacks of Josh McCown to push the Browns (2-4) out of field-goal range. \nGiven another chance, Manning took over. He completed 4 of 4 passes for 39 yards on the last drive. Manning, who has thrown seven touchdown passes and 10 interceptions this season, finished 26 of 48 for 290 yards and the one TD, a 75-yarder to Emmanuel Sanders.
