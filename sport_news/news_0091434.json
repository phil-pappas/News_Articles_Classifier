(RHKYC/Guy Nowell) \nHONG KONG—The Audi China Coast Regatta 2015, one of the most exciting regattas of the Royal Hong Kong Yacht Club season took place off the southern coast of Hong Kong. \nThis year the races started more to the east of Hong Kong than previously with racing on the first two days (Oct 9 and 10) of two windward leeward courses set each day, starting near the Ninepin Islands. On these two days the winds were fairly mild blowing at 7-12 knots. \nThe winds picked up for the Islands race on day-3 reaching 25 knots for the Waglan, Sung Kong, Steep, Ninepins and Basalt course. \nThe start was delayed for 20 minutes while the Committee Boat secured anchor and the start line and windward marks were set, by which time the wind had subsided to about 20 knots. Several boats decided not to race in the heavy conditions leaving 29 boats to contest the day’s races. \nAfter completing the five races one discard was allowed but Australian Ray Roberts skippering “Millennium Racing” finished with a clean sweep of 5-wins in the 5-races to take the IRC Racer 0 Division top award ahead of Sam Chan’s “FreeFire”, Frank Pong’s “Jelik” and Geoff Hill skippering “Antipodes”. Syd Fischer with Super Maxi “Ragamuffin 100″ struggled in the competition finishing down the order in each race, except for race-2 when he posted a 3rd place. \nIn the IRC Racer 1 Division, Marcel Liedts helmed his new yacht “Zannekin”, that has been performing well during the Summer Racing season at Hebe Haven, into a winning position with a total of 8-points, ahead of Steve Manning and Anthony Root in “Black Baza” and Nick Burns and Fred Manning’s “EFG Mandrake”. \nIRC Racer 2 Division, William Liu’s “Sea Wolf” topped the standings also with 8-points clocking up 2-wins and 3-second places, ahead of Lowell Chan’s “Dexter II” and Simon Blore helming “Mojito”. “Stella” (Rolland Buser), “Whiskey Jack” (Nick Southward) and “Andiamo” (John Woo) were the next three in line. \nThe Rob Berkley/Gaston Chan owned “Calamansi” won IRC Racer 3 category with 7-points ahead of “Lady Butterfly” helmed by J C Broyelle and “Goddess” helmed by Mayio Hood. \nIn the IRC Premier Division the result was “Xena” (Peter Forsythe/JingLee), followed by “Moonblue” (Pete Churchouse) and “Lighthorse” (Shawn Kang). \nThere was close competition in the HKPN Division with Herman Wong helming “Kiasu” just ahead of Darling (Dean Chisholm) but both on 11-points (nett), “Glory Sportfun” was 3rd on 12-points and “Pepper & Salt” finished in 4th place. \nRace to Vietnam The biennial Audi Hong Kong to Vietnam race in conjunction with VinaCapital and CMG Asia, organized by the Royal Hong Kong Yacht Club starts on Thursday, Oct 15. This 673 mile, downwind race from Victoria Harbour, Hong Kong to Na Tang, Vietnam is the longest Category One, offshore race in Asia.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T14:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T18:13:30.251+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
