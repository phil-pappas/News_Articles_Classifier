(AP) - New Hampshire's federal bankruptcy court will be moving from Manchester to the federal courthouse in Concord.\nThe move isn't expected to take place until 2017.\nChief Judge Jeffrey Howard of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit announced the plan this week.\nBankruptcy court currently rents space in a building on Elm Street in Manchester that houses other federal agencies.\nHoward said the move to judicial space in the Warren B. Rudman federal courthouse in Concord will achieve considerable cost savings.\nThe district and bankruptcy courts will be under the same roof but will operate independently and maintain their respective clerks' offices.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T07:39:28.289+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
