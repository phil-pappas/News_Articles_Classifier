We all sold out for the team, and I can’t ask for anything more than that. If we keep playing like this, we’ll keep winning.” \nThe Golden Tigers (6-1, 2-0 SIAC West) held Stillman to 165 total yards and forced four turnovers. \nTuskegee linebacker Osband Thompson’s 65-yard interception return for a touchdown with 11:56 left in the first quarter gave Tuskegee a 6-0 lead and set the tone for the Tuskegee defense. Linebacker Jewell Ratliff had 10 stops. \n“We don’t feel like we’re on top of world as a defense,” said Thompson, who had another interception and eight tackles. “There are some things that we need to improve on. Today, we competed hard, and we have to play smarter.” \nTuskegee did commit 21 penalties for 221 yards, something head coach Willie Slater said will hurt this team moving forward. \n“There were just too many of them,” Slater said. “Our defense was awesome today and gave us some short fields. We expect to score with that kind of field position. I’ll have to watch the tape to see the personal fouls and try to do something to get that fixed.” \nThe offense finally got going in the second quarter for Tuskegee as it gained 175 of its 428 total yards. \nTuskegee quarterback Kevin Lacey completed 8 of 13 passes for 170 yards and a touchdown while being sacked three times. Tyree Brooks rushed for 53 yards and two touchdowns on seven carries. \nRunning back Dennis Norfleet, who rushed for 74 yards on four carries, left the game with a shoulder injury. Devozea Gaines returned a kickoff 83 yards for a touchdown early in the fourth quarter for Tuskegee \nStillman (3-3, 1-1) finished just two of 14 on third downs and picked up only 10 first downs. The Tigers went 3-for-3 in the red zone. \nStillman quarterback Brett Standifer completed 4 of 8 passes for 34 yards with two interceptions and was sacked twice. Backup quarterback Mikiel Clemmons had two touchdown runs, and running back Rovonta Johnson rushed for 18 yards on nine carries. \nStillman fumbled twice deep in its own territory late in the second quarter, setting up a 10-yard touchdown pass to Leo Gilbert and a 7-yard run by Tyree Brooks to make the score 29-0 at halftime. \nRuben Sartain led the Stillman defense with six tackles. Michael Herrod had five tackles and a fumble recovery. Everett Curry also had five stops. \nTuskegee now holds a 10-1 all-time record against Stillman with its only loss coming in 2011. Slater has a 9-1 record against Stillman. \nTuskegee, now 5-0 against SIAC teams this season, will visit Kentucky State at noon next Saturday. Its final four games are against division foes. \n“We knew that the bull’s-eye would be on our back this year,” Morgan said. “That just means we need to grind even harder and fight from the first down to the last down.” Buy Photo Tuskegee running back Dennis Norfleet goes airborne for a moment while running deep near the end zone.
