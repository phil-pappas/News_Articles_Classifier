Warhawks look to rebound Jeff Seisser | Union sports editor Daily Jefferson County Union \nWHITEWATER — Up until last Saturday only a handful of players on the UW-Whitewater football team had experienced a loss at the collegiate level. \nThe Warhawks suffered a 10-7 loss to UW-Oshkosh in a battle of nationally ranked teams, dropping them both out of the top spot in the D3football.com poll, and more importantly, out of a first-place tie in the Wisconsin Intercollegiate Athletic Conference standings. \nUW-Whitewater’s last loss came on Oct. 27, 2012 to UW-Stevens Point. From the next week on, all the Warhawks did was win 36 consecutive games, the sixth-longest streak in NCAA Division III history, and win back-to-back WIAC and NCAA III national championships. \n“The thing that I’m real excited about is our seniors — they’ve embraced this situation,” said UW-W coach Kevin Bullis. “We haven’t lost a game in a long time, but they were smart enough to pull the team together and have a team meeting and really emphasize to the team about ‘getting ourselves better.’” \nBut according to Bullis, it’s not time to hit the panic button. \n“By no means,” he said. “Our goals are still intact, everything is still in front of us.” \nIn last week’s loss the Warhawks (4-1 overall, 1-1 WIAC) were just 3-of-11 on third-down conversions, and were held to a season-low 71 yards rushing. \n“They beat us fair and square, but we beat ourselves, too,” said Bullis. “We did not execute properly on the little things that we take a lot of pride in; we’ve got to take this as a live-and-learn lesson.” \nWhitewater, now ranked No. 6, has a chance to right the ship, and on a short week hosting UW-La Crosse (2-3, 1-1) under the Perkins Stadium lights Friday. Kickoff is 7:05 p.m. \n“In some ways I think that’s perfect timing,” Bullis went on to explain. “When you come off of a tough loss, definitely one of the best things that happens is getting yourself into that next practice and next preparation that coming opponent. There’s a bit of a cleansing about it.” \nThe Eagles very well could be 2-0, winning last week’s game over Stout, 28-21, after suffering a 21-20 overtime defeat to River Falls in their WIAC opener. \nLa Crosse enters the game the seventh-best scoring offense (18.2 points/game) and sixth-best rush defense (198.4 yards/game), two areas Whitewater is looking to exploit. \nJordan Ratliffe remains the WIAC’s leading rusher (507 yards) despite being held to 81 yards on 19 carries, and out of the end zone for the first time all season. \nTyler Jenkins is UW-L’s top back, rushing for 220 yards and a pair of TDs, while sophomore defensive back Ryan Weber is the WIAC’s top tackler with 68 stops. \nOne of the most dominant D-III teams of the 1990s, La Crosse has not had a winning season since going 5-4 in 2007 \n“They’re always going to bring talent to the game,” said Bullis, who has coached against the Eagles for 20-plus years. “They’re going to challenge us, that’s not a question. \nThe all-time series couldn’t be closer, with both teams winning 32 games during their 64 meetings. However, Whitewater has dominated the series of late, earning 12 consecutive victories including a 38-7 win at Perkins Stadium last season. \n“I don’t know which game in the conference isn’t a rivalry (anymore), but there’s always been a rivalry with La Crosse,” added Bullis. \nNEWS & NOTES: \nThis is the 65th meeting between the two programs dating back to 1917 … Joel Dettwiler is 12-30 in five seasons as head coach at UW-La Crosse … Long snapper Zach Koch, a former Fort Atkinson High School athlete, was named the UW-W Walmart Special Teams Player of the Week … The game can be heard live on KOOL FM 106.5 WKCH with Gary Douglas providing play-by-play and Arnie Peck giving color analysis.
