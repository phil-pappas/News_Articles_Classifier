LOUISVILLE , Ky. - Two weeks ago, this city near the Indiana border was hit by severe rains that caused flooding and power outages, and forced building evacuations. Now, Louisville is mired in one of the most sensational scandals to hit the town since Muhammad Ali was prosecuted for draft dodging in 1967.\nThe woman who has emerged in the center of the massive storm seems like a character in a tawdry reality series. But she's real, and she's threatening to bring down one of the most famous sports heroes this state has ever known.\nKaren Sypher , a former trade-show model who is under federal indictment for trying to shake down Louisville basketball coach Rick Pitino for millions of dollars, was on the stand in a divorce hearing on Thursday in downtown Louisville.\nSpruced up with heavy red lipstick, purplish eye-liner and a tiny pink skirt that hovered above her knees, Sypher looked like she was dressed more for a night on the town than for an appearance in court. But that appearance changed when questions turned to visitation rights regarding her 4-year-old daughter. Sypher, 49, held her bleached-blonde head in her hands for almost a minute, appearing to pout. When she finally picked up her head, she had a vacuous, innocent expression. For a woman who is at the heart of this very messy legal dispute and has been depicted in court documents as a liar and an extortionist, she didn't appear particularly threatening. But through vicious claims and accusations, all wrapped up in a smile, Sypher has proven to be a verbal buzzsaw who is threatening to undo the career of one of America 's most successful coaches.\nIn his seventh year at Louisville, Pitino, 56, took the Cardinals to the Elite Eight this past season. He is the only coach in NCAA history to take three different teams to the Final Four.\nAnd around here, he's more than just a guy with a whistle.\n\"Pitino is huge,\" says the Rev. John Stoltz , the pastor of the St. Gabriel Archangel Church, one of the largest Roman Catholic churches in Louisville. \"He isn't just a technical coach. He is a motivator in terms of making his players better and getting the best out of them, and people equate that to the moral life.\"\nSo Pitino, who keeps a priest, Ed Bradley , near his bench for games, isn't just a successful basketball coach: He's an educator, a motivational speak and author, a near-religious figure.\nAll of that came into question after Karen Sypher filed a report on July 9 with Louisville police accusing Pitino, who is married with five children of raping her twice in 2003. In a controversy that took six years to unfold, Pitino admitted under questioning by police investigating the charges to having had sex with Sypher on Aug. 1, 2003 in an after-hours tryst at an upscale Louisville eatery. Authorities declined to charge Pitino, citing insufficient evidence. According to Louisville Metro Police reports acquired by the Daily News through the Kentucky Open Records Act, Pitino was able to prove that he was in Pebble Beach , Calif. , in late August of 2003 at the time of the second alleged rape.\nHe also passed a polygraph examination administered on July 12 of this year by a retired FBI agent , according to a Louisville Metro Police report. He was asked whether he ever forced himself on Sypher and Pitino answered \"No.\" The results of the examination came back, \"NDI,\" which means \"No Deception indicated.\"\nAccording to a report of the July 12 interview conducted by the police, Pitino said that he met Sypher (then named Karen Cunagin ) at a restaurant, and after some initial flirting was soon involved in a sexual encounter with her. Sypher asked him that night if he had a condom. He did not.\n\"She told him that he should (be careful) because she had just gotten out of a relationship and was not on birth control,\" the police sergeant who interviewed Pitino wrote in his report.\nThey had sex in the back of the closed restaurant and Karen Sypher later drove the coach home, badgering him about getting tickets to Louisville games during the ride, according to the report.\nTwo weeks later, Sypher told Pitino she was pregnant. According to the report, Pitino asked her if she was sure of this and she was offended by the question.\n\"He said that he explained that he was married with five kids, and that she had four kids, and that he didn't know what he wanted to do about the situation,\" the report said. \"He said that if she chose to have the child that he would require a blood test to determine for certain whether or not the child was his. She told him that she was going to have an abortion, and stated that she did not have health insurance.\"\nPitino admitted to giving Sypher $3,000 for the abortion, though his attorney, Steve Pence , qualifies the transaction by saying that the money was actually used to pay for the health insurance that eventually paid for the procedure. Pence has gone to great lengths to deliver the message, through the media, that the abortion decision was not something Pitino took lightly, and a voice message Karen Sypher produced for the media last week seemed to reflect that.\n\"I think that the best thing in all scenarios is to go through with it (have the baby), but that it has to be your call,\" Pitino said on the message left on Sypher's phone. \"I think, I really can't give you any advice, except I have thought about it.\"\nKaren Sypher would accept the $3,000 from Pitino to pay for the abortion, but that, of course, was not the end of the saga. Sypher eventually married and divorced Pitino's longtime associate, Tim Sypher ; allegedly demanded that Pitino pay her $10 million in exchange for her silence; accused him of raping her in their initial encounter and one time afterward; and allegedly lied to the FBI when they questioned her about the shakedown. On April 24 of this year, Sypher was indicted by federal authorities for extortion.\nAntonelli/News Pitino, shown hugging wife Joanne, accused Sypher of trying to extort $10M from him. * * * At the tip of the Bible Belt, Louisville boasts a heavy Catholic and Southern Baptist population; the revelation that Pitino, who describes himself as a devout Catholic, committed adultery and paid for an abortion, has divided this city to its religious core.\nOn one hand, a student group at the university, Louisville Cardinals For Life, has announced plans to petition the school for his removal. On another, in a part of the country that views basketball as religion within itself, even though Pitino committed adultery and financed an abortion, he still has his supporters. Local news broadcasts and newspaper reports conveyed the sense that even his detractors may be willing to forgive Pitino, afraid that the man they simply call \"Coach\" might leave Louisville for calmer waters.\n\"That would have been terrible if he stepped down,\" says Timothy Pitts , a 42-year-old UPS driver. \"I wish he didn't do what he did, but we need Rick here, man. I like his style: he knows how to dress, he knows how to talk. He wins. He does a lot for this state.\"\nPitino, who previously coached Providence College , the Knicks , the University of Kentucky and the Boston Celtics , insists he's not going anywhere. He addressed reporters here on Wednesday to apologize for his transgressions and affirm his desire to stay in Louisville. University president James Ramsey and athletic director Tom Jurich released statements expressing their steadfast support for Pitino. The school is trying to put the situation in the rearview mirror as quickly as possible, although that will surely be difficult. Add in the custody battle between Karen Sypher and her estranged husband, Tim, who has worked for Pitino for more than a decade with the Celtics and Louisville, currently serving as the Cardinals' equipment manager, as well as the courtship between Karen and Tim that began after her encounters with Pitino, and you have all the ingredients of a story that could take quite some time to untangle.\nSypher has not been particularly shy about telling her side of the story, either. As Pence says: \"She is clearly enjoying her time in the media spotlight. The details of this saga haven't stopped her from talking.\"\nThere is also the issue of how this scandal will affect Pitino's recruiting efforts in New York ; he has mined his hometown for many players, including current Louisville seniors Edgar Sosa (Rice) and Will Scott (Collegiate).\n\"Any weakness a program has, the sharks will use that,\" says Ron Naclerio , the longtime coach at Cardozo High School in Queens. \"I'm sure right now there's someone putting together a scrapbook of all the negative things written about Pitino and is sending it to some kid he's recruiting. It's that cutthroat.\"\nIf a rival wants to throw a wrench in Pitino's future courtship of a player, he can start by discussing how the coach committed adultery on Aug. 1, 2003 at Porcino, an upscale bistro in Crescent Hill , a sleepy neighborhood where the sidewalks along Frankfort Ave. are lined with park benches and the atmosphere is serene, punctuated only by the conversations of people sipping espressos and leafing through newspapers. The restaurant where Pitino and Sypher got together and the rest of the neighborhood are \"two different worlds,\" according to James Spalding , an assistant manager at Fat Jimmy's, a pizza parlor located a few blocks east on Frankfort Ave.\n\"It's a different crowd over there,\" he says of Porcino. \"You look at this neighborhood and it's families and kids, and you look over there and that's a place you can stick around later when it closes, if you're important, and get special treatment.\"\nSpalding spoke of the sidewalk in front of Porcino as being populated with Ferraris and limos, and described a recent book signing for Pitino in which the special drink of the evening was dubbed the \"Pitini\" in the coach's honor.\n* * * A worker at a Cracker Barrel restaurant in downtown Louisville, who requested anonymity for fear of reprisal, says it's the common perception around town that Pitino and his wife, Joanne, are separated.\n\"Everyone says that she lives in New York and he stays up here,\" the worker says. \"You never see them at games. Everyone knows they're not together anymore.\"\nThose close to the Pitinos say that they are still together. It's just that Joanne prefers New York over Louisville, they say, so she stays there most of the time.\nIn any event, Pitino apparently wasn't thinking of his wife on Aug. 1, 2003, when he and Sypher went into a back room of the restaurant and had sex. Pitino had made eye contact with Sypher earlier in the evening, and summoned her over to his table. They talked about their children, and soon the keys were tossed to Pitino to lock up, everyone left and Pitino had the run of the place.\nWas this a common activity for Pitino? Karen Sypher told The News that Pitino was a \"womanizer\" who knew exactly what he was doing. Pence, the coach's attorney, wouldn't comment. Sypher phoned Pitino two weeks later to tell him she was pregnant. Pitino offered to meet her to discuss the matter.\nWhy he chose to meet with her at Tim Sypher's condominium is just one of a number of decisions he has made throughout this ordeal that would later come back to haunt him. Sypher says she believes she knows why she was summoned there.\n\"I was being set up,\" she said after the custody hearing for her daughter, Annabelle, on Friday. \"He was trying to keep me quiet, so they set it up that he would start dating me and then get involved with me, all to keep things under control.\"\nReinke/AP Sypher is in middle of divorce proceedings with husband Tim. Pitino's attorney suggested that perhaps it was Pitino who had been set up from the beginning.\n\"There's no evidence that this was coach Pitino's child,\" Pence says. \"And coach Pitino does not acknowledge that it was his child. This could have been a set-up from the very start.\"\nSypher could have been pregnant the night she met Pitino, Pence says. Sypher also told police that Pitino raped her a second time, at Tim Sypher's condo, saying that she was shoved to the floor and raped even as Tim, a former private investigator, was in an upstairs room. The Louisville Metro Police investigated the rape accusations and sent the case to the Office of the Commonwealth 's Attorney, David Stengel , for review. Stengel decided not to pursue the case.\nPitino did not attend the Syphers' divorce proceedings on Thursday or Friday at Jefferson County Judicial Center , but had he been there, he would have been reminded of the details of the last six years of Sypher's life.\nIt was Pitino who brought Karen and Tim together at Tim Sypher's home. Tim Sypher began courting Karen after that initial meeting, and the two began a relationship that lasted six months and led to their marriage in 2004.\nDuring a recess in the court proceeding, Karen Sypher told The News that her relationship with Tim was rocky from the beginning. When she traveled with the basketball team, she said, any contact with Pitino made her feel like she was \"being raped all over again.\"\nNonetheless, Karen Sypher was a magnet for attention, dressing in short skirts and low-cut blouses when she accompanied the team on road trips, according to Kenny Klein , the Louisville sports information director.\n\"She liked the attention,\" he said in a phone interview.\nKaren Sypher filed for divorce in March, and Tim testified on Thursday that one of the reasons he left his wife was because of her attempt to extort as much as $10 million from Pitino. A criminal complaint and affidavit filed in U.S. District Court in Louisville, reviewed by The News, reveals that Karen Sypher made demands for \"college for her children, two cars of her choice, a house paid off, $3,000 cash per month, and another payment of $75,000 if Mr. Pitino departs the University where he coaches.\"\nThe affidavit also said that, \"If accepted, I will protect Rick Pitino's name for life.\" The demands were made in a note that was given to Pitino by Tim Sypher, who was not charged in the alleged plot.\nThe criminal complaint and affidavit were filed on April 24, and were reported by the Louisville Courier-Journal the next day. Pitino admitted in an interview with police on July 12 to having what he characterized as consensual sex with Karen Sypher, and the Courier-Journal first reported the incident last Tuesday.\nTim Sypher would not comment on his relationship with Karen, and he hung up when a Daily News reporter reached him on his cell phone.\nThe U.S. Attorney's office in Louisville is prosecuting the extortion case against Karen Sypher. She has been indicted and arraigned, and there's a pending trial in federal court slated to begin with a pretrial telephone hearing on Aug. 31, said Jim Earhart , her court-appointed attorney. Karen Sypher has pleaded not guilty to federal charges of lying to the FBI and of attempting to extort $10 million from Pitino.\nPitino says his attorney has advised him against talking to reporters. Klein, the sports information director, says that life is otherwise normal for the coach, despite the scandal. Sasy Klein , Pitino still arrives at his office each morning at 7.\nStill, there are signs that Pitino has been feeling the strain.\nOfficials at Samford University in Alabama , where Pitino was scheduled to speak next month at a luncheon, agreed to cancel his appearance at the Cumberland School of Law because of the firestorm. But overall, the community appears to be standing behind him, not because they sympathize with him but because they don't want to lose him, they say.\n\"Pitino is kind of like a god around here,\" says Spalding, the assistant manager at Fat Jimmy's. \"He kind of does whatever he wants. Around here, he's royalty. I'm sure he never has to buy himself a meal.\"\nTags: college basketball", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T00:55:23.072+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
