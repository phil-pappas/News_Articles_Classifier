But each player knows bigger challenges await. \n\"You do kind of fan boy out a little bit and get excited, but at the same time it's like being up 21 points in the first quarter,\" junior offensive lineman J.J. Dielman said. \"We have so much season left.\" \nThat leaves the Utes hungry for more, beginning this Saturday against Arizona State. \n\"This team deserves it,\" senior quarterback Travis Wilson said. \"We've worked really hard and trying to prove a lot of people wrong. I'm just trying to make a statement, and I hope each week we can get better and be able to handle whatever comes next.\" Related Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T05:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T06:44:32.794+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
