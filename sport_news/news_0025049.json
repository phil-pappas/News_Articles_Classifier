Jordan was booked on child support-contempt charges and bond was set at an eye-popping $482,190.50 — a number that, in child support cases, generally coincides with the amount owed.\nIt was unclear if Jordan posted the full bond amount prior to his release Friday afternoon. Fulton County Sheriff’s Office spokeswoman Tracy Flanagan said her department received a release order, but had no further information.\nOnline court records suggested a status hearing in the child support case was held Wednesday, and a release order was listed as being filed on Thursday. Attempts to reach attorneys representing both Jordan and the plaintiff in the case were not successful Monday.\nThe child support case tied to Jordan’s arrest dates back to 2002, records showed.\nJordan, 44, is a Houston-based performer who first gained fame in the late 1980s as part of the group Geto Boys.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T14:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T02:02:25.734+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
