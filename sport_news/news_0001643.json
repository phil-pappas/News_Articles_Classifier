Photograph by: THE CANADIAN PRESS , Ben Nelms \nThere’s mastery and then there’s what Ryan Miller has done to the Edmonton Oilers. \nThe Vancouver Canucks goaltender took a 12-0-0 career record against the visitors into Sunday’s sometimes sloppy and sometimes head-scratching Ice Capades show at Rogers Arena. Miller was also 5-0-0 against the Oilers last season, in which he also posted a shutout, and those dozen games of dominance matched the modern-day NHL record of sticking it to the Oilers shared by Jimmy Howard of the Detroit Red Wings. \nOf course, you’d think something had to give with whiz kid Connor McDavid setting up the game’s opening goal by Nail Yakupov. The giddy Oilers looked like they were going to make it back-to-back triumphs after dousing the Flames on Saturday in Calgary for their first win. And they did just that, winning 2-1 in overtime on Lauri Korpikoski's effort off a breakaway that Miller got a piece of before it trickled in at 1:24. \nIt was a weird night. If Matt Bartkowski’s first regular-season goal in 137 games wasn’t enough to raise the eyebrows, how about Henrik Sedin being sent in all alone by Jannik Hansen on a third-period breakaway, being stopped on a backhand attempt and then watching Daniel Sedin put the rebound over the crossbar? \nWhat? \n\"It just rolled off my stick — that's a tough one,\" shrugged Daniel as the Canucks fired 34 shots but remained winless in three home starts. \n\"I just tried to tap it and it bounced. Same thing in overtime. It's one of those games. We played well enough to win tonight. I bury those two and it's a win.\" \nSame for Radim Vrbata. He had six shots, has 25 this season, and has yet to score in six games. He could have won it in overtime after winning a board battle, bolting to the net and watching his backhander slide just wide. \n\"Maybe I'll never score again, but I'll keep trying,\" said Vrbata. \"You can get frustrated if you don't get the chances, but when you get the ones you and it doesn't go in, it's frustrating for sure. Especially early in the season, when you're just looking for that first one to get going. I'll just keep shooting and hopefully one willgo in some day.\" \nWHAT THIS MEANS: \nRadim Vrbata has been down this road before. \nHe gets plenty of shots and can’t buy a goal. It’s only six games and there’s no need to panic. But for a guy who mentions chemistry as much as the sharp-shooting winger — he scored in his first three games last season and had five goals in his first eight games with the power-play backdoor wide open for easy tap-in goals — you have to wonder if the streaky scorer needs more than just the right linemates to finally snipe this season after netting 31 last season. \nVrbata hasn’t been able to get it done with Bo Horvat as his regular centre and on Sunday, he had three first-period shots on a new alignment with Brandon Sutter and Alex Burrows. If anything, there seems to be a slight hesitancy in his quick release, that fraction of the second that’s the difference between breaking out and freaking out. \nAt 34, Vrbata is a pending unrestricted free agent and that has to add a level of pressure. The struggling, predictable and often plodding power play that was 1-for-19 doesn’t help. \nIN A WORD: \nAMAZING: Matt Bartkowski needed 137 games to score his first regular-season goal, a first-period wrister from point. He has one playoff goal (2013), and one preseason goal. \nBULLDOZING: Jake Virtanen bowled over Mark Frayne and Ryan Nugent-Hopkins to get to a flipped puck but Sven Baertschi failed to score on breakaway. \nBLAZING: Jannik Hansen, who has a great set of wheels, watched whiz-kid Connor McDavid blow by him to set up Nail Yakupov’s opening power-play goal. \nWHAT WE LEARNED: \nJared McCann took the game-day skate and did all drills after absorbing heavy hits Friday against St. Louis. \nHe was thumped by David Backes, but a cornerboards collision with big 6-foot-4, 215 pound defenceman Robert Bortuzzo was a trial-by-fire moment for the gutsy rookie who has two goals and two assists in four games. \n“I’m fine,” he said. How McCann,19, holds up physically and mentally when playing third-line centre is compelling theatre. “He was pretty sore yesterday (Friday),” said Desjardins. \nADVANCED STATS \n91: Henrik Sedin’s face-off percentage after two periods in which the captain won nine of 10 draws. The Canucks had a 70 per cent success rate after one period. \n12: Number of give-aways by the Canucks after two periods — three by Dan Hamhuis and two by Bartkowski — in trying to get out of own zone against speedy, forechecking Oilers. \n56: Distance in feet of Bartkowski’s first regular-season goal after he glided along the blueline, found a shooting lane and beat Anders Nilsson to the glove side.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T12:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T16:15:28.352+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
