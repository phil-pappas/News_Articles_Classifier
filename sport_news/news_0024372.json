Conrad is one of two freshman that made the Midseason Mackey Award Watch List, the honor given to the nation’s best tight end. I’m sure many of you are scratching your heads, but allow me to explain. \nConrad came to Kentucky as one of America’s best tight ends, but he hasn’t produced the stats many would like to see. He didn’t catch a pass until the Missouri game ( he had 3 for 55 yards and a TD ), and hasn’t had one since. \nA question at least one caller asks a week is, “Where is C.J.?” While I think we can all agree that we’d love to see C.J. catch more passes, you can’t catch them unless you’re open. C.J. has played a ton of snaps, but he’s either being covered or staying in the backfield protecting Patrick Towles as the H-Back. I know you want him making more great catches, but he’s one of UK’s best pass protectors. If Patrick is getting sacked, no one can catch a pass. \nC.J. will probably not be on this list at the end of the year, but he will catch more passes as the offense takes what the defense gives them. Until then, be patient BBN. C.J. is doing just fine as a true freshman.
