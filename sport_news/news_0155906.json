He offered as good a take on previewing this series as any we've seen.\nRELATED: Mets NLDS playoff roster projection 3.0: Are Jon Niese and Juan Uribe on? \"There are two words they have to worry about are Kershaw and Greinke,\" Sajak said of the Mets.\n\"It's baseball. Anything can happen but look it's a daunting task.\"\nOh how right he is. The Mets will face Clayton Kershaw and Zack Greinke in Games 1 and 2 and that's as impossible as it gets in baseball. They'll have Jacob deGrom and Noah Syndergaard going, hoping they can pitch them even.\nSajak actually offered a pretty apt comparison to these Dodgers: the 2001 Diamondbacks.\n\"The Dodgers remind me of the Diamondbacks when they won — (Curt) Schilling and (Randy) Johnson and not much after that,\" he said.\nThat Arizona team happened to win the 2001 World Series, beating the Yankees in one of the most epic World Series rounds in baseball history.\nWe'll see how far the Dodgers can get, though. Game 1 is Friday night at 9:45 p.m. ET.\nMike Vorkunov may be reached at mvorkunov@njadvancemedia.com . Follow him on Twitter @Mike_Vorkunov .
