Iowa State's defense could depend on the Cyclone ground game to chew up clock and keep those offenses off the field. \nWarren has rocketed to sixth in the league in rushing after carrying only nine times for 28 yards in the Cyclones' first two games. He's averaging 6.9 yards per carry for the season.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T02:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T02:52:01.233+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
