Kyle Flood off suspension at Rutgers, starts with apology \nAn investigation revealed Flood initiated impermissible contact with a faculty member regarding a player’s grade. Under the terms of his penalty, Flood was allowed to run the program six days a week but could not have any contact with anyone in the program on gamedays. \nLike Flood, Carroo, who was suspended Sept. 13 by his head coach, missed the games against rival Penn State and Kansas on Homecoming. He was reinstated in time to start against Michigan State after the simple assault under domestic violence charge against him were dropped. \n“I stayed at home with family and watched the games on the TV,” Carroo said. “I made sure before the game I texted every single last one of my teammates and told them something supportive and motivated them the best as I can.” \nThe only other games Carroo has missed since arriving at Rutgers are the final three of his sophomore season when he was sidelined by a concussion. \n“This was definitely much harder because I wanted to be out there so much for them,” Carroo said, “but I knew I couldn’t so it was me just watching. It hurt. \n“Ultimately I knew I could sit around and I could mope and I could cry, but why not just try to motivate them more? Give them a call or something.” Kyle Flood confident no wrongs in Rutgers drug testing, recruiting \nFlood didn’t have that luxury. \nRecords for Flood’s school-issued cell phone — obtained by Gannett New Jersey through an Open Public Records Act request — indicate that he received 22 messages but did not or was not able to reply to any on Sept. 19 as Rutgers lost 28-3 at Penn State. \nAll but two of those phone numbers are redacted on the records. \nIn fact, Flood only used the phone to make one call that entire day — a one-minute phone call to a redacted number, according to the records. \n“Really hard. Really hard,” Flood said in describing his Saturdays. “I spent the first two by myself watching the game, and then this week's game I spent with my son watching the game.” \nFlood said he apologized to his family and to his team. \n“It was a real moment of sorrow,” offensive lineman Chris Muller said. “He did something that was different — and he apologized like a man. He apologized for what we did. We all looked past it. We’re ready to go out there and go fight for him. There is a little more oomph in our step.\" Kyle Flood returns at Rutgers, but B1G questions remain \nMuller added, “Our leader is back.” \nThe same label often is applied to the co-captain Carroo, who scored three touchdowns in a game for the fourth time in his record-setting career, to spark Rutgers in his return. \n“I thought he gave a lot of juice to the whole team,” Muller said. \nAt least for the time being, a sense of normalcy may be returning to the Hale Center. It has been missing since five players were arrested two days before the season-opener and subsequently dismissed from the program. \n“These guys responded pretty well,” Carroo said. “Even when I was out, they continued to play games and not let Coach Flood, or myself or the other guys distract them at all. \n“I feel like this team is already a focused team. We’re not distracted at all. We’re not around here for accepting any moral victories, but we played hard (against Michigan State) and if we were distracted I don’t think we would’ve played as hard as we did.” \nStaff Writer Ryan Dunleavy: rdunleavy@gannettnj.com Don't miss a thing \nDownload our apps and get alerts for local news, weather, traffic and more.
