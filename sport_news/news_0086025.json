Too bad this gadget can’t do the ironing, too.\nPanasonic teamed up with tech company Seven Dreamers and Japan’s largest homebuilder, Daiwa House, to create the Laundroid — a laundry-folding robot.\nAttendees at the 2015 Combined Exhibition of Advanced Technologies got to watch the first demonstration by the new robot on how the lean, mean laundry machine actually works.\nA demonstrator took a white shirt and tossed it loosely in the opening of the machine and after waiting five minutes, the door opened - with a perfectly folded shirt appearing.\nManufacturers hope to speed up the folding machine to go through an entire load of laundry in seven hours — with users setting up the robot before bedtime to have clothes ready by morning.\nCurrently the machine can fold T-shirts, collared shirts, skirts, shorts, trousers and towels, but developers are looking to find a way to get the robot to fold socks.\nPreorders for a simpler version of Laundroid will begin next year with a release of beta models coming shortly after.\nCreators plan to release the final product — a full wash, dry and fold system — by 2019.\nsburt@nydailynews,.com", "external_links": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/FzZSpiqvb1Q"], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T00:18:30.785+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
