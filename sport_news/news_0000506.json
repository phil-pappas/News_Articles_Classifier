FLORHAM PARK – Say this much about Leonard Williams — he knows how to follow a game plan.\nThe rookie defensive end attended a team meeting Monday in which Jets players received tips from a sleep specialist on how to prepare for their impending trip to London to play the Dolphins on Sunday.\nWilliams then went to sleep during the presentation, but only briefly, he said Wednesday.\n\"I was kind of nodding off in that meeting, to be honest,\" Williams said smiling. \"The guy was telling us it’s all right to go to sleep. And he shouldn’t have said that. And then he turned off the lights. But I was trying to pay attention.\n\"The main thing I got out of it,\" the first-round pick added, \"was that he said we should try to go to sleep a little earlier than we have been and wake up a little earlier than we have been. Because it’s going to be a big time difference and we’re going to be kind of jet-lagged.\"\nWilliams made it clear he didn’t fall asleep in any other meetings this week.\n\"It was just a little bit of nodding off\" in that one meeting, Williams said.\nBut he also indicated he isn’t sleeping on Miami, even though the reeling Dolphins come in off a 27-point loss to Buffalo.\n\"I think the biggest challenge,\" Williams said, \"is keeping people’s attention on the main reason why we’re going there, and that’s to play a game, a division game. … We’re not going there for fun.\n\"It’s huge,\" he added. \"It’s our first division game and we’re coming off a loss, so we have to bounce back.\"\nMiami routed Oakland last season at London’s Wembley Stadium, the site of Sunday’s game. The Jets will be playing their first regular-season game overseas.\n\"It’s going to be tough,\" cornerback Darrelle Revis said of the trip. \"We’re trying to treat this like we’re going to a West Coast game, but we’re actually going the opposite way.\"\nRevis managed to stay awake during the sleep presentation, and he credited head trainer John Mellody for bringing in the specialist.\n\"I think it was beneficial for everybody,\" Revis said. \"I think a lot of guys learned a lot of stuff about themselves [in terms of] sleeping, and he gave us a bunch of tips. … I’m going to try to follow all the steps I can.\"\nThe Jets have advised their players to try to get to sleep 30 minutes earlier this week, and wake up 30 minutes earlier, in an attempt to begin the adjustment to the five-hour time difference in England. But coach Todd Bowles said it’s easier said than done.\n\"You hope you get to bed a little bit earlier,\" he said. \"To say you’re going to go to bed 30 minutes earlier, I know I’m guilty of [not doing] it. You try to do as best you can and treat it like a West Coast trip, and then you adjust when you get there.\"\nThe Jets plan to practice here today, then fly to London this afternoon. They will have a Friday practice in England.\nSuch trips are \"part of the NFL,\" said center Nick Mangold, who will be making his fourth journey to England. He also went there as a child, was at the Summer Olympics in 2012 to root for his sister Holley, a weightlifter, and was there in July for an NFL promotional visit.\nThe Dolphins \"have got to deal with it, too,\" Mangold said. \"It’s something that we’re all going to fight through, and it’s going to make us focus that much more.\"\nAs long as they make sure to be wide awake on game day.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T04:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T08:43:36.512+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
