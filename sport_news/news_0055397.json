These guys are great. I look at them more as brothers than teammates,\" said senior goalkeeper and captain John Flanagan, who made four saves to record his 11th shutout. Read the story \nThe Seahawks did some minor tweaking at halftime to make sure to break through with goals in the second half. They attacked the Wildcats (8-4, 7-3) from out wider and sent balls in low to make the needed connections in front. \nSullivan scored less than three minutes after the break, taking a feed from senior Ryan Klaus and finding the near post from 8 yards for the much-needed first goal. Adelekan then scored unassisted less than three minutes later to make it 2-0. \n\"We were knocking on their doorstep the entire first half and I just knew once we got one to go in the back of the net, they would start pouring in,\" Flanagan said. \"That's the way to end the season, that's what we deserved and it's a great way to win the county championship.\" \nPhotos from Anne Arundel County high school sports events in October 2015. \nEric Janowitz and Danny Peterson scored later — Klaus also picking up his second assist — to ice the victory for the Seahawks, who got strong performance in back from central defenders Nick Koziolek and Mason Reinhart. After a season-opening loss to Archbishop Spalding, the Seahawks go into the Class 4A East region playoffs on an 11-0-2 roll. \n\"They've worked hard in the offseason, they understood what they needed to work on, they put a lot of work into this,\" South River coach Jeff Vincent said. \"They're a tough group. They're resilient and they play really hard.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T03:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T05:48:07.994+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
