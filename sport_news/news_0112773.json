(Photo: Mickey Welsh/Advertiser file) \nTUSKEGEE — Last week, the Tuskegee coaches challenged their defense to force more turnovers. \nBoy did they deliver. \nComing off their first loss of the year, the Golden Tigers grabbed five interceptions in their 35-7 victory over Morehouse, including one for a touchdown by linebacker Jason Ashley. \nRedshirt freshman cornerback Darius Holmes picked off two passes, giving him three for the season. And it still wasn’t enough. \n“It felt good (to get an interception). It felt really good because my safety, Jonah (McCutcheon), he’s kind of in the lead. There’s that competition back there, so we have to go catch him,” Holmes said. “He caught another one, so I really have to catch him again. Hopefully I can catch him this game.” \nThe competition extends back to summer practice, and is sure to continue at 1 p.m. today when Tuskegee hosts Stillman. \nThe defensive players have been competing to get the most interceptions in practice and games. McCutcheon leads the team with four, Holmes has three and linebacker Jewell Ratliff has two. \n“When camp started they let us know pretty quick, ‘All the linebackers get all of the interceptions. We don’t like that.’ So we just took it personal, but it’s fun,” Holmes said. “It’s really serious. We’ll take the ball from each other. It’s that serious, but it’s all fun. It makes practice fun because we’re competing to catch them in practice too. Jonah, he’s going to go get it. You have to make sure you get yours, or he’s going to get it for you.” \nRatliff was in second place entering last game, but didn’t seem to broken up about dropping to third. \n“They can have it. As long as we’re winning, they can have it,” Ratliff said. \nBut as much as the secondary gets the glory, coach Willie Slater credits the defensive line for the record-setting performance. The defensive front is back at full strength with the return of last season’s top pass rusher Julian Morgan last week. \n“Really it was a tribute to the defensive line. I thought they put pressure on him all day and kind of forced him to throw errant passes,” Slater said. “We had people in position to make the plays. But our defensive line played really well that game.” Read or Share this story: http://on.mgmadv.com/1Lz9ivD TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T09:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T10:07:29.870+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
