It's generally a safe bet that Bayern Munich, the Manchesters, Chelsea (this season being the glaring exception), Arsenal, Barcelona, Real Madrid, and Paris St. Germain will finish at or very near the top of their respective league. Our local MLS on the other hand, well, have you run across any of the \"Decision Day\" hype this week? The only predictable thing about tomorrow's final day of the regular season is, surprisingly, that both conference champs have already been determined in New York Red Bulls and a certain FC Dallas. In August (or even late September for Dallas), who could have predicted that FC Dallas would be tied with New York Red Bulls for the most points in the league at the end of October?\nEven more startling is that FC Dallas looks like the strongest team in the West heading into the playoffs. I don't mean to sound derogatory as I love this team, but just taking in this season as a whole, there have been several moments when we thought we'd be lucky to scrape across the red line by \"Decision Day\". Now FCD has actual momentum. Those three consecutive clean sheets - twice versus Vancouver and last Saturday night at Real Salt Lake - are nothing to sneer at. Considering the team's leakiness on the road throughout the season, this defensive surge is enormously encouraging entering the playoffs.\nWith the clinched number one playoff seed in the Western Conference, and their opposition in the West faltering lately, Dallas has a very rare and real opportunity to make it to MLS Cup Final. LA Galaxy rolled over and played dead against the mediocre Portland Timbers last Sunday. Seattle Sounders have not located their groove and could still miss the playoffs. Sporting KC is floundering after their midweek loss at home to already-eliminated-from-the-playoffs Colorado. And FCD got the better of Vancouver in a sort of rehearsal playoff scenario, getting four points from those two consecutive Wednesday games. Opportunity is knocking loudly for FC Dallas.\nHaving said that of course, one game can alter the mood/momentum, so it is still vital that FCD takes care of San Jose who will be at their scrappy, pesky best Sunday night in Frisco (since the 'Quakes have a playoff spot at stake). The boys need the win for continued playoff confidence, but it is a welcome change for FCD fans that we can sort of relax and revel in the San Jose match, with the Western Conference already wrapped up. The Supporters' Shield would be an added bonus, but until all MLS teams play each other home and away during the regular season, it is a trophy with an asterisk. Not to diminish the achievement of earning the most points in MLS, but the prize I'm most interested in is still MLS Cup.\nThough I don't believe in sports curses and jinxes and stuff, I realize it's jinxy to talk MLS Cup Final when the playoffs haven't even begun. And if we know anything about MLS it's that a plucky team could wriggle their way to the Final over a team with many more regular season points. But I can't help myself - the path to the final has never been so laden with golden opportunity for FC Dallas! I know it's four long playoff games away, but who knows when we'll get to see this number one seed home field \"advantage\" scenario again? And if Red Bulls somehow lay an egg on Sunday granting us the Supporters' Shield and opportunity to host the MLS Cup Final?\nCalm down. Deep breath. One game at a time ...\nOn Twitter:\n @nathannipper96", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/nathannipper96"], "published": "2015-10-24T18:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T18:21:39.505+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
