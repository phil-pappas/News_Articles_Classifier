Those events leave only the second wild card and the AL West champion unsettled among the 10 playoff spots. The Houston Astros ' and Minnesota Twins ' postseason chances remain alive for the wild card, as do those for the Angels -- who have been eliminated from the division. The Rangers lead Houston by three in the West with three games to play for each team.\nAdrian Beltre , an indispensable part of two other Rangers playoff teams in 2011 and 2012, came through with the big hit against the Angels -- a three-run double to key a four-run bottom of the fifth against Andrew Heaney that gave Texas a 4-1 lead. Albert Pujols had given the Angels a 1-0 lead in the second on a solo homer.\nWatch Beltre do his thing (but don't touch his head):\nYour browser does not support iframes. \nLeft-hander Derek Holland , who had been struggling during his late-season comeback from injuries, gave up three runs, three hits and three walks over 6 1/3 innings before giving way to the bullpen. The Rangers' key reliever was right-hander Sam Dyson , who retired Mike Trout , Pujols and C.J. Cron on grounders in the eighth.\nTrout finished 0 for 4 for the Angels.\nTexas didn't appear to be racing anywhere in the first half under Banister, a rookie manager with a can-do attitude who was a respected coach with the Pittsburgh Pirates during their rise from bottom-feeder to one of the National League's best teams in recent seasons. The Rangers got off to a sour start even before Opening Day, losing Darvish to Tommy John elbow ligament replacement surgery in March. But they still had significant parts left over from recent playoff teams, plus other additions general manager Jon Daniels added who were playing below their capabilities.\nBut the Rangers began to hit to their potential in the second half, notably Shin-Soo Choo , Mitch Moreland and young Rougned Odor , who joined Prince Fielder and Beltre to create a formidable offense. The Rangers added left-hander Cole Hamels in a big deadline deal, and later brought back a resurgent Mike Napoli to round out the roster.\nThey should be tough in the playoffs.\n\nShin-Soo Choo, resurgent in the second half, has been a big part of Texas's turnaround.
