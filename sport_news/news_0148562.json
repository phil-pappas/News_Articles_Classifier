While familiar faces like Ryan Dzingel, David Dziurzynski, and Colin Greening return, there are plenty of new faces. Rookies Nick Paul and Eric O'Dell are expected to rise through the organization and seasoned veterans like Zach Stortini, Mark Fraser, and Michael Kotska come into the organization looking to provide leadership. As Luke Richardson enters his 4th year at the helm of the Binghamton Senators, this year's roster features probably the biggest year-to-year difference in his tenure. Yet, despite the number of unfamiliar faces and the team's limited time together, fueled by a Tuesday golf outing and team dinner at Richardson's house, the team already has great locker room chemistry. \"Faces are definitely new in the locker room, but I think in any room the guys kind of gel kind of quickly and we know that this is a family and we're going to be together for a long time and we have a long year to go and it's been so far, everyone's getting along really well,\" said Buddy Robinson, B-Sens forward. \"It's a good group of players, but even a better group of guys off the ice,\" said Richardson. \"The veterans they brought in here, remarkable people and they're going to be great leaders for the young guys. Its going to not take too long to gel as a team. But, we still have to find that chemistry and see who works well together on the ice and that'll take a little while.\" The B-Sens also get extra help from Matt Puempel who was sent down to Binghamton from Ottawa late Wednesday evening. Richardson said you can expect to see Chris Driedger start in net on Saturday as the B-Sens host the Albany Devils.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T04:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T05:01:33.060+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
