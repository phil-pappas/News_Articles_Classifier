But that's the process they went through, and they took their time going through it. So we respect the decision and we're going to move forward.\" \nEnunwa's charge of domestic violence simple assault was eventually dismissed , because the woman decided not to pursue the case. But the NFL reserves the right to suspend a player after doing its own investigation. \nEnunwa's initial suspension was for six games, according to ESPN . That is in keeping with the NFL personal conduct policy's punishment for domestic violence. But the league reduced the suspension to four games, because Enunwa cooperated with the investigation and showed remorse, ESPN reported . \nThe suspension will stand at four games, since Enunwa already went through appeal-related discussions with the NFL, according to Bowles. Specifically, the four-game suspension was a \"negotiated settlement\" between the NFL and the players' union, according to ESPN , so there won't be an appeal. \nBowles said he learned of a potential suspension for Enunwa around the Jets' final preseason game, on Sept. 3. \n\"They didn't know if they were going to suspend him or not,\" Bowles said. \"It was something their camp and the league were working out, and we were waiting to hear word.\" \nBowles said he heard final word Monday from the NFL. He said the league did \"not really\" explain the timing of its process, or why the suspension took so long to become official, considering Enunwa was arrested more than a year ago. \nEither way, Enunwa won't face the Patriots, Raiders, Jaguars, or Bills in the next four games. He can return from suspension for the Nov. 22 game at Houston. \nEnunwa became the Jets' No. 3 receiver, behind Brandon Marshall and Eric Decker, because Chris Owusu , the previous No. 3, underwent arthroscopic knee surgery. \nOwusu has missed the past three games. It's unclear if he'll be ready to play in Sunday's game at New England. Bowles is hopeful he will return \"soon,\" but won't know how soon until he sees Owusu run during practice. \nEnunwa is a skilled blocker, a bigger-bodied receiver than Owusu or the Jets' other receivers, Jeremy Kerley and rookie Devin Smith. Kerley and/or Smith could see more action with Enunwa suspended, especially if Owusu remains sidelined. Enunwa played 49 of 67 snaps Sunday in the Jets' win over Washington . \n\"He played tough,\" Bowles said of Enunwa's season so far. \"But we've got some receivers, and we've got some different types of personnel packages.\" \nThrough five games, Enunwa has eight catches, on 17 targets, for 94 yards and zero touchdowns. But his blocking skills will be much harder to replace than his limited pass-catching contributions. \nAccording to NFL rules, Enunwa is not permitted to be at the Jets' facility during his suspension, because it falls under the league's personal conduct policy. \nPlayers suspended under the NFL's substance abuse policy — like Jets defensive end Sheldon Richardson, who just returned from a four-game ban — are permitted to be at the facility. They can work out with their teammates and participate in meetings, but just can't practice. \nDarryl Slater may be reached at dslater@njadvancemedia.com . Follow him on Twitter @DarrylSlater .
