Specifically, the Company achieved third quarter net sales growth of 4% over 2014. On a constant currency basis, the Company grew net sales 12%. The Company's gross margins improved by 540 basis points to 44.1%, resulting in a $13 million (19%) increase in gross profit for the third quarter of 2015 compared to the third quarter of 2014. On a constant currency basis, gross margins improved by 900 basis points and gross profit increased by $25 million (38%) over the same period. Third quarter 2015 loss per share increased to ($0.04) , compared to ($0.01) for the third quarter of 2014, as improved gross margins were offset by planned investments in the Company's marketing and tour programs as well as non-recurring expenses related to the exchange transactions to retire the majority of the Company's convertible debt, most of which were non-cash expenses.\nThe Company has continued to gain market share and drive improved operational efficiencies. As a result, the Company revised its full year net sales estimates to $835 - $840 million (as compared to its prior estimate of $830 - $840 million ) and increased its earnings outlook to $0.12 - $0.15 earnings per share (as compared to its prior estimate of $0.01 - $0.06 earnings per share).\n\"Overall, we are very pleased with our performance in the third quarter and the progress we have made in 2015,\" commented Chip Brewer , President and Chief Executive Officer of Callaway Golf Company. \"Our new products continue to perform well in the marketplace. We have further strengthened our balance sheet, regained leadership in key product categories and markets, and our brand is sustaining its positive momentum. We also continue to be excited about our product pipeline as we move through 2015 and into 2016.\"\n\"Additionally, from an overall market perspective we continue to be encouraged by what we believe are improved industry fundamentals,\" continued Mr. Brewer. \"This includes increased excitement around the world's professional game as well as increased average selling prices and less promotional activity in key markets. Looking forward, we believe that our improved market shares and brand momentum will allow us to maximize current global industry conditions and capitalize on any future improvements in market conditions or foreign currency exchange rates.\"\nGAAP and Constant Currency Results\nIn addition to the Company's results prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (\"GAAP\"), the Company also provided additional information concerning its results on a non-GAAP basis. This non-GAAP information presents the Company's financial results on a constant currency basis. The manner in which this constant currency information is derived is discussed in more detail toward the end of this release and the Company has provided in the tables to this release a reconciliation of the non-GAAP information to the most directly comparable GAAP information.\nSummary of Third Quarter 2015 Financial Results\nFor the third quarter of 2015, the Company announced the following GAAP and constant currency financial results, as compared to the same period in 2014 ( in millions, except eps ):\nGAAP RESULTS\nNON-GAAP INFORMATION\n2015\nGAAP\n2014\nGAAP\nChange\n2015\nConstant\nCurrency\n2014\nGAAP\nChange\nNet Sales\n$176\n$169\n$7\n$189\n$169\n$20\nGross Profit/\n% of Sales\n$78\n44.1%\n$65\n38.7%\n$13\n540 b.p.\n$90\n47.7%\n$65\n38.7%\n$25\n900 b.p.\nOperating Expenses\n$77\n$68\n$9\n$80\n$68\n$12\nPre-Tax Income (loss)\n($2)\n($1)\n($1)\n$7\n($1)\n$8\nEPS\n($0.04)\n($0.01)\n($0.03)\n$0.07\n($0.01)\n$0.08\nThe Company's $176 million in net sales for the third quarter of 2015 were up 4% versus the third quarter last year despite unfavorable changes in foreign currency rates and softer market conditions in Asia. Unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates negatively impacted 2015 third quarter net sales by $13 million . On a constant currency basis, net sales for the third quarter of 2015 grew by approximately 12% compared to 2014.\nThe Company's loss per share for the third quarter of 2015 increased to ($0.04) compared to ($0.01) for the same period in 2014. The Company was able to significantly improve its gross profit as a result of a 540 basis point improvement in gross margins due to more favorable product pricing, less closeouts, less promotional activity as well as improved operational efficiencies. This significant improvement in gross margins was offset by increased investment in marketing and tour programs as well as expenses recorded during the quarter related to the convertible debt exchange transactions. On a constant currency basis, the Company's earnings per share would have been $0.07 . Compared to 2014, the Company's earnings per share for the third quarter of 2015 was also affected by an increase of over 5 million common equivalent shares in the earnings per share calculation as a result of the convertible debt exchange transactions.\nSummary of First Nine Months of 2015 Financial Results\nFor the first nine months of 2015, the Company announced the following GAAP and constant currency financial results, as compared to the same period in 2014 ( in millions, except eps ):\nGAAP RESULTS\nNON-GAAP INFORMATION\n2015\nGAAP\n2014\nGAAP\nChange\n2015\nConstant\nCurrency\n2014\nGAAP\nChange\nNet Sales\n$690\n$752\n($62)\n$737\n$752\n($15)\nGross Profit/\n% of Sales\n$307\n44.4%\n$321\n42.7%\n($14)\n170 b.p.\n$351\n47.6%\n$321\n42.7%\n$30\n490 b.p.\nOperating Expenses\n$250\n$251\n($1)\n$259\n$251\n$8\nPre-Tax Income\n$50\n$61\n($11)\n$85\n$61\n$24\nEPS\n$0.53\n$0.66\n($0.13)\n$0.89\n$0.66\n$0.23\nFor the first nine months of 2015, the Company's net sales decreased 8% (or 2% on a constant currency basis), compared to the same period in 2014. The decrease was largely the result of unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates, a strategic decision on launch timing which negatively impacted revenues in the first quarter of this year, less closeouts and softer than expected market conditions in Asia.\nThe Company's earnings per share for the first nine months of 2015 decreased $0.13 compared to the first nine months of 2014 primarily due to unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates, which adversely affected 2015 first nine months earnings per share by $0.36 . On a constant currency basis, the Company's first nine months earnings per share increased 35% to $0.89 due to a 490 basis point constant currency improvement in gross margins driven by increased pricing, less closeouts, a lower promotional environment and increased operational efficiencies.\nBusiness Outlook for 2015\nGiven the Company's continuing market share performance and its significantly improved gross margins, the Company is narrowing its full year sales estimates and increasing its full year earnings estimates. Given the significant effects that foreign currencies will have on the Company's GAAP results in 2015, the Company has provided guidance on both a GAAP and constant currency basis. The GAAP guidance is generally based upon a blend of current foreign currency exchange rates and the exchange rates at which the Company entered into hedging transactions. The manner in which this constant currency information is derived is discussed in more detail toward the end of this release. Future changes in the applicable foreign currency exchange rates will affect the Company's GAAP guidance.\nFull Year\nThe Company currently estimates the following full year results for 2015:\n2015 GAAP Estimate\n2015 Constant Currency Estimate\n2014 Actual\nNet Sales\n$835 - $840 million\n$885 - $890 million\n$887 million\nThe increase in the low end of the Company's estimates for full year net sales from its previous GAAP guidance of $830 - $840 million is due to continued improvement in market share partially offset by weakening foreign currencies. If the U.S. Dollar were to strengthen during the balance of the year, the Company's GAAP sales estimates would be adversely affected.\n2015 GAAP Estimate\n2015 Constant Currency Estimate\n2014 Actual\nGross Margins\n42.8%\n45.8%\n40.0%\nThe Company estimates that its 2015 GAAP gross margins as a percent of sales will improve approximately 80 basis points from its previous guidance of 42.0% due to a stronger sales mix and less promotional activity as well as continued operational improvements.\n2015 GAAP Estimate\n2015 Constant Currency Estimate\n2014 Actual\nOperating Expenses\n$333 million\n$343 million\n$327 million\nThe Company estimates that its 2015 GAAP operating expenses will be slightly lower than its previous guidance of $335 million driven by cost management activities. The Company expects to continue to support the second half product launches and to support the successful launch of its soft-fast core golf ball.\n2015 GAAP Estimate\n2015 Constant Currency Estimate\n2014 Actual\nPre-Tax Income\n$16 - $19 million\n$54 - $57 million\n$22 million\nThe Company estimates that its 2015 pre-tax income will increase from its previous guidance of $7 - $12 million due to improved gross margins and slightly better net sales.\n2015 GAAP Estimate\n2015 Constant Currency Estimate\n2014 Actual\nEarnings Per Share\n$0.12 - $0.15\n$0.56 - $0.59\n$0.20\nThe Company estimates that its fully diluted earnings per share will increase from its previous guidance of $0.01 - $0.06 due to improved gross margins and better than expected market share gains. The Company's 2015 earnings per share estimates assume a base of 83 million shares as compared to 78 million shares in 2014. The increased share count in 2015 is primarily the result of the retirement of the Company's convertible debt.\nConference Call and Webcast\nThe Company will be holding a conference call at 2:00 p.m. PDT today to discuss the Company's financial results, outlook and business.

To supplement the GAAP results, the Company has provided certain non-GAAP financial information as follows:\nConstant Currency Basis . The Company provided certain information regarding the Company's financial results or projected financial results on a \"constant currency basis.\" This information estimates the impact of changes in foreign currency rates on the translation of the Company's current or projected future period financial results as compared to the applicable comparable period. This impact is derived by taking the current or projected local currency results and translating them into U.S. Dollars based upon the foreign currency exchange rates for the applicable comparable period. This calculation also excludes foreign currency net gains and losses recognized in other income/expense from the translation of transactions denominated in foreign currencies and foreign currency gains and losses recognized from the Company's hedging contracts. It does not include any other effect of changes in foreign currency rates on the Company's results or business.\nIn addition, the Company has included in the schedules to this release a reconciliation of certain non-GAAP information to the most directly correlated GAAP information. The non-GAAP information presented in this release and related schedules should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for any measure derived in accordance with GAAP. The non-GAAP information may also be inconsistent with the manner in which similar measures are derived or used by other companies. Management uses such non-GAAP information for financial and operational decision-making purposes and as a means to evaluate period over period comparisons and in forecasting the Company's business going forward. Management believes that the presentation of such non-GAAP information, when considered in conjunction with the most directly comparable GAAP information, provides additional useful comparative information for investors in their assessment of the underlying performance of the Company's business without regard to these items. The Company has provided reconciling information in the attached schedules.\nForward-Looking Statements : Statements used in this press release that relate to future plans, events, financial results, performance or prospects, including statements relating to the estimated 2015 sales, gross margins, operating expenses, pre-tax income, and earnings per share (or related share count), as well as the Company's recovery, momentum, future products, and ability to maximize current conditions or to leverage and capitalize on improved conditions, are forward-looking statements as defined under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
