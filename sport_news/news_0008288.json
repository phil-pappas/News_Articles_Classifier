He did take part in pre-practice stretching and warm-up and then was seen riding a stationary bike during the 30 minutes practice is open to the media. \nIt appeared cornerback Adam Jones was going to practice in some capacity as he had his helmet and shoulder pads. Jones, who missed Wednesday's practice due to a groin injury that caused him to miss almost the entire second half of last Sunday's win over Kansas City, will likely be a limited participant. \nOffensive tackle Andrew Whitworth was also back at practice after being given a veteran's day off on Wednesday. \nThe four players who were listed as limited participants on Wednesday also were practicing in some capacity on Thursday as well: safety George Iloka, who didn't play against Kansas City due to an ankle injury; defensive back Leon Hall (non-injury related); running back Jeremy Hill (knee) and safety Reggie Nelson (hamstring). \nThe Bengals will release the official practice participation report shortly after practice ends around 1:15 p.m. \nFollow us on Twitter @Local12 and LIKE us on Facebook for updates! \nTo get \"The Skinny\" on local sports be sure to follow Local12 Digital Sports Columnist/Editor Richard Skinner on Twitter @Local12Skinny and LIKE him on Facebook for updates or email him raskinner@sbgtv.com.
