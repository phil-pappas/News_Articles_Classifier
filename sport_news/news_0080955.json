Donald Stephenson and Ben Grubbs have been improvements, but the average Packer defensive line consistently overpowered Laurent Duverney-Tardif and Eric Fisher.\nSome offenses and quarterbacks can overcome weak line play, but in the Andy Reid offense they play a vital role. If the line can’t give Smith time, he immediately checks down or looks to run. This makes the offense extremely one dimensional and predictable, where defenses can stack the box and know that the ball isn’t going far.\nEven if the line doesn’t improve, Reid needs to understand his personnel and scheme better around it. The Chiefs can’t go out a beat teams like the Packers by just throwing check downs 5 yards behind the line of scrimmage on 3rd down. Kansas City is 5 of 30 on third down this year and the play calling is a big reason why.\nReid has the resources on offense around Smith that need to be utilized. Kelce is consistently productive, but no receiver outside of Maclin has more than three catches on the season. Teams can lock in on Kelce, stack the box, have their top corner on Maclin, and if the offensive line continues to struggle then the Chiefs are almost handcuffed.\nWhether it’s on Smith or the receivers, there needs to be more production out of the group as a whole. There were still positives signs to end the Green Bay game, as once Kansas City was down 31-7 they finally started throwing the ball deep.\nChris Conley hauled in the first catch of his career, Jason Avant converted a big 3rd down, and all of Maclin’s 8 catches, 141 yards, and touchdown came in the second half. We’ll see if the success carries over to next week, or if they’ll revert back to the check down mentality.\nQuarterback is the most important position on the field, but Smith isn’t the type of player that can win games on his own. That’s why it starts with the offensive line and goes down to the receivers, who all need to be better in order for Smith to improve.\nThe job of a coaching staff is to game plan and put their players in the best possible position to be successful. Reid did not do that against Green Bay, and it cost them. Despite the 11 days off to prepare, the offense’s 3 yard output in the first quarter is unacceptable at all levels.\nIn Week 4 the Chiefs travel to Cincinnati, where the Andy Dalton led Bengals are off to a 3-0 start. If Kansas City can open up the field like they did to finish the Packers game, the Chiefs should have a good opportunity to win. If it’s more of the same motionless offensive attack, Kansas City is likely to fall to an unimpressive 1-3 record to start the season.\nCopyright 2015 KCTV (Meredith Corp.)
