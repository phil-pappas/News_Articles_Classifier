The team announced the latest surgery Tuesday. Anderson initially had surgery in May to remove bone spurs from his left ankle. But he still was in pain from a fragment, so that was removed in the second procedure. The Wizards said Anderson will start the rehab process immediately. He signed with Washington in July after spending last season with the Brooklyn Nets, averaging 7.4 points, 2.8 rebounds and 1.1 assists, while making 34.8 percent of his 3-point attempts. \nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
