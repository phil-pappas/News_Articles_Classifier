Jeev, named as the captain for the Asian Team for next year’s EurAsia Cup, carded a five-under 65 and was lying tied for third, while Chawrasia, who needs a top-20 finish, carded five birdies in a row enroute a four-under 66. Jeev needs a top-3 finish for the European Tour card. Alongside Chawrasia at tied sixth with a 66 was Rahil Gangjee, while Anirban Lahiri, who is in the race for the Rookie of the Year award on the European Tour, was tied 12th at three-under after dropping a shot on the 18th. Gaganjeet Bhullar (69) was tied 37th, while Rashid Khan, Jyoti Randhawa and Shiv Kapur were tied 54th with rounds of 70. Arjun Atwal was way behind with a round of 73. Jeev, alongwith CT Pan of Taipei and Justin Rose of England, was one shot behind the leaders, Andrea Pavan and Lu Wei-chih, who carded 64 each. Jeev, going through a lean spell in Asia and Europe, was delighted with his form. “I think I needed a start like this and I’m going to give it my 100 percent and hopefully this is my week. I’m glad I’m putting myself in the right position and hopefully I can keep going. In this game, I think when the trust and the confidence comes back, you’ll start putting the numbers on the board. I’m in that process right now and I’m feeling good,” said the six-time Asian Tour winner. — PTI", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T22:19:53.735+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
