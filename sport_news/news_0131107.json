(AP) - The latest on the Louisiana governor's race as three of the major candidates debate issues affecting the state:\n8:10 p.m.\nThree top contenders in the governor's race, meeting in an evening debate, said they'd scale back tax breaks to dig Louisiana out of its recurring budget troubles.\nOnly Republican Jay Dardenne, the state's lieutenant governor, said he'd consider an income tax hike on residents - and he said he'd consider it only after shrinking state government agencies and ratcheting back tax exemptions.\nDemocrat John Bel Edwards, a state representative, said he'd expand the state's Medicaid program to generate more money for the budget and lower income tax rates by getting rid of other tax breaks.\nRepublican Scott Angelle, a state utility regulator, wants to set up a tax break review panel and said he'd eliminate those deemed to have little benefit.\nThe fourth major candidate, Republican U.S. Sen. David Vitter, didn't attend the debate Wednesday.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
