UB was manhandled on the line of scrimmage.\nIn a 20-14 loss to Central Michigan, star running back Anthone Taylor was held to 25 yards on 14 carries. The next week in a home loss to Ohio, Taylor was held to 37 yards on 17 carries, and UB managed only 134 total yards. It was UB’s worst yardage total in eight years.\nUB (2-3) is a seven-point underdog to Central Michigan (2-4). The Bulls need to win one of the next two games to have a realistic shot at a winning season.\n“We’re not worrying about the past,” said UB senior right tackle Bob Blodgett. “We want to move forward. I don’t think it’s a bad matchup. I think we match up well with them. But I think we have to clean things up because we’re just one guy away from making more plays and getting the offense going like it should be.”\nAgainst level competition thus far, the UB O-line has had two pretty good days (against Nevada and Bowling Green) and one poor outing (at Florida Atlantic).\nThe focus for the Bulls’ offense this week is finishing drives. UB rolled up 487 and 500 yards on Nevada and Bowling Green, respectively, but didn’t produce enough points to win the games.\n“In terms of offense moving the ball, we had a bunch of drives and we just weren’t able to punch it in,” said offensive line coach Daryl Agpalsa. “As an offensive line group, that Bowling Green game was probably their best showing in terms of taking another step to becoming a better group in general.”\nThe strength of the O-line is senior tackles – John Kling on the left and Blodgett on the right. The middle three are new. Redshirt freshman center James O’Hagan has done a good job at times sealing off blocks for cut-back runs by Taylor. Senior left guard Dillon Guy, who sat out last year, and sophomore Brandon Malosalvas are big-bodied, physical blockers. Do they have good enough feet to excel against top-end MAC defenders? And can the front five play together well enough to get the job done? UB is going to find out.\n“We’ve got to be able to have that whole group sustain themselves for four quarters and be able to play at a high rate,” coach Lance Leipold said.\nCentral Michigan starts four veteran defensive linemen. They gave UB problems last year by slanting on a lot of run plays and creating penetration in the backfield. Third-team All-MAC safety Tony Annese, back for his senior year this season, helped support the run.\nUB’s bread-and-butter, outside zone runs were strung out and stuffed. The two losses prompted UB to turn the play-calling duties over to running backs coach Matt Simon for the last two games (which UB won).\nTaylor, averaging 95 yards a game this season, says it’s up to him to help out the line.\n“One of the things I needed to work on this year is being able to stay patient and trusting my read and getting out to it instead of cutting early,” he said. “I have to trust the game plan.”\nOne complicating factor in last year’s back-to-back losses was the fact the games came immediately after the unexpected firing of head coach Jeff Quinn. Was UB’s collective psyche thrown off?\n“It definitely didn’t help the situation,” Kling said.\n...\nLeipold said redshirt freshman Terrance Wilson, a reserve cornerback from Georgia, underwent shoulder surgery and is out for the season.\nemail: mgaughan@buffnews.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T08:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T21:26:56.689+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
