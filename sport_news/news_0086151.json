Hopefully that can be in our favor.\" \nVeteran knuckleballer R.A. Dickey will try to get the Blue Jays even in the best-of-seven series Tuesday afternoon. He faces Kansas City's 6-foot-10 right-hander Chris Young in Game 4. \nCueto set down his final 19 batters in the Game 5 clincher against Houston in the AL Division Series, but couldn't continue that streak through the first inning Monday, walking Jose Bautista with two outs. \nThe dreadlocked Dominican gave up six hits and eight runs in two-plus innings. He walked four and hit a batter with a pitch. \n\"He couldn't command the ball down,\" Royals manager Ned Yost said. \"He was up all night long.\" \nAs the full house of 49,751 serenaded Cueto off the field, he smiled and tossed his gum near the Royals dugout. \n\"That's just part of my DNA. That's what comes out, but there wasn't any laughing about it,\" he said through a translator. \nHosmer was surprised to see Cueto struggle, but said facing the power-packed Blue Jays is never easy. \n\"We all know how dangerous they are in this park,\" Hosmer said. \"You don't think he would have the outing he did, but you know it's going to be tough.\" \nRyan Goins homered and had a two-run single for Toronto, one game after his misplayed pop fly set off Kansas City's winning rally in Game 2 on Sunday. \nThe Royals have rallied to win in four of their five postseason victories. \n\"We're not going to tuck our tails in and just give up,\" outfielder Alex Gordon said. \"We've got a lot of competitors on this team and that's what you see.\" \nDespite being outhit 15-11, Toronto pounced on Kansas City's pitching in the first ALCS game north of the border since 1993, scoring its most runs ever at home in the postseason — after managing just three in two games at Kansas City. \n\"That's really what we're all about,\" Blue Jays manager John Gibbons said. \"We desperately needed that breakout.\" \nHosmer had a foul ball bounce up and hit his face in the fifth, leaving him with a bloody, cracked lower lip. \n\"It's just swollen, that's it,\" Hosmer said. \"No pain.\" \nKansas City scored four times off Toronto starter Marcus Stroman and then added four in the ninth, a rally capped by Morales' drive into the second deck. \nToronto fans serenaded Cueto with a sing-song \"Cueto-Cueto!\" chant from the game's first pitch and never quieted down. \nAfter the first, Cueto appeared flustered by the crowd. Eleven of his remaining 13 batters reached and at one point in the third inning he threw his hands up in frustration after gesturing for a new cycle of signs from catcher Salvador Perez . \nDonaldson connected for a 9-2 lead two batters after Kris Medlen entered. Goins homered off Medlen in the fifth as Toronto matched its postseason best with three homers in a game. The Blue Jays also hit three against Texas in Game 4 of the ALDS. \nHIT MACHINE \nLorenzo Cain extended his postseason hitting streak to 12 games, breaking Amos Otis' franchise mark. Manny Ramirez holds the major league record with 17. \nUP NEXT \nThe bookish Young, a Princeton grad, and Dickey, who has talked about his desire to be a teacher, were twice teammates, with Texas (2003-04) and the Mets (2011-12). Young hasn't started since Oct. 2, but pitched in relief in Game 1 of the Division Series. Dickey was lifted with two outs in the fifth against Texas in the Division Series with Toronto leading by six runs.
