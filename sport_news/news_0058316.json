And third, I wanted to be close to my family.”\nHarrison Handley on why he chose Utah\nSALT LAKE CITY — Before the start of the season, Harrison Handley and Ken Hampel weren’t exactly household names for the University of Utah football team.\nNeither was on the two-deep chart and neither was expected to see a lot of action for the Utes at the tight end position.\nBut now, due to a pair of season-ending injuries to Ute tight ends, Handley and Hampel have been thrust into the spotlight for the No. 3-ranked Ute football team, who take on USC Saturday (5:30 p.m. MST) in Los Angeles. And based on last week’s Arizona State game, they are up to the task.\nAt the start of the season, Siale Fakailoatonga and Evan Moeai were listed as co-starters at tight end. However, in the first quarter of the first game against Michigan, Moeai went down with a knee injury. Then four minutes into last week’s Arizona State game, Fakailoatonga went down with a knee injury and was declared out for the season.\nUp stepped Handley, who caught a season-high five passes against the Sun Devils, and Hampel, who caught the first pass of his career, a 29-yarder from Travis Wilson.\nHandley was already getting a lot of reps and had caught four passes including one for a touchdown against Fresno State, but he topped his season total against ASU, including a 2-yard touchdown pass from Wilson. He’s ready for the challenge, although sad about the circumstances.\n“It’s hard to see players go down, especially Siale, who’s one of my best friends,’’ said Handley. “I was learning so much from Evan and Siale, but it’s also a time for me to step up and help the offense.’’\nHandley, a 6-foot-5, 245-pound sophomore, also credits last year’s starter at tight end, Westlee Tonga, as well as Jake Murphy, who started the year before, with helping his progress at the tight end position, along with new tight ends coach Lewis Powell.\n“It’s been great,’’ he says. “Last year I got thrown down deep on the depth chart and really didn’t have any opportunity. Coach Powell is the man — he’s come in and taught the tight ends so much. I’m grateful I got the opportunity to show what I can do and get some playing time.’’\nMany folks from the area are surprised to see Handley wearing the red and white, considering his background. Growing up, it was all about BYU for Handley, whose father, Darren, was a star tight end for the Cougars in the mid-1980s\n“Oh yeah, I was a BYU fan,’’ Handley said with a smile. “My grandpa had season tickets so we always went to the BYU games.’’\nBut toward the end of his prep career at Alta High, Handley started looking at Utah and quickly became converted.\n“I used to come to games when I was being recruited and that’s when I noticed how cool this place was and I really wanted to come here,’’ he said. “It’s kind of funny, I had to convert most of the family over. But my family had no problem at all.’’\nHandley listed three main reasons for coming to Utah.\n“First it was the family atmosphere, second the coaches — every single coach here is great. And third, I wanted to be close to my family. It’s important to be able to look up in the stands and see my mom’s face and the rest of the family as well.’’\nAnother former BYU player who converted to Utah, coach Kyle Whittingham, is happy to have Handley step up and show the depth the Ute program has with a player who can step right into a starting role.", "external_links": ["http://deseretnews.sportsdirectinc.com/football/ncaaf-teams.aspx?page=/data/ncaaf/teams/team33.html", "http://deseretnews.sportsdirectinc.com/football/ncaaf-teams.aspx?page=/data/ncaaf/teams/team93.html", "http://deseretnews.sportsdirectinc.com/football/ncaaf-teams.aspx?page=/data/ncaaf/teams/team71.html"], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T10:43:15.741+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
