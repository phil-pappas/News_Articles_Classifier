By ROB OESTERLE - roesterle@shawmedia.com \nMINOOKA – It’s rare that a team can have a successful season while also building for the future, but that it exactly what’s happening for the Minooka girls volleyball team this fall.

Two of the four sophomores on the Minooka roster played prominent roles in the win, as Alli Papesh, who has already committed to play for University of Dayton when her Minooka career is finished, had eight kills and four blocks, while Rocky Perinar had three kills and seven blocks. Meanwhile, seniors Ginger Perinar (8 kills, 15 digs), a Southern Illinois recruit, and Maddie Alessio (14 digs, 17 service points, 4 aces) and junior Brooklynn Bachmann (24 assists) also were key to the victory. \nIt’s been that kind of formula that has been successful for Minooka all season. \n“We only had four seniors and six juniors at tryouts,” Minooka coach Carrie Prosek said. “I knew I would have to bring up some sophomores, and all four of them [Papesh, Perinar, Holly Bonde and Taylor Baranski] have played great. We have a good mix with them and the juniors and seniors. They are having success while getting varsity experience. \n“I used to say we are a young team, but now I am telling them they aren’t young any more. We are 20 matches into the season. They are varsity players now.” \nThose players had the lead the entire first set, as Rocky Perinar for the first kill of the match. The Indians extended the lead to 11-8 before Alessio got the serve. By the time she was done, she had mixed up high, short serves with long, hard line drives to the tune of 10 straight points, including two aces, and Minooka owned a 21-8 lead. Later, Ginger Perinar ended the first set with a kill from the back row. \nThe second set wasn’t as easy for Minooka, as Plainfield South jumped to a 4-0 lead on the serving of Sophie Berta and three straight kills by Melissa Ryan. Minooka finally tied the score at 6 before Plainfield South took a 12-10 lead. \nBut then Alessio got the serve and got the Indians out to a 17-12 advantage, getting two aces as well as a kill and a block from Rocky Perinar. Papesh had two kills and Ginger Perinar one, along with an ace from Bachmann, as Minooka stretched the lead to 23-13, but Plainfield South wasn’t quite done. \nBerta served the Cougars to within 23-18, recording two straight aces in the process. Two more aces by Margaret Kiebenow pulled South to within 24-21 before Ginger Perinar ended the match with a kill. \n“Our biggest downfall this year has been passing,” Prosek said. “We’ve been focusing on that all year, but you saw it tonight. In the first game, we had zero serve receive errors. In the second, we had five. I was glad to see us finish the match, though. In some of our losses, we have let a bad stretch continue, and we were able to close it out tonight. \n“One good thing for us is that we have a variety of hitters and we can mix things up. Brooklynn Bachmann is the point guard on the basketball team, and she is used to kind of running things. She distributes the ball well. We don’t have one hitter that we go to all the time. We have three or four and that makes us hard to defend. Also, we switched Rocky Perinar to the middle a few weeks ago and she has really done a great job. We are 9-1 since we did that.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T06:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T14:00:31.496+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
