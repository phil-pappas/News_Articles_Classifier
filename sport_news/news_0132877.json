The game will take place Saturday, Oct. 10 at 6 p.m. \nThe threat of lightning made the decision to move the game easy for both schools. Per the standard rules, a game must be delayed whenever there is lightning, according to Cedar Grove head coach Ed Sadloch. \n\"Every time the lightning strikes, it's pushed back a half an hour,\" Sadloch said. \"Our kids [were] sitting around for a couple hours already and we don't want them to come on and off the field.\" \nHeavy rainfall, coupled with the booming thunder and blistering lightning caused the game to initially be delayed from a 7 p.m. start time to 7:30 Friday night. The rain subsided a little before the game was set to begin, but the lights at the Millburn High School field powered down shortly after. As soon as the lights returned, lightning struck and the coaches and officials met on the field and decided to push the game to Saturday. \n\"Tomorrow is supposed to be a better day so we'll be ready to go tomorrow,\" Sadloch said. \"We hope the kids are going to get a good night's sleep and be ready to go.\" \nEmail: gewelb@northjersey.com Â© 2015 North Jersey Media Group Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T04:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T07:01:05.121+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
