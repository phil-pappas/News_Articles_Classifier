But this wasn't the MEAC.\nAnd it didn't look much like Hampton.\nKendell Anderson rushed for 191 yards and a touchdown and surging William & Mary rode a dominant first half to an easy 40-7 non-conference win over the Pirates at Zable Stadium.\nThe Tribe (5-2), celebrating homecoming before a capacity crowd of 12,259, held Hampton to 150 yards of total offense - including just 35 in the first half - to win for the third straight time. The Pirates (4-4), who were averaging 245.6 passing yards per game, managed only 123 in the air - most of them late and inconsequential.\nWilliam & Mary, meanwhile, piled up a season-high 526 yards of total offense.\n\"I'm embarrassed,\" Hampton coach Connell Maynor said. \"I'm the head coach. It's my responsibility. The way my team performed today was very embarrassing.\n\"Hats off to William & Mary. They've got a very good football team, and they took us out to the woodshed today.\"\nThe victory improved the Tribe to 6-0 in the series and 11-0 against the MEAC. It followed wins over Villanova and New Hampshire, both Top 25 FCS teams at the time, and could lead William & Mary to its own spot in the polls.\nNot that its players care.\n\"We prepare for each team like they're the best team in the nation,\" said Anderson, a 5-foot-9, 200-pound junior from Centreville who entered the game fifth among FCS rushers with 117.5 yards per game. \"So the polls, that really doesn't concern us.\"\nTribe quarterback Steve Cluley completed 21 of 32 passes for 244 yards and a touchdown.\nHampton quarterback David Watford, a transfer from the University of Virginia, completed 11 of 28 passes for 123 yards and a touchdown. The dual-threat specialist was sacked three times.\nFacing a blitz-heavy game plan, Hampton managed only 27 rushing yards, averaged 2.9 yards per play and was forced to punt 10 times.\n\"Basically, every time we blitzed, we were there,\" William & Mary coach Jimmye Laycock said. \"And we just completely shut down their running game.\"\nNick Dorka tied a single-game school record with four field goals as the Tribe built a gradual lead that grew to 30-0 by halftime.\nWilliam & Mary took a 37-7 lead on Cluley's 14-yard touchdown run around the right end.\nHampton's lone score came on Watford's 48-yard touchdown pass to Twarn Mixson with 4:19 left in the third quarter to pull the Pirates to within 30-7.\nThe Tribe went ahead 30-0 on Mikal Abdul-Saboor's 3-yard touchdown run with 43 seconds left in the first half.\nWilliam & Mary's lead was at 23-0 when Cluley hit DeVonte Dedmon with a 17-yard touchdown pass with 6:32 remaining in the second quarter to cap a nine-play, 61-yard drive.\nIt could have been worse. With three minutes left in the half, Anderson broke free for an apparent 74-yard touchdown run. But he fumbled the ball into the end zone from the 3-yard line, resulting in a touchback and a brief reprieve for the Pirates.\n\"I was looking at the Jumbotron to see if I went in,\" Anderson said.\nBut there was ultimately no denying William & Mary, whose defense made it look easy for most of the night.\n\"Once we figured out what they were doing and got a feel for the game and how they were going to play, we took care of business,\" said Tribe linebacker Marcus Harvey, who finished with a team-high five tackles and a sack.\nAnderson's 1-yard plunge gave the Tribe a 16-0 lead with 12:07 left in the second quarter.\nWilliam & Mary went ahead 9-0 with just less than a minute to go in the first quarter when Dorka tied a career long with a 47-yard field goal, his third of the game.\nHampton, which has nearly beaten national power Richmond and MEAC frontrunner North Carolina A&T this season, returns to league play Saturday at South Carolina State.\nBut as the team bus rumbled and dejected players filed aboard, Maynor could only spin the loss so far.\n\"If there's a positive you've got to take away from it, it was a non-conference game,\" he said. \"But we wanted to show that we can be competitive and play well against a playoff-(caliber) team like we did against Richmond earlier in the year, and we didn't do that today. That's why I'm so disappointed. I know that we've got a better team than what we put on the field today.\"\n[X] Click a thumbnail to view the full-size image. Buy Pilot photos here. \n\nLoading...
