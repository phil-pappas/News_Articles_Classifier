Morton Hopkins' helmet catch gets catchy name \nHouston Texans wide receiver DeAndre Hopkins (10) makes a catch for a 26-yard touchdown against the Jacksonville Jaguars during the second half of an NFL football game in Jacksonville, Fla., Sunday, Oct. 18, 2015. (AP Photo/Stephen B. Morton) Posted: Thursday, October 22, 2015 10:00 pm NFL Capsules: Houston's Hopkins leads NFL in yards receiving Associated Press | \nHOUSTON (AP) — DeAndre Hopkins spent his first two seasons with the Houston Texans in the oversized shadow of Andre Johnson. \nNow Johnson is gone and Hopkins has shown just how good he can be as the team's clear-cut top option. \nHe's leading the NFL with 726 yards receiving and is on pace to break many of Johnson's franchise receiving records. \nHopkins led the team in 2014 with a career-best 1,210 yards receiving, but in many ways he was still playing second-fiddle to Johnson, the longtime face of the franchise who was released in March after 12 seasons with the Texans. \nSo does the 23-year-old feel a shift this season with Johnson playing in Indianapolis? \n\"I don't really want to talk about him too much because he's not here, but yeah obviously,\" Hopkins said. \nHopkins has thrived this season despite Houston flip-flopping between Brian Hoyer and Ryan Mallett at quarterback. He had 10 catches for 148 yards in a win over the Jaguars on Sunday to become the first player in NFL history with nine or more catches and 145 or more yards receiving in three straight games. \nIt was Hopkins' fourth straight 100-yard receiving game to tie Johnson for the longest such streak in team history. Hopkins' 2,738 yards receiving are second in franchise history in a player's first three seasons behind Johnson's 2,806 yards and he has 10 games remaining. \nIf Hopkins continues at his current pace he would finish the season with 1,936 yards receiving, which would surpass the franchise mark of 1,598 yards Johnson had in 2012. \nHopkins' 726 yards receiving through six games are the second-most in the NFL since 1960 behind the 785 yards Wes Welker piled up in 2011. Third on that list is Hall of Famer Michael Irvin, who had 712 in 1993. \nHopkins, who was selected as the AFC Offensive Player of the Week on Wednesday, isn't too keen on talking about his individual accomplishments with the team off to a tough start. \n\"Our record is 2-4, so there's nothing really to be too amazed about,\" he said when asked about his performance. \nBut the 27th overall pick in the 2013 draft is certainly OK with others raving about his work. \n\"Why not? I guess I'm doing historical stuff right now,\" he said. \"I guess you guys should be amazed.\" \nAlong with leading the league in yards receiving he's also near the top in several other statistical categories. His 52 receptions rank second, his five touchdowns receptions are tied for second, his 42 first downs are the most in the league and his 15 receptions on third down lead all players. \nHis success, according to players and coaches alike, is a product of his hard work and dedication. \n\"He's got a great work ethic, and there's really no substitute for that, and I think that has a lot to do with where he is right now,\" coach Bill O'Brien said. \nHopkins is only 6 feet 1, but his hands are very large, measuring 10 inches from thumb to pinkie. His extra-large mitts allow him to make catches many receivers simply wouldn't be able to snag. \nHe had two catches on Sunday against Jacksonville using just one hand. The first came when he reached out with his left hand and grabbed a back-shoulder pass for 16 yards. \nThe second one that had everyone buzzing came when he trapped the ball with one hand against the side of his helmet for a 29-yard gain in the fourth quarter. \n\"We were sitting in there watching it the other day reviewing it,\" Hoyer said. \"And Arian (Foster) just starts clapping and he's like, 'You're going to pretend like that wasn't just like the most amazing catch you've seen?' I mean it really is when you think about it.\" \nBoth of those catches came near the sideline, showing an area Hopkins has been targeting for improvement. \n\"I had some plays earlier in the season taken away from me just from not being aware of where I was on the sideline,\" he said. \"That's one of my focuses and one of the things I want to work on. It showed this past week.\" \nHoyer, who has the starting job back after being benched in the season opener, targeted Hopkins 15 times on Sunday to give him 89 for the season, which is the most in the NFL through six games since 1991. \nOffensive coordinator George Godsey was asked if they plan to keep throwing his way that much. \n\"We'll see how the defense defends him each week,\" Godsey said. \"I think that's kind of our mentality. If he's open, which he's open quite a bit, then we'll throw him the ball.\" \n-- Kristie Rieken \nTexans' Wilfork speaks out about Florida police shooting \nHOUSTON (AP) — Texans tackle Vince Wilfork is speaking out after a childhood friend was shot and killed by a police officer on Sunday. \nCorey Jones, who is black, died after he was shot three times by a plainclothes officer near his broken-down vehicle in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida, according to his lawyers. The police chief has said the officer was \"suddenly confronted by an armed subject,\" but it comes after a number of high-profile cases involving the use of force by police officers against African-Americans. \n\"I have nothing against (law enforcement), but at the same time you're dealing with somebody that was shot dead,\" Wilfork said Thursday. \"We have to figure it out as a society. Not just this case but the cases that's been going on for a while now. We have to try to figure out a solution. I think everybody needs to be held accountable. Plain and simple.\" \nWilfork is from Boynton Beach, about 20 miles south of Palm Beach Gardens, and said he was so close to Jones that he considers him family and that he plans to visit his relatives when Houston travels to play Miami this weekend. \n\"We need to do everything in our willpower to make sure justice is served,\" Wilfork said. \nWilfork is far from the first athlete to speak out against police violence. \nLast year, members of the St. Louis Rams did the \"Hands up, Don't Shoot\" gesture during pregame introductions to protest the police shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, and LeBron James and several other NBA players wore shirts with the words: \"I can't breathe\" during warmups before a game last season. Those were the last words of Eric Garner, an unarmed black man who died in New York after being placed in a chokehold by police. \nThe 33-year-old Wilfork, who is in his 12th season in the NFL, thought it was important to use his celebrity to shine light on this situation. \n\"We're going to continue until we get justice,\" he said. \"That's how it is right now. Sometimes we have a platform that we can use for a certain purpose. This week, this is my purpose. To have the platform I have to speak about it.\" \n-- Kristie Rieken \nCowboys have first full deck of defenders for visit to Giants \nIRVING (AP) — Greg Hardy and Randy Gregory will be a pass-rushing pair for the first time. Sean Lee and Rolando McClain are set for their second game anchoring the Dallas linebackers. \nThe Cowboys just don't see Sunday's visit to the New York Giants as a show-and-tell moment for a unit trying to help win games while the offense is missing injured stars Tony Romo and Dez Bryant. \n\"There are no special players,\" said Hardy, who had two sacks in his Dallas debut against New England after a four-game suspension for his role in a domestic violence case. \"There's no special answer. There's no special formula. We work harder than anybody else and when we don't, we lose. And that's what we're here to do. Work.\" \nThe defense faltered in all three full games without Romo and Bryant. There were second-half letdowns against Atlanta and New England. In between, a breakdown in overtime gave New Orleans the victory on an 80-yard touchdown pass from Drew Brees. \nThe loss to the Saints was the last game without Hardy and McClain, who was suspended four games for a violation of the NFL substance-abuse policy. And Gregory was still out a week later against the Patriots, the last of four games he missed with a sprained right ankle. \nThe Cowboys (2-3) will technically never be at full strength on defense because cornerback Orlando Scandrick had a season-ending knee injury in training camp and defensive tackle Terrell McClain is out for the year with a toe injury. But it will be as close as the defending NFC East champions can get against the Giants (3-3). \n\"There is no question that everyone's excited about getting some of these guys back and healthy and in the lineup practicing and playing together,\" coach Jason Garrett said. \"We saw a couple of pieces come back a couple of weeks ago when we played New England.\" \nHardy, who missed practice Thursday because he was ill, sacked Tom Brady twice on his blind side, the second one forcing a fumble that the Patriots recovered beyond the line of scrimmage for a short gain. \nThat play illustrated maybe the biggest problem for the Dallas defense: not forcing turnovers. A year after finishing second with 31 takeaways, the Cowboys are tied for last with three and haven't had one during the three-game losing streak. There have been chances marred by dropped interceptions and bad bounces on the loose balls. \n\"We are based off effort and turnovers,\" Lee said. \"And if we don't have great effort and if we're not getting turnovers, we're not playing the right way.\" \nGregory was a projected first-round draft pick who slid to the end of the second round because of concerns about his conduct, including a failed drug test at the combine. He had a promising preseason and three pressures of Eli Manning in the opener against the Giants before spraining his ankle. \nNow he gets his first chance to line up opposite Hardy in the regular season — and maybe even next to Hardy if the Cowboys use the sixth-year player inside as they did a few times against New England. \n\"Me and him have been talking a lot about it, and add a little more pressure to that defense hopefully,\" Gregory said. \nA win would be a huge boost for a team looking to stay in contention with Romo sidelined at least three more games by a broken left collarbone and Bryant trying to get back sooner with a broken right foot. The All-Pro receiver hasn't been ruled out for the rematch with the Giants after getting hurt in the opener against them. \nEither way, Lee isn't taking a win-one-for-the-offense approach. \n\"I think when our focus gets away from what our job is, how to play it play in and play out, that's something that can distract you a little bit,\" the sixth-year linebacker said. \"So our focus is purely being our best every single play.\" \n-- Schuyler Dixon \nThursday Night Football \nWilson, Seahawks rule rivalry with 49ers again in 20-3 win \nSANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) — No turkey necessary this time, just some high-flying defense and more power running by Marshawn Lynch. \nThe Seattle Seahawks rediscovered their tried-and-true formula to get back in the win column, with Russell Wilson and Co. ruling this one-sided rivalry with San Francisco. \nOn another Thursday night, and on San Francisco's home field again. \nWilson threw a 43-yard touchdown pass to Tyler Lockett late in the first half, Lynch added a leaping 1-yard score, and Seattle beat the hapless 49ers 20-3 for its fourth straight victory against its NFC West rival. \n\"It felt like a really normal Seahawk night tonight,\" coach Pete Carroll said. \nThe Seahawks (3-4) whipped San Francisco in Levi's Stadium on a Thursday in prime time 11 months after Richard Sherman chomped turkey on the field last Thanksgiving night following a 19-3 victory. \nWilson completed 10 of his first 12 passes and finished with 235 yards passing and Lynch ran for 122 yards after vomiting on the sideline in the first half, something Carroll said was caused by him getting winded during a busy opening drive. Seattle won for the first time in four road games this season, avoiding another fourth-quarter collapse. \nCarroll and his players were thrilled how they came together after a tough loss at home Sunday against Carolina. \n\"After the tough loss, we said, 'We choose to believe,'\" Wilson said about the message he and defensive end Michael Bennett gave to the team. \"The idea was to believe in one another. ... We lost four tough games but we thought we could have won each one of those.\" \nThis game lacked its usual intrigue with both teams trying to save their seasons and Carroll missing former nemesis and now-Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh. \nWilson made the key plays and Colin Kaepernick struggled once again facing Seattle as the 49ers (2-5) lost four days after snapping a four-game losing streak by beating Baltimore. \nSteven Hauschka sent dirt flying when he kicked a 49-yard field goal in the second quarter four days after Ravens kicker Justin Tucker slipped on the turf and shanked one off the right upright and slipped to the ground on the field that will host the Super Bowl in early February. \nWilson was sacked five times to push his NFL-leading total to 31 and threw a pair of interceptions, but still made plenty of big plays for another lopsided result against the Niners. \nFans left early again in an eerily similar scene to Thanksgiving night, when 49ers CEO Jed York apologized on Twitter in the waning moments by saying: \"This performance wasn't acceptable. I apologize for that.\" \nThis time, it was former 49ers wideout Kassim Osgood weighing in on Twitter with: \"'Something ain't right in SF.\" \nKaepernick's errant passes sailed into both sidelines, one ball even hitting a 49ers staff member in the head early in the game and requiring him to be checked. \nPhil Dawson kicked a 35-yard field goal late in the third, and the 49ers have been held to single digits in their past three losses to Seattle with just one touchdown — outscored 56-13. \nKaepernick dropped to 1-6 in seven starts against the Seahawks with three touchdown passes to nine interceptions and 24 sacks, six more Thursday. \nMichael Bennett had 3 1/2 of those sacks for Seattle, which expects to build off this game. He has a new motto, too: chopping wood. \n\"When you're chopping wood, just keep chopping until the tree falls, man, you can't get ahead of yourself,\" Bennett said. \nThe Seahawks' winning streak in the series started with the NFC championship game in January 2014 that propelled them to a Super Bowl victory. Seattle has won six out of seven overall against San Francisco. \nJermaine Kearse caught a 21-yard pass over a leaping NaVorro Bowman, facing Seattle for the first time since a frightening left knee injury in the NFC title game. He needed surgery and was sidelined all of last season. \nSan Francisco's 55 yards in the first half were the fewest allowed by the Seahawks defense in an opening half since Week 17 of the 2013 season against St. Louis. The 49ers finished with 142, fewer than the 164 they managed on Thanksgiving and second-lowest total allowed by Seattle under Carroll. \n\"Offensively, today it was just not acceptable all the way around,\" 49ers left tackle Joe Staley said. \nThe Seahawks needed six plays once they reached the 3 on their opening drive before Lynch's leaping touchdown, just the team's second TD of the season on the initial drive. \nNotes: The Seahawks improved to 15-2 in prime time since 2010 under Carroll, outscoring opponents 417-194. ... 49ers TE Vernon Davis' 14-yard catch in the second quarter was his first reception since Week 2. ... San Francisco S Antoine Bethea injured his shoulder in the first half and didn't return. \n-- Janie McCauley \nRelated State News \nGiants practice Thursday without middle linebackers \nEAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) — When the New York Giants have talked about injured players being ready for the Dallas Cowboys, most of the discussion tends to focus on wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr. \nThe second-year playmaker has been bothered by a hamstring injury against the San Francisco 49ers on Oct. 11. \nDespite practicing only once, he played almost every offensive down against the Philadelphia Eagles on Monday night, catching a touchdown. \nBeckham is in the same situation with Dallas (2-3) coming to the Meadowlands on Sunday to face the Giants (3-3) in an NFC East showdown. \nHe has not practiced this week and Friday is a team maintenance day. He intends to work on Saturday and play Sunday. \nThe problem for the Giants is the less talked about injured players. Middle linebackers Jon Beason (knee) and Uani 'Unga (shoulder) did not practice Thursday and outside linebackers Devon Kennard (hamstring) and Jonathan Casillas (neck) were limited. Their status is uncertain. \n\"It's status quo for the defensive crew,\" coordinator Steve Spagnuolo said. \"Things are normal. Nothing has changed. Look, everyone is going through that in the league. It's that time of year. Game six. Guys are getting dinged up, banged up and sometimes you have to take some time off.\" \nSpagnuolo hopes everyone is ready for Sunday. The problem is players miss practice reps and that's not good. \n\"What it does is it holds back on some things you might want to change, because you can't change things if guys are not out there working on them,\" Spagnuolo said. \"It affects us.\" \nSpagnuolo alternated 'Unga, his leading tackler with 42, and Beason against the Eagles to keep players fresh against the quick tempo offense. He added having more guys play helps everyone feel like a part of the team. \nAfter saying that his labrum injury was minor would be evaluated Saturday, 'Unga insisted he would play. \n\"I'll be playing Sunday unless somebody holds me out,\" he said. \"I should be good to go.\" \nBeason was not in the locker room to discuss his knee. He hurt it in the preseason and missed the opening two games of the regular season, including the opener in Dallas. \n\"Jon Beason is a pro and a leader,\" Spagnuolo said. \"He is a team guy. I love working with him. I'm glad we got him. Let's get him out there and let him roll.\" \nBeckham, who had seven catches for 61 yards against the Eagles — all in the first half — also expects to be ready. \n\"We're going to be all right,\" he said. \"Like I said, game plan is for Sunday, make sure you stay in the reps, the book, and know what you need to do, know your assignment.\" \nAfter losing to Dallas in the season opener, Beckham knows the importance of this game. \n\"This is definitely a must-win for us,\" Beckham said. \"So you want to come out fired up and you put your best foot forward.\" \nNOTES: Offensive tackle Will Beatty, who tore a chest muscle in the offseason and was on the physically unable to perform list, is back at work. The Giants have three weeks to decide whether to activate him. ... Spagnuolo wasn't hard on Damontre Moore for his roughing the passer penalty against the Eagles, saying his hustle and motor have helped the Giants this season. ... DE Robert Ayers Jr. is making progress from his hamstring injury and may play for the first time in five weeks. \n-- Tom Withers \nBuccaneers look to get Evans more involved in offense \nTAMPA, Fla. (AP) — The Tampa Bay Buccaneers are eager to get Mike Evans more involved in their offense. \nThe second-year receiver is off to a relatively quiet start following an outstanding rookie season. Teammates and coaches say there's no cause for alarm. \nEvans sat out most of the preseason with a sore hamstring that also sidelined him for the regular-season opener. He has 13 receptions for 174 yards and no touchdowns entering Sunday's game at Washington, with most of that production coming during a seven-catch, 101-yard outing against Houston in Week 3. \n\"He's fine. ... We just need to get him started,\" offensive coordinator Dirk Koetter said, noting that despite what Evans accomplished a year ago, when he topped 1,000 yards receiving and tied a franchise record with 12 TD receptions, the Bucs have plenty of playmakers capable of helping rookie quarterback Jameis Winston. \n\"When you have multiple guys that need touches, it doesn't always work out perfect,\" Koetter added. \"We have to do what we have to do to try to win games. ... I'm sure Mike is a little bit frustrated. ... We've been down this road before with other guys. We've just got to get him started. There is nothing he is doing wrong. He's playing hard, he's practicing hard.\" \nActually, the slow start isn't new for Evans, whose rookie year didn't really take off until a three-week stretch in November in which he became the youngest player in NFL history to have three consecutive games with at least seven catches, 100-plus yards receiving and a touchdown. \nThe seventh overall pick in the 2014 draft had 21 receptions for 458 yards and five TDs during the surge, capped by a seven-catch, 209-yard, two-TD day at Washington, where Tampa Bay (2-3) plays again Sunday. \n\"It was a great game for me. It showed my ability to be able to take over games and things like that. ... But they're a different defense this year, with a lot of guys injured. They play different schemes and things like that. It will be a challenge for us, but it's nothing we can't handle,\" Evans said. \nEvans said he's fully recovered from the hamstring problem that sidelined him for a month following the first preseason game. After playing a predetermined number of snaps and not having a catch in his season debut at New Orleans in Week 2, the 6-foot-5, 231-pound receiver was targeted 17 times and had seven catches for 101 yards during a 10-point loss to the Texans. \nIt's been tougher to get him the ball to him the past two games, when he's had a combined six receptions for 73 yards. The 22-year-old Evans stressed his hamstring has not been an issue. \nEvans also shrugged off questions whether the injury prevented him from developing chemistry with Winston, the No. 1 pick in this year's draft, during training camp. \n\"If the ball comes our way, it doesn't matter how many times you're targeted, we just have to make the play when the ball comes,\" Evans said. \nVincent Jackson, who leads the Bucs with 20 receptions for 306 yards and two TDs, and Evans teamed a year ago to become the first pair of Tampa Bay players to amass 1,000 yards receiving in the same season. \nReserve running back Charles Sims is second with 14 catches, two for TDs, followed by Evans. \nWinston said it's a matter of time before a patient Evans gets a chance to shine more. \n\"That's the thing about this team. Everyone, they do their jobs. ... And he has been doing that,\" Winston said. \"He's not going to sit there and complain because at any given time, one play can be — boom — touchdown. It takes one play to make a big play, and for him to get a spark.\" \n-- Fred Goodall \nBears sign DL Hood, cut DL Ratliff \nLAKE FOREST, Ill. (AP) — The Chicago Bears cut Jeremiah Ratliff on Thursday a day after the defensive lineman was seen having an animated discussion with general manager Ryan Pace. \nThe exchange between Ratliff and Pace occurred in a parking lot outside of the team's suburban facility. \n\"We felt moving forward without Jeremiah was in the best interest of our team,\" Pace said in a release. \"We appreciate his contributions and wish him well.\" \nThe move comes after the Bears lost 37-34 at Detroit on Sunday to drop to 2-4 in their first season under Pace and coach John Fox. Chicago has a bye this week. \nRatliff was suspended for the first three games of this season for violating the NFL's substance abuse policy. He started at nose tackle in each of Chicago's last two games and had seven tackles. \nA message was left seeking comment from Mark Slough, Ratliff's agent. \nThe Bears replaced Ratliff by reaching a deal with free-agent defensive lineman Ziggy Hood, a first-round pick by Pittsburgh in the 2009 draft out of Missouri. \nHood signed a four-year deal with Jacksonville in March 2014, but he missed the first part of the season after he hurt his foot in the exhibition finale. Hood was released from the injured list on Tuesday after he passed a physical. \nThe 6-foot-3 Hood has 12 1/2 sacks and 164 tackles in six seasons with the Steelers and Jaguars. \nRatliff, a four-time Pro Bowl selection in Dallas, had 6 1/2 sacks last season for Chicago. He signed with the Bears after he was cut by the Cowboys in October 2013. \nPatriots release DL Thornton \nFOXBOROUGH, Mass. (AP) — The New England Patriots have released defensive lineman Khyri Thornton from the 53-man roster and offensive lineman Brennan Williams from the practice squad. \nThornton was a third-round draft pick by the Packers. The Patriots claimed him off waivers from Green Bay last month. He had already been released once and signed to the practice squad. \nWilliams was a third-round draft choice by the Houston Texans in 2013. He was released by Houston and went to training camp with Jacksonville this summer. His father, Brent Williams, played defensive end with the Patriots from 1986-93. \nNFC East \nAgholor, Cooper miss practice for Eagles \nPHILADELPHIA (AP) — Philadelphia Eagles wide receivers Nelson Agholor and Riley Cooper both sat out of practice for the second consecutive day on Thursday, putting in doubt their availability for Sunday night's game against the Carolina Panthers. \nAgholor, the 2015 first-round draft pick from the University of Southern California, suffered a leg injury when the Eagles beat the New Orleans Saints on Oct. 11. He missed Monday's win over the New York Giants. \nCooper suffered a knee injury in that win over the Giants, although he did return to the game. \n\"(Agholor) is doing things with Shaun (Huls, the director of sports science) and he's coming along,\" Eagles coach Chip Kelly said. \"I don't know, really, what his status will be this weekend. It's kind of up in the air. But he's progressing and working hard at it.\" \nIf neither Agholor nor Cooper can go against the Panthers, the Eagles would be left with slot receiver Jordan Matthews, who leads the team with 36 receptions and 384 yards, Josh Huff (11 receptions, 136) and veteran Miles Austin (seven catches, 133 yards) as their top three receivers. They also have special teams stalwart Seyi Ajirotutu, but he has played just three offensive snaps all season. \n\"Cooper is a big target down the field for us,\" Eagles quarterback Sam Bradford said. \"He has a good feel for those backside throws. I like throwing it out there to him.\" \nWhat the Eagles did for part of the Giants game when Cooper was out was go with some two tight-end formations with Zach Ertz and Brent Celek. That moved Matthews outside from the slot, while Huff, who was also bothered by a knee injury, and Austin split snaps on the other side. \n\"We were thin a little bit for a little while at receiver,\" Kelly said about Monday night's game. \"But Jordan can play any position for us, outside receiver, left side, right side, or inside.\" \nMatthews, who played outside for most of his college career at Vanderbilt, says he has no problem leaving the slot for a wide post. \n\"I love playing outside,\" Matthews said. \"When I came to the NFL, I was predominantly an outside receiver, who played some slot. Then I came here and I was predominantly in the slot. Now, I'm getting some opportunities to go back outside, so I'm back in that comfort zone I had when I got here. \n\"There is a little bit of a change and getting used to it again, but it's kind of like riding a bike. So I'll be fine.\" \nAFC South \nIndianapolis cranks up pressure with aggressive approach \nINDIANAPOLIS (AP) — Colts linebacker Erik Walden likes coach Chuck Pagano's gambling mentality. He's hoping it sticks. \nAfter turning a fourth-down try into a touchdown on the game's opening series last weekend and attempting an onside kick in the second quarter, Pagano has promised to double down on his play calls — a promise his players have embraced. \n\"Anytime you have an approach like that, it motivates you whether you get it or not,\" Walden said. \"It shows he has faith in you.\" \nGet used to it. One year ago, the Colts (3-3) successfully executed three surprise onside kicks on their way to a second straight division title and a third straight playoff appearance. \nThey tried it again Sunday and nearly pulled it off against the defending Super Bowl champs. In fact, Pagano was so certain the Colts had possession he challenged the call even though he knew the replay had to show a \"clear\" recovery for the call to be overturned. \nPagano lost the challenge, and the New England Patriots took advantage of the good field position by driving for a touchdown. \nOf course, Pagano has taken plenty of criticism this week for gambling on another play: Down six points in the third quarter, Pagano called for an unusual formation and a fake punt that blew up in his face. A premature snap to the safety ended with the Patriots taking over and driving for a TD. \nNone of the failures seem likely to deter Pagano from staying aggressive. \n\"We've got the best kicker in the league at doing it,\" Pagano said earlier this week, a reference to Pat McAfee and his onside kicks. \"I think our special teams coaches do a fabulous job of designing ways to get extra possessions if you will. If there's something there and it's to be had, I see these guys practice it and practice it and practice it over and over and over again during the week and weeks past. It's not just something we pull the dust off.\" \nWith Pagano in the final year of his contract, the Colts can't afford to back down as they try to stay atop the AFC South. \nThey're in the midst of a brutal five-game stretch in which they face some of the league's best quarterbacks and top teams. After losing to Tom Brady and the perfect Patriots last weekend, they get Drew Brees and the Saints (2-4) on Sunday, Cam Newton and unbeaten Carolina the following week, Peyton Manning and the unbeaten Broncos on Nov. 8 and Matt Ryan and the one-loss Falcons on Nov. 22. \nThat doesn't mean anything goes, though. \nOffensive coordinator Pep Hamilton said Thursday it was never his intention to run 26 consecutive pass plays in the fourth quarter last weekend and that he has to do a better job finding balance even if the Colts are trying to get back into a game. \n\"I probably was a bit overzealous at the end,\" Hamilton said. \"I probably should have done a better job of mixing in a screen or a draw to help against a good pass rushing front.\" \nBut whatever Pagano decides, one thing is certain: He believes in his players and they believe in him pushing the issue. \n\"What's not good about it? Fourth-and-1? Our offense will get that all day,\" Walden said. \"And he believes in us.\" \nNotes: Safeties Mike Adams (hamstring) and Clayton Geathers (knee) did not practice Thursday. Linebacker D'Qwell Jackson also was given an extra day of rest. ... Linebacker Jerrell Freeman (groin) did limited work. ... Cornerback Dontae Davis, linebacker Robert Mathis and receiver Andre Johnson all returned to practice after taking Wednesday off. Linebacker Nate Irving, who sat out Wednesday because of a knee injury, also was a full participant Thursday. \n-- Michael Marot \nTitans see Falcons RB Freeman as defensive challenge \nNASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) - The Titans still have the NFL's stingiest pass defense, possibly because running against Tennessee has been so easy the past couple weeks. Now they face their biggest challenge yet in Falcons running back Devonta Freeman. \n\"Whew, he's leading the league in scoring, he's leading the league in yards from scrimmage, he's second in the league in rushing,\" Titans defensive coordinator Ray Horton ticked off Thursday. \n\"What an excellent challenge.\" \nThe Titans (1-4) are allowing a league-fewest 184 yards passing, but they now are allowing 129.6 yards rushing after Buffalo quarterback Tyrod Taylor ran for 76 yards in a 14-13 win on Oct. 11 and Miami running back Lamar Miller ran for 113 yards as the Dolphins routed Tennessee 38-10 last week. That puts the Titans 28th in the NFL. \nHorton points to Taylor's performance helping skew Tennessee's defensive numbers. Freeman offers the Titans a bit of redemption to show how they can stuff the run. \n\"This is going to be an excellent challenge for our run defense,\" Horton said. \nMiller was the first running back to top 100 yards against Tennessee this season. Titans defensive lineman Jurrell Casey sees mobile quarterbacks as hurting them worse by taking off running. Colts quarterback Andrew Luck broke loose for a 15-yard run, and Miami quarterback Ryan Tannehill had a 10-yard run. \n\"I don't think we're really having a hard time stopping the run,\" Casey said. \"Our hard thing is letting quarterbacks scramble on us. With Freeman coming in, we just have to stick to what we do and make sure we make the tackle when he runs at us.\" \nFreeman leads the NFL with nine touchdowns rushing and has run for a TD in five straight games. He's just behind Chicago running back Matt Forte with his 505 yards rushing. \nAtlanta coach Dan Quinn isn't ready to look at the Titans and say his Falcons will be able to run all over them, not with Horton and defensive whiz Dick LeBeau running Tennessee's defense. Quinn said the Titans' pass defense is so good the Falcons (5-1) will have to be balanced. \n\"We like the run game but we like also the keepers that come with it, the play-action pass,\" Quinn said. \"So for us, when we're at our best, we know we have good balance offensively.\" \nThe Titans can't afford to focus solely on Freeman, not with Julio Jones leading the NFC with 49 catches for 638 yards. Cornerback Jason McCourty said the Falcons' offensive options means that everyone has to do their job. \n\"At no point if I'm lined up on Julio Jones should I be thinking about Freeman,\" McCourty said. \"But at the same time for defensive linemen, Freeman's their main thing. ... We have to be good with our eyes and our technique.\" \nTitans linebacker Brian Orakpo has been impressed with how Freeman finishes his runs, showing power along with quickness. Orakpo said the Titans know Atlanta will be able to move the ball and three-time Pro Bowler is relishing this defensive challenge. \n\"Obviously, we're a good defense,\" Orakpo said. \"This can be an opportunity for us to be looked at as one of the best in the league, if not the best. It's going to be a great test for us.\" \nNotes: QB Marcus Mariota missed practice for a second straight day. Titans coach Ken Whisenhunt said the rookie is doing really well healing the sprained MCL in his left knee, but they will know more Friday. ... WR Harry Douglas (ribs) and CB Perrish Cox (hamstring) also did not practice. S Michael Griffin (hamstring) was limited. RB Dexter McCluster (illness) practiced fully after missing Wednesday. \n-- Teresa M. Walker \nJaguars running back Yeldon returns to practice \nJACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) — Jacksonville Jaguars running back T.J. Yeldon returned to practice Thursday, an indication he might be able to play against Buffalo on Sunday. \nYeldon missed four consecutive practices with a groin injury and sat out last week's loss to Houston. Without him, Toby Gerhart and Denard Robinson combined for 45 yards on 16 carries. Yeldon has 291 yards rushing, 73 yards receiving and a touchdown this season. \nReceiver Allen Hurns (ankle/thigh) and safety Johnathan Cyprien (calf) also returned to practice after sitting out Wednesday. \nRight tackle Jermey Parnell (knee), receiver Marqise Lee (hamstring), safety James Sample (shoulder) and tight end Clay Harbor (abdomen) missed practice Thursday. Lee and Sample are unlikely to play against the Bills in London. \nOverall News \nNFL extends deal to play games at Wembley through 2020 \nLONDON (AP) — The NFL extended its agreement with Wembley Stadium on Thursday for another five years, meaning the league will play at least two regular-season games a year at the London venue through 2020. \nThe Jacksonville Jaguars will continue to play at Wembley every year throughout the agreement. The NFL also has an option to extend the Wembley deal for an extra five years beyond 2020. \nThe league has played regular-season games at Wembley every year since 2007, and is playing three games in London this year for the second straight season. \nThe new deal was announced ahead of Sunday's game between the Jaguars and Buffalo Bills. Earlier this year, the NFL announced a separate deal to play at least two games a season over a 10-year period at Premier League club Tottenham's new stadium, scheduled to open in 2018. \n\"These agreements reiterate the NFL's commitment to the UK, with two stadium deals running concurrently,\" said Mark Waller, executive vice president of NFL International. \"To be playing in Wembley, the national stadium, and at Tottenham, in what will be London's newest stadium, is fantastic.\" \nThe Jaguars are in the third year of a four-year deal to play one home game at Wembley per year. \nJaguars owner Shad Khan said the extension of the deal until 2020 \"is great news for the Jaguars and the stability of the team in Jacksonville, which has come to embrace London as our home away from home.\" \nNFL owners recently approved a resolution to continue playing international regular-season games abroad through 2025, including possibly in Mexico, Germany and Canada. \nPatriots tweet 'Butt Fumble' picture on eve of Jets game \nFOXBOROUGH, Mass. (AP) — The Patriots' official Twitter account sent out — and then deleted — a picture of the New York Jets' infamous \"butt fumble\" as the AFC East rivals approach Sunday's game in New England. \nWith a hashtag for \"Throwback Thursday\" and the caption, \"This seems relevant,\" the Patriots sent the picture of Mark Sanchez losing the football after running into the rear end of offensive lineman Brandon Moore in 2012. The tweet was deleted, but a screenshot of it was published by the New York Post. \nPatriots spokesman Stacey James did not immediately respond to a request for comment. \nThe Patriots (5-0) host the Jets (4-1) on Sunday for the division lead. \nJets coach Todd Bowles said he was unaware of the tweet and wasn't \"a Twitter guy.\" But running back Stevan Ridley, a former Patriot, said New England coach Bill Belichick would not take kindly to the team's social media department stirring things up. \nAsked what he thought the strict Patriots mentor would do to the employee who sent the tweet, Ridley said with a smile, \"There's no telling, man. \n\"I wouldn't be surprised if he wasn't there (anymore),\" he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T06:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T16:58:23.687+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
