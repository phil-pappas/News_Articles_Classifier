And, not surprisingly, there have been deficiencies on both ends of the floor. \nAfter practice on Tuesday, though, Raptors head coach Dwane Casey sounded optimistic that things are headed in the right direction. \n“With a bunch of new guys, we’re still learning, but the enthusiasm is there, the effort is there. But we’re still not where we need to be,” he said. \nDefence has been the coach’s main concern throughout camp, and that’s where he has focussed the team’s efforts. He says that area of Toronto’s game is finally coming around, and now the offence needs to play catchup. \n“Defensively, I think we are further ahead than we are offensively, not totally there yet but further along. A lot of it is the new personnel we have. We’ve added to our defensive grit and toughness. You have a guy like DeMarre Carroll, a young guy like Cory Joseph, Bismack Biyombo, Anthony Bennett, you add that to the mix you have a lot of grit … and grit does win in big-time competition.” \nCasey says it’s just a matter of time — or timing — before the Raptors’ offence starts to fire on all cylinders. \n“We had some great looks the other night (an 87-81 win over Cleveland on Sunday). Good shots we took in the game, they just didn’t go in. Once our shooters see the ball going through the hoop … I know DeMarre is an excellent three-point shooter, Pat Patterson, Anthony Bennett, Kyle Lowry, all those guys missed some shots they’re going to make. Some of that lack of offence is just hitting that rhythm, shooting the ball and seeing the ball go through the basket.” \nWith the regular season just a week away, Casey said that his starters likely will see more floor time in Montreal, and that suits guard DeMar DeRozan just fine. \n“Just to play more, starters play more together, instead of just a little tease of 19, 20 minutes, just get out there and play,” DeRozan said of what he is expecting from the final pre-season contest. \nCALL OF THE JAYS \nThey know they’re not in the same league yet, but the Raptors are hoping to use the success of the Blue Jays to build up a little momentum of their own. \nThe entire team headed to the Rogers Centre on Tuesday afternoon to watch Game 4 of the ALCS against the Kansas City Royals — and do a little team building in the process. \n“We’re excited about the Jays,” Casey said. “But we know that 10 days from now or whatever it is, we’ve got to toss it up for real. And everybody’s focussed on that. You can kind of see guys’ intensity level pick up. I know my antennas are high. I think that has added to the motivation, feeling the crowd, feeling the city get excited about something. We feel that and (hope to build off it) going into next week.” \nDeRozan had already experienced the excitement of Jays’ post-season baseball when he and Lowry took in Game 3 on Monday night, an 11-8 Toronto win. \n“We had an amazing time,” DeRozan said. “Definitely good to get out there and support our team, on the other side, instead of us being the ones getting the reception from the crowd and everything. We went in the locker room and saw all the media lined up down the hallway, me and Kyle was amazed at that. It felt good (Monday) night just to sit back and be a fan … It’s a great energy to have in the city.” \nYOUNG ASSETS \nWith the pre-season coming to an end soon, the Raptors are going to have to make some roster decisions. But don’t expect any opening-night surprises. \n“As a staff we understand who is where. We have a good feel for who’s in the rotation and who’s not,” Casey said. \nThat means young guns such as Bruno Caboclo will be found on the Raptors’ 905 Developmental League team where they can be nurtured. \n“The young group that we have, all of them have a lot of value, a lot of them are very talented young men, they just need time in this league, time in the D-League, time to grow,” Casey said. “It’s probably one of the most talented young groups that we have had. \n“They have a great feel for our offensive and defensive systems, they’re going to learn the same things at 905. They’re a phone call away from being here, an upset stomach away from being here, I don’t want to say injuries because we don’t want any injuries, but maybe an upset stomach away from being here, ready to go.” \nAROUND THE RIM \nTerrence Ross was a bit of a slow starter even when he was a starter. So how is he adapting to life coming off the bench? “He’s going to have to get used to coming in and being productive quickly. You don’t have time to get loose and get a feel for the game, you have to come in instantly and be ready to play defence or shoot that three,” Casey said. “He’s known the entire summer, since we got DeMarre, that he’s going to be in that situation and he’s adjusted to it. The mind-set is there, he’s accepted the role.”… It looks like an NBA championship is headed to Cleveland for the first time, that’s if you trust a survey of GMs released by NBA.com. According to the survey, 53.6% of the voters said LeBron James and the Cavaliers would win the NBA Finals this season. James also received 39.3% of the MVP votes. Other results from the GM survey include Philadelphia 76ers centre Jahlil Okafor receiving 44.8% of the votes for rookie of the year honours, while fellow first-year centre, Minnesota’s Karl-Anthony Towns (62.1%), was projected to be the 2015 NBA draft’s best player in five years. San Antonio Spurs forward Kawhi Leonard was named as the league’s top defender (27.6%) while Toronto’s Andrew Wiggins (17.2%) of the Minnesota Timberwolves was tabbed as breakout player for 2015-16.
