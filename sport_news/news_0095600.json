It was the first time since Aug. 6 he reached base more than twice in a game. “[Tuesday] was a long emotional day for a lot of guys. We all went to Yogi’s funeral. I don’t know if that had anything to do with it, but he looked great today.’’\nRodriguez went 0-for-4 and whiffed twice Tuesday after attending Yogi Berra’s funeral in Montclair, N.J.\nRodriguez’s 33rd homer, on Wednesday, produced his 1,065th RBI as a Yankee and tied him with Jorge Posada for 11th place on the all-time franchise list.\nWithout Mark Teixeira, the Yankees are susceptible to left-handed pitching and need right-handed bats such as Rodriguez and switch-hitters Carlos Beltran and Chase Headley to produce.\n“There is some concern of fatigue, of course,’’ Girardi said of the 40-year-old Rodriguez, who played in his 147th game (136th start) of the season. “But we need him now and that’s the bottom line. If we can clinch our [wild-card] spot, I can give him a few days off. \nThat’s the hope that we can deal with some of our regulars but we haven’t been able to do it. I gave him a day off Sunday hoping that would help. We are trying to wrap this up, so I can take care some of these guys.’’\nStephen Drew was examined in Pittsburgh by a concussion specialist.\nStephen Drew Photo: Ray Stubblebine “That’s because that is the [doctor] he saw before,’’ Girardi said of the infielder, who suffered a concussion in 2013. “I am assuming he will be back [Thursday].’’\nThere is a possibility Drew won’t be available for postseason play.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T06:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T10:54:36.711+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
