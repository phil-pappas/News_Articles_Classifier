I'd like to finish sub-5 hours, but it's not my end-all-be-all goal. I've been training with Charm City Run since June; I just want to have a great time out on the course and see what I'm capable of. I'm already signed up to run the Baltimore Marathon again next year. \n— Stephanie Churchill, Parkton \nSeeking 50 states \nIn 2012 I decided I wanted to run a marathon in all 50 states. Baltimore will be my 26th state and my 32nd marathon. Having spent a few years in Ellicott City and Columbia, my brother and I decided to meet here this October and run Baltimore together. We are excited about seeing Baltimore through the streets. This race will be my first as a 50-year-old and my pace is usually 4:05-4:25 depending on the weather (which is looking great as of today). \n— Diana Hughes, Milwaukee, Wis. \nA 'perfect' race \nI like big races, I like a big crowd. When get to 18 to 20 [miles], you need that. ... I belong to a group called I Run 4 Michael. It's pretty huge. You sign up to be a runner for a buddy. … You dedicate all your training and all your races to a child that has a physical disability. \nI just figured Baltimore would be perfect. ... I'm super excited. Everybody's excited for me. \n— Stephanie Balogh, Richmond, Va. \n'Running saved my life' \nBaltimore will be my second Marathon. I ran my first - a small local PA race, the Garden Spot Marathon, this past spring. At first I thought running 26.2 miles would be a \"once and done\" kind of thing, but after crossing that finish line, I knew I had to do another! ... \nI started running a few years ago to loose weight. I lived a very unhealthy lifestyle and honestly this sport has changed my life. I have lost over 100 pounds, run several half marathons, and I'm so excited to finish my second 26.2 in Baltimore. I am not a Boston Qualifier... more of a middle of the pack 4+ hour finisher, who just loves to run. \nThis race will also be very special to me for another reason. I am a part of a mom's running group here in Lancaster - Mom's Run This Town. Since I started running, this group has been an immense source of running knowledge, support, and inspiration. Back when I first started training for this race over the summer, one of the moms I had become friends with through this group had twin boys! Asher, one of the twins was unexpectedly born with a very rare severe skin disorder - Epidermolysis Bullosa (EB). With EB, even the softest touch will cause large blisters and wounds to occur all over the body. It is extremely painful, and there is no treatment or cure. They call children affected with EB \"Butterfly Children\" because their skin is so frail. In the face of this devastating diagnosis, I have seen my friend and her family exhibit unparalleled strength and love. I have also seen my community, especially the members of our local Mom's Run This Town, rally around this family and lift them up through this difficult time. \nIt may sound silly, but thinking about what this little baby goes through on a daily basis has helped me push through many painful training runs. His strength, and the strength of his mother especially, inspire me daily. For this reason, about a month ago I decided to run this race for Asher, and began fundraising for DEBRA (Dystrophic Epidermolysis Bullosa Research Association) in hopes to raise money for research to find a cure. Honestly, I truly believe that running saved my life, and my hope is now maybe I can use it to help save someone else's. \n— Jessica Eager, Lancaster, Pa. \n'Not afraid of a few hills' \nThis is my first marathon and I chose Baltimore because I love visiting the city and because it is fairly close to me ... The course looked interesting and I am not afraid of a few hills! I particularly love the Inner Harbor and have visited with my family on several occasions, so we decided to get a hotel and see some of the sites while we are here. \nMy goal is to break four hours in the marathon, but also to have a great time taking it all in! \n— Jeanette Knaub, Millersville, Pa. \n'Can't wait to cross the finish line' \nThis is my third marathon but my first time running Baltimore. To be honest, I chose to run another marathon because a bunch of my friends were running one! Several members of our local Moms Run This Town running club are running Baltimore this year, and we had fun training together. I'm looking forward to seeing Baltimore in a new way. I can't wait to cross the finish line with my running buddies! \n— Addie Bird, Lebanon County, Pa. \n'It's home' \nI've never been a runner. I could never complete the 1-mile run in gym class. I attempted the Couch to 5K program several times and quit at Week 5, when they wanted me to run for eight minutes straight. I just couldn't do it. After having three kids, I realized I needed to up my fitness routine and start eating healthier so I could be around as long as possible. \nIn Sept 2013, my husband and I were in the middle of completing T25 when we went to the beach for the weekend with my parents. It was a \"rest\" day, but I decided to go for a run. I had no goal in mind, I just wanted to get in some cardio. Before I knew it, 20 minutes had passed and I was still running. I was shocked at myself and decided from there I'd keep going. So I did. I ran my first 5K in December of that year. In April 2014, I ran my first 10K. In August, I ran my second 10K. In May of this year, I ran my first half marathon (in Ocean City , MD - where my love for running began). \nDuring last year's Baltimore Marathon, all I saw all day long was friends posting about the race and how fun it was and that's when I knew I HAD to do it. So on January 1, 2015, I signed up. I grew up in Baltimore County. I took field trips to Baltimore City for school to learn about our history and I've been proud of Baltimore for as long as I could remember. I was warned about the hills and how tough the course is. And I'm not sure how many times I was asked \"Are you sure you want Baltimore to be your 1st marathon?!\" My answer was always YES! It's home. And what better place to complete something as amazing as this, than at home? \nTraining has been tough. With 3 kids and 2 full time jobs, finding time for running hasn't been easy. I couldn't have done it without the support of my husband, family and friends. I love that my kids are seeing me train and seeing the hard work I do put it. I hope it's setting a great example for them that they can do whatever they put their mind to. Am I ready? Probably not as much as I should be, but yes. And I'm determined. I WILL finish this race. I WILL. Whether I cross the finish line running, walking or crawling, I WILL cross that finish line. And that is my only goal. To finish. I can't wait to cross the FINISH line with a smile on my face, seeing the faces of loved ones and complete strangers smiling back at me. \n— Kristen Harper, New Freedom, Pa. \n'Older ... not old' \nI had suffered some pretty bad injuries to my legs playing soccer a couple of years ago, so my boys (13, 11 and 8) joked that \"Dad was getting old\". I told them that I may be getting older, but I'm not old. \nSo, I promised to prove it to them by zip-lining in the Dominican, sky-diving from 10,000 feet and now running a marathon. Needless to say, the boys (and my wife Sarah) have been impressed with my accomplishments and are my biggest cheerleaders. \nI chose Baltimore because growing up in York, Pa., Baltimore was always one of my favorite cities. As a diehard Orioles fan, I take a lot of pride running in the streets of Charm City. It will be an incredible feeling seeing my bride as I cross the finish line ... and a story to share with my boys (and friends) for years to come! \n— Marcos Emig, Lancaster, Pa. \n'An outlet to reflect' \nAs a kid, running was a painful and dreaded activity for me. We're talking huffing, puffing, red cheeks, crying through a mile in middle school. I used to dabble in hot yoga and while I loved it, my competitive side always left feeling unfulfilled. A coworker of mine at the time was an ultra-runner and would come into the office, beaming from a 20-mile morning run with the most positive outlook on life. As my 25th birthday approached that March, I began pondering what I could do to make my quarter-century memorable and arrived at my answer: 'I'll run my first half-marathon!' \nGrowing up in Montgomery County, I always looked forward to trips to the Inner Harbor, the Aquarium, Campden Yards ... they call it Charm City for a reason. So, when I began looking up races and came across the Baltimore Running Festival, I was sold. Fast forward to a beach weekend in Dewey that Summer, as luck would have it I met my (now) boyfriend who grew up in the suburbs on Baltimore and happened to be training for the full that Fall. \nIn the following months leading up to the event, running became a deep passion of mine and one we could share together. After finishing the half (in just over 2 hours ... 29 seconds [over] to be exact) the feeling of accomplishment was so incredible and I decided that I would train for the marathon in 2015. \nTo quote Ralph Waldo Emerson, \"Life is a journey, not a destination.\" In life and in running, there are ups and downs; it's only through embracing the challenges along our journey that we become better versions of ourselves. This has been a particularly rough year for my family and running gave me a soft place to land and an outlet to reflect. This Saturday, I set out with the goal of running 26.2 in a little over 4 hours. My man will be running as well; while we might not be running together, he gifted me with an engraved bracelet as a constant reminder that I can and will make it to the finish strong, and will have my always supportive and loving family waiting for me at the end! #YGTB \n— Allyson Hartten, Washington", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T17:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T19:09:42.653+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
