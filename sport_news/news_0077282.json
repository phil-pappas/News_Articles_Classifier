It shows the character of this team, shows the fight in this team, and for us to do it against a really, really good team ... it was big for us.\" \nOn Dalton's touchdown run, which came on a quarterback sneak from the Seattle 5, he said he changed the play at the line of scrimmage based on the defensive look Seattle gave him. \n\"Everything was wide open on the inside,\" said Dalton. \"It gave me the opportunity to just to take it myself. It was one of those things where you get those looks, you practice them throughout the week and we got it and executed exactly how we wanted to.\" \nDefense: Adam Jones. \nThe Skinny: This also factors what he did as a punt returner into the equation, but he was also pretty good on defense as well. \nLet's start with what he did as a punt returner, because one of his returns lit the spark to the comeback and his last one lit the spark to the eventual game-winning drive. \nWith the Bengals down 24-7 early in the fourth quarter he returned a Jon Ryan punt 35 yards to the Seattle 33. Four plays later the Bengals scored a TD to close within 24-14. \nIn overtime, his 19-yard return of a 62-yard Ryan punt got the Bengals up to their own 44-yard line to start their second drive, which ended with Nugent's game-winning 44-yard field goal. \n\"He gives us a short field and he energizes everybody,\" said Bengals head coach Marvin Lewis. \nJones isn't always back on punt returns because he plays so much on defense and he didn't return a punt in the first half as he was battling a groin issue entering the game, but he jokingly said there were times he almost fought the coaches on Sunday to allow him to do it. \n\"As the game kept going my groin warmed up and I felt pretty comfortable,\" said Jones. \"We're literally over there fighting every time the ball is kicked just to let you all I know. I have to respect my elders. I just love competing.\" \nJones also had what appeared to be a lengthy return late in the game wiped out in the middle of the return when it was ruled he gave an invalid fair catch signal. Jones was seen waving his arm below his waist, but said he wasn't trying to signal for a fair catch. \n\"I was telling Darqueze (Dennard) just to slide out just so I could have the space to have the one-on-one with the gunners,\" said Jones. \"It was a bad call.\" \nSaid Lewis: \"I think the back judge felt like he was waving for a fair catch when he really was telling our guys to get out of the way, because he was going to return it. It was his natural reaction. It was unfortunate, but we overcame it.\" \nJones very, very rarely ever signals for a fair catch. \nThe penalty marked the Bengals back to their 18, but they were still able to drive for the game-tying field goal in the final 2:07. \nOn defense, Jones had six tackles, a quarterback sack and an interception at the Bengals 2 on Seattle's first drive of the second half. Middle linebacker Rey Maualuga tipped a pass in the middle of the field intended for tight end Jimmy Graham and Jones dove to make the interception. \nCOACHING GRADE \nThe Skinny: Even though the Bengals won in dramatic fashion, hard to give the coaching staff an \"A\" simply because of how poorly the team played in the middle two quarters when they were outscored 17-0 and outgained 239-64, so I'll got with a \"B\". \nKudos to special teams coach Darrin Simmons for having the field-goal unit prepared to get off the final attempt in regulation as the clock ran following Dalton being tackled at the Seattle 13 with 16 seconds left. \nI also have to give credit to Lewis for staying the course and keeping his composure late in the game. \n\"If I'm a screaming idiot,\" said Lewis, \"then I'll have 11 screaming idiots out there.\" \nTHREE THINGS I LIKED \n-- The fourth quarter and overtime defense. \nThe Skinny: The defense allowed the Seahawks just 59 yards and two first downs on five possessions in the fourth quarter and overtime combined. The Seahawks also had a key 10-yard penalty on each of their two possessions in overtime. \n\"I was kind of pissed out there when it was 24-7,\" said Jones. \"I called everybody over and said no matter whatever (blanking) happens just keep playing.\" \nSaid defensive end Wallace Gilberry: \"I think we just got more focused - not saying we weren't focused - but we just had to bite the bullet and realize, 'Hey, this is the fight we've got ourselves in and now we've got to dig ourselves out.' Everybody grabbed a shovel and went to work.\" \nCornerback Dre Kirkpatrick said it was simply a matter of desire. \n\"We were just tired of being in that situation and not overcoming it,\" said Kirkpatrick. \"We wanted to show the world we are a great team, we are a great defense and towards the end of the game we started playing together and a lot of things started rolling.\" \n-- The way the field goal unit kept its poise rushing onto the field with the clock winding down in regulation to be able to attempt the tying field goal. \nThe Skinny: The Bengals were without a timeout when Dalton was tackled at the Seahawks 13 with 16 seconds left, forcing the field goal unit to rush onto the field, get lined up and snap the ball before time expired. The unit did all of that perfectly, and Nugent drilled a 31-yard field goal as time expired to send the game into overtime, tied at 24-24. \n\"It was just great execution,\" said Nugent. \"A lot has to go right for us to get out on the field. The O-line getting up there quick, and then we have to get the snap and hold on time. It was a really good job.\" \nBengals head coach Marvin Lewis said the team practices the situation, \"every two or three weeks.\" \nNugent said a big key for him was being able to take his time to get himself aligned and being able to take the exact amount of steps he needed to kick it. \n\"There's a lot of time where you just have to take an angle back and not have your steps exactly,\" said Nugent. \"You get a feel for where the ball's at and you feel you're in the right spot, but nothing is as exact as taking your steps.\" \nNugent did admit to taking a quick look at the clock as he was getting lined up and saw he had enough time to relax a bit. \n\"As I was aiming I took a peek, which is something I shouldn't be doing, because (holder) Kevin (Huber) does a great job of watching the clock,\" said Nugent. \"He'll tell me if I need to pick it up (from a time perspective). It was a moment where I just had to know.\" \n-- Nugent making two clutch field goals. \nThe Skinny: Not only did Nugent make the 31-yard kick as time expired to force overtime, but he made the 42-yard field goal with 3:26 left in overtime to win it. \nIt came a week after he missed a 44-yard field goal against Kansas City and almost a year ago to the day when he missed a 36-yard attempt on the final play of overtime that caused the Bengals to settle for a 37-37 tie with Carolina. That game was played on Oct. 12, 2014 in Paul Brown Stadium. \nSunday's game-winning kick, the eighth of his career in the final two minutes of regulation or in overtime, glanced off the inside of the left upright and went through. \nNugent said he looked up just as the ball glanced off the upright. \n\"I wanted to make sure I had a good week and kept my head down a lot this week,\" said Nugent. \"Looking at the ball is not going to change what it does, but it might change the process just a little as I hit it. As I looked up it hit the upright and lucky enough it hit the right spot. It's a relief that I saw it hit off and go in. I had to look at Kevin to make sure. I didn't want to go crazy unless I absolutely knew.\" \nNugent's miss against Kansas City actually hit off the left upright, and he missed a 36-yard attempt wide right against San Diego in week two. He also got off to a slow start last season by missing six of his first 17 attempts, but after the miss against Carolina he made 15 field goals in a row before missing a 50-yard attempt in the regular-season finale at Pittsburgh. \n\"I'm extremely lucky to have people around me that are very patient,\" said Nugent. \"I've had some disappointments with the slow starts, and that's the kind of a thing that's happened in my career. I have a coach (Simmons) and the guys close to me. They know it's a team game and that, 'We're going to need you at some point.' I missed a couple early, but the team took care of those misses. Hopefully I made up for that a little bit today.\" \nTHREE THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE \n-- Allowing Seattle running back Thomas Rawls to rush for 169 yards. \nThe Skinny: The undrafted rookie free agent from Central Michigan stepped in for the injured Marshawn Lynch in a big way with his second 100-yard game in the last three games. He had 53 yards on nine carries in the first half, then tallied 98 yards on eight carries in the third quarter alone, including a 69-yard touchdown run. \nOn the touchdown run he started right, cut back left thanks to excellent blocking, then broke a tackle attempt by safety Reggie Nelson around the 25-yard line and ran the rest of the way into the end zone. Nelson attempted to chop down on the ball rather than make a tackle. \n\"Rawls was lights out today,\" said Seattle quarterback Russell Wilson. \"He played physical and ran the ball extremely well. It's not a surprise. The way he practices, it transfers over to the game.\" \nHe was held to 18 yards on six carries after the third quarter and didn't carry the ball at all in the overtime. \n\"We just changed the packages like we often do,\" said Seattle coach Pete Carroll. \"I feel good about the way we ran the football and we didn't leave that.\" \nSeattle rushed for 200 yards as a team, marking the 16th straight game it surpassed 100 yards rushing as a team. \n-- The holding penalty on left tackle Andrew Whitworth that wiped out a 72-yard touchdown pass. \nThe Skinny: On the Bengals' second possession of the game, Dalton connected with wide receiver A.J. Green on a 72-yard touchdown pass, which was called back due to the penalty. \nGreen ran right past cornerback Cary Williams deep up the left sideline, caught the pass and then side-stepped safety Earl Thomas around the Seattle 25 and raced into the end zone. \nDalton would have been 6 for 6 for 174 yards in the first 11 minutes of the game if the penalty hadn't occurred, and the offense went into a funk right after that. \n\"Anytime you get a penalty it can throw you off sync,\" said Lewis. \"Once we cleaned that up we able to get going a little bit.\" \n-- The interception Dalton threw in the end zone late in the first half. \nThe Skinny: With the score tied 7-7 late in the first half the Bengals drove from their 32 to the Seattle 21 where they faced third-and-10 with 1:14 left. Dalton tried to hit Green on an out route near the right front corner of the end zone, but Thomas stepped in front to intercept the pass. \n\"That was my fault,\" said Dalton. \"I took a chance; left the ball inside. It was a bad throw.\" \nIt was just the second interception Dalton has thrown this season. \nTHREE STATS/NUMBERS OF NOTE \n-- 5-0: The Bengals record, marking just the third time in the 49-year history of the franchise that they started a season with that record and the first time since 1988. It also marks the first time since the NFL re-organized divisions starting with the 2002 season and created the current AFC North that any team in the division started a season 5-0. \n-- 1-11-1: Dalton's record in regular season and postseason games combined heading into Sunday's game when he attempted 42 passes or more in a game. He was 1-9-1 in the regular season and 0-2 in the postseason. He attempted 44 passes on Sunday. \n-- 75 percent: The Bengals scored three touchdowns in four \"Red Zone\" trips against a defense that entered the game having allowed just three \"Red Zone\" touchdowns in seven attempts in the first four games. Seattle's defensive \"Red Zone\" percentage of 37.5 percent was tied for second stingiest in the NFL. \nEifert had two \"Red Zone\" touchdown catches, from 14 yards out in the first quarter and 10 yards out in the fourth quarter. He now has five touchdowns this season after missing all but the first quarter of the first game last season due to injury. \n\"He's got unbelievable skills, can go up and make different catches, whether it be over guys or diving (he had a huge 25-yard diving fingertip catc,h on the drive that led to the tying field goal),\" said Dalton. \"It was tough losing him last year and not having him.\" \nThe lone \"Red Zone\" trip in which the Bengals didn't score a touchdown was when Nugent made his game-tying 31-yard field goal/ \nTHREE QUOTES OF NOTE \n-- Bengals head coach Marvin Lewis on the win: \"That was a hell of a fourth (quarter) and fifth quarter. I feel good about the fact we just kept playing - no flinch. We righted ourselves (and) got going, and that's what the football season is all about. It's a long year against a lot of good teams and we've got to keep that up. Today was a good step to understand that we can do that all the time.\" \n-- Offensive tackle Andrew Whitworth on rallying for the win against the two-time defending NFC Champion: \"They've got talented guys everywhere that are good. We've said all along that this was going to be an extremely talented team, but we believe we are, too. Being able to overcome what we did against that kind of talent is a heck of a message.\" \n-- Seattle cornerback Richard Sherman on the decision to move him from his customary left cornerback spot to shadow Green after Green had five receptions for 65 yards and had a 72-yard reception wiped out in the first half due to a penalty (Green had one reception for 13 yards the rest of the game) : \"I think it went fine. There was an opportunity to help the team and coach asked me to do it, so that's what I did.\" \nUP NEXT \nSunday, Oct. 18 at Buffalo Bills, 1 p.m. in Ralph Wilson Stadium, Buffalo. \nThe Skinny: The Bills (3-2) rallied from a 10-0 deficit to win at Tennessee on Sunday, 14-13. They had just 209 yards total offense. The Bills are just 1-2 at home with an opening win over Indianapolis and losses to New England and the New York Giants. They are without standout running back LeSean McCoy, who has a hamstring injury that has no timetable for his return. \nFollow us on Twitter @Local12 and LIKE us on Facebook for updates! \nTo get \"The Skinny\" on local sports be sure to follow Local12 Digital Sports Columnist/Editor Richard Skinner on Twitter @Local12Skinny and LIKE him on Facebook for updates or email him raskinner@sbgtv.com.
