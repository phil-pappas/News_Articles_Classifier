(AP) - A proposal to construct a wind farm in New Hampshire will get a second chance before state regulators.\nNew Hampshire Public Radio reports ( http://bit.ly/1WA6e5Y ) the Site Evaluation Committee has decided that the previously rejected Antrim wind farm has changed its proposal enough to get another shot.\nEolian Renewable Energy's original proposal for the wind farm was for 10 turbines. That would have produced 30 megawatts on the windiest days.\nBut regulators rejected the project in 2013 because of its aesthetic impact.\nThe company's revised plan calls for eliminating one turbine and making another about 46 feet shorter. It would use more powerful turbines so the project could still generate nearly 29 megawatts.\nThe company has until Jan. 24, 2016, to submit a new application.\nInformation from: WEVO-FM, http://www.nhpr.org/\n ", "external_links": ["http://bit.ly/1WA6e5Y", "http://www.nhpr.org/"], "published": "2015-10-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T07:31:06.260+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
