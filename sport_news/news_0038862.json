It was a good performance, dominant, and a nice way to end the qualifying campaign,\" he said.\n\"It would have been a surprise if we had not qualified. But the upcoming friendlies are better, stronger opposition sides. We'll see how we deal with that.\"\nRealistic ambitions\nGiven the lack of strong opposition England encountered in Group E, Hodgson has wisely lined up testing friendlies against Spain, France and Germany as he fine-tunes his squad for the Euros.\nAnd he conceded England will probably have a better idea of what their realistic ambitions should be in the finals once those matches have been played.\n\"We will use the friendlies to learn, to see where we are. If we concentrate and play properly we can do well,\" he said.\nEverton defender Phil Jagielka, who captained England in the absence of Rooney, Hart and Gary Cahill, is looking forward to the opportunity to see how England measure up to some of Europe's elite in the warm-up matches.\n\"We have chosen some really tough friendlies. It will be hard games but we will try to prove ourselves,\" he said.\n\"The gameplan from day one was to win all 10 games and we have done it. We have good youth coming through and hopefully if we can nurture it we could have something special.\n\"No games are easy, especially in international football. We got momentum early in the qualifying campaign and just kept it going and going.\n\"Fair play to the management and the boys. We saw through the job to the last day.\"\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/AO_Sports", "https://www.facebook.com/AhramOnlineSports?fref=ts"], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T16:52:47.430+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
