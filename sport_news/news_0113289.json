Prior to the game, the 11 seniors were honored and thanked for their contributions to the program. “It was just a wonderful evening. The weather was perfect, we had full bleachers of fans, the cheerleading squad came to support, we had the national anthem beautifully sung by a student (Callie Cox), there were gifts, there were pictures, and there were countless memories built. It was a perfect way to end our regular season play. Our parents and supporters really do deserve a lot of praise for making our senior night this year incredible,” Coach Grant Johnston said. “Today was really just a celebration of the careers of these seniors, and what they have put into this program. As a coaching staff we couldn’t be more appreciative of the boys we have this season, and this 2015 team won’t be one that will be quickly forgotten.” It was definitely a senior driven offense as 9 of the 10 Bulldogs goals were scored by seniors. Brock Fuemmeler scored four goals (his fifth hat trick of the season) including the 10th goal that ended the match with 13:35 remaining in the second half. Sam Lee scored two goals (the first goals of the senior’s high school career). Rory McKeown, Sam Hobbs, Ben Miller and Ryan Shopher all scored one goal each. McKeown had a record setting five assists in the match, breaking the single game assist record of four, previously held jointly by Colin Cosby (2013) and McKeown himself (2015). With 16 assists for the current season and district play to go, McKeown is easily within reach of (at least tying) the season record of 17 set by Fuemmeler in 2013. Other assists on the night came from Richard Stamy, Paolo Mercado, Miguel Vega, Miller and Fuemmeler. All three goalies on the roster - Brett Groves, Dylan Goodman and Andrew Kristofferson - spent time between the posts against a Fulton squad that had no more than three credible shots in the match. It was the Bulldogs 11th shutout win of the season. As it was the last home regular season match and senior night, Johnston juggled the line-up at times, moving players to different positions. Groves, for example, got to experience life as a forward, attacking the goal instead of defending it. To his credit, the shots that Groves took on the goal didn’t miss by much. “It’s really easy for defenders to get overlooked as they don’t get on the stat sheet very often,” Johnston said. “It was nice to be able to move them up on the pitch, and watch them perform.” The team ends the regular season with a 15-8 record.
