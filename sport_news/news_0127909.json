Most Spurs fans have staked their tents firmly in the \"championship or bust\" camp, and it appears Vegas has joined.\nAt 4/1, the Spurs have the second-best odds to win the NBA championship, trailing only LeBron's Cavaliers (2/1), who mocked the the luxury tax threshold this summer by spending hundreds of millions to keep the King in a position to compete for a crown.

No Spur has averaged more than 22 a game over the past decade.\nAldridge has seen his scoring average jump from 21.1 to 23.4 over the past three seasons, but that increase hasn't been enough to crack even the top-five.\nThe \"Spurs Way\" isn't built on the back of prolific bucket-getters, rather, it's built on decisive ball movement and singular imagination.

The Spurs were the second-most popular choice, polling at 25 percent to the Cavs' 53.6 percent.\nIn other results, the Spurs were the overwhelming choice as the team that made the best offseason moves, notably adding Aldridge and David West. West finished with Ty Lawson (Houston) and Paul Pierce (L.A. Clippers) as the most underrated offseason signing.", "external_links": ["http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/42/06/8790430/6/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/42/06/8790432/3/920x920.jpg",
