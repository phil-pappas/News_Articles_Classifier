Otago rider Brad Evans has added his name to an elite list by winning the Tour of Tasmania. \nThe 23-year-old finished second in the final stage of the event which was enough to hold off Ben Hill and claim the yellow jersey by 6sec. \n''Previous winners include Richie Porte and Cadel Evans, so I am really happy to add my name to such an illustrious winners' list,'' he said. \n''The Pat's Veg boys have ridden incredibly hard this week ... and I am ecstatic to clinch this win for the team.'' \nEvans enjoyed a 4sec buffer at the beginning of the stage. But with a 6sec bonus available for the winner of the final stage, the race was very much in the balance. \n''I was very nervous beforehand because of the bonuses and we were put under a lot of pressure. My team-mate Robbie Hucker rode incredibly well - he did three laps on the front chasing down attacks and then led me out at the finish.'' \nEvans' next big assignment is in China at the Tour of Hainan later this month. \nHe has signed a trainee contract with Drapac Professional Cycling and will be hoping a good showing at that event will launch his professional career.
