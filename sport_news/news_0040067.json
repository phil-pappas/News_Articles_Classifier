But as the games progressed, Meyer decided it needed to come from someone in the press box, where former offensive coordinator Tom Herman — now coach at No.24 Houston — had perched the past three seasons. \n\nThough Meyer elevated Warinner to coordinator to replace Herman, he still wants Warinner on the sideline to work with the offensive line. Beck, whose previous stint was as coordinator and quarterbacks coach at Nebraska, was the logical choice to have the final say since he is stationed in the press box.\n\n“I don’t know that it’s anything to take away from any other coach, it’s just that I’m upstairs, I see things, I’m away from the crowd, the players, the noise,” Beck said. “You don’t get the emotion, necessarily, drawn into it as you do when you’re down on the sidelines.\n>> Get the most out of college football season, follow @BuckeyeXtra on Twitter \n\n“You’re in that solitary booth, you can think things through, you have the playlist right in front of you. And the suggestions, we write them down in between series, and I just verbalize it to them.”\n\nIn other words, it’s not “rock, paper, scissors, let’s see who wins,” Beck said. The first guideline is the game plan the staff develops through the week.\n\nThen between possessions, the offensive assistants — Beck, Warinner, receivers coach Zach Smith, tight ends coach Tim Hinton and running backs coach Tony Alford — and Meyer have a conversation about what direction they should take on the next series.\n\n“Then, we just go from there,” Beck said. “It’s been interesting, to say the least. I feel like I’m getting more comfortable and understanding things a lot better, and we seem to operating a little bit more smooth.”\nHubbard ‘player of game’ When Sam Hubbard was a strong safety prospect coming out of Cincinnati Moeller, the thought of him making an interception wouldn’t have been far-fetched. But now as a redshirt freshman at Ohio State, he has grown into a defensive end.\n\nHis first college interception came in the fourth quarter Saturday against Maryland after dropping into coverage. \n\n“I got it in my hands and I wouldn’t let go,” Hubbard said. “It was a great moment for me, and I hope it isn’t my last one. I’ll keep working on the ball skills, but it was a special moment.”\n\nMeyer said Hubbard was named the player of the game, and not just for the interception.\n\n“He had a forced fumble, a pass broken up, an interception, the quarterback pressure, two sacks, tackles for a loss (and three tackles total),” Meyer said. “He’s a good young guy, incredible player, incredible future.”\n\n@TIM_MAYsports", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T01:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T08:15:00.972+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
