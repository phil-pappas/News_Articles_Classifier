Shortstop Troy Tulowitzki and catcher Russell Martin aren't far behind. \n\"Our lineup is legit,\" Donaldson said. \"One through nine, I feel like we have probably the best lineup in baseball.\" \nAstros, K.C. similar \nKANSAS CITY, Mo. — When the Houston Astros had recorded the final out in Yankee Stadium on Tuesday night, they flooded onto the field in a wild celebration — making all their years of losing finally a memory. \nIt looked a whole lot like the scene in Kansas City a year ago. \nNow, the long-suffering Astros will try to accomplish what the once-beleaguered Royals did by building on their wild-card victory over the Yankees. They visit Kansas City to begin a best-of-five AL Division Series against the Royals tonight at Kauffman Stadium. \n\"It kind of reminds us of us last year,\" Royals third baseman Mike Moustakas said after a light workout Wednesday afternoon, \"young and hungry and out there trying to prove to everybody that we deserve to be here.\" \nThe Royals certainly accomplished that 12 months ago. \nAfter ending a 29-year postseason drought, the plucky bunch of youngsters went all the way to the World Series, where they fell in seven games to the San Francisco Giants. \nBut it was the Royals' dramatic, extra-inning victory over the Oakland Athletics in their AL wild-card game that instilled in them a belief that they could play with anybody in baseball.
