In eagerly awaited signs of normalcy gradually returning to the village, about 60 km from the national capital, Hakeem, who until a few days ago was thinking of shifting the wedding venue of his daughters, is a relaxed man as he goes about making the arrangements. He is all smiles as the majority Hindus have not only assured him of security of his family and guests but are also actively participating in preparing for the feast, shamiana and other logistics. Bishada had no history of communal disharmony until September 28 when it earned notriety after Mohammed Iqlakh, a 50-year-old blacksmith and handyman, was bludgeoned to death by a frenzied mob following rumours that he and his family had eaten and stored beef. His son Danish, 22, was critically wounded and was out of ICU only a couple of days ago. Sub-divisional magistrate R K Singh said normalcy was gradually returning to Bishada. Around 400 students from various universities of Delhi were today detained when they were trying to take out a protest march to the Prime Minister’s residence in Delhi against the Dadri incident. The students from Delhi University, Jawaharlal Nehru University and Jamia Millia, who were taking out a march from the Mandi House area, were detained by the police at Feroz Shah Road, a senior police officer said. — PTI", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T00:03:18.661+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
