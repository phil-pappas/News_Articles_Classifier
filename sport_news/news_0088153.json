While referee Keith Stroud deemed any contact accidental, he failed to spot what looked a more purposeful trip from the Scotland international on the same player as the two ran back up field together.At the other end Lawrence drilled an effort from the edge of the area which Tom Heaton dealt with down to his left before Barton was involved in another penalty shout, this time at the other end, when Lawrence took a tumble. As before, Stroud remained unmoved.Rhodes' clever movement was causing the two Clarets centre-backs issues and a header from Craig Conway's cross once again narrowly missed the target. The striker did get a sight of goal again before the interval, but, afforded time and space on the edge of the area, he ballooned his attempt well over.At the start of the second half Lawrence wasted a glorious opportunity to score for Blackburn in front of the travelling support.He laid the ball into Rhodes and continued his run, with the Scot unselfishly rolling the ball back into the Welshman, who blazed over when one-on-one with Heaton.The hosts continued to push for an opener, Corry Evans rifling inches past a post and Rhodes, with the best of his four chances yet, hitting a weak attempt straight at Heaton after turning inside Michael Keane in the box.But Blackburn were punished for their profligacy 63 minutes in. David Jones' free-kick was not dealt with by the hosts and Ben Mee teed up Arfield to curl into the top corner of Jason Steele's net for a goal that he celebrated by running the length of the pitch to the Burnley fans.Still Rovers came, Hope Akpan heading a Ben Marshall cross at Heaton, Craig Conway lashing a terrific effort from range against the crossbar and Shane Duffy firing over.And, deep into added time, Duffy, now playing up front, saw his header thwarted by Heaton as Burnley held on.
