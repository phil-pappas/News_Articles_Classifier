I'm not panicking,'' Meyer said. \nMiller had four carries for 11 yards and two catches for 27 yards in the last game against Western Michigan. In the previous game against Northern Illinois, he had no receptions and 7 yards on four carries. \n''I don't think he's getting frustrated,'' Ohio State quarterback Cardale Jones said. ''He feels at home when he's behind center. (He's) just probably trying to get back used to — you have different things when you're in the box than when you're out wide at receiver.'' \nMiller had 140 total yards against Virginia Tech, including a 53-yard touchdown pass from Jones and a 54-yard scoring run. He had eight touches in the game and 10 the following week against Hawaii. \n''That's the receiver's position, it's not quarterback,'' Meyer said. ''He's not touching the ball every down. The good thing about this offense is there's way of doing that. We can do better and we will be better.'' \nThe problem, a good one for Ohio State, is it has a multitude of weapons. In the 38-12 victory over Western Michigan, hybrid backs Jalin Marshall and Curtis Samuel had big games. \nMarshall caught a 37-yard pass for a touchdown and Samuel had a 40-yard scoring run and a 40-yard reception. And, running back Ezekiel Elliott has nine consecutive games of more than 100 yards rushing. Does Ohio State have better uniforms than Michigan? Athlon Sports ranks the B1G's threads. \n''(Samuel) probably deserves more touches,'' Meyer said. ''(Hybrid) Dontre Wilson deserves more touches. Zeke probably needs a few more. Braxton Miller needs a few more.'' \nMiller has taken a few direct snaps but defenses are geared to stop him from running. He sat out last season because of shoulder surgery and although he said he is healthy he has yet to throw a pass. \nMeyer is confident Miller will get comfortable in his new role. \n''He's learning the game,'' he said. ''He's learning how to be a perimeter blocker for the first time in his life. He can't play receiver here and not be great at it. That's the transition he's going through. It takes time.''
