He played the ball inside to Max Kruse, who returned the ball to the midfielder in the box and he stabbed the ball past David de Gea. \nUnited looked for an immediate reply, but struggled to find one. Dante flung himself into the path of Mata's curling strike and diverted the goal-bound shot over the bar. \nAnthony Martial shrugged off his marker and negotiated his way past another before rifling a shot just wide. \nMatteo Darmian put in a crucial block deep inside the home penalty area and United immediately went on the counter. Martial turned his marker and squared to the unmarked Wayne Rooney but he planted the ball into the crowd. \nFinally the nerves eased inside Old Trafford when Mata cut in from the right and swung in a cross which was impeded by Caligiuri's outstretched left arm. Referee Viktor Kassai pointed to the spot and Mata slotted the ball into the bottom left-hand corner. \nUnited had more composure about them in defense after Ashley Young came on for Valencia at half time. \nWolfsburg looked for another early goal, but luckily for United, Darmian was on hand to deny Bas Dost an easy tap in. \nUnited took control of the game eight minutes into the second half. Smalling rolled the ball past Wolfsburg goalkeeper Benaglio, but Mata's contribution was decisive. \nThe Spaniard flicked a wayward pass over the Wolfsburg back four and into Smalling's path. The defender slid in and guided the ball past Benaglio with his right foot. \nCaligiuri tested De Gea with a low shot as Wolfsburg looked for an equalizer, while Nicklas Bendtner and Andre Schurrle came off the bench to add to the Germans' attacking threat. \nBendtner fluffed a good chance just after entering the field and Wolfsburg continued to apply pressure, but United hung on for its first Champions League win under Van Gaal. \nAll content copyright ©2015 The Tribune, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T00:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T00:50:52.831+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
