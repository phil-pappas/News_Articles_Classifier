The amount is part of a 40 billion euros plan staggered from 2014 to 2017 to support French business. Income taxes will be cut by 2 billion euros.\nThe budget is a \"confirmation\" that the government intends to \"put public finances in order\", the government spokesman Stephane Le Foll said Wednesday.\nFrance is trying to bring the deficit within the EU limit of 3 percent of gross domestic product by 2017. The 2016 budget estimates a deficit of 3.3 percent next year, down from 3.8 percent this year.\nSince Hollande's election in 2012, EU authorities have allowed France to twice delay the date by which it would bring its deficit within the EU target.\nThis month, Moody's Investor Service downgraded the credit rating of France from Aa1 to Aa2, its third-highest possible rating. The ratings agency explained that \"French economic growth will remain low over the medium term,\" which will make it harder to heal public finances.\nThe budget plans are based on expectations that the economy, the second-largest in the 19-country eurozone, will grow by 1.5 percent next year, up from about 1 percent this year.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
