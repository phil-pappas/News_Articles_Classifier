(Image Source: Steven Bisig/USA TODAY Sports) \nHere’s a look at the Thursday Night Football matchup between the San Francisco 49ers and the Seattle Seahawks: \nSeries: Seahawks Lead 17-15; Streaks: Seahawks won four of the past five; Last Meeting: Seahawks 17, 49ers 7 (12.14.14) \nTime: 8:30 PM ET; TV: CBS (Jim Nantz, Phil Simms & Tracy Wolfson) \nSpread: Seahawks -6; O/U 42 \nInjury Report: Seahawks: Out: DB Marcus Burley (hand), C Patrick Lewis (ankle), DT Jordan Hill (quadriceps), LB Nick Moody (ankle); Questionable: DE Demarcus Dobbs (shoulder); Probable: OT Garry Gilliam (ankle), DE Cliff Avril (ankle), DE Frank Clark (hamstring), OG Justin Britt (hip), WR Tyler Lockett (hip), SS Kam Chancellor (shoulder), CB Richard Sherman (ankle), MLB Bobby Wagner (pectoral), RB Marshawn Lynch (hamstring), CB Tye Smith (hip) \n49ers : Questionable: WR Anquan Boldin (hamstring), OT Erik Pears (shoulder), RB Carlos Hyde (foot); Probable: OG Alex Boone (shoulder), OT Joe Staley (knee), RB Reggie Bush (calf), LB NaVorro Bowman (shoulder), Ahmad Brooks (shoulder), TE Vernon Davis (knee), WR Bruce Ellington (calf), S Eric Reid (chest), OG Brandon Thomas (ankle), TE Vance McDonald (chest) \nWhere They Stand: The Seattle Seahawks and San Francisco 49ers have represented the NFC in the past three Super Bowls. They haven’t been just the class of the West but the entire conference. Not anymore. Heading into Week 7, the Hawks and Niners are tied for last in the NFC West at 2-4. With a win on Sunday, San Francisco snapped their four-game losing streak, while Seattle has dropped two straight after leading by double digits both times. \nThe Seahawks: In his past six starts against San Francisco, QB Russell Wilson has led the Seahawks to five wins and he’s won three straight on Thursday night with a 117.2 rating. Offseason addition TE Jimmy Graham has been the most productive tight end in the league since 2011 with 384 catches and 4,740 yards (48 TDs are second). WR Doug Baldwin (26 catches, 291 yards) is the leading pass catcher among the wide outs and WR Jermaine Kearse (15.2 YPC) provides a big-play threat. As good as Wilson is the Seattle offense is built around running the football and no one has rushed for more yards since 2011 than RB Marshawn Lynch (6,323 yards, 57 TDs) and he likes to play against the Niners (795 rushing yards, 9 total TDs in past eight). So far this season, rookie Thomas Rawls (5.7 YPC) has been more effective than Lynch (3.3 YPC). Ultimately, the Seahawks made it to back-to-back Super Bowls on the strength of their defense. CB Richard Sherman also performs well against their rivals, with four INTs (2 in the last game), a 90-yard blocked FG TD return and a forced fumble in their past seven meetings. His 26 INTs since 2011 lead the NFL. On the second level, LB’s K.J. Wright (45 tackles) and Bobby Wagner (41) are solid run stoppers, while SAM Bruce Irvin leads them with 3.5 sacks and he’s had a sack in his past two against San Fran. \nThe 49ers: After a rough start to the season, QB Colin Kaepernick has picked it up with consecutive games with a rating of over 100, including a 340-yard, two-TD effort in last week’s win (128.2 rating). Veteran WR Anquan Boldin went over 100 receiving yards in both of those games and offseason addition WR Torrey Smith broke out with a 76-yard TD grab against his former team, the Baltimore Ravens. With Frank Gore in Indianapolis, second-year RB Carlos Hyde has taken over the starting role and he has 14 runs of 10-plus yards this season. The powerful Hyde is complemented by Reggie Bush , who is one of two players in the NFL with at least 5,000 rushing yards (5,472) and 450-plus receptions (467). San Francisco lost several key pieces to their defense in the offseason but it is still built around the linebacking corps, which has been bolstered by the return of ILB NaVorro Bowman from injury (missed the entire 2014 season) and he leads the club with 59 tackles. The man who lines up next to Bowman, ILB Michael Wilhoite , has come on strong with 29 tackles and an INT in the past two games. Coming off the edge, OLB Aaron Lynch has three sacks this season and seven in his past eight home games. \nPrediction: In trending terms…the 49ers are at a better place heading into this TNF contest than the Seahawks are. They fought back after falling behind 13-3 in New York and finally broke through for their second win of the season against Baltimore. They are playing better football. Seattle on the hand, has lost two in a row and if not for a missed call late in their win over the Lions we might be talking about three-straight fourth-quarter blown leads. The faith may be unwarranted and undeserved but I still believe the Seahawks are the better team of the two. Something is amiss in Seattle, that’s obvious, but they’re still a more-talented roster top-to-bottom compared to San Francisco. \nScore: Seahawks 23, 49ers 17 \nDaniel Mogollon is a member of the Pro Football Writers of America and the Football Writers Association of America.
