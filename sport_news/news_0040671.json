(AP Photo/George Bridges) more > By KRISTIE RIEKEN   \nHOUSTON (AP) - The uncertainty at quarterback for the Houston Texans continues after yet another loss. \nFormer Houston star Andre Johnson caught two touchdown passes from Matt Hasselbeck, including one for 2 yards in the fourth quarter, to help the Indianapolis Colts beat the Texans 27-20 on Thursday night. \nReleased by Houston in March after 12 seasons with the team, Johnson had six catches for 77 yards. \nBrian Hoyer, who replaced Ryan Mallett for Houston (1-4) in the second quarter, threw a pass up for grabs that was intercepted by Mike Adams with less than 2 minutes left. \nMallett got the wind knocked out of him on an illegal hit midway through the second quarter and was replaced by Hoyer. Mallett looked to be OK soon after that, but coach Bill O’Brien stuck with Hoyer. He finished with 312 yards passing with two touchdowns. Both of the touchdowns were to rookie Jaelen Strong and they came on his first two NFL receptions. \nHoyer won the starting job out of camp but was benched after Week 1. He came in late in last week’s loss Atlanta, but O’Brien started Mallett again on Thursday. After the game he wouldn’t say who will direct the offense going forward. \n“We’ll review (the film) tomorrow and see where we are at that position,” O’Brien said. \nMallett said he was fine and wanted to return to the game and thought he would. \n“(But) that’s not my call,” he said. “I just do what I’m told.” \nThe Colts (3-2) extended their AFC South winning streak to an NFL-record 16 games. \nThe 40-year-old Hasselbeck was filling in for Andrew Luck, who missed his second straight game with a shoulder injury. Hasselbeck may not have been 100 percent, either, after missing practice Tuesday with an illness. \nJohnson extended the lead to 27-17 with the 2-yard reception with about 10 1/2 minutes left. The Texans intercepted Hasselbeck’s pass in the end zone earlier in that drive, but the play was negated because of defensive holding on Eddie Pleasant. A second penalty, this one for pass interference gave the Colts a first down at the 1. \nDeAndre Hopkins had 11 receptions for 169 yards for Houston. \n“We’re not happy obviously,” J.J. Watt said. “But we’re going to go back to work and figure it out.” \nFoster, who was shaken up in the second quarter but returned after halftime, had 44 yards rushing and 77 yards receiving in his second game back after groin surgery.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T08:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T10:08:30.541+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
