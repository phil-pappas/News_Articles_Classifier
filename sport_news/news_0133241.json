I think we can use the proposals we have as a platform that will be acceptable to everybody.\n\"I haven't spoken to everybody yet but no hand grenades have been thrown at me so I am hopeful.\"\nAmong the key reforms, reached after over two years of talks with major teams and organisers were new three-year licenses that will be granted to a maximum of 18 World Teams for the 2017-2019 seasons.\nThe UCI said it hopes the longer licenses, which will be granted based on ethical, financial, sporting, administrative and organisational criteria, will encourage investment leading to increased stability in team structures.\nCurrent participation rules will be maintained for existing World Tour events but new rules will be set for events seeking to join the World Tour to encourage growth and globalisation.\nStriking a balance between the sport's heritage and seeking out new markets was key for Cookson.\n\"We have to see if we can help cycling grow around the world but at the same time I want to make sure we protect those beautiful things that make our sport what it is,\" said Cookson.\n\"If we try to compress our sport into some sort of formula that might suit the marketing men I don't believe that would be very helpful.\n\"What we are proposing now will allow our sport to grow, allow event organisers to plan more effectively for the future and will allow the teams and their sponsors to plan better.\" ", "external_links": ["https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.toi.reader.activities"], "published": "2015-09-26T18:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T00:34:03.881+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
