Harrell caught one of the three touchdown passes thrown by converted wide receiver Michael Lapeyrolerie. Special photo by John Silas slideshow AUSTELL — South Cobb coach Sherrod Rainge promised a surprise for the Eagles’ fans Friday night, and he didn’t disappoint. Sporting orange alternate jerseys and a new quarterback, South Cobb ran away with a 42-7 victory over rival Pebblebrook on homecoming night at Clay Stadium.Under center for the Eagles (2-3, 1-1 Region 3 ) was wide receiver Michael Lapeyrolerie, who scored three times through the air and once on the ground, on the way to 182 total yards.“We want to have our best players with the ball in their hands, and what better way to do that than to put him at quarterback,” Rainge said. “It seemed like he got the guys excited, and he distributed the ball well, and it’s something we felt really good about (Friday).”In a series that dates back to 1966, South Cobb matched its second-largest margin of victory — the greatest since 1982 — and the second-most points in a game against Pebblebrook.South Cobb scored on the first play of the game when Javaris Harrell hauled in a 45-yard touchdown pass from Lapeyrolerie. The Eagles found the offense again less than 2 minutes later after a Pebblebrook fumble set the Eagles up at the 11-yard line, and Lapeyrolerie found Cincere Mason in the end zone to give the Eagles the 15-0 lead.Pebblebrook (2-3, 0-2) responded with a 14-play touchdown drive that ate up 8:26 of game clock to draw the score to 15-7.Lapeyrolerie wasn’t done, though. Finding a seam on third down, he slipped three tackles on the way to a 50-yard touchdown run that put South Cobb back up by two touchdowns.“I was glad we were able to run the ball out of that formation,” Rainge said. “Any time we get a big play, it ignites our team, and that play spring-boarded us even more.”The Eagles’ defense got on the board when Pebblebrook quarterback Jacobe Burke threw a backwards pass to a bunch formation that was dropped in the second quarter. Cornerback Dorquincy Jordan scooped the loose ball up and returned it 58 yards for a back-breaking touchdown.“We struggled last year on defense,” Rainge said. “It’s really good to see our defense coming together. Our defensive coaches prepared these guys really well, and we know we are going to be in every game.”Mistakes plagued Pebblebrook all night as South Cobb scored 21 points off three turnovers.“We’ve just got to cut down the mental mistakes,” Pebblebrook coach Kevin Saunders said. “The whole game was mental mistake after mental mistake after mental mistake.”The Falcons gained 332 yards of offense while giving back 90 yards on nine penalties. “We just never had any consistency,” Saunders said. “We took a step back (Friday), so I’m really disappointed in that.”South Cobb got into the end zone one more time before the half. After Tyreik Fitzpatrick caught a 40-yard pass to put the Eagles on the 10-yard line, Lapeyrolerie found Jerry Jacobs two plays later to give the Eagles a 35-7 lead at the half.
