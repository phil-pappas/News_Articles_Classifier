Ira Winderman Contact Reporter South Florida Sun Sentinel Few surprises expected with final Heat roster moves \nThe formal deadline is Monday, but NBA regulations have the clock ticking far faster when it comes to the Miami Heat's roster decisions. \nAlthough the deadline for reducing to a 15-player roster is Monday, released players must clear the 48-waiver period before the NBA's 2015-16 salary clock begins Tuesday. \nFor the Heat and most teams, that makes the deadline Saturday's 5 p.m. waiver call, with the Heat currently carrying the NBA-maximum 20 players during the preseason. \nThe five cuts are expected to be formulaic, with Greg Whittington, Keith Benson and Briante Weber expected to transition to the Heat's NBA Development League team, the Sioux Falls Skyforce. Tre Kelley, another expected cut, also is positioned to join the Skyforce. The fifth cut is expected to be John Lucas III. \nUnder the NBA's \"affiliate-player\" rule with the D-League, Whittington, Benson and Weber are expected to then be signed by the Skyforce if they are not claimed by an NBA team. Recently released guard Corey Hawkins also is expected to transition to the Skyforce as a designated Heat affiliate player, with NBA teams allowed to designate up to four such players. Such players must finalize their 2015-16 D-League commitments by Thursday. Spoelstra: No plans to tinker with starting lineup \nErik Spoelstra says the plan is to stick with Whiteside, Deng, Bosh, Wade, Dragic as his starting five for the foreseeable future. \nErik Spoelstra says the plan is to stick with Whiteside, Deng, Bosh, Wade, Dragic as his starting five for the foreseeable future.

The NBA operates on a 170-day regular-season salary calendar.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T22:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T00:08:14.631+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
