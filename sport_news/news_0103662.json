( Kathryn Scott Osler, The Denver Post ) \nFormer Colorado State and Broncos running back Kapri Bibbs will finally get his shot Sunday versus Cleveland. The Broncos announced they activated Bibbs Saturday and waived tight end Richard Gordon. \nBibbs had spent the first five games on Denver's practice squad, but with Juwan Thompson (hamstring) questionable for Sunday's game Bibbs was needed to be the third running back. \n\"I told them not to give me a chance because if I get one I'll do everything in my power to make sure that I stay on this roster,\" Bibbs said Thursday. \nThe 5-foot-11, 203 pound speed back said he played on all of the starting special units in place of Thompson in practice all week.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T19:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T19:33:41.265+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
