If they were open at all, it wasn’t for very long. \n“We couldn’t get off the ball, we couldn’t get off whatever they were doing to us,” USD coach Joe Glenn said. “If they’re going to let it go like that, we better find a way to practice against it. It’s totally what you see – it’s vogue in football now, people get up and in your face. It’s street ball and we didn’t handle it. We didn’t handle it at all.” Buzz kill: Penguins spoil homecoming for Coyotes \nIt was an obvious point of frustration that receivers were not able to separate themselves from the Penguins. Fans – and you’d have to assume coaches – were on the officials all day for YSU’s aggressive coverage. \n“Some call it loose and let it go and some tighten it up,” Glenn said. “Today it played into Youngstown’s hands. I’m not complaining about the officiating. I’m just saying that it worked out for Youngstown. They took every advantage of it to defend the passing game.” \nPRAISE FOR VAN GINKEL \nRedshirt freshman defensive end Andrew Van Ginkel continued to emerge as a defensive standout on Saturday, sacking quarterback Hunter Wells while finishing with three tackles-for-loss overall. While the Coyotes lost by 28 points, they did play well defensively most of the way, giving up 302 yards overall while holding down Penguin running backs Martin Ruiz and Jody Webb. \n“The guy plays hard,” Glenn said of the 6-4, 230-pound former Rock Valley (Iowa) all-state defensive back. “He’ll give you every bit of effort he’s got and he’s just going to get better and better and better. He played about every position in high school except defensive end. He’s going to give you everything he’s got.” \nTURNOVER ISSUE \nThe Coyotes never appeared to be threatening a momentum swing after going down 17-0 on Saturday, but turnovers didn’t help much. The most glaring error happened on an attempt to field a punt in the second half that led to a fumble and a 2-yard touchdown run from Ruiz that made the score 24-0. \nPaul Anderson, a redshirt freshman who has invigorated the Coyotes’ return game, tried to field a punt inside the Coyote 5-yard-line. He fumbled, Youngstown recovered and scored on the next play. \n“Paul wanted to make a play for the team so he drifted back to the 1-inch line and then dropped it,” Glenn said. “He shouldn’t have tried that, we all know that. He knows better but he was a guy trying to make a play in a game where we needed one made.” 1 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://argusne.ws/1LcMEJm TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T03:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T14:10:05.456+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
