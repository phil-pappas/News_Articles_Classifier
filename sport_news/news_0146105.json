BolinArkansas News Bureau - ebolin@arkansasnews.com \nFAYETTEVILLE – The Purple Dogs versus the Red Dogs. One of the oldest rivalries in Arkansas High School football. That’s what Dre Greenlaw was preparing for at this time last year. \nGreenlaw was a ball-hawking, hit-laying safety for Fayetteville High School. At 6-foot, 200 pounds, he had the size for Division I, even Football Bowl Subdivision Football. His hometown university hadn’t offered, though. So Greenlaw was committed across the state, in Jonesboro, to Arkansas State. His dad, Brian Early, was an assistant there. \nBut that was a year ago. Now the freshman is the second-leading tackler for an SEC program. Just so happens to be the same SEC program that was a little late to courting him – Arkansas. \nOver the last calendar year Greenlaw has transformed himself from a safety to a linebacker. And a starting linebacker at that. Now he and the Razorbacks are preparing for Alabama this week. It’s a modest step up from Springdale High School. And if someone would have asked him that year ago, or even six months ago, if he thought he’d be at this point, he’d have told you no. \n“I don’t think the coaches did either,” Greenlaw said. “Just coming in a little bit under-recruited and coming from a different position I just told myself in order for me to play, actually play here, I’m going to have to be physical. I just came in with the mindset I just have to be physical and run as much as possible.” \nFayetteville High School is literally 100 yards, if that, from the edge of the University of Arkansas campus. The distance between Harmon Field, where Greenlaw roamed the secondary for the Bulldogs, and Donald W. Reynolds Stadium, where plays weakside linebacker for the Razorbacks, is a 13-minute walk. \nCoincidentally, the only person keeping Greenlaw from the top of the tackles leader charts at Arkansas is another Fayetteville High product, Brooks Ellis. Go a step deeper into the happenstance hole – Ellis’ defensive coordinator in high school was Early. \nEllis has 34 tackles. Greenlaw has 29. Greenlaw’s been a starter for three games. Two of his tackles have come for a loss and he has a quarterback hurry. \n“Everybody has an assignment to do and I just make sure I do my assignment,” Greenlaw said. “Every now and then, with the way our defense is set up, the WILL (weakside linebacker) is allowed to make a lot of plays so I’m just able to run around and make a lot of plays.” \nGreenlaw has filled the shoes of departed weakside linebacker Martrell Spaight admirably. Spaight led the SEC in tackles from that spot last year. Ellis began the year there after moving from his traditional spot in the middle. Things weren’t working elsewhere along the unit, though, and Greenlaw was continually forcing the issue with his coaches. His play was too good to be left alone on the sidelines and simply let develop. \nUltimately Ellis moved back, Khalia Hackett moved out of the starting lineup and Greenlaw slid in. Now, even as Arkansas runs a five-defensive back set with just two linebackers for most of its defensive formations, it’s Greenlaw and Ellis who find themselves on the field more often than anyone else among the linebackers. \n“Those two guys have kind of connected a little bit. You’ve got the old guy and the young guy. The old bull and the young bull,” linebackers coach Vernon Hargreaves said. “One’s trying to lead the other and trying to get him to understand everything. It’s all about trust, believing in the other guy.” \nGiven their mutual past, that shouldn’t be a problem.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T07:27:51.178+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
