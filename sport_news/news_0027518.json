It kind of sounds like, to me, they think Chaz (Williams) is really the majority of what we have, to be honest with you.\" \nBut at this year's media day held at the Barclays Center Tuesday, Kellogg sounded like a new man. Or least, a man who understands his team — which was picked 10th out of 14th teams and didn't feature a single player on any of the four all-conference squads – has some fairly low outside expectations as it tries to replace key pieces with a host of new and inexperienced players. \n\"Obviously, no one wants to be picked 10th or whatever it might,\" Kellogg said. \"But at the same time, with the turnover we had with Cady being the 55th pick in the draft and Derrick Gordon transferring and Maxie (Esho) moving on to greener pastures, I think it's a good starting point for us. \n\"I'm hoping that our guys look at it and say 'All right, this is where we are today, but by the time the league season rolls around, we can make some noise against the teams that were picked ahead of us.'\" \nKellogg, as is required under the international bylaws of coachspeak, added that he's not really worried about Atlantic 10 play or where the team was picked to finish in a poll that is rarely, if ever, proven right come March. Kellogg cares about installing plays, practicing defense and preparing for Howard and the start of the non-conference schedule next month. \nThere's a long way to go before the league games start to count in January. Kellogg understands that getting there could be a bumpy ride. \n\"I realize that we do have a lot of young guys in key positions on our team that have to come along and come along pretty quickly,\" he said. \"But I'm excited. I think we've got some guys that can step into that next category, whether it's Trey (Davis), Donte (Clark), Jabarie (Hinds). We were pretty effective last year early when Seth Berger was healthy and I'm looking forward to that being the case again. Zach Coleman, (Antwan) Space and the big guys have to do what I think they're capable of doing for us to jump up the ladder. \nThose two big men are at or near the top of any list of questions surrounding this year's team. \n\"You wonder how fast Rashaan Holloway or Malik Hines can come along,\" Kellogg said. \"Is Antwan Space going to fit into our lineup? Is Zach Coleman staying healthy? How good is Donte Clark going to be? Are Trey, Jabarie and C.J. where they should be? There are a lot of questions that need to get answered, but I do like that we have guys that can fill those roles.\" \nSo what about motivation then? Does Kellogg need to tack the preseason poll up in the new Champions Center locker room to remind his players that the league's media and coaches lumped them in with the likes of Duquesne and Saint Louis? \nSurprisingly, no. \n\"I don't think we need as much motivation this year. I would say that our guys realize that we need to get better and improve,\" Kellogg said. \"Not having a guy anywhere near any all-conference team or being picked 10th, if you're a player, you get motivated by that without the head coach having to remind you. \n\"Our guys have seen some of the media stuff on a national level and also in the A-10. And they realize what people maybe think about them individually and as a program and a team. I think that could be a motivating factor just by it being out there, more so than me having to bring it up.\" More from Atlantic 10 basketball media day", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T01:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T01:40:17.778+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
