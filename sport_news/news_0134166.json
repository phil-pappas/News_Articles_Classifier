The Confederation for Brazilian Football had wanted the ban enforced only at the next Copa America. \nCAS says the reasons for its decision to reject the CBF appeal will be published at a later date. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T14:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T14:55:42.333+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
