For a nuts-and-bolts look, here is the breakdown .\nScroll down for a guide of 5 things to know for Saturday night:\nDon't blink or you'll miss it\nLock in on Leonard and don't take your eyes off of him. He could be done by halftime and most likely will be cooling off in the fourth quarter. Fournette is matched against the worst rushing defense in the nation this week and it just doesn't seem fair. Surely, Les Miles will take it into consideration. I've got the over/under on his carries at 12.5 with it being somewhere between 10 and 15. LSU has plenty of unused firepower in Darrel Williams, Derrius Guice and Nick Brossette. David Ducre' might even get into the game, as well as a host of the other freshmen.\nLes Miles not thinking about playing backups Saturday | Video LSU coach Les Miles talks to the media after Wednesday's practice.\nFournette probably needs a break, not so much for how he's feeling now, but for what is ahead. He's averaging nearly 25 carries per game and that's probably high for what coach Les Miles and the offensive staff want to see at the end of the season.\nMiles wants him fresh for the games that matter most, and there is only one more non-conference game after Saturday – Western Kentucky in three weeks,. After that comes a bye week and the November gauntlet of games: at Alabama, Arkansas, at Ole Miss and Texas A&M.\nThe longer the season goes and the more the momentum builds for the team and Fournette's Heisman Trophy hopes, the more savage the defenses he will face. Florida is going to be gunning for him in two weeks with the league's third-best run defense, behind Alabama and Arkansas, which also get their turn. Let the guy exhale a little bit this week.\n'A rising tide lifts all boats'\nThere is something to say about the overall Fournette Effect. His play inspires his teammates and makes them want to be great, and do great things on the football field. His demeanor as a leader makes the team closer and makes even the least-used player feel included. Equipment managers manage better, trainers train better, even Doug Aucoin will probably produce the best, sharpest game tapes of his career. Fans will kick up their fan speed a few notches, and the tailgating. . . well, I won't even go there.\nBut LSU athletic director Joe Alleva has got to be loving this. A nondescript October non-conference game suddenly takes on a new title as a viewing opportunity to see the great Fournette. Only four more chances this season to see him in person in Baton Rouge after Saturday. After seven local appearances next year, he'll be gone forever.\nHe's going to put a lot of eyeballs in the stadium that might otherwise opt for the comfort of their living room or tailgate. And what about ESPNU? It's got to be like Christmas Day for the bottom rung of the ESPN family of networks. The longer Fournette plays, the better chance \"the U\" wins the viewing sweepstakes. Last week, the LSU-Syracuse game was the network's No. 1 game despite starting at 9 a.m. on the West Coast. \"The U\" can dream.\nAbout that Brandon Harris guy. . .\nIt's hard to remember when Brandon Harris' name was being thrown around as often, and maybe more, than Fournette's is. That was four short weeks ago. But Fournette has provided his recruiting classmate with a huge assist – taking the offensive burden and the media attention.\nMeanwhile, Harris has been very good, although not spectacular. This might be a chance for him to roll out some of his new game and show how good he is. He has been quietly efficient but in the background. If Fournette is going to take a step back, Harris could take two forward and build up some numbers.\nHis confidence is apparent and his fundamentals look sound. He's making better decisions, which show up in what he doesn't try to do moreso than what he does. No interceptions. He has thrown 76 passes without a pick since his Hail Mary for the win -- in the loss to Mississippi State last year -- was plucked out of the air.\nLess Leonard Fournette for LSU vs. E. Michigan? | Vlog LSU beat writer Jim Kleinpeter and columnist Ron Higgins preview LSU vs. Eastern Michigan.\nThe numbers aren't impressive but Harris' play has been strong and it is going to pay off for LSU if he keeps it up. To contain Fournette, future opponents will have to tweak the defense and bring more defenders closer to the line of scrimmage. If Harris could get some help from his receivers – they dropped four passes last week – it will happen sooner.\nExpect to see more action from Harris on Saturday. It's the ideal opportunity to open up the playbook and let him take some shots on plays that have been kept locked up. It will do Harris some good in the short run and the Tigers a big benefit in the long run.\nSuperman before halftime, Clark Kent after\nIs the LSU defense stepping into a phone booth at halftime -- backwards? Through three games the recurring pattern is to stonewall the opposition only to have it rally after halftime. LSU has played like superheroes allowing six points – two field goals -- in the three first halves. In the second, foes have scored 58 points on eight touchdowns and two field goals.\nThe yardage is also uneven with a three-game total of 272 in the first half compared to 647 in the second. Opposing offenses are more than doubling up in the second half and that has to be a trend worrisome to the defensive staff.\nTrue, the offense has an effect, and so have penalties. The defense has had a couple of games where it spent a lot of time on the field. That shows up in the second half. Last week, the defense contributed with some awful penalties.\nWhen LSU's offense becomes more balanced, this could clear up and go away. In every game, LSU has been on the verge of a knockout blow and never really could pull it off. Even against Auburn when the Tigers led 24-0 at the half, the visitors kept answering with touchdowns.\nWith a better passing attack, LSU will be better equipped to finish off touchdowns drives rather than punt or kick field goals. It also might suggest that the new defense under Kevin Steele, which plays aggressive by nature, backs off a bit in the second half when it does have a lead.\nLSU has been much more aggressive with a variety of blitzes. Playing it soft may be advisable when the lead is big enough. We may not know for sure until LSU goes to South Carolina because Eastern Michigan is more likely to struggle in the early going until LSU begins substituting.\nPunter on the barbie\nThe charm is off the Aussie punting pipeline, at least for now. Senior Jamie Keehn is in a funk that would send Crocodile Dundee screaming into the Outback. After a 44.9 yards average last year and preseason accolades that came his way, Keehn is averaging 38.8 yards per kick and it hasn't been pretty.\nHe shanked a 13-yarder and nine of his 17 attempts have gone shorter than 40. Last week, low kicks resulted in returns of 28 and 16 yards. Even coach Les Miles, who hardly looks at punters and claims he doesn't speak Australian, noticed and is leaving it up to Keehn and special teams coach Bradley Dale Peveto.\nLeonard Fournette to romp again: Talkin' Tigers Leonard Fournette should have another huge day, Jim Derry and LSU columnist Ron Higgins say when LSU plays Eastern Michigan game Saturday.\nBut everyone knows Peveto is more concerned with the LSU linebackers. Specialists get low levels of attention because what they do is so . . . specialized. Like a golfer, it's all in the swing. In football, it's the leg rather than a club.\nKeehn was primed to have a good season after being named to the Ray Guy watch list and getting named second team All-SEC. He talked in August of his issue of trying to be too perfect. He's shown on numerous occasions his leg strength is as good as any. It would be more of a worry if Brandon Harris was having this kind of issue. It will help certainly to be kicking in Tiger Stadium but this little koala bears watching.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T15:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T02:53:33.026+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
