RYAN ABELLA/Miner Lee Williams football coach Eugene Kramer looks out onto the field during Friday�s game at Kingman High School. Miner Staff Reporter KINGMAN - An 0-5 start apparently prompted a coaching shakeup for the Lee Williams High Volunteers.Eugene Kramer continues to be listed as head football coach, but he said he doesn't believe he is, from his perspective, and he didn't act like the head coach Friday when the Volunteers took on Kingman Academy.\"I'm not the head coach,\" Kramer said during Lee Williams' 38-21 win over the Tigers at Kingman High School.Kramer was then asked what he was.\"I don't know what I am,\" he said. \"A spectator who helps out at practice, I guess.\"For the last couple of weeks, assistant coach Ray Smith has been the voice of the Volunteers when speaking with the Daily Miner.\"It's just been a reassignment,\" Smith said. \"We're trying to regroup. We haven't lost any coaches and we're trying to figure it out. We were 0-5.\"Since then Lee Williams is 2-0, beating Kingman High and Kingman Academy.\"I don't think we have a head coach,\" he said. \"To be honest with you, I think we're all doing our jobs. If it's anybody, it's him (Kramer).\"Smith spoke about the issues facing the Lee Williams coaching staff.\"We had a little problem and we're going to work those out,\" he said. \"Hopefully, we're going to go on in a positive way from here. But we're all doing the same things we had been doing. I'm just running the sidelines a little bit. We've just kind of have changed roles. I'm doing a little more with the practice planning and sidelines.\"Lee Williams hosts Mohave in its Homecoming game at 7 p.m. Friday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T15:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T18:54:40.613+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
