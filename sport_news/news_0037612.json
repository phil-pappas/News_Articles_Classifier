Steve Patterson's 22-month reign of terror on the Forty Acres is over. The Era of Good Feelings is back. For better or worse, even Lance Armstrong is back.\nBut is Texas football?\nClose, but not yet.\nOnly a missed extra-point try spoiled a spectacular comeback directed by Jerrod Heard, making just his second collegiate start, in Texas' 45-44 loss to Cal before a stunned 91,568 at Royal-Memorial Stadium. Heard rallied the Longhorns from a 21-point deficit with a school-record 527 yards total offense, conjuring the kind of quarterback performance fans hadn't seen since Colt McCoy. Maybe even Vince Young.\nHeard might have run right into Longhorns lore when his dazzling 45-yard touchdown burst with 1:11 left brought Texas within a point, as well as overtime.\nBut Nick Rose shanked his kick wide right, to disbelief all around.\nAs Cal coach Sonny Dykes put it, \"I'm still in a little bit of shock.\"\nAnd your impression, Charlie Strong?\n\"I hope this,\" he said, \"is one that turns the corner for us.\"\nTexas' head coach can afford to be optimistic because of the performance of Heard, who went toe-to-toe with Cal's Jared Goff, a three-year starter and early favorite to become the first quarterback drafted next spring. Heard's feet and charisma give Texas hope for better days.\nJust not Saturday. Or next Saturday.\nOr a couple of Saturdays after that.\nLife for the Longhorns won't get a lot better until they learn how to plug up a running game. They came in 111th in the nation against the rush, and their standing won't improve after the Golden Bears trampled them for 280 yards and three rushing touchdowns.\nThe good news from here on out is they won't face any quarterbacks better than Goff. Before the game, Vance Bedford, Texas' defensive coordinator, compared him to Aaron Rodgers. Goff â” whose father, Jerry, had a couple moments with the Astros in the '90s â” passed for 268 yards and three touchdowns.\nAs crazy as it may seem, Texas' defense was at its best when Goff dropped back. The front collapsed the pocket, chased Goff and stripped him once, setting up a first-half touchdown.\nWhat turned the momentum of the game was Dykes' prudent decision to run first, not second. Dykes, Spike's kid, more closely resembles his mentors, Hal Mumme and Mike Leach, in offensive style. They don't call his offense \"Bear Raid\" for nothing. But, down 10 points late in the first half Saturday, Sonny took a page from his old man.\nSpike was a defensive coordinator at heart, and the oldest maxim in football is you have to stop the run first. The rule applies even now, when a bubble screen stands in for a fullback dive.\nThe Bears ran like ... well, like Rice, which manhandled Texas up front the week before.\nLet me ask you: When would you have imagined Texas getting run over in back-to-back weeks by the likes of Rice and Cal?\nBetter question: What happens when they come up against TCU's Trevone Boykin or Oklahoma's powerful Samaje Perine?\nIf Strong still must find a way to shore up his defense, Texas seems to have patched up a few relations with the dwindling faithful. Perrin, who lettered on Darrell Royal's late '60s teams, stepped in as interim athletic director in place of Patterson, relieved of duty just moments ahead of the coup.\nPerrin didn't have to do much to improve upon Patterson's personal style. A simple acknowledgement of other humans would suffice.\nPerrin didn't leave it at that. He may be a terrific Houston lawyer, but he's Mr. Rogers as an athletic director. He was everywhere before the game, beaming, moving from tailgate to tailgate and interview after interview.\n\"I've seen friends from all over,\" Perrin said. \"Made a lot of new ones.\"\nOne group he met enthusiastically Saturday was the Texas team bus, where he shook hands with the head football coach. He said he wanted to show his support, which might have seemed questionable going in.\nImagine Strong's status if he hadn't gone with Heard over Tyrone Swoopes last week. Without Heard's dramatic play Saturday, it could have really gotten ugly keeping up with Cal's offense.\nAsked what's wrong with his defense, Strong said, \"There's so many things that need to be fixed.\"\nNo arguments here about that. At least he's found a quarterback. And his new boss is a teddy bear.\nNow if Texas can just get the football field's namesake, Joe Jamail, to come back, too, the rest is good.\nFollow Kevin Sherrington on Twitter @KSherringtonDMN.\nSherrington: 45-44 loss to Cal shows UT has lots to fix, but Strong has found a QB\nCarlton: Heard puts on a show, but ...
