Brown removed from roster, can become free agent Ryan Lawrence Posted: Monday, October 19, 2015, 3:17 PM \nDomonic Brown is eligible for arbitration this winter for the second straight year. The likelihood that he was going to be tendered a contract wasn't strong. \nBut the Phillies got ahead of the process a couple of months early. \nBrown was among four players outrighted off the 40-man roster on Monday. He can elect to become a free agent. \nThe 28-year-Brown, an All-Star in 2013, was joined by former top catching prospect Tommy Joseph, former top pick Kelly Dugan, and Brian Bogusevic as players outrighted by the Phillies on Monday. More coverage WATCH: Daily fantasy baseball updates \nBrown, rated as the top prospect in all of baseball by Baseball America in July of 2010, one spot ahead of Mike Trout, hit .272 with an .818 OPS and 27 home runs in 139 games in 2013. But he struggled to reconnect with his productivity in the next two seasons: Brown hit .233 with a .634 OPS and 15 home runs in 207 games in 2014 and 2015. \nBrown, who hit .228 with 5 home runs in 63 games with the Phillies this season, ended the year on the disabled list after suffering a concussion on Sept. 2 in New York. \nIt was Brown's second trip to the disabled list in 2015. He began the year on the DL and was optioned to Triple-A when he returned to health. Brown was out of options at the time, cleared waivers, and accepted an assignment to Lehigh Valley. \nHe is likely to opt for free agency in the coming days.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T00:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T00:54:58.957+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
