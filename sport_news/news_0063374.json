Game time is 8:25 pm EDT and the game is on \"Thursday Night Football\" on CBS with announcers Phil Simms and Jim Nance along with sideline reporter Tracy Wolfson.\nThis is a big game for both these teams as they both try to get on track this season after opening with identical 2-4 records. If either team has playoff hopes for the 2015 NFL season they better win this game. The percentage of teams who start a NFL season at 2-5 and then make the playoffs is very low.\nSeattle Seahawks -6 at San Francisco 49ers (O/U is 42 points) Even though both teams have started off this season with identical 2-4 records and the Seattle Seahawks are on the road, the Seahawks are still favored by six points over the 49ers on \"Thursday Night Football\" this week. After dropping their first two games of the season to the St. Louis Rams and the Green Bay Packers, the Seattle Sehawks then beat both the Detroit Lions and the Chicago Bears to even their record at 2-2. But then the Seahawks dropped their next two games to the Bengals and the Panthers.\nIn fairness to the Seahawks, it should be pointed out that the four teams that beat Seattle have a combined record of 19-3. The Packers, Bengals and Panthers are all still undefeated this season.\nThe 49ers opened the season with a solid 20-3 win over the Minnesota Vikings, but then San Francisco dropped four straight games to the Steelers, Cardinals, Packers and Giants. Those four teams have a combined record of 17-7. So both the Seahawks and the 49ers have been losing games to the better teams in the NFL this season.\nThe two teams the Seahawks beat this year are a combined 3-9 while the 49ers two wins came vs teams who are a combined 4-7. So we have two teams facing off this week who have lost to the better teams in the NFL in 2015, and who have both beaten teams with bad combined records. Something will have to give this week as these two teams face each other.\nSeahawks QB Russell Wilson comes into this game with a career record of 38-16 as a starting QB in the NFL. Colin Kaepernick of the 49ers has a career record of 27-18 as a NFL starter. So both of these quarterbacks have records as proven winners in the NFL. On paper, most fans would probably think the Seahakws should be a bigger favorite than six points in the game but looking over the records of the two teams and who they each beat and lost to, the spread looks about right.\nThe over/under for the game is 42 points. Seattle has averaged 22 points scored per game, while the 49ers have averaged 17 points scored per game. The Seahawks are giving up 21 points per game and the 49ers are giving up 27 points per game so far this season.", "external_links": ["http://www.49ers.com/schedule/season-schedule.html", "http://www.footballlocks.com/nfl_odds.shtml", "http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/eye-on-football/25158041/nfl-thursday-night-football-television-schedule-announced", "http://espn.go.com/nfl/team/schedule/_/name/sea/seattle-seahawks"], "published": "2015-10-20T23:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T00:29:28.420+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
