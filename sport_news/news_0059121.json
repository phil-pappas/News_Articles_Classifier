They were very, very lucky,\" said Scholle, adding that the home did not have a carbon monoxide detector.\nThe couple, described as in middle-age, was flown to an undisclosed hospital for treatment in a hyperbaric oxygen chamber.\nFire Chief George Bridges said the incident remains under investigation, but a preliminary review indicates that the CO may have come from a faulty exhaust fan.\n\"We continue to stress the need for smoke detectors and carbon monoxide detectors to be installed in all homes,\" Bridges said in a statement.\nThe Waukegan Fire Department offers free combination smoke/CO detectors to interested homeowners at educational community events. This year, the department is giving away 50 combination detectors at no cost. Anyone interested in getting one can call the Fire Prevention Bureau at (847) 249-5410.\n\"If there is a fire in your home, smoke spreads fast and you need smoke alarms to give you time to get out. In fact, having a working smoke alarm cuts the chances of dying in a reported fire in half,\" Bridges said.\nNoting that October is Fire Prevention Month, Scholle said this year's message was getting people to install smoke alarms or combination detectors in each separate sleeping area in a home. There should be one on every level of a home, including the basement, fire officials said.\n\"The message is hear the beep where you sleep,\" Scholle said.\nA Highland Park couple died of CO poisoning in June after their keyless car was left running in the garage, according to the Lake County authorities. The last CO-related death in Waukegan was in March 2012.\nfabderholden@tribpub.com\nTwitter @abderholden\nCopyright Â© 2015, Lake County News-Sun Waukegan", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-562923c6/turbine/ct-lns-waukegan-carbon-monoxide-victims-st-1023-20151022"], "published": "2015-10-22T20:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T21:26:07.855+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
