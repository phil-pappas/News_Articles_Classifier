Danny Logan capped the methodical march with a 4-yard run.\nRobert LeFevre made a 48-yard field goal for Davidson on its first series.\nThe Golden Bears maintained control until early in the second quarter.\nDavidson, facing fourth and 1 at its own 29, gambled and went for it. Ryan Royer broke through the line and sprinted 71 yards for a touchdown, changing the complexion of the contest.\nOn UA's next series, quarterback Vince Murdocco mishandled an errant shotgun snap and Davidson's Zac Uphouse recovered near midfield.\nThe Wildcats cashed in, driving 56 yards in 11 plays for their second score, a 1-yard run by Royer with 1:54 left in the half. The extra point kick was blocked, leaving the score 16-7.\nUA squandered a great scoring chance in the third quarter when Logan fumbled into the end zone on third and goal and Davidson's Dre Rodriguez recovered.\nThe Wildcats averted two other threats when UA missed a 28-yard field goal and they held on fourth down and 2 near midfield.\nResults Hamilton Township 55, Fairfield Union 13: Trey Johnson ran for three touchdowns and scored a fourth on a kickoff return for host Hamilton Township (4-2, 2-1 Mid-State League) in a win over Fairfield Union (3-3, 1-2).
