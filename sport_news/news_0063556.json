I was happy to see him being able to get a chance to do that, especially toward halftime.”Jenkins’ longest run of the night came at the end of the first half as he broke a pair of tackles before spinning past a would-be tackler and sprinting to the end zone for an 80-yard touchdown as time expired. The score gave the Cardinals a 19-0 lead at the half.Osborne extended its lead in the fourth quarter as quarterback Deon Alexandre connected with Ayo Ashi for a 37-yard score. The Cardinals led 26-0 with 8:40 remaining in the game.Johnson’s only score of the night came from Eric Gallardo as he took the handoff and bounced up the left side of the field for a 36-yard touchdown. Osborne led 26-6 with 3:05 to go in the fourth quarter.Larry White put the game away for the Cardinals late in the fourth quarter with a 59-yard touchdown run with 2:00 remaining. “It was good to see us finally execute on both sides of the ball like we did (Friday),” Jones said. “I think this win kind of signifies the type of team we have. For our seniors, they persevered through a long tenure as far as not having a lot of success on the football field. To have a win on homecoming night, in front of a packed house, shows a lot of resilience and resolve for those young men.”Osborne’s offense got started on its first possession as the Cardinals drove the ball 65 yards, capped by Alexandre’s 8-yard touchdown pass to Adarian Thompson in the back corner of the end zone. The Cardinals led 6-0 with 8:30 to go in the opening quarter.The Cardinals extended their lead in the second half as Jenkins broke a 36-yard touchdown run to give Osborne a 12-0 lead with 6:50 to go in the second quarter.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T10:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T10:07:21.908+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
