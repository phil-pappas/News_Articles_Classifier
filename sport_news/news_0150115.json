(AP) By the time Connor Cook solidified his hold on Michigan State's quarterback job in 2013, the Spartans had spent 1 1/2 seasons trying to replace Kirk Cousins. \nNow, Cook has won 27 games as the starting quarterback, matching Cousins' mark at the top of the school's career list. He'll have a chance to move ahead this weekend. \nCook will try to set the record Saturday when the second-ranked Spartans host Purdue in the Big Ten opener for both teams. Since Cook took over as the No. 1 quarterback early in the 2013 season, Michigan State has won a conference title, a Rose Bowl and a Cotton Bowl. He's 27-3 as the starter. \nHis win total reflects how successful the Spartans have been as a team, and how well Cook has directed the offense.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T09:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T09:19:07.702+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
