We're here to win. We're not accepting losing; we're handling it.\"\nLafayette is 1-5 after the long half of its 2015 schedule; Harvard is 4-0, and Georgetown coach Rob Sgarlata has said he thinks the Crimson is the best team he has ever seen at the FCS level.\nCrimson coach Tim Murphy laughed when he was asked on a conference call if he agreed with that assessment, then said, \"No, I wouldn't, absolutely not. I think we played extremely well in that game [45-0 win over the Hoyas], had some good matchups and got on a roll. But quite honestly, we haven't played a great team this year. … we still have a lot to prove.\"\nTavani and Murphy both cited Harvard's eight senior starters on offense and nine senior starters on defense as a key to the team's success, which includes turning the ball over only once while turning nine takeaways into 51 points. Harvard has scored 179 points and allowed only 40 in wins over Rhode Island, Brown, Georgetown and Cornell. The four losing teams have a combined record of 4-14.\nMurphy is a former defensive line coach at Lafayette (1981) but hasn't been especially kind to the Leopards since taking over at Harvard in 1993. He has won 13 of 15 games against Lafayette, including the last four. The Leopards last won in 2009 at Harvard.\nHarvard quarterbacks haven't been sacked all year and Lafayette has only six sacks this season, none by the inside guys.\nDuncan Sparks, a junior defensive end, has two of the Lafayette sacks and said Tuesday that Harvard's experienced offensive line, including three seniors, is \"nothing really fancy; I don't think they have to get fancy. They're pretty strong offensively and they pretty much stick with the basics.\"\nThe Harvard defense, which has three senior linebackers, each of whom has started at least 30 games in his career, and four seniors in the secondary, will be taking on a Lafayette offensive line that will have two freshmen and a sophomore as well as senior Matt Anderson, who is making his first start. Until three weeks ago Anderson hadn't played on offense in high school or college.\nTanner Kern, who won't celebrate his 18th birthday until Oct. 24, is the Leopards' freshman starter at center, and he offered an example of how young he really is.\nA questioner mentioned that Kern was getting a baptism by fire coming out of Xavier High School in Middletown, Conn., and he said, \"It's definitely a baptism by fire; I didn't even know what that meant until [strength and conditioning] Coach [Brad] Potts told me in the locker room.\"\nAnderson, grandson of former Lafayette and Penn State assistant coach Dick Anderson, was a defensive player in high school and for the Leopards. He got his first playing time at left guard against Georgetown and graded out well enough to earn the start this week in the spot usually held by Connor Staudle, who is missing his fourth game with an injury.\nLafayette coaches continued to reshuffle the personnel deck this week. Wide receivers Darrell Crawford and freshman C.J. Amill have moved to cornerback, and Crawford, who started five games at corner last season, is expected to start in place of Matt Smalley, who reinjured a hamstring last week and was called \"very doubtful and most unlikely\" for this week.\nJunior wide receiver Tim Vangelas, who caught 30 passes last season but hadn't played this year until last week's game at Georgetown, is a welcome returnee. He caught three passes for 28 yards in limited action against the Hoyas.\n\"Personally, I'm just excited to have the opportunity to be out there again,\" Vangelas said. \"Really, we have nothing to lose.\nTavani, who had a mild heart attack during the offseason and had three stents put into his chest, was asked if he might take a \"preserve my stents\" approach to the Harvard game as opposed to the fiery motivational approach that has been his signature on College Hill.\n\"You'd have to talk with my football team,\" he said. \"I had a personal call from my cardiologist, Dr. [Joseph] Schiavone, last week, reminding me about my three long, connected stents and the danger of having too many explosions. [The players will] tell you I have my moments, but I also have learned to keep under control. It only took 62 years and a heart attack. These things aren't easy any level. … You gotta believe, knowing me, this is eatin' away at me. But, we will find a way.\"\nRetired sports columnist Paul Reinhard is a freelance writer.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T04:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T21:32:48.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
