Seattle QB Russell Wilson talked about what the team needs to do to cut down on sacks, and more, when he met the media Friday. \nThat avoiding sacks is about more than quarterback mobility is evident in a look at the NFL stats this week. \nHaving been sacked the most through three weeks is Kansas City’s Alex Smith with 13. Tied for second are Russell Wilson and Marcus Mariota with 12. \nAmong the players at the bottom of the list with just one is a player whose 40 times might equal the combined total of each of the three players listed above — Arizona’s Carson Palmer. \nWilson is on pace to be sacked 64 times, which not only would top his career-high (or should that be low?) of 44 in 2013, and would also threaten the all-time Seattle record of 67. That was set in the dreadful season of 1992 when Stan Gelbaugh was sacked sacked 34 times, Kelly Stouffer 26 and Dan McGwire seven as the Seattle offense scored just 140 points and was held to single digit scoring eight times.

They did a good job on us. But I think the couple times they’ve gotten me when I’m just getting away, it’s kind of like right at the line of scrimmage, so hopefully those will break open. I’ve had a few where they’ve broken open. But I think just continue to be strong up front, get the ball out on time on my part, and just continue to try to deliver. And this may sound crazy, but sometimes a sack’s not the end of the world. Sometimes just something’s not there, so you move on to the next down and continue to play football, and as much as I can throw the ball away. You know, that’s what I try to do, is salvage the play and move on to the next.” \nAlso surely contributing is that the Seahawks have passed at a higher percentage so far than in any of Wilson’s first three seasons — 101 throws to 86 runs through three games. Interestingly, offensive coordinator Darrell Bevell said on Thursday that the biggest area of improvement so far in Wilson’s game is his throwing from the pocket. \nWilson was asked about that today and said: “Well, I think just getting more and more comfortable as the years go on. You just continue to trust your reads, continue to trust your progression, and just hanging in there longer, and know that you’re going to have to take some hits every once in a while, but get the ball to the right guy at the right time. And that’s the goal, just giving the guy a chance to make a play, and so I think we’ve been doing a pretty good job of that so far. We just need to keep growing, and our focus is just continue to be great on third down. We have to find a way to really capitalize there in that situation there, just to stay on the field. In the second half of the last game, we did a phenomenal job of that. We were 50 percent in the second half, but the first half we weren’t. I think that allows us to stay on the field and give our playmakers a chance to make plays.” \nWilson also talked about what the offense needs to clean up to get to a level where it gets off to better starts and is more efficient on third down and in the red zone. \n“I think just ultimately just giving ourselves the best chance to have a successful play,” he said. “That’s from me making the right read, that’s from making sure we’re blocking the right guy at the right time, making sure we’re hitting the right hole in terms of running. It’s just the fundamentals of football, the basics. So that’s the exciting part, we’re able to do that every day in practice and just continue to transfer that over to the game. Definitely excited about obviously getting our first win last week, but it’s a new week, and we’ve got a very, very tough team coming in in the Detroit Lions. Playing here, it’s going to be a thrill to play, obviously on Monday Night Football. But the game’s still a hundred yards, and we just want to play at a high level.” Bob Condotta : 206-515-5699 or bcondotta@seattletimes.com ; on Twitter: @bobcondotta .
