Football games are the perfect example of how much we are a family. When we win at the end, we are all shoulder to shoulder and singing the alma mater together.” The Rich twins, 2015 Pine Bush graduates, have a connection to the football program. Penn State football coach James Franklin and some of his players were waiting to help freshmen move into their dooms on Aug. 22. “It was nice,” Wendy Rich said. “They wanted the transition for everyone to be comforting. It was unexpected. They did most of the carrying.” Leighann Rich was the salutatorian of her senior class. Wendy Rich was fourth in her class. The twins chose Penn State over Rutgers. “Rutgers was more of a city setting,” Leighann Rich said. “Here, you could walk everywhere on campus and downtown. Rutgers, (you) had to take the bus everywhere. It seemed safer here.“ n Members of the Army and Penn State glee clubs joined to sing “God Bless America” at halftime. n Senior tight end Kelvin White carried the American flag onto the field for Army. White is from Enola, Pa., about 90 miles from State College. n Senior defensive end Evan Finnane and senior tackle Ryan Alexander joined captains Matt Giachinta and Jeremy Timpf at midfield for the coin toss. n Penn State junior Albert Hall, a Warwick graduate, played on special teams. Hall, a walk-on, is a second-string guard for the Nittany Lions. “It’s an honor to be a part of this program,” Hall said last week. “I enjoy every moment of it. Growing up as a kid, you always watch Penn State football games on Saturdays. You always wish that you can play for them. To get that chance is pretty special.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T07:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T09:37:11.578+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
