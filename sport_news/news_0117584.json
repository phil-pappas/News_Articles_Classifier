The longtime Red Sox captain has been working as a special assistant in Boston's front office since his retirement before the 2012 season. The team did grant permission for Varitek to speak with Seattle. Varitek's name had been bandied about, mostly on talk radio, as a possibility for the Red Sox's job back in 2012, when the team hired current manager John Farrell. Varitek's reputation as one of the game's most intelligent players, combined with the success many catchers have had as big-league managers, fueled that speculation. The 43-year-old Varitek himself had not yet appeared eager to get back in the game on an everyday basis. As a special assistant, he can mostly arrange his own schedule, traveling to spring training and to minor-league affiliates throughout the year while also spending considerable time with his family. The Mariners are the team that drafted Varitek in 1994's first round out of Georgia Tech, eventually trading him alongside Derek Lowe to Boston in their disastrous deadline deal for Heathcliff Slocumb in 1997. Varitek played 15 seasons for the Red Sox, catching four no-hitters, making three All-Star teams and winning two World Series. Two of the other candidates CBS reported for the Seattle job have Red Sox ties in former third-base coach Tim Bogar and former Boston infielder Alex Cora.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T20:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T00:18:17.480+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
