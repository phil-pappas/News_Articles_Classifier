New data from the Northeast Fisheries Science Center says research boats fishing the broad swath of elevated sea floor off Massachusetts caught less of the fish per trip this past spring than all but one spring season dating back to 1968.\nScientists say overfishing and rising temperatures are threatening the species.\nThe Gulf of Maine cod fishery is also in dire shape, regulators say.\nThe status of the Georges Bank cod is the subject of a presentation to federal fishing managers Wednesday. The New England Fishery Management Council will consider the issue at its meeting in Plymouth, Massachusetts.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
