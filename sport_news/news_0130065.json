Belleville will play at Barringer on Thursday, Oct. 22, in a 4 p.m. start and on Oct. 26, the team is at Arts High of Newark, also at 4 p.m. There is also a second round ECT game scheduled at Verona. The match has to be played by this Saturday. As of press time, the date hadn't been confirmed. It should be an interesting match, as Verona is seeded eighth and Belleville, ninth, in the tournament. \nThe Bucs will find out soon where it will be for the upcoming NJSIAA Tournament. The cutoff for qualifying was Oct. 21 and the seedings will be announced on Oct. 28. The state tournament officially begins on Nov. 2. \nLast week, the Bucs defeated Golda Och, Columbia and Bloomfield Tech, all in straight sets, while losing a match with Bloomfield, also in straight sets. The win over Bloomfield Tech advanced Belleville in the ECT. \n\"I thought the week went well,\" said Spina. \"We finished 3-1, including a win in the counties and a hard-fought loss to Bloomfield. To our team's credit, they are getting better and better each day. We are starting to do things right, like covering our hitters and reading opposing attacks better, which serves to solidify our defense. We just need to continue attacking the ball and putting pressure on opposing teams, with tough serves and strong swings.\" \nSpina also noted that outside hitter Kiara Collazo should be back in the lineup soon, after getting hurt two weeks ago. \"That should give our offense a boost,\" said Spina of Collazo's possible return. \"In Kiara's absence, I feel that everyone else has been asked to step up their game and that should serve us well down the stretch.\" \nAndrea Nguyen had 15 assists, eight digs and four service points in the 25-17, 25-23 victory over a feisty Golda Och team. Jiselle Luna finished with 18 digs while Kristan Lombardi registered 15 digs and seven service points. Kara Sica had six service points and a pair of kills and digs. \nVersus Columbia, Belleville won, 25-18, 25-21, as Nguyen had 20 assists and nine service points, Gianna Benacquista recorded seven kills, three service points, two blocks and digs and Breana Nieves closed with 14 kills, three digs and three service points. The Bucs won that match, 25-18, 25-21. \nIn the 25-8, 25-15 victory over Bloomfield Tech, Benacquista had 12 service points, Nguyen recorded 19 assists, Sica had seven service points and four digs while Victoria Bruno registered five kills. \nNguyen also had a big game against Bloomfield, with 14 assists, four digs and four service points and Nieves finished with nine digs and six kills. \nEmail: Mike051893@aol.com  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T07:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T20:12:30.642+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
