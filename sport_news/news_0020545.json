Well on Friday, Durant gave us another potential clue to feast on like Beatles fans inspecting their Abbey Road vinyls with a magnifying glass to figure out whether or not Paul McCartney was really dead. \nThe 27-year-old MVP appeared on ESPN’s Fantasy Focus Football Podcast with Matthew Berry and Field Yates and expressed his desire to own the Washington Redskins after his playing days are over. \n“I love football, man, it’s a passion of mine,” said Durant per the Washington Post . “I would definitely love to own a team, you know hopefully one of these years, towards the end of my career. \n“My first priority would be the Washington Redskins, but even if it’s a small percentage, man, I just want to be involved, you know,” continued the six-time All-Star. “Growing up five minutes away from the stadium and always being a fan, I got a Redskin tattoo on my forearm, so I feel a part of the team so much.” \nSound the alarm! Well, maybe not quite. \nDurant, a Washington native, is set to hit unrestricted free agency in Summer 2016 and his hometown Wizards are widely accepted as the frontunner to land his talents should he depart from Oklahoma City. \nThe Slim Reaper already has the Wizards’ resident point guard superstar in hot pursuit . Now with this news, it seems like Washington is slowly gaining serious momentum in their quest to turn Durant into the NBA’s prodigal son. \nAnd if Durant goes home to play for Washington in 2016 AND ousts Dan Snyder as the Redskins’ owner once his playing career is over? They may just have to build a Durantula statue in between the Washington Monument and the Lincoln Memorial.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T10:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T13:00:57.842+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
