In particular, a hard freeze is defined by temperatures at 28 degrees or lower for 3 consecutive hours. \nWe may come close to some of those conditions. By Friday morning, 30 degree weather is likely through a big part of KELOLAND. Folks in the north will be coldest with 20s likely in Aberdeen. \nWe think Sioux Falls will have the coldest weather by Saturday morning. A drier environment will help the cooling process, and with clear skies and light winds in the forecast, odds are favorable that you'll need to cover a few plants you want to protect later in the week.
