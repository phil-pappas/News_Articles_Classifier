Not only did they have the opportunity to bask in the glory of their side's record 1,000th Bundesliga victory, but they were rewarded for following a brilliant team with a free beer amid the wild celebrations. \nThe 4-0 thrashing of Cologne simply paved the way for the glorious celebrations which followed, with the club's greatest heroes and memories recalled on social media, and current players afforded the luxury of rounding off the feat while also stretching their lead at the top of the table to a ridiculous 10 points. \nOh, and Arjen Robben marked his belated return from injury with a goal after a sublime backheel from Robert Lewandowski. Ah, it must be so enjoyable being a Bayern fan. \nChelsea are in total disarray \nOkay, so Chelsea's Premier League campaign really does seem to be beyond repair now. Mourinho's side slumped to yet another defeat at West Ham and the manner of it was incredibly alarming. \nQuite what Roman Abramovich will have made of seeing his club's name three places above the relegation zone after 11 games is anyone's guess, but the solution does not appear remotely simple. While Abramovich could sack Mourinho, the issues throughout the team are now so significant that simply changing the manager may not help much at all. \nThe only teams which lie below Chelsea now? Norwich, Bournemouth, Newcastle, Aston Villa and Sunderland. Unbelievably, Chelsea find themselves in the wrong mini-league and it's shocking to see. \nSherwood's reign will soon be over \nPerhaps the only man who will be feeling more disconsolate than Mourinho is Sherwood, who saw his side suffer yet another defeat... at the hands of Swansea City... at home. \nNot only did Sherwood see his side throw away a lead after the hour mark, but he also suffered the uncomfortable confirmation that he bought the wrong Ayew having spent a significant amount of money over the summer. He may have been declared a hero towards the end of last season, but now Sherwood appears a sorry, forlorn figure with his natural positivity and enthusiasm sadly seeping away. \nHe joked about turning his phone off so he can't get sacked after the match but at some point soon it seems the news will reach him regardless. \nReal Madrid don't really need David De Gea \nKeylor Navas had very big gloves to fill after taking over from the legendary Iker Casillas in the Real Madrid goal, but the 28-year-old is doing a fine job at the moment and Rafa Benitez must realise just how valuable his keeper is proving to be this season. \nNavas was again in sparkling form against Celta Vigo and made half a dozen superb stops to deny the hosts in the second half as Real Madrid closed out a valuable win. The goalkeeper has had everything to prove since the botched deal for De Gea over the summer and he's seized his opportunity with relish. \nThe question will now be whether Real Madrid can resist the temptation to go back in for De Gea or if they will be happy to keep putting their faith in Navas. \nAndy Carroll is back - with an improved recipe \nDimitri Payet continued his excellent start to life in the Premier League, cementing his tag as arguably the signing of the summer. But it was the scorer of the winning goal that should cheer West Ham fans after their best start to a season in 40 years. \nAfter the success of West Ham's new signings, many of whom look to play on the floor, it offers real encouragement to see the England forward prosper as the Plan B in Slaven Bilic's set-up. It was his first goal since January, and with Euro 2016 waiting in June this has the feel of a defining season for a striker who turns 27 in January and should be approaching his peak. \nThe future could be very bright indeed for Carroll without too much pressure playing under Bilic - if he can stay fit, of course. \nJamie Vardy clearly is the real deal \nYou know that Vardy chap? Yes, well, he's scored in seven consecutive games. Seven! The Leicester City forward is doing much, much more than simply poaching goals: he's proving a constant threat for Premier League defences, from out wide and down the middle. \nHe's the form striker in the England set-up right now so will surely get further opportunities to establish himself at international level under Roy Hodgson if he maintains his level in Claudio Ranieri's thriving side. \nThere is a lot more to Vardy's game than purely his electrifying pace, and opposing teams are now having to directly plan for negating Vardy's qualities in the final third of the field. Right now there seems to be nothing and no-one capable of stopping him. \n-", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T14:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T06:36:50.782+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
