North Carolina State and Wake Forest are determined to be in the conversation about the Atlantic Coast Conference’s Atlantic Division. For each team, that almost mandates a victory. “We’re excited to move forward and get last week out of our system,” said Wake Forest coach Dave Clawson, whose team dropped a 50-14 decision at North Carolina. N.C. State had the weekend off to stew about back-to-back defeats to begin conference play. “I’m very confident in how hard the guys have worked, how positive they’ve been, how excited they are about the challenge, the opportunity,” N.C. State coach Dave Doeren said. Wake Forest played in five consecutive games that could have gone either way in the fourth quarter before the misery in Chapel Hill. That creates a different type of mindset going through the week leading to the next game, Clawson said. “The players don’t feel good about how they played,” he said. “We’re capable of playing better than that.” Doeren said the Wolfpack’s two conference losses have resulted from a poor quarter in each game. “We need to get more consistent,” he said. “It really comes down to a four-quarter focus from our staff and players and the detail and accountability that comes with it.” For the Wolfpack, coming off a break in the schedule could be beneficial. “Being able to decompress a little bit and giving them some time to kind of catch up and get some rest,” Doeren said. “I think it’s real important. Whether you’re winning or losing, it’s a big deal.” N.C. State could benefit if offensive lineman Alex Barr is fully healthy after playing at less than 100 percent in the Virginia Tech game. Bryce Kennedy also could be back along the offensive front. Both teams have acknowledged the rivalry aspect of the meeting between in-state schools. For Wake Forest, there’s the matter of making some amends. “This was a non-competitive game a year ago,” Clawson said, referring to N.C. State’s 42-13 romp in Raleigh. N.C.
