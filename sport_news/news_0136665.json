(Rob Ostermaier/Daily Press) \nVIRGINIA TECH (3-3, 1-1 ACC) AT MIAMI (3-2, 0-1) \nWHEN: 3:30 p.m. TV : ESPNU. \nWHERE: Sun Life Stadium, Miami Gardens, Fla. \nTHE SKINNY: While this matchup has rivalry roots stretching back to the Big East days for both schools, there's a lot on the line Saturday in South Florida. Coming off its most impressive win of the season against N.C. State, Tech needs to continue building momentum. Miami is reeling after a 29-24 loss at No. 12 Florida State. The Tech-Miami loser faces an uphill climb to get back into the Coastal Division race, while the winner will remain a key player in it. Tech quarterback Michael Brewer (broken clavicle) could be medically cleared to play, but it remains to be seen if he'll play over Brenden Motley. Tech will try to get pressure on quarterback Brad Kaaya, but it'll be more difficult to get a push on the line of scrimmage if defensive tackle Corey Marshall (hamstring) can't play. Marshall's absence also could play a role in Tech's efforts to slow down Miami running back Joe Yearby (457 yards rushing, 6.3 yards per carry). Kaaya will look for wide receivers Rashawn Scott (29 catches, 415 yards and two touchdowns), Herb Waters (19 catches for 299 yards) and Stacy Coley against a young but effective Tech secondary (11th in the nation in passing defense, giving up 150.5 yards per game). \nPREDICTION: Miami 24-20. \nSYRACUSE (3-2, 1-0 ACC) AT VIRGINIA (1-4, 0-1) \nWHEN: 3:30 p.m. TV : CSN, Cox 11. \nWHERE: Scott Stadium, Charlottesville. \nThe 2015 Virginia football season in pictures. \nTHE SKINNY: U.Va.'s players insist they aren't in panic mode as they near the midpoint of the season still looking for their first win against a Football Bowl Subdivision program. U.Va. will look for its first such victory in a game that could be a shootout, especially if the Cavaliers have trouble putting the breaks on the Orange's triple-option look. Syracuse and U.Va. statistically have the worst defenses in the ACC, with the Orange giving up 393.6 yards per game (13th in ACC) and the Cavaliers surrendering 428.8 yards per game. Most of the damage against both defenses has come through the air. U.Va., which is 122nd in the nation out of 127 FBS programs in turnover margin (minus-1.6 per game), is still looking to collect its first interception of the season. U.Va. quarterback Matt Johns (60.4 completion percentage, 1,198 yards, nine touchdowns, seven interceptions) will have to operate behind an offensive line that will be without starting left tackle Mike Mooney (lower extremity injury), which means one fewer experienced player to protect against defensive end Ron Thompson. He leads the ACC with five sacks. Syracuse freshman quarterback Eric Dungey is the ACC's most efficient passer (42-of-70 for 660 yards, seven touchdowns and one interception). Led by linebacker Micah Kiser, who is atop the ACC with an average of 10 tackles per game), U.Va. will try to get to Dungey to discourage the option ground game. \nSee the 2015 Christopher Newport University football season in pictures. \nPREDICTION: U.Va. 34-31. \nNO. 19 NEW HAMPSHIRE (3-2, 1-1 CAA) AT NO. 24 WILLIAM AND MARY (3-2, 2-1) \nWHEN: Noon. TV/RADIO: CSN/92.3FM, 107.9FM. \nWHERE: Zable Stadium, Williamsburg. \nTHE SKINNY: The big news up north is the expected return of QB Sean Goldrich, who has been out since spraining his ankle in Week 2. Adam Riese (67 percent, 473 yards, 5 TDs) was effective in his absence, but Goldrich has big-game experience. RB Dalton Crossan is coming off a 140-yard, four-TD game in last week's win over Elon. He's also the Wildcats' top receiver with 19 catches for 115 yards. Defensively, UNH is giving up 22 ppg and 5.5 yards per snap. The Tribe bounced back from a loss to Delaware by waxing Villanova 38-16 last week on the road. RB Kendell Anderson has rushed for 446 yards and 5 TD in his last three games. RB Mikal Abdul-Saboor returned to the lineup last week after missing a game with a sprained ankle with 12 carries for 47 yards. W&M has a 14-4 series advantage and is 9-1 at home. \nPREDICTION: William and Mary 27-17. \nCHRISTOPHER NEWPORT (1-4, 1-3 New Jersey Athletic Conference) AT MONTCLAIR STATE (2-3, 2-3) \nWHEN: 1 p.m. RADIO: 99.1 FM. \nWHERE: Sprague Field, Montclair, N.J. \nTHE SKINNY: Yet another tough opponent for the Captains, who have lost four in a row for the first time in the program's 15-year history. After an 0-3 start, the Red Hawks have won two straight by a combined score of 109-7. QB Ryan Davies (59 percent, 1,075 yards, 8 TDs) is a major threat, and his favorite target it 6-foot-3 Aaron Williams (29 catches, 396 yards, 2 TDs). The Red Hawks average 135.6 rushing yards per game. CNU hopes to jump-start its offense by improving its production in the red zone (38 percent TDs) and on third down (32 percent). The Captains have failed to score in the third quarter this season, which has allowed close games to get away from them. The passing game is hitting on 54 percent of its throws, with twice as many picks (six) as touchdowns (three). This will be the first meeting between these schools. \nPREDICTION: Montclair State 27-13. \nHAMPTON (3-3, 2-2 MEAC) AT MORGAN STATE (3-2, 3-0) \nWHEN: 1 p.m. RADIO: 88.1FM. \nWHERE: Hughes Stadium, Baltimore. \nTHE SKINNY: Morgan State was one of five co-champions in the MEAC last season and is one of two 3-0 teams in the conference standings this year. Morgan has a tough running game led by QB Moses Skillon (59 ypg, 6 ypc) and RBs Orland Johnson (57 ypg, 4 TDs) and Lamont Brown (46 ypg, 5 ypc). After being held to 199 yards in its first two games, the Bears have rushed for 690 in their last three. Defensively, Morgan is giving up 30 ppg but only 7.3 ppg in its three MEAC games. The Pirates continue hurting themselves with penalties and turnovers, but RB Chris Dukes has rushed for 170 yards on 21 carries in his last two games. QB David Watford leads the conference in passing yards (1,479) and TDs (14) but also interceptions (10). The Pirates' defense has gotten better week to week and held Delaware State to a touchdown last week. \nPREDICTION: Morgan State 23-14. \nCHARLOTTE (2-3, 0-2 C-USA) AT OLD DOMINION (2-3, 0-1) \nWHEN: 3:30 p.m. TV/RADIO: WTVZ, 94.1FM. \nWHERE: Ballard Stadium, Norfolk. \nTHE SKINNY: The scoring averages of these teams are virtually identical. ODU is putting up 16.6 ppg while giving up 31.6; Charlotte is scoring 16.2 while allowing 31.4. The 49ers are in their transition year to FBS, right where ODU was a year ago. RB Kalif Phillips is averaging nearly 100 rushing yards a game and had a season-high 159 against Florida Atlantic. A number that jumps off the Charlotte stats page, in a bad way, is turnover margin. The 49ers have 21 giveaways to 12 takeaways, a minus-9 margin after four games. After its third consecutive loss, ODU got a well-timed bye week, in which it had two scrimmages to focus on the passing game. While RB Ray Lawry (127 ypg, 7 TDs) is Conference USA's top rusher, QB Shuler Bentley is completing only 50 percent of his throws for an average of 138 ypg. The defense is playing better than its numbers (394 ypg) would suggest. \nPREDICTION: Old Dominion 23-17. \nAPPRENTICE (0-5) AT ALFRED STATE (0-5) \nWHEN: Noon. \nWHERE: Pioneer Stadium, Alfred, N.Y. \nTHE SKINNY: Alfred State is coming off a bye week following a 59-7 loss at Brockport State. The Pioneers, led by QB Ben Wilkerson (46-of-80, 551 yards, 4 TDs) are allowing 48 points per game and scoring just 9.8. The Builders are scoring 10.2 and yielding 36.8. Dustin Hiner has emerged as a threat, with 503 rushing yards and two touchdowns. The teams split two games last season. \nPREDICTION: Apprentice 28-27.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T03:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T04:16:16.912+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
