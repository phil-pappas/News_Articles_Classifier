Formula One’s ruling body the FIA today revealed unexpected findings from an investigation into Carlos Sainz’s high-speed crash at the Russian Grand Prix. \nIt was believed that the Spaniard’s Toro Rosso car had 'submarined' below the special French-made energy-absorbing TecPro barriers on impact, but this was shown to be wrong. \nInstead, as slow-frame analysis of the accident demonstrated, the barriers did their job and the low nose of the car went directly into the barriers and not beneath them. \nThe barriers then went through a 'bounce-back' motion after hitting the steel Armco barriers behind them. \nSainz crashed during final free practice for the race, but escaped unhurt and was passed fit to take part in the event today. \nThe FIA Safety Director Laurent Mekies told reporters that the impact with the barriers was at 153 kph. The investigation showed that the car slowed from 153 kph to zero in four metres. \n\"It was quite an extreme stop,\" said Mekies. \"And it is quite an outstanding performance that both the car and barriers allowed the driver to walk away from the crash. \n\"From the video analysis, you see the barrier rising when it is rebounding from the Armco (barrier), which is a very important thing for us to improve because it gave quite a few concerns for the rescue team. \n\"But it was quite a different situation compared to a car ‘submarining’ beneath the barrier. \n\"It is obviously quite a different conclusion compared to what was initially felt, giving us quite a challenge to resolve how to avoid that rebounding phase, but it is also giving us confidence in the barrier and car performance in the crash.\" \nThe chairman of the Grand Prix Drivers Association (GPDA), Alex Wurz, praised the work done in improving the safety barriers and the results achieved by the TecPro barriers. \nHe said: \"The bottom line is that it’s really impressive and is thanks to all the intense work that has been done. We are not stopping – F1 is always striving for safer solutions. \n\"The issue that came up about him being under the barrier, this is something that will definitely be dealt with, and we were reassured of this and the drivers understand everything. \n\"All the protocol, the crisis and risk-management, was done in a very satisfying way.\" – AFP, October 25, 2015. \nShare with others", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T13:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T14:00:07.773+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
