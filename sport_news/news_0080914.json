True freshman Kerryon Johnson has taken each snap in the formation and scored his first career touchdown on a 6-yard rush Thursday. \nWhen asked if he's planning to expand the playbook to allow Johnson to attempt a pass, Auburn head coach Gus Malzahn did not rule out the possibility. \n\"He could,\" Malzahn said during this press conference Tuesday. \"I wouldn't tell you, but he definitely could.\" \nRELATED: Malzahn sizes up Arkansas \nAuburn has put Johnson's versatility to the test, giving him reps at running back and receiver as well as in the return game. He finished with nine carries for 36 yards with four kick returns for 111 yards against Kentucky, all season highs. \nSo how does the youngster feel about his ability to put the ball in the air? \n\"I'm confident in everything,\" Johnson said. \"Everything I get the possibility to do, I'm confident. If we do it, then you know Coach Malzahn's going to be confident in it too.\" \n\"There's a possibility for a lot of things. I'm not going to say it's not an element, but I'm not going to say we practice on it 25 minutes a week. We have options out of that thing just like anything else.\" \nJohnson has 25 carries for 107 yards, eight catches for 70 yards and seven kick returns for 209 yards this season.
