But it wasn’t enough to get past the host Alaska Aces in their ECHL season opener late Friday night in Anchorage, Alaska. Trailing 2-0, Jesse Root scored on assists from new captain Trevor Ludwig and Tyler Barnes at the 13:14 mark of the third period to cut the deficit in half. The Mavericks (0-1-0-0), though, couldn’t come up with the equalizer and Justin Breton scored his second goal with 7 seconds left. Breton gave the Aces a 1-0 lead just 24 seconds into the game when he scored on assists from David Eddy and Ben Lake. Gleason Fournier scored a power-play goal at the 7:46 mark of the second period to give Alaska (1-0-0-0) a 2-0 advantage. The Mavericks fell despite outshooting the Aces 40-29 on goal. Alaska goalkeeper Trot Redmann made 39 saves, while the Mavericks’ Parker Milner had 26 stops. The Mavericks meet the aces again at 10:15 p.m. CDT Saturday and at 6:05 p.m. CDT Sunday to complete the trip.
