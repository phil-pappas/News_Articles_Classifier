Frese was second in last weekend’s regional. Her only loss was 2-6, 0-6 to Kansas City Christian’s Anna Vialle. Frese is 14-10 going to state.Nieberding and freshman partner Shelby Downard were the doubles champions and take a 16-5 record into state. Sophomore teammates Holly Holthaus and Avery Williams, 15-7, qualified with a fourth-place finish at regional.Both Frese and Nieberding are two-time state qualifiers. Frese was 12th last year. Nieberding has not medaled, but her goal is a top five finish Saturday at the Harmon Park Tennis Complex in Prairie Village, Kan. They’re familiar with the courts since regional was there. MHS finished with 17 points, two behind KCC. “At the state tournament everyone is good,” said MHS coach Mary Kessinger-Wassom. “We’ve got to keep getting better this week. We can’t level off. We’ve got to be at our strongest when we play this week. It will be a tough tournament. We have to be ready to play, ready to improve from last week.”Frese has seen her improvement this year in terms of stamina, focus and mindset. She attacked at regional from the outset, which earned her a 6-0 wins against Alayna Nine, Immaculata, in the first round, and a pair of 6-2 wins against Ryan Jantsch, KCC, to make the semifinal round.Frese avenged an earlier loss against No. 2 seed Lexi Wenger, Sabetha, at 6-2, 6-1 to face Vialle in the final. Vialle won 6-2, 6-0.“I was pretty nervous because I didn’t have my coach there,” Frese said. Kessinger-Wassom was inducted into Bethel College’s Hall of Fame Friday in North Newton. “She knew I could handle it on my own. She knew I had it in me to beat her. I was more composed. In my mind I didn’t think about any of my losses. I kept envisioning myself as being victorious.”Tennis is as much mental as it is physical and Frese said she must stay focused.There were plenty of dogfights in doubles, though scores for Nieberding and Downard are not an indication. The No. 2-seeded Bulldogs won their first rounds 6-1, 6-0 and 6-2, 6-3. Nieberding and Downard won 6-4, 6-2 against Nicole Brey and Jenna Winkler, Sabetha, to face top-seeded Callie Eldred and Alexis Termini, KCC, in the final. MHS won 6-4, 6-2.“To win as a doubles team was very satisfying,” Nieberding said. “We were able to split KCC’s players and finish strong at the net.”Holthaus and Williams were on the other side of the bracket. They won 6-2, 6-0 against an Immaculata team in the first round and 6-0, 4-6, 11-9 against KCC’s No. 2 doubles team. That put Holthaus and Williams in a semifinal against Eldred and Termini. MHS lost 3-6, 2-6. In the third-place match, MHS lost to Winker and Brey, 1-6, 4-6.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T01:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T22:03:32.788+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
