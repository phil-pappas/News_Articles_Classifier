(AP Photo/Tony Ding) \nWith Michigan having pitched three straight shutouts, Michigan State knew that points would be hard to come by in their showdown Saturday. Sure enough, the Spartans managed just seven points in the first half, and even those came after what many felt was an unfair call on the Wolverines. \nMichigan linebacker Joe Bolden was called for targeting on a hit of MSU quarterback, Connor Cook, who had slid to the ground after picking up six yards on a second-and-9 play in the second quarter. The penalty moved the Spartans 15 yards further downfield and, more significantly, mandated the ejection of Bolden. Here is the play: Questionable targeting call helps Michigan State end Michigan’s long shutout streak.

Others argued that the contact wasn’t the linebacker’s fault at all, because he had been blocked into Cook’s path. No way that was targeting, can't toss a kid for that \n— Mike Golic (@espngolic) October 17, 2015 \nNo way Bolden should be penalized there. He was being pushed over by his blocker and just happened to land on Connor Cook. \n— Kevin McGuire (@KevinOnCFB) October 17, 2015 Welp. I'll just say I'm glad we don't have targeting in the NFL cause it sure as hell doesn't make a ton of sense sometimes in college.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T01:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T01:57:12.648+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
