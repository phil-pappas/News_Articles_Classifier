When wide receiver Ryan Grant slipped on a pass route, Alford caught Cousins' pass and was left with open field down the Falcons' sideline for the touchdown. \nDevonta Freeman's apparent 13-yard TD catch in the final minute of regulation was ruled incomplete on a review. Freeman scored on 6-yard run two plays later to give Atlanta a 19-16 lead. Dustin Hopkins' 52-yard field goal on the final play of regulation forced overtime. \nThe Falcons (5-0) overcame two interceptions and a lost fumble by Matt Ryan. Freeman had 27 carries for 153 yards and the touchdown. \nThe Redskins (2-3) were denied their attempt for their first back-to-back wins in almost a year - since Weeks 7 and 8 in 2014.
