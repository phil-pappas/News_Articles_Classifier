This project will continue into 2016 with its design phase and is to be fully completed in 2017.\n•$200,000 — in support for Evanston Fire Department paramedics. The allocation represents the cost of one full-time ambulance company serving the community 24/7 for a period of one year, officials said. Evanston provides fire and ambulance services to the private university, which doesn't have its own fire department.\n•$100,000 — in support for the city's Youth and Young Adult Division. This allocation will cover the salary of one of the four existing full-time outreach workers and allow the City to add an additional full-time outreach worker.\n•$150,000 — in support for at-risk youth job training programs, with $50,000 going to support programs covered by existing funding and $100,000 devoted to new job training programs.\n•$50,000 — to go toward support for the mayor's fund to assist families impacted by violent crime.\nbseidenberg@pioneerlocal.com\nTwitter: @evanstonscribe\nCopyright © 2015, Chicago Tribune Colleges and Universities Education Evanston Elizabeth Tisdahl", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-561a6c06/turbine/ct-evr-bike-pilot-tl-1015-20151009", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-544efb12/turbine/ct-northwestern-visitor-center-kamin-met-1026-20141028", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-561d52fb/turbine/ct-evr-nu-city-fund-tl-1015-20151013"], "published": "2015-10-13T21:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T23:13:27.316+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
