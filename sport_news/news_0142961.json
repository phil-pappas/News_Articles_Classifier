(WUSA9) -- The Maryland Terrapins have a huge problem heading into Saturday’s game with the Ohio State Buckeyes. The team’s most important position, quarterback, is in complete disarray. \nSaturday against Michigan, Caleb Rowe was benched for the second consecutive week after going 8 for 27 for 47 yards and three interceptions. Randy Edsall has bounced back and forth between three quarterbacks this season, none have been successful. \nWednesday, Dave Owens caught up with Maryland play-by-play voice Johnny Holliday who has seen 36 years worth of Terps football. \n“It’s a huge challenge but it’s also a chance for these kids to make a major statement,” said Holliday speaking about the upcoming Ohio State game. \nHolliday who has never shied away from his Maryland allegiance readily admits a trip to Columbus, Ohio is an enormous challenge but also says, “every team can get knocked off.” \n“For every kid on this football team, certainly they’re disappointed to have lost two games in a row the way they’ve lost those two games and they’ve got a lot to make up for.” \nAs for the three quarterbacks who have all struggled this season, Owens asked Holliday if he believes there’s one who has the best mental \nmakeup to go Ohio State and engineer an upset. \n“I hate to sound cliché but all three do, Caleb has shown he can move the team but he’s also shown he can throw interceptions which he has to cut down on,” said Holliday. \n“Perry Hills has all the intangibles to do it, and Daxx Garman when you look back on what he did last year at Oklahoma State he started eight games.” \nLike this story?
