That is why we had conducted the 10-day long preparatory camp for the entire squad before the tournament. However, SAI was of the opinion that there should be bone test before they officially give clearance for the squad. They conducted the bone test for the U-17 players but refused to do so for the U-15 players,\" Dasgupta told TOI on Thursday. \n\nWhen pointed out that there were bone tests conducted earlier also on the U-15 players, Dasgupta said they had to follow the guidelines of SAI because they only bear the cost of team. \n\n\"SAI said they cannot take the bone test of U-15 team and that is why they cannot be cleared for the participation. They believed that the radiation during the bone test might hamper the health of the players below 15 years of age. It was SAI's decision not to send U-15 team and not ours. You can found out more from SAI officials why they thought it was not right to conduct the bone test for the U-15 players,\" said Dasgupta. \n\nAbout Bhavya Rishi, who was found overage along with three other players but still went to Indonesia and represented India, Dasgupta said she went on her own as she and her parents produced the documents which proved that she was playing in the right age group. \n\n\"The benefit of doubt should always go to the players. I feel sorry for the U-15 players, who could not participate. In future we have to ensure that all these tests and formalities must be completed in advance and not at the last moment,\" said Dasgupta.
