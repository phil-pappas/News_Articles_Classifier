(AP) - Republican John Kennedy re-elected to fifth term as Louisiana's state treasurer.\nKennedy, a Republican from Madisonville, overwhelmingly defeated his lone opponent, Republican lawyer Jennifer Treadway, who raised and spent little money while Kennedy poured $1 million into TV advertising.\nSaturday's win will send Kennedy to his fifth term in office. It was the first time he faced a challenger since initially running for the job 16 years ago. Kennedy is currently Louisiana's longest-serving statewide elected official.\nIn recent years, he's been an outspoken critic of Republican Gov. Bobby Jindal's financial policies. But Treadway criticized Kennedy as doing too little to create roadblocks for Jindal's budgeting maneuvers.\nBefore being elected treasurer, Kennedy was a state revenue secretary and special counsel to former Gov. Buddy Roemer.\nTreasurer Louisiana\n1% OF PRECINCTS REPORTING\nJohn Kennedy R / Inc.123,980 83%\nJennifer Treadway R 25,00017%\n(Copyright 2015 The Associated Press.
