The conversation is being published in two parts in The New York Review of Books. The first part is online; an audio version is on iTunes.\nObama said he read Robinson's novel \"Gilead\" while campaigning in Iowa in 2004 and felt a connection to the main character, Rev. John Ames, described by the president as \"gracious and courtly and a little bit confused about how to reconcile his faith with all the various travails that his family goes through.\" Obama and Robinson moved into a lengthy discussion on faith, optimism and the future of democracy, with Robinson worrying about conspiracy theories and Obama saying he pushes for \"a little more optimism.\"\n\"Christianity is profoundly counterintuitive,\" Robinson said. \"'Love thy neighbor as thyself' â€” which I think properly understood means your neighbor is as worthy of love as you are, not that you're actually going to be capable of this sort of superhuman feat. But you're supposed to run against the grain. It's supposed to be difficult. It's supposed to be a challenge.\"\nObama asked Robinson a series of questions about her background in Idaho and how her upbringing shaped her as a writer before coming back to more talk about democracy and the common good. It's an interesting discussion, worth reading by anyone interested in literature and politics.\n-- Jeff Baker\njbaker@oregonian.com\n503-221-8165\n@oregonianbooks", "external_links": ["http://www2.nybooks.com/articles/s3/2015/nov/05/president-obama-marilynne-robinson-conversation.html", "https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/soundings-from-new-york-review/id284527588?mt=2"], "published": "2015-10-14T17:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T20:07:18.046+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
