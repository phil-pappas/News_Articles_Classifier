It was clear Jeev was trying to be aggressive to get into a good position at tied 12th early. \n\nThe other Indian, Shiv Kapur, also starting on 10th had just two birdies, one on 12th and another on closing ninth and one bogey on 14th. Kapur was tied 42nd. \n\nYoung Englishman Matthew Fitzpatrick birdied the last two holes for a brilliant seven-under 64. With six birdies alongside an eagle on the seventh hole, against a solitary bogey on the second, the 21-year-old eased into the first round lead at Woburn Golf Club, one stroke clear of Dane Soren Kjeldsen, Swede Robert Karlsson, Englishman Lee Slattery and Marc Warren of Scotland.
