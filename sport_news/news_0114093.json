It is a contribution made by each player, per season, per sports team and went into a Special Projects Fund for the improvement and maintenance of fields. According to Recreation Director Stephen Benko, sports teams traditionally included the $20 in their registration fees, along with other fees for uniforms, coaches, and referees. Then the teams would write a check in the amount of the number of players multiplied by 20. These checks would be deposited in a Special Projects Fund, and Superintendent of Parks John Howe would use the funds to work on general field maintenance. \nBenko said that by formalizing the donation project, there will be more transparency as it becomes clear during budget talks exactly how much money is in the General Fund for field maintenance. He also said that since the fee amount is not changing and was already incorporated into sports teams’ registration fees, nothing will change on the player and parent side of things. This is not a new fee, just a different process, according to Benko. \nThe change in the sports fee structure makes the ‘voluntary’ fees ‘mandatory,’ and instead of being placed into a Special Projects Fund, they will be directed to the General Fund. In the General Fund, there will be a line item for approximately $74,000 per year in the Parks budget for general field maintenance that Howe will be able to draw from for field repairs. \nThe Special Projects Fund will still exist but now be used solely for special projects and not for general maintenance. However, since the fall sports have already sent in their checks before the vote was cast, this season’s maintenance funding is in the Special Project Fund. \nExamples of specific projects would be a new canopy on the field at Saxe or the soccer team in need of new sod around the goal mouths. The line item in the General Fund for general maintenance would be for non specific team needs such as weeding, planting grass, and replacing dilapidated goal posts. \nThe new mandatory fee structure will be voted on by the Board of Selectmen.
