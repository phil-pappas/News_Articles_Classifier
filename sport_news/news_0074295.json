Add garlic, bell peppers and onion. Cook down while seasoning heavily with salt, paprika, cayenne and oregano until your desired taste is achieved. A little lemon juice or sherry vinegar will add a nice high-note flavor. This step is crucial because the breading will soak up a bunch of that flavor so make sure it has a bold taste.\nOnce the mixture has started to get some color, add the tomato paste, and incorporate. This will bring everything together. Add the crab; mix gently as to not totally shred the crab. Set aside to cool. After the mixture has cooled, add two eggs and two cups panko to help bind it. Form the mixture into croquettes, each about the size of a large hush puppy.\nFor breading: Set up three breading stations. In one bowl, season the four cups of flour with two tablespoons each of sugar, paprika, cayenne, oregano and garlic powder, and one tablespoon of salt. In a second bowl, make an egg wash by mixing together 3 eggs and 1 quart of heavy cream. (A little Tabasco never hurts!) In a third bowl, mix together 2 cups panko and the ground Cuban bread.\nLightly toss each croquette first in the seasoned flour, then in the egg wash, then in the bread mixture.\nFry the croquettes in oil at 350 degrees for about three minutes, until golden brown.\nTo serve: Dip the croquettes in the sea urchin hollandaise.\nSea urchin hollandaise\nChef’s note: You may use a stand mixer or a hand whisk to make the sauce.\n½ pound butter (clarified) (Be careful the butter isn’t too hot. Otherwise it will scramble the egg yolk.)\n3 egg yolks\n1 sea urchin, small diced\n1 tablespoon lemon juice\n1 pinch salt\nTo clarify the butter, melt the butter on low heat. Remove from heat; let sit five minutes. Skim the solids from the top. Slowly mix the clarified butter into the egg yolks, sea urchin, lemon juice and salt, stirring or mixing on high until it becomes nice and fluffy and delicious.", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/b3158b2db0429b9819be7742ff53220bb803a628/c=0-56-1997-1184&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/2015/10/20/Louisville/Louisville/635809345362598504-tenTables-04.JPG"], "published": "2015-10-20T20:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T21:08:36.925+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
