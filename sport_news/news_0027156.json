Most Popular By Dylan Montz, correspondent October 5, 2015 | 4:57 pm \nIowa State holder Austin Fischer made national news Saturday for his celebrations after made field goals and extra points. But Coach Paul Rhoads wants to see less of one of Fischer's moves. \n“He won't be shooting any bows and arrows, I can assure you of that,” Rhoads said. \nThe Washington Post, ESPN and Yahoo Sports all picked up video of Fischer's enthusiasm, which ranged from demonstrative fist pumps to shooting a pretend bow and arrow at the airborne ball. \nRhoads said Fischer's “quiver will stay at home” so the Cyclones don't draw an excessive celebration penalty, but that he loves the enthusiasm Fischer brings to the position. Yes! The most amped holder in the country just brought out a new celebration. Best one yet. #CampusRush pic.twitter.com/QFtjUVMyJQ — Chris Wolff (@HashtagChrisss) October 3, 2015 \n“As big a charge as anything on Saturday was for the kids to go out there and have fun, to enjoy going out and playing the game of football and Austin does that,” Rhoads said. “His role is not insignificant. He's doing a great job at it and has done a great job at it in the past. To be able to stand up and enjoy that moment is fantastic.” \nl Comments: montzdylan@gmail.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T23:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T19:07:36.048+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
