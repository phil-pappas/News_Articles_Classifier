Johnson scored three touchdowns as Hendrickson (6-1, 4-0) edged Pflugerville (1-6, 1-3) 22-6 to capture the crosstown District 13-6A contest for the fourth straight season Oct. 16 at Hawk Stadium.\nJohnson capped a three-play drive with a 30-yard scoring run on the first Hendrickson possession, then the two teams settled into a fierce defensive contest that the Hawks led 7-0 after a quarter.\nPflugerville closed the margin in the start of the second quarter when Alex Shillow fielded a Hendrickson punt at the Panther 35-yard line, cut right, ducked inside the coverage then raced 65 yards for the touchdown. The extra point attempt failed, leaving the Panthers down 7-6.\nHendrickson running back D.J. Jackson scored three times to lift the Hawks to a 22-6 win over rival Pflugerville.

However, the Hawks held Pflugerville to 150 yards of total offense.\nThe victory was a Hawk tuneup for next Friday’s showdown against Round Rock, who improved to 6-1 overall and 5-0 in district after beating Cedar Ridge (6-1, 3-1). The Hawks host Cedar Ridge the following week as the titans of District 13-6A face off for playoff positioning.\nDespite the loss, Pflugerville remains alive in pursuit of the fourth and final playoff spot and hosts Westwood next Friday", "external_links": ["http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/lt/lt_cache/thumbnail/600/img/photos/2015/10/17/0f/d6/IMG_5484.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-17T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T00:30:37.541+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
