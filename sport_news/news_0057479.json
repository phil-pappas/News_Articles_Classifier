Instead, they want to surprise them with a sign.\nThe front of the sign reads, \"Our family doesn't know but ...\"\nThen the back side says, \"October 23rd (Today) I said yes!!! Yes! Yes!\"\nNic Defreece surprised his girlfriend Jennifer Stapleton who works at the Kauffman Center for the Performing Arts. Her favorite spot is the Helzberg Hall.\nWith some help from her coworkers, he got her inside the hall and started playing their song.\nThat's when he popped the question.\n“I got down and I just said, ‘Can I spend the rest of my life with you?’ And then bam (brings out ring),” Defreece said. \nShe said yes!\n“I'm really happy because I love this man so much! I love his family and I love his daughter,” said Stapleton.\nKCTV5 wants to thank the couple for letting us share their big announcement.\nCopyright 2015 KCTV (Meredith Corp.)
