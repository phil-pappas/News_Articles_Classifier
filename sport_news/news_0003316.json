Two other defendants, Rodney Hesson, 46, and Gertrude Parker, 62, both of Slidell, were charged in the initial indictment returned in June 2015 in connection with a large-scale Medicare Fraud takedown, and were also charged in Thursday’s superseding indictment.\nAccording to the indictment, Hesson and Parker owned Nursing Home Psychological Service (NHPS) and Psychological Care Services (PCS), each of which operated in Louisiana, Mississippi, Florida and Alabama. The superseding indictment alleges that NHPS and PCS contracted with nursing homes in these states to allow NHPS and PCS clinical psychologists, including Stubblefield, Teal and Hesson, to test nursing home residents and provide related services that were not necessary and, in some instances, never provided.\nBetween 2009 and 2015, NHPS and PCS submitted more than $25.2 million in claims to Medicare, according to the indictment. Medicare paid approximately $17 million on those claims.\nThe case is being prosecuted by trial attorneys William Kanellis and Antonio Pozos of the Criminal Division’s Fraud Section and Assistant U.S. Attorney Patrice Harris Sullivan of the Eastern District of Louisiana.\nCopyright 2015 WVUE.
