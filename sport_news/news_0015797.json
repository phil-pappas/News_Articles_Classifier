Here are some of the highlights:\nQuestion: How do you see Texas Tech finishing up the second half of the season?\nCarlton: I said before the season began during a Fox Sports Southwest appearance that I could see Tech going from 4-8 to 8-4 this season. I still think that's a possibility. Patrick Mahomes seems to give Tech a chance in almost every game. I'm very interested in how Tech does at Oklahoma in two weeks. Obviously, injuries could change everything but you easily make a case than Tech is certainly in the top half of the Big 12. Two other key games to circle for Tech: Oklahoma State visits Lubbock on Halloween and the Thanksgiving trip to Austin.\nQuestion: Did David Beatty really mention Patrick Mahomes in the same sentence as Johnny Manziel? What am I missing?\nCarlton: Lots of coaches turn into Lou Holtz clones the week before games. That said, Mahomes is probably underrated as a play-making quarter. He's just not Manziel yet.\nClick here to read the full chat transcript.\nFull coverage: Predictions, analysis and more\nCLICK HERE TO VISIT THE TEXAS TECH RED RAIDERS PAGE\nTexas Tech prediction: Red Raiders show 'killer instinct' in road game against Kansas\nKingsbury: Texas Tech OL Justin Murphy needs surgery, is out for season\nBig 12 power rankings (10/14): Texas, Texas Tech move up\nFive things Texas Tech fans need to know about Kansas, including its historically bad season\nTexas Tech commit arrested on organized crime, vehicle burglary charges\nTexas Tech coach Kliff Kingsbury on unforgiving schedule, approach to Kansas\nBest in Texas (10/12): Move over, TCU -- there's a new No. 1 in the state\nOn Twitter:\n @ChuckCarltonDMN", "external_links": ["http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/10/14/kingsbury-texas-tech-ol-justin-murphy-needs-surgery-season", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/10/13/report-texas-tech-commit-arrested-organized-crime-vehicle-burglary-charges", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/10/12/texas-tech-coach-kliff-kingsbury-unforgiving-schedule-approach-kansas", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/texas-tech-red-raiders", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/10/12/best-texas-1012-move-tcu-new-1-state", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/10/13/big-12-power-rankings-1014-baylor-takes-top-spot-middle-conference-remains-unpredictable", "http://embed.scribblelive.com/Embed/v7.aspx?Id=1553545&ThemeId=", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/10/15/texas-tech-prediction-red-raiders-show-killer-instinct-road-game-kansas", "https://twitter.com/ChuckCarltonDMN", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/10/13/five-things-texas-tech-fans-need-know-kansas-including-historically-bad-season"], "published": "2015-10-16T04:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T07:32:30.774+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
