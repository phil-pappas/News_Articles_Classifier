(RYAN ABELLA/Miner) Hubble Ray Smith Miner Staff Reporter KINGMAN - On paper, it appears that Lee Williams High School has a decent chance of winning its third straight football game when the Volunteers host the Mohave High Thunderbirds at 7 p.m. today in their Homecoming game.Lee Williams is coming off back-to-back victories over cross-town rivals Kingman High and Kingman Academy, and brings an identical record as Mohave (2-5 overall, 2-2 section) into tonight's game.The Volunteers have outscored the Thunderbirds, 113-90, and their defense has allowed 242 points, compared to 253 for the Thunderbirds. Last week, Mohave lost to River Valley, 43-7, a slightly better showing than Lee Williams, which was blanked by River Valley, 51-0, on Sept. 18.Lee Williams assistant coach Ray Smith said online reports about Mohave's low offensive production are inaccurate. One source shows Mohave averaging fewer than 50 rushing yards a game.\"That ain't what we've seen on film,\" Smith said. \"We've seen two good backs. What I've seen is they're a team a little bit under River Valley and Havasu. They're better than Bourgade (Catholic).\"Smith is focused on senior running back Jason Urquiza, who led the Thunderbirds last year with more than 600 yards rushing and gained at least 250 yards against Parker, including a couple of 70-yard runs. Takory Brown is another senior running back who carries the load for Mohave.\"The thing that scares me is finding a way to stop those two backs. The two backs at the (Kingman) Academy are good, but these guys are more power backs than speed dudes,\" Smith said.Mohave defeated Parker, 27-8, and Parker beat Kingman Academy, 34-6. Lee Williams had a tough time last week with Kingman Academy, pulling away in the second half for a 38-21 victory.Volunteers sophomore running back Paul Giglio had his best game of the season, running 27 times for 167 yards and a touchdown against Academy. He was a \"different back\" last week who's starting to \"figure it out,\" Smith said.\"Our kids have turned it up,\" the coach said. \"They're practicing harder and playing harder.\"Senior Nate Cottrell has improved every week since moving from wide receiver to running back, where he's averaging about 80 yards a game rushing.\"I know when he's got the ball in his hands, I feel pretty good,\" Smith said. \"He's definitely in the top 10 running backs I've ever had.\"Cottrell came out of last week's game with back spasms, but hopefully he'll be okay to play this week, Smith said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T16:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T05:01:06.866+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
