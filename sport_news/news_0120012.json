That may be in part why Rose refused to rule out playing in the Oct. 27 regular-season opener despite not yet getting cleared for contact.\n\"Every day, it's improving. It could be quick. Who knows? It's no timetable. It's whenever I can go play,\" Rose said after his first workout with his new mask. \"I want to play. I'm anxious to play. I'm getting jittery just watching the freedom we have playing. ... If I'm willing to go and I know there's nothing in my way, I'll play (the opener.)\"\nEither way, the setback is a minor one after what Rose has endured with three knee surgeries. Rose said he hasn't experienced pain since the first two days following the Sept. 30 surgery, though his eye is still swollen and he occasionally experiences double vision.\nRose participated fully in the Bulls' non-contact practice Thursday.\n\"He was moving, cutting full speed, getting full-speed shots up, so it's encouraging,\" Bulls coach Fred Hoiberg said. \"Now, a big part of it is getting the confidence that he can get out there and take a blow. I played with Reggie Miller when he did it, and he was really conscious of, 'If I get hit again, is something going to happen?' But he's got to have the confidence that the doctors, once they clear him 100 percent and that bone's healed, that he's able to go full speed.\"\nRose confirmed Taj Gibson's inadvertent elbow fractured his bone on a drive early in the Bulls' first practice of training camp. He said staying confined to his house for two weeks proved his toughest test as doctors didn't want his blood pressure elevated.\n\"I haven't had any pain since the first couple days. It's a long process of just letting it heal,\" Rose said. \"You can't ice it, so just got to live with it, looking like this for a little minute.\"\nRose said he had input in which mask to wear and chuckled when asked how long he'd wear it.\n\"I got fitted for it like two days ago and the guy from Michigan sent it today, so it's all about getting used to it,\" Rose said. \"When I first put it on it was a little uncomfortable, but through practice I got more comfortable with it and it feels alright. I was able to shoot, my eye opened up a little bit more.\n\"He gave me a couple options that I can go with but I took the one that I think is kind of similar to (Russell) Westbrook's where it doesn't have anything guarding the nose, so I can breathe a little more better I guess. That was my only option -- did I want something under my nose or not.\n\"I hate getting my face touched so if it's a thing where I come out and I'm hot, I'm feeling it, and we're playing good, you might see it for the rest of my career.\"\n(c)2015 Chicago Tribune\nVisit the Chicago Tribune at www.chicagotribune.com\n ", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/basketball/s-1738468&hashtags=ArcaMax", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/basketball/s-1738468", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/basketball/s-1738468&h=Derrick+Rose+after+1st+workout+with+new+mask%3A+%27It%27s+improving%27"], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T08:12:35.911+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
