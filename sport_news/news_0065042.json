Can buffaloes talk? Am I going nuts?\nI will answer them one by one. I am talking because someone has to speak for buffaloes. Yes, buffaloes do talk. I am not particularly sure about you, since we’ve just met, but Indians are definitely going nuts.\nAre you upset cows are getting all the attention?\nI will not qualify that with a response.\nYou sound like you have been oppressed?\nYou sound like you were born yesterday. Can you tell the difference between the milk of a cow and a buffalo? Can you tell the difference between our urine and theirs? We produce more dung per capita than cows yet…\nI feel your pain.\nNo you don’t.\nWhat are your political ambitions?\nAnnihilation of cow.\nDo you have a strategy?\nYes. We are talking to Lalit Modi.\nWhy do you think cows are preferred over you?\nFair skin. There can be no other reason. From Vedic times our output and outlook has remained the same. The cows have forever enjoyed the fair skin advantage. It is in the nature of cows to politicise. They have appropriated all that genuinely belonged to us. We are ready to give up our claims if the cows can prove they are better than us.\nBetter in what way?\nBetter citizens, of course.\nWhat is your favourite book?\nThe Constitution of India.\nWhat do you like about it?\nThe taste. Makes for a great cud experience. Dung is better and it burns faster, better, causing less pollution.\nI thought you read.\nAre you stupid? Buffaloes don’t read.\nAre you in touch with other buffaloes?\nYes. We are thinking of a mass volunteer-based movement on the lines of the RSS.\nDo you really want people to mother worship buffaloes?\nNo. Not as such. We want equality. We want everything the cow gets. If that means being worshipped, then sure, we want to be worshipped, although we don’t raise the matter internally as it angers the liberal buffaloes.\nDo liberal buffaloes exist?\nWhich world are you from? Yes, liberal buffaloes do exist. Two have served the country as chief ministers too. They are traitors. Cow worshippers.\nWhere do you get your sense of humour?\nFrom dead cow jokes.\nIsn’t that insensitive?\nI will not qualify that with a response.\nWhat do you think of the Prime Minister? Do you hold him responsible for what is happening?\nNo. We do not blame the PM. Our party believes that the PM is not being beefed properly. Once the beefing is accurate, things should change.\nYou have any message for the men and women of the country?\nSorry.
