Consider the 2nd Annual DMK Sorta Marathon on Saturday, Oct. 10, as being in that spirit, with proceeds going to the Chicago chapter of A Special Wish Foundation .\nThe 4-mile event begins at 1:30 p.m. outside of DMK Burger Bar , 2954 N. Sheffield Ave., and ends with unlimited draft beer at its sister establishment, Henry's Swing Club , 18 W. Hubbard St. The entry fee is $20 and can be paid here .\nParticipants can run “or walk, or drive, or Segway, for you non-racers,” according to the event’s website. You’ll get a limited edition shirt and all that beer for your exertions. But come in first – however you get there – and you’ll win a $500 DMK Restaurants gift card.\n“Last year, I would say more people drove or used the train than actually ran,” said Lindsey Becker, DMK’s marketing director.\nA Special Wish Foundation's Chicago chapter will use the proceeds to help 18-month-old twin girls with a genetic disorder called spinal muscle atrophy who need special wheelchairs and a vehicle to get around. Becker said DMK Restaurants hopes to do more events or conduct specials to raise more money for the chapter in the future.\nRegistration for Saturday's event begins at 1:30 p.m. outside DMK Burger Bar. The race begins at 2 p.m. The free draft beer ends at Henry’s Swing Club at 5 p.m. Becker said Lagunitas Brewing Co. has donated three of their beers and 30 keepsake glasses for the first 30 people to arrive at Henry's. Allagash Brewing Co. and Old Style also donated beer, she said.\nwdaley@tribpub.com\nTwitter: @billdaley\nPrivacy Policy Chicago Marathon Segway Inc.", "external_links": ["http://oldstylebeer.com/", "http://www.tribpub.com/privacy-policy-and-your-privacy-rights/", "https://secure.sosh.com/chicago/marketplace/the-second-annual-dmk-sorta-marathon-to-benefit-a-special-wish101015/m/ERyj7/", "https://www.chicagomarathon.com/", "http://henrys-chicago.com/", "http://www.allagash.com/", "http://www.aswchicago.org/", "http://dmkburgerbar.com/the-2nd-annual-dmk-sorta-marathon-is-back/", "http://dmkburgerbar.com/", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-56168bcb/turbine/ct-sorta-marathon-links-burgers-brew-for-good-cause07", "https://lagunitas.com/"], "published": "2015-10-08T18:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T00:50:04.484+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
