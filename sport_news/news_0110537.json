Points leader and Mercedes teammate Lewis Hamilton was fifth at 1:55.693 after taking just four laps. \nHamilton is chasing his second consecutive world championship and third overall. He'll clinch the title if he finishes nine points ahead of Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel and two points ahead of Rosberg on Sunday. \nHamilton may have to battle wet conditions all weekend. Forecasters predict heavy rain through Saturday with the potential for some showers again Sunday. Copyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
