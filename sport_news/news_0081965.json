Marshall was seen about 100 feet from the finish line on the west side of Prospect Park, wearing a fedora as he ran. The race announced that the star wideout was approaching the finish line right before he got there. \nMarshall tweeted that he was running the race for his non-profit organization Project 375 and dedicating each mile of the race to a different mental illness. Marshall announced in 2011 that he had been diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder. Bryn Lennon/Getty Images Brandon Marshall and the Jets are on a bye week after beating the Dolphins in London last week. \nThe idea of the Rock ’n’ Roll Half Marathon is that live bands encourage participants with music throughout the course. \nThe Jets are currently on their bye week after a hot 3-1 start to the season. Marshall, acquired during the offseason in a trade with the Bears, has been a big part of the early-season success, having caught 30 passes for 400 yards and three touchdowns this season. We dedicate each mile of the #RnRBrooklyn to those w/ #mentalillness .
