Through all of this we remain concerned for Steve and hope that it will give him the opportunity to focus on his personal well being.\"\nThis termination comes after Steve Sarkisian took an indefinite leave of absence after Haden determined that the troubled coach is \"not healthy.\"\nHaden wasn't specific about the reasons for Sarkisian's absence, only saying that \"it was very clear to me\" that the second-year USC coach was unwell. Haden asked Sarkisian to take a leave during a phone conversation.\nSarkisian publicly apologized before the season after he appeared to be intoxicated while making an unsteady public statement at the Salute to Troy pep rally. He announced he would be getting unspecified treatment, but didn't believe he had a drinking problem, blaming his appearance on combining alcohol and medication.\n>> PHOTOS: Sarkisian looks for answers after USC's shocking loss to UW\nSarkisian is 12-6 during his short tenure leading the talented Trojans, who were dropped from the AP Top 25 after losing 17-12 to unranked Washington last Thursday. Sarkisian had been on the road recruiting during the long weekend, but apparently wasn't in condition to lead practice Sunday, according to Haden.\nWant to talk about the news of the day?
