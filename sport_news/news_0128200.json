Saturday’s 1-3 home defeat to Southampton was the reigning champions’ fourth in eight English Premier League (EPL) games. Among a string of accusations and explanations the Portuguese said Chelsea would have to “sack the best manager in their history”. “People can say what they want. I think you should go straight to the players. Get a table at Cobham (training ground) next week — John Terry doesn’t go to the national team, Diego Costa doesn’t go, Ramires doesn’t go. Ask them,” Mourinho was quoted as saying by goal.com on Sunday. “If they tell you they don’t trust me, that is the only thing that can make me resign. The only thing. But not fake sources. The players at the table,” the 52-year-old said. The former Real Madrid and Inter Milan tactician also claimed he is enjoying some aspects of what he has called the “worst” run of his managerial career. “It makes me understand how big a guy I am. I am not afraid. I’m not crying, I’m not desperate. It makes me realise how big I was, how big I am,” he said. “When you win and you win titles and you are champion, life is easy. It’s easy to be proud. It’s easy to be what you are,” Mourinho said.
