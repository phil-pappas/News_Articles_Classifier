And while the folks in Vegas think it will be a wide margin of victory for the Bulldogs the college football experts from around the ‘net are predicting a different outcome. If you agree then you better buckle up for another tight game for UK on Saturday night. Here are your predictions from around the world wide web: ESPN \n\nWhy Kentucky wins: Kentucky has been involved in a close game against every team it has faced this season — good or bad, home or road — so not much should faze these Wildcats, even a raucous Davis Wade Stadium. Junior quarterback Patrick Towles had one of his best career performances against Mississippi State last season and this group played a the then-No. 1 ranked Bulldogs tough. With Towles and the young offensive cast surrounding him now a year older and more mature, they should be able to hang tough against a good, but not great, Mississippi State team. Call it a gut feeling; I think the Wildcats find a way to steal one in a tough road environment. — Sam Khan Jr. \nWhy Mississippi State wins: Listen, I like the progress that Kentucky is making under Mark Stoops, but the Wildcats are double-digit underdogs on the road. Stoops has already earned a couple of statement wins this season, but I think State is simply the better team and will win fairly comfortably in cowbell land. — David Ching", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T07:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T08:02:56.060+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
