The No. 3 overall pick in the draft, a one-and-done our of Duke was followed by Stanley Johnson of the Detroit Pistons (19.4%) and No. 1 draft pick Karl-Anthony Towns of the Minnesota Timberwolves (12.9%) as the top vote getters in the category. D’Angelo Russell of the Los Angeles Lakers (40%) was voted best playmaker in this year’s rookie class while Devin Booker of the Phoenix Suns (58.8%) was named the best shooter. NBA general managers predict Philadelphia 76ers center Jahlil Okafor received 44.8% for NBA Rookie of the Year, while fellow first-year center, Minnesota’s Karl-Anthony Towns (62.1%), was projected to be the 2015 NBA Draft’s best player five years from now. Johnson received votes in a survey-best seven categories. In addition to Rookie of the Year, he was listed for best career, biggest steal, most athletic, best shooter, best defender and funniest rookie. However, the “big winner” here, if there are any winners in a league website survey held months before the actual season starts, is Jahlil Okafor. This poll reminds us of why most believe, including myself that the Whitney Young (Chicago, Illinois) product is the true impact player of this draft class. It’s yet another reminder of how surprising it is that Okafor slipped to third overall. I’m still surprised he didn’t go #1 or #2. Jahlil Okafor dominating the big category in this survey also reminds us that the Sixers might be on to something in terms of what they’re trying to build in Philadelphia. Check out this exclusive interview we did with Okafor earlier this summer. Nerlens Noel, a man some have dubbed “Anthony Davis 2.0 ,” is giving the Sixers something to truly build around. If he continues to develop they can start to really have a true franchise brand identity; maybe. Instead of the current brand identity, which is pretty much tanking, tanking and more tanking. Now they add another piece in Okafor and start to get an actual foundation in place, finally. \n\nPaul M.
