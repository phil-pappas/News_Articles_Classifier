Is this like a dream to you?'\" Marrow said. \"He was like, 'Coach, this means everything to me.' And you could see it in his eyes. He was like, 'I'm just so thankful for this opportunity.' I told him, 'You ain't getting this opportunity just because I'm trying to put some local kid in. You're the best guy.'\"\nEven in Kentucky's \"Air Raid\" offense, Collins has earned himself a significant role. He's yet to touch the ball, but he's often in as a blocker when the Cats use their two-back, shotgun formations. He was a starter for the first two games in that look and relishes the chance to clear a path for one of the tailbacks or pick up a blitz to protect quarterback Patrick Towles.\n\"I like rough stuff. I grew up with three little brothers, so you could imagine the house was always Mom having to break up this wrestling match and that wrestling match,\" Collins said. \"We broke a couch, somebody fell through a window. That's just the way it is. (Football) is a rough sport, so that's why I love it.\n\"I want to hit people as hard as I can hit 'em and I want to embarrass whoever I'm blocking.\"\nTHE COURIER-JOURNAL\nFollow UK sports on Cats HQ app\nThat hair-on-fire style, his underdog story — after a year at NAIA-level University of Pikeville, he joined the Cats as a non-scholarship, scout-team linebacker in 2013 — and the unusual nickname have quickly made Collins a fan favorite.\nJust before the season opener, word got out that Marrow calls him Taco Meat. It's almost self-explanatory: Collins ate a bunch of taco meat one time. It was supposed to be his uncle's dinner, but he got home first and the bucketful of beef \"became my snack.\"\n\"Reality probably puts it around a pound, maybe even a pound and a half, but the legend's grown all the way up to two pounds,\" said Collins, whose uncle relayed the tale to Marrow and a nickname was born. \"At first, my mom, she wasn't about it. She didn't like it, really. She would say, 'I gave you a name for a reason. I want people to call you by that.' But as it kind of grew, she embraced it a lot faster than I thought she was going to.\"\nThat's because Mama Taco Meat's baby has become sort of famous. At the Cat Walk, where fans greet the team as they enter the stadium on game days, he hears people screaming out his new name. He's seen Taco Meat T-shirts and signs start popping up in the crowd.\nThis is all very surreal to the lifelong UK fan.\n\"To play for the team you grew up loving, this is more than you could ask for,\" Collins said. \"To think somebody thinks you're cool enough to remember your name or make a sign with your name on it, it's pretty cool.\"\nTHE COURIER-JOURNAL\nUK backup receivers looking for more snaps\nCoaches and teammates sense how much it means to their 5-foot-11, 238-pound battering ram. He holds nothing back. When Missouri linebacker Kentrell Brothers, who ranks third nationally in tackles, came barreling into the backfield on a key play two weeks ago, Collins launched himself at the future NFL draft pick.\n\"Straight out flattened him,\" Marrow said. \"When you're sitting there watching that as a team, guys that's on scholarship, guys that's from other places, you see you better play to this standard.\"\nJunior running back Jojo Kemp, who benefited greatly from Collins' blocking late in that victory over the Tigers, said he \"looks up to some like that.\" Kemp is a former four-star recruit with more than 1,000 career rushing yards and has played hero more than once for the Cats.\nUK tight ends coach Vince Marrow on UK's \"Taco Meat\".\nBut \"everybody feeds off Taco Meat,\" he said. \"Didn't have an offer, worked his behind off every single day, showed a lot of passion for the game, practiced like it's a game. Guys that are fortunate enough to have an offer look at that as motivation. You're never too good to go out there and give it your all.\"\nThe question now, of course, is whether the Wildcats will reward Collins with an actual carry or catch. He had 2,908 all-purpose yards and 29 touchdowns as a senior at Breathitt County High School in rural Eastern Kentucky.\n\"He's a pretty good athlete,\" Marrow said with a grin. \"Some things are coming.\"\nPer usual, whenever opportunity knocks, Taco Meat will be prepared.\nTHE COURIER-JOURNAL\nUK offense working for faster starts\n\"I've imagined it since I was 10 years old. I've got my touchdown dance all figured out — what I can get away with, what I can't,\" he said. \"If I ever get my hand on the ball, of course it would be like another dream come true … but I play football first because when I was little, it was the only thing where I could legally hit somebody.\n\"That's what I get to do day in and day out, so it's a pretty sweet gig.\"\nKyle Tucker can be reached at (502) 582-4361.
