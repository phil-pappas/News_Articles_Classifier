California Chrome had been recovering the last few months from a bone bruise injury at a farm in Kentucky. \nSherman says, \"He's a big, strong horse and we've got a long way to go.\" \nCalifornia Chrome's Triple Crown bid was derailed with a fourth-place finish in the Belmont. He was set to run in the Arlington Million in August near Chicago, but those plans were canceled when his injury was found. \nAll content copyright ©2015 Pendleton Times-Post, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T03:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T03:55:19.296+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
