Bathinda SSP Indermohan Bhatti confirmed the arrest. He said a search of his Chandigarh house was on. A case was registered in connection with fake pesticides at Rama Mandi on September 2 after which one Vijay Kumar of Bathinda was arrested on September 15. \"We have arrested Mangal as the earlier arrested accused and few others named him. One (arrested) person confirmed that he had given Rs 8 lakh to the director in Chandigarh for allowing the sale of fake pesticides,\" Bhatti said. He said more arrests would be made in this regard soon. Police sources said that a team of Bathinda police was dispatched to Chandigarh on the orders of Deputy Chief Minister Sukhbir Badal after which the Chandigarh residence of Sandhu was raided. Sandhu was earlier removed from the post for reportedly purchasing pesticide that failed to tackle the whitefly attack on cotton. However, the Punjab and Haryana High Court, on September 28, stayed Sandhu’s transfer orders. Sandhu is accused of having placed an order to buy 92,000 litre Oberon — a pesticide not recommended by Punjab Agricultural University (PAU) — without floating tenders or getting into competitive bidding. He is also accused of having bought the pesticide at a price higher than the market rate. In market, it is available for Rs 3,000 a litre, but Sandhu reportedly bought it for Rs 3,550 per litre. The pesticide was bought for Rs 33 crore in eight districts of Malwa region. Congress leader of opposition Sunil Jakhar had alleged: “Sandhu is just a sacrificial lamb. More than 2.5 lakh hectares of 5 lakh hectares cotton crop has been destroyed. It is the minister and the political leaders of the ruling dispensation who should take the responsibility and resign.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T12:28:24.440+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
