This was not something to address something that was a surprise or anything. It was something to get him some additional strength.\"\nUSA TODAY\nBell Tolls: Jerry Jones still won't hold back when speaking his mind\nJones maintains that Bryant, who broke the fifth metatarsal, is ahead of his rehab schedule and has been able to do light running, although his ability to cut has been limited.\n\"Impressively active in his rehab,\" Jones put it.\nThe Cowboys are targeting their Oct. 25 game against the New York Giants, following a bye week, as the earliest date for Bryant's return.\nDespite Bryant's rapid progress, Jones is mindful of the setbacks that Atlanta Falcons star Julio Jones encountered while coming back from a similar injury. Friday's procedure – Bryant left Dallas at 7 a.m. and returned by Noon, Jones said – was viewed by Jones as a method to reduce risk.\nUSA TODAY\n5 matchups that will define NFL Week 5: Andy Dalton's proving ground\n\"If anything, it would cause us, when he gets to that week (of returning), this will make us feel better about it, and how it will hold up,\" Jones said. \"The issue is holding up.\"\nPain tolerance will be another indicator for Bryant.\nSaid Jones, \"Daily, he's testing the limit of how far he can go.\"\n96 CONNECT 49 TWEET LINKEDIN 1 COMMENT EMAIL MORE TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": ["http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1RAubqY&mini=true", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1RAubqY&text=Dez%20Bryant%20received%20therapeutic%20injection%20in%20foot%20to%20bolster%20healing&via=usatoday", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9d37b34edec2d8dc1027bc752dbb45013fce0899/c=0-0-2260-2260/local/-/media/2015/10/10/USATODAY/USATODAY/635801023095051930-c01-jones-sline-1008.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/1b4077c275f1ec3deffe1125683540ed4436b9ab/r=245x400/local/-/media/2015/10/10/USATODAY/USATODAY/635801154173549286-USP-NFL-Atlanta-Falcons-at-Dallas-Cowboys.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/7052dedde644d5f826e7696a6e310e19cd57bb58/c=0-0-2628-2628/local/-/media/2015/10/10/USATODAY/USATODAY/635800820541122522-USP-NFL-KANSAS-CITY-CHIEFS-AT-CINCINNATI-BENGALS-76484396.JPG", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/2d4a8e846a5a4bceea8bfd6e68b9216952658aa7/c=0-387-2624-3886&r=537&c=0-0-534-712/local/-/media/2015/10/10/USATODAY/USATODAY/635801154173549286-USP-NFL-Atlanta-Falcons-at-Dallas-Cowboys.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/10/10/USATODAY/USATODAY/635801154173549286-USP-NFL-Atlanta-Falcons-at-Dallas-Cowboys.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-11T07:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T08:16:57.960+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
