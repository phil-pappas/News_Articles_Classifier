This is my turn and I'm proud to be Blackpool manager.\" \nThe 49-year-old was on Allardyce's coaching staff at Bolton before becoming his right-hand man at both Blackburn and West Ham, but McDonald stressed that being a manager himself was always on his agenda after a short stint with Carlisle. \n\"It's something I wanted to do,\" he added. \n\"I've been a huge support to Sam over the last six years at Blackburn and West Ham but I think it's my turn. I've worked hard to get my chance and I'm working hard at Blackpool to get things right on the pitch.\" \nAsked to unequivocally put the Sunderland suggestion to bed, he replied: \"There's been no contact, first of all, and I'm happy with what I'm doing.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T13:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T20:07:28.312+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
