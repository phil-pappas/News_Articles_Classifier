It was revealed Wednesday that Solder suffered a torn right biceps. He’ll undergo surgery and is done for the season, presumably leaving Marcus Cannon to protect Tom Brady’s blindside. The news was more encouraging for Hightower, who had four tackles and a sack on nine defensive snaps against the Cowboys before departing with a rib injury with six minutes left in the first quarter. Hightower, who ranks second on the team in tackles (26) and has 2.5 sacks, was a limited participant in a padded practice. The fact he didn’t sit out the entire workout is nothing but a positive sign as the Patriots prepare to face the Colts on Sunday in Indianapolis. If Hightower can’t play or is limited against the Colts, the Patriots have some viable options to soak up his snaps — which checked in at 84.7 percent (171 of 202) in the first three games. Against the Cowboys, they increased the workload of Jerod Mayo and inserted backup Jonathan Freeny into the mix. Freeny played 25 snaps, or 10 more than he got in the first three games, and recovered a fumble. “I was just called to step in,” Freeny said. “We had a guy go down and my number was called and I just had to go in there and execute.” Freeny spent the last three seasons playing for the Miami Dolphins. He was, as is the case here, a core special teams player and backup linebacker. The 6-foot-2, 255-pound Rutgers alum only made 15 tackles in 44 games with the Dolphins, a career-high five coming in a Week 17 loss to the Patriots 2012. But the Patriots liked his defensive potential and signed him to a one-year deal in March. While Mayo is all but relegated to run-stopping duties these days, Freeny is serviceable in pass coverage. “It’s just a part of my game,” Freeny said. “I try to work on everything as far as being a linebacker and here we work on a lot of different things, so just being here and having an opportunity to work on it day in and day out, I think has just helped me.” Then there’s Jon Bostic, who was acquired in a trade with the Chicago Bears on Sept. 29 during the bye week. The versatile linebacker was inactive against the Cowboys, although it’s unclear if that was due to an ankle injury that has kept him off the field all season. Bostic wasn’t listed on the injury report on Wednesday, so he’s apparently healthy now. He also believes he’s been making sufficient progress when it comes to his playbook studies. “I feel like the learning curve is going well,” Bostic said. “My thing is I just keep coming in every day, learning more of the defense and the philosophy, how they want to play on defense.” Bostic led the Bears in tackles last season and broke up three passes. He has experience in both 3-4 and 4-3 schemes, although he’s more at home in the latter, and is considered to be a player who is comfortable in space, whether it’s tracking down a runner or covering a receiver. “There are a lot of guys who can do a lot of different things in the linebacker room,” Bostic said while downplaying his skill set. “We push each other and this is a tight group, everyone is always hanging together. That’s what make it fun and makes the transition a little bit easier.” As for Hightower, he’s now suffered an injury in three of his four seasons since being drafted 25th overall by the Patriots in 2012. Hightower missed two games with a hamstring issue as a rookie, an injury that nagged him for the final three months of the season. He missed four games last season with a torn labrum, but also played through the pain of the shoulder injury in close to a dozen games before undergoing offseason surgery. Hightower also suffered a torn ACL as a sophomore at Alabama that ended his season. But it could be his latest injury is one that won’t affect his availability. If it does, the likes of Freeny and Bostic are ready to step up and step in.
