The Royals earned an important win with major playoff implications. They did it by keeping the Knights offense off of the field for nearly an hour. The Royals had offensive two series back-to-back of over seven minutes. One at the end of the half and the other after the intermission. \nBut, it was not all easy for the Royals. Bishop Ready (3-3) received the opening kickoff and marched down the field on just nine plays to take an early 7-0 lead on a Devin Dukes 10-yard run that seemed to let the air out of the Royals. As the Knights kicked off, a pooch kick caught the Royals off guard and the Knights recovered. \nWynford (5-1) then found its defensive groove and forced the Knights into a fourth and long situation that saw the snap go past quarterback Dominic Lombardi and the Royals recovered with great field position. \n\"We came out really flat which was a little disappointing since they had to travel like they did and they came out with more energy,\" Wynford coach Gabe Helbert said. \"We responded after their first drive and we did not get down when we messed up and did not field the kick off properly. I thought our kids did a great job of responding and flying to the football.\" Buy Photo October 2, 2015 FOOTBALL: BIshop Ready at Wynford Mike Dornbirer/News Journal October 2, 2015 FOOTBALL: BIshop Ready at Wynford Mike Dornbirer/News Journal October 2, 2015 FOOTBALL: BIshop Ready at Wynford Mike Dornbirer/News Journal October 2, 2015 FOOTBALL: BIshop Ready at Wynford Mike Dornbirer/News Journal October 2, 2015 FOOTBALL: BIshop Ready at Wynford Mike Dornbirer/News Journal October 2, 2015 FOOTBALL: BIshop Ready at Wynford Mike Dornbirer/News Journal October 2, 2015 FOOTBALL: BIshop Ready at Wynford Mike Dornbirer/News Journal October 2, 2015 FOOTBALL: BIshop Ready at Wynford Mike Dornbirer/News Journal October 2, 2015 FOOTBALL: BIshop Ready at Wynford Mike Dornbirer/News Journal October 2, 2015 FOOTBALL: BIshop Ready at Wynford Mike Dornbirer/News Journal October 2, 2015 FOOTBALL: BIshop Ready at Wynford Mike Dornbirer/News Journal October 2, 2015 FOOTBALL: BIshop Ready at Wynford Mike Dornbirer/News Journal October 2, 2015 FOOTBALL: BIshop Ready at Wynford Mike Dornbirer/News Journal October 2, 2015 FOOTBALL: BIshop Ready at Wynford Mike Dornbirer/News Journal October 2, 2015 FOOTBALL: BIshop Ready at Wynford Mike Dornbirer/News Journal October 2, 2015 FOOTBALL: BIshop Ready at Wynford Mike Dornbirer/News Journal October 2, 2015 FOOTBALL: BIshop Ready at Wynford Mike Dornbirer/News Journal October 2, 2015 FOOTBALL: BIshop Ready at Wynford Mike Dornbirer/News Journal October 2, 2015 FOOTBALL: BIshop Ready at Wynford Mike Dornbirer/News Journal October 2, 2015 FOOTBALL: BIshop Ready at Wynford Mike Dornbirer/News Journal October 2, 2015 FOOTBALL: BIshop Ready at Wynford Mike Dornbirer/News Journal October 2, 2015 FOOTBALL: BIshop Ready at Wynford Mike Dornbirer/News Journal October 2, 2015 FOOTBALL: BIshop Ready at Wynford Mike Dornbirer/News Journal October 2, 2015 FOOTBALL: BIshop Ready at Wynford Mike Dornbirer/News Journal October 2, 2015 FOOTBALL: BIshop Ready at Wynford Mike Dornbirer/News Journal October 2, 2015 FOOTBALL: BIshop Ready at Wynford Mike Dornbirer/News Journal October 2, 2015 FOOTBALL: BIshop Ready at Wynford Mike Dornbirer/News Journal October 2, 2015 FOOTBALL: BIshop Ready at Wynford Mike Dornbirer/News Journal October 2, 2015 FOOTBALL: BIshop Ready at Wynford Mike Dornbirer/News Journal October 2, 2015 FOOTBALL: BIshop Ready at Wynford Mike Dornbirer/News Journal Like this topic?

It forced two three-and-out punts on back-to-back Knight series. \n\"It was just a matter of getting hats to the football,\" Helbert said of the defensive turnaround. \"The touchdown they scored, we blitzed right into it and had a great defense dialed up we just got out of our rush lanes. After that we were very sound and our kids just partied to the football.\" \nMeanwhile, the Wynford offense went on a 19-play, 7:24 drive that ended with a Zach Hoffman bulldozing run into the endzone with just 53 seconds left in the half. Wyford took a 14-7 advantage into the halftime locker room. The Royals did it with 19 run plays thanks in part to a harsh wind that made it impossible to pass. \n\"The conditions were not conducive to throw the football and our offensive line did a great job controlling the line of scrimmage, Helbert added. \"I am just very proud of our offensive line and our backs. Nick Looker and Zach Hoffman did an excellent job running the football and our receivers blocked well.\" \nThe Royals came out and received the opening kickoff and marched down the field taking 7:35 off of the clock and a 20-7 lead on a Hoffman 6-yard run. The quarterback finished with 28 carries for 182 yards and three touchdowns. \n\"Zach is a competitor and he is a kid who since he was a little kid has been at all of our camps through the years and has always wanted to be the guy,\" Helbert said. \"He has been preparing himself mentally and physically to be the guy. We are very fortunate to have him. His teammates love him and he loves the competition. He just comes out and plays hard.\" \nThe Knights would add on another touchdown late but the game was well in hand and Looker would pound in another touchdown from seven yards out. The running back finished with 22 carries for 116 yards and two touchdowns. Between Looker and Hoffman, the pair racked up 286 yards rushing and scored all five touchdowns. \nHelbert knows how big this win was for the Royals. \n\"It is one at a time. This one was important because it was against a nonleague team we were unfamiliar with but still had a ton of respect for,\" Helbert said. \"We are honored to play them and it was just a huge win for our football program.\" \nHoffman also completed just one pass on one attempt for 15 yards to Looker. It was with his legs that made all the difference, yet he will not take all of the credit. \n\"I just wanted to run down field and run as hard as I can,\" Hoffman said. \"I have to give all of the credit to the coaches for preparing us and the offensive line for opening up so many holes for me to fun through. They did a great job. I just want to get the W's.\" \nLooker was just following orders during his bruising runs. \n\"Our coaches emphasized to be physical this week and we owe it to our front line,\" Looker said. \"This was a huge win for us and we will enjoy it together.\" \nThe Royals will be back in action next week as they host the Seneca East Tigers in a battle of top tier teams in the Northern 10 conference. \njfurr@gannett.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T01:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T09:08:32.744+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
