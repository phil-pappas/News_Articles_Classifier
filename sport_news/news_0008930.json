Not only did a few Lakers advance to state, but the entire team would be one of eight in pursuit of a state title for the very first time. \"I was very proud of the girls for getting to the state tournament as a team, making school history and their play when they got there,\" Camdenton coach Jane Eidson said. \"These girls have talked about this for several years and this year it all came together.\" The stage was set as Camdenton took on Marquette, St. Joseph Academy, Warrensburg, Rock Bridge, Notre Dame de Sion, Blue Springs and Fort Zumwalt South at Rivercut Golf Course in Springfield on October 12 and 13. Marquette took the team title with a score of 662 while Camdenton finished eighth with 737 points. Sophomore Jennah Schell said she was nervous competing among the best golfers in the state of Missouri. The sophomore said she did not visualize being there at the beginning of the year, but she was able to find her groove and have fun playing the game. \"I was really nervous the first day and I didn't know what to expect since it was my first year going so it was really difficult,\" she recalled. \"The second day I was able to relax more and play my 'A-game'. Last year I was shooting in the high 50s still and this year I am finally in the low 40s and made it to state so it is really crazy to think about that.\" Schell attributed the improvement to all the time and hard work she put in with her father during the off-season. She hopes to continue returning to state and her next goal is to make the top 50. \"I do tournaments in the summer and my dad and I just go practice every day of every week and it has helped me improve to be the golfer I am today,\" Schell said. Amber Wilson led the Lakers among the 86 golfers from other schools competing for an individual state championship. Wilson shot a 161, which tied her for 15th along with two other golfers. Amber Theobald finished 75th with a score of 190. Schell finished right behind her in 76th with a 191, Katie Bird tied for 81st with one other golfer at 195 and Katelyn Bartels rounded things up in 91st at 217. Wilson's finish qualified her as an All-State golfer and she became just the second Laker to do so along with 2010 graduate Joni Purvis who made All-State in 2008, 2009 and finished her career as a state champion in 2010. \"Amber played hard and hung in there on her second round,\" Eidson said of the sophomore. \"She is a hard worker and plays year round so I am so glad to see all of this hard work pay off for her.\" Page 2 of 2 - Wilson said she was glad to be able to accomplish the feat this early in her career and she has big goals in mind for what lies ahead. \"It felt good to be up there as a sophomore with the other golfers who were mostly seniors,\" Wilson noted. \"I plan on getting All-State again the next two years and hopefully winning state one year. I will be practicing all the time and in the winter I play inside.\" The bar has been raised for the golf program at Camdenton and Eidson is looking forward to what can be accomplished next. For now, she can look back on the journey of this season and smile when thinking about what the team has already done. \"We know it can be done and we will have to continue to work hard to get there again,\" Eidson said on reaching the state tournament. \"This has been such a great season and I love the fact that it was truly a team effort at each tournament and match. It was a major key that this group of girls have worked on their golf skills throughout the year and then stepped it up during the season. The hard work really paid off.\" Time will soon tell if Camdenton will be in the hunt for another state title next fall.
