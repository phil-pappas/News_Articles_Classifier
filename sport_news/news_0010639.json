(Kena Krutsinger/Getty Images/AFP) By : Steve Ginsburg | on 2:41 PM October 08,   More Sports \nNFL owners voted on Wednesday to extend the league's commitment to play international regular-season games through 2025, including the option to play outside of the United Kingdom beginning next season. \nThe resolution, ratified during a one-day owners' meeting in New York, broadens a 2011 agreement that permitted the NFL to schedule games at London's Wembley Stadium through 2016. \n\"This marks an important step in our long-term international growth,\" NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said in a statement. \"Fans in the UK have responded incredibly well to the regular-season games we have play ed in London since 2007. \n\"They have demanded more NFL games and we have worked to accommodate them.\" \nThe 2016 schedule of international regular-season games will be announced later this fall, the NFL said, with other countries in addition to the UK in contention to host the games . \nMexico and Germany are widely seen as the leading contenders. \n\"We think it's time to expand our international series to other countries and respond to the growing interest in our game not only in the UK but elsewhere around the world,\" Goodell said. \nThree NFL games will be play ed this season at Wembley Stadium in London. \nThe New York Jets defeated the Miami Dolphins, 27-14, at Wembley last Sunday before a sellout crowd of 83,986. The Buffalo Bills play the Jacksonville Jaguars on Oct. 25 and the Detroit Lions face the Kansas City Chiefs on Nov. 1. \nNFL owners approved a resolution in 2006 to play up to two international regular-season games per season from 2007 to 2011. The 2011 resolution was UK -focused and permitted the NFL the flexibility to decide the number of UK games from year to year. \nThe NFL play ed only one game in Wembley for six seasons before raising it to two games in 2013 and then to three in 2014 and 2015. \nIn July, the NFL and the English Premier League's Tottenham Hotspur soccer club announced an agreement to play a minimum of two games per year during a 10-year deal at Tottenham's new stadium, due to open in the summer of 2018. \nReuters", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T00:56:20.157+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
