The defending AL champions do not come with overwhelming power, but they are strong throughout the lineup. And they rarely whiff. \nThere was a worry about how the Blue Jays would handle Cueto, who was so dominant in the Royals’ clincher against Houston in the previous round. With his funky wind-ups and delayed pitches, Cueto can keep an offence off balance. However, the Blue Jays hammered Cueto over the last 12 batters he faced, producing three walks, a hit batter and six hits. The biggest of those was a Troy Tulowitzki three-run homer to straightaway centre, scoring Encarnacion and Chris Colabello to start the third. Tulowitzki now has four hits in the last two games after having just a pair combined in his first six playoff games combined. \n“We desperately needed that break out,” Blue Jays manager John Gibbons said. \n“You never know if you are (going to break out). We have a lot of confidence in the team that we have here, the ability that we have here,” Donaldson added. “Our lineup, we feel like, is second to none.” \nCueto did not record a single out in the third frame. A run-scoring double from Kevin Pillar chased the Royals starter from the game, and Cueto mockingly acknowledged the crowd. The fans responded by chanting “Thank you Cueto” and “We want Cueto.” Donaldson said that Cueto looked to be searching for his release point, but did not know if that explained his struggles. Regardless, he repeatedly left the ball up in the strike zone. He would be the likely Game 7 starter for Royals in this series, should it happen. There is a long way to go until that destination, surely. \nKris Medlen, Cueto’s replacement, was sharper than Cueto. He still could not shut down the Blue Jays attack, though, surrendering a mammoth’ two-run blast to Donaldson to cap that third inning. Ryan Goins, whose Game 2 blunder in the field started the Royals’ comeback, added a home run in the fifth inning, going along nicely with a single that drove in the Blue Jays’ first two runs of the evening in the second. \nIt was good that the Blue Jays’ offence was so persistent, because the Royals’ attack was true to form again: They just kept on putting the bat on the baseball, and it would have been good enough to produce a win in most games. \nEven as Blue Jays starter Marcus Stroman got out of the second inning without giving up a run, the Royals appeared to be on the young Jays starter. That is what the Royals do, though — make contact, often sharply. They manufactured a run in the third inning with a Ben Zobrist double, Lorenzo Cain infield single and a soft tapper that went as a RBI fielder’s choice from Hosmer. They wound up with 15 hits to Toronto’s 11. They just lacked the big shots, save for a ninth-inning home run from Kendrys Morales off of Roberto Osuna. \n“Every pitch matters, and especially facing a lineup like Kansas City, who is strong one through nine,” Stroman said. “Every single (hitter) battles, battles, battles, puts the ball in play.
