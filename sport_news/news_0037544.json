Utley, whose take-out slide in Game 2 broke the leg of shortstop Ruben Tejada, was active, as his appeal of MLB's two-game suspension was pending, but he never got off Los Angeles' bench. Tejada, introduced before the game, got a thunderous ovation \nPerhaps it would have been most fitting if Harvey, the flamboyant righthander from Fitch High in Groton, had fashioned a signature gem in the first playoff game in Queens since Carlos Beltran took that regrettable third strike to end the 2006 NLCS. \nHarvey, whether by design or not, brings drama with him whenever he takes the mound in New York, be it his long-debated innings limit a year after elbow surgery, be it his missing a mandatory workout last weekend, or be it the expectation that he would be the one to strike the retaliatory blow for the Utley-Tejada play. All of that was in the air when the bright lights went up Monday night. \nWhen the Dodgers touched him for three runs in the second inning, Harvey's night had the feel of a Broadway flop. But he stopped the Dodgers right there, struck out seven, and his teammates saved the show with a franchise record for scoring in a postseason game. \n\"Matt Harvey worked harder tonight to give us five quality innings than I've ever seen him work,\" Collins said. \"He walked off the mound after the second inning, and he said, 'That's all they're getting.'\" \nGranderson's bases-clearing double was the big hit, giving the Mets a 4-3 lead in the second. D'Arnaud's two-run homer in the third made it 6-3, and Cespedes, whose arrival on Aug. 1 proved to be the final piece of this Mets mosaic, hit a three-run shot in the fourth to make it 10-3. Granderson drove in two more in the seventh. \n\"It was definitely a battle,\" Harvey said. \"The offense came up big and really picked me up.\" \nBy then, it was only a matter of whether Dodgers manager Don Mattingly would give the fans chanting \"We want Utley\" what they wanted. He did not, and the controversy figures to simmer down with the Mets putting the champagne on ice in anticipation. \n\"Scoring runs like we did, it did all the talking,\" Harvey said. \"Let our play do the talking, and that other stuff can be resolved later.\" \nAs expected, Utley got a going over from the fans during the introductions, but since he was not in the starting lineup, the issue was quickly pushed aside. The game was too important, as Collins emphatically noted beforehand. \n\"When Ruben came out, the roar exceeded even my expectations,\" Granderson said. \nHarvey took center stage in the electric atmosphere and set the Dodgers down quickly in the first. But in the second, the Dodgers peppered him. Justin Turner, Andre Ethier and Carl Crawford stroked singles to load the bases with no outs. Then, with the Mets infield up at the corners, Yasmani Grandal singled to right, scoring two runs, and when the throw from Granderson got away from David Wright at third base, a third run scored. Wright leapt high to snag Howie Kendrick's two-out liner, or the Dodgers would have had more than a 3-0 lead. \nThe Mets' hitters, held mostly in check in L.A., busted out against lefty Brett Anderson in the bottom of the inning. Cespedes beat out an infield chopper, then Lucas Duda singled, and d'Arnaud singled to score a run. After Kendrick fumbled Wilmer Flores' soft grounder, an infield hit, Anderson got the next two out. But Granderson drove his first pitch off the wall in right-center field, clearing the bases to give the Mets a 4-3 lead. \nIt was Harvey's game again. The Dodgers put two on, but Harvey struck out Ethier and Crawford, his pitch count rising to 61 through three innings. \nCespedes singled and d'Arnaud homered in the bottom of the inning, opening the Mets' lead to 6-3. Alex Wood replaced Anderson in the fourth, and the Mets blew it open, Daniel Murphy singling in a run and Cespedes crushing a 2-and-2 pitch for a three-run homer into the second tier in left to make it 10-3. \n\"The big thing is continuing to believe in each other,\" Granderson said, \"and understanding the effort level continues to be high.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T08:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T13:38:12.113+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
