Saw where an NBA GM said no way he would be eligible to play. Brian October 12, 2015 at 8:37 pm | Permalink \nMy only question is, why would an NBA exec know anything about what the NCAA is going to do? Parvenu October 12, 2015 at 9:04 pm | Permalink \nSure you “saw” that. Who was the GM. Link? Megan October 12, 2015 at 9:09 pm | Permalink \nI saw it, too. It’s the first result I got when I googled Skal. Wasn’t sure about the credibility of the source, though. intheshadow October 13, 2015 at 12:04 am | Permalink \n“ESPN’s Jeff Goodman reported that Kentucky superstar freshman Skal Labissiere has not yet been cleared to play by the NCAA. The organization reportedly has concerns about his guardian Gerald Hamilton, who brought the center to the U.S. from Haiti. We haven’t heard much since, but FOX Sports Australia basketball writer Olgun Uluc reports that one NBA executive doesn’t think Labissiere will play this season.” Eric October 12, 2015 at 8:29   \nI’d say most people hope not on drake coming back. Most people have know idea who he is or what he does. CATSFANINBAMA October 12, 2015 at 10:13 pm | Permalink \nMost people have no idea who Drake is? Are you 80 and hanging out at Catholic bingo halls? Redneck Cat Fan October 12, 2015 at 8:39   \nDrake? Again? Why not Montgomrey Gentry?!? This is on you Mitch!! CATSFANINBAMA October 12, 2015 at 10:16 pm | Permalink \nOur players and recruits probably don’t even know who Montgomery Gentry is. Drake loves Kentucky and recruits are far more likely to like Drake. I care most about impressing and exciting them. Matt October 12, 2015 at 9:16   \nAny news on what part of the Arena the stage for BBM will be? I know sometimes it is in the end zone where the student section usually is, and a couple of times it has been where the team benches are on the sidelines.
