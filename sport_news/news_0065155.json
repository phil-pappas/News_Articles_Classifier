Then it was the defense's turn. \nAlabama (7-1, 4-1) had two straight sacks and Ryan Anderson knocked the ball loose from Joshua Dobbs to preserve the victory. \n\"My heart was about to jump out of my chest when the offense was on that last drive, when they punched it in,\" Tide cornerback Cyrus Jones said. \"Then we did our job to seal the win.\" \nThe Tide got plenty of help, with Tennessee missing three long field goals. \nThe Volunteers took the lead on Jalen Hurd's 12-yard scoring run with 5:49 left. Alabama overwhelmed the 15-point underdogs from there. \nCoker moved Alabama downfield thanks to athletic catches by ArDarius Stewart and Calvin Ridley. Ridley made a leaping grab for a 15-yarder on third and 6 from the Tennessee 40. \nThen Coker turned it over to Henry, who continued a hot streak with 28 carries for 143 yards. \nDobbs and Tennessee managed a first down before the sacks. Anderson jarred the ball loose and A'Shawn Robinson recovered it one-handed on the second one and rambled a few yards toward the end zone before getting toppled while former Vols quarterback Peyton Manning watched stunned from the sideline. \nThe Vols wound up with their fourth loss by a touchdown or less, three of them to a Top 25 team. \n\"It doesn't feel good, but there are a lot of learning opportunities,\" Dobbs said. \"We can't let this loss beat us twice. We have to be ready to go, because Kentucky doesn't really care about what happened this weekend.\" \nDobbs was 13 of 22 for 171 yards and a touchdown. Hurd gained 92 yards on 18 carries. \nCoker finished 21 of 27 for 247 yards with an interception. Stewart had six catches for 114 yards. \nBoth quarterbacks were sacked five times. \n\"I thought our team showed some grit, some determination and some resiliency on the road against a quality opponent, a top 10 opponent, in a hostile environment to go down and drive the ball and put us in a position to win,\" Jones said. \"At the University of Tennessee, there are no moral victories.\" \nAlabama has won the last nine meetings, and the Vols have dropped 24 straight against Top 10 teams. \nThis one was anything but a mismatch in the long-running rivalry. \nTennessee kicker Aaron Medley missed a 43-yard attempt and two 51-yarders, one on the final play of the first half and the other early in the fourth quarter. Jones is standing by his kicker. \n\"Those were very difficult kicks but there isn't any other kicker that I want instead of Aaron,\" the coach said. \nTennessee started two freshmen on the offensive line, right guard Jack Jones and right tackle Chance Hall. \nAlabama wore No. 28 stickers on their helmets honoring former teammate Altee Tenpenny, who died in a car accident on Tuesday. \nAP college football website: http://www.collegefootball.ap.org \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T03:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T04:06:45.655+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
