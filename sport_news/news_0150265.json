Instead of in the classroom, one student was in adult court charged with attempted murder Thursday. \nWearing jail clothes and handcuffs, Mason Buhl is taken back to the juvenile detention center after the judge denied bond. \nThe 16-year-old is charged in adult court, facing first degree murder and commission of a felony while armed with a firearm. \n\"These are both two class two felonies. The language of the statute essentially would require that I file it against him in adult court,\" Lincoln County State's Attorney Tom Wollman said. \nInvestigators say Buhl got in trouble at school on Friday. During a meeting with the principal about the incident, Buhl took out a gun and shot Kevin Lein. \n\"This wasn't what I would deem as a successful event. This was an event that was stopped and it was stopped by some heroic actions,\" Wollman said. \nBecause of his young age, the judge gave Buhl court-appointed attorney Michael Butler. \nIn court, Wollman expressed plans to bring evidence to a grand jury for an indictment later this month. \n\"We are obviously digging into the history of our suspect,\" Lincoln County Sheriff Dennis Johnson said. \nIf convicted of attempted murder, Buhl could be sentenced to 50 years in prison. The teen's family was not there during his first court appearance. \nA school official said Buhl was new to the district this fall, where he is a junior. Â© 2015 KELOLAND TV.
