(AP Photo/Duane Burleson) — Duane Burleson \nDETROIT – Bears coach John Fox said 34 points should have been enough for a win, and the Bears could have scored 50. \nInstead, missed opportunities in the red zone haunted the Bears on Sunday in their 34-31 overtime loss to the previously 0-5 Lions, sending the Bears to a 2-4 record heading into a bye. \n“We’ve got to do better in the red zone, we’ve got to do better down there,” said quarterbck Jay Cutler, who threw for 353 yards, but had an interception in the end zone. “We’ve got to be more efficient, got to get touchdowns instead of three. I’ve got to play better down there.” \nOn their first drive, the Bears had a first-and-goal at the 10. Running back Matt Forte was stopped for a loss of a yard and Cutler couldn’t connect with Martellus Bennett on third-and-goal. \n“The game was basically given to us and we had a lot of opportunities to win that game,” said Forte, who averaged only 2.9 yards a carry against a Lions defense that had struggled against the run. \nCutler missed receiver Eddie Royal on a slant on second-and-goal from the 5-yard line in the second quarter. He threw the pick targeting Alshon Jeffery in the third quarter. A holding penalty backed the Bears up after a recovered fumble, leading to a field goal. And the Bears didn’t have enough time to cash in at the end of regulation when a pass interference got them to the 11-yard line. \nOverall, they were 3 for 8 in the red zone and 3 for 6 in goal-to-go opportunities. \nMegatron shows up: Calvin Johnson’s yards-per-catch average heading in to Sunday (10.1) was the lowest of his career by far. Against the Bears, he had six catches for 166 yards, averaging 27.7 yards a grab, including the go-ahead score near the end of regulation. \nThe most important catch came in overtime, a 57-yarder he leapt to grab over safety Harold Jones-Quartey, the undrafted rookie out of Findlay College starting his second NFL game. Matt Prater hit the game-winning field goal two plays later. \n“That’s very frustrating,” Jones-Quartey said. “To be honest, i know I wasn’t drafted or whatever, but I don’t care who is on the field. When the game is on the line, I’m playing not only for myself but for my teammates and my family. I didn’t make that play, so it’s back to the drawing board, back to practice to get better.” \nRoller coaster debut: Talk about emotions for inside linebacker Jonathan Anderson, who was called up from the practice squad Tuesday and made his NFL debut in Ford Field as the Bears’ nickel inside linebacker. LaRoy Reynolds took Shea McClellin’s spot in the base. \nHe had the interception that was overturned in the end zone, after Kyle Fuller stripped Golden Tate. He had a sack that was nullified because of an offside penalty. \n“I was just playing down by down. I wasn’t really paying attention to all of that,” Anderson said. \nThe undrafted rookie finished with three tackles and got an interception that did not get overturned, leading to a Bears touchdown. Anderson said he was thinking end zone when he picked it off, but was tackled immediately. \n“Those were great,” he said, “but at the end of the day, none of that matters because we didn’t get the win.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T03:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T08:23:15.813+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
