Related Funding announced for broadband... \nThe Cats will begin their second-half comeback bid with the ball. \nUK Football's got a big game Thursday night. Big. Huge. Massive. No, this isn't the Auburn team that was predicted to win the SEC Championship. In fact The Tigers are still looking for their first SEC win of the fall. But this is big anyway. \nThis is a rare moment in the national solo Thursday night spotlight for Kentucky. Even rarer that The Wildcats have traction in year three under Head Coach Mark Stoops. Records of (4-1/2-1) alone in second place in the SEC East. Not bad for a team that's never won a division title, much less been to the postseason at all the last 5 years. \nIt gets better. \nThe Wildcats have lost 16 of their last 17 to The Tigers. Haven't beaten them in Lexington since 1966. A win now even over an average Auburn team continues the positive Cats vibe and makes Quarterback Patrick Towles look like a sage more and more. Remember his pre-season comments? Why can't they compete for the SEC East Title? Many jaws were dropped. Many more laughed. Not so many are laughing anymore. And the UK bandwagon will get significantly heavier if it can get its second quality win of the season now, adding to the credibility earned by beating Missouri. \nThis could be the start of something big. \nThe Wildcats and Tigers kickoff Thursday at 7 p.m. at Commonwealth Stadium in Lexington. Tags UK Kentucky Wildcats Football \nABOUT THIS. KENTUCKY HOSTS AUBURN TONIGHT. AND UK HAS NOT HAD A LOT OF SUCCESS AGAINST THE TIGERS. BUT COACH STOOPS SAYS HIS TEAM IS READY AND HOPES FOR A WIN.

WITH A PRICELESS OPPORTUNITY FOR THE CATS AND HEAD COACH MARK STOOPS TO PROVE TO THE USA THEY ARE REALLY READY TO COMPETE FOR ITS FIRST EVER SEC EAST TITLE. KENTUCKY'S RECORDS ARE 4-1 AND 2-1, ALONE IN SECOND PLACE. A WIN KEEPS THEM IN THE HUNT FOR THE AND A ONCE UNTHINKABLE LONGSHOT APPEARANCE IN THE LEAGUE CHAMPIONSHIP GAME. THE KEYS INCLUDE QUARTERBACK PATRIC GAME. AS WELL AS RUNNING BACK BOOM WILLIAMS MISSING THE EKU WIN FOR PERSONAL REASONS. BOOM COULD BE THE DIFFERENCE MAKER AS AUBURN RANKS JUST 88TH IN THE COUNTRY AGAINST THE RUN. I THINK IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT AUBU THEIR OFFENSE IS VERY HARD TO DEFEND. SO IT'S BY NO MEANS VERY PREP . YOU'VE HEARD ME SAY IT TIME AND TIME AGAIN, ANYBODY THAT USES THE QUARTERBACK IN THE RUN GAME PUS THEN ADDING NUMBERS AND TAKING SHOTS DOWN THE FIELD AND SO ON.
