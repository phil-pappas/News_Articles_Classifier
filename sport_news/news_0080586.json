The break is welcome, coach Gary Patterson said after a 45-21 win over Iowa State.\n\"Three road games and Texas, we're beat up pretty good,\" Patterson said. \"We're going to need these 12 days to get ourselves back and get ourselves ready to go. It's good to be going into a break and being undefeated.\"\nIf you remember, Patterson identified the four games that began with a 55-52 escape at Texas Tech and ended with Iowa State as the key season stretch for his team. None of the teams was ranked, then or now. Only Tech (5-2, 2-2) has a winning record. Yet to Patterson, this was his team's proving ground.\nIn hindsight, it makes far more sense than it did then. It got battered TCU to a break where the players and coaching staff can regroup for the all-important November stretch. The road games at No. 14 Oklahoma State and No. 17 Oklahoma, let alone the circle-the-day Black Friday showdown with No. 2 Baylor, wouldn't have nearly the impact with an early loss or two.\nThe whole game plan for TCU up to this point has been to make those games meaningful.\nConsider it Mission Accomplished.\nFor all the talk of impressive one-loss teams such as Alabama, Stanford and Notre Dame, an unbeaten Power Five team is hard to ignore, even one that has struggled at times.\nHere's what we know about TCU now.\nBoykin and Doctson give the Frogs a shot in every game\nBoykin has lived up to billing as a Heisman candidate. For now, LSU running back Leonard Fournette and Boykin are 1 and 1A on the Heisman list. If anything, he's even better running the spread than he was a year ago.\nThree times he's accounted for at least 500 yards total offense and four touchdowns this season. He's also efficient. Against Iowa State, he completed 84.4 percent of his passes for 436 yards.\nDoctson did his part against Iowa State (10 receptions, 190 yards, two touchdowns) to continue the epic Biletnikoff debate about who is the best receiver in the country, the TCU senior or Baylor junior Corey Coleman.\nThe defense is improving\nThe Horned Frogs may never be on par with predecessors crafted by Patterson. It just might not be as much of a liability going forward. TCU shut out Iowa State in the second half a week after allowing Kansas State 119 yards and 10 points in the second half.\nWith the offense producing 50.1 points a game, the defense just has to be good enough.\nThe showdown with Baylor is still in Fort Worth, not Waco\nBaylor had an edge last season in its comeback win at McLane Stadium, where it's never lost. The Horned Frogs have won 10 straight at Amon Carter Stadium.\nThree takeaways from this past weekend in the Big 12: -- With its victory over West Virginia, Baylor has now won 26 of its last 27 games played within the state of Texas.\n-- Kansas State, which plays at Texas on Saturday, had scored in 234 straight games before being shut out by Oklahoma, 55-0. The Wildcats' 110 total yards were their fewest in 19 years.\n-- After spending the postseason at home last season, Texas Tech is now one win away from bowl eligibility at 5-2.\nTwitter: @ChuckCarltonDMN\nOn Twitter:\n @ChuckCarltonDMN", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/ChuckCarltonDMN", "https://twitter.com/ChuckCarltonDMN"], "published": "2015-10-19T03:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T20:02:00.668+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
