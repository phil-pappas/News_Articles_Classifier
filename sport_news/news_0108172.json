For our staff, it recharged the batteries a little bit. For our kids, it recharged them a little bit. I hope we have our feet under us.\" \nThe Bears are 6-0 for the second consecutive season. They have been led by junior quarterback Jordan Washington, who has accounted for 18 touchdowns, including 10 passing. \nSylvan Hills hosts Little Rock McClellan (5-2, 3-1) Friday night. The Crimson Lions are coming off a 70-0 victory over Little Rock Fair. \n\"It's as big of a game as there is around the area,\" Withrow said. \"It's big for both programs for seeding purposes. You want to be the No. 1 or the No. 2 seed and have a home playoff game.\" \nThe Bears will try to stop McClellan junior running back Pierre Strong, who has 1,198 yards and 13 touchdowns on 89 carries in 7 games. \n\"They are a team that's really rose faster than anybody,\" Withrow said. \"They've gotten better and better each week. It's not a surprise to me. You're not going to overlook this one. \n\"This team is going to beat some teams in the playoffs.\" \nBATESVILLE \nComing together \nBatesville Coach Dave King knew the Pioneers were going to have some growing pains early. \nThe Pioneers (5-2, 4-0 5A-East) started 1-2 in nonconference play, beating Watson Chapel before losing to Searcy and Jonesboro. But they have rebounded to win four consecutive games and are in first place in the 5A-East after beating Wynne 34-14 last Friday night. \nJunior quarterback Zach Griffin, one of seven new starters on offense, has passed for 1,072 yards with 8 touchdowns and 2 interceptions. \n\"He's throwing the ball well,\" King said. \"He's ahead of where I thought he would be.\" \n\"We've got a lot of kids who are playing who are young. It took some time for them to mature in their roles. Each week we're getting better.\" \nUnder King, Batesville has been one of the most consistent programs in Class 5A since 2010, winning at least 10 games each of the past five seasons. The Pioneers won the 5A-East last season, and King credits the program's winning tradition with the success of his seniors and leadership. \n\"That's how we run the program,\" King said. \"They're going to lead and you're going to follow. It's a good formula so far.\" \nBatesville travels to Blytheville (5-2, 3-1) on Friday. \nHS LAKESIDE \nDefense rising up \nHot Springs Lakeside's defense has turned things around since it started 5A-South Conference play. \nThe Rams (6-1, 4-0) allowed an average of 46.3 points per game in their first three games, including 62 points in a 62-54 loss at Sylvan Hills on Sept. 11. \nBut over their past four games Lakeside has held teams to 20.7 points per game and allowed fewer than 14 points in two of the four games, giving up 13 points at Magnolia on Oct. 2 and 14 points at White Hall on Oct. 9. \nSenior linebacker Kennedy King leads the team in tackles with 50. Free safety Caden Vaughn, another senior, had the game-clinching interception to preserve Lakeside's 28-26 victory over Hope last Friday at Austin Field in Hot Springs. \n\"They have confidence,\" Coach Jared McBride said. \"They are making the plays. Our coaches are putting them in good situations.\" \nThe Rams have missed the playoffs the past two seasons but can clinch a playoff berth with a victory Friday at De Queen (2-5, 1-3). . \n\"It's been a good mix of hard work and fortunate bounces go our way,\" McBride said. \"They're playing hard. They're playing well.\" \nEXTRA POINTS \nPossible inclement weather Friday night has forced two schools to move their home games to today. Little Rock Parkview has moved its 6A-South Conference game against Texarkana and Genoa Central will host Fouke in a 6-3A Conference game. Parkview's game was scheduled to be played at Quigley-Cox Stadium on Little Rock Central's campus, but now will be played at War Eagle Stadium on Little Rock Fair's campus. The Texarkana-Parkview game will be played at 7 p.m. Genoa Central Coach Phillip Binkley said Wednesday both schools made the decision Wednesday to move their game up. \"It's not just the rain, but thunderstorms as well,\" Binkley said. \"We're both 1-3 [in the 6-3A] going into this game. It's a must game.\" ... Beebe senior running back Trip Smith is 244 yards shy of breaking the school's career rushing record of 4,640 yards set by Nic Bradley in the 1990s. Smith has rushed for 1,000 yards and 10 touchdowns on 201 carries this season and has 4,396 yards in his career. The Badgers (3-3, 2-2 5A-Central) are at Little Rock Fair (0-6, 0-3) on Friday. ... Little Rock Christian senior running back Damarea Crockett rushed for 295 yards and 2 touchdowns on 51 carries in the Warriors' 43-42 victory at Greenbrier last Friday. Crockett, who is orally committed to Boise State, has rushed for 935 yards and 14 touchdowns on 140 carries this season for the Warriors (7-0, 4-0 5A-West). \nSports on 10/22/2015", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T10:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T13:35:50.262+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
