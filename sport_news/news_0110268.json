I nstead they made a complete mess of it and the ball flew across the box to Zarate, who had arrived just in time to drill it first time inside Asmir Begovic's near post. \nChelsea were millimetres from equalising 10 minutes before the interval when Kurt Zouma's downward header was hacked clear by Manuel Lanzini on the goal-line. \nAnd their meltdown began in the 44th minute when Matic, already on a yellow card after fouling Zarate, cynically brought down Diafra Sakho to earn his marching orders. \nThe Blues players surrounded referee Jonathan Moss in protest - which could also yield another FA charge - with the official eventually booking Fabregas and skipper John Terry. \nMourinho stood impassively on the touchline but, behind him, the incensed Louro's histrionics saw him removed from the dugout. \nOnly when the Portuguese failed to retake his position pitchside, instead appearing in the stand amidst a flurry of camera phones - which no doubt would not have improved his mood - did word filter out that he too had been sent off. \nYet Chelsea managed to haul themselves level in the 56th minute after Zouma and Cahill challenged for Willian's corner, the ball falling kindly for the latter to thrash home. \nHowever, Carroll had the final say, emerging from the bench to powerfully head in Aaron Cresswell's cross with 10 minutes left to inflict another damaging defeat on Mourinho and the Blues. \nTWEET OF THE MATCH \n\"Andy Carroll....remember him?
