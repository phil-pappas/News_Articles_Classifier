The only question(s) now are how, and when, he'll leave. Many signs point to it being after this weekend when his team gets crushed loses a confusingly close game to No. 1 by default Ohio State .\nHowever it does go down, it must be nerve wracking. Or at least it would be to many of us. Edsall, however, doesn't appear to be stressing, using words of wisdom from Wiz Khalifa to address the elephant in the room:\n\"Worrying is stupid. It's like walking around with an umbrella waiting for it to rain.\"- Wiz Khalifa\nâ€” Randy Edsall (@RandyEdsall) October 9, 2015 In case you're wondering what his contract situation is, Edsall signed an extension last year that was set to give him a raise, up to $2.5 million annually, from 2017-2019. However, if he got fired before then he'd only receive one payment of $500,000. He'll still get paid for the rest of this year and next, but still, that tweet seems like a pretty chill reaction for a guy who's reportedly about to lose $7 million.\n[via Twitter ]\nSend all complaints, compliments, and tips to sportstips@complex.com", "external_links": ["http://www.baltimoresun.com/sports/terps/tracking-the-terps/bal-maryland-football-coach-randy-edsall-signs-contract-extension-through-2019-20150630-story.html", "https://twitter.com/RandyEdsall/status/652278484866342912", "http://espn.go.com/college-football/story/_/id/13840369/randy-edsall-coach-maryland-terrapins-next-season"], "published": "2015-10-09T05:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T16:21:30.741+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
