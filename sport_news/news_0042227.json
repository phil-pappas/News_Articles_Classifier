Dillashaw"], "text": "For casual MMA fans, this week’s announcement that T.J. Dillashaw was leaving Team Alpha Male might not have registered as much of a game changer. \nFor hardcores, though, Dillashaw’s move sent a tremor through the UFC’s lighter weight classes. \nThe bantamweight champion has been with the Sacramento, Calif., fight camp ever since he finished his NCAA wrestling career at Cal State-Fullerton and began training in mixed martial arts. \nDillashaw would essentially become the poster-boy for Team Alpha Male when he won the 135-pound title last year by beating Renan Barao, and his decision to train in Denver has led to a rush of speculation regarding the inner-workings at the California gym. \nMuch of the talk has centred on the departure of former Alpha Male head coach Duane Ludwig, who has been in a war of words of sorts with Urijah Faber, who founded the team. Dillashaw has continued to train with Ludwig in the time since the coach left Alpha Male last year, despite the very public feud that’s broken out between Faber and Ludwig. \nThere’s been no mention of the bad blood in anything released by either Dillashaw or Alpha Male, but that hasn’t stopped the speculation. \n“The last six years at Team Alpha Male have been irreplaceable and my brothers there will forever be family to me,” Dillashaw told MMAFighting.com. “I thank each and every one of them for helping me along the way and being a part of this journey we’ve shared. \n“This is not the end of (me) being a part of the Team Alpha Male family, but a new chapter in my career.” \nA report by Brazilian MMA website Combate said Dillashaw won’t actually be training full time with Ludwig, but will instead be splitting time between the Elevation Fight Team and Ludwig’s camp in nearby Broomfield, Colo. \nThe major question the move opens up is whether Dillashaw and Faber might step into the octagon. Widely seen as two of the top four fighters in the UFC’s bantamweight division — which is short on contenders — they’ve been plagued by questions about whether they’d face off ever since Dillashaw won the belt. \nEven as teammates, they refused to rule out the possibility, but it now seems ever more likely. \nDOLCE DETAILS \nIn the wake of Johny Hendricks being forced to withdraw from his fight with Tyron Woodley at UFC 192 due to complications with his weight cut, the welterweight’s former dietician has offered up his opinion on the matter. \nTurns out he’s not particularly sympathetic to Hendricks. \n“It was certainly a comedy of errors and most of it falls on Johny’s shoulders for coming into camp much too heavy as he once did,” Mike Dolce told the MMAHour podcast. “That was kind of his M.O., feeling that he could get the weight off, but in your early 30’s, you just can’t do that. \n“With his body-fat percentage, you’re not able to get that weight off in a healthy manner. You really start to dehydrate the organs in the process, and I think that’s where his body started to shut down.” \nHendricks was rushed to hospital early Friday morning due to kidney stones and an intestinal blockage. \nRESPECT FROM VAN ZANT \nPaige VanZant has taken things slow for most of her career. \nAt 21 years old, she’s got plenty of time and, understandably, isn’t in much of a rush to call out more experienced opponents. \nRanked No. 6 in the women’s strawweight division and set to headline the Dec. 10 UFC Fight Night card in Las Vegas against Joanne Calderwood, VanZant clearly knows that she’s not that far off from having to take on the best in the world at 115-pounds. \nAnd she knows exactly who she thinks ‘the best in the world’ is right now. It’s Joanna Jedrzejczyk. And VanZant expects the champion to be waiting for her whenever she earns a title shot. \n“(Jedrzejczyk) is a great fighter, I think she’s really good,” VanZant said. “Of course, we’re seeing a lot of other strawweights with a lot of talent. She’s going to have top competition, but I do think that she will be the person who stands with the title until I get there.” \nIt might not quite be Conor McGregor-level trash talk, but it’s the boldest VanZant hass been when talking about her division. For those of us hoping to see VanZant fighting the best of the best sooner rather than later, that’s progress. \ndaniel.austin@sunmedia.ca", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T02:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T06:53:37.834+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
