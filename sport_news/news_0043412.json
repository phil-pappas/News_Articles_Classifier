Competition is good. For us, we've got some depth and there are going to be different lineups you'll see.\"\n  Burke and Burks were opening-night starters a year ago, but the ascension of point guard Danté Exum pushed one to the bench while a shoulder injury cut the other's season short, giving shooting guard Rodney Hood a chance to shine.\nNow with Exum hurt and Burks back healthy, Snyder opted to open the preseason with his most experienced backcourt.\nThe coach said he wanted the point guard Burke to focus more than anything else on his defense, picking up players early and being a disruptive force. For his part, Burke has said he hasn't taken the chance to start for granted.\n\"I'm not going to go into it thinking I'm the starting point guard,\" Burke said. \"I know it's a battle, a competition.\"\nAs for Burks and Hood, Snyder has said he anticipates times the two shooting guards will be on the floor together.\n\"I think they have trust in me that we're going to use them appropriately,\" Snyder said. It probably won't be a thing where one of them quote-unquote beats out the other one. It may be a question of lineups and match ups. The good thing about those guys is they're both going to work hard and give you everything they have whether they're coming off the bench or they're starting.\"\n\nIsland haze\nIt was hazing Hawaiian style for the Jazz's rookies on Saturday night.\nAt a team luau, sixth-year forward Gordon Hayward made rookies Trey Lyles, Tibor Pleiss, Raul Neto J.J. O'Brien and Treveon Graham sing happy birthday to forward Joe Ingles and assistant general manager Justin Zanik.\nThe new guys also did their best hula dancing at the party.\nThe reviews from Hayward? Not good.\nStill, Snyder said he believed the event-and this entire trip to Hawaii-would help his team in the long run.\nIt was pretty causal, a good way to kind of feel like you've been in Hawaii. … Business comes first for us right now, but it was a good opportunity to take an evening and put on a Hawaiian shirt and eat some food and hang out on the beach,\" Snyder said. \"Any time you do something like this-I wouldn't go so far as to say it's a cultural experience-but it's a trip and there are other things other than the game that can help your team.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T07:20:16.132+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
