The Bears will likely be able to name the score after putting up at least 56 points in every game this season, and now facing a Jayhawks defense that has allowed at least 27 points in each of its losses. \nKEY MATCHUP \nBaylor quarterback Seth Russell against the Kansas defense. Russell leads the Football Bowl Subdivision in passing efficiency, touchdown passes (19), yards per completion and numerous other statistical categories. In other words, a Kansas secondary with little depth and few playmakers will be put to the test by one of the nation's most prolific passers. \nPLAYERS TO WATCH \nBaylor: RB Shock Linwood leads the Big 12 in rushing at 146 yards per game. He needs just 95 yards to pass Jerod Douglas (2,811) for second place on the career rushing list, with Walter Abercrombie (3,665) within reach. \nKansas: QB Ryan Willis gets his first start after injuries to Michael Cummings, Montell Cozart and Deondre Ford. The freshman from suburban Kansas City has only played a handful of college snaps, most of them last week against Iowa State. \nFACTS & FIGURES \nBaylor is 30-4 in its last 34 games, all of the defeats coming away from home. ...
