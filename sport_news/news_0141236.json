The 19-14 win Friday night against Passaic County rival Pompton Lakes was the strongest sign that the Bears have put the Glen Rock game behind them and are ready to compete in a loaded North 1, Group 2 section once the playoffs start next month. \n\"Friday night was huge,\" Passero said. \n\"The kids were as pumped up as they’ve been all year. They’ve known since our Glen Rock loss that every game was basically going to be a playoff game because of how tough it is [to gain power points] in North 1, Group 2. \n\"They just knew they had to come out and play hard. \n\"I always stress how important it is to play 48 minutes, and that’s what it took Friday night.\" \nSenior quarterback/cornerback Ryan VanderWerf was an impact player on both sides of the ball for Hawthorne (4-1), ranked No. 20 in The Record public Top 20. \nVanderWerf rushed for 216 yards and two touchdowns on 18 carries, and threw a touchdown pass. \nHe recorded six tackles, caused a fumble, recovered a fumble, and broke up a pass. \nSenior middle linebacker Mike Deitrich added nine tackles and a sack for Hawthorne, which improved to 24-5 at home since 2010. \n\"It was the complete opposite of the Glen Rock second half,\" Passero said. \n\"Glen Rock came out right away and scored, and we didn’t answer the bell. \n\"Then Friday night, with Pompton scoring the first points of the game [in the third quarter], I thought it was really important we came right back and scored. It gave our kids confidence throughout the game.\" \nHawthorne has a bye this weekend because its scheduled game against Ridgefield was canceled when the Royals’ varsity program was disbanded in August. \nThe Bears will play Elmwood Park (0-5) on Oct. 23 at home. \n\"We’ll just continue to work hard,\" Passero said, \"and good things will happen, hopefully.\" \nEmail: idec@northjersey.com © 2015 North Jersey Media Group Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T08:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T15:54:48.210+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
