He didn't play.\nWhen it came to Luck's availability for the Pats game, Pagano used the same phrase.\nPagano jokingly says he's \"supremely confident\" Luck will play vs Patriots. \"He's getting better every single day -- he's really close.\"\nâ€” Mike Berman (@MikeBermanIndy) October 9, 2015 Still, part of this bravado may have to do with the way the season has played out for the Colts. After stumbling to an 0-2 start, Pagano gave a tearful, impassioned postgame speech after a close win over the Titans. The Colts followed with wins over the Jaguars and Texans to grab hold of first place in the AFC South.\nBut the Patriots are a whole different animal, especially considering the Deflategate aspect that has fanned the flames of this rivalry. Not that the Pats need any more bulletin board material for this game, but it's clear Pagano doesn't mind if he provides it, joking or not.\nEither way, the Pats hope Pagano's supreme confidence has the same amount of spotty results going forward.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/MikeBermanIndy/status/652332050918207488", "http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2015/10/09/pagano-is-supremely-confident-about-playing-new-england/"], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T17:58:54.646+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
