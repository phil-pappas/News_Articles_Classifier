The Mets have allowed five runs total in the first three games of the NLCS, and the Cubs have compiled a .492 on-base plus slugging percentage. While we chew on that, let's take a bite-sized look at Game 4. Is a great comeback in store? Or will the Mets continue their frolic to the Series? \nNLCS Game 5: Mets lead Cubs 3-0 First pitch: 8:07 p.m. ET, TV: TBS Pitching matchup: New York's Steven Matz (4-0, 2.27) vs. Chicago's Jason Hammel (10-7, 3.74) \nHere's what they've done in the postseason: \nThe first order of business for Hammel is to keep Daniel Murphy's bat away from the ball. Murphy has hit a home run in five straight games, tying a postseason record set by Carlos Beltran in 2004 with the Astros. The Mets aren't exactly knocking the cover off the ball aside from Murphy, who has three of their four home runs, along with five of their 24 hits. Take him away, they're batting .232. \nYour browser does not support iframes. \nIn Matz, he's just what the Cubs really didn't need right now: A lefty. They were much weaker against left-handed pitching in 2015, although Anthony Rizzo managed to post an .881 OPS vs. lefties. Still, it would be a good time for Kris Bryant , Starlin Castro and Javier Baez to start hitting. They are a combined 5 for 30 with two doubles in the series. \nThe Cubs could have gone with left-hander Jon Lester on short rest instead of Hammel, but Lester has never worked on short rest as a starter in the playoffs and, as Cubs manager Joe Maddon put it, the Cubs have much more work ahead of them than Game 4 -- if they want to win the series. Getting to Game 5 with Lester, and possibly 6 with Jake Arrieta , is the motivation for now: \"Because you've got to win four games,\" Maddon said. \"It's not just about tomorrow's game. We have to win four games, obviously, now. So it's not just about tomorrow. If we could, like I said, tomorrow, win that game, get it back to Jon and Jake, that's pretty attractive at that point. \n\"So the other flip side of that is a lot of times pitchers don't do that well on three days' rest, so why even take that risk right now when you know you've got to win more than just one game? If it was one and done, you may do something like that, but it's got to be four and done.\" \nHammel (left) is all who stands between Matz and the Mets from the World Series.
