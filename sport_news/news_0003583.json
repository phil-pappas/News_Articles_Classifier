Rockford trailed in the three-round shootout before emerging victorious. Comebacks were part of the story in the IceHogs’ 4-3 shootout success Friday night before a turnout of 3,052 at BMO Harris Bank Center. “It was pretty crazy,” said IceHogs winger Ryan Hartman. “An overtime – it gets the adrenaline going up a bit, especially when it goes to a shootout. “It was a good team effort.” Rockford couldn’t hold 2-0 and 3-1 edges, with Chicago coming back in the final 6:01. Chicago’s Danny Kristo beat Michael Leighton to end round one of the shootout, only to have Jeremy Morin and Garret Ross then slip the puck past netminder Jordan Binnington in the second and third rounds while Leighton stopped the Wolves’ final two shooters. “It was a tough game for some of the guys because there was a lot of special teams. It was hard to get a lot of flow through the second period there,” Rockford head coach Ted Dent said. “We saw some improvements. Our penalty kill is making strides -- it is getting better. We had to kill nine penalties, which is way too many. “But I thought our defensemen did a real good job with it tonight.” Instead of continuing to rely on the production of his top line, Dent opted to split it up -- to spread the scoring around. It worked, as three different combinations connected as Rockford closed out a four-game homestand 2-2 to even its season mark at 3-3. Chicago dropped to 2-1-1. Morin was paired with Mark McNeill and Brandon Mashinter, while Hartman took Morin’s spot with Marko Dano and Tanner Kero. The Dano-Kero-Morin trio had accounted for seven of the team’s 11 goals coming in, or 64 percent. Pierre-Cedric Labrie and Hartman put Rockford up 2-0 in the first before Kristo tallied unassisted at 14:04 of the second on Chicago’s 22nd shot on net. McNeill made it 3-1 on a feed from Mashinter at 5:06 of the third. That comfort level was gone after Chicago’s Jeremy Welsh cut it to 3-2 at 13:59 and Pat Cannone tied it at 15:02. Chicago outshot Rockford 36-19 in regulation, but Rockford had all five shots on goal in the five-minute, 3-on-3 overtime. The Wolves went 1-for-9 on the power play compared to 0-for-4 for the IceHogs. “That’s kind of how the game went – both teams had bad penalties,” Hartman said. “Both teams were fired up to play. It was the first game against each other. It was good.” Page 2 of 2 - Notes: Friday’s clash was the first of 12 on the season. … Neither team scored more than four goals in last season’s Illinois Lottery Cup rivalry, which Rockford won by going 8-3-1-0. … The game was Chicago’s first on the road. … Michael Leighton went 5-1-0-0 against Chicago last season with 1.96 goals against average and .946 save percentage.
