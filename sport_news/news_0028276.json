(Source: AP Photo/LM Otero) \n(RNN) - The Cubs will win the World Series because they have history on their side. \nWait. What? \n'Tis true, friends. The power of the past (that, and a whole, honkin' load of Hollywood mojo) will propel the Cubbies to the pinnacle of the sport. \nIn the (semi) famous and (not hardly) award-winning film Rookie of the Year , a cute kid with an improbable path to the major leagues beats the Mets to put Chicago in the World Series. \nThe real-life version of the team has this year's likely Rookie of the Year winner, Kris Bryant, whose own path to the big leagues was just as fabled. For good measure, the club fields two more rookies - Kyle Schwarber and Jorge Soler - who have become megastars since the calendar turned October. \nAnyone who isn't living under a rock already knows about the parallels between Back to the Future II and the Cubs' success in 2015. OK, the team Chicago was predicted to beat, Miami, isn’t in the American League; and it didn't even make the playoffs this season. But this is undeniable cinematic proof of the Cubs' victory. \nBelieve that. And don't click this link . \nYou were expressly told not to click the link! What is wrong with you? \nOn the American League side, people have devoted much time and energy into Jose Bautista's bat flip and the \"sportsmanship\" thereafter. There was even a scientific study . \nThat's good and all, but one particular issue is left unresolved. Was the body motion Bautista displayed after the flip more of a whip, or was it more nae nae? He's usually an understated man, so it was easy to miss. Surely, there will be more exploration into this in the coming weeks. \nNow that the fun is over, let's break down these teams piece by piece to see who will advance. National League Championship Series \nLineup \nIt's a common story - a young team ahead of the curb during the regular season shows its inexperience in the playoffs. And so it was with the Cubs… wait, no, that hasn't happened at all. The team with the second-most walks in the majors during the regular season also had the second-most walks among the eight teams in the divisional round. \nAnd boy, can they hit. Facing any combination of Anthony Rizzo, Bryant, Soler and Schwarber has to be the least fun thing since living in an orphanage with Ms. Hannigan (the movie references are endless here). \nThe Mets' offense at this point is Curtis Granderson, Daniel Murphy with a little Yoenis Cespedes mixed in. It's the playoffs, so contributions from a limited number of hitters is not always a bad thing. But the gap in depth gives New York less protection in a tight game or during a bad outing by a starter. \nAdvantage: Cubs \nPitching \nWhen the biggest question on your staff is a rookie who jumped past a 14-game winner to make the rotation and went toe-to-toe with Clayton Kershaw in his first postseason start, life looks brilliant. \nThat would be Steven Matz, the least well-known (not for long) of the quadruple threat manager Terry Collins will trot to the hill each night. Jacob deGrom won the first two postseason starts of his career in the NLDS, Matt Harvey is still Matt Harvey and Noah Syndergaard's nickname is Thor, for goodness sake. He lived up to that in a relief appearance during Game 5 against the Dodgers. \nThat's a comforting thought in case New York's bullpen returns to regular-season meltdown mode. They've been solid so far, but again, the postseason provides a limited window. \nThe Cubs' overall starting pitching doesn't have the same \"Wow!\" factor, but it's more accomplished. Jon Lester has a World Series ring, and Jake Arrieta followed a stellar 2014 with an inhuman run this season (Cy Young, anyone?). Jason Hammel and Kyle Hendricks were outstanding pitchers this season, but no one knows that because of Arrieta's large shadow. \nOne thing to watch is if the pitchers can get ahead in the count. The Mets may struggle putting batters away, and as already established, the Cubs' hitters are very good at backing opposing pitchers into corners. \nAdvantage: Cubs \nDefense \nAside from pitching, defense is one of the few stats that translates from the regular season to the postseason. Hitters can go hot or cold, but if a defense blows leads or kicks the ball around, those are difficult blemishes to mask. \nThe Mets were unquestionably better in terms of making fewer errors. However, each team was basically neck-and-neck in defensive efficiency rating, a measure of how often a team records outs regardless of how runners get on base. \nTranslation: the Cubs were better at getting out of trouble, but the Mets didn't get themselves into trouble in the first place. Go with the team that prefers to stay squeaky clean. Javier Baez's lazy throw to first in Game 3 of the NLDS is an example of the mental lapses young teams make. \nAdvantage: Mets \nCoaching \nJoe Maddon. We could end there, but there is also one of the best pitching coaches in the game, Chris Bosio. He has maximized the talent of nearly every arm on his roster. \nAdvantage: Cubs \nPrediction: Cubs win the series 4-2. American League Championship Series \nLineup \nBautista, Josh Donaldson, Edwin Encarnacion, Troy Tulowitzski, Russell Martin and Justin Smoak combined for 161 home runs this season. Half the teams in the major leagues hit less homers than that. \nThe offense hasn't been quite that electric in the postseason, but you wouldn't know that judging by Bautista's massive blast in the ALDS deciding game. They've done more than hit the ball over the fence. The simple threat of their power gives the Blue Jays the ability to extend at bats and innings. \nThe Royals extend innings, too, but for a different reason. They are exceptional contact hitters and get on base more than younger siblings get on your nerves. \nThis is literally what Kansas City hitters do . It's just aggravating enough to make a pitcher forget his gameplan. \nKendrys Morales and Salvador Perez have been providing the only substantial pop in the Royals' lineup this postseason, but they don't have any worries about that. Bunts and stolen bases are deadly weapons in postseason baseball, and the Royals do that better than anyone. \nAdvantage: Blue Jays \nPitching \nIf someone tells you David Price won't be your best starter in the first round, but you still advance, you take that and dance all the way home. \nToronto's staff has complemented its dominant offense by allowing the fewest baserunners and fewest homers (Price gave up two of the three total) of any team in divisional round. That's more impressive when considering the pressure after losing their first two games at home. \nKansas City's rotation is so top-heavy that both Johnny Cueto and Yordano Ventura started two games in the division series. That's not uncommon, but it's worrisome since Ventura was not that impressive. \nThe Royals have much better bullpen arms, and they'll probably have to use them a lot. Power hitters like the Blue Jays love facing relievers because even if they throw 100 mph, they probably don’t throw much of anything else. \nAdvantage: Blue Jays \nDefense \nToronto ranked first, and Kansas City ranked second in defensive efficiency this season. That's no surprise for Kansas City, who made playing defense cool again during last year's postseason. But to think a team full of mashers like Toronto can actually field the ball is scary. \nThe two men behind the plate may end up becoming the most crucial players in this series. Martin allowed 40 stolen bases, the fewest among regular starting catchers this season, and it cuts into a huge speed advantage for the Royals. But he also allowed 19 passed balls, the most among catchers, and a downside of R.A. Dickey's knuckleball. Perez allowed four passed balls, third-fewest among everyday catchers. \nAssuming the Blue Jays hit balls that stay in the park or the Royals hit it out of the infield every once in a while, you will see the two best outfield defenses in the majors on display. \nAdvantage: Draw \nCoaching \nNed Yost got to the World Series last year, and he's as good as any manager at using his team's strengths against an opponent. \nHowever, the current iteration of the Blue Jays came together late in the season and started playing like they've been on the same team for years. That says a lot about John Gibbons. \nAdvantage: Blue Jays \nPrediction: Blue Jays win series 4-3. \nDoesn’t a Cubs-Jays series sound great? All that history? All the great stories? All the royal blue? \nOK, maybe the last part isn't so important, but baseball needs Toronto and Chicago to advance. It's time baseball stopped taking the backseat to the NFL and NBA. \nIt's time millennials learned the beauty of a sport without a clock since all they do is waste time anyway. Just kidding, millennials. Love ya. \nThis is more than just a prediction in a sports column. It’s a reminder to never forget Doc Brown and Henry Rowengartner. This is what they would have wanted. \nFollow George Jones on Twitter: @GJones_RNN \nCopyright 2015 Raycom News Network. All rights reserved.
