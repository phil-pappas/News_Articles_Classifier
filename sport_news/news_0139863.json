The revelation comes days after reports emerged suggesting that Rodgers's job was on the line irrespective of the result against Everton in the Merseyside derby where his side drew 1-1. \nLiverpool chairman Tom Werner had publicly declared that the Reds were scouting Klopp for a long time but Kosicke says any contact with the former Borussia Dortmund manager was made only after a vacancy had opened up in the Anfield ranks. Klopp has already started operations at Anfield and will have the whole team at his disposal only after the international break as they prepare to travel to White Hart Lane to face Tottenham. \n\"The first call from Liverpool came after the dismissal as coach of Rodgers. Before Liverpool there were naturally quite a few enquiries. But Jurgen always asked me not to take it any further,\" Kosicke told Bild, as quoted by the Liverpool Echo . \nRodgers spent two bittersweet years at Anfield, while failing to take Liverpool into the group stages of the Champions League for two years in succession; he also got closest to ending their 25-year long wait without a league title. The Reds found themselves short by only two points against Manchester City in the 2013/14 season when Luis Suarez and Daniel Sturridge ran amok on the Premier League score sheets. \nArsenal manager Arsene Wenger was heavily critical of Liverpool's decision to sack Rodgers, stating that there was no logic behind this argument and that he deserved more time. On the other hand, Sir Alex Ferguson applauded Liverpool for bringing in Klopp and said he was \"worried\" about the positive outcome of the appointment for Liverpool, which in turn could affect United's chances in the league.
