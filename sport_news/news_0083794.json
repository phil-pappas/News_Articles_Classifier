Randolph St.).\nWhat differentiates this festival from many others is the sheer star wattage of chefs present, from Michelin-rated restaurants to fried chicken spots. Among those presenting their takes of ramen this year: Erling Wu-Bower of Nico Osteria, Giuseppe Tentori of GT Fish & Oyster, Sarah Jordan of Johnny's Grill, Chris Pandel of Swift & Sons and Christine Cikowski of Honey Butter Fried Chicken.\nA portion of the $75 ticket goes towards Common Threads, the culinary education non-profit founded by chef Art Smith.\nGet more information about the festival here .\nkpang@tribpub.com\nTwitter @pang\nPrivacy Policy GT Fish & Oyster", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/pang", "http://www.brownpapertickets.com/event/2272863", "http://www.tribpub.com/privacy-policy-and-your-privacy-rights/", "http://www.ramenfestchicago.com/", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-56265915/turbine/ct-ramenfest-tickets-2015-bill-kim-ramen-chicago"], "published": "2015-10-20T17:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T20:53:48.700+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
