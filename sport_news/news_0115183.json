Photo by Sharron Bennett No water, no problem. \nOtago Girls' High School pupil Juliette Lequeux was in dominant form at the Otago secondary schools indoor rowing championships at the weekend. \nIn addition to winning the girls under-17 100m, 500m and 2000m at the University of Otago Rowing Club, Lequeux was the fastest girl in all three events on the day. \nLequeux clocked 19.3sec in the 100m, 1min 41.2sec in the 500m and 7min 24.6 over 2000m, and was only pushed over 100m by Hayley Kettings, of Queen's High School, who finished second, just 0.03sec off the pace. \nAnnie Blakely, of Kavanagh College, impressed in the girls under-15 age-group, also winning all three races. \nBlakely stopped the clock in the 100m in 20.6sec, before clocking 1min 49.1sec in the 500m and 7min 52.6sec in the 2000m slog. \nMt Aspiring College pupil Riley Bruce recorded the fastest time of the day in the boys 2000m (6min 26.8sec) to win the under-17 race. \nHe was never threatened, with Woody Kirkwood, of John McGlashan College, the next fastest almost 10sec back. \nHowever, Bruce and Kirkwood could not be separated in a thrilling 100m race, with the pair sharing the spoils in a sharp 16.6sec. \nKirkwood then won the under-17 500m race in another thriller, just beating Aaron Roydhouse, of Otago Boys' High School, by 0.02sec in 1min 27.5sec. Bruce was third in 1min 28.8sec. \nCorey Lewis recorded wins in the boys under-18 100m (17.3sec) and 500m (1min 28.9sec), before finishing 1.8sec behind fellow Otago Boys' pupil Scott Bezett in the 2000m (6min 40sec). \nJohn McGlashan's relay team of Kirkwood, Max Gomez, Alex Timmings and Lochie Bain won the 4x500m relay for the third consecutive year in 6min 6.8sec. Kavanagh was second, 11sec off the pace, and Otago Boys' was third in 6min 23.3sec. \nColumba College's team of Clora Quinlann-Thompson, Sasha Holland, Kate Campbell and Charlotte Smith won the girls race in 7min 1.1sec, while St Hilda's Collegiate teams were second and third almost 20sec off the pace.
