They entered having given up 45 points per contest. \nShelby's first TD came with 8:13 left in regulation to tie things at 14-all. \nTates Creek (3-4) limited the Indians (4-3) to 200 yards of total offense while putting up 341 on its side. \nRobbie Lofton reeled in five catches for 92 yards, including a 55-yard TD. Peyton Burke went 15-for-26 for 191 yards and a TD. \nJohan Williams carried 17 times for 84 yards and a TD for Madison Central. Korrion Crier had 59 yards and a TD on 12 carries. \nNo. 8 Bryan Station 19, Paul Laurence Dunbar 7: The Defenders were determined to avoid a two-game slide at home and didn't allow a Dunbar score until the final period. \nQuinten Ford, in his first start in place of injured Andre Davis, went 8-for-13 for 215 yards and a TD with two interceptions for Station (6-2). Davis hurt his throwing shoulder in last week's 19-12 loss to Lafayette and was a game-time decision going into Friday. \nDevon Key was a favorite for Ford. Key caught five passes for 158 yards and a TD. The Division I prospect also rushed for 25 yards and a score. \nThe entirety of Dunbar's 245 yards of offense came on the ground. \nJefferson Harkless rushed for 154 yards for the Bulldogs (3-4). Nate Gay had 99 yards and a TD. \nScott Co. 63, Henry Clay 35: The Cardinals used a 28-point third quarter outburst to turn a fairly close game into a route on the road against the Blue Devils. After a six-yard touchdown pass from Marcus Tyler to Bray Berezowitz pulled Henry Clay to within 35-21 at halftime, Scott Co. (6-1) put the game away on the ground, scoring three rushing touchdowns in the third to go up 63-28. \nThe Cardinals had three runners top triple digits. Senior Noah Hughes carried 22 times for 145 yards and two touchdowns. Junior Kendrick Hamilton gained 101 yards and a pair of touchdowns on just eight carries and senior Keith Guy added 106 yards and a score on 13 rushes. Guy also grabbed a 47-yard touchdown pass from Josh Davis, who went 7-for-11 passing for 133 yards and two scores. \nThough Henry Clay (3-4) couldnt quite keep up with Scott Countys offense, halfback Joquise Buford found plenty of room to run in the losing effort. The senior rushed 17 times for 158 yards and a pair of touchdowns. Senior receiver Tyven McWhorter added seven catches for 104 yards and a touchdown in the Blue Devils final home game of the regular season. Theyll take on cross-town rival Paul Dunbar next week. \nNo. 12 Lafayette 43, Clark County 13: The Generals (6-2) scored 36 unanswered in their first district battle. \nThe Cardinals (0-7) opened things with a 16-yard TD reception by Ohmante Jenkins from Owen Irvin, but they wouldn't score again until the opening seconds of the fourth quarter. \nMason Alstatt, a Wofford commit, had a 33-yard TD run and an 85-yard punt return for a score to put Lafayette (6-2) up 14-7. Walker Wood carried for a 75-yard score and hit Quinten Brown and Dekwan Edwards for TD passes to cap the Generals' run. \nWood finished with 179 yards and three TDs on 10-for-14 passing. Brown had 113 yards receiving on five catches. Alstatt had 153 all-purpose yards. \nLexington Christian 56, Middlesboro 19: With sophomore running back Dillon Wheatley in top form, it's no wonder the Eagles were content to stay grounded at Middlesboro. Wheatley broke loose for 323 yards and six touchdowns on 28 carries against the Yellowjackets, averaging more then 11 yards per carry. Two of those scoring scampers began on LCA's end of the field, coming from 61 and 53 yards out. \nLCA (5-2) held Middlesboro to just 33 rushing yards on 24 carries. \nSenior quarterback Dylan Pratt did his best to keep Middlesboro (1-6) close, going 18-for-28 with two touchdowns, but also tossing two interceptions. The Jackets will try for their second win of the season at Danville next Friday. \nLexington Catholic 49, Western Hills 14: One week after being blanked 28-0 on the road at Northern Kentucky power Cooper, a return home proved to be the cure for LexCath's offensive woes. \nAfter special teams got the fireworks started with a 90-yard opening kickoff return touchdown by Andy Thompson, the Knights' offense exploded with four more first-quarter touchdowns. \nSenior running back Jaylen Jones punched in two 1-yard scores and another from 3 yards out, which gave Catholic a 35-0 lead heading into the second quarter. \n\"The tone was set right there,\" Knights Coach Mark Perry told PrepSpin after the game. \"Scoring 35 in the first quarter, you couldn't ask for a better start in district play.\" \nJones finished the night with 14 carries for 83 yards and three touchdowns, averaging 5.9 yards per carry. \n\"Jaylen ran the ball hard,\" Perry said. \"He doesn't go down on first contact very often.\" \nWestern Hills (3-3) had no better luck defending the passing game. Seniors Kirk Fagot and J.J. Ogbogu hooked up to burn the Wolverines through the air. Ogbogu reeled in three passes from Fagot, all for long touchdowns for a total of 149 yards. \nFagot went 7-for-15 passing for 209 yards and three scores. \nLexCath faces a tough road test at No. 9 Boyle County next week. The Rebels (7-0) shut out Garrard County 48-0 in their district opener on Friday. \nSpencer Co. 47, Franklin Co. 42: What had the makings of a laugher at halftime for the Bears shaped up to be a nail-biter deep into the fourth quarter Friday. After giving up four second-quarter touchdowns to fall behind 34-7, the Flyers found their rhythm coming out of the locker room. Senior Barrett Sanderson fired two third-quarter touchdown passes while the Franklin County defense held-fast to pull the visitors with 13 points heading into the fourth. Sanderson added two more touchdown tosses in the fourth quarter, threatening to pull off a stunning comeback and hand the Bears their first loss of the season. But a pair of touchdown runs from Branden Leff preserved the win for the home team, sending Franklin Co. to its second consecutive defeat after starting the season 6-0. \nThe ground game was clicking all night for Spencer Co. Leff finished with 233 yards and 3 touchdowns on 24 carries. Logan Holbrook added 203 yards and three more touchdowns on 21 rushes. Sanderson completed 23 passes on 36 attempts for 257 yards and four scores for the Flyers, who will try to recapture their winning ways in their final regular season home game next week against North Oldham. \nNo. 17 Johnson Central 35, Greenup Co. 6: Johnson Central's Tyler Pack, who set the state record with a 60-yard field goal at Greenup County on Oct. 11, 2013, claimed another state record nearly two years to the date for the Golden Eagles (6-0). \nPack pinned the Musketeers (4-3) inside their own 1-yard line with a punt that netted 89 yards, besting the previous record of 84 by Chris Dittus (Boone County) against Bryan Station in 1992. \nNo. 11 Cooper 27, No. 10 Ryle 21: With the game knotted at 14 apiece, Byron Brown returned a kickoff 80 yards for a TD in the third quarter to spark the Jaguars (6-2), who then scored on their next possession to assume pole position in the Class 6A, District 5 race. \nThe Raiders (6-1) got to within six with nine seconds left but couldn't recover the onside kick for a chance to win it. \nCentral Hardin 40, Collins 6: It was a long night on the road for the Titans. They mustered only 198 yards against Central Hardin (4-3) while giving up 518. \nJunior running back Darius Barbour caught two first-half touchdowns from junior quarterback Reece Iler, the second of which sent the Bruins to the locker room with a 27-0 lead. \nBarbour caught five passes for 132 yards and two touchdowns and added nine carries for 67 yards and two scores on the ground. Iler went 12-of-18 passing for 300 yards and two touchdowns. \nThe Bruins' defense did the rest, picking off Collins quarterback J.R. Lucas three times. Josh Moore: (859) 231-1307.
