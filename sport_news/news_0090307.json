But the wide receiver from Wyckoff was ultimately denied what he truly wanted: a job.\n\"Give it to 81, [Hogan’s] always open,\" Heisman Trophy-winning running back Reggie Bush famously declared during an episode of HBO’s \"Hard Knocks.\" series. \"Look, what’d I tell you? He can’t be stopped. All he does is get open.\n\"Give it to 81, Coach. He’s always open: 7-Eleven.\"\nNow in his third season with the Bills, Hogan wears a different number (15).\nThe nickname of 7-Eleven is not the only thing that has stuck in the league.\nHis ascension from special teamer to a reliable piece within the Buffalo offense has been a steady climb through the previous coaching regime of Doug Marrone and the current one led by former Jets coach Rex Ryan, whose presence has re-energized the franchise.\n\"I wanted to prove I deserved that nickname, so I definitely embraced it,\" Hogan said with a laugh during a telephone interview with The Record in advance of Sunday’s game against the Giants. \"That was a once-in-a-lifetime experience for me, and to get that exposure with the whole 7-Eleven thing, it only helped me. People knew who I was. … Guys like me, though, I always have to go out and prove myself, showing I am capable of playing and being a trustworthy guy on the field.\n\"I have to make the plays the team needs me to make. You have to be ready to play.\"\nHogan should get even more chances against the Giants with star receiver Sammy Watkins having been ruled out of the game with a calf injury.\nThe 6-foot-1, 215-pounder is actually a former Giant – well, sort of, after spending three weeks on the Giants’ practice squad early in the 2011 season.\nFive months after Hogan’s departure – he landed a spot on the Dolphins’ practice squad that November — the Giants won Super Bowl XLVI in Indianapolis.\n\"That was really part of my first taste of what the league was like,\" Hogan said, referring to his time with the Giants. \"But my time there was so quick, I really don’t look back to that and think ‘what if.' I was there for two weeks just about, and I was just getting acclimated to that team and then I ended up getting cut.\"\nHogan, who turns 27 later this month, starred in football and lacrosse at Ramapo High School before heading on a lacrosse scholarship to Penn State, where he played the sport for four years. Then Hogan gave football a shot, playing one season at Monmouth before entering the NFL as an undrafted free agent.\n\"He’s kind of an underrated, under-the-radar player,\" Ryan said of Hogan, who caught 41 passes for 426 yards and four touchdowns last season. \"Obviously we’ve got some household names. … I’ll tell you where I’m really proud of him: the way he blocks and also the way he is playing special teams. Not just his receiving skills, but the other selfless things he does for this team. I’ve been very impressed with him.\"\nCount Giants cornerback Trumaine McBride in that group as well after studying video of Hogan, who displayed explosiveness in Buffalo’s 41-14 victory over the Dolphins last week with a 38-yard touchdown catch from quarterback Tyrod Taylor.\nHogan will be focused on one goal Sunday when he steps inside Ralph Wilson Stadium.\n\"Take advantage,\" Hogan said. \"I’ll be ready.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T04:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T08:42:14.627+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
