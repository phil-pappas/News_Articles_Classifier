But with injuries affecting the offensive line, the second-year center does stand out for the fact he is unscathed. \nLinsley has played every single snap possible in 21 starts for the Green Bay Packers — all 1,050 last year and every one so far this season. He's never been hurt, at least seriously enough to acknowledge publicly. \nAt his locker after the victory over the St. Louis Rams on Sunday, Linsley started to credit the Packers strength and conditioning staff for keeping him strong and healthy, when teammate Josh Sitton walked by. \n\"It's the jump rope,\" said Sitton, the Packers' left guard. \nIt's what? \nThis is Linsley, the 6-foot-3, 301-pound point man of this highly productive offensive line that has helped the undefeated Packers average 27.4 points a game, fifth-most in the NFL. The same Linsley who bench-pressed 225 pounds 36 times at the NFL combine, second-most among offensive linemen. \nSo jumping rope has helped the first center from Green Bay to make the all-rookie team get even better this year? \nSitton can be a tough guy to read. He has a great poker face and a devious sense of humor. Was he kidding? \n\"It is true,\" said Linsley. \"It's not an inside joke. I kind of did that a lot in the off-season.\" \n\"He's gotten a lot quicker with his feet because of the jump rope,\" said Sitton, seriously. \nThen, not: \"He did a lot of tandem jump rope...\" \n\"Yeah, not\" said Linsley, laughing. \nThat's how this Green Bay offensive line is. You better be quick on your feet and quicker with your wit if you're going to be the center of it all. \nSo far Linsley has held his own. Sandwiched between Sitton and right guard T.J. Lang — the older, more experienced linemen — he has managed to high-step over trouble from the defense and stay on his toes, rarely getting knocked back. \n\"He's very mature beyond being in only his second year in the league,\" said right tackle Bryan Bulaga. \"He's very smart, pays attention to detail very well and he's ready every Sunday. \n\"I know there's many times in a game where I'm screaming down the line to him, trying to get a call and he's got it right away. He's on his toes, he knows what is going on and as a center, that's big. They're telling everyone where to go and he does a great job at it because of his preparation. \n\"He's smart, tough, physical — everything you're looking for in a center.\" \nQuarterback Aaron Rodgers has been sacked just eight times in five games, which puts the Packers in the league's top 10 for fewest sacks. Green Bay also has just 19 quarterback hits on No. 12, which is tied with 4-0 Carolina for the least in the NFL. Credit for that kind of success would have to go to Rodgers and his ability to escape, as well as the protection of the line. \n\"We're honestly not big on stats,\" said Linsley. \"That's kind of an end-of-the-season thing we go back to because really, when you look on quarterback hits, how many were on us? You have to break it down. But if you get into that, you start finger-pointing. In the middle of the season, it's not worth it. \n\"We all take accountability for each other, and that's the great part of this organization.\" \nLinsley also owns up to his mistakes frequently, even as one of the youngest starters on this line. Tackle David Bakhtiari is his peer, also 24 and with just one more year of experience. But Bulaga, 26, Lang, 28, and Sitton, 29, combine for 21 years of experience. They're the leaders. \n\"The one thing that I can do with leadership is set the tempo,\" said Linsley. \"And set the huddle.\" \nOtherwise, he looks to his teammates when he can, including in the Packers' 24-10 victory over the Rams. \n\"In your second year, you start to pick up awareness,\" said Linsley. \"I'm still doing that. \n\"There were a couple of times where I saw a different look and I tried to adjust to it, but I didn't adjust to it like a veteran would. I adjusted like a young guy would. And I got beat on two plays. \n\"I came up on the sidelines and was like, 'Damn, they had that look and I was trying to do this.' And Josh said, 'You know they're going to do something different.' I'm so fortunate and blessed that I'm here because if I didn't have Josh and T.J. imagine how I would be progressing.\" \nLinsley volunteered the two mistakes again, taking the blame for the sack-fumble by Rodgers and a miscommunication with him at the end of the game with Josh Walker, who came in for an injured Lang. \n\"I basically tried to find another way,\" said Linsley. \"And sort of cheat what they were doing. But if we would have just stuck with fundamentals, it wouldn't have happened.\" \nBut his teammates still hold him in high regard. And since the start of training camp he's been the only one besides Sitton who hasn't battled an injury. Linsley credits a good health regimen with the Packers, an area of emphasis that has grown in recent years under coach Mike McCarthy. It starts with nutrition and extends all the way to practicing smart and doing drills properly, to avoid what injury he can, knowing that control is very limited in this game. \nAs the offensive line has worked its way through the injuries this season, Linsley has had to team up with backups Josh Walker and Don Barclay. But he said there are no limitations with them, and their ability to fill in has contributed to the 5-0 start. \n\"We've had some guys playing really well up front,\" said Rodgers. \"We need to trust those guys even more moving forward to get the job done.\" © 2015 , Journal Sentinel Inc.
