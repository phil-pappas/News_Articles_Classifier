BERKELEY, Calif. â€” Jared Goff got off to a shaky start and still threw for 390 yards and four touchdowns to lead No. 24 California to a 34-28 victory over Washington State on Saturday in the Golden Bears' first game as a ranked team in six years. Goff threw an early interception and was off target on a few throws before finding his groove. He threw two TD passes in a span of less than 2 minutes late in the third quarter surrounding a successful onside kick to erase an eight-point deficit and lead the Bears (5-0, 2-0 Pac-12) to their best start since 2007. Luke Falk threw two touchdown passes and ran for another score for the Cougars (2-2, 0-1), who have lost 28 of their past 28 games against ranked opponents. Washington State was in position to reverse that trend after Falk threw a 4-yard TD pass to Gabe Marks midway through the third quarter and Kenny Lawler lost a fumble on Cal's ensuing possession. Stefan McClure then changed the tide on a safety blitz that gave Cal one of its seven sacks on the day. Erik Powell then missed a 40-yard field goal wide right and Goff took over from there.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T02:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T03:03:30.536+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
