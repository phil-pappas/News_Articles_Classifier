Deputies said drivers should expect heavy delays during their commute.\nThe only available detour is Highway 24 through Bourg due to ongoing repairs to the Intracoastal lift bridge on Highway 1.\nThe accident involved two vehicles, according to state police. Investigators did not release any other details about the incident.\nCopyright 2015 WVUE .
