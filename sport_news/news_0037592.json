San Jose fell to seventh in the six-team Western Conference playoff race with two games remaining after the Portland Timbers won Wednesday night. \nThe predicament partially can be blamed on mustering only 23 points of a possible 42 at the much-ballyhooed, 18,000-seat stadium that made its debut in March. Worse, the Quakes (6-3-5 at Avaya) have won only once in the past five home games. \n\"I really don't know what the secret is,\" said midfielder Shea Salinas, who was with Philadelphia in 2010 when the Union opened PPL Park with a 6-7-3 mark. \nNeither does Quakes coach Dominic Kinnear, who enjoyed a much better experience when he and the Houston Dynamo didn't lose in their first 19 games at BBVA Compass Stadium three years ago. \nTwo other recently opened soccer stadiums also catapulted teams to the top of the league. \nSporting Kansas City lost only five times in its first 34 matches after opening a stadium in June 2011. Sporting (13-9-9, 48 points) has lost just once at home this season -- to the Earthquakes. \nNew York enjoyed similar results as Kansas City when opening Red Bull Arena in 2010. Advertisement \nBut San Jose has been unable to parlay the sellout crowds and new facility into a pronounced home-pitch advantage. \n\"It's easier said than done,\" Kinnear said, adding it's important to win at home to gain points and energize the fan base. \n\"You want your fans to go home happy,\" he said. \"It's not entirely an obligation, but there should be a thought that the people are paying money to watch you play.\" \nBy Kinnear's estimation, Quakes fans have left Avaya in good spirits all but three times this year. \nBut even one more home victory might have given the Earthquakes some help to end a two-year playoff drought. Now they almost certainly must defeat fourth-place Sporting and first-place FC Dallas in the season finale on the road next weekend to make it happen. \nSan Jose will have lineup changes Friday night when it is without central defender Victor Bernardez and midfielder Marc Pelosi. Both are ineligible because they have reached the league limit of six yellow cards. \nBut the Quakes have Fatai Alashe back from the U.S. under-23 team that finished third in a regional Olympic qualifying tournament. Alashe could replace Bernardez on the backline. \nKinnear has other options, such as using former Stanford star JJ Koval or moving Marvell Wynne over from fullback to fill Bernardez's role. \nWhoever fills in will need to continue the strong defensive performance at Avaya. San Jose has allowed only nine goals in 14 games. \n\"We just haven't scored as many goals at home as we would like,\" Salinas said of the 12 goals. \nAfter seven seasons at 10,500-seat Buck Shaw at Santa Clara University it has taken the Quakes time to adjust to their new digs. \nSalinas said the team had an advantage because of Buck Shaw's grass field was slippery for opponents. \n\"The grass here is great grass for everyone so there is not a home-turf advantage,\" he said. \nPerhaps the Earthquakes have learned a lesson about the grass not always being greener.
