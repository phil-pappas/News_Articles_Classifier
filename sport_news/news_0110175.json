However, in reality, every movement, local or provincial or all India, is linked with the larger issue of raising Hindu consciousness so that Hindus can assert their right to live in Hindu India. A few facts may be mentioned to substantiate the argument that seemingly “one issue movement” is for creating a fertile soil for the establishment of a Hindu state. First, the last decade of the 20th century had witnessed Hindu mobilisation on the issue of Ram Janambhoomi and when the storm created by this movement came to a violent end, it was concluded that this was one issue based on “religious faith” of Hindus and with the destruction of the Babri mosque, projected as a symbol of Muslim invaders, things would cool down and India would settle down as a normal pluralist democracy. Did it happen? The answer is a big no. Violence against religious minority is a logical offshoot of politics of religious polarisation practised by the Sangh Parivar. It is essential to substantiate the basic argument that there is no holiday for the Hindu Sangh Parivar and the temple-mosque episode of 1990-92 did not bring an end to their ambition of establishing a Hindu state. In 2015, the Sangh Parivar is emboldened by the presence of their own governments at the Centre and the states which are in the heartland of India. The Parivar is now pushing forward the agenda of Hindu consolidation by pinching on the issue of “cow slaughter and beef eating”. The issue of cow slaughter for eating cow meat by Muslims is not just a local issue when Akhlaq Mohammad is killed by a Hindu mob at Dadri on the basis of a rumour. The activity of targeting suspected beef-eating Muslims has a national dimension because the state governments have been compelled to prove that they are great “protectors” of the cow, which according to BJP MP Yogi Adityanath, is rashtra mata. Another BJP MP Sakshi Maharaj, while describing cow as mother, said if someone killed his mother, he will kill him. The implication of such statements is quite clear that violence against Muslims who have been identified by governments and leaders of the Parivar as “killers of the holy cow” is justified. The Parivar has placed the issue of cow slaughter and beef eating in the public domain with a view to targeting Muslims by holding them responsible for slaughtering the cow, irrespective of any hard evidence. Every anti-Muslim riot is hurting the economy of the Muslim community and every city in Uttar Pradesh, like Moradabad, Saharanpur, Meerut and Muzaffarnagar, has seen burning and looting of shops and small-scale establishments of Muslims, impacting their economy. Every study of a riot-affected area brings about one fact that Muslims want “security of life, prosperity and dignity of their women folk”. What is the constitutional and legal framework about cow slaughter in India under which the state governments are expected to work? On November 24, 1948, Hindu-minded Pandit Thakur Dass Bhargava, Seth Govind Das and Raghu Vira insisted on banning cow slaughter and even a few Hindu-minded Constituent Assembly members demanded that the “banning of cow slaughter should be in Part III of Fundamental Rights” because as conservative Hindu Raghu Vira observed, “The cow was mother of the mother.” The demand was not accepted and Article 48 of the Constitution in Part IV “Directive Principles of State Policy”, in a very convoluted form, mentions that “cows and calves” shall not be slaughtered and more than this constitutional guarantee is not required to deal with the problem of the safety of the cow. However, for the Parivar this is not the issue concerning the safety of the cow. It is a broader issue of “reshaping the constitutional scheme of India” where only Hindus, their beliefs, sentiments and matters of faith would be the guiding principles of state policies and other religious communities will have to accept the supremacy of the ideology of a Hindu state. This is the reason that eminent Sahitya Akademi award winners belonging to every state and language group have submitted their resignations to the akademi while protesting against the rising “culture of intolerance”. The arrogant and intolerant Modi government is not disturbed on the notice served by “men of letters” against “Hindu rashtravadis” who are killing dissenters and rationalists and targeting innocent Muslims. Akhlaq’s lynching is a net consequence of the march of Hindutva forces that have taken upon themselves to target Muslims on the issue of “love jihad” or conversion or reconversion. This atmosphere of hatred led a disturbed President Pranab Mukherjee to warn recently that “over the years, our civilisation has celebrated diversity, plurality and promoted and advanced tolerance”. Speaking to the Jordan Arab daily, Al Ghad, he reiterated: “Tolerance and coexistence are basic tenets to our civilisation”. From Ayodhya (1990-1992) to post-Godhra riots (2002) to Dadri (September 2015), the Parivar has launched every movement around the single goal of making India a Hindu state. The strategy to achieve this goal is to move forward step by step and launch a “single issue” movement and wait for the “second movement”. The situation is qualitatively different in 2015 because the state power is in the hands of RSS swayamsevaks, whether it is the Prime Minister or chief ministers or the government or heads of autonomous institutions. It is clearly visible that in the present context, “Hindu rashtravadis”, the RSS and its affiliates are free to target minorities because of the protection they are enjoying. Not only this, dissenters, however eminent, are coerced to silence by the witch-hunt launched by the RSS and ministers, as shown by Arun Jaitley’s comment on October 15 that “resignations are on the basis of a manufactured crisis by the awardees of the Sahitya Akademi”. Do we need any more evidence to illustrate the fact of growing culture of intolerance? — The writer is a former professor of political science at JNU", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T06:04:17.524+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
