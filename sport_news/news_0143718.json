Bogut describes the 49ers newcomer as \"The   James.\" September 29th 2015 7 days ago   \nTHE Golden State Warriors will have a new-look Andrew Bogut entering the 2015/16 NBA season, with the big-man dropping an impressive 10 kilograms over the off-season. \nBogut spoke with CSNBayarea.com’s Monte Pool , crediting his weight-loss to New Zealand documentary ‘Is Sugar the New Fat?’, which aired on SBS in August. \n“I changed my diet a little bit. It’s really worked wonders for me,” said Bogut. \n“I watched that documentary. It’s unbelievable, man. (Sugar) is in absolutely everything. I have a couple friends that are label readers. I used to give them so much (crap), telling them, ‘Man, just eat it. Stop reading the label.’ And now I’m one of those guys.” \nThe Australian big-man is hoping this new lifestyle change can translate to his play, and carry over when the NBA season begins on October 27th. \n“I want to get a couple post moves, roll to the glass strong and finish. It takes a lot of pressure off us, then we can get a decent shot from the perimeter,” said Bogut.
