Jason Farmer / Staff Photographer JASON FARMER / STAFF PHOTOGRAPHER Abinton Heights’ Abby Brown (15) and Scranton Prep’s Jillian Paulus fight for ball control Saturday. \nScranton Prep’s girls soccer team carried the momentum from an emotional regular-season finale into Saturday’s playoff for the Lackawanna League Division I championship. \nFrom the opening whistle, the Classics dominated the possession and Cara Griffith picked up where she left off on Thursday with a goal in the 16th minute that proved to be the difference, as they won their fourth straight division title by defeating Abington Heights for the second time in three days, 2-1, at Loyola Field. \nScranton Prep (13-1) also secured the No. 2 seed in the upcoming District 2 Class AA playoffs and will have home-field advantage until the championship round, while Abington Heights (12-2) is the third seed. \n“All season long, the girls fight and they battle,” Scranton Prep coach Doug Knieser said. “To play the same team twice in three days, it’s difficult to pull out two victories. I felt like they really played well and I felt like they deserved to win.” \nGriffith, the reigning Times-Tribune Player of the Year who scored the game-winning goal in the 73rd minute Thursday, got the scoring started in the 16th minute for the Classics. \nPlaying on the left wing, she took a through ball from Eileen Casey, cut to her right and lost her defender just inside the 18-yard box. Griffith then had just one defender to beat and she slipped her shot through her and goalkeeper Johanna Show for the goal and a 1-0 lead. \n“I think it was a really big game-changer,” Griffith said. “We were dominating possession from the start but that really got our intensity up even more and it made us even harder to compete with.” \nThe Classics continued to push offensively, while not caving on defense and didn’t allow a first-half shot. \nIt was much of the same in the second half and it wasn’t converting on every shot, Scranton Prep got an insurance goal in the 61st minute. Griffith chipped a pass that was headed for a wide-open net and Madison Ziobro was there to clean it up for the goal. \n“It couldn’t happen at a better time,” Knieser said of the momentum his team has created over the past week. “Right before playoffs, we’re coming off two big wins. We’re confident, we’re comfortable with the way we’re playing and we’re looking forward to going into districts and seeing where we’re at.” \nContact the writer: shennigan@timesshamrock.com \nAbington Heights (12-2) 0 0 — 0 Scranton Prep (13-1) 1 1 — 2 \nSP — Cara Griffith (Eileen Casey). 15:54 \nSP — Madison Ziobro (Griffith). 60:22 \nShots-corners: AH 4-6, SP 20-5. \nSaves: Johanna Show (AH) 14, A.J.
