The university held a news conference Wednesday afternoon in the TAU Room of the Events Center to announce the donation and the naming of the court. \nThe largest previous donations to the department had been two separate gifts of $250,000. Paul Saunders and his sons made a donation to name the West Gym pool the Patricia A. Saunders Aquatics Center. The other quarter-million-dollar donation went toward naming the lobby of the Events Center in honor of Ruthanne Koffman and Burton “Bud” Koffman. \n“We just saw a natural connection to athletics with him, his love of sport,” Binghamton University President Harvey Stenger said of Lee. “I know that he has had patients that come from the sports medicine office as referrals. This just was a need that we had. This was something that we were as enthusiastic about as the donor.” \nThe money donated by Lee, who has been on the Binghamton University Foundation Board of Directors since 2014, will go toward upgrades in the strength and conditioning and sports medicine facilities, as well as the Student Athlete Success Center, which focuses on providing academic services for student-athletes. The university hopes it will also help attract high-level athletes. \n“This gift will help us recruit and retain better, strong, faster student-athletes,” Stenger said. \nNo specific projects have been earmarked yet, at least publicly, but the men’s basketball and women’s basketball locker rooms in the Events Center were renovated as part of the project. The men’s locker room renovations were completed earlier this month. \n“It’s tremendous. I mean, to have a gift of this size — it allows us to build in a lot of different areas and things that benefit all of our student-athletes,” Binghamton University Director of Athletics Patrick Elliott said. “In college athletics today, it’s important from a strength and condition standpoint, from an academic support perspective, from sports medicine and other areas, that you continue to grow.” \nLee serves as president of Lee Health Care as well as senior attending gynecologist at United Health Services and Lourdes Hospital in Binghamton. He came to the Southern Tier in 1972, and he was the first maternal fetal medicine specialist in Binghamton. \nHe established the high-risk pregnancy center at Wilson Memorial Hospital, and he has delivered more than 7,000 babies and performed more than 10,000 surgeries. \nFrom left, Binghamton University Director of Athletics Patrick Elliot, Dr. Bai Lee, Dr. Jung Yum and BU President Harvey Stenger following a news conference Wednesday in the Events Center.

Video By: Lynn Worthy \nStenger also relayed the story of Lee touring the sports medicine facilities and receiving a hug from an assistant trainer. Lee did not recognize the woman initially, but she told Lee that he was the doctor who had delivered her. \nLee and his wife, Dr. Jung Yum, have two children and three grandchildren. They also have a charitable foundation, The Lee and Yum Foundation. \nLee said his connection to the university started with his own children. They attended Vestal High School, and during their senior years, they took courses at Binghamton University. Over the years, he has built friendships and got to know Stenger. He and Stenger golf together on occasion. \nLee said he hoped to establish a foundation of giving that will inspire others to also give back. \n“I came from Korea in 1965 with $50 in my pocket, and I have done great in this community,” Lee said. “I think it’s time for me to give back some of that to (make) the community better. I picked Binghamton University because I believe in education.” \nLee wanted his donation to go where the university felt it was needed most, and it was a mutual decision between him and the university to make the gift to the athletics department. \nHis donation began with the basketball locker rooms, and it has expanded to a donation that should reach all 21 varsity teams at the university. \nAn official naming ceremony for the court will take place on Nov. 15, when the men’s basketball team hosts Army. \nOn Twitter: @PSBLynn 5 CONNECT 2 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://press.sn/1Lua3WJ TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T12:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T13:16:01.756+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
