Steve Helber/AP Three-time Sprint Cup Series champion Tony Stewart announced Wednesday that he will retire as a driver after the 2016 season. Stewart, 44, will have raced in NASCAR‚Äôs top series for 18 seasons when he retires next year, with more than 600 starts. Stewart is tied for 13th on NASCAR‚Äôs all-time wins list with 48, the third most of any active driver (behind only Jeff Gordon and Jimmie Johnson). Clint Bowyer will replace Stewart in the No. 14 car in 2017.\nStewart says he still plans to race ‚Äî just not in the Sprint Cup Series. Stewart is a controversial figure, but he‚Äôs unquestionably a NASCAR legend, and his fellow drivers and fans are sad to see him go.\nWe've had our moments, but its been awesome to race with and against you @TonyStewart pic.twitter.com/E1cn26Y6Wl\n‚Äî Joey Logano (@joeylogano) September 30, 2015\nBittersweet listening to one of my biggest heroes make his announcement today.
