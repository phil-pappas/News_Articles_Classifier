By LYNN GENSAMER Driving home the other day, I heard a public service announcement about nuisance barking. It explained something all of us in the shelter world know well.\nBarking is a symptom of a problem, not the problem. Not only do shock collars and punishment for barking not stop the barking, they can lead to other, more serious problems. Boredom is the most common cause of constant barking. Anxiety and frustration are other causes.\nDogs are social beings — they want to be with you. You probably won’t catch your pet being bored, because once you appear, all signs of doggie boredom magically vanish. When you do spend time with your dog, make it quality time like interacting and playing, and include plenty of exercise like daily walks.\nWhen your dog is alone, try some of these simple ideas to help reduce boredom and make your dog’s time alone more entertaining and enjoyable.\n• Leave a radio on. Set clock radios to come on at different times, in different rooms and on different stations. Avoid rock ‘n’ roll, which can excite or irritate your dog. Classical music has been proven to have a calming effect on dogs, but you can also try other types of soothing music, like those golden oldies or a smooth jazz station.\n• Pick the right toys. Choose toys that stimulate active, entertaining play, like weighted rubber balls that roll in random directions or chew toys in a variety of shapes and textures. A toy you can pack with healthy, low-calorie treats can provide hours of entertainment as your dog works to figure out how to get every ounce of the goody out.\n• Recycle toys. Alternate the toys you leave with your dog. Put some away and clean up the old ones, so that each day your dog can look forward to interesting “new” toys.\n• Provide a view. If your dog is confined indoors, make sure she has access to a window or patio door so she can see the outside world. A mirror mounted in a pet’s play area can also help keep young dogs entertained.\n• Consider a second pet. Adding another pet is a big decision that shouldn’t be taken lightly. That said, two dogs can be better than one (remember, they are social animals), especially if you regularly leave your dog alone for long periods of time. A canine companion can alleviate the loneliness of a solo pet. Two dogs will keep each other company, and if they get along well, will play together often.\nTonight from 4-7 p.m., the Sheriff’s Office will be hosting a Safety Fair and Bike Rodeo on the County Jail property. Plenty of valuable info and fun for the whole family. The dogs in Class 37 of Operation New Hope will be there, too. It’s an ideal opportunity to meet them before they are available for adoption on Graduation Day on Oct. 10.\nLynn Gensamer is the executive director of Humane Society for Greater Savannah.
