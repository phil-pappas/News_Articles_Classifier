(AP) - Tennessee reserve linebacker Quart'e Sapp is out indefinitely with a stress fracture in his foot. Volunteers coach Butch Jones said Wednesday that Sapp will miss \"an inordinate amount of time.\" Jones added that he \"can't really put a time frame on it.\" Sapp, who is from Alpharetta, Georgia, played in each of Tennessee's first four games and made three tackles. Tennessee (2-2, 0-1 SEC) hosts Arkansas (1-3, 0-1) on Saturday. Jones also said wide receiver Alton \"Pig\" Howard's status remains uncertain for the Arkansas game. Howard missed the Vols' 28-27 loss to Florida last week with an injury that hasn't been specified. (Copyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
