With the win the Cardinals (6-3) will now host St.James Area – a 31-20 upset winner over third-seeded Lakeview – in the Section 3AA semifinals at 1 p.m. Saturday afternoon in Redwood Falls. It was just the second win of the season for the Saints (2-7) who were steamrolled by the Cardinals 48-7 in week five. Top-seed Pipestone Area (9-0) crushed eighth-seed GFW 56-0 and will face Windom Area – who it defeated 42-0 in week three – in the other semifinal. In other words, mark your calendar for Friday, Oct. 23 at 7:30 p.m. in Marshall (SMSU), because Redwood Valley vs. Pipestone Area II will be the feature presentation on that night. The two teams hooked up Sept. 25 in Pipestone, with the Arrows surviving 26-18 in overtime. “We’re one game closer to our match-up with Pipestone Area which is what we’ve wanted all along,” Coach Matt Lundeen said. “We will not overlook St. James, but our kids are excited for this opportunity to make a deep run in the postseason.” Tuesday night the Cards took control early in the first half, as sophomore Logan Josephson exploded on a nice 55-yard touchdown run around the right end for a 7-0 lead. Just over two minutes later the Cards would score again, as sophomore Mitch Irlbeck connected with Cade Johnson on a beautiful fade to the right corner of the end zone that would up the lead to 14-0. The Sting (1-8) – who had come into the contest having been outscored 170-0 in their previous four outings – played scrappy for most of the first half, but the Cards would apply the dagger with two scores in the final 2:11 of the second quarter. Josephson scored his second touchdown of the night on a two-yard plunge, and with just six seconds to play, Johnson hit senior Collin Rasmussen on a 27-yard strike to make it 28-0 at the half. “It was nice to be able to punch in those two late scores to really take control,” Lundeen said. “Once we settled in we played well defensively and offensively I thought it was a good, efficient effort tonight.” Johnson – who has opened some eyes with his booming leg this fall – converted a 43-yard field goal to make it 31-0 in the third. The Cards would add a safety, and then Josephson would cap off a big night with his third touchdown, this time on a 42-yard scamper. He would finish with six carries for 113 yards and three touchdowns, averaging 18.7 yards per carry.
