They had averaged just 4.89 yards per first-down play in their first four games. On Sunday, they averaged a season-high 7.48, amassing 314 of their 519 yards on 42 first-down plays. Running backs DeMarco Murray, Ryan Mathews and Darren Sproles, who had collectively averaged just 3.0 yards per carry on first down in the first four games, averaged 5.8 Sunday. One hundred thirty-one of the Eagles' 186 rushing yards came on first down. Sam Bradford completed 15 of 19 first-down passes and averaged 9.5 yards per attempt on first down. Both of his touchdown passes came on first-down plays. In the first four games, Bradford had averaged just 6.5 yards per attempt on first down. 102.1 \nThat's Sam Bradford's second-half passer rating in the first five games. Bradford, who completed 13 of 15 passes in the second half Sunday, has a .702 second-half completion percentage and is averaging 8.0 yards per attempt. That's the good news. The bad news is he hasn't been nearly as good in the first half. His first-half passer rating is 65.6. He has completed just 56.2 percent of his first-half passes and has averaged just 5.5 yards per attempt. All three of his league-high red-zone interceptions have come in the first half, including the two against the Saints. The Eagles have outscored opponents 85-50 in the second half, but have been outscored in the first half, 37-53. 10 \nThat would be the total number of turnovers the Eagles have committed in their first five games. While they forced a season-high four Saints turnovers Sunday, they also had two more of their own as Bradford threw his fifth and sixth interceptions of the season. They're currently on pace for 32 giveaways, which would be just four fewer than last year. Just two teams have more giveaways than the Eagles – Detroit (15) and Indianapolis (12). Three more – Houston, New Orleans and Tampa Bay – also have 10. The combined record of those other five teams: 7-18. 104", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T04:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T04:41:44.765+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
