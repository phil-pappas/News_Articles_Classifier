The other five districts will be equipped throughout 2016.\nIn the draft of the policy released in September , officers working off-duty and sergeants were not included (only patrol officers and corporals).\nBut after criticism, White said recently off-duty cops will be required to wear body cameras. Tuesday he told the safety committee it would be a challenge but doable.\nPressure has been growing for the police department to require the cameras for officers working off-duty security. When police work these assignments, their wages are paid by the businesses who hire them. But the officers wear their uniforms, use department-issued equipment and are bound by department rules. If they use excessive force, the city can be held liable.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T11:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T02:04:08.414+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
