Get lined up. Get in a good stance. Get your vision right. “That’s one thing their tempo does to you, it gets you losing your concentration,” Skrosky said. “When they start stringing those plays together, generally that’s what happens. People aren’t lined up. They get caught up in the eye candy, the motions and the speed, and they just don’t have discipline with their eyes.” Those seemingly minimal breaks in the dam — all occurring before the ball is snapped — can become problems of tidal wave proportions against unbeaten and turbo-charged James Madison, which leads the Football Championship Subdivision in total offense (614.5 yards per game) while also ranking second nationally in scoring (48.3 points per game) and fourth in rushing (320.7 yards per game). Elon senior safety Miles Williams said he has seen explosiveness and confidence in full as he has studied video of star quarterback Vad Lee and his castmates on the Dukes’ quick-strike offense. Williams is one of nine starters on Elon’s defense who experienced last year’s dizzying encounter, when James Madison piled up 59 points on the Phoenix and delivered blistering drives that lasted 1 minute, 50 seconds or less to generate six of eight touchdowns. “I think we underestimated the tempo preparing for that game last year, and when we got there it was like we were getting hit by a train,” Williams said. “It was happening really fast. “I think we understand much better how to prepare for them this year. Practicing for that tempo has been an emphasis all summer long. We’ve been making sure we don’t want to have that feeling we did last year of running all around and not being able execute.” Towson, which Elon defeated three weeks ago for its first victory in the Colonial Athletic Association, pulled within 27-23 of James Madison last week in the third quarter. Immediately thereafter, James Madison’s Charles Tutt returned the ensuing kickoff 92 yards for a touchdown. Lee then tossed a pair of scoring passes in rapid succession and the Dukes were breaking away for a 51-30 victory. “With JMU it’ll happen like that,” Skrosky said, snapping his fingers. “They’re certainly on a run, and they’re playing that way. They’re playing with swag.” Said Williams, “They’re putting up basketball points. It’s cool to see from a defender’s perspective, because you obviously want to play against the best. We definitely have a challenge ahead of us.” Page 2 of 2 - Skrosky said a negative consequence of operating so swiftly on offense is that sometimes fast-paced teams aren’t always in the best play call for a particular situation. And that can make an offense susceptible to turnovers, which happens to be the case for James Madison. The Dukes have coughed up 12 turnovers through six games this season. Ten of those are interceptions thrown by Lee, the most for any quarterback in the CAA (his 17 touchdown passes lead the league, too). “They’re turning the ball over at a pretty high rate and you hope you can capitalize on those turnovers,” Skrosky said. “If we have a chance to win this game, those are the things that are going to have to take place.” It also stands to reason that Elon’s work-in-progress offense must summon its best performance. A pair of 17-point games serves as the high-water mark for the Phoenix in terms of scoring this season. True freshman Daniel Thompson has taken the reins as the acknowledged starter at quarterback. While Thompson (averaging 229 passing yards in the last two games) has been intercepted six times in the last six quarters, he has shown a knack for getting Elon moving — though the Phoenix reached Richmond territory on seven drives last week before scoring its first points. “Those hurt,” Thompson said. “We need to score more points and we’ve got to control the ball. We have to play our game and play it right, have those eight-play drives, 12-play drives where our defense is getting a break and we’re scoring points.” No. 5 James Madison (6-0, 3-0) at Elon (2-4, 1-2) Kickoff: 3 p.m. Saturday Radio: WSML-FM 104.5, WSML-AM 1200 Where: Rhodes Stadium, Elon (capacity 11,250) Coaches: Everett Withers (second season at James Madison, 15-4).
