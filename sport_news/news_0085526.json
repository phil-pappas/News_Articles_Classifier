Common opponent scores are vital but I give the edge to the Highlanders, for now, because of how close they played Mission Viejo and that they took Los Alamitos' best shot the week before San Juan Hills' got its crack. \nThe Griffins didn't have probably their most valuable player, two-way standout Schuyler Whitehead , against San Juan Hills. He would have helped make the score closer. \nIt's a tough call between La Habra and San Juan Hills. The Highlander' rout of El Toro also is looking more impressive by the week. We'll see how the Stallions' common scores fare against El Toro and Mission Viejo. \nJSerra and Orange Lutheran dropped in my rankings because of the quality county victories recorded by Tesoro and San Juan Hills. But with the Trinity League opening Friday, the Lancers and Lions could be on the rise. \nMy vote:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T20:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T21:54:36.629+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
