More > \n(RNN) - An exceptionally dramatic clash for a Thursday night game happens on ESPN, when desperate-to-win Auburn travels to Kentucky, which will be trying to write the chapter in the history of the Wildcat football turnaround about the day the dream became real. \nAuburn coach Gus Malzahn won't name a starting quarterback until kickoff, but the gut feeling is this will mark the return of Jeremy Johnson. The talented junior got off to a wretched start and sat the last two games. \nIf he does come out of the shadows and rallies the Tigers to victory, hope returns to the Plains and Auburn might begin its own turnaround. \nIf not, look out below. And hello, Kentucky, born again hard, poised for a title run. Auburn at Kentucky 7 p.m. ESPN \nAuburn is about a 2.5 point favorite tonight, and it makes you wonder why. The Tigers are in a tailspin, and the latest turn in the widening gyre came when D’haquille Williams, excellent receiver but troubled young man, got kicked off the team for allegedly getting in a bar fight. \nMalzahn is going to make a game-time decision on whether to start Jeremy Johnson or freshman Sean White. Johnson appears to have recovered from battle fatigue sustained in a nightmarish game at LSU. After sacks, interceptions and about 100 yards passing, Malzahn benched him the next game because he “lost confidence.” \nWhite filled in and tried real hard in a home loss to Mississippi State and a 35-21 win over San Jose State. \nThe defense, giving up 472 yards and 27 points per game, hasn’t been appreciably better than last year, when it was awful. \nIf Auburn can turn things around, now would be a good time. \nKentucky is 4-1 and second in the East Division because of a 14-9 loss to division leader Florida. The Wildcats helped hasten Steve Spurrier’s retirement with a 26-22 win at South Carolina and gutted out a 21-13 win over Missouri, which may or may not be pretty good this year. \nAuburn is fighting not to utterly flame out before the leaves start to fall, and Kentucky is on the verge of respect, bowl games and becoming a - no kidding - contender in the dumpster-wreck-train-fire of this year's East Division race. \nThe Wildcats' excellent all-purpose back Stanley “Boom” Williams is in the lineup after missing last week with a “personal issue” that involved missing practices before the Eastern Kentucky game, which required OT to win without him. He and Jo Jo Williams are an excellent tandem in the backfield. \nPatrick Towles is a quarterback that makes things happen, most of them good. He says if he can’t play in the NFL one day, he wants to be a missionary. If he were head coach for a day, he added, he would get the whole team free ice cream all day long. \nHe has no confidence problems and to our knowledge has never been in a bar fight. \nCopyright 2015 Raycom News Network.
