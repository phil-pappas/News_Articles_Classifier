(AP Photo/Darren Abate) More Spurs Headlines Spurs unveil alternate black jersey \nSAN ANTONIO - Markieff Morris had 17 points and the Phoenix Suns had four others in double figures, outrunning the San Antonio Spurs 104-84 on Tuesday night. \nKawhi Leonard had 14 points to lead San Antonio, which lost for the fourth time in five preseason games. LaMarcus Aldridge, the Spurs' prized free-agent signing, was held to nine points for the second straight home game. Aldridge made his first attempt, a 20-foot jumper from the right wing off a drive-and-kick by Tony Parker, but finished 4 for 10. \nThe Spurs played deliberately on offense, working to get the ball to Aldridge early in the game. The Suns played more freely, taking advantage of 43-33 advantage in rebounds. \nPhoenix had 24 fast break points compared to just six by San Antonio, bolstering Spurs coach Gregg Popovich's pre-game declaration that his team needed to improve its transition defense. \nPhoenix finished 11 for 21 on 3-pointers. \nMorris had a pair of 3-pointers during an 12-2 run for a 61-50 lead with eight minutes left in the third quarter. \nSPURS: G Patty Mills sat out the game for \"rest.\" Mills is averaging 18.5 minutes per game in the preseason. ... Tim Duncan, who is listed at center in the starting lineup, had 10 points. ... G Jimmer Fredette, who did not play Tuesday, has been used sparingly in the preseason, playing just 26 minutes in two games. \nSUNS: F T.J. Warren had 15 points, including a fast-break layup after stripping Leonard of his dribble near midcourt in the first half. ... Morris was 3 for 3 on 3-pointers, raising his preseason percentage to 54 percent on 7-for-13 shooting from long range. Copyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
