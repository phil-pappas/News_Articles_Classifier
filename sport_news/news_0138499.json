If not for referee Craig Joubert's controversial last-minute penalty, a decision that World Rugby later admitted was a mistake, then it would be the Scots, rather than the Wallabies in this last four clash. \nBut surely Australia, and in particular fly-half Bernard Foley, will not be as poor again when they take on Argentina at Twickenham? The Pumas have lit up the tournament with some dazzling displays, most notably when they put Ireland to the sword 43-20 in the quarter finals. If they go one better and beat the Wallabies, then this exciting South American side would really prove itself as a major force in international rugby. \nCatch the game on SuperSport channels 201/206 if you are in Ghana. Kickoff is at 4pm Ghana time. \nThe passionate Pumas are still pegged as the underdogs in the match (and don't Kiwis love an underdog), despite their victories at the tournament this year. During their last game they knocked out Ireland with their power and pace in a convincing 43-20 lead, but they have never beaten the All Blacks. \nHowever, Australia have looked strong throughout the competition, and were picked as a favourite from the outset. They have been great contenders against the All Blacks in the past. \nYet, New Zealand has never played Australia in a Rugby World Cup final. \n[PHOTO]http://img.modernghana.com/images/content/Follow Joy Sports on Twitter: @Joy997FM.
