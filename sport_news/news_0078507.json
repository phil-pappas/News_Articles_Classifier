He stayed face-down on the field for a few moments before eventually sitting up as trainers and doctors checked on him, and walked off the field on his own at Gillette Stadium. \nCoach Todd Bowles says Monday the team will see how Mangold feels as the week goes along to determine his availability for Sunday’s game at Oakland. Second-year offensive lineman Dakota Dozier replaced him for three snaps against the Patriots. \nBowles says safety Calvin Pryor has a sprained ankle. \n___ \nAP NFL website: www.pro32.ap.org and www.twitter.com/AP_NFL Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T23:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T23:51:25.588+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
