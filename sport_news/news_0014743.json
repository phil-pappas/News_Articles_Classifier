Then the line blender took over. Patrick Kane and Hossa swapped lines as Quenneville tried to look for a spark.\n\"I still think we're at that explore level right now,\" Quenneville said of his lineup. \"Until we feel all four lines are going and we like the way they're rolling in a game.\"\nBut there was little to like Thursday.\nThe Capitals got on the board after T.J. Oshie scored from the slot 17 seconds into a Capitals' power play at 8 minutes, 48 seconds of the first period. It was Oshie's first goal as a Capital.\nWhile the Hawks generated several more chances in the second period, goaltender Braden Holtby stopped them while the Capitals added another goal from John Carlson.\nMatt Niskanen made it 3-0 early at 2:32 in the third period while Viktor Svedberg finally snapped the Hawks drought with his first-career goal at 3:13. The Hawks had gone over five periods without scoring a goal.\nAlex Ovechkin, who missed the Capitals' last game after oversleeping and missing that morning's skate, scored the fourth goal to put the game away at 14:18 of the third period.\n(c)2015 Chicago Tribune\nVisit the Chicago Tribune at www.chicagotribune.com\n ", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/hockey/s-1738498&hashtags=ArcaMax", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/hockey/s-1738498&h=Blackhawks+lackluster+again+in+4%2D1+loss+to+Capitals", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/hockey/s-1738498"], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T08:06:38.545+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
