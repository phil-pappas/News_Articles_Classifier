The training complex is also home to the Los Angeles Lakers.\nThe Kings didn't know about the bad ice until it was too late to find another rink for practice. They are participating in a charity golf tournament Tuesday, which means they won't get back on ice until Wednesday.\nLos Angeles has won two straight games after losing three straight to start the season.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T16:57:49.678+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
