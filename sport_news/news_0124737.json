For those that braved Friday night’s miserable weather conditions, they certainly got their money’s worth under the lights at Kaley Field. Trailing by four with less than two minutes to play, Greencastle-Antrim drove 83 yards to the East Pennsboro 1-yard line, setting up second-and-goal following a spike to stop the clock. A delay of game penalty ensued, backing the ball to the 6, before East Pennsboro stuffed three straight Blue Devil rushing attempts, forcing a turnover on downs at the 1 with 0.8 seconds remaining, sealing the Panthers’ 20-16 Mid-Penn Colonial Division victory. “We ran out of time,” G-A head coach Chuck Tinninis said. “We march it down the field and we had three shots at it. I just told our kids to keep your heads up high. We kept battling, they kept battling, and it was just a good high school football game.” Having started from their own 16 with 1:53 remaining, the Blue Devils (4-1, 1-1 MPC-Colonial) moved to the 50 on a 22-yard completion from Spencer Meyers to Tyler Jeffreys, providing another fresh set of downs. Consecutive connections between Meyers and Derek Measell covering 31 yards kept hope alive, spotting the ball inside the East Penn 20. Meyers then hit Bailey Parker across the middle for 18 yards, leading to the spike on first down at the 1. Ultimately, aided by G-A’s costly penalty, East Penn (4-1, 2-0 MPC-Colonial) made the decisive stand, dealing the Blue Devils their first loss of the season. “Our two-minute offense went down the field, we spiked it and then we have to get out there and get the play off,” Tinninis said regarding the delay of game penalty that eliminated three chances at the end zone from the 1. “But, you know what, we gave ourselves a shot to do that. I’m proud of our kids. We didn’t give up until the last second.” Prior to Mother Nature impacting a significant portion of the first half, both sides scored on their opening possessions, with Demetrius Burton’s determined 20-yard touchdown run giving G-A an early 7-0 lead. The Panthers responded on a 24-yard scoring pass from Kyle Purnell to Onasis Neely, tying things at 7 with 4:28 to play in the first quarter. Steady rain and periodic wind gusts hampered production from there, with neither team able to sustain drives, thus sending the contest to halftime knotted at 7. Emerging to slightly improved conditions to start the third quarter, the Blue Devils reclaimed the advantage on a 30-yard field goal by Austyn Smith, capping a drive that featured back-to-back bursts by Burton and Measell, moving to the East Penn 15. Needing just three plays to answer, a 38-yard touchdown pass from Purnell to Matt Dunkelberger put the Panthers ahead 13-10 after the extra point attempt hit the upright, leaving Greencastle with its first deficit of the game. Page 2 of 2 - Beginning to establish an offensive rhythm, Kyrin Zimmerman ripped off 34 yards on an inside reverse, having the Blue Devils threatening to open the fourth. Four plays later, James Hines powered across the goal line from 2 yards out, giving G-A a 16-10 cushion with 10:54 left following a failed point-after try. Continuing to exchange blows, East Penn again responded, as a 31-yard hookup from Purnell to Dunkelberger advanced the Panthers to the Blue Devil 18. Facing third down, Purnell hit Justin Gieseler on a textbook slant, resulting in a 12-yard touchdown and a 20-16 Panther lead. Taking over after a G-A three-and-out, East Penn appeared in position to put the game away, needing to convert fourth-and-1 from the Blue Devil 10. A 5-yard penalty made it fourth-and-6 prior to Jeffreys bringing down Purnell for a loss, setting the stage for G-A’s impressive, yet unsuccessful final drive. “We ran out of time, that’s what I say,” Tinninis said. “We just have to come back and get ready for next week.” Purnell finished 10-of-18 for 192 yards and three touchdowns for the Panthers while Kyron Dennis rushed 15 times for 66 yards. Meyers went 9-of-12 for 109 yards in the loss with Burton (66 yards) and Hines (65 yards) splitting G-A’s workload on the ground. Looking ahead, the Blue Devils face a unique situation for their Mid-Penn crossover tilt next week, taking on Hershey in a Saturday night game being played at Milton Hershey.
