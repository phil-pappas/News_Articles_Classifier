I'm not having it,\" Stephen A. Smith said. \nThe \"First Take\" co-host is getting personal with former NBA MVP Kevin Durant. Quick recap: Last week, Smith reported Durant is leaning toward signing with the Lakers in 2016. \nDurant shot down the rumors, telling the Oklahoman, \"I don't talk to Stephen A. Smith at all. Nobody in my family, my friends, they don't talk to Stephen A. Smith. So he's lying.\" That prompted the threat. \n\"And I'm looking right into the camera. And I'm gonna say it again. You don't want to make an enemy out of me. I'm not having it,\" Smith said. \nSo it got personal. Which — when it comes to Stephen A. Smith — sounds kind of familiar. \n76ers guard Michael Carter-Williams wrote an article criticizing Smith for accusing Philadelphia of tanking to get a high draft pick in 2014, saying he and the rest of the media were \"missing a lot of context\" in their stories. \nSmith went on his radio show and again responded to the allegations with a threat against an athlete he's supposed to cover. \n\"If these guys want to come at me, let them do it at their own peril.

In response, Gordon wrote an article that asked, b \nThis is all within the last year, so it's looking like professional athletes are getting fed up with Smith's acerbic style of reporting. And members of the media aren't far behind. \nTroy Machir of Sporting News wrote, \"It's not so much that Smith is right or wrong, but that he continues to make things personal. ... Smith is a journalist by trade, a profession whose role is to tell the story, not be the story. He criticizes but refuses to be criticized. He has become the story, one very few want to read.\" \nOf course, some amount of pot-stirring should be expected from a show whose tag line is \"embrace debate.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T03:22:10.007+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
