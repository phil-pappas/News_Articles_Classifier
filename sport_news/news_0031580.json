Wazzu's season has already featured a shocking 24-17 season-opening loss to FCS foe Portland State, a late rally to top Rutgers 37-34 on the road and a closer-than-expected 34-28 loss at Cal. Then came Saturday, where the Cougars stunned Oregon 45-38 in double-overtime. WSU currently rank ninth in the Pac-12 in both scoring offense (31.6 points per game) and scoring defense (28.8 points allowed per game) and, as expected, leads the conference in passing offense (396.5 yards per game) thanks to Mike Leach's Air Raid system.\nStar power: Cougars quarterback Luke Falk leads the Pac-12 in passing, racking up 392.8 yards per game while tossing 15 touchdowns compared to just two interceptions. Gabe Marks also ranks first in the league in receptions (8.6 per game) and second in yards (105 per game) and has corralled five touchdowns. Fellow receivers Dom Williams (73.6 yards per game) and River Cracraft (71 yards per game) are also ranked in the top 10 in the league. Jeremiah Allison is Wazzu's leading tackler (45) and has also tallied four tackles for loss, 0.5 sacks, one interception, one pass breakup and one quarterback hurry. Peyton Pelluer (43 tackles, 4.5 for loss, one forced fumble, one fumble recovery, one pass breakup, one quarterback hurry) and Shalom Luani (35 tackles, two forced fumbles, one interception, two pass breakups) have also been playmakers.\nDid you know: Falk's original coming out party came against the Beavers last season, as he threw for 471 yards and five touchdowns in his first-career start after former star Connor Halliday broke his ankle.\nThreat level (1-5 scale): 3. After showing signs of growth, even in losses, OSU's rebuild took a major step back in being throttled 44-7 at Arizona on Saturday. Now, the Beavers must quickly respond in one of the Pac-12's trickiest road environments. The Cougars are beatable, but not if the Beavers' offense can't find traction and the defense can't stop missing tackles in space and allowing explosive plays in the secondary.\nEarly prediction: Washington State 31, OSU 23\n-- Gina Mizell | @ginamizell", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/ginamizell"], "published": "2015-10-12T14:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T18:07:22.207+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
