Reid said that preliminary reports indicated that Charles tore his ACL during the game.\nAccording to ESPN's Adam Schefter, the MRI confirmed the initial diagnosis. Charles tore his ACL in his right knee.\nMRI confirmed Jamaal Charles tore his ACL, per source.\n— Adam Schefter (@AdamSchefter) October 12, 2015 The injury was suffered during the third quarter when Charles tried to cut to his left behind the line of scrimmage . Charles wasn't touched, but he went down when his knee appeared to buckle.\nAfter being tended to on the field, Charles was helped off the field and into the locker room.\nJamaal Charles went down with a no-contact injury to his leg pic.twitter.com/yB5hQlLXzb \n— The Cauldron (@TheCauldron) October 11, 2015 Once Charles exited the game, the Chiefs' offense failed to get anything going against the Bears, getting shut out for the remainder of the game. The Chiefs ended up dropping the game, falling to 1-4 on the season. Now, with Charles out for the remainder of the season, the Chiefs don't appear to be heading anywhere.\nOn Sunday, Charcandrick West filled in for Charles, carrying the ball seven times for 31 yards. Moving forward, backup running back Knile Davis should also be expected to contribute. But since entering the league in 2013, Davis has averaged just 3.4 yards per carry. The Chiefs could also opt to get De'Anthony Thomas involved in the running game.\nThe injury is bad news for the Chiefs, but it might be even worse news for Charles. This is the second time since 2011 that Charles has suffered a torn ACL, though the last tear occured in his left knee. After tearing his ACL in 2011, Charles rebounded by rushing for over 1,500 yards in 2012. In his five games played in 2015, Charles averaged more than 5 yards per carry. \nBut when Charles returns in 2016, he'll be a 29-year-old running back coming off the second ACL tear of his career. An MRI reportedly confirmed that Charles tore his ACL.
