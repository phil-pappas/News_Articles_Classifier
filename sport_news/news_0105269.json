This enables the user to ride a bicycle for exercise indoors, which ensures that you can work out, even during inclement weather. The unit promotes health and physical activity. In addition, it can be used by children for imaginative play and exercise.\nThe original design was submitted to the Long Island office of InventHelp. It is currently available for licensing or sale to manufacturers or marketers.
