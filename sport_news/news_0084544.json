These kids wanted it. They earned it, they played their tails off and they won by one,” Jeff head coach Alfonzo Browning said. \nThe Red Devils (6-4) will travel to Class 6A No. 1 Center Grove for next Friday’s Sectional 8 title game. The Trojans won at Columbus North 34-7 in Friday’s other semifinal. \nJeff received some inspiration from a dramatic goal-line stand by its defense with less than five minutes remaining in regulation. \nOn third-and-goal at the Red Devil 11-yard line with New Albany leading 34-28, Bulldog sophomore Rondale Moore appeared to get the ball inside the left pylon of the end zone on a sweep, which would have put New Albany up 12 points. But the officials ruled that Moore did not break the plane of the end zone, setting up a fourth-and-goal inside the Jeff 1. \nBulldog head coach Sean Coultis disagreed with the call, believing that Moore scored. \n“You don’t want to say the game came down to one play, but geez,” Coultis said. “We’re up by a touchdown with [five] minutes to go and Rondale Moore stays inbounds and hits the pylon with the ball and it’s a touchdown. I don’t want to stay that we got cheated, but geez. That’s a tough call and a tough play. I don’t sit there and blame it on that, but if we score on that, we win the game — I guarantee it. I know Rondale scored. I know he hit that pylon.” \nBulldog running back Darquan Richardson tried to go up the middle for a score, but the Red Devil defense stopped in short of the goal line. \nWith the ball still at the Red Devil 1, Northern and the Jeff offense used 12 plays to move the ball 92 yards to the its own 9. On second-and-5, Northern looked for an open receiver in the pocket, but was unsuccessful. He then tucked the ball under his arm and ran left. \nWhile carrying multiple New Albany tacklers on his back and a couple friendly pushes by his teammates, Northern got into the end zone with 33 seconds left to put Jeff up one point. \n“I got my teammates pushing me in. Everybody was pulling and yanking, but we got in there. We won the game and that’s all that matters,” Northern said. “Our team has come from behind all year. We’re resilient. Coach has told us that all year that we’ve got to stay resilient, no matter the situation. We’ve been down multiple times, and we’ve always tried to find a way to come back and never give up.” \nThe Bulldogs tried to mount a game-winning drive of their own. But on third-and-2 at the Jeff 49, New Albany freshman quarterback Dylan Clark had a deep pass intended to wide receiver Davin Alexander intercepted with four ticks remaining. \nAt halftime, Browning expressed his displeasure to his players on their first-half performance. But he was very proud with how the Red Devils fought hard in the second half. \n“Yes, I was frustrated and I laid into them and let them know,” Browning said. “I told them what needed to be done and they responded. It’s a credit to these kids from Jeff High.” \nThe Bulldogs started the game with a 14-play, 79-yard drive that chewed up the first 7 minutes and 24 seconds of the contest. \nOn fourth down with the ball at one-half yard line, Richardson ran the ball into the end zone to put New Albany up 6-0. Sophomore place-kicker Matheo Urrego-Gutierrez missed the extra point to keep the Bulldogs up six. \nThe Red Devils fired back with a quick four-play scoring drive to put them 7-6. Jeff running back Jordan Barnett made a first-down run for 25 yards to get the ball in Bulldog territory. Barnett got the ball on the next play and raced 35 yards for a score with 3:56 remaining in the first quarter. \nNew Albany got the lead back a little more than a minute later. Clark found Moore on a 7-yard TD pass to give the Bulldogs a 13-7. \nJeff then fumbled the ensuing kickoff as New Albany recovered the ball at the Red Devil 33. Three plays later, Richardson produced a 23-yard touchdown run with 1:50 left to extend the Bulldogs’ lead to 20-7. \nThe Red Devils pulled to within six again with 19 seconds left in the opening quarter on Barnett’s 2-yard TD run. \nAt the 5:12 mark of the second quarter, Moore had a 12-yard touchdown scamper on a sweep to increase New Albany’s advantage to 27-14. It capped off a 46-yard drive where the Bulldogs took advantage of the Red Devils’ second fumble on the first half as Northern failed to catch a snap in the shotgun formation. \nJeff began the third quarter with an 11-play, 65-yard series that ended with Barnett making a 4-yard TD run to slice the Red Devils’ deficit to 27-21 with 7:31 left in the period. \nThe Bulldogs responded with another long scoring drive. Richardson concluded a nine-play, 72-yard possession when he had a 9-yard TD run at the 2:48 mark of the third to put New Albany back up two scores at 34-21. \nBut the Red Devils quickly got back to within six when Barnett had his fourth touchdown run of the night from 10 yards out with 1:19 remaining in the third to trim the Bulldog lead to 34-28. \nDespite the setback, New Albany still leads the all-time series, 49-38-5. The Red Devils are 6-3 versus the Bulldogs in postseason games. \n“I hope this loss hurts,” Coultis said. “I hope these kids come out in the offseason and work that much harder to never feel this way again.” \nCLASS 6A SECTIONAL 8 \nJEFFERSONVILLE 35, NEW ALBANY 34 \nJeffersonville 14 0 14 7—35 \nNew Albany 20 7 7 0—34 \nSCORING SUMMARY \nN — Darquan Richardson 1 run (kick failed), 4:36. \nJ — Jordan Barnett 35 run (Jordan Khan kick), 3:56. \nN — Rondale Moore 7 pass from Dylan Clark (Matheo Urrego-Gutierrez kick), 2:48. \nN — Richardson 23 run (Urrego-Gutierrez kick), 1:50. \nJ — Barnett 2 run (Khan kick), :19. \nSecond quarter \nN — Moore 12 run (Urrego-Gutierrez kick), 5:12. \nThird quarter \nJ — Barnett 4 run (Khan kick), 7:31. \nN — Richardson 9 run (Urrego-Gutierrez kick), 2:48. \nJ — Barnett 10 run (Khan kick), 1:19. \nFourth quarter \nJ — Cam Northern 9 run (Khan kick), :33. \nkevin.harris@newsandtribune.com With your existing account from... {* loginWidget *}", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T06:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T12:33:01.030+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
