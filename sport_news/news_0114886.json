They play in one of the NHL's toughest divisions, and every point could make a difference at the end of the year. \nThe 32-year-old Keith, a two-time Olympic gold medallist with Team Canada, has led Chicago in average ice time for 10 consecutive seasons. \n\"Obviously, you look at a guy like Duncs, he can be arguably maybe the most valuable guy on the team with what he brings to the table,\" forward Patrick Kane said. \nKeith is likely headed for long-term injured reserve, giving the Blackhawks some cap relief. Lubomir Visnovsky, a veteran defenceman who was with the team during training camp, could be brought back, or they could promote Ville Pokka or another defenceman from the minors. \nDavid Rundblad and Viktor Svedberg likely will see more ice time with Keith out, and Michal Rozsival could return next month from long-term injured reserve. \n\"A lot of defencemen are going to get a lot more responsibility, quality enhanced in their ice time as well,\" Quenneville said. \"I don't think we want to change our style of play, but at the same time we want to make sure that we're tight.\" E-mail this Article Print this Article", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T05:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T00:26:17.388+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
