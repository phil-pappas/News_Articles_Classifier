(Associated Press File Photo) UConn-BC football series starts next season. \nWhat has been discussed for some time is about to reach fruition. \nSources have confirmed UConn and Boston College will meet in football in 2016 and 2017 and again in 2022 and 2023. There also will be a four-game series with UMass to complete an eight-game series with the two FBS schools in Massachusetts. \nUConn officials wouldn't confirm or deny the schedule Tuesday, and sports information department spokesman Mike Enright said the school wouldn't comment until contracts are signed. UConn athletic director Warde Manuel and Boston College AD Brad Bates have been working for a while to get a series going. \n\"As employees we can't speak about contracts that aren't executed, but I will say like I've said in the past, to play regional teams is awesome,\" UConn coach Bob Diaco said. \"As many times as we can play a Syracuse, Boston College, Pitt, West Virginia, Penn State, Rutgers, Maryland, these are great games for our fans and for our team and for our university community to play in. It's exciting.\" \nThe resumption of the Boston College-UConn series was first reported by ajerseyguy.com. \nUConn will play at Boston College Nov. 19, 2016; Boston College comes to Rentschler Field Nov. 18, 2017. \nUConn will play UMass at home in 2018 and 2020, and will play the Minutemen at Gillette Stadium in Foxborough, Mass, home of the New England Patriots, in 2019 and 2021 before UConn and Boston College resume. \nUConn has not played Boston College since Sept. 17, 2004 when the Eagles won 27-7 at home. BC leads the series 10-0-2. UConn last played UMass in 2012, winning 37-0. The former Yankee Conference rivals first played in 1897. UMass leads the series 36-34-2. \nIn June Bates and Manuel talked about rekindling the rivalry. \n\"Warde Manuel and I are really good friends,\" Bates said. \"We've known each other for a long time, so could that possibly happen at some point in time? I'm sure at some point in time it probably will be something that's discussed. Whether it will happen in the near future or not, I can't tell you.\" \nSaid Manuel: \"Because I have known Brad a long time and we are friends, he knows I would play them in any sport at any time, and I'd love to play them in football. I think it's something that would be good for both our fan bases and the region for football, but Connecticut is not holding up whether or not we play.\" \nWhen BC said it was leaving the Big East, UConn was a vocal opponent. Attorney General Richard Blumenthal filed a lawsuit in 2003, naming BC AD Gene DeFilippo and ACC commissioner John Swofford. That led to some hard feelings. The Boston Globe reported BC was \"fuming over what it perceived to be vitriolic comments\" made by people associated with UConn. \nThe lawsuit alleged BC and DeFilippo engaged in a \"secret scheme'' with Miami and the Atlantic Coast Conference, \"undertaken with the full knowledge and intent of severely weakening, if not destroying'' the Big East. Blumenthal characterized DeFilippo's actions as \"reprehensible.'' \nBC had little use for UConn before that final football game in 2004. When asked if he could see the teams playing at some point, BC coach Tom O'Brien said, ``I don't see it happening. There's no reason to play someone who sues us. A lot of hard feelings have come from UConn toward us. Why would want we to play them?\" \nUConn coach Randy Edsall went a different route, saying at Big East media day in July 2004, ``Time heals all wounds. Would I say the game would never be played again? I would never say never. When the dust settles, people might think that it's something that's good for New England.'' \nEleven years later the mess has cleared, the dust has settled. \nThis is what the eight-game series looks like: \n2016: UConn at BC (Nov. 19) \n2017: BC at UConn (Nov. 18) \n2018: UMass at UConn \n2019: UConn at UMass, Gillette Stadium \n2020: UMass at UConn \n2021: UConn at UMass, Gillette Stadium \n2022: UConn at BC", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T21:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T21:32:13.964+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
