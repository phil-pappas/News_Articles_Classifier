The Colts won 41-17. Indianapolis Colts quarterback Andrew Luck was limited in practice for the second consecutive day Thursday, according to Zak Keefer of the Indy Star .\nAdChoices What It Means:\nLuck is dealing with a sore right shoulder he suffered in Week 3. The injury report won't come out until Friday, but Luck will probably go down as questionable after not having thrown a pass in front of the media either Wednesday or Thursday.\nA potential injury could explain Luck's immense struggles. He's currently 16th in Passing Net Expected Points (NEP) at 9.76, between the New Orleans Saints' Luke McCown and the Cleveland Browns' Johnny Manziel. Our projections see Luck throwing for 308 yards on 44 attempts (7.00 yards per attempt) with 2.04 touchdowns and 1.03 interceptions on Sunday.\nSource: Zak Keefer, Indy Star\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.indystar.com/story/sports/nfl/colts/2015/10/01/andrew-luck-injury-update-indianapolis-colts/73146122/", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-10-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T00:54:21.949+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
