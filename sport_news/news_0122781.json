That's really how I feel about that. That's the front five, that's the backs, that's the receivers, that's the tights, that's all of us together, and it's just a reflection of our effort and preparation. So I just happen to be the guy who's name's on it, but that's all of us.\" \nMcCown completed 36 of his 51 throws for 457 yards and two touchdowns in the win over the Ravens. The 457 yards were a single-game franchise record, surpassing the previous mark of 444 collected by Brian Sipe against the Baltimore Colts on October 25, 1981. \n\"First off, I'm happy for him,\" Broncos coach Gary Kubiak said of McCown. \"Obviously, I think the world of him. He's been battling for years in this league, and then, to get this great opportunity and take advantage of it, that's what this league is all about. (I'm) very impressed. I have got a lot of respect for him. What he did last week going into Baltimore, I know how tough that is having been there last year, so he's doing a great job.\" \nMcCown, the first Browns quarterback to have three straight 300-yard passing performances, has increased his passing yardage totals in each of the last three weeks, and his 1,154 combined yards between starts against the Oakland Raiders, San Diego Chargers and Ravens are the most in a three-game stretch by any quarterback in Browns history. \nBut more than anything, McCown was happy to briefly celebrate the accomplishment with his teammates before the Browns got to work on the Broncos. \n\"That's what's really been the coolest part,\" McCown said. \"I guess I didn't fully understand the scope of the last time these guys beat the Ravens and all those things. I think more over the last few days, I've been able to talk with guys about that and talk with Joe (Thomas) and guys that have been around here a while and really internalize that and, absolutely, appreciate it a little bit more. Again, you do that to a point, but then, it's time to move on and that's where we're at now.\" \nAlthough McCown was quick to deflect any of the success, Pettine knows the individual statistics came as a result of his quarterback's practice habits, which he expects to continue as the Browns prepare to take on the league's top-ranked defense. \n\"He is very prepared,\" Pettine said. \"He understands when a play gets called, the play from A to Z. He understands it well, the formation, who needs to be where, the timing of any particular motion, the spacing of the wide receivers and then, what the read is. If the route is built to where we have a blitz-beater on one side and a zone-beater on the other, he can recognize a defense. \n\"He is decisive. The throws that he has made for the most part have been extremely accurate. If you are going to have a quarterback play that well, you have to be doing something good around him. For the most part, we protected well on that many pass attempts. \n\"I know we gave up some hits and some sacks, but I think overall, the protection was there certainly when we needed it. We ran good routes. The receivers were where they were supposed to be and caught the football and we broke tackles and got some positive yards. I just think he has a great understanding and a great command of what we are doing. When you are accurate and on time on top of that, you are going to get those types of results.\" 1 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://on.wkyc.com/1LvMNb1 TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T18:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T20:16:45.024+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
