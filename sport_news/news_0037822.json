File Photo by Brian Achenbach/Special to the Tribune By Cody Goodwin cgoodwin@amestrib.com \nSix local high school football teams are vying for playoff positioning as the regular season draws to a close on Friday. \nSome schools will be playing for outright district titles while others will be competing for that lucrative fourth-place finish to qualify for the postseason. \nThe Ames Tribune looks at the scenarios for each of the local teams in playoff contention. \nAmes: 3-5 overall, 2-2 in Class 4A District 1 \nThe Little Cyclones play at Council Bluffs Thomas Jefferson on Friday in their season finale. \nA win there would secure Ames’ spot as the third-place team in its district, meaning the Little Cyclones would draw a second-place team from another district in the first round of the state playoffs. \nA loss would force tiebreakers to decide who finishes third and fourth. \nIf Ames loses, and Des Moines East beats Sioux City North, Ames still would qualify as the third-place team, no matter the scores of the games, based on the 13-point tiebreaker rule set forth by the Iowa High School Athletic Association. \nIf Ames loses, and Des Moines East loses to Sioux City North, the Little Cyclones would qualify as the fourth-place team behind Council Bluffs Thomas Jefferson. \nIn that scenario, both teams would finish with 2-3 records, and the Jackets would own the head-to-head over the Little Cyclones. \nGilbert: 7-1 overall, 5-0 in Class 3A District 6 \nGilbert enters Friday night’s game as the top seed from the district in the playoffs. Nothing can change that. \nWin on Friday, and the Tigers will claim an outright, undefeated district title. Lose, and the only team that could match their 5-1 record is Ballard, who the Tigers beat head-to-head on Sept. 19, giving them the advantage. \nBallard: 5-3 overall, 4-1 in Class 3A District 6 \nIf Ballard beats Grinnell on Friday, it will finish second in the district at 5-1 and host a first-round playoff game. \nBut if the Bombers lose, tie-breaking scenarios would come into play. If Ballard loses and Gilbert loses, there would be three teams tied at 4-2 in the district, and the Bombers could potentially play a road game to open the postseason. \nColo-NESCO: 7-1 overall, 4-1 in Class 8 District 5 \nThe Royals are going to the playoffs, but a win on Friday will allow them to host a first-round playoff game. Colo-NESCO plays at HLV, which is also 4-1 in district play. The winner will finish second behind Don Bosco in the district. \nRoland-Story: 3-4 overall, 2-3 in Class 2A District 6 \nThe Norsemen’s goal is simple: win, and they’re in. On Friday, Roland-Story plays at Iowa Falls-Alden, a school with an identical 2-3 district record. The winner will be 3-3 and finish fourth in the district. \nCollins-Maxwell-Baxter: 5-3 overall, 2-3 in Class 2A District 7 \nThe Raiders’ goal is just like Roland-Story’s: win to get into the postseason. CMB plays at Centerville on Friday, and the Big Reds are also 2-3 in district play. The winner will finish fourth in the district, and secure a trip to the playoffs. \nNevada and South Hamilton are both out of contention for the playoffs. The Cubs play at Newton on Friday, while the Hawks host St. Edmond. Rules for posting comments \nComments posted below are from readers.
