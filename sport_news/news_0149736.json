The Warriors defeated the Clippers 121-104. Mandatory Credit: Kyle Terada-USA TODAY Sports Just when it looked like the Golden State Warriors were going to ignore Los Angeles Clippers head coach Doc Rivers' comments about their championship run being lucky, Klay Thompson decided to respond and lash back at the Clippers.\nAdChoices \"That sounds pretty bitter to me,\" Thompson told ESPN.com . \"If we got lucky, look at our record against them last year. I'm pretty sure we smacked them.\"\nThe Warriors won the season series with the Clippers decisively, 3-1.\nThe Clippers had a chance to meet the Warriors in the Western Conference finals, but blew a 3-1 series lead against the Houston Rockets, who then lost to the Warriors in five games.\nRivers suggested that the Warriors got lucky on their way to the NBA Finals because they didn’t have to play the Clippers or the San Antonio Spurs, the two perceived biggest threats to the Dubs in the West.\n\"Didn't they lose to the Rockets?\" Thompson said. \"So that just makes me laugh. That's funny. Weren't they up 3-1, too? Tell them I said that, too.\"\nThe Warriors also released their promotional schedule for the 2015-16 season, and what do you know, they're giving their fans replica championship rings on Nov. 4 , their first matchup with the Clippers.\nGolden State receives its actual championship rings on Oct. 27 in the season-opener against the New Orleans Pelicans -- so it'd be logical to give away replica championship rings on that night, too -- but it appears as if the team wants to rub it in the face of their southern California rival.\nThe bad blood between the Clippers and Warriors is only going to continue, spilling over into this season now. While the rivalry tamed down a bit in the second half of last season, and with the teams failing to meet again in the playoffs, this could be the spark that the matchup needed.\n\"I wanted to play the Clippers last year, but they couldn't handle their business,” Thompson said.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.warriorsworld.net/2015/10/09/warriors-news-warriors-giveaway-replica-rings/", "http://espn.go.com/nba/story/_/id/13847512/klay-thompson-golden-state-warriors-says-losangeles-clippers-handle-their-business-last-year", "http://www.foxsports.com/", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "http://www.foxsports.com/nba/story/golden-state-warriors-los-angeles-clippers-san-antonio-spurs-doc-rivers-lucky-playoffs-100815"], "published": "2015-10-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T14:21:33.124+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
