Nick Penn took the opening kickoff 89 yards for a touchdown to give United (6-1, 4-2 LTC) a 7-0 lead. Mid-County responded to tie the game but the Red Storm defense would go on to force a turnover on downs, then pick up a fumble inside the Mid-County 20 to give the offense a short field. Alfred Mono punched in a 12 yard touchdown run but the Cougars would respond again tie the game 14-14 at the half. United's second fumble recovery came on the first possession of the second half, once again in Mid-County territory, and was followed by Mono's second touchdown carry. Penn came up with another big play in the form of a 70 yard interception return to extend the United advantage to 28-14. Mid-County (4-3, 2-3 LTC) kept the pressure on with a score but after a blocked extra point United got a big play eerily similar to what keyed the Red Storm's win over Princeville in Week 6. Eli Olin hit Derek Hart for a 21 yard TD pass on 4th and 4 to make it 35-20. Though the Cougars would score again the second blocked extra point of the contest kept United leading by two scores with less than seven minutes play. Mono's third score of the game, a 61 yard scamper, came at the 2:55 mark of the final period and put the game away. United now faces Stark County in Week 8 with a chance to tie for the Lincoln Trail Conference lead. The Rebels beat West Central 50-0 on Friday.
