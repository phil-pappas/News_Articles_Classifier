Interestingly, the Grade 6 student had come on a family holiday to Varna before he decided to compete in the event.\n\"We had come to Varna for a family holiday as my mom is a Bulgarian and just when we were about to leave we heard about this competition and thought of participating in it. This is my first big win outside my country. I think I played really well and I am very happy to win here as my grandfather loves golf very much. He will be really excited to see me holding the winning trophy,\" Brown said. Brown picked up a club at the age of five and has been practicing since at the Nick Faldo-designed Elea Estate course in Paphos in his quest to become the best golfer in the world in future.\n\"I don't want to just play on holidays (laughs). But I want to play hard and do well in the sport. I want to show the people that it's a very fun game and I want to become someone like Rory (McIlroy) when I get older - win Majors like him and become World No. 1. I want to be the best golfer in history,\" he said with a smile.\nBrown also got the opportunity to get valuable tips from two-time Challenge Tour winner Kapur during the event. \"He (Shiv) gave me two very good tips. When there's a hill going down in front of you, always move your shoulders to the left. It will be easier to strike the ball. And if the elevation is high, move your shoulders to the right. So you can strike any length as you shorten the club,\" he signed off.\nFollow TOI Sports on Twitter >> @TOISportsNews ", "external_links": ["https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.toi.reader.activities", "https://twitter.com/TOISportsNews"], "published": "2015-09-05T18:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T05:31:04.687+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
