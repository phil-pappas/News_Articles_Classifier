I told them that we can't rush it. We need to be smart and use the block to our advantage.\" \n\"I think we need to carry over techniques we learn in practice,\" said senior Captain Izzie Marsico. \"We will become a much stronger team if we play how we practice.\" \nThe Vikings served 15 aces in the contest to Tech's three with Logan Shuttleworth picking up eight for the Lady Vikings. \n\"Our serving was inconsistent during the first two sets. We gave them some free points in those sets,\" said Coupe. \"They are a strong team, and you can't give a strong team free points.\" \nLogan Shuttleworth tallied 20 assists in the contest. \n\"The more times Logan gets on the court, she's getting better and better,\" said Coupe. \nAlison Palmer, Marsico, Abbey E'Nama, Cameron Wick, Taylor Collier and Shuttleworth teamed for 24 kills in the match. \nKira Vitella made eight digs for the libero position while Brittany Duvall added seven. Palmer, Shuttleworth, E'Nama, Marsico and Collier all had a good defensive match. \nBoth teams wore something pink to support Breast Cancer Awareness Month. \nThe junior varsity squad fell to the Ravens JV 0-2, moving their record to 4-2 on the season. \nCape travels to Red Lion Tuesday, Oct. 6, for a matchup with the Lions.
