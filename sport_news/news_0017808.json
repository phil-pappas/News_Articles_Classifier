Exeter High School had the golf team to challenge for a state title. It just didn’t come together Thursday at tricky Hanover Country Club. “Not disappointed. I think it’s just — it’s probably my last competitive match,” Mello said, moments after the awards ceremony. “But it was good. I had a good four years in this program. I couldn’t have asked for anything more.” The second-seeded Blue Hawks settled for a three-way tie for sixth place at the Division I golf championships, struggling with Hanover’s tucked pins and slick greens. Junior Steven Schnobrich (80) and senior co-captain Rob Walmsley (83) were the only Blue Hawks to make the cut for Saturday’s individual finale — which saw Bishop Guertin’s Tom Ethier rally from six shots back to overtake defending champion Ryan Quinn (Winnacunnet) and runner-up Brandon Gillis (Nashua North). Schnobrich hoped to be in contention on Saturday, but he entered the final 18-hole round 10 strokes off the leader. “It was just the greens,” he said. “I hit it with my other clubs pretty well. It was just putting absolutely killed me.” Schnobrich came back with an 84 Saturday for a two-day score of 164. Walmsley, citing similar struggles with the greens, shot 85 for a score of 168. “I put the ball on the fairway, I hit a fair amount of greens, but the putting just wasn’t there,” Walmsley said after Thursday’s round. “I think I had three three-putts in a row at one point. I hit the ball better than an 83.” Top-seeded Bedford carded two rounds in the high 70s and hoisted the championship with a team score of 400. It was followed in the top five by runner-up BG (402), Keene (403), Manchester Memorial (421) and Winnacunnet (421), which got a low-medalist round of 70 from Quinn and an 82 from Ryan Moskevich. BG’s Ethier, after shooting 76 on Thursday, came back with a 70 on Saturday to steal away the individual state title. “That’s good for no matter what the conditions were,” Schnobrich said of that number. “Hopefully next year I can be in that conversation. That’s the goal.” The Blue Hawks (422) had greater goals Thursday after polishing off a 17-3 regular season, the school’s best in recent memory. That included a stellar team score of 181 in their Sept. 3 home opener at Exeter Country Club. “The season says a lot,” Mello said. “This last match here — you could have your worst day of the year here. It’s 18 holes, so that adds another factor to it. But no excuses. We did what we did, we shot what we shot, but we had a great season and nobody can deny that.” Exeter senior Jameson Pearson was just off the cut at 85. Zach Lovejoy (86) and Mello (88) were the other team scorers with Schnobrich and Walmsley. “It’s a good course,” said Exeter coach Bob Bailey, who grew up across the river and honed his own golf game at Hanover CC. “You’ve got to hit shots. You just can’t smash it and stuff like that. “I just said to the kids: Hey, you’re the only one that’s going to be able to tell yourself when you get back on the bus ‘Did I give 100 percent?’ And if you did, your score’s what it is.” What the Blue Hawks did this season was bring their golf program to new heights, doing so without a “ringer” at the front of their lineup. The fun part about a roster that included Riley Green, Andrew Crist and Bryce Dawson was that every player was capable of a low round; the question was who it would come from. “We had a lot of seniors,” Walmsley said. “Fun season. We’re a competitive team. We compete with each other so we get better. I think that’s the biggest thing that helped us.” Schnobrich, who played in the first group for Exeter on Thursday, will be the leader of a new-look varsity team next fall. The JV team was strong again this season after winning the state title in 2014. “With some work over the offseason he could be as good as the top in the state,” Mello said of his teammate. “He was a sophomore last year and made the cut. He made the cut again this year as a junior. There’s only room for improvement. So I think he’ll definitely be a contender.” Either way, next year’s group will have a tough act to follow. “Having 12 kids who have been with me for four years, three years some of them, I mean, it’s going to be sad to see them go,” Bailey said, “but it’s glad to see them have such a good year their senior year. I’m really happy for them.” By Ryan O’Leary", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T20:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T23:35:29.880+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
