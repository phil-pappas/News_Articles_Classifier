He's the FBS active career leader in five categories including yardage (10,509), passing TDs (87) and completion percentage (68.4).\nDoughty, described by LSU coach Les Miles as \"every bit an SEC quarterback,\" is a pocket passer. He's a completely different challenge than Neal and his fellow D-linemen faced last Saturday when they chased scrambling Florida QB Treon Jones all over the Tiger Stadium turf.\n\"It was fun to me,\" said Neal, who earned SEC Defensive Player of the Week honors for his 10 tackles, 3½ sacks and 3 quarterback hurries in the Tigers' 35-28 victory over the Gators. \"But it bothers me that I missed making four other sacks.\"\nNeal had four tackles on Florida's first eight snaps of the game. He got double-teamed the rest of the night and he'll probably get some of that from the Hilltoppers.\n\"When you've got a pocket quarterback, all you need to do is win 1-on-1 matchups and affect his throwing arm,\" Neal said.\nLSU safety Jalen Mills, who returned to action vs. the Gators after a broken fibula sidelined him for the season's first five games, said pocket QBs have their strengths and weaknesses.\n\"If you have a guy who is going to stay in the pocket, you get your front guys to go after him and we just cover on the back end.\n\"Because he's a pocket guy, most likely he's a gunslinger who can throw the ball vertically. This is something this guy does very well.\"\nLSU's offense will have to help its defense, not just by scoring, but mixing quick strike TDs with clock-consuming drives. Since Western Kentucky is ranked 103 rd among 127 FBS schools in total defense allowing 438.1 yards per game, the Tigers and FBS rushing leader Leonard Fournette have a good chance of controlling the pace.\nThe danger about this matchup is LSU, which has an open date next Saturday before its Nov. 7 showdown at once-beaten No. 8 Alabama, has everything to lose. Western Kentucky doesn't since the Hilltoppers are a 16½-point underdog.\n\"Anytime you get a chance to play a team this good, on their home turf, for us, it's just a great opportunity to go out there, compete, have fun and just really see how we measure up,\" Western Kentucky coach Jeff Brohm said.\n\"LSU is a proven team. Everyone knows that. I want our guys to relax and play. Whatever happens after that, I'm fine with it. I don't want our guys to feel like they have to do more than they normally do when they go out there.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T16:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T17:33:10.315+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
