They've got some good kids and they kept coming after us and after us and after us, and they made it a tough game. They gave us all we could handle.\"\nSlender senior wide receiver Samson Nacua , who broke free for a 66-yard touchdown reception in the first quarter, hauled in another TD toss from senior quarterback Kahi Neves , this one from 22 yards away with 1:44 to play, to give the T-Birds a 28-14 lead and pretty much put it just out of Corner Canyon's reach.\n\"The safeties dropped back and I was telling (Neves) right before the play, 'You've got to throw me the ball right here and I'll make a play out of it. We've got to get our momentum going, so just give me the ball,'\" Nacua said of his first TD catch.\n\"Then I broke the first tackle and I was just running and I saw the safety come after me and I thought, 'Oh, dude, he's gonna catch me,\" and then I tried jumping up and he barely missed me and I just walked into the end zone.\"\nAsten Aspinall scored Timpview's second touchdown, powering in from a yard out on the first play of the second quarter, to make it 14-0. Then midway through the third quarter, Neves found Fielding Wallace behind the Chargers' defense for a picture-perfect 58-yard touchdown pass and a 21-0 lead.\nNacua admitted the T-Birds let up a bit after building a 21-point lead.\n\"We got too comfortable and they started coming back, and we had to pick our momentum up,\" he said. \"We can't let that happen.\n\"Our defense was doing really good. They held 'em really good; they blocked kicks and field goals, and they did really good.\"\nCorner Canyon wouldn't quit, battling back when Jason Adams bounced around the left side on a 10-yard touchdown burst, followed by Wilson's 12-yard TD pass to Chase Meyer that made it 21-14 with 7:31 remaining to play.\nBut Nacua's second TD catch made it 28-14, and Wilson's 15-yard scoring strike to Braxton Coon could only pull the Chargers within 28-20 with 1:01 to go before Timpview got the ball back and ran out the clock.\n\"He had some very good moments there,\" Whittingham said of Nacua. \"He's been that way for us all season, and we expect that out of him and we need that out of him.\n\"The defense hung in there ... we just didn't play real well and that was the big difference there. We've still got some things we need to take care of. There's some things, obviously, we still need to take care of. We've got to address some penalty issues, we've got to address some coverage issues, technique for that coverage, and we've got to address some assignments as well.\n\"We've got a short week and we've got to get ready for Mountain View and move on from there,\" the Thunderbirds' coach said.\nEMAIL: rhollis@desnews.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T16:48:15.362+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
