Well, everyone but the team’s head coach, that is.\nJason Negro’s job is to keep his kids from talking about how good they are, and keep them focused on how good they can be at the end of the year.\nIt’s not too tall a challenge, however.\n“It’s not hard. Our guys have a lot of pride,” he says. “That’s a really good thing, because they know how hard they have to work every day.”The hard work has paid off so far. The Braves (7-0, 2-0) walked into the Santa Ana Bowl last week ranked No. 2 in the CIF Southern Section’s powerhouse Pac-5 Division. Their opponent was the Mater Dei Monarchs, ranked No. 3 in the Pac-5. All Bosco did was dominate the game and take a 42-0 lead, eventually beating the Monarchs with a running clock.\nNot surprisingly, this week the Braves are ranked No. 2 in the nation by both MaxPreps.com and USA Today. Both polls have them behind only Bishop Gorman of Las Vegas.\nAfter a start that has seen them outscore opponents 424-88, the Braves are understandably drawing comparisons to their 2013 team that won the national title.\nOne Brave thinks those comparisons are fair.\n“I definitely think you can compare this team to 2013,” said running back Sean McGrew, who was a starter as a sophomore on that championship team. “We have an offense where anyone can step up this year.”\nThe Braves will host JSerra this week at Cerritos College. For now, that’s all Negro is interested in discussing.\n“We’re trying to go 1-0 this week against JSerra. That’s the goal right now,” he said. Avalon rising\nThere is one other undefeated high school powerhouse in the Press-Telegram area, although in a considerably lower division. The Avalon Lancers improved to 6-0 last week with an 81-6 victory over Laverne Lutheran, and have outscored opponents 407-18 this year. The Lancers are ranked No. 2 in the CIF-SS’ 8-man Division 1 poll.\nJose Silva is leading the team with 626 yards rushing and 12 touchdowns, backed up by seven touchdowns by Jason Campos.\n“Each week our guys are focusing on the things that each one needs to perfect,” said head coach Mike Forcella. “Our goal is to have a perfect game.”\nThe Lancers have two more regular-season games and will visit St. Michael’s Prep on Friday afternoon.\nUndefeated Vikings\nAt the JC level, the city plays host to yet another undefeated powerhouse. Long Beach City College improved to 7-0 on Saturday with a 52-40 win over Chaffey, the first time the Vikings have reached that mark since 1998.\nAdvertisement\nLBCC is ranked No. 3 in the nation by JC Gridiron and, as of Monday, is the new No. 1 team in California. The Vikings have a bye this week before visiting Riverside on Halloween for a critical showdown.\nJordan surge\nAfter an 0-4 start, Jordan has won three of its last four, including its last two games, against Cabrillo (42-21) and Millikan (65-30). It’s certainly more than most expected of the Panthers.\n“Nobody thought we were going to win any of those games,” said Jordan coach john Kane. “Nobody gave us a chance. But we knew, and I’ve been telling the kids the whole time that some scores are deceiving. When you’re losing and still get kids to come to practice and work hard, you’re doing something right.”Jordan (3-5 overall) is now right in the mix for a Moore League playoff spot at 3-1 in league. It has a bye this week before finishing with Long Beach Poly and Lakewood.\nSan Gabriel Valley League\nBoth Downey and Dominguez played two games last week, as they finished their postponed game on Wednesday afternoon before resuming a regular schedule on Friday. The Vikings defeated Lynwood and the Dons held serve against Paramount, setting up a huge game this Friday.\nThe battle for the city of Downey will happen Friday at Warren, as the Bears (6-1, 2-0) host the Vikings (4-3, 2-0). The Bears are the surprise story of the year, as Raul Lara has taken Warren from cellar-dweller to legitimate title contender in just one season. With title implications and a city rivalry at stake, Friday’s game should be as big as it gets.\nGahr will visit Paramount and Dominguez will visit Lynwood in the other SGVL games on Friday.\nSuburban League\nThere haven’t been any big surprises in the Suburban League, as La Mirada and Mayfair continue to roll along undefeated. The Matadores and Monsoons are both 4-0 in league play, with Mayfair hosting winless Glenn Friday while La Mirada enjoys a bye. The two powerhouse programs will face each other next week for the Suburban Legaue title.\nMoore League\nAction is heating up in the Moore League, with Poly still undefeated in league play, Wilson and Jordan at 3-1 (with Wilson owning a head-to-head tiebreaker), and Lakewood behind them at 2-1. The Lancers visit the Jackrabbits this Friday, while Wilson will host Millikan with a chance to clinch a playoff berth.\nAbout the Author Mike Guardabascio is an award-winning sportswriter who's been covering the Long Beach sports world since 2008.
