The Devils rushed for 250 yards. \nThat effort complemented the Port Barre defense, which limited Pine Prairie to 154 total yards. The Panthers failed to complete any of their seven passes and had a pair of throws intercepted. \nPBHS head football coach Mac Mistric said the Devils were able to combine several positive elements, which had prevented the Devils from winning their last two games. \n“We’ve now gone a bunch of minutes without allowing a touchdown. Offensively we didn’t have the turnovers that we’ve had recently. In our practices last week we really emphasized protecting the ball. \n“What we saw (against Pine Prairie) was a complete role reversal of what we saw the past couple of weeks,” Mistric said. \nThe Devils limited Pine Prairie quarterback Dylan Doucet to 90 yards. Douglas Fontenot, the Panthers’ other backfield threat, gained 24 on 10 carries. \nMistric said his team didn’t devise any special defenses that limited Pine Prairie. \n“There was nothing particular about what we did. We just tried to slow them (Doucet and Fontenot) down. We played our normal defense and with did a good job with that. \n“One of our linebackers, Matt Leger, injured his hand in practice last week, but he put a cast on it and came out there with a big club-looking thing and made 12 solo tackles,” said Mistric. \nLeger also had one of the Devils’ pass interceptions. Alex Olivier had the other pick off. \nOffensively Port Barre received a 144-yard offensive performance from running back J.J. Sylvester, who also scored twice. \nMistric said Sylvester’s return to the lineup after missing most of the last two games, was beneficial to an offense that had difficulties in last Friday night’s 6-0 overtime loss to Ville Platte. \n“(Sylvester) played three quarters (against Pine Prairie). He’s been a big part of our offense and we seem to play with more confidence when he is in the game,” said Mistric. \nThe first quarter ended scoreless, but in the second period the Devils scored early when Sylvester broke loose on a 26-yard run (11:52). \nA Terrance Lemelle two-point conversion run gave Port Barre an 8-0 lead. \nSylvester scored on a one-yard run later in the period (4:36). The extra point kick attempt failed and the Devils brought a 14-0 lead into the halftime dressing room. \nPort Barre scored on the first offensive series of the third period when Sylvester bolted over on a one-yard run. \nLanclos ended the scoring in the fourth period when he thew an 11-yard pass to Spencer Brace (5:41). \nThe Devils finished with 250 rushing yards. \nNEXT WEEK: Port Barre goes to Eunice for a 5-3A game. Pine Prairie is also involved in a league game when the Panthers go to Ville Platte. 1 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://www.dailyworld.com/story/sports/high-school/2015/10/24/port-barre-blanks-pine-prairie-first-district-win/74552696/ TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T01:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T01:19:39.154+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
