(Published Friday, Oct. 23, 2015) The pets of San Diego are back at it this week to predict who is going to win Sunday; the Chargers or the Raiders? This week NBC 7’s Vanessa Herrera put her two dogs Annabelle and Sydney to the test. Michael Ramirez and his dog Kiana played catch to see who is going to win while Lynne Sefton submitted a video all the way from England of her cat Cali trying her skills at predicting the game. We round out our pet predictions with two very special puppies looking for forever homes. Penguin and Puffin are 2 month old Labrador Retriever/Pointer blends at the Helen Woodward Animal Center. The center tells up Penguin plays Quarter Bark while Puffin is a top tier Wide Retriever. If you’re interested in adopting either Penguin or Puffin go to www.animalcenter.org or http://www.animalcenter.org/adoptions/animals.aspx?type=dogs for more information. Want us to showcase your pet next week? Take a video of you and your animal predicting the winner of the Chargers at the Ravens and email it to me at Becki.Schildhouse@NBCUNI.com before 4 p.m. Friday October 30th. You can send multiple emails if you need to. *NBC 7 will not use any videos where an animal appears to be forced to do something they don’t want to do.
