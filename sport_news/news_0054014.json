He and other residents are concerned about future noise and exhaust from trucks once the warehouse opens. , KURT MILLER, STAFF PHOTOGRAPHER Related article » PROJECTS PROPOSED Riverside officials are expected to consider several warehouse projects in the near future.\nHunter Industrial Park: The council in October will consider plans for 1.4 million square feet of warehouse space on 72.5 acres at the southeast corner of Palmyrita and Michigan avenues.\nNorthside: A 308,000-square-foot warehouse is proposed for Center Street, north of the Ab Brown Sports Complex. Residents plan to appeal if the city approves it, but no public meetings are scheduled.\nSycamore Canyon Business Park: A two-building project would encompass 1.4 million square feet of warehouse space between Dan Kipper Drive and the Sycamore Canyon Wilderness Park. Proponents are preparing an environmental report.\nWhen Riverside resident Brian Fountain opens his bedroom window, he looks out at his back fence, a temporary plywood barrier and a construction site that will become a 200,000-square-foot development of five warehouses with 23 loading docks.\nIt’s one of several projects that would add to the city’s nearly 25 million square feet of warehouse space.\nIt’s also a symbol of a growing debate over the logistics industry in the city.\nRecently, the region’s attention has focused on neighboring Moreno Valley’s plans for the World Logistics Center, a massive shipping hub expected to send more than 14,000 trucks a day onto the Inland area’s already packed highways.\nRiverside officials objected to the Center, and City Council members even authorized a lawsuit challenging the project, though they opted not to file it.\nYet, in parts of their own city, warehouses have proliferated.\nThe Sycamore Canyon Business Park, which holds 9.4 million square feet of warehouse space, has been planned for such uses since the 1980s. In the Northside neighborhood, a property owner needs only the approval of the zoning administrator to build up to 400,000 square feet of warehouse space.\nWhen the city challenges warehouse projects in other communities while supporting them at home, “We do look a little schizophrenic,” said Riverside Councilman Mike Gardner, who represents the Northside.\nHe’d like to revisit the city’s warehouses policy and look at whether plans made years ago on where they can be built and how big they can be still make sense.\nBut Councilman Mike Soubirous, who opposed suing Moreno Valley, said Riverside has had little success at stopping warehouse projects and should instead concentrate on building and improving roads to address traffic problems.\n“These things are coming, and whether it’s one at a time or little ones, they’re coming,” he said. “To come along and say ‘We’re not going to allow any more,’ I don’t think you can do that.”\nMORE WAREHOUSES\nWith the recession over, warehouse construction in Riverside is heating up again.\nIn October, the City Council will consider a plan to build about 1.4 million square feet of warehouse space in Hunter Industrial Park. It’s unlikely to provoke a clash with residents because more than 90 percent of the neighborhood is warehouses, manufacturing or office space, according to statistics from CoStar, a commercial real estate data company.\nSycamore Canyon Business Park has a similar profile, but it abuts a residential subdivision to the north – and that’s where the conflict lies.\n1 2 3 Next Page", "external_links": ["http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/twitter-ico.jpg", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/fb-ico.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nuwgqn-b88508203z.120150918181146000gccbubd7.10.jpg", "http://assets.pinterest.com/js/pinmarklet.js?r=", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nuwgqo-b88508203z.120150918181146000gpuc3mh0.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nuwgqn-b88508203z.120150918181146000gccbubd7.10.jpg", "http://s7.addthis.com/js/250/addthis_widget.js#username=YOUR-ACCOUNT-ID", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/mail-ico.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nuwgqo-b88508203z.120150918181146000gccbubdb.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nuwgqo-b88508203z.120150918181146000gpuc3mh0.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nuwgqo-b88508203z.120150918181146000gccbubdb.10.jpg"], "published": "2015-09-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T04:17:24.114+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
