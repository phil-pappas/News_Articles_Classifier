ALLISON LONG along@kcstar.com 1 of 8 \nBy Kathy Moore and Roxanne Wyss \nSpecial to The Star Order Reprint of this Story \nWherever quilters gather, good food and great recipes get stitched together. \nEula Lang, owner of Quilting Bits & Pieces in Eudora, Kan., understands the seamless connection between quilting and food — and the sense of fellowship both can foster. \nFive years ago she taught a class based on a food-themed quilt known as Grandma’s Kitchen. Designed by Lori Holt of Bee in My Bonnet, a quilting blog and pattern company in Riverton, Utah, the quilt portrays items typically found in bygone American kitchens. \nThe colorful fabric blocks feature a classic hand mixer, cast-iron skillet, cookie cutters, canning jars and crockery bowls. The quilt still hangs in the shop and remains just as popular today as it did when it was first made, in part because the images whisk you back in time, to a place where you can almost taste the cake or smell the pie as it bakes. \nMaking Grandma’s Kitchen is certainly one way to get a food fix, but quilters also use food terms to describe their craft. These days the shelves of quilt shops are stacked with Layer Cakes, Jelly Rolls, Snack Packs, Candy Squares and Honey Buns — just a few of the delicious names of pre-cut fabric squares and strips that make assembling a keepsake quilt faster and easier. \nDesigners at the fabric companies select complementary colors for each bundle, which is less expensive than buying yards of cloth and stressing over a multitude of pattern choices. \n“More young people are coming into the shop,” Lang says. “There is a trend toward faster quilting and at the same time a trend toward hand skills and more details. They start out faster, then evolve to more skills.” \nGone are the days when quilters sat in a circle and pieced by hand. Today’s quilters still gather for camaraderie, but now they meet in busy rooms strung with power cords, the hum of sewing machines a constant background noise. \nAnd again, food plays a part. At the center of these gatherings there’s always a snack table laden with breads, cookies, cupcakes, coffee cake, a lemon pie and snacks galore, many of which are homemade. \nWhen Quilting Bits & Pieces sponsors a quilt camp and late-into-the-night quilting sessions, everyone brings snacks and sets up a tempting buffet, and Lang, a skilled quilter who is also recognized as a good cook, shares both sweet and savory snacks. \n“Food is associated with everything we do,” agrees Judy Brennan, leader of Stitch ’n Tyme, a quilting group affiliated with the United Methodist Church of the Resurrection in Leawood, which sponsors several off-site retreats that run nearly continuously for two to three days. \nStitch ’n Tyme recently met in Parkville for a retreat. Group members also meet quarterly at a potluck to celebrate their artistic creations, their ministry and their friendship. Their upscale potlucks include linens, china and dishes — outward signs of how important these gatherings are for the members. \nOne of the pastors of their church joins them for the meal and leads the prayer that blesses the quilts and their recipients. When pressed about a favorite dish at the potluck, members unanimously praise Diane Tolin and her lasagna, a recipe that is prepared in a slow cooker. \nTolin first made the recipe when she was traveling by RV because it was easy to make and transport. It serves large numbers of people and can be made ahead of an event, so she began taking it to quilting potlucks. \nThe group started in 2009 when Tolin moved to Kansas City. She began with a Quilting 101 class and followed it with a mother/daughter summer program. Now there are 36 members. Anyone is welcome to join, whether skilled quilters, novices who want to learn or those who just long for fellowship. The women range in age from their 30s to 80s — there’s even a teen who joins in on school breaks. \nTheir finished charity quilts — they make about 80 each year — are given to the Congregational Care Ministers, who distribute them to anyone in need: the ill, hospitalized, home-bound or those in hospice care. Recipients do not need to be a church member to receive a quilt. \nWhen a fellow member is facing a difficult or challenging time, each member makes a quilt block that they piece into a quilt. That quilt is wrapped around a fellow member, surrounding them in love and support during times of need. \nSo the next time you hear a quilter raving about a Layer Cake or Jelly Roll, don’t forget to ask if she is creating a beautiful and timeless quilt or a delicious recipe — or both. \nKathy Moore and Roxanne Wyss are Kansas City-based professional home economists and the authors of several cookbooks featuring small appliances, including the slow cooker. After working on this story, Roxanne decided to get back quilting and joined Stitch ’n Tyme. \nSlow Cooker Lasagna \nThis recipe can be assembled in a removable crock the day before. Cover and refrigerate overnight; cook as directed, but increase cooking time by 1 to 2 hours on low. \nMakes 8 to 10 servings \n2 pounds bulk Italian sausage, ground beef or ground turkey (or a combination of ground meat) \n1 medium onion, diced \n2 jars spaghetti sauce (a total of 40 ounces) \nSalt and pepper, to taste \n2 to 3 teaspoons Italian seasoning, or to taste \n1 (10 3/4-ounce) can condensed cream of mushroom soup \n16 ounces shredded mozzarella cheese \n1 (15- to 16-ounce) container small curd cottage cheese or 15-ounce container low-fat ricotta cheese \n12 lasagna noodles (about 3/4 of a 16-ounce) package, uncooked \nCook ground meat and onion in a large skillet, over medium high heat, stirring to crumble, until meat is brown and onions are tender. Drain. Stir in spaghetti sauce and season meat with salt and pepper and Italian seasoning, to taste. Set aside. \nIn a medium bowl, stir together soup, mozzarella cheese and cottage cheese. \nSpray a large slow cooker with nonstick cooking spray. Spoon about a fourth of the meat-sauce mixture in the bottom of the slow cooker. Top with about a third of the lasagna noodles, breaking to fit, if necessary. Top evenly with about a third of the cheese mixture. Repeat layer two more times. Top with the remaining meat-sauce mixture, spreading to cover the top evenly. \nCover and cook on low setting 5 to 7 hours or on high setting 2 1/2 to 3 hours, or until hot and bubbly throughout.
