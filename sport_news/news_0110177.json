The latest loss left Saskatchewan with a 2-14 record for the first time since 1980. \nThe announced paid attendance was 30,488. But how many people were actually in the gallery for the 10th-last regular-season game at Mosaic Stadium 1.0? \nWere there even 20,000 people at the game? \nAnd how many people would have shown up if the Roughriders/Eskimos matchup had coincided with a seventh game in the Toronto Blue Jays/Kansas City Royals series? \nDriving up to the stadium, traffic flowed without interruption or irritation 45 minutes before the game. There was an eerie silence as an antiquated scribe waddled toward the old Taylor Field. \nMembers of the Riders Pep Band did their utmost to drum up some enthusiasm, but it seemed that many blank-faced attendees approached the gates in the same fashion that they would line up for an inoculation. \nThe Roughriders did take some shots downfield once the proceedings began - exploding for three early touchdowns against an Eskimos team that is noted for its carnivorous defence - only to unravel yet again. \nEdmonton rang up 32 successive points, aided by an alleged Saskatchewan defence that treated the Rider Nation to innovative ways to miss, or not even attempt, a tackle. \nThere was Roughriders defensive back Junior Mertile, for example, standing idly by as Adarius Bowman shook off Tyree Hollins - who was attempting to strip the ball from the Eskimos receiver - and merrily waltzed into the end zone. \nWhile witnessing yet another festival of missed tackles, it was hard not to miss the good old days - which weren't even two years ago, actually. On Nov. 24, 2013, quarterback Darian Durant held the Grey Cup over his head as the Roughriders celebrated the first home-field championship-game victory in franchise history. \nNow the Roughriders are in over their heads against most opponents. \nIt doesn't help matters that Durant is recovering from his second consecutive season-ending injury - having suffered a ruptured left Achilles tendon in the opener against the Winnipeg Blue Bombers. \nIn that game, as in Saturday's contest, some quick strikes on offence were not enough to prevent the foe from prevailing. Ultimately, matador defence was the Riders' undoing. Again. \nAs if by script, the same old problems became painfully evident - much like several thousand vacant seats. \nWas the stadium, or the figurative glass, half-empty or half-full? \nThere were a few encouraging signs. The young quarterbacks, Brett Smith and Keith Price, performed reasonably well. So did receivers Ryan Smith and Naaman Roosevelt, who should be two key components of a desperately needed rebuilding initiative. Keenan Mac-Dougall was impressive, and aggressive, in his introductory start at safety. \nBut then, of course, there was the regularly scheduled collapse ... and another loss to a divisional rival ... and the widespread indifference toward a late-October game. \nNot so long ago, those games meant something. A chill in the air signalled that the Roughriders' season was reaching a culmination. There was a buzz around the imminent playoffs and an insatiable appetite for all things green and white. \nAs a pronounced and disillusioning contrast, there are non-events such as Saturday's game. \nEven before the final gun sounded, the brave souls who did show up for a glorified exhibition contest silently shuffled out of the stadium. \nAll hope had disappeared much earlier - in August, come to think of it. \nAnd two games remain in the season that never ends. \nrvanstone@leaderpost.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T14:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T17:38:47.842+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
