They’ll host the defending Super Bowl champion New England Patriots on Sunday night (8:30 p.m., NBC) at Lucas Oil Stadium. \nLuck appeared to make significant progress Wednesday, throwing real football passes during the portion of practice available to the media for the first time in 14 days. These weren’t pitches or handoffs or tosses. These were throws. Down the sidelines, to the corner of the end zone, real football throws. Andrew Luck open to adjusting Colts' offensive style \nThrows that hinted at Luck trending in the right direction, you might say. \nStill, Luck was listed as a limited participant in practice. It’s very likely he’ll have to complete a full practice – without any restrictions, without any regressions – before he suits up for a game for the first time in three weeks. \n“I’m pretty darn close to where I want to be,” Luck said Wednesday afternoon. \nBut it’s no guarantee he’s out there Sunday, no matter his increased practice participation, the significance of this game or even the fact that it’d be his first in a span of 20 days. There is a delicacy to this injury – Luck is a franchise quarterback with a sore throwing shoulder, after all – and more than one voice in the room when the Colts make the final decision. There’s the owner. There’s the general manager. There’s the coach. The doctors. The trainers. The quarterback himself. \n“I know for a fact our higher-ups in this building are not going to put anybody out there that’s not ready to play at a productive level in the NFL, that can’t help the team,” Luck said. “That’s sort of the approach I’m talking about. I’m not going to worry about the what ifs or the hypotheticals.” IndyStar's Zak Keefer and Stephen Holder discuss Wednesday's Indianapolis Colts-related developments. Watch Andrew Luck throw in practice. Clark Wade / IndyStar.com \nAlso at play here: The location of this injury directly affects Luck’s ability to do his job. Quarterbacks suit up all the time with bad knees, sore ankles, bruised ribs. (Luck is likely no exception.) A sore throwing shoulder is far more severe, and could be far more costly. \nIn other words: The Colts aren’t putting him out there unless he can play like Andrew Luck. \nNot against this team. Not against this coach. \nLuck will first have to get cleared by the medical staff, but the discussions don’t end there. Coach Chuck Pagano will have his say. Like any player returning from injury, he evaluates Luck on the practice field – his ability to move, to cut, to throw – and weighs that comfort level in accordance with the position, the injury and where the recovery stands. \n“Just like anybody else that’s coming back from something… we’re going to evaluate him, then we’re going to make a decision,” Pagano said. “If it comes down to a Sunday game-day decision, if he’s got to go out and warm up, then we’ll look at it. If he’s ready, and he can help us, and he can play the entire game, then we’ll have him up, and it’s no different than anyone else on the team.” \nPagano can repeat all he wants that Luck’s situation is like that of any injured player. It’s not. He’s the franchise quarterback, in just his fourth season, playing behind a hodgepodge offensive line. In this instance, prudence trumps all. Luck practices (we think), hopes to play vs. Patriots (maybe) \nLuck has been intentionally vague discussing his injury, leaning on phrases like “I’m feeling better every day” and “it feels like I’m right on track.” Still, he’s been sidelined for consecutive weeks, the first time he’s missed in his NFL career. All the while, his practice repetitions have increased, steadily, as restrictions have been reduced. He’s gone from watching the bulk of the workout to participating in the bulk of the workout. \nSigns point to a return. But, again, signs have pointed to a return before. \n“Certainly took the next step,” Luck offered Wednesday. “Absolutely. Did more and felt better and better. I think I’m on track. So, yeah, happy with how I responded. \n“I think I’ve thrown better, (I’m) moving faster, doing everything better and with less restrictions.” \nOne step down. Still some to go. Luck’s next task is to recover from Wednesday’s workout favorably, with little soreness and without any regression. How his shoulder responds these final two days of preparation will, more than anything, determine his playing status for Sunday. \n“If he’s ready to go, we’ll put him out there,” Pagano added. “That’s as far as I’ll say on that. He’s a great communicator. We’ve got great docs and trainers working with him. When he’s ready, I’m gonna put him out there.” \nWhen will Luck be ready? \nWe don't know. \nWhat we do: He's trending in the right direction. \nCall Star reporter Zak Keefer at (317) 444-6134.
