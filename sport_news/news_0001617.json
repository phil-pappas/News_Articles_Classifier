RADIO: WBT-AM 1110 in Charlotte is flagship station (Mick Mixon play-by-play, Eugene Robinson and Jim Szoke color analysts, Jordan Gross sideline reporter) LAST WEEK: Philadelphia – Won 27-7 vs. New York Giants, Carolina – Won 27-23 at Seattle. NEXT WEEK: Philadelphia – Bye week, Carolina – Host Indianapolis at 8:30 p.m. next Monday night. THE SERIES: Philadelphia leads all-time series 6-3, including three of four since Carolina won 14-3 at Philadelphia in 2003 NFC title game. The only Panthers win in the last four games came on a 2012 Monday Night Football game in which Cam Newton directed a comeback from a 22-21 fourth-quarter deficit to win 30-22 at Philadelphia. In the their last meeting last season, the Eagles won 45-21 at home as its defense sacked Newton nine times and forced three interceptions and one fumble from him. RANKINGS AMONG NFL (After week 6): Carolina offense – 28 th overall, 3 rd rushing, 30 th passing. Carolina defense – 7 th overall, 12 th rushing, 15 th passing. Philadelphia offense – 13 th overall, 19 th rushing, 14 th passing. Philadelphia defense – 15 th overall, 8 th rushing, 19 th passing. BY THE NUMBERS: 93.2 – Percentage of teams (54 of 58) to make the playoffs after starting the NFL regular season 5-0 since schedules were expanded to 16 games in 1978. MATCHUP TO WATCH: Carolina rushing offense against Philadelphia. Carolina is 116-25-1 all-time when it has 30 or more rushing attempts, including 28-8-1 under fifth-year head coach Ron Rivera. The Panthers have had 30 or more rushing attempts in all five games this season and appear well on their way to challenging the 2003 record of 13 games with 30 or more rushing attempts. NOTABLE: The Panthers are 13-20 all-time in prime time games, including 1-4 on NBC Sunday Night Football. Carolina’s lone win came in 2009 when it beat Minnesota 26-7. The Panthers have lost four straight prime time games, last winning in 2013 on Monday Night Football over New England (24-20)…. Greg Olsen is having one of the best seasons of his NFL career. After picking up a career-high 134 yards on eight catches with two touchdowns in 27-22 home win over New Orleans on Sept. 27, Olsen had the second-highest yardage total (131) on seven catches with the game-winning touchdown in last week’s win at Seattle…. Carolina’s current nine-game regular season winning streak is the longest current winning streak in the NFL. It started with a Week 14 victory at New Orleans and Green Bay (eight) and Denver (seven) are the only teams with seven or more consecutive regular season wins…. Two Panthers coaches have long ties to the Eagles’ organization – head coach Ron Rivera was linebackers coach from 1999 to 2003 and defensive coordinator Sean McDermott was employed by the Eagles in several capacties from 1998 to 2010, including defensive coordinator the last two seasons…. Five Eagles players and five Eagles coaches have Carolinas ties – wide receiver Seyi Ajirotutu played for the Panthers in 2011, running back Kenjon Barner played for the Panthers in 2013, quarterback Thad Lewis played at Duke, cornerback Byron Maxwell is from North Charleston, S.C., and played at Clemson, cornerback Denzel Rice is from Winston-Salem and played at Coastal Carolina, defensive coordinator Bill Davis was Panthers outside linebackers coach from 1995-98, defensive line/assistant head coach Jerry Azzinaro was defensive coordinator at Duke from 2004-06, assistant strength and conditioning coach Quandrian Banks was the director of athletic performance at Gardner-Webb from 2011-13, inside linebackers coach Rick Minter was an assistant coach at N.C. State (1980-82) and South Carolina (2004) and running backs coach Duce Staley played at South Carolina from 1995-96 and in 2012 was inducted into the Gamecocks’ athletic Hall of Fame. PREDICTION: Carolina 24, Philadelphia 21 – Would think national TV and an electric Bank of America Stadium would keep the Panthers from any sort of letdown after last week’s win at Seattle. And a Carolina victory would secure the best start in franchise history of 6-0. The previous best start of 5-0 came in 2003 – or when Carolina advanced all the way to the Super Bowl.
