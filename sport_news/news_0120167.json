Manny Pacquiao, in New York to accept an award at the United Nations, says he will be ready to get in the ring again around March of next year.\n\"My shoulder is 80 to 90 percent healed and I believe I can start training in November or December so I can fight early next year,\" Pacquiao said Monday at the Asia Society, which is honoring the Philippine boxer at its Asia Game Changer Awards on Tuesday at the UN.\nPacquiao lost to Floyd Mayweather Jr on May 2 in what was billed beforehand as the \"Fight of the Century.\" After that contest it was revealed that Pacquiao had suffered a torn rotator cuff in his right shoulder while training and had reinjured it in the fourth round. He underwent arthroscopic surgery on May 7.\nOn Monday, Pacquiao was asked about British fighter Amir Khan as a potential opponent, but said nothing is decided.\n\"Actually that's one other names that my promoter gave to me,\" said Pacquiao. \"We are friendly, but when you are in the ring there is no friend.\"\nPacquiao also said he expects to file paperwork later this week to start his bid for a seat in the Philippine Senate. Pacquiao is already a congressman in the Philippines, where he has lent his support to bills addressing human trafficking, healthcare and teacher salaries.\n\"I'm running because I really believe I can help more people,\" said Pacquiao.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T00:20:35.226+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
