Assistant coach Larry Scott will serve as interim coach for the remainder of the season. \n“Coach Golden has led our program through some very difficult times and he has done so with class, integrity and a true desire to see our students succeed on the field, in the classroom and in the community.” James said. “However, we have a proud tradition of excellence at Miami, not just in football but in all sports, and we want to compete for ACC and national championships. I simply believe that now is the time to bring the Hurricane Family together and rally behind our young men.” \nGolden was 32-25 in his five seasons at the helm and led the Canes to two bowl games in 2013 and 2014. \n“On behalf of my family I want to thank the University of Miami for a tremendous opportunity,” Golden said. “I believe in what we are doing and how we are doing it and we have some outstanding young men in our football program. Though this moment is difficult, we wish the Canes the best of luck going forward.” \nThe firing comes one day after the worst loss in school history, 58-0 at home against No. 6 Clemson. \nThere was booing in the first quarter, a \"Fire Golden\" chant soon afterward and many of those who did show — the announced attendance was 45,211, while the actual number was clearly far less — never returned to their seats after halftime, perhaps a wise move given that Clemson already had a 42-0 lead and was dealing Miami a loss that undoubtedly won't be forgotten anytime soon. \nEven members of the U.S. Congress took to Twitter to complain about how far the Hurricanes (4-3, 1-2 Atlantic Coast Conference) have fallen. \n\"I know it isn't far from outhouse to penthouse,\" Clemson coach Dabo Swinney said after the game. \"I don't celebrate anything from Miami's bad day. I feel for him. I hate it, man. Al Golden is a great guy. I have a lot of respect for him. I have respect for this university.\" \nContributing: The Associated Press Read or Share this story: http://on.wtsp.com/1S4UohD TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T00:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T00:52:43.308+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
