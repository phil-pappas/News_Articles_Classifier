It has been a labour of love, but one I have thoroughly enjoyed.” \nNick now works as the Suffolk Football Association’ marketing and public relations officer, and a freelance cricket writer. \nSome of the book’s quirkier stories include a cricketer who was inspired to play again after visiting a graveyard and a Cup match that was settled in an examination hall. \nAdded Nick: “There are some sad stories, while others will bring a smile to your face. \n“Anyone picking up a newspaper only gets to read the printed version of the story, but Scoop also relates some of the tales behind the stories which can be equally, if not more, interesting to the reader but they never get to hear about. \n“I think the book will appeal to anyone with a broad interest in sport, but particularly cricket and football, and also anyone who has an interest in journalism.” \nScoop, published by JMD Media Ltd and priced at £14.99, can be bought here .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T07:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T07:31:59.707+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
