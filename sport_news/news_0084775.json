Pink ribbons are painted on the field and on game balls. And oh, hey, look at this! The players and coaches’ uniforms have been altered to incorporate pink, too! Pink cleats. Pink towels. Pink wristbands. Pink hats on the sidelines.\nAll of which are available for purchase at NFLshop.com or your local stadium.\nDon’t get me wrong, the NFL’s efforts to promote breast cancer awareness are admirable, and any attention or money “A Crucial Catch” generates can only help fight a disease that still claims far too many women and men. The NFL says that 100% of proceeds from its pink products go to the American Cancer Society.\nBut the campaign smacks of being more than a little disingenuous when players who want to further that cause are told no – and even fined in Heyward’s case – when the only notable difference between the efforts is that the NFL is no longer the one getting credit. And it’s outrageous that the NFL chooses to focus on something as trivial as this while going deaf, dumb and blind to Greg Hardy’s misogynist remarks, to say nothing of the autopsy report that showed a 26-year-old former player had CTE.\nThe NFL won’t comment on Williams or Heyward, but it has extensive rules prohibiting “personal messages” by players. Five sentences and 218 words worth. Which is understandable if it relates to preventing players from turning themselves into billboards, or promoting a cause or company that runs counter to the NFL brand.\nBut Williams and Heyward are trying to further a cause that’s near and dear to the NFL’s heart, and Williams wants to do it by extending the league’s own campaign.\nWilliams lost his mother and four aunts to breast cancer, and he was one of the driving forces in getting “A Crucial Catch” launched in 2009. All he asked was that he be allowed to continue wearing something pink for the entire season. It didn’t have to be conspicuous. His wristbands, maybe, or his cleats.\nJust something that might remind or encourage someone to get tested.\n“One time, a lady came up to me and said she was going to get examined just because she saw me wearing pink cleats during a game,” Williams wrote in an essay for The Monday Morning Quarterback after his mother died in May 2014.\n“I walked away thinking, `Wow, pink is really so much more than just a color. It’s a lifesaver. It’s awareness. If we reach one, we reach millions. If we reach millions, we’re doing our job and getting closer to finding a cure.’”\nHeyward’s father, Craig “Ironhead” Heyward, died of brain cancer in 2006. As a tribute, the younger Heyward wore eye black with the words “Iron” and “Head” during Pittsburgh’s game against San Diego on Monday night.\nHonoring a loved one while drawing attention to a disease that has touched us all in some way, shape or form isn't selfish or subversive, it's commendable. But the NFL wouldn’t budge for either – though it was happy to showcase Williams in an ad promoting its “Crucial Catch” campaign.\nThe NFL has made a lot of money by being obsessive to detail. But in this case its focus on something so small only shows the league has lost sight of the big picture.\nThe league has some very real problems to address. A player wearing pink cleats all season isn’t one of them.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.usatoday.com/sports/", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T11:47:00.732+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
