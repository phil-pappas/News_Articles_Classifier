It also asked senior advocate Amrendra Sharan, appearing for CBI, to file a status report on the progress of probe into these cases in the first week of January next year. “Some cases have been registered in the second half of 2015,\" the counsel said, indicating that it may not be possible to conclude probe in all the cases by the year end.
