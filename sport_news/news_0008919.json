He put the onus on himself for calling too many passing plays Saturday as the Beavers' offense took a step back, mustering a futile 2.7 yards per pass attempt.\n\"I tried to throw the ball,\" Baldwin said. \"We're not very good at that yet. I thought we were going to get better.\"\nBut when broached about the offensive line, the unit that turned in Oregon State's most disappointing effort in the 2015 season opener, he struck a different note. Baldwin called the line's pass protection \"excellent\" and with fair reasoning.\nAs one of the youngest teams in college football, OSU has seen ebbs and flows in consistency on both sides of the ball. However, the line has adapted to the swirl of change perhaps better than any unit to this point.\nDuring Oregon State's final season in a pro style system under the previous coaching staff, the Beavers allowed three sacks per game with Sean Mannion, the school's all-time leading passer, at quarterback.\nIn the midst of an offseason of coaching and scheme changes, the line maintained consistency. Four starters returned and the unit added Isaac Seumalo at guard after he sat out the previous year with a foot fracture .\nAs the Beavers have gone from one of the most experienced signal callers in school history to an untested true freshman in Seth Collins, the line's pass protection has taken positive strides while adapting to a new spread offense.\nOregon State has allowed only six sacks in five games this season, the third-lowest average in the Pac-12.\n\"It's a drastic improvement from the last two years,\" junior left tackle Sean Harlow said.\nMannion attempted 14 more passes per game in his final season than Collins has in the first five games of his career. Yet even as the Beavers put more on the true freshman's shoulders, the line has held firm.\nStanford sacked Collins only once when he fired a career-high 36 passes on Sept. 25. Collins struggled mightily against Arizona, when Baldwin said he should have put a greater effort into the run game. Yet even as his accuracy waned in that 24-pass effort, the freshman did not take any sacks.\nKeeping sack totals low can be a tough task for teams running the spread. Washington State, the Beavers' upcoming opponent known for its Air Raid offense, has allowed 14 total sacks in back-to-back games against Cal and Oregon.\nBut as much as the Cougars have struggled to protect their own quarterback, they have had nearly an equivalent level of success attacking opposing passers under first-year defensive coordinator Alex Grinch.\nWashington State has put a new focus on rushing the passer this season and managed 14 sacks in five games. That nearly matches the Cougars' total (20) from the entire 2014 season.\nLinebackers Kache Palacio and Ivan McLennan each have tallied four sacks apiece, closely followed by 2.5 from freshman defensive lineman Hercules Mata'afa and two by senior Darryl Paulo.\nThe Cougars are not a blitz-heavy group but have still shown a knack for getting in the backfield. Their 8.8 tackles for loss per game are more than in any previous season since Mike Leach took over as coach in 2012. That mark ranks second in the Pac-12.\n\"They're always physical. They're always high motor guys,\" Harlow said. \"They do a lot of stunts when it gets down to passing situations.\"\nOregon State's pass protection has been a fleeting bright spot in a transitional year but will face its toughest test thus far from a squad typically known for its offense. The Cougars have flexed a defense now capable of holding on to quality conference wins, while the Beavers feature the fifth least efficient offense among Power 5 conference teams.\nBaldwin said the hope is that the Beavers can establish the run, taking pressure off Collins and the pass blocking. Given that scenario, he expressed confidence that the offense will improve – with a healthy dose of bluntness.\n\"We've got nowhere else to go right now, right?\"\n-- Danny Moran\ndmoran@oregonian.com\n@DannyJMoran", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/DannyJMoran", "http://www.osubeavers.com/SportSelect.dbml?SPID=127145"], "published": "2015-10-15T02:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T10:07:51.713+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
