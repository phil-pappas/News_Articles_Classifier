You are always chipping to take the spin off and that's very hard to do.\"\nRANKINGS FALL\nDonaldson followed up his tie for fifth at the European Open in Germany two weeks ago by sharing 13th place at the Dunhill Links Pro-Am Championship in Scotland.\nHe began this season ranked 24th in the world after winding up a career-high fourth on the European money-list in 2014 by winning the Czech Masters and claiming runner-up finishes at the Nedbank Challenge in South Africa and the WGC-Cadillac Championship in Florida.\nThis year has not been anywhere near as successful for Donaldson and he has fallen to 48th in the world.\n\"My game is not too far off,\" he said. \"I've probably played one tournament too many this week after having played two in a row.\n\"The Dunhill was a huge week so I'll have two weeks off now and get ready for the last four of the season.\"\nDonaldson's face suddenly lit up when the conversation turned to this weekend's other main sporting activities.\nHe was pleased the Wales soccer squad had qualified for next year's European Championship in France and was also relishing the prospect of his country's rugby team meeting the powerful South Africans in next week's World Cup quarter-finals.\n\"I watched the rugby on television,\" said Donaldson of Wales' 15-6 defeat by Australia at Twickenham on Saturday.\n\"How Wales didn't score a try when the ball was almost on the line with 15 minutes to go I don't know but, overall, it was a great game to watch.\"\n(Editing by Ed Osmond )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T17:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T16:56:50.218+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
