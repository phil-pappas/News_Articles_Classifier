AP The most infamous hunting mishap in recent American history is most likely Dick Cheney’s 2006 quail-hunting trip in Texas, when he accidentally shot a 78-year-old attorney in the face.\nWhile you may see the occasional news report of something going wrong in the woods, not many other well-known examples immediately come to mind. That’s because hunting incidents are actually pretty rare these days—at least more than they used to be. Boston.com obtained the records of all hunting-related shooting incidents since 1940 in Maine, where hunting is popular, from the state’s Department of Fisheries and Wildlife.\nRecords show 1952 was the deadliest year for hunters in Maine. Of the 70 shooting incidents that took place, 19 were fatal. Two years before that, in 1950, there were 57 incidents in which 19 people died. 1948 was the third-deadliest year with 44 incidents and 15 fatalities.\nBut in the mid-1970s, the number of shootings and deaths began to fall off. And in the late 1980s, the decline continued.\nBetween 1973 and 1986, the average number of annual incidents fell to 31, with an average of three fatalities a year. Since 1986, that number has plummeted to 11 annual incidents and less than one fatality.\n“We’re seeing the number of hunters holding steady or slowly increasing,” said Mark Latti, the state’s Fisheries and Wildlife Divisions outreach and communications coordinator. “And yet seeing the numbers and severity of shooting-related incidents going down.”\nWhat happened? Two things. First, in 1973, the state established a rule that hunters must wear two pieces of blaze orange clothing: one must be a hat, and the other “should cover a major portion of the torso.”\nBefore orange was required, hunters wore clothes that blended in with their surroundings. These outfits made for risky hunting conditions: If you can’t see someone, it’s harder to avoid accidentally shooting them.\nu The second mandate that contributed to safer hunting came in 1986, when the state started requiring that hunters take a safety course.\n“What jumps out when you look back into 40s and 50s, when you look at the number of fatalities, it’s astounding,” Latti said. “It’s double digits almost every year.”\nBut despite these safety measures, unintentional shootings haven’t stopped altogther. Two incidents have been recorded in 2015 so far, one during turkey hunting season last spring, and another during bird hunting season this fall. In both cases, hunters shot someone in their party with pellets from a shotgun, though Latti added that about 50 percent of incidents are self-inflicted. Fortunately, none of the injuries so far this year have been life-threatening.\nThe most recent death from a hunting-related shooting occured in 2012. To avoid incidents altogether, Latti said that hunters should follow three rules: Treat every firearm as if it’s loaded, be sure of your target and keep your gun pointed in a safe direction.\nLatti also stressed the importance of not calling these shooting-related incidents accidents.\n“What we see is that decisions were made or actions were made that led to that shooting,” he said. “It wasn’t by chance or by accident.”\nShare 0 Tweet 0 Advertisement Study warns hands-free car systems still distract drivers 10.23.15 | 6:22 AM Here’s how accidental hunting deaths dropped dramatically in Maine 10.23.15 | 5:51 AM This Charlestown bar is searching for its missing ‘dog’ 10.22.15 | 9:37 PM Massachusetts coffee chain fined $47,000 for breaking child labor laws, stealing tips 10.22.15 | 8:52 PM The Brookline cockatoo is back in its cage 10.22.15 | 8:42 PM Yes, you’re allowed to bring licensed firearms on the commuter rail 10.22.15 | 7:39 PM Maine nurse suing Gov.
