The agency will accept additional written comments from the public through Oct. 21.\nThe commission is expected to vote on the draft rules on Oct 22. The rules would quickly go into effect so the agency can begin accepting applications for licenses in January.\nThe commission on Friday also heard from lawmakers serving on a legislative committee looking at marijuana implementation. In a letter to commission members, the four lawmakers said proposed requirements that would limit majority ownership of cannabis businesses to Oregon residents and restrict out-of-state investors from controlling the management of a marijuana company would stifle growth and investment in Oregon's cannabis industry.\nRob Patridge, chairman of the liquor commission, has said the rules are designed to support the growth of a marijuana industry run by Oregonians . Many marijuana industry representatives, however, say the rules will make it harder for them to get outside investors.\nIn an email signed by Sen. Ginny Burdick, D-Portland, Sen. Ted Ferrioli, R-John Day, Rep. Ann Lininger, D-Lake Oswego, and Rep. Carl Wilson, R-Grants Pass, the lawmakers wrote that \"the residency requirement would treat newcomers and non-Oregonians less favorably than long-time Oregonians. That's troubling.\"\nThe lawmakers added that their \"own thinking on these issues has evolved over time.\"\n\"We now believe that broad residency requirements and significant limits on outside investment could do more harm than good,\" they wrote.\nThe size of marijuana production sites remains another key issue that's not yet been settled. Some growers and concentrate producers have pushed for generous limits. Liquor commission officials said determining the size of grow sites is a challenge without a clear idea of consumer demand.\n\"My tendency,\" said Patridge, \"is to be conservative about what we are doing. It's always easier to allow people to expand.\"\nAt Friday's hearing, the commission heard a wide range of complaints, from physicians worried about impaired driving and kids accidentally ingesting pot to marijuana growers and retailers worried about transitioning into the recreational industry.\nOutdoor growers in southern Oregon said the draft rules, which require extensive security and prohibit marijuana consumption at licensed grow sites, represented excessive regulation.\n\"We are small family farmers so in reading over these draft rules the things that are most concerning to us are things that we consider barriers to entry for small family farmers,\" said Will Feetham, a medical marijuana grower in Eagle Point.\nTwo Portland pediatricians urged strong regulation of marijuana-infused edibles and the way they are packaged.\nDr. Ben Hoffman , a pediatrician at OHSU Doernbecher Children's Hospital and a nationally recognized injury prevention specialist, also said marijuana should be taxed so prices are \"artificially high.\" Research has shown that raising tobacco and alcohol prices translates into less consumer demand, he said.\nHe said the state should enforce the laws, regularly inspect and audit license holders and impose \"stiff penalties for transgressions.\"\nDr. Thomas Valvano , also a Doernbecher pediatrician whose focus is child abuse and neglect, said increased access to marijuana by adults means more children will be exposed to the drug.\n\"I have seen firsthand the effects of drug abuse in the home on the children living in that home when the drug is not used responsibly,\" Valvano told the commission. \"I have listened to children as young as 5-years-old describe in detail what their parents' marijuana looks like, where their parents keep it, how their parents smoke it, and how they act afterward.\"\nBoth physicians said they appeared before the commission as representatives of the Oregon Pediatrics Society, which is the state chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics. They stressed that they were not speaking on behalf of Doernbecher.\nPatridge said the commission plans to proceed with caution when it comes to allowing marijuana-infused edibles, which typically have delayed yet strong effects on consumers.\nRegulating edibles has proven to be especially complicated in Washington and Colorado, each home to state-regulated marijuana markets. Regulators aim to protect consumers, especially inexperienced ones, but they also want to limit accidental ingestion by children who could mistake them for regular candies and treats.\nThe Oregon Health Authority, which is developing some of the rules for edibles, issued draft regulations last week that would limit serving sizes on both the recreational and medical marijuana markets.\nPatridge said he hopes the agency approves different types of edibles \"on a slow rolling basis that we can handle and manage public safety.\"\n-- Noelle Crombie\n503-276-7184; @noellecrombie", "external_links": ["https://www.ohsu.edu/xd/health/services/providers/index.cfm?personID=1688", "http://www.ohsu.edu/xd/health/services/providers/?personid=2230"], "published": "2015-10-10T14:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T22:25:47.850+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
