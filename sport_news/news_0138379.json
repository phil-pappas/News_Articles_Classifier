After a game of timely plays and another strong defensive showing, Becton’s players had yet another victory to enjoy.\nThis time, it was a 10-6 win over Cresskill on a wet, muddy field Friday night.\n\"They came in averaging 33 points,\" Becton coach Jack Maher said. \"And I think we did a pretty good job of holding them to six.\"\nPlaying in the competitive NJIC Meadowlands Division, which includes five teams with at least three wins, Cresskill (3-2) has thrived with its running game. Running back Brendan Coffey had another big showing Friday, running for 130 yards on 26 carries.\nBecton’s defense, though, has been strong all season. The Wildcats (4-1) had given up just 21 points in four games entering Friday.\nAnd against the Cougars, Becton’s defense routinely came up big.\nCresskill started its first drive with the ball on its own 30-yard line. Coffey helped the Cougars march down to the Wildcats’ 30, but Becton came up with a big stop on fourth-and-5 to stall Cresskill’s drive.\nThe Wildcats later got the ball at their own 16 with 5.9 seconds remaining in the first quarter, and put together a drive that ate up more than half of the second quarter. Becton got the ball down to Cresskill’s 10-yard line, and James Loremikan kicked a 25-yard field goal to give the Wildcats a 3-0 lead.\nChris Riley started Cresskill’s ensuing drive with a 51-yard kick return to get the ball to Becton’s 35. Coffey picked up 32 yards on six plays, helping the Cougars get down to the Wildcats’ 1-yard line. But Becton blocked Cresskill’s field-goal-attempt, and Nico Failla ran the ball back to the Cougars’ 34.\nThat set up quarterback Michael Bolwell’s 24-yard touchdown pass to Seven Strong. Loremikan kicked the extra point, giving Becton a comfortable 10-0 lead going into halftime.\nCoffey went right back to work in the second half. After Cresskill got the ball at its own 34, he had a pair of big gains and quarterback Jack Maltby also had a key 10-yard gain to get the Cougars down to the 5. Maltby ran it in from there for a touchdown to make it 10-6.\nCresskill recovered a Becton fumble at the Wildcats’ 46 late in the fourth quarter. But Becton’s defense came up big once again, keeping the Cougars from picking up a first down.\nAll game, the Wildcats’ defense came up with the right plays at the right time.\n\"The timing for us, tonight, was unbelievable,\" Maher said. \"We stepped up at the right time.\"\nEmail: iseman@northjersey.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T04:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T09:20:45.979+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
