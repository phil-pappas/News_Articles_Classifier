Backup quarterback McCoy Hill.\nDefensive tackle Travis Tuiloma , who against Cincinnati played the most snaps he has since going down with an injury in the season opener against Nebraska, also hammed it up for the camera, and punter Jonny Linehan shared his joy with the BYU crowd.\nHall of Famers honored \nBYU inducted five former Cougar All-Americans into the BYU Athletic Hall of Fame last week and honored them during half time of the contest against Cincinnati. They included a pair of former football players — linebacker Rob Morris and running back Luke Staley — as well as John Hedengren (cross country/track), Willard Hirschi (track coach) and Nina Puikkonen Mortensen (volleyball).\nCelebrity watch \nMorris and Staley weren't the only former NFL players roaming the sidelines. Ronnie Lott, the Pro Football Hall of Fame defensive back who made his name as a bruising defender on the San Francisco 49ers teams in the 1980s, was seen chatting with BYU athletic director Tom Holmoe, a fellow former 49er, in the southwest corner of the field during the second quarter. Lott played 14 seasons in the NFL and won four Super Bowl titles with San Francisco.\nQB trio exits field together \nCougar quarterbacks Tanner Mangum and Taysom Hill walked — or in the case of the injured Hill, wheeled — off the field together Friday night, a reminder of the friendship these two hold and the talent BYU has built at the position. Quarterbacks coach Jason Beck, himself a former Cougar signal caller, joined the duo.\nOne proud uncle \nFollowing the game, Hill shared a picture on Twitter of himself and his wife with a newborn baby, his nephew. The post included the hashtags #wifeyisbabyhungry and #lilstud. Another Cougar quarterback waiting in the wings? Class of 2033?\nLoving my newest nephew!! Congratulations Celeste and Joe, so happy for you!! #wifeyisbabyhungry #lilstud pic.twitter.com/j6FO4EjWwv \n— Taysom Hill (@T_Hill4) October 18, 2015 \nBonus video \nRelive some of the best moments from the game in this recap of Friday night’s action. Quote of the night: “When I saw the ball sailing (towards me), I'm not kidding you, I laughed. I was like, 'Oh, my gosh. I am wide open right now.'” — Nick Kurtz, on his wide-open 53-yard touchdown catch in the fourth quarter that gave BYU a 31-24 lead.\nEmail: bjudd@deseretdigital.com ; Twitter: @brandonljudd", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T05:24:27.912+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
