Slow starts have hampered the 'Hoos on the schedule, and on the field. A 4th down and 23 conversion late in the game had UVa on the brink of winning a road game for the first time in three years. Senior defensive lineman Kwontie Moore says, \"Worst case, we're going to go to overtime and definitely win this game after we go to overtime.\" But four straight incompletions erased any chance for a Cavaliers' comeback. \"The ball was going to either Canaan or T.J.,\" says junior quarterback Matt Johns. \"T.J. had a good look, and the guy had his back to me. I know home much of a competitor this guy is. When I need a play, he's the guy that I'm going to go to.\" Thorpe says, \"I felt there was a little contact. There was contact throughout the game, which is how it's played. Hats off to them. The corner, he was fighting me all game, and he made a play.\" Virginia has yet to lead a single opponent after the first quarter this season. Pitt outscored the Cavaliers 17-3 in the first fifteen minutes, and Virginia's opponents have outscored them by a combined 40 points this season. The 'Hoos are looking for ways to avoid slow starts. Junior linebacker Zach Bradshaw says, \"We just got to come out more focused. We'll figure that out this week.\" Amidst the eleventh straight road loss, there was a silver lining, as UVa finally got its first turnover of the season. Senior defensive lineman Mike Moore says, \"We want to get more takeaways. We haven't been getting as many takeaways as we wanted to as a defense. We're going to just keep trying to force more. As I said we scored defensively. We got two turnovers. We scored on defense. This is the the main focus. Improving this team and winning football games. This Saturday against Syracuse, home game, is an opportunity to experience that.\" Head coach Mike London adds, \"We scored on defense. We got two turnovers. This is in main focus, improving this team, and winning football games. This Saturday against Syracuse, home game, is an opportunity to experience that.\" Slow Starts Causing Problems for Cavaliers More>>", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T23:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T00:58:27.415+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
