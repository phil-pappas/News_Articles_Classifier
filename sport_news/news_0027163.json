A delegation of BJP Legislature Party led by former Chief Minister P K Dhumal and state party chief Satpal Satti, which met the Governor, said that after registration of an FIR against Virbhadra Singh and his wife (former MP Pratibha Singh) by the CBI in disproportionate assets case and the subsequent raids at his premises, he has no moral right to continue in the office. The BJP legislature party which met here this morning to review the political situation unanimously resolved to intensify its offensive for the resignation of the Chief Minister. The party decided that its workers will go to the people to expose the corruption in the Congress. “The Chief Minister has been booked in a corruption case. His continuation in office can hamper a free and fair probe. He should have resigned on moral ground but he refused to quit. It is unfortunate that the Congress party in the Centre which was expected to direct him to resign was shielding and supporting him shamelessly”, the party said. Shrikant Sharma, in charge of BJP affairs for Himachal, said that it was intriguing that All India Congress Committee (AICC) president Sonia Gandhi and vice president Rahul Gandhi, who blow up small issues of corruption, were silent on the issue which proved that the Congress was “mother of corruption and a champion in covering up corruption”. Accusing the Congress of misleading the people on this issue through media, Dhumal said that party would reach out to people at the constituency level and expose corruption in the Congress. “We will hold rallies across the state and nail the lies and misinformation campaign unleashed by the Congress,” he added. To the Congress charge that the BJP is misusing the CBI to unleash political vendetta against Singh, Dhumal said that it was the UPA government which misused the CBI to protect the wrong doings of Virbhadra Singh. Now the law is taking its course. Dhumal claimed that the BJP would win the ensuing panchayat elections with three-fourth majority and repeat the performance in the Assembly elections.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T02:14:11.454+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
