Wisconsin's top tailback commit, Antonio Williams, flipped to the Buckeyes last week, and then came news that Michigan is rescinding its football scholarship offer for injured Southfield commit Matt Falcon .\nMichigan is playing on Walker's New Jersey roots, trying to convince him to join the three New Jersey players already in the class : receivers Ahmir Mitchell and Brad Hawkins and defensive end Ron Johnson.\nAccording to a post from Mitchell, U-M is reaching out to three New Jersey targets still on the board: rivals.com's No. 2 overall player, defensive tackle Rashan Gary, No. 17-ranked athlete Jordan Fuller and No. 21 Walker. Mitchell posted a mailer like the ones sent to prospects. It has Jim Harbaugh's signature in the corner, which usually is verification that it came from the staff.\nSome think of it as a dreamüí≠...
