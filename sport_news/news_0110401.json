Somehow. \nDalton drove the Bengals for points on his final three drives of regulation to vanquish a 17-point deficit, then drove on the second drive of overtime to set up a 43-yard Mike Nugent field goal - which hit the left upright and went through for a 27-24 overtime win. \nThe Bengals move to 5-0 for the first time since the Super Bowl year of 1988. And the win against the two-time defending NFC champions has this team looking like they could follow in their footsteps. \nDalton finished 30 of 44 for 331 yards with two touchdowns and one interception. Giovani Bernard carried 15 times for 80 yards. Tyler Eifert caught eight passes for 90 yards and two touchdowns. \nThe wheels seemed to come off for the Bengals during a disastrous two-minute stretch of the third quarter. On the first play following a Kevin Huber punt, Seattle backup running back Thomas Rawls took a handoff and cut back through a wide-open hole on the left side, then outran three Bengals defenders down the sideline, culminating in a missed tackle by Reggie Nelson. \nThe 69-yard run gave Seattle a 17-7 lead and was the longest against the Bengals this season. The previous long was 27. \nJust as the Bengals attempted to pull back into the game, they nearly gave it away. On a jet sweep by Rex Burkhead, Seahawks defensive lineman Michael Bennett broke free through the line, forced a fumble and Bobby Wagner returned it 23 yards for a touchdown. They trailed 24-7 with little over six minutes left in the third. \nSeattle suddenly placed the Bengals in the most adverse situation of the year. The Bengals only trailed for one minute, 58 seconds this season entering the day, and their largest deficit was three points in Baltimore. \nThe Bengals appeared done, but Dalton breathed life back into them. \nThanks to a 35-yard punt return by Adam Jones, Dalton was able to pull closer early in the fourth quarter. He hit Tyler Eifert for a 10-yard touchdown pass, floating a jump ball over Seattle cornerback Cary Williams. \nThen after a defensive stop, Dalton drove the Bengals in 11 plays, 71 yards, concluding in a 5-yard quarterback keeper to pull within three. Dalton worked the formation pre-snap to set up the weakness in the Seahawks' defense he exploited from under center. Dalton hit Mohamed Sanu four times on the drive. The only problem was the drive took 5:49 off the clock. \nCincinnati forced a three-and-out thanks to a Geno Atkins third-down sack of Russell Wilson, which gave the Bengals a final shot. \nIn a game dubbed a showdown between the high-octane Bengals offense and generationally great Seahawks defense, Sunday fittingly came down to one drive between two of the NFL's best. Cincinnati took the ball at their own 18 with 2:17 left. \nDalton made the most of it, with help on a 27-yard Seattle pass interference. It eventually turned into a third-down play where Dalton was hit scrambling, and the field-goal unit had to sprint onto the field without any timeouts. \nIn a wild scene, Nugent got the 31-yard field goal through the uprights as time expired to force overtime. \nA Steven Hauschka field goal gave Seattle a 10-7 lead and Cincinnati its first halftime deficit of the season. The Bengals outscored their opponents 66-18 in the first halves of games this season prior to Sunday.
