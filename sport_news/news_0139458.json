But when the Binghamton's senior went airborne Friday night, he had no peers. \nPettiford made two leaping touchdown catches, including the winner with 1 minute, 5 seconds left, to lift Binghamton to a 14-7 victory over Vestal on Friday night in a Section 4 Football Conference non-division game. \nIn a game that bore no resemblance to last season's 56-53 shootout won by the Golden Bears, the Patriots found a way in the closing minutes for the second straight week. \nBinghamton's winning drive covered 85 yards, with Pettiford making a pair of circus catches that ate up 71 of those yards. \nOn the drive's first play, quarterback John Petrucci threw a jump ball in the center of the field and Pettiford rose above Vestal defensive back Brandon Bender for a 30-yard gain. \nWhen Petrucci found Eric Fortner for a 9-yard gain on third-and-8, Binghamton had a first down Vestal's 38. On a second-and-13 from the Golden Bears' 41, Pettiford ran a deep route on the right side. Again, Bender's coverage was air-tight, but Pettiford leaped around the 5, caught Petrucci's pass above his head and eased into the end zone. Austin Becker-Harris' extra point made it 14-7. \n\"He throws it perfectly,\" Pettiford said of Petrucci, who went 15-for-29 for 176 yards with two touchdowns and two interceptions. \"Those are the kind of passes I love. I just had to reach different heights.\" \nAdded Vestal coach Tank Anderson: \"My young sophomore (Bender, who also had an interception in the fourth quarter) was right on him on those long passes and (Pettiford) goes up and takes them away from him.\" \nThe Golden Bears (4-4) started their final possession on their 33 with 58 seconds left, but Binghamton's Anthony Caezza intercepted a T.J. Wegmann pass over the middle on third down to all but seal it. \nIt was part of a big defensive effort by the 6-2 Patriots, who permitted a season-low in points and forced three turnovers, including a pair of fumble recoveries in the first quarter. \n\"It's always put on our offense, but today it was put on our defense,\" senior defensive tackle Mathias Silberstein said. \"It wasn't like, 'Oh, it's on us.' It was like, 'OK, let's do this.'\" \nPettiford recovered a fumble on Vestal's first drive. The Golden Bears' second drive penetrated Binghamton's 5, but Sam Bulman was stripped and Roan Hughes-Burns recovered at the 3. \n\"We turned the ball over, but you have to give Binghamton credit because the hits that caused the turnovers were solid,\" said Anderson, whose squad outgained Binghamton, 195-84, in the first half but went into halftime tied at 7. \nMidway through the second quarter, Vestal drove 42 yards for the game's opening score. \nBulman ripped off an 11-yard on a counter to the left side that gave Vestal a first-and-goal from the 2. Logan Wiland scored off the right side on the next play and Richard Gleason's PAT made it 7-0. \nBinghamton answered right back. Pettiford returned the ensuing kickoff 38 yards to Vestal's 43. Petrucci went 3-for-3 on the scoring drive, including a 6-yarder to PJ Torres for a first down and a 10-yarder to Pettiford on the right side for another a first down to the 19. \nOne play later, Pettiford ran a post pattern from the right side, got a step on Bender and made a leaping catch in the end zone on a 14-yard touchdown play. Becker-Harris' PAT made it 7-7 with 2:13 left in the half. \n\"Rasheen has made some huge strides the past few weeks,\" Binghamton coach Mike Ramil said of Pettiford, who caught four passes for 95 yards. \"He's become a major team player.\" \nVestal rushed for 213 yards, including 85 from Wiland, 70 from Wegmann and 51 by Bulman, who also caught four passes for 30 yards. \nThe Golden Bears will visit Johnson City on Friday for a Section 4 Class A semifinal. The teams met in Week 7, with the Wildcats winning, 34-27. \nBinghamton, which received 97 rushing yards from Devin Young, also gets a rematch next week, hosting Corning in a Class AA semi. The Patriots beat the Hawks, 41-34, last week, scoring the winning touchdown with 33 seconds left. \n\"We just have to find a way to win,\" Pettiford said. \"This year's team has more heart than last year's team.\" \nOn Twitter: @PSBRob 1 CONNECT 5 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://press.sn/1S1RWbJ TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T07:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T09:26:35.663+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
