The win allowed the Cougars to stay even with East Coweta and Westlake in the 3- standings at 3-1 heading into a trip to Pebblebrook next week. \nUnlike last week’s 7-0 lead after one quarter on the road at Westlake, Newnan’s defense held up Friday, despite making things harder on themselves in the second quarter. \nCampbell, which fell to 2-4 overall and remained winless in 3- at 0-4, dominated possession on drives of 15 and 20 plays in the second quarter, but both came up empty inside the Cougars’ 10-yard line. \nNewnan’s offense, meanwhile, needed just one snap to take a lead for good, scoring immediately when senior running back Marquis Hill raced 73 yards up the middle untouched for a quick 7-0 lead just 15 seconds into the game. \nMissing starting quarterback Jawan Nobles to an injury suffered late in last week’s loss at Pebblebrook, Campbell went backwards on its first three possessions, ending the first quarter with seven yards of total offense. \n“We had to watch the film a couple of times to figure it out,” Newnan head coach Mike McDonald said of Nobles. “We weren’t quite sure, but then we saw him on the sidelines.” \nThe Cougars, meanwhile, needed five plays to put together a 62-yard scoring drive on its second possession, which ended on a six-yard quarterback keeper up the middle by senior Chancellor Johnson. \nA short Spartans punt that was returned to their own 22 yard line gave Newnan a chance to tack on a third score in the period, needing three snaps and an offsides penalty on Campbell on third-and-short to make it 21-0 Cougars after Darryel Hines’ 10-yard touchdown. \nFrom there, however, the Spartans finally began to move the ball, picking up their initial four first downs on a 15-play drive that reached the Newnan 3-yard line before Campbell went backwards. Four consecutive plays, including a pair of sacks, racked up a loss of 37 yards, and the march ended with the Spartans punting the ball from the Newnan 40 on fourth-and-goal. \nEight penalties and a pair of interceptions marred Campbell’s effort despite dominating time of possession in the second quarter. \n“They hogged it there in the second quarter,” McDonald said. “But we didn’t let them get in. That was big.” \nThe Cougars managed just five snaps in the second quarter. Hill was ruled to have fumbled on a drive to the Spartans’ 25-yard line on a play where the senior clearly looked to have been down. \nCampbell, however, took advantage of the break by starting an even longer possession. \nA 20-play drive back inside the Newnan 10-yard line saw the Spartans complete three consecutive fourth-down conversions, the first on a fake punt on their own 30. A pair of Cougar penalties for pass interference and offsides tacked on with a 14-yard run by Kendall Lawrence set up first-and-goal again at the Newnan 10-yard line. \nAgain, though, the drive came up short, with Bigsby unable to slice a pass to receiver Michael Lyons on a slant route in the end zone. \nDespite Campbell having the ball for most of the first half, Newnan — with three first downs — outgained the Spartans by a 144-83 margin at halftime. Cougars senior quarterback Chancellor Johnson finished 6-for-8 passing for 73 yards on an effort that included a leaping 21-yard grab by Marquan Hill near the Newnan sidelines for a first down. \nWith the team ahead 21-0 at halftime, Marquan’s older brother Marquis closed out a 152-yard rushing effort with a seven-yard run in the third quarter that pushed a 28-point lead. \nThe Cougars finished with four sacks and K.D. Satterwhite and Eric Russell came up with interceptions that squashed back-to-back Campbell possessions to open the fourth quarter. \nRad Wyrick, who was a perfect 4-for-4 on PATs, closed out a march dominated by Newnan second-team offense following Russell’s pick, by chipping a 22-yard field-goal through the uprights with 5:09 to play for a 31-0 advantage. \nThe Spartans were unable to end the shutout bid until Bigsby connected with receiver Trey Wilson from 27 yards with 1:22 left in the game. \nCougars 31, Spartans 6 \nCampbell 0 0 0 6 — 6 \nNewnan 21 0 7 3 — 31 \n1st Quarter \nN — Marquis Hill 73 run (Rad Wyrick kick), 11:45 \nN — Chancellor Johnson 6 run (Wyrick kick), 6:09 \nN — Darryel Hines 10 run (Wyrick kick), 3:40 \n3rd Quarter \nN — Hill 7 run (Wyrick kick), 5:37 \n4th Quarter \nN — Rad Wyrick 22-yard field goal, 5:09 \nC — Trey Wilson 27-yard pass from Marcus Bigsby (pass failed), 1:22 More", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T09:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T23:51:50.648+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
