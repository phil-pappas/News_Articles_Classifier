(Photo: Wilfredo Lee, AP) \nSUNRISE, Fla. The door was closed for several minutes. \nNo screaming was audible. General manager Ron Hextall, who threw a trash can and went on a profanity-laden tirade after Game 17 last season, was calm as he walked into the coach’s room with his briefcase. \nInside the locker room, the Flyers were holding a players-only meeting. \n“It’s Game 2,” Mark Streit said. “You lose 7-1, we’ve got to have a little talk here, no?” \nNot even seven minutes had gone by before the Flyers found themselves down 4-0, the quickest four-goal deficit suffered in club history. Outside of being injured, it was the worst 10 minutes goalie Steve Mason has had as a Flyer. \nHe turned the puck over for half of the four goals on eight shots he allowed, one of them an empty-netter. \n“Right from the beginning, there was nothing I could be too proud of tonight,” Mason said. “I take full responsibility for this loss. Short memory, put it behind me and re-focus.” \nHe had plenty of time to do it the rest of the game, watching as Michal Neuvirth allowed another three goals on 22 shots. When it was all said and done, Jaromir Jagr scored a pair of goals. So did Reilly Smith. Vincent Trocheck had a career-high four points. \n“We had a bad start,” said Jake Voracek. “We got scored on four times. I think the only thing we did good was that we put a lot of pucks on net. That was the only positive thing. It wasn’t a good game. They beat our (rear ends). We’ve just got to make sure we give it to them on Monday.” \nYes, the Flyers have another date with the Panthers Monday for the home opener. \n“It’s a good thing we don’t have a week off,” Voracek quipped. \nThe Flyers will skate, and skate and skate and skate in a Sunday practice when most of the players would probably rather be watching football. They didn’t have a morning skate Saturday, instead going for a 10 a.m. two-mile run on the beach in Fort Lauderdale. \nBeing eager to quickly leave South Florida is a rare occurrence, but after the stinker of a performance the Flyers had against the Panthers, that’s how they felt. \n“For me it’s tough to explain because we had a really good game in Tampa against a really good team,” Streit said. “Had a good start. Had a really good 60 minutes and got a point. Tonight it was like a different team out there. We have to be ready. We have to be ready to compete, to skate. If you’re not ready, if you don’t skate, if you don’t have a good gap out there, if you’re not aggressive enough, they’re going to take advantage of it. And they did. We didn’t skate. We took penalties. They took advantage of it.” \nEverybody seemed to have regrets in the beating. The players regretted taking penalties, not skating. The coach, Dave Hakstol, regretted not calling timeout after the Panthers’ second goal, which came 4:55 into the game. \n“It’s early in the year,” said Hakstol, whose legendary stare to disappointing players during his days at the University of North Dakota probably made its NHL debut. “The one thing that’s absolute is that no one is going to overreact. You take this situation and deal with it for what it is and deal with it honestly. Most of those dealings will take place in the locker room.” \nAlthough the Flyers were better in the second period, outshooting Florida 13-6, they got nothing for it. Those shots came from the perimeter with little traffic in front of goalie Roberto Luongo, who made 38 saves on the night. \nThe Flyers, who didn’t get much love from pundits in preseason predictions, think they are a team more indicative of their overtime loss to the reigning Eastern Conference champions on Thursday than the one that got walloped by a crew that missed last year’s playoffs Saturday night. \n“We have a good team in here,” Mason said. “We have a good coach, good systems. I put this one on myself tonight. There’s no way around it. it wasn’t a good effort and I know that. Nobody else should be feeling sorry for themselves. We’re not going to feel sorry for ourselves. We just have to be better. Starting with me.” \nDave Isaac; (856) 486-2479; disaac@gannettnj.com . 2 CONNECT 7 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://on.cpsj.com/1RArKEP TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T05:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T00:17:06.278+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
