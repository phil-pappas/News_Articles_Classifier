(For OzarksSportsZone.com) -- For the first 67 minutes, Tuesday's match between Nixa and Carthage felt eerily familiar. Nixa's Brady Harrison made sure history didn't repeat itself. With both teams scoreless late in the second half, Harrison hit a flop shot over Carthage goalkeeper Dorian Ordonez to help propel the Eagles to a 1-0 victory. CLICK HERE FOR PHOTOS The two area heavyweights met just over two weeks ago in the Kickapoo Shootout semifinals, where each team scored a goal in the final minute of play to send the game into overtime. Nixa was able to capitalize in the overtime period for a 2-1 victory. Not wanting to rely on last-second heroics a second time, the Eagles worked a long-toss throw in from Trustin Baker to perfection.\"Trustin had a long throw-in,\" Harrison said. \"And then it got lost and hit off one of the Carthage defenders. I turned my back to the goal, settled it with my knee and kicked it over my head. The goalie started to come out at the six, and it went right over his head ... there was nothing he could do about it.\" The goal broke open a game that was, for the most part, controlled by the Tigers. Carthage utilized a pinpoint possession attack with the ball, and then swarmed to the ball on the defensive end. Time and time again, the quicker Carthage defenders thwarted would-be attacks from the Eagles. After escaping with a narrow win earlier, Nixa head coach Evan Palmer knew the game would be a dogfight.\"Carthage is so organized and so great on the ball,\" Palmer said. \"Just their possession is so tough to break down. In the first half, we were going forward and getting some chances, but we were just chasing. The goal in the second half was to up our defensive pressure on them and make them give up the ball a little more. We didn't have our best attacking night, but we hung together, played together and just waited for that chance ... and then Brady took advantage of it.\" For Carthage and coach Jacob Osborne, a momentary lapse of focus late in the game turned a clearance opportunity into a game-winning goal for the opposition.\"Nixa's most dangerous, consistent offensive weapon has been the long throw,\" Osborne said. \"That's what had me most concerned, because they were having some scary looks off that. We wern't getting headers on it, and we're not a big team. We talked at half time about getting bodies on players and getting clearance. In that opportunity, we didn't get it.\" Despite the outcome, both coaches pointed to the advantages gained from big games played late in the season.\"This game was a district-type atmosphere,\" Palmer said. \"We're going to see those kinds of teams in the post-season, so it's a great way to get ready for that for both teams. It's tough to beat a team like Carthage, and we were able to get them twice this year, which is a huge accomplishment.\" Carthage(14-7) returns to the pitch on Wednesday with a home matchup against Carl Junction, while Nixa (18-1) hosts Branson on Thursday.
