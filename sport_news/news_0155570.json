Georgia and Gibraltar cannot qualify. The top two in each group qualify, as does the best third-placed team from all the groups, while the other eight third-placed finishers enter a playoff. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T14:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T14:55:42.416+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
