He stopped working because he was very nervous. My mother was also at home running around the home alone,” Ramos-Vinolas said. \n“I just spoke with my girlfriend, my father, my mother, my fitness coach, my other coach who is travelling when Jose is not coming. Now at night I will try to answer all the messages,” he added. \nRamos-Vinolas has never won a tournament on the men’s tour and has only ever come out on top of three Grand Slam matches — compared to Federer's record-breaking 17 major titles. \nThe Barcelona-born player also celebrated his first victory over a top 10 opponent. In their only previous meeting, at Wimbledon 2012, Federer was a convincing 6-1, 6-1, 6-1 winner. \n“Before the match I thought I'm not going to win. But when I saw how I was playing, it was not the same as Wimbledon,” he said. “It was my first Wimbledon. I didn’t feel comfortable during the match. \n“But here, when I saw that we were very, very similar during the first set, I thought, ‘Okay, maybe I can do a good match.’ \n“But after the second set, I thought was not possible because he was serving so good. He was winning very easy the games on his serve. \n“But... at the end after the break, I thought, Okay, maybe I can do it. Let's try to be concentrate. I won the match.” — AFP", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T17:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T18:45:10.330+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
