Every time she thought she had a breakaway to the goal, the official’s flag went up. \n“I just heard a little whistle in the background,” Daigle said. \nIt became a joke on the field. How many was Daigle up to? 10? 15? 20? \nThat only pushed her more, and eventually Daigle found her timing, tallying a natural hat trick to lead the Thunderbolts to a 4-1 victory over the Fighting Clan. \n“I kind of just wanted to prove to myself that I could do it because I had (other players asking) how many is that? 11? I’m like you know what, I’m going to score off one of these and then they’re not going to say anything.” Millville Girls Soccer wins 3-1 over Ocean City \nDaigle’s performance lifted Millville (10-1) to its 11th straight win over Vineland (3-8). The Thunderbolts’ last loss to the Fighting Clan was a 5-4 setback on Sept. 20, 2010. \n“They look forward to it,” Millville coach Brian Sloan said. “They mark it down on their calendars, this is the first game we’re playing Vineland, this is the second game we’re playing Vineland, it’s really neat for them, especially the seniors. … It’s such a tradition and such a neat rivalry. I know they dominated for many years, we’ve been doing really well the last few years, and it’s a great experience for them.” \nThe Fighting Clan looked like they might end their lengthy losing streak during the first half. Over the first 30 minutes, they dominated possession, out-shot and out-cornered the Thunderbolts. \nHowever, they still trailed 1-0 because of Amber Raines’ goal in the 12th minute. \n“Brooke (Muhlbaier) sent it from the 50 and I got on a breakaway and I saw the goalie come out, so I just cut it to the left, and I almost over cut it, and then I kind of drew it back and I slid and scored,” Raines said. \n“We played awesome,” Vineland coach Amy Ardito said of her team’s performance early on. “It was there, even though it was 1-0 at the time.” Girls soccer: Lauren Reed set to lead Millville defense \nThe Fighting Clan just couldn’t find the back of the net. Millville goalie Imani Gaines made six first-half saves, the biggest coming about three minutes after Raines goal. \nVineland’s Sarah Patrignani took a great feed from Cate Scanlon in the heart of the box, but couldn’t get the ball past Gaines. \n“That was a crazy save,” Gaines said. “She shot it real hard and I’m like I have to get it. My legs were kind of together and I saved the ball.” \nWith the Fighting Clan struggling to finish, the door was open for Millville to take advantage, and Daigle did. \nShe ended her offsides streak with just under 10 minutes to play in the opening half, beating Vineland keeper Bella Fiorenza high for a 2-0 lead, and scored again three minutes later to give the Bolts a 3-0 advantage. \n“That made me feel a lot better about myself,” she said. \nDaigle’s final marker was a thing of beauty, as she juked around Vineland’s top defender Alyssa Nanni and goalie Molly Atkinson to give her squad a 4-0 lead with just under 29 minutes remaining in the game. \n“She’s really emerging as a top forward in the conference,” Sloan said. Girls soccer notebook: Defense stands out for Schalick \nVineland finally got on the board midway through the second half when freshman Siera Rivera scored on a direct kick. However, the Fighting Clan were unable to get any closer. \n“I’m heartbroken because at this point on paper, we don’t look like the team we really are, but the bottom line is we have to put the ball in the net,” Ardito said. “If you look at our book, we had over 30 shots, 30 opportunities to score.” \nShe added later, “It’s just unfortunate. It’s very very very upsetting at this point.” \nJosh Friedman; (856) 563-5257; jfriedman2@gannettnj.com 69 CONNECT 9 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://vineland.dj/1LuAewk TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T03:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T13:02:46.140+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
