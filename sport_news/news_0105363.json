Same could be said for College of the Sequoias. Both teams are in need of a win, if not for their Valley Conference standing, then for their mental well-being. The Mustangs (2-4, 0-1) play the Giants (4-2, 0-1) at 7 p.m. today at the Mineral King Bowl in Visalia. Delta was beaten soundly last week 56-20 by Chabot in its conference opener at home, while Sequoias lost its conference opener 56-0 at Modesto. The Giants gave up an average of 18 points in their first four games — all victories. In their last two, they’ve given up 50 points on average and were shut out both times. Mustangs coach Gary Barlow said his team was beaten in all three phases of last week’s game — offense, defense and special teams. Quarterback Phillip Kimble was under pressure many times he dropped back and struggled with his accuracy, Chabot’s Jose Ferreira threw for a season-high four touchdowns and the Gladiators recovered a blocked punt for a touchdown. Barlow said part of the defense’s problem was not trusting its assignments and being distracted. “We had some ‘dirty eyes’ as far as that goes, where we weren’t keying on our responsibility,” he said. “We tried to do a little too much.” Evan Owens rushed for 115 yards, his third consecutive game with more than 100 yards. He’s ninth statewide in rushing yards per game with 99.8. “We have to maximize the things that are going good,” Barlow said. “Evan and Phillip are doing some really good things offensively, and we have to continue to let them make plays and give them the opportunity to do what they do well.” — Contact sports reporter Bob Highfill at (209) 546-8282 or bhighfill@recordnet.com.
