(AP Photo/Elaine Thompson, File) Duck hunting season is under way in the state of Washington. If the Washington Husky football team is going to bag some Oregon Ducks for the first time since 2003, Saturday night could be the best opportunity. Oddsmakers actually like the homestanding Dawgs by two points over the guys from Eugene.The Northwest schools will meet for the 108th time at Alaska Airlines Field, Husky Stadium. It’s a 7:30 p.m. kickoff with pre-game coverage starting at 2:30 p.m. on KOMO AM-1000/FM-97.7.To have a true rivalry, both schools must be evenly matched. That has been far from the case during Oregon’s 11-game win streak over Washington. The narrowest margin of victory for the Ducks has been 17 points. This year the Ducks seem ripe for the picking, having lost three games, shockingly two of them at home to Utah (62-20), and last Saturday to Washington State, (45-38, 2ot).Washington is coming off the most significant victory of coach Chris Petersen’s tenure, upsetting 17th ranked USC 17-12 in the Los Angeles Coliseum. The Husky defense was on point, and will need a similar, if not better performance against the Ducks scoring machine, averaging 41.5 points per game.“Those guys aren’t down, they are going to come up here and fight,” said UW linebacker Travis Feeney. “They’ve lost what two close games, and only one blow-out game. We know they’re going to come out to punch and come out to fight. They’re definitely not a bad team at all.”Feeney earned Pac-12 defensive player of the week honors for his effort against the Trojans. Unfortunately the Huskies won’t have the services of leading tackler Azeem Victor for the first half of the Oregon game. He was ejected from the USC game for targeting quarterback Cody Kessler.Scott Lawyer, Sean Constantine and freshman Ben Burr-Kirvin will be asked to hold down the fort until Victor is eligible to play in the second half. Easier said than done against what many consider the best tandem of running backs in the country, powerful Royce Freeman, and speed-burner Taj Griffin.“Coach Petersen called them thunder and lightning, and that’s what they are,” observed Washington linebackers coach Bob Gregory. “Those guys are very good. First guy misses, we better have two, three, and four guys thearlere to help wrap him up.”The Ducks passing attack has suffered with quarterback Vernon Adams absence nursing a hand injury. The tranfer from Eastern Washington University is expected back for Saturday’s game.Oregon’s glaring weakness this season has been its defense, giving up nearly 39 points and 475-yards-per game. Washington offensive coordinator Jonathan Smith took plenty of notes from WSU’s victory over the Ducks, watching the Cougars pick on Oregon’s younger, smaller cornerbacks.“The Cougs are going to go after corners, no matter who you have out there. They (Oregon) have some guys they’ve mixed and matched out there, but at the same time we are pretty young on the perimeter. That will be a part of the game.”Huskies freshman quarterback Jake Browning missed some wide open receivers on deep passes in the USC game. If given the same opportunities against Oregon he’ll need to make the connection to force the Ducks honor the run game. More important for Washington’s chances of victory is for the offense to stay on the field for lengthy, time-consuming drives.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T23:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T09:10:01.825+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
