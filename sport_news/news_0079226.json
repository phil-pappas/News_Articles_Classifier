Pennsbury slipped to 6-2 and 4-1. \nAfter Isabella's TD burst gave the visitors a 21-8 cushion, the Falcons closed to within 21-14 on fullback Chris Rupprecht's 2-yard dive early in the fourth quarter. \nBut North Penn immediately responded on Reece Udinski's 67-yard TD connection to wideout Jake Hubler. On a play the Pennsbury coaches believed should have been wiped out by a false-start penalty, Hubler broke at least two tackles en route to paydirt. \nRefusing to go away quietly, the Falcons, who netted 202 rushing yard on 56 attempts, countered with a 13-play scoring drive. Alley's 11-yard pass to Luke Snyder made it 27-20 with 3 minutes to go. \nIn leading North Penn to its 15th straight victory over Pennsbury, Udinski completed 13 of 19 passes for 259 yards. Tailback Nyfease West, returning from an injury, ran for scores of 2 and 3 yards in the first half. \nUdinski, who was sacked five times, completed throws of 15, 9, 21, and 17 yards to set the stage for West's second tally. The junior signal-caller was 11 for 14 for 181 yards before intermission. \nNorth Penn 6 8 7 6 - 27 \nPennsbury 0 8 6 6 - 20 \nNP: Nyfease West 2 run (kick failed) \nP: Mike Alley 32 run (Chris Rupprecht run) \nNP: Nyfease West 3 run (Owen Thomas pass from Reece Udinski) \nNP: Nick Isabella 14 run (Kelly Macnamara kick) \nP: Rupprecht 2 run (kick failed) \nNP: Jake Hubler 67 pass from Reece Udinski (kick blocked) \nP: Luke Snyder 11 pass from Alley (run failed)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T05:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T06:09:21.918+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
