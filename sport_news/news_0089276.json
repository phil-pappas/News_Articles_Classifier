(Eddie Moore/Albuquerque Journal)\nYou see it all over town – as you should, with Santa Fe having the reputation of being a world-renowned center for the arts.\nThere are murals, such as Zara Kriegstein’s “Judicial History of Santa Fe,” which hangs at the city’s magistrate court; sculptures, such as Colette Hosmer’s “Santa Fe Current,” the 27 granite trout emerging from a pool of gravel between City Hall and the convention center; and statues, such as the one in a park at Paseo de Peralta and Marcy Street of painter Tommy Macaione, whose own work is also part of the city’s Art in Public Places collection.\nAltogether, the city owns 75 art objects valued at about $1.8 million.\nBut the Art in Public Places program is looking to do something different with the $360,000 in capital improvement money it controls.\nWhat that will buy, exactly, is unclear.\n“I think it’s an exciting opportunity to make a more dynamic impact in the community and do that by engaging the community,” said Debra Garcia y Griego, director of Santa Fe’s Arts Commission, which oversees the Art in Public Places program. “So we’re working on developing recommendations to pilot. All of the pilots that we’re looking at are methods that are allowed in the existing ordinance. But they are not approaches we’ve taken in the past.”\nJoe Tyler designed this bus shelter along Airport Road in Santa Fe. (Eddie Moore/Albuquerque Journal)\nSome potential pilot projects were briefly discussed at a recent Arts Commission meeting, but none arose as favorites. In fact, the Arts in Public Places subcommittee is tasked with making recommendations to the Arts Commission, which are due next month.\nGarcia y Griego explained to the commission at its Sept. 14 meeting that, under the current ordinance, money must be spent on art installations that are permanent. That leaves out music and performing arts.\n“It can’t fund a dance, but it can fund a painting of someone dancing,” she said.\nShe also pointed out that the program was established 30 years ago. Since then, whole new art genres have emerged.\nChanging the ordinance is an option, she said, but the commission isn’t fixated on that right now. Garcia y Griego said it’s a good ordinance, with money for the purchase of public art coming from 2 percent of revenue bond proceeds and allowing for a good deal of flexibility in how it’s spent.\nWhat it doesn’t do, however, is fund maintenance. So metal sculptures located outdoors, for instance, are subject to corrosion.\nWhile not restricted by the ordinance, Garcia y Griego said the commission has always focused on purchasing public art at specific sites, such as the south side library. The problem with that, she said, is that it discourages many studio artists and galleries from participating and limits community engagement.\n“So we’re looking to try to find ways to spend that money in ways that will work across our policy planks,” she said.\nThose policy planks are: youth arts, economic growth, creative spaces and community.\nGarcia y Griego said options include using microgrants to fund smaller projects, or pooling money with the 1 percent lodger’s tax allocation earmarked for nonprofit art activities that help promote tourism.\nThe commission has looked across the country to identify potential concepts that would fit into the framework.\nOne commission member brought up public art projects now underway in North Charleston, S.C., where a juried sculpture exhibition at its Riverfront Park offers more than $16,000 in honoraria and awards, and Lawrence, Kan., where a $500,000 grant is funding its Ninth Street Corridor Project, which aims to revitalize a historic part of town by transforming it into a cultural district.\nThe commission was also impressed by Nashville’s “Thrive,” a funding program “designed to encourage artistic development, engage neighborhood art-making, open up and re-imagine places, and inspire and activate the imagination through shared experiences,” according to the city’s website.\nAlso mentioned at the meeting was “Irrigate,” an initiative in Minneapolis-St. Paul emphasizing “cross-sector collaboration with local private and non-profit sectors to build social and economic capital by engaging local artists, neighborhoods and businesses.”\nGarcia y Griego said such efforts serve as models for pilot or prototype programs Santa Fe could try out in the coming year.\n“It gives us an opportunity to try out things in a meaningful way,” she said.\nAsked about how Santa Fe arts collaborative Meow Wolf might play a part in these goals, Garcia y Griego said there may be parallels between what the city and Meow Wolf, which started as a nonprofit but has switched to a for-profit venture with the development of its immersive multimedia production of the “House of Eternal Return,” are trying to accomplish.\n“We’re going to have to let things unfold to see where our work goes and where theirs goes,” she said. “Obviously, they could be a potential partner. But right now we don’t have anything in particular in mind.”\nThe Arts Commission has already partnered with the city’s Public Works and Parks and Recreation departments on projects. The waveform railing at Botulph Road, by Aaron Craig, and the gazebo design by Catherine Widgery at De Vargas Park are examples.\nPosed as he once appeared in life, this sculpture of painter Thomas Macione, titled “El Diferente,” by Mac Vaughan, is in Hillside Park. (Eddie Moore/Albuquerque Journal)\nAlso in the works, Garcia y Griego said, are art projects along the Acequia Trail and the yet-to-be-built bicycle/pedestrian underpass at St. Francis Drive near Cerrillos Road. She said she expects public art will be placed in the newly opened SWAN park.\nAnother option would be to add to the public art already on display at the Santa Fe Community Convention Center. Randy Randal, executive director of Tourism Santa Fe, would like to see that happen.\n“It becomes a focal point for visitors and locals …,” he said of the public art on display. “Here we are a premier city for art. We have to make sure we have art out in the open for people to see.”\nAsked if he had any recommendations for the Arts Commission, Randal said, “Yeah, buy the Dan Namingha piece.”\nNamingha, a Hopi-Tewa painter and sculptor living in Santa Fe, currently has his bronze sculpture “Dualities” displayed in front of the convention center’s courtyard entrance through the Arts Commission’s Art on Loan program.\nRandal, whose job it is to attract visitors to Santa Fe and promote its assets, said public art does more than just please the eye. It communicates our city’s identity.\n“We claim to be one of the best arts markets in the country. We need to walk that talk,” he said. “It makes statements about who we are and what we are as a city.”", "external_links": ["http://main.abqjournal.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/jn01_jd_02oct_art3-640x425.jpg", "http://main.abqjournal.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/jn01_jd_02oct_art1-400x269.jpg", "http://main.abqjournal.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/jn01_jd_02oct_art2-400x275.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-02T08:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T20:06:46.475+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
