Ebenhack Associated Press Buccaneers quarterback Jameis Winston scrambles for yardage in front of Panthers defensive tackle Kawann Short during last Sunday's game in Tampa. Videos Read the latest Jaguars coverage \nS peaking to several hundred reporters in February at the NFL Scouting Combine, former Florida State quarterback Jameis Winston couldn’t hide his enthusiasm about being able to focus entirely on football. \n“This is the first time I’ve had an off-season, and I love just putting everything into this,” he said. “I’m a quarterback. This is what I do.” \nEight months later and now the face of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers’ franchise, Winston’s opinion hasn’t changed. \n“It’s been great,” he said earlier this week. “I love football, I love my job, and it’s been great just being a quarterback year-round.” \nBut Winston, who went 26-1 for the Seminoles, hasn’t loved the results. \nTampa Bay is 1-3 entering Sunday’s game against the 1-3 Jaguars, and Winston’s results have been typical for a rookie quarterback. \nThe good: An NFC South road win at New Orleans. \nThe bad: A 71.2 passer rating, second-worst among quarterbacks who have started all of their team’s games. \nThe ugly: Five turnovers — four interceptions and one lost fumble — in last week’s 37-23 loss to Carolina. \nIn the last 25 years, Winston is the eighth quarterback to be selected first overall and start in Week 1. That group includes an all-time great (Peyton Manning) and one who could-be-an-all-timer (Andrew Luck), but it also includes David Carr and Sam Bradford. \nBuccaneers coach Lovie Smith and the organization knew what they were getting into by giving Winston the immediate starting spot. To help his transition, they hired veteran offensive coordinator Dirk Koetter, whose previous stops include the Jaguars; fortified their offensive line with two second-round draft picks; committed to having running back Doug Martin carry a big load, and centered the passing game around dynamic receivers Vincent Jackson and Mike Evans. \nThrough four games, Winston’s seven interceptions are tied for the NFL lead, but he also has six touchdown passes. \n“Jameis is everything we expected and wanted him to be,” said Smith, whose tenure in Chicago included coaching Rex Grossman, Kyle Orton, Brian Griese and Jay Cutler. “We’re not basing an awful lot of who we are on [last week’s loss]; it wasn’t good enough. But we couldn’t be happier with Jameis as our quarterback and being our quarterback of the future.” \nJaguars coach Gus Bradley said: “You see flashes of why he was picked when he was.” SLOW START NO SURPRISE \nBased on his record, Winston is ahead of Drew Bledsoe and Manning, the top picks in 1993 and 1998, respectively. Bledsoe’s Patriots and Manning’s Colts started with 0-4 marks. \nBased on his touchdown total (six), Winston is ahead of Manning and Matthew Stafford (three apiece), Bledsoe and Carr (four each) and Cam Newton (five), equal to Bradford and behind Luck (seven). \nJust about every rookie quarterback is going to have the train-wreck kind of game Winston did last week. Jaguars quarterback Blake Bortles’ fifth start was low-lighted by two interceptions returned for touchdowns by Miami. \nHow young passers learn and bounce back divides the franchise quarterbacks from the journeymen. \n“You can only go up,” Winston said of the loss to Carolina. \nLast year, Bortles learned from the mistakes and cleaned up his decision making; he had 12 interceptions in his first six games and only five in his last eight games. This year, he has only three interceptions in 156 pass attempts. \nWinston’s seven interceptions can be divided into four categories: \nBad eyes (two): Winston locked onto his target, resulting in touchdowns by Tennessee’s Coty Sensabaugh and Carolina’s Josh Norman. \nBad throws/decisions (three): Against Houston, Winston threw into double coverage looking for Jackson and was picked off by safety Quintin Demps. Against Carolina, he threw behind Jackson for Norman’s second interception and appeared fooled by a Panthers’ disguise and was intercepted by Thomas Davis on a pass for Evans. \nBad fundamentals (one): Winston’s second interception against the Titans occurred when he didn’t loft a screen pass high enough and it was caught by Deiontrez Mount. \nBad luck (one): Winston threw a quick slant to Jackson that was deflected and intercepted by the Panthers’ Kurt Coleman. \nWinston’s six touchdowns have measured 5, 41, 15, 32, 10 and 6 yards. \n“I’m adjusting to the game, trying to get better at something every week,” Winston said. “Last week [before the Carolina game], we talked about third down, and we were way better on third down [8 of 16]. Every week, I’m trying to work on something, and from now on, I have to work on not turning the ball over. \n“That’s an easy thing [to work on], because if I don’t, it’s going to be bad.” \nNot bad, by all accounts, has been Winston’s approach to the pro game. He has eliminated the off-field behavior that made him a target for criticism during his two years at Florida State. \n“The [Winston] I knew in college, I think he’s matured from being that guy,” said Jaguars linebacker Telvin Smith, a former FSU teammate. \nSaid Lovie Smith: “The chemistry [with teammates] has been great. He’s a likeable guy, you believe in him, and you trust him as your leader.” FORCING THE ISSUE \nThe Jaguars should expect Tampa Bay to emphasize Martin early. In the first quarter of the Buccaneers’ games, they have 28 rushes and 10 Winston drop-backs on first and second downs. \n“They’re going to try and establish the run, so we have to put our big-boy pants on,” the Jaguars’ Telvin Smith said. \nBut the Jaguars rank fourth against the run and first in average yards allowed per carry, so they hope to put Winston into second-and-long and third-and-at-least-medium situations. \n“[Winston is] having a tough time of late, but still, he has all the ability to be a very good quarterback,” said Jaguars linebacker Paul Posluszny, listed as questionable to play because of an ankle injury. “He’s made all of the throws an NFL quarterback needs to make.” \nPosluszny said it will be “interesting” to see how the Buccaneers script their opening-drive plays after so many turnovers last week. \n“When a quarterback goes through a situation like that, it’s, ‘We’re going to run the ball and make things easier for him with screens and less risky throws,’ ” Posluszny said. “We’ll have to see how they come out and attack us. We need to look for opportunities to make something happen.” \nThe Jaguars forced two turnovers but still lost at Indianapolis, and they have only one interception in four games. If Winston plays a clean game out of the gate, he and the Bucs offense will gain confidence. \n“The Saints game was a classic [example],” Bradley said. “No interceptions and [Winston] played very well. And then [in two other games], multiple interceptions. That’s the challenge they’re going through with him. It’s a new offense and the speed of the game is a big transition.” \nThe Jaguars hope to delay Winston’s transition for at least another week. \nRyan O’Halloran: (904) 359-4401", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T02:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T16:46:05.184+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
