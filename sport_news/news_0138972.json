They have alleged due to this new tariff slab they have received increased bills up to 40-60 per cent. The opposition has already declared that they would raise their voice, following this, INLD workers would hold a protest at the district headquarters on Monday, while former Finance Minister Sampat Singh would highlight the plight of consumers on October 7 in-front of Haryana Electricity Regulatory Commission. Showing her domestic power supply bill, Veena Rani, a resident of Sector 7, said she received a bill of Rs 21,400 for two months against her last bill of Rs 10,600. Similarly, Jatin Kumar, a Sector 6 resident, said the power corporation had re-arranged slabs, in which it had brought down the units in different categories which resulted in inflated electricity bills. Rates hiked for no valid reason: Surjewala Jind: Kaithal Congress MLA and in charge of the All-India Congress Committee (AICC) communication cell Randeep Singh Surjewala today alleged that the state BJP government had silently raised the electricity rates by 40-50 per cent. He was interacting with the media at his residence in Kaithal today. He also led a protest in Kaithal city against hike of power rates. \"The state BJP government has raised power rates without any valid reason. The smallest families of the state are getting monthly power bills between Rs 6,000 and 10,000. There is no system of government to redress the genuine grievances related to power bills in the state,\" alleged Surjewala. He further alleged the senior officials of the power department were harassing the power consumers of the state as they had the support of the state government. —TNS Sampat slams power utilities, state govt Hisar: Former Finance Minister Sampat Singh said today that the state government and the power corporations were responsible for the unreasonable power tariff hike and he would challenge it in the Haryana Electricity Regulatory Commission (HERC) during the hearing on October 7. Alleging 42 per cent tariff had been hiked in the state by the incumbent government, Sampat said the DHBVN and UHBVN had filed a petition in HERC for raising the tariff by 15 per cent. \"Charging in the name of sundry expenses to recover the arrears of the tariff hike is like rubbing salt on the wounds of the consumers. It's wrong on part of the power corporations to do so with retrospective effect, as they announced to raise the tariff by an order on May 7 which was applicable from April 1,\" he said. —TNS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T12:27:35.552+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
