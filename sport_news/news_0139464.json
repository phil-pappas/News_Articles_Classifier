The 28-year-old, already a winner of two joint-sanctioned events at the Malaysian Open and Indian Open, drove the ball and hit his irons well, but once again his putting was the concern. After bogeying his last hole on the first day, Lahiri was bogey-free on the second with three birdies and moved to a six-under 134 to be three shots behind former US Open winner Justin Rose (65-66). Jeev Milkha Singh, needing a Top-3 finish to earn his card for 2016, was hit by a double bogey and shot an even par 70 after a 65 on the first day to move to a five-under 135 and give himself a chance over the weekend. Tied with Jeev was Gaganjeet Bhullar, who continued his comeback with a fine 66 to go with his 69 on the first day for a total of a five-under 135. Singh and Bhullar were both tied 10th, while Rahil Gangjee, starting the day with bogeys on the first and third, salvaged the round with a 70 and with a total of 136, he is tied 17th. Also tied 17th was SSP Chawrasia, fighting to get his European Tour card back. He overcame two bogeys on the front nine to finish with a 70 and a total of 136. Jyoti Randhawa (70-70) just squeezed inside the cutline, which fell at even par, with 76 players making it. Shiv Kapur (70-72) and Arjun Atwal (73-71) exited at the halfway stage with 142 and 144, respectively. Lahiri, who found eight out of 14 fairways on the first day, found 13 out of 14 on the second day. He was superb with his approaches on the second day as he missed just one green in regulation compared to his 14 out of 18 greens on the first day. But putting continued to be a concern as he needed 30 putts on the first day and 32 on the second. Yet, he did not have a single three-putt. Lahiri said, “I am playing good, I feel I am playing some of my best golf in terms of how I am hitting it, but obviously I am not scoring. I am in a good spot and I should have been easily in double digits. I need to get into some putting form over the weekend and then I get into the mix. If I keep hitting like this, then I will give myself some chances.” As for his expectations, he added, “I expect myself to go out and do my best.” On the narrow layout, he said, “I love playing narrow type of courses; it is great because you have to think and navigate your way.” Rose opened up a one-shot lead at the halfway stage but admitted he had one eye just down the leaderboard at Ryder Cup teammate Ian Poulter. Rose followed up his opening 65 with a 66 to get to nine-under at Hong Kong Golf Club and establish a slender advantage over Lucas Bjerregaard (66-66) with Poulter (67-66) and Lu Wei-chih (64-69) a further shot back. Korea’s YE Yang was also among the five players bunched in equal fifth place on 134. — PTI", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T20:02:59.712+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
