This is still a very young partnership and lots will change over the winter and we'll be more competitive next year,\" he added. \nButton, who is the most experienced driver on the current grid, said the sport was changing and the future looked bright. \n\"I don't know if I'll be racing in 2017 or 18, but it looks very exciting, which is something the sport and the fans should be excited about,\" he said. \n\"There's definitely no fear of leaving F1. I'm here because I want to be here and this team is going to be competitive in the future, and that's the reason why I want to stay.\" (Reporting by Alan Baldwin, editing by Pritha Sarkar) Trending On Reuters", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T20:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T01:17:13.797+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
