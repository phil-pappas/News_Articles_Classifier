PSU could take some positives from the defeat as they battled the Buckeyes for three quarters and only trailed by 11 after 45 minutes of play. Christian Hackenberg was pretty banged up and was even more immobile than normal so the Nittany Lions had to rely very heavily on the running game. Saquon Barkley answered the bell as he returned from injury to run for 194 yards on 26 carries. I’ve been incredibly impressed with the speed and vision of Barkley and I think he can have an absolute field day in Baltimore. That’s right, this game is listed as a home game for the Terps but it’s being played in Baltimore and there should be plenty of blue and white in the crowd. \nIt’s difficult to analyze the Maryland Terrapins (2-4, 0-2) because they are coming off of a bye week and they will be playing their first game without Randy Edsall at the helm. Edsall was fired after the Terps were blitzed by the Ohio State Buckeyes on October 10. While a bump in performance is certainly possible, it shouldn’t be assumed that replacing Randy Edsall with Mike Locksley is going to magically turn this season around. \nThe best part of both offenses would be the rushing attack. Maryland has the 4th ranked running game (according to S&P+) while Penn State has the 42nd ranked running game. That number would be significantly better if Saquon Barkley would have been healthy and getting the majority of the carries. Barkley is a true difference maker and he’s currently averaging 8.3 yards on 68 carries. While Penn State has a pretty stout rush defense (along with an elite pass defense), the Maryland Terrapins are only 55th in rushing defense and I expect Penn State to lean heavily on Barkley and Akeel Lynch to churn out this victory. Maryland relies on Brandon Ross , a big back that I don’t expect to be able to break through the sturdy duo of Anthony Zettel and Austin Johnson , and quarterback Perry Hills to carry the rock. In short, both teams want to run the ball. I feel much better about the more explosive Barkley than I do about Ross and Hills and I feel better about the Penn State run defense than I do Maryland’s. \nA big advantage for Penn State is their pass rush, mainly Carl Nassib , going against a mediocre Maryland offensive line. Nassib is having a ridiculous season as he already has 11.5 sacks and 15.5 tackles for loss. According to Football Outsiders, the Penn State defensive line creates more “Havoc” than any line in the country. The secondary is elite and the defensive line has done a nice job of stopping the run and harassing passers. Maryland has a couple of decent defensive linemen in Yannick Ngakoue and Quinton Jefferson but I don’t think they can create near the problems that Ohio State did for Hackenberg last week and I like the ability of Chris Godwin to make a play when it’s necessary. \nPenn State isn’t likely to blow many teams out and it’s a bit scary to bet against a team that has gone through so much change that we haven’t seen in two weeks. However, I like the Penn State running game and their ability to stop the run and I like Penn State’s ferocious pass rush and think it’s likely they will cause major issues for Maryland’s offensive line. \nTo Read More From Sammy Jacobs, TJ Inman & Nick Holmes of HoosierHuddle.com , click here .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T09:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T14:01:42.114+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
