With Friday night’s 30-16 win over previously unbeaten Baker, the Colts clinched a playoff berth for the first time since Mark Ator left the team’s sideline after the 2011 season. They’ll be the Southern division’s wild card, kicking off at Thompson Falls next Friday at 7 p.m. \nPlaying in the ultra-competitive District 3B, Colstrip’s run to the playoffs is just as unexpected as Tucker Yates’ ascension up the Montana State depth chart. \nBut Stacey Yates isn’t surprised by either development. \n“We didn’t know if he would be starting or not, of course,” Stacey said of his 6-foot, 315-pound son, who starts at defensive tackle for the Bobcats. “But I knew with his work ethic and everything he would be in there soon. He’s got a great work ethic, very competitive. He wants to compete. Whatever it takes to compete, he’ll do.” \nLike son, like father. \nStacey carries a competitive swagger and seems to be intensely motivated. Being a high school football head coach has long been a dream of his, so when the job came open after last season he decided to throw his name in the hat. \nNaturally, he had some reservations about tackling the coaching task while his son was tackling Big Sky Conference ball-carriers, but the opportunity was too good to pass up. \nAfter coaching the middle school program in Colstrip, Yates knew what he had with this team. He credits senior leaders Thayne Hage, Lane Torgerson and Jake Sessions with making his job easy. Sessions, an offensive lineman who hoisted his 275-pound coach over his shoulder in celebrating the win over Baker, will be joining Tucker with the Bobcats next fall. \nYates also as an excellent coaching staff, noting that Tim Strobie has been with the Colts for 30 years and assistants Shane Hensleigh (Montana Tech), Andrew Torgerson (Minot State), Tanner Yates (Minot State) and Kory Austin (Montana State) all played collegiately. \n“It’s been outstanding, it’s been great,” said Yates, a 1991 Colstrip graduate. “Ups and downs of course, but it’s been awesome, especially coming to Bobcat games and then having us playing on Friday nights. Then I have another son, he’s an eighth grader, and he plays middle school games a lot. So we’re stretched thin a lot of nights. We’re running around to a lot of games, a lot of miles on the old Volkswagen. \n“It’s really pretty good, man. It’s been absolutely outstanding for me. I couldn’t be happier.” Tags", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T01:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T02:03:22.565+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
