Parrish \nDemocrat Editor \nTen times Friday night the Booneville Bearcat defense needed a third down stop. Nine times they couldn’t get it and Lamar would score on every possession to beat the Bearcats 54-7. \nIt is the worst loss in the 48-year history of Bearcat Stadium. \nThe Warriors (6-0, 3-0 Conference 3A-4) scored 74 seconds into the game on a 38-yard pass from Hunter Davenport to Blake Kern on a second-and-18 and led 7-0. \nBooneville (1-5, 0-3) had put together two first downs on their first possession but Hayden Fennell lost the football and Lamar took over at its 48. \nAfter converting third-and-8 and third-and-6 the Warriors scored on a third-and-19 on a 25-yard Dutsy Wilkins run to make it 14-0. \nCaleb Draper would force Austin Hency to fumble on the next Warrior possession but Hency was able to retrieve the ball. \nOn the first playoff the second quarter Grant Rodatz and Raymond Chumley stopped Davenport for no gain on a third-and-2 at the Bearcat 10 but on fourth down Davenport got 6 and on the first-and-goal he scored to make it 20-0. \nAlthough the point after was missed, it would be the start of a 27-point second quarter for Lamar. \nLamar got the ball back at the Bearcat 41 after Kern returned a Jeff Dobbs punt 11 yards. The Warriors converted two third downs and scored on a third on a 20-yard Davenport to Wilkins pass to make it 26-0 with 6:21 left in the half. A two point try failed. \nThe Bearcats converted a fourth down on the ensuing possession but a fake punt pass by Dobbs would fall incomplete with 2:51 to play in the half. \nFrom its 48, it took the Warriors three plays to score with Wilkins running 48 yards for a touchdown. Davenport ran for a two point conversion to push the lead to 34-0. \nLamar coach Josh Jones used all of his time outs and got the ball back with 1:09 left in the half after a Bearcat punt. \nThat would be enough, but 12 seconds, for Davenport to hit Cody Wyatt for 45 yards and a score to make it 41-0 at the half. Davenport threw for 129 yards. \nOut of the intermission the Bearcat offense, still facing Lamar starters, picked up a couple of first downs before Draper was thrown for a loss on a fourth down at the Lamar 39. \nTwo plays later Brennon Gilbert went 43 yards and it was 47-0. \nBrady Brasher returned the kickoff to the Bearcat 31 and Hayden Fennell hit three straight passes to move the Bearcats to the Lamar 26 at the end of the third quarter. \nFennell hit Mitchell twice more on the drive – Mitchell had six catches for 43 yards and Fennell threw for 74 – before running 7 yards for a touchdown himself with about nine minutes to play. Mitchell added the PAT to make it 47-7. \nAustin Ware rumbled 66 yards one play after the kickoff and Lamar became the first non-Bearcat team to score more than 50 in the stadium. \nThe Bearcats will be looking to bounce back this week when they host Paris for homecoming. The coronation is at 6:30 and kickoff is at 7 p.m.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T22:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T23:17:13.165+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
