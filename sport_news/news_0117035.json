That's when the former Syracuse offensive lineman knew Bills players weren't worried about stepping over the line.\n\"It was a weird drive,\" Pugh said. \"All the penalties, all the fighting, everything that was going on. It was a weird drive. We have to overcome that and score on that last drive.\"\nThe drive ended in an Eli Manning interception, but not before the Bills were flagged for three personal foul penalties, two on Preston Brown and one on Jerry Hughes. Pugh didn't think the Bills cared much with the game out of reach.\n\"They were saying it was over out there,\" Pugh said. \"On that last drive, their defense was kind of like, when they were getting penalties, they were like, Tthis game is over anyway.' That is kind of how it was. It was kind of crazy out there that last drive. Mayhem. Refs yelling at players, players yelling at refs. I was just sitting back and trying not to get fined $15,000 for something.\"\nPugh successfully avoided a fine, and the Giants escaped with a 24-10 win. Meanwhile, Rex Ryan's Bills finished with 17 penalties for 135 yards , but the coach said he was proud of the way his team played .\n\"I'm going to tell you something: I'm proud of the way this team played,\" Ryan said. \"Now, can we play a lot smarter? Absolutely. But I'll take a team that will fight over a team that won't — that will sit back and take it — any day of the week. And bring on the next team. So that's how I look at it. Give me a team that's got some fight and will compete until the very end — right, wrong or indifferent — no matter how good the officiating is or whatever. Makes no difference to me. I'll take the team with some competitive fight and some spirit. Seventeen penalties ridiculous? Absolutely, 100 percent, it's ridiculous. So say what you want, but I'll take a team that will fight. I'm proud of this team and we'll keep fighting and eventually we'll find a way to win, eventually we'll find a way to eliminate penalties.\"\nThere's showing fight, and then there's looking for a fight, which it sounds like Justin Pugh believes the Bills were doing at the end of their Week 4 loss.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T07:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T14:10:40.376+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
