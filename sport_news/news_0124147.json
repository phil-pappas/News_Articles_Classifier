Topics at the meeting — which allowed public attendance, but no public comment — were related to wildfires that burned about 150,000 acres of forest and rangeland in the county this summer. Commission Chairman Bill Harvey and Commissioner Mark Bennett both said the meeting was positive and they look forward to working with the federal agency in the future on topics such as salvage logging and motorized access to the Wallowa-Whitman National Forest. Tom Montoya, Wallowa-Whitman supervisor, said there was productive dialogue Wednesday and he also is optimistic about the forest’s relationship with the county. Harvey said the coordination process is new to all involved and that there will be a learning curve as it moves forward. Bennett said the meeting was a good opportunity for county and Forest Service officials to discuss important issues. Harvey said the Forest Service was very receptive to working with the commissioners. “That’s what the coordination process entails,” Harvey said. “I think and believe they were sincere in wanting to work with us.” He said county leadership is in a position to where they have to look after the rights of Baker County citizens.
