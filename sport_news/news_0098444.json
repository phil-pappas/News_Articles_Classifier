The pitcher said he took a throw from shortstop Troy Tulowitzki, then immediately felt a pop when he took a step toward the runner.\n\"I don't know how I took an extra two steps, but I was able to get there and tag him,\" Cecil said. \"Then just the adrenaline took over for a second, and just the pain set in, and it was tough to get off the field.\"\nCecil said he initially thought he only had a cramp, but then needed help to get off the field and to the clubhouse.\n\"When the MRI came back, they said it was pretty torn up,\" he said.\nWhile doctors have given him no timeline for his return, Cecil said he would not need surgery and would be ready for spring training.\nCecil was 5-5 with five saves and a 2.48 ERA in 63 games during the regular season. He didn't allow an earned run over his last 37 appearances since June 24, with 44 strikeouts in those 31 2-3 innings.\n\"It's definitely a big loss,\" manager John Gibbons said. \"He's been so good for us, arguably the best reliever in baseball the last three months, been up there with the best of them.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T19:20:45.835+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
