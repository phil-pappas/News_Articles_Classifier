The big five are all located in Denver and most of the smaller groups are headquartered in the other six counties that make up the Scientific and Cultural Facilities District.\nThe SCFD board stuck by its earlier plan which gives only modest increases to the smaller groups, proclaiming that the process it used to come up with its proposal — relying on a board-appointed task force — was fair and inclusive.\nThe argument now moves to the state legislature, which must approve the plan, then on to voters who will be asked for their nod in November 2016.\nBoth supporters and opponents of the plan are already working with lobbyists to convince their state representatives to back their positions.\nThere's a lot at stake in terms of tangible support for the arts. The SCFD currently collects $52 million, which it distributes to 278 groups who provide music, theater, and science education. That amount — collected through a 1-cent on $10 sales tax — is expected to grow to $88 million by 2030 when the next reauthorization period would end.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T13:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T06:07:58.270+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
