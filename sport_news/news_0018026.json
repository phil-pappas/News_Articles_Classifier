Idaho kicker Austin Rehkow was four of five on his field goal attempts, including a 19-yarder with 3:01 remaining in the fourth quarter, which proved to be the deciding points. “(I’m) just so proud of our players,” Idaho head coach Paul Petrino said. “I’ve won Sugar Bowls, Cotton Bowls, huge games my whole life. I don’t know if any of them are better than that because everything that our player went through in the last 24 hours.” Idaho had issues traveling and didn’t arrive in Alabama until Saturday morning for the 2:30 p.m. kickoff. “I want to apologize to our fans,” Troy head coach Neal Brown said. “We didn’t show up and play very well for Homecoming. In the first half we were extremely lethargic and we didn’t play very well on either side of the ball.” With reserve quarterback Dallas Tidwell inserted into the game late in the third, Troy overcame a 16-3 deficit to start the fourth quarter. Tidwell, who threw for 168 despite playing only the final 17 minutes of the game, led the Trojans on a pair of field goal drives and a touchdown drive before falling short on the missed field goal at the end. “I thought Dallas gave us a spark,” Brown said. “We just didn’t get it done, and there are a lot of reasons why. I told the team, and I believe this – we didn’t lose the game on that last field goal that went off the (upright).” The Idaho offense was stagnant for much of the second half, but a late field goal drive late in the fourth was the difference. The Vandals marched 73 yards to the Troy 2-yard line in 14 plays eating up 5:06 off the game clock after Troy had rallied to tie the game at 16-16. They had just 124 yards in the second half compared to 273 for the Trojans. Jed Solomon had a stellar game prior to his miss at the end. Despite strong winds, he was three of four on field goals, and he also recovered his own on-sides kick during Troy’s 13-point rally in the fourth. Turnovers were also costly for Troy, committing three in the third quarter alone as Idaho’s 6-0 halftime lead grew to 16-3. The first half was uneventful for both offenses. Idaho was able to capitalize on a pair of field goals to gain a 6-0 halftime lead. The Trojan offense had four punts and an interception in the first half. The second half started promising for the Trojans. After being held to zero yards rushing in the first half, Brandon Burks’ first carry went for 51 yards. Troy got the ball all the way to the Idaho 2-yard line, but Burks had the ball ripped out by Kaylyn Ayers. Troy tacked on a field goal midway through the third, but Ayers stripped starting quarterback Dontreal Pruitt on the Trojans next possession setting up Idaho 21 yards away from the end zone. Four plays later Jake Luton took a quarterback keeper around right end for a touchdown. Luton, playing off the bench, was 5-of-6 passing for 27 yards while starter Matt Linehan went 15-of-31 for 180 yards through the air. Pruitt’s final play before being replaced by Tidwell was an interception, his second of the game, which set up Idaho with solid field position and led to a 40-yard field goal. Idaho led 16-3 at that point with 1:33 left in the third. Tidwell led the Troy offense 53 yards for a field goal early in the fourth to cut the deficit to 16-6. Brown elected to try an on-sides kick, which was Troy’s second successful attempt in as many weeks. Tidwell then found Teddy Ruben on a crossing route, and the senior turned it up field 43 yards for a touchdown. The Trojans’ next possession ended with a 34-yard field goal by Solomon, tying the game at 16-16 before Idaho composed its long scoring drive to take the 19-16 lead. Idaho receiver Dezmon Epps, who had 42 receptions on the year coming into the game, had 10 more for 131 yards. His 41-yard catch down the left sideline was Idaho’s longest play of the game and it set up Idaho’s first points of the day. “We doubled him some,” Brown said of Epps. “He got us early. We had some coverage breakdowns early and we didn’t do a very good job communicating in the secondary.” Troy dropped to 0-2 in conference play, both losses by less than seven points. The Trojans are 1-5 in Brown’s first season and travel to New Mexico State next Saturday for a 7 p.m. (CDT) .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T06:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T12:25:22.257+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
