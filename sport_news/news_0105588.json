This is the kind of offensive style that used to play directly into the hands of the MSU defense, a power approach similar to what it sees in practice every day.\nMSU has been studying film of its 24-20 Rose Bowl victory Jan. 1, 2014, over Stanford — a program that continues to go by the blueprint of its former coach, Harbaugh — to prepare this week. But if the Wolverines watch any film of that game and compare it with footage of this season's MSU defense, they might not detect many similarities.\nDETROIT FREE PRESS\nSharp: MSU parity tough for U-M to accept, great for rivalry\nThis MSU defense is not that MSU defense. And a style matchup that figured to work perfectly for the Spartans as recently as a couple of weeks ago doesn't look so favorable now.\nIf No. 7 MSU is going to stay unbeaten and on course for championship pursuits, it is going to stop No. 12 U-M from running the ball. As Purdue and Rutgers revealed the past two weekends, the Spartans' rush defense can be mistake-prone and cushy at times.\n\"You can't just be 'gap sound,' \" Dantonio said of a long run in each of the past two weeks that was traced to defensive linemen being in the wrong gap. \"You've got to make plays, and you've got to win your battle, your little intensity — your little war in there, battle in there. You've got to win that, and then you've got to make plays, get off blocks, you have to leverage the football, and you have to tackle in space. Because they're going to keep pounding the wall until something breaks. And then you've got to be able to tackle.\"\nIt's not just that in 42 of the past 45 games in this series the winning team had more rushing yards. It's that Michigan's modest passing game relies heavily on balance to make plays. And if it doesn't get that support today, the Spartans' athletic defensive line will have a much better chance of getting after quarterback Jake Rudock.\nDETROIT FREE PRESS\nWindsor: Sizing up U-M, MSU in latest Game of Century\nAnd if that happens, more pressure will shift to a U-M defense that has three straight shutouts but hasn't seen a quarterback of Connor Cook's achievement level. And if that happens, the Spartans are in better shape to make it seven victories in eight tries against Michigan for the first time.\nIt all starts when that reborn Michigan offensive line and collection of fullbacks, tight ends and running backs lines up against a talented-yet-inconsistent front seven.\n\"Believe it or not, they use their fullbacks a lot, they hand the ball off to them, so it's going to be a little bit different for us, but I think the big thing is just controlling the line of scrimmage,\" said junior middle linebacker Riley Bullough, whose presnap reads and play will be key. \"Our D-line is going to play a huge role in this game, like they do every game, but this one more so because (we'll be) getting heavy sets, they try to run the ball at you. So it's going to be important to control the point and just to play fast and play downhill.\"\nIt's the Big Ten's No. 3 rushing offense (201.3 yards per game) against the Big Ten's No. 7 rushing defense (130.2 yards allowed per game). Much of the same Michigan personnel managed a net of 13 rushing yards against MSU the past two seasons, in losses by a total combined score of 64-17.\nBut things have changed significantly for both teams, or so it seems. The Spartans have plenty of appreciation for the throwback football the Wolverines are employing. It's a rare sight. It used to be a welcome sight.\n\"It's good,\" Barnett said. \"It's proof that football is still football and you can still do some things that you did back in the day in today's game. It's fun to watch, and let's see what happens.\"\nContact Joe Rexrode: jrexrode@freepress.com. Follow him on Twitter @joerexrode . Check out his MSU blog at freep.com/heyjoe .
