Three Susquehanna Valley's five games this season have been down to the wire: first an overtime loss in Windsor, then a 1-point win over Norwich -- but Saturday's effort was arguably the best. \nCameron Manchester scored with 3.9 seconds to play and the ensuring extra point lifted Susquehanna Valley over Owego, 13-12. SV's roster may be filled with juniors and seniors, but a lot of those guys sat behind 2015's terrific senior class, so there's not as much experience there. \nWBNG E-News - Sign Up For Our Newsletter! \nThe Sabers' head coach, however, says the Sabers are wise beyond their years when the game is on the line. \n\"I think we have a very young group,\" said Mike Ford. \"They're young, but they don't quit until the end. These close games -- sometimes with a young group, that's where you lose them, but this young group is a little bit more mature than their years maybe let on. \nWith three weeks to play, the playoff race in Class B is wide open. The top four qualify for the sectional playoffs. \nClass B standings (Division Record) 1. Chenango Valley 4-1 (4-0)2. Waverly 4-1 (3-1)4. Susquehanna Valley 2-3 (2-2)5. Owego 3-2 (1-2)6.
