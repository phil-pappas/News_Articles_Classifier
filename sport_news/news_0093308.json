Nick Orr forced a fumble on a blind side blitz to kill an Iowa State drive, and Boykin's touchdown run capped an 85-yard drive that put Iowa State behind by 17. \nFreshman Mike Warren had just 78 yards rushing for Iowa State. Warren had averaged 182 yards over his three previous starts. \n\"It's a huge confidence (boost) for those guys,\" Boykin said of the defense's second-half shutout. \nRhoads had preached to his team all week about the importance of a fast start. \nThe Cyclones got one, with a 74-yard touchdown reception by Allen Lazard — who finished with 147 yards on five catches — bookended by short scoring runs by Thomas and Warren in the first quarter. \n\"We might the worst first quarter defense in college football right now. Holy smokes,\" Patterson said. \nTCU started just as quickly though, scoring on TD throws from Boykin to Doctson (20 yards), Kolby Listenbee (21 yards) and Charlie Reid (14 yards). \nIt wasn't surprising to see the Horned Frogs let the Cyclones hang around after close road wins over Minnesota, Texas Tech and K-State. \nBut after allowing 262 yards in the first quarter, TCU allowed just 199 the rest of the way. \nThe Horned Frogs, who've battled injuries all year, lost wide receiver KaVontae Turpin with an apparent upper-body injury. Patterson didn't elaborate on Turpin's injury other than to say it wasn't season ending. \nThey'll be able to sit Turpin and everyone else for at least a few days before returning to host reeling West Virginia on Oct. 29. \n\"We're beat up pretty good,\" Patterson said. \"We're going to need the 12 days to get ourselves back and ready to go. It's good to go into a break undefeated.\" \n___ \nAP college football website: www.collegefootball.ap.org \n___ \nFollow Luke Meredith on Twitter at www.twitter.com/LukeMeredithAP and on Facebook at www.facebook.com/LukeMeredithAP", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T06:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T10:22:30.345+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
