He performed better in the minors, combining to go 5-7 with a 4.01 ERA in 18 games (17 starts) and one save with Atlanta and Oakland's Triple-A affiliates. The Braves traded him to the A's on July 2. \nHe made two starts for Oakland in September and both went poorly (combined six innings, 11 runs, two losses). \nIn five minor league seasons, Martin, a seventh-round pick by Atlanta in the 2011 MLB draft, is 31-29 with a 3.24 ERA and a 1.26 WHIP in 118 games (84 starts). \nMeanwhile, Kensing was 2-1 with a 5.87 ERA in 19 appearances this season with the Mariners. The 33-year-old was also 2-0 with a 2.23 ERA in 19 appearances with the Rainiers before getting recalled in late August. \nVisit seattlepi.com for more Seattle Mariners news .
