It allowed Chicago, mired in nearly a decade-long slump in the post-Jordan era, to take native son Derrick Rose and make him the face of the franchise.\nNow, seven years later – with Rose still in what should be his prime – that relationship appears to be straining toward its breaking point.\nThat seemed unfathomable in 2011 when Rose was the league’s MVP, Tom Thibodeau looked like a revolutionary hire as head coach and the Bulls had steamrolled their way to the best record in the Eastern Conference – better even than the newly assembled Big Three in Miami.\nBut the Bulls were flattened by LeBron James and the Heat in the Eastern Conference Finals – with James singlehandedly shutting Rose down – and that proved to be the high water mark for the franchise under Thibodeau’s stewardship.\nRose’s body has failed him ever since. He lost one season and two playoff trips to a torn ACL in his left knee, then almost an entire season and another whole playoff run to a torn meniscus in his right. The Bulls fought gamely on without Rose, but simply didn’t have the horses to make a true push for a title without their floor general.\nLast season, when Rose finally was able to have a mostly healthy campaigns – except for the few weeks he missed with yet another meniscus issue – he was a good player, but nowhere near the phenom who tore through the league prior to his injury issues.\nIt would be one thing, though, if Rose simply had begun to break down. But Rose’s comments away from the court, as well as August allegations he was involved in drugging and gang-raping his ex-girlfriend , have led to added scrutiny .\nLast year, after missing virtually the entire previous two seasons with knee injuries, Rose said he was worried about how his body would feel after he had retired from the game.\n“I’m thinking about long term,” Rose said. “I’m thinking about after I’m done with basketball. Having graduations to go to, having meetings to go to, I don’t want to be in my meetings all sore or be at my son’s graduation all sore just because of something I did in the past. [I’m] just learning and being smart.”\nRose followed with this a few weeks ago – in response to a question about the sexual assault allegations ( which he has firmly denied ).\n“This whole summer, I had tunnel vision,” Rose said. “My mindset was just making sure that I was working out every day, and spending as much time as possible with my son and focusing on them two things.\nJimmy Butler received a max contract extension this summer.

It’s not for me, it’s for [son] P.J. and his future. So that’s what I’m thinking about right now.”\nFor many fans in Chicago, who have stuck with Rose through so many low times over the past four years, this was an unconscionable comment. How could Rose, after playing in less than a third of the possible games over the past four years, be talking about free agency?\nThe Bulls clearly are moving into a new era, with Jimmy Butler – who agreed to a max contract extension this summer – as the team’s leading man and Fred Hoiberg installed as coach.\nWith virtually the entire league set to be flush with cap room next summer, there will be opportunities for the Bulls to dump Rose to a team in search of a splashy acquisition (two in New York immediately come to mind), ridding their books of the final year and $21 million-plus of Rose’s contract and fully embracing the new era.\nA vintage season from Rose – who is now dealing with a facial fracture he suffered on an accidental elbow at the start of training camp – could change the narrative around him in his hometown.\nBut the safety net Rose once enjoyed in the Windy City is gone.\n chicago bulls , derrick rose , fred hoiberg , jimmy butler", "external_links": ["http://www.youtube.com/embed/RL28Xb95oMo?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent", "https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/rosebutler.jpg?w=192&#038;h=300", "https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/rosebutler.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-14T20:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T03:21:07.473+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
