The team helped empty each shelf, check expiration dates on food goods, clean and disinfect all the shelving, boxes, and items, and reorganize/stock canned and various donated goods.\n \"It was great to see the team give back to the community today,\" coach Brian Dempsey said in a release. \"I'm not sure that high school students are often in the position to go out of their way to give back like the team did today. I think it is such a great life experience and lesson for all of them. Golf is very much an individual sport, so it was great to see them all come together, truly work as a team, and quite honestly, have fun!\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T19:34:46.266+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
