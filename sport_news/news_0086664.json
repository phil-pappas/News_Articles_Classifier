But it wasn't the home run that had people the most in awe ­— it was his epic bat flip — nay, bat toss.\nOf course, only time will tell if Bautista's bat toss will truly become a celebration to remember in sports history, but so far it seems to be stacking up pretty well against these past memorable moments. Take a look:\n  While it wasn't viewed by as massive an audience as the Blue Jays game, the 2003 Bassmaster Classic on the Delta offered up an ending courtesy of winner Mike Iaconelli that lives on today as one of the most entertaining sports celebrations of all time. It included Iaconelli plopping down on his boat and screaming, \"Never give up!\"\nSerena Williams made the stuffy world of Wimbledon do a double take this summer when she did what no tennis player had dared before at the London tournament — after being handed her trophy, she put it on her head like a hat. Sports are fun, remember?\nCrazy touchdown celebrations in football are easy to find (ever heard of Chad Ochocinco?), but one that caused quite a bit of controversy was Doug Baldwin's infamous \"poopdown\" in this year's Super Bowl. The, um, unique celebration wasn't shown on the national broadcast of the game, but a fan-recorded video caught the whole sordid affair. Baldwin, whose Seattle Seahawks lost the big game to the New England Patriots, ended up apologizing for the action.\nIconic goal celebrations in soccer are nearly as common as touchdown celebrations in football. But one that stands out in history was when Team USA's Brandi Chastain ripped her shirt off in the 1999 Women's World Cup. She had perfectly good reason, too. Chastain sunk the winning penalty kick against China to win the trophy for the States.\nThere wasn't a championship on the line on Jan. 21, 1984, but that didn't stop Syracuse's Dwyane \"The Pearl\" Washington from cementing his place in NCAA history. In a game against Boston College, Washington sank a half-court shot to win the game while running at full speed. To celebrate, Washington just kept on running ... all the way to the locker room. To this day, Washington's shot is considered the greatest ever in the school's history.\nNow-retired NHL star Teemu Selanne carved a permanent place in the hearts of hockey fans when he busted out his famous \"machine gun celebration\" on March 2, 1993, after scoring a hat-trick to set a new rookie goal-scoring record. Playing for the Winnipeg Jets at the time, Selanne raised his total to 54 goals in that game against the Quebec Nordiques and the emotion of the moment clearly made an impact on him. These days, however, he claims his emotion got the best of him — in 2011, Selanne told NHL.com he was \"a little embarrassed\" about the celebration.\nGerman discus thrower Robert Harting won gold at the 2012 Olympics in London, and he had a celebration ready to match. Harting ripped his shirt off, pro-wrestling style, to reveal his bare chest before draping himself in a German flag. It was brilliant — but also illegal, apparently. According to Germany's Bild newspaper (via Yahoo Sports), Harting's uniform destruction violated a law that prohibits German citizens from damaging anything on which the country's flag or eagle emblem are printed. Harting seems to have gotten away with it this time, however.\nGolf pro Miguel Angel Jimenez celebrated in style after carding an incredible eagle during the 2014 Lyoness Open. Jimenez didn't win the European Tour tournament, but he did good enough to tie for fifth. Not bad for the 51-year-old cigar-smoking Spaniard, but certainly not as good as his dance moves.\nRetired NBA player Dikembe Mutombo's famous finger wag is one of the most celebrated sports gestures of all time, but one of the most memorable times that gesture was used was during the 1997 NBA playoffs — by a guy named Michael Jordan. His target? Mutombo, who Jordan had just dunked on.\nFinally, while there are many, many other sports celebrations of note, one that must be included on this list is another Jays home run celebration: Joe Carter's giddy skipping after he won the Jays their last World Series title in Game 7 in 1993.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T11:53:25.653+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
