In one fell swoop on Saturday night, they lost their series lead over the Los Angeles Dodgers and their starting shortstop for the rest of the playoffs.\nMake no mistake: Tejada’s absence will hurt the Mets, especially on defense. Manager Terry Collins called the injury “a big dent.” Nonetheless, the Mets remain in control, sitting two wins away from advancing to the NL Championship Series for the first time since 2006.\nThe Mets host the next two games of the best-of-five NLDS, meaning they could conceivably close out without enduring another cross-country flight to Southern California. Even more encouraging, they will send ace Matt Harvey to the mound for Monday’s pivotal Game 3, a contest bound to elicit intense emotion both from the players and from the sellout crowd expected to pack Citi Field.\nMore on MLB\nIt’s Time to Protect the Infielders Mets Irate After Takeout Slide Breaks Tejada’s Leg Zack Greinke: Baseball’s Most Obsessively Prepared Pitcher Why Comedians Love the Mets Remember ‘Sad Mets Fan’? But first, the Mets needed a little more time to digest the dramatic events of Saturday. Collins on Sunday emphasized that, in his mind, Utley’s slide “was late”—and he didn’t sound quite ready to let it go just yet.\n“I lost a pretty big piece of the puzzle. I’m not very happy about it,” Collins said. “I was pretty shaken up by it, because I thought it was something that didn’t need to happen.”\nThe specter of Utley’s slide will loom large in Game 3 on Monday night, raising questions about whether the Mets will retaliate.\nIn the aftermath of the incident Saturday night, Joe Torre, Major League Baseball’s chief baseball officer, said that the league would consider disciplining Utley, but as of late Sunday, no announcement had come ether way. Collins wouldn’t say whether he wants MLB to suspend Utley, but he said, “Where he hit Ruben on the field certainly was something that needs to be addressed.”\nIn a news conference Sunday, Harvey described the Utley play not as a slide, but “a tackle,” echoing the language used by several of his teammates from the previous night.\nENLARGE Ruben Tejada is carted off the field.

Meanwhile, Harvey drilled Utley with a pitch in April after the Philadelphia Phillies, Utley’s former team, beaned two Mets.\nNeither Collins nor Harvey would discuss how or if the Mets’ plan to respond Monday night, though they didn’t discount the possibility of something happening. Collins noted that historically, “Players always took care of stuff themselves.” Harvey insisted that he wouldn’t hesitate to pitch inside if necessary, even if the umpiring crew issued a warning to the two teams before the start of the game.\n“The most important thing is going out and doing my job and doing what’s best for the team. That’s going out and pitching a long game and being out there as long as I can,” Harvey said. “But as far as sticking up for your teammates, I think being out there and doing what’s right is exactly what I’m going to do.”\nWhatever Harvey ends up doing, it will occur with a different shortstop behind him. With Tejada out, the Mets will now turn to Wilmer Flores, who created headlines in July when he cried on the field, believing the Mets had traded him. The deal fell through, and Flores hit a walk-off home run two days later, cementing his place as a New York cult hero.\nFlores provides more with the bat than Tejada, evidenced by his 16 home runs this year, but he lacks Tejada’s reliability in the field, committing 14 errors at shortstop in 2015. He recently dealt with a sore back and a nasty bout of strep throat, but the Mets say Flores feels better on both fronts.\n“I will certainly spend some time with Wilmer [Monday] and let him know that he’s proved he can play shortstop at this level, to relax and go out, because he’s going to be the guy,” Collins said.\nTo replace Tejada on the roster, the Mets made a surprising choice. Instead of bringing up one of their established major-league backups currently working out at the team’s complex in Port St. Lucie, Fla., they decided to promote minor-league shortstop Matt Reynolds.\nReynolds, 24, appeared in 115 games for Triple-A Las Vegas this season, hitting .267 with six home runs. If he plays at all this month, he would become just the second player in the modern era to make his major-league debut in the postseason, joining Mark Kiger of the 2006 Oakland Athletics.\nUltimately, the Mets went with Reynolds because of his experience at shortstop, playing 350 minor-league games there. Their major-league utility infielder, Kelly Johnson, played shortstop for the first time in his 10-year career last month.\n“No disrespect to Kelly, he’s a tremendous utility player,” Collins said. “We just thought it was going to be important, if Matt’s going to be the guy, we are protected at shortstop with a guy who has played a lot at shortstop.”\nWrite to Jared Diamond at jared.diamond@wsj.com", "external_links": ["http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KS128_NYMETS_M_20151011155217.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KS128_NYMETS_P_20151011155217.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-12T02:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T04:18:21.350+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
