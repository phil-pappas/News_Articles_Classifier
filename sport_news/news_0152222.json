Competitors then faced a variety of challenges during the next two sessions, with both afternoon and night practice run during the rain. The No. 60 car spun and hit the barrier on the front straight during the night practice with John Pew at the wheel, causing damage that may jeopardize its participation in the event. \nEarlier in the day, Negri toured the 12-turn, 2.54-mile road course in a time of 1:15.163 (121.656 mph) to lead Prototype (P) competitors. The Brazilian has led 18 sessions this season – including at least one at all nine permanent circuits on the schedule. \nThursday’s activities gave the TUDOR Championship competitors thorough preparation for the day-to-dark 10-hour endurance classic. While the opening session was held in dry conditions, the one-hour afternoon session was held in steady rain. Teams also were given a 90-minute night practice. \nScott Pruett was second-fastest on the day, running 1:15.627 (120.909 mph) in the No. 01 Ford EcoBoost/Riley that won its first race of the season two weeks ago at Austin’s Circuit of The Americas. Co-driver Joey Hand then led the wet afternoon session with a best lap of 1:16.937 (118.850 mph). IndyCar champion Scott Dixon will co-drive with the team this weekend. \nDefending Petit Le Mans winner Jordan Taylor was fastest at night in the No. 10 Konica Minolta Corvette DP for Wayne Taylor Racing with a lap of 1:29.369 (102.317 mph). Another car to watch is the No. 0 DeltaWing Racing Claro Video/TracFone DeltaWing DWC13, with Katherine Legge third fastest overall at 1:15.757 (120.702 mph). \nAfter winning two weeks ago at Circuit of The Americas, Dirk Werner was fastest in GT Le Mans (GTLM), running 1:19.546 (114.952 mph) in the No. 25 BMW Team RLL BMW Z4 GTLM. The points-leading No. 911 Porsche North America Porsche 911 RSR of Patrick Pilet was second with a lap of 1:19.619 (114.847 mph). Team Falken Tire, seeking its third consecutive class victory in the event, led night practice with Wolf Henzler running 1:31.573 (99.855 mph). \nPrototype Challenge (PC) points leader Colin Braun was fastest in the class at 1:15.976 (120.354 mph) in the No. 54 CORE autosport Flex-Box/Composite Resources ORECA FLM09. In GT Daytona (GTD), Spencer Pumpelly led the session with a lap of 1:22.407 (110.961 mph) in the No. 73 Park Place Motorsports Porsche 911 GT America. \nThe No. 38 Performance Tech Motorsports Ric-Man Construction/GO-PUCK/Braille Batteries ORECA FLM09 was eliminated from Petit Le Mans in an incident early in the session. Conor Daly impacted a barrier in Turn 2. While he was not hurt, the tub of the car was damaged and according to the team will not be repaired in time for the event. \nQualifying Rained Out, Point Leaders Out Front For Finale \nHeavy rain led to the cancellation of Continental Tire SportsCar Challenge qualifying, with teams lining up according to the point standings for Friday’s finale. \nAndrew Davis will lead the Grand Sport (GS) field in the No. 6 Stevenson Motorsport Chevrolet Camaro Z/28.R. He and co-driver Robin Liddell enter the finale with a 28-point lead, and will secure the title by satisfying drive-time requirements in the race. \nMatt Plumb was fastest in both practice sessions in the No. 13 Billfish Foundation/Rum Bum Studios Porsche 911 co-driven by his brother, Hugh Plumb. They enter the finale second in the points, with a mathematical shot at the GS crown. \n“Starting on the front row is about the best we can hope for,” Matt Plumb said. “Our car is good, and this track suits us well. Our team has a great baseline setup here that we keep going back to. Rain or shine, we should be good on Friday.” \nChad McCumbee and Stevan McAleer earned the Street Tuner (ST) pole in the No. 5 CJ Wilson Racing Mazda MX-5 by virtue of holding a one-point lead over Andrew Carbonell in the No. 26 Freedom Autosport Mazda MX-5. \n“We’re on the pole, and I think we’re in a good spot,” McAleer said. “But so many things can go wrong in the rain. It would have been treacherous qualifying today. We have a slim lead, but we probably are the favorites. We just need to execute. We’ll have a fight on our hands, and I’m eager to get going. It’s been a long wait leading up to this weekend.” \nFriday’s schedule includes the Continental Tire Challenge race at 12:15 p.m. and TUDOR Championship qualifying at 3:20 p.m. Associated Categories : Sports , NASCAR News, Other Motorsports Associated Tags : motorsports, Auto Racing, Asphalt, road course, road atlanta, IMSA © Copyright 2015 AccessWDUN.com All rights reserved.
