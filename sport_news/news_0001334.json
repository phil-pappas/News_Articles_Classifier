Sophomore swingman Daniel Hamilton was the first member of the team to complete the annual 3.1-mile race. He jogged the last few yards backward, and finished in 20 minutes, 21 seconds â€” 10 seconds ahead of junior forward Kentan Facey. Junior center Amida Brimah, who ran 20:22 a year ago, didn't participate this year because of a sore ankle. Hamilton says he's in the best shape of his life, and believes his team has what it takes to be among the best in the nation. The Huskies finished 20-15 and lost in the first round of the NIT last season, a year after winning the program's fourth NCAA championship.
