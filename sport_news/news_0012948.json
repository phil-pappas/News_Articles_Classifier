Colorado is the only one with legal recreational marijuana, so a new report from the agencies focus on its impact on the state.\nIn Denver, impaired driving tickets involving marijuana doubled from 33 to 66 in one year. The Colorado State Patrol reported that 77 percent of its cases involved marijuana.\nHowever, only 41 percent -- 354 out of 874 of all impaired drivers tested positive for marijuana alone.\nThe Oregonian/OregonLive reported in August that the trouble with determining marijuan's impact on road safety is the difficulty in determining how much effect pot has on drivers.\nThe psychoactive substance in cannabis, THC, can stay in a marijuana user's system for days, or weeks. But, that doesn't mean the user is impaired by it, necessarily.\nWhile companies races to figure out a roadside test, like the alcohol breathalyzer, that can measure THC, researchers are starting to study in more depth how much pot is too much if you want to get on the road.\nMeanwhile, states are tracking statistics on how much marijuana plays into driving infractions and deaths.\nColorado's latest set of data shows that there has been a significant jump in nearly all categories tracked since legalization.\nHere are some takeaways:\nMost people pulled over with marijuana in their system also had alcohol or other drugs mixed in, too. Thirty-seven percent tested positive for marijuana and alcohol, 15 percent for booze, pot and other drugs and 15 percent for just pot and other drugs. Only 33 percent had cannabis alone in their body.\nIn 2009, medical marijuana was allowed in Colorado. In 2013, recreational marijuana was allowed. In that time, drivers who tested positive for THC rose from a little more than 13 percent to a little more than 18 percent -- about the 5-percent-point increase. Between 2013 and 2014, the same increase happened, bringing drivers with THC in their systems to slightly more than 24 percent.\nThe total number of traffic deaths in the state have fallen since medical marijuana was legalized. The past few years, the number has been creeping back up, though, hitting 488 in 2014 -- the highest since 2008.\nIn 2008, almost 8 percent of the 548 drivers involved in traffic deaths tested positive for marijuana. In 2014, 19 percent tested positive for marijuana.\nYou can read more in the report .\nTo learn more about how Oregon and other states with recreational marijuana are dealing with impaired driving:\nCompanies race to create marijuana breathalyzer; Oregon differs from neighbors in THC limit\nMarijuana and driving: What you need to know (FAQs)\nDriving with marijuana in Oregon: Reader questions\n-- Molly Harbarger\nmharbarger@oregonian.com\n503-294-5923\n@MollyHarbarger", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/MollyHarbarger"], "published": "2015-10-15T21:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T00:21:38.344+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
