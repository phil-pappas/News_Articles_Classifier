(AP Photo/Mel Evans) \nPISCATAWAY, N.J. (AP) — When it comes to No.1 Ohio State, Rutgers isn’t competitive. \nThe Buckeyes beat the Scarlet Knights by 39 points a year ago and the margin was even worse Saturday night when J.T. Barrett threw three touchdown passes and ran for two scores in his first start of the season in 49-7 victory. \nRutgers avoided the shutout on a touchdown pass by Heyden Rettig to Andre Patton with 13 seconds left. \n“We didn’t perform very well as a program tonight, and that begins with me,” Rutgers coach Kyle Flood said. “And really, filters through the entire program. We’ll get back to work tomorrow.” \nRutgers (3-4, 1-3 Big Ten) missed a short field goal on its first possession and didn’t get past the Ohio State 40 again until late. \nThings aren’t going to get much easier with games at Wisconsin (6-2, 3-1) and Michigan (5-2, 2-1) the next two weekends. \n“We definitely have a chance,” senior running back Paul James said of the team’s bowl chances. “It’s just how we play and how we execute, and tonight we did not do a good job of that.” \nOhio State (8-0, 4-0 Big Ten) extended its winning streak to 21 games, best in the nation, and heads into its off week with no doubt who the starting quarterback will be when Minnesota comes to Columbus on Nov. 7. \nIt will be a nice change for coach Urban Meyer, who started Cardale Jones in the first seven games of the season before making the switch to Barrett this week. Facing one of the worst defenses in the Big Ten, Barrett was near flawless. He was 14 for 18 for 223 yards and ran for 101 yards on 13 carries. Jones entered in the fourth quarter when the score was 49-0. \n“That’s a very talented team,” said Rutgers linebacker Quentin Gause, who had 15 tackles “You can’t say much about it now. It was a learning experience.” \nThe next phase of Ohio State’s long-running quarterback soap opera had Barrett as the leading man for the Buckeyes. Meyer made the expected switch this week after the Big Ten player of the year had lost a preseason competition to Jones, who led the Buckeyes to the national championship after Barrett broke his ankle against Michigan last year. \nJones was inconsistent as a starter, but not until the last two games when Barrett accounted for seven touchdowns in relief did he really make a case to reclaim the job. \nBarrett gives the Buckeyes more of a running threat and a better ball-handler on their zone-read plays. He scooted 39 yards with a keeper on his first carry of the game and several times had Rutgers defenders grabbing at Buckeyes who did not have the ball. \nOhio State was run-heavy much of the first half, keeping it on the ground on 16 of its first 20 plays. \nBarrett doesn’t have the powerful arm that Jones brings to the offense, but he is no liability in the passing game. When the Buckeyes did open it up, they found some big plays against Rutgers’ injury depleted secondary. Barrett hooked up with Michael Thomas on short throw that turned into a 50-yard touchdown play that made it 14-0 in the second quarter. \nBarrett was a little short on a deep sideline throw to Braxton Miller, but the quarterback-turned receiver made a juggling 45-yard grab. A couple plays later, Barrett scooted in from a yard and it was 21-0. \nThe deep ball looked better from Barrett next time. He found Curtis Samuel, who grew up in nearby Brooklyn, in the end zone for a 30-yard TD to make it 28-0 less than two minutes into the second half. \nThe Buckeyes first trip ever to Rutgers drew a sellout crowd of 53,111 at High Point Solutions Stadium and their scarlet-clad fans blended in nicely with the Rutgers fans — until a corner of the stadium broke into an “O-H! I-O!” chant. By the end, they were pretty much the only ones left. \nBarrett made it 35-0 with his second touchdown run and a 1-yard touch-pass to Jalin Marshall made it 42-0 with 4:34 left in the third quarter. \n“It’s kind of weird,” said Ohio State running back Ezekiel Elliott, who rushed for 142 yards and two touchdowns. “It didn’t feel like we scored too many points out there because we had great field position all game, but you look at the scoreboard and it kind of reminds you of old times — high-powered Ohio State offense.” \nIt was the first time since 2002 the Scarlet Knights hosted the No. 1 team in the country and the first time as a member of the Big Ten. \n___ \nAP college football website: www.collegefootball.ap.org Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T07:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T07:29:43.756+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
