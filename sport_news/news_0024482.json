It’s like a game. The first quarter doesn’t mean you lost the game. The first quarter of the [season] doesn’t mean we got to the playoffs. We’ve got a long way to go. The season’s young. You can go from the penthouse to the outhouse real quick.”\nWait, no playoff proclamations? No planning the parade route?\nIf you needed further evidence that Ryan is long gone, packed up and in Western New York, Bowles gave it to you Thursday. Bowles’ approach to the Jets’ early success is the anti-Rex. He is trying to temper expectations and make sure his players don’t allow some early success to inflate their egos. \n“We’ve got to make sure although short, minimal, brief success for four weeks, if you want to call it that, we still have a long way to go to get better and do things we need to do,” Bowles said. “We have no reason to be patting ourselves on the back.”\nThe Jets have gotten off to a start that has surprised many, and now they are beginning to hear how good they are. Power rankings have them in the top 10 in the league and they have become a trendy pick to claim an AFC wild-card berth. The defense is ranked second in the league overall and first in scoring defense. \nRyan Fitzpatrick Photo: AP The offense is not all-world, but much improved from recent versions. Running back Chris Ivory and wide receiver Brandon Marshall are having big seasons. Quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick has had a calming effect on the team.\nAll is good in Jets’ world right now. But they are trying to ignore the good vibes and just prepare for the 2-3 Redskins.\n“I think it’s key for any team not to ride that emotional roller coaster,” guard Willie Colon said. “The good teams stay right here [holding his arm out in a straight line]. If you look at the Patriots and Seattle, teams that no matter who they go up against they stay at a certain level. They don’t go down to other guys’ level. I think that’s what this team is trying to figure out. No matter who we go against, we’ve just got to stay at a high level, we have to play at a high level and everything will work itself out.”\nBowles said it is not just the players who have to guard against getting blinded by success.\n“Even as a coach, you can get too smart,” Bowles said. “You always have to stick with your base fundamentals and your core fundamentals. You don’t try to design and out-scheme because you can get a little exotic that way. You have to make sure you keep yourself under wraps and make sure that it’s all about the players out there and not coach too far.”\nAs Bowles see it, the Jets have a choice on how to handle the praise they are getting.\n“You have to deal with success one way or the other,” he said. “You have to deal with the accolades that come with it and continue to do what you’ve got to do or you deal with it by hanging out too much and not doing the things you have to do.”\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google Whatsapp Email Filed under new york jets ,  ryan fitzpatrick ,  todd bowles ,  willie colon", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T23:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T03:55:34.148+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
