He started jumping around.\" \nMcCoy made her commitment to Louisiana Tech public on her Twitter account late Sunday, hours after returning from her official visit. She chose the Lady Techsters over scholarship offers from Middle Tennessee State, Virginia Tech and San Diego State. \nThe move didn't come as a surprise. She told the News Sentinel on Sept. 24 she was leaning \"heavily\" toward playing for Summitt, the son of legendary Tennessee women's basketball coach Pat Summitt. \n\"We knew about two weeks (ago) we were going to commit this weekend. We planned on it,\" McCoy said. \"It was a big decision, and Tyler's the best, honestly. Making the decision to go there and play for him was easy. And the campus is beautiful.\" \nTyler Summitt played high school basketball at Webb before walking on at Tennessee in 2010. He was hired in 2014 at Louisiana Tech, which has won three national championships and reached 13 Final Fours. He coached McCoy in a fall league during her sixth grade year in 2009. \nMcCoy, known for her prowess as a shot blocker, earned second-team All-PrepXtra honors as a junior, averaging 12.1 points, 8.2 rebounds and 3.4 blocks to help Farragut reach a Class AAA state sectional. \n\"Louisiana Tech is a great fit for her,\" Farragut girls basketball coach Jason Mayfield said. \"\"Her size and athleticism combined will translate great to the college level. To be 6-3 and move like she does, that's a big asset and one that's hard to find at the high school level.\" \nChris Thomas covers high school sports. Follow him at twitter.com/prepxtra.
