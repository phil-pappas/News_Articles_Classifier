We only scored three runs in the two games. That's hard to win. But we have so much offensive talent and I believe in our guys.\"\nThe last time the Cubs lost the first two games of a postseason series and came back to win it was, uh, never.\nThey lost the first two games in the 1910 and 1929 World Series against the Philadelphia A's, the 1932 and 1938 Series against the Yankees and the 1998, 2007 and 2008 division series against the Braves, Diamondbacks and Dodgers, respectively. They went on to get swept in the latter five series and won one game in each of the former two.\nBut the theme song from \"Rocky\" blasted in the visitors clubhouse after the game, a reminder not to count the Cubs out.\n\"Exactly,\" Kyle Schwarber said. \"We're not going to give up. We haven't given up the last two games. It's been a hard-fought battle these last two. It's just baseball. It's how it goes. Those guys are on. You tip your cap and move on.\"\nCubs ace Jake Arrieta proved to be human for the second straight game, putting his team in a 3-0 hole only three batters in and lasting only five innings. The Cubs' two horses, Jon Lester and Arrieta, now must sit and hope they can get another chance, with Kyle Hendricks and probably Jason Hammel going in Games 3 and 4 at Wrigley Field.\nArrieta said there was \"some disconnect timing-wise,\" but he felt like he pitched well after the shaky start, despite a slight drop in velocity.\n\"You're not guaranteed to pitch 97 (mph) every night,\" he said. \"It would be nice. But I still have four other pitches I can use to get guys out any night.\"\nArrieta has carried the load much of the season, but now it's up to Hendricks, who matches up against Jacob deGrom in a must-win Game 3 on Tuesday.\nAt least the Cubs can take comfort knowing they won't have to deal with a mini polar vortex when they return to Chicago, and they'll have the Wrigley aura to fall back on if things get tough.\nOctober just can't be scripted, as we've learned once again.\n\"Any given night a good pitcher can get beat,\" David Ross said. \"Look at tonight. We're not expecting Jake to give up three in the first, you know? This happens. This is baseball. Everybody has an off night.\"\nDid anyone expect Arrieta to be hit as hard as he was in the first after turning in the best second-half performance in major-league history? Could anyone have foreseen Daniel Murphy, the Mets' 30-year-old second baseman, turning into Reggie Jackson?\nAfter hitting 14 home runs in the regular season, Murphy has five in seven postseason games. Murphy may not own the bleachers, but so far he owns the Cubs. He poked a first-inning home run for the second straight game, a two-run blast off Arrieta that gave the Mets a quick 3-0 lead and sent the freeze-dried fans into a frenzy.\nIf the Cubs' season ends in the NLCS, they can look back this winter with a warm, fuzzy feeling, knowing they went further than anyone imagined.\nBut these Cubs aren't the kind of team that tends to walk away from a fight.\n\"This isn't the way it's scripted,\" Anthony Rizzo said. \"It's not like we're dogging it or anything. If we come up short, we do, but we don't plan on (losing).\"\nThe Mets slugged the Cubs in the mouth in these two games in New York.\nNow we'll find out if they can punch their way out of this.\npsullivan@tribpub.com\nTwitter @PWSullivan\nPrivacy Policy Major League Baseball Baseball Chicago Cubs New York Mets Jake Arrieta Daniel Murphy National League Championship Series", "external_links": ["http://www.tribpub.com/privacy-policy-and-your-privacy-rights/", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-5624e6d1/turbine/ct-sullivan-cubs-mets-nlcs-spt-1019-20151015"], "published": "2015-10-19T07:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T19:13:58.727+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
