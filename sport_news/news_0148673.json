According to Bergen County prosecutor John Molinelli, Carter pointed an antiquated Civil War-era musket, which apparently was still functioning, at the boy and said, Im going to shoot you. The reason, according to Molinelli, was: The young boy was apparently a fan of a particular football team, the priest was not. So perhaps we have indication it started out as that. Carter is a Giants fan and that other football team is apparently the Dallas Cowboys, according to persecutors [sic]. You may recall that September 13 was the day that the Giants and Cowboys faced off and the Giants laid down a truly impressive collapse.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T05:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T17:30:07.604+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
