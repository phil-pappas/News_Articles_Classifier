They came to play.\" \nDown the stretch, however, it was the top-ranked Cavaliers who left nothing to chance. ... ... (Rich Scherr) \nThe win allowed Garrison Forest (10-1-1 overall, 3-1 conference) to remain within a game of A Conference-leader Spalding with two weeks left in the regular season. Both the Grizzlies and Eagles (9-2, 4-2) have lost to the Cavaliers by identical 3-2 scores. \nIn this one, Garrison Forest seemed intent to put away McDonogh early. \nThe Grizzlies took the lead on a goal by junior Ali Baratta just 2:13 into the game and made it 2-0 two minutes later when senior Hailey Mules took a pass near midfield, sped past her defender and scored on a one-on-one in front of the goal. \nWhen junior Natalie Adamez then scored off a corner from Mules with 19:22 left in the half, the lead had ballooned to 3-0, and could've been more if not for a missed penalty stroke. \nIn Wednesday's season opener against top-ranked Severna Park, however, the host Eagles may have exceeded even the loftiest of expectations. ... ... (Rich Scherr) \nBut this game was far from over. \nAfter coming close several times, the Eagles finally got on the scoreboard midway through the second half on a goal from junior D'Arcy Carlson, then cut the lead to one when senior Brindi Griffin scored off a feed from Allie Weiner with 11:10 to play. \nQuickly, the similarities to last week's blown lead became apparent to players. \n\"That was definitely going through my head a little bit,\" Mules said. \"All I could think was, 'They're coming back,' and we were doing the same thing as last time. I think we just had to punch through and try really hard to bring out all the things we practiced. We were really pumped to win.\" \nStill, McDonogh controlled the ball for much of the second half, missing out on several chances to tie, including six penalty corners. \n\"It was just a slow start. After that … I honestly feel that we, skill-wise, dominated the rest of the game,\" McDonogh coach Jonna Wahle said. \"We just couldn't finish enough.\" \nOn this day, Garrison Forest managed to avert disaster, but Davis said her team will have to learn how to play a 60-minute game if it expects to compete for a title. \n\"We have to play two complete halves,\" Davis said. \"All of these A Conference teams … nobody's going to give up. It doesn't matter if you're 5-0. Teams in this conference are so darn good … that a three-goal lead, a two-goal lead, it's not enough.\" \nFor McDonogh, thoughts of a possible postseason rematch already are front and center. \n\"I know we'll see them again [in the playoffs],\" Wahle said. \"I'm planning on it.\" \nField Hockey \nGarrison Forest 3, McDonogh 2 \nGoals: GF-Baratta, Mules, Adamez; M-Carlson, Griffin.
