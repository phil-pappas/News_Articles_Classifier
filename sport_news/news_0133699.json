Now comes the hard part. To truly validate and justify how FCD goes about its business, both in the eyes of history and its fanbase, they now must win MLS Cup.\nNo, it is not fair. Not even by a smidgen, but it is the harsh reality of sport in America. You gotta win the big one to be counted. While it would be have a nice (but flawed) acknowledgment to have won the Support's Shield - for Oscar Parjea and FC Dallas to properly prove its place in MLS history, it is all about winning The Cup. Period.\nRemember, just two seasons ago NY RedBull also won the Supporter's Shield and were promptly bounced in the first round against Houston. Who other than hard core NYRB fans really remember or care about the 2013 Shield? Quick, who won it last year? Its ok if you can't immediately recall.\nThe Huntsmen's achievement of winning the West, on the league's smallest payroll, is a fantastic story. It's also probably one MLS as a league isn't all that excited to talk about. Especially when the other conference's leader, NYRB, is the second smallest. The harsh reality for both FCD and NYRB is once the calendar flips to 2016 unless one wins MLS Cup, few will recognize how much success was gained with so little. That is just how sport go in America . Run a season? Get a top playoff seed? Win a conference/division title? Nice stuff Bro - did you win the Super Bowl, World Series, Stanley Cup or NBA Title?\nDallas will face either Sporting KC, the LA Galaxy, or the Seattle Sounders on November 1st in the first half of a away/home match up. If the math is correct, FCD is 2-5-1 against that trio. The two wins came way back in the Spring.\nDallas bests all three on recent form. Since the end of August Seattle has been on a low boil (4-0-4), KC has sputtered (3-2-5) and LA (1-4-2) has disappointed despite its deep roster of giant talent. In comparison Dallas has run off a 7-2-1 record in that same time frame. Despite that significant difference in form, can anyone honestly consider Dallas a clear favorite against any of the three? Those two losses? Against KC and LA.\nMake no mistake, if Dallas' season ends at the hands of one of these big salaried teams on November 8th in Frisco, all of what was achieved will largely go forgotten. Naysayers will, and for good reason, point out winning MLS Cup is the goal. Losing to a team with well-known superstars, while Dallas has none, will absolutely re-ignite the passionate debate of how the Hunt Sports Group has decided to construct its roster.\nOnce you dig past the big names and money, Dallas has assembled a team capable of beating any other in MLS . Killer team speed, just enough organization and Mauro Diaz's creative influence make them justifiably a serious contender. Additionally, it's a side that can be wickedly fun to watch play soccer.\nThere is absolutely a fun and fascinating story about The Huntsmen 2015 season. Fair or not, how it is remembered will come down to how the 'Little Payroll from Frisco' makes its run through the MLS Playoffs.\nOn Twitter:\n @peet2", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/peet2"], "published": "2015-10-26T18:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T18:27:50.730+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
