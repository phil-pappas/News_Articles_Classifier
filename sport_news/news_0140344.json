He brings a track record of success from Boston, where he orchestrated multiple championships in a city equally starved for victory before he turned Cub history on its head.\nThe brainy impresario recruits dozens of untested prospects. They find their footing sooner than expected and compete with powerhouse teams like the Pirates and Giants. The entire Chicago fan base soon realizes that a new era of hope and expectation has finally arrived.\nIt sounds like deja vu all over again, but even Yogi Berra couldn't tell us much about this parallel baseball saga — it took place a quarter century before he was born.\nWhat team President Theo Epstein has wrought this year with the perennial losers known as the Chicago Cubs — who won a wild-card playoff game Wednesday night for the right to compete against the Cardinals, Dodgers and Mets for the National League pennant — echoes a feat that another New England transplant to the Windy City performed more than a hundred years ago.\nIt also offers a hopeful, if cautionary, tale to long-suffering Cub fans (like me) who have never experienced the ultimate thrill of a World Series championship. We can now dream of one this year and several years to come.\nChicago's first white knight was Frank Selee. Though belatedly voted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1999 for his many accomplishments in the 19th century, he remains little known to baseball fans in Chicago or Boston. After winning five National League pennants in the 1890s as Boston's manager, Selee came to Chicago in 1902 with a mandate to rebuild this once-storied franchise from the bottom up.\nFrank Selee Chicago Tribune historical photo Frank Selee, back row second from left, manager of the Chicago Cubs, stands with his 1906 team. Frank Selee, back row second from left, manager of the Chicago Cubs, stands with his 1906 team. (Chicago Tribune historical photo) Like Epstein, Selee had no real experience playing baseball. And, like Epstein, he had a long-view vision for how to put a winning team together in Chicago, insisting on patience and the ability to see the on-field potential of the young ballplayers he collected like marbles.\nSelee was the one who moved itinerant third baseman Joe Tinker to shortstop, judging his range and quick hands as assets better applied in the keyhole position. He found a hotheaded Irish kid called Little Johnny Evers and installed him at second base. And he persuaded big, injury-prone Frank Chance to move from backup catcher to first base, getting his long reach and his leadership skills into the game on an everyday basis.\nOf course, this slick double-play combo of \"Tinker to Evers to Chance\" would find baseball immortality in a bit of light verse penned in 1910 by New York columnist (and lifelong Chicago fan) F.P. Adams. His \"trio of bear cubs\" manned the Cubs infield for a remarkable 12 straight seasons, the linchpins of a historic dynasty that won four pennants from 1906 to 1910 and two world championships. The tragic fact is, the Cubs' 1908 World Series victory (over Ty Cobb's Detroit Tigers) was their last to date.\nBut in 1903, when Tinker, Evers and Chance came together under Selee, no one knew what to expect of his young team. No one could even agree on what to call them. The Chicago franchise had abandoned its old nickname, \"White Stockings,\" after sportswriters started calling manager Cap Anson's team the \"Colts\" for their youthful inexperience (and inability to win, place or show).\nWhen Anson retired, sarcastic writers referred to the team he left behind as \"Orphans.\" Others tried \"Remnants.\" The Chicago Daily News, seeing young faces once again up and down the roster, was the first, but at the time only, local paper to call them \"Cubs.\"\nSelee's boys surprised everyone in 1903 by finishing third behind the Pittsburgh Pirates and the New York Giants. They placed second the following year with 93 wins.\nThe Selee touch had clearly turned the team's fortunes around. But his future with the club was tenuous. In poor health for much of his life, Selee resigned mid-1905 with tuberculosis and moved to the high-mountain air of Colorado. He died there in 1909, only 49 years old.\nUnder Selee's successor, player-manager Frank Chance, the Cubs went on to win 116 games in 1906, a record tied only once in the past 109 years. The Cubs Dynasty (!?!) lasted four more years before injuries and management quarrels broke up the Tinker-Evers-Chance combine.\nIt may have taken more than a century for what goes around to finally come back around to the Chicago Cubs and their ever-constant fans. We won't know for sure until modern-day baseball's mazelike \"Post Season\" plays out. But when you measure success in 100-year time spans, you know it can disappear in the relative blink of an eyelash. Enjoy this new feeling, Cubs fans, with eyes wide open.\nDavid Rapp is the former editor and chief content officer of CQ Roll Call in Washington.
