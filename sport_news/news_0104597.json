(Photo: George Walker IV / The Tennessean) Buy Photo \nMarcus Mariota’s most pressing concern is his knee, the sprained MCL that may well cause him to miss time. \nWhenever he next takes the field, however, the Titans’ rookie quarterback will have to address a turnover issue that proved costly in his team’s one-sided loss to Miami on Sunday. \nMariota’s five fumbles this season are tied with San Francisco’s Colin Kaepernick for the league lead, and his four lost fumbles are the most in the league — one ahead of Cleveland’s Josh McCown and San Diego’s Melvin Gordon. How do NFL players like Mariota deal with injuries? \nIt should be noted, of course, that Mariota hardly bears all the blame for his fumbles, as a shaky offensive line has allowed him to be sacked 19 times, tied for third-most in the league. Pressure played a direct role in Mariota’s two lost fumbles against the Dolphins. \n“That’s on our group, our team,” Titans coach Ken Whisenhunt said. “We have to do a better job of protecting him.” \nIt’s hard to overestimate just how important the turnover differential is to the success of teams. \nIn the six seasons the Titans have posted a positive turnover differential, for instance, their record is a combined 66-30. \nThe NFL this season is pretty cut and dried in terms of turnover differential as well: Ten of the 15 teams with positive turnover differential have winning records, while none of the 17 teams with even or negative turnover differential have winning records. Ken Whisenhunt insists Titans are better than last year \nThe Titans have a minus-four turnover differential, seventh-worst in the league. \n“It seems like a turnover always turns out to be an important play in the game,” Titans quarterback Charlie Whitehurst said. “It usually helps take points off the board or swings field position. Anyone can look at (turnovers) and say you have to try to limit them offensively and try to get as many as you can defensively for the same reasons.” \nMariota had some fumbling issues at Oregon, where he fumbled 27 times in 41 games. \nIn his first NFL season, all five of Mariota’s fumbles came against Cleveland and Miami — the two games in which he faced the most pressure and was sacked a combined 12 times. \nMariota’s two fumbles against the Dolphins were similar. Ep. 5: Titans' Jason McCourty and Coty Sensabaugh talk about whether or not the team is adapting to Marcus Mariota and offer their opinions on the rookie QB. (10/19/15) Karen Kraft / The Tennessean \nIn neither instance was he holding the ball with one hand in the pocket, something that often gets quarterbacks in trouble. Both times, however, pressure from Miami defensive end Cameron Wake caused Mariota to pump slightly before throwing, allowing Wake the opportunity to knock the football from his grasp. \n“I could definitely do a better job of just swinging the ball around and not allowing the defenders to swipe at it,” Mariota said. “I have to improve in that area.” Next for Titans: One-loss Falcons \nWhisenhunt wasn’t sure Mariota could have done much differently on either occasion to prevent the fumble. \n“If you look at the two fumbles he had, he actually had two hands on the ball,” Whisenhunt said. “When he was going to throw is when they hit the ball and knocked it loose. It’s kind of hard to throw the ball with two hands. At some point you have to let it go. That’s when the timing of it worked out that the ball got hit.” \nAdded Whitehurst: “You can spend all your time looking at the defensive end and making sure he doesn’t swat it out of your hands, but you’re not going to complete many passes that way. You have to look downfield.” \nOn the interception front, Mariota’s two picks Sunday give him five for the season in 161 attempts. But he’s also thrown nine touchdown passes, giving him a respectable 1.8 touchdown-to-interception ratio that ranks ahead of plenty of notable NFL names, including Andrew Luck, Joe Flacco, Matthew Stafford, Jameis Winston and Peyton Manning. \n“There’s plenty of Pro Bowl quarterbacks that don’t always have the greatest days every Sunday,” Whisenhunt said. “They have some days where they throw some interceptions or they don’t have their best day. \n“But he’s a very diligent student of the game, and he’s working very hard at it. … He’s certainly getting more comfortable with his part of it as far as the terminology and understanding everything that goes into it. He’ll get better as the season progresses.” \nLooney signed: The Titans added depth at the center position on Tuesday, signing center/guard Joe Looney and placing starting center Brian Schwenke (dislocated ankle) on injured reserve. \nThe 6-3, 315-pound Looney was a fourth-round pick of the 49ers in 2012. He has 19 games of NFL experience with San Francisco, including 15 last year. Looney started four games for the 49ers last season — two at right guard, one at left guard and one at center. \nReach John Glennon at 615-259-8262 and on Twitter @glennonsports. \nNFL FUMBLES LEADERS \nColin Kaepernick QB 49ers 5 \nMarcus Mariota QB Titans 5 \n(Nine tied with 4) \nName Position Team Fumbles Lost \nMarcus Mariota QB Titans 4 \nMelvin Gordon RB Chargers 3 \nJosh McCown QB Browns 3 \n(14 tied with 2) Titans quarterback Marcus Mariota (8) bobbles the ball before fumbling in the second quarter.
