It took until the 2013 playoffs for him to get comfortable. While the Maple Leafs should not be as great a psychological barrier to the 500-point winger — and there’s no Zdeno Chara blanketing him here — Saturday’s first post-trade encounter didn’t go too well either. \nKessel, and his star centre Sidney Crosby, came away empty-handed, with No. 81 misfiring on a third-period breakaway. The Penguins did hang on 2-1 over a stubborn Toronto squad that played the night before. Kessel is stuck on a goal and assist overall, while Crosby saw his pointless streak run to a career-worst five games. Here is Saturday's @ScotiaHockey Game in Six Minutes. #TMLtalk WATCH: http://t.co/UNQt1MP33c — Toronto Maple Leafs (@MapleLeafs) October 18, 2015 \n“We won, right? I’m happy whenever we win,” Kessel said. “This one is extra special. \n“Obviously, I played with those guys a long time. They’re good friends and it’s weird the first time to play against them. But they’ll always be my buddies.” The #Pens defeat the Leafs and start their first winning streak of the season.

Coach Mike Babcock has seen his team get the hang of a sometimes complicated structure of breakouts and puck retrieval that at one stage Saturday saw three lines pound the home team hard in its end with some juicy turnovers resulting. \n“We did a lot of good things, but we ran out of energy in the third,” Babcock said. “We weren’t giving up much, but our defence ran out of gas.” \nToronto, which didn’t give up a goal after two on Jonathan Bernier in 39 seconds early in the first, threatened right to the final minute with a 6-on-4 that was disrupted by a too-many-men call. \n“Bernier had a real strong game after the first two,” Babcock said. “Hopefully this gets him over the hump and gets him going.” Here's what Mike Babcock had to say after Saturday's game. #TMLtalk WATCH: http://t.co/PHB7AkB05M — Toronto Maple Leafs (@MapleLeafs) October 18, 2015 \nJames Reimer had mostly out-played him, so Wednesday’s starter in Buffalo could be an interesting choice. \nKessel was amped up during pre-game stretches, looking right across the centre line at Bernier. The subject of a Consol Energy Center mini-stick giveaway, Kessel was anxious to get started on the opening shift. He and Crosby had four shot attempts that period. \n“That was definitely weird, seeing him on the other side,” said Leaf defenceman Jake Gardiner. “I don’t know how well you guys know him, but he’s a funny guy and has a lot of funny facial expressions.” \nThe Kessel-Crosby scoring mission remain unfullfilled in the second, which began when Crosby took Gardiner wide on his first shift and found Kessel alone in front. But the latter wasn’t position to let go his snap shot, missing with a backhand. Kessel, who on Halloween night will make his first Air Canada Centre appearance since the trade, didn’t get a decent shot off on his good third-period chance. \nDaniel Winnik drew most of the Kessel coverage assignment, backed by defenceman Matt Hunwick. \nPittsburgh had a brief power play to start the game, but a Bernier pad save came all the way out to a breaking Mark Arcobello. Replacing the injured Tyler Bozak, Arcobello was given nothing to shoot at by Marc-Andre Fleury, winning in his 600th NHL game. \nWinnik drew an interference call on the Pens to negate that man-advantage, but there was a rough stretch of that period for the Leafs. Evgeni Malkin, forgotten the past few days in all the talk about Crosby’s slump and Kessel vs. Leafs, danced around Arcobello and found the far side, unassisted. On the next rush, a deflected Sergei Plotnikov shot went right to Olli Maatta, who fired it home. \nBut Bernier, who needed a strong game after Reimer picked up Toronto’s first win the night before in Columbus, made a stunning glove save on Patric Hornqvist from a second-period draw and stared down five Pittsburgh power plays. \nEarlier in the game, Leafs captain Dion Phaneuf avoided an interference call when he dumped Malkin into Bernier’s crease and their ensuing exchange up ice helped open room for a Gardiner shot tipped by Leo Komarov. That was Komarov’s third consecutive goal since Friday and also stopped the Leafs from going scoreless in the opening period for five consecutive games, which hadn’t happened since 1931. \nNazem Kadri and Peter Holland also had strong two-way games for the Leafs, while Malkin was denied a couple of times after his initial goal. \n“Just never give up,” Gardiner said. “Last year, we might have folded (after surrendering two so quickly).” \nThree ex-Penguins were in Toronto’s lineup. Nick Spaling and young defenceman Scott Harrington came in the Kessel trade, while Winnik, returned to the Leafs as a UFA after a deadline trade. \nToronto gets a three-day break before two more road games in Buffalo and Montreal.
