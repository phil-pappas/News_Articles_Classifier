(Logan Bowles/USA TODAY Sports) The Sports Xchange \nHouston Texans quarterback Ryan Mallett missed the team charter to Miami for Sunday's game against the Dolphins. \nAccording to multiple reports, Mallett took a commercial flight later Saturday. Mallett is the backup to Brian Hoyer for Sunday's game. \nDuring training camp, Mallett missed a practice -- two days after Texans coach Bill O'Brien named Brian Hoyer the Week 1 starting quarterback. Mallett said he overslept. \nAfter Hoyer struggled in Week 1, Mallett entered later in the game and became the starter in Week 2. \nMallett went 1-3 as the starter and in the Texans' Week 5 game against the Indianapolis Colts, O'Brien switched back to Hoyer in the second quarter when Mallett left the game for what he thought would be just one play after a rough hit. \nHoyer finished the game, completing 24 of 31 passes with 312 yards, two touchdowns and one interception. Mallett drew heavy scrutiny and criticism as cameras captured him standing apart from his teammates with his arms crossed while wearing an angry expression on his face. \nHoyer regained his starting job and led the Texans to a 31-20 win over the Jacksonville Jaguars last week.
