Television and kickoff information for that game will be announced on Monday. The Tide did not look much better in defeating Tennessee, 19-14, Saturday afternoon. \nLSU’s struggling secondary proved porous against Western Kentucky quarterback Brandon Doughty, who completed 16 of 30 passes for 128 yards in the first half with a 7-yard touchdown pass to tailback Anthony Wales early in the second quarter to tie the game 7-7. Through three quarters, Doughty was 24 of 41 for 232 yards with two touchdowns, and the Hilltoppers had 314 total yards to 373 by LSU entering the fourth quarter. \nDoughty, who entered the game second in the nation in passing yards with 2,709, finished 37 of 61 for 325 yards with three touchdowns and one interception as Western Kentucky collected 24 first downs to 21 by LSU. \nThe Tigers did play without two veteran defensive starters - three-year starting cornerback Tre’Davious White of Shreveport and two-year starting defensive tackle Christian LaCouture. Both have minor injuries and did not play so as to get closer to 100 percent for the Alabama game. \nLSU’s secondary had trouble covering Western Kentucky’s receivers and tackling its running backs as different defensive backs kept checking into the game in the first half. On Western Kentucky’s first touchdown drive, LSU safety Rickey Jefferson badly missed a tackle on tailback D’Andre Ferby, who rambled 35 yards to set up the score. Backup cornerback Ed Paris played more than usual because of White’s absence, and he had problems in coverage. \nAfter LSU took a 17-7 with 10:26 to play in the third quarter on a 34-yard field goal by Trent Domingue, Doughty found wide receiver Antwane Grant for a 39-yard touchdown pass to get the Hilltoppers with 17-13 midway in the third quarter, but Garrett Schwettman missed the extra point. \nLSU responded with a 38-yard drive in six plays for a 43-yard field goal by Domingue that put it up 20-13 with 6:42 to go in the third quarter. The Tigers went up 27-13 on a 1-yard touchdown run by tailback Leonard Fournette, but that was three plays after LSU recovered a fumbled kickoff at the Western Kentucky 24. Fournette finished with 150 yards on 26 carries. \nThe Tigers stretched the lead to 34-13 on a 61-yard touchdown pass by quarterback Brandon Harris to true freshman wide receiver Tyron Johnson at the 2:06 mark of the third quarter. \nHarris put together his third straight impressive game as the sophomore from Bossier City completed 11 of 20 passes for 286 yards and three touchdowns with no interceptions. Harris averaged 26 yards a completion, and had touchdown passes of 61 yards to true freshman Tyron Johnson, 55 yards to wide receiver Malachi Dupre and 17 yards to Travin Dural. \nStill, LSU’s secondary was open all night. Doughty found wide receiver Taywan Taylor all alone in the right flat on yet another busted coverage by the Tigers for a 9-yard touchdown that cut LSU’s lead to 34-20 with 13:04 to play in the game. Western Kentucky drove 65 yards in 10 plays in 4:02 for that score, then recovered its onside kick. \nLSU’s defense stiffened, though, and the Tigers took over on downs at the 50-yard line. Five plays later, Harris threw a bullet to Dural for a 17-yard touchdown and 41-20 lead with 8:46 to play. \nLSU true freshman tailback Derrius Guice added a 47-yard touchdown dash with 1:49 to play for the 48-20 final. \nThe Tigers’ offense was sluggish through the majority of the first half. After Harris threw a perfect 55-yard touchdown to Dupre for a 7-0 lead on LSU’s first possession of the game, LSU did not score again until late in the second quarter. Tailback Darrel Williams scored on a 2-yard run with 1:25 to play in the second quarter for a 14-7 halftime lead after Harris hit Dural for a 67-yard completion. \nDural finished with five catches for 132 yards.
