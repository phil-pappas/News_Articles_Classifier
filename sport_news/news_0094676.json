There were a lot of people downtown. People danced and hung out. They seemed like they really had a good time.” \nLucy Finegan of Gilroy also won a reserve badge, which will be good for all seven days the tournament is in town, including the three days before the first tee and all four days of the Women’s Open. \nThose who arrived at the popup park on the corner of Monterey and East Third streets, were also treated to a welcome by Sharks General Manager Doug Wilson. \nThose interested in purchasing tickets before they rise in price may visit 2016uswomensopen.com . \nTickets are $70 for a two-day flex pass, $150 for all seven days and $200 for a reserve ticket. \nMore information is available on the women’s open website.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T00:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T10:42:04.188+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
