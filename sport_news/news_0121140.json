The Cougars walked away from the Big House licking their wounds as they were shut out 31-0. This is a new week and a new month for BYU as they get ready to face an opponent they know a little better. \nBYU will face off against the UConn Huskies Friday night at LaVell Edwards Stadium in a rematch from last year's opener in Storrs, Connecticut. Last year the Huskies were no match for Taysom Hill and the BYU offense as the Cougars beat UConn 35-10 and Hill threw for 308 and three touchdowns. The former starting QB also added 97 yards on the ground and two more TDs. \nSo, what can we learn from last year's game against the Huskies and Cougars as well look forward to Friday? We can learn that these two teams are different from last year. \nQB play \nBoth the Huskies and Cougars are starting new QBs behind center this Friday. Last year Hill had a big day for BYU and UConn played two QBs, Casey Cochran and Chandler Whitmer. Neither had an impressive night. \nShirreffs is having an OK season as he's thrown for 847 yards, four TDs and one interception and led UConn to a two-and-two start. \nBoth QBs have had some great moments and also some rough moments. \nThe biggest discrepancy going into this game as opposed to last year's match up is the absence of Taysom Hill. \n\nLast year the Cougars had a solid day on the ground, amassing 205 yards and two TDs. Remember, however, that 97 of those yards and both TDs came courtesy of Taysom Hill. \nUConn's leading rusher, Arkeel Newsome, has 153 yards on the season and averages 4.8 per carry. Newsome played in the game last year and had just three carries for 10 yards. His longest was seven yards. \nShirreffs can toss the ball around the field, but if BYU can stuff the run like they did last year it will force UConn to beat them through the air, and BYU's defensive backs have played well enough this year to keep the game in their favor. \nExperience \nWhen the Cougars and Huskies met last year it was the first game for both teams. This year they're meeting in week five. Both teams have shaken off the rust (we hope) and have a better idea of their identities than last year. \nBoth teams are currently boasting a .500 record headed into Friday night's game and a win could set their season back on course. \nGame time \nKickoff between the Cougars and Huski", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T06:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T08:51:03.884+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
