The idea has drawn some consideration as a way to invigorate the area.\nOn Sept. 9, as part of its ongoing discussions regarding the central business district, the Glencoe Plan Commission reviewed a series of concepts by village planner Lee Brown of what could become of the southern portion of downtown, where there is less commercial activity than in the northern region. One idea proposed was converting the public works garage on Village Court to another type of use, possibly a small hotel.\nWith the new Writers Theatre scheduled to open on Tudor Court next year, Brown said there could be enough visitors to have a lodging location, but said a decision remains far down the road.\n\"It makes sense from a connection of uses that are already here and are coming,\" Brown said. \"The bottom line is hotels are difficult to finance and they require a lot of study.\"\nHarriet Resnick, a Chicago Botanic Garden vice president who also is on the plan commission, said many of the people who travel to the Garden tend to stay at hotels in Highland Park and Northbrook.\nResnick was interested in the concept, but reserved final judgment until a market analysis is completed.\n\"The market has to prevail as at the end of the day, someone has to own that hotel and run it. If the economics are there for them, great,\" Resnick said. \"If the economy is good, it might be fine, but if the economy isn't good, I don't want the hotel going out.\"\nCommissioner Louis Goldman expressed some skepticism about the idea, but wouldn't rule it out. \"I just wonder if there is enough demand,\" he said. \"I'd hate to have an inn sitting there and have it be empty all the time because there is no demand for it, but maybe there would be. It just needs to be studied.\"\nThe commissioners emphasized there would not be a massive hotel; more like a small inn of about 40 rooms. The idea of a relatively small facility pleased Glencoe Chamber of Commerce Executive Director Sally Sprowl.\n\"It would be an enhancement for our business district, but I liked the distinction that was made between hotel and inn,\" Sprowl said. \"I also appreciated the conversation about context and scale.\"\nOther concepts that Brown envisioned for the site were apartments, condominiums and additional parking.\n\"At this stage, we wanted them to think about the form of buildings and not what goes in them,\" Brown added. \"They just happened to think the idea of a hotel fits very well with what else is going on downtown.\"\nBrown also said the status quo could remain, leaving the public works garage, which is almost an acre in size, remaining in place.\nThe public works garage was identified earlier this year as a potential new location for Glencoe's water plant as the current one is 87 years old and the village has been looking at ways to supply its future water needs.\nIf the decision were made to move the garage, a possible destination for a new place to store the vehicles would be on a 2.5-acre site at 1900 Frontage Road, which is on the western edge of Glencoe, and is owned by the village.\nRegardless of what is done with the public works site, Brown said there was a need to change the appearance of Temple Court as he cited concerns about the landscaping, lighting and pedestrian friendliness.\n\"One way or the other, we need an enhancement to the character of that roadway,\" Brown said.\nChairwoman Caren Thomas said there are no proposals at the moment for redeveloping the public works site; she just wanted everyone to be prepared in case that day were to come.\nThe plan commission is expected to continue to study ways to change downtown before making some recommendations to the village board, which could come by the end of the year.\nDaniel I.
