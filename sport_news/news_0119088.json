Posted Oct. 23, 2015 at 12:01 AM Updated at 11:44 PM Posted Oct. 23, 2015 at 12:01 AM Updated at 11:44 PM FORT WALTON BEACH – It was difficult to glean anything positive from the first half of Choctaw's 35-28 loss to Tate. Sawyer Smith torched the Indians both with his feet and right arm for 198 yards and three touchdowns. Alondo Thompkins and Dee Thompson ran over and through Choctaw tacklers for a combined 172 yards and a touchdown, Thompkins trucking one tackler and stiff-arming the other at midfield on a 76-yard run worthy of an ESPN Top 10 play. Meanwhile Choctaw kicker Jose Mendoza, a week after a two-for-two effort against Niceville, missed three field goals (35, 37 and 42 yards). Just seven points on 240 yards, the Indians trailing 26-7 headed into the locker rooms. Choctaw, despite Jake Fairly’s three rushing scores and a 13-yard touchdown toss to Marquise Kane to cut it to 35-28 with 1:57 to play, never dug itself out of the three-possession hole. Fairly, who threw for 355 yards, was picked off by Howard Penton with 20 seconds left and Choctaw’s second half heroics ended despite outscoring the Aggies 21-9 in the final 24 minutes of play. Yet, taking the glass-half-full approach, there was a silver lining. Yes, Choctaw’s playoff picture remains the same. While no loss is easy to stomach, especially the Indians’ fourth this year by a single possession, this was merely a final tuneup for Choctaw’s district finale next week. The same goes for Tate, which travels to Pine Forest next week for the district 1-6A title. Choctaw, losers of two straight and falling to 4-4 on the season, is 1-1 in league play and hosts District 3-6A rival Fort Walton Beach next week. Win and the Indians are at least assured of a three-way tiebreaker with Niceville and Crestview. If Niceville beats Crestview, the Indians are playoff-bound for the third straight season and likely headed to the District-4 champion somewhere near Jacksonville. Reminiscent of 2012, the Indians appear snakebitten considering their previous losses came by margins of one point to Rickards, two to Navarre and three to Niceville, which handed Tate its only loss in a 35-32 victory. Showing how close Choctaw is to putting it together, those three teams are a collective 21-3. In 2012, the Indians went 1-6 on games decided by a possession. Yet this team’s playoff odds are much greater as they enter as heavy favorites against their crosstown rival, which is 1-7. Fairly sprayed his 25 completions all over, connecting with Kane eight times for 130 yards and a score, Richie Grant 11 times for 107 yards and Vhadel Merrill three times for 50 yards. Kane tacked on 70 rushing yards, yet Tate’s backfield outgained Choctaw 405-113. It was Fairly who led the Indians back in the second half, beginning with a 1-yard touchdown run following a 55-yard pass to Kane to trim the deficit to 26-14. After an Evan Legassey 33-yard field goal, Fairly then converted a fourth-and-goal at the 1 with a keeper up the middle to cut the lead to 29-21. Page 2 of 2 - Thompkins, though, answered with an 18-yard touchdown run. Fairly’s 13-yard touchdown toss to Kane kept the Indians alive but, after failing on the onside kick and then getting the ball back with 57 seconds left, the Indians’ comeback bid fell short. Winners of four straight to improve to 7-1, it was Tate’s fourth straight game with at least 32 points, a number that was almost reached by halftime. Smith ended the night 10 of 16 for 159 yards and two touchdowns – 26 and 33 yard strikes to Jake Henry – with two interceptions. He tacked on 66 rushing yards and a 5-yard touchdown run in the first half. Thompson and Thompkins, meanwhile, both eclipsed the 100-yard mark with a combined 339 yards and two touchdowns.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T07:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T07:55:17.753+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
