By : Reuters | on 12:15 PM October 16, 2015 Category : Sports , Baseball/Softball \nDaniel Murphy hit the go-ahead home run as the New York Mets beat the Los Angeles Dodgers 3-2 in the decisive fifth game of the National League Division Series on Thursday at Dodger Stadium. \nMurphy's sixth-inning homer off Dodgers right-hander Zack Greinke was his third of the series and lifted the Mets into the NL Championship Series against the Chicago Cubs. \nThe opener of the best-of-seven series is on Saturday at Citi Field in New York. \nMets starter Jacob deGrom (2-0) struggled early on but regrouped and finished strong. He gave up two runs in the first but settled and allowed six hits with seven strikeouts and three walks in six innings. \nNoah Syndergaard relieved deGrom and worked a scoreless seventh before closer Jeurys Familia came on in the eighth for the six-out save. Familia retired all six batters he faced. \nGreinke (1-1), who might have pitched his last game for the Dodgers since he can opt out of his contract, gave up three runs on six hits with nine strikeouts and no walks in 6 2/3 innings. \nThe Mets jumped in front 1-0 in the first. With one out, Murphy's double scored right fielder Curtis Granderson, who led off with an infield hit. \nFour consecutive singles in the bottom of the inning allowed the Dodgers to rally. Third baseman Justin Turner and right fielder Andre Ethier brought home shortstop Corey Seager and first baseman Adrian Gonzalez for a 2-1 Los Angeles lead. \nIn the fourth, Murphy opened with a single and advanced to second on a walk to first baseman Lucas Duda. Murphy continued running past second and stole third on the walk, as Turner left his position at third prematurely with no one covering as he headed to the right side of the diamond for a shift on the next batter, catcher Travis d'Arnaud. \nD'Arnaud hit a sacrifice fly to left, scoring Murphy and knotting the score at 2-2. \nTurner, a former Met, doubled in the third and fifth innings to give him a franchise-record six for the series, breaking Hanley Ramirez's mark of four set in the 2013 NLDS against the Atlanta Braves. \nReuters", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T01:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T09:30:53.902+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
