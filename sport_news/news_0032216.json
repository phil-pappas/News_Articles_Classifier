Searcy took the lead for good on a 49-yard scoring run from Dixon on the next play from scrimmage. \n\"It's a big win, especially for playoff seeding. Our guys had a super week of practice, probably our best since I've been here at Searcy,\" said Lions Coach Mark Kelley. \"We had some mental lapses, but we didn't let it phase us. We fought through it.\" \nLeading 21-7, Searcy came up with an interception at their own 44-yard line and the Lions cashed in on first down when Neaville found Wallace Robinson Jr. from 10 yards to take a 28-7 halftime lead. \n\"We just got outplayed,\" said Marion Coach Jed Davis. \"Name a facet of the game and they did it better tonight. It was awful and we got what we deserved.\" \nMarion junior running back Tom Young scored from 49 yards out to cut the score to 35-14, but Searcy would answer that six plays later when Neaville found Robinson for a second touchdown. \n\"We just have such a great group of seniors,\" stated Kelley. \"They've fought so hard. They've gone through a ton of adversity in their time here, but we want to keep some positive momentum for this program.\" \nLR CENTRAL 41, \nMOUNTAIN HOME 7 \nFreshman Oscar Adaway had 13 carries for 135 yards and 3 touchdowns to lead Little Rock Central (2-4, 2-1) to a 7A/6A-East victory over Mountain Home (0-3, 1-5). \nRichard Hayes added 9 carries for 83 yards and 1 touchdown, Zachary Mc-Fadden caught 2 passes for 114 yards and 1 touchdown and Caleb Dallimore completed 2 of 3 passes for 114 yards and rushed 22 yards for another touchdown for the Tigers. \n6A-SOUTH \nLR PARKVIEW 35, LR HALL 6 \nQuarterback Kolian Jackson had three total touchdowns to lead Parkview (4-2, 1-2 6A-South) past Hall (0-6, 0-3). \nJackson was 8-for-14 passing for 154 yards and a touchdown, a 29-yard throw to Kolby McNeal.
