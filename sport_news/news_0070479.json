Armas, The Associated Press Lincoln Courier By Genaro C. Armas, The Associated Press Posted Oct. 3, 2015 at 12:01 AM By Genaro C. Armas, The Associated Press Posted Oct. 3, 2015 at 12:01 AM MILWAUKEE — Jake Arrieta struck out seven in six strong innings, and the Chicago Cubs beat the Milwaukee Brewers 6-1 on Friday night but couldn’t gain on Pittsburgh in the race to host the National League wild card game. Anthony Rizzo had two hits and three RBIs, including a solo homer into the Cubs bullpen in right in the fourth off Ariel Pena (2-1). Arrieta (22-6) allowed two singles in his final tuneup before the postseason. His ERA dropped to 1.77. His next start will likely come against Pittsburgh in the NL wild card game. The Pirates hold a two-game lead on the Cubs in the race to host the game with three games left in the regular season. The Pirates beat Cincinnati 6-4 in 12 innings Friday night. The Brewers finally broke through after Arrieta yielded to the bullpen in the seventh. Khris Davis hit a homer, his 27th, off Trevor Cahill. Otherwise, it felt like Wrigley Field North at times on Friday with all the Cubs fans at Miller Park cheering on another dominating outing by Arrieta. The Cy Young Award contender improved to 11-0 since Aug. 1. Chicago added two runs in the fifth after Milwaukee center fielder Logan Schafer bumped into right fielder Domingo Santana while going for a routine fly ball. The ball bounced off a glove and fell to the ground, allowing Kris Bryant to reach on an error and load the bases for Rizzo. The left-handed slugger roped a two-run single to center for a 4-0 lead. Pena allowed five hits, two walks and four runs while striking out six in 4 1/3 innings. By Genaro C. Armas, The Associated Press Lincoln Courier By Genaro C.
