All-business Americans surge to Presidents Cup lead 1 / 4 Back to Gallery INCHEON, South Korea — The Presidents Cup wasn’t an hour old when Nick Price looked at the scoreboard and had that sinking feeling.\nIt was filled with American red.\nAnd there wasn’t much Price or the International team could do about it Thursday in an opening session that ended just like so many others in this one-sided affair.\nPhil Mickelson and Zach Johnson capped off a performance that was as businesslike as their handshakes, and the Americans had a 4-1 lead after foursomes in which they never trailed in any match except the one they lost.\n“A tough day for us,” Price said. “Having said that, we are only five points into 30. We still have another 25 points left out there. So we’ve got a long way to go, and that’s that I told my team. Just to keep their chins up and do the best they can tomorrow.”\nThe International team was adamant that the number of matches be reduced — it was lowered from 34 to 30 — to keep it a close contest. After one day, maybe having one less match Thursday helped.\nIt could have been worse.\nThe Americans, who have lost the Presidents Cup only one time since it began in 1994 and are going for their sixth straight victory, had a lead after the opening session for the fifth straight time. The margin was their largest since a four-point lead in 2007 at Royal Montreal .\nThat makes the five matches of fourballs Friday even more critical.\nU.S. captain Jay Haas put Texas-ex Jordan Spieth and Dustin Johnson in the first match, followed by Rickie Fowler and Boerne’s Jimmy Walker .\n“He’s going for the kill,” Price said. “If we get momentum going, it can change things.”\nAll the momentum belonged to the Americans on Thursday.\nBubba Watson and J.B. Holmes ran off four straight birdies early in their match against Adam Scott and Hideki Matsuyama , and that set the tone. They wound up winning a tight match when Scott and Matsuyama missed key putts and ended it on the 16th hole.\n“That was my whole goal,” Watson said. “Get out there fast, change the color so the other guys see that and it sparks them going forward.”\nThe lone International win came from Louis Oosthuizen and Branden Grace , who took advantage of some sloppy play by Matt Kuchar and Patrick Reed to win 3-and-2. Kuchar hit a tee shot into the water on No. 11, and hit a wedge so far on No. 14 it didn’t even reach the creek.", "external_links": ["http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/32/61/8760427/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/32/61/8760428/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/32/61/8760429/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/32/61/8760428/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/32/61/8760427/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/32/61/8760431/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/32/61/8760429/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/32/61/8760431/3/920x920.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-09T03:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T04:27:07.674+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
