It was Crawford's third title defense in his hometown. \nThe Haitian-born Jean (29-2), who fights out of Montreal, landed only a few good shots on Crawford, and that only seemed to motivate the champ more. \nWearing orange-and-black trunks with his signature \"Omaha\" across the back, Crawford came out as the aggressor and seemed to flummox Jean with his southpaw stance. \nHe knocked down Jean with a left hook late in the first round, staggered him late in the second and knocked him down again late in the ninth with a left-right-left combination. \nAt the bell ending the fourth, the dazed Jean walked all the way to Crawford's corner before a smiling Crawford pointed him the opposite direction. \nA hard left followed by a flurry of punches nearly brought down Jean in the fifth, and when the round ended, Crawford jumped up and down in the middle of the ring and spun his fists in a circle as if he were upset he didn't finish off his overmatched opponent. \nJean landed a couple punches to the head in the eighth, and that only seemed to infuriate Crawford, who peppered Jean until the bell. \nBillionaire investor Warren Buffett, known as the \"Oracle of Omaha,\" was with Crawford in the locker room an hour before the fight as the champ was taping his hands. Buffett, who arrived at the arena wearing a red Nebraska Cornhuskers jacket and khakis, is a boxing aficionado and longtime friend of Crawford. \nAll content copyright ©2015 Pendleton Times-Post, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T06:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T06:27:32.480+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
