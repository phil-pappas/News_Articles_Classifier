I hadn't got the biggest expectations for the game as we only had three days together and Tottenham are a strong and tuned team. It could have been difficult so I'm really satisfied,” Klopp said. \nChelsea had made their worst start to a top-flight season since 1978-79, prompting the club to issue a vote of confidence in Mourinho amid reports of a dressing room mutiny. \nBut they were on course for a first win in four matches in all competitions after a shambolic mix-up between Villa goalkeeper Brad Guzan and Joleon Lescott in the 34th minute allowed Diego Costa to mark his return from a three-game ban with his third goal of the season. \nCosta played a signficant role in Chelsea's second goal as well, this time the Spain striker's attempted shot took a big deflection off Alan Hutton for an unfortunate own goal by the Villa defender. \n“At the moment, some of my players have lost confidence,” Mourinho said. \n“But they showed their desire, that they are together and that there were ready to fight for a crucial result.” \nBarren run \nAt Eastlands, City took just seven minutes to go in front when Sterling prodded past goalkeeper Adam Federici. \nCity struck again four minutes later when Ivory Coast striker Wilfried Bony tapped in after Federici made a hash of claiming a cross. \nBournemouth's Glenn Murray scored in the 22nd minute, only for England winger Sterling to add City's third in the 29th minute. \nSterling completed his treble in first half stoppage-time and Bony struck again in the 89th minute. \nEmotions were running high at Goodison following the death of Kendall aged 69 and there was a minute's silence prior to kick-off, while Everton's players wore black armbands as a mark of respect. \nBut third placed United, who remain two points behind City, took the lead through Morgan Schneiderlin's first goal since his pre-season move from Southampton in the 18th minute. \nSpanish midfielder Ander Herrera doubled United's advantage with a 22nd minute header. \nUnited captain Rooney hadn't scored an away league goal since November last year, but the former Everton forward ended that 17-match barren run with a clinical near-post finish in the 62nd minute. \n“I said to my players I'm very proud of them because it is one of our best matches. We needed that because Everton are a very good team,” United manager Louis van Gaal said. \nArsene Wenger's Arsenal, two points adrift of City, went ahead when Chile forward Sanchez slotted home in the 62nd minute to maintain his red-hot form. \nSubstitute Olivier Giroud added the second six minutes later and Aaron Ramsey claimed the third from close-range in the 74th minute. \n“Alexis Sanchez is relentless going forward. He is very important for us,” Wenger said. \n“It was an important win for us. The confidence is there.” \nSam Allardyce's first match as Sunderland manager ended in a 1-0 defeat at West Bromwich Albion \nAllardyce was unable to secure Sunderland's first league win of the season as Saido Berahino netted in the 54th minute. \nWest Ham climbed to fourth place after a 3-1 success at 10-man Crystal Palace. \nLeicester staged another great escape as they came from two goals down to draw 2-2 at Southampton. — AFP", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T01:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T01:58:20.344+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
