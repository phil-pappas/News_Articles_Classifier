Muguruza beat sixth-seeded Angelique Kerber 6-4, 7-6 (5).\n\"It was a really tough match and I had to struggle today,\" Muguruza said. \"Venus is a legend. I'll have to go out there and do my best to win against her and I think it's going to be a great final.\"", "external_links": ["http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apcm", "http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apnm"], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T21:04:05.190+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
