He put MSU’s seven-pass, 156-yard, three-point second half on himself.\n“I can’t say that I wasn’t conservative, myself, in play-calling,” Warner said. “I mean, it might not have been a conscious attempt on our part offensive-staff wise, but looking back I probably was a little over-conservative and part of it had to do with weather, who we had on the offensive line, and we didn’t start the second half off throwing the ball well. ... Bottom line is, we’re 5-0, and I think we understand as we move forward, regardless of who we have out there on offense, that we’re gonna have to open things up a little bit more. So that’s a possibility.”\nIt’s more of a possibility for No. 4 MSU (1-0 Big Ten) on Saturday at Rutgers (2-2, 0-1 Big Ten) if it gets back one or both of its starting offensive tackles. Left tackle Jack Conklin and right tackle Kodi Kieler, both healing up knee injuries, are practicing this week. It would mean “a ton” to get them back, Warner said, but “at the same time, you don’t want to get them banged up again.”\nEven if both sit, MSU is doing all it can to cross-train everyone on the offensive line so coaches are more comfortable with deep drops for senior quarterback Connor Cook. Cook leads the Big Ten in passing efficiency (150.9 rating), but of the quarterbacks in the top 10 who have started all season, only Ohio State’s Cardale Jones has fewer pass attempts — 106 to Cook’s 124.\nAt some point, MSU is going to need rely more on Cook, but Warner said there’s no restlessness in his quarterback, just a shared desire to have offensive balance and score more points. MSU’s school-record streak of 30-point games was broken at 12 on Saturday, but the Spartans are tied with Baylor for the longest active streak of games with 24 points or more, at 20 and counting.\n“Connor is fine,” Warner said. “Obviously, I talk with those guys, meet with them. He’s a team guy, and he knows that there’s a lot to go left in this season and our goals are out there in front of us, and he’s ready to do what he’s got to do. Week by week.”\nMSU's defensive line wants its \"A\"-level production back More players back, perhaps: MSU’s offense also missed tight end Josiah Price (ankle) and receiver Macgarrett Kings Jr. (undisclosed) against Purdue, and fullback Trevon Pendleton left the game with an undisclosed injury. Warner said all three were “moving around” on the practice field Tuesday, and he’s hopeful they can return for Rutgers.\nThey’re part of an injury epidemic so severe, Warner couldn’t recall a comparison.\n“Certainly not in our time here at Michigan State, and I’m not sure I remember it in my career,” said Warner, who began coaching in 1982 as a graduate assistant at his alma mater, Syracuse. “It’s been pretty severe. But again, no excuses. It’s just, it’s opportunities. And guys have stepped in and taken advantage of those opportunities, and we need for that to continue.”\nDefensive line depth: MSU defensive line coach Ron Burton said there’s nothing new on backup end Montez Sweat, who has been suspended for the past three games for an undisclosed violation of team rules. He said he’s been “pleasantly surprised” with backup end Demetrius Cooper and wants to get him more snaps.\nBurton said reserve tackle Craig Evans has done a good job of maturing and shedding weight, after Evans was suspended for most of spring ball for an undisclosed reason.\n“He has come a ways, and he still has a ways to go,” Burton said. “But he has put himself in a position to be on the field. We feel comfortable putting him (in). We just want consistency.”\nContact Joe Rexrode: jrexrode@freepress.com. Follow him on Twitter @joerexrode .
