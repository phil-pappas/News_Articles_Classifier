Just the way he plays and with our relationship, it means a lot to me and I’m proud of the way he played today.” \nStewart finished with a season-high 114 receiving yards on six catches, three of which went for a combined 70 yards in the fourth quarter, including making a leaping 29-yard completion on the second play of Alabama’s go-ahead touchdown drive with five minutes left in the game Saturday. \nStewart’s final catch — during which he had to adjust and jump over Volunteers cornerback Justin Martin on a fade route — instantly infused life back into the Tide offense that just watched their Tennessee counterparts race down the field 75 yards in four plays to pull ahead 14-13 on a 12-yard touchdown run from running back Jalen Hurd with 5:49 remaining. \n“He made some great plays for us,” Alabama junior tight end O.J. Howard said of Stewart. “We need him to continue to do that and I know he will.” \nAfter initially being reviewed, the 29-yard completion to Stewart helped set the stage for another big fade, this one for 15 yards to Ridley three plays later, before bruising Tide tailback Derrick Henry closed the door on Tennessee with a 14-yard touchdown run with 21/2 minutes left to play. \nStewart also came through with back-to-back big plays on Alabama’s previous scoring drive when he caught a 15-yard completion on third-and-11 to cross midfield and then had a 26-yard catch on first-and-20 after a holding call moved the Tide out of field goal range. \nAccording to many of his teammates, Saturday’s performance is the kind of game many have expected from Stewart all season long. \n“I just know ArDarius is a playmaker, and I know that when we need him, he’s going to be there for us,” senior slot receiver Richard Mullaney said last month. \nStill, despite leading the team in receptions and targets through the first five weeks of the season, it’s been clear in recent weeks that Ridley has become Alabama’s go-to receiving option, leading the team in most receiving categories with 25 catches for 350 yards over the previous four weeks entering Saturday’s game with Tennessee. \nStewart, meanwhile, had fallen off considerably, to the point of having just eight catches for 105 yards during that same span, including just a single four-yard reception a week ago at Texas A&M. \nWhile praising Ridley’s play earlier this month, Saban once again used the opportunity to send a message to the rest of his receivers to step up their games along with the talented freshman. \n“We just need to get more guys at the receiver position to have that kind of confidence and that kind of consistency,” Saban said Oct. 5, the Monday after Ridley broke out with a team-high five catches for 120 yards against Georgia, “that kind of preparation, that kind of attention to detail that’s going to have us have more players that can make explosive plays on the perimeter.” \nAnd on Saturday, Stewart finally answered the call, emerging as the big-play receiver his coaches and teammates have known him to be all along. \n“He played great. You know, he’s had a lot of opportunities to make plays and he’s had three or four big plays like that that were just-misses,” Saban said Saturday, “and today he made a great catch and it couldn’t have come at a better time. I’m sure that’ll help his confidence, but he played really well today.” Read or Share this story: http://on.mgmadv.com/1S55QK7 TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T03:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T12:15:33.707+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
