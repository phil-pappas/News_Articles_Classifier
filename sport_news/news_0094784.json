ST. LOUIS (AP) — Mikhail Grabovski scored his first goal of the season 4 minutes into overtime and the New York Islanders beat the St. Louis Blues 3-2 on Saturday night.\nJohn Tavares scored his fifth of the season and extended his point-scoring streak to six games for the Islanders.\nFrans Nielsen had two assists, including on Grabovski’s winning goal. Rookie defenseman Colton Parayko had a goal and assist in the third for the injury-depleted Blues, who outshot the Islanders 40-22.\nSt. Louis will be without forwards Jaden Schwartz (broken ankle) and Paul Stastny (broken foot) for an extended period.\nKyle Okposo had a power-play goal in the first period for the Islanders, who have won five of six and bounced back smartly a night after losing at home to Boston.\nTavares has four goals and six assists during his streak and has 23 points his last 13 regular season games.\nParayko ended the Blues’ scoreless slump at 103:33 on a high drive from the point on the first shot of the third, the drive apparently ticking off the jersey of a defender past Thomas Greiss at 2:26.\nChris Lee/AP Islanders goalie Thoams Greiss stops a shot from Blues' Colton Parayko. Steen tied it with 9:09 to go on a deflection on another point shot by Parayko after Islanders defenseman Nick Leddy first deflected the puck.\nThe Blues had won five in a row against the Islanders before falling short in their first home game since beating Edmonton in the opener.\nAnders Lee set a nice screen for Okposo’s shot from the left point with 3:08 to go in the first.\nTavares bought space with a fake on defenseman Jay Bouwmeester before beating Brian Elliott with 1:19 left in the second.\nNOTES: Former Blues D Bob Plager wore a No. 6 jersey in tribute to the late Jimmy Roberts when he escorted a cancer survivor to center ice for the ceremonial puck drop.\nRoberts, who died at age 75 on Friday, was to have dropped the puck. ... Rookie F Robby Fabbri (concussion) is expected to rejoin the lineup on Tuesday. ... D Kevin Shattenkirk (lower body) was among the Blues’ scratches. ... Islanders D Marek Zidlicky was a healthy scratch, ending a streak of 142 consecutive starts.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T06:09:27.216+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
