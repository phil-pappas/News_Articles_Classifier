People hear red or blue, depending on their allegiance.\nSince 1892, Centennial and Central high schools have played football at the center of southern Colorado in the state's most passionate clash, scrapping for the right to ring a bell in the sound of their color. It's the oldest rivalry west of the Mississippi River, by far the biggest in Colorado, and regularly draws more fans than the big-school state championship games at Sports Authority Field at Mile High.\nThe red-adorned Bulldogs of Centennial and the blue-dressed Wildcats of Central play for a painted bell once retrieved from a locomotive that delivered coal to the CF&I steel mill in the middle of the city.\nThe Pueblo Central Wildcats celebrate winning back the bell after it belonged to Pueblo Centennial for five years. Central held on during a frantic finish to defeat the Bulldogs 27-24 at historic Dutch Clark Stadium. ( Andy Cross, The Denver Post ) Outsiders hear that bell clang. The people of Pueblo hear red or blue.\nThey call it the Bell Game.\n\"If you tried to get rid of the Bell Game, there would be places burning down,\" Central assistant principal David Craddock said. \"It's that ingrained in our culture.\"\nOn Friday, Oct. 2, before the game's 115th meeting, the bell rang red. Centennial won the Bell Game a year ago, so the bell sat on the red sideline.\nPueblo long ago faded as a thriving steel town, but on one fall night each year, a football game wakes up the ghosts of great games and football heroes from long ago. The Bell Game, the rivalry that both united and divided Pueblo for more than a century, thrives.\nPueblo is far from dead. Long live the Bell Game.\nAdvertisement Pregame butterflies\nDevean Johnson looked nervous enough to throw up. The junior lineman sat in Central's cramped locker room with his eyes shut and his cheeks puffed out as he took slow breaths. The sound outside grew louder as kickoff neared.\nThe bell rang red on Centennial's side of Dutch Clark Stadium, but Devean couldn't hear it. The sound early Friday evening, just before the sun set, was the roar of more than 15,000 fans — separated by color with a football field in the middle. Centennial sold out its 7,500 tickets Wednesday, Central on Thursday.\nPueblo Centennial fans throw colored baby powder into the air to signal the start of the Bell Game against Pueblo Central. ( Andy Cross, The Denver Post ) Centennial's five-year run of Bell Game victories was the longest streak in the series' history.\n\"BELL RINGS RED! BELL RINGS RED!\" Centennial's side screamed from the east stands.\n\"It's loud,\" said Johnson, a 6-foot, 295-pound two-way junior tackle. \"When you come out and you see everything, you get worried. But once you get the first play over with, it's just a game.\"\nOf all the players in this year's game, Johnson's lineage reached back the furthest. He's a fourth-generation Central football player. His dad and grandfather both played in the Bell Game. His great-grandfather, Jimmie Wilson, quarterbacked the Wildcats in the 1950s.\n\"When I played, you couldn't go past the Arkansas River,\" said Wilson, 79, who's married to Loretta, his high school girlfriend from Central.\nThe Pueblo Central student section makes itself known. The school itself is located on Orman Avenue in Pueblo. ( Andy Cross, The Denver Post ) \"Centennial stayed over there, and we stayed on our side.\"\nCentral in trouble?\nCentral's hopes of ringing the bell blue fell to its senior quarterback, Mike Ranson. The best player on the field, Ranson was pure athleticism, running and gunning from a multiset, pro-style offense.\nIn the first quarter Ranson faked a screen pass, then ran up the middle, bounced off a defender and scurried for a 46-yard gain. Soon after he tossed a 17-yard touchdown pass to Donavyn Nailor-Lewis.\nCentennial, with its own pistol attack, bounced back early in the second quarter. Senior quarterback Jake Sanchez ran hard through two tacklers to the 1-yard line, setting up Richard Gonzales's scoring plunge on the next play.\nPueblo Central's Isiah Ayala scrambles for yardage against Pueblo Centennial in the first quarter. ( Andy Cross, The Denver Post ) After Sanchez converted a fourth-and-inches play late in the first half, Jumanne Transou booted a 30-yard field goal to put the Bulldogs ahead 10-7.\nCentral walked into the halftime break trailing — and with Ranson hobbling. In the final minute of the half, he was leveled by Centennial defensive end Dillon Gutierrez and injured his shoulder.\n14 years without rivalry\nThe Bell Game is as heated as it is historic. In 1907, Centennial's \"Little\" Jack Hopkins got punched during an end zone brawl, and a riot broke out. Police stormed the field. The schools paused the rivalry for 14 years to cool down the tensions.\nDutch Clark himself, namesake of the stadium where Centennial and Central now play, drew 3,500 fans to a game in 1925, the then-largest crowd in Pueblo's sporting history.\nClark, who went on to play pro ball for the Detroit Lions, was a city legend as a senior. In his final regular-season game, he ran roughshod over Centennial, scoring four touchdowns and drop-kicking five extra points.\nLong before Dutch Clark Stadium was built in 1950, Central played its football games at the corner of Orman Avenue and Madison Street, two blocks from the school. The field still stands.\n\"My grandpa, that's where they played their home games,\" Craddock said. \"That grass has been up there since the early 1900s. There's a reason why it's the best grass we have anywhere. You can't kill that damn grass.\"\nTough guy shows his stuff\nRanson toughed out his sore shoulder and ran back to the field. And on Central's first possession of the second half, he zig-zagged for a 51-yard scoring run to put the Wildcats up 13-10.\nOn Central's next possession, with Devean Johnson clearing a path off right tackle, Ranson scrambled for a 39-yard gain. Three minutes later, on a busted pass play, Ranson scrambled around left end for a makeshift 15-yard touchdown.\nCentral was pulling away.\n\"THE BELL RINGS BLUE!\" chants started roaring from the west side.\nBut Centennial rallied. A.J. Sena, a senior running back, careened off two defenders for a 9-yard touchdown run in the fourth quarter to cut Central's lead to 20-17.\nRanson responded with an 8-yard scoring pass to Isaiah Collins. But with less than three minutes remaining, Sena ran 5 yards for a score, cutting Central's lead to 27-24. Time was running short, however.\nTough times in 1980s\nThe smoldering smelter at the old Colorado Fuel and Iron steel plant was Pueblo's great economic leveler. Through two World Wars and decades of expansion, the city prospered and Italians, Latinos and Slovenians found a place to work their way into the middle class.\nBut by the 1980s, steel manufacturing was fading and the city, and its oldest schools, took a hit. Centennial moved from its grand original downtown building at 11th and Court streets, across the Arkansas River from Central, into newer digs up north.\n\"Lots of ghosts in that old building,\" said Janice Jones, who sat on Centennial's red side of the stadium with the Class of 1965, celebrating their 50th reunion.\n\"We're not a steel town anymore,\" she said. \"But there's a lot of good in Pueblo. Whole Foods sells Pueblo chiles in their stores now. The farmers had a big year.\"\nAt its height in the 1980s, CF&I employed more than 13,000 workers. By the 1990s, that number fell to near 1,000. Now owned by a Russian conglomerate, the mill sits nearly abandoned off to the side of Interstate 25 with a steelworkers museum nearby.\nEnrollments at Centennial and Central fell along with the city's population. Once Colorado's second most-populous city, it's now ninth, at 108,000. Centennial had 1,251 students when the Colorado High School Activities Association last set football division alignments in 2014, putting them in Class 4A, the smallest school in the Southern League. Central, with 827 students, fell into Class 3A's South Central.\n\"Our school has been run through the mud,\" Central football coach Jeremy Mercer said.\nRules for Red & Blue\nThe bell — a sturdy and classic brass ringer that rests in a pull cart — came from an old Colorado and Wyoming Railway engine. Lewis Rhoades, a local fan, donated it in 1950.\nSince then, the bell can change hands only under strict protocol.\nFirst, the winning school earns the right to paint the cart red or blue. But a two-inch strip on the underside, in the middle, must be painted in the rival school's color, as a sign of respect.\nSecond, if the defending winner loses, the captain of the cheer squad — and only she — must carry the bell to midfield and hand it personally to her fellow captain.\nEarly Friday morning, before this year's game, the bell sat in the back seat of Turene Lombard's Silverado truck. It was Lombard's job, as assistant coach of Centennial's cheer team, to drive the bell from the school to Dutch Clark Stadium.\n\"I was praying, 'Please don't hit me,' \" she said. \"If somebody hits me, who do I call? They will burn me at the stake if this goes wrong.\"\nChaos at the end\nPueblo football fans have learned to expect crazy in the Bell Game. So when Central, with less than minute left, fell an inch short on a fourth-and-1 attempt to run out the clock, the drama played to script.\nWhat came next added a twist.\nSanchez, limping, drove Centennial into scoring range. With 27 seconds remaining, he rolled right and hit Tito Mendiaz for a 12-yard gain. A personal foul penalty on Central put Centennial at the 10-yard line, easily in Transou's field-goal range, with nine seconds remaining. When the referee placed the ball between the hash marks, the clock started running. Centennial had a quick decision to make — try for the end zone and a game-winning TD; force overtime with a field goal; or spike the ball to stop the clock.\nBut the Bulldogs never got another snap amid the chaos as the final seconds ticked off.\nCentral improved to 4-2. Centennial dropped to 0-5.\n\"Anything can happen in the Bell Game — and usually it does,\" said Centennial coach Mike Palumbo. \"Even as coaches, it's so emotionally draining. And that's normal for this game.\"\nGiving up the bell\nThe bell rang red for the final time at 9:59 p.m. Centennial's cheer squad dragged the bell to midfield, and the captains exchanged the prize and shook hands. It rang blue at 10:03 p.m. for the first time since 2010.\n\"I started ringing the bell right away,\" Central's cheer captain, Miyalyn Arellano said. \"It was awesome.\"\nFor the next four hours, the bell rang without end. Central players took selfies with it on the field and in the locker room. They rang it on the ride back to school.\nThey rang it into the early hours Saturday morning in front of hundreds on the school's front steps off Orman Avenue.\n\"It's home. It's finally home,\" senior wide receiver Angel Chavez screamed.\nNick Groke: ngroke@denverpost.com or @nickgroke\nTop rivalries\nThe longest most-heated football rivalries in Colorado high school football:\n1.
