FIFA needs comprehensive and urgent reform, and that can only be accomplished through a truly independent approach.\" \nBlatter's own position has been weakened as lawyers oversee key decisions at scandal-battered FIFA and he waits to hear whether he will be suspended by the ethics committee. \nBlatter did address a leadership issue earlier Friday in FIFA's in-house magazine — but not his own. \nBlatter complained that quotas must be implemented to stop men dominating positions of power in football. \n\"Football continues to be dominated by men,\" Blatter wrote in FIFA Weekly. \"It is our duty to change this. Women must feel that they have an equal chance of succeeding in football as their male counterparts. \n\"FIFA, the confederations and our member associations have to break the cycle that makes it so much easier for men to ascend to positions of responsibility. This is not just a moral duty.\" \nBlatter said there is \"compelling evidence that gender-balanced organizations make better decisions and produce better results.\" \nThere are currently no female contenders in the race to succeed Blatter in the Feb. 26 election. FIFA President Sepp Blatter drives his car into the garage of the FIFA headquarters on his way to work in Zurich, Switzerland, Tuesday, Sept. 29, 2015. Blatter was questioned by Swiss investigators on Friday about why FIFA paid 2 million Swiss francs (about $2 million) to UEFA President Michel Platini in 2011 for work supposedly carried out at least nine years earlier.
