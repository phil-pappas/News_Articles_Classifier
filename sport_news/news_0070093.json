The Arch of Triumph was one of the most recognisable sites in Palmyra, which the IS group seized in May. The monumental arch sat atop the famed colonnaded streets of the ancient city, which linked the Roman Empire to Persia. An opposition activist who uses the name Khaled al-Homsi posted on Twitter late yesterday that the militants destroyed the arch. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the group blew up the arch but left the colonnades in place. Militants also recently blew up two famed First Century temples in Palmyra. — AP", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T12:20:41.931+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
