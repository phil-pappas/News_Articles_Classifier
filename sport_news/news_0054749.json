It's just a mentality this team has.\"\nOU started the season ranked No. 19 but wins over then-ranked Tennessee and West Virginia have moved it into the top 10. Of course, OU started last season ranked No. 4 before plummeting. The Sooners did hold on to beat Texas, 31-26, before the crash continued in earnest.\n\"We have to be cognizant of the tendency to let up and start looking at the rankings and looking at the stats and say 'hey, we're doing pretty good,'\" said senior center Ty Darlington. \"We've got so much room for improvement. ...That's been addressed. ...We're not going to start feeling ourselves a little bit. We're hungry.\"\nCoach Bob Stoops said his Sooners were unlikely to start feeling too good, as heavily favored as they may be in facing their Red River rival.\n\"We're not even five games into it,\" Stoops said. \"We've got to really push to make our improvement. ...It shouldn't be hard to remind them of what's been said about them for the last year. If they have any sense at all, they'll understand that. ...We haven't done anything yet.\"\nOU can beat Texas for the fifth time in six games. This is the third straight season that UT ventures into Fair Park unranked.\nThe Sooners have actually had a harder time of late with their Bedlam rivals, going 2-2 against Oklahoma State over the last four seasons.\nAfter Saturday, the Sooners continue Big 12 play, but the brunt of the schedule is on the back end, with a trip to Baylor and hosting TCU leading into visiting Oklahoma State over the final three weeks of the season.\nFor now, OU has spent the week reminding itself that anything can happen against rivals -- including watching footage of OU's loss to Texas in 2013 when the Sooners were favored. And beating the Longhorns still resonates, the Sooners say, or at least is required to keep contending for OU's first outright Big 12 title since 2010.\n\"It's huge for us, whether it's [Oklahoma State] or Texas, it's a game we've got to win every year,\" Sanchez said. \"Obviously the fans want us to win more than anything. For us, it's another Big 12 game, especially for what we're trying to accomplish this year; it's another game we've got to win.\"\nTwitter: @khairopoulos\nOn Twitter:\n @kHairopoulos", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/kHairopoulos", "https://twitter.com/khairopoulos"], "published": "2015-10-10T03:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T06:18:33.017+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
