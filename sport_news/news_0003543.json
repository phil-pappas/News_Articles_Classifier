Everyone seemed to know that what made September's supermoon special, on Sunday, Sept. 27, was that it would rise during a full eclipse of the moon.\nWhat we didn't know is what effect the eclipse would have. The crowd seemed to be hoping for a hazy globe of orange just above the horizon, but instead had to wait for more than an hour after moonrise before the moon revealed itself at all, high above the horizon.\nThe event was pretty much a dud!\nWell, the moon has a chance to redeem itself, because a supermoon is coming again Tuesday evening, Oct. 27, 2015.\nA supermoon is a term for when the moon is unusually close to the Earth, which makes it shine really big when it rises. By definition, a supermoon must be closer than 224,834 miles to Earth. If the weather cooperates, it should be quite a show this time, compared to September. There won't be an eclipse, so the moon will be very bright, clouds allowing.\nJust make sure you have a good view of the eastern sky. The moonrise is 6:40 p.m. PDT on Tuesday, but don't expect to see it immediately. Haze on the horizon can delay the moon's appearance by 15 minutes or more, even when the moon is not being eclipsed by Earth's shadow.\nLinks to recent postings about things happening in the sky (posts were written by me unless otherwise noted):\nSupermoon lunar eclipse rises over Portland, elsewhere (photos): Mike Zacchino, photo editor of the Oregonian and OregonLive.com\nPhotos of the supermoon and eclipse from Sept. 27, 2015, from around the world\nEclipse of supermoon early this evening in Portland rare event, indeed (Sept. 27, 2015)\nHow to photograph a full moon; tips from The Oregonian's photo editors\nEclipse, supermoon coming!
