Argentina plays Australia, which beat Scotland, 35-34, while New Zealand plays South Africa. It will be the outsider, but is a live contender. “We have played in the Rugby Championship for the last four years,” said the Argentine coach, Daniel Hourcade. “This has prepared us to play at this level of intensity on a weekly basis, so we will be ready.” Argentina’s second appearance in the final four ends any fear that its first — like those of Bulgaria in soccer’s World Cup in 1994 and Kenya’s in cricket in 2003 — might be a glorious one-time event. It demolished Ireland, champion of Europe for the last two seasons, 43-20, at Cardiff’s Millennium Stadium, a ground where Ireland plays well. This is the third time Ireland has been the fall guy for Argentine progress. The Pumas’ first-ever World Cup playoff victory, in 1999, and the triumph to clinch its pool on the way to the semifinal in 2007, were against Ireland. Argentina led from the start in a gripping, fluctuating contest. It swept into a 17-point lead inside the first 13 minutes, then saw Ireland claw its way back to the point where its fly-half, Ian Madigan, could have tied the score at 23-23 with a 59th minute penalty. Madigan’s shot slid outside the post, and Ireland never got as close again. “Getting back to 23-23 would have been a massive confidence boost for a team which was probably lacking a bit of experience,” said the Ireland coach, Joe Schmidt, who was missing four first-choice players and lost a fifth, wing Tommy Bowe, to an early injury. Instead Argentina pulled away with late tries by full-back Joaquín Tuculet and brilliant wing Juan Imhoff, while fly-half Nicolás Sánchez — named Man of the Match — took his points tally with the boot to 23. “It has been amazing. I don’t know how to explain it,” said Argentina’s ecstatic captain Agustín Creevey. “We have been looking for this for a long time. I can’t come to terms with it. We’re in the semifinal!” This was no fluke. The way it was won offered one answer to the question which was bandied on Saturday night after France fell to an all-time record defeat against New Zealand: “Whatever happened to French flair?” It seems possible that it moved south, crossed the Atlantic and learnt to speak Spanish. Argentina’s devastating opening, with slick inter-passing involving both backs and forwards, players seeking space rather than contact and the whole width of the pitch being used, had echoes of former French teams at their best. A brilliant first try after less than three minutes epitomized those virtues. Tuculet leapt to reclaim a high kick deep in Irish territory and back rower Pablo Matera drove forward. When Argentina moved the ball fast to the right, back rower Juan Martín Fernández Lobbe nonchalantly picked a poor pass off his toes and unloaded a long pass which put wing Santiago Cordero into space. He drew the final defender to send center Matías Moroni over in the corner. \nAdvertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T21:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T23:11:25.894+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
