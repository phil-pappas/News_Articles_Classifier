STM improved to 5-1. \nIt was the first district game for each team. \nSTM rushed for 204 yards and passed for another 170. In the first half most of the Cougars’ scoring drivers were short and quick. None of the Cougars’ seven touchdowns consumed more than five plays and 55 yards. \nBeau Chene meanwhile had its difficulty moving the ball. \nThe Gators didn’t attempt a pass. \nBCHS attempted 35 rushes for a net 39 yards. Savion Broussard led the Beau Chene runners with eight carries and 28 yards. \nRunning back Jylan Henry gained 19 off 11 carries. \nBeau Chene didn’t help sustain any offensive consistency after losing all five fumbles. \nThe STM rushing trio of Evan Trahan, Evan Dominque and Gabe Lebouef accounted for most of the Cougars’ ground yards. \nTrahan had 84, Trahan gained 54 and Lebouef ran eight times for 49. \nSTM quarterback Will Bellamy threw eight times and completed six for 90. \nBellamy threw a pair of first half touchdown passes. One of those was a 24-yarder to wide receiver Trevort Begue, while another came late in the second quarter on a 20-yard completion to Griffin Hebert. \nBegue also scored on a second quarter run of five yards, ending a quick two-play, 15-yard drive. \nThe Gators provided the Cougars with another touchdown after Aaron Monrose scooped a fumble and returned it for a 14-yard score. \nNEXT WEEK: Beau Chene hosts Teurlings Catholic.
