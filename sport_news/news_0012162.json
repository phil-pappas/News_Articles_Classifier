The leagues and the NCAA said that violated the federal ban.\nNew Jersey lost the case, but it tried again last year with new legislation that attempts an end-run around the ban - which prohibits states from authorizing, sponsoring, operating or licensing the practice - by essentially removing state control and deregulating sports wagering at casinos and race tracks.\nBut the state came up short before the Third Circuit's three-judge panel in August. The New Jersey Thoroughbred Horsemen's Association, among others pushing to legalize sports wagering in the Garden State, in September asked the full court to review the panel's decision, saying its reasoning was the \"exact opposite\" of its previous decision in the case.
