Both games are at 7:30 p.m. \nThe Brandon Wheat Kings hope a pair of games on the weekend will help them to re-establish the home dominance they enjoyed last season. \nThe Kootenay Ice visit Westman Place tonight and the Edmonton Oil Kings come to the Wheat City on Saturday. \nBrandon forward Tyler Coulter said it’s imperative for the Wheat Kings to play well against their two Central Division foes as they strive to match the league-high 27 wins they posted in 36 home games last season. \n\"We really need to win every game that we can at home and come to play every single night,\" Coulter said. \"When we get our game headed in the right direction at home, I think we’ll do some good things.\" \nAfter three games at Westman Place this season, the Wheat Kings are 1-1-0-1, although they outshot the Swift Current Broncos 54-19 in their home opener only to lose in a shootout. \nWheat Kings head coach and general manager Kelly McCrimmon, back from two days of Western Hockey League meetings that caused him to miss Tuesday’s game 8-3 win over the Vancouver Giants, said that his expectations are rising. \n\"We want to be a good team in our building, and this is a weekend with two teams on trips coming through,\" McCrimmon said. \"We want to play well. Part of it for every team right now, as you start to play more games, is you want to see your team game continue to improve. You’re going to have higher expectations of your group as you go along.\" \nBoth Edmonton and Kootenay are on four-game swings through the East Division. \nKootenay, now in its third game on the road, lost 5-3 to the Prince Albert Raiders on Tuesday and suffered a 7-2 drubbing at the hands of the Saskatoon Blades on Wednesday. \nThe Ice have also lost 16-year-old defenceman Cale Fleury and overage winger Jaedon Descheneau, a three-time 30-goal scorer, to injury during the trip. Overage defenceman Tyler King is out indefinitely with a bad knee. \nThe Oil Kings, who lost to Brandon in the first round of last season’s playoffs, begin their trip by visiting the Moose Jaw Warriors tonight. \n\"Edmonton will be the third playoff opponent from last season that we’ve played,\" McCrimmon said, noting they’ve played Calgary and Regina already. \"Those games have a little different feel based on having played them in the playoffs, but first and foremost, we have to be ready for Kootenay.\" \nWith three home games left before the Wheat Kings make their annual West Coast trip, Coulter will also be looking to get on track offensively. After posting 16 goals and 17 assists last season, he hasn’t hit the scoresheet through five games this season. \n\"I think I’m playing in the right direction,\" Coulter said. \"The numbers might not be there but I feel like it will come. All that matters to me is that I skate well and keep playing hard every night.\" \nDEADLINES NEAR: The deadline for the Wheat Kings to make a decision on their import situation is today. With D Ivan Provorov a lock to stay, that means that either Latvian F Rihards Bukarts will have to be traded or Austrian F Dario Winkler will have to be put on waivers. Since Winkler is an import in his first year in the league, he can’t be traded … A second deadline looms next Thursday for the team’s five overagers, who have to be trimmed to three. That group includes D Colton Waltz, D Macoy Erkamps, injured F Tim McGauley, F Quintin Lisoway and Bukarts. \n» pbergson@brandonsun.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T11:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T16:44:06.421+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
