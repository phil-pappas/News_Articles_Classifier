Lafayette went up 45-42 with 2:06 left in the game on a 36-yard field goal by Lance Perrin. Sulphur (5-3, 3-1) looked like they would start their final drive with great field position after Glenn Willis brought the ball back to the 31-yard line but a penalty forced the Tors to start at their own 11-yard line. The Tors got a big third down conversion on a 14-yard pass from Byron Walker and J’Cobi Skinner. The drive looked stalled as Walker’s pass fell incomplete on fourth down from the Lions 45-yard line but a roughing the passer penalty moved the ball to the 30. On second and 10 from the 19, Garrett Brame managed to keep his feet inbound on a pass from Walker to put the Tors at the eight yard line. On the next play, Walker found sophomore tight end Christian Trahan in the back right corner of the end zone for the game winner with nine seconds to spare and completing an 89-yard drive. The game was a back-and-forth battle to the end with four lead changes and four ties. The two teams combined for 1,019 yards and 94 points. Sulphur junior tailback J’Cobi Skinner had a career night for the second week in a row. After rushing for 269 yards and five touchdowns last week he went for 306 and five scores this week on 36 carries. The last time a Tor running back broke 300 yards in a game was Week 2 last year when Derrick Guillory set a school single-game rushing record with 340 yards on 42 carries with three scores. Skinner now has 1,271 yards and 19 touchdowns. Despite throwing two picks in the red zone in the first half, Tor junior quarterback Byron Walker completed 14-of-27 passes for 150 yards to go over 1,000 yards for the second consecutive year. He also had 108 yards and a touchdown on the ground. Trey Davis led the Lions’ (2-6, 0-4) ground game with 155 yards and two touchdowns on 16 carries. Quarterback Dwight Youngblood added 138 yards and a score on just five touches. Sulphur will take their two-game win streak on the road on Friday when they face archrival Barbe at 7 p.m. The series dates back to 1972 with the Bucs leading 27-17 having won the seven. The Tors last win over the Bucs was in 2007 which was also the last year the Tors won a district championship.
