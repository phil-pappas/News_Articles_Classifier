Turner — last year's ACC freshman of the year — made a school-record 65.2 percent of her shots while averaging 13.8 points. \nHer selection comes a year after Jewell Loyd won both the preseason and end-of-the-year player of the year awards while leading the Irish to a 36-3 record, their second straight ACC Tournament title and another Final Four berth. \nMcGraw said Turner has \"come back a different player in terms of maturity. ... She's a little bit more vocal, a little bit smarter.\" \nFlorida State was picked to finish where it ended the best season in school history last year — in second place, its best predicted finish since preseason voting started in 1991. \nBehind Kansas State transfer Leticia Romero and junior college transfer Adut Bulgak, the Seminoles set a school-record with 32 wins, reached their first ACC championship game and advanced to the regional semifinals before falling to South Carolina. \n\"This year's team is obviously a more experienced team,\" coach Sue Semrau said. \"Last year's team ... it was an influx of talent that came in. ... This was a group that was extremely hungry as they were older. You had Adut coming in off a (junior college) national championship with two years (to play), she didn't have time to mess around. It was, I think, a special team for that. And now knowing that it's Adut's last opportunity, I think the passion and the fire in her is different.\" \nLouisville was picked third for the second straight year, returning key contributors Mariya Moore and Myisha Hines-Allen from the Cardinals' fifth straight 20-win team. \n\"We're very flattered by being picked third in the league, (but) at the same time we're quite aware of we've got a lot of work to do,\" coach Jeff Walz said. \"I feel good offensively, but really concerned right now with getting our freshmen further along defensively, because all five are going to play. ... Honored to be picked third, but cautious that we understand that we have a lot of work to do before we start playing Nov. 15.\" \nFollow Joedy McCreary on Twitter at http://twitter.com/joedyap \nAll content copyright ©2015 Daily Reporter, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T18:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T19:00:07.007+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
