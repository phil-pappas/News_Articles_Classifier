I’ve had a great time, but feel it’s time to focus on my family and other career interests.\n“After several months of thought and discussion with my family and my team, we realise our future includes many things in MMA, but active competition in the sport is no longer one of them.\n“This isn’t goodbye, as I will still be very much involved in the sport but just not as a fighter.\n“I want to help further MMA around the world and give my contribution to the sport. I know that I have, and will continue to contribute much to the growth of our sport outside of the octagon.”\nPalelei, 37, went down in two of his last fights in the UFC.\nThe 120kg and 193cm giant suffered a second-round knockout loss to Antonio “Big Foot” Silva at UFC 190 in August.\nIronically, Palelei trained at AKA Thailand with Sydney knockout artist Mark Hunt, who fought an epic five-round draw with Silva in Brisbane in December 2013, in preparation for the bout.\nPalelei and Hunt are again training out of the same Phuket gym as the “Super Samoan” prepares for the rematch with Silva at UFC 193 in Melbourne on November 15.\n ‘The Hulk’ retires from UFC", "external_links": ["http://www.perthnow.com.au/sport/boxing-mma/soa-the-hulk-palelei-announces-retirement-from-ufc/news-story/c1f29092fc3b161c18c6f9e59074de35", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/origin:fatwire.", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/f39ea2abd2dd4c93ce5884c8474f10a5", "http://widgets.outbrain.com/outbrain.js"], "published": "2015-10-20T21:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T13:46:24.141+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
