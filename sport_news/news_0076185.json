(AP) â€” Devan Dubnyk stopped 15 shots for his first shutout this season to lead the Minnesota Wild to a 3-0 victory over the reeling Anaheim Ducks on Saturday night. \nMatt Dumba, Thomas Vanek and Ryan Carter scored to send Anaheim to its sixth loss in the first seven games. \nThe Ducks, last season's runner-up in the Western Conference finals, have scored just six goals this season while getting shut out four times. \nMinnesota outshot Anaheim 15-3 in the first period and 26-9 after two. The Ducks were hanging around despite getting outplayed before they took four penalties in the first 11 minutes of the second period. \nAs Patrick Maroon skated out of the penalty box with 6:59 left in the second, Vanek ripped a shot past Frederik Andersen to give Minnesota a 2-0 lead. \nWith 1:35 left in the second, Carter took a pass from Justin Fontaine on a short-handed 2-on-1 rush to cap the scoring. Ducks' Frederik Andersen stops Matt Dumba with stunning stick save \nDumba sent a shot over Andersen's right glove to give the Wild a 1-0 lead with 3:28 left in the first. \nIt was the first time the Wild beat the Ducks at home since Feb. 18, 2011. The Ducks had won 10 of their last 11 against Minnesota before this lackluster performance. \nDubnyk spent long stretches between action on his end of the ice stretching to stay loose. The shutout was the 15th of his career and first since Feb. 20 of last season at Edmonton. \nJared Spurgeon added two assists and team captain Mikko Koivu added an assist to extend his points streak to five games. 1 CONNECT 1 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
