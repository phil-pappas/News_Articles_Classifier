Foley missed the conversion again, and when Laidlaw called for the tee following a penalty to make it 16-10, Scotland looked set to take that lead into half-time. \nHowever in the final minute of the half Australia were awarded a penalty and opted to kick for the corner rather than take the three points. The decision was rewarded when Michael Hooper held onto the ball at the back of a driving maul before his forwards carried him over the line. \nFoley missed the kick, handing Scotland a one-point lead at the break. \nAustralia overtook Scotland immediately in the second half. A sweeping move down the left looked dangerous and when Sean Maitland was spotted interfering with a pass with a deliberate knock on, he was given 10 minutes in the bin by Craig Joubert. \nAustralia opted for the line-out and the gap left by Maitland was immediately exploited when a pass was fired to Mitchell on the left wing to score untouched. Australia were then penalised at the scrum which gave Laidlaw a chance to bring his side back into it at 22-19. \nThe Wallabies looked to have extended their lead when Ashley-Cooper crossed in the right corner, but a review showed a knock-on from Will Genia in the build-up to it. However a Foley penalty reinstated their six-point lead. \nScotland brought the game to within one point when Finn Russell charged down a kick from Foley and tore towards the Wallabies line. He was brought down short, but popped the ball to Tommy Seymour from the ground to crash over for the try with 20 minutes remaining. \nThe conversion from Laidlaw would have handed the Scots the lead, but he sent it left of the posts. Australia hit back moments later, when they stole a Scotland line-out near their line and Kuridrani wriggled between two defenders from close range. \nThe conversion was good, but when Scotland were knocking on the Australian line the Wallabies conceded a penalty. Laidlaw took the chance to bring his side within a single score. Bennett then intercepted the pass from Slipper to send Twickenham into delirium and set up a tense final five minutes. \nScotland had a line-out in their own half which was overthrown and not collected cleanly. When the ball spilled forward from Josh Strauss and replacement prop Welsh handled it, referee Joubert awarded Australia a penalty. \nFoley put aside his nerves to calmly slot the kick and the Wallabies survived the final 30 seconds to progress to the semi-finals of the tournament and break Scottish hearts.
