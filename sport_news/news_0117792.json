Nichushkin, who played just eight games last season because of hip surgery, has been struggling.\n\"I've been trying to help him by shifting him around,\" Ruff said. \"He had some struggles early in camp on right wing, so I put him on left, and he doesn't seem real comfortable at left right now. His game, everything has got to get a little bit quicker.\"\nRuff said he could reduce his minutes or even scratch Nichushkin.\n\"There's two ways to get through it -- you either sit on the outside and take a look, and sometimes that helps you, or sometimes players can play through it.\"\nTwitter: @MikeHeika\nOn Twitter:\n @MikeHeika", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/MikeHeika", "https://twitter.com/MikeHeika"], "published": "2015-10-13T06:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T11:04:55.020+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
