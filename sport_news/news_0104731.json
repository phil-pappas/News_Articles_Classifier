The most recent suspension came during the 2012-13 Stanley Cup playoffs, when he was banned for the rest of the Sharks' second-round series against the Los Angeles Kings for an illegal check to the head of Jarret Stoll. \nSilfverberg did not return to the game Saturday, but coach Bruce Boudreau said he was held out as a precaution.
