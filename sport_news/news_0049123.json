Portland police took the three into custody after they finished lunch Wednesday at St. Francis of Assisi Church Catholic in Southeast Portland.\nSan Francisco police said in a statement that investigators saw similarities in the two shootings, including the locations in wooded areas. So city police traveled to Portland to investigate further after the suspects were arrested.\nSan Francisco police Sgt. Michael Andraychak said the suspects had property of Carey when they were taken into custody.\n\"The three suspects will be charged with the robbery and murder of Audrey Carey,\" he said.\nOfficials have also said the gun believed to be the one used to kill Carter in Marin County was recovered during the arrests.\nMarin County sheriff's Lt. Doug Pittman declined to discuss the type of gun recovered and any further details, including a possible motive for the killing of Carter near Fairfax, California.\n\"It's still very early in our investigation,\" he said.\nAuthorities have described the suspects as drifters and said none of them has a known address.\nA hiker found Carter's body in the evening, and he was still holding the leash of his wounded dog. The Doberman pinscher was turned over to the Marin County Humane Society and is expected to recover.\nPittman said investigators were also aided by surveillance footage from a gas station in Point Reyes that showed the suspects with the stolen car about a half-hour after the slaying.\nAuthorities have said it did not appear the suspects knew Carter. Pittman has said it was unclear if Carter might have been targeted for his car or other belongings.\nFollowers credited Carter with improving their romantic relationships by teaching tantra, a philosophy of meditation, yoga and sexuality famously embraced by rock star Sting.\n-- The Associated Press", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T21:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T02:03:57.662+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
