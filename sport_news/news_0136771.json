Youth is a dramatic, consequential time. When the young get older and leave their culture behind, they remember it grandly, recreate their lost youth and pitch it out into the world.\nSo, world, welcome back to the '90s.\nReports Tuesday are that The Fresh Prince and Jazzy Jeff will be touring this summer , which hopefully means they’ll wind up with Shaq on ABC’s '90s throwback comedy “ Fresh off the Boat .” The “ X-Files ” is back, as is John Stamos . A “ Jurassic ” movie made an obscene amount of money. Nickelodeon is dusting off “Clarissa” and the rest. Even our beloved Columbia Sportswear is calling it a comeback .\nAll this should be good news for Seattle. We were like the Portland of the '90s.\nCheck out the gallery above for some of the most nostalgia-worthy people and happenings from Seattle’s hippest years.\nIf you’ve got additions, tweet @levipulk and tell me what I’m missing. You can follow me, too, though it's mostly crime news.\nSeattlepi.com reporter Levi Pulkkinen can be reached at 206-448-8348 or levipulkkinen@seattlepi.com .
