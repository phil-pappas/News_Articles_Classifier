Alabama opened as a 14 Â½-point favorite to beat Tennessee, according to VegasInsiders.com . \nThe No. 8 Tide (6-1, 3-1 SEC) has not lost to the Vols since 2006, Mike Shula's last year as head coach. Alabama's dominated as the 12-10 win in 2009 was the only one-score victory margin of the streak. The Tide won 34-20 last October in Knoxville. \nTennessee (3-3) was the preseason sleeper pick in the SEC East, grabbing a No. 25 ranking in August. Losses in three of four games from Sept. 12-Oct. 3 saw the Vols blow leads against Oklahoma, Florida and Arkansas. \nBefore taking a bye on Saturday, Tennessee came from behind to beat Georgia 38-31 on Oct. 10. \nAlabama has won four straight since falling to Ole Miss last month. That run includes two road wins (Georgia, Texas A&M) at teams ranked in the top-10 at the time.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T00:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T00:29:51.315+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
