The only mistake he made was allowing a two-run homer to Luis Valbuena in the second inning after an infield single by Evan Gattis for a 2-0 Astros lead. \nAfter that blast, it was 19 up and 19 set down by the Dominican. \n\"He was fantastic,\" said manager Ned Yost. \"Johnny was rolling.\" \nThe rest of the Royals were thrilled. \n\"That's the reason why we got him, for games like this,\" said first baseman Eric Hosmer. \nBen Zobrist, another mid-season acquisition by Kansas City, said Cueto was beguiling on the mound. \n\"He was phenomenal. Both sides of the plate, all of his pitches. Just didn’t give them anything to hit,\" he said. \n\"That’s the Cueto that everyone knew he could be for us and he was that tonight.\" \nLast year the Royals got back to the playoffs for the first time in 29 years as a Wild Card team and went all the way to a World Series Game Seven before falling to the San Francisco Giants. \nThird baseman Mike Moustakas said they had one more series left to win. \n\"This is what we worked for all year,\" he said. \"We got back here and now we’ve got more business to take care of. But we’ll enjoy this tonight.\" \n(Reporting by Larry Fine in New York; Editing by Peter Rutherford)  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T08:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T09:18:11.608+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
