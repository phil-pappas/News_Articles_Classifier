But Kristaps Porzingis was still on the practice court, hanging around like a kid brought to work by his dad as Sasha Vujacic worked with him through a series of odd drills.\nFirst, Porzingis tried to emulate Vujacic as the veteran guard deftly flicked the ball behind his back and off a wall, catching it with the other hand and continuing the behind-the-back trickery. Then Vujacic took him to the free-throw line for a competition — shooting with his eyes closed to even the odds.\nBut the real test is about to come for Porzingis, as Knicks coach Derek Fisher said that if nothing goes wrong in tonight’s preseason game in Boston, Porzingis will be in the starting lineup on opening night next Wednesday.\nAnd perhaps it’s a fitting start that he will find himself matched up against the Milwaukee Bucks and Greg Monroe — the player who was the first recruit on Knicks president Phil Jackson’s free-agent wish list.\n\"I’ve been working hard,\" Porzingis said. \"[Tonight’s] the game, so we’ll see how I feel. I want to get my rhythm, get my shots, don’t force too much or be anxious. I feel pretty ready. I’ve been working a lot with my coaches and my teammates.\n\"I want to play good every game. This will be the last game to prepare myself for the season. We don’t have any more time left. I think we’re better as a team now. [Tonight] will be the last challenge for us before the regular season. For me, it’s important. I’m going to play as hard as I can, try to get my conditioning better. After the game, we have the whole week looking to the season.\"\nFor the Knicks, much of their hopes will hinge on the play of the 7-foot-3 rookie from Latvia. The free-agent chase brought in a quartet of role players, but none with anything near the potential the 20-year-old possesses.\nWhat he will contribute remains to be seen. Fisher liked the lessons that Vujacic was imparting, although he isn’t expecting the behind-the-back drill to come into play.\n\"Sasha’s a guy who has been successful in this league,\" Fisher said. \"So I think there are a lot of things that he can offer Kris. But I don’t know about 7-3 guys throwing behind-the-back passes off the wall, but we’ll see.\"\nThe bigger test will be just surviving the season. Three times since his pre-draft workouts, Porzingis has suffered a left leg injury. While he has played professionally in Spain, which means two-a-day practices most days, he has never had to endure the rigors of an 82-game schedule with the back-to-back games.\n\"I haven’t heard anybody who said it’s easy, 82 games,\" Porzingis said. \"Everybody is like, ‘You’d better take care of your body because it’s a long season, a long 82 games, all the traveling and everything.’ So that takes a lot of energy. The most important thing is get my recovery, get my sleep, and hopefully I’ll be fine.\"\nEmail: popper@northjersey.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T04:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T09:00:53.585+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
