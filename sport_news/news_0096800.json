The Frenchman must also, like all prospective candidates, pass a FIFA integrity check before his nomination as a candidate is formally accepted. \nPlatini, until recently the favorite in the election, has been in the spotlight since Swiss police placed Blatter under criminal investigation and accused him of making a \"disloyal payment\" of two million Swiss francs (Â£1.3 million) to the Frenchman in 2011. \nThe payment was allegedly for work deemed to have been performed between January 1999 and June 2002. \nPlatini says the nine year gap between his work ending and the payment was because of FIFA saying in 2002 that they were unable to pay him due to their financial situation. \n(Reporting By Simon Evans; editing by Ralph Boulton ) Trending On Reuters", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T21:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T23:00:00.468+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
