By WILL GRAVESAP Sports Writer \nPITTSBURGH (AP) - Justin Tucker made a 52-yard field goal with 5:08 left in overtime to give the Baltimore Ravens a 23-20 victory over the Pittsburgh Steelers on Thursday night. \nTucker tied it with 3 seconds to go in regulation after Pittsburgh's Josh Scobee missed a pair of kicks that would have given the Steelers some cushion. Tucker then won it in the extra period after the Steelers failed to convert a pair of fourth downs in Baltimore territory. \nJustin Forsett ran for 150 yards for the Ravens (1-3). Joe Flacco threw a touchdown pass and did just enough late to help the Ravens end the worst start in franchise history. \nMichael Vick threw for 124 yards and a score while starting in place of injured Ben Roethlisberger, but the Steelers (2-2) bumbled late and Baltimore took advantage. \n___ \nAP NFL website: www.pro32.ap.org and www.twitter.com/AP_NFL Copyright 2015 The Associated Press.
