He's going to go through treatment … and we'll see where he's at.\"\nAfter the game, Headley said he would be ready to play today. Girardi said Ellsbury would have been available Thursday if needed.\nTanaka on track \nMasahiro Tanaka struggled Wednesday, pitching after a 12-day layoff because of a hamstring injury. But Girardi said Tanaka came out of the start without any additional physical concerns — putting him on track for a start in Tuesday's wild-card game.\n\"He said his leg felt good,\" Girardi said. \"I felt he was a little bit rusty [Wednesday], but he'll be able to throw a normal bullpen here in a few days, and he felt good.\"\nComeback Alex? \nAlex Rodriguez, who missed all of last season because of a suspension for performance-enhancing drugs, has apparently impressed his peers with his surprising season.\nOn Thursday, the Major League Baseball Players Association — which A-Rod sued in 2013 in an effort to get his suspension overturned — chose Rodriguez as one of three finalists for the Players' Choice American League Comeback Player of the Year.\nThe other two finalists are Texas' Prince Fielder and Kansas City's Kendrys Morales.\n— Andy Vasquez", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T04:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T10:33:10.750+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
