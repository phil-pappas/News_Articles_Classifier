A big message at the diversity conference is that differences matter.\nKeynote speaker Dr. Brenda Allen says, \" It asks us to be much more thoughtful and heartfelt in terms of members of under-represented groups.\"\nDr. Allen with the University of Colorado, Denver as its chief diversity officers, says it’s not all about race, “Most definition s to diversity includes gender, more and more sexual orientation, socio- economic status, religion, nationality, ability.\"\nLynette Olson, PSU provost and vice president of academic affairs says, \"We all bring to whatever situation we're in be it the classroom or otherwise, our own unique experience, honor that call it out.\"\nThe message about understanding differences goes clear into the classroom and even affecting curriculum\nOlson says, \"Maybe I’m using language or illustrations that aren't appropriate anymore.\"\nAllen asks, \"Who's voices are you presenting and representing?\nAre you trying to be aware of their different learning styles for example?\"\nOr learning disabilities. Participants at the conference learned about factors of inclusion. Dr. Allen says we all have unconscious biases we cannot escape. And says people need to recognize what she calls TUI- Thinking under the influence of those biases.\nDr.Allen says, \"To know that doesn’t make me a bad person, it makes me a product of this environment. And a product that we in education can shift and transform and disrupt. Equip people differently so they’re able to interact with a lot of different people in a lot of different contexts.\"\nPSU provost Olson says the conference brings understanding that helps in recruitment as well as day to day instruction.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T02:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T11:34:23.344+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
