The twists and turns of his hockey journey have now brought him to Anaheim, where he signed a one-year contract with the Ducks in August.\nJust once has Santorelli spent more than two seasons with one team. A player who is effective enough for teams to want him but not a core player for them to keep. And the versatile forward has accepted his lot in hockey life.\n“That’s just the way it’s (gone),” Santorelli said Wednesday. “You got to be grateful to play in the NHL and you got to take whatever role you can. There’s so many people that dream of playing in the NHL and don’t get that chance to.\n“I’m fortunate to get that chance. Whatever that role is, that’s what I’m going to do.”\nNothing is guaranteed in today’s NHL. Curtis Glencross, an undrafted forward who started with the Ducks and twice scored 20-plus goals with Calgary, learned that when he got released from tryouts with two clubs and announced his retirement at 32.\nSeeing a free-agent market in which depth forwards aren’t as prized, Santorelli, 29, took a healthy pay cut from $1.5 million with Toronto and Nashville last season to nab a deal with the Ducks for $875,000. His first few games have been effective for his latest team.\nSantorelli assisted on Sami Vatanen ’s goal in the home opener and he scored his first, a rebound for an insurance score, in Sunday’s win over Minnesota. He’s also tied with Hampus Lindholm for the team lead in scoring, a function of how much the Ducks have struggled offensively.\n“He’s a smart little player,” Ducks coach Bruce Boudreau said. “If you give him time and space, he can make plays. He’s got good hockey sense. I’ve liked what I’ve seen.\n“The one game that he didn’t play, we were looking to go with a bigger lineup. But right now, he’s earned a spot.”\nBoudreau can identify with Santorelli in a way, being a nomadic player who never had a secure place in the NHL. He said players such as Santorelli are “never comfortable” and have to earn a job in training camp each September.\nSantorelli takes the attitude of doing whatever role he’s given – center, wing, offensive, defensive. His goal is to be reliable, a player his coach will trust to have on the ice.\n“It’d be nice to finally settle in somewhere,” Santorelli said. “But at the same time, that’s out of my control. The only thing I can control is going out there every night and working hard, playing hard. The rest will take care of itself.”\nTHOMPSON ON MEND \nCenter Nate Thompson joined his teammates on the trip but is still in rehabilitation mode as he continues his recovery from major shoulder surgery in June.\nIt has been a rehab process that hasn’t had any significant setbacks, which is leaving Thompson optimistic about the future. The original timeline for his availability was early-to-mid December but Thompson has been steadily increasing the level and tempo of his workouts.\n“Really what we’re doing is going day by day,” Thompson said. “It’s all how I feel. How my shoulder is feeling. When it feels great, then that’s when I start ramping it up a little bit more. When it gets a little sore, I take it back a little bit.\n“It’s all positive. It’s a process. It’s not the most fun process. But it’s all part of it and hopefully I’ll be back pretty soon.”\nThere is another important reason why Thompson is on the trip. It is an opportunity to see his 5-month-old son, Teague, when the Ducks get to Minnesota over the weekend.\n“That’s definitely a plus to go on the trip,” Thompson said. “But at the same time, it’s always good to come on the road and skate. I’m not practicing with the guys just yet, but it’s always a good sign to be out with the guys.\n“Being by yourself and working out and skating by yourself and not getting to hang out with anybody, it’s nice to be around some people.”\nSTONER CLOSE TO RETURN \nDefenseman Clayton Stoner (lower body) is eligible to come off injured reserve and play Thursday. Now it’s up to whether the trainers will let him get right back in the lineup.\nStoner missed three games but has practiced at full speed the past two days. If he does draw back into his regular spot alongside Sami Vatanen on the third pairing, Korbinian Holzer likely would come out.\n“He looks like he’s practicing normal,” Boudreau said. “He does what he normally does. I haven’t seen any deviance from that.”\nContact the writer: estephens@ocregister.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T10:13:03.585+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
