Shaker, Shenendehowa battle to scoreless tie in girls' soccer 1 / 6 Back to Gallery Latham\nWhat looks great then sounds awful to the Shenendehowa girls' soccer team isn't a riddle. But it was a late setup that just missed Thursday, leaving a scoreless tie at Shaker.\nIn a game full of whiplash-inducing change of field, and plenty of quality shots on net for both teams through 100 minutes of play, it was arguably the Suburban Council 's best player — Shen's Meghan Cavanaugh — who couldn't quite post a score.\nHer header with seven minutes left in regulation clanked firmly off the cross bar as five other players, and a helpless goalie five yards away, looked on. It was the defining moment of an entertaining stalemate that will set up a wild final week to the regular season among three unbeatens.\nTraditional league favorite Shen (11-0-1 in league games) will still have to play against Saratoga and fellow unbeaten Niskayuna, which improved to 11-0-1 with a 9-4 win against Saratoga on Thursday.\nShaker (10-0-2) has already won about twice as many games as last year but is still in the hunt with Saratoga and Niskayuna on tap for next week.\n\"I like the thrills,\" Shen goalie Jill Shippee said after a 10-save performance (same as her counterpart, Madison LaMarche).\nTeams are having to make do with an expanded Suburban school lineup that this season limits teams to just one meeting.\nThey have to make it count heading into the postseason. There are mixed reviews about the new format. Not even Shippee and Cavanaugh could agree.\nThis one, while not offering a winner, was about as good as it could get otherwise through 80 regulation minutes and the 20 tacked on.\n\"It really opened up, the game just got really big,\" Shaker coach Dan Lindemann said. \"A lot of counter-attacks, a lot of chances on both sides.\"\nBoth teams found adjustments in the second half that they prospered from on offense.\nThe only other \"meeting\" came in August at Shen's traditional preseason \"Scramble,\" a 50-minute affair that ended in a 1-all score.\nThis one was that much tougher, because of what was at stake — and the expert play of the goalies. Shippee and LaMarche were proactive in warding off threats, unafraid to come out of their areas, and up to the challenge when clean strikes came.\nShippee had to leap to her max to knock a shot over the crossbar right before the end of the first half. She also showed off her vertical jump to snare a few well-placed corner-kick plays.\n\"The girls are in good spirits,\" Lindemann said. \"They almost felt like they lost the game, so we kind of look at that as a positive thing moving forward. We're moving in the right direction, I think.\"\nThe final 20 minutes of regulation came at a breakneck pace.\nCavanaugh set up a header for a teammate. Shaker countered with a couple of on-line kicks that were snuffed out.\nAudrey Meany nearly ended the three-way Suburban tie with her dribble along the right sideline, and an entry pass that found Cavanaugh square on the top of the head.\n\"I did think I scored,\" said a smiling Cavanaugh, who also rattled off a couple of close calls in the second overtime. \"But I couldn't see anything. Then I heard the doink. I was like, 'Ugh...' \"\nShen coach Holli Mulholland isn't a fan of ties, but appreciated the way both teams went after this one. Hers found better passing and aggressiveness after a slow start.\nShe thought Shaker was just trying to survive into the end of regulation.\n\"But then they came into overtime and really turned it back on,\" Mulholland said.\nBoth teams were happy to be playing each other at this point in the season.\n\"This is where you want to be,\" Lindemann said. \"Getting your game to that next level.\"\nJason Franchuk is a freelance writer.", "external_links": ["http://timesunion.mycapture.com/mycapture/remoteimage.asp?backtext=Back%20to%20Times%20Union&image=http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/33/00/8761360/5/628x471.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/33/00/8761364/5/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/33/00/8761363/5/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/33/00/8761360/5/920x920.jpg", "http://timesunion.mycapture.com/mycapture/remoteimage.asp?backtext=Back%20to%20Times%20Union&image=http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/33/00/8761363/5/628x471.jpg", "http://timesunion.mycapture.com/mycapture/remoteimage.asp?backtext=Back%20to%20Times%20Union&image=http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/33/00/8761359/5/628x471.jpg", "http://timesunion.mycapture.com/mycapture/remoteimage.asp?backtext=Back%20to%20Times%20Union&image=http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/33/00/8761364/5/628x471.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/33/00/8761360/5/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/33/00/8761362/5/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/33/00/8761362/5/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/33/00/8761359/5/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://timesunion.mycapture.com/mycapture/remoteimage.asp?backtext=Back%20to%20Times%20Union&image=http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/33/00/8761361/5/628x471.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/33/00/8761361/5/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://timesunion.mycapture.com/mycapture/remoteimage.asp?backtext=Back%20to%20Times%20Union&image=http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/33/00/8761362/5/628x471.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/33/00/8761363/5/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/33/00/8761361/5/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/33/00/8761359/5/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/33/00/8761364/5/square_gallery_thumb.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-09T07:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T08:59:09.542+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
