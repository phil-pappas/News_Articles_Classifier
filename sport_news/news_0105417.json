Wayne Valley is playing its best soccer of the season and are back in the semifinals for the first time in three years. \nLITTLE FALLS - Eventually soccer karma turns in your favor. \nIn a season when Wayne Valley surrendered game-winning goals at the death and then were struck down with golden goals in overtime, the soccer gods were kind. \n\"We've had a season of ups and downs and I thought going into overtime that we were due,\" said Wayne Valley boys' coach Sam Roca. \nVincent Minnocci's world-class strike from distance six minutes into the first overtime provided the Indians with a 2-1 come-from-behind victory at top-seeded Passaic Valley last Saturday in the Passaic County Coaches' Association Tournament quarterfinals. \nAfter a three-year absence, the Indians are back in the semifinals. Next up is fifth-seeded Clifton Saturday in Clifton School Stadium at 4 p.m. \n\"I'm happy ... ecstatic ... for everyone ... the players. It was another case of a team effort. We came out flat in the first half and played poorly, but it's how the team collectively bonded in the second half and rebounded from going down a goal to tying it up and then winning in overtime. I cannot be more proud of our team,\" Roca gushed. \nEven at 1 through 80 minutes, ninth-seeded Wayne Valley seized control of the match and won it off a set piece. Minnocci curled a 25-yard effort into the upper-right corner to provide the dramatics and send the Boys in Blue into the semifinals. \n\"No one was going to stop that shot; it was a top-quality finish,\" Roca said. \nThe Hornets (7-4) struck in the opening half when Zach Fitzgerald netted one. \nEight minutes after the interval, the Indians (5-7) tallied off a corner kick. This time Brandon Vecere's flighted ball was spilled by goalkeeper Brandon Pinon allowing Alex Kasperowicz to fire home. \nWayne Valley's back four stayed strong for the remainder of regulation setting up Minnocci's heroics. Though Minnocci hit the game-winner, Roca said junior holding midfielder Nick Pindulic was \"winning tackles, playing with tenacity and provided a needed spark off the bench. It was Nick's best game of the season,\" he said. \nLast Thursday that karma was on Clifton's side. \nFor the second week in-a-row, Clifton beat a Wayne school in overtime. Wayne Valley took an early one-goal lead only to surrender to Clifton, 2-1, in double overtime in Wayne. \nPeter Leva gave the Indians a 1-0 lead only to see Romario DePalmar equalize. After a goalless second period and first 10-minute overtime session, senior defender Matt Miller knocked in the game-winner. \nClifton's goalkeeping duo of senior Alexis Juarez and sophomore Jake Padula made two saves apiece, while Matt Mihalik turned aside six shots for Wayne Valley. \nThe Indians return to the Big North Independence for the reverse fixtures, including Thursday at Lakeland in Wanaque and then they entertain Passaic Valley Tuesday at 7 p.m. They opened the week with a road match at West Milford on Oct. 13. \nHills moves on \nWayne Hills also advanced to the county tournament semifinals last Saturday following a 2-0 victory over third-seeded DePaul Catholic at Alumni Field. \nJake Semieske scored for the Patriots and Garrett Vander May and Harris Rosen each provided assists after the interval to put away the defending county champions. \nDePaul goalkeeper Luke Van Winkle (seven saves) was injured in the second half when he was kicked in the face. The junior netminder went to the hospital and his availability for the balance of the schedule is unknown. \n\"Luke [Van Winkle] was playing great; really maturing as a goalkeeper,\" DePaul coach Steve Beneventine said. \"On the play, offsides wasn't called and then my player was kicked in the face. When a player is injured there's always a whistle, but not this time.
