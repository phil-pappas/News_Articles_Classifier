That was the adjustment we made, and it worked for us.” \nThe Los Fresnos and San Benito defenses were stout and limited the opponent’s offense during the first half. The teams played to a scoreless tie in the first quarter, and it wasn’t until midway through the second quarter that Los Fresnos broke through. \nAndrew Crum covers sports for The Brownsville Herald.
