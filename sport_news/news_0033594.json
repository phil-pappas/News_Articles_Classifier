He tells them all the time to keep working and they'll get their time on the field,\" junior linebacker Beau Bates said. \"You can't expect anything. You have to work your way.\" \nFor Stiglich, that work early in his UMD career came primarily on special teams. Now, though, even as he's carved out more of a starting role, he hasn't forgotten his roots with the Bulldogs. \n\"I think it's a great thing to still lead on those units and show those younger guys that stuff is still important,\" he said. \"Just because I've earned a spot doesn't mean I can relax at any other point in my game.\" \n\"He's a guy that's going to get in there and scrap and put everything he's got into it,\" defensive coordinator John Steger said. \"All you've got to do is watch him cover kicks to know what kind of a football player he is.\" \nAnd it's that type of player Stiglich hopes he's helping to develop for once his time is done at UMD. \n\"It's that work mentality, that Bulldog mentality,\" he said. \"No matter where you are on that depth chart, keep working hard and keep playing.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T05:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T05:37:32.530+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
