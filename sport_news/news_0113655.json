But Lewis is out with an ankle injury.\nCarroll also said left tackle Garry Gilliam would play against the 49ers, meaning the Seahawks will have the same starting line they had through the first five weeks of the season.\nHere are the other injury updates:\nLinebacker Bobby Wagner (pectoral), defensive end Frank Clark (hamstring) and cornerback Tye Smith (hip) are all expected back after missing last week’s game. Fullback Derrick Coleman (concussion) won’t play against the 49ers. Coleman suffered the concussion in a two-car accident in Bellevue last week. The Seahawks will also be without defensive tackle Jordan Hill (quad), cornerback Marcus Burley (hand) and linebacker Nick Moody (ankle) again. Carroll said Burley is expected to return next week. Defensive tackle Demarcus Dobbs is listed on the official injury report as questionable with a shoulder injury. Cornerback Richard Sherman showed up on Tuesday’s injury report as not practicing because of an ankle injury, but Carroll said Sherman would play in San Francisco. Linebacker Brock Coyle had surgery on his knee, Carroll said. The Seahawks placed Coyle on the Injured Reserve list with the designated to return label. That means Coyle can return to practice in six weeks and return to games in eight weeks.
