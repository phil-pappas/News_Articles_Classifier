Stuffed.\nA wide-open receiver in the end zone, with a tripped-up Spartans cornerback looking on helplessly. Overthrown.\nThird-and-two, late in the fourth quarter, against Washington State. Just one yard gained.\nSecond-and-goal by the Cougars, with seven seconds remaining in regulation, trailing by seven. Touchdown pass, just out of reach of the outstretched arms of a Ducks cornerback.\n\"There's one or two plays going back to the Michigan State game,\" Oregon coach Mark Helfrich said Sunday evening , \"and everybody is singing a different tune.\"\nYet for being conceivably only a few plays away from standing 5-1 at the midpoint of the 2015 college football season, the Oregon Ducks appear far out of the Pac-12 Conference championship picture following a 45-38 double-overtime loss to Washington State on Saturday — UO's second straight loss at Autzen Stadium, the first time that's happened since 2002.\nAnd when the topic of the Ducks is brought up around the conference and country, the only tune that can be heard sounds like a dirge.\nAt 3-3 and 1-2 in conference play, Oregon will travel to Washington on Saturday for a 7:30 p.m. kickoff against a rival it has beaten 11 consecutive times yet who possesses the momentum UO has little of after the Huskies (3-2, 1-1) knocked off USC on the road last Thursday.\nOregon's issues should sound familiar by now.\nDespite running back Royce Freeman's heroics on the ground, where he's averaging the sixth-most yards in the country at 143.2, and one of the most talented corps of receivers ever assembled in school history, uncertainty at quarterback has left Oregon's offense increasingly one-dimensional as it awaits Vernon Adams Jr.'s return from a broken finger. UO's 210.0 passing yards per game ranks 83rd nationally, while its passing efficiency is 51st.\nHelfrich noted Adams' injury won't be used as an excuse for UO's uneven production.\n\"At no point ever do we sit here and go, 'We don't have A, B or C,'\" he said. \"That just doesn't happen.\"\nYet asked if Adams has made \"significant\" progress in his recovery, Helfrich punted.\n\"I think that's the magic word is 'significant,'\" he said. \"I don't know the answer to that.\"\nNor has Oregon found the answers defensively. It looked to be closing the gap all Saturday evening against the Cougars, encouraged by its best pass-rush pressure of the season, with seven sacks and 13 tackles for loss. But all that was washed away when Washington State ended the first and second halves with timely scoring drives — the first with 9 seconds remaining, the second with 1 second left in regulation to force overtime. Eight minutes and 19 seconds earlier on the game clock, the Cougars had trailed 31-21.\nOn those drives, Helfrich cited the breakdowns as stemming from \"a couple times execution, a couple times that we could have put them in better situations, a couple times we had communication ... a couple times they made a great throw and catch.\" He added that he took a timeout on WSU's final drive of regulation to keep the option of a final UO drive, though in hindsight the clock could have run out had the timeout not been used.\nIt didn't help that Oregon was without its most-experienced defensive back. Safety Reggie Daniels wasn't available to play, Helfrich said, without expanding as to whether the absence was related to injury or discipline. Charles Nelson, a wide receiver and special teams star, moved to safety and finished with a team-high 12 tackles, but figured into missed tackles that led to at least one touchdown.\n\"He plays so fast that a guy like is going to miss some tackles by virtue of how hard he plays,\" Helfrich said.\nAmid it all progress has been made and confidence maintained, the Ducks have repeated. But to the naked eye the improvements that have moved UO ahead by inches have quickly been countered by a full step backward.\nAll the while, Pac-12 North leaders Stanford and Cal appear, at the moment, far ahead.\n\"It's very easy to sit here and put at what's wrong — and put directly at me, 100 percent — but we have to be in the solution business,\" Helfrich said. \"When we deal with our team or our guys, however it is, is what can we do now. What's next. Because the negativity will take care of itself.\n\"As far as execution and all that, there's a million things we're absolutely not pleased with but now what. Again, our character of our team and how they've worked and all those things, I'm absolutely 100 percent confident they'll come out and prepare great.\"\nHistory suggests Oregon could have seen trouble coming. The last five teams to lose Heisman Trophy winners have finished 8-5 the following season. Oregon thought it had a solution, however, by plugging in graduate transfer quarterback Vernon Adams Jr.\nA star at the FCS level while at Eastern Washington, Adams was intended to be a bridge from the Mariota era to the next long-term signal-caller at Oregon.\nThough his finger, broken in the season-opener, hasn't allowed him to throw with much velocity, its ripple effect has quickly thrown Oregon's grand plans for a return to the College Football Playoff off track. Six weeks into the season, Oregon's bowl streak appears in jeopardy. The Ducks haven't missed a bowl game since 2004 and need three more victories to reach bowl eligibility, but now enter what is considered the toughest stretch of their schedule.\n\"Our quarterback position has been up in the air this year,\" offensive coordinator Scott Frost said Saturday evening, regarding backups Jeff Lockie and Taylor Alie. \"I've got confidence in all those guys, and I'll continue to. I think right now we have a little bit of a young defense and quarterbacks that are learning.\n\"In a couple of these games we lost ... one more play here or there, anywhere, would have made the difference. Veteran teams win those. And sometimes young teams don't.\"\n— Andrew Greif\nagreif@oregonian.com\n@andrewgreif", "external_links": ["http://www.twitter.com/andrewgreif"], "published": "2015-10-12T03:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T06:36:01.200+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
