We call it the Baroque,” Cooper said in a telephone interview.\nBy studiously copying the scores of the Italian masters such as Vivaldi, Bach exposed their structure and contrapuntal rules and complexities to create a kind of musical grammar.\nThe cold math of line plotted against line, note riding against note, voices knitted into voices translated into sounds often held up as the pinnacle of Western music.\nBach also solidified rules of ornamentation that had before been assumed and improvised, codifying the frills and froth associated with the Baroque. The printed scores of both Telemann and Handel lacked any such embellishment.\n“On the page, their music looks so simple,” Cooper said, “like a jazz chart; just a sketch.”\nIf you go\nWHAT: “Bach to Bach!” presented by the New Mexico Philharmonic\nWHEN: 2 p.m. Oct. 18\nWHERE: National Hispanic Cultural Center, 1701 Fourth SW\nHOW MUCH: $24-$68.

Each movement contains a contrasting emotional state: joy, sadness, animation.\nThe Brandenburg reveals Bach crystallizing the concerti grosso form in which the musical material is passed between a small group of soloists and full orchestra.\nHis Concerto for Oboe and Violin was originally written for two harpsichords, Cooper said. Based on the composer’s notes and letters, musicologists believe he penned a second for oboe and harpsichords, so this one was transcribed from the original.\n“It’s a truly wonderful piece that explores the interplay between the two instruments,” he said.\nBach wrote his Orchestral Suites using the French overture form. The majestic opening takes a relatively slow dotted-note rhythm followed by a fast section.\nThe philharmonic’s violinist Ruxandra Simionescu-Marquardt and oboist Melissa Peña are soloists.", "external_links": ["http://main.abqjournal.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/life06_jd_11oct_phil-267x400.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-11T08:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T10:07:12.914+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
