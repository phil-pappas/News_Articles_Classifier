New Charlotte guard Jeremy Lin would try and lead his team over a short-handed Clipper team that was missing Chris Paul. \nFormer NBA player Yi Jianlian gets some love from DeAndre Jordan and Blake Griffin before the game. \nLin would be out in front of the pack in the opening q, and finishes with the lay-in to tie things. \nA finger injury kept Chris Paul on the bench for the exhibition game in Shenzhen. \nBut they would still be Lob City -- DeAndre doing his thing after the pass from inside the paint -- and the Clips are within 3 \nBlake Griffin would also get in on the act -- he finishes with 13 points, nine rebounds and 10 assists. \nNBA legend and Charlotte owner Michael Jordan then greets fans at the intermission. He got a rousing ovation. \nHis team starts pulling away in the second half -- Lin finding a teammate underneath for the hoop \nThe Charlotte guard hits the triple and puts the Hornets up by eight after three quarters. \nIn the final Q, Lin collides with Josh Smith. The man with the crazy hair would suffer a bloody nose, but would return after treatment. He had a team-high 16 points and four assists. \nAnd his Hornets go on to win the first of two NBA China Games against the Clippers, 106-94.
