He absolutely did not know anything about these allegations.\"\nThe ESPN report corroborated parts of self-described escort Katina Powell's book, \"Breaking Cardinal Rules: Basketball and the Escort Queen,\" citing five unnamed former players or recruits who said there were stripper parties in the team's dormitory on campus. One former U of L player told ESPN that he had sex with one of the escorts, and that former U of L staffer Andre McGee paid for it. ESPN's \"Outside the Lines\" also said it independently confirmed Powell's cellphone contacts with McGee.\nTHE COURIER-JOURNAL\nEx-U of L recruit: 'Like I was in a strip club'\nESPN's report aired on \"Good Morning America\" and \"SportsCenter\" on Tuesday morning and ran for a full hour on \"Outside the Lines\" on Tuesday afternoon.\nPitino told The Courier-Journal that he was \"devastated\" and \"disappointed\" by the report.\nJurich offered a statement supporting Pitino on Tuesday afternoon through a spokesman, making the second time in recent weeks that either Pitino or Jurich has commented on the coach's future.\nTHE COURIER-JOURNAL\n'Long process' awaits U of L hoops and NCAA\nPitino was irked by a statement from U of L president James Ramsey two weeks ago that only mentioned supporting Jurich. On a local radio show, Pitino said resigning would be the \"cowardly\" route to take.\n\"I don't know what resigning would accomplish,\" Pitino said. \"I think that's the cowardly way out. ... What does it do for the program if the head coach just runs away?\"\nTHE COURIER-JOURNAL\nWatch the Katina Powell interview\nGet the CJ’s free UofL CardsHQ newsletter\n45 CONNECT 24 TWEET LINKEDIN 1
