GERALD HERBERT — AP Photo \nDrew Brees has agreed to convert part of his base salary into a signing bonus to help create some financial flexibility for the Saints. \nThe move clears up $2.6 million in cap space and elevates Brees 2016 cap hit to $30 million, which is currently the highest in the NFL, according to a source. \nThe quarterbacks base salary was previously $18.75 million. It is now $13.55 million. By converting part of his base salary to a signing bonus, it allows New Orleans to prorate it over this season and next season, which is the final one on Brees contract.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T23:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T00:45:34.175+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
