Modi, who was speaking at a ceremony to lay foundation stone of Andhra Pradesh’s new capital city, Amaravathi, said that people should be wary of anything that fuels tension between the two states. \"For some people's political selfishness, Andhra Pradesh was bifurcated in haste without proper consultation. Even today, I can feel the pain of those innocent people who lost their lives and property in this divide.” “The British left fissures in the country. The country still suffers due to these artificial divide. Likewise, the previous government (Congress led- UPA II) also created a permanent problem,\" Modi said. \"Those people who while bifurcating Andhra and Telangana have attempted to sow the seeds of a permanent problem. They continue to provide fodder to the problem to manipulate emotions of the inhabitants of the two states,” he said, asking people to not fall pray to such motives. The prime minister promised to implement the Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act within a fixed timeframe. He cited example of three states —­ Uttarkhand, Jharkhand and Chattisgarh, all of which were carved out during Atal Bihari Vajpayee's tenure — claiming there was no conflict when they were created. \"The previous government has done a lot of such things that a lot of time and energy of this government is going into undoing and setting them right. But I assure Centre's support to both the states and the Government of India will always stand by and support you,\" he said. The Prime Minister promised he and Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Chandrababu Naidu —a champion for the Amravati project — would help the state reach new heights in development. Modi had brought water from the Yamuna River and soil from Parliament Complex to be spread in the new capital — signifying the national capital’s support to the state. Prime minister claimed the central government has already sanctioned several institutions of higher education to the state, including IIT, IIM, IIIT (Indian Institute of Information Technology), AIIMS, NIT, Indian Institute of Science, education and research, Central and Petroluem University. — PTI", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T14:22:31.630+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
