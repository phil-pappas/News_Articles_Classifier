But Prince Fielder and Mitch Moreland made harmless outs. Then the Blue Jays hitters went back to work in the top of the second. It was actually a quiet inning. They only had one hit, Pillar’s home run. Dickey set down the side in order in the second, and the Blue Jays went back to work on offense in the third. Donaldson walked, and Jose Bautista doubled, which indicated the end of Holland’s day. He lasted two innings plus two more batters in the third and gave up six runs. Colby Lewis, who was another candidate to start the game, entered and did better, but the Blue Jays were still swinging. Edwin Encarnacion hit into a fielder’s choice that scored Donaldson, Colabello doubled down the left-field line for another run and Pillar singled in Colabello, extending the Blue Jays’ lead to 7-1. The Rangers finally got on the scoreboard in the third, but it had as much to do with the unpredictability of Dickey’s knuckleball as their ability to hit. With two outs, Shin-Soo Choo singled to right field and Adrian Beltre, who returned to the lineup after missing two games with a bad back, singled on a ground ball to center, pushing Choo to third base. Dickey then unleashed a wild pitch, allowing Choo to score from third. But he recovered and got Fielder to line out to center. From there things began to settle down, and as the game moved into the fifth inning, the Blue Jays had Price warming up, even with a substantial lead. Sure enough, with two outs and Robinson Chirinos on first base after an infield single, Gibbons went to Price, who got Choo to fly out to center. Most of the fans who came remained in their seats until the unhappy ending, when Roberto Osuna pitched a perfect ninth to secure the win and even a series in which the home team has yet to win. Correction: October 12, 2015 \nAn earlier version of this article misstated the inning in which the Toronto Blue Jays hit their third home run. It was the second inning, not the third.
