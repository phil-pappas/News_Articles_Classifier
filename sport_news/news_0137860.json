In fact, the words are emblazoned across the inside of Kyle Field in College Station, Tex. \nBut, what exactly does it mean? Who is the 12th Man? \nThe term refers to the entire student body and the notion that everyone at Texas A&M is part of the football team. \nAccording to Texas A&M's athletics website , the history of the tradition goes like this: \n\"The tradition was born on the second of January 1922, when an underdog Aggie team was playing Centre College, then the nation's top ranked team. As the hard fought game wore on, and the Aggies dug deeply into their limited reserves, Coach Dana X. Bible remembered a squad man who was not in uniform. He had been up in the press box helping reporters identify players. His name was E. King Gill, and was a former football player who was only playing basketball. Gill was called from the stands, suited up, and stood ready throughout the rest of the game, which A&M finally won 22-14. \nWhen the game ended, E. King Gill was the only man left standing on the sidelines for the Aggies. Gill later said, 'I wish I could say that I went in and ran for the winning touchdown, but I did not. I simply stood by in case my team needed me.' This gesture was more than enough for the Aggie Team. Though Gill did not play in the game, he had accepted the call to help his team. He came to be thought of as the Twelfth Man because he stood ready for duty in the event that the eleven men on the gridiron needed assistance.\" \nToday, Aggie fans stay standing for the entire course of the game as they symbolize that additional member of the team.

Find out our predictions! \nThe tradition became even richer in the 1980s, when former Aggies coach Jackie Sherrill held tryouts for what he called the 12th Man Kickoff Team. The group of walk-on players held opponents to one of the lower kickoff return yards in the then Southwest Conference. \nToday, the tradition of the 12th Man stands alongside other popular Texas A&M traditions such as midnight yell practice, yell leaders serving as cheerleaders and cadets kissing their girlfriends after each score.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T17:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T18:16:54.366+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
