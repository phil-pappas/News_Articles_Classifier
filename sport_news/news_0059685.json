They then have a bye before taking on the Cowboys on Nov. 8, also a Sunday night. \nWe checked with stat guru Boop Vetrone, of BoopStats fame, and he informed us that the Birds don't play another day game for 34 days. That will be Nov. 15, when they host the Dolphins. \nBoop says Chip Kelly is a respectable 6-3 in prime-time games in his three years as Eagles coach. His predecessor, Andy Reid was 30-23. All other Eagles coaches combined are 22-20. October memory \nYoungsters might not know this, but there was a time when the Phillies played games in October. \nIn fact, 35 years ago today, the Phillies beat Houston, 8-7, at the Astrodome to win the NLCS, three games to two and advance to the World Series where they defeated the Royals. \nThe Phillies beat the Astros in the 10th inning when Garry Maddox doubled off Frank LaCorte to score Del Unser, who had also doubled. Quick response \nKudos to the paramedics who revived an unidentified runner who suffered an apparent heart attack during yesterday's Chicago Marathon. \nThe Chicago Tribune reported that the man, believed to be in his 60s, was taken by ambulance to a hospital where his condition stabilized.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T03:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T03:33:19.027+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
