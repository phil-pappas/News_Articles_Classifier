Interim Coach Luke Walton won't try to change a thing, of course, after a season in which the team won its first NBA title since 1975. Every starter and key backup returns to help what should be a strong repeat bid. \n2. Clippers \nProjected starters: Chris Paul, Blake Griffin, DeAndre Jordan, Paul Pierce , J.J. Redick. \nTop reserves: Jamal Crawford, Lance Stephenson , Josh Smith , Austin Rivers, Wesley Johnson . \nAs if to underscore the opportunity presented by Jordan's return and the addition of an actual NBA-caliber bench, the Clippers might want to adopt a familiar slogan: Now or never. They seemingly have everything needed to finally make it past the second round of the playoffs so long as Pierce, 38, doesn't endure a Steve Nash-like decline and a bench with overlapping pieces doesn't implode. \n3. Oklahoma City \nProjected starters: Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook, Serge Ibaka, Andre Roberson, Steven Adams. \nTop reserves: D.J. Augustin, Enes Kanter, Nick Collison, Dion Waiters, Anthony Morrow. \nRemember the Thunder? It was only three years ago that the franchise made the Finals, with many happy returns expected. Then James Harden was traded, various body parts of Durant and Westbrook broke down and it was see-ya-playoffs last spring. Oklahoma City should return under new Coach Billy Donovan, assuming its stars stay off the injury list and Durant's looming free agency doesn't become a season-long distraction. \n4. San Antonio \nProjected starters: Tim Duncan, LaMarcus Aldridge , Tony Parker, Kawhi Leonard, Danny Green. \nTop reserves: David West , Boris Diaw, Patty Mills, Manu Ginobili. \nProjecting the Spurs' finish in the standings can be hard for reasons that have nothing to do with talent. Coach Gregg Popovich likes to rest his aging stars, leading to a handful of losses that push his team lower than it should be based on its personnel. Adding Aldridge and West figures to give San Antonio its deepest frontcourt since David Robinson teamed with Duncan. \n5. Houston \nProjected starters: James Harden, Dwight Howard, Ty Lawson , Trevor Ariza, Terrence Jones. \nTop reserves: Corey Brewer, Patrick Beverley, Donatas Motiejunas, Clint Capela. \nLawson gives the Rockets the playmaker they wanted to complement Harden, who often tried to carry the team's entire offensive burden himself. Of course, there's a catch: Lawson must overcome the personal issues that led to another arrest for driving under the influence of alcohol. If he's successful, the Rockets could be contenders even in the loaded West. \n6. Memphis \nProjected starters: Marc Gasol, Zach Randolph, Mike Conley, Jeff Green, Courtney Lee. \nTop reserves: Tony Allen, Brandan Wright , Matt Barnes , Beno Udrih, Vince Carter. \nThe Grizzlies are like a car company that keeps rolling out the same model year after year, updating only the stereo system and temperature controls. Fortunately, it's been a fairly successful model. The vocal Barnes should add some acoustics and Wright some highlight plays off the bench, but this will again be a team that largely goes as far as Gasol, Randolph and Conley take it. \n7. New Orleans \nProjected starters: Anthony Davis, Eric Gordon, Jrue Holiday, Omer Asik, Dante Cunningham. \nTop reserves: Ryan Anderson, Tyreke Evans, Alexis Ajinca, Norris Cole. \nThe Pelicans should no longer plod along, instead adapting to the style of new Coach Alvin Gentry, the architect of supercharged offenses with the Clippers and Golden State. Gentry will have plenty of talent to mold to his liking, starting with the league's most dynamic young center in Davis. It also helps that the team's roster has remained essentially intact from last season. \n8. Phoenix \nProjected starters: Eric Bledsoe, Brandon Knight, Tyson Chandler , Markieff Morris, P.J. Tucker. \nTop reserves: T.J. Warren, Mirza Teletovic, Alex Len, Ronnie Price , Sonny Weems. \nThe Suns' fortunes figure to be volatile until the felony aggravated assault case involving Morris and his departed brother Marcus is resolved. Markieff Morris also has some making up to do with Suns fans after criticizing the volume level inside US Airways Center and asking to be traded. Newcomer Chandler figures to bring a steadying presence on defense and in the locker room. \nEARLY OFF-SEASON:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T15:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T15:09:12.428+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
