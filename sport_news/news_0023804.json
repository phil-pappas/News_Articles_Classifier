They know how to play. We just have to create a situation where it is possible to do this,\" Klopp was quoted as saying by the British media. \n\"I am not sure how many games you saw like this from Adam Lallana? I know him from Southampton and he can do 20-30 percent more. Philippe Coutinho? Do you not think he can play better football than today? Of course, he can. \n\"Lucas? You don't think he can play balls on the right and left side? Of course he can. Emre Can? Learning between running and passing? He can learn. \n\"(James) Milner? The complete football player, the perfect professional. (You think) I should teach them technical aspects? They know. We have to altogether help them to show it,\" he added. \nKlopp will be hoping to pick up his first win as a Liverpool manager on Thursday when they host Russian side Rubin Kazan in the Europa League. \n(Reporting by Shravanth Vijayakumar in Bengaluru; Editing by John O'Brien) \nOur top photos from the past week.
