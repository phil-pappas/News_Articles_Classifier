The segregated data prior to 1997 are not available.\nInvestor appetite returned after the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Governor Raghuram Rajan last month pulled off a surprise by announcing a bigger-than-expected policy rate cut of 50 bps to 6.75 per cent — the lowest in four and a half years — to spur growth, said Gaurav Jain, Director, Hem Securities.\nFurthermore, RBI’s move of increasing the FPI limit in government securities has helped overseas investors park their money in the debt market.\nBesides, positive macro parameters cheered, with industrial production growing at a nearly three-year high of 6.4 per cent in August, infrastructure output growing 2.6 per cent in the same month and fiscal deficit for April-August narrowing to 66.5 per cent of the full-year target.\nMoreover, the rate cut by China’s central bank will have a positive effect on inflow.\nSince the beginning of the year, overseas investors have made a net investment of Rs 26,592 crore in equities and Rs 53,234 crore in debt market.\n 25, 2015 11:09 am", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T18:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T08:55:27.794+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
