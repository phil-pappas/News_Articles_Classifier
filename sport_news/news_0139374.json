Much the focus from this game might be on injuries to key players from both sides while the Rangers pitchers deserve credit for holding the mighty Jays to three runs. \nBlue Jays ace David Price took the loss, which means he's now 0-6 as a starter in the postseason (he's 1-6 career thanks to a victory in relief in 2008). \nThe line for Price on Thursday: 7 IP, 5 H, 5 ER, 2 BB, 5 K, 2 HBP, 2 HR. \nNow, by no means does starter record tell you everything about a pitcher. Most people know this these days, but there's still a focus on record and when you see \"0-6\" about a guy we all accept as an ace, some might feel he's not getting it done when it matters most. \nMake no mistake, David Price can get it done. Remember that complete-game effort against the Rangers in Game 163 in 2013? Price went the distance, allowing two earned runs in a Rays win to get them into the playoffs, but that didn't count as a playoff game (even though it basically was). \nFurther, Price's ALDS start last season was a very good one. He allowed two runs on five hits in eight innings. It's just that his offense only provided one run in support. \nSo it's not as though Price cowers at the sight of a big game. He can be money. He's shown that. \nHe's also shown overall that he hasn't lived up to his regular-season dossier in the postseason. \nAs a starter in the postseason, Price is now 0-6 with a 5.23 ERA and eight home runs allowed in six starts. That's not ace-quality pitching, and the accountable Price knows as much, admitting to nerves for the outing. \n\"I feel like in the first inning I was moreso battling nerves,\" he said afterward on the broadcast. \"I have nerves for a spring-training start, for my first bullpen of the year. I care. If you're not nervous for those first couple of pitches out there in the first inning, I don't feel like you're human. I care a ton. I want go out there and pitch well for my teammates and pitch well for this country and I didn't do that.\" \nIf his teammates pick him up, he'll have another shot in Game 5. If not, he'll head into free agency with questions regarding his career postseason resume, fair or not. \nDavid Price had a rough outing on Thursday.
