Over the past year I think I've improved in my game a lot. He goes through little things with me on the pitch and individual stuff,\" Chambers told the club website.\n\"He gives me advice so over the past year my game has improved massively,\" he added.\nFrenchman Wenger has helped develop players like Thierry Henry, Patrick Vieira and Cesc Fabregas into world class talents. Chambers said it played a key role in his decision to join fellow Southampton youth academy graduates Theo Walcott and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain at Arsenal.\n\"It was a massive factor. Theo and Alex came from Southampton as well, and they've both come through to the first team,\" the 22-year-old said.\n\"He's renowned for bringing young players through and developing them.
