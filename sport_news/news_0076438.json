If you're planning on riding in Chicago, don't wait. This show will be sold out faster than you can say \"decapitated.\"\nWe hear of the singers' terrible fate — one poor girl, the headless Jane Doe, was never identified — from The Amazing Karnak, one of those old-school fortune-telling machines who serves as the booth-bound narrator of this piece and who has, it turns out, a guilty conscience, since he was in a position to warn the teens off the ride and failed to do so.\nKarnak is on borrowed time, since we can see that a huge rat is slowly eating through his power cable. So Karnak, played as a sandpaper-dry cynic by Karl Hamilton, asks the teens to vote for which one of them gets to return to the world of the living. They all sing to make their case.\nThe favored candidate is Ocean O'Connell Rosenberg (Tiffany Tatreau), an overachiever who likes to improvise but only when she has pre-improvised all scenarios involving herself. There's Constance Blackwood (Lillian Castillo), a nice girl, it seems, although capable of ruining Ocean's moment when she laments that all the rest of her group died without having sex (Constance got in under the wire). There's Noel Gruber (Kholby Wardell), a gay Taco Bell alumnus and a kid who, Ocean reminds him, calls out the lie of the stereotype that \"all gay dudes are fun to be around.\" There's a physically challenged teen called Ricky Potts (Jackson Evans), who dreams of an idealized self. Along with Jane Doe (Emily Rohm), a walking corpse with a blanked-out visage, the group is completed by Ukrainian rapper Mischa Bachinski (Russell Mernagh). The arc of the story involves who will get voted back onto the island of the living, so to speak. Or so to sing.\nIf you're a culturally savvy type, you'll recognize plenty of sources in play here. Structural similarities with \"Spelling Bee\" abound. The ambience recalls \"Shockheaded Peter.\" The end of \"Forever Plaid\" popped into my head, because \"Cyclone\" employs many of the same music-geek jokes that served that show-choir musical, which in part, begat \"Glee.\"\nKarnak is a refugee from the movie \"Big.\" There's some of the rebellion of \"Spring Awakening,\" as well as the humor of \"Bat Boy,\" the culty weirdness of \"American Horror Story,\" a soupcon of Lin-Manuel Miranda-like accessible hip-hop, and plenty of the kind of Canadian self-deprecation you can find in the work of comedian Bob Martin or at Second City Toronto. And then you have all the nods to that vast horror genre (such as Stephen King's \"The Dead Zone\") involving dead kids, dolls, group-think teen dynamics and, of course, disasters at creepy fairgrounds.\nNo wonder at least one Broadway producer was in the house Wednesday night.\nGenerally speaking, the weird shows that work commercially are both fresh (and \"Ride the Cyclone\" is edgy and just dangerous enough to feel fresh) and yet completely steeped in the traditions of musical theater — \"Hamilton,\" which is selling tickets on Broadway almost as fast as the Fed can print $10 bills, is Exhibit A in that regard. I'm not saying \"Ride the Cyclone\" is at that level, but it does have that same proven combination.\nAnd it also has some thematic heft. Even a sardonic satire about dead teenagers makes you think about our exits from this world — and, in the last few minutes, there are some resonant lines about how decrying the death of the young can overshadow the lives they did live, finite like all existences. There are some sardonic lines about dead-end jobs. Poor Noel, who wants to be Marlene Dietrich, has to settle for a sandwich named after him at Taco Bell and discovers, alas too late, that he wasted most of his life inside the suffocating walls of a regional mall. And — best of all — the show does put you in mind of the arbitrary nature of who gets to live and who dies young. Once the winner returns (I won't give away who), we watch his/her life unspool before us via Mike Tutaj's superb video projections of a life, lived with quiet happiness, in Saskatchewan. Which could be DeKalb.\nThe look of this show — the main, carnival-driven scenic design is by Scott Davis, and Melissa Veal's makeup is similarly exceptional — is theatrical-horror yet quite classy. And it works to be able to see the remnants of the old Navy Pier Ferris wheel in the lobby.\nIn contrast to Rockwell's recent production of \"October Sky,\" which seemed rushed and rote, this staging is blisteringly good, sophisticated and detailed down to the very last moment. The choreography is constantly surprising.\nI think \"Ride the Cyclone\" needs a bit more work. The production could use more emotional beats; in a few spots, it's overly frenetic and overstaged, actually. Rockwell needs to find more room for our personal connection with these characters; empathy is everything in such a musical. And I think the score, although quite varied and satisfying, still lacks at least a couple more hefty, grab-hold numbers. It needs a signature anthem; another ballad; a more complex group number. This does not need to be a Grand Guignol-style pastiche; \"Cyclone\" needs to live as a legit musical, and it is not yet fully there. But this thing sure is smartly written; it's rare in a new musical at this stage that the score is more of a problem than the book. And it is not that much of a problem at all.\nThis new Chicago production (Doug Peck is the musical director, and there is a five-piece band in the rafters) does not feature voices uniformly of Broadway quality, but it's still a stirring and immensely talented ensemble, led by the guilelessly manipulative Tatreau (who is terrific) and anchored by the honesty of Castillo. Rohm has the job of playing a character without her original head, and her work is really quite something here as she wanders into the audience, unknown and unknowable. And dead.\nI suppose I should make clear that there is no Uranium, Saskatchewan, but there is uranium in Saskatchewan, and there are kids and fairs and rides and small towns. And, especially at this time of year, there's a craving for the dreadful; as if the news does not already contain enough horrors of teens cut down in their prime. Maybe it's just one of the ways we cope.\nChris Jones is a Tribune critic.\ncjones5@tribpub.com\nTwitter @ChrisJonesTrib\n\"Ride the Cyclone\" — 4 stars\nWhen: Through Nov. 8\nWhere: Chicago Shakespeare Theater, Upstairs Theatre on Navy Pier\nRunning time: 1 hour, 30 minutes\nTickets: $30-$48 at 312-595-5600 or www.chicagoshakes.com\n Travel Stephen King Entertainment", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-5616c831/turbine/ct-ride-cyclone-review-ent-1009-20151008"], "published": "2015-10-08T22:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T01:01:19.474+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
