The arhtiyas opened three gates of the local grain market, which were locked yesterday. They also lifted the dharna that they had started on September 30 against the rice mill owner in front of his rice mill situated on the Sangrur-Ubhawal road, near here. The local arhtiyas, led by Bhim Sain, president of the Sangrur Arhtiya Association, were protesting since September 26 against rice mill owner Rupinder Bansal and his partners, accusing them of not making payments to the tune of Rs 18 crore to 120 arhtiyas for paddy purchased by the rice mill from the arhtiyas in October 2014. Meanwhile, the Superintendent of Police (Detective), Sangrur, today held a meeting with the partners of the rice mill and the arhtiyas to sort the issue. Bhim Sain said in case the rice mill owner did not make the payment till October 6, they would hold a meeting on October 7 to take a decision to intensify the agitation.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T00:12:12.043+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
