So, hey, what's another one to add to the pile?\nWhen Jimmy Butler came into the league out of Marquette in 2011, he was considered a stout defender and average in nearly every other category. Since then, he has steadily improved his game, averaging career-highs in points (20), rebounds (5.8) and assists (3.3) per game last season.\nRecently , Chicago Bulls head coach Fred Hoiberg raved about Butler and it had nothing to do with his offensive or defensive capabilities . Instead, he wanted to talk about the intangibles, as well as drop a little MJ comparison in the process.\nHoiberg on Butler: \"Jimmy, he wants to assume that role, like Kevin Garnett, Michael Jordan, pulling everyone with him with leadership.\"\n— Sam Smith (@SamSmithHoops) October 7, 2015 Hoiberg on Butler: \"Even on our two-a-days, he’d still come in a 3rd time. It’s unbelievable how much energy he has; he’s just so dedicated\"\n— Sam Smith (@SamSmithHoops) October 7, 2015 While the comparison to Jordan and KG seems like a lofty one, you can see where Hoiberg is coming from. Butler is a fierce competitor who leads by example.\nThis offseason, the Bulls were wise to ink Butler to a lucrative five-year, $95 million deal. At only 26, the Houston, Texas native appears to be the type of player you can build your team around in more ways than one. He fills up a stat sheet on a nightly basis and does all the little things that you ask out of your franchise player.\nSend all complaints, compliments, and tips to sportstips@complex.com\n[via Dime ]", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/SamSmithHoops/status/651646113632645120", "http://uproxx.com/dimemag/2015/10/jimmy-butler-michael-jordan-leadership-fred-hoiberg-bulls/", "https://twitter.com/SamSmithHoops/status/651645847252402176"], "published": "2015-10-08T04:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T08:27:57.843+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
