Koufax last achieved the feat in 1966.\nAfter reaching his limit of 60 pitches, Kershaw left the game to another standing ovation in the fourth, having registered seven strikeouts while allowing only two baserunners on singles in 3-2/3 innings.\nThe left-hander retired 10 successive batters from the first through the fourth innings and finish with 301 strikeouts before the Dodgers went on to complete their win.\nThe Dodgers will head into the National League Division Series against the New York Mets in Los Angeles on Friday on a four-game winning streak.\n(Reporting by Mark Lamport-Stokes in Los Angeles; Editing by Greg Stutchbury)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T02:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T02:10:21.031+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
