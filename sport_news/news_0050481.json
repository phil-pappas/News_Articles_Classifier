Some of the ailments and injuries are so specific that they seem ridiculous, such as being vacuumed up by a jet engine, burned by fiery water skis or the famous W56.22 — \"struck by an orca,\" which became the title of a illustrated book of odd ICD-10 codes.\nWe've include some of those and other favorites of ours in the above slide show.\nHealth care providers have dreaded the new system because of the work involved.\nDo you suffer from carpal tunnel syndrome? Your doctor must figure out which of nine codes apply to your condition. Failure to use the right code or mismatching a diagnosis and procedural code can result in an insurer rejecting the claim.\nNo wonder physicians are ready to pull out their hair, which, by the way, has its own code — F63.3.\nMedical professionals have vented about the hardship of the switchover on social media, some even putting up mock horror decorations similar to Halloween displays.", "external_links": ["http://shop.icd10illustrated.com/collections/frontpage/products/book", "http://www.icd10data.com/", "https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10206666526333576&set=a.1013054058375.2338.1585747732&type=3"], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T10:02:59.839+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
