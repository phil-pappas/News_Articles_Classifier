Their keeper came out and she got enough on it to get the ball to trickle into the goal,” Ferguson said. Elmira got an assist from Horseheads two minutes later. The Express turned a corner kick into a score when the ball bounced off a Blue Raiders player. For the rest of the game, the teams just went back and forth. On the day, Horseheads outshot the Express 12-10. The Blue Raiders also head a slight 4-3 advantage in corner kicks. “Both teams had fast players, so speed-wise it was a fast game,” Ferguson said. “It was just a great game to watch.” Horseheads had great chance to take the lead in the second half, but missed on a penalty kick. Elmira had a point-blank chance for the game-winner sail over the crossbar. Elmira’s Skylar Sancomb stopped 11 shots, while Horseheads goalie duo of Kelsey Walker and Erin McCawley combined for 10 saves. “The first time we played, we didn’t show up and Elmira beat us 4-1,” Ferguson said. “I think this game proved to ourselves that we can play at this level.” Elmira (11-2-1) entered the game as the No. 4 team in the state. Horseheads will get another chance to prove themselves when it travels to undefeated Vestal at 7 p.m. Monday. “Vestal hasn’t allowed a goal this season,” Ferguson said.
