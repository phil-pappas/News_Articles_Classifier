We have a winner! \nNot once, but twice the men tasked with carrying the injured Leonardo Koutris from a soccer field in Greece tripped and dropped the stretcher. It made for high comedy, unless your name happened to be Leonardo Koutris. \nAnd then, when the bearers get off the pitch, they drop Koutris with a thud. To make matters worse, Koutris’ Ergotelis team lost to AE Larissa in the Greek Second Division tilt.
