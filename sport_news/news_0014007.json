He intercepted two passes, made 20 tackles and was named to the Conference USA all-freshman team.\nIsaiah Worthy, a 6-foot-1, 235-pound linebacker from Westville, N.J., played in 11?games as a freshman, starting two, and had 21 tackles and two fumble recoveries.\nYet in what he calls an investment in ODU's football future, coach Bobby Wilder is redshirting a record 20 scholarship players, including Byrum and Worthy, meaning they are practicing but will not play this season.\nHe's also redshirting 14 freshmen who walked on.\n\"This will be so good for our program down the road,\" Wilder said.\n\"We are redshirting some guys who could help us now. But this means they will get stronger and more mature and help us in the future.\"\nFour freshmen have played significant roles for ODU this season heading into Saturday's game at Florida Atlantic. Tim Ward and Miles Fox start on the defensive line, while running backs Jeremy Cox and Kesean Strong back up sophomore Ray Lawry.\nWith receiver David Washington recently having moved to quarterback, and receiver Blair Roberts out indefinitely with an injury, freshman wideout Eri'Reon Hayes started Saturday against Florida International. His first career reception was a 13-yarder that gave ODU a first-and-goal at the 1. He had not previously played this season.\nWilder said freshman generally don't play in their first game after the midpoint of the season, but in this case, Hayes has been better in practice than some upperclassmen.\nAmong those sitting out are defensive backs Jamez Brickhouse (Bayside), Kane Miskel (King's Fork) and Denzel Williams from Dinwiddie. Prior to the season, defensive coordinator Rich Nagy said all three had to play.\n\"We've had other guys step up,\" Wilder said, referring to C.J. Bradsaw, Brandon Addison (Western Branch) and Sean Carter.\nBrickhouse said he wanted to play right away, \"but I realized I need to get bigger and strong.\"\nByrum turned down four ACC schools to come to ODU, and was a three-star recruit, so when he learned he was redshirting, it was a little blow to his ego.\n\"But you've got to swallow that and think about the bigger picture,\" he said. \"This is about everyone on the team getting better.\"\nWilder said it's unlikely any more freshmen will play, but that could change.\n\"What enters the evaluation is where are we in terms of a conference championship, where are we in terms of pursuit of a bowl game,\" he said.\nNotes: Conference USA presidents are scheduled to meet Monday in Irving, Texas, where they are expected to name Judy Mac-Leod the conference's new commissioner. She would be the first female commissioner of an FBS league. She was named interim commissioner when Britton Banowsky stepped down during the summer.... Tight end Adam Swann, knocked out of preseason practice with a broken leg, redshirted last season, but ODU will apply for a medical redshirt.... Linebacker Derek Wilder, Bobby Wilder's son, is among those redshirting, as is tight end Melvin Vaughn, a junior from Oscar Smith injured during preseason practice.\nHarry Minium, 757-446-2371, harry.minium@pilotonline.com, Twitter: @harry_miniumVP \nConnect with ODUBlitz Follow @Harry_miniumVP <img style = \" position: relative; float:left; margin-right:25px;border:1px solid silver;\" src=\" http://media.hamptonroads.com/cache/files/images/886361000.jpg\" width=\"100\" height=\"75\" border=0\"></a> <h4>At ODUBlitz.com</h4> <ul class=\"disc\"> <li><a href=\"http://hamptonroads.com/blogs/harry-minium\">Harry Minium's ODU football blog</a> <li><a href=\"http://hamptonroads.com/pilot/sports/odu-football\">More ODU football news</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://hamptonroads.com/2015/04/2015-old-dominion-football-schedule\">2015 schedule</a> | <a href=\"http://hamptonroads.com/2014/09/future-odu-football-schedules-20142025\">Future</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://www.sportsnetwork.com/merge/tsnform.aspx?c=hamptonroads&page=cfoot2/conf/independent/tmstat.aspx?id=YX1\">Statistics</a> | <a href=\"http://www.sportsnetwork.com/merge/tsnform.aspx?c=hamptonroads&page=cfoot/conf/confusa/standings.aspx?season=2013,sc=AF,conf=Conference%20USA\">C-USA standings</a> | <a href=\"http://hamptonroads.com/2014/02/breakdown-old-dominions-2014-recruiting-class\">Recruiting</a></li> </ul> </div> </div></div> </div> <div id=\"omc-right\"> <div class=\"related\"> <div class=\"related_inner\"> <h4>Related</h4> <ul class=\"disc\"> <li><a href=\"/2015/10/odu-drubbed-miami-florida-international\">ODU drubbed in Miami by Florida International</a> - Oct. 25, 2015</li> <li><a href=\"/2015/10/live-coverage-odu-florida-international\">Live coverage | ODU at Florida International</a> - Oct. 24, 2015</li> <li><a href=\"/2015/10/monarchs-margin-error-grows-thin\">Monarchs' margin for error grows thin</a> - Oct. 24, 2015</li> <li><a href=\"/2015/10/odu-report-lawrys-fumbles-led-his-benching-against-charlotte\">ODU report | Lawry's fumbles led to his benching against Charlotte</a> - Oct. 21, 2015</li> <li><a href=\"/2015/10/new-qb-newlook-playbook-monarchs\">New QB, new-look playbook for the Monarchs</a> - Oct. 20, 2015</li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div> </aside> <div class=\"story-head story-foot\"> <h2><strong>Posted to</strong>: <span class=\"tag\"><a href=\"/category/pilotonline.com/sports/college-football\">College Football</a> <a href=\"/tags/collegefootball\">College Football</a> <a href=\"/category/norfolk\">Norfolk</a> <a href=\"/category/pilotonlinecom/sports/collegefootball/odufootball\">ODU Football</a> <a href=\"/tags/odufootball\">ODU football</a> <a href=\"/category/pilotonline.com/sports\">Sports</a></span></h2> <div id=\"socialButtons2\" class=\"gigya-sharebar\"></div> </div>", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T14:05:39.171+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
