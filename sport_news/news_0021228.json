Shashank Manohar \n\"Since he was not at the ICC meeting I phoned him and he invited me to tour India after a Working Committee meeting of the BCCI and I hope to get a final answer in eight to 10 days,\" Khan said at a media conference in Lahore. \n\"I have told the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) officials during discussions with them in Dubai that they must confirm or reject the tour in the next 10 to 12 days,\" he said. \n\"The new President of the Indian board Shashank Manohar has assured us that he is keen on having Indo-Pak series and on resolving all issues between the two boards. We have stressed on the need to further improve relations between the two Boards,\" Khan said. \nThe former diplomat said that he had stressed upon the Indian Board officials that they must honour the MoU signed between the two Boards to play six bilateral series between 2015-2023, starting Pakistan's 'home' series in December this year. \nThe PCB chief said they had also informed the ICC about the BCCI not honouring the MoU as yet. He said as far as Pakistan was concerned Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif had already given a go-ahead that cricket must be played between the two nations. \n\"So there is no delay on our side we are ready. The ball is now in the court of the Indian Board,\" he said. \nWith India tied up in their home series with South Africa until December 5 and then also scheduled to host Australia from early January, speculations are rife that the Indian Board might get clearance to play a revised series in December in the UAE. \nPCB sources said the series could now have a Test, three ODIs and two T20 matches but indications are the series will be held in December. \nPTI", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T15:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T16:40:55.442+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
