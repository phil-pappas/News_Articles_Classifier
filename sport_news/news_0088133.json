Radar echoes will in turn be collected by the National Radio Astronomy Observatory's Green Bank Telescope in Green Bank, West Virginia, and the National Astronomy and Ionosphere Center's Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico.\nNASA scientists hope to obtain radar images of the asteroid as fine as about 2 metres per pixel.
