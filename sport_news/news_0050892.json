Frascatore has been put on desk duty. \nMayor Bill de Blasio (dih BLAH'-zee-oh) and police Commissioner William Bratton have apologized to Blake, who retired after the 2013 U.S. Open. \nBlake has said Frascatore should lose his job. The police union boss has said the officer \"did a professional job.\" \nAll content copyright ©2015 Pendleton Times-Post, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T01:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T01:46:45.230+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
