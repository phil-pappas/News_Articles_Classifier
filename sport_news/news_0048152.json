Raji (groin), right guard T.J. Lang (knee) and linebacker Nick Perry (shoulder) all were knocked out of the game and did not return.\nIf those players were out next week for the San Diego game and nothing else changed on the team's injury list, the Packers' seven game-day inactives would all be injured players and coach Mike McCarthy would have only 45 available players because No. 3 quarterback Brett Hundley would be one of the actives.\n\"We've got seven days,\" McCarthy said of getting his team healthy before the Chargers come into Lambeau Field. \"We've had a grind, just the bumps and bruises part of it.\"\nMcCarthy did not give any updates on Raji, Lang and Perry, so it's not clear how long any of them will be out. Lang and Perry were taken to the locker room and did not return to the sideline. Raji's injury didn't seem as serious and he stood on the sideline after leaving the game.\nJosh Walker replaced Lang for all but one series and appeared not to be overmatched.\n\"I thought I came out a little flat,\" Walker said. \"But as the game wore on I definitely felt better. I'll have to watch the tape and see tomorrow.\"\nRaji, who has been a disruptive force in the middle, was missed. The Rams running game picked up considerably while he was out. But the Packers have Letroy Guion , who is working himself back into football shape after a three-game suspension, and Mike Pennel , who saw considerable playing time when Guion was out.\nIn the case of Perry, who was off to his best start as a pro with 3&frac12; sacks, including a half sack before leaving Sunday, the Packers are getting strong performances out of fellow outside linebackers Julius Peppers , Mike Neal and Jayrone Elliott and were able to give Andy Mulumba a good number of snaps as well.\nComing into the game, the Packers lost safety Sean Richardson to a herniated disk, but thanks to Chris Banjo they were able to continue playing their three-safety package. Their depth in the secondary was particularly evident given starting safety Morgan Burnett (calf) missed a third straight game and yet were able to get a strong performance from Banjo and a two-interception game from rookie cornerback Quinten Rollins .\nThe chances of Burnett and receiver Davante Adams (ankle) returning before the bye Oct. 25 don't appear great, so McCarthy's job will be getting his team through this week without a letdown.\n\"We're playing a lot of people,\" McCarthy said. \"We're banged up.\"\nSlip up: All week, special teams coach Ron Zook warned his players that Rams coach Jeff Fisher would try to pull off a trick play on special teams and told them to look for anything unusual in personnel and formations.\nSo when the Rams lined up in a traditional punt formation no one thought anything of it.\n\"It looked like a basic formation,\" Banjo said.\nMaybe that's exactly why Fisher used that formation to run a punt fake. To the Packers' credit, they played the way they were supposed to and reacted to punter Johnny Hekker pulling the ball down and looking to pass it downfield exactly the way Zook wanted.\n\"We did a great job preparing for it this week,\" Banjo said. \"From what I saw, we were all in pretty good position. We just had a guy slip. We saw what was happening right away and did a great job playing it.\"\nHekker had to scramble to his right and he was only able to complete his 20-yard pass to Cody Davis when cornerback Demetri Goodson slipped on the turf. Goodson had run with Davis into the middle of the field but fell while trying to pivot up the field.\nBack in place: The return of right tackle Bryan Bulaga helped the Packers deal with a St. Louis pass rush that could have caused much more disruption than it did.\nBulaga, who was back three weeks after surgery to repair torn cartilage in his left knee, played in the entire game and didn't appear any worse for wear. Bulaga didn't look rusty and didn't appear to have any terribly bad plays.\n\"I felt fine,\" Bulaga said. \"It went well. I didn't notice anything. I had some bad plays. I'm willing enough to admit that. From the health standpoint it felt fine.\"\nMcCarthy said it felt good to have his starting right tackle back.\n\"I thought he looked good in the locker room,\" he said. \"That's all I'm really concerned about. He was happy, jumping around. There's nothing like getting a big, old sweaty hug by a 320-pound offensive tackle, so he looks good.\"\nCounted out: Aaron Rodgers has been able to help his offensive line stem opposing pass rushes with the use of a hard count, but it was obvious the Rams had worked diligently on not jumping offsides on Rodgers's count.\nRodgers got them just once.\nRodgers said he thought too much attention might have been given to protection against the Rams instead of trusting the offensive line. It could have explained why the Packers struggled so much offensively.\n\"I think we need to trust those guys even more moving forward to get the job done,\" Rodgers said of the offensive line.\nRecord will have to wait: Kicker Mason Crosby tied the franchise record for field goal attempts with 277 with a 35-yard conversion in the fourth quarter.\nThe record would have been his if tight end Richard Rodgers had not been called for an illegal use of hands penalty at the start of the fourth quarter. The penalty pushed the Packers back to the 39-yard line and McCarthy chose to punt.\nAn unhappy dozen: McCarthy was seething about a pair of 12 men on the field penalties the Packers drew in the fourth quarter.\n\"Once on defense and once on offense in the fourth quarter in the fifth game of the year,\" McCarthy said. \"That's the kind of stuff you got to get the hell out of here. There's no place for that. That's the stuff that we've got to clean up.\"\n ", "external_links": ["http://analytics.apnewsregistry.com/analytics/v2/image.svc/JSI/RWS/jsonline.com/CAI/331960901/E/prod/PC/Basic/AT/A"], "published": "2015-10-12T09:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T01:24:27.748+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
