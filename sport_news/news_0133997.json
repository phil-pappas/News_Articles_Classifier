Two: The Wolf Pack was late for the kickoff. \nStaying in Cheyenne, about 50 miles from Laramie, the Wolf Pack’s drive to the stadium took 3 hours, 15 minutes thanks to a major accident on I-80, which forced the game to be delayed by an hour. The Wolf Pack plays at winless Wyoming on Saturday. Who will win and why? Chris Murray/RGJ \nThe trip home after the game wasn’t a picnic, either, as a snow and ice storm closed I-80, causing the team bus to have to go through Fort Collins, Colo., before reaching Cheyenne, which pushed back Nevada’s charter home and meant the team didn’t arrive in Reno until 6:30 the following morning. \nWith temperatures in the 70s expected Saturday, travel to and from the game is expected to be a lot smoother, but the Wolf Pack is hoping from the same end result as that 2000 game: a victory. \nHere are three keys to Nevada’s game at Wyoming, which kicks off at 1 p.m. at War Memorial Stadium. Murray's Sunday List: Top-10 WRs in Wolf Pack history \n1. Match the physicality \nAfter playing a team last week in New Mexico that is based on triple-option trickery, Nevada faces a much different challenge this week as it faces Wyoming, which features a smash-mouth style of ball. The Cowboys aren’t loaded with blazing athletes, so they emphasize strength over speed. Wyoming is going to line up, keep things simple and try to be the tougher team over 60 minutes. Nevada has to match that physical style of play and be fully invested in a road game against a winless team. If the Wolf Pack doesn’t match that toughness, it will lose because Wyoming, despite its struggles, is still playing hard. \n2. Win the turnover battle \nOne of the reasons Wyoming is still seeking its first win is because of turnovers. Wyoming has turned the ball over 12 times and gained just four turnovers, a minus-eight margin that ranks as the seventh worst in the nation. Nevada is at plus-four in turnovers, good for 29th nationally. After a slow start, the Wolf Pack defense has created eight turnovers in the last four games. Nevada’s goal is three forced turnovers per game, which is realistic given how turnover-prone Wyoming has been. With the Cowboys a home underdog, they can’t afford to be on the minus margin in turnovers if they’re going to spring the upset. \n3. Red zone success \nNevada has been excellent in the red zone this season, scoring touchdowns on 66.7 percent of its appearances inside the 20 (and scoring at least a field goal in 90.5 percent of those appearances). Wyoming has been the opposite. In fact, Wyoming has been the worst in the nation, scoring at least a field goal on only 54.5 percent of its red zone chances (and a touchdown on 50 percent). Defensively, the numbers are about the same, with Nevada faring much better in limiting points than Wyoming once a team gets inside its 20. The Wolf Pack has to make sure these two trends continue. 20 CONNECT 4 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://on.rgj.com/1RMK2mB TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T20:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T12:11:54.270+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
