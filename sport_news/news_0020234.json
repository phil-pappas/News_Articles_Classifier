I made sure the drugs came in. I made sure he was cool.”\nGeiger then tweeted at the NFL to urge the league to test Revis for marijuana, saying he helped set up the Jets All-Pro and Gilbert with a drug dealer.\n“Test them,” Geiger tweeted to the league’s Twitter account .\nGeiger also directed his ire at “60 Minutes,” mocking the show for references in its story to Revis’ love of art and taste in clothes.\n“you wrote a bs story based on a guy [that] lived my life,” Geiger tweeted to the show’s Twitter account. “That d–khead don’t look at art. That’s me. I dressed his ass.”\nGeiger later claimed he was hacked and deleted the tweets early Monday morning, then implied that he had been fired as a result of the ensuing social-media firestorm.\n“Both of my parents had cancer,” Geiger wrote. “I was called up saying I was fired by Revis. Not a care in the world.”\nGeiger then tweeted: “I will get deleted. [Jets owner] Woody Johnson is paying to delete this.”\nGeiger and Revis have been friend since grade school growing up near Pittsburgh, and Geiger had been Revis’ manager since the perennial Pro Bowl selection was a first-round pick by the Jets in 2007.\n“I’d say the easiest way to describe it would be that I’m the middle man,” Geiger told the Jets’ fan site Gang Green Nation in 2010. “You can’t get to Darrelle unless you talk to me.”\n  Filed under darrelle revis ,  marijuana ,  new york jets", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T20:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T00:43:26.183+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
