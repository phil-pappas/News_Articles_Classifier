With less than two minutes eclipsed on the game clock, the Clippers were out in front, 7-6, in a battle of undefeated squads vying for conference supremacy. Unfortunately for Falmouth, it would only go downhill from there. LaFrange’s rushing score would serve as the only Clippers lead on the night, as the Rams (5-0, 2-0 ACL) reeled off 44 unanswered points en route to a 50-7 drubbing Friday night at James G. Anderson Field. Falmouth (4-1, 1-1 ACL) had few answers for top-ranked Marshfield, especially senior quarterback Jack Masterson, who threw two touchdown passes and scrambled for a 15-yard score of his own in the second quarter. “We’re not at their level right now,” said Falmouth head coach Derek Almeida. “They’re better than us. That’s all it is. … It wasn’t Xs and Os or schemes, they’re just a better football team and I think they’re going to have a lot of success this year.” Along with LaFrange’s big gain on the ground, the Clippers were also paced by junior quarterback Nick Couhig, who accounted for 131 yards of total offense in the first half. Both teams opened the game with haymakers, as a 60-yard pass from Masterson helped set up a six-yard TD run for junior running back Christian Friedel just 45 seconds into the contest. Falmouth answered back less than a minute later with LaFrange’s touchdown. Marshfield regained the lead three minutes later off Masterson’s 23-yard TD pass to senior tight end Danny Dalton. It appeared that the Clippers regained momentum after senior cornerback Jake Campbell picked off Masterson in the waning moments of the first, but the Rams defense stuffed LaFrange on the 1-yard line to keep Falmouth off the board. Marshfield rolled in the final three quarters of play, scoring five additional touchdowns to seal the convincing win. “I thought our kids came out and fought with them,” Almeida said. “We’re just not there. … I still love our team, I think our kids play hard and I feel good about us going forward. “I’m not going to look at this scoreboard too long.” By Conor Ryan", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T06:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T06:20:18.999+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
