With a workmate, the son of Uncle Mo tracked down a workmate, took the lead and galloped out six furlongs in 1:15.70.\n\"I just wanted a traffic-free fresh track and I do have to thank Santa Anita so much for offering that,\" said O'Neill, who campaigns Nyquist for owner Reddam, same connections as 2012 Derby winner I'll Have Another.\n\"I was very happy, I got him coming home the last eighth in 12 and we actually two minute licked him for three furlongs going into the work...He looked like he did it easily.\"\nA winner in all four of his starts, Nyquist ships to Kentucky on Sunday. He's a leading contender for the Juvenile along with Brody's Cause, who won Keeneland's Breeders' Futurity, and Greenpointcrusader, who took Belmont Park's Champagne Stakes.\nNyquist (outside) works 5f in 1:02 for @BreedersCup Juvenile. pic.twitter.com/dX0bhhJDfU\nâ€” Billy Blake (@BillyBlake22) October 23, 2015", "external_links": ["https://t.co/dX0bhhJDfU", "https://twitter.com/BillyBlake22/status/657638920260227072", "https://twitter.com/BreedersCup"], "published": "2015-10-24T00:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T02:04:58.942+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
