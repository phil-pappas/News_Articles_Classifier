I'm just going to focus on one shot at a time and on my game, because I know there's going to be a lot of great golf from a lot of great players.\" \n\nKo was in the same playing group as Park In-bee, who is tied for 25th place at three-under, and could reclaim the top ranking from her South Korean rival with a victory this week after two wins and a runner-up finish in her last three starts. \n\n\"I don't think about the rankings or if one birdie is going to put me a couple shots in front of her,\" said Ko, who claimed her maiden major title at The Evian Championship in France last month. \n\n\"I feel very fortunate that there is a great competitor like her where I can work harder and be as good as her or get to that ranking. \n\n\"But when we're out there, we are not thinking about it. I think for the crowds and for the media, it makes it really exciting when everything is close.\" \n\nFirst-round leader Park Sung-hyun struggled in the second round and frittered away her four-shot lead by posting a 74 for a share of third-place alongside Cho Yoon-ji at eight-under.
