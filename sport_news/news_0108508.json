Here are 5 things to know about the game .\nLSU VS. SOUTH CAROLINA BREAKDOWN\nWHEN: 2:30 p.m. CT Saturday\nWHERE: Tiger Stadium (102,321)\n RECORDS: LSU 4-0, 2-0 in SEC; South Carolina, 2-3, 0-3 in SEC.\nRANKINGS: LSU is ranked No. 7 in the AP poll; No. 5 in the Amway coaches poll. South Carolina is not ranked.\nCOACHES: LSU, Les Miles, 107-29/11 th season at LSU, 134-50 overall; South Carolina, Steve Spurrier, 86-48 , 11th year at South Carolina; 228-88, 26 th season overall.\nTV: ESPN\nREPLAY: SEC Network, Tuesday, 8 p.m., Wednesday, 2 a.m.; Thursday, 9 a.m. All times central.\nRADIO: WWL-870/105.3 (New Orleans), 98.1 (Baton Rouge), Sirius ch. 83, XM ch. 190\nONLINE & TWITTER: NOLA.com/LSU, @JimKleinpeter, @RandyRosetta, @RonHigg, @JeritRoser, @JeffDuncan_\nLAST MEETING/SERIES RECORD: LSU has won the last five meetings, the latest a 23-21 victory in 2012. LSU leads the series 17-2-1 and is 5-1-1 vs. the Gamecocks since they joined the SEC in 1992.\nINJURIES (as of Tuesday)\nLSU: S Jalen Mills (leg) questionable; TE Dillon Gordon (Achilles) questionable; DE Tashawn Bower (ankle) probable.\nSouth Carolina : QB Lorenzo Nunez (shoulder) probable; OG Zack Bailey (undisclosed) questionable; WR Deebo Samuel (hamstring) questionable; WR Carlton Heard (lip) questionable; TE Connor Redmond (back) questionable; QB Connor Mitch (knee) out; WR Jerad Wahsington (leg) out.\nWHO HAS THE EDGE?\nQUARTERBACK: I remember saying LSU would not have the advantage here most of the year and the opposite has been true. South Carolina is the third straight opponent with a quarterback who wasn't the starter when the season opened. LSU is 14th and last in passing offense in the SEC and South Carolina is 12 th . In passing efficiency, the Gamecocks are rock bottom. Freshman Lorenzo Nunez comes in banged up, having missed Tuesday and Wednesday practices with a sprained shoulder. He's 31 of 51 but threw three interceptions last week. Former walk-on Perry Orth will start if Nunez can't go. Brandon Harris is not getting much help from receivers but he took a step back last week. His interception actually should have been ruled a fumble. If his WRs show some improvement the choice here is easy. Advantage: LSU\nRUNNING BACKS: This stat says it all: Nunez, who has played in four games, is the team's leading rusher. Brandon Wilds has 181 yards and a 5.2 average but has missed the last two games with a rib injury. His return would be a huge boost since Gamecock tailbacks rushed for 45 yards last week. Shon Carson has big play ability. He had a 48-yard TD run vs. North Carolina for the game-winning points. LSU has you-know-who, Leonard Fournette, who could crash the 1,000-yard barrier in his fifth game. Darrel Williams could probably start for sever SEC schools and has provided solid backup play. Derrius Guice and Nick Brossette continue to improve and make LSU the best running team in the conference. Advantage: LSU\nOFFENSIVE LINE: South Carolina is dealing with lots of injuries here, players in and out of the lineup and shuffling around to different positions. The good news is that C Alan Knott is healthy and should return to the starting lineup. LSU is playing well here. Fournette is getting 3-5 yards before being touched by an opposing defender most of the time. The group has also done well with pre-snap penalties, the only bad game coming at Syracuse where the noise in the Carrier Dome proved problematic. LSU has shown a propensity to run left behind Jerald Hawkins and Maea Tuehema on Fournette's big plays with RG Will Clapp pulling and leading the way. Advantage: LSU\nWIDE RECEIVERS/TIGHT ENDS : . Advantage: South Carolina will have the best wide receiver on the field in Pharoh Cooper, who is sixth in the SEC with 26 catches for 322 yards. He's hasn't been a big play threat with a 12.4 average and a long play of 35 yards. Tight end Jerrel Adams is another threat who has caught 12 balls and has five career touchdown catches. Carlton Heard has five catches to lead the rest. This area has been a problem for LSU which is loaded with talent based on recruiting but has not lived up to the hype. Travin Dural had an ugly drop last week and Malachi Dupre hasn't been making plays. Les Miles threatened to shake up the order earlier in the week so there could be some new faces in the lineup. Advantage: South Carolina\nDEFENSIVE LINE: LSU is gaining strength here after starting the season with major depth questions. Sione Teuhema had seven tackles last week, a good sign, and the backup tackles Greg Gilmore and Frank Herron have continued to improve. DE Arden Key forced an interception with pressure last week. This group should get starting DE Tashawn Bower back and Lewis Neal makes it a strong dup with DTs Christian LaCouture and Davon Godchaux. South Carolina has nine sacks, all by defensive linemen, but the Gamecocks couldn't get much of a rush last week. Cedrick Cooper had a safety taken away on a questionable official's call. The Gamecocks are getting pounded on the groun to the tune of 170 yards per game and 4.9 per carry. Advantage: LSU\nLINEBACKERS: Another place where depth is an issue, LSU has to keep Deion Jones and Kendell Beckwith healthy. They play as a twosome for most snaps because of nickel and dime coverage packages. And they're the Tigers top two tacklers. Duke Riley had a busted coverage that helped set up a TD last week. Skai Moore and T.J.Holloman are likewise the heart of South Carolina's unit. Moore has three picks and three passes broken up while leading the team with 52 tackles, and Holloman two interceptions. South Carolina like LSU plays most of the time with two linebackers but will probably go to strongside linebacker Larenz Bryant more with Leonard Fournette on the menu. Advantage: Even\nSECONDARY: LSU continues to boast perhaps the best secondary in the nation. CB Tre'Davious White continues to dominate as evidenced by the fact that few passes come in his direction. Freshman CB Kevin Toliver is as good as advertised and responds well when teams try to pick on him. He's going to be better than White eventually. The Tigers haven't missed S Jalen Mills but he could return for a few snaps this week. Rickey Jefferson and Jamal Adams bring the wood when it comes to tackling and Adams has two picks. South Carolina has six interceptions but only one by a member of this group. The Gamecocks allow 218 yards passing per game, third-to-last in the SEC. LSU's passing game could get healthy this week. Advantage: LSU\nSPECIAL TEAMS: LSU kickoff coverage team struggled again last week but nothing worse than a 37-yard return.. The punt coverage had two chances and will only be as good as Jamie Keehn, who did better in his two tries, but shanks could be lurking. Trent Domingue appears to be the answer as the field goal kicker. He's 6-for-6 and made a 45-yarder . South Carolina is a middle of the pack team in every category but Pharoh Cooper is a dangerous guy on punt returns if Keehn starts to struggle with hang time. . Gamecock punter Sean Kelley is solid with a 41.9 average and 11 of his 21 kicks being down inside the 20. Elliott Fry is 10 for 14 with all of his misses coming from beyond 40 yards, three of those beyond 50. Advantage: South Carolina\nINTANGIBLES: If South Carolina was asking if the season could get any worse after last week's loss to Missouri, the answer was a double whammy: yes, it rained and flooded and one of the home games got moved to the opposition's site. It was already going to be a difficult job to beat LSU and now the setting is so one-sided Las Vegas won't touch it. LSU is going to be nice and play Gamecock fight songs and the alma mater. But LSU, even without a full stadium, is playing a beaten down team that will have trouble staying focused with the tragedy back home. Advantage: LSU\nPREDICTION\nSteve Spurrier is a frustrated, 70-year-old coaching legend who may have to start asking himself 'Why go on?' He had a nice run with some good talent but in these last two seasons hasn't been able to recapture the magic that led to three consecutive 11-2 finishes. If the Gamecocks have any resolve left, this is where they've got to show it. Hopefully they can return to Williams-Brice Stadium next week to play Vanderbilt but after that they have unbeaten Florida, Texas A&M and Clemson among the last six games. LSU's season seems to be breaking good. This impromptu home game is a welcomed gift and means they will go 42 days between road game. It could get ugly early and allow the tigers to rest the troops for the final six game haul, like they were supposed to do last week.\nLSU 42, South Carolina 10", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T15:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T23:49:16.553+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
