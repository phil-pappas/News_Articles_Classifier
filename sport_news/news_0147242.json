We know this: That we're going to play with a lot of passion and a lot of intensity. We're going to be a team that's disciplined, a team that's focused and a team that just really enjoys playing.\"\nStrong on whose fault the 1-4 start is on\n\"I never, will ever say it was Coach Brown's fault, and it wasn't his fault. It is on me. You look at it, we have the players. It's about us coaching. It has nothing to do with the last staff. They're no longer here. It's about what we have, and now it's about us working and let's get them better. Never once was it ever on coach. It's on us and it's on our staff. It's on me as a head football coach.\"\nStrong on how his expectations changed after loss to TCU\n\"I don't think we're far away at all. But we just didn't have them prepared to play as a coach. And we know we can do better ourselves and be more focused. But that team there Saturday, I know this, we're a better football team than that, without a doubt. We're a way better football team than that.\"\nStrong on if the defensive issues bother him\n\"Everything starts with defense. As with any team, you've got to play through great defense, because you have no chance if you don't play great defense, and right now we're not.\"\nStrong on Saturday's team meeting\n\"Well, the meeting I called Saturday was after the game when the plane landed. When we got back here on Saturday we had a team meeting. There were just some things that needed to be discussed and then we had another team meeting yesterday. But Saturday I was not going to let us leave here until we got some things straight.\"\nStrong on if he worries about making it to year three\n\"Every day is a battle, so I don't (worry). I have no idea. Every day I come in knowing that it's my job to come in and make sure that this program is doing -- is represented the right way and doing the right things and going to win football games and developing young men. That's each and every day\"\nJunior safety Dylan Haines on the freshmen\n\"(The freshman) just want to go and play, I think that's with any freshman\" Haines said. \"A lot of [the freshman didn't] have to watch film in high school if you're recruited at that level. You don't have to go out there and put in extra work ... They just want to out and play on Saturday. They don't want to put in the work on Sunday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday. We go out there and practice but you can just go through the motions in practice or you can practice.\"\nSenior cornerback Duke Thomas on the use of social media\n\"[The freshmen] don't really understand the effect they have of being here in the position they're in,\" Thomas said. \"We just got to teach them and let them know a lot of things they do or have done isn't acceptable.\"\nOn Twitter:\n @Nick_Castillo74", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/Nick_Castillo74"], "published": "2015-10-06T02:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T13:46:44.677+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
