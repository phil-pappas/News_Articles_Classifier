Stephen D. Cannerelli | scannerelli@syracuse.com Can the Syracuse defense bounce back? \nOK, look at the size of that hole. Syracuse is coming off its worst defensive effort of the season and is facing a Virginia team with some talented skill players but a banged up offensive line. We know SU loves to pressure the quarterback. If it can't circumvent this patchwork O-line, yeesh. Stephen D. Cannerelli | scannerelli@syracuse.com Young talent has a chance to grow up with road win \nSince we'll be in Virginia, here's a quote from Thomas Jefferson: \"I like the dreams of the future better than the history of the past.\" Syracuse is getting a large chunk of production from freshmen and sophomores, leading the program to hold optimism that the next few years can spark something it's calling an orange revolution, its new marketing buzzword. A lot of those young players will be on the field Saturday. Can they pull off the road win? Stephen D. Cannerelli | scannerelli@syracuse.com Kielan Whitner and the secondary \nWith safety Rodney Williams listed as doubtful, expect to see more of Chauncey Scissum and true freshman Kielan Whitner. The freshman committed a costly penalty last week at South Florida, but there should be plenty of chances to atone for that this week. As for the rest of the secondary, it faces a passing attack that can hurt it over the top with proper protection. Good test before Tyler Boyd next week. Stephen D. Cannerelli | scannerelli@syracuse.com Eric Dungey playing it safe \nThe narrative of the week surrounding the true freshman quarterback was that he needs to make better decisions , specifically when it comes to throwing the ball away or avoiding taking unnecessary big hits. He might be sick of hearing about it by now. And, frankly, it might be easier said than done when you're in the heat of the moment and instincts tend to take over. Stephen D.
