In November 2013, the humane society recovered 118 dogs, 21 horses and one cat found living in squalor at a breeding facility she owned.\n\"We think this jury verdict sends a very strong message that animal neglect will not be tolerated in Oregon,\" said David Lytle, a spokesperson for Oregon Humane Society.\nThe judge ordered Setere to pay a $2,000 compensatory fine for each of the 43 counts, which prosecutor Jake Kamins said will help offset the costs incurred by the humane society in caring for the animals and pursuing the case. If that isn't paid, Setere will be ordered to pay another $86,000 to the court.\n\"The sentencing was appropriate given the nature of Ms. Setere's conduct,\" Setere's attorney, Rachel Bridges, told The Oregonian/OregonLive. \"She really did not comprehend that she wasn't caring for them adequately.\"\nSetere began breeding animals about 40 years ago, Bridges said. Over the last few years, her emotional state deteriorated. Setere acknowledged in court that she was \"overwhelmed by the number of animals and knew she had reduce the number,\" Bridges said.\nNearly all the animals seized from Setere's custody have been adopted through the humane society, Lytle said. Eleven dogs and one horse remain.\nâ€” Nuran Alteir\nnalteir@oregonian.com\n503-294-4028\n@whatnuransaid", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/whatnuransaid"], "published": "2015-10-23T02:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T06:02:51.514+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
