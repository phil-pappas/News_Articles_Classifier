The Bison out-gained the Bulldogs 309-295 but Southwestern set up its first touchdown on a 61-yard kickoff return by Trevon Hartfiel, blocked a punt for touchdown, got a 69-yard punt return for touchdown by D.J. Jones and had a Conner Bays interception return of 41 yards. “We can’t give up big plays or touchdowns on special teams,” said OBU Coach Chris Jensen. “They found a way to make big plays and that was the difference in the game. We have to learn from our mistakes and keep moving forward.” The Bison trailed 21-0 before scoring a late second-half touchdown. The 78-yard drive included a 17-yard run by Jake Ellis and Dez Stegall passes to Stephan Turner for gains of 15 and 26 yards, the latter taking the Bison to the SWOSU 6. Isaiah Mallory leapt over the line for the score with 30 seconds remaining the half. Trey Tully added the PAT to make it 21-7. OBU was down 28-7 before getting a five-play, 75-yard drive, highlighted by Cooper Koons’ 44-yard rush after lining up to punt and fielding a low snap. One play later, Stegall weaved his way through the Southwestern defense for a 25-yard touchdown run. Ellis led the Bison in rushing with 54 yards on 13 carries with Stegall and Koons just behind with 45 and 44 yards each. Stegall was 16 for 28 passing for 163 yards, including nine completions to Turner for 78 yards. Leading the defense for the Bison were Zach Bishop and Brynden Pitzer with 13 and 12 tackles, respectively. Pitzer and Ed Morgan Jr. had one sack each. Levin Jennings had two tackles for loss. Pitzer also forced a fumble, which was recovered by Bishop. Now 2-6 on the season, the Bison play at Ouachita BaptistSaturday. Kickoff is at 1 p.m. The Shawnee News-Star Posted Oct. 24, 2015 at 12:01 AM Updated at 11:33 PM", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T06:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T09:49:27.283+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
