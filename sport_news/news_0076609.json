By Tim May The Columbus Dispatch • Tuesday October 20, 2015 10:04 PM \nJ.T. Barrett is back as Ohio State’s starting quarterback as it prepares for a game Saturday at Rutgers, and coach Urban Meyer said Tuesday that the rationale came down to the bottom line. \n“Just sheer production,” Meyer said. \nCardale Jones, a fourth-year junior, took over when Barrett was injured last season in the Michigan game. He led the Buckeyes to three postseason victories and the first College Football Playoff national championship. Jones then started the first seven games this season with Barrett healthy, but the magic of that postseason run has rarely been seen. \n>> Get the most out of your Ohio State experience, follow @BuckeyeXtra on Twitter \nAfter watching the offense mostly struggle in a 34-27 victory at Indiana three weeks ago — with Jones playing the entire game — Meyer started using Barrett when the Buckeyes got inside the 20-yard line. Since then, they have gone 12 of 12 in the red zone, with 11 touchdowns and one field goal, using Barrett 11 of those times. \nIt was obvious last week as the game developed against Penn State that Barrett’s running ability and deft operation of the option with running back Ezekiel Elliott was the difference-maker in a 38-10 victory. Barrett entered the game for good late in the third quarter. \n“It was a difficult decision, but the red-zone production and the third-down production were the two areas that made the difference,” Meyer said. “J.T. has earned the right to start Saturday at Rutgers.” \nESPN college football analyst Kirk Herbstreit said anyone could see the difference. \n“I’ve watched these guys take every snap for two years, and while I think Cardale is a very physically gifted quarterback who had those last three games of last year that were on everybody’s mind, to me the heart and soul of that football team is J.T. Barrett,” he said. \n“Plus, I think the offense just fits his skill set better, and I think his running ability opens up even more opportunities for Zeke Elliott with that read play, a staple of the Urban Meyer offense, and it opens up more play-action passing opportunities with Mike Thomas, Jalin Marshall and Braxton Miller.” \nRutgers coach Kyle Flood said he has seen similar things as he has studied Ohio State. He also has memories of Barrett passing for 261 yards and three touchdowns and running for 107 yards and two scores in the Buckeyes’ 56-17 victory over the Scarlet Knights last season. \nIt was one of several outstanding performances for Barrett, who set 17 Ohio State records — including 45 touchdowns responsible for, also a Big Ten record — and finishing fifth in voting for the Heisman Trophy. \n“He’s a dynamic athlete, someone who can score from anywhere on the field,” Flood said. “And you have to pay so much attention to him in the run game that it creates one-on-ones at other points on the field. That’s the philosophy of their offense and what makes them really tough to defend.” \nMeyer knows that, but he also knows that Barrett, a third-year sophomore, had a chance to retake the job earlier this season. In playing the last three quarters of a 20-13 victory over Northern Illinois after he replaced a struggling Jones, Barrett did not have that same zing. But it returned the past two weeks. \nWhen Meyer was asked whether the decision puts him at peace, he said, “Not necessarily. We have two great guys I have a tremendous amount of respect for, and I’m just trying to do the right thing.” \nHerbstreit believes the switch will prove to be monumental. \n“I honestly think they we will look back at this decision, for a team that’s been sputtering somewhat — I think this will be the turning point to the entire season,” Herbstreit said. “It’s not just because I think J.T. Barrett impacts the offense. I think J.T. Barrett impacts the team.” \ntmay@dispatch.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T04:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T05:27:29.282+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
