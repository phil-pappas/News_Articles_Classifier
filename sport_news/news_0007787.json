But the Liga champions responded well, with Suarez finding the net three times to turn around the scoreline. \nDespite the final outcome, however, Barcelona are still evidently missing the injured Lionel Messi and Andres Iniesta - failing to keep a clean sheet for the seventh successive Liga game. The centre-back pairing of Gerard Pique and Marc Bartra will face further scrutiny after their display, as will the discipline of Javier Mascherano - who was shown a late red card. \nThe result takes Barcelona level on points with rivals Real Madrid, who saw off Celta Vigo in impressive style on Saturday. Enrique has his injury problems at present, but his programme of damage limitation seems to be working reasonably well for now. \n- \nFollow Joy Sports on Twitter: @Joy997FM.
