I guess everybody's different. Just depends from your character or your approach to tennis and generally to everyday commitments,\" he said.\n\"I thought I should always try to improve in every possible occasion. Every time I'm on the court I see things I can be better on. That's one of the reasons that I keep on getting that motivation to move on.\n\"Today was a great match. Obviously the fact that he served that high of a first percentage of serves in and I managed to break him twice says enough about the quality of the return that I had today. That was the key to win the match.\"\nNext up for the seemingly unstoppable Serb, who won three out of four Grand Slam finals this year to reach 10 major titles, is Spain's David Ferrer, who beat Taiwanese wildcard Lu Yen-hsun 6-3, 6-1.\nIn the women's draw, Ana Ivanovic beat Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova 6-3, 7-5 to set up a semi-final with Timea Bacsinszky, who recovered from a first-set 'bagel' to beat Sara Errani 0-6, 6-3, 7-5.\nAgnieszka Radwanska beat Angelique Kerber 6-1, 6-4 to go into a semi-final clash with the in-form Garbine Muguruza, who halted the run of American qualifier Bethanie Mattek-Sands 6-1, 7-5.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T09:45:31.184+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
