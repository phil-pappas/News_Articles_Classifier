(AP) - Seeking new ways to clamp down on drug abuse, three Republican lawmakers are proposing the creation of a registry system for New Hampshire drug dealers, similar to the sex offender registry.\nNew Hampshire is facing a growing heroin and prescription drug abuse problem, with more than 320 citizens dying from overdoses in 2014. The lawmakers proposing these bills say a registry would act as a deterrent and allow the public to know who the drug dealers are in their communities.\nBut several outside organizations, including the American Civil Liberties Union, say creating such a registry is unnecessary and unfair to people who have already served time for their crimes.\nThe bills will go through the public hearing process when the Legislature reconvenes in January.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T07:53:17.304+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
