I was impressed with their resilience,\" said Sages coach Cully Welter, whose team climbed to 8-1 on the season. Monticello senior quarterback Brandon Wildman entered the game with nearly 2,000 yards passing. Wildman, however, was hobbled with an injury and played about half of the game and rotated with backup QB Caleb Hanson. Wildman finished the night with 11-of-19 accuracy for 165 yards. Hanson, meanwhile, was 6-of-11 for 116 yards in the air. Jacob Burton did the most damage, though, at runningback with four touchdowns â€” 7, 13, 4 and 3. The Titans, which ended the season at 4-5, started out the game with the momentum. M-R senior Cody Stokes blocked a punt with 10:42 left in the first quarter. The Titans offense, however, could not punch it in from only 13 yards out. Welter added, \"The (Monticello) did a great job of making a stand after the blocked punt.\" The Titans trailed only 22-8 at halftime despite three fumbles. M-R sophomore Brady Morefield provided the scoring for M-R with his first TD of the season, an 11-yard touchdown catch from freshman quarterback Carter Bell. Charlie Bertelsen later added a third quarter touchdown on a 67-yard run when he broke loose from a big pile at the line of scrimmage. The final score of the night for M-R also came in the third quarter when Tommy Simpson found paydirt from 3 yards out. Bell closed out his freshman season at quarterback with 11-of-29 accuracy for 83 yards. Bertelsen finished with 13 carries for 93 yards and fullback Wesley Burris had 13 carries for 51 yards rushing. Titans offensive coordinator Danny Morrison, who worked with the freshman signal caller the entire season, took some time to talk about coaching the talented Bell. Morrison, during his playing days at Monmouth College, played wide receiver for Carter's dad Steve. \"Tremendous. He's a really good talent,\" Morrison said, about Carter. \"He's a smart kid, a good athlete and a really good quarterback. It was fun. I saw him as a little kid and now I got to coach him.\" By Jeff Holt", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T16:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T00:07:40.719+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
