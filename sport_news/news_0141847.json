(AP) - A vehicle crashed into a crowd of spectators Saturday during the Oklahoma State University homecoming parade, killing at least three people and injuring nearly two dozen others, police said. \nStillwater police Capt. Kyle Gibbs told The Associated Press that three people were killed and 22 were injured in the crash Saturday morning. He had no further comment prior to a news conference about the incident. \nDave Kapple of Houston told the Stillwater News Press that he and his son were about 10 feet away when they saw the vehicle barreling into the crowd. \n“We heard somebody scream, ‘Look out!.’ (He) plowed through a police motorcycle, and then a crowd of people,” Kapple said. “People were flying everywhere.” \nKonda Walker, from Anchorage, Alaska, was attending the festivities ahead of the homecoming game between Oklahoma State and Kansas. \n“At first we thought it was part of the show,” Walker told the News Press. “People were flying 30 feet into the air like rag dolls.” \nPhone calls to Oklahoma State officials were not immediately returned. \nThe university posted on Twitter: “Oklahoma State University is saddened by the tragic parade incident earlier this morning. Our thoughts & prayers are with those affected.” \nCopyright © 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T20:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T21:45:58.806+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
