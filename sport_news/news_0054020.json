It would just take a few games to know their names.\nIt turns out a lot of the stars will be on defense.\nThe Longhorns, always loaded with lightning on offense, showed off a thunderous defense Friday night in a 20-10 win over Skyline. Cedar Hill forced four punts, stopped Skyline three times on fourth down and recovered two fumbles.\n\"We talk about the turnovers all the time,\" McGuire said. \"Three is our goal.\"\nCedar Hill (3-0), the No. 3 team in the area 6A rankings, got two turnovers against No. 4 Skyline (2-1), and they came at huge moments in the game. The first came after Skyline had trimmed Cedar Hill's lead to 13-10 with a touchdown drive on the first possession of the second half.\nSkyline's LeDarryl Randolph made a nice run into Cedar Hill territory on a first down, but linebacker Greg Jackson stripped the ball from him and recovered the fumble. Cedar Hill's offense responded with its final touchdown drive, capped by quarterback Avery Davis' 11-yard run that made it 20-10.\nThe second big defensive play came when Skyline had a second-and-goal at the 3-yard line with five minutes left. Randolph, who was Skyline's best running threat with 14 carries for 121 yards, was stripped of the ball again and Cedar Hill linebacker Robert Thomas scooped it up and ran for what would've been a touchdown had there not been an illegal block.\n\"We just stayed focused,\" Thomas said. \"We stayed together, even when things got tough, and made plays.\"\nCedar Hill's offense made some plays, too, but it struggled to keep Skyline's defensive front, led by 6-1, 310-pound defensive tackle Joseph Wallace, out of the backfield.\nMcGuire said that Skyline's defensive front is one of the best he's ever seen, and he knew it would be tough for his young offensive line.\n\"Our offensive line has five guys who've just made three varsity starts,\" McGuire said. \"As they grow up, we'll get better.\"\nSkyline's defensive front blew up a lot of plays, but when the Longhorns' backs got loose, they made big gains. Seven of their first-half runs were for 10 yards or more, including Davis' 33-yard touchdown run that gave Cedar Hill a 13-3 lead early in the second quarter.\nOn the touchdown run, Davis spun out of a tackle just past the line of scrimmage and raced down the left sideline to the end zone. It was one of his best runs of the night, which also included completing 12 of 20 passes for 79 yards.\n\"The thing about Avery is that he's a true dual threat,\" McGuire said. \"He's the total package.\"\nFollow Matt Wixon on Twitter @mattwixon.\nOn Twitter:\n @mattwixon", "external_links": ["http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/high-school/football/game/2015/21653", "https://twitter.com/mattwixon"], "published": "2015-09-12T07:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T03:40:24.777+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
