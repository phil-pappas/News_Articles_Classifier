While the Cavaliers (3-1 in the conference) missed their chance to move into first place last week with a 48-7 loss to the Greyhounds, wins in their final two league games would at least keep them in contention.

(Katherine Dunn/Baltimore Sun video) See more videos \nThe Eagles (2-1), on the other hand, control their own destiny, and could claim a conference title with wins in each of their final three games, including a Nov. 7 home meeting with Gilman. While the two teams shared the title last season, the league rules now have been adjusted to break ties through head-to-head matchups. \n\"I've been telling our kids for the past two weeks that we're in playoff mode,\" McDonogh coach Dom Damico said. \"You can't have two losses. We're just telling the kids, `We have two more games before we have to play for the championship. If you want the right to play in the championship game against Gilman … then we need to take care of business the next two weeks.' Hopefully we'll get a playoff-like effort.\" \nThat would start with another big day from running back Mylique McGriff, who gained 1,275 yards a year ago but has been slowed this season after suffering a concussion that forced him to miss the Eagles game against Mount Saint Joseph — its lone conference loss. \nDamico wants his team to focus on run-blocking and controlling the line of scrimmage \n\"[The Cavaliers] play a three-man front, and all three of those kids are very aggressive,\" Damico said. \"I would like to see our team just improve a little bit in our run blocking. If we can block their three down guys, that would make me happy, and I think we'd be making some progress toward becoming a better offensive team.\" \nWhile McDonogh is looking for improvement, Spalding is also looking for a bit of redemption following last week's blowout loss to Gilman. In that game, the Cavaliers gave up 42 points in the first half after having allowed just 41 in their previous five games. \n\"We don't think Gilman is 41 points better than us,\" Spalding coach Kyle Schmitt said. \"We were really disappointed, starting with me, right down to the kids. I told the kids, `That's the beauty of sports, the ability to bounce back a week later.' And I wouldn't want to play anyone else but the other perceived power in the league. It's a great opportunity for us.\" \nThe Cavaliers are led by dual-threat quarterback Evan Fochtman (1,422 yards passing with 19 touchdowns, 564 yards rushing with nine touchdowns) and running back Josh Chase (926 yards rushing, five touchdowns). \nTo have a chance to win, Schmitt said his team needs to do a better job of stopping the run, play at a faster overall pace and get off to a quicker start than last week, when a pair of first-quarter interceptions spelled disaster. \n\"I put too much on Evan's plate last week, and that was my fault as a head coach,\" Schmitt said. \"We want to kind of get back to who we are this week. We like to run the football … and take our shots downfield. When we put ourselves in situations where it's second-and-5, our whole playbook is open.\" \nMcDonogh has won three of the past four games in the series, including each of the past two years. For Spalding, however, this one will be critical. \n\"If we want to be alive on Nov. 7, that last weekend of the season, we have to win Friday night,\" Schmitt said. \nOTHER GAMES TO WATCH \nNo. 12 Mervo at Edmondson, Friday, 3 p.m. \nFriendship Academy at No. 1 Gilman, Friday, 3:30 p.m. \nNo. 10 Broadneck at No. 2 Old Mill, Friday, 6:30 \nNo. 11 Annapolis at Chesapeake-AA, Friday, 6:30 p.m. \nNew Town vs. No. 9 Eastern Tech at CCBC-Essex, Friday, 7 p.m.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T23:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T21:16:35.410+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
