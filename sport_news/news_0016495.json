(Nikki Boertman/The Commercial Appeal) He is on his sixth NBA team in eight years.\nBut Grizzlies power forward/center Brandan Wright feels as though he is just getting started.\n\"There are a lot of guys in my position who just fade away,\" Wright said. \"You have to keep working hard. I'm in a good situation here.\"\nThe Griz certainly have big plans for Wright.\nA cerebral player with a 7-foot-4 wingspan and 36-inch vertical leap, Wright arrived as a free-agent signee during the offseason, with the promise of giving the Griz a frontcourt boost.\nGriz coaches are confident that Wright brings everything needed in a backup big man. His ability to protect the rim and operate proficiently in pick-and-rolls should allow Memphis to maintain its identity on both ends of the floor while infusing a dynamic force off the bench.\n\"I love his game,\" center Marc Gasol said. \"I understand the ways he plays and I like the way he plays. He's going to help us a lot.\"\nWright's past four seasons have illustrated the projections that came with being a No. 8 overall pick in 2007. Through his relentless and explosive rim rolls, Wright opens up the court for teammates by drawing help defenders.\nHe is a selective shooter, explosive above the rim and efficient in pick-and-rolls. Wright is working on a four-year run of better than 60-percent shooting because of how well he rolls off screens and cuts off the ball.\nWright's offensive skills have Griz coach Dave Joerger salivating at the possibilities, including using Wright next to Gasol on the front line.\n\"Brandan knows he's not a clogger. He's a runner, an energy guy,\" Joerger said. \"Marc will be ahead of him and you'll still see Brandan get down to the first block or get into a pick-and-roll. We talk about Mike (Conley) being our primary ballhandler and playmaker. Marc is our other one. Playing with Brandan out of pick-and-rolls with Marc is a lot different than you see around the league. But it's certainly effective for us. It's just a different look.\"\nNearly three-quarters of Wright's shots last year came at the rim. Wright was shooting 75 percent from the field last season before Dallas traded him to Boston to acquire point guard Rajon Rondo.\nWhenever Gasol and Conley need rest, Wright and Beno Udrih or Vince Carter could form a lethal pick-and-roll duo in their place.\n\"I'm been integrating my skills into the team just fine,\" Wright said about training camp with the Griz. \"It hasn't been difficult.\"\nDefensively, there is a notion that Wright can't bang with NBA centers. However, Wright has earned respect on one of the league's top defensive squads.\n\"He's better defensively than what I thought,\" Gasol said. \"I'm excited. He's very active. His second jump is impressive. Once you bang and bang him to create space, he's so long and athletic that he can recover.\"\nWright had an impressive stretch of games last season in early March, which included a 16-point, eight-rebound, seven-block effort. Even Wright suggests that his versatility and all-around ability can be underrated.\n\"I can block shots or use my athleticism to alter shots,\" Wright said. \"That's an underrated stat for big guys. It starts on the defensive end because you can control that and then your offense comes off your defense. I can be free and roam around and use my athleticism to block shots and get steals because I know Marc is behind me. I've never played with a guy like that standing behind me.\"\nThe Griz haven't had a player like Wright, either. Ed Davis, who was acquired in the Rudy Gay trade with Toronto, was supposed to have the qualities that Wright brings.\nDavis had an underwhelming 1&frac12; seasons with the Griz.\nThere is a mutual and strong belief that Wright is a long-term fit.\n\"It's not hard to play off of great players,\" Wright said. \"(The transition) is going well. I'm ready to help this team win big.\"", "external_links": ["http://media.jrn.com/images/200*298/847975.jpg", "http://media.jrn.com/images/847975.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-16T02:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T11:37:26.198+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
