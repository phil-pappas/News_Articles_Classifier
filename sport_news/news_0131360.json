PETERSBURG, FLA. - \nBlue Jays general manager Alex Anthopoulos talked reluctantly to reporters Saturday about his contract status with the club, but was unable to shed any further light in his future. \n\n\"I've tried to just kind of stay away from that,\" said Anthopoulos, whose contract with the Jays expires at the end of this season. \n\"You guys know me. I never wanted my contractual circumstances to be out there to begin with. They got out last summer. But prior to that, I never felt it was important. At the same time, for me, I just don't think it should be a story, a topic. These guys on the field are what we're doing. We won the AL East for the first time in a long time, we've got guys vying for Cy Youngs and MVPs and home field. I just think it's irrelevant, to be honest with you.\" \nIncoming president Mark Shapiro, still with the Cleveland Indians, has let it be known he wants Anthopoulos back, but Shapiro doesn't take over until Nov. 1. \n\"The way that's been done, I've been respecting the process,\" said Anthopoulos. \"Things were done in Cleveland and here and I think everyone's kind of agreed. I'm following everyone else's lead that once Nov. 1 first hits I think Mark's going to be able to speak freely about things. But I think we're just following ownership's lead from the Indians' standpoint and the Blue Jays' standpoint, they made their comments and I think that was going to be the end of it. I'm not going to go against what they've set up.\" \nMUM'S THE WORD \nThe Blue Jays management, scouting and development team met Saturday to mull over their playoff roster options but they will keep their ideas to themselves until later this week. The Jays don't have to declare a final roster for the division series until Thursday. \n\"I don't think there's anything that stands out,\" Anthopoulos said. \"We have the bulk of it set, just some areas, bench, the last few spots in the pen, things like that. Just preliminary. We need to know who we're going to play. We'll meet again, I believe, on Wednesday. We'll have more information at that time. \nDepending upon who Toronto's opponent is going to be, a couple of final decisions might change. \n\"It'll definitely have some influence. Again, it wasn't a long meeting today. It was just more of a get-together as a group. We didn't delve much into other teams. We're prepared. We've been scouting them. We've got all the information internally. But for the most part, certain guys are set regardless of who we play, so it's not that long a meeting. We're not talking about 25 guys. We're probably going to have a conversation about 5-10, tops. \nThe composition of the bullpen will dictate how deep John Gibbons' bench will be. \n\"A seven-man bullpen is what we discussed today,\" Anthopoulos said. \"That could change.\" \nNO BLINDSIDE \nAnthopoulos is aware that winning a division title hasn't always been a route to postseason success. Often, teams have used the wild card victory as a springboard to greater things. Witness last year's Kansas City Royals and San Francisco Giants who both made the playoffs as wild card teams and went on to win league titles. \nHe sees a level of resilience in this Blue Jay team that will prevent them from being stale or unprepared. \n\"This group, their mindset, even throughout the last two months, every time we lost a game from the first of August, I was always curious how we were going to recover the next day,\" he said. \"There was a part of me, to be honest, saying is this where we're going to lose three, four, five in a row? Is it starting now? Just to see the attitudes and how these guys respond the next day, I don't have any concerns with this group. And that's not ability wise, what they're going to do on the field, just their mentality and the way they approach things. They're outstanding.\" Sponsored Links", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T06:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T06:34:03.398+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
