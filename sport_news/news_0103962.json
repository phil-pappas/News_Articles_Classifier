We must continue the efforts to improve the spectacle of elite football and, at the same time, reduce the inequalities for the benefit of everyone.\n\"Above all we need to save FIFA and its role of governance and redistribution, which is in danger at a time when they are needed the most. We must also restore FIFA's credibility, and prepare it for the challenges of an ever evolving world.\"\nChampagne has pledged to introduce \"the highest standards of transparency and ethics\" within world football's governing body, while strengthening the development and academy systems within the sport and elevating the status of women's soccer.\nHe has also called for three televised public debates in the build-up to the elections next February, in order to create \"a true and open debate on the future of FIFA and through that on the future of football.\"\nChampagne's eight-point plan also suggests changes to football's disciplinary system, including the introduction of an \"orange card\" for temporary dismissals and modifications to the \"triple punishment\" of a red card, penalty and ensuing suspension for a last-man foul.\nThe former director of international reputations left FIFA in 2010, before taking up active roles in sport in Palestine and Kosovo.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "http://www.goal.com/en-us"], "published": "2015-10-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T02:49:50.067+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
