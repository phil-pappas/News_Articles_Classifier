He had a 9-under 207 total.\n\"I thought I had a good round in me,\" Lardon said. \"I didn't' play well back in 2012 when I came here (for the PGA Professional Championship). Today, I played well for the first 12 today, and made some nice saves coming in. The course fits my eye.\"\nJim Carter of Scottsdale, Arizona; James Mason of Dillard, Georgia; and John Dal Corobbo of Speedway, Indiana, were a stroke back. Carter and Dal Corobbo shot 69, and Mason had a 71.\nThe top 35 finishers Sunday will earn spots in the Senior PGA Championship in May at Harbor Shores in Benton Harbor, Michigan.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T21:06:42.571+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
