Victory would also bring the state playoffs onto the horizon -- which in itself is a big reward for two programs looking to turn around recent history. The Tigers, still learning in their first season under coach Sid Maxwell, have not reached the postseason since 2012 and are coming off a 2-8 mark in 2014. \n( You can also click here for a look at all of the games scheduled for Week 9 .) \n“If you get to this point of the season and you’re playing for something you’re blessed to have that opportunity. Now how you seize that opportunity is what you try to get your team ready to do. And it’s much better to be in this position than playing for pride,” Maxwell said. “And we came here to Dawson County trying to turn things around so every game means something.” \nThe Leopards, meanwhile, are trying to get back into the state bracket for the first time since 2011 after coming within a game of doing so last season. Now in his third campaign with Banks County, coach Biff Parson believes his program is gaining traction. \n“When I took this job three years ago, I shared with the guys that are seniors now that we’re going to be in the playoffs. And the vision is that we’re going to turn this ship around. And we’re going to be competitive, and we’re going to be one of those teams that they say, ‘they’re probably going to be in the playoffs every year.’ Have we been there yet? No, because we haven’t been in the playoffs. But we’re scratching the surface, and it’s part of these guys buying in to what this coaching staff has been selling them,” Parson said. “It is exciting for the potential of getting into the playoffs. And now it’s who’s got the best match-ups. Nothing’s guaranteed. We’ve got to earn it. We need to win two, maybe three more -- you never know how this thing’s going to shape up with tiebreakers and everything else. Our philosophy and our motto is we’re going to take care of it week to week. I know that’s a cliche that all coaches say. But that’s what we’re going to do, and we’re going to control what we can, and right now it’s preparing for Dawson County.” \nPreparations for both sides have been intense, as each prepares to face the other’s explosive and balanced offense. Neither defense is weak, but both groups know they will be challenged on Friday. \n“We’ve got to play good pass coverage. We’ve got to stop their pass game, just stop them in general,” Banks County linebacker/fullback Logan Hubbard said. \nStopping the Tigers has not proven easy for Dawson County foes in region play thanks to the Tigers’ balance of run and pass options. \nSophomore quarterback Coey Watson has thrown for 1,211 yards and 8 TDs with 10 interceptions and also rushed for 313 yards and 8 scores. His top targets are Austin Young (33 receptions, 467 yards, 1 TD) and Tucker Maxwell (23 receptions, 440 yards, 7 TDs), making it tough for defensive backfields to focus on just one side of the field. Running back Hunter Mitchell has also rushed for 585 yards and 3 TDs, rounding out an attack that is averaging 30.2 points per game in 7-AAA play. \nThat said, the group is also looking for some redemption after last week’s 31-15 loss at Fannin County that pulled the Tigers back to the pack. \n“I honestly think losing was good for us. After we started winning we got some big heads, didn’t really practice as hard during the week for the game against Fannin. And they did come out prepared for us,” Mitchell said. “We brought a lot more intensity to practice this week.” \nThe Tigers know they will need it against a Banks County team that has appeared to find its rhythm since opening region play with a 14-7 loss to Franklin County – a game in which starting quarterback Griffin Godwin went down with an injury. Godwin has since returned, and the Leopards have raised their game, scoring 100 points in their last two victories. \nBruising running back Trevae Cain leads the Banks County offense with 838 yards rushing and 17 total touchdowns, 10 coming in the last two contests. Multi-threat athlete Zezmon Steeple has also proved vital, catching 24 passes for 529 yards and 7 TDs. He has also rushed for 268 yards and 2 scores. Godwin has 1,038 yards passing and 9 TDs, completing 69 percent of his passes for an offense that is turning around 70 percent of third down plays into first downs. \n“I think we’re clicking huge right now,” Steeple said. “We’re playing great, but you’ve got to stay humble. You’ve got to be ready to play anybody because you can never underestimate your opponent.” \nConsidering what’s at stake, you can bet that neither side will be underestimating any factors on Friday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T04:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T16:54:26.448+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
