Freshmen Gabby Alicea and Erin Shultz led the Bearcats' offense with a combined 22.5 points in the America East match at the West Gym. BU made UNH work throughout the contest Sunday, but the two-time defending conference champions had enough to come away with a 25-18, 25-23, 25-22, victory. In the first game, Sarah Ngo got the Bearcats going, assisting on kills by Megan Burgess and then two by Shultz. A Bianca Anderson point made it 5-4 in New Hampshire's favor. Three UNH errors gave Binghamton the lead and then Ngo hit Alicea for a kill and an 8-6 advantage. Alicea continued her strong work, tallying each of BU's next three points on kills. A Wildcat miscue made it 12-8 and forced the visitors to call timeout. Points by Kristella Morina, Shultz, and Burgess kept Binghamton ahead, but an 8-1 run by New Hampshire swung the set. Anderson scored, but the Wildcats finished the frame with four straight points, taking a 1-0 match lead. Kaelan Haag was the catalyst for BU in the second set. The freshman posted two kills early and followed with a pair of aces, giving the home team a 6-4 lead. After a brief UNH rally, Ngo found Morina and Alicea for kills. Morina then served an ace, putting Binghamton up, 11-7. The Wildcats responded with a 5-0 run to get back into the action. Later in the game, Haag and Shultz each scored to even the score at 16. UNH answered with a 3-0 spurt and eventually grabbed a 21-17 advantage. BU fought back, though, as Alicea scored. A Wildcat error and an Anderson kill got Binghamton within a point at 21-20. Ngo assisted on points by Alicea and Anderson to keep it close and then UNH committed an attack error, tying the set at 23. Two New Hampshire kills ended the game in the visitors' favor, however. The freshmen sparked the Bearcats in the third frame, as Shultz assisted on a Haag kill and then Alicea served through to a 5-1 BU margin. Tied at 5, Haag scored, and after a Wildcat point, Ngo hit Shultz for consecutive kills and an 8-6 lead. UNH scored next, but Shultz came back with another point and Alicea followed with a kill. Alicea and Morina then teamed up for a block and a 12-8 BU margin. A 6-0 UNH run put the visitors back ahead, but Ngo and Morina combined for a block and then Ngo found Morina for a kill, making it 14-all. The Wildcats took control after that, going up, 20-16, as the set progressed. Three Shultz kills kept BU in it, but New Hampshire was able to come away with another tight win, ending the match. Alicea finished with 11.5 points and 9 digs. Shultz added 11 points, hitting .281 in the contest. Ngo dished out 32 assists and compiled 8 digs. Bailey Walker produced 22 digs and Kelly Leach generated 11 of her own. Binghamton (4-13, 1-2 AE) hits the road next weekend, playing at Stony Brook on Friday, October 9, and then at UMBC on Sunday, October 11, in a pair of America East contests.
