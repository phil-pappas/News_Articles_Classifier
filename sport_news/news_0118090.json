It worked out for them.\nOn Saturday, they repeated the feat on a minor chord. And it most certainly did not work out for them.\nIn that frame, the Jays and starter David Price turned a three-run lead into two-run disadvantage in the space of eight batters.\nKansas City won the game 6-3 and took a 2-0 series lead.\nAfter two early losses against Texas, the Jays didn’t give off a defeated or rattled vibe. They were, in the best sense, in mid-August form when it came to shrugging off a couple of setbacks.\nIn the first of those games, they were terrible. In the second, they were unlucky. They knew it’d turn around.\nThis was something different. The Jays got 6/7ths of an elite performance from their ace. The offence was ticking, if not very loudly. This was Toronto somewhere close to its optimum form. And it still blew up on them.\nThe Jays can’t tell themselves they gave this one away. Instead, it was taken from them.\n“[Kansas City] were looking for that one little crack …,” manager John Gibbons said afterward.\nThey found it.\nIt was one of those games that seemed going one direction from the beginning. It wasn’t until after the Jays were going over it that the cliff became visible.\nIt began with the first hitter of the seventh – Ben Zobrist – knocking a fly ball into no man’s land in right field.\nSecond baseman Ryan Goins seemed to wave right-fielder Jose Bautista off. Bautista slowed. Then Goins suddenly turtled. The ball dropped in for a base hit.\n“It’s on me. Nothing can be said about it. I just didn’t make the play,” Goins said afterward.\nDid you think you heard Bautista call for it?\n“Well, yeah.”\nDid Jose call for it?\n“No.”\nThat small miscue would ripple out, like cracks forming in ice.\nTo that point, Price had been at his mid-season best. Now, his confidence began to slowly flake away.\nFirst, a single. Then another. A groundout that might’ve been two had Price raising his arms in frustration. You could see that he was wobbling, but there was no one in the pen who seemed like a better option.\nAnother single, and now it was tied. The Jays were just trying to get Price to left-handed hitter Alex Gordon. After that, he could leave.\nBy his own admission, Price missed his pitch. Gordon doubled to deep right. The Royals had taken the lead. Price shuffled off. His relief – Aaron Sanchez – gave up another run.\nOver the first six innings, Price allowed the Royals only one hit. In the seventh, he gave up five. More proof that baseball isn’t about being perfect. It’s about making your mistakes at the right time.\nAfterward, as is his habit, Price placidly absorbed all the blame himself. But when someone put it to him that he’d “struggled” in the seventh, there was a small spark of anger.\n“I don’t think I struggled. I mean, it’s frustrating. But I didn’t struggle.”\nIt’s early yet, but a part of you does wonder if that’s the last time we ever see Price pitching in a Jays uniform.\nToronto has come back from this deficit, and with less margin for error. But this one feels different.\nLike the Jays, Texas was a team trying to figure itself out. The Royals already have. Beyond the talent, that self-confidence is what makes them so dangerous.\nA Jays win on Monday back in Toronto puts the series on relatively even footing.\nOne game – it doesn’t sound like much of a concession. That’s probably how Texas thought of it. The Royals will not.\nDuring last year’s post-season, Kansas City swept both the ALDS and the ALCS. They know how to step on a team’s neck once they’ve got them on the ground. They will be looking to exhibit that ruthlessness again.\nToronto had a game to give away here. Now they’ve got none.\nIt’s time to start creating more of those Game 5-type unforgettable memories. That’s the sort of level it’s now going to take.\nIf the Jays can’t, “the 7th inning” may become a whole fan-base’s collective shorthand for the 2015 post-season – both for good and bad.\nFollow Cathal Kelly on Twitter: @cathalkelly\nMore Related to this Story Royals 5, Blue Jays 0 (Kansas City leads ALCS 1-0) Kelly: Toronto’s thin pitching a worrying sight\nBlue Jays Royals take 2-0 lead over the Blue Jays in ALCS\nTopics: Kansas City Royals Toronto Blue Jays Kansas City, Kansas Comments Print /\nLicense A A", "external_links": ["http://license.icopyright.net/g2/3.8425?icx_id=26864129", "https://twitter.com/@cathalkelly", "http://embed.sendtonews.com/player2/embedcode.php?fk=Nq7D0Exu&cid=5240", "http://license.icopyright.net/3.8425?icx_id=26864129"], "published": "2015-10-18T04:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T04:53:53.658+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
