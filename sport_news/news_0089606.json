It'll be the first time in recorded history both programs started the same season 0-2 in the SEC. \nAuburn has started at least 0-2 in conference play 11 times: 1934, 1941, 1944, 1946, 1948, 1950, 1952, 1954, 1966, 1980 and 2012. \nAlabama has started at least 0-2 in conference play seven times: 1947, 1949, 1951, 1955, 1956, 1984 and 1990. \nSo no pressure, Jake Coker, but imagine the consequences if neither Alabama nor Auburn owns a single SEC victory after the first Saturday in October. \nWe may witness an Iron Bowl without a championship on the line for either team for the first time since 2007. We might start looking forward to basketball season before basketball season begins. \nIt's almost too painful to ponder. \nRELATED: Georgia will have Coker and a smile (Hollis picks) \nSo, to borrow a sneaky motivational ploy from Pat Dye , you have to wonder. Is Alabama man enough to beat Georgia - and save the season for the entire state? \nIf not, it'll be the end of the world as we know it. And, sorry, R.E.M., but we won't feel fine.
