(AP Photo/Michael Perez) (Michael Perez) \nPHILADELPHIA -- To some, Eagles defensive lineman Fletcher Cox burst onto the scene Sunday in the team's 39-17 win over the New Orleans Saints. \nJust not to anyone who has been watching over the past two years. \n\"When people talk about getting ready to go play us,\" head coach Chip Kelly said Monday, \"they talk about Fletcher.\" \nThe Saints certainly must be talking about him now, after Cox finished with three sacks, two forced fumbles and one fumble recovery. \nThe big game from Cox was nothing new to the Eagles, although the three sacks were a career-high for a single game. \n\"I really think for us, it's what Fletch has done since he's been here,\" Kelly said. \"He's been a very disruptive force on the defensive line since we came here. He is just starting to get noticed, when he should have been before.\" BRADFORD: Report card from win over Saints \nWhile he has had plenty of big plays this season, his biggest came on Sunday. \nWith the Eagles having just taken a 17-10 league, the Saints got the ball back midway through the third quarter. On the first play of the drive, Cox got into the backfield, sacked Brees, stripped him of the ball and recovered it. \nOne play later, quarterback Sam Bradford found tight end Brent Celek in the end zone for a touchdown and a 23-10 Eagles' lead. \n\"To make a play like that, not only does he force the play, get the sack and cause the fumble, but recover it...it was a really big play for us, especially at that time of the game,\" Kelly said. \"But that's just the kind of player he is. We keep seeing him get a little bit better every week.\" \nThrough five games this season Cox has wracked up 18 tackles, four sacks and two forced fumbles. The four sacks are just 1.5 shy of the career high he got in 2012, when he was still playing defensive end in a 4-3 scheme. \nNow in a 3-4 defensive scheme, Cox's four sacks in five games match his total from last season. \nA number that could be even higher. \n\"He was close in a couple of our earlier games,\" Kelly said. \"He was really close against Washington. (Defensive coordinator Billy Davis) says sacks come in bunches, but I think he has played at a really high level for us for awhile.\" THE NO-HUDDLE SHOW, Ep. 11: Finally, a glimpse of what Eagles fans expected \nThere were plenty of encouraging signs in the Eagles' blowout win over the Saints. From Fletcher Cox's dominance to Josh Huff's emergence, the Eagles showed what they're capable of doing. Now the question is: Can they do it again vs. the Giants?
