Is there a better word for it? A Cub word that is, hopefully. A more mournful word? Lives are lived with that word. Dreams are renewed with it. Hopefully.\nWhen does hope become certainty, want become swagger, wishes become demands? Sooner than later, it turns out.\nThe Cubs now face that strangest of visitors, not unwelcome but ever unnoticed. Hey, you, lurking there in the back. Step up. Name please.\n\"Confidence.\"\nFirst name.\n\"Over.\"\nOne big, bizarre inning. One efficient assist from the fickle bullpen. One Jake Arrieta waiting, and, viola, the Cubs are in charge and on the way.\nOh, yes. With a manager who cannot do anything wrong, the heart of a lineup that can't do anything and somewhere, somehow, the empathy of the ages allowing it to work from the edges in, all that's left is the bliss of home, an unexpanded strike zone and something to spray.\nWhy not just move right ahead to the World Series? Nothing is going to get more certain than this.\nToo soon?\nOf course it is. Of course. It is too soon if we're talking about what is real, but what about this Cubs team is real? A team too young, a team too irregular, a team without jealousy or egos? Ah, success will change all of that.\nOne bad pitch can change all of that. One misplayed ball, one wrong hunch, maybe the most likely thing for a team that is run on hunches. Eccentricity becomes idiocy when it doesn't work.\nThe Cubs have archivists combing dusty records to find out when something last happened. The pitcher batting eighth in October? Hmmm. Nope. Who treats batting practice like an elective? Who keeps track of such things except weathermen and wonks?\nSqueeze bunts? First let's figure out exactly what's being squeezed and why. And then we'll count by ones until we get to two and by innings until we get to one and throw our hands up and say, that's a new one. That old chucklehead, Joe, he's done it again.\nWho takes out his hottest hitter and replaces him with another rookie and then gets a two-run homer as if it is exactly what he expected to get?\nManager Joe Maddon, the mad alchemist, that's who. He shakes his beaker and pronounces today's brew ready and darned if it isn't. What has no business being anything is not only good enough, not only remarkable enough but satisfying enough.\nThe fallacy is that the Cubs need only to win. Too late for that. Surely, the winner of Game 3 will win the series, but winning will only amplify the ache.\nThe Cubs will always have the burden of universal and inescapable yearning, a demand that must be met, to succeed extraordinarily or to fail grandly.\nAny Cubs team brings a fated aura to these infrequent sniffs at what a team like the Cardinals takes for granted. Between curses and the calendar, the Cubs are not allowed to just play baseball. They also have the bases loaded with assumption and perception and expectation. Success is inevitably a rest stop on the way to distress.\nAt some point baseball will decide what happens with these Cubs, runs, hits, errors, balls and strikes. But the notion that some sort of cosmic blessing is at work is just irresistible.\nMuch handier and to the point, however, is the brilliance of Arrieta and the inevitability of Anthony Rizzo and Kris Bryant doing what they must. Perspective and poetry can wait for a result.\nHopefully.\nBernie Lincicome is a special contributor to the Chicago Tribune.\nPrivacy Policy Major League Baseball Chicago Cubs Jake Arrieta Kris Bryant", "external_links": ["http://www.tribpub.com/privacy-policy-and-your-privacy-rights/", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-561af61f/turbine/ct-lincicome-cubs-hope-spt-1012-20151011"], "published": "2015-10-12T02:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T03:36:42.886+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
