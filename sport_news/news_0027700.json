How long that takes is a case-by-case basis b ut for James that can still be a realistic mid-term target for him.\" \nWard-Prowse scored the winning penalty in the 1-0 win in Norway last month as England opened their Euro 2017 qualifying campaign and he began to exorcise his summer demons. \nBut Southgate believes his skipper, who scored his first senior goal for Southampton at the Ricoh Arena in 2012, has recovered from the setback. \n\"He was understandably disappointed with the summer, when he obviously wanted a different outcome,\" said the former Middlesbrough boss. \n\"He has been terrific for us but I just felt at the time his form dipped a little bit. \n\"It wasn't a decision I expected to have to make or wanted to make but he's got fantastic character and really outstanding attributes to recover from a setback like that and see it as a challenge and something he can put right and come back stronger. \n\"I feel that's what he's taken from the summer. \n\"It's not something he wanted to happen but we value him enormously, he knows that, and the penalty in Norway shows the responsibility he's willing to take and the technical ability that he has.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T09:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T20:06:31.013+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
