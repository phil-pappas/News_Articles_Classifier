He’s very mature. He’s become quite intelligent about what he’s going through,” Rhoads said. “At the same time he knows he’s in the hands of the Lord and the doctors and medical team that are working on him. He’s ready for an answer.” \nl Comments: montzdylan@gmail.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T23:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T22:08:28.025+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
