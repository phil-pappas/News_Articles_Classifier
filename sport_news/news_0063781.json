We’ll take it.” \nThe victory drastically improved the Mustangs’ chances of qualifying for the OCSAA playoffs, set to begin in two weeks. \nWesleyan Christian and Immanuel Lutheran came into the game battling for the final postseason spot. But, the final OCSAA seeding won’t come out until after next week’s games. \nPlayoffs or no playoffs, Wesleyan Christian came out Friday night with championship fervor. \nBradley Crawford snaked into the end zone from 10 yards out to lift the Mustangs to a 6-0 lead. \nIn the second quarter, Immanuel Lutheran knotted the score, 6-6, on a 20-yard scoring pass. \nBut, Wesleyan Christian snapped back with two more touchdowns before halftime — one of them on an 41-yard scoring aerial hook-up from Travian Weems to Harden, and another on a pass from Weems to Crawford for a 43-yard touchdown. \nImmanuel Lutheran trailed at halftime, 18-6, but rallied with two fourth quarter touchdowns — one of them on a freak completion, the other on a long run. \nOn their touchdown pass, Mustang defensive back Sheldon Woodward got a hand on the ball, but accidentally tipped it up, which allowed the receiver to grab it and go to the house. \nThe game then segued into its thrill conclusion. \nLate in the fourth quarter, the Mustangs had to punt the ball, but then got it back on a Woodward interception. \nHowever, Wesleyan Christian went three-and-out and punted. \nImmanuel Lutheran also struggled on its next possession. On a 4 th -and-long (20 or 25 yards), Immanuel Lutheran — which was pinned deep in its own territory — opted to try some trickery with a fake punt and run, England said. \n“But, we string him out and tackle him,” he added. \nWesleyan Christian then took possession of the ball on the Immanuel Lutheran 18-yard line. There were only 12 seconds left. \nOn the first play, the Mustangs threw an incomplete pass. \nThey then opted for a toss play, with Crawford throwing out of the backfield. \n“Initially, it (the pass) wasn’t there,” said England. “But, Bradley makes a pass rusher miss, rolls to the right and throws it.” \nAn Immanuel Lutheran defender was in good position to break up the play. But, instead, it caromed off of him and into the air. \n“Andrew Harden happens to be right there,” said England. “He catches it and spins into the end zone just as the clock runs out. … As Barry Switzer said, it’s better to be lucky.” \nThe Mustangs amassed 291 total offensive yards, split almost evenly — 160 through the air, 131 on the ground. \nWoodward rumbled for 113 yards on 23 totes, while Crawford cared out 36 yards on seven carries. \n“We ran the ball a little better,” England said. “But, when we needed to take the pressure of our defense in the third and fourth quarter we didn’t run it as well.” \nWeems completed 8-of-19 passes for 121 yards and two touchdowns, and tossed an interception. \nCrawford connected on both his passes for 39 yards. \nHarden hauled in three catches for 59 yards, followed by Crawford with four for 55. \nJerrell Martin added two receptions for 25 yards and Woodward with one grab for 21 yards. \nNext up, the Mustangs (3-6) close out the regular season with a game against Davenport.
