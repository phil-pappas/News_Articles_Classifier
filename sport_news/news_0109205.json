(Photo: Spokane Shock) CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nAfter laborious negotiations, the Spokane Shock could not reach a deal with the Arena Football League regarding trademark property. Unless a breakthrough happens in the next 24 hours, the Shock will begin a rebranding process as the team enters its inaugural season in the IFL. \nAccording to the team, the AFL's demands are unreasonable and there's no way the organization can meet the league halfway. At this point, an announcement is expected Monday morning that the Spokane Shock will begin a process to find a new team name and logo, along with all the other logistics that go into a new trademark. \nThe team plans to ask the fans for help and suggestions for the new team name during this process. \nThis is discouraging news for the organization after supposedly reaching a deal, in principle, earlier this week. \nThe big stir began on Oct. 18 when the AFL released this statement: \nThe Arena Football League has been in discussions with the Spokane Shock about allowing them to continue using the Shock name and trademarks. The rights to all Spokane Shock trademarks and logos are owned by the AFL and there have been earnest attempts to reach an agreement for the acquisition of those marks. Unfortunately, those attempts have not come to fruition and the League will retain the rights to the Spokane Shock name. The League intends to have a presence in the State of Washington again in the near future. \nAfter a meeting, the organization was optimistic the team would remain the Spokane Shock in the IFL, but that is not the case anymore. \nThis, of course, is a big issue because when the Shock entered the AFL from the AF2, the team signed over all of its trademark property to the league. That's why the organization is in this current predicament. \nThe Shock had a great run. In 10 years of existence, the team won two titles in the AF2 and one championship in the AFL. Spokane will play its first IFL game on Feb. 27, under which name though, who knows?
