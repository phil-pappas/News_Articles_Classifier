A solicitor firm, however, has written to BMC's Legal Department, seeking clarification as to how such a poll was allowed while the matter is still pending in the court.\nMeanwhile, Shiv Sena and the state government alienated the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in BMC and joined hands with the Opposition during the vote.\nThe Samajwadi Party (SP) had sought to re-open the 1964 and 1994 civic resolutions, wherein the party had demanded revoking the closure of the Deonar slaughter house for two days during the week-long Jain festival of Paryushan. The BJP then sought a vote over the issue. In all, 111 votes were received in favour of lifting the ban, while 24 were polled against the move.\nSP leader Rais Shaikh said that initially the slaughter house was shut just for a day. Then in 1994, one more day was added. \"The BJP, however, was not satisfied. To appease its vote bank, the party went on to ensure that not only the slaughter house was shut but there was a be blanket meat ban. While this was also tolerated, the party went overboard to declare a week-long ban, which was later brought down to four days. But all this can't be tolerated anymore,\" said Shaikh, after the proposal to reopen the resolutions was accepted through polling.\nMeanwhile, Solicis Lex, an avocates and solicitors firm, has written a letter to the Legal Department of BMC, seeking clarification if such a proposal to re-open or hold discussion can be allowed on the floor of the house wile the matter is pending in the court. High Court had given an interim order in this regard on September 11 and 14 when the Mutton Dealers Association had filed a writ petition against the state government and others.\nThis year, a four-day meat ban was imposed in Mumbai during Paryushan, and Sena, the ruling party in BMC, had demanded that two days be revoked. The notice of motion made to Mumbai Mayor Snehal Ambekar in BMC went totally unopposed, even by BJP, whose members had sought an eight-day ban.", "external_links": ["https://apis.google.com/js/platform.js", "https://plus.google.com/u/1/104164532788541805272/posts"], "published": "2015-10-11T16:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T11:18:25.213+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
