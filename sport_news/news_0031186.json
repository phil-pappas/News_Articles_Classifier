Attendance was 5,960, just 50 shy of a sellout.\nTambellini tallied the game-winner with a great shot from the right dot. He whipped a bid that eluded Sens goalie Matt O'Connor's 5-hole. O'Connor, a rookie, made 24 stops in his AHL debut.\nSyracuse Crunch Light Show Fans are treated to a light show to start off the Crunch home opener on Saturday night at the War Memorial.\nTambellini, 31, signed with the Tampa Bay organization after playing four season in Europe. His last full season in the AHL was 2007-08, when he went 38-38 for Bridgeport.\nWhile that was a long time ago, Tambellini said he expects the same rate of success in the AHL now. Saturday, he scored both goals for the Crunch on terrific shots from the right side.\n\"That's what I've always tried to bring to my game in pro hockey is an elite-level shot,'' Tambellini said. \"I got a chance to use it twice tonight. That (scoring) is my role. That's what I've done my whole career and I don't plan on changing that.''\nBinghamton's Cole Schneider put up the only score of the middle stanza on a short-handed marker that tied the game. Schneider out-fought Tanner Richard into the Crunch zone to win the puck, create a breakaway and beat Gudlevskis at the 4:58 mark.\nThat problem evoked leftover winces from last season when Syracuse permitted 12 short-handed scores, tied for the most in the AHL.\nTambellini, signed as a free agent in the offseason, introduced himself to fans just a few ticks after the opening faceoff. He showed his speed with a sprint down the right wing and unleashed a wicked wrister that seared O'Connor high glove side.\nTambellini said he felt it was important to test O'Connor with a quick bid.\n\"Any time you can catch a goalie, it was kind of a long wait, everybody is a little kind of rusty just to start the game,'' he said. \"When you can put a shot on there right away, usually good things happen.''\nLater in the first, Tye McGinn, another Crunch free agent, rang the bell for the team's first fight of the season.\nIt started when Crunch forward Yanni Gourde lined up opposite Binghamton's Colin Greening on a faceoff. Gourde and Greening chirped before the puck dropped, and McGinn moved over to take Gourde's spot on the draw.\nMcGinn and Greening snarled at each other, and after the rubber hit ice their gloves quickly followed. They squared off for an extended bout in which both players landed several blows.\nThe Crunch travels to Hartford on Sunday for a 5 p.m. contest. The game matches Tambellini against his younger brother, Hartford rookie forward Adam, for the first time in their careers.\n— Boxscore\n— AHL standings\nContact Lindsay Kramer anytime: Email | Twitter | 315-470-2151", "external_links": ["http://theahl.com/stats/statdisplay.php?type=standings", "http://theahl.com/stats/game-summary.php?game_id=1014735", "https://twitter.com/LindsayKramerPS", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/UIi-6QN5G_E"], "published": "2015-10-18T12:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T13:49:43.314+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
