It's still pretty raw, as you might expect, but this is a team that seems to genuinely get along and play well together in spite of its relative inexperience. Much of that, at least in my opinion, can be traced to Tyler Ulis manning the point as a stabilizing force. Despite the fact there are others who certainly can man that position in addition to Ulis, this is pretty clearly his show, and you can tell younger teammates respond to his leadership and defer to him. That tends to be a big deal for a team that, well, doesn’t really have a ton of experience among its key guys. Report: Labissiere ruled eligible by NCAA \n-- Ulis, Isaiah Briscoe, Jamal Murray, Skal Labissiere and Marcus Lee were together in one group. EJ Floreal, Mychal Mulder, Charles Matthews, Derek Willis and Isaac Humphries were in the other. Obviously, lineups like these are still quite fluid and on this day they reflected that … \n-- Alex Poythress took a planned day off in his knee recovery, spending most of practice riding a stationary bike. Dominique Hawkins (hand) was out as well, while freshman Matthews was a little limited by a jammed finger/thumb, though he did practice. Same for Willis (finger), who sat out a few drills but was active for most of them. \n-- For what it’s worth, my most impressive player from watching one October practice: Jamal Murray. He’s got a polished game for a freshman. Basically, he doesn’t look, act or play like a rookie. He has deceptive acceleration and quickness with the ball and can handle and create off the dribble against pretty much anyone, showing the ability to score in different ways. Plus, he's a very formidable shot-up shooter from the perimeter. This guy is going to be a problem for other teams defensively. I wouldn’t call it a reach to think he could be the Wildcats’ leading scorer this season. \n-- That said, it’s not hard to see why analysts have Labissiere as a potential No. 1 NBA draft pick. There’s an awful lot of talent and potential in that tall frame. He’s going to get stronger as he matures, but he can defend the rim already, and he’s got a nice little spot-up jump shot to go along with the kind of open-court athleticism and coordination that you rarely see in a 6-foot-11 player. \n-- John Calipari was about as active as anyone out there throughout this practice, stopping play after pretty much every sequence to teach, with the majority of the lessons aimed at the freshmen, who you could tell are still clearly conditioning and figuring out the kind of consistent effort required at this level. Some freshmen heard it more than others. But at some point or another, they all heard it. On the other hand, UK's Murray gets creative \n-- Willis not only looked healthy, but he looks like the kind of player who could help this team more than some might expect. He consistently drained 3-pointers in scrimmage situations, and at one point a timely and accurate deep pass sprang Mulder for a fast-break dunk (a sequence that led to a little extra conditioning for the other side). \n-- Speaking of Mulder, he wasn’t a high-profile addition as a JUCO guy, but he’s got some ability. He’s known more as a shooter (and he can do that), but he attacks the rim with purpose and threw down some impressive dunks. Remember that he’s older than your average freshman, and the strength shows. \n-- Humphries seems like the type of guy that could have gone elsewhere and immediately been one of the better players on his team. But it’s a little different at Kentucky, where he’s being pushed right now in practice by some very talented players around him and adjusting to the steep climb in competition. He’s a young guy, though, and he's got some offensive skills. \n-- If you were to ask me an overall strength to watch for this season, my crystal ball might come back with 3-point shooting. Murray, Ulis, Briscoe and Mulder all seemed to make a hefty percentage – in all kinds of different drills and settings. Even some of the bigs were getting it done from out there. 3 CONNECT 17 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://cjky.it/1LSYhFF TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T03:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T20:10:59.444+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
