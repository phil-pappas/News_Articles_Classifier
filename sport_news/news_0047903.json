Earlier, Rajiv Gandhi had visited Jordan as Prime Minister in 1988.\nThe President will meet King Abdullah and have extensive discussions on the entire gamut of bilateral relations, regional and international issues of mutual concern.\nHe will also visit the University of Jordan and address its students and faculty. He will also grace a function organised by Indian Ambassador in Amman for Indian community and Friends of India.\nDuring his visit to Palestine, the President will hold meetings and interactions with Palestinian President Mahmud Abbas, Prime Minister Rami Hamdallah and leaders of major political parties.\nHe will also address the Al-Quds University where he will be conferred an honorary doctorate after which he will inaugurate Jawaharlal Nehru Secondary School at Abu Dees in East Jerusalem.\nOn the Palestine dispute, he had said that India remains steadfast in its principled support to the Palestinian cause and India has always favoured a negotiated solution resulting in a sovereign, independent, viable and a united state of Palestine with East Jerusalem as its capital living with recognised and secured borders side by side with Israel as endorsed in the ‘Quartet’ roadmap.\nFrom there, the President will travel to Israel during which the highlight of his visit will be his address to its Parliament Knesset, which is a rare honour for any visiting leader.\nMukherjee will hold talks with his Israeli counterpart Reuven Rivlin and meet Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as well as the Speaker of the Knesset Yuli-Yoel Edelstein.\nThe discussions are expected on subjects like terrorism and cooperation in various areas. MoUs in the fields of culture, education, science and technology will be signed.\nIndia established diplomatic relations with Israel in 1992 and since then the relationship has evolved into a multi-dimensional partnership.\nIndia and Israel are engaged in a range of issues of bilateral interest including cooperation in agriculture, science and technology, education and the visit will further cement bonds of cooperation between the two sides and enhance mutual understanding.\nDuring the visit to Palestine and Israel, the President will lay a special emphasis on resuming the stalled dialogue process between Israel and Palestine since September last year. — PTI", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T12:03:21.668+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
