He spends the rest of the summer playing for the North Country Freeze club team, which was started by former St. Lawrence University men’s soccer coach Bob Durocher. \n“It helps a lot,” Snell said. “Mostly (with the Freeze) you are playing with kids from Ogdensburg and Lisbon, kids you play against throughout the season. It helps bring the whole (Northern Athletic Conference) up. There’s a lot of very-good coaching.” \nThe extra work has helped Snell become one of the best boys soccer players in Section 10. \nHe’s helped his Panther team to an 11-1-1 overall record and a 10-0-1 record in the Northern Athletic Conference’s East Division, which currently has Parishville-Hopkinton in first place. \nHe ranks third in scoring in Section 10 with 18 goals and 5 assists and Tuesday night he saw a 12-game, goal-scoring streak snapped against Norwood-Norfolk. \n“He’s been guarded by two guys a lot,” Panthers coach Tony Engstrom said. “He has the ability to created his own space and he can strike the ball well. He’s scored numerous goals where he’s 25 to 30 yards out and the goalie didn’t have much chance on it. \n“He is very quick. He spends time in the weight room and he’s tough to knock off the ball. He’s not a real big kid (5-foot-9, 165 pounds), but he has put a lot of work and effort into playing at the next level.” \nSnell does not play a winter sport, instead focusing on club soccer, but he plays baseball on another team coached by Engstrom in the spring. The pair of built a solid player-coach relationship. \n“There’s certain times where we need to change our philosophy during a game, or I need him to do something else, and he understands it,” Engstrom said. “He’s definitely one (player) I could pull over and say, ‘This is what we need to start doing’. He takes it in stride. At the same time I can take what he’s seeing on the field, too. He’ll have an opinion too and we have a pretty-good, senior-captain/coach relationship. In the end it makes everything a little better.” \nSaid Snell, “I feel like I can come to (Engstrom), even without soccer issues. He’s a good guy to talk too and I feel like I can relate to him. Most of the time we agree on stuff.” \nThe regular season ends Monday and the Panthers are now focusing on trying to reach the state Class D playoffs, a goal they came very close to achieving last season. \nParishville-Hopkinton tied for the Section 10 championship, playing Lisbon to a 0-0 tie in the Class D title game. But the Golden Knights won the shootout 4-3 to advance on penalty kicks to the state tournament. \n“If we play like we can, and if the other guys step up, I certainly think we can make a good run in the playoffs,” Engstrom said. “We can’t rely on one or two guys. When it comes to the playoffs, that’s where everyone needs to show up. (Snell) is very vocal and he likes to push and encourage others. He talks a lot. He is one that when it gets going he wants that ball on his foot, he wants that challenge. He pushes (teammates) to do their job better. In the end it’s about the other guys taking what he’s doing and taking it to heart and it is time to go to work.” \nSnell is looking forward to the playoffs as well, especially being a senior. He also hopes to face Lisbon’s Adam Kelley again, who often rides with him to those club practices in Syracuse. \n“It’s exciting playing on the turf and under the lights,” Snell said. “I definitely have to say my biggest competition is (Kelley). We chirp each other.”  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T09:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T18:19:46.824+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
