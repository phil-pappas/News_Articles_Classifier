He alleged: “The Akali Dal is involved in the act of desecrating the ‘bir’. It is their ploy to deflect attention from farmers’ protests against the destruction of vast swathes of cultivated cotton land on account of fake pesticide use. The SAD government must open itself to a judicial probe in the matter.” He also sought a high-level judicial probe into the killing of two peaceful protesters in police firing in Faridkot. “Why were shots fired at two youths who were peacefully protesting against the desecration of the holy ‘birs’ when Faridkot Deputy Commissioner had not even issued shooting orders? Police firing happened at the behest of state agencies which resorted to needless firing leading to the current mayhem,” he alleged.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T10:09:45.589+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
