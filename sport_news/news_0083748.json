I think he's only scratched the surface. I like his growth and how he complements Dez Bryant. I think the other two are possible, but playing running back certainly doesn't help Randle. Teams seem scared to pay the big bucks to an aging running back. Escobar just needs more opportunities. The Cowboys have so many weapons that he could find a better situation on the open market. I think some other previous Cowboys TE draft picks did that.\nQuestion: What's your projection for the rest of the season?\nJon Machota:\nWeek 7 at Giants: Win.\nWeek 8 vs. Seahawks: Loss.\nWeek 9 vs. Eagles: Win.\nWeek 10 at Buccaneers: Win.\nWeek 11 at Dolphins: Loss.\nWeek 12 vs. Panthers: Win.\nWeek 13 at Redskins: Win.\nWeek 14 at Packers: Loss\nWeek 15 vs. Jets: Win\nWeek 16 at Bills: Loss\nWeek 17 vs. Washington: Win\nI still have the Cowboys going 9-7 and winning the division with a win in Week 17 to clinch it. I think Dez returns to face the Giants (And that's a total guess. I think they'll have him try to practice next week and take it all the way down to Sunday and he'll be on the field. Of course, I have no exact idea of how his rehab is going and they could keep him out another week.)\nThere was a time when I thought they would lose to Tampa Bay, but that's when I thought Romo and Dez would be healthy, the Cowboys would be rolling and they'd overlook the lowly Bucs. That's clearly not the case any more. They'll absolutely need that game, so I think they'll get it.\nAlthough Romo will be eligible to return vs. Miami, I have my doubts that they bring him back for Suh and Co. and then turn around on short rest and play Carolina the following Thursday.\nI don't feel good about the Bills game because I think it's going to be brutally cold and that's a significant advantage for the home team.\nI don't think much of this Redskins team, so I have the Cowboys beating them twice in five games.\nQuestion: Romo's injury again truly does solidifiy the reason that the Cowboys need to draft a quarterback in next years draft. Your take.\nJon Machota: I agree that they should draft a QB every few years, but I don't know if they'd be in any better of a situation at the moment. Let's say they drafted a decent starter four years ago. That player might no longer even be with the team. Good QBs don't sit on benches. They sign elsewhere or get traded for draft picks. Look around the league, there aren't many better options than Weeden, as far as backups. The sole reason why I would be focused on drafting a QB at this time is to potentially find Romo's successor. But I don't know that you find that guy in the fourth, fifth, sixth or seventh rounds.\nQuestion: Who would you say is the best pure athlete on the Cowboys? Not counting Dez now that he's hurt.\nJon Machota: Dez is clearly on a different level. After him I think it's a big group that includes most of the running backs and wide receivers. On defense: Randy Gregory quickly comes to mind.\nQuestion: Talk me off the ledge, Jon. Why should I still have hope this team can make the playoffs?\nJon Machota: I'll break this down into five parts. Here are my reasons you should remain optimistic.\nNo. 1: They're in a bad division. I don't see any team running away with it. I think it could come down to the final game with Dallas and New York both finishing 9-7 and the Cowboys getting in because they potentially sweep the regular season meetings between the two clubs.\nNo. 2: The improved pass rush. There's a trickle-down effect. Everyone will look better with Randy Gregory and Greg Hardy on the field together. Every defensive lineman will be better because there's more talent around them and less reps, meaning they can be fresher late in games. The defensive backs will be better because there's not as much time for quarterbacks to sit in the pocket and pick them apart.\nNo. 3 ties in with No. 2 in that more playmakers on the field should lead to more turnovers. The Cowboys haven't caused one the last three weeks, but when that streak comes to an end, many in the locker room believe they'll start coming in bunches. This is an area they were excellent in last year.\nNo. 4: The offense will get a spark from the return of Dez Bryant. When 88 gets back on the field, that'll take a lot of pressure off Witten and Beasley in the passing game and should make things a little easier when it comes to running the ball.\nNo. 5: There have been no setbacks for Tony Romo and he could be back on the field as early as Week 11. That means possibly only five more games without him. If the Cowboys can win twice between now and then, a healthy Romo has the ability to lead this team to a 5-2 record in the final seven. It's certainly not a guarantee, but I'm talking about reasons for hope. If Romo was done for the year, I wouldn't have much, if any, hope.\nQuestion: Let's say the Cowboys absolutely tank this season and end up with the No. 1 pick in the draft. Whom do they take? Or perhaps which position do they target?\nJon Machota: I definitely don't predict this scenario happening, but if it did, I think they'd take the best defensive linemen or defensive back. I don't think they'd take a running back, wide receiver or offensive lineman. Quarterback would be interesting, but I think the Cowboys will be swinging for the fences again in 2016, so they'll take the player who can make the biggest immediate impact.\nGuys that would interest me: Jalen Ramsey, DB, Florida State; Joey Bosa, DE, Ohio State, Vernon Hargreaves, CB, Florida. Of course, they could still go QB and get Romo's successor in Cal's Jared Goff. He had a poor showing against Utah (2 TDs, 5 INTs), but he seems to be the guy most analysts project to be the first QB off the board next year.\nQuestion: Do you think Dez Bryant will be at full ability when he does return? What potential limitations does his injury present in both the short and long term?\nJon Machota: I honestly don't know if there will be any limitations when he returns. Not sure he'll have any short term limitations. I doubt it will limit him at all if you're talking beyond this season. But I will say this, the Cowboys are a much better team with Dez Bryant at even 80 percent than not having him at all. The biggest risk is that if you bring him back too soon, he could suffer a significant setback. Dez and the medical staff obviously know this. He's not going to be on the field against the Giants if everyone involved isn't on board.\nHe did some rehab work during Thursday's practice and looked like his old self. Not that that means he's ready to go. We're talking about a player who had a screw put in his foot and was walking normally around the locker room like nothing happened a week later. It appears like he heals quickly. But we'll just have to wait and see next week. He'll have to practice before they can even think about having him on the field vs. the Giants. If it's just about dealing with pain, Dez will play. But it's more than that. They have to be confident that the bone is fully healed.\nQuestion: Little early for this, but after watching a few weeks of the Cowboys this year where do you think the team will focus in the draft next year?\nJon Machota: It's way too early, but I love talking draft, so this is my best guess: Running back, wide receiver and quarterback would all be pretty high on my list. Players to watch: Ezekiel Elliott, Ohio State; Derrick Henry, Alabama (in the first round); Cody Kessler, USC; Gunner Kiel, Cincinnati (in the second or third round); Travin Dural, LSU; Stacy Coley, Miami (third round or later)\nQuestion: Do you think Dez is getting a little too full of himself?\nJon Machota: I wouldn't say he's getting too full of himself. He's just a really animated guy. That's not to say other guys on the team aren't as passionate. They just aren't as animated. The Cowboys won't try to change that about 88. It took multiple guys to pull him back from Malcolm Jenkins before the game in Philly last year. Some probably didn't like his pregame actions that night. But then he goes on to catch 3 TDs. As long as his emotion doesn't lead to missing games, I don't see it being a problem.\nQuestion: If the Cowboys beat the Giants next week and are sitting 3-0 in the division with reinforcements on the way, they have to be the favorite to win the division, right?\nJon Machota: I would agree with that thought. Jerry Jones thinks they need 10 wins to win the division. I think they can get it done with nine, as long as they take care of business against the other NFC East teams. That way they'll have the benefit of the tiebreaker if Washington, Philly or NY also have nine wins. The division isn't that good. If they can win a couple games before Romo gets back, they'll remain in the hunt as long as Romo and Co. are playing well once he returns.\nOn Twitter:\n @jonmachota", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/jonmachota"], "published": "2015-10-20T02:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T08:04:50.324+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
