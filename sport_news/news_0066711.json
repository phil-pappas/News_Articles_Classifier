(Image Source: Alex Brandon) \nBehind the power pitching of Matt Harvey (2 runs, 7.2 innings, 9 Ks), Noah Syndergaard (1 run, 5.2 innings, 9 Ks) and Jeurys Familia (0 runs, 2.1 innings, 2 saves) the New York Mets have jumped out to a two games to none lead over the Chicago Cubs in the National League Championship Series. The NLCS now shifts to Wrigley Field for games three through five (if necessary) starting tonight, as the Cubbies look to get back into the series. \nWho: New York Mets vs. Chicago Cubs; What: NLCS Game 3; When: 8:07 PM; Where: Wrigley Field (TBS); Why: For the right to advance to the World Series \nThe Starters: You would think after facing Matt Harvey and Noah Syndergaard things would get easier in Game 3 for the Cubs. You would be wrong. The Mets will send All-Start and NLDS hero Jacob deGrom (14-8, 2.54 ERA, 0.98 WHIP) to the mound tonight. The longhaired fire baller won Games 1 and 5 in Los Angeles, allowing two runs over 13 innings while striking out 20 Dodgers for an ERA of 1.38 and a WHIP of 1.15. Not only did he win two games on the road in the Divisional Series, deGrom beat two of the best pitchers in all of baseball, Clayton Kershaw and Zack Greinke . \nThe Cubs will be sending youngster Kyle Hendricks to the mound. The 25-year old had a decent season, going 8-7 in 25 starts with a 3.95 ERA and a 1.16 WHIP, allowing 17 home runs. In the NLDS against the St. Louis Cardinals, Hendricks served up three home runs in 4.2 innings, while striking out seven. He didn’t allow many to reach base (4 hits, 0.86 WHIP) but if he can’t keep the Mets in the ballpark (5.79 ERA) it will be a short series for the Cubs. \nWho’s Hot: Second baseman Daniel Murphy and right fielder Curtis Granderson were hot against the Dodgers and they have not cooled off in the first two games of the NLCS. With home runs off of Jake Arrieta and Jon Lester , Murphy (.357) has gone yard in four straight games with five home runs and eight RBIs this postseason. Leadoff man Granderson has nine hits and four walks for a BA of .375 and OBP of .448. They have combined for 10 runs scored and 15 RBIs in seven playoff games. The other Met swinging a hot bat is Gold Glove centerfielder Juan Lagares who will likely come off the bench for Terry Collins . Closing out games, Jeurys Familia (four saves) has been lights out, allowing just three base runners (0.39 WHIP) and no runs in 7.2 innings of relief. \nThere is no shortage of young bats that have been sizzling this postseason for the Cubs. Leadoff man Dexter Fowler is batting .296 with two homers, while rookie OFs Kyle Schwarber (.381) and Jorge Soler (.455) have provided the middle of the order with pop. Schwarber has hit four bombs and has a slugging percentage of .952, while Soler is slugging at a 1.091 clip with two HRs and three extra-base hits in 11 ABs. The second-youngest Cub is 22-year old SS Javier Baez who is 5 of 10 with a HR since taking over for the injured Addison Russell . If the Cubs can take a lead late into the game they should be in good shape, because they have the bullpen edge. Clayton Richard (1.2 innings), Justin Grimm (1.1 innings) and Fernando Rodney (0.2 innings) haven’t allowed a run in 3.1 innings combined, while Travis Wood (1.59 ERA), Trevor Cahill (2.70 ERA) and Pedro Strop (3.00 ERA) have struck out 19 batters in 12 innings of work. \nWho’s Not: C Travis d’Arnaud (.192), OF Michael Conforto (.100), 1B Lucas Duda (.095) and 3B David Wright (.087) are four regulars batting below the Mendoza line this postseason. Duda has struck out a whopping 13 times in 21 at bats and he has yet to get an extra-base hit. Wright, d’Arnaud and Yoenis Cespedes have all struck out 10 times and while Wright has six walks, neither d’Arnaud nor Cespedes has drawn a bases on balls. \nWhile half of Chicago’s regular’s are hot, the other half is not. Presumptive Rookie of the Year Kris Bryant is batting just .185 and cleanup man Anthony Rizzo is hitting .167, and they’ve both struck out eight times. Catcher Miguel Montero has just two hits in 17 ABs (.118), while SS Starlin Castro (.192) and OF Chris Coghlan (.100) are also off to slow starts this postseason. \nDaniel Mogollon is a member of the Pro Football Writers of America and the Football Writers Association of America.
