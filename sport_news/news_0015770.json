NEW YORK — Terry Collins hasn’t named his Game 2 starter yet, mainly because he’s awaiting a status check on right-hander Noah Syndergaard. If he’s not able to go, Collins will call on lefty Steven Matz for Sunday’s start.\nSyndergaard tossed a scoreless relief inning in Friday’s clinching division series Game 5 at Los Angeles, but he also warmed up on four separate occasions that night – throwing over 100 pitches in the process. Collins equated that to nearly five innings of work.\n\"His last time he pitched, the second day he was still pretty sore,\" Collins said of Syndergaard. \"So, if he’s tender [today], he’s probably not going to be the Game 2 guy.\"\nKORNER POCKET: Growing up in Hazleton, Pa., Cubs manager Joe Maddon watched some Mets games on WOR-TV and recalled his admiration for left fielder Cleon Jones, the famous \"Sign Man\" at Shea Stadium and broadcaster Ralph Kiner’s postgame show, \"Kiner’s Korner.\"\n\"I really think something like that should be brought back [on TV] in black and white,\" Maddon said. \"Whoever the host is, permit him to have a cigarette and just sit there … I think it would be very popular.\"\nSUMMER OF ’69: And what was Collins up to during that famous Mets-Cubs summer of ’69? \"I was trying to graduate from college. I don’t remember any [pennant] races,\" Collins said. \"I was worried about going to war more than anything else.\"\nThat year, Mets general manager Sandy Alderson was a Marine stationed at Quantico, Va., and he recalled the unique way he followed the World Series. \"The field radios that we used … could pick up the audio from the television broadcasts. A few of us would go out into the brush and hide and listen to the games.\"\nWHAT TO DO ABOUT DUDA: Alderson doesn’t view slugging first baseman Lucas Duda’s division series struggles at the plate as something to be overly concerned about. \"We faced [Zack] Greinke and [Clayton] Kershaw twice each. That’ll put people in a slump,\" Alderson said.\nAlderson added that Juan Uribe (chest contusion) will not be added to the NLCS roster.\nRATINGS WHOPPER: The Mets-Dodgers NLDS Game 5 drew 7.4 million viewers according to TBS, the highest-rated division series game ever broadcast by the network in the New York market.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T04:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T08:33:43.411+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
