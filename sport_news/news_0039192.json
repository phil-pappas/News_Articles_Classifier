The Group B match got off to a brisk pace with Delhi establishing a lead (25-20) at the end of the opening quarter. The duo of Sunil Kumar and Vishal Gupta were in the thick of action. However, Haryana bounced back with vengeance through Sonu Kumar, who penetrated the rivals’ defence time and again. Delhi wilted under the pressure, allowing Haryana to take one-point lead at the end of the half-time (45-43). Delhi skipper Sunil Kumar made all the difference in the next two quarters to steer his side to victory. He sank in 33 points and was ably assisted by Vishal and Rachit Kumar, who contributed 21 and 14 points, respectively. For the losing team, Sonu Kumar was the main scorer with 19 points, while Lalit and Deepak chipped in with 13 points each. Meanwhile, defending champions Punjab boys continued to dominate the proceedings, facing no challenge so far. In a match played on Sunday evening, the local lads pipped Karnataka 83-34 to record their third win in a row.
