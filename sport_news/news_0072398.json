Pangilinan is elated over this development and has given instructions to his people to prepare all pertinent documents covering the requirements to formally indicate SBP’s interest to bid for the hosting rights to an Olympic wildcard tournament. Those documents have been forwarded to FIBA, according to Barrios.\nIt will be known by Nov. 23 whether the Philippines’ bid has been looked upon favorably unlike before. The country sought to host the 2019 FIBA World Cup but lost out to China.", "external_links": ["http://i.po.st/static/v3/post-widget.js#publisherKey=4qcr4d26tnrf260rqrda&retina=true"], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T05:56:24.596+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
