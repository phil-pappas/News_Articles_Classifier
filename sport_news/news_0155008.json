At the same time, Manley punched at the football. Much to his delight, the ball came loose and Montville’s Joe Satiro scooped it up. “I was on the other side of the field and I saw the fumble. I just had to pick it up and go,” Satiro said. Montville is not an explosive offensive team this season, which means the defense will have to make big plays. Satiro did just that by recovering the fumble and taking it 38 yards to the end zone just 57 seconds into the second half. It swung the game in Montville’s favor in a 28-0 Indians win on Thursday night. “It was a momentum situation,” Montville coach Tanner Grove said. “The only way we were going to score 20 in this game was a defensive touchdown, like a turnover.” Montville milestones The win came on a night of records at Montville High School. Grove earned his 71st career victory, surpassing Mike Emery as the all-time leader in program history. “It’s a lot of kids who have done great things for us,” said Grove who took over the program in 2006. “Every year coming to work has been a joy because of the kids every day.” It was also the first time in the program’s history, according to Grove, that a female had scored a point. Senior Tamara Veillette kicked all four extra points for the Indians. Veillette had a kick blocked against Stonington and a snap was muffed against Plainfield. There were no problems like that against the Vikings and she was true on all four kicks. “It’s life-changing,” Veillette said. “I didn’t think I would do it, but I did.” The Indians got on the board first when fullback Christian Davis rumbled into the end zone from 6 yards out with 11 minutes, 19 seconds left in the first half. But it was Satiro who shouldered most of the offensive load. The junior running back was making his first start at tailback. Grove said Satiro was buried on the depth chart, but kept grinding at practice and four lost fumbles in the first two games prompted Grove to give him a shot. “He’s a real tough kid and he gets after it every day,” Grove said. “He’s the ultimate team guy. He’s never in three years been a me-me-me-type kid. We love him. He got a shot this week and all we ask is that you fall forward and don’t give up the football.” Page 2 of 2 - Nice performance Satiro carried the ball 22 times for the Indians (2-1) for 140 yards and added an offensive touchdown on a 1-yard dive with 4:50 to play. “We just have to keep pounding it and pounding it and five or six yards will win us the game,” Satiro said. Montville’s defense made a goal-line stand when Tyler Price stopped East Lyme quarterback Dylan Hatajik (9-for-23 passing, 86 yards; 36 yards rushing) on a bootleg at the 1-yard line. Two stops later, the shutout was complete as the Indians held East Lyme (0-4) to 59 yards rushing. “They beat us up pretty good,” East Lyme coach Rudy Bagos. “We were able to move the ball last week against NFA pretty well, but give (Montville) credit, they had a great game plan.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T06:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T06:43:19.042+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
