But there's still no trophy.'' \nHis rushing total of 243 yards broke Toby Gerhart's six-year-old school record. He returned a kickoff 96 yards, uncorked a 70-yard touchdown run and averaged 13.1 yards every time he touched the ball.

(Nhat V. Meyer/Bay Area News Group) (Nhat V. Meyer) \n\"It says a lot about the front seven,'' McCaffrey said of the offensive line. \"The guys working hard allows me to make plays.\" \nAnd yet, McCaffrey did not produce the play of the game. \nThat came courtesy of receiver Francis Owusu on a flea flicker pass from quarterback Kevin Hogan. Owusu reached around UCLA safety Jaleel Wadood and somehow pinned the ball on Wadood's back, then held on as they tumbled to the grass. \n\"I was squeezing (the ball) for my life,'' Owusu said. \nSaid McCaffrey: \"I'm still at a loss for words, It was one of the most amazing things I've seen in my life.\" \nAdd another impressive performance by Hogan, efficiency on third down and a bevy of UCLA miscues, and 15th-ranked Stanford rolled to its eighth consecutive victory over the Bruins and topped the 40-point mark for the fourth game in a row.

'We're happy to keep this going.'' \nStanford opened the scoring early in the first quarter, when cornerback Alijah Holder stepped in front of an underthrown sideline pass by UCLA's Josh Rosen. Holder grabbed the ball, eluded a tackler and produced a nifty 31-yard interception return for a touchdown.

(Nhat V. Meyer/Bay Area News Group) ( Nhat V. Meyer ) \nIt was Stanford's first Pick 6 since the Jan. '14 Rose Bowl (Kevin Anderson) and only the fourth turnover the Cardinal has forced this season. \nThe Bruins zoomed down the field as tailback Paul Perkins unleashed a dazzling 43-yard run that took UCLA into the red zone. But two penalties killed the drive and the Bruins settled for a field goal. \nThe big plays continued — immediately. McCaffrey returned the ensuing kickoff 96 yards to set up a short touchdown pass from Hogan to tight end Austin Hooper, giving the Cardinal a 14-3 lead. \nThe Bruins wasted no time answering. On first down, Rosen and receiver Darren Andrews connected on 70-yard catch-and-run touchdown. \nFrom there, the pace of scoring slowed — much to Stanford's liking. The Cardinal took 14 plays and more than seven minutes to push its advantage to 21-10 on Hogan's laser to Devon Cajuste. But the key plays took place well before the scoring strike, when Stanford converted third downs of 12 and 13 yards. Both times, Hogan hit Hooper, his favorite receiver. \nLess than one minute into the second quarter, the teams had combined for 31 points. There was more to come. McCaffrey charged nine yards for a touchdown midway through the quarter to cap a three-play drive, then scored on a 28-yard dash with 2:13 left before halftime. \nEarly in the third quarter, the Cardinal squashed any chance of a UCLA comeback. It came in the form of a flea flicker. McCaffrey took the snap from center in the Wildcat formation, handed to tailback Bryce Love, who then flipped to Hogan. \nHogan gathered himself, then tossed a 41-yard pass to Owusu in the end zone. Owusu reached around the back of a UCLA defender, grabbed the ball and held on. \nThe play gave Stanford a 42-17 lead. \n\"I can't describe that catch -- I can't understand what happened,'' coach David Shaw said. \"I thought it was incomplete.\" \nFormer Stanford all-conference safety John Lynch was the honorary captain.
