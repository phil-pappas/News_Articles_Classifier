He hasn’t played since getting injured in the opener against the Giants. \nThe Cowboys (2-3) have lost all three games without Bryant and quarterback Tony Romo, who broke his left collarbone a week after Bryant went out. After the game against the Giants (3-3), Romo will miss at least three more games. \nReceiver Brice Butler will be available for Dallas after missing a loss to New England with a strained hamstring. The Cowboys traded for Butler after Bryant’s injury. \n___ \nAP NFL website: www.pro32.ap.org and www.twitter.com/AP_NFL Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T00:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T00:32:11.329+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
