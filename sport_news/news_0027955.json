He demanded immediate dismissal of his government and imposition of President’s rule to restore peace and law and order in the state. Talking to the mediapersons today after paying obeisance at the Golden Temple along with his wife Preneet Kaur, CLP leader Sunil Jakhar and about 20 MLAs, Amarinder asked why the government did not act when the holy book was stolen from a gurdwara near Kotkapura in June. He said had timely action been taken, the situation would not have reached this impasse. Asserting that nobody, including Badal, will be allowed to fiddle with the authority of Akal Takht, Amarinder: “Nobody will be allowed to undermine its supreme authority and whosoever tries to do that, will duly and rightly be punished and defeated in his designs like Badal.” He pointed out that “in the past there were “massands”, who were thrown out and modern day massands like Badal would also be thrown out and the process had already been started”. On Badal’s appeal seeking all parties’ cooperation in maintaining peace, he observed it was an irony that the person responsible for the current mess was now seeking help from other parties to restore peace. On Khadoor Sahib MLA Ramanjit Sikh Sikki’s resignation, he said he understood his sentiments and he was genuinely hurt over the desecration of the holy book in a gurdwara in his area. “Sikki’s action reflects the hurt feelings of Punjabis and their anger against this government that has not been able to punish the culprits,” he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T10:11:56.909+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
