A 13-yard Tyler Weathers run gave the Longhorns a 21-6 lead in the third quarter. Houston’s 43-yard touchdown run and Weathers’ 7-yard touchdown run in the fourth quarter, his second touchdown of the evening, put the game away.Kell improved to 4-2 on the season and 2-1 in Region 7 region (B). Cook has no plans to let up even with a bye week coming up.“We got an off week next week, “said Cook. “It won’t be an off week in any other way other than we don’t have a game. We will get after each other next week and get better, as well.”After starting the game with excellent field position, John Lampley gained 40 yards on a quarterback scramble that set up an Ivan Walls’ 1-yard touchdown to put the Longhorns ahead 7-0 with 9:35 left in the first quarter. North Springs (1-4, 0-2) responded with a 15-play drive that lasted over 5 minutes that ended with a Justin Ruiz 5-yard touchdown run to cut the lead to 7-6. The drive was highlighted by three fourth-down conversions, which consisted of a Kell penalty, a 15-yard run on a fake punt, and a 35-yard pass from Rees Viersen to Ruiz.That was the only bright spot for the Spartans, as Kell held North Springs to 155 total yards. They also had five sacks and four interceptions, one of which was returned 36 yards for a touchdown by Solon Page III to give the Longhorns a 14-6 halftime lead. Chandler Brown had two interceptions.Cook said he was pleased with how the defense was able to overcome early adversity. “That says a lot about the resiliency of our kids,” he said. “I’m really proud of them for that. Our defense has played well all season, no surprise there.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T10:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T09:51:59.436+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
