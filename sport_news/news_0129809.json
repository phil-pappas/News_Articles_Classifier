First-round pick Bobby Portis didn't play. \nMAKING PROGRESS: Bulls coach Fred Hoiberg said he was \"very encouraged\" by Derrick Rose during a solo workout earlier Tuesday. Rose took some contact, but Hoiberg didn't say when Rose (broken left orbital bone) would go through a full-contact practice. \nA STRONG FINISH: George gave the Pacers a 16-8 lead with 6:10 left in the first on his thunderous one-handed dunk after he rebounded his missed 3-pointer. \nUP NEXT: Indiana faces Charlotte on Thursday in Fort Wayne, Indiana. Chicago plays Dallas on Friday in Lincoln, Nebraska. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T05:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T06:23:13.162+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
