The group is a combined 5-for-37 in the series (including two pinch hits from Will Venable and Mike Napoli in the 14-inning marathon of Game 2). \nPrince Fielder, who anchored the Ranger lineup in the regular season by hitting .305 with 23 home runs and 98 RBI, is 1-for-12 in through three games. \nBut manager Jeff Banister isn’t losing his faith in the slugger, whose scorching line drive to the center fielder was the first out of the ninth inning Sunday. \n“I’m not going to start on Prince,” he said after the Rangers’ Game 3 loss. “The man barreled the baseball tonight. \n“What I know about Prince, guys like him… For every [hitless game], they’re one closer to getting hot.” \nFielder is slated in the No. 3 spot in the Texas order once again in Game 4 against knuckle-balling former Ranger R.A. Dickey. Prince has three hits, including a home run, in 13 career at-bats against Dickey. \nThe Rangers can hope Fielder makes the same contact he did in his final at-bat Sunday, but find grass instead of leather Monday. \nDerek Holland during his last regular season start (Photo: Jerome Miron-USA TODAY Sports) \nDutch Oven looks to stay hot \nDerek Holland takes the bump in Game 4 for Texas, trying to build off his last start. \nThe lefty put up a quality start in his last regular season outing after struggling in his previous four appearances. \n“The confidence is always there,” he said. “As players, we go through slumps. It’s just a matter of how you get out of them.” \nFor Holland, it was allowing just three hits in 6.1 innings of work in a win over the Angels. \nMonday’s matinee start won’t be the first big game for Holland. His last postseason start came in 2011, when he tossed eight shutout innings in Game 4 of the World Series at Globe Life Park.
