In fact, Connolly picked up his first point of the year, an assist, in the B's 6-2 win in Colorado on Wednesday, and played fairly well. But the Marchand-Bergeron chemistry is time-tested. His old line with Ryan Spooner and Jimmy Hayes took off with Chris Kelly on it. Ty Randell had a good night (a goal, plus-2) in the win in Denver on the fourth line. And Connolly wasn't going to supplant David Pastrnak on David Krejci's right side, though that shouldn't be ruled out in the future. Connolly also doesn't play the power-play or penalty kill.\nConnolly had not been playing so poorly that the Julien (ital.) had to scratch him, but all those factors made him the odd man out.\n“In my mind, he's still a good player,” said coach Claude Julien. “It's just that right now he's trying to find his game and we've got some spots where guys have played well, so it's hard to move anyone out right now. With Marchie coming back in, he's the one who's getting pushed aside for (last night).”\nWhile Connolly may not have been exactly thrilled with the development, he understood the thinking behind the move.\n“For me, it's being engaged the whole game,” said Connolly, the No. 6 overall pick in 2010 for the Lightning before being traded to Boston at the deadline last year for a pair of second round picks. “Spoons and Kells and Hayes had a really good game (against the Avs). Marchie comes back. The fourth line has a good game. It's part of the business. For me, I'm still looking to fit in somewhere on a line and I'm just going to keep working and things will work out.”...\nMarchand had a highly successfully return to action on Saturday. He scored a shorthanded goal in the first period and fired 10 pucks, half of which hit the net. His line with Bergeron and Loui Eriksson was dominant.\n“I felt good. I want to see how I felt, especially early on in kind of the rough stuff and I as happy with how I felt. I was happy to be back with the guy and it was a big win,” said Marchand.\nHe was cleared to play before the morning skate at Gila River Arena. With the way he had to be helped down the runway last Saturday after taking an inadvertent elbow from Montreal's Dale Weise, it appears that Marchand may have dodged a bullet by missing just the two games.\nBut he's keeping his fingers crossed, for good measure.\n“Any time you have a head injury, you're uncertain about how long it cold, even if the symptoms aren't that bad, they can go on for a long time. Any time you're in a situation like that and it doesn't last along time, you're definitely lucky,” said Marchand.\n“You want to (continue monitoring it), just to be safe. You look at (Red Wings' forward Johan) Franzen. His symptoms came back and he'd been off for a while. Things like this can come back at any time and you want to make sure that you don't try to play through things like that.”...\nThe game was a bit testy and, in the second period, Kevan Miller fought Joe Vitale, who'd been a bit of a thorn to the B's up until that point. Miller hit Vitale with a couple of bombs and, though Vitale gamely stayed on his feet, Miller's last right hand cross ended it. Vitale went to the box and stayed there for a few minutes, but at the next stoppage he left the game. He was taken to the hospital for x-rays...\nDennis Seidenberg, out since the start of training camp with back surgery, could start skating as early as this week. If all goes according to plan, he's expected back sometime next month...\nWhile the talk of the AHL has understandably been Frankie Vatrano and his seven goals in four games going into last night, there's been another development worth noting. Alexander Khokhlachev -- boxed out of the center position in Boston with Patrice Bergeron, David Krejci and Ryan Spooner ahead of him – had been playing on the right wing (his off wing) on the line with center Austin Czarnik and left wing Vatrano before Czarnik suffered an upper body injury on Friday. Going into last night's game, Khokhlachev had 2-5-7 totals in four games. If Khokhlachev's going to make the NHL in Boston, it just might have to be as wing instead of center...\nThe other scratches last night were Max Talbot and Zach Trotman.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T15:21:44.924+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
