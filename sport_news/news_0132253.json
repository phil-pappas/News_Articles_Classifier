You play a long, long season and when you get here anything can happen. I’m happy that we responded and played well. We just need to stay sharp.” \nWhere the Class 3A No. 8 Dragons (27-7) hope to be is in a showdown against two-time Class 2A state champion Providence in Saturday’s final round. The Pioneers will face Brownstown Central in their sectional opener on Thursday night in their first season in 3A after moving up this season due to the IHSAA “Success Factor” rule. \nSilver Creek tallied 11 aces in the contest, led by three apiece from Alex Falcone and Taylor Williams. Emily Reed slammed 11 kills on the night for Silver Creek. \n“I thought our serve was very aggressive,” Zimmerman said. “I thought we put them on their heels that way. And I thought our middle attack was very strong.” \nCharlestown (7-22), which loses just one senior in Danielle Miles, was led in kills by sophomore Bri Harvey with seven. The Pirates’ Molly Braunecker and Hannah Vincent each made six digs. \n“Silver Creek was a tough draw in the first round because they have a well-established program,” Pirates coach Tammy Nuxoll said. “We did not play our best tonight and struggled passing, but the girls did not give up. We were not able to get things going offensively. Danielle Miles had a good passing night. Despite the loss tonight, this is an improved team with a great group of girls. I’m proud of them and look forward to our future.” \nCLASS 3A CHARLESTOWN SECTIONAL \nSILVER CREEK 3, CHARLESTOWN 0 \nSilver Creek 25 25 25 \nCharlestown 12 16 15 \nMATCH LEADERS \nKills: Silver Creek — Emily Reed 11, Courtney Pierce 8, Alex Falcone 7, Bailee Popp 6; Charlestown — Bri Harvey 7, Emalee Craven 2, Danielle Miles 2. \nAces: Silver Creek — Al.
