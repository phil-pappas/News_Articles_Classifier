The heartbreak of getting so close to World Series glory cut deep many fans believing this was Chicago’s year.\nIt wasn’t quite the year Cubs faithful envisioned, but it wasn’t nearly as bad as pundits thought it would pan out either. Many thought Chicago would be in the middle of a rebuilding program this season, but this group of youngsters and a few wily veterans pulled together to become the story of baseball.\nIt will be hard to forget how the season ended, but here are some of the other moments Cubs fans will remember.\nThird-best record in baseball. Advancing to the #NLCS . There is so much to be proud of from this memorable season.\n https://t.co/0PyQjSXDdW\n— Chicago Cubs (@Cubs) October 22, 2015", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/Cubs/status/657039650511454208", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/NLCS?src=hash", "https://t.co/0PyQjSXDdW"], "published": "2015-10-23T07:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T12:55:24.873+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
