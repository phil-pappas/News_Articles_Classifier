Wilder said Powell cannot be prosecuted because prostitution is a misdemeanor with a one-year statute of limitations that has expired.\nUSA TODAY\nPitino: Resigning would be 'cowardly way out'\n“The book does not indicate that any of her daughters were not of legal age to undertake the activities they undertook,” Wilder told USA TODAY Sports Wednesday\nWhen asked about the matter a week ago, Louisville prosecutor Tom Wine told the Louisville Courier-Journal that if his office receives “credible evidence of … criminal activity involving minor children, we will vigorously prosecute those responsible for those crimes.”\nWilder said public statements and allegations about Powell facing possible criminal prosecution led her to Wilder.\n“She felt compelled to have an attorney that would be able to advise her in that regard,” said Wilder, who works near Louisville.\nEfforts to reach Powell and her daughters were unsuccessful.\nTHE COURIER-JOURNAL\nReport: Lyle confirms gist of book claims\nWilder said no official representing the government or law enforcement has contacted him or Powell about a possible investigation.\n“Potentially the government has come to the same conclusion that we have,” Wilder said, “that the facts don’t support this perception, or this perpetuation of this belief, that there were minors involved in illegal conduct.\n“Based on the facts, none of those daughters were underage at the time they engaged in conduct involving Mrs. Powell, involving all of these folks who are up in a hornet’s nest.”\nWilder said he spoke to Powell and the book's co-author, Dick Cady, but declined to comment on who else he might have spoken with.\nCONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": ["http://www.courier-journal.com/story/sports/college/louisville/2015/10/08/report-lyle-confirms-gist-of-breaking-cardinal-rules-allegations-against-louisville-basketball-are-true/73579700/", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/5b3cd9256a3484ff8674798dea4b57a748398d76/r=500x357/local/-/media/2015/10/14/USATODAY/USATODAY/635804460397185685-XXX-LARRY-WILDER-DEC-1223-76735428.JPG", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1RIPRBi&mini=true", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/c73e0b72fb0d890fc17cdb05ede8e65cb0efc714/c=297-0-1398-827&r=x404&c=534x401/local/-/media/2015/10/14/USATODAY/USATODAY/635804460397185685-XXX-LARRY-WILDER-DEC-1223-76735428.JPG", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/10/14/USATODAY/USATODAY/635804460397185685-XXX-LARRY-WILDER-DEC-1223-76735428.JPG", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1RIPRBi&text=Lawyer%3A%20Author%27s%20daughters%20in%20Louisville%20allegations%20were%20not%20underage&via=usatoday", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/f6af3125c24fed6c394ea7687d72200ae999e78e/c=0-12-534-546/local/-/media/Louisville/Louisville/2014/04/20/1398043519000-jaquanlyle.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9974f2cbe632270766c636dbfe528e8f557bdcd8/c=0-142-2995-3137/local/-/media/2015/03/29/Louisville/Louisville/635632557500934666-UofL15-SAM.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-15T03:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T02:17:06.760+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
