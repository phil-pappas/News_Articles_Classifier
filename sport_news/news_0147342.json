Badgers quarterback Scott Tolzien threw two interceptions returned for touchdowns by Kurt Coleman and Jermale Hines, Ray Small ran back a punt for a score and the Buckeyes won 31-13, even if Wisconsin outgained Ohio State by nearly 200 yards.\nNice try guy.\nThe next week Ohio State lost at Purdue, when, of course, I picked the Buckeyes to win.\nBack then I was looking for the same thing I'm looking for now - the Ohio State loss no one sees coming. That upset loss at Purdue was fueled by Boilermakers defensive end Ryan Kerrigan, a future NFL first-round draft pick, and a terrible day by a very good team that probably wasn't in the right place mentally.\nThose Buckeyes went on to beat Penn State and Iowa teams ranked in the top 15 at the end of the year, then win at Michigan. You remember the Rose Bowl victory against Chip Kelly and Oregon, as Ohio State finished 11-2 and ended the year ranked No. 5.\nPurdue went 5-7. The Boilermakers weren't better than Ohio State, but they beat them that day. Those Buckeyes seemed like they weren't quite right, kind of like these Buckeyes seem through four games.\nThat's the philosophy behind my pick for Indiana to upset the Buckeyes in Bloomington on Saturday, with No. 1 Ohio State a 21-point favorite over the 4-0 Hoosiers.\nHere first are more logical picks from Ari and Bill before my actual score. Vote for who you think will win in the poll below and give your score and thoughts on the game in the comments section.\nAri picks Ohio State 49, Indiana 24\nI'm the only one of the three of us who keeps thinking Ohio State is going to snap out of this offensive funk completely and drop 50 on someone. Well, I'm predicting that'll happen again this week, or at least one point shy of the half-century mark.\nIndiana has been off to a good start this year, but Ohio State's just so much more talented than the Hoosiers. And the fact that the Buckeyes stuck with Cardale Jones last week -- which I believe helped Ohio State's offense gel -- makes me think that this is the week the Buckeyes start looking like the national title team everyone expects.\nBill picks Ohio State 42 , Indiana 35\nI'm not ready to say Ohio State will lose this game, but I've felt this could be a tricky one before the season started, so I'm picking it close. Don't forget that Indiana had a late third-quarter lead on Ohio State with a lost, backup freshman quarterback playing on the road last season.\nThe Hoosiers will have Nate Sudfeld, and Jordan Howard and Ricky Jones and a good offensive line. I think they'll score some points on an Ohio State defense that looked a little vulnerable last week. They just won't score quite enough to keep up with Ohio State's offense against what's been somewhat of a porous Indiana defense.\nDoug picks Indiana 38, Ohio State 36\nMy five reasons the Ohio State opponent will win this week is filled with actual reasons, not just interesting stories and bad jokes.\nâ€¢ 5 reasons Indiana will beat Ohio State\nThe main idea is an Indiana offense I believe will move the ball through the air and on the ground and an Ohio State offense that will make enough key turnovers to help the Hoosiers' cause.\nThis is more about Ohio State than Indiana. Before the season I picked the Buckeyes to lose a regular-season game you didn't expect on their way to repeating as national champions. After watching how this season has unfolded, this is the best chance for that.\nI think Ohio State finding itself last week wasn't quite true. The Buckeyes looked better than in their 20-13 win over Northern Illinois, but Western Michigan, in a 26-point loss, made a few key mistakes that helped Ohio State. This Indiana offense is significantly better than that. While the Indiana defense has looked terrible, some pressure on the OSU offense, a few well-timed risks and some OSU mistakes and you have a home team with a shot.\nNorthern Illinois had that shot in week three and three times couldn't put a fourth-quarter drive together down just seven points. In a similar situation, in Bloomington, I think Indiana's offense can.\nSeason\nStraight up: Ari (4-0), Bill (4-0), Doug (4-0)\nAgainst the spread: Bill (3-1), Ari (2-2), Doug (1-3)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T19:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T13:51:34.598+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
