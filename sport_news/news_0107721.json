But the team game is more important to me. I’m just happy with how we are doing right now.” \nThe 23-year-old Russian had no goals and six assists in his first six games of the season. \nBackstrom, Marcus Johansson, Andre Burakovsky and Justin Williams also scored for Washington, and Philipp Grubauer made 19 saves in his first start of the season. Playing their third game in four nights, the Capitals improved to 6-1-0.
