Comment Posted Oct. 23, 2015 at 7:56 PM Updated at 8:02 PM Posted Oct. 23, 2015 at 7:56 PM Updated at 8:02 PM Claude Julien expressed his admiration for the New York Islanders’ fourth line – usually Matt Martin, Casey Cizikas and Cal Clutterbuck – on Thursday. The Bruins head coach had less to say about one of his own fourth-liners on Friday. Asked if he felt he had to have a discussion with winger Zac Rinaldo, who faced NHL suspension for a check thrown on Wednesday against the Flyers, Julien said, “If there’s a conversation, it’ll stay in our dressing room.” Rinaldo, suspended three times over four seasons with the Flyers, was assessed a major penalty for charging, plus a game misconduct, after dropping former teammate Sean Couturier with a solid shoulder check as time ran out in Wednesday’s first period. The NHL’s Department of Player Safety reviewed the play on Thursday, and determined that Rinaldo did nothing worthy of supplemental discipline. Julien hadn’t thought the check was suspension-worthy, either, but he didn’t think it was a very good play. Rinaldo forechecked the Flyers’ Claude Giroux into making a pass up the boards, then followed the puck along the wall and hit Couturier just after he one-touched the puck through B’s defenseman Adam McQuaid, who had moved in from the point to try to keep the puck in the offensive zone. “(Couturier) is already engaged in a battle (with McQuaid),” Julien said, “so from a coach’s perspective, I would have liked Zac to cover up for (McQuaid), who was pinching. “But the hit wasn’t necessarily meant to be a dirty hit.” Acquired from the Flyers on June 29 for a third-round draft pick in 2017, Rinaldo has been seen by many as a potential problem for the B’s due to his suspension history. Julien, however, thinks there’s more to Rinaldo than his rap sheet. “I think this guy’s got some skill,” Julien said before Wednesday’s game. “He skates well; he forechecks well. “As long as he doesn’t cross the line, I’m good with that. I want him to be physical. I want him to agitate whenever he can – within the rules, of course – and at the same time, I want to see him play hockey.” Around the boards: Winger Matt Beleskey, who didn’t play on Wednesday because of an undisclosed upper body injury, participated in the morning skate but missed his second straight game against the Isles Friday night. Max Talbot was the other forward scratched. ... Joe Morrow, who had missed three games with the flu, was taken off Injured Reserve and went back into the lineup. As a result, defenseman Zach Trotman was scratched for the sixth straight game. ... Bruins captain Zdeno Chara, who made his NHL debut as an Islander on Nov. 19, 1997, played the 1,200th game of his career.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T04:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T03:11:16.565+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
