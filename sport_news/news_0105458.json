Trojans players said Sarkisian “didn’t seem right” during a recent meeting, and others close to the program said he was unstable during a Sept. 26 win at Arizona State.\nThat fits the picture being painted of his days at Washington. Despite never having been publicly disciplined by Washington, his use of alcohol was an issue during his five seasons coaching the Huskies , according to the Los Angeles Times. After the August incident, some ex-players implied it was just par for the course.\nSarkisian after USC lost to Washington last week Photo: Getty Images “Coach Sark is still having fun at USC!” ex-Washington tight end Michael Hartvigson tweeted, with the hashtag #ThingsHaventChanged.\n“I would’ve made him run the stadium carrying a 6 pack since he wanna drink so much lol,” tweeted former Washington defensive lineman Danny Shelton (now on the Cleveland Browns), adding a sarcastic #shocked hashtag. In response, linebacker Shaq Thompson tweeted an emoji laughing and shedding tears.\nOne player told the LA Times that in Sarkisian’s debut season at Washington, he sometimes showed up to early-morning meetings “smelling like booze and (with) eyes all red, like he’s been on a bender.”\nTwo others said Sarkisian and other assistants regularly drank in the offices. One player said the coach often kept an 18-pack of Coors Light by his desk and was unusually loud and unsteady on some team flights.\nOffensive coordinator Clay Helton is serving as USC’s interim coach.
