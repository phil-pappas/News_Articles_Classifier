He has notched at least one point in all five games and sits atop the league’s leaderboard in scoring with four goals and nine points, tied with Detroit’s Henrik Zetterberg and St. Louis’ Vladimir Tarasenko.\nGranted, it’s a small sample size, but you have to start somewhere. It is the kind of start you would have hoped for from Krejci, provided he remained healthy. At 29, and after the experience of last season when he was limited to 47 games (about half of which he actually seemed like himself) due to groin and knee injuries, Krejci is savoring every game.\n“I want to play, right? So I’m doing everything I can to be able to play the next game. It’s been working and I’m happy that I’m doing well, the team’s doing well,” said Krejci, whose faceoff winning percentage is up to 53.5 from his career average of 50.3.\n“Last year was a tough year, watching half the season from the top,” he said. “It’s not fun. Now every time you’re on the bench before the game, listening to the national anthem, you kind of realize you’re playing, you’re living the dream. So you try to make the most of it and try to stay healthy, take it game-by-game.”\nA healthy Krejci is imperative for the Bruins to succeed. The B’s are built on strength at center with their 1-2 punch of Krejci and Patrice Bergeron. When Krejci was out last year and Carl Soderberg tried to step up a grade, the difference was noticeable.\n“(Krejci’s) been good, and he’s been feeling good,” said coach Claude Julien. “To me, he’s been such an important part of our team for a long time. It just goes to show how much we missed him last year.”\nHe and teammate Torey Krug, who both play up high on the first power-play unit, lead the league with five power-play points. Krejci hasn’t been shy about taking his shot, and has been reasonably successful in getting it through the traffic.\n“We’re passing the puck well, passing on the tape. We’re taking our shots, creating some rebounds, so it’s been working lately,” he said.\nKrejci still has some work to do before he’s happy with his all-round game. His new line with wingers David Pastrnak and Matt Beleskey has shown flashes but has been uneven at best. One of newcomer Beleskey’s best assets is his shot and, so far, he’s landed just four shots on net in five games, none in the last two. Being the kind of centerman who makes his linemates better, Krejci should help.\nHowever, the Bruins can’t live off the power play forever.\n“It’s been good, but I think we can still work on some stuff 5-on-5,” said Krejci of his line. “We have a good power play that’s working, so we have to keep working on that. But I feel like on 5-on-5 we can be a little bit better.”\nIf his line kicks it into gear, the B’s as a whole will be better.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T07:32:18.920+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
