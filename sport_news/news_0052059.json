They gave me a chance, so it’s on me to repay them as well. They showed a commitment to me, and now I’ve got to honor that, keep going out there and making it right. They gave me a chance. That’s how I’ll repay them.\"\nLewis has 30 carries for 146 yards and two touchdowns plus 15 receptions for 179 yards in three games, which isn't bad for a guy who didn't crack the stat sheet while recovering from a broken leg in 2013 and 2014. Lewis ranked third in yards from scrimmage among all running backs through three weeks, but he fell down the board a bit due to the Patriots' early bye.\nLewis was asked if the extension makes him feel a little more secure in his role.\n\"Not at all,\" Lewis replied. \"Anything can still happen, so just continue to do what I’ve been doing, come into work every day and just try to get better.\"\nIt's been a struggle for the 25-year-old to break through. The 2011 fifth-round draft pick already has more yards from scrimmage in his first three games as a Patriot than he did in his previous NFL stops, so he was asked if he has taken time to reflect on his past month.\n\"I don’t have time to think about that right now,\" Lewis said. \"I’ve got a game to prepare for, got to get ready for a tough defense in a hostile environment. I don’t really have time to think about that. I’m just focused on taking it day by day and getting ready for this opponent.\"\nNo celebratory cake?\n\"I don’t eat sweets,\" he said.\nLewis is a popular guy in the locker room, too, so his teammates welcomed the news of his extension.\n\"He’s a great player,\" tight end Rob Gronkowski said. \"He’s an excellent running back. His impact is huge. He comes out with a demeanor every time he steps out on the field.\"\nGronk was asked if he had any idea Lewis could be this good.\n\"I kind of knew,\" Gronkowski said. \"I’d be telling a couple of my friends all the time, ‘Man this new guy we picked up, he can move.’ His quickness and the way he makes guys miss is just unreal. I wish I could have those moves. ... I always wish.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T20:21:45.451+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
