(AP Photo/Efrem Lukatsky) more > By JAMES ELLINGWORTH - Associated Press   \nKIEV, Ukraine (AP) - Chelsea’s Champions League campaign hit more trouble Tuesday in a frustrating 0-0 draw against Dynamo Kiev in Group G. \nChelsea dominated the game and was unlucky not to score after hitting the woodwork twice through Eden Hazard and Willian. \nOn a chilly and breezy night in Ukraine, another good chance was missed by Nemanja Matic, who charged through the Dynamo defense but shot wide. \nChelsea coach Jose Mourinho said his team “had control of the game for 70, 75 minutes” and “we had everything but we didn’t score.” \nMourinho claimed Cesc Fabregas should have won a penalty when he went to ground in the Dynamo box in the first half. \n“It is a clear penalty,” Mourinho said. “The referee didn’t see it, the referee decided not to give it, I don’t know.” \nMourinho was recently fined and given a suspended stadium ban by the English Football Association after claiming officials were “afraid” to give Chelsea a penalty. \nIn Kiev, he was careful to avoid any suggestion that Slovenian referee Damir Skomina had been biased against Chelsea. “I think the referee was very good. I think he made one mistake,” Mourinho said. \nChelsea sits third in Group G at the halfway stage, one point and one place behind Dynamo. \nThe Ukrainian team came close when Vitaliy Buyalskiy and Derlis Gonzalez forced saves from Chelsea goalkeeper Asmir Begovic, who late on cut out a dangerous cross as Junior Moraes closed in. \n“I’m happy that we motivated ourselves to play against a very strong team,” Dynamo coach Serhiy Rebrov said. “I think the guys deserved praise.” \nDynamo had most of the possession, although on almost every other measure Chelsea was superior. \nMisplaced passes by Dynamo, especially in the first half, allowed Chelsea to launch dangerous counterattacks, one of which saw Matic storm through the center of the defense in the 21st minute, beating three players before sending a shot wide of the post. \nEarlier, in the first real chance of the game, Hazard had hit the far post, shooting on the rebound from a blocked effort by Fabregas. \nWillian’s set pieces also caused problems for an often nervous Dynamo defense that was coming off a 3-0 loss to its closest domestic rival, Shakhtar Donetsk. The Brazilian hit a 47th-minute free kick that struck the underside of the crossbar and bounced back toward a group of Chelsea players before being hurriedly cleared by Dynamo.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T00:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T02:14:32.423+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
