The newly refurbished Daly Field Athletic Complex is scheduled to open in Summer 2016.\n\"We are thrilled to participate in this dynamic partnership that not only exemplifies our commitment to girls and women by investing in athletics – an experience proven to positively impact women's leadership development – but also expands our core value of investing in the community,\" said Simmons College President Helen Drinan . \"Engaging in sports activities, regardless of level, is good for all.\"\nDaly Field consists of almost seven acres of parkland on the banks of the Charles River in Brighton . The new facility will feature several new amenities, including:\nNEW FIELD HOUSE – 3,200 square foot energy efficient building, including a sports medicine facility, team meeting rooms, and public restrooms TENNIS COURTS – Six fenced NCAA standard size courts for doubles play SOCCER & LACROSSE FIELDS – NCAA standard synthetic turf fields SOFTBALL DIAMOND – NCAA standard with clay infield and synthetic outfield FIELD HOCKEY – NCAA standard synthetic turf field FOOTBALL FIELD – MIAA standard high school synthetic turf field WALKING TRACK – A quarter mile, two-lane walking track SPORTS LIGHTING – Innovative and sustainable sports lighting system For more information about the Daly Field Athletic Complex, click here.\nAs part of a long-term strategy, Simmons had sought to boost the visibility and quality of its athletic programs, as well as recruit a greater number of student athletes for its programs. In 2011, the College was approached by community members in Allston and Brighton who were looking for a partner to help them renovate and refurbish Daly Field , a public field that has been in disrepair for more than 20 years.\nState Representative Michael Moran from Brighton and State Senator William Brownsberger from Belmont (whose district includes Allston and Brighton ) secured passage of legislation in August 2012 , which authorized the Allston-Brighton Friends of Daly Field, Inc. – a group of community, local business, and Simmons representatives – to lease the property from the state and which allowed Simmons to fund significant renovations for the project.\nBrighton High School – which has not played a home game in more than 25 years – is particularly excited about the project. \"It's a great opportunity,\" said Brighton High School Athletic Director and Football Coach Randolph Abraham . \"That means children are going to get to grow up being more active, having the kind of state-of-the-art facility you see in other communities, but clearly lacking in Brighton . \"\nTo follow the progress on Daly Field, click here.\n releases/simmons-college-allston-brighton-communities-set-to-renovate-daly-field-into-state-of-the-art-athletic-complex-300164790.html\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/simmons-college-allston-brighton-communities-set-to-renovate-daly-field-into-state-of-the-art-athletic-complex-300164790.html", "http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=DC35744&Transmission_Id=201510221228PR_NEWS_USPR_____DC35744&DateId=20151022", "http://www.simmons.edu/student-life/life-at-simmons/daly-field/progress", "http://www.simmons.edu/student-life/life-at-simmons/daly-field", "http://www.simmons.edu/"], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T20:05:04.909+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
