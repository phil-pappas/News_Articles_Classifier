(Bradley Leeb / AP) Tyler White adds to Illini's pile of injuries. \nIt’s becoming routine for Illinois. Another week, another injury. \nAt Penn State on Saturday, the Illini will be without tight end Tyler White, who suffered a knee injury early in the loss against Wisconsin. Interim coach Bill Cubit said he was expected to undergo an MRI later on Monday. \nThat complicates matters further for an already injury-depleted roster, Cubit said at his Monday morning news conference in Champaign. \n“We’ve got to be as creative as possible,” he said. \nThe Illini (4-3, 1-2 Big Ten) have been without running back Josh Ferguson, who also figures into the passing game and has been out the last two games and three quarters with a shoulder injury. “He’s been running better,” Cubit said, noting he would know more after Monday’s evaluations. \nThe Illini also are without tight end Tim Clary, who has been out the last four games with a hand injury and does not figure to return this season. Top receiver Mikey Dudek is out for the season and veteran Justin Hardee is likely following the same route. \nReceiver Marchie Murdock, who missed the Wisconsin game, will be evaluated this week after suffering a thigh contusion. \n“As coaches, we just have to keep finding different ways,” Cubit said. \nThe injuries are causing Illinois issues in the red zone, where the Illini rank last in the Big Ten. The Illini have converted on only 19 of 26 trips inside the 20-yard line, including 13 touchdowns. \n“Normally the tight ends cut off the edge pressure,” Cubit said. “It’s hard because you really need two of them. Right now it’s hard to even line up because of injuries. Once we get inside the 1- or 2-(yard line) we’re OK. That 12-(yard line) and in (area) is a little more difficult.” \nThe Illini don’t have many options at tight end. Backup Andrew Davis, a junior college transfer, isn’t likely to get on the field, and Cubit said they’ll likely use four-receiver sets. \n“I went over that personnel,” he said. “On Sunday I went down (the roster list), who else can help us mentally and physically? There’s just nothing else we can do. We’re constantly trying to find ways to get some game breakers out there.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T22:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T23:06:02.179+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
