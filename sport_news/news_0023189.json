The 34-year-old then struggled to fall pregnant for a second time, having to undergo surgery to clean out her womb and being warned that she’ll probably have to undergo a hysterectomy as soon as she has given birth. \nNow, Kim has revealed to her family that she might be suffering from gestational diabetes, with doctors also warning that she is at risk of developing pre-eclampsia again. \nIn the emotional scenes that aired during a promotional clip for Keeping Up With The Kardashians, Kim can be seen telling her mum, Kris Jenner, and older sister, Kourtney, about her health fears. \nFollowing a routine ultrasound, Kim is seen telling her concerned family: “The doctors saw more fluid than usual in my placenta, which can mean I have diabetes.” \nShe added: “Once you have pre-eclampsia you are at risk of having it again.” \nWith all of this trauma going on, it is no wonder that Kim recently described pregnancy as the “worst experience” of her life. \nWriting on her website, the star explained: “For me, pregnancy is the worst experience of my life! LOL! I don’t enjoy one moment of it and I don’t understand people who enjoy it. \n“Maybe it’s the swelling, the backaches or just the complete mindf*ck of how your body expands and nothing fits. I just always feel like I’m not in my own skin. \n“People just don’t tell you all of the gross things that happen during pregnancy or after. Do you know you basically have to wear a diaper for two months afterwards! LOL! No one told me that! #SoSexy [SIC]” \nSounds, erm, delightful. \nDon’t worry, babes, we are sure that your baby boy will be worth all of the hassle once December comes along.
