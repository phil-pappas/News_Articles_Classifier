(AP) -- A person familiar with the situation says Florida quarterback Will Grier has been suspended indefinitely for violating the NCAA's policy on banned drugs. The person spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because the school has not announced the decision. Grier is considering an appeal. The eighth-ranked Gators (6-0, 4-0 Southeastern Conference) have a news conference Monday afternoon and are expected to announce Grier's suspension. Grier, a freshman, has started the last five games for the Gators and would have started Saturday at No. 6 LSU (5-0, 3-0). Sophomore Treon Harris is expected to start in his place. Grier is the first Florida quarterback to pass for more than 200 yards in three consecutive games since Tim Tebow in 2009. Grier has completed 65.8 percent of his passes for 1,204 yards, with 10 touchdowns and three interceptions. Information below is not from the Associated Press, but from Florida's Monday news conference. Later developments on Monday indicated the suspension is for one year and the University of Florida plans to appeal.
