We looking to learn a lot.’’\nKrystkowiak says some players perform better in game situations than in practice and he’ll also be looking to see who plays well as his team shows off to its fans for the first time this season.\n“It’s no secret there’s guys that are always going to play a little better when the popcorn’s popping and the lights are on and being scrutinized a little more,’’ he said. “Unfortunately, there’s guys on the other side of the spectrum, who when things get a little more important, maybe have some breakdowns.’’\nWhen asked which team he wanted to win between the red and white squads Wednesday night, Krystkowiak said, “We’ll be undefeated. I’m a glass-half-full kind of guy and you can look at it either way — we’ll take the L or we’re going to take a W. We’ll stay positive.’’\nFollowing the conclusion of the scrimmage, the team will sign autographs and visit with their fans on the Huntsman Center court. Doors open at 5 p.m. before the scrimmage.\nSHOCKING FINISH: Ute sophomore forward Kyle Kuzma hails from Michigan and even has a Michigan logo on his left arm, among the many tattoos on his body. So he had a special interest in Saturday’s Michigan-Michigan State football game, featuring one of the most bizzare endings in college football history.\n“That was terrible,’’ he said. “That might have been one of the worst things I’ve ever seen. I don’t know what was worse, that, or the Colts’ fake punt (Sunday night). They were both boneheaded mistakes.’’\nHowever, Kuzma wasn’t that upset by the outcome.\n“I got a lot of friends on both teams, so I go more by friends than teams,’’ he said. “Growing up I was more of a fan of Michigan State. But I was just shocked like everybody else.’’\nNO EXPECTATIONS: After the Utes went 26-9 last year with a berth in the NCAA Sweet 16, big things are expected from this year’s Ute squad that returns nine of its top 11 scorers and has a pair of highly-touted junior college players.\nHowever, Krystkowiak says his team doesn’t have any expectations for the upcoming season.\n“As far as expectations go, we don’t have any expectations,’’ he said. “It’s a clean slate. We got a little taste of success last year, but that’s not a guarantee it’s going to happen again. I feel good about where we are, but there’ s still a tremendous amount of work we need to do. We have a lot of willing participants. But there’s a lot to be done.’’\nUTE NOTES: Chris Reyes, who started 33 of Utah’s 35 games last year, has been out for the past 10 days with a lower back injury. Krystkowiak was hoping he would practice Monday . . . The Utes were ranked No. 16 in the coaches preseason poll that came out last week . . . Utah’s four new players this year are JC transfers Gabe Bealer (6-6), Lorenzo Bonam (6-4) and freshmen Makol Mawien (6-9) and Brandon Miller (6-2) . . . Fans will get to view the new 3D full court projection video on Wednesday night . . . After Monday’s scrimmage, the Utes will next hit the floor on Nov. 5 for an exhibition game against Cal State Monterey Bay. The regular season opens Nov. 13 with a game against Southern Utah.", "external_links": ["http://deseretnews.sportsdirectinc.com/basketball/nba-teams.aspx?page=/data/nba/teams/team404101.html"], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T22:29:34.387+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
