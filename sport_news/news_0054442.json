With time running out, the Big Red drove 53 yards to set up a first-and-goal from the 10, but four consecutive incomplete passes by Robert Somborn turned the ball over on downs and Colgate ran out the clock.\nColgate (1-3) owned the first half, building a 21-7 lead at the break as Melville connected with Alex Greenawalt for a 12-yard first-quarter score and hit John Maddaluna for a 17-yard touchdown. Melville's 2-yard run in the third made it 28-7.\nCornell (0-3) got a 27-yard touchdown pass from Somborn to James Hubbard at the start of the fourth and Hagy's 1-yard plunge with 4:03 left made it 28-21.
