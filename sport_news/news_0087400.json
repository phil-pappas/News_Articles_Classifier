This morning, Peyton Siva Sr. told us he wants SEX SEX SEX, and a little bit later, Rick Pitino uploaded a post previewing Louisville’s basketball season, but who cares about that. The most interesting part is Rick’s vow not to resign and let Louisville fans down : \nFirst, above all, I’m sorry we all have to endure the pain of these allegations. I so appreciate your support and friendships. \nI will not resign and let you down. Someday I will walk away in celebration of many memorable years but that time is not now. I do not fight these accusations by others but rather turn the other cheek. Couldn’t do it at 33, but at 63 it’s the wise thing to do. Let’s let the investigators do their job and we will play basketball. \nOf course, he ends the post by mentioning the Pope and his famous words “We will let God judge.” \nAs BTI pointed out on Twitter, what Pitino fails to realize is by not resigning, he is letting down the portion of his fan base that wants to move past this scandal for a fresh start; however, we all know his ego will never let him do that. But that’s fine. If Rick did resign, he’d really be letting UK fans down. Calipari is 7-1 against him, after all. \nClick here to read the rest of Rick’s post, if you’d like.

If you go to a conference for work, do you pay the registration fees, hotel, meals, etc. yourself, or does your company pay those? \nThis is why I’m pretty certain that McGee wasn’t acting alone. Someone else was funding this. Not to mention that McGee made arrangements for Antonio Blakeney’s visit, three months after he went to work for UMKC. J-Kwon October 22, 2015 at 12:50 pm | Permalink \nI would agree with you. But I’ve also thought maybe he did pay for this out of his own pocket. If he was considered responsible for recruiting these guys, it would help him land him a more lucrative coaching job.

Mc October 22, 2015 at 1:03 pm | Permalink \nSo why would he have made a payment for Blakeney when he wasn’t even on the UL staff at that point as he landed a different job? There has to be someone else involved. 2bigblue4u October 22, 2015 at 12:15 pm | Permalink | Reply \nIs there any word on when the NCAA will announce their findings? My Faith in the NCAA is already very small but I have a feeling we are going to be severely disappointed with the punishment they give the UofL basketball program. Willis talkin bout October 22, 2015 at 12:16 pm | Permalink | Reply \nUofL needs a new President, and new AD, and a new Basketball Coach. Nothing will change until the first two are removed. So of course Pitino is going anywhere… Hopefully between the national media attention and the NCAA, some of the board members will see that change is needed. its almost a criminal organization at this point..

UL Beat Writers October 22, 2015 at 12:17 pm | Permalink | Reply \nCan anyone ask Pitino the questions: Who hired Andre McGee? Who did Andre McGee report to? Catlogic15 October 22, 2015 at 12:18 pm | Permalink | Reply \nWhat he fails to realize is that in this case, the NCAA is God. realme October 22, 2015 at 12:19 pm | Permalink | Reply \nI really would be fine with it if he would get struck by lightning today. This hypocritical lie fest has gone too far. BenHur October 22, 2015 at 12:20 pm | Permalink | Reply \nI hope they keep him. He’s a trainwreck and I can’t turn away from looking at it. The Obvious October 22, 2015 at 12:26 pm | Permalink | Reply \n2bigblue4u, The NCAA hasn’t even announced the findings of the UNC investigation that happened some 18 months ago about their over decade long academic fraud case! There is no end in sight or timetable. The NCAA is the worst run billion business in the country!
