Comment Posted Oct. 4, 2015 at 6:53 PM Updated at 6:53 PM Posted Oct. 4, 2015 at 6:53 PM BOSTON — Indecision doesn't have to be a bad thing. Tyler Randell and Joonas Kemppainen don't mind it at all these days. But then again, they're among the players who have forced the Bruins to take all the time allotted to decide how to structure their season-opening roster. Randell, a 2009 draftee (Round 6, No. 176 overall) with four minor-league seasons on his résumé, and Kemppainen, signed as a free agent after seven years in Finland's top pro league, were dark-horse candidates to earn roster spots. Randell has stuck around by combining toughness (three fights, 19 penalty minutes over four preseason games) with a bit of production (one goal, on Sept. 24 against the Rangers), while Kemppainen's size (6-foot-3, 223 pounds), hockey sense, and defensive abilities have made his first NHL bid a strong one. So what are the Bruins, currently carrying 14 forwards instead of their customary 13, to do? \"We haven't decided what we want to do, which direction we're going,\" coach Claude Julien said on Sunday. \"We've discussed a lot about players and everything else, but a final decision hasn't been made.\" The Bruins have until 5 p.m. on Tuesday to submit their final roster, which has a 23-player limit. There are currently 24 players (14 forwards, eight defensemen, two goalies) on the roster. That figure includes captain Zdeno Chara, still sidelined by an upper body injury, but doesn't count goalie Jonas Gustavsson, a tryout candidate. Julien has discussed the possibility of keeping eight defensemen — one more than the team usually carries — to start the season. If the B's go that way, the seven who practiced on Sunday would still be safe. Keeping two spare forwards instead of one would be unusual, but Randell, 24, and Kemppainen, 27, have made it hard for the B's to cut them. \"Hopefully, it keeps going the way it's going,\" said Randell, who hit career-highs in every category last season with 11 goals, 9 assists, 20 points, and 120 penalty minutes over 74 games for Providence in the AHL. \"I feel like I've given everything I've got.\" \"He's brought his game,\" Julien said of Randell, a 6-1, 198-pound candidate for a fourth-line role. \"He's done his job. He's played hockey when it's time to play hockey, and he's stood up for himself or his teammates when it was time to do that. Kemppainen didn't score any points over five preseason games but, skating between Chris Kelly, Randell, and occasionally veteran Max Talbot, he proved capable of winning faceoffs, controlling pucks, and killing penalties — the latter skill in short supply given the departures of free agents Gregory Campbell and Daniel Paille. \"It's nice to be here still,\" said Kemppainen, who, unlike Randell isn't subject to waivers if assigned to Providence. \"It's a little surprise, but here the game is a little more battling and skating than in Europe. I think it fits me better.\" Page 2 of 2 - In other news, Chara, injured on Sept. 24 against the Rangers, skated briefly on his own on Sunday, as he has since last Monday. \"He's still day to day,\" Julien said. \"I think he's getting very close to practicing with our team. It's looking like it's heading in that direction, but there's no guarantees.\" The Bruins are off on Monday, and scheduled to return to practice on Tuesday.
