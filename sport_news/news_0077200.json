(Photo: Adam Hunger-USA TODAY Sports) CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nBartolo Colon has shown to be a remarkable athlete for person of his size. But his feats come on the baseball field, where major leaguers usually wear cleated shoes in order to get traction. Once a ballplayer walks off the turf and onto another surface, he becomes a vulnerable human like the rest of us. \nCase in point: Sunday night after the Mets beat the Cubs in Game 2 of the NLCS at Citi Field, the players came off the field as is typical, and they walked through tunnels underneath the ballpark to their respective clubhouses. With the fans wildly cheering, and security personnel ushering Colon through like the champion beast that he is, he slipped on a metal grate and wiped out in front of everyone, falling face first to the concrete. \nThe original video , which was shot by a fan, has some foul language, so we re-uploaded with a bleep to cover it up: \"Oh, no!\" \nBecause he's so limber and nimble, Colon gets to his feet immediately and, brushing off the attempt at assistance by the elderly gentleman, he continues toward the clubhouse at an alarmingly brisk pace. Colon risks falling again, but he probably wanted to act as though nothing had happened/get out of there. And haven't we all been there? Falling down flat on our rear, or on our face, and hoping that somehow nobody saw us? Someone always sees. And these days, they're usually filming. \nNote, there's more than one angle to the Great Bartolo Col-lapse: \nOther than a possibly bruised ego, Colon appeared to be fine. He's become an important figure in the Mets bullpen, and probably is on standby to spot start if the Mets need him. He can't be falling down like this again. At least not where people can see.
