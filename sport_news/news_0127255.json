(AP Photo/Charlie Riedel) Seattle Seahawks running back Rod Smith (45) stiff-arms Kansas City... The Seattle Seahawks added some depth to their running back corps ahead of Sunday's game versus the Cincinnati Bengals, promoting undrafted rookie Rod Smith from the practice squad to the team's active roster.\nTo make room for Smith on the 53-man roster, Seattle placed cornerback Tharold Simon on injured reserve, ending his season. That came a day after Seahawks head coach Pete Carroll hinted a move might be coming.\n\"His nature has given him a toe that's got some issues and we've just got to work through it,\" Carroll said of the third-year cornerback. \"He's had surgery on his other foot. Same toe, same situation. So that's something we're trying to work through right now. We'll see whether that's necessary or not.\"\nThe 24-year-old Simon missed his entire rookie season with foot injuries.\nIn 2014, he appeared in 10 games and started five while dealing with knee and ankle injuries throughout the season. The 2013 fifth-round draft choice out of LSU ended the year with 18 total tackles, four passes defended and an interception.\nSimon sat out most of training camp this year after undergoing surgery to repair a separated shoulder. He played in the team's Week 2 loss versus the Green Bay Packers before suffering the toe injury.\nSmith, 23, signed with the Seahawks in May after going undrafted out of Ohio State. The 6-foot-3, 226-pounder rushed for 70 yards and 10 carries and caught six passes for 27 yards in the preseason. He was among the team's final cuts before signing to the practice squad.\nSmith will give Seattle some depth versus the Bengals after the team ruled out Marshawn Lynch for the second straight week with a hamstring injury. Veteran Fred Jackson was listed as questionable for Sunday's game after suffering a high ankle sprain in Monday night's win over the Detroit Lions.\nThomas Rawls, like Smith an undrafted rookie, should get his second career start in Cincinnati. Rawls has 157 rushing yards on 35 carries on the season.\nSix things to watch: Seahawks vs Bengals \nVisit seattlepi.com for more Seattle Seahawks news .
