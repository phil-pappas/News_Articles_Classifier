(AP) — New York Giants tight end Daniel Fells has been released from a hospital after being treated for nearly three weeks for MRSA. \nThe Giants announced on Tuesday that Fells left Hackensack University Medical Center, where he has been treated since Oct. 2. \nFells was diagnosed with the antibiotic-resistant bacteria that kills thousands a year a couple of days before the Giants were to play the Bills in Buffalo on Oct. 4. It was until almost two weeks later that he started feeling better and was able to sleep at night. \nEarlier in the season, Fells had an ankle injury. Coach Tom Coughlin said it became infected, but the team did not know how. \nThe Giants had their facility disinfected after the case was found and players were lectured about the illness. \nFells was been placed on season-ending injured reserve after his diagnosis. \n___ \nAP NFL website: www.pro32.ap.org and www.twitter.com/AP_NFL Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T23:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T00:16:51.658+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
