He was a target for the final cut Monday after missing the final three exhibition games with a stress reaction in his left leg. \nThe Mavericks went with experience in the frontcourt over the young Ndour, who averaged 16 points and 8.3 rebounds as a senior last season at Ohio. Dallas kept a third center in JaVale McGee even though the eighth-year player won’t be ready for several weeks because of a leg injury. \nDallas opens at Phoenix on Wednesday night.
