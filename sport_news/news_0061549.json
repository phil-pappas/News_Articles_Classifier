Hes our guy. Hes our leading target on offense.”\nKyle Whittingham\nSALT LAKE CITY — Utah receiver Kenneth Scott’s 30th career start was accompanied by the most real estate. The senior netted a career-high 116 yards receiving (on five catches including a touchdown) in last week’s 34-18 win over Arizona State.\n“We’re starting to get him targeted more and he’s responding,” said Whittingham, who noted that a one-handed grab that Scott made down the sideline against the Sun Devils may have been the best catch of the year.\nWhittingham added that the Utes need to get the ball to Scott more often. He’s currently third on the team with 21 receptions — trailing Devontae Booker (23) and Britain Covey (22).\n“Travis (Wilson) has a lot of confidence in Scotty and vice versa,” Whittingham said. “He’s our guy. He’s our leading target on offense.”\nScott, meanwhile, is maintaining a low-key approach.\n“I tell Travis whenever he feels the need to throw me the ball just throw it up and I’ll go do my best effort to go get it,” Scott said. “So it’s just a chemistry and trust we have in each other.”\nBACK TO THE MW: Utah officials announced via Twitter that the Utes have agreed to a home-and-home football series with former Mountain West Conference foe San Diego State. They'll meet Sept. 18, 2021 in San Diego and Sept. 17, 2022 in Salt Lake City.\nENJOYING IT: In his lengthy coaching career, Dennis Erickson has been part of several successful campaigns — including two national championship seasons at Miami. Understandably, Utah’s assistant coach is enjoying this one.\n“I’m having a lot of fun. This is such a good group of guys. They’ve really got great attitudes and coaches are doing a good job of coaching,” Erickson said. “But it’s fun when you win. I mean, there’s no question.”\nErickson added that this year’s Utes have the intangible of winning close games in different situations, showing a belief in what they’re doing.\nBIG VENUE: Utah linebacker Gionni Paul , who began his career at Miami, has played in several iconic stadiums across the country. On Saturday, he’ll put the 93,607-seat Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum on his list.\n“Just to add this one on my résumé feels real great,” he said.\nPaul enters the USC game as Utah’s leading tackler with 50 stops.\nEXTRA POINTS: If starting linebacker Jared Norris (undisclosed injury) is unable to play Saturday, senior Jason Whittingham is next up in the pecking order . . . Devontae Booker leads the nation with 26.83 rushes and 30.7 touches per game . . . Wilson is a finalist for the Johnny Unitas Golden Arm Award.\nEmail: dirk@desnews.com\nTwitter: @DirkFacer", "external_links": ["http://deseretnews.sportsdirectinc.com/football/ncaaf-teams.aspx?page=/data/ncaaf/teams/team93.html", "http://deseretnews.sportsdirectinc.com/football/ncaaf-teams.aspx?page=/data/ncaaf/teams/team71.html"], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T16:05:11.592+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
