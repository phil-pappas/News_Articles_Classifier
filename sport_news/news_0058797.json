Australia the complete package \nIf their demolition of England was a scintillating display in attack, this win against Wales was a masterclass in defence as the Australians came through a 10-minute spell unscathed in the second half, despite being reduced to 13 men. It suggests the Wallabies are the complete package and a force to be reckoned with heading into the quarter-finals. \n2. Wales cannot defeat Australia \nAustralia have now enjoyed 11 consecutive wins against Wales, who last tasted victory against the Wallabies in 2008. Warren Gatland's side could hardly have asked for a better opportunity either, enjoying more possession, territory, and even players in the second half but still failing to end the losing streak. \n3. Foley the real deal \nAustralia fly-half Bernard Foley scored 28 points against England last week and showed his nerves of steel against Wales too, kicking 15 points to carve out the win. Foley's all-round performances make him the stand-out number 10 of the tournament so far and suggests he is more than capable of leading his side to World Cup glory. \n4. Wales too blunt in attack \nWales took only three points from a dominant opening 20 minutes and when up two men in the second half seemed unsure how to take advantage. Gatland must find a way to make his side more clinical if they are to overcome South Africa in the last eight. \n5. The World Cup can survive without England \nEngland had hoped this would be a shootout match to join them in the quarter-finals but even with the hosts dead and buried, Twickenham produced an electric atmosphere to dispel concerns about flagging interest in the tournament. England may be out but their World Cup is still very much alive.
