The contracts were for technology hardware and services, a septic system replacement and for services for Latino families at some schools. Rosen asked multiple questions, including if work begins before the board is presented with the contracts.\nYousef Awwad, the district's chief financial officer, acknowledged the district has allowed services to begin before the board had signed off. In a later interview, Awwad, who started as the district's financial chief last fall , said that work may have moved forward before contracts were finalized in order to get services to students quickly, but that will change.\n\"Before the contract is approved by the board, we will not allow the service or the payment to take place,\" Awwad said. \"It's nothing unusual what (the board members) are asking for.\"\nA memo sent to staff earlier this month said the district's Purchasing & Contracting office will now review contracts before they are sent to the board for approval. In the past, the contracts could appear for the board's decision before being finalized. The change applies to revenue contracts or amendments that are above $25,000 and expenditure contracts over $150,000, which require board approval.\nNow, contractors and vendors won't begin work \"until contracts are fully executed,\" the memo reads. Copies of contracts and all relevant documentation will also be submitted to the board for review and staff must submit contracts a week before board meetings.\nState laws about public contracting leave decisions about how to approve procurements up to districts, said Matt Shelby, spokesman for the state Department of Administrative services.\n\"There is no umbrella statewide law that all public agencies have to abide by,\" he said. \"The state law basically empowers the board to set the policies.\"\nThe board's past practice does appear to be in violation of district rules about contracting authority. An administrative directive states that information about district contracts should be sent to the Purchasing & Contracting office \"within the necessary timeframes to assure Board review prior to the date necessary to begin work.\"\nBoard documents from recent months show instances where contract terms were dated ahead of the board meeting. For example, contracts from the board's April 14 meeting show contracts dated to start Jan. 1. One for equipment cost $1.6 million.\nRosen said in an interview the board has a responsibility to better monitor the district's financial choices. The district's business and operations committee, which Rosen is a member of, will discuss the district's purchasing manual during its next meeting Oct. 27.\n\"The process is broken,\" Rosen said. \"It needs to have some big changes.\"\nKim Sordyl, a district parent, has also raised concerns about contracting. She said she has filed complaints with multiple government agencies about independent contractors and other aspects of the district's practices.\n-- Laura Frazier\nlfrazier@oregonian.com\n503-294-4035\n@frazier_laura", "external_links": ["http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zh2XGrqbao", "https://twitter.com/frazier_laura", "http://www.pps.k12.or.us/news/9999.htm", "http://www.pps.k12.or.us/files/board/8.50.105-AD_Purchasing_and_Contracting_Delegation_of_Authority.pdf", "http://www.pps.k12.or.us/files/board/10-20-15_Businesss_Agenda_REVISED.pdf", "http://www.pps.k12.or.us/files/purchasing-contracting/PPS_Public_Contracting_Rules_121712.pdf", "http://www.pps.k12.or.us/files/board/04-14-15_Final_Packet.pdf", "http://www.oregon.gov/das/pages/index.aspx", "http://www.pps.k12.or.us/files/board/Business_Ops_Agenda_10_27.pdf"], "published": "2015-10-24T02:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T11:49:05.667+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
