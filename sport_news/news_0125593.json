There's a lot to like these days about Kurt Busch as a driver and teammate. Certainly the members of the Stewart-Haas Racing organization agree with that.\nAdChoices So apparently do the people who sponsor Busch. A long association with the makers of Monster energy drink, including through brother Kyle Busch in NASCAR's second-level series, now becomes one in the sport's highest competition. Wednesday's announcement of a long-term deal for Busch with Stewart-Haas included Monster sponsorship deal for his No. 41 car in Sprint Cup.\nMORE: Stewart-Haas drivers | What drivers need at Talladega | Joey Logano, beware\nBusch is a driver whose expertise is appreciated by his teammates. He also is known for his prickly side, which has led Busch to trouble several times in his career.\nNow, everything is hunky-dory at Stewart-Haas.\n\"This is exactly where I want to be,\" Busch said during Wednesday's media event, \"and I have two partners who want to win as much as I do.\"\nNice lookin' ride, @KurtBusch pic.twitter.com/rJd1XH1Auk\n— #TheChase (@NASCAR) October 21, 2015 Busch called it \"a dream come true.\" He is correct in saying a lot of good things have happened in a short time with Stewart-Haas. And the team has been good for Busch as well.\nCo-owner Gene Haas sponsored Busch's car while Busch worked with Monster to secure its Cup car commitment. Win-win, starting two weeks from now at Martinsville.\nStewart told media members he values having Busch with his organization.\n\"I've always respected Kurt's talent and determination,\" Stewart said. \"Kurt can win at every racetrack we visit, and his feedback and attention to detail make our entire organization better.\"\nClearly, Stewart-Haas has power. It will lose Stewart, whose days as a Cup contender are over and whose final season will be 2016. But it also has defending Cup champion Kevin Harvick, who is again making a run, in addition to Busch. While it might never get championship performance from Danica Patrick, it will add Clint Bowyer, 2012's runner-up, as Stewart's replacement.\nSHR is the equal to Hendrick Motorsports, Joe Gibbs Racing and Team Penske. That's power.\nSo I guess we picked the right date to be talking about our future. #BackToFutureDay pic.twitter.com/qsBqZTIwmG\n— Kurt Busch (@KurtBusch) October 21, 2015 After missing this season's first three races under suspension in a domestic furor with his former girlfriend, Busch came into his own. He won at Michigan and Richmond, nearly won at Fontana and Phoenix and continues to pile on top-10 finishes. He always has had talent, just like brother Kyle. He is finding ways to compete while avoiding trouble on the track.\nNow, Busch is focused. Mature, even. Plus, there is a solid support system that includes crew chief Tony Gibson.\nGone — hopefully forever — are the days of sour attitude that poisoned his relationship with Penske. Gone, too, are the run-ins with media members and tirades on team radio.\nAt 37, Busch has funneled his talent into success. He is earning respect. And he has his priorities in proper order.\nGood for him. Stockcar racing is at its best when its best drivers are producing headlines on the track for great effort and victories. Busch is doing just that — competing as a champion.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.sportingnews.com/nascar-news/4658868-kurt-busch-stewart-haas-racing-contract-extension-no-41-chevrolet-monster-energy", "https://twitter.com/KurtBusch", "https://t.co/rJd1XH1Auk", "https://twitter.com/KurtBusch/status/656934026457034752", "http://www.sportingnews.com/nascar-news/4658808-nascar-chase-clinching-scenarios-talladega-what-drivers-need-to-move-on-earnhardt", "https://t.co/qsBqZTIwmG", "http://www.sportingnews.com/", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/BackToFutureDay?src=hash", "http://www.sportingnews.com/nascar-news/4658682-joey-logano-matt-kenseth-wreck-kansas-retaliation-chase-joe-gibbs-racing", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "https://twitter.com/NASCAR/status/656867748568563712", "http://www.sportingnews.com/photos/4658865-stewart-haas-racing-drivers-tony-stewart-kevin-harvick-kurt-busch-danica-patrick"], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T04:27:49.070+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
