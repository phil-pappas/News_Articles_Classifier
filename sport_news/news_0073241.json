As Zach Mills prepares to break the program record for rushing yards in a season (he has 1,921 yards and needs 40 to break Joe Spegal's mark set last season), it's the guys up front who have made it possible heading into the Eagles' sectional opener Friday at Greenfield-Central. \nA hallmark of coach Grant Zgunda's best teams is that they win the battle in the trenches, but he just didn't know this group would be one to do it so often. \n\"If you would’ve told me sitting here with this group (that we'd be where we are), I would’ve said I don’t think so,\" Zgunda said. \"And I don’t mean that in a bad way, I mean it in a good way. These guys have all worked extremely hard.\" \nThe leader is 6-foot-5, 270-pound senior Kaleb Slaven, who committed to Ball State in the summer. Slaven's leadership, as Zgunda noted, has been crucial, as the converted tight end was the only one with experience. \nTrace Hernly was good enough to start as a sophomore last season, but the longtime center had to wait until a spot opened up. At this time last season, Sam Williams, a tight end, was a 160-pound tennis player capable of bench pressing 115 pounds. Fast forward 12 months — after his lifting partner, Slaven, convinced him to return to a sport he played when he was younger — and he's 197 pounds, capable of benching 250. \nDustin Reynolds starts at guard after playing linebacker last season, making the transition from taking on blocks to dishing them out. Jacob Robertson, a 6-4, 270-pound senior, has steadily improved at tackle, as has Adam Gibson filling in at guard. Fullback Logan Clawson gives the Eagles a running threat aside from Mills, in addition to his blocking ability. \nThen there's Brady Kowalski, all 165 pounds of him. \nAfter transferring from Penn — a perennial football power near South Bend — he weighed 240 pounds. He had stopped playing football because he would've been buried on the depth chart at Penn, but he got back into it and dropped the weight. Still as a senior, he was, as Zgunda put it, \"staring down the barrel of, ‘Am I ever going to play?’\" \nBut then senior Ryan George got into a car accident two weeks ago and suffered a concussion, ending his season. That thrust Kowalski onto the field. \n\"I know when I came into practice a few Wednesdays ago,\" Kowalski said, \"I was excited to hear I was playing, despite losing Ryan. I mean, he’s a close friend.\" \nIt's also helped having two offensive line coaches — Jim Thompson, a 30-year veteran; and Chris Overholt, a 2001 Delta graduate — working with the offensive line, a luxury Zgunda has never had. When the Eagles do their \"Hog Huddles\" — a short, animated speech given by Slaven to the offensive line and tight ends — shortly before the start of every game, they emerge as cohesive a unit as Zgunda can remember in recent years at Delta. \nHaving the shifty Mills helps, no doubt — \"He powers through everything, I’ll tell you that,\" Reynolds said — but no one can do it alone. \n\"It isn’t perfect, but it gets better every week,\" Slaven said of the line's performance. \nPerhaps there's no greater endorsement than from a former All-ACC offensive lineman at North Carolina. That would be Kyle Ralph, the head coach of defending state champion New Palestine. \nZgunda said he's gotten compliments from every opposing coach this season about how physical the Eagles (6-3) were. But Ralph's comments came after the Eagles scored 29 points, the third most the Dragons have allowed in Ralph's 38 games as coach. \n“He couldn’t talk enough about them to me,\" Zgunda said. \"He even sent me an email on Monday about it. … He was just saying, ‘You guys were so physical up front.’” \nJust as Zgunda envisioned. 74 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN 1 COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://tspne.ws/1RZUVS0 TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T03:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T08:57:40.765+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
