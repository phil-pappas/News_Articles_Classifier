It would’ve given the Polar Bears a commanding two games to none lead. \nInstead, the Fliers won the next four points to tie the match, seized momentum, and topped Margaretta, 22-25, 25-23, 25-23, 25-22, in Sandusky Bay Conference action. \n“This was a very intense match,” Clyde coach Betty Hasselbach said. “We told the kids that volleyball is a game of emotion and you can’t give the momentum and emotion away. We did and Margaretta just kept coming back. That wasn’t good. We have to keep the momentum. We, at times, played not to lose. We needed to play to win.” \nClyde (11-11 overall, 6-6 SBC) won seven of the last eight points of the second game behind solid hitting of Heidi Marshall and Maddie Greenslade. A kill by each tied the match at a game apiece. \n“When it came down to it, we let momentum get the best of us,” Strause said. “We dug too big of a hole.” \nAs the teams entered the third game, it felt like the winner of the game would seize control of the match and the Polar Bears (9-11, 3-7) jumped ahead 18-15. Facing a deficit, the Fliers went to work. A hitting error by Margaretta gave the serve to Alicia Carter-Koonce, who Hasselbach acknowledged had just starting serving again after an injury. Carter-Koonce served five consecutive points to put Clyde ahead, 21-18. The Polar Bears fought back and went back-and-forth with Clyde until the Fliers led, 24-22. Michaela Eisenhauer smacked one of her whopping 28 kills to cut the lead in half but yet another hitting error by the Polar Bears gave Clyde the game. \n“After Eisenhauer got going, we made an adjustment to put Maddie Greenslade on her,” said Hasselbach. “We felt Maddie was doing better blocking than Bri Huether. Once we made that change, it was a big difference in the match.” \nThe fourth game was similar to the others in the high level of play. Clyde looked to run away with it with a 15-8 lead but two kills by Eisenhauer and an ace from Macey Strause kept Margaretta alive. The Polar Bears got within 20-18 but four straight points from Clyde put them on match point. Without any timeouts remaining, Margaretta put four straight points together, prompting a timeout from Hasselbach. A kill, however, by Marshall ended the match. \n“We have such a young team with no seniors,” coach Strause said. “It’s hard getting consistency.” \nEisenhauer added 32 digs while Macy Strause had 40 assists and Alex Michel tallied 29 digs. \n“Michaela is an awesome player,” coach Strause said. “She’s key for us and one of the best all-around players I’ve ever coached or played against.” \nJenna Hoppe had 48 digs for Clyde while Marshall had 36 digs and 14 kills. Grace Borden got off to a slow start but finished with 15 kills while Greenslade had eight kills and seven blocks. \n“I can’t talk enough about Maddie Greenslade,” Hasselbach said. “She came in when Jacey Groover goes out with an injury and she’s played lights out. Talk about a coachable player. She files away what we tell her and comes up big. I can’t talk enough about Heidi Marshall either. She’s all over the place and the quickest player I’ve ever seen. Grace Borden is such a thinker and usually comes up with the right spot to put the ball. This was a high caliber of opponent to face before tournament next week and we’re happy with getting the win on the road.” Read or Share this story: http://ohne.ws/1RLrGCd TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T06:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T09:28:57.058+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
