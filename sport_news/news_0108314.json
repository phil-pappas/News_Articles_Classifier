Yet, seconds later, Nicoas Otamendi hammered the ball home off defender Andreas Christensen. \nThen, with just a few minutes left, Fabian Johnson brought down Sergio Aguero in the box. The Argentine then got up and tucked the ball home for 2-1. \nCristiano Ronaldo scored his 500th career goal as Real Madrid kept top spot in Group A with a 2-0 win at 10-man Malmo. \nRonaldo broke the offside trap to latch onto Isco's fine through-ball before coolly finishing over Malmo goalkeeper Johan Wiland from 15 yards out, with the strike also taking him level with Raul on 66 Champions League goals for Los Blancos. \nWiland made a superb late stop from Ronaldo but Malmo played out the final 10 minutes a man down as Yoshimar Yotun was given his marching orders with a second booking, before Ronaldo added another to overtake Raul's record. \nLast season's Champions League finalists Juventus earned a hard-fought 2-0 home win against Sevilla to take firm control of Group D. \nSevilla -- winners of the past two Europa League trophies -- showed their European pedigree early on in Turin, but Alvaro Morata rose above two markers to head Andrea Barzagli's cross past Sergio Rico 41 minutes in. \nRico then denied Paulo Dybala with a superb low stop just after the break, but a fine late finish from in-form Simone Zaza made it two wins from two for Juve in Europe to temporarily forget their poor domestic form. \nParis Saint-Germain eased to a 3-0 win at Shakhtar Donetsk to keep up the pressure on Real Madrid in Group A \nSerge Aurier opened the scoring for the French champions after just five minutes, rising well to head home a fine cross from Maxwell. \nDavid Luiz then made it two as a corner was headed on and the ball deflected off his thigh high into the top corner of the net, before Darijo Srna netted an own goal at the death to cap a disappointing defeat for the hosts. \nCSKA Moscow survived a PSV Eindhoven fightback to earn a tense 3-2 victory in Russia. \nCSKA forward Ahmed Musa turned the ball home for the hosts seven minutes in after being left unmarked to meet Zoran Tosic's near-post corner, and Seydou Doumbia rose to brilliantly to head home and double the hosts' lead 21 minutes in. \nDoumbia made it three from the penalty spot 10 minutes from the interval after PSV keeper Jeroen Zoet felled Tosic, but missed a superb chance to complete a first-half hat trick, shanking another spot kick over two minutes from the interval. \nPSV rallied after the break with Maxime Lestienne tapping home from close range on the hour before firing a superb 18-yard effort into the top corner with 22 minutes remaining, but the comeback stalled as Santiago Arias was sent off late on for a second bookable offence. \nAtletico Madrid slumped to a shock 2-1 home defeat against Benfica having initially led at the Calderon. \n- \nFollow Joy Sports on Twitter: @Joy997FM.
