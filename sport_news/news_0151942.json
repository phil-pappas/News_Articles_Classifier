It's my happy place.\" \nRELATED: Liberty's Cailey Sanchez gets best of childhood soccer coach \nChambers, who also scored against Dieruff on Sept. 26, started the season coming off the bench but now has found a spot in the starting lineup. \n\"I'm kind of nervous but I've gotten used to it,\" Chambers said about playing varsity as a freshman. \nThe victory improved the Hurricanes' record to 7-5 on the season. Chambers hopes it can help them get closer to where they want to be at the end of the season. \n\"Our goals are to make league and district playoffs. This is going to help us,\" Chambers said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T07:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T01:52:37.641+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
