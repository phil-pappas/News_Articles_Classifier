Not only was it the third time in their first six games the Senators drew a No. 2 'tender, but a quick count shows that last season, they faced backups a grand total of 33 times. \nAsked after the morning skate if using Hutton against Ottawa was a plan or a \"feel,\" Laviolette explained his rational. \n\"This one probably a little bit planned,\" he said. \"Carter had an excellent training camp, he played really good in some of the games. He looked sharp. This is an opportunity to get him in on the road trip, and I've got guys that are excited to have him in there, and have a lot of faith in Carter to get the job done. \n\"You've got to find the right spot, and this seems to be a good spot to do it.\" \nHutton, an undrafted 29-year-old, lost his final three starts last season, including two in overtime. He finished with a 6-7-4 record, as well as a .902 save percentage and 2.61 goals against average. \nRinne, who has won more than 40 games twice in his sparkling seven-year career, is off to a strong start in 2015-16. He has won three of four games while posting a .944 sae percentage and 1.51 GAA. \n\"Typically, Carter draws a lot of tough starts,\" said Laviolette. \"You go to L.A. and play them one night, and you play in Anaheim the next day at 5 p.m. ... he draws a lot of those situations. This is a good spot for him to be in where our guys are ready, we're fresh, had a day off yesterday and I think it's important to make sure Pekka gets his rest as well. That's why we have two goalies.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T07:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T09:39:38.741+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
