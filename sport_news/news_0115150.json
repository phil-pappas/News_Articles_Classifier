Prince Charming in English). We then have a second profile with low openness, and low extroversion, agreeability, and conscientiousness, the minus X factor which we’ve called Zmeul (e.n. TheDragon in English),” said team coordinator Daniel David, cited by local Mediafax .\nThe Prince Charming profile is associated with people with higher education, aged between 30 and 50, and the other profile is more frequent among people with a lower level of education, aged between 14 and 19, and over 60.\nAccording to Daniel David, the two profiles are almost equally distributed in Romania. They are not positive or negative, they only have a negative or positive potential that realises depending on the outside environment.\n“The transformation (of these profiles) in functional social behaviors depends on the socio-cultural institutions that exist in Romania. If the institutions are bad, the X plus profile won’t be able to express itself while the emotional instability of the X minus profile will increase,” David said. He explained that understanding this bipolar personality structure is not aimed at changing it, but at creating modern socio-cultural institutions to maximise each profile’s potential. “This is the major challenge we have as a country,” he added.\nHe also said that this bipolar structure also had a series of advantages. “In an insecure world, full of dangers, this bipolar structure makes us be less influenced by the action of several negative forces on the system, which is a good thing. In a world without dangers, this structure would not help us very much.”\nThe psychologist added that, in a globalized world, where countries interact more and more, it is necessary to understand the psycho-cultural profiles as “it can contribute to a better communication between different countries and cultures and to avoiding conflicts.”\nThe study was made by psychologists from Babes-Bolyai University in Cluj-Napoca and Bucharest University. The study’s results will be published in November in the “Romanian Journal of Applied Psychology”.\nThree quarters of Romanians see themselves European citizens\nItalians say Romanians, least hard working Europeans while Greeks see themselves most hard working\nLars Lund: Romanians are too hard on themselves.
