(AP) — Florida State defensive back Tre Marshall is expected to miss the rest of the regular season due to a biceps injury. \nCoach Jimbo Fisher confirmed during his Monday press conference that the sophomore would have surgery. Marshall, who has started all six games for the ninth-ranked Seminoles, was injured during the first quarter of last Saturday’s 41-21 win over Louisville. \nMarshall is tied for sixth on the team in tackles with 21 and was one of Florida State’s top run defenders. \nThe Seminoles (6-0, 4-0 Atlantic Coast Conference) face Georgia Tech (2-5, 0-4 ACC) on Saturday, who lead the conference in rushing yards (286.6 yards per game). \nTyler Hunter and Javien Elliott are expected to step in for Marshall.
