Posted: Friday, October 2, 2015 11:57 pm | Updated: 12:01 am, Sat Oct 3, 2015. Tigers take a 1 point win in thriller BY JORDAN MOSS Tribune sports   For the second week in a row the Mount Pleasant Tigers walked off the field with a victory. The Tigers (2-0, 2-3) defeated Sulphur Springs (0-1, 0-5) in a 31-30 thriller on Friday night to move to 2-0 in district play. The Tigers took the lead with 3:13 to play in the fourth quarter when Travois Holloman broke off a 69-yard touchdown run to give Mount Pleasant a 31-24 lead. The Sulphur Springs Wildcats showed that they were far from finished as they drove down the field and scored a touchdown with just :59 seconds left in the game. The Wildcats committed a false start before the extra point attempt and then missed the kick leaving Mount Pleasant with a 31-30 lead. The Wildcats defense held Mount Pleasant and kept burning its timeouts hoping to get the ball back for one last chance. A defensive holding penalty on a third-and-18 gave the Tiger a first down and sealed the victory for Mount Pleasant. Holloman had another spectacular night for the Tigers tallying 415 yards on 45 carries for four rushing touchdowns. The Tigers star back gave a work-horse effort and once again carried the Mount Pleasant offense. The Tigers started off the game turning the ball over on downs with a failed attempt at a fake punt on their first offensive series of the night. Sulphur Springs had a nice drive going moving the ball from their own 47 yard line down to the 11 of Mount Pleasant when Parker Dyke intercepted a pass from Wildcats quarterback Tanner Ramirez to give the Tiger the ball back. Holloman made Sulphur Springs pay immediately with a 67-yard touchdown run for his first score of the night to give the Tigers a 7-0 lead with 4:50 to go in the first quarter. The Wildcats respond 10 plays later with a touchdown run of their own to even things up 7-7. Mount Pleasant fell behind for the first time in the game when Kyle Reynolds’ pass was intercepted and returned for a touchdown to give Sulphur Springs a 14-7 lead. The Tigers were forced to punt on their next possession and a bad snap gave the Wildcats the ball on the Tigers’ two yard line and set up an easy score. Sulphur Springs led 21-7 at the break. A failed goal from Sammy Puente brought the Tigers to within two scores down 21-10 with 9:10 to go in the third. The Mount Pleasant defense forced a Wildcat three and out giving the Tigers a chance to cut the lead more. The offense responded by marching 53-yards down the field capped off by Holloman’s second touchdown to make it 21-17. Late in the third quarter Sulphur Springs hit a field goal to go up 24-17. The Tigers were forced to punt but the defense came up big when Asheton Brown intercepted the ball. Holloman found the end zone for a third tie on a 26-yard rushing score putting Mount Pleasant even on the board at 24-24 with 6:59 to play. After trading the ball back and forth, Holloman put the Tigers up for good with a fourth TD on a 69-yard run. The Tigers will next be in action at 7:30 p.m. Oct. 9 when they host Hallsville at Sam Parker Field.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T07:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T21:00:00.748+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
