The powerbrokers of the club have since convinced the experienced club administrator to rescind his decision. \n“I met the board a couple of days ago and they asked me to stay on for a minimum of six months to re-align the club now we are going to Africa,” he told Joy Sports . \n“It’s not a done deal yet, they are still tightening the screws to keep me for at least another season.” \n“We are still talking but we haven’t reached any decision point yet.” \nFianoo also hinted at the possibility of staying beyond the six months provided certain demands were met. \n“There is a possibility [of staying beyond six months], but they have to come with a lot on the table not necessarily financially but I think a lot of energy has been taken away from me on this club business that’s why I need rest. They’ve asked me to stay for six months, we’ll see what happens after the six months. \nAshantigold will be Ghana’s sole representative at the CAF Champions League next season. \n- \nFollow Joy Sports on Twitter: @Joy997FM.
