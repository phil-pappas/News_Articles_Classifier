Really, in the first half I was too amped up and overthrowing the guys and not putting the ball where it needs to be. In the second half I came in relaxed and started putting the ball where it needs to be. I just started playing my game and having fun again.” \nBoston College entered the game ranked as the nation’s top defense, giving up just 140.2 yards per game, and had given up just 592 total yards through the air through the first six games. Watson almost matched that output himself as the Tigers rolled up 532 total yards. \n“It's not every game you get to play against the number one defense in the country. We had that opportunity and we wanted to show that we could score points and show what we have and that's what we did,” he said. “They (the Clemson coaches) have been doing a good job of putting me in the right position to make plays and find my receivers. My receivers have been doing a good job of finding the open void and getting open and getting the ball. They've been catching the ball and making plays after the catch. And the offensive line did a good job of giving me a little time and letting me release the ball. We are getting better each week.” \nThe Tigers stand at 6-0, but Watson said no one is satisfied with what has been accomplished. \n“I feel good where we are, but I am not satisfied. No one on this team is satisfied, and 6-0 doesn't mean anything. It's just a record,” Watson said. “It's a one-game season for us. Now we are going to focus on Miami. For us this is just a confidence booster. We know that we can be very explosive. We missed a lot of opportunities in the first half that could have been touchdowns. It is little things we can fix. We can get back to the basics and details Monday and get better.” The McFadden trophy winner and Dabo getting one last shot with the @TwitterMirror #Clemson pic.twitter.com/OZArUt0Fox — Clemson Football (@ClemsonFB) October 18, 2015 Rate this Story: Send Feedback to David Hood: Email | Comment", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T08:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T09:28:34.297+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
