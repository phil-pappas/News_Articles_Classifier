And this latest tweak may not be permanent either.\n  \"We're still trying to figure out how to best utilize our guys,\" Snyder said after shootaround. \"That's been a process.\"\nIf Burke and Burks do end up primarily coming off the bench during the regular season, the decision won't have been a demotion based on their preseason play. Burks has averaged 12.7 points and 5.3 rebounds per game. Burke, meanwhile, has led the Jazz in scoring while shooting 48.2 percent from the field.\n\"I just think Trey's playing good,\" Snyder said. \"He's been one of our better players throughout the preseason. He's been focused, he's defended.\"\nThe Jazz have one of the NBA's youngest rosters and Snyder has said he might look to hide some of that youth in the starting lineup, where more veteran players might help cover up some mistakes.\nThe move also inserts Hood, who Snyder said \"may be playing as well as anybody on our team,\" into the starting lineup, where his outside shooting could help provide more space for Derrick Favors and Rudy Gobert inside.\n\nCoach on a couch\nMike Malone had a little extra free time last spring.\n\"At that time I had a lot of time to watch games because I was fired,\" said the new Denver Nuggets coach, who was bounced from Sacramento last season. And Malone found himself enjoying watching the Utah Jazz.\n\"I thought they played harder than a lot of people,\" he said. \"People talk about passing and ball handling. Playing hard is a skill. I think this team has taken on Quin's personality of hard work, demanding toughness. I wasn't really surprised, and it was great to see.\"\n\nOne Singler day\nE.J. Singler, we never knew ye. A day after the Jazz signed the the 6-foot-6 Oregon product, the Jazz waived him. Singler's deal was procedural to give the Jazz his D-League rights. Singler, the younger brother of Oklahoma City Thunder forward Kyle Singler, spent last season playing in Estonia, where he averaged 6.9 points and 3.9 rebounds per game.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T15:17:09.656+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
