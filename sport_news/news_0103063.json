It won’t be easy to replace the left tackle, who will reportedly have surgery on his torn right biceps. There’s no doubt that the loss of Solder is a big blow, but it’s nothing new to the Patriots. “Very tough. Nate’s a big part of the team. He’s done very well for us,” Julian Edelman said. “He’s a great locker-room guy. But this happens year in and year out to every team. We see someone go down and it’s unfortunate, but it’s part of the game. You have to play the next-man-up card, so you don’t have a choice.” Marcus Cannon happens to be the next man up, and it won’t exactly be a shock to the system. The fifth-year veteran has played 49.7 percent of the offensive snaps this season as the coaching staff has turned to an innovative offensive line rotation in 2015. David Andrews is the only offensive lineman (and offensive player) to play 100 percent of the offensive snaps. Instead of just relying on continuity from five linemen — two tackles, two guards and a center — the Patriots have rotated guards and tackles throughout their first four games. Starting in Week 1, Cannon was replacing either Solder or Sebastian Vollmer mid-game. Then at guard, the Patriots have used Shaq Mason, Josh Kline and Tre’ Jackson. The team practices that way as well, in order to create continuity with every offensive lineman on the team. This practice has made each player comfortable with whomever the coaches put next to him. “I mean, very comfortable,” Mason said. “I feel like all the guys are very comfortable with each other. We’re meshing, still trying to get better as a unit. I think everything is going to go pretty good.” “It helps, but everyone has to be on the same page no matter who is in there,” Kline added. “Of course, some little things will change, but (not much) will because we have the same communication, same calls and you just need to make them. We’ll be fine.” “Everyone, we just know we have a job to do and we have to do that,” Andrews said. “Whoever is placed there, you just have to get the job done. I think we just have a good group of guys that just come to work every day and go out there and play hard.” Cannon played in all 16 games last season, making four starts. The most playing time he’s received came in 2013. That season he replaced Vollmer, who broke his leg, and started six regular-season games, plus two playoff games. A fourth-round pick in 2011, Cannon started last season as the Patriots’ left guard. He moved back to tackle this year, but has played guard during goal-line situations. “Marcus has done a great job for us,” Ryan Wendell said. “He’s filled in at a lot of different positions for us — each of the tackles and each of the guards. I think he’s shown his versatility and his ability to pick up the different spots. I have no doubt that he’ll continue to do that for us moving forward.” “He’s been out there. It’s not like it’s his first rodeo,” Vollmer added. “He’s been with this team for a long time. We all know what he is – been a veteran of this sport for a long time. It’s nothing crazy here.” The biggest question going forward is whether Cannon will slide into Solder’s left tackle spot or switch with Vollmer, since he’s looked more comfortable in his career at right tackle. He gave up a sack to Greg Hardy on Sunday while playing on the left side. Cannon was also responsible for a sack in Week 1, against Pittsburgh, where he was again on the left. “If they call on me, they call on me. I’ll do my best to get the job done,” Cannon said. “Whatever they ask me to do, that’s what I’ll do. I’m comfortable wherever they put me.” By Mark Daniels", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T07:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T11:06:21.592+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
