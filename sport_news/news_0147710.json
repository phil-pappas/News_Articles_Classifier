You don’t say that I have been there before and that your views should reign supreme,” he told Joy Sports. \n\"We will learn a lot from them, I have not served on any committee with some of them and it is a new environment all together. I know they are equally good as those that lost and I believe they can do the job.” \nThe tenure of the new ExCo is four years. \n- \nFollow Joy Sports on Twitter: @Joy997FM.
