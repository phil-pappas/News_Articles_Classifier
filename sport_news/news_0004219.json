He discussed the Texas Southern team he has seen on film and all of the talent they will face when they arrive in Houston. \n\"We are preparing overall to play a tough, hard football team in Texas Southern,\" Jenkins said. \"They have a very tough defense and a very experienced defensive coordinator over there that I have faced before. They really have some athletes that run around and cause havoc and cause you some problems.\" Texas Southern and Alabama State stand one-two in the SWAC in scoring defense, but the Tigers are scoring at 32 points per game, so ASU's offense will have to be proficient and score some points and in the process try to keep TSU's offense off the field. \"It's important for our offense as they will have to execute our game plan to the highest,\" Jenkins said. \"We don't need to cause any team-inflicted wounds by turning the ball over or causing any penalties. We are going to need to execute the best we have executed thus far if we are going to have a chance to score some points.\" The kickoff for Thursday's action is scheduled for 6:30 p.m. and will be broadcast before a national audience on ESPNU. The game will be played in BBVA Compass Stadium which is also the home to the Houston Dynamo Soccer Club. The game can also be heard across the ASU Hornets Sports Network along with Satellite Radio through HSRN on Sirius 204 and XM Channel 108", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T02:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T23:55:20.410+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
