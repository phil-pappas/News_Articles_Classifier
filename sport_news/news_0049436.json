Rutherford (1-5) hosts an Arnold (2-4) team coming off a huge win against Mosley in District 1-5A. The Marlins travel on Pensacola next week hoping to solidify their rank in 1-5A while the Rams have a critical 1-4A matchup here with East Gadsden. But first there are county bragging rights to settle, as well as fine-tuning for the remainder of the schedule. Elsewhere, Mosley (3-2) travels to play Class 7A Chiles (5-1) that is having a rebound season thus far. Bay (5-0) hopes to keep its unbeaten streak alive at winless East Gadsden (0-5), which is playing the first of consecutive county opponents. Bozeman is at Franklin County in 1A and North Bay Haven is idle. Rutherford will be without standout two-way player JJ Willis, who will be sidelined at least one more week with a broken bone in his arm. Coach Rob Armstrong’s contingent is accustomed to being undermanned, however. “What we’ve got to do is not worry about the team across the field and start playing a whole football game,” Armstrong said. “For 18 minutes last week we looked like world beaters and then the wheels came off. They (Walton) scored 29 points in the second half and snapped the ball on offense nine times.” The Rams have been undercut by poor execution on special teams, a dilemma that until last week also hindered Arnold. Coach Josh Wright said that for the first time the Marlins were solid in all three phases of the game. Wright said the Marlins are keeping focus heading into this matchup. “We’ve got all eyes on them,” he said of Rutherford. “We’ve always been that way because we’ve never been in position to say we’re going to be a playoff team. “We know they’re extremely well-conditioned, probably the fastest team we’ve seen at skill positions and can create big scores very quickly. They play 1950s offense so we’ve got to play 1950s defense. That’s a big challenge and we’ve not been great at it in practice. It’s foreign to most of our players so that’s an advantage for them.” Page 2 of 2 - Rutherford wants to maintain possession with its ground game utilizing a series of sweeps, traps and bootlegs. Armstrong emphasized that it’s not sufficient merely to have a 13-play drive if the Rams can’t reach the end zone. Defensively, Rutherford has faced a number of varied attacks, but not a dual-threat quarterback such as Cody Saunders who averages well over 300 total yards per game running and passing. “Everybody I know said the same thing, you’ve gotta stop (number) 5,” Armstrong said. “I haven’t seen anybody stop him. Mosley has as good of linebackers as anybody on our schedule and he still runs for 180 yards.” The cooler weather and lower humidity of October should be a plus for Rutherford’s roster, which has been short on numbers for two seasons. Armstrong noted that the Rams didn’t have a single player go down with cramps last week, which was a first. Armstrong said the coaching staff has been preaching the importance of weeks 6, 8 and 10, denoting district matchups. Friday’s showdown offers a chance to gain some momentum in that regard. Kai Kirts likely will receive many of the carries that normally go to Willis, but Rutherford needs to shore up all areas to end a three-game slide. Arnold will start the same offensive line in consecutive weeks for the first time this season. Wright said that the Marlins also should benefit from the return of defensive end Branson Stuckey, who did resume long-snapping duties against Mosley, and that two-way standout Trever Kilcrease is closer to 100 percent from a sore shoulder. Elsewhere It was at this time last season that Mosley began a five-game winning streak that propelled the Dolphins into the playoffs. Considering that both of their defeats this fall have come on county fields, a road trip could be what they need to re-energize before returning to 1-5A action. Bay is a lopsided favorite coming off its biggest win of the year, but coach Jimmy Longerbeam didn’t sound concerned his team would let down against East Gadsden. “Our kids have seen film on that and know they’re big and they’re athletic,” Longerbeam said. “We’ve had really good practice this week. We’ve worked them extra hard so they understand. All our kids want to do is win.” Longerbeam said that starting quarterback Justin Davis hurt his shoulder in the first quarter against Pensacola and didn’t practice early in the week. “He took a shot on his right shoulder,” Longerbeam said. “He’s going to be fine. We held him out this week, but he’s ready to go.” News Herald Executive Sports Editor Panama City News Herald News Herald Executive Sports Editor Posted Oct. 8, 2015 at 9:15 PM Updated at 9:23 PM", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T05:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T05:50:03.113+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
