They didn’t have to play us or the Spurs. But that’s also a lesson for us: When you have a chance to close, you have to do it.” \nNow Rivers wasn’t trying to say that the Warriors didn’t deserve to hoist the Larry O’Brien Trophy last season. Instead he was commenting on how luck and the right breaks factor heavily into any championship run, especially in the modern Western Conference where success is based almost entirely on matchups and injury luck. \nStill, Rivers’ words didn’t go down too well with Warriors guard Klay Thompson, who fired back at Rivers and the Clippers with a series of zingers as quoted by Ethan Strauss of ESPN.
