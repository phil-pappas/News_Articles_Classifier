Photograph: Jason Cairnduff/Reuters \nN orthern Ireland reached their first major tournament in 30 years and their neighbours south of the border beat world champions Germany to take a big step towards joining them at Euro 2016 in a memorable night for Irish football on Thursday. \nEuro Qualifiers: Ireland stun Germany; Portugal seal spot \nNorthern Ireland have never been to a European Championship in over 50 years but the Group F pace-setters made sure of their place in France next year in emphatic style with a deserved 3-1 home victory over Greece at a raucous Windsor Park. \nThe atmosphere was just as wild in Dublin's Aviva Stadium as Ireland secured at least a playoff spot with a shock 1-0 win, raising the prospect that both teams -- split by a 500 kilometre winding border and a complex history -- could qualify for the same tournament for the first time.

Great night for the island of Ireland, north and south. Hopefully see both teams in France next year,\" said McIlroy, who will represent Ireland at next year's Olympic Games after agonising over whether or not to opt for Britain, which controls Northern Ireland. \nNorthern Ireland's first and deputy first ministers, Peter Robinson and Martin McGuinness, also took to Twitter to congratulate the team who last qualified for a major tournament at the 1986 World Cup. \nThey reached the latter stages four years earlier when they were captained by current Ireland manager Martin O'Neill and memorably beat hosts Spain.

Well done to both teams. Time for one united team. A world beater!\" Adams said on Twitter. Source: © Copyright 2015 Reuters Limited. All rights reserved.
