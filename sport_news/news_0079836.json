Randall was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes at age 7. By CHRIS CASEY ccasey @shawmedia.com \nBATAVIA – For Jacob Randall, football is so much more than just a game. It’s an outlet. The Batavia freshman has faced many obstacles in his life, which included a move to India at a young age for his father’s job, but nothing was more challenging than the news he received when he was seven years old. \nJacob was diagnosed with Type 1 Diabetes, the most dangerous type of diabetes with no known cure. His mother, Michele, and father, John, have seen many highs and lows, but nothing has stopped Jacob from fighting through any adversity in his life. \nWhen Michele heard that Jacob wanted to play football four years ago, there was no question there were worries and health concerns, but she knew her son’s love for football meant so much more. \n“It’s still scary, but it has gotten better over time,” Michele said. “We’ve been able to talk with coaches and, now in high school, a trainer, and it makes me as a mom feel a lot more comfortable. It’s still scary because a lot of things can happen, but it’s more about going to the games and cheering him on now, rather than worrying as much.” \nIf anyone thought for one second that his diagnosis would make Jacob abandon his love for football, it couldn’t have been further from the truth. \n“I don’t want to give it up because it’s my favorite thing to do,” Jacob said. “I want to take control of the diabetes because diabetes doesn’t define me. It shows I’m going to take control of it and change it for the better. I love the sport, I like to play and I like to hit people.” \nThere have been many sleepless nights, many scares, but one thing the entire Randall family now knows, especially after this past Sunday, was that the support from both the Batavia football program and Batavia community is overwhelming. \nMore than 80 members combined to form a sea of red to support the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation and Team Randall at St. James Farm Forest Preserve in Warrenville. \nBatavia freshman football coach Mike Theriault met the Randalls during eighth-grade workouts over the summer, and was informed of his condition. Fast forward to this season, when the freshman team was in the weight room for workouts and Theriault saw Jacob wearing an interesting shirt, which sparked him to inquire. \nOn the back of the red T-shirt read: “TEAM RANDALL” with the No. 1 underneath and three words to the right of the number reading: “WALK. CURE. DREAM.” \nWhen Theriault asked, Jacob, a center on the freshman football team, explained that his family has been involved in supporting JDRF for several years. Their annual walk to raise awareness was just around the corner and his family had formed Team Randall and participated in the event in past years. \nTheriault said something clicked and thought it would be a great opportunity to support the Randalls. \n“We’re always looking to do things in the community, outside of football,” Theriault said. “When I saw the shirt and Jacob told me about it, I thought it would be a great thing to do. I think you could tell it meant a lot to him, especially with the team and his friends there. It was a big deal to him. We had a great time and it was a great event.” \nTeam Randall more than doubled its goal of $1,500 raised. \nMichele knew there was support from coaches, with their complete understanding of Jacob’s condition, but Sunday brought things to a whole other level. \n“We’ve always been able to talk to them and be on the same page with things,” she said. “But for them to do this and go this extra step, it was very touching, inspiring and makes us very proud to be Bulldogs and part of the Batavia community.” \nIf you think it meant something to Michele to have the support they received, imagine what was going on in Jacob’s mind. \n“It was really great to have everyone here,” Jacob said. “It’s the first year that all of the football players got involved, and to do the walk with all of them, I loved it. It was more than just the football team, too, which was great.” \nWhile hundreds of thousands of people deal with different types of diabetes, for Jacob to play football with Type 1, is a rarity in itself. Those with Type 1 Diabetes have a pancreas that does not produce any insulin at all. \nAny exercise lowers blood sugar in the human body, but with the wireless insulin pump that Jacob wears, which inserts a set amount of insulin into his body, the insulin continues to be inserted, causing his blood sugar to drop even further. \nFor those who do not have diabetes, the pancreas is regulated and stops producing insulin during times of stress or exercise. \n“Lows are a lot more frequent than highs during football, for sure,” Michele said. “He had an incident at a camping trip this past summer, where some of his teammates were present. I don’t want to say it was a wake-up call, but they all got to see how real this is and what it can actually do to him.” \nJacob also wears a Continuous Glucose Monitor, or CGM. The device allows Jacob and his mother to get read outs of his blood sugar levels every five minutes or so instead of Jacob having to prick his finger multiple times a day. Instead, the CGM allows Jacob to calibrate his levels just twice a day. \nThe devices are worn under his pads during football, and aside from taking a few plays off from practices or games when needed, Theriault said you couldn’t even tell watching him play. Jacob also brings a shot kit to practice and games, in case of emergency. \nHis mother joked that getting the readouts has allowed her to become a “smother mother” to make sure everything remains how it should. \nMichele has had a lot to worry about, and as a mother, still does on a daily basis. But with doctor’s visits every three months, and the day-by-day uncertainty, she has seen her son battle through everything, and not give up, continuing to play the sport he loves. It has been quite the eye-opening journey. \n“We’ve always talked about how strong Jacob is, and the fact that he’s not ashamed of diabetes by any means, it’s a part of him,” Michele said. “But he doesn’t want it to define him. So when he’s involved in a sport like this and everyone sees him have to go to the sidelines, while it may be everyone is running, he doesn’t want anyone to think it’s because he’s not trying hard or giving it his all.” \nFrom day one of his diagnosis, Jacob has been the definition of giving it his all. He’s given football his all, but more importantly, he’s given life his all.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T06:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T08:03:34.918+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
