His dreadlocks shook as he completed the seventh inning. He saved his best for the biggest night, a 7-2 victory in Game 5 to wrest the American League Division Series from the upstart Astros.\nTwo years ago, Cueto heard his name spat in derision as a visiting player during a playoff game in Pittsburgh. During Wednesday's eighth inning, his name rang out across a sold-out ballpark, each syllable coated with a love and trust earned on this night.\nMaligned for so much of his Kansas City tenure, Cueto strapped the rest of the Royals to his back across eight innings. He attacked Houston batters with his fastball, baffled them with his changeup and delivered on the promise elicited by his arrival in late July. He retired the last 19 batters he faced.\nHe lamented one misplaced pitch, a fastball hit by third baseman Luis Valbuena for a two-run homer in the second. Cueto still struck out eight as the Royals advanced to the American League Championship Series for the second season in a row. They will host Toronto in Game 1 on Friday night.\nGranted new life by a frenetic comeback in Game 4, the Royals outlasted the Astros across five harrowing games. Houston operated in the driver's seat for much of these five days and nights. Yet Kansas City displayed enough mettle, and enough timely hitting, to extend their season.\nAs Cueto glimmered on the mound, his teammates punched through the decaying foundation of the Astros pitching staff. Alex Rios smacked a two-run double and came around to score during a go-ahead, three-run rally in the fifth. The defense shined through the evening: Ben Zobrist leapt to snag a liner at second base; Alex Gordon slid on his back to catch a ball in foul territory.\nIn the eighth, Kendrys Morales vanquished Houston's ace, Dallas Keuchel, who appeared in relief. Morales boomed a three-run homer. He spread his arms wide as he rounded first base. The dugout and the ballpark erupted as one. Morales rolled his shoulders and slapped his fingers across his neck when he reached the plate, repeating the gesture from Astros pitcher Lance McCullers that infuriated the Royals in Game 4.\nHours before the game, Ned Yost settled into his for a press conference and strummed his finger against the microphone. His answers were clipped at the start, racing through questions. His bullpen was fully loaded. His leash with Cueto would depend on Cueto's performance. He kept his enthusiasm restrained, but it was apparent.\n\"It's going to be a fun game,\" Yost said. \"Going to be a fun night.\"\nAs the Royals took batting practice, MLB commissioner Rob Manfred arrived. He chatted with general manager Dayton Moore and owner David Glass. George Brett and Mike Sweeney held court nearby. Moore climbed the steps back to the Royals clubhouse, but paused to watch a hallway television monitor showing the chaotic seventh inning in Toronto.\nKansas City officials diminished their expectations for Cueto's start. With contingency plans written up for an emergency every inning, the Royals were willing remove Cueto early. All the Royals hoped for was a scoreless frames at the outset.\nKauffman Stadium pulsated after a stirring pregame tribute to Larry Leggio and John Mesh, the two Kansas City firefighters killed during a building collapse on Monday. Cueto followed up with a scoreless, three-batter frame in the top of the first.\nThe noise dipped in the second. Evan Gattis pulled a fastball down the third base line. Mike Moustakas gloved it, but his momentum carried him over the line. His throw to first pulled Hosmer off the bag. Hosmer swung his glove to tag Gattis only to lose control of the ball.\nThe two-out single proved costly. On the next pitch, third baseman Luis Valbuena hammered a 94-mph fastball into the Astros bullpen.\nMcHugh represented Cueto's counterpart on the mound. In Game 1, he limited the Royals to two runs and four hits in six innings. He began Game 5 in much the same fashion. McHugh does not possess starling velocity or one vicious offspeed pitch. He relies upon upsetting the timing of his opponents.\nThe Royals played into this trap at the start. The Astros turned two double plays in the first three innings. Kansas City required some good fortunate to plate their first run.\nWith one out in the fourth, Cain hacked at a low fastball and smacked a cue shot into right field. His teammates ribbed him as he ran down the line. Cain broke for second on a full-count cutter, which Hosmer dumped into center for a single. Carlos Gomez lost his footing as he retrieved the baseball. Cain sprinted all the way home.\nCueto recovered from his second blip to author one of his finest outings as a Royal. He struck out seven through five innings. After Valbuena's homer, Cueto settled into a rhythm.\nMcHugh survived flurries of hard contact until the fifth. He hit Salvador Perez with a full-count curveball. Alex Gordon one-hopped a ground-rule double on a pitiable, belt-high cutter. Astros manager A.J. Hinch fetched McHugh and inserted Mike Fiers, a starter who had not pitched since Sept. 29.\nThe decision backfired. Rios punched a curveball down the third-base line. The ball skipped over the bag and eluded Valbuena's glove. The ballpark came unglued as Perez and Gordon reached home. At second base, Rios unfurled a tremendous fist pump, his most public show of emotion as a Royal.\nAlcides Escobar bunted Rios over to third base. Ben Zobrist brought him home with a flyball to right. A mass of Royals greeted Rios as he reached the dugout. More raucous celebrations would soon follow.\n(c)2015 The Kansas City Star (Kansas City, Mo.)\nVisit The Kansas City Star (Kansas City, Mo.) at www.kansascity.com\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/baseball/s-1737851&h=Cueto+shines+as+Royals+advance+to+ALCS+with+7%2D2+win+over+Astros", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/baseball/s-1737851&hashtags=ArcaMax", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/baseball/s-1737851"], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T08:06:25.280+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
