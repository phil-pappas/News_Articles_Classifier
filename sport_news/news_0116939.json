(AP) LSU police arrested two Georgia men peddling phony tickets to Saturday's LSU football game after disappointed fans reported the forgeries to university officials. The Advocate reports 30-year-old Kenny Lamar Redding and 29-year-old Christopher Harrison, both of Atlanta, were booked on two counts each of an offense against intellectual property. Police say Harrison, who was identified by the victims as the man who sold them the counterfeit tickets, was also booked on two counts of theft.
