The win helped her team take second in state.\nShe began playing tennis at the age of 4 with her father so she could be like her older sisters who also play.\n“I love that it is individual on the court, but then there is a bigger aspect to it off the court,” Turley said.\nThe head coach of Davis tennis is Andy Wahlstorm. He has had a chance to coach Whitney and her older sisters and knows how lucky he is to have her on the team.\n“Whitney Turley is one of the strongest competitors you’ll ever meet,” Wahlstrom said.\nHunter Horsley\nLogan\nFootball\nLogan's starting quarterback has been putting up big numbers all year, but his effort during Thursday's 52-23 win over Stansbury may have been his best to date. Horsley threw five touchdowns on just 12 completions to pace the Grizzlies to yet another big win while rushing the football 11 times for 64 yards.\n\"Hunter had his best game of the season,\" said Logan coach Mike Favero . \"He's playing great football and I expect him to play even better as we approach the playoffs.\"\nAs is usually the case, Logan is expected to go far in the 3AA playoffs and could very well enter the postseason viewed as the favorites to win it all. As for Horsely, he'll continue to build off of an already productive season where he's accounted for 2,100 yards of total offense and 22 touchdowns.\nOther stars\nJaden Ellett\nWayne\nBaseball\nIn order to get the runs coming in, it's often a team's leadoff hitter who gets it going. That was certainly the case during Wayne's 16-4 romp over Tabiona in the 1A state baseball championship game.\nJaden Ellett bats leadoff for the Badgers and came through on Saturday for four runs and five RBIs. He led off the game in the first inning with a walk, stolen base and a run scored before topping it off in the sixth inning with a 2-RBI single that all but sealed things up for a Wayne championship.\n“I just got up there with the attitude that I wanted to help our team,” Ellett said of his championship game effort. “I didn’t want to do anything too large. I just got to help out my team.”\nNathan Taylor\nHunter\nBoys Cross Country\nIt isn’t just Nathan Taylor’s athletic ability that make him a leader for the Hunter High cross country team.\n“He’s awesome in every way,” said Hunter coach Ronda Hansen. “He’s just an all-around good guy. He works hard, he supports his teammates, and he honors his commitments.”\nHe also runs pretty fast. The honor student and team captain was the top individual state qualifier in the Region 2 meet with a 12th-place finish.\nDarian Morlan\nDuchesne\nGirls Cross Country", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T17:20:20.069+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
