Pic/ISL \nSubstitute Gadze headed home a Florent Malouda cross as he timed his jump to perfection heading home from close range much to the dismay of the home fans and team's owner Sachin Tendulkar, who graced the stands.\nDynamos now have nine points from four games and are second in the league table behind FC Pune City.\nDynamos started on a positive note as Robin Singh's shot was saved by opposition goalie Stephen Bywater. In the fifth minute, Francis Fernandes provided a defence splitting through for Gustavo Dos Santos but the Brazilian's first touch wasn't a great one and by the time he took the second stroke, Bywater anticipated to collect the ball.\nPeter Ramage had a good game at the heart of the Blasters defence as he kept out the dangerous floaters sent from right by the Malouda.\nLocked goalless at half-time, profligate Robin missed the chance of the match in the 67th minute after he had sights of an open goal from a rebound which he shot over. Finally, it was Gadze, who brought smiles in the face of Dynamos manager Roberto Carlos with a perfect header.\nISL top 5 standings \nFC Pune\nDelhi Dynamos\nAtletico de Kolkata\nFC Goa\nChennaiyin FC", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T12:13:23.940+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
