'She doesn't play like a freshman or act like a freshman.' \nThe victory put the Lady Indians into tonight's 6:30 p.m., championship while awaiting the winner of a third meeting this season between Newnan and South Cobb. The Lady Cougars, who evened up their record with South Cobb in Tuesday's 5-4 tournament win, can clinch home field for the first round of the Class state playoffs with a victory in today's 4:30 p.m., while also setting up a rematch with East Coweta. \nTwo victories by Newnan would set up a deciding game with the Lady Indians as the program did in 2013. East Coweta didn't let things get that far last fall, winning the title in its first try. \n'We know whoever we play will have to be ready,' DeLoach said. 'Our goal is to win the first game. If it goes to a second game, momentum can do crazy things. \nDeLoach can now turn to veteran pitcher Morgan Goree with lefty Rachel Vaughan also available. \nDespite her age, Lynch is used to performing in big games, having played in ASA Nationals for four consecutive years at the travel level. In Tuesday's victory over Westlake she hit two homers, including one that banged off the scoreboard. \nShe started Wednesday's effort from the circle by striking out the side in the first inning. Despite allowing one of her three walks to lead off the second, Lynch again rebounded with three more strikeouts. \nLynch leads an up-and-coming nucleus that included eight eighth-graders playing with the junior varsity, a team that lost just one game this season. \nBut first, she has an opportunity to help lead this year's varsity squad back to the Class Elite 8 in Columbus. \n'It's exciting to be part of the varsity as a freshman,' she said. 'I have really great teammates. Olivia (Davis) is a great catcher and she has really helped me. Morgan and Rachel have been great too. My teammates have really helped.' \nEast Coweta's offense also belted 10 hits. \nLeadoff hitter Mekhia Freeman and Madison Carter led the way with two RBIs each. \nFreeman's triple in the fifth inning accounted for both of her RBIs and put ended the game by the 8-0 mercy rule. \nThe Lady Indians scored two runs in the first and second, one in the third and three in the fifth to secure the victory. \nDavis, Dani Morgan and Jamie Vitale had RBIs for the Lady Indians. \nNewnan chances to score were limited with just three runners reaching because of walks, In addition to Shakerra Geter's walk in the second, Hannah Scarbrough worked the count full before drawing a pass in the third inning to become the Lady Cougars second base runner of the game. \nBut East Coweta retired the next six batters, including four by strikeout. Newnan's Katelin Richardson drew a leadoff walk in the fifth to become the Lady Cougars' final base runner. \nNewnan sophomore pitcher Addie Andrews struck out one and walked one in the loss, retiring East Coweta's side in order in the fourth. \nEast Coweta increased the lead to 4-0 in the second after Lindsey Warren and Davis were hit by pitchers. Both runners scored on Madison Carter's double. \nThe Lady Indians pushed one runner across the plate in the third after Ashlynn Gunter, Warren, and Vitale singled with two outs. Davis kept the inning alive with her team's fourth-straight hit to plate Gunter. \nEast Coweta put the game away in the fifth when Vitale knocked in Vaughan with a sacrifice fly and Freeman ripped a two-run triple to close the game by mercy rule. \nLADY INDIANS 8, LADY COUGARS 0 \nNEWNAN 000 00 - 0 0 1 \nEAST COWETA 221 03 - 8 10 0 \nWP - Kelley Lynch", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T09:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T23:32:48.589+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
