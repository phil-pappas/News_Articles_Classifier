Nick Danielson For The Bellingham Herald i \nThere’s no doubting, especially at the high school level, having a talented quarterback is central to a team’s success. \nIt’s arguably the most coveted piece to a winning equation. \nSo questions loomed heading into this Northwest Conference football season of how well teams such as Squalicum, Blaine, Nooksack Valley and Meridian might fare after graduating talented signal-callers. \nWell, four weeks into the season, those answers are coming into sharp focus. \nNot only have Squalicum’s Garrett Sorenson, Blaine’s Jalen Kortlever, Meridian’s Simon Burkett and Nooksack Valley’s Casey Bauman excelled early on, other first-year starting QBs such a Ferndale’s James Hinson and Bellingham’s Nick Knutson have emerged as solid leaders for their respective offenses. \nAnd interestingly enough, the aforementioned six are all either sophomores or juniors, setting up what should be bright futures for their respective programs. \nEach quarterback offers various skills. Here’s a look at what makes each of them a quality, promising player. Summer growth powering Blaine’s Kortlever \nSurprisingly, the Northwest Conference’s leading passer hadn’t played a varsity football game before this fall. \nBut the fact he’s thrived under the Friday night lights and leads the league with 753 pass yards and 11 TDs shouldn’t come as a complete shock. He did play varsity baseball and basketball last year. \nBlaine’s quarterback situation was undecided following Nate Kramme’s graduation, but Kortlever spent his summer working with quarterback coach and former Borderite QB Jordan McCarty, and Blaine coach Jay Dodd said the junior’s improvements were impressive. \n“He really worked on his mechanics over the summer, and just became a really good quarterback,” Dodd said. “He’s become an accurate passer and the other thing that has really impressed me so far has been his competitiveness and toughness.” \nKortlever is also a standout academically, and that intelligence shines through on the football field. \nHelping Kortlever is a deep cast of wide receivers composed of Anthony Ball, Jonathan Starcer, Layton Hagee and tight end Josh Fakkema. Kortlever’s ability gives Blaine a balanced offense and keeps teams guessing. \n“No, there really is not,” said Dodd when asked if there is a throw Kortlever can’t make. “He can throw the deep ball, he can throw a lot of different balls all over the field and he can do it on the move or from in the pocket.” Nooksack Valley’s Bauman a QB prototype \nIf a coach were to draw up the ideal framework he’d want in a young quarterback, Bauman would match pretty well. \nHe’s all of 6-foot-4, has a big arm for only a sophomore and is developing at a strong rate, Pioneers coach Robb Myhre said. \nAnd Nooksack Valley is using him, a lot. \nLast week he threw 57 times, completing 37 of those for 332 yards and two touchdowns. He has more pass completions than anyone else in the Northwest Conference by 31. \n“I’ve had him in PE since sixth grade, but I had no idea he was going to grow into this beast,” Pioneers coach Robb Myhre joked in a phone interview. “He really has sprouted up and worked hard in the weight room.” \nIt was during the Mount Baker game last week that Myhre became enamored with the throws his young QB was making. He’s also shown an ability to run, which was one of the reasons Myhre was hesitant to give him the keys to the offense right away. \nAnother reason was his ability to go through the passing progressions, but now the sophomore seems poised for not only a big season but a strong career looking forward. Hinson keeping Ferndale in perfect balance \nGolden Eagles coach Jamie Plenkovich couldn’t have a better quarterback situation. \nHe has two good ones in senior Kyler Schemstad and sophomore James Hinson, and while Hinson barely edged out Schemstad in what was a tight preseason battle, whether it was this year or in years to come, Plenkovich knew Hinson could be good. \nThe sophomore is one of the few Ferndale freshmen who’ve ever seen varsity playing time, and after a summer of building increased athleticism, strength and sharpening of his QB skills, Hinson has done well leading the Golden Eagles’ offense. \nWeek 2 Hinson eclipsed the number of Ferndale passing TDs from last year, and he’s given a much-needed pass element to an outstanding rush-first offense. \nBut what excites Plenkovich the most about Hinson is how well he handles adversity. \n“I think one of the biggest things is when things are stressful, he stays even-keel,” Plenkovich said. “He does a good job of not getting too high or too low. ... Obviously the challenge for him is to keep getting better. He needs to continue to push to get better, and I think he will.” Versatile Burkett has bright future \nMeridian coach Bob Ames offered sophomore QB Simon Burkett a mighty compliment, saying he sees some of the same things in Burkett he saw in the Slesks who played in Meridian’s football program. \nBurkett has impressed through the team’s first three games of the season, displaying a penchant for passing and running. \nBut what has Ames most impressed is Burkett’s short-term memory when it comes to making mistakes. \n“His ability to process mistakes and move on to the next play and try not to make them again,” Ames said. “We can say, ‘Hey, we have 25 seconds left and we are getting ready to throw the ball,’ and he is able to do that. He is not afraid to tuck the ball and run either.” \nAmes said his QB has a good, average arm and makes strong decisions with where he delivers the football. \n“He’s only 15 or 16 years old, and he’ll get better with his mechanics,” Ames said. “He’ll improve as he gets more mature. He’s not afraid to work for it.” \nYouth movement \nMini profile on this year’s non-senior, first-year starting quarterbacks: \nNick Knutson, Bellingham", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T06:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T08:12:00.972+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
