Here’s a look at the 14 divisional races to be run between Monday and Thursday. (Last year’s team winner is in parentheses)\nMONDAY (NJIC)\nColonial boys, 2:30 (Lyndhurst): Glen Rock edged Lyndhurst in their dual meet, but the defending champs, despite heavy graduation losses, are the slight favorites to retain its title. Sean Sullivan will win his third straight divisional race with Glen Rock’s Owen Davitt and Leonia’s Hussein Elmeshad the next best.\nMeadowlands girls, 2:40 (Secaucus): Hasbrouck Heights will likely end the Patriots’ three-year streak, but Secaucus’ Roshni Patel has a chance to win her third straight individual title with Tara Satnick of Dwight-Englewood, Nicole McVeigh of Saddle Brook and multiple Heights runners in the mix.\nPatriot boys, 3:00 (Bogota): The only questions here are whether Bogota will sweep the top five spots (unlikely) and which Bogota boy will win the title among Dan Daurio, James Draney and Andy Jaipersaud, although Andrew Sarrow of Park Ridge/Emerson and Carl Desrosiers of Palisades Park will compete.\nColonial Girls, 3:10 (Glen Rock): The Panthers will easily repeat and Alex Walter of Glen Rock should get the individual title she just missed last year.\nMeadowlands boys, 3:30 (Dwight-Englewood): Heights beat Dwight-Englewood in the opening dual meet to earn the favorite’s role but Saddle Brook might also contend. Youssef Abubaker is Heights’ best but DE frosh David Khym, Saddle Brook’s Kelon Yelong and maybe Paterson Charter’s Hector Cruz can also win.\nPatriot girls, 3:40 (Cresskill): The Cougars are strong again but Park Ridge/Emerson has added frosh standout Samantha Green since its dual meet loss to Cresskill and that be enough to reverse it. Look for Green, Nadia Itani of PRE and 2013 champ Arianna Lopez of Pal Park to top the individual field.\nTUESDAY (Big North (race order unknown)\nLiberty boys (Passaic Tech): Passaic Tech edged Clifton in a dual meet but the Mustangs are always tough on Garret Mountain, Tarin Nelson of PCT, Kevin Heredia of Clifton, soph Anthony DiIorio of Bergen Tech and freshman Jeron Jordan of Kennedy can all win.\nLiberty girls (Clifton): The Mustangs have won all five previous titles and were undefeated in duals but Bergen Tech and Passaic Tech are dangerous in this format. If healthy Michelle Kubasek of Bergen Tech should easily repeat, but if not it might be PCT junior Sarah Shannon’s race.\nIndependence boys (Wayne Hills): The Patriots will win again, but George Galkin and Eric Solorenzo will have their hands full with Fair Lawn soph Jonathan Marcus.\nIndependence girls (Wayne Hills): The Patriots will breeze to a sixth straight win, and expect Patriot Katerina Zachmann to win her first individual race.\nTHURSDAY (Big Northrace order unknown)\nFreedom boys (Ridgewood): The Maroons might win again but the hottest team in North Jersey is Indian Hills, which won a 27-28 dual on Monday against its rival. Matt Cohane of Indian Hills will battle Kenny Marshall and Nick Barnabic for the individual crown. \nFreedom girls (Northern Highlands): The Highlanders upset four-time champ Ridgewood last year and nearly beat the Maroons in a dual on Monday. But the Highlanders must solve their fifth girl problem or Ridgewood will win again. \nNational boys (Pascack Valley): Demarest has led this division since opening day but don’t count out Tenafly. James Weissenborn of Old Tappan has had a quietly effective early season and the 2014 all-North Jersey choice will up the ante here as the races get tougher.\nNational girls (Old Tappan): The Golden Knights will win a fourth straight team title with the duel between OT’s Courtney Brunet and Pascack Valley’s Ashley Evans an interesting one.\n— Paul Schwartz", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T04:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T15:14:18.103+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
