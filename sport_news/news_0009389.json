And it was different result with the coin in the 2nd ODI as he opted to use his left hand to flip the coin. (Dhoni surprises in Indore) Dhoni tosses the coin with his left hand. Photo from Twitter (@GSV1980) \nThe right-handed Dhoni usually uses his natural hand to toss the coin. But today, he used his left hand to flip the specially minted coin which has the images of Mahatma Gandhi and Nelson Mandela. \nRival captain AB de Villiers' call was not right and Dhoni's losing sequence at tosses ended. And he was quick to opt to bat first. \nIndia are trailing 0-1 in the 5-match ODI series against South Africa. The visitors won the 1st game by 5 runs in Kanpur. The third ODI is in Rajkot on October 18 (Sunday). \nWill it also change the result at a venue where India have beeen unbeaten in their all 3 previous ODIs? \nOneIndia News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T12:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T13:28:12.168+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
