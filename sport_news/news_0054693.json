(Getty Images) \nThe very best small forwards in the NBA are adaptable and athletic. The worst sit in the corner and look like a plant. Now ask yourself: Which one would you first choose if asked to build a team from scratch? Who would be second? Eighth? Twenty-seventh? Ideally, you're getting a super versatile scorer who can create his own shot, space the floor, defend multiple positions and comfortably engineer an effective pick-and-roll -- or, at the very least, drive by a closeout defender and not chuck the ball at a fan sitting court side. \nIn line with last week's article ranking the NBA's 30 starting power forwards , several factors were, to the best of my ability, ignored -- including contract value and team fit. To get there, I watched film, poured through statistics found on sites like Basketball-Reference, NBA.com (which includes SportVU and Synergy) and Nylon Calculus; re-read my stack of notebooks that are filled with observations from game watching over the past few seasons; and hashed out a few ideas with fellow writers. \nIt's not perfect, because no list can be -- and it remains unclear who will actually start on opening night for every team in the league. But who cares. Enjoy, and let the arguments begin. Tier 8: 3-and-D, without the 3 (and/or D) \n30. P.J. Hairston, Charlotte Hornets 29. Wesley Johnson, Los Angeles Clippers 28. Stanley Johnson, Detroit Pistons 27. C.J. Miles, Indiana Pacers 26. Matt Barnes, Memphis Grizzlies 25. Robert Covington, Philadelphia 76ers 24. Jae Crowder, Boston Celtics 23. Al-Farouq Aminu, Portland Trail Blazers 22. Quincy Pondexter, New Orleans Pelicans 21. Otto Porter, Washington Wizards \nOne-third of the league's starting small forwards are superficial caricatures. They're average or below it. None are offensive decision-makers who make those around them better; most have a blind spot or two on defense. (Stanley Johnson may join the X-Men someday, but it's safe to assume he'll have a rocky rookie season, possibly even backing up the lesser Morris twin.) \nThe players in this tier are inconsistent and rely on teammates to do all the heavy lifting. They're mostly interchangeable, too: Swap Pondexter for Hairston (RIP MKG) and the Charlotte Hornets are, what, two games better? Would this deal sink the New Orleans Pelicans? None of these guys are anyone's missing piece. None of them are elite at any one skill, but a few still make the most with what they have. \nCrowder hustles his ass off in transition, crashes the glass and can switch from power forwards to point guards guarding a pick-and-roll. But he's laid bricks behind the 3-point line his entire career, and without respectable range his impact on offense is limited. Crowder should crack Boston's starting lineup because he understands what he can and can't do. That's important for almost everyone in the league, but small forwards with a below-average usage rate really need to stay in their lane. \nMiles' shot selection will make you question his sanity, and he doesn't rebound, pass or attack the basket. But after 10 years in the NBA he at least knows what he is (a decent 3-point shooter who's fine on defense). That's a net positive for a player who shouldn't start. \nThe Portland Trail Blazers won't ask Aminu to initiate their offense, and that's OK. It's not what they signed the former eighth overall pick to do. A problem can only arise if he stops rebounding at a high rate, cutting into open space, blocking shots, clamping down stretch fours and tricking forcing the opposition to run out and contest his corner threes. \nBarring a suspension over a reported physical confrontation with New York Knicks head coach Derek Fisher over the weekend (this is so ridiculous), Barnes should start over Tony Allen and Jeff Green this season. His plug-and-play skill set is valuable on a team that remains committed to fitting pieces around Zach Randolph and Marc Gasol. Barnes can sort of shoot threes and sort of defend the other team's best perimeter weapon. Sort of. He's also a clown. \nThe 10 teams who start these players may not desire an immediate upgrade, but none of them are long-term solutions -- with the exception of Detroit's Johnson and maybe Porter, pending Kevin Durant's decision next summer. Washington's third wheel is on the verge of a meaningful leap and can easily pass the next tier with a strong campaign in 2015-16. Tier 7: Authentic 3-and-D guys! \n20. P.J. Tucker, Phoenix Suns 19. Trevor Ariza, Houston Rockets \nConsider Tier 7 a smaller, smoother version of Tier 8. You know what you're getting with Ariza and Tucker. They play first-class defense, shoot (many open) threes and are appreciated as consistent, tough, intelligent veterans. Having them on the court is generally a good idea. \nNeither Ariza nor Tucker will have his number called on a regular basis, but they do a decent enough job spacing the floor and keeping defenses honest. Most of their value comes on the other end, where they handle the difficult assignments without complaint. They can attack a rotating defense with a live dribble, but don't put the ball in their hands for too long or your offense will turn into an unfortunate adventure. Tier 6: Two-dimensional question marks \n18. Harrison Barnes, Golden State Warriors 17. Joe Johnson, Brooklyn Nets 16. Danilo Gallinari, Denver Nuggets 15. Tobias Harris, Orlando Magic 14. Luol Deng, Miami Heat 13. Kobe Bryant, Los Angeles Lakers 12. Rudy Gay, Sacramento Kings \nIt's hard to find common ground between these seven names. Some are the most familiar faces in the NBA. Some are total enigmas. Some are both. They're former stars, rising role players and declining hero-ball enthusiasts. Each one, for the most part, is comfortable playing up or down a position. It's a wacky group. \nAnyway, Kobe is here, so let's talk about Kobe. According to Basketball Reference , the lowest effective field-goal percentage ever recorded by a player who averaged at least 20 field-goal attempts per game since the NBA adopted the 3-point line before the 1979-80 season was Allen Iverson's 43.6 percent in 2003. \nBryant almost shattered that last year. On 20.4 shots per game, in 35 contests, Bryant's effective field-goal percentage was a disgraceful 41.1. He shot 37.3 percent from the field and 29.3 percent from deep. It was really, really bad, mostly because L.A.'s roster demanded so much from its then-36-year-old icon. \nMore than half of Bryant's shots were against \"tight\" defense (meaning his man was 2-4 feet away). He averaged 10.9 such attempts per game, a number that might've dropped had Bryant stayed healthy, but still led the NBA. It's discouraging stuff that -- despite a marginally enhanced supporting cast that could shorten Bryant's to-do list -- figures to get worse before it gets better. When it all boils down, he'd rather launch a contested 18-footer off the dribble than draw two defenders and hit the open man. Has anybody in basketball history played with less patience? \nJeremy Lin isn't Steph Curry, but almost any wide-open three is better offense than Kobe jacking up this off-balance fallaway against one of the league's fiercest one-on-one defenders. (Stop what you're doing and go pour another one out for Michael Kidd-Gilchrist. I'll wait.) \nWhile past victims gawk at Kobe's Mt. Rushmore-deserved standing all season long (he has his own camera crew!), Gay continues to swim upstream against the belief that he's a stat-chasing also-ran. His reputation is stained from a sobering addiction to mid-range jump shots, but maybe we should stop typecasting Gay as an anti-analytics barbarian. \nHe posted the highest free-throw rate, assist percentage, PER and True Shooting percentage of his career last season. That's good news, an indication that he's trending the right way. Two straight efficient seasons may be enough to shake the stink. Remember, Gay is only 29 years old! (To the day, exactly one year older than me, so I refuse to believe that this is anything but the sign of a new beginning.) \nDeng and Johnson could have solid seasons or completely fall off a cliff. Barnes is impossible to judge until someone extracts him from Golden State (aka the NBA's version of Jarden, Texas). Much like Harris and Gallinari, Barnes is better suited as a stretch four. Gallo may very well come off the bench in Denver, but I put him on this list for two reasons: 1) he recently said \"I'm gonna start as a small forward,\" and 2) he's more fun to think about than Wilson Chandler. Tier 4: Potential All-Stars who aren' t quite there \n11. Giannis Antetokounmpo, Milwaukee Bucks 10. Andrew Wiggins, Minnesota Timberwolves 9. Chandler Parsons, Dallas Mavericks 8. DeMarre Carroll, Toronto Raptors \nThe first two in this tier, Giannis and Wiggins, are probably a year or two away from sincere stardom. In the meantime, they are raw balls of transcendent clay with screen doors for ceilings (Kevin Garnett recently said his 20-year-old teammate reminds him of a young Michael Jordan ), and that makes watching their development pure joy. \nAt this stage of his career, The Greek Freak is half E.T., half drunken octopus. He can't shoot threes and has defensive lapses that must annoy the hell out of Bucks coach Jason Kidd. But physical limitations don't exist, and, believe it or not, being exceptionally long can come in handy. Giannis gets to the rim whenever he wants and doesn't need to shoot jumpers to impact the game. But he can't become a top-15 player until defenders don't sag eight feet into the paint when he runs a pick-and-roll (something he hardly ever does, anyway). \nMoving onto Dallas' resident heartbreaker: Parsons' knee injury is an obvious issue, but there aren't many 6-foot-10 players who can facilitate in an uptempo offense like he can. Parsons moseys around screens and either slides into the paint, pulls up, tosses a perfect lob or threads a beautiful pocket pass. He ranked in the 91st percentile as a scorer out of pick-and-roll situations last season, per Synergy, and only 12 players shot more than 38 percent from behind the arc while attempting at least five threes per game. Parsons was one of them. \nHe lifts those around him, creates nightly mismatches and is better defending the ball than he gets credit for. But helping away from the action is a different story. He can be a leak on the perimeter, which is a big problem when you're averaging well over 30 minutes a game. It holds Parsons back from climbing much higher on this list. Well-rounded skill sets are increasingly valuable. That's why the Toronto Raptors stalked Carroll a few months ago. \nI'm skeptical that Carroll's offensive game can expand beyond what it currently is (an above-average outside shooter who fills in gaps with cuts, straight-line drives and transition opportunities), but he's feisty enough on the other end to completely smear his man's name from the box score. Even if he struggles to create off the bounce, Carroll will still help his team win games. (And he's able to guard three or four positions, which helps.) Tier 3: Korver vs. Carmelo \n7. Kyle Korver, Atlanta Hawks 6. Carmelo Anthony, New York Knicks \nI love that we live in a world where someone can ask \"Is Kyle Korver better than Carmelo Anthony?\" and not get laughed at for 15 minutes. It's a brainteaser, a borderline existential journey into the heart of contemporary NBA basketball. There's no easy path to arrive at the correct answer, and that's what makes asking the question so much fun. \n\"Of course it's Carmelo! But … um, no it's definitely Carmelo, I just … yeah. Korver is really awesome.\" This debate shows how different skill sets are valued right now -- how far we've come as observers, analysts and fans. \nIf you start a roster from scratch, do you select the straw who stirred a 60-win team's offense by displaying unprecedented 3-point accuracy, with enough gravity to take over an entire half-court set without ever touching the ball? Or the 31-year-old whose game sometimes sounds like a speeding train that just slammed on the brakes? Anthony led the league in usage percentage and scoring just three seasons ago. He's made the past six All-Star games and still gets off a reasonably threatening shot whenever he wants, from wherever he pleases. (Passes are optional, along with any displays of effort on defense.) \nIs Korver the product of his environment, or do the bowls of dandan noodles he hurls from distance make said environment the force it's become? Is he an irreplaceable benefactor or a highly skilled opportunist? And what about Anthony? Surely he's declining, but enough to deem him irrelevant as a franchise centerpiece? Is \"sure\" the correct answer to all these questions? Probably. The NBA is so cool. Tier 2: Position-less perfection that' s only getting better \n5. Gordon Hayward, Utah Jazz 4. Jimmy Butler, Chicago Bulls 3. Kawhi Leonard, San Antonio Spurs \nThese three deserve a spot in the 2016 All-Star game. Despite their world-beating athleticism, above-average to unfreakingreal defensive intangibles and functioning reliability as top or secondary options on playoff/championship-caliber offensive units, Hayward and Leonard have yet to make it, while Butler broke through for his debut last season. \nAll three are complete. The search for meaningful blemishes (unrelated to health) on their 2014-15 campaigns is impossible, like thumbing through \"Where's Waldo?\" with a blindfold. We'll begin with a look at the group's least celebrated member. \nBesides LeBron James and Kevin Durant, no small forward can etch his own signature into a game quite like Hayward. He's on the glass, finishing in transition, defending the opposing team's top wing, shooting threes, drawing fouls, displaying Ziploc-tight handle and setting teammates up off the dribble. Physically, he's a monster. Last year, he entered camp as a chiseled, 230-pound Navy SEAL . Somehow, his muscles grew larger and his haircut became more pensive over the summer. Now Hayward looks like the MPAA forced Quentin Tarantino to cut him out of Inglorious Bastards. \nHayward just led the Jazz in True Usage, per Nylon Calculus (rare for any forward), and only 10 players averaged at least 19 points, four assists and four rebounds last season. Nine were internationally recognized megastars. Hayward was the 10th. That boy good, but where he doesn't stack up compared to the other two players who share this space is as an on-ball defender. Hayward is beyond solid, but he isn't a titanium fish net like Leonard, and Butler is just a bit more physical. \nChicago's best all-around player doesn't have a fixed spot in its starting lineup, which is up in the air until Mike Dunleavy recovers from back surgery. But for the time being, I have him as their small forward -- not that it matters. \nButler's game transcends traditional labels. He floats between both wing positions but may as well be Chicago's backup point guard, too. He's a surgeon in pick-and-roll situations (he split one beautifully during the Bulls' preseason opener Tuesday night), and James Harden is the only player in basketball who exceeds Butler's ability to draw contact coming off a high screen. Over one-fifth of all his pick-and-roll possessions ended with a trip to the charity stripe last year. That's not a low percentage. \nButler is great, but Leonard equals the first time you tasted pizza. I love watching him play. He takes games over without ever touching the ball (not including when he rips it away from a flustered opponent), can knock down spot-up jumpers and momentarily contain Blake Griffin in a playoff game. How amazing would it be if he played an entire quarter dressed like Freddy Krueger? This needs to happen. Tier 1: The world' s two best players \n2. Kevin Durant, Oklahoma City Thunder 1. LeBron James, Cleveland Cavaliers \nNo surprises here! Durant and LeBron are the two best basketball players in the universe. There's a very real chance they finish first and second for MVP, then lock horns in the NBA Finals. \nThere's not much to write about either guy that isn't already known, but it's fair to say that neither player has ever entered a season, in their entire life, with people doubting their ability to produce at a high level on a game-by-game basis. Depending on where you look, that's kind of happening right now. \nDurant is returning from a foot injury that sideswiped the Thunder last season. LeBron turns 31 on Dec. 30, and noticeable decline is just around the corner. It's fine to gossip and whisper and ask questions, but that doesn't validate any of the concerns as legitimate. LeBron is still an unparalleled Mack truck who is better than everybody else. Durant is still the single toughest cover in basketball. \nWatching them both carry on as the league's two brightest stars for at least one more season should be a blast. Buckle up.
