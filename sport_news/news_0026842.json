We have some young players and it showed at times. That’s no excuse, because overall we had too many hitting errors,” said Barber. \nWestminster’s attacking game was led by Erin Mockler (18 kills) and Maci Quebedeaux (29 assists and four kills). \nMiller Ezell provided eight digs, while Mary Virginia Guice supplied seven. \nStacia Newton had six kills for the Crusaders, while Blythe Thompson and Neilee Newton had three each. Ivy Cains had two (kills). \nEzell served the Saints to an 11-0 advantage in the first set as the Crusaders committed seven hitting errors and Mockler had two kills. \nStacia Newton helped WCA back into the game with a pair of kills that helped the Crusaders to 16-7 , Another three Mockler kills finished the set. \nIt was a similar script in the second set. \nMockler and Quebedeaux combined for five kills as the Saints moved in front 13-3. \nNeilee Newton and Stacia Newton collectively had three kills as the Crusaders closed to 15-6. \nHannah Jumonville served the Saints’ final five points. \nWCA took a 12-1 lead in the third game with Hannah Fontenot serving. \nStacia Newton blocked three shots and Neilee Newton had two kills during the Crusaders’ initial run. \nASH benefitted mainly from numerous unearned points and cut the lead to 14-10 on a Mockler service ace. \nThe Saints tied it at 17 on a Mockler kill, but WCA remained in front (23-20) on a pair of Stacia Newton aces. \nASH didn’t take the lead until it was 24-23 as WCA had a hitting error. \nMcCown said she wasn’t worried about her team during the third set. \n“We won the first two on single digits during the first two. I knew our kids would come back, because we are playing with confidence right now,” she said.
