Nevertheless, the Yankees are 3 ½ lengths behind the AL East leaders right after Saturday’s win. And by Wednesday, that deficit could swell to the point exactly where the Yankees’ concentrate shifts from attempting to be divisional champs to setting up Tanaka to start off the Oct. 6 AL wild card game.\n“I assume it is a tiny bit early to ask,” Girardi said Saturday morning about speaking to Tanaka about how he felt significantly less than 24 hours soon after going six innings and throwing 82 pitches in a five-1 loss Friday night — when he gave up two homers. “We will see how he feels [Sunday] when he can possibly play some catch.’’\nGirardi mentioned Tanaka’s physical scenario overrides the Yankees’ proximity to the Blue Jays come Wednesday.\n“I am speaking about how he feels much more than something else,’’ mentioned Girardi, who has Adam Warren, Luis Severino and Tanaka lined up to face the Blue Jays at Rogers Centre. “I am not talking about the standings, I am speaking a lot more about how he feels. There are issues to talk about but not anything I am ready to talk about nowadays.’’\n ", "external_links": ["http://nypost.com/2015/09/19/theres-a-lot-that-goes-into-when-masahiro-tanaka-will-start-next/"], "published": "2015-09-20T06:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T10:06:17.216+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
