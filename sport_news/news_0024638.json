True, the Mets went 0-7 against the Cubs this season, but that was before Yoenis Cespedes arrived and David Wright returned.\nWho wins a best-of-seven? Here’s a look at the matchups to help you decide.\nCatcher Miguel Montero’s .345 on-base percentage is solid for somebody who struggled to make contact during the regular season, striking out 103 times in 347 at-bats. Montero went just 1-for-13 (.077) in the NLDS. Travis d’Arnaud hit a three-run homer in Game 3 of the NLDS and drove in the tying run with a sacrifice fly in Game 5. It came after a cold stretch to close the regular season.\nEdge: Mets\nFirst base Anthony Rizzo likely will finish among the top 10 in the NL MVP vote after blasting 31 homers and posting an .899 OPS for the Cubs. The lefty slugger had a higher on-base percentage against left-handers than right-handers (.409 to .378). Lucas Duda disappeared in the NLDS after getting hot in the final weeks of the regular season. He could be a candidate for the bench if he gets off to a slow start in the NLCS.\nEdge: Cubs\nSecond base Starlin Castro was a major disappointment for the Cubs both offensively and defensively, costing him the starting job at shortstop. Castro’s .671 OPS is all the evidence you need the Mets made the right call in not trading an elite pitching prospect to acquire him last offseason when the club was searching for an answer at shortstop. Daniel Murphy was the hero of the NLDS for the Mets, with three homers and an alert base-running play that changed the momentum of Game 5. His previous sins have been forgiven by Mets fans.\nEdge: Mets\nShortstop Wilmer Flores Photo: Charles Wenzelberg Addison Russell’s strained left hamstring leaves the job to Javier Baez, who arrived late in the season and gave the Cubs respectable at-bats. He homered in the NLDS clincher against the Cardinals, showing he isn’t intimidated by the big stage. Wilmer Flores assumed the Mets’ starting job after Chase Utley’s late slide broke Ruben Tejada’s leg and was quiet in three games against the Dodgers. The Mets would like to see more of Flores, who shined in the weeks following his near-trade to the Brewers on July 29.\nEdge: Even\nThird base Kris Bryant is the front runner for NL Rookie of the Year honors after hitting 26 homers and posting an .858 OPS. Bryant was particularly a beast at Wrigley Field, where he had a 1.037 OPS and hit 21 homers in 267 at-bats. David Wright disappeared in the NLDS after giving the Mets a boost at third base following his return from spinal stenosis in late August. The Mets need their captain producing to make this lineup tick.\nEdge: Cubs\nLeft field Kyle Schwarber arrived late in the season and provided the Cubs with another dangerous at-bat for an already potent lineup, posting an .842 OPS. He’s hit three homers in the postseason and has the kind of raw power that makes him a threat anywhere. Michael Conforto homered against Zack Greinke in Game 2 of the NLDS after a solid two-month stretch followng his arrival from Double-A Binghamton. At times he has appeared lost in the outfield.\nEdge: Cubs\nCenter field Dexter Fowler Photo: Bill Kostroun Dexter Fowler brought power to the position with 17 home runs during the regular season and had a .346 on-base percentage from the leadoff spot. He hit just .188 in the NLDS. Yoenis Cespedes’ storybook season with the Mets continued with two homers in the NLDS. He’s hit 19 homers overall since arriving from the Tigers at the trade deadline.\nEdge: Mets\nRight field Jorge Soler is a high-upside rookie with legitimate pop. He has homered twice in the playoffs after hitting 10 homers in 366 at-bats during the regular season. The Cubs have veteran Austin Jackson as another option. Curtis Granderson was probably the Mets’ MVP during the regular season and showed no signs of relenting in the NLDS, with five RBIs and .976 OPS. The three-run double he delivered in Game 3 was among the Mets’ biggest hits of the series.\nEdge: Mets\nStarting pitching Jake Arrieta and Jon Lester aren’t Zack Greinke and Clayton Kershaw, but still represent a formidable 1-2 punch. Arrieta is the co-favorite, along with Greinke, for the NL Cy Young award after going 22-6 with a 1.77 ERA. Lester, signed to a $155 million contract before the season, was 11-12 with a 3.34 ERA, but has won his share of postseason battles. Kyle Hendricks and Jason Hammel were dependable middle-of-the rotation pitchers during the regular season, but both struggled in the NLDS. The Mets have Matt Harvey, Noah Syndergaard, Jacob deGrom and Steven Matz, four young power arms capable of dominating. Harvey and Matz were shaky in the NLDS, but deGrom and Syndergaard carried the rotation.\nEdge: Mets\nBullpen Jeurys Familia Photo: Anthony J. Causi Hector Rondon had a 1.00 WHIP and 30 saves in 34 chances this season, giving the Cubs a dependable closer. Trevor Cahill arrived from the Braves for the final month and became a dependable set-up option to pair with lefty Travis Wood. Clayton Richard is another solid lefty. The Mets have Jeurys Familia, but who else? Bartolo Colon was solid in the middle innings during the NLDS, but Tyler Clippard and Addison Reed were avoided in big spots late as Collins opted to extend Familia for more than three outs, including the NLDS clincher when he worked two scoreless innings for the save.\nEdge: Cubs\nBench Chris Coghlan and Chris Denorfia are two veteran bats that can be trusted and Austin Jackson is a threat to steal a base. Kelly Johnson, Michael Cuddyer, Juan Lagares and Matt Reynolds are the Mets’ top options minus injured Juan Uribe.\nEdge: Even\nManager The Cubs hit the jackpot when Joe Maddon opted out from his contract with the Rays following last season. The accomplished Maddon is just the piece needed as the Cubs attempt to end a 107-year championship drought. Terry Collins made all the right calls in the NLDS, especially in Game 5 when Jacob deGrom was allowed to continue and Familia got the ball for six outs following Syndergaard’s terrific debut as a reliever.\nEdge: Cubs\nPredictions Ken Davidoff: Mets in 6\nFred Kerber: Mets in 6\nKevin Kernan: Mets in 7\nDan Martin: Cubs in 6\nMike Puma: Cubs in 7\nJoel Sherman: Cubs in 7\nMike Vaccaro: Mets in 6\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google Whatsapp Email Filed under chicago cubs ,  mlb playoffs ,  new york mets ,  nlcs", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T04:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T09:18:46.115+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
