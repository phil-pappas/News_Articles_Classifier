And the Giants say they expect even more.\n“Well, in all aspects, he’s learned each game he’s played and he’s gotten better each time he’s played,’’ coach Tom Coughlin said. “We’re excited about his continued development.’’\nThe numbers say that development has been impressive. Collins is fourth on the team in combined tackles (22), third in solo stops (six) and has three passes defended. His learning curve clearly is trending up, just like the Giants.\nAfter losing their first two games, the Giants have bounced back to win their next two going into Sunday’s game against the 49ers. And Collins is coming off his best performance last weekend at Buffalo, earning a plus-2.5, his highest grade so far, from Pro Football Focus. Despite missing four tackles, he allowed just three catches for 19 yards on four targets.\nIn his first month as a pro, the 21-year-old dared the Cowboys’ Pro Bowl quarterback Tony Romo to throw his way, and then made some ferocious hits last weekend against the Bills, as he says, just to let receivers know he’s there.\nHis rapid adjustment in the NFL may have exceeded most expectations, but it apparently didn’t exceed the Giants’.\n“No, that’s why we drafted him when we did,’’ Coughlin said of Collins, whom the Giants felt was a first-round talent even when they moved up to get him at the top of the second round.\nHe’s showing that already, thanks to confidence on the field that’s brought out by practice, and diligence off of it.\n“Just overall confidence, and them staying on my back about every little thing,’’ Collins said. “It’s not just the big things, because little things turn into big things, so they stayed on me about everything.\n“It’s just having the knowledge each and every week. Sometimes you’re going to get the same picture, so have the knowledge of remembering that and moving on, taking that knowledge into the play that you’ve got [in front of you], and seeing this could happen or this could happen, and applying it to the game.’’\nA former All-American and national champion from the powerhouse Crimson Tide, the 6-foot, 225-pound Collins is used to playing big games and to meticulous coaching. But from Coughlin to defensive coordinator Steve Spagnuolo to safeties coach David Merritt, the message has been constant: The devil is in the details.\n“Just staying on the little-bitty things, the itty-bitty things, just nitpicking, knowing that the backfield is this or the scheme is this, just knowing if they set up in this kind of formation then you’re going to get this,’’ Collins said. “[It’s about] great play recognition. Just formation recognition, it helps a lot.\n“The hardest thing [for me] to pick up is trying to pick up the tendencies of certain teams, stuff like that. And what I’ve worked on the most and what I’m improving on is my man-to-man coverage, and proving that I can play out on the island or inside or anywhere.’’\nFrom Collins to every single player on the defense, from coverage to pass-rushers, they have to get better. The Giants are dead last in the NFL in passing yards allowed, surrendering an unsightly 316.3 per game, something Collins acknowledged must get tightened up.\n“Oh, that has to get fixed, because you might go up against one team that just passes the ball all day and just start throwing it everywhere,’’ Collins said. “You can’t do that, especially when you get to Tom Brady and stuff like that. You can’t do that. … He’ll pick you apart. So we definitely have to fix that before those times.’’\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google Whatsapp Email Filed under landon collins ,  new york giants", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T00:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T06:48:05.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
