The two teams played an annual game at Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City, Mo., from 2002-2013. The Gorillas knocked off the Bearcats 35-17 last season in Maryville, Mo. \nGeorge Sehl caught two touchdowns for Northwest Missouri (7-0) and the Bearcat defense held the Gorillas (4-3) to just 175 yards of total offense and forced seven Gorilla punts. \n“Any time a defense can force five turnovers in game, it’s going to be huge for us as an offense,” Sehl said. “Any time you can come into this type of hostile environment and win you are doing something right.” \nSehl, a junior transfer from Iowa Western Community College, caught a 3-yard touchdown from Brady Bolles on the Bearcats’ first possession. But Pittsburg State tied the game on its following possession when Marques Cushon threw a 19-yard pass to Kyle Swartz after taking the handoff on an end-around. The Gorillas’ scoring drive was aided by a personal foul facemask call on the Bearcats. \nNorthwest Missouri controlled the clock for more than seven minutes on its second possession. Bolles finished a 19-play scoring drive with a 3-yard touchdown to sophomore tight end Clayton Wilson. The Bearcats then scored defensively with Brandon Yost recovering a fumble in the end zone. \nYost, a senior from Omaha, Neb., finished the game with four total tackles (one for loss), a pass breakup, and the recovered fumble for a touchdown. \n“We just played relentless all day,” Yost said. “We didn’t have a doubt in our mind that we could come out here today and do what we needed to do. We buckled down, trusted each other and came out with a victory.” \nSehl would score on a 68-yard catch and complete a 21-0 scoring run in the second quarter as the Bearcats took a 28-7 lead into halftime. \nPittsburg State entered the game second in the MIAA averaging 247.5 yards rushing per game, but were held for minus-three yards rushing in the first half and just 80 yards rushing for the game. \nThe Gorillas played without starting quarterback John Roderique who missed the game with an unspecified foot injury. Sophomore backup Thomas LePage rushed for 27 yards and threw for 76 yards and a touchdown. LePage was intercepted four times by the Northwest Missouri defensive unit, with Kevin Berg hauling in two of those picks. \nWith the win, Northwest Missouri now leads the all-time series between the two programs 25-24. \nNorthwest Missouri will continue MIAA play Oct. 24 with a home game against Fort Hays State, while the Gorillas will travel to Nebraska-Kearney. \nNorthwest Mo.
