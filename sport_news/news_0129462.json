Let alone the team has never won versus the team down south as conference rivals. The Utes (6-0, 3-0 Pac-12) came into Saturday's matchup against the Sun Devils (4-3, 2-2) with a different result in mind. \nIt wasn't pretty by any means, but the Utes faced adversity and won 34-18. Utah officially became bowl eligible and keeps its undefeated season with the victory, sitting high on the peak of Pac-12 football. \nThe first quarter was rough for the Utes. Arizona State led 10-7 at the end of it, but Utah started the second quarter with a bang. In what is arguably the catch of the year, Travis Wilson found Kenneth Scott for a 42-yard first down completion. Scott, nicknamed Batman, caught the ball with one hand and left Rice-Eccles Stadium — and the nation — in complete awe.

Utah thought so as Wilson threw to Scott on the next play for an 11-yard touchdown. Scott finished the night as the Utes' leading receiver with 116 yards on five catches.

The turning point of the game came when Britain Covey caught a punt return in the end zone. In a failed trick play, he passed an illegal forward pass to Bubba Poole in the end zone, resulting in a safety to put the Sun Devils up 15-14. It left Ute Nation with frustration and rightfully so.
