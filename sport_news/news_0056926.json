This week will be the final time they play a game at Don Paul Stadium. And next week, barring a near-miracle occurrence in the playoffs points seedings, Ross’ seniors will play the last game of their high school careers. \n“The fact that I only have two more weeks to come in here and be a part of the team kind of bums me out,” senior linebacker Tyler Schell said. “But it also makes me feel a little more dangerous, like we’re going to go out and cause some havoc on St. Francis, because why not? \n“With only two weeks left, you’ve got to give up everything, give up your body because it’s a long offseason, and who knows if you’ll play in college or not.” \nThe Little Giants (3-5 overall, 1-4 Three Rivers Athletic Conference) will play their final home game at 7 p.m. Friday as they host St. Francis de Sales (1-7, 0-5). \n“It’s very bitter,” senior running back Isaiah McDonald said of his final home game. “It’s unreal, so we just have to really enjoy these last few moments we have together. We hope it goes by slow, especially the last four quarters, I hope it goes by slow.” \nRoss coach Craig Yeast said the Little Giants started stressing the season’s finality after their Week 6 loss to Toledo Whitmer. He said he thought that translated into an increased sense of urgency in Ross’ 28-14 win over Oregon Clay last week. He said the Little Giants need that sense of urgency to continue Friday and for next week’s finale at Findlay. \n“For the seniors, this is it,” Yeast said. “They’ll never play on this field again after Friday. The most important thing for them is to finish and have a positive experience when they walk off that field. Hopefully that’s with a win.” \nWhile Ross is coming off snapping its four-game losing streak, St. Francis hasn’t won since its season opener. While the Knights have played a tough schedule — they haven’t played an opponent whose record is currently under .500 — they’ve also struggled to score points. Last week’s 42-14 loss to Whitmer was the first time since Week 1 that St. Francis scored more than seven points. \nDespite St. Francis’ struggles, the Little Giants know they can’t look at the Knights’ record and presume and easy victory. \n“If we take them for granted, we’re going to find ourselves in a game,” senior running back Uriah Haun. “(Defensive coordinator Troy) Albright was telling us yesterday, just because they’re record is what it is, it doesn’t mean anything. We can’t allow them any type of breathing room in the game at all.” If you go \nWhat : Little Giants’ final home game of 2015 season: St. Francis de Sales (1-7 overall, 0-5 Three Rivers Athletic Conference) at Fremont Ross (3-5, 1-4) \nWhen: 7 p.m. Friday", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T03:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T02:13:28.377+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
