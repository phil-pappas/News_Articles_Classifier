MENA reported that among the deals to be signed are ones related to the military.\nThe French presidency said in a statement Wednesday that Egypt agreed in late September to buy two Mistral warships that France had built for Russia before scrapping the sale over the Ukraine crisis. No deals have yet been reached.\nIsmail and Valls will hold a press conference late Saturday in Cairo following talks and the signing of the deals.\nThe French embassy said on its official website that “This movement will strengthen economic ties and will allow the prime minister to support the presence of French companies in the Middle East.”\nParis and Cairo have enjoyed close economic ties in the past but the turmoil that followed the overthrow of Mubarak in 2011 left Western governments wary of signing deals, especially ones pertaining to defence.\nIn February, Egypt announced a 5.2 billion Euro deal to buy 24 French Rafale jet fighters.\nThat same month Egypt signed a contract with the French company VINCI Bouygues Travaux Public to complete the construction of the fourth phase of Cairo’s third metro line.\nFrench officials from the country’s development agency, who attended Egypt’s economic development conference in Sharm El-Sheikh in March, announced that the agency will provide a 40 million Euro sovereign loan to finance a power plant in Kom Ombo in Upper Egypt.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T14:53:14.438+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
