The Canucks won 3-1. Mandatory Credit: Joe Camporeale-USA TODAY Sports The Canucks seem to have lost their backup goalie for the time being, but it appears nobody knows exactly how much time Jacob Markstrom will miss. In a season that was supposed to be Markstrom's initiation into the NHL goaltending world, the 25-year-old is off to a rough start with a lower-body injury right out of the gate.\nSportsNet's John Shannon issued conflicting reports Thursday about the goaltender's status.\nTold that Jacob Markstrom is out atleast 3 weeks with a lower body injury...team will reassess at that point. #canucks\n— John Shannon (@JSportsnet) October 8, 2015\nRevised timeline for Markstrom's injury. Re-evaluation will occur within 7 days before any further decisions. #canucks\n— John Shannon (@JSportsnet) October 9, 2015 Markstrom suffered the injury in practice on Tuesday and was unable to travel with the team to Calgary Wednesday for the season opener. In his absence, the Canucks called up Richard Bachman from AHL Utica to serve as Ryan Miller's backup.\nThe Canucks' first back-to-back of the season comes next week, when they face the Anaheim Ducks Monday night followed by the Los Angeles Kings Tuesday night. It seems Bachman could get a start in net in one of those games.\nMORE NEWS: Want stories delivered to you? Sign up for our NHL newsletters.
