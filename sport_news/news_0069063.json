In a five-set win over rival Cox, Irizarry Pares racked up 33 assists and 24 kills – numbers normally split between two players.\nIrizarry Pares credits watching film – something he’s done since he was 12 years old – and attending professional volleyball matches in Puerto Rico for his precocious talents. But they aren’t attributes he broadcasts.\n“People ask me if I’m a very good player and I don’t like to tell them an answer,” Irizarry Pares said. “Because then they will think I am cocky. I’m not that type of person to brag about that.”\nHe also wasn’t one to bemoan injuries. Irizarry Pares dealt with knee and ankle troubles throughout the year. He had tendinitis in his left knee a couple years ago and it flares up occasionally. He twisted his ankle over the summer and his first action back was high school tryouts.\n“You could tell,” said Hodges, who sometimes kept Irizarry Pares from jumping at practices. “He was stiff at times. But he never complained about it. If he gets 100 percent healthy, he’ll be even more dominant than he was.”\nFirst Colonial (27-3) won the Conference 1 regular-season title, part of a 20-match winning streak. The Patriots fell in the Eastern Zone semifinals to eventual state champion Princess Anne.\n“It was very hard because everyone I talked to at school, they had high hopes for us,” Irizarry Pares said.\nThe early elimination stung, but one memory Hodges will keep with him is when Irizarry Pares cracked an attack off an opposing player’s head. Irizarry Pares, who led the team in honor calls, didn’t boast.\n“The first thing he did,” Hodges said, “was walk under the net to check and make sure he was OK.”\n____\nALL-TIDEWATER FIRST TEAM\nPLAYER OF THE YEAR | Eli Emanuelle Irizarry Pares , First Colonial\n6-foot-3 junior setter/outside hitter Conference 1 co-Player of the Year Recorded 307 kills, 233 assists, 59 digs, 59 blocks and 49 aces “Does everything at a high level.” – coach Gary Hodges ____\nKyle Barnes , Princess Anne\n6-foot-3 junior outside hitter Conference 9 Player of the Year Averaged 12 kills, two blocks and two aces per match Barnes stood out on the deepest team in Virginia, stifling opponents with a rocket arm, jump serve and dependable passing. “The most consistent hitter in the state.” – coach Jeff Kinser ____\nSeth Blevins , First Colonial\n6-foot-3 junior outside hitter/setter Tallied 302 kills, 147 assists, 55 digs, 43 blocks and 38 aces All-Conference 1 first team Already one of the best hitters in the state, Blevins added setting to his resume this year.
