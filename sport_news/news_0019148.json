Attorney General Michael Lauber told reporters he did not rule out searching the Nyon headquarters of UEFA as part of the investigation.\nLauber’s office has said Blatter is suspected of making a “disloyal payment” of 2 million Swiss francs ($2.05 million) to Platini in 2011 at the expense of FIFA.\nBoth men have denied any wrongdoing and said the payment was legitimate compensation for work Platini undertook for FIFA.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T00:37:16.672+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
