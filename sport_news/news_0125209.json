Cocktails, from Tasty N Alder bar manager Jeremy Meilen, will blend Spanish-inspired classics with modernist technique. Sarah Scofield, Toro Bravo's floor manager, is also moving over to Pollo Bravo.\nOnce open, Pine Street Market, one of America's most anticipated food halls , will span the entire ground floor of the United Carriage and Baggage Transfer Building in Portland's Old Town, bringing nearly a dozen Portland restaurants, breweries, bakeries and more together under one roof. Confirmed tenants include Barista, Hopworks Urban Brewery, Patrick McKee, Olympia Provisions, baker Ken Forkish and more. Andina, which was previously announced as a market tenant, has pulled out.\nPine Street Market is expected to open near the end of the year at 126 S.W. 2nd Avenue. Between now and then, look for Pollo Bravo to pop up at Gorham's Plaza de Toro .
