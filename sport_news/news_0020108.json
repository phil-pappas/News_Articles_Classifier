The PBA season opens on Sunday.\n“I’m happy with the makeup of the team, we do have six new players. I think we have become bigger, stronger and talented. At the same time, I do understand we still have to blend the team together to become a stronger unit. It may take some time.”\n“We just have to give it little bit of time for the team to develop the cohesion and teamwork to be successful in PBA,” added the 57-year-old Black, now in his second season with the Bolts.\nOf all the new acquisitions, the likely focus will be on Alapag, who, at 37, is entering his 13th season in the pro league.\nThe 5-foot-9 point guard retired after 12 seasons and one conference (Philippine Cup) with Talk ’N Text early this year. He then served as team manager of TNT in the next two conferences.\nAlapag tried out for Gilas Pilipinas in the last FIBA Asia Championship in Changsha, China when the team struggled to form a strong roster. Though he failed to make the team, it rekindled his desire to play perhaps one more season in the PBA.\nBlack welcomed him. “I think he gives us an upgrade at the point guard position,” said Black, who mentored Alapag at TNT that won the Philippine Cup in 2013. “We’ll utilize his leadership and mentor our young point guards particularly Amer. But right now, I’m bringing him as point guard to play and perform.”\n“He basically looks the same. Obviously, he has to get his timing back coming off injury (hamstring). But he has been practicing fulltime every day. He’s been playing scrimmage games, and he’s performing well,” added Black.\nAs part of their preparation in the Philippine Cup, the Bolts went to Las Vegas for a training camp. The team also played a couple of preseason games, beating TNT and Blackwater but lost to Barako Bull.", "external_links": ["http://i.po.st/static/v3/post-widget.js#publisherKey=4qcr4d26tnrf260rqrda&retina=true"], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T18:58:15.209+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
