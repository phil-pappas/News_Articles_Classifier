But Fredette was underwhelming, scoring four points in 26 minutes in the preseason. \nFredette was the 10th overall pick by Sacramento in 2011 after a sensational career at BYU. He has struggled in the NBA, bouncing around to Chicago and New Orleans as well before landing the tryout with San Antonio. \nFredette is now looking for his fifth team in five years. \nAll content copyright ©2015 Pendleton Times-Post, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T02:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T03:36:56.223+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
