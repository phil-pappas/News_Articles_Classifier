Photo: Getty Images\nThe A-Z of Jarryd Hayne Jerry Rice: Why I am excited for Jarryd Hayne The beginner's guide to NFL 2015 AFC season preview 2015 NFC season preview It's not yet clear whether Jarryd Hayne will play against the Arizona Cardinals this weekend.\nHayne's prospects could hang with the fitness of veteran San Francisco 49ers running back and punt returner Reggie Bush.\n49ers coach Jim Tomsula said on Friday that Bush and the calf strain that kept him out of last week's loss to the Pittsburgh Steelers was \"looking really good\".\nAdvertisement However, Tomsula added Bush would have to practise on Friday to be included for Sunday's Arizona game and the former Heisman Trophy winner was not on the field with his team-mates during the part of the session open to the media.\n\"If he's really rolling and feeling really good then we will move accordingly, but if there's anything there, we're not going to do it,\" Tomsula, detailing his plans for Bush, said.\nThe 49ers will likely play three running backs in Arizona and if Bush is out, that will leave Hayne, Carlos Hyde and Mike Davis.\nTomsula also said punt returner Bruce Ellington could be back from injury for the Cardinals game, again possibly squeezing Hayne out of the 46-man game day squad.\nIt will be announced 90 minutes before the game if Hayne is in the squad.\nDespite Bush and Ellington both sitting out of the Steelers loss, Hayne had little playing time, with the 49ers going to Davis and returner DeAndrew White.\nAAP", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T20:40:46.643+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
