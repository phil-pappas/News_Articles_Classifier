After Sehwag left Delhi for Haryana this season on a bitter note, this is the first time he will play against Delhi, a team he was identified with ever since he made his mark on the domestic scene.\nSehwag's presence usually generates buzz and excitement. It did on Wednesday too when he came for practice. He parked the car right next to the training area, where the Delhi team was going through the drills. And even as he hovered around the area, customary pleasantries weren't exchanged. There was no acknowledgement of each other's presence. Even DDCA officials kept their distance from Sehwag, arguably Delhi's greatest cricketer. The vibes, sadly, were cold and there was tension in the air.\nSehwag has served Delhi cricket for almost two decades since his junior days. But his departure this season was not without rancour. It seemed to weigh on the minds of both sides, more so on Delhi players and officials.\nDelhi coach Vijay Dahiya tried his best to make light of the situation despite seeing Delhi's own Viru wearing the opponent's cap. \"It's a match between two teams. That's how I look at it. We play as a team against a team. If somebody plays as an individual, it's a different thing,\" was Dahiya's remark after much cajoling from the media.\nHaryana coach Surendra Bhave, meanwhile, chose to point out the positives the stalwart brought to the table for his unit, more so with an in-form Ishant Sharma looking to extract the most out of a fairly responsive pitch. \"Sehwag knows the ground and the Delhi team inside out. He has been fantastic with the younger players. And he is also batting superbly. That should be of great help on a pitch that looks like producing a result,\" Bhave said.\nIshant has already declared his plan for Sehwag after inspiring Delhi to a victory over Vidarbha last week. \"Get him out. That's the only plan,\" the imposing fast bowler had said. While Ishant will spearhead his attack, Delhi will field experienced seamers Parvinder Awana and Pawan Suyal who will take the field in place of the injured Sumit Narwal and Sarang Rawat. Perhaps, a bit of extra pace is what the Delhi skipper is looking at to get the better of his long-time friend.\nHaryana too have a decent bowling line-up and it should be a gripping battle over the next four days at the Kotla.
