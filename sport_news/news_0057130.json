(For OzarksSportsZone.com) -- The Winona Lady Wildcats are the Class 1, District 6 champions for the fourth year in a row. The three-time reigning state champs topped the Fordland Lady Eagles in two games, 28-26 and 25-19, to claim the title.“Fordland had very good defense,” said Winona head coach Francie McBride. “They were a really tough team. We played up and down at times, so I wasn’t very happy with that, but when we needed to, we stepped up and played hard.” In game one, Fordland scored the first point, but Winona held the Lady Eagles to two points while they went on a seven-point run. The Lady Wildcats soon led 18-11. That’s when Fordland took off on a scoring run of their own, earning the next seven points and tying the game, 18-18. The teams remained in a dead heat, back and forth to 26 all, but Winona claimed the final two points to win the first game. CLICK HERE FOR PHOTOS OF THE GAME Winona ran away with the second game, 20-10, but once again Fordland fought back, coming within four points near the close of the game, 18-22. The Lady Eagles’ run stalled there, as they added just one more point and Winona took home the win.“Bridgette Rutledge was great offensively,” said McBride. “Lilly Wright led us in aces and she had seven aces in one set. Setting by Madison Counts was very good. Tesla McGee is our libero, and she’s just outstanding.” Kyndal Thomason had 13 kills for the Lady Wildcats. Madison Counts picked up 17 assists, and Bridgette Rutledge added 18 digs. Tesla McGee had 12 digs and 2 aces on the night. In her second year of coaching the Fordland Lady Eagles, Laurel McDaniel has now faced Winona twice.“Last year, Winona beat us easily. Coming into districts, we expected to meet up with them in the championship game again. I feel like this year, with both our returners and our new faces, we were a little bit more prepared. We kind of knew more of what to expect.” McDaniel knew her team had to play their best to top the district favorite.“I was really proud of them in that first set when we came back and only lost by two. In the second set, we started out slow and had to come back,” McDaniel said. “I was proud of how much they came back even though it didn’t work out for us.” Notable stats for Fordland included 21 assists for Amanda Mitchell, 11 kills for Ali Sparks, and 13 digs and 3 aces for Sophie Sparks.“My libero, Sophie Sparks, is a freshman. She really stepped up, and she is phenomenal. The pressure didn’t affect her at all.” McDaniel will graduate four of her starters, and Fordland concludes the season with a 25-4-1 record.“We have a lot of talent, but we are very young,” said Coach McBride about her Lady Wildcats. “We’ve won three championships the past three years, but we have a lot of experience with girls that weren’t playing a big role. This year, we kind of have a balanced offense. Everyone has a part of it. We have a much stronger defense than we’ve had in the past, which is really nice, so we’re just kind of feeling our way. But I think that we are very strong.” The Lady Wildcats will face the Eminence Lady Redwings on Saturday to begin the state tournament.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T09:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T10:40:08.697+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
