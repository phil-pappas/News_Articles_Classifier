It sailed wide left.\nIllinois (3-1) will take a victory in any form and with any assistance, especially knowing Big Ten play begins Saturday against Nebraska.\n\"I've never seen an ugly win,\" Cubit said. \"It's either a win or a loss. We're going to take it. Usually you don't win games like that.\"\nThe offense lacked lift. The return game sputtered. The defense mostly held steady, forcing six three-and-out series, but the unit gave up what could have been two costly fourth-down conversions on Middle Tennessee's final drive.\n\"I know we have to play better,\" Cubit said. \"I'm just trying to win one game at a time.\"\nWhile Cubit said he had confidence in Zalewski's leg, he chose to go for it on fourth-and-2 from the Middle Tennessee 4-yard line in the third quarter with a 17-12 lead. The Illini burned two timeouts setting up for the fourth-down play, which culminated in a dropped pass.\n\"I probably should have kicked the field goal,\" Cubit said. \"Looking back it would have been easier to kick the field goal. I'm at fault too.\"\nAfter Illinois took a 24-12 lead heading into the fourth quarter, Middle Tennessee struck back with two touchdowns. The Blue Raiders (2-2) claimed a 25-24 lead on a 22-yard touchdown pass from Brent Stockstill to Ed Batties with 4:11 remaining.\nIllinois' final drive was kept alive by a 26-yard completion from Wes Lunt to Geronimo Allison before the Illini trotted Zalewski onto the field.\nZalewski had missed three straight field-goal attempts (57- and 45-yarders last weekend at North Carolina and a 38-yarder in the first quarter against Middle Tennessee) before converting a 23-yard field goal in the second quarter against the Blue Raiders. The 51-yarder was not out of the question for Zalewski, who kicked a 54-yarder against Purdue in 2012 and a 51-yarder against Northwestern in 2013.\nBut he had struggled mightily at Illinois, just 19 of 30 in his first three seasons. Last season he missed half of his six field-goal attempts.\n\"Last year is out of my head,\" he said. \"I really don't think about it anymore. I don't care about the last kick. It's about making the next kick.\"\nsryan@tribpub.com\nTwitter @sryantribune\n2-minute drill\nFreshman flash: Freshman running back Ke'Shawn Vaughn \"came of age\" Saturday, according to interim coach Bill Cubit. With Josh Ferguson (20 carries, 83 yards) limited with leg cramps, Vaughn stepped in and picked up all 80 of his yards in the second half on 13 carries. He had an 8-yard touchdown run in the third quarter. .\n\"Fej\" feeling it: Illinois safety Clayton Fejedelem's journey from NAIA player to walk-on to Big Ten starter has been well-documented. He had a standout day Saturday to add to his tale. He recovered a blocked punt in the end zone for a score and finished with 12 tackles and three pass breakups.\nYet again: For the second time this season, Illinois blocked a punt and returned it for a touchdown. In his first game after serving a three-game suspension for a violation of team rules, Caleb Day blocked the punt in the second quarter that Fejedelem recovered for a 14-3 lead.\nReceiver rut: Cubit described Geronimo Allison (10 catches, 128 yards) as the one dependable receiver. Quarterback Wes Lunt looked visibly frustrated at times and said afterward that he and the receivers saw \"different coverages.\"\n Illinois Fighting Illini Nebraska Cornhuskers Purdue Boilermakers", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-56072bac/turbine/ct-illinois-mtsu-football-spt-0927-20150926"], "published": "2015-09-27T05:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T16:10:16.755+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
