Think of yourself as a way-out-there outfielder. Sometimes, Hample is on his feet the whole game, scampering back and forth in the bleachers from left field to right. Don’t stay in your ticketed seat unless you have to. Seek out designated standing areas or move to an aisle seat in a sparsely populated row. ‘‘Lateral mobility is key,’’ Hample says. In the off-season, he writes books about baseball and works at Argosy, his family’s Manhattan bookstore. During the season, he traverses the country as a so-called ball hawk, snagging balls that he stores in giant plastic barrels in his mother’s basement.
