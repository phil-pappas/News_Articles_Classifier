Derek Anderson, 2000-01: Anderson played just one season in San Antonio. But what a season it was, with his averages of 15.5 points, 4.4 rebounds, 3.7 assists and 1.5 steals placing him next to Ginobili and Parker as the only players to reach those thresholds in the Duncan era.

Back in 1997, the older boys still believed it was their own, that no kid — regardless of where he came from or what he did before — could just walk in and claim it.\nHe had to prove himself to join the club.\nIt didn't take long for the kid from the Virgin Islands to make it known that the land, the equipment, the jungle gym and the seesaw and everything in-between, belonged to him.\nNow, the NBA has provided us a glimpse into the past by releasing a video of Duncan's first ever 20-point game.\nIt didn't take the 21-year-old long to establish himself as a force.\nOn Nov. 11, 1997 — Duncan's seventh game as a pro — the No. 1 overall pick broke through the 20-point barrier for the first time, scoring 22 points against the Timberwolves.\nOne down, 776 to go.\nThe video is a reminder both of what Duncan was immediately capable of and how he has evolved as time has (sort of) caught up.\nYoung Duncan's ability to get off the floor so quickly is remarkable for a man of his stature.\nRELATED: Photo of young Tim Duncan, Chris Paul featured by SI Vault\nAge has transformed Duncan into a more plodding figure in recent years, but his first-step used to be a nightmare for opposing bigs. On one dunk in the video, his defender, Cherokee Parks is still trying to reconcile what just happened while Duncan is flying in for a two-handed slam.\nAnd he's already showcasing the genius post footwork he'd come to be known for in the coming years. Duncan is just a rookie here, but he's already duping defenders with shimmies and shuffles and head fakes ripped straight from Kevin McHale's all-time reel.\nJust days away from his 19th season, Duncan is far removed from that recent college grad we see in the video, but you can see the line, can see how he got from then to now .\nAnd even now, all these years later, the playground is still his.\nnmoyle@express-news.net\nTwitter: @NRMoyle", "external_links": ["http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/20/75/07/4444626/9/920x920.jpg",
