In the semifinals awaited the Washington Spirit, the same team it squeaked past at the same stage last season. Then Kansas City upset Chicago on the road, and the serendipity of a rematch was on.\nMost Read Stories Parents of toddler killed in Bellevue to return to India At least 9 killed in Roseburg, Ore., college shooting; gunman dead Man charged with breaking $120K Chihuly sculpture in Tacoma Time running out on Seattle family’s ‘golden ticket’ to landing home Former Seattle Times building now home to thieves, squatters Unlimited Digital Access. $1 for 4 weeks. Seattle dominated the 2014 campaign so thoroughly that it clinched the regular-season title with more than a month to spare. But in the title game, the Reign was upset 2-1 in front of stunned home fans.\nSeattle doesn’t get nervous, no matter what the stakes — at least according to star attacker Kim Little. Looseness is in this team’s DNA, and more than one player credits the team’s success to the relaxed locker room vibe that coach Laura Harvey has encouraged.\n“Not being arrogant, we just have the belief that we’re good enough to beat any team,” Little said earlier this week. “Just the relaxed nature of our club helps us. We don’t feel the pressure, don’t feel nervous. When we’re relaxed, that’s when we play our best football.”\nBlame the stakes, blame two talented teams warily eying each other up, but Thursday’s match was anxious from the start.\nEarly on, at least there were scoring chances: Rodriguez shook free for a decent look 12 minutes in, then Little fired right into KC goalkeeper Nicole Barnhart’s arms when released on a counterattack. From there on out, though, the teams mostly just poked and prodded.\nReign midfielder Megan Rapinoe smashed a shot off the left post midway through the second half, but otherwise, the game looked destined for added time. \nThen Lauren Holiday found Heather O’Reilly, who hooked in a cross for Rodriguez’ head. Rodriguez’s header caught Seattle goalkeeper Hope Solo leaning.\nThe Reign pressed, huffing and puffing until the last.\nBut for the second straight year, Kansas City held on. For the second straight year, Reign bodies sank dejected to the turf as white-shirted opponents screamed in triumph around them.\nMatt Pentz: 206-464-3184 or mpentz@seattletimes.com .
