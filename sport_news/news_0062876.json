The junior forward had three goals and seven points in his first 11 games, and was a bright spot in an otherwise dismal 4-10-1 start for the University of New Hampshire hockey team. But he gradually began to tail off as the 2014-15 season progressed, to the point where he was a scratch for 12 of the last 13 games. MacDonald was starting to wear down after working so hard during the previous summer to come back from a severe injury, and he didn’t have much left for the second half of the season. He ended up dressing for only 20 of the 40 games. “With the injury, it was scary there for a little bit,” MacDonald said. “I spent a few weeks in the hospital. Once I got out and knew the path I needed to take to get back, and I knew it was going to take a while. I tried to rush it going into last year just to make it through the year, and may have taken a step back. “It was hard,” he added. Toward the end of his sophomore year, the New Jersey native suffered a broken femur during practice when he fell awkwardly on the ice and slid into the boards. The leg required surgery in early February of 2014 to repair the fracture, and the complications afterward took even more of a toll. First, he developed a blood clot that traveled to his lungs. “I wasn’t breathing properly the next day,” MacDonald said. “They couldn’t figure out why so they did a scan on my chest. Luckily, I was still in the hospital. When that happens you’re automatically out six months because you’re on a certain type of blood thinner.” The leg then became infected, and that led to more surgery. Overall, he spent almost three weeks combined in the hospital and a rehab facility. “It wasn’t that bad for me,” he said, “because I didn’t know what was going on half the time because I was in and out and on all kinds of medicine. For my parents, I could see it in their faces when I’d talk about it. It was pretty scary for them.” “When we learned what had happened we realized it was pretty bad and could have gone worse,” said junior defenseman Matias Cleland. “He just handled it unbelievable. He never showed doubt in his character.” Once he was released from the hospital, MacDonald’s sole focus was to be in the lineup for the start of the 2014-15 season. Although he didn’t dress for the opener, he did play in 10 of the next 11 games and produced offensively. “He put in a lot of hard work off the ice rehabbing it and all that,” Cleland said. “That says a lot about his work ethic, and the attitude he kept throughout the whole thing was unbelievable.” With five points in his first seven games last year, MacDonald surpassed the combined total of his previous two seasons at UNH. “He went through a lot his sophomore year,” said coach Dick Umile. “His injury was a pretty serious one. I think he battled back last year, but not quite to 100 percent. It affected him last year. He won’t admit it, but it’s obviously nerve-wracking when you’re coming off something like that, and you play a physical game like he does.” “I spent half the summer learning how to run and skate again,” MacDonald said. “I don’t think I skated until July. I just made it back for the season because I had to get off that medicine. My whole goal last summer was to get back and play my junior year. I had a pretty good start, but it kind of caught up with me. “I guess I didn’t have all my strength back and that kind of stuff,” he added. “I don’t think I came back too early, but you only get four years so you want to get as much as you can.” The past offseason went much better for the rising senior, who was voted captain by his teammates, despite playing in only 51 of a possible 120 games with just 10 career points. “I think he’s a great leader on and off the ice,” Cleland said. “Maybe he doesn’t have the numbers, but he does the little stuff right, and he’s big-time for us in that locker room.” The Wildcats open their season Saturday night against AIC at the Whittemore Center. “It was pretty serious stuff,” MacDonald said of his ordeal. “I didn’t really realize it until it was all over. Sometimes I think about it, and I’m thankful to still be playing for sure.” “He’s well-respected,” Umile said. “There’s no doubt that he’s the team leader. He’s going to be a great captain.” MacDonald just wants to make it through the year healthy and help the team win. “I’ve had kind of a weird career,” he said. “Lot of ups and downs. The boys have kept me positive. I love being here still. I’m excited.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T02:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T11:15:15.344+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
