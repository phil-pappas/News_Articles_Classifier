Most Tulare County teams have played five of their 10 games, so it’s that time of the season for the Times-Delta/Advance-Register Midseason Report: \nTop Story Lines \n• Valley Fever: Tulare Union (5-0) is right where it needs to be in quest of the school’s fifth Central Section championship (1986, 1999, 2000 and 2008 were the previous section-winning seasons). If the Redskins finish up 10-0, they should be the No. 2 seed in Division II. Defending Division II champion Ridgeview (5-0) is the projected No. 1 seed. Two major questions surrounding the Redskins before the season started was the offensive prowess outside of star running back Romello Harris and the defense’s overall prowess? Tulare Union has uncovered another elite offensive playmaker in Kazmeir Allen, and the defense has done fairly well across the board. Will it be enough to dethrone Ridgeview? \n• For the History Books: Speaking of Harris, if he keeps his current per-game pace, the Tulare Union senior will become the Central Section’s all-time rushing leader when the Redskins meet the Mustangs on Nov. 6. Harris needs 1,472 yards to pass Mendota’s Edgar Segura (8,029 yards) for the Central Section career mark. He is 1,203 yards away from matching the school record set by Dominique Dorsey (1998-2000), who once held the state’s career rushing record. \n• Central Sequoia League Race: Don’t be surprised if the CSL race ends up with two or three teams sharing the league championship. On paper, it looks like the next five weeks is going to be one big Destruction Derby. Any team that comes out of the CSL unscathed has to be considered a major threat for a section championship during the postseason. \n• A Major Playoff Surprise?: The most competitive playoff bracket is shaping up to be in Division IV. Cesar Chavez (5-0) is the slight favorite, followed by Chowchilla and Madera South. Don’t dismiss CVC’s and Exeter’s title hopes, though. We’ll get a better idea of which county team has the best chance in Division IV when the Cavaliers visit the Monarchs. \nBob Mathias Award Watch \nA look at the top midseason candidates for the Bob Mathias Award, which honors Tulare County’s most outstanding player: \nRomello Harris, Tulare Union: The 2014 Times-Delta/Advance-Register Bob Mathias Award winner is the frontrunner after another remarkable start to the season. Despite missing the Kingsburg game with a broken finger, Harris leads the Central Section with 1,190 yards rushing and 15 touchdowns. Of the statistics reported to Maxpreps.com , Harris ranks fifth in the nation and No. 1 in the state in averaging 297.5 yards rushing per game. \nKolin Stock, CVC: Senior has thrived as the Cavaliers’ featured running back. Stock has amassed 825 yards rushing and 10 touchdowns in five games. He’s topped the 100-yard mark in all five games, and has scored multiple touchdowns in three games. He’s averaging 7.2 yards per carry. \nIsaiah Jones, Porterville: Jones sat out last week’s 45-12 loss to Buchanan after suffering an injury in a 28-27 win over Dinuba. When Jones has been on the field, he’s been outstanding. He scored two two touchdowns to go with 185 yards rushing in the win over the Emperors. He could be a threat to average 250-plus yards rushing during EYL action, which begins tonight with Porterville hosting Mission Oak. \nGene Pryor, Mt. Whitney: Pioneers’ stalwart lineman has been outstanding on both sides of the ball. He’s been an anchor to offensive line that is introducing new starters at the skill positions. The Pioneers have scored at least 19 points in every game. Facing a steady diet of double-team blocks, Pryor has registered 13 tackles from his interior defensive line post. \nElijah Benham, Dinuba: The Emperors’ senior tailback ranks among Central Section leaders with 551 yards rushing and 10 rushing touchdowns. Benham has rushed for 125 yards or more in three of the Emperors’ six games. \nBreakout Stars \nA look at the area’s top emerging talents (in alphabetical order): \nNate Aleman, Mt. Whitney: Former Tulare Western student has become a valuable two-way player for the Pioneers. Aleman, a senior, leads the Pioneers in receptions (22). He has 275 yards receiving and two touchdowns. He ranks seconds in the Central Section with five interceptions. \nKazmeir Allen, Tulare Union: Best thing to happen to the Redskins this year might have been the injury suffered by Harris against Kingsburg. With Harris out of the lineup, it moved Allen to the tailback role, and the sophomore responded with a 321-yard, four-touchdown performance in the 45-19 win over the Vikings. In Tulare Union’s next game, a 35-19 win over Dinuba, Allen had 10 catches for 132 yards. His outstanding speed and play-making ability bring another dimension to the Redskins’ potent attack. He complicates things for opposing defensive coordinators. \nAlec Trujillo, Exeter: The freshman quarterback directed the Monarch offense to five touchdowns in a 41-24 win over Mission Oak, marking the first time the Hawks have allowed that many points to a Tulare County team since 2011. He backed up that performance by throwing for five touchdowns (tying a school single-game record) in last week’s 38-7 win over Wasco. \nMichael Villa, Mission Oak: The senior receiver is among Central Section leaders with six touchdown catches and a 20.8 yards-per-reception average. Ranks among county leaders with 416 yards receiving. \nJed Whetstone, Mt. Whitney: Junior linebacker ranks second on the team in tackles (32), and is developing a penchant for making big plays. He has a forced fumble and interception to his credit along with a momentum-changing safety that sparked the Pioneers to a 22-14 win over El Diamante. \nHonor Roll \nA look at some units/teams/players that deserve some recognition: \nExeter defense: Trujillo is garnering a lot of attention with his passing exploits, but the defense is a major reason why the Monarchs are 5-1. Exeter has recorded 43.5 tackles for loss, averaging more than seven per game, to go with six interceptions. \nMt. Whitney secondary: Pioneers lead Tulare County with 11 defensive interceptions. They also top all 20 of the section’s Division III teams in that category. \nCameron Horsting, Tulare Western: The Mustangs’ senior placekicker, a 2014 Times-Delta/Advance-Register all-Tulare County second-team pick, has a pair of 45-yard field goals to his credit. He’s also a valuable weapon for the Mustang defense/special teams, delivering automatic touchbacks on 11 of 19 kickoffs. \nEric Schwarz, Woodlake: Senior quarterback will have a pivotal role in the Tigers’ quest for the East Sequoia League championship. Through the first four games, Schwarz was averaging 170.8 yards passing per game to go with a 66.0 completion rate. He leads Tulare County with a 123.8 NFL-formula passing efficiency rating. \nTop Games \nTop five games remaining in the Tulare County regular season: \n1. Tulare Union at Porterville, Oct. 23: The big game turned in by Redwood’s Justin Williams against Tulare Union (346 yards from scrimmage, four touchdowns) suggests that the Redskins could be in some trouble when facing a top-flight back. Jones is the best running back inside county lines not named Romello Harris. \n2. Central Valley Christian at Exeter, Oct. 16: If the Cavaliers and Monarchs both win on Friday — both face difficult tests — this should probably be regarded as the No. 1 game. \n3. Dinuba at Exeter, Nov. 6: Regular-season finale between the Emperors and Monarchs could have Central Sequoia League title implications for both teams. \n4. Tulare Union vs. Tulare Western, Nov. 6: Mustangs would love nothing better than to spoil the Redskins’ bid for a perfect 10-0 season, a No. 2 Division II playoff seed and an outright East Yosemite League championship. If the Mustangs from the first half of the Madera game show up, this could be very interesting. \n5. Redwood vs. Mt. Whitney, Nov. 6: The 61st edition of the Cowhide Game is shaping up to be the game that determines the Sid Hosking Trophy winner. Mt. Whitney could be playing for a shot at one of the top four Division III playoff seeds. 55 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://vtd-tar.co/1RuYbVi TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T08:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T18:25:51.391+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
