While half the SDSU fans had left by late in the fourth quarter, Bison fans stuck around to see the NDSU players rush the south end zone to lay their hands on the Marker trophy once again. \nIt would be hard to argue that the more talented team didn’t win this one, but Jacks coach John Stiegelmeier suggested afterward there’s more to it than that. While his players said all the right things in the days leading up to the game about being ready for the challenge, they didn’t show it. \n“Here’s where I think they have a leg up on us,” Stiegelmeier said. “When they walk on the field they believe they’re going to win the game. When we walked on the field, I don’t know if all 77 players of ours that put on a jersey today believed we could win. That’s a frustration.” \nAfter this result, it’ll be hard for SDSU to muster confidence for the next meeting. \nNDSU’s offense methodically picked apart the Jackrabbit defense, using a by-committee ground attack to complement quarterback Carson Wentz, a 6-foot-6 senior who lived up to the NFL hype that surrounds him. But perhaps more alarmingly, their defense totally overmatched the Jacks’ offense, holding them to -4 rushing yards, limiting star receiver Jake Wieneke to three catches and battering quarterback Zach Lujan all game long. \nThe Bison led the Jacks 21-0 at halftime, at which point SDSU’s offense had looked nothing like the juggernaut that came in averaging over 40 points and 500 yards per game. While the Jacks found a little room to move in the second half, it wasn’t much. They turned it over on downs at the 1-yard line in the third quarter, and blew a red zone chance with penalties in the fourth. CFB Roundup: USF bullies Wayne State “We’ve played ‘em so much we know what they do and they know what we do,” said Bison defensive end Greg Menard, who had three sacks. “So we just wanted to come out and be more physical than they were. Knock ‘em back and move the line of scrimmage backward. That was our gameplan.” \nSDSU converted 2-of-15 third downs. The Bison, who rushed for 202 yards, were 11-for-16 on 3rd downs. \n“They’re a very physical team, and they out-physicaled us,” said Lujan, who connected with Dallas Goedert from 26-yards out for SDSU’s only score late in the third quarter. “They punched us in the mouth right away and we didn’t respond to it.” \nThe Jacks got the ball first, and Lujan hit Cam Jones for a first down completion on the first play from scrimmage. That would not be a sign of things to come. The Jacks had just 51 yards and four first downs at the break. The Bison defense swarmed to the ball when SDSU ran it, and they constantly hounded Lujan when they passed it. CJ Smith spent the game covering Wieneke, and while both coaches credited Smith for playing well, the NDSU pass rush was a huge factor. Under duress, Lujan missed more throws in this one than in the first three games combined. He finished 19-of-38 for 242 yards. \nMeanwhile the Bison offense was surgical. They didn’t gash the Jacks with explosive plays, they wore them down with fine execution and impressive balance. Their third down success not only extended drives, it added to SDSU’s frustration. \nThe Bison led 14-0 after touchdown runs by King Frazier and Chase Morlock, and got a backbreaking score before half when Wentz hit Luke Albers on a two-yard drag to make it 21-0. \nWentz added a 27-yard touchdown run early in the third to push the lead to 28-0, and while the SDSU defense fought admirably from there, the Bison were playing conservatively by then. \n“We know they’re good,” said Jacks linebacker Jesse Bobbit, who had 13 tackles. “But we’re good, too. We should’ve played better. We’ve got to execute better.” \nFirst Quarter \nNDSt—Frazier 2 run (Pedersen kick), 6:20. \nSecond Quarter \nNDSt—Morlock 3 run (Pedersen kick), 13:47. \nNDSt—Albers 2 pass from Ca.Wentz (Pedersen kick), :20. \nThird Quarter \nNDSt—Ca.Wentz 27 run (Pedersen kick), 10:10. \nSDSt—Goedert 26 pass from Lujan (Carlson kick), 1:04. \nA—17,348. \nINDIVIDUAL STATISTICS \nRUSHING—N.
