Bryant has been ruled out for Monday's game, and the Lakers only play one more preseason game, Thursday against the Golden State Warriors before beginning the regular season against the Minnesota Timberwolves the following Wednesday. If Bryant does not go, expect to see D'Angelo Russell and Jordan Clarkson retain their spots as the starting backcourt for now.\nAlso missing the Lakers' game in San Diego was guard Lou Williams. Williams has now been upgraded to probable for the Lakers' Monday night game against the Portland Trail Blazers after being held out to rest a sore groin.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.sbnation.com/nba/players/98699/byron-scott", "http://www.sbnation.com/nba/teams/sacramento-kings", "http://www.sbnation.com/nba/players/21869/kobe-bryant", "http://www.sbnation.com/nba/players/246165/jordan-clarkson", "http://www.nba.com/lakers/news/151018_injuryreport?cid=tw", "http://sbnation.com?utm_source=MSNbanner/", "http://www.sbnation.com/nba/teams/golden-state-warriors", "http://www.sbnation.com/nba/teams/los-angeles-lakers", "http://www.sbnation.com/nba/players/257516/d-angelo-russell", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "http://www.sbnation.com/nba/teams/portland-trail-blazers"], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T10:14:37.719+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
