Lions long snapper, a job he first landed 13 months ago when Jordan Matechuk suffered a finger injury that eventually required amputation. Benson has battled since the start of the 2012 to get a CFL job, and now that he has one he couldn't be more pleased. \n“I'm just happy to have a steady job finally, and Vancouver's been welcoming. It's gorgeous,” Benson said Friday in advance of a game against his hometown team, the Winnipeg Blue Bombers, on Saturday night at BC Place. “The coaching staff and everyone in B.C. is great. I'm just happy to finally reach that final goal. I had dreams, but dreams are only dreams unless you make goals. So it's nice to be here.” \nThe 5-foot-11, 238-pound 28-year-old was even able to survive his first head coaching change, too, as Jeff Tedford replaced Mike Benevides in the off-season. The good news for Benson is special teams co-ordinator Chuck McMann was kept on Tedford's staff. \n“We get along really well, and we see eye to eye on a lot of things,” Benson said, “so at least that was comfortable going into the new year.” \nBenson attended St. Paul's High School in Winnipeg and made the varsity team when he was in Grade 10 because he figured out how to long snap. \n“It was kind of a fluke thing,” Benson said. “I started in Grade 10 because someone got hurt.” \nLittle did he know then that being able to long snap could be the key to a professional career. It's something that clicked when he was a member of the Winnipeg Rifles junior squad. The natural linebacker then chose to play his CIS career with the Acadia Axemen in Wolfville, N.S., long snapping along the way. \nHe signed as an undrafted free agent with the Edmonton Eskimos in the spring of 2012, but he spent all but three games of his first two CFL seasons on their practice roster. The Eskimos didn't bring him back in 2014, so he signed with the Toronto Argonauts, who released him at the end of training camp. \nBenson was all set to begin looking for a real job when the Lions came calling late last August. He's been their long snapper ever since and has even made a pair of special teams tackles this season. \n“It's been steady employment, but battling through a lot of adversity, a lot of competition, trying to find a home that'll accept me,” Benson said. “B.C.'s been it, and so far it's been great. They treat me well, so I can't complain.” \nThe Bombers don't have any Manitobans on their team this year, but the Lions have three of them. Along with Benson, the Lions lineup also features Winnipeg natives Andrew Harris at running back and T-Dre Player on the offensive line. \nBenson and Harris have some football history that goes all the way back to high school, as he remembers his Crusaders disposing of Harris' Grant Park Pirates and Oak Park Raiders in the Winnipeg High School Football League playoffs. \n“I have the ring,” Benson said with a smile, “and I'll show him once in a while.” \nBenson still makes his off-season home in Winnipeg, where he trains young football players at Acceleration Performance in St. Boniface. \n“It's a football academy, but we also do general sports and specific clients and natural health and all that kind of thing,” Benson said. \nSo while Winnipeg may be his home, Vancouver quickly became the place where his football heart resides. \n“I've been on Edmonton and Toronto, and this is probably the most welcoming team so far,” Benson said. “There was none of that first week where you kind of get to know everyone. \n“Everyone was just like, 'Hey, welcome. Let's have a good time.' So I eased in really nicely. Since then it's been pretty good.” \nkirk.penton@sunmedia.ca", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T02:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T07:46:56.913+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
