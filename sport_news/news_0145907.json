Sunderland goalkeeper Costel Pantilimon could only parry Manuel Lanzini's effort and Dimitri Payet fired the rebound into the bottom right corner. \nAll content copyright ©2015 Pendleton Times-Post, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T19:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T19:58:52.389+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
