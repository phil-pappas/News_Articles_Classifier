And last Saturday, the Passaic Valley High football team put together its best game of the 2015 season, but came up just short in a 17-14 overtime loss to West Milford before an enthusiastic Homecoming Day crowd in Little Falls. \nChet Parlavecchio's Hornets will take an 0-5 mark into a game at Lakeland, in Wanaque, this Friday night starting at 6:30 p.m. \nThe Hornets were a feisty group last Saturday. Under perfect weather conditions, the team was fired up for its first victory of the 2015 campaign, after opening with losses against powerful teams in Wayne Valley, Wayne Hills and Ramapo. \n\"We wanted our kids to compete and I thought we did a good job of that last Saturday,\" said Parlavecchio. \"We played hard and created opportunities. As a coach, that's all I could ask for. There were chances to finish it, too, and that's what we have to learn from this game. We need to finish better.\" \nPassaic Valley took its first lead of the season in the first quarter when Chris Armagno ran for a three-yard score and Steve Luisa kicked the point-after to make it 7-0. \nThe Hornets would extend its lead to 14-0 in the second quarter on a scoring run by Vin Brigati, followed by another Luisa kick. That lead would hold until late in the third, when West Milford (2-3) began to chip away. \nThe Highlanders cut the lead in half on a long touchdown pass as the third quarter ended. Then, in the fourth, it appeared the Hornets' defense was in position to secure the victory. However, a very questionable pass interference call on PV gave West Milford new life and the Highlanders tied it with about two minutes left in regulation time. \nPassaic Valley would rally back as Luisa, the team's junior quarterback, led a drive deep into West Milford territory. But once again, a very questionable penalty against PV pushed the Hornets back and a long field goal by Armagno just missed its mark in the waning seconds, moving the contest into overtime. \nWest Milford got the ball first in overtime and kicked the go-ahead field goal. The Hornets then took possession, but were unable to garner a first down. A field goal attempt to tie it and move the game into a second OT was blocked. \n\"We didn't get the field goal attempt off quickly enough in the overtime,\" said Parlavecchio. \"The snap was good, but it took too long.\" \nParlavecchio was noticeably upset with some of the penalties against his team, especially in key situations in the fourth quarter. But the coach didn't want to comment on it in his postgame conversation. Instead, he looked to the positives of the contest. \n\"Football is supposed to be fun,\" Parlavecchio said to his team. \"I hope you had fun today, because that's what competing is all about. Are we happy about losing? Of course not, but we made strides today. We became a better football team. And now, we need to get ready for a good game at Lakeland (on Friday night). Let's go after it the same way we did today.\" \nNOTES: Brigati, a sophomore, is one of many youngsters who will give PV fans a lot of optimism for the future. He leads the Hornets in rushing this season and has gained 100, or more yards, in the last three games. On defense, Armagno and Joe Savittieri led the Hornets in tackles last Saturday. Junior linebacker Gianfranco Verdes and sophomore Tom Marretta, have also impressed on defense. \n\"We're very young,\" said Parlavecchio. \"We're getting better with each game.\" \nThe Hornets defeated Lakeland, 35-28, last season in the first matchup between the one-time rivals.
