They called deputies to the scene.\nThe Coroner's office is analyzing the remains found in the vehicle. It could take up to a week to identify the body and release a cause of death.\nThe vehicle was taken to the sheriff's office for processing. Deputies are working with the state fire marshal's office as they attempt to determine what caused the fire.\nOfficers describe the burnt car as a silver Mitsubishi. They said it had a license plate that is a partial match to one that belonged to missing Bush resident Nanette \"Me'Shell\" King. King, 42, has been missing for three weeks.\nShe was last seen leaving work at the Bush Shell Station on Highway 21 around 1 p.m. on Sept. 20.\nSheriff Jack Strain stressed that they do not have confirmation it was King's body found in the car.\n\"We have since the 20th of last month been working the disappearance of Miss King. That question will have to wait for the coroner's office to answer and until we know for a fact that it is, or is not, Miss King, we'll continue to work her as a missing person\"\nInvestigators continue to speak with several individuals who they believe will aid in the investigation. No arrests have yet been made in connection with this incident. The Sheriffâ€™s office asks that anyone with information related to this case please call 9-1-1 or Crimestoppers at 504-822-1111 (toll-free: 877-903-7867).\nCopyright 2015 WVUE .
