After going 14-1 during the regular season, Paupack earned a first round play off bye, and defeated the 2014 defending champs, Scranton Prep last Friday in the semi-final round. On Wednesday they would continue their 2015 tear defeated the Comets ofAbington Heights, 5 ½ - 3 ½, in the match that went down to the wire. Buckhorns Highlights The highlight of individual play was a riveting back and forth match between Paupack's, Molly Mowatt and Abington's Matt Mecca. Mowatt stroked an eagle on hole #2 to take an early lead in her match. Mecca battled back, however, keeping the match close by recording three birdies of his own. Drama ensued on the matches final few strokes when Mecca tied Mowatt by sinking a 25-foot putt. Forcing her to sick a 10-foot putt of her own to preserve her win, which she promptly as though she was in the middle of practice, rather than the final strokes of a league championship. “ She told me was trying to keep her head still, and when she looked up the ball was in the hole,” Simons revealed. Mowatt carded a 78 on the day to defeat Mecca one up. Page 2 of 3 - Paupack junior, Corbin Babyak lost his first match of the season to the day's medal winner; Abington's Sasha Ghandragiri, who stroked a 71 to defeat Babyak by a score of 4-3. “ Corbin got off to a bit of a slow start but he made some crucial shots that helped us split a better ball match,” Simons commented. Cris Leonardi also suffered a loss in his individual match, falling to Comets' senior, Luke Fayocavitz five three. Freshman Alex Pillar remained undefeated with a 74 as he defeated the Comet's, Trow Kelleher by a score of four and three. Kyle Pillar also recorded a win, as he completed the tricky course at Elmhurst in 75 strokes to defeat Abington's Sam MacGregor up three strokes with two holes left to play. Rounding out the top six was Paupack's steady sophomore, Nate Trout who shot a 79 in his five to three victory over Abington's Andrew Jalowicz. “ Trout has been something of an unsung hero for us all season,” Simons said. “ He is usually in the middle of the group so he gets lost in the mix, but he has been very good and very consistent for us all season.” Better Ball In better ball play, the Buckhorn tandem of Kyle Pillar and Chris Leonardi lost one-up to Abington's two-man team of Fayocavitz/Macregor. Paupack responded by posting a point in a showdown between the pairing of Alex Pillar and Nate Trout and the Comet combo of Jalowiicz/Kelleher, also by a score of one up. Mowatt and Babyak, split their match with Abington's Chandragiri and Mecca ½–½ to complete Paupack's championship triumph. Page 3 of 3 - Babyak made several key pars in the middle of her round to aid in the victory, while Mowatt sunk a 10-footer on hole #18 to ice the better ball round, and the match in favor of the Buckhorns. “ We got behind, but we maintained our patience and composure, and kept playing golf, and eventually we came back and hung on for dear life,” Simons revealed. “ It was a great win though, and we played pretty well considering the difficulty of the course.” 'Pack Leaders The Buckhorns next match, the District Two Championship, will come against Wyoming Valley League champions, Crestwood. That match is scheduled for 9 a.m. Friday, October 9 at Fox Hill Country Club in Exeter.
