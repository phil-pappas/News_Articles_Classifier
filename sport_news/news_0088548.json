This year, it’s two to one. That’s bad enough. Then, early last year, Mercedes added the CLA to its line-up. Similar in size but engineered more cheaply than the C, it put the 3 ­Series in a vice.\nAnd other contenders look threatening. The new-generation Audi A4, due early next year, is a big advance on the current model, while Jaguar’s XE wants to be the driver’s choice in the segment. To achieve this, Jaguar poached BMW’s best engineers.\nDesign: When a company describes its design changes as “subtle”, then ordinary people will use the word “undetectable”. For this upgrade, exterior differences come down to LED technology beneath the headlamps and tail-lamps; sheet metal has been untouched. It’s a handsome enough design — “classic”, according to the company — although it lacks the modern air of the upcoming Audi A4 or the show-off quality of the Mercedes. BMW has become the conservative option in the segment.\nCabin: Inside it’s a similar story, with fresh materials to raise the tone but structures unchanged. BMW says the ergonomics have improved although it’s hard to see where. The 3’s chief ergonomic sin remains its door handles, which are poorly positioned to make closing them easy. Ugly, too. Elsewhere it’s functional, if a bit dated and lacking in imagination. Happily, BMW’s iDrive control system is still among the best while the driver essentials of wheel, dials and seats are as good as ever. It remains competitive in terms of interior space and cargo capacity.\nDrivelines: If styling changes are modest, then you can be sure there are substantial differences elsewhere. So it is. The 3 Series gets the honour of rolling out BMW’s new family of modular engines, based around cylinders each displacing 500cc.\nAll employ turbocharging and, as usual, inline four and six-cylinder petrol units form the core of the line-up. It has been trimmed, though, with just one diesel four-cylinder and the wagon available only with four-cylinder petrols.\nThere’s also something new. BMW is gambling that the market is ready for the 3’s first three-­cylinder. Borrowed from its i8 ­hybrid supercar, although without electric boost, this 1.5-litre petrol develops 100kW and consumes just 5.4 litres per 100km.\nTo ease its acceptance it adopts the familiar 318i badge. It reaches showrooms next month and was unavailable at the NSW launch. Also undriven were the 320i and 320d, which deliver modest power and efficiency gains compared with their outgoing equivalents.\nThat’s also true of the 330i, which replaces the buyer favourite 328i. It’s likely to be the pick of the bunch again with excellent power delivery, less evidence of turbo lag than some rivals and a worthwhile half-a-litre-per-100km efficiency improvement.\nThe new six-cylinder is the ­aspirational gem. Maximum torque of 450Nm — a substantial increase over the previous six — arrives at just 1380rpm. It’s responsive, quick — 5.1 seconds to 100km/h — and unrelenting. All it lacks is the metallic howl of BMW’s former non-turbo sixes. All 3s get BMW’s excellent eight-speed transmission with gearshift paddles on 320i and above.\nDynamics: BMW led the way on dynamics in this segment until it made the ­mistake of going a little mainstream with this generation. Unless buyers paid for adaptive suspension, something was missing in its composure and ability. For this upgrade adaptive suspension becomes standard, except on the 318i.\nThe 330i and 340i test cars felt like a 3 Series should — compliant and well-sorted, with satisfying ­responses to being chucked into corners. It has been made for people who like driving. Wagons are a $3400 premium over the sedan and hard to pick from behind the wheel unless you’re gunning it.\nBMW has been committed to run-flat tyres for years and they invariably compromise ride quality. Perhaps the adaptive suspension compensates; on smoothish country tarmac ride comfort was good.\nSafety and equipment: Late last year BMW sweetened the 3 Series deal with extra kit, ­including head-up display and surround view, a sort of bird’s-eye parking assistant. They’re in the entry-level 318i although, as ­mentioned, it lacks the crucial adaptive suspension and other kit, such as a digital radio and power seat adjustment. All models get new LED headlights, a reversing camera and Connected Drive, which is a suite of BMW online services. Real leather upholstery — rather than synthetic — arrives with the 330i at $69,900 or it’s an option for about $2000. The top-spec 340i gets a built-in SIM card for internet connection and 24/7 on-call concierge. It also gets active cruise control, auto-parking, intelligent headlights, premium audio and more.\nConclusion: For interior and cargo space the 3 Series is, and remains, competitive with the C-Class and better than the Jaguar XE, though all will be shaded by the Audi A4 next year. However, unless you’re a fan of BMW functionalism, in luxury terms it’s now one of the dowdier choices. The drivelines are a highlight, although the 318i will be an interesting test of acceptance. It raises the entry price for the range by $1100.\nIn other words, you used to get a four-cylinder for less money — and still can from rivals. It also misses vital equipment and the price of its economy is tardy acceleration to 100km/h of 9.1 seconds. With the suspension upgrade on other models, they are now a great drive straight out of the box. The 340i in particular offers compelling performance and benefits. Along with its added equipment it looks like the sweet spot. The 3 Series is now a better car and better deal. However, many buyers have moved on. Whether is has done enough to win them back is another matter.\nBMW 3 Series: Mid-size luxury sedan and wagon\nEngines: 1.5-litre turbocharged three-cylinder petrol (318i: 100kW/220Nm)\n2.0-litre turbocharged four-cylinder petrol (320i: 135kW/270Nm; 330i: 185kW/350Nm)\n2.0-litre turbocharged four-cylinder diesel (320d: 140kW/400Nm)\n3.0-litre turbocharged six-cylinder petrol (340i: 240kW/450Nm)\nTransmission: Eight-speed automatic, rear-wheel drive\nAverage fuel consumption: From 4.4l/100km (320d) to 6.8l/100km (340i)\nPrice: From $54,900 (318i) to $89,900 (340i), excludes on-road costs\nOn sale: Now\nRating: 3.5 out of 5", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T08:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T13:06:40.511+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
