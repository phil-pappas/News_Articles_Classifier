Kardashian and Odom were married in 2009, but Kardashian filed for divorce in 2013, citing irreconcilable differences. \nOdom was found unconscious Tuesday afternoon at the Love Ranch brothel in Crystal, Nevada, about 70 miles outside of Las Vegas. \nAuthorities said the 35-year-old was stabilized at the scene before being taken to a hospital. He was then transferred to Sunrise Hospital and Medical Center in Las Vegas. \nOwner Dennis Hof said Odom had been at his brothel since Saturday. \n___ \nBy Associated Press writer Sally Ho.
