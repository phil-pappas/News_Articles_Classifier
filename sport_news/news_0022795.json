Both are due in Dorchester District Court Tuesday, although not much activity is expected because they haven't yet been indicted.\nThe girl's body was found on Deer Island in June. State authorities launched a massive investigation to find out who she was and how she died. Police finally got a tip three months later after Bond told a friend that McCarthy had killed Bella.\nMcCarthy's lawyer has said he knew nothing about Bella's death.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
