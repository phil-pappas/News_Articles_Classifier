My little sister is very hard to impress so we didn't really care about anybody that was at the Cannes Film Festival but I wanted to spend some time with her,\" Cosmpolitan magazine quoted Rousey as saying. \n\"Justin Bieber was taking some pictures with some ladies and she suddenly got really excited and was like, 'Do you think he'd want to take a picture with me?' I was like, 'Sure Julie, don't worry about it, everyone's taking pictures today. Don't feel bad, that's why everybody's here... look at him, he's a sweetheart,\" she added. \nHowever, Rousey said the pop star snubbed her little siter, as he had \"already taken a billion pictures\" that day. \n\"I walked over there and said, 'Excuse me,' he turned and goes, 'I've already taken a billion pictures today, OK.' I said, 'Yeah but' -- because my sister is the only 16-year-old girl at the whole party -- I only got, 'Yeah but' out before he goes, 'A billion' and walks off and totally snubs my little sister,\" the 28-year-old said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T13:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T14:14:06.743+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
