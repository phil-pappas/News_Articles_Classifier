That time hurt him. Hurt his heart. Hurt him emotionally. Tonight, he went out there and proved who Matt Harvey is.\n“Whoever doubted him, needed to take notice tonight. He went out there and showed what he was about.’’\nHarvey certainly has had some fabulous games in his career, but on this night, he has never been better. He toyed with the Cubs all evening, giving up just four hits and striking out nine in 7 2/3 innings, throwing virtually every pitch with perfection.\nWhen he walked off the mound for the final time, the sellout crowd of 44,287, the largest in Citi Field history, gave him a standing ovation, chanting his name.\n“I wanted to go out there,’’ Harvey said. “I wanted this game bad. I know there's been a lot of speculation or talks going around the past month, but I kind of wanted to kind of stop all that.\n“I think after everything that's happened, I think the biggest thing was really staying focused on what I had to do tonight.’’\nThe Cubs were overwhelmed all evening, swinging and missing on 42% of their swings against Harvey, the second-most in a start this entire season.\n“He had about as good of command as you possibly can of all his pitches,’’ Cubs manager Joe Maddon said. “His stuff is always good, but the command was outrageous tonight.\"\nThe Cubs knew it would be a rough night almost the moment Harvey stepped onto the mound. He stuck out the first batter he faced, Dexter Fowler, on an 87-mph changeup, the second batter, Kyle Schwarber, on an 85-mph curveball. It wasn’t until the fifth inning when the Cubs had their first baserunner.\nCubs power hitter Jorge Soler was left shaking his head after the game. He never hit the ball out of the infield. In his first at-bat, he took a 90-mph changeup for strike 1. He looked at an 84-mph curveball for strike 2. And swung away and missed at a 96-mph fastball for strike 3.\n“I could tell by the first pitch I caught,’’ said Mets catcher Travis d’Arnaud, “that it was going to be a fun night.’’\nIt was that kind of night for the Cubs, and that kind of indelible image Harvey left with crowd, reminding everyone of his talent and toughness.\n“He was good,’’ Cubs first baseman Anthony Rizzo said. “He was throwing everything early for strikes. It’s not like he was just trying to establish his fastball in the first inning. It was changeup, curveball, slider.\n“That’s what separates him. He can throw those pitches, and they’re good pitches. Some guys are just throwers and they’re going to leave stuff over the plate, but he knows how to hit his spots.\"\nHarvey has now reached 201 innings now - 16 more than his surgeon recommended he pitch this year in his first year back after Tommy John surgery - but he’s made it clear to his teammates that he’s not about to stop now.\n“There was never any doubt in my mind that if we needed him in Game 1 of the championship series,’’ Mets captain David Wright said, “he’d be out there. There have been a couple of speed bumps here and there, but they [fans] understand the competitor, and understand how badly he wants to go out there and succeed for the city.\n“He lives in New York, he enjoys the spotlight, he enjoys the big stage. You saw that tonight. He’s the type of guy when you get the nationally televised game, a Saturday night in New York, and when you get to that type of stage, his expectations go up.\n“His mind-set is that he wants to go out there and show off a little bit.’’\nAnd, oh, did he ever.\nHarvey’s control was impeccable. He didn’t go to a two-ball count until the eighth batter of the game, David Ross. It wasn’t until he faced Fowler in the fourth inning that he reached a three-ball count. He didn’t issue an unintentional walk until the seventh.\nThe Cubs couldn’t even knock him out of the game when Fowler hit a line drive off his right biceps in the sixth inning. The Mets’ training staff and pitching coach Dan Warthen rushed to the mound, only for Harvey to wave them back to the dugout.\nStay away.\nHe’s got this.\n“Anyone that had any doubts about his toughness or desire to go out there and pitch,’’ Cuddyer said, “should take notice tonight. The guy is a beast. He’s an animal. He went out there and proved it. He had that look in his eyes that he was going to dominate.’’\nHarvey, who threw 97 pitches, including 65 for strikes, saved his greatest brilliance when he needed it the most in the seventh inning. Rizzo walked, and was nearly doubled off when Starlin Castro hit a liner to second baseman Daniel Murphy, only to get back safely when his throw hit Rizzo’s left wrist. Soler then hit a soft grounder up the middle that was deflected by Harvey, but too slow for shortstop Wilmer Flores to make a play.\nMets manager Terry Collins had his bullpen working, and Warthen advising, as the Mets’ 2-1 lead was in jeopardy.\nSo what does Harvey do?\nHe strikes out Javier Baez on three pitches, with fastballs clocked at 95, 96 and 96.\nNext up, pinch-hitter Tommy La Stella: He throws two 95-mph fastballs for strikes, an 89-mph slider and 84-mph curveball for balls, and strikes him out chasing an 88-mph changeup.\n“They both have great power, and could have taken him deep right there,’’ d'Arnaud said, “and he just went out there and executed pitches. That was huge.’’\nHarvey pumped his right fist into the air, screamed into the night, and was greeted with high-fives by everyone on the bench.\nCollins, mesmerized himself by Harvey’s performance, or scared to death by his bullpen, even let him go back out in the eighth. Harvey quickly retired the first two batters but Schwarber brought him back to reality, hitting a moon shot over the right-center-field fence.\nThat ended Harvey’s night, but as he walked off the mound, the crowd stood and wildly cheered him, letting him know that he’s loved again.\n“I try not to get too involved in some of that stuff because it's really nothing I can control,’’ Collins said. “But I talk to this guy every day. I know exactly what he's made of. I know exactly what he's about, and he wants the baseball. He wants it.\n“If it comes down to a Game 7, he'll want it, believe me. That is not just a mask that he's putting out. This kid likes to compete.\n“Tonight, when I went to him between innings I said, \"How you doing?\" He said, “I'm going back out.’ ’’\nWho was Collins to stop him?\nReally, who’s anyone to stop him now?\nFollow Nightengale on Twitter: @Bnightengale\nNLCS: Cubs vs. Mets\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAfz63Q.img&quot;}},{&quot;csId&quot;:&quot;BB2D59E&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;Fueled", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAfq1df.img&quot;}},{&quot;csId&quot;:&quot;BB2D59E&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;The", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BB6qRzt.img&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Cubs", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BB6qRzt.img&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Montero", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BB6qRzt.img&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Turning", "http://ui.bamstatic.com/120sports/util/embed/ots.embed.js&quot;}", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/b?&quot;,&quot;Category&quot;:&quot;baseball_mlb&quot;},&quot;Mute&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;HomePageLink&quot;:&quot;//www.msn.com/en-us&quot;,&quot;GeofenceUseSps&quot;:&quot;false&quot;,&quot;GeofenceEnabled&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;AutoPlay&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;AutoPlay&quot;:true,&quot;Mute&quot;:true,&quot;SwfCacheRefreshTime&quot;:86400,&quot;AdConfig&quot;:{&quot;FWFlashProfile&quot;:&quot;188286:MSN_US_AS3_LIVE&quot;,&quot;FWHtml5Profile&quot;:&quot;188286:MSN_HTML5_Live&", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "http://www.usatoday.com/sports/", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAfz5EX.img&quot;}}", "http://c.120sportsstatic.com/gen/client/rss/timeline.xml&quot;},{&quot;ns&quot;:&quot;ignore_this_version&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;System.Collections.Generic.List`1", "https://twitter.com/BNightengale", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAfzsWC.img&quot;}}", "http://ui.bamstatic.com/120sports/util/embed/ots.embed.js&quot;,&quot;tags&quot;:", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BB6qRzt.img&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Highlights:"], "published": "2015-10-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T19:50:44.210+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
