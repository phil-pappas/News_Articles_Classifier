Second baseman Daniel Murphy flipped to shortstop Ruben Tejada, who was taken out by Utley on what seemed like more of a tackle than slide at second.\nNot only did the Dodgers tie the game on the play, but Utley was ruled safe at second after umpires decided Tejada did not touch the bag when he caught the ball. Tejada left the game and was replaced by Wilmer Flores after Utley's slide. X-rays revealed that Tejada suffered a broken fibula on the play that will keep him out the remainder of the season.\nThe Dodgers opened up the game with three more runs and hung on to win 5-2 to tie the series at 1-1.\nSaturday's affairs may be familiar for NL East fans. Five years ago, Utley, then with the Phillies, caused a controversy with another takeout slide on Tejada.\n\"Chase, he plays the game hard. He plays the game passionately. But there's a thin line between going out there and playing the game hard and going out there trying to get somebody hurt,\" Mets third baseman David Wright said at the time . \"That's a thin line. Nobody is going to push us around. We're going to have our teammate's back. I think cooler heads prevailed, but we've got to let them know that over on our side we didn't appreciate it and that we're going to go out there and have our teammates' backs.\"\nThe Mets will probably be looking for revenge on Utley. The only problem is the veteran is a bench player for the Dodgers and New York might not get a chance at payback.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.yardbarker.com/", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAfe5tL.img&quot;}}", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAf8Vzg.img&quot;}},{&quot;csId&quot;:&quot;BB2D59E&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;Was", "http://espn.go.com/blog/newyork/mets/post/_/id/10764/utleys-slide-into-tejada-irks-mets", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BB6qRzt.img&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Who", "http://m.mlb.com/news/article/154020072/mets-ruben-tejada-injured-on-chase-utley-slide", "http://ui.bamstatic.com/120sports/util/embed/ots.embed.js&quot;}", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/b?&quot;,&quot;Category&quot;:&quot;baseball_mlb&quot;},&quot;Mute&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;HomePageLink&quot;:&quot;//www.msn.com/en-us&quot;,&quot;GeofenceUseSps&quot;:&quot;false&quot;,&quot;GeofenceEnabled&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;AutoPlay&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;AutoPlay&quot;:true,&quot;Mute&quot;:true,&quot;SwfCacheRefreshTime&quot;:86400,&quot;AdConfig&quot;:{&quot;FWFlashProfile&quot;:&quot;188286:MSN_US_AS3_LIVE&quot;,&quot;FWHtml5Profile&quot;:&quot;188286:MSN_HTML5_Live&", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAfinSO.img&quot;}},{&quot;csId&quot;:&quot;BB2D59E&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;Danny", "http://c.120sportsstatic.com/gen/client/rss/timeline.xml&quot;},{&quot;ns&quot;:&quot;ignore_this_version&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;System.Collections.Generic.List`1", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BB6qRzt.img&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Utley&#39;s", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BB6qRzt.img&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Bad", "http://ui.bamstatic.com/120sports/util/embed/ots.embed.js&quot;,&quot;tags&quot;:", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAfkkNe.img&quot;}}", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BB6qRzt.img&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Will"], "published": "2015-10-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T11:53:00.851+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
