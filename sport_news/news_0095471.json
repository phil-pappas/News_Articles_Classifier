I would entertain it.\n\"I'm at a different place in my life right now, working out, training, coaching from afar, helping guys out, high school, college and pro alike. I definitely would entertain it.\"\nReed said several former players have a group chat to discuss the future of the Miami program, and that he has discussed the issue with former Miami quarterback and current Carolina Panthers assistant Ken Dorsey.\n\"Only person [from the Miami family tree] I've talked to was Ken Dorsey,\" Reed told Eisen. \"Me and Dorsey have talked a great bit about coaching together, but neither one of us want to be the head coach. We argued that. I know other guys would chime in and definitely want to be a part of it in some way, help out.\n\"I know guys got a group chat together, trying to figure out how we can have input helping make a good decision, a football decision, for the school and for the players.\"\nOne thing is for sure: If Ed Reed were to take any position with Miami, he should have no trouble motivating the locker room.\n\nEd Reed would 'listen' to Miami if they call.
