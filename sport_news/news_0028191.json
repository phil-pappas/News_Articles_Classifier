He deserved to show his stuff (Sunday). He's made great strides and will bounce back from this.\" \nWillis has appeared in 33 games during his career, including 19 in his sophomore season. The 6-foot-9 forward is expected to add depth this season to a front line that lost Karl-Anthony Towns, Willie Cauley-Stein, Trey Lyles and Dakari Johnson to the NBA Draft. \nUK lost junior guard Dominique Hawkins earlier in the week with a broken right hand. He underwent successful surgery last Tuesday and is expected back in approximately four weeks.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T02:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T03:05:29.296+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
