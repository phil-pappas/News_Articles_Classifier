Buy this photo Zach Gewelb/Staff Photographer Senior captain Paige Weisel prepares to serve the ball during Cedar Grove's two-set victory over Christ the King in the opening round of the Essex County Tournament Monday, Oct. 19. \n\"I think our preparation for the game was great,\" senior outside hitter Kailey Weinstein said. \"We practiced really hard and we're really excited for what's next.\" \nThe Lady Panthers started the first game a bit slow and held a tight 8-5 lead through the first 13 points. Cedar Grove went on a 17-6 run to secure the game. \n\"It was just a matter of getting things going,\" senior libero Nikki Vassallo said. \"We realized this is not a game where we could make errors.\" \nHead coach Alicia Angione said the team was confident before the match and believed her players used the confidence as motivation to play a clean game and succeed. \n\"They were passing well and they wanted to win, which I think helped them,\" Angione said. \"They worked hard to make fewer errors.\" \nWith the game's momentum in hand, Cedar Grove played a strong second set and went on two separate runs to take care of business. The Lady Panthers began the game with more energy, which led to an 8-2 run. \n\"We picked up our intensity,\" Angione said. \"We always start a little low and a bit slow. But by the second game, we always pick up our intensity.\" \nCedar Grove, led by Weinstein and fellow senior Paige Weisel, served the ball well in the second set and registered a combined 23 service points throughout the match. Weisel was productive in the passing game as well, as the captain tallied seven assists and helped set up the hitters for easy points. \n\"Paige's service points were excellent. Those were huge in both games,\" Angione said. \"All of our passers did a great job in the back. When it came to hitting, Paige and Brooke [Slattery] and Makenna [Boutmy] did well and our setters did well, too. I can say something good about everybody today.\" \nWith the victory, the Lady Panthers will advance to the second round of the Essex County Tournament when they take on Golda Och Saturday, Oct. 24 at Cedar Grove High School. Vassallo said there is no doubt in her mind that the Lady Panthers will continue to advance. \n\"Definitely. We're undefeated in conference play and it's staying like that,\" Vassallo said. \nBefore Cedar Grove prepares for their second round showdown, Weisel said the team will enjoy their success. \n\"It feels great. Hopefully we could keep it going and make a good run,\" Weisel said. \nThe Lady Panthers have now advanced the furthest in program history. While the season is not over, the three senior captains realize their time with the program is coming to an end. However, they could not be happier with the current state of Cedar Grove volleyball. \n\"It's a great way for us to end our senior year, to be able to say this is the farthest we have ever gone,\" Vassallo said. \"We raised the bar for next year and I feel we are giving them something to reach for.\" \nAngione said the sky is the limit for this year's team and believes the best has yet to come for the Lady Panthers. \n\"We're excited and we're having fun,\" Angione said. \"I always tell them to be consistent and have fun before every game and I think we've done that. I'm excited to see where this year can take us.\" \nEmail: gewelb@northjersey.com  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T16:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T02:15:22.333+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
