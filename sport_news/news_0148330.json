Quarterback Jordan Young is averaging 208.3 yards of total offense per game. Young has scored ten total touchdowns. Jordan's brother, freshman Avery Young, leads the team in rushing. A. Young has carried the ball 42 times for 307 yards and has scored five touchdowns on the ground. Jadan Hudson leads all of the Red Raiders wide receivers with 11 catches for 237 yards and one touchdown reception. \nDowningtown West - After turning back a game Neshaminy team 20-14 in week two, the Whippets have cruised in their last two games. The Whippets have averaged 51.5 in their last two wins over Mifflin County and Kennett. Junior running back Michael Riddick has ran the ball 27 times for 301 yards and four touchdowns on the ground. Senior running back Jake Barr has been a beast catching the football having caught 10 passes for 214 yards and three touchdowns. Quarterback Thomas Mattioni has been lights out thus far this season. Mattioni has completed 23 out of 33 passes for 563 yards and eight touchdowns. Braden Harper (leads the team in sacks and tackles), Wayne Anderson, Zach Siever, and Michael Celommi all help pace the Whippets on defense. \n\nKeys to the Game \nFor Coatesville: This will be the best team that they've seen all year, especially from an offensive standpoint. Downingtown West has been very balanced offensively through the first four games. Riddick has emerged as the top running option, but don't sleep on Jake Barr. Mattioni has been very accurate passing the ball so the Red Raiders won't be able to stack the box to stop the running game. On offense, expect Jordan Young to step it up another notch against a top-level opponent. It will also be a chance to see how freshman running back Avery Young performs in a \"big-time\" game in his young career. \n\nFor Downingtown West: Their balance makes them one of the more dangerous teams in District 1. The Whippets are hard to defend because they are producing great numbers in the running and passing game. Downingtown West will look to keep Coatesville off-balance and putting the ball in the hands of their big playmakers: Jake Barr and Michael Riddick. Defensively, it all starts with defending Coatesville quarterback Jordan Young. It's a tough task because Young is effective both throwing and running with the football. They'll want to atone for last year's loss in which they gave up 47 points to Coatesville.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T05:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T08:28:50.206+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
