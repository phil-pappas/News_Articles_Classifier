The rookie completed 21 of his 37 pass attempts for 259 yards in Cleveland after having a 13-16, 209 yard, four touchdown performance NFL debut a week prior in Tampa Bay.\nManziel has \"exhibited similar weaknesses\" writes Benoit, \"But to his credit, while he still has a long way to go, it's clear that he's also come a long way since his disastrous rookie season.\" In his first season in the NFL, the 2012 Heisman Trophy winner completed 18 of 35 passes for 175 yards and two interceptions over five games (two starts).\nAfter Sunday's win, the stat line for Manziel in 2015 stands at 21-39 for 354 yards, three touchdowns and an interception. \"Over the first two games of 2015,\" writes Benoit, \"he has done a decent job identifying and reacting to blitzes. He has been relatively sharp in the quick-timing passing game. And...he's been proficient on called deep shots.\"\nHowever, Benoit notes Manziel has \"physical limitations to consider\" including arm strength and a \"6-foot, 207-pound body that's not naturally strong.\" Even larger of an issue is Manziel's size. Benoit writes the Browns' QB \"literally can't see downfield from the pocket.\"\nBenoit counters the usual arguments referencing the smaller quarterbacks such as Drew Brees and Russell Wilson by saying Manziel \"plays low to the ground..instead of up on his toes\" like the Saints QB and calls Wilson an \"anomaly\" who possesses skills that Johnny \"at least going off the early samplings of his young career, does not.\"\n\"At best,\" writes Benoit, \"Manziel is bound to be an inconsistent pro quarterback, his game defined by highs and lows. Sunday's win -- the first of his career -- was one of the highs.\"\nTo read the full article, click here\nOn Twitter:\n @BrandonWheeland", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/BrandonWheeland", "http://mmqb.si.com/mmqb/2015/09/21/johnny-manziel-first-win-size-marcus-mariota-titans-browns-nfl-week-2"], "published": "2015-09-22T01:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T05:47:24.582+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
