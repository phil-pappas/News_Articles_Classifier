There’s a reason why they’re ranked. There’s a reason why they have a culture there that’s a championship culture. We’re looking forward to the challenge.” \nEmporia State enters 5-0 after remaining perfect with a 20-13 win over Lindenwood last week. \nPittsburg State ranks third in the conference in total offense at 452.4 yards per game and is sixth in total defense, allowing 393.6 yards a game. \nPSU freshman quarterback John Roderique is leading the MIAA in rushing touchdowns with seven. Gorillas defensive back Darnell Walker has a league-high five interceptions. \n“I would say the biggest thing for us is to make sure we take care of the ball and don’t let the pressure get to you,” ESU receiver Mitchell Foote said. “That’s a powerhouse team coming in here to your stadium. Being 5-0 doesn’t mean anything, so you can’t let that get to you.” \nESU quarterback Brent Wilson agreed. \n“Pitt State is arguably one of the greatest football powerhouses in the nation year in and year out, but it’s a typical game for us,” he said. “We’re not going to change anything special or do anything that we’re not capable of doing. \n“We just have to stay together and not let the emotions get the best of us.” MIAA GAMES SATURDAY \nCentral Missouri at Washburn, 2:37 p.m. \nPittsburg State at Emporia, 2 p.m. \nFort Hays State at Missouri Western, 1 p.m. \nLindenwood at Northwest Missouri, 1 p.m. \nNortheastern State at Nebraska-Kearney, 2 p.m. \nCentral Oklahoma at Missouri Southern, 6 p.m. \nRick Jr. Peterson can be reached at (785) 295-1290 or rick.peterson.jr@cjonline.com .Follow Rick Jr. on Twitter @RickiePeterson .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T23:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T03:57:58.663+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
