The Indians had few issues, recording their third shutout of the season. Special photo by John Silas slideshow POWDER SPRINGS — McEachern got big plays from its offense, defense and special teams to pull away and beat Region 4 rival Kennesaw Mountain 35-0 on Friday at Walter Cantrell Stadium.The Indians (7-1, 4-0) scored on a 50-yard touchdown run by Sam Jackson in the first quarter, a 25-yard interception return by Bryan Okeh in the second quarter, a 69-yard kickoff return by Tyler Simmons in the third quarter and a 40-yard pass from Bailey Hockman to Christian Roberson in the final period to take the win and maintain their spot atop the region standings.“The kids did a nice job,” McEachern coach Kyle Hockman said. “Kennesaw Mountain played very hard, so you have to give them a lot of credit. They have a lot of players that played well. We wanted to play a lot of players, and we accomplished that.”Jackson rushed for 146 yards on only eight carries — including his 50-yard scoring run — to lead a McEachern offense that accumulated 390 total yards.But it was defense where the Indians shined, holding Kennesaw Mountain (2-6, 0-4) to only 61 yards of offense and recording its third shutout of the season.“They’re a very good team,” Kennesaw Mountain coach Andy Scott said. “That’s the first time that we’ve been shut out in my four years of coaching here. Their defense is one of the best in the state.”McEachern drove the ball to the Kennesaw Mountain 3-yard line on the first offensive series of the game, but the drive came up short when Bailey Hockman threw an interception with 6:42 remaining in the first quarter.However, Kennesaw Mountain went three-and-out on the next series and was forced to punt the ball, with McEachern returning it to the 50.That set up Jackson’s 50-yard touchdown run, with the senior running back sprinting down the middle of the field untouched to the end zone to give the Indians a 7-0 lead with 5:05 remaining in the first quarter.It was the defense that provided McEachern with its next score as Okeh intercepted a Jarrett Guest pass and ran it back 25 yards for the score to make it 14-0 with 9:08 left in the first half.After McEachern forced Kennesaw Mountain to punt on the first offensive series of the second half, Simmons returned the punt 69 yards for the score, increasing the Indians’ advantage to 21-0 with 9:40 remaining in the third quarter.A 2-yard touchdown run by Simmons with 5:45 left in the third quarter gave McEachern a 28-0 lead, and Hockman’s 40-yard scoring pass to Roberson at the 9:35 left in the game made it 35-0.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T10:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T16:31:48.723+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
