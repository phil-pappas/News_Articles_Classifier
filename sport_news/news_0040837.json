The question he had for the first eight games of the season was if his team could prevent goals from scoring against them. He has liked the answers he has seen in the past two games. Portsmouth scored three goals in each half and blanked Milford, 6-0 on Wednesday in a Division II boys game at Daubney Field. It was the second straight win for the Clippers, as well as the second straight shutout. Portsmouth is now 3-7 on the season, while Milford fell to 1-10. “We’re playing alright right now,” Paterson said. “We’re getting the results first and foremost. We’re finishing chances we’re creating. We know we can score, we just have to defend. The highlight the past two games has been the back.” Wiley Hundertmark needed just five saves for the shutout, getting help in front of him from Eddie Carroll. “Eddie was certainly the highlight back there for us today,” Paterson said. Junior Jack Leger scored the first two goals of the game for Portsmouth, while Ryan Gonzales’ goal late in the half gave the Clippers a 3-0 lead at intermission. Sophomore Jack Finneral added two goals in the second half, while Keyton Chapman also scored. Matteo Baldasare had two assists. The Clippers, with six games left in the regular season, will be at Trinity on Friday. GIRLS SOCCER Portsmouth 1 Milford 0 MILFORD — Carleigh Leyman scored the game’s only goal midway through the first half of this Division II contest. Izzy Hayes had eight saves as Portsmouth earned its second straight shutout and fourth overall on the season. “It was a good win on the road for us,” Portsmouth coach Cyd Scarano said. “Milford is a good team even though its record doesn’t show it. They’ve played some hard teams.” Shanley King had the assist on Leyman’s goal. Julia Luff, Maddy Bachmann, Emily Durant and Riley Nadeau all played well for Portsmouth (7-4-1). “Milford played us hard,” Scarano said. “They always play hard. They play this high back line and constantly try to get you offside and it’s hard to solve it.” Pinkerton 2 Winnacunnet 1 (OT) HAMPTON — Pinkerton survived an upset bid when Julia Bousquet forced a defensive turnover and scored into an open net in the second 10-minute segment of overtime. Winnacunnet (4-5-3) took a 1-0 lead on a Callan Kennedy penalty kick in the 66th minute. Pinkerton (12-0) tied the game 3 minutes later on a Keara Doolan goal.
