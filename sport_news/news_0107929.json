Down 2-0 early in the third period, Howden swept in a pass from Brickley and hoisted it over Penguins goalie Marc-Andre Fleury to cut the deficit in half at 11:04.\nJust 2:53 later, from behind Pittsburgh's net Brickley set up MacKenzie in the slot for a one-timer.\nThe trio is supposed to supply energy, pesky defense, physical play and the rare dirty goal.\nNot so fast.\n\"We've all scored before. We've scored in every league, so we can play,'' said Howden, who scored his first goal to go with an assist Tuesday. \"We also know our role and what we got to do to bring energy for the guys. When we can contribute it's good for us.''\nHowden, 23, who is considered one of the fastest skaters in the league, was a dominant scorer in the WHL, potting 70 goals in his final two seasons for the Moose Jaw Warriors.\nBrickley, 23, a long shot to make the team out of training camp, showed the Panthers brain trust that he was more than a forechecking dynamo when he scored a goal in each of the three rookie tournament games and then added two more in the preseason.\n\"We have three guys that work hard every shift,'' Brickley said. \"We want to be first on pucks in the offensive zone and cause some chaos, and as you saw, get some rebound chances. As a group we want to come out and play a full 60 minutes, play our game, get over pucks in the offensive zone and be hard to play against.''\nIn Brickley's first full season in professional hockey, he notched 22 goals and 25 assists in 73 games for the San Antonio Rampage, the Panthers' AHL affiliate last season.\nMacKenzie, the greybeard of the line at 33, has never scored more than nine goals in any of his 12 NHL seasons, but he's considered the Panthers' top penalty killer and faceoff practitioner. Like the 43-year-old Jagr has been admittedly rejuvenated by his youthful linemates, MacKenzie, too, seems to be playing with more pep in his step.\nMacKenzie leads the team with a plus-4 ice rating, and that doesn't include being on the ice for goals for or against during special teams. Howden and Brickley are right behind at plus-3. MacKenzie is tied with Nick Bjugstad for the team lead among forwards in hits with 14, and Brickley has 13.\nMacKenzie has won 55.7 percent of his faceoffs (39-31), which ranks first on the team among any player who has participated in more than 12 faceoffs.\n\"I got a couple of wingers who are on the same page,'' MacKenzie said. \"[Brickley and Howden] have gone a great job getting involved on all the faceoffs and forechecks. When you get help like that you seem to win more faceoffs for sure.''\nPanthers coach Gerard Gallant believes he has four lines that could generate offense, but he's also a firm believer that in today's game most goals are coming from the paint or around the net on rebounds, tip-ins and deflections off bodies.\n\"It's not those cute fancy plays when you're going cross-ice all the time and turn the pucks over,'' he said. \"It's about down low, battling and going to the net. That's what they did to get the two goals.''\nGallant challenges game-winning goal\nOn the rush that Pittsburgh forward Evgeni Malkin scored the game-winning power-play goal in overtime, Gallant felt that Sidney Crosby beat the airborne puck across the line and should've been whistled for offsides.\n\"It was a real close offside,\" Gallant said. \"The puck went really high in the air and it was probably inconclusive. But we had nothing to lose at that point. I think it was an OK goal. … It was a frustrating night for sure.\n\"We didn't quit. That's the real key and I hope that carries over to the next game in Chicago. I want to play a better 60-minute game than we played. I thought we showed a little bit too much respect.'' …\nThe Penguins have defeated the Panthers in 14 of their last 16 games at home, in large part of All-Stars' Crosby and Malkin as well as goalie Marc-Andre Fleury .\nCrosby tied a career high with nine shots on goal or two more than he had in his first five games. He also scored his first goal of the season and notched his first points (3) along with the team's first power-play goal.\nMalkin has 32 points in 29 games against Florida and Fleury is 10-1-1 in his last 12 starts against the Panthers with a 1.71 goals-against-average.\n Ice Hockey Florida Panthers Derek MacKenzie Quinton Howden Evgeni Malkin Pittsburgh Penguins Sidney Crosby", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-5628041d/turbine/fl-florida-panthers-1022-20151021"], "published": "2015-10-21T21:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T16:11:13.628+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
