He said the fan support the program receives was evident and a factor in his decision. \n“They show a lot of love to the players,” he said. \nThe Cyclones’ work ethic also made an impression on him. \n“I was able to watch practice, and they show a lot of enthusiasm,” Long said. “They’re intense every single day.” \nLong joins prep forward Solomon Young along with junior college players Donovan Jackson and Emmanuel Malou in ISU’s 2016 class, which will be pivotal for Prohm as the roster for this year’s preseason top-10 team rolls over with four senior starters plus a possible NBA decision from junior Monte Morris. \n“(The coaching staff) said I’ll be able to play a lot, probably 20-plus minutes a game,” Long said. “Hopefully I’ll be able to start my freshman year. \n“We’ll be young and inexperienced next year, but I think we’ll be able to continue to win in the Big 12.” \nISU currently has two scholarships remaining for next season.
