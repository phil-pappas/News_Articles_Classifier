Punter Blake O’Neill dropped the snap — nobody was even back to field it for the Spartans — and got swarmed by a mess of defenders. The ball landed in the arms of Spartans safety Jalen Watts-Jackson, who outran Michigan’s pursuing defenders, getting to the corner of the end zone before he was cut off and forced out of bounds. He got in as time expired to crush a Wolverines team that was seconds away from entering the national championship conversation. \nInstead, Michigan State is now 7-0, 3-0 in the Big Ten — somehow, some way — despite never leading Saturday until the final horn. The Spartans have fought injury haven’t been impressive all season but keep finding ways to win. The crazy final play will overshadow a great performance by the Michigan defense, which held Connor Cook to 18-of-39 passing for 328 yards. It also appeared to win the game with 1:47 left, forcing three consecutive incompletions and sacking Cook when the Spartans were on the edge of field goal range. \nMichigan State has won seven of the past eight meetings with the Wolverines, unprecedented in the series. \nMichigan running back De'Veon Smith (4) gains ground in the first half vs. Michigan State.

It was, well, interesting and noticeable at all times — and both sides could have easily left Michigan Stadium game claiming the opposition got some key help from the guys in stripes. \nAll told, there were 13 flags (eight on Michigan) and eight instant replay reviews, some of which were on brutally close calls. \nBut among the most controversial was the targeting penalty assessed to Michigan linebacker Joe Bolden going head-first into Cook after a slide, disqualifying Bolden from the game and setting up Michigan’s first touchdown. Even though the replay booth upheld the call, Bolden appeared to be shoved into Cook, which made the penalty seem questionable. Follow the road to the 2015 College Football Playoff at The Football Four , our home to rate and debate the nation's best. \nTHE DECIDING PLAY: Michigan (5-2, 2-1 Big Ten) is not the kind of team you want to fall two scores behind. Which made it all the more baffling why Spartans coach Mark Dantonio, in a 10-7 game, called a fake punt with 12:01 left in the third quarter on their own side of the field. It’s unclear what the play was supposed to be; it appeared punter Tyler O’Connor was supposed to pass, but he ended up running for the first-down marker. \nO’Connor fell a yard short, giving Michigan — which wasn’t getting much done offensively — a short field at the 38-yard line. The Wolverines cashed in, using safety Jabrill Peppers on offense to break a 28-yard run that set up the touchdown and a 17-7 lead. Michigan beat my statue, but they couldn't beat the MSU Football team!

But with 9:11 left and Michigan State’s season on the line, trailing 23-14, Cook faked two handoffs and found fullback Trevon Pendleton on the wheel route. He was all alone, rumbling 75 yards before being stopped short of the goal-line. It was a nifty and timely playcall with the game slipping away from the Spartans, allowing them to pull within 23-21. \nHOW THE TOP 25 FARED IN WEEK 7", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T04:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T02:49:40.117+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
