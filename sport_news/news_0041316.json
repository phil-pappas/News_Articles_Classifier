(Kathy Willens / Associated Press) Matt Wilhalme \nWhat does one of the world's highest-paid athletes spend his money on? An NFL team, perhaps. \nOklahoma City Thunder forward Kevin Durant said as much during an ESPN fantasy podcast Thursday saying he wanted to own part of his hometown team: the Washington Redskins. \n\"My first priority would be the Washington Redskins, even if it was just a small percentage,\" Durant said. \"I just want to get involved. Growing up five minutes away from the stadium and always being a fan, I have a Redskins tattoo on my forearm. So I feel part of the team so much, so to be an owner and all the way entrenched with the team would be cool.\" \nForbes recently valued the Redskins at more than $2.85 billion, the third-most valuable team in the NFL. Only the Dallas Cowboys ($4 billion) and the New England Patriots ($3.2 billion) are worth more, according to the magazine. \nAn ownership stake in his hometown team wouldn't be cheap; luckily he's a superstar. \nDurant, 27, has made more than $66 million playing for the Seattle SuperSonics and Thunder since 2007, according to Spotrac . What's more, Durant is set to become a free agent next summer when the NBA's salary cap is expected to rise from $70 million to somewhere around $90 million, which means Durant could end up with a $200-million deal.

The 2014 NBA most valuable player missed 55 games last year, and the Thunder missed the playoffs for the first time since the 2009-10 season. \nThere's also Durant's 10-year shoe deal with Nike that could end up being worth more than $300 million. His previous deal with the swoosh was worth $60 million. \nFollow Matt Wilhalme on Twitter @mattwilhalme", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T22:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T23:18:55.224+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
