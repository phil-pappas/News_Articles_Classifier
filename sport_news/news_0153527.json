The senior midfielder believes this year’s team is better than last year. “I definitely think we can win it again,” Cheever said after Wednesday’s 5-1 win over Merrimack. “This is the best team I’ve been on, I have no doubt we have the potential to win it again. I feel like we connect well and we just have an amazing group of girls who have the right drive and attitude.” Cheever, who said her favorite memory on her home field was scoring her first varsity goal as a sophomore, was one of nine Winnacunnet seniors to be honored before Wednesday’s game. “It feels like yesterday that I was watching the seniors last year on Senior Day saying ‘wow, that’s going to be me next year,’ and now it’s here.” Other seniors who were recognized on Wednesday included defensemen Claudia Segal, Drucilla Sargent, forwards Holly Miranda, Maddie Anastasia, Sydney Morris, midfielder Alison Hildreth, and goalies Mackenzie Jackson and Ivy Walsh. “I’ve had a lot of these girls for three or four years,” Winnacunnet coach Heidi Hand said. “It’s always a hard, emotional day. It was good to come out, play strong and get the win. These girls are a fun bunch. They're definitely outgoing and hard workers. They like to have fun, but when it’s time to practice, they are all business. They're great kids.” Anastasia scored her fourth goal of the season in Wednesday’s win. She’ll be sad when the season is over for her and her fellow seniors. “We’ve all been playing field hockey since the sixth grade,” she said. “We’re so close. We know each other so well, and that makes it so easy to play with each other.” Unbeaten streak reaches 10 The Warriors have gone 9-0-1 since a 2-1 loss to Keene in the second game of the season. “This group connects more than any other team I’ve had (in my six years),” Hand said. “There are no cliques, just one big group and I think that’s what is really working for us this year. Everyone is on the same page. Everyone comes to practice and games and just gets the job done.” Keene has gone 4-5 since the win over Winnacunnet, including four straight losses and is now 5-6 on the season. What’s on tap The Warriors are off until next Wednesday when they are at Bishop Guertin (9-2). Winnacunnet will conclude the regular season a week from Friday at Manchester Central (2-7-1). “Somewhat good and somewhat bad,” Hand said in reference to seven days between games. “I like a routine, but it’s good to get some rest and heal up. It’s good to give the girls some time off and then get back into it. I think we’re in a good place. I don’t like to look ahead, but I think where we are right now is good.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T18:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T18:07:42.183+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
