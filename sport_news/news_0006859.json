The Vikings scored 56, 43, 67 and 60 points and got to a running clock in three of the four games. The strength of their defense has yet to be determined, however, because they've really only played one good team, and Stevenson put up 29 points in defeat. H-F isn't likely to be tested again until Week 7 against Lincoln-Way East.\nHolecek, Ramblers rolling again\nIt took John Holecek 124 games to reach 100 coaching victories at Loyola, and what's really remarkable is the way the Ramblers continue to produce dominant teams relying largely on seniors who were not starters the previous season. This year's team is a perfect example and could be Holecek's best yet. The No. 2 Ramblers' 166-24 point differential has come against a tough early schedule. The one game they haven't won in Holecek's tenure is the last one. Loyola was the Class 8A runner-up in 2011 and '13.\nNew Trier's time to shine?\nIs New Trier ready to de-throne Maine South in the Central Suburban South? Let's see how the Trevians (4-0) fare Friday at Evanston (3-1). The Wildkits have plenty of talent and have rebounded nicely from their 48-21 loss to Notre Dame in Week 2. Maine South will likely enter its Week 7 matchup at New Trier with a 72-game CSL South winning streak.\nNazareth slowed by slop\nTaking nothing away from the fortitude Marian Central showed in scoring the final 34 points of its 34-19 victory over Nazareth last week, the condition of Marian's grass field following a 90-minute weather delay has to be taken into account. Nazareth's speed on the outside was largely neutralized by nature, and while Marian proved to be the tougher team that night, the loss doesn't make Nazareth any less of a contender for its second straight state championship.\nPrep football: Lincoln-Way North determined to go out on top Rich Mayor George Czart sat on his bed, hoping for a miracle.\nThe Lincoln-Way North football coach was streaming the District 210 school board meeting on his computer, flanked by his wife Jean, and his daughters, Jenna and Julia.
