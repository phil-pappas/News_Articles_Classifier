He played for coach Rick Pitino and Louisville from 2005-09.\nUSA TODAY\nBook claims U of L arranged for prostitutes\nHe was placed on administrative leave at UMKC as a private investigator, hired by U of L, looks into the allegations in coordination with the NCAA.\n\"He loves the University of Louisville and would not do anything to hurt the image of the university,\" Cox said.\nCox said McGee retained him and partner Michael Mazzoli about two weeks ago. U of L first learned of Powell's book in late August, when an Indiana University booster, Mickey Maurer, who is also the chairman of the company publishing the book, contacted an IU administrator about a photo Powell had.\nPitino said he learned about the book through former players who'd been contacted by the book's authors. Powell wrote the book with journalist Dick Cady.\nCox did confirm that McGee has met Powell before, but he said \"there was certainly nothing nefarious or inappropriate at all\" about their interactions.\nTHE COURIER-JOURNAL\nIU: We're not involved in Louisville escort scandal\n\"All the evidence that we've looked at supports his version of events, which is that he never paid her or anyone else to have sex with a player or a recruit,\" Cox said.\nOnce McGee sought their counsel, Cox and Mazzoli hired former FBI agents to look into the book's allegations, which claim McGee paid some $10,000 to Powell in exchange for escort services. He wouldn't comment on if McGee had taken a lie detector test, but he said their investigation has turned up nothing.\n\"Again, we haven't located a single witness to corroborate these allegations,\" Cox said.\n\"She is interested in making money,\" Cox said when asked why he believed Powell would publish the book if the allegations were untrue.\nTHE COURIER-JOURNAL\nSullivan | Pitino's doubts are not denials\nIt's unclear at this point if there will be any legal proceedings involving the book or McGee. Cox said that, as of now, he is helping McGee through the investigation process. But he did say that he and his legal team \"can't wait\" to look through the book and refute its accusations, which he said would be published next week.\n\"We're going to read every word, every sentence, every paragraph,\" Cox said. \"If there's anything in there, which I assume there will be, that's defamatory, we are so excited to get this in front of a Louisville jury and let them decide if this prostitute's telling the truth or if Andre McGee's telling the truth.\nGet the CJâ€™s free UofL CardsHQ newsletter\nLouisville's Andre McGee pretends to have trouble hearing the cheers of fans after scoring during the second half of their NCAA college basketball game against Marquette in Louisville, Ky., Sunday, March 1, 2009.
