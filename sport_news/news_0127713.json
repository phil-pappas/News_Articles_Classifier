Jefferson is setting itself up for something special \nNothing is set yet, and there is still plenty to play for, but from what the Dragons have shown us so far this season, we’re all-in on Jefferson football. A dominant line of scrimmage on both sides will take a team far, and Jefferson may just have the best group in northeast Georgia -- though Buford could also lay claim to that mantle. Blessed with size, experience and talent, the Dragons continued their mauling ways on Friday, largely shutting down Elbert County’s explosive attack both by stuffing the Blue Devils on defense and churning out long drives on offense (keeping Elbert County quarterback Mecole Hardman away from the ball). When you combine that with a special running back talent in sophomore Colby Wood, who rushed for 284 yards and four touchdowns on 47 carries in Friday’s win, you have the formula for a deep playoff run. Certainly there are obstacles in the way -- Oconee County is looking tough indeed -- but Jefferson certainly looks equipped to deal with any of them. \n2. Gainesville defense is a turnover machine \nTwo weeks ago Gainesville swarmed all over Heritage, Conyers, Chris Lyles picking off four passes in the win. Last week it was Salem’s turn to feel the bite of a Red Elephants squad with a knack for finding the ball. Gainesville nabbed six turnovers (including one on special teams) to help turn what could have been a tight game into a stroll in a 34-6 win. And with Lanier looming this week at City Park, the performance could not have come at a better time. The Longhorns have given the ball away a few times this season -- one of the few blemishes on Lanier’s perfect start -- and Gainesville would love to continue their swarming ways in a showdown of the only two teams undefeated in Region 8- play. We’ll be watching with interest, as this is one of those games we had circled on the calendar before the season even started. \n3. Region 7-AAA set for huge showdown in Dawsonville \nDawson County survived a stern East Hall test, while Franklin County rolled past Lumpkin County last week to set up this week’s battle for sole possession of first in 7-AAA. The winner will have the inside track to the region crown with three league contests remaining. This will be Dawson County’s biggest game in years -- and while the Tigers have never won a region title (and you can bet coaches and players won’t even be thinking about that yet) -- this year’s team has shown that it has the make-up to win big games, leaning on a trio of impressive players. Quarterback Coey Watson, running back Hunter Mitchell and receiver Tucker Maxwell have each put up big contests in Dawson’s two region wins, and you can bet Franklin County will be aware of their places on the field on every snap. \n4. North Hall will have a say in the Region 8-AAAA playoff race \nWe’ll say this for these Trojans, when they win, they win big. North Hall has already matched its 2014 victory total halfway into the 2015 campaign, and the Trojans did so in lopsided fashion in a 31-0 defeat of North Oconee on Friday. It came just one week after North Hall dropped a heartbreaking, 14-13 loss to Stephens County in Region 8-AAAA play. Up next is Buford. After that the Trojans face four teams that currently sport a combined record of 3-17. Only Buford and Stephens are now in front of North Hall in the 8-AAAA race, and from what the Trojans have shown, you have to figure that they have a good shot at nabbing a top four spot. Whatever happens North Hall will definitely have a say in the postseason race in 8-AAAA. \n5. Travae Cain is a force to be reckoned with \nWe knew that the Banks County standout could elevate to star status this season, and he certainly did that on Friday, scoring five touchdowns, piling up 330 total yards (300 rushing) while also forcing a fumble on defense to help the Leopards to a 52-28 win over Fannin County. The win got the Leopards right back in the thick of the Region 7-AAA race, and you can bet that the rest of the league will be wary of Cain in every remaining contest. \nWEEK 6 AREA HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL SCORES, OCT. 2 Athens Academy 36, Towns County 7 Banks County 52, Fannin County 28 Buford 56, Chestatee 0 Dawson County 35, East Hall 28 Franklin County 29, Lumpkin County 8 Gainesville 34, Salem 6 Hebron Christian 21, Lakeview Academy 0 Jefferson 27, Elbert County 8 Loganville 38, Apalachee 0 Mill Creek 52, Meadowcreek 0 Morgan County 37, East Jackson 7 Norcross 38, North Gwinnett 10 North Hall 31, North Oconee 0 Oconee County 29, Jackson County 0 Prince Avenue 35, Commerce 14 Rabun County 44, Social Circle 0 Riverside Military 21, Strong Rock Christian 7 Stephens County 29, Monroe Area 6 Union County 41, Oglethorpe County 6 White County 26, Madison County 11 Winder-Barrow 24, Flowery Branch 17 \nWEEK 7 AREA HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL SCHEDULE, OCT. 9 Athens Christian at Towns County Buford at North Hall East Jackson at Hart County Fannin County at Lumpkin County Flowery Branch at Clarke Central Franklin County at Dawson County George Walton Academy at Lakeview Academy Greene County at Union County Jackson County at Elbert County Johnson at Osborne", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T01:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T07:51:54.305+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
