File photo / Union Democrat. The Sierra-Tuolumne Kennel Club will host an all-breed American Kennel Club dog show this weekend at the Mother Lode Fairgrounds. The club is an all-breed dog club that’s been in Tuolumne County since 1973. It’s licensed by the American Kennel Club. The Sierra-Tuolumne Kennel Club is a purebred dog organization, but all breeds are welcome, said president Mary Barrett, of Sonora. We have a nice variety (of dog breeds) now, from terriers to sporting dogs to more, Barrett said. The purpose of the club is to promote responsible ownership and training, Barrett said. They also strive to promote good sportsmanship in competitions. On that platform, the group will host its 2015 all-breed American Kennel Club “Barktoberfest” today and Sunday at the Mother Lode Fairgrounds in Sonora. The event is free, but parking is $5. It will be from 8 a.m. to 3 p.m. today and Sunday. The Westminster-like contest will include exhibitors from all over Northern California and Nevada, Barrett said. Classes in the competition include Sporting, Working, Terrier, Toy, Hound, Non-Sporting and Herding. The winner of each group competes for Best in Show. The event also will include vendors and microchip and chiropractic clinics on Sunday. There will also be a Barn Hunt Association-sanctioned Barn Hunt, in which dogs compete to find rats in a barn. There will be sanctioned runs both days. Visit the Barn Hunt website to get a BHA registration number at www.barnhunt.com. A Barn Hunt is where dogs of all breeds and mixed breeds hunt for contained rats hidden within a maze of straw bales. The dog that finds the rats the fastest is the winner, but any dog finding the rat within the allotted time has qualified. The rats are safe inside heavy plastic tubes. Sierra-Tuolumne Kennel Club will also host two raffles, the proceeds from which will go to help animal victims of the Butte Fire, and to Take the Lead, a nonprofit organization that assists people involved with dogs in times of need. A basket raffle and quilt raffle also will be held. Starting in January, the Sierra-Tuolumne Kennel Club will host another round of dog training classes. The club offers four sessions of classes per year, each of which lasts seven weeks. The classes are for puppies, basic obedience/good citizen, intermediate obedience, rally, agility and conformation. Classes are held Wednesday evenings at the Mother Lode Fairgrounds in Sonora, with the exception of Agility, which is held adjacent to the Humane Society in Jamestown. Class sizes are limited. Pre-registration is recommended. Classes are $75 for a seven-week course. January classes are held indoors, and class size is limited by the space. The first round of Basic Obedience and Puppy classes will be held Jan. 6 to Feb. 17. Intermediate Obedience will be offered if there is sufficient enrollment from Jan. 6 to Feb. 17. Rally Novice, Advanced and Excellence class times will be based on enrollment and held beginning in January. Spring agility class dates have not yet been set. Agility classes are held adjacent to the Humane Society in Jamestown. A basic obedience class is a prerequisite for agility. The club meets the third Monday of the month at the Humane Society of Tuolumne County, 10040 Victoria Way in Jamestown. For more information about the club, go online to www.stkc.org.
