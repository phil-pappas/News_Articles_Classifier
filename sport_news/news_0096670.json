It’s certainly not editorializing to say that Costa is a polarizing figure who certainly has no problem bending and breaking the rules on occasion. His track record of red cards and match bans verify his well deserved reputation as a “dirty player.” \nOne of Diego Costa’s Chelsea teammates even said last month that Costa “like to cheat a lot,” before later walking back those comments on Twitter a bit. \nBBC’s “Football Focus” did an interview of Costa a couple days ago, and Diego Costa had the following to say about his edgy brand of football, a style of play that has lost him his place with the Spain national team. Spanish boss Vicente del Bosque does not approve of Costa’s recent actions. \n“I’ve got this far thanks to the way I play the game. I’m not going to change that because of what people may think of it… I think that football has always had a passionate, aggressive side, with players giving their all. People have to get used to this. Some people seem to think football is like theatre, and that everyone has to play the good guy. \n“But I think that you transform when you cross the white line, you’re not the same person as off it. I give no quarter and I ask for none. Out there I’m going to fight for my team and do the best I can. Afterwards, when the match is over, I have my family and my friends. I have fun like a normal person. But on the pitch don’t try and put wings on me, as I am no angel.” \nWell, there you go. Diego Costa takes both ownership of his reputation, and pride in having that rep.
