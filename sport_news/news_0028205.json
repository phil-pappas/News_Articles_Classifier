After missing wide on an extra-point kick in the third quarter, Cayer kicked a 20-yard field goal with 3:56 to play, giving Bishop Feehan a 9-6 win over defending champion Somerset Berkley Regional in Eastern Athletic Conference football on Friday night at McGrath Field. The Shamrocks (3-3, 3-0 EAC) sit on the inside track to the EAC title. They win it outright if the beat Bishop Stang next week at Feehan. Two-time defending league champion Somerset Berkley (4-2, 2-1 EAC) needs to beat Martha’s Vineyard next week and have Stang upset Feehan in order to claim a share of the 2015 title. Cayer’s field goal directly followed a big-time goal line stand by the Raiders (4-2, 2-1 EAC) and capped a 15-play, 60-yard drive that started with two-and-a-half minutes left in the third quarter. Four plays before the field goal, Feehan quarterback Matthew Everton (105 yards on 21 rushes; 7-for-11 for 94 yards passing) darted 14 yards to a half-yard short of the end zone. Feehan’s William Sarro recovered a botched snap on first down, and SB stopped Everton for no gain on second a down and tackled Zachary Goslin for a two-yard loss on third down. When Feehan coach Curt Smith sent Cayer out to kick from the center of the field, SB called an ice-the-kicker timeout. When play resumed, Cayer nailed the kick. Nate Holt’s 27-yard kickoff return put SB at its own 40, but the Raiders, 6-0 leaders at the half, were penalized five yards and lost the ball on downs at the 37. “It was a good game. It could have gone either way,” Somerset Berkley coach Nick Freitas said. “They’ve got a little more depth. It is what it is, what are you going to do? Good game. “The kids played hard. All you can ask is for them to leave it on the field and they left it on the field.” Feehan was a ball hog in the second half, running 33 plays to SB’s seven, devouring most of the clock with two long drives, the first of those a 65-yarder to start the second half. Jason Medeiros, a 220-pound fullback, capped that first drive with a stand-up three-yard TD run. Cayer was wide right on the kick. SB had no first downs in the second half and just two in the first. Most of their offense amounted to one play, Blair Gomes’ 81-yard rumble to the Feehan three yard line midway through the second quarter. Feehan’s defense then held before quarterback Justin Duarte, in the middle of a pile, bulled into the end zone on fourth-and-goal from the 1. The two-point conversion rush failed. Page 2 of 2 - Feehan moved the ball in the first half, but SB twice knocked the ball from Everton and recovered, the first time at the Raider 22 in the first quarter. The second turnover came when Everton was hit at the SB two yard line at the end of a 21-yard run on the first play of the second quarter. SB’s CJ Mulrooney recovered in the end zone. “I thought we were dominating the game and we just kept making mistakes,” Feehan coach Curt Smith said. Feehan outgained Somerset Berkley 247 yards to 131. Smith said his crew took a simple approach to defending SB’s ball-control rushing game. “Toughness. You can’t let them bully you,” he said. “You have to attack them. On film, we see people trying to read it. You’ve got to attack them. They’re attacking you. “Someone’s going to get knocked out. So we just say it’s a one-yard war every play. It’s a 44-minute one-yard war.” Email Greg Sullivan at gsullivan@heraldnews.com.
