On Monday, Guthrie and the MLB gave first grader Marion Gragg and his foster family seats to Game 1 of the AL Division Series. \n“Every day I work hard,” Marion said. \n“It means a great deal to me. I don't think he understands yet, what he got into, but he said it was great,” said his foster mom, Erica Smith. \nMarion has been in the care of Smith since April. The MLB worked with the Royals and the elementary school to pick out the child most deserving of the tickets. \nClick here to watch the final version of the Royals video. \nCopyright 2015 KCTV (Meredith Corp.)
