Kennedy International Airport in New York, and the Mets said the plane was diverted back to Ireland, where Staub was treated. \nStaub played nine of his 23 seasons for the Mets over two stints in the 1970s and 1980s. An outfielder, first baseman and pinch hitter, he is a member of the Mets Hall of Fame. \nStaub has remained popular with Mets fans. His foundation raises money for the families of New York police officers and firefighters killed in the line of duty. \nAll content copyright ©2015  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T03:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T04:55:39.172+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
