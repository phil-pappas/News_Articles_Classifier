(Photo: AP) \nANAHEIM, Calif. — Anton Khudobin rebounded from a rough outing with 34 saves, and the Anaheim Ducks got goals from Cam Fowler, Rickard Rakell and Mike Santorelli to beat the Minnesota Wild 4-1 on Sunday night for their first victory of the season. \nKhudobin, who was pulled less than 13 minutes into a 4-0 loss the Arizona Coyotes last Wednesday after giving up three goals on eight shots in his Ducks debut, got another chance against the club that drafted him in 2004. The only goal against him was by Nino Niederreiter with 7:05 left in the first period. \nMinnesota goalie Devan Dubnyk, who made 21 saves, was pulled by coach Mike Yeo in favor of an extra attacker with 21/2 minutes remaining, and Hampus Lindholm capped the scoring with an empty-net goal with 1:09 to play. \nRakell snapped a 1-1 tie at 16:01 of the first period with the first goal by a Ducks forward this season. He redirected Lindholm’s one-timer past Dubnyk’s glove, after Corey Perry circled the net with defenseman Matt Dumba chasing him and fed the puck to Lindholm about 45 feet from the net. \nThe Ducks, whose only goal during their first four games was scored by defenseman Sami Vatanen, opened the scoring at 10:08 of the first period with a screened 50-foot wrist shot by Fowler that beat Dubnyk low to the stick side. \nThe goal came less than two minutes after Minnesota’s Jason Zucker hit the crossbar from close range. Teammate Mikko Koivu also hit the crossbar with a one-timer from the low slot midway through the second period during a Minnesota power play. \nNOTES : Khudobin played his first six NHL games with Minnesota during a span of two seasons (four starts), going 4-1 with a 1.40 goals-against average and one shutout. … Anaheim’s victory left Columbus (0-6-0) as the NHL’s only winless team. Minnesota’s defeat left Montreal (6-0-0) as the only club that hasn’t lost in regulation. … Anaheim was 0-for-2 on the power play, and is 0-for-13 altogether. … Shea Theodore, called up from the Ducks’ AHL club in San Diego along with Korbinian Holzer on Saturday because of injuries to Simon Despres and Clayton Stoner, made his NHL debut. Theodore was selected 26th overall in the 2013 draft, and Holzer was acquired from Toronto in March. … Stoner missed his third straight game due to a lower body injury. Despres suffered a head injury Friday night after taking a hit from Colorado’s Tyson Barrie, who received a three-game suspension from the league. … The Ducks embark on a five-game road trip, after which they will play six of their next seven at home. … The teams will have a rematch next Saturday at Minnesota. \nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
