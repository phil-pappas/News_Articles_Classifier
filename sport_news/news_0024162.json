I dropped back,\" Lynch said. \"Reading the routes, the guy ran a slant. It was a little overthrown, I came up on it, and I grabbed it.\" \nThe Lions took the turnover 65 yards in 10 plays and scored. They scored on their next four possessions, too, to take a 33-0 lead. It was 53-6 when the first team left the game.. \n\"That (interception) turned the whole pages around, and we went on that long drive,\" Foran coach Jeff Bevino said. \n\"We knew that was one of their good bread-and-butter plays they wanted to go to, and the kid stepped right in front of it. He was in the right place.\" \nBevino credited the Lions' defensive coaches with catching that play, which the Whalers (1-4) ran to score against Ledyard. \n\"I thought we played well tonight,\" Bevino said. \"I don't think it had anything to do with how good or how bad they are. They're big. They're physical.\" \nNew London didn't have an answer for the Lions often, though. Brett Huber was involved in five touchdowns: The junior ran for the first, caught three and threw for another. R.J. Balado ran for 122 yards on 21 carries and both caught and ran for a score. \n\"We just have playmakers all over the field,\" Huber said. \nQuarterback Lance DiNatale 's first three passes fell incomplete. He finished 12-for-19 for 245 yards and five touchdowns. \nForan scored 50 points for the second week in a row and the third time in four games. \n\"We were clicking on all cylinders,\" Bevino said. \n\"The offensive line played phenomenal today. Lance had all day to throw the ball. ... He's getting better every week, every single week.\" \nThe Lions' second drive took 13 plays and scored on the first play of the second quarter, a 19-yard score from DiNatale to Colin Firmender to make it 12-0. \nZach Cleary 's squib kick hit a couple of Whalers before Foran's Matt Cruz jumped on top of it at the Whalers 34. On the first play, Huber hit Firmender for another score 10 seconds after his first. \n\"We practiced that one all week,\" Huber said. \"We practiced it many times. I was just afraid I was going to underthrow him, and that was it. He made a great catch and a great effort to get in.\" \nForan's defense settled in nicely after that first drive. New London didn't earn another first down until 7:14 remained in the second quarter and the Lions had their 33-0 lead. Jordan Townsend sacked Gomez three times. \nThe easy win kept the Lions undefeated for next Friday's homecoming game against West Haven (3-2). \n\"It's great. I can't wait for next week, coming in, West Haven, 5-0,\" Lynch said. \"It's going to be a great game, a great team we're going up against.\" \nFORAN 53, NEW LONDON 28 \nNEW LONDON 0 6 0 22—28 \nFORAN 6 34 13 0—53 \nF-- Brett Huber 2 run (run failed) \nF--Colin Firmender 19 pass Lance DiNatale (run failed) \nF--Firmender 34 pass Huber (Zach Cleary kick) \nF--R.J.
