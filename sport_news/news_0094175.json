A European hunter slaughtered one of Zimbabwe’s biggest elephants and then smugly posed next to his record-setting kill — just after poachers poisoned another 40 animals with cyanide.\nExperts believe that the elephant shot dead on Oct. 8 near Zimbabwe’s southern Gonarezhou National Park is the largest killed in Africa in at least 30 years. Its tusks weighed a whopping 120 pounds each.\nThe hunter, reportedly a German national, paid $60,000 to kill the giant, the Telegraph reported.\nPark officials confirmed the killing by a “foreign client” and defended the legal hunt as a source of much needed money for communities living near game parks. The elephant, likely between 40 and 60 years old, was shot dead in the Malipati Safari area, where legal hunting channels funds to poor rural communities nearby.\nA photo of the hunter proudly locking hands with his tour guide in front of the dead elephant outraged conservationists. The European killer smirked and clutched a rifle while the chaperone grinned and squatted on the downed creature's knee.\nThe killing was legal but “unethical,” said Johnny Rodrigues of the Zimbabwe Conservation Taskforce.\nCARL DE SOUZA/AFP/Getty Images A Kenya Wildlife Services officer stands near a burning pile of 15 tons of elephant ivory seized in Kenya at Nairobi National Park in March. The controversy over the elephant brought back memories of the killing of a beloved lion named Cecil in July.\nIt also came as dozens of elephants were poisoned in another park. At least 40 elephants were poisoned by cyanide in the country's biggest game reserve, Hwange National Park, earlier this month.\nThe poachers dumped blocks of industrial-grade cyanide watering holes and salt licks, Caroline Washaya-Moyo, a spokeswoman for Zimbabwe’s Parks and Wildlife Management Authority, told The Washington Post.\nWhile they killed dozens of elephants — and other animals that drank the tainted water — the hunters only walked away with seven sets of tusks. Patrol planes likely forced the bandits to flee before they could claim all of their prizes. Some of the elephants were too young to even have tusks.\nCHECK OUT OUR NEW APP: GET THE DAILY NEWS ON ANDROID AND iOS\nEcoPic/Getty Images/iStockphoto At least 40 elephants were poisoned by cyanide in Zimbabwe's biggest game reserve earlier this month. Oppah Muchinguri — Zimbabwe’s minister for environment, water and climate — blamed the uptick in illegal poaching on the U.S.’s ban on sport hunting in the African nation.\nMoney from sport hunting goes directly to conservation efforts, she said. Without Americans spending money to hunt, Zimbabwe loses wildlife protections funds.\n“All this poaching is because of American policies,” she told the Guardian , referencing the U.S.’s 2014 ban on the import of elephant trophies from Zimbabwe. “An elephant would cost $120,000 in sport hunting but a tourist pays only $10 to view the same elephant.”\nWith News Wire Services\nRelated Stories Malawi to burn $7.5M worth of ivory to try and stop poachers U.S. officials destroy 6 tons of illegal ivory for global anti-poaching message Prince William calls rhino poaching 'utterly wrong' Rare rhino mistakenly killed by anti-poaching activists Surge in poaching makes 2011 worst year in decades for endangered elephants", "external_links": ["http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/14/bodies-of-dozens-of-elephants-found-poisoned-in-zimbabwe?CMP=twt_b-gdnnews", "http://nydn.us/app", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/africa/zimbabwe-elephant-with-big-ivory-tusks-killed-in-legal-hunt/2015/10/17/797b90b8-74f2-11e5-ba14-318f8e87a2fc_story.html", "http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/zimbabwe/11934535/Huge-tusked-African-elephant-killed-by-german-hunter-in-Zimbabwe.html"], "published": "2015-10-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T23:41:59.548+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
