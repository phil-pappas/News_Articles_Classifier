They entered the conference tournament as the No. 5 seed and had to take on No. 4 Freedom without senior captain Byron Derti . \nThey survived with a 4-3 win to take on No. 1 Emmaus in the semifinals, with Derti back on the pitch, where their coach, Birns, was dealt a red card in the second half while they hung on to a 1-0 lead. They responded to their Birns’ ejection by scoring another goal to secure the 2-0 win. \nParkland then had to face No. 2 Pocono Mountain East Thursday night at Andrew S. Leh Stadium, without Birns at the helm, and faced a 1-0 deficit less than five minutes into the game. \nBut the Trojans leaned on what their coach preached to them to stage one final win . \n“He always teaches us to play through adversity,” said Peter Kwakye-Ackah , whose header gave Parkland the 3-2 win over Pocono Mountain East. \n“This is a story for the ages.” \nMORE : Kwakye-Ackah saves backflip for EPC boys soccer winner \nBirns would have been proud of his team fought through the adversity all night, though he may have been watching thanks to technology. \n“I know he’s watching right now on FaceTime or whatever it is,” said assistant coach Scott Mang, who stood in for Birns as the acting head coach. “… I don’t know if there’s Wi-Fi in the stadium or what. I’m sure he was here somehow. Maybe he directed that last goal, I don’t know.” \nDespite going down early, the Trojans battled back to tie the game and then take the lead early in the second half. It didn’t last for long, though, as the Cardinals tied up shortly after. \nStill, sophomore goalie Jake Varrato kept a level head in net, which proved critical when Pocono Mountain East had a chance to win it with three minutes left in regulation. Ian Lake came in with a tight angle and got a shot off on Varrato, who made the point blank save. \n“It’s not the best situation to be in, but you have to build off it,” Varrato said. “It’s my first year, with all this pressure, the only thing you can do is learn from it. I’ve had mistakes this year but I’ve bounced back and it’s all about learning.” \nInstead, it was Kwakye-Ackah who converted for Parkland at the other end not even a minute later. The junior had only scored one goal coming into Thursday, but he stepped up when his team needed it most – a common theme through its run to the championship. \n“This is absolutely Patrick’s team,” Mang said. “(But) you could put Humpty Dumpty out here and it doesn’t matter because at this point in the year, guys know where they’re playing, they know their roles, you know who’s subbing. \n“… At this point, it’s like everyone get together, everyone play. You don’t need a coach. The kids really responded.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T08:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T03:09:49.037+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
