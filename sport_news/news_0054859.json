Another reason for the reduced rates was the poor turnout during the India vs England ODI in 2011 when only 18,000 spectators witnessed the action in the 33,000-capacity stadium â€” Wankhede's lowest-ever turnout for an ODI. India won that one-day international by six wickets.\nRevised ticket rates \n> Garware Club House (upper, lower and guest stand) Rs 1,500 instead of Rs 2,000\n> Sunil Gavaskar stand (lower) Rs 750 instead of Rs 1,000\n> North Stand R 2,000 instead of Rs 3,000", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T12:13:10.219+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
