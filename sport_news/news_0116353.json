On October 20, Congressman Ted Poe, Chairman of the Subcommittee on Terrorism, Non-proliferation and Trade, urged Obama to not engage in any negotiations regarding a US-Pakistan civil nuclear agreement.\n“Pakistan has repeatedly proven itself to be deceptive and deceitful,” he alleged.\n“Simply put, Pakistan’s current and past record is disqualifying for any consideration by the US to support civilian nuclear cooperation with Pakistan bilaterally or in any relevant multilateral forum,” Poe has said. — PTI", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T14:07:36.598+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
