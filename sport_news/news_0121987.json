John “Jack” Ashley III of Freetown, 12 years old, who comes from a strong lineage of hunters, beamed with pride and excitement as he described his first hunting experience with his grandfather, John Ashley, also of Freetown, during the state’s first Youth Deer Hunt on Oct. 3. Sitting in a treestand for two that the elder Ashley had built, Jack admitted to growing just a bit bored staring at the same landscape and scenery for almost two hours that afternoon, until he spotted a deer, only 25 yards away that seemed to have appeared from out of nowhere, as it never made a sound. “I looked down and there it was — I was trying to whisper to Papa, ‘right there, right there, right there,'” said Jack. They had sat in the same stand early that morning for two hours without seeing anything and did some scouting during the middle of the day and decided to go back to the stand for the late afternoon hunt. “I had really been looking forward to that day,” Jack said. “I’ve been going hunting along with Papa for the past few years, just to go and watch, he said. This time, I actually got to hunt.” In Massachusetts, the minimum age to actually hunt is 12 and young hunters 12 through 14 must be supervised by a licensed adult. “We’ve always been buddies,\" said Jack of his grandfather and himself. “We’ve always spent a lot of time together.” The hunt wasn’t all that encouraging to begin with however, as it seemed that Jack hadn’t been able to hit the broad side of a barn from the inside with the new shotgun his grandfather had just bought. “We’d go out in the back and do some target practicing but he couldn’t hit the target,” said John. “He was disappointed and down in the mouth about it, and even his mother was skeptical about him going and asked if he wanted to wait until next year.” Jack had no confidence, he didn’t want to wound a deer and his hopes of going on the youth deer hunt began to fade. “Then it dawned on me,” John continued. “I said, ‘you’ve got glasses — put ‘em on.’ So he tried shooting with his glasses on and he started hitting the target.” Jack and his father, John Ashley Jr., began practicing with a .22 rifle, then went back to the shotgun, which Jack began to build confidence with, enough so that he was ready for the first Youth Deer Hunt in Massachusetts. “I had been waiting for that day for a long time,” said John Sr. \"Other states do it. New Hampshire does it. Maine does it. I’m glad Massachusetts finally did it.” MassWildlife created this special season to provide young people an opportunity to hunt deer with their own permit during a special one-day season that precedes the state’s annual deer hunting seasons. It’s open to young hunters ages 12 through 17, both residents and non-residents. No hunting license is required of 12–14-year olds, but the youth must obtain the free special permit and be accompanied by a duly licensed adult. Youths 15-17 years old must obtain the permit and also hold a Massachusetts minor hunting license. Non-resident 15–17-year olds must possess a Massachusetts non-resident big game hunting license and the youth deer permit. During the hunt, shotguns, muzzleloaders and bows and arrows may be used, and youths may take one deer of either sex. After not sleeping the night before because all he could think about was going deer hunting the next day, the moment of truth was at hand and Jack was sitting next to his grandfather with a deer at close range — and they were staring eyeball to eyeball. John had handed Jack the gun but he bumped the stand with it while getting into shooting position and the deer looked straight up, its eyes fixed on their position. “’Don’t you move, don’t you move,’ Papa whispered to me,” said Jack. “The deer was staring up at us and its ears were moving like radar ears. I didn’t dare breathe.” Finally the deer put its head down and began feeding along the run again, and Jack shouldered the gun and was taking careful aim. “You and I could have shot 45 deer in the time it was taking him to aim at this one,” John joked. “My heart was beating out of my chest,” said Jack. “I wanted my aim to be straight — I didn’t want to wound it or miss it.” The gun barked and Jack’s aim was true. It was a nice doe. It ran a short ways after the shot, so they climbed down from the stand and went to recover it. Kneeling next to the deer, Jack said his heart was still racing and his emotions were a bit mixed. He said, “I looked at the deer and said, ‘sorry’, then I said, ‘Yes!’ I wouldn’t shoot it just to shoot it. We’re eating it.” It was a moment they’ll both remember always. “Being with your grandson when he shoots his first deer — it’s something you won’t forget,” said John Sr. “I’m so proud of him,” added John Jr. The elder mentor showed the fledgling hunter how to field dress the deer and they dragged it out of the woods, then they skinned and butchered it the next day. Jack says he enjoys the venison and has been eating it since he can remember. “I love it,” he said. “We’ve had my deer two days in a row and last night we had grilled backstrips. The whole thing was awesome. Can’t wait to go next year.” After posting a picture of himself with his deer on social media, Jack got a few comments from girls who said, “Ewww, you killed Bambi,” but they just don’t get it, he said. Most all of the comments were positive. They talked of their hunt and the things they do together as grandfather and grandson, and their future plans for when Jack will be big enough to hunt with a bow that’s powerful enough to kill a deer. John Sr. said that Jack’s doe is the first deer that’s been shot from the new blind. “And I lost a gun because of it,” he said. “I made the mistake of telling Jack that if he shot a deer with the new gun I had just bought, the gun would be his. Well, now it’s his.” Jack’s sister, Beatrice, 9, who was listening to her brother and grandfather recant their adventurous tale, said she may want to go with her Papa in a few years when she turns 12. Those who hunted during Massachusetts’ first Youth Hunt Day are encouraged to share photos of their experiences on facebook.com/masswildlife using #MAYouthDeerDay . MassWildlife Deer Biologist David Stainbrook said that 1,339 permits were issued for the hunt and 127 young hunters who bagged deer checked them in through the online check system. He said that several deer were checked in at traditional check stations which have not yet reported those numbers, and he expects the total harvest to be around 140 deer. “The hunt went very smoothly,” said Stainbrook. “It provides a great opportunity for kids to get outdoors and experience hunting before the regular seasons begin.” He said the hunt was adopted and finalized after the 2015 Hunting and Fishing Guides had been published and was only announced through media outlets and social media, therefore he expects even more participation next year after it’s published in the 2016 Guide. New Hampshire’s youth deer weekend is Oct. 24-25 and is open to youths ages 15 and younger who are supervised by a licensed adult. There is no minimum age limit for hunting in New Hampshire. Nonresident youths may participate in New Hampshire’s youth deer weekend only if their state of residence allows New Hampshire youth to participate in its youth deer hunt. Maine’s youth hunt day is Oct. 24 and is open to residents and non-residents ages 10–15 years old, who must be supervised by a licensed adult. Maine Governor Paul LePage recently signed into law a bill that repeals Maine’s minimum hunting age of 10. Beginning on January 1, kids of any age may hunt in Maine, with adult supervision. Maine now joins 39 other states that allow kids of any age to hunt with adult supervision. Marc Folco is the outdoor writer for The Standard-Times.
