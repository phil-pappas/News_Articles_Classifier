In the background, however, several of his Bengals teammates were naked, getting ready to shower and change into street clothes.\nMcCarron, wife of Bengals backup quarterback AJ McCarron, was not happy with the invasion of the team’s privacy. And she made sure everyone knew about it via her tweets:\nHow is this ok? What about female reporters required to get an interview? https://t.co/n3RSexRILR \n— Katherine McCarron (@_KatherineWebb) October 19, 2015 \nNo missing the point. Players should have their privacy. I'm sure female reports would rather not be in there https://t.co/1FjAXHQxPH \n— Katherine McCarron (@_KatherineWebb) October 19, 2015 \nI would rather my husbands ass/penis not be all over TV. Would you like to be filmed while naked? https://t.co/0cWsGDE5zj \n— Katherine McCarron (@_KatherineWebb) October 19, 2015 \n\nAn NFL Network executive told ESPN that the interview “was a regrettable mistake by our production team.” \nA screen grab of the locker room shot before players were pictured naked. Photo: NFL Network When the interview wrapped and cut back to the studio, the anchors there were well aware of what had transpired.\n“What an interview,” one said. “That was interesting,” said another.\nWebb wasn’t the only one who took issue with the interview. Bengals offensive lineman Andrew Whitworth also vented his frustrations on Twitter, with the mishap sparking debate about how much media access is too much.\nwhy do I have to explain to my kids why their dad is naked on tv? \n @nflcommish ?? \n @nflnetwork ??\nTime for a media policy change!!\n— Andrew Whitworth (@BigWhit77_fndn) October 19, 2015 \nWe work in large massive stadiums. There's plenty of other spaces to interview. #NoExcuses https://t.co/uLgMYh0eRX \n— Andrew Whitworth (@BigWhit77_fndn) October 19, 2015 \n\n“It’s not like it bothers me personally,” Whitworth, the Bengals’ union player rep, told reporters Monday, according to ESPN. “(But) you can’t judge us off who we will and won’t accept into our locker room and then say all these things we have to do, but then also put us in a situation where every single day I have to change clothes and be naked or not in front of media. It’s just not right. There’s no office. There’s no other situation in America where you have to do that. It’s dated, it’s old, and it needs to change.”\nNFL Network apologized to the Bengals for the interview and said there would be a review of their procedures.\n  This article originally appeared on Fox Sports .\nFiled under aj mccarron ,  cincinnati bengals ,  katherine webb ,  nfl", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T14:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T23:30:59.687+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
