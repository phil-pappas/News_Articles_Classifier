The commission meets Thursday.\nBut the monitors double as credit card payment consoles so it would have to be replaced with other technology. One possibility would have drivers hand a tablet or smartphone with a credit card reader to passengers for payment.\nThe commission has received complaints from both passengers and drivers regarding the Taxi TV's repetitive programming and often malfunctioning mute and power buttons.\nIt says the plan is to eventually replace all the Taxi TV screens.\nInformation from: The New York Times, http://www.nytimes.com\n ", "external_links": ["http://nyti.ms/1NGiWyJ"], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T12:59:26.152+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
