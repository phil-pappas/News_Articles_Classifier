And they haven’t lost in more than a month. \nFifth-ranked Springville aims to extend what potentially could be their best volleyball season in school history Tuesday; they host Iowa Mennonite in a Class 1A regional quarterfinal. \nFirst serve is 7 p.m. \nRegionals began last Tuesday in 1A and 2A, then had a week off before the quarterfinal matches. Springville (28-7) had a first-round bye, and hasn’t played since Oct. 17, when it won the Tri-Rivers Conference tournament. \n“We have nine seniors who have done a good job keeping us focused in the right direction,” said Orioles Coach Claude Howard. “It’s been a great season; this is as high as we’ve ever been ranked.” \nSpringville’s best season was 2008, when it reached the 1A state semifinals. The Orioles returned to state in 2013, and several key players on that team are leaders this fall. \nThat includes Megan Wagaman, an all-stater last year who averages 3.47 kills per set and sports a .311 kill efficiency. \n“This team has grown a ton from last year,” Howard said. “It’s an aggressive, up-tempo team that likes to run as fast as we can.” \nSpringville has won 22 of its last 23 matches, including 10 in a row. \nIMS (12-18) advanced with a first-round sweep of Keota. \nTuesday’s 1A area schedule features a match between two ranked teams: No. 13 Turkey Valley (26-6) takes a 15-match win streak to No. 2 Tripoli (20-14). It also includes a battle at Marengo between No. 9 Iowa Valley (23-8) and Montezuma (22-7), the champion and co-runner-up of the South Iowa Cedar League. \nAmong area ranked 2A teams, No. 4 West Branch (32-5) hosts Iowa City Regina (18-15) and No. 14 North Cedar (28-10) entertains Lisbon (8-20). West Branch and North Cedar were regular-season divisional champions of the River Valley Conference. \nTUESDAY’S CLASS 2A REGIONAL QUARTERFINALS \n(All matches, 7 p.m.) \nJesup (16-15) at Sumner-Fredericksburg (27-3) \nSouth Winneshiek (14-21) at Postville (0-22) \nSaint Ansgar (14-9) at Lake Mills (38-1) \nCentral Springs (18-9) at Nashua-Plainfield (21-10) \nRegion 7 \nMaquoketa Valley (12-13) at Wapsie Valley (28-4) \nStarmont (30-9) at Denver (33-10) \nLisbon (8-20) at North Cedar (28-10) \nNorth-Linn (14-16) at Alburnett (16-17) \nRegion 8 \nIowa City Regina (18-15) at West Branch (32-5) \nLouisa-Muscatine (0-26) at Highland (19-12) \nDurant (21-9) at Tipton (21-12) \nWest Burlington (18-15) at Wapello (19-11) \nTUESDAY’S CLASS 1A REGIONAL QUARTERFINALS \n(All matches, 7 p.m.) \nMontezuma (22-7) at Iowa Valley (23-8) \nColfax-Mingo (8-17) at HLV (10-11) \nGladbrook-Reinbeck (15-16) at Janesville (22-14) \nNorth Tama (15-13) at Colo-Nesco (5-16) \nRegion 6 \nRockford (14-14) at Northwood-Kensett (17-8) \nTurkey Valley (26-6) at Tripoli (20-14) \nClarksville (5-18) at Dunkerton (16-6) \nWaterloo Christian (7-12) at Don Bosco (17-10) \nRegion 7 \nMidland (16-17) at Bellevue Marquette (20-7) \nLone Tree (16-10) at Calamus-Wheatland (21-10) \nWACO (9-18) at Burlington Notre Dame (18-17) \nIowa Mennonite (12-18) at Springville (28-7) \nRegion 8 \nSigourney (10-15) at New London (34-6) \nSoutheast Warren (12-14) at Twin Cedars (2-17) \nMoulton-Udell (3-17) at Fort Madison Holy Trinity (29-11) \nSeymour (15-9) at Moravia (15-10) \nl Comments: (319) 368-8857; jeff.linder@thegazette.com Your Next Articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T16:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T22:28:44.153+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
