Second baseman Dee Gordon, acquired by Jennings from the Dodgers, won the National League batting title (.333) and also was first in the league with 58 steals. The last player to win both titles in the same season was Jackie Robinson in 1949. \nJennings, an incredibly upbeat man, ran into bigger problems. \nThe chemistry was bad in some cases -- notably right-hander Mat Latos. The closer, Steve Cishek, went from reliable to terrible seemingly overnight. The center fielder, Marcell Ozuna, showed up overweight and was soon sent to the minors, his season ruined. This was a mess everywhere you turned, and the Marlins finished out of the playoffs for the 21st time in 23 years as a franchise. \nThe right general manager and a respected manager are likely needed to get the Marlins headed in the right direction. \n\"We have a great core,\" Jennings has said repeatedly this year. \nThe Marlins didn't determine a role for Jennings this week, leaving open the possibility that he could turn up with another team. \nThe team announced outfielder Ichiro Suzuki signed a one-year contract for 2016.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T21:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-07T00:54:44.791+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
