Tech made the NIT last year but the Lady Bulldogs have won the last four meetings. It’s always a good test to meet this in-state rival early, and both teams should have a good idea where they stand after this one. — Sunday, Jan. 3 at Texas A&M: Georgia’s first Southeastern Conference game of the season will provide an excellent opportunity to wash away the nasty taste of last year’s league woes. The Aggies scored a slim 3-point victory over Georgia last year and have never lost to the Lady Bulldogs in five contests. — Sunday, Jan. 10 vs. Kentucky: The Wildcats went 23-9 last season, finished the year ranked No. 11 in the country and defeated the Lady Bulldogs 60-52 last January. This is another game that should give Georgia a good index as to where it stands in the league moving forward. — Thursday, Jan. 28 vs. Auburn: The Lady Bulldogs hit rock-bottom last year against the Tigers in Athens, losing 44-26, the fewest points Georgia has scored in school history. A good game here could go a long way in erasing that horrific memory. — Thursday, Feb. 18 at South Carolina: At this point in the campaign, there should be no surprises as to who the top teams in the conference — and in the country — are. It’s likely South Carolina will once again be atop the polls, and considering that the Gamecocks limited Georgia to but 35 points last season, there’s no doubt the Lady Bulldogs will be primed to bite in Columbia. \nOnlineAthens.com aims to foster constructive, respectful civic conversation.
