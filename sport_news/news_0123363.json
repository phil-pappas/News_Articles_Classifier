It doesn't mean he is coming, but it means he is more open to the idea, which you couldn't have said two or three years ago.\" \nMessi has been with Barcelona since 2001 and has previously said he wants to retire with the Catalan club. \nHowever, he has had to deal with testing off-field issues this year as he is due to face trial for alleged tax fraud. \nBalague says the Argentina international is \"very unhappy\" with the tax case and explained what it could take for him to leave Barca. \n\"How to convince Messi goes beyond what you can do money wise,\" he said. \"It has be a project to win, perhaps with a manager that he would be comfortable with. \n\"He is in a situation where he is very unhappy with the tax case and also maybe has a new maturity with two kids where perhaps he wants to learn another language. \n\"It's a few things that make the proposition attractive, but doesn't mean he is going to go.\" Promoted Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T07:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T17:28:41.146+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
