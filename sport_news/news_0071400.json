Each member will submit an individual top 10, which we'll compile to get an average score and then publish our official FOX Four rankings from highest to lowest. Though this ranking puts special emphasis on the first four teams — our current playoff picks after the most recent week of the season — we'll list a full top 10 so you can see how the committee has prioritized the second batch of teams that could impact the playoff discussion. \nNumber of first-place votes will break ties. If two teams have the same number of first-place votes, we'll proceed to the subsequent place until the tie is broken. \nOur 13-member committee this week: Colin Cowherd, Bruce Feldman, Matt Leinart, Stewart Mandel, Joel Klatt, Tim Brando, Molly McGrath, Brady Quinn, Petros Papadakis, Rob Stone, Spencer Tillman, Clay Travis and Dave Wannstedt. \nAnd here is our FOX Four: \nFor a closer look at the voting, here's the Top 10, with the average ranking for each team in parentheses.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T23:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T23:49:14.530+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
