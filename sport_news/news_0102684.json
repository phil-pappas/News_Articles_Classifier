He left the post, along with Mansourâ€™s staff of advisors, when President Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi took office in June 2014.\nHeggy publicly stated in February 2014 that the \"claims by the Egyptian army that it has found a cure for Hepatitis C and HIV are a scientific scandal for Egypt,\" after physician and Major-General Ibrahim Abdel-Atti announced he had invented a device which treats HIV and Hepatitis C with 100 percent effectiveness.\nHe said that the devices are unconvincing and appear to have no clear scientific basis.\nHeggy was heavily criticised for his comments by local pro-regime media outlets. The alleged devices were never made available for public use in hospitals as Abdel-Atti had promised.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T09:34:04.678+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
