She was booked for her alleged involvement in a scam worth Rs 2.68 crore that has been unearthed in the pension cell of the university. She was arrested on September 21 and her police remand was extended thrice as the police said they had to find out more accused, recover the money and also question the accused on her involvement. The police also conducted raids on the hideouts of the co-accused in the case, including Pooja’s parents, brother-in-law and sister-in-law, in Himachal Pradesh yesterday but they were found to be absconding. Pooja, posted in the pension cell, playing on the fact that there was no double entry system in the checks and balances system, had diverted money amounting to crores to the bank accounts of her family members over the past three years. The money was being diverted into the accounts of Pooja’s family members. The FIR was registered on a complaint of PU Chief Security Officer Jitender Grover. The police said Pooja and co-accused Naresh Sabharwal were indicted in an internal probe conducted by the PU authorities. Panjab University has already recovered Rs 92 lakh.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T02:20:03.514+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
