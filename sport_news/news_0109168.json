But the fact that Florida nearly went into Death Valley and beat Miles’ team showed the Gators’ confidence and resilience during Year One under coach Jim McElwain. \nFlorida entered Saturday night with backup quarterback Treon Harris, failed to generate a running game (55 yards on 31 carries) and saw its vaunted secondary torched throughout the first half by much-maligned LSU sophomore Brandon Harris. \nOn top of it, LSU had the nation’s top player, tailback Leonard Fournette, on its side and a capacity crowd of 102,321 cheering the Tigers. \nYet, the Gators kept battling and erased leads of 21-7 and 28-14 to put a scare into the Tigers. \nMcElwain called it a “badge of honor” that Miles’ team needed a fake field goal to beat Florida. \nMcElwain did not claim a moral victory for the Gators, but he did see the kind of fight his players can build on. \n“We played hard against a really good football team,” McElwain said. “There could have been a lot of reasons for everybody, oh, these guys will fall apart. But no, we didn’t. And I didn’t expect we would.” UF STRUGGLES AGAINST GOOD RUNNING TEAMS \nThe two best running teams Florida has faced — Tennessee and LSU — had their way with the Gators. \nFournette finished with 180 yards and two touchdowns on a season-high 31 carries as the Tigers ran for 221 yards. He had to work for many of his yards. His 5.8 average per attempt was nearly three yards below his season average (8.6) entering the game. \nBut the Gators could not contain the 6-foot-1, 230-pound Fournette at critical times, including the game-winning drive, when he ran for 45 yards on six carries. \nTennessee’s rushing attack piled up 254 yards. \nWith Nick Chubb out for Georgia, the Gators will not have to face one of the nation’s top tailbacks. Backup Sony Michel is good, but he managed just 87 yards on 26 carries during the Bulldogs’ 9-6 snoozer against Missouri. \nFlorida State’s Dalvin Cook still awaits in the regular-season finale. The 6-foot, 203-pound Cook lacks the size of Fournette but is as explosive as any back in the nation. \nThe Gators need to find answers by then. CALLAWAY IS UF’S BEST PLAYMAKER IN YEARS \nThe search for a playmaker on the perimeter is over. Antonio Callaway single-handedly — and one-handedly — kept the Gators within striking distance of the Tigers. \nCallaway’s one-handed, 48-yard catch set up a 19-yard touchdown by tight end Jake McGee to cut LSU’s lead to 21-14. With Florida trailing 28-21, Callaway returned a punt 72 yards for a touchdown. \nCallaway — the hero against Tennessee — had the ball in his hands in the end zone with a chance to tie the game. But LSU defensive back Dwayne Thomas ripped the ball away. \nCallaway came up with a 41-yard catch on the final drive, but the Gators stalled, no fault of Callaway, who finished with 100 receiving yards on three catches.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T07:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T18:15:40.626+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
