Back | Next 2013 FILE PHOTO/THE ASSOCIATED PRESS Former UCLA quarterback T.J. Millweard (14) approached the Kansas staff, as opposed to being recruited by the Jayhawks, after deciding to transfer out of the Bruins' program. By Jesse Newell jesse.newell@cjonline.com \nLAWRENCE — If backup quarterback T.J. Millweard gets in Saturday’s game against Baylor, it will be a bit of a production. \nThe same thing happens whenever the Kansas junior has to go into the game as the team’s holder. It’s not easy to go from an offensive signal-caller to a player in a matter of a few seconds. \n“Whenever we do that, I just throw the headset over my head, and you’ll see a helmet come flying,” Millweard said. “I’ll catch it and go on the field. We’ve done it all year, and I’m not worried about it.” \nThings have become more complicated this week as Millweard, who hadn’t taken a practice rep at quarterback since the third day of fall camp, suddenly finds himself as the next in line behind freshman starter Ryan Willis following numerous KU injuries. \nMillweard is ready for whatever is needed of him. That’s been the case this year when he’s signaled play calls into KU’s receivers. He’s also given input when offensive coordinator Rob Likens has asked his opinion on certain scenarios. \nThe joke around the team is that Millweard is a GA (graduate assistant coach) with shoulder pads. \n“Somebody said it to me one day at practice, and I was like, ‘That’s funny,’” Millweard said. “So then everyone started spitting it out on me.” \nIt’s rare that a fifth-string quarterback has these types of credentials. \nMillweard was highly sought after in high school, saying he actually was offered by Baylor at one point before deciding on UCLA. He battled for the starting QB position there before transferring to KU in 2013. \nSince then, his role has been limited. He’s served as the team’s holder the last two seasons while attempting three 2014 pass attempts in garbage time. \nKU coach David Beaty still calls the Colleyville, Texas, native “as big a leader as we’ve got on our football team.” \n“He knows this offense as good as anybody,” Beaty said. “From a talent perspective, he may be just a little bit below the rest of those guys, but he’s been preparing for this moment as well, and he’s going to compete.” \nMillweard admits this week has been different for him. Other times, he’s been three or four injuries from getting into a game. This week, it’s just one. \nHe’s spent additional time looking over film, watching Baylor’s first four games before making plans to watch cut-ups of the team’s formations, blitzes and defensive calls on each down. \n“I haven’t been like this since, shoot, UCLA days. It seems like 25 years ago for me,” Millweard said. “I’m definitely excited. I think it’s a great opportunity here, but I’m here to support Ryan, and whatever Ryan needs, I’m here for him.” \nThere’s also the matter of getting ready physically. During Tuesday’s practice, Millweard didn’t even go through warmup stretches with the team, instead serving as the holder to help KU’s kickers get repetitions. \nMillweard said Monday’s practice was the first time he’d actually taken time to warm up his arm, as it’s something he usually just does between drills. \n“Obviously knocking some rust off,” Millweard said. “I know what I’m doing, but as we all say, I’ve got to get the old-man arm back up.” \nMillweard, who has aspirations of becoming a coach after college, might get some of those duties if he does become quarterback Saturday. \nDuring Monday’s practice, he was doing his normal signaling when Likens informed him he needed to go in to get some reps himself. When he did, assistant coach Klint Kubiak took his sideline role, though there was some confusion when players had to look to a different place for the play call. \nMillweard says the solution might be this: He might just have to signal to his own receivers while he’s on the field as well. \n“I don’t mind,” Millweard said with a smile. “I can handle it.” \nIt’s just another bit of production that will have to take place if the part-coach-part-player makes his way onto the field Saturday. \n“Trying to get back in the swing of things here,” Millweard said. “I’m excited for the opportunity.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T20:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T20:04:54.637+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
