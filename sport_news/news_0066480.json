With USA leading 21-15 in the third quarter, he picked off another pass while falling backward; the Jags were able to move down the field and convert a 33-yard field goal in the last minute of the period for the team's final points.It was the first time since a Sept. 14, 2013, win over Western Kentucky that a Jaguar has intercepted two passes in the same game.He's the second member of the program to receive the award — which is voted on by members of the media who cover the league — joining defensive back Jeremy Reaves, who was honored on Sept. 21.Jackson and the Jags are off until Tuesday, Oct. 13, when they will play host to Arkansas State in a contest that will be televised nationally on ESPN2. Kickoff is slated for 7 p.m. IF YOU HAVE A STORY IDEA CONTACT WLBT/WDBD AT (601) 960-4426 OR EMAIL US AT News@WLBT.COM .
