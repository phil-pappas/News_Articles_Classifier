Carolina's Greg Olsen scores the game winning touchdown in the... Many of the reporters and most of the cameras had already cleared out of the Seahawks locker room at CenturyLink Field, but there they were: members Seattle's vaunted Legion of Boom secondary, gathered around each other and trying to figure out what just happened.\nRichard Sherman and Kam Chancellor sat in adjacent lockers, while Earl Thomas, Cary Williams and DeShawn Shead stood around them. All but Sherman were still in uniform after most teammates had showered, changed and headed home. Thomas was talking animatedly, while Chancellor looked despairingly at the floor.\nIt wasn't hard to guess what they were talking about.\nMinutes earlier, Carolina Panthers quarterback Cam Newton threw a 26-yard touchdown pass to tight end Greg Olsen with 36 seconds remaining in the fourth quarter to put the Panthers ahead 27-23. That touchdown ended up handing the Hawks' their second straight heartbreaking loss -- and fourth defeat this season during which they held the lead entering the final frame.\nIt looked like there must have been a blown coverage on the game-deciding play, and that's exactly what happened, according to all involved.\n\"It just was confusion about what call we were in,\" Sherman said, surrounded by reporters in the postgame locker room. \"There were a couple calls being signaled in that were different, and the game's at a fast pace, so you've got to make a decision.\"\nThey made their decisions. Sherman made the right one, according to Thomas, while Thomas and Chancellor made the wrong one. The end result was a wide open Olsen streaking down the seam and into the end zone untouched in between Thomas, Sherman and their combined six All-Pro selections.\n\"We made a mistake on the calls,\" head coach Pete Carroll said after the game. \"Guys got confused on the signal. It was unfortunate, obviously, and they get an easy play.\"\n\"I think because Sherm was so close to the sideline, he got the correct call,\" Thomas said, \"but we didn't get it echoed to the whole defense, so we didn't get the job done.\"\nIt was deja vu for a Seahawks defense that allowed Cincinnati to get the job done against them a week earlier in a 27-24 overtime defeat after entering the fourth quarter up 24-7.\nNewton entered the fourth quarter Sunday with just 107 yards on 8-of-21 passing. But in the final frame he exploded for 162 yards, completing 12 of his 15 attempts, including the game-winner to Olsen.\nBoth Sherman and Thomas used the word \"fluky\" to describe the final play, but the Seahawks' play in the fourth quarter this season has been as consistent as it gets. Through six games, Seattle's been outscored 55-27 in the final 15 minutes, surrendering leads in each of their road games -- at St. Louis, at Green Bay and at Cincinnati -- and nearly giving up another one at home versus Detroit in Week 4.\nOn Sunday, the same things that plagued the Seahawks in those matchups came to bear once again. The Hawks converted just one of four third-down chances, committed a drive-killing penalty late in the contest and, perhaps most disturbingly, couldn't stop an opponent from moving the ball through the air.\nIn the past, Seattle's secondary has been the group that has come up with the game-clinching play, whether that's Sherman's tip in the 2014 NFC championship game or Chancellor's forced fumble on Calvin Johnson just two weeks ago.\nThe unit's close-knit nature always seemed to give it an advantage over its foes, particularly late in games. In fact, it was kind of eerie watching how beautifully Sherman, Chancellor and Thomas came together to play defense that was at once fluid and ferocious with the game on the line.\nBut in 2015, and even since Chancellor's return from a contract holdout in Week 3, the communication Seahawks fans are used to seeing on the field hasn't quite materialized. There's been more finger-pointing after big plays -- see last week's two touchdowns by the Bengals' Tyler Eifert in addition to Olsen's on Sunday -- and less of the kind of exuberant defending that characterized the Hawks' back-to-back Super Bowl seasons.\nAgainst Carolina, the Seattle secondary was victimized by Newton -- who had traditionally struggled versus the Seahawks -- and a passing attack that game into Sunday's game ranked No. 29 in the NFL at just 189.8 yards per game.\nIt was an outcome that had Thomas searching for the right words to describe what happened after the game.\n\"Right now, I want to say a lot of things, but I can't,\" Thomas said. \"I'm lost for words, bro. Man, this game's so beautiful, but it's so ugly.\"\nThe Hawks have a chance to crawl back into the playoff race on Sunday when they travel to San Francisco. But if they can't find a way to fix their breakdowns in the secondary and elsewhere, the 2015 season is bound to get even uglier.\nVisit seattlepi.com for more Seattle Seahawks news .
