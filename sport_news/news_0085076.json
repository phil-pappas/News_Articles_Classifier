The Clemson Tigers played host to the Boston College Eagles at Memorial Stadium in Clemson Saturday, October 17, 2015.GWINN DAVIS / FOR POST AND COURIER CLEMSON – Since the day he became an offensive coordinator for the first time in his life, Tony Elliott pledged to call his plays based on what the opposing defense was willing to yield. \nNEXT GAME \nWho: No. 5 Clemson (5-0, 2-0) at Miami (4-2, 1-1) \nWhen: Saturday, TBD \nWhere: Sun Life Stadium, Miami Gardens, Fla. \nTV: TBD \nLine: TBD Elliott, a James Island product, himself admitted the majority of Clemson’s first four games this season meant favoring the ground game. In studying Boston College, who’d allowed fewer yards than any defense nationally entering the weekend, Elliott made a decision. His wish was Tigers quarterback Deshaun Watson’s command: throw it deep, often and stubbornly. After numerous attempts to stretch the field hit the turf, Watson finally hooked up with Artavis Scott and Deon Cain for some explosive plays in No. 5 Clemson’s 34-17 victory over BC Saturday night in front of 81,416 fans at Memorial Stadium. Clemson (6-0, 3-0 ACC) clinched bowl eligibility, and has reached a 6-0 record for the third time in five years, joining 2011 and 2013. Watson finished with 452 total yards and four touchdowns – three passing, one rushing – against the top defense in the country. He completed 27-of-41 attempts – both tying or setting career highs – for 420 yards through the air, and added 32 yards on 11 carries. Scott stood out with 10 receptions for 162 yards, his highest total in an ACC game, and a 51-yard touchdown catch which ripped the lid off Boston College’s defense. Scott earlier had a 50-yard catch-and-run that set up Clemson’s first touchdown, a 4-yard run on third down by Watson. Cain, a true freshman, stood out in the fourth quarter with a 67-yard reception on 3rd-and-17 to put the game away. Tailback Wayne Gallman fell well short in his attempt for a fourth straight 100-yard game on the ground, tallying 48 yards on 17 carries. But Clemson outgained Boston College 532-246 in total yards. BC (3-4, 0-4), despite falling to its fourth loss in five games vs. Football Bowl Subdivision opponents, showed up under the lights as an 18-point underdog. True freshman quarterback Jeff Smith showed some moxie in his first career start, though he only completed 7-of-22 passes. Plus, BC’s offensive line, not been nearly as physical or experienced as in recent years, got more push on the Tigers’ defensive front than any of Clemson’s prior opponents. The Eagles ran for 159 yards, the second-highest total against the Tigers this year. All ten of the Eagles’ points were in response to Clemson’s pair of turnovers. The Eagles’ lone touchdown followed a Justin Simmons interception, when Watson floated a third-down deep ball into man coverage. Simmons, a converted safety who used to play cornerback, slid over and made the grab before adding a 28-yard return. BC’s ensuing touchdown drive was four plays for 20 yards, as Smith perfectly executed a playaction throw to fullback Bobby Wolford on third and goal for the score. Watson threw another third-down interception later, to linebacker Steven Daniels. A statistical quirk: Clemson improved to 13-15 in the Dabo Swinney era when losing the turnover margin, but the Tigers are 3-0 this season. In fact, Clemson was minus-2 in turnovers in victories of 39 points over Wofford, 19 points over Georgia Tech and 17 points over Boston College. Clemson has played five of its six games so far at home; it’s now preparing for three out of four games on the road, starting Saturday at Miami (4-2, 1-1.)
