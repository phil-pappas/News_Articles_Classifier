A woman who answered the phone at Advanced Ornamentals hung up on a reporter seeking comment.\nThe businesses, which share an address on French Prairie Road Northeast near St. Paul, together produce melons, vegetables, trees, flowering plants, bark dust, soils, sod compost, rock and gravel, according to their websites.\nThe lawsuit claims that Rojas went to work for the companies on Aug. 18, 2014, and was fired less than two months later.\nIn that time, Rojas alleges, the companies failed to post a required notice of agricultural workers' rights; limited workers' access to toilets, sanitary bathrooms and clean water; and failed to provide protective gear or adequate information about pesticides being sprayed nearby.\n\"We just unfortunately see this kind of exploitation and abuse of working conditions to be really common in agriculture and other low-wage work in the state of Oregon,\" said attorney Bonnie Allen-Sailer with the Northwest Workers' Justice Project , which brought the suit on Saturday on behalf of Rojas. \"So this is a small part in our fight to improve that.\"\n-- Bryan Denson\nbdenson@oregonian.com\n503-294-7614; @Bryan_Denson", "external_links": ["http://www.dol.gov/compliance/laws/comp-msawpa.htm", "http://www.advancedornamentals.com/", "http://www.manta.com/c/mm4lhmg/mc-kay-farms-enterprise", "https://twitter.com/Bryan_Denson", "http://nwjp.org/"], "published": "2015-10-14T01:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T06:10:57.377+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
