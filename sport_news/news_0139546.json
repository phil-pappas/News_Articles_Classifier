Plaintiffs in the case include the government of coastal St. Bernard Parish, adjacent to New Orleans.\nBraden ruled in a 2005 lawsuit that focused on the Mississippi River Gulf Outlet - a navigation channel built by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and blamed by many for flooding in St. Bernard and New Orleans' Lower 9th Ward.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
