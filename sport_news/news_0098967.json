The big news Monday: Chandler Seton Catholic and Phoenix St. Mary’s have appealed up from 3A to 4A, while Yuma Kofa, Tucson Rincon, Tucson Sunnyside, Yuma San Luis and Surprise Valley Vista have appealed down from 6A to 5A.\nHere's full list of conference appeals thus far: pic.twitter.com/zIwABDPDxk\n— scott bordow (@sbordow) October 19, 2015 Maybe there will be a last-minute rush Tuesday, but I think the relatively small number of appeals is because most athletic directors feel their appeals will be denied. There seems to be a sentiment among school officials to keep conferences approximately the same size and make up for any competitive inequalities by scheduling cross-conference games and games against teams of a similar level in-conference.\nAZCENTRAL\nBordow: Westwood's Johnson sets rushing record\nThe conferences will begin hearing appeals on Thursday morning.\nIn other news Monday, Division I basketball teams decided not to have sectional tournaments this year. There’s been some concern in the past that sectional games skewed the rankings too much. Also, by not having sectionals, teams can spread out their final few games, giving their players a few more days off than in the past.\nDivisions II, III, IV and V will decide section by section whether to hold sectional tournaments.\nFinally, Phoenix Alhambra had its two forfeits – caused by a failure to turn in the proper paperwork – rescinded by the AIA’s executive board.\nReach Bordow at scott.bordow@arizonarepublic.com or 602-448-8716.
