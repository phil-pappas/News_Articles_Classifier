The all important 22 yards were not to team India's liking who had asked for a spin friendly wicket to compliment their three spinners' strategy and India Today learns this was communicated by Team Director Ravi Shastri in the most crude fashion possible to the match curator Sudhir Naik in a post match face off. IndiaToday.in | Mumbai, October 26, 2015 | UPDATED 15:57 IST Mail A+ A- Ravi taunted Naik calling out loud \"Great wicket.. taak wicket\" in Marathi which translates to some unprintables. (Reuters Photo) \nAs it turned out, the flat surface at the Wankhede stadium in Mumbai was best utilised by South Africa in the series decider to register their first bilateral one-day international series win in India. The all important 22 yards were not to team India's liking who had asked for a spin friendly wicket to compliment their three spinners' strategy and India Today learns this was communicated by Team Director Ravi Shastri in the most crude fashion possible to the match curator Sudhir Naik in a post match face off. Sources privy to the incident have confirmed Ravi Shastri and Naik, a former India test cricketer himself came face to face when Naik was returning to his curator's cabin post match. Ravi taunted Naik calling out loud \"Great wicket.. taak wicket\" in Marathi which translates to some unprintables. Naik, feeling offended reminded Ravi that he too has been a Test cricketer and that he should not be giving him lessons on wicket preparations. \nAlso read: Ravi Shastri slams MCA over Wankhede wicket \nSuch verbal exchanges may be commonplace in Mumbai's maidan cricket circles. Only this time the spat wasn't just between two Mumbai bred ex players who went on to play for India but between the Indian Team Director and curator in charge of wicket at an international venue. It's learnt on a personal level, Naik did take the matter up with a senior MCA and BCCI official ?registering his displeasure over Ravi's remarks. MCA hasn't lodged any official complaint over Ravi's behaviour. But Naik who now works as a pitch consultant with the MCA and prepared the very well received wicket for the World Cup final of 2011 is said to be angry. A senior MCA official on condition of anonymity expressed their helplessness on altering the wicket to the team's request that came in too late. \"If we were informed a week in advance we could have prepared wicket accordingly. But one can't be told to keep the surface loose for spinners two days before the game. What if the wicket turned out to be poor,\" he said. Indian captain MS Dhoni without saying it in so many words did reiterate in the post match press conference that the wicket was too flat. This isn't the first occasion when an Indian team has been left dissatisfied by what they read as association's unwillingness to play ball to maximise the home advantage. It won't be the last. And clearly in Ravi's case, he lets it be known. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T13:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T14:08:33.851+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
