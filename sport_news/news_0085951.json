By KEVIN FISHBAIN kfishbain@chicagofootball.com \nLAKE FOREST – Bears left tackle Jermon Bushrod returned to practice Wednesday for the first time since suffering a concussion in the Week 2 loss to the Cardinals. \n“We’re taking it a day at a time,” Bushrod said about his availability for Sunday. “I was able to get out there, do some things today, I felt good, running around, taking some sets, putting my hands on people, just seeing how things are feeling. I’m encouraged right now, but we’re not going to push anything because I don’t really look forward to having any more setbacks.” \nBushrod, who was limited in practice, dealt with a back injury in the offseason and preseason and has a shoulder injury, too, but the concussion is what kept him on the sideline for three games. He did discuss the concern that comes with having a concussion. \n“At the end of the day, I know what I signed up for. No one’s pushing me to be out here. I want to be out here because I love this game,” he said. “I’ve been playing this game for 20 years. I love doing it. \n“… You have to really sit back and take care of yourself and realize that your brain and your head is nothing to play with. You just want to do everything you can to make sure that you’re healthy now and in the long-term as well.” \nAlshon Jeffery (hamstring) also participated in the portion open to the media but was limited. Josh Bellamy (groin), Patrick Omameh (ankle), Ego Ferguson (knee), Jeremiah Ratliff (ankle), Will Sutton (elbow) and Pernell McPhee (shoulder) were all limited. \nEddie Royal (ankle), Shea McClellin (knee), Terrance Mitchell (hamstring) and Antrel Rolle (ankle) did not practice. Royal and Rolle missed last week’s game, and McClellin was injured in Kansas City. \nJay Cutler was a full practice participant for the first time since Week 1. \nInside linebacker depth: The Bears brought undrafted rookie Jonathan Anderson up from the practice squad to give Vic Fangio more options at inside linebacker, assuming they have to replace McClellin for at least a game. \n“Right now, we’re sifting through that. We’ve got LaRoy. We’ve got Jonathan Anderson. We’ve got John Timu. We’ve got Lamin [Barrow]. So we’ll figure it out throughout the week,” Fangio said. “Maybe it’ll be one guy for one or maybe it’ll be a group effort.” \nReynolds, who played the first two games of this season for the Jaguars and joined the Bears before Week 4, was the one to replace McClellin in Sunday’s win . \nBig loss for Detroit: The Lions will be without outside linebacker DeAndre Levy certainly for Sunday and possibly the rest of the season. Their top tackler from a year ago will undergo surgery on his hip. Safety James Ihedigbo (quad) and defensive tackle Haloti Ngata (calf) did not practice. Eric Ebron (knee) was limited.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T08:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T12:11:48.630+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
