New York was 4 for 31 with runners in scoring position over the weekend, including 1 for 12 in the finale.\n\"You learn in baseball, to turn the page,\" first baseman Greg Bird said. \"If anything, it will be easier because now only one thing matters: the next game. It doesn't matter what we did for the last 162 games.\"\nAfter clinching a playoff berth on Thursday, New York needed just one win at Camden Yards to assure itself a game at Yankee Stadium on Tuesday. That victory never came, but that's partly because Girardi tried to balance the importance of winning against resting his starters and relievers.\nIt all worked out perfectly for the Yankees, anyway, as Arizona's 5-3 victory over Houston ended the Astros' bid to host on Tuesday. Had New York (87-75) and the Astros (86-76) finished tied, Houston would have won the tiebreaker for home field based on head-to-head record.\n\"It's nice that we're going home,\" Girardi said. \"The big thing is we're playing and we have a shot just like the other nine teams do.\"\nYankees starter Michael Pineda (12-10) lasted only 3 2-3 innings, allowing four runs and six hits. The right-hander has yielded a total of 11 runs in his last two outings.\nEight relievers followed, none of whom pitched more than an inning.\nMajor league home run leader Chris Davis connected twice for Baltimore, giving him 47 for the season. He also struck out for the 208th time, fifth-most in one season in big league history.\nPlaying perhaps his final game with the Orioles, Davis hit a two-run shot off Bryan Mitchell in the fifth and a two-run drive against Caleb Cotham in the eighth. The slugger will enter free agency coming off a season in which he drove in 117 runs.\n\"I was pretty fired up after I hit the first one. The second one, I felt like I was in shock running around the bases,\" Davis said.\nUnsure if it was the last time he watched Davis in a Baltimore uniform, Orioles manager Buck Showalter said, \"It's been fun to have a great seat to watch him. He's really established himself here in Baltimore. I felt very honored to be part of that. It's never goodbye, it's see you later.\"\nChris Tillman (11-11) gave up two runs and seven hits over 5 1-3 innings to level his lifetime record against New York at 6-6.\nThe sweep gave Baltimore a 10-9 record against New York this year. After going 13-6 last year, the Orioles have won successive season series against the Yankees for the first time since 1981-82.\nBaltimore finished 81-81 after winning the AL East last year with a 96-66 record. Although they missed the playoffs, the Orioles were in contention for a wild-card berth until the final week and closed with a five-game winning streak to avoid what would have been their first losing season since 2011.\nOrioles third baseman Manny Machado failed to homer in a fifth consecutive game but completed the season as the only player in the majors to participate in all 162 games.\nBaltimore went up 2-0 in the first inning when pending free agent Matt Wieters hit a two-run, two-out single.\nDoubles by Bird and Didi Gregorius got New York a run in the second before the Orioles chased Pineda with a three-run fourth.\nTRAINER'S ROOM\nOrioles: CF Adam Jones (back) and 2B Jonathan Schoop (hand) watched from the dugout, although manager Buck Showalter said, \"Both are capable of doing something for us today.\"\nON DECK\nYankees: New York will send right-hander Masahiro Tanaka (12-7, 3.51 ERA) to the mound on Tuesday.\nOrioles: Baltimore heads into an important offseason uncertain if this was the final game as Orioles for pending free agents Wieters, Davis, Darren O'Day and Wei-Yin Chen.\n1 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Copyright 2015 The Associated Press.
