He told Raman that they can avoid litigation on issues which can be solved through internal discussions as matters of board should be solved in the forum,\" a BCCI official present during the Special General Meeting said on condition of anonymity.\nManohar later came out and told media that current BCCI dispensation would not be \"vindictive\" towards any unit members including TNCA, headed by Srinivasan, amidst speculations about the Tamil Nadu strongman's future as ICC chairman. In fact Manohar did not answer any queries on those lines.\n\"The discussions started when Maharashtra CA chief Ajay Shirke straightaway questioned Kerala CA supremo TC Mathew as to how he could file an affidavit against Thakur in the PIL filed by Srinivasan. Even treasurer Aniruddh Chaudhary came in for some tough questioning from the members about his affidavit against Thakur,\" the member, who saw it all recollected the events of the short meeting.\nIt was learnt that many unit members did not even allow Chaudhary to speak, who tried to explain his stand as to why he filed an affidavit against Thakur in the perjury case.\n\"The treasurer (Chaudhary) had just started giving an explanation when people stopped him. The president then said that BCCI matters should be collectively sorted on the floor of the house. In fact, both Mathew and Chaudhary have been advised to withdraw their affidavits,\" the source said.\nThe case will be heard in the Supreme Court on Monday.\nMeanwhile, in a bid to avoid any conflict of interest, Manohar's son Adwait, who is a part of BCCI's legal cell, has resigned from the position.
