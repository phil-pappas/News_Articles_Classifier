(Stephen M. Dowell/Orlando Sentinel) (Stephen M. Dowell / Orlando Sentinel) Brendan Sonnone Contact Reporter Orlando Sentinel FSU coach Jimbo Fisher was stunned when hearing of Florida QB Will Grier's suspension. \nFSU’s Jimbo Fisher was stunned when he found out about the suspension of Florida quarterback Will Grier. \nThe coach was asked about Grier’s suspension of at least a year –because of taking performance-enhancing drugs – and what he does to make his players aware of PEDS during his news conference Monday afternoon. \n“Wow,” Fisher said as he shook his head. “We have constant drug education. We test our guys every week. Certain guys get tested, the NCAA comes in and does those tests, we know that. …Don’t take one thing and put in your body that you haven’t told us [about], shown us. We’ve got all the supplements, we’ve got the things that are legal. Trust us. \n“That’s a tragedy and I’m very sorry for them and him. It’s sad to hear.” \nFisher said he may talk to his players today about the incident to remind them of the possible pitfalls of taking supplements. \nNo. 11 FSU faces No. 8 Florida on Nov. 28 in Gainesville. \nEmail Brendan at bsonnone@orlandosentinel.com .
