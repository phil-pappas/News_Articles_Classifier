(Image Source: Scott Cunningham/Getty Images) \nHere’s a look at the Thursday Night Football matchup between the New Orleans Saints and the Atlanta Falcons: \nSeries: Falcons Lead 48-43; Streaks: Falcons won past 2; Saints won six of the past nine; Last Meeting: Falcons 30, Saints 14 (12.21.14) \nTime: 8:30 PM ET; TV: CBS (Jim Nantz, Phil Simms & Tracy Wolfson) \nSpread: Falcons -4; O/U 51 ½ \nInjury Report: Falcons: Out: LB Justin Durant (elbow), OG Mike Person (ankle); Probable: RB Devonta Freeman (toe), WR Leonard Hankerson (ribs), WR Julio Jones (toe/hamstring) \nSaints : Out: OG Tim Lelito (shoulder), P Thomas Morstead (right quadricep), CB Damian Swann (concussion); Doubtful: OT Terron Armstead (knee), WR Marques Colston (shoulder); Questionable: DE Bobby Richardson (hip); Probable: S Jairus Byrd (knee), OG Jahri Evans (knee), DT John Jenkins (elbow), CB Keenan Lewis (hip) \nWhere They Stand: The Atlanta Falcons may be the surprise team in the NFL. They are one of four clubs to start the season 5-0, including four fourth-quarter comebacks to remain undefeated. No team has ever started 5-0 and come from behind the in the final stanza four times before. The New Orleans Saints have trailed in the fourth quarter four times as well, however they have yet to overcome such a late deficit. At 1-4, they’re four games behind the first-place Falcons. \nThe Falcons: QB Matt Ryan has won four of his past five starts on Thursday night with 10 TD passes to no INTs for a rating of 110.7. Last season, the Falcons swept the Saints and Matty Ice shredded them for 770 yards (73.5 percent), four TDs, no INTs and a rating of 118. Ryan is blessed with one of the top two or three pass catchers in WR Julio Jones who leads the NFL with 43 receptions and he’s gone over 100 yards in his past two against the Saints. In the past nine games Jones is averaging 128.7 YPG. WR Roddy White has reached 100 yards three times in his past five on Thursday night with five scores. This season Atlanta is getting more production from the ground game and RB Devonta Freeman is the first player with seven rushing TDs in his first three career starts and he leads the league with eight scores. Atlanta’s pass D has allowed just six TDs through the air this season. CB Desmond Trufant , who had an INT the last time he played the Saints, leads the team with his 39 PDs since he was drafted in 2013. CB Robert Alford , had two INTs last week, including a game-winning 59-yard TD return in OT. They still aren’t generating much of a pass rusher, although OLB Vic Beasley is showing some promise, second among rookies with his 2 sacks. \nThe Saints: As a member of the Saints, QB Drew Brees has led the team to a 7-2 mark at home against the Falcons. Since he signed with New Orleans in 2006, Brees has thrown for 44,989 yards and 322 TD passes to lead the NFL. Last week a pair of young pass catchers from the Class of 2014 had their first career 100-yard game. Undrafted first-year man Willie Snead had 141 yards and former first-round pick Brandin Cooks put up 107 yards and a TD. The Falcons D of course can’t forget about veteran WR Marques Colston (if he suits up), who had 11 grabs for 190 yards in his past two against his division rival. RB Mark Ingram has picked up his production in the past two weeks and he has three rushing TDs in his past three on Thursday night, as well as three in his past two against Atlanta. Coming out of the backfield, the Heisman Trophy winner is second among backs with 24 receptions. Setting up their defense is DE Cameron Jordan , who has 12 sacks in his past 17 home games. The front seven is bolstered by the addition of rookie LB’s Hau’oli Kikaha and Stephone Anthony . Kikaha leads all rookies with his three sacks and Anthony is second on the club with 32 tackles. Another newcomer is CB Brandon Browner , who had his first INT with the Saints last week. \nPrediction: Every week I keep asking myself, are the Atlanta Falcons really this good? I’m still not sure they’re a legitimate Super Bowl contender, but they may very well be the class of the NFC South, something the New Orleans Saints use to be. Matt Ryan is in his prime, hitting his stride, while Drew Brees is on the other side of his career and he can no longer carry the offense to victories the way he once did. Atlanta’s run will end at some point but it won’t be in the Big Easy, as the Falcons become the first team to reach six wins this season in a squeaker. \nScore: Falcons 27, Saints 26 \nDaniel Mogollon is a member of the Pro Football Writers of America and the Football Writers Association of America.
