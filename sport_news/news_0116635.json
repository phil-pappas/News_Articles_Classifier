Riverside Plaza, according to Chicago Fire Department spokesman Jeff Lyle. Crews have built 24 of the 54 stories planned.\nThe decking fell to the ninth floor, Lyle said, adding that at the 12th floor, it picked up some concrete on its way down.\n“It took quite a bit of concrete down with it,” he said.\nFirefighters remained at the scene until about 6 p.m., searching the debris piles to confirm no one was trapped.\nThe city’s Department of Buildings was called to the scene.\nThe building is one of three high-rises sprouting up in River North. It will become the city’s 16th-tallest building once completed, according to the building’s website.\nThe building will house office space and a restaurant among other amenities. John O’Donnell is the developer, and Clark Construction is managing the project.\nPedestrians were blocked from the Randolph Street Bridge on the north side, and no cars were allowed on the bridge, which is a popular route to the Kennedy Expressway.\nA steady stream of onlookers watched as traffic was backed up on Randolph near Wacker.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T00:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T12:48:14.617+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
