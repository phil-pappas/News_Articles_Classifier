The NCAA exec, tall with a toothy grin, sticks out his hand. The thought is inescapable: This is Andrew Luck in 30 years Email Comment \nThe dad behind the quarterback, tall with a toothy grin, sticks out his hand and for a moment, the thought is inescapable: This is Andrew Luck in 30 years. \nHe’s standing at the head of a table inside a conference room at the NCAA’s glistening new national office, beginning a midsummer Monday morning waiting on a 10th intern (she’s running late), while nine others mask the awkward silence with awkward chatter. The meeting was supposed to start four minutes ago, but Oliver Luck isn’t fazed. He pours himself another cup of coffee. \nEnough. They begin, one intern short, with the customary who-you-are-and-where-you’re-from pleasantries. Luck listens intently as the NCAA’s newest crop of one-year interns, most of whom are former collegiate athletes, introduce themselves. For Luck it’s like a game of trivia. What does he know about their hometown? Their alma mater? Their alma mater’s conference? \nOne reveals he’s from New Orleans. Luck perks up. He has a question. \n“Do you know what the word lagniappe means?” \nIt's 8:35 on a Monday morning and Oliver Luck is quizzing an intern on New Orleans parlance. \n“Something extra?” comes the answer. Luck smiles. He nods. He explains. \n“A reporter asked me recently if the driving force behind me coming to Indianapolis was to hang out with my kid,” says the NCAA’s newly-hired vice president of regulatory affairs, whose kid – the Colts starting quarterback when he’s not nursing that sore shoulder – happens to be the most famous athlete in the state. “I said to him, ‘Nah, it’s just sort of lagniappe.’ He said, ‘What?’ I said, ‘You don’t know what lagniappe means? It’s sort of like the extra scoop of ice cream on top of your sundae. It’s like a bonus.’ \n“Lagniappe,” Luck continues, addressing the whole room. “ Great word. Remember that word.” \nThe interns hastily scribble in their notebooks. Lagniappe . \nAfter the lesson, the 10th intern arrives. They move on. Luck walks them through a CliffNotes account of NCAA history, sprinkling in statements like: “Amateurism is really just an outgrowth of late 19th century Britain.” This causes more scribbling in notebooks. \nLuck has been a campus hero, a professional athlete, a candidate for congress; he’s run pro teams in two different sports in two different countries; he’s built stadiums and directed an athletic department. But on this morning Andrew Luck’s dad sounds more like a history professor than anything else. \nAt one point he likens the state of his new employer to the Parthenon in Greece. \n“The columns have been chipped away,” Luck says. “It’s a time of transition, a time of change. It’s almost like there’s been a gunfight at the Acropolis.” \nLuck then refuses to tiptoe around the interns' rocky reality. The NCAA is an organization stuck in a strange duality: College sports are as popular as they’ve ever been in this country, yet the organization that governs them remains about as popular as Bill Belichick in an Indianapolis bar. Legal battles, notably the class action lawsuit filed by former UCLA basketball player Ed O’Bannon, continue to drag on in the courtroom. The war won’t end anytime soon. \n“We have more lawyers than you’d know what to do with,” Luck tells the interns. \nHis arrival represents headway. By luring Luck to town back in January the NCAA made a splash hire that earned it the rarest of triumphs – positive press. Luck and his Midas touch were coming to Indianapolis. The NCAA had its white knight. \nNFL quarterback Andrew Luck and his father Oliver Luck attend the White House Correspondents' Association Dinner at the Washington Hilton Hotel, Saturday, May 3, 2014, in Washington. (Photo: Evan Agostini, Evan Agostini/Invision/AP) \nBut Oliver Luck is not here simply because his son plays football down the street – that’s lagniappe, remember. There's work to do. He is a man who’s authored a stunning resume as a sort of meandering maestro of sports business. Need a league built? A franchise run? A stadium deal? Call Oliver Luck. It’s the credo he’s employed since, he says, he retired from the NFL and “became a suit.” Solve one problem, onto the next. Or as a former boss of Luck’s puts it, “Oliver is a guy who always wants more. He always wants the next challenge.” \nAnd what challenge out there could be bigger than this one? All Oliver Luck must do now is save the NCAA. \n*** \nLuck is not wrong in his metaphor. The NCAA’s Parthenon – the amateur model upon which the organization was founded in 1906 – is under siege. In recent years, football players from Northwestern attempted to unionize, citing “unjust NCAA rules.” The O’Bannon suit, first filed six years ago, is still under appeal and could land in the Supreme Court. Athletes want to be paid, they want health benefits, and they want to own rights to their own image and likeness. While the lawsuits are flying, the profits are staggering – the NCAA’s crown jewel, the men’s basketball tournament, raked in a cool $7.5 billion in advertising revenue over the last decade. \nStuck squarely in the middle of it: NCAA President Mark Emmert. The ideal he relentlessly defends, the one his organization is fighting for in the courts – the student-athlete ideal – feels more archaic with each passing season, each new billion-dollar television contract. \nMake no mistake: Their myth has been tarnished. \nAnd that’s where Luck comes in. If there’s one student-athlete story the NCAA wants told, it’s Oliver Luck’s. \n*** \nThis is a man who emails friends and colleagues articles from “The Economist” about why the German language “is hip again.” He spends his summer evenings biking down the Monon Trail. He swipes books from his son’s Downtown condo. “Sometimes you’re like, ‘Where did that one go?’” Andrew says, laughing. “Then you realize…” \nThe book on Oliver Luck’s bedside table at the moment is called: “Iron Curtain: The Crushing of Eastern Europe, 1944-1956.” It traces how Joseph Stalin’s Soviet machine spread its Communist muscle in countries like Poland, Hungary and East Germany after World War II. \n“Fascinating,” Luck calls it. \nHe was the brainy high school quarterback from Cleveland who turned down Harvard and Yale to see if he could make it at a big-time college football program; he left West Virginia a school icon after pulling the Mountaineers to their first victory in a bowl game in six years. He was a Rhodes Scholar finalist, a second-round draft pick of the Houston Oilers in 1982, a backup quarterback who stuck around the NFL for four seasons, mainly so he could qualify for the league pension. \nProfessional football was never the endgame for Oliver Luck. By his second season with the Oilers he was studying law at night and in the summers “simply because I was wasting time,” Luck says, as if it’s normal for an NFL quarterback to double as a law student. Soon he was the team’s unofficial clubhouse lawyer. Teammates would grab a seat next to him on flights and beg for legal advice. \nHe finished his law degree at the University of Texas, where he met his wife, Kathy. They moved to Germany for a yearlong fellowship for young lawyers, then returned and landed in Washington D.C., where their first son, Andrew, was born. Luck was working in the private sector, not three years after he retired from the NFL, when he took the next logical step: He ran for Congress. And he nearly won. A Republican candidate, Luck scored 44 percent of the vote in West Virginia’s second congressional district, but still fell to a four-time incumbent. \n“Thoroughly enjoyed it,” Luck says now. \nMere days after the election, the phone rang out of the blue – a common thread in Luck’s winding, serendipitous career. He traces his odyssey with a surprising sense of humility: He works, quietly and efficiently, refusing to rest on past triumphs or envision future stops. The opportunities simply arise, one after another, like dream jobs falling from the sky. All the while he keeps plugging along, fixed only on the challenge before him. That's Luck: Outwardly calm, innately driven. \nThat phone call was from the World League of American football, wanting to know if Luck would move to Frankfurt, Germany, to start a pro football team. Other than his German-born mother and his year overseas, Luck had no real qualifications, no background in business. He said sure. \nSo they packed up, 1-year-old Andrew in tow, figuring they’d stay a year or two. It ended up being 10. “Worked my way up the proverbial food chain to become president of NFL Europe,” Luck says, nonchalantly. They returned to the states in 2000 – by then Andrew had two younger sisters and a younger brother – and settled in Houston. Luck worked as the CEO of the Harris County-Houston Sports Authority, and by the time he left, his team had delivered the city three sparkling new sports venues: Minute Maid Park, Reliant Stadium (now NRG Stadium) and the Toyota Center. In between Luck landed the city a pro soccer team, became its president and general manager and watched the Houston Dynamo win MLS titles in each of its first two years of existence. \nSolve one problem, onto the next. \n“If you were moving a franchise to a new city, you couldn’t hire a better person than Oliver,” says J. Kent Friedman, who succeeded Luck as CEO of the Harris County-Houston Sports Authority. “He has a unique ability to walk into a room full of strangers and walk out with a bunch of new friends.” \nWest Virginia quarterback Oliver Luck (12) runs a keeper play for a first down in the Peach Bowl at the Atlanta Fulton County Stadium, Dec. 31, 1981.

He went home. \n“A rock star,” Luck’s former boss and WVU president, Jim Clements, calls him. “When I was looking for candidates, he checked every box and five boxes I didn’t even think of.” \nBack in Morgantown Luck pulled the Mountaineers out of the sinking, football-less Big East and into the booming Big 12. He secured financing for a new $25 million baseball facility. \nLast winter it was the NCAA that called. Emmert stressed the significance of the next handful of years for the organization, arguing it would forever shape the amateur athletic model in this country. Luck thought about it. He agreed. He took the job. \nEmmert wanted Luck’s services so badly he created a new position for him on his senior staff. The fancy title: vice president of regulatory affairs. Luck simplifies it as such: “It’s where the sausage gets made.” \nHe’s not Emmert’s No. 2 any more than he’s the NCAA’s president-in-waiting. He’s part of a seven-member senior executive team that reports to Emmert. Luck’s department deals directly with the membership – some 1,110 schools across three divisions that support some 460,000 student-athletes. \nSolve one problem, onto the next. \n*** \nIn Luck the NCAA earns a fresh set of eyes. In the past he was one of its many critics – “More Byzantine than the Byzantine Empire,” Luck said of the NCAA in a 2013 speech. He just happens to be the first of those critics they’ve gone out and hired. \nHe arrived in January and shortly thereafter made headlines. At a convention in Maryland, Luck shared an opinion that directly contradicts what the NCAA is defending in the O’Bannon suit. “I do believe that the name, image, likeness for an individual is a fundamental right,” he said. \nMonths later Luck, new job or not, holds firm in his stance. \n“This is not the NCAA speaking, it’s just me,” he cautions, “but I believe there’s a fundamental right that an individual has, not just as a student-athlete, to his image and likeness.” \nHe bases this, he says, “on watching college athletics the last 40 years, knowing what I went through, what my kids went through.” In addition to Andrew, a two-time All-American at Stanford, Luck has a daughter, Mary Ellen, who played volleyball at Stanford; his youngest son, Addison, will play soccer at Yale beginning next fall. \nThat’s not to say he’s not onboard. He believes in the NCAA, its ideals and its foundation, whether the Parthenon has been chipped or not. \n“We believe college athletics has a high value and we want to make sure all the schools are put in a position where they can run these teams, hire these coaches and prove all those values,” he says. “There has to be a system in place to do that.” \nOliver Luck, father of Andrew Luck shown back in his football days, is the NCAA executive vice president of regulatory affairs who reports directly to NCAA president Mark Emmert. (Photo: Matt Detrich/The Star) \nAll the while the definition of amateurism is changing. Luck knows it. In June the NCAA announced it would distribute $18.9 million to Division 1 schools primarily to cover cost-of-attendance-based scholarships, the idea being star football or basketball players will no longer be forced to scrape for a sandwich when they’re hungry. “We’ve redefined, effectively, the scholarship and what it means,” Luck says. “No more is it just room, board, tuition and fees.” \nThis is where Luck’s department comes in. A liaison between the NCAA and the schools, his job is to give the athletic departments whatever they require. Implementing these redefined scholarships is not a simple task. “Things can get a little messy on campus,” Luck says. “It’s not all that clean.” \nThus he’s been busy. Shortly after taking the job Luck reached out to iconic shoe marketer Sonny Vaccarro, a longtime critic of the NCAA who has been instrumental in the O’Bannon lawsuit. Luck wanted to pick his brain. Last month, in a speech to athletic directors, Luck made it clear that any student-athlete caught betting on college sports – namely on fantasy sites FanDuel and Draft Kings – would immediately forfeit a year of eligibility. \nHe’s working the way he always does – quietly, efficiently, below the surface – to put his stamp on the NCAA. \n“What annoys me?” he says. “People that aren’t willing to look at change or look at improvement. This happens in groups fairly often. People say, ‘Well, this is the way we’ve always done it.’ It’s not to say that was bad at all. But a responsible adult should be able to say, ‘Let’s just think about what it could be like if we do X, Y or Z.” \nHe knows implementing X, Y or Z inside the stubborn walls of the NCAA won’t be easy. But neither was running a pro football team in Europe. Or getting three stadiums built in Houston. Or saving West Virginia’s athletic department. \nWhat if Luck’s Midas touch isn’t enough? What if the lawsuits pile up, the courts rule against the NCAA and the amateur model on which they’ve constructed their billion-dollar enterprise starts to crack? \nWhat if it fails? \nHe smiles. Oliver Luck doesn’t know failure. \n“Not an option,” he says. \n*** \nAnd then there’s lagniappe. \nFor the first time since Andrew’s senior year of high school, he and his father live in the same city. They bike together down the Monon and discuss what books they’re reading. Football? It hardly ever comes up. \n“My theory is he gets enough of that at work,” says Oliver, likely the first former NFL quarterback to ever to say that about his star quarterback son. \nEx-Houston Oiler backup quarterback Oliver Luck, with his son, Andrew Luck, quarterback for Stratford High School before a playoff game against Cypress Falls at Reliant Stadium, Saturday, Nov. 25, 2006. (Photo: Johnny Hanson, For the Houston Chronicle) \nThey started out like any father and son, tossing the football in the backyard. Except their backyard was in Frankfurt, then London. Oliver never pushed Andrew into football – his first love was soccer – but when they returned to the states and Andrew told him he wanted to give the Pop Warner youth league a try, dad said sure. He’d even coach the team. \nOne of his first moves? Putting his son at defensive end. \n“I think he treated me a little harsher (than the rest of the kids),” Andrew says now. “Which is probably normal for a dad to do.” \nBut as soon as Andrew joined the school’s football team, dad backed off. Hard as it was, he watched from the stands, not the sideline. On car rides home from games, he’d bite his lip. \n“He never wanted to muddy that line,” Andrew says. “It can be tough on a kid if you do that. I appreciate that now.” \nEven without dad’s advice, Andrew became a prodigy, a Heisman Trophy finalist, the No. 1 overall pick in the NFL Draft and the quarterback tasked with replacing Peyton Manning in Indianapolis. He wasn’t all that surprised when his dad decided to tackle his new post at the NCAA. \n“He’s curious. He enjoys problems and enjoys solving them. I’d like to think, with his background he can bring a perspective that’s maybe a little different than your typical amateur administrator.” \nThat perspective – that’s what the interns are after. The Monday morning meeting is winding down. The brainy quarterback from Cleveland who has traveled the globe, built stadiums and leagues and franchises, is asked for career advice. \nWhat’s the secret? \nLuck pauses. He thinks for a moment, about all those phone calls, about his winding road, about his new challenge at the NCAA. Then he shares one of his favorite metaphors. \n“Act like a duck,” he tells them. “Be calm on the surface, but paddle like hell underneath. \n“It’s a great way to picture it, isn’t it?” \nThe interns nod. Then they start scribbling in their notebooks. \nCall Star reporter Zak Keefer at (317) 444-6134 and follow him on Twitter: @zkeefer.
