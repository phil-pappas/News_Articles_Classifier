Carolina 31-17 in 2015 NFL Playoffs \nCHARLOTTE, N.C. – The Carolina Panthers hit the road for the biggest challenge thus far of the 2015 season, as they take on the Seattle Seahawks at CenturyLink Field Sunday. \nThe Panthers are one of just five undefeated teams in the NFL after Atlanta suffered their first loss Thursday night at NFC South rival New Orleans. Carolina has an opportunity to take retain sole possession of first place in the division with a victory, as well as a chance to hinder the Seahawks' playoff chances. By the numbers: Panthers vs Seahawks \nSeattle comes into Sunday's contest at 2-3, with two of those losses coming against unbeaten teams, at Green Bay and last week at Cincinnati. If the Panthers want to make it three straight losses to unbeaten teams, they'll have to do something they've never done before. Win in Seattle. The Panthers have struggled against the defenders of the Pacific Northwest, holding just a 2-7 record all-time against Seattle, with four of those losses taking place on the road. \nPanthers fans have made a lot of noise over the last couple of weeks, as the team has yet to receive enough credit for their 4-0 record. With many pundits ranking the Panthers behind a sub-.500 team in Seattle, Sunday will be an opportunity for Carolina to silence the critics against a team who's had their number of late. Seattle's defeated Carolina four times over the last three seasons. \nQuarterback Cam Newton has said the right things this week, assuring Panthers fans that the teams' history will have no bearing on this week's matchup. \n\"We're not dwelling on the past,\" Newton said Wednesday. \"It's a different season with different teams. We're just focusing on things we do in practice, just working to win a football game.\" \nIt will be important for Newton to put the past behind him. Against Seattle in the divisional playoffs, Newton threw a 90-yard interception to Kam Chancellor that was returned for a touchdown, essentially ending Carolina's season. \nBoth teams put an emphasis on running the ball first offensively. Seattle has rushed for 100 yards in a league-leading 16 straight games. Carolina is hot on their heels, hitting the century mark on the ground 15 consecutive games, which is a franchise record. Seattle and Carolina are masters at stopping the run, with both teams ranking in the top 10 for yards allowed per carry. Seattle surrenders just 3.5 yards per carry, with the Panthers giving up 3.8 yards per rush.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T00:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T00:47:35.293+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
