(WHAS11) – In case Big Blue Nation needed any more reasons to be rabid for college hoops to start this weekend may have sent the fan base over the edge. \nBetween \"Big Blue Madness\" on Friday night, and then Saturday night's NBA preseason game featuring a bunch of ex-Cats, it's been a huge weekend at Rupp Arena. \nThe best explanation of the weekend came from New Orleans head coach Alvin Gentry, who knows what it's like to be a part of blue-blood college basketball. Gentry was an assistant at the University of Kansas under Larry Brown and a coach on that 1988 national title team. \nAfter the preseason game between his Pelicans and the Sacramento Kings, Gentry said, \"I was at Kansas. Great program. This place is Kansas on steroids.\" \nGentry's star player on the Pelicans roster, former UK stand out Anthony Davis, said he tried to explain to his coach what they were walking into at Rupp Arena on Saturday night. \n\"We could be playing Transylvania, whoever – some two year olds,\" Davis said with a smile. \n\"I mean they are going to sell out every time.\" \n\"I think what Cal has done here has been amazing,\" Gentry said. \"There's a culture that he's established that if I'm a high school player and he's recruiting me, there's no question where I'm going.\" \nThe UK alums enjoyed their entire weekend being engulfed in Big Blue. Many of them took in the \"Madness\" on Friday night and then enjoyed a jam packed Rupp Arena on Saturday when they took the court themselves. \n\"All they have here is Kentucky basketball and they definitely enjoy it,\" Davis said. \"Any time they get a chance to watch, whether it's an alum or the current Kentucky team play they are definitely going to come out.\" \n\"Loyalty, man. Fans are so loyal to UK players,\" said Willie Cauley-Stein, a member of last year's UK team and currently with the Sacramento Kings. \"It's not like a surprise that they are out here.\" \nGentry walked out of Rupp Arena Saturday night with a preseason win over the Kings, and a new perspective on college basketball fandom. \n\"Like I said if I'm a high school player it would be hard for me not to come here. And Cal, you owe me a lot of money for that. That's a great recruiting thing okay?\" Gentry said.
