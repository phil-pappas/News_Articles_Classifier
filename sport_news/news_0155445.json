The Flyers have not lost to the Blackhawks in Philly during the regular season since Nov. 9, 1996. \nThe Blackhawks beat the Flyers in the 2010 Stanley Cup Final and clinched with a Game 6 win in Philly. \nFilling in for Steve Mason, Neuvirth was sensational in his ninth career shutout. Mason missed a second straight game because of unspecified family reasons and there was no word when he would return. \nSENATORS 7, BLUE JACKETS 3 \nCOLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) — Bobby Ryan and Mika Zibanejad each had a goal and two assists, Erik Karlsson added a career-high four assists, and Ottawa improved to 3-0-0 on the road for the first time since the start of the 2007-08 season. \nKyle Turris had a goal and an assist, and Marc Methot, Milan Michalek, Jean-Gabriel Pageau and Mike Hoffman also scored for the Senators. Ryan Stone had two assists and Craig Anderson made 37 saves. \nBrandon Saad, Boone Jenner and Brandon Dubinsky scored for Columbus and Ryan Johansen had two assists. The Blue Jackets have dropped their first four games in regulation for the first time in the franchise's 15-year history. \nFormer Vezina Trophy winner Sergei Bobrovsky came in with a 4.65 goals-against-average and was shaky from the start, finishing with just 21 saves. ﻿", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T06:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T07:09:06.585+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
