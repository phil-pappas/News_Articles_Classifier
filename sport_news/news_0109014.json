James was issued a red card on the second interference call and will miss the Spartans' first-round playoff match Thursday, Oct. 29.Leading 2-0 at halftime, the Cougars' Katie Farnsworth scored an insurance goal in the 70th minute on an assist from Shelton. The tally came some 13 minutes after Chino goalie Giselle Chinchilla made a thrilling save on a Northland Prep penalty kick.Chino Valley likely won't learn until noon Saturday, Oct. 24, what seed it will receive into the eight-team D-V state championship tournament. The tourney's top four seeds host a first-round playoff match at 6 p.m. Thursday, Oct. 29.If the Cougars and the Spartans stay put in the rankings, Chino would host Northland Prep in the state playoff opener. It would be the fourth meeting of the season between the teams, as Chino has a 2-1 record vs. the Spartans.If Chino moves up to the No. 3 seed, coach Allen Foster said it's likely that the Cougars would host No. 6-ranked Desert Christian. In the process, they would avoid being in the top half of the bracket with top-seeded and three-time defending state champion Blue Ridge.
