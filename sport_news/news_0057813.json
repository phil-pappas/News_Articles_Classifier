He made the vaunted Seahawks’ “Legion of Boom” secondary instantly whole again and instantly spectacular in a 26-0 win over the Bears. Chicago quarterback Jimmy Clausen, in for hamstring-hurting Jay Cutler, was 9-for-17 for 63 yards. Yes, 63 yards. Boom!\nSkittles down\nPerennial Pro Bowl running back Marshawn Lynch left last week’s game against the Bears with a hamstring injury in the third quarter. Lynch got on the field late, arriving on the sideline with 7:40 left in the first quarter. Lynch will miss tonight’s game with that injury. But he was hardly missed last week, when rookie Thomas Rawls (U-M, Central Michigan) got the start and gained a game-high 104 yards on 16 carries.\nLions-Seahawks scouting report, prediction Mr. Wilson\nQuarterback Russell Wilson hasn’t done anything amazing in the early part of the season, but he has given Seattle a chance to win every week, even in close road losses. He had his best game last week, going 20-for-30 for 235 yards, one touchdown and no interceptions, and adding six carries for 28 yards. Wilson did a better job of finally keying on tight end Jimmy Graham, who caught a season-best seven passes for 83 yards.\nCliff notes\nCould be time for a little payback for former Lions defensive end Cliff Avril, who just happens to be on a tear this season. Entering Week 3, Profootballfocus.com had rated him as the top 4-3 defensive end with 10 quarterback hurries (first in the NFL) and four QB hits (second). PFF noted that Avril has rushed almost exclusively from the left side, which means he would be matched up against the Lions’ right tackle, either Cornelius Lucas or LaAdrian Waddle. Against Chicago, Avril had three combined tackles, a sack, two QB hits and a pass defended. Looks like the ball is in your court, Cliff.\nIt goes to 11 ... and beyond\nForget about 11. The volume on this one goes to 12. The Seahawks’ home, CenturyLink Field, isn’t just loud. It’s deafening. And don’t take our word for it. In a game against the rival San Francisco 49ers in 2013, CenturyLink set a Guinness World Record for crowd noise when levels reached 131.9 decibels. That’s louder than a typical 130-decibel Boeing 747. According to a Sports Illustrated article, the secret to the noise at the open-air stadium is the parabola shape of the curved roof, which covers 70% of the seats and deflects noise back into the stadium.\nContact Carlos Monarrez: cmonarrez@freepress.com.
