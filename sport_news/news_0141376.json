Or maybe you’re thinking it was the 16-3 loss to Louisiana in the New Orleans Bowl. \nBut it wasn’t either of those games. It was a 45-38 overtime loss to Air Force the week before the Fresno State game. It was that defeat that took the spirit out of Nevada and wrecked the end of the season. \n“We let Air Force beat us twice,” Wolf Pack coach Brian Polian said. “There’s no doubt in my mind. When we got ready to play Fresno, we physically and emotionally could not bounce back from that overtime loss up at Air Force and watching your teammate lying there prone on the field having to be stretchered off. We couldn’t bounce back from it. We have to be damn sure that doesn’t happen again.” Polian: Desire not a problem in UNLV loss \nAfter failing to bounce back after last year’s loss to Air Force, the Wolf Pack is in a similar situation this week as it tries to rebound from a 23-17 loss to rival UNLV, a bitter defeat that could derail the season. \nNevada has two options moving forward as it hosts New Mexico at 4 p.m. Saturday: It can wallow in self-pity and play the woe-is-us card or it can bury that loss by beating the Lobos and moving forward to accomplish the goals it set at the beginning of the year: to win a West Division title and a bowl game. \n“We have a lot of football left,” Polian said. “We can’t let UNLV beat us twice. We have to identify the healthy bodies, get the injured guys back as quickly as we can and get back to work because there’s a lot of football left. That’s what we have to do. That is what the resilient people do. There’s a difference between pain and suffering. We’re in pain now. We can’t allow ourselves to suffer.” \nSo, it’s up to the same group of players to do something it didn’t do last year post-Air Force loss: Bury a tough loss, right the ship and make sure its season doesn’t sink because of one demoralizing defeat. Polian has brought up the Air Force hangover to his team and has challenged his players to move on. \n“Just keep talking about resiliency,” Polian said. “If losing to UNLV is the worst thing that ever happens to us, we’ve got a pretty blessed life. In life, everybody suffers disappointment, everybody suffers through adversity. It’s not a matter of if. It’s a matter of when. This week is a microcosm of real life. It didn’t go our way. It’s awful. It stinks. But we have to be resilient and we have to bounce back.” \nIn ordinary years, playing New Mexico the week after a tough loss would be a blessing. Not so much this year as the Lobos already have three wins (it had four all of last year) and average 290 rushing yards per game, which is ninth in the nation. After being outscored by an average of 8.2 points per game last season, the Lobos have a plus-8.2-point advantage this season. This is a much improved team. \nFor many fans, the UNLV loss spoiled the entire season, but the Wolf Pack players can’t think that way. \n“We really can’t let one game or one loss define our season, especially this early in the season,” said linebacker Jordan Dobrich, a team captain for the third straight season. “This is more than an average conference game. We looked at it like that. We definitely understand the gravity of the loss. This one will hurt a little more than a standard loss but it won’t define our season.” \nAnother captain, running back Don Jackson, said the team has to preach positivity. The senior said “the noise outside is going to be ridiculous.” Some fans might have lost faith. Some might give up on the season. But Jackson remains confident in the potential and promise of his team. He said the West Division lacks a powerhouse and remains wide open and he knows his team will continue to battle. \n“I know everything we’ve been through,” said Jackson. “We had the hardest offseason I’ve ever had in my life. I know how close this team is, how tight this team is and I’m 100 percent confident we’re not going to let this one loss tear us down. Nobody is pointing fingers. It’s, ‘I love you man, let’s get back to work tomorrow.’ That’s what it has to be for us to be successful.” \nDefensive end Lenny Jones said the only way to put the UNLV loss behind it is to taste victory again. Jones said if Nevada allows the UNLV loss to control the rest of the season it will end up “a 2-10 football team.” The quicker the Wolf Pack bounces back the better. If it doesn’t back bounce this week, it could be a long two months as Nevada has seven games remaining on the schedule. \n“We can’t let one loss ruin the season,” said Jones, a team captain. “This one hurts a little bit more but a loss is a loss. If you let this one turn into another one and turn into another one you’re not winning a conference championship or getting to a bowl game. If we let this one take us down for two more games, we’re not the team we thought we were.” \nColumnist Chris Murray provides insight on Northern Nevada sports.
