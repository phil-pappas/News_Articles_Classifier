He said Sukhbir was the Home Minister and Sumedh Saini was his personal choice. “Sukhbir must also resign as the president of the Akali Dal as the issues involved are multi-layered and are far from being resolved,” he said. He alleged it was intelligence failure coupled with that of the investigating agencies after a “bir” of Guru Granth Sahib was stolen from Burj Jawaharsinghwala village on June 1. Its torn pages were found scattered in the nearby Bargari village a few days ago that led to major unrest in the state. He said the Congress’ stand had been vindicated that the entire episode was engineered by the state agencies. He described the death of two persons in unprovoked police firing at Behbal Kalan village as “a cold-blooded murder”. Dy CM should quit: Manpreet People’s Party of Punjab chief Manpreet Badal on Sunday asked Deputy Chief Minister Sukhbir Badal to step down after admitting to police failure to contain the deteriorating situation in the state as was evident from the replacement of DGP Sumedh Singh Saini by Suresh Arora. He claimed it was not a routine police reshuffle and the change had been ordered at a time when the state was passing through turbulent times. He said Sukhbir happened to be the Home Minister and as such, he should own the moral responsibility rather than putting the blame on Saini who was his blue-eyed boy.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T06:14:26.248+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
