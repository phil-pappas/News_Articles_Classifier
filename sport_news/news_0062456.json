The SAFETY MUFFS ensures that both ear and eye safety wear are easily accessible. In doing so, it provides added protection and comfort. It also improves worker safety. The invention features a dual-function design that is convenient and easy to use so it is ideal for use by industrial workers, trades people, construction laborers, maintenance personnel, landscapers and do-it-yourselfers. Additionally, the SAFETY MUFFS is producible in design variations and a prototype is available.\nThe inventor, from Noblesville, Ind., described his inspiration for the invention. “I have to wear safety glasses and earmuffs for work but I find it inconvenient to wear them both at the same time. I thought there needed to be a more comfortable design, so I created my prototype.”\nThe original design was submitted to the Indianapolis office of InventHelp. It is currently available for licensing or sale to manufacturers or marketers.
