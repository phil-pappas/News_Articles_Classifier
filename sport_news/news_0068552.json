She has become one of the top players in our league through hard work and effort.“But, as with any award, Maddie's success is also a result of the team working together towards one goal as a group.” \nIn the Seahawks' win over Townson on Sunday, McCormick posted the sixth hat trick in school history by scoring three goals while contributing an assist in the first half. \nThis was the second hat trick of her career, the first being against Towson in 2012 \nUNCW is tied for first place with Hofstra in the CAA standings and closes out the regular season on Sunday by hosting the College of Charleston at 1 p.m. \nCopyright 2015 WECT.
