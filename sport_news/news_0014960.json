Michael Eakin, who this week apologized for, as he delicately put it, \"insensitive\" emails detailed in the Daily News and turned over to the court and Judicial Conduct Board. Last year, Kane's first round of pornography purges forced the resignation of Justice Seamus McCaffery, but Eakin was mysteriously cleared by the high court and the conduct board. The latest revelations suggest not only that Eakin owes the public more than an apology, but that the court, the conduct board, the attorney general, and the justice himself fell far short of their responsibilities in the botched initial investigation.\nOutgoing Chief Justice Ronald Castille was clearly focused on the richly deserved jettisoning of his nemesis McCaffery from the court, probably to the detriment of a thorough investigation of all those implicated. Meanwhile, the Judicial Conduct Board, which the voters designated for the task through the state constitution, has been slow to dispose of urgent cases and repeatedly usurped by the Supreme Court. And Kane has been so selective, inconsistent, and disingenuous in releasing the emails as to have lost all credibility.\nAccording to the Daily News, Eakin was one of several officials who exchanged pornographic, racist, and misogynist emails such as a \"joke\" about a battered woman who learns to keep her \"mouth shut.\" While Eakin used a personal account to relay that and other messages under the pseudonym \"John Smith,\" his interlocutors reportedly included the likes of Senior Deputy Attorney General Jeffrey Baxter - hence the emails' presence on the attorney general's servers. Despite Kane's ostensible crusade against such communications, Baxter continues to hold a ranking position in her office and was prominently mentioned in one of its recent press releases.\nAs for Eakin, many of the emails disclosed, beyond being repugnant and stupid, likely run afoul of the Code of Judicial Conduct's proscription of expressions of bias and of ex parte communications with attorneys. They certainly don't reflect the dignity and impartiality the public expects of its judges, much less those of the state's highest court.\nGiven the documented failures of the state's existing authorities, an independent special prosecutor or task force must be appointed to conduct a thorough investigation, provide a full public accounting of inappropriate official communications, and recommend consequences for all those involved. Without such a reckoning, this scandal will continue to be as indelible as an incriminating email.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T04:34:28.544+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
