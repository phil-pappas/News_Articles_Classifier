(Photo: Troy Babbitt-USA TODAY Sports) \nEach week this college football season, I’ll offer my betting picks for every Mountain West game. I’ll keep myself honest by tracking my win-loss total, both straight up and against the spread. \nSaturday games \n* Wyoming at Appalachian State (-25): Wyoming is a 25-point underdog against a team that moved to the FBS last year. I might be under-thinking this, but if Wyoming can stay within 17 of a Pac-12 team (Washington State), it can stay within 25 here. The pick: App State 35, Wyoming 20. ATS pick: Wyoming \n* Hawaii at Boise State (-25): Boise State played great against Virginia. If it plays like that again, this will be a blowout. Hawaii has already faced Ohio State and Wisconsin, so it won’t be afraid of Boise State, but can it score? The pick: Boise State 35, Hawaii 12. ATS pick: Hawaii What the Fremont Cannon means to Wolf Pack \n* Air Force at Navy (-6): Navy is off to a great start this season, posting a 3-0 record with two solid wins. Air Force won this game last season but Navy has won nine of the last 12 matchups. Nine of those games have been decided by a touchdown or less. The pick: Navy 27, Air Force 20. ATS pick: Navy \n* New Mexico State at New Mexico (-13): In what is likely the greatest rivalry in college sports, New Mexico takes on NMSU in the Rio Grande Rivalry. The Aggies are winless this season and their defense is horrible. New Mexico runs wild in a big win. The pick: New Mexico 40, NMSU 24. ATS pick: New Mexico \n* San Jose State at Auburn (-20): I’m not saying SJSU is going to upset Auburn, but I wouldn’t be shocked to see it happen. As such, the 20-point line is too high for me. Auburn just isn’t that good. SJSU should keep this one close enough to cover. The pick: Auburn 37, SJSU 21. ATS pick: SJSU \n* Colorado State at Utah State (-4): Utah State lost starting QB Chuckie Keeton, but his backup, Kent Myers, played well last year. Utah State has the home-field advantage, the better defense and is used to playing without Keeton over the years. The pick: Utah State 24, Colorado State 17. ATS pick: Utah State \n* UNLV at Nevada (-6.5): This line opened at nearly twice the point total in Nevada’s favor (-12), but has been bet down to a touchdown. Either bettors are putting too much stock into UNLV’s 80-8 win over the FCS team Idaho State or this will be a close one. The pick: Nevada 28, UNLV 24. ATS pick: UNLV \n* Fresno State at San Diego State (-8.5): Both of these teams, picked to finish first and second in the MW’s West Division, have struggled this season. Bulldogs QB Zack Greenlee is back after a one-game suspension, but he can’t save Fresno State. The pick: SDSU 30, Fresno State 20. ATS pick: SDSU \nSeason records \nStraight up: 36-7 (last week 8-0) \nAgainst the spread: 17-15 (last week 5-3) Read or Share this story: http://on.rgj.com/1Rl7NBR TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T02:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T03:52:17.064+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
