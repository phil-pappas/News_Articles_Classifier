He's got a great arm, he's got great stuff – whatever you want to call it.\n“But there's something different about him too. And I expect if anybody can rise to the occasion it would be him.”\nIn a series that has yet to go to script – the Rangers winning Games 1 and 2 here last week before the Jays bats caught fire in the Texas heat on the long weekend – it comes down to one game to advance to the American League Championship Series.\nStroman has lived up to all of his potential in his four starts since returning from surgery on his left knee.\n“I get the chills just even thinking of being in the position that I am now, just coming from where I came,” Stroman said Tuesday. “I'm excited to out and compete with my brothers and have some fun.\n“I would say I'm confident. Some people may call it cocky. It's something that my dad kind of raised me with, a huge chip on my shoulder.\n“I'm not scared to say that I'm extremely confident.”\nThe Jays are hoping the offensive attack that re-surfaced for Games 3 and 4 in Arlington, Texas will continue to boom on Wednesday. The Texans will go with left-hander Cole Hamels, who faced Stroman in Game 2, allowing six hits going seven innings of the 14-inning marathon.\nGibbons is also hoping the team will rediscover the home-field dominance it showed for most of August and September. Including the two losses in this series, the Jays are 6-5 in their past 11 at the Rogers Center.\n“We've always been good at home,” Gibbons said. “We didn't win the first two, but we always expect to win here.”\nSo does Stroman, who posted a 4-0 record with a 1.67 ERA in those four regular-season starts, two at home and two on the road.\n“I enjoy the pressure, I enjoy the spotlight,” Stroman said. “This is a big stage and I'm just excited to be out there. This is an unbelievable moment and an unbelievable time for the city.”\nThat confidence has spread to his Jays teammates, many of whom, like Gibbons admired that confidence but felt there was no chance he would be on the mound for such an important game.\n“It's inspiring,” Jays fielder Dalton Pompey said. \"A lot of people counted him out and now he's starting Game 5, the biggest game for this team in recent memory. I know he's going to do great things (Wednesday) as well.\n“I'm sure a lot of guys would have Marcus Stroman on the mound in this game and Game 7 of the World Series. Everybody just believes in him that much.”\nrob.longley@sunmedia.ca\ntwitter.com/longleysunsport\n( Click here for a mobile-friendly link to Tuesday's coverage.)\nJays' Stroman on Game 5: 'I'm extremely confident'\nBy Rob Longley , Toronto Sun First posted: Tuesday, October 13, 2015 03:11 PM EDT | Updated: Tuesday, October 13, 2015 05:05 PM EDT\nBlue Jays manager John Gibbons appreciates the magnitude of the moment that awaits Wednesday afternoon at the Rogers Centre, but that's only part of the reason he has supreme confidence in handing the ball to Marcus Stroman.
