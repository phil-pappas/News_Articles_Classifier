His Comets counterpart, Joe Cannata, recorded a shutout, stopping all 27 shots.\nSyracuse was unable to convert on five power-play opportunities, while the penalty kill unit shut down all four Utica man-advantages.\nAfter a scoreless first period, the Comets opened scoring with 7:54 remaining in the middle frame. Joseph LaBate and Alex Friesen set up Niklas Jensen for a 3-on-1 play. Jensen skated in and fired on net. Wilcox appeared to make the save, but the puck trickled past the netminder and across the goal line.\nDespite numerous scoring opportunities, the Crunch were unable to make a comeback.\nThe teams will meet again at 2:30 p.m. on Friday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T05:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T01:06:13.366+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
