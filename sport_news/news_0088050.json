Waitsburg’s Emily Adams led the way for both boys and girls. Adams ran the three mile course 19:48.03 to win the Division II girls race. Adams ran against 125 runners to take first place by 11 seconds over second place finisher, Pullman’s Elyria Kbasenche. On the team side, Pullman captured the Division II girls team title with 89 points. On the Division I boys race, Eisenhower won the team title with 77 points. Mid-Columbia Conference foes Wa-Hi and Richland finished in the top 10. The Bombers edged the Blue Devils 276-284 to capture ninth while Wa-Hi settled for 10th. Wa-Hi’s Alex Iben was the top Blue Devil finisher as he ran 16:39.42 over the three mile course. Justin Janke, out of North Central of Spokane, won the boys title with a run of 15:06.18. Andrew Feistner (17:10.8), John Peters (17:32.98), Grayson Gillin (17:32.98), C. Reid Renninger (17:44.48), Justin Mebes (18:11.66), and Tyrese Thomas (18:28.11) also competed in a field of 188 runners for the Blue Devils. “The guys competed well,” Wa-Hi coach MIke Locati said. “It was just an off day. The times seemed slow and the course was longer than three miles. Reid had a great race and moved up (the team ladder).” On the girls side, Wa-Hi’s No. 1 Erika Leinweber, although expected back next week, did not compete in Saturday’s race. Natalie Hartford (22:39.45), Elizabeth Young (23:08.48), Kiana Newcomb (24:43.24) and Sage Kline (26:11.71) picked up the slack for the Blue Devils in the 147 runner field. Katherine Ruck, who ran unattached, won the girls individual title with a run of 18:07.16 over the three-mile course. The team title was earned by Bellarmine Prep which ran to the title over second-place Kamiakin with 111 points. “We had a tough day,” Locati said of the meet for boys and girls. “We had some good runs and some tough ones. It’s hard to figure a reason. It’s the first time in a long time that we didn’t have consistency.” DeSales’ Daniel Ness ran a 17:08.64 in the boys Division I race. On the girls side, DeSales’ Anna Ruthven turned a 21:52.29. “Anna had a good mile,” Locati said. “It fell apart for her, for whatever reason, after a mile.” Wa-Hi travels to Kennewick for a Mid-Columbia Conference meet Thursday. “We’ll just chalk up today as one of those weird days,” Locati summarized. “We’ll have a better day next Thursday. We’ll go after it.” More like this story", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T08:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T08:51:23.560+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
