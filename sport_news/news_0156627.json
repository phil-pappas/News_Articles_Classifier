I will miss serving with my friends on council. We have accomplished a lot in my 3-plus years, and I’m looking forward to seeing what’s to come from afar.”\nHolcomb occupied Place 2 on the City Council. Mayor Dave Claunch released a statement Oct. 4 saying the city council plans to address Holcomb’s replacement during the Oct. 14 council meeting. Claunch said he anticipates council will appoint a replacement at the Oct. 28 meeting to fill out Holcomb’s remaining term, which ends May 2016.\n“Taylor has been an invaluable member of the council, sharing his legal and personal wisdom on many occasions,” Claunch said in a statement. “He will be sorely missed.”\nResidents interested in applying for the council seat can download a volunteer information and application form from the city’s website at westlakehills.org.\n“I learned a lot about perserverance,” Holcomb said of his time on the city council. “I gained friends - we didn’t always agree on everything, but everyone was civil and I think that’s how a local government should be.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T23:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T03:45:18.568+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
