More than 15.2 million unique viewers watched for any length of time, the NFL said Monday. That works out to about a half-hour per viewer. \nApproximately a third of the audience was international. \nBecause Sunday’s experiment was the first of its kind, there isn’t an easy comparison between the streaming numbers and any previous sports broadcasts. \nJacksonville’s wild 34-31 win over Buffalo, which started at 9:30 a.m. EDT, was available only through Yahoo worldwide everywhere other than the two home markets, where it was televised on CBS. \nNFL senior vice president Hans Schroeder said Sunday the experiment proved that streaming could be used as the main distribution method for more games and for higher-profile time slots. \nSchroeder, who oversees media strategy, business development and sales, said NFL officials were pleased with the quality of the stream and “any glitches were around the edges.” Many users reported intermittent choppiness in their feeds, though that can be caused by Internet connections. \nThe NFL is on a one-year contract with CBS for “Thursday Night Football,” and Schroeder said the league will need to consider in the coming months whether a streaming option could be used for at least part of that package. Of course, the possibility of digital companies such as Yahoo bidding for the rights alongside television networks could help to drive up the cost of the next Thursday prime-time contract. \nCopyright © 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T15:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T17:33:31.076+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
