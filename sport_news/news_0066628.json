Thorpe, Keeon Johnson and Olamide Zaccheaus, receiver is the one position where Virginia has power-conference caliber and depth. So Doni Dowling's recent return from multiple knee injuries is unlikely to have much ripple effect. \nBut Dowling's preference not to redshirt is notable. \n\"I felt if my coaches needed me,\" he said Monday, \"I put trust in them because without them I wouldn't be here. They wouldn't steer me wrong. My family wanted me to redshirt. Other coaches that I really admire wanted me to redshirt. I hear 'em left and right. \n\"But … I have faith in my coaches, and I want to contribute to my team. Knowing there's a lot going on and a lot on Coach London right now and his staff, and I love having them around, if I could do anything, I'm going to do what I can.\" \nMike London's job insecurity has hovered over this program for three seasons running, and with a 24-42 record in Charlottesville, 1-4 this season, don't expect any change. But London and his players are conditioned to deflect the inevitable questions, making Dowling's unprompted veering unusual. \nThe 2015 Virginia football season in pictures. \nJust to make sure my interpretation was correct, I asked Dowling, a sophomore, if he is essentially willing to sacrifice his season to possibly help London save his job. \n\"Pretty much. … I love Coach London and I love Coach Hagans, who really put his neck out there to get me here,\" Dowling said. \"I'll do what I can for them, because without them, I might not be here today.\" \nMarques Hagans coaches Virginia's receivers and used Dowling sparingly in Saturday's 26-19 loss at Pittsburgh, Dowling's first game since tearing his left ACL jumping into a snowbank in February and tearing the meniscus in his right knee last month during a practice. He still could redshirt, and absent significant improvement during subsequent practices, coaches may, indeed, shut him down.

I'm proud of the resolve, the resilience, the not-quit attitude.\" \nSuch praise may play well in the locker room, London's most important constituency, but many among the faithful won't be pleased. They're weary of losing, be the margin close (Pitt and Notre Dame) or convincing (UCLA and Boise State). \nFans won't care, either, for center Jackson Matteo's answer regarding a sense of urgency. \n\"No level of urgency,\" he said. \"We don't need to rush things. We don't need to change anything. Everyone in that locker room is doing everything they can to make sure that this team is successful. We're not going to change anything. We're this close, and we're going to stick to our game plan. We're going to do what we've been doing, and we're going to successful.\" \nBelief in the system is one thing, and few doubt the want-to among players and coaches. But at some point, change is imperative. \nFueling some fans' ire: Maryland's turfing of coach Randy Edsall on Sunday. They want athletic director Craig Littlepage to acknowledge the program's depths by dismissing London sooner rather than later. \nTwo reasons that hasn't happened: Unlike Edsall, London has earned considerable goodwill among his co-workers and superiors. Moreover, Virginia's staggered start is largely a function of its non-conference schedule, an ill-advised slog panned repeatedly. \nThe four teams to beat the Cavaliers — UCLA, Notre Dame, Boise State and Coastal Division rival Pitt — are a combined 18-4. \nSyracuse (3-2, 1-0 ACC) is not in that class. The league win was at home, against Wake Forest, and the others were over Rhode Island and Central Michigan. \nSyracuse played LSU closer than expected last month at the Carrier Dome, falling 34-24 as Leonard Fournette bulldozed for 244 yards and two touchdowns. But closer than expected doesn't always translate to future performance. \nMuch like Virginia imploded versus Boise State two weeks after nearly upsetting Notre Dame, the Orange followed up the LSU game with a 45-24 loss at South Florida last week. The Bulls (2-3) gained 540 yards, their most against the Bowl Subdivision in three years, and their 45 points were the program's most versus the FBS since 2011. \nIf Virginia can't light it up against this crowd, at home … \nThe Cavaliers' universal struggles are evident in this nugget: They and 0-5 Kansas are the only power conference teams ranked below 100th nationally in scoring offense and scoring defense. \nDefensive end Trent Corney insists he and his teammates are not deterred. \n\"After the (Pitt) loss, when we all gathered around in the locker room, obviously no one was excited about losing,\" he said, \"but I felt like no one felt any panic toward the season. I remember years in the past, when we lost a few games in a row, guys in the locker room were extremely shellshocked, rattled, emotional. \n\"I never saw any guys after the game with a depressed look on their faces. I felt like guys were still positive after the game, even though we lost. As positive as you could possibly be after a game like that. So I still feel really good about the season.\" \nHe's among the minority. \nDavid Teel can be reached at 757-247-4636 or by email at dteel@dailypress.com .
