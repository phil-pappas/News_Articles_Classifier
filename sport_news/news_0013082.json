WIS special coverage of the decision and the road ahead for the Gamecocks. More >> COLUMBIA, SC (WIS) - \nIt's official. \nSouth Carolina head football coach has resigned -- not retired, according to his words -- from the University of South Carolina as the winningest coach in Gamecocks history. \n\"It's time for me to get out of the way,\" Spurrier said. \nSpurrier made his announcement Tuesday afternoon during a noon news conference. The Head Ball Coach said he was leaving the school now instead of leaving at the end of the season to give an opportunity to the interim coaching staff to make an impact on the players. \nSpurrier admitted this year's 2-4 record was all on him. \n\"We've slipped,\" Spurrier said. \"It's my fault. I'm the head coach.\" \nThe announcement came after reports from several media outlets said Spurrier was ready to hang it up after 11 seasons with the team. \nSpurrier announced co-offensive coordinator and offensive line coach Shawn Elliott would be taking over immediately. \"I'm pulling for Shawn,\" he said. \nBut why leave now? Spurrier said he had been thinking about it since week four after the win against the University of Central Florida. He'd even spoke to Tanner about it that week. \n\"When something is inevitable, I believe you do it right then,\" Spurrier said. \n\"I think I was the best coach for this job 11 years ago, but I'm not today.\" \nCopyright 2015 WIS.
