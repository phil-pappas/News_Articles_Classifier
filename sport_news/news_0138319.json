De Paul visited Michigan last week and will take a handful of official visits to other programs.\nThough Walker is committed to the Buckeyes and Urban Meyer is fine with his commits taking other visits, that doesn't mean Ohio State isn't going to look around.\n• Did Michigan recruiting coordinator Chris Partridge jab Ohio State about Kareem Walker?\nAs Meyer put it on the Big Ten Teleconference on Tuesday, Ohio State always has to have a \"Plan B\" lined up when his commits visit other schools. And it does.\nOhio State is hosting four-star running back Antonio Williams of New London (N.C.) North Stanly -- a 5-foot-10, 210-pound running back who is currently committed to Wisconsin -- for Saturday night's game vs. Penn State. It's an unofficial visit.\nRated the No. 7 running back in the 2016 class , Williams committed to Wisconsin on Dec. 4 last year, but he's clearly interested in looking around.\nWilliams also has offers from Alabama, Auburn, Clemson, Florida, Georgia, Michigan State, Notre Dame, Penn State, Tennessee and others, so he's clearly elite.\nSo what happens next?\nWilliams told ESPN recruiting analyst Tom VanHaaren that what happens in Columbus this weekend determines the next step.\nI asked RB Antonio Williams what happens after this Ohio State visit and he said \"The visit Saturday will determine what happens next.\"\n— Tom VanHaaren (@TomVH) October 14, 2015\nThis is when things get tricky in recruiting.\nBecause there's a chance Williams will want to be a Buckeye by the end of the weekend, but Walker, the No. 1 running back in the 2016 class, is still committed. Meyer isn't going to force Walker out.\nBut this particular spot in Ohio State's class is for a running back, and if Walker talks a while to decide to ultimately decommit, Ohio State could end up losing Williams in the process, too.\nRecruiting is hard.", "external_links": ["http://247sports.com/Recruitment/Antonio-Williams-24992/RecruitInterests", "https://twitter.com/TomVH/status/654093173824823296"], "published": "2015-10-14T19:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T20:41:05.061+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
