Probably not, but it certainly is a good first step. \nThe looker room was a buzz Friday afternoon, as Sean Payton announced he fully expects Brees to again take his rightful place behind center. \nLuke McCown did a fine job in place of Brees in the loss at Carolina last week, throwing for 310 yards on 31 of 38 attempts. Nevertheless, Brees' triumphant return for Sunday Night Football could be just the boost the team needs to get past the Tony Romo and Dez Bryant-less Dallas Cowboys. \nBrees has been a limited participant in practice all week and is listed as probable for Sunday's game, however listening to his teammates that probable seems more like a definite. \n\"Drew came out to practice you could feel it there was an energy on the practice field and everybody was excited he was back and we are all motivated and ready to get that first win,\" Saints outside linebacker Kasim Edebali said. \nOn Wednesday, Brees said he felt good, took most of the reps and planned to ramp up the intensity as the week progressed. \n\"I mean I was going to temper my enthusiasm with some of the stuff,\" he said. \"You know, be smart and just make sure it's one of these ramp ups and not 0-60.\" \nApparently that was the smart move because he's responded well to three days of practice. \n\"I think all of that has gone real well and look, the diagnosis was never a tear, I've read that, the diagnosis was what it was (a bruised rotator cuff),\" Payton said. \"Obviously, you know when you're going to throw and it gets caught, there's a torque. It stresses that joint, but the rehab has gone well and you know how he is with being meticulous and attention to it and all of that. It's encouraging.\" \nRunning back Mark Ingram said it will be nice to have Brees back out there come Sunday, not only because he's a future Hall of Famer and the team's best player, but also for his intangibles. Several other Saints echoed those sentiments, as well. \n\"He's obviously the leader of this team emotionally, on the field. It's always good to have him there he's a guy that kind of rallies us,\" said tight end Ben Watson, one of Brees' fellow offensive captains. \nEven the rookies recognize Brees in the engine that drives the team. \n\"Drew's gonna be ready to go and just seeing that everyone is gonna fall into place, I feel like. And his leadership role is gonna take over and guys are gonna follow,\" said wideout Willie Snead, who's caught 10 passes for 151 yards and a touchdown in three games. \nBrees was injured in the first half against Tampa Bay two weeks ago, yet remained in the game despite being visibly shaken and in considerable pain. Through two games, Brees is 54 of 86 for 610 yards, two touchdowns and two interceptions. His quarterback rating is just 82.0. Last week, McCown's quarterback rating was 89.7. \nThe Saints offense has uncharacteristically struggled this season in all phases of the game. Brandin Cooks is the team's leading receiver with 16 catches for 190 yards, while Mark Ingram is the leading rusher with 39 carries for 127 yards and two touchdowns. \nWithout Brees in the lineup last week, the Saints failed to produce an explosive play, which is any run of 10 yards or longer, or any pass of 25 yards or longer.
