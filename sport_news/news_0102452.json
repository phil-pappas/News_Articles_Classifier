He says the project will be a huge boost right away to the local economy, and an economic engine in Fall River for years to come. \nThe project will include a one million square foot warehouse, 1,500 parking spaces, and 115 trailer spaces. The facility is scheduled to open in the Fall of 2016.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T03:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T16:26:51.900+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
