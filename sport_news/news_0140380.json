Then Panarin's name was called. The spotlight shined on him and Panarin, who doesn't speak English, had a puzzled look on his face. Marian Hossa, the No. 1 star, tried to tell Panarin to get on the ice. Panarin got the message, went on the ice and mimicked Seabrook. Crisis averted.\n\"If not for Seabrook I probably would have gone behind the net,\" Panarin said through teammate Viktor Tikhonov, who interprets for Panarin during interview sessions.\nIf Saturday was any indication of Panarin's future with the Hawks, he better get used to taking a curtain call.\nAfter he was sidelined for most of training camp with an upper-body injury, the four-year veteran of the KHL had an impressive debut Saturday night. The 5-foot-11 winger skated on a line with Artem Anisimov and Patrick Kane and the results caught the attention of coach Joel Quenneville. Panarin finished the game with two assists as two Hawks' goals came off rebounds from Panarin shots.\n\"Physically just need to get in a little bit of shape,\" Panarin said. \"In the beginning it was a little tough. Took a couple of shifts to get into it but it got easier as it went along.\"\nAll the action from United Center.\nAnisimov is also Russian and when Quenneville was asked if he put Panarin and Anisimov together because Anisimov speaks Russian, he said with a smile, \"It helps.\n\"The three of them looked like they had a little bit of chemistry. I thought they got better in the week of practicing. There's something there. There's anticipation on both sides of the puck, all three of them. I expect some finish as well.\"\nSo far, Panarin has impressed his teammates with his skill and off the ice he has tried learning English, taking classes with an instructor over Skype. So far he only knows a few simple words, but his sense of humor has come through. Through Tikhonov's translation, Panarin often jokes around with reporters.\n\"He's going to learn pretty quick,\" Hossa said. \"Too bad we don't understand him well because he has lots of jokes. He's going to be a funny guy.\"\nUltimately, the Hawks just hope he can produce. They signed Panarin to a two-year contract in the offseason, a deal Panarin's agent Tom Lynn said included an out clause for Panarin to return to Russia if Panarin did not make the team.\nThe victory over the Stars showed why the Hawks were determined to beat out several teams for Panarin's services.\nAnd Panarin showed why he should get used to life in the NHL â€” he could be playing in North America for quite a while.\nchine@tribpub.com\nTwitter @ChristopherHine\n Ice Hockey Chicago Blackhawks Artem Anisimov Joel Quenneville Dallas Stars Marian Hossa Patrick Kane", "external_links": ["http://www.tribpub.com/privacy-policy-and-your-privacy-rights/", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-5610bfff/turbine/chi-hawks-stars1003-ct0031481616-20151003", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-5610c000/turbine/chi-hawks-stars1003-ct0031481162-20151003", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-561196a1/turbine/ct-artemi-panarin-blackhawks-spt-1005-20151004", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-561129ee/turbine/ct-blackhawks-4-stars-0-photos-spt-20151003"], "published": "2015-10-05T14:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T01:52:06.855+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
