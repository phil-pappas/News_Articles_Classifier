That position is increasingly being questioned after fantasy companies began offering daily competitions, million-dollar prizes and other games that more closely resemble gambling.\nDraftKings has also stopped offering its contest winners free entries to the final poker tournament, the company said Thursday night. The fantasy player Max Steinberg, one of the final nine poker players who will compete for $7.68 million next month, won his entry through a DraftKings league that had an entry fee of $27. Steinberg has worn the DraftKings logo throughout the event but is no longer affiliated with the company.\n“This is a result of daily fantasy sports no longer being authorized in Nevada,” Sabrina Macias, a spokeswoman for DraftKings, said.\nDraftKings became television’s top advertiser when it showed a commercial every minute and a half in the week leading up to the N.F.L. season, according to iSpot.tv , which tracks television advertising. Since then, the industry has been under siege, with investigators looking into whether employees, armed with inside information, exploited paying customers.\nDaily fantasy sports operate under an exemption to the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act of 2006, which outlawed online poker and sports betting.\nLoading...
