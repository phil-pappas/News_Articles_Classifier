He blocked to prevent Logano from passing him for the lead, but Logano made contact with him that caused Kenseth to spin.\nKenseth wound up 14th and heads into Sunday's elimination race at Talladega Superspeedway last in the Chase for the Sprint Cup championship field.\nLogano won his second consecutive race and denied intentionally hitting Kenseth.\nKenseth bristled Friday at Logano's claim and said Logano should stop talking about the incident.
