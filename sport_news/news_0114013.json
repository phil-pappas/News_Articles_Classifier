The Lady Buccaneers showed their might in a three-set sweep and advanced to face perennial power McIntosh on Tuesday. Staff photo by Kelly J. Huff slideshow ACWORTH — Allatoona never trailed in any set, rolling past Kell for a 25-15, 25-18, 25-13 win Thursday in the first round of the Class state playoffs. “We met (Thursday afternoon) and I put up the word ‘fear’ for them,” Allatoona coach Joe Soley said. “We’re playing two freshmen, and sometimes you don’t know what you’re going to get. Fear can get the best of you. But they played fearlessly (Thursday).”Continuing the momentum from its Area 5 championship, Allatoona (33-17) advanced to host Area 4 runner-up McIntosh in Tuesday’s second round.Allatoona began the first set on a 5-0 run and took advantage of several Kell errors. “We had some errors that brought us down I think,” Kell coach Jessica Bougard said, “but I’m proud of them for the way they came out and played a first-place team in this area.” Kell (10-19) showed that competitiveness in the second set when it went on a 6-0 run — starting with Jazzlyn Kenner’s kill — to tie the score at 13-all. Allatoona, however, got back on track, scoring eight of the final nine points in the set. Raegan Merideth had one of her six kills during the rally, helping spark the Lady Buccaneers. Allatoona showed no signs of slowing down coming out of the intermission following the second set, jumping to a 7-2 lead to start the third, before the match ultimately ended on an out-of-bounds serve by Kell libero Bella Smart. “We’ve never played three solid sets before. It was a match where we had that eye-of-the-tiger look,” Soley said with a laugh. “You could see it on their faces. I think they know what’s at stake. Nobody wanted to go home.”For Kell, the season came to an end, and there will be plenty of new faces to start the season in 2016. “I’ve got seven seniors on this roster,” Bougard said, “so it’s going to be a tough beginning next year. Allatoona played awesome, and we made some errors, but I don’t want to end on that negative note. This was the first time since 2011 that we came out of area, and I’m proud of them.” Share This Article | similar stories Buccaneers’ defense taking control | 7 days ago by Adam Carrington acarrington@mdjonline.com Kell set for subregion play | 28 days ago by Adam Carrington acarrington@mdjonline.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T08:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T08:09:42.998+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
