Giant panda cubs are about the size of a stick of butter at birth, the zoo says, and are pink with short, sparse white hair.\nEr Shun demonstrated “excellent maternal instincts” as she cleaned and cradled the first cub soon after it was born, the zoo said. The animals’ handlers do not yet know the cubs’ sex, and it may take several months before that can be confirmed.\nDue to their small size, the next days are crucial to the panda cubs’ survival. They will be held in the maternity area of the zoo’s panda house for several months.\nThe zoo announced Er Shun was pregnant with twins on Sept. 30 after she was artificially inseminated last May.\nThe giant pandas are on loan at the Toronto Zoo until 2018, at which point they will be moved to the Calgary Zoo.\nMore on thestar.com\nChina airlines hazing ritual forces flight attendants into overhead bins\nMH17 downed by Russian-made missile", "external_links": ["http://static.freeskreen.com/publisher/52/freeskreen.min.js"], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T16:06:13.901+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
