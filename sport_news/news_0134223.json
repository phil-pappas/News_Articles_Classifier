After finding the work at the ATM building section of the Secretariat ‘unsatisfactory’, he said in case the working of the Secretariat did not improve even after his visit, senior officials would be held accountable. During the inspection in the morning, the Chief Minister found heaps of files awaiting perusal of the officials concerned. On closer scrutiny, several files were incomplete. Also, several review officers and section officers were not found in their seats. As soon as the Chief Minister accompanied by Additional Secretariat (Secretariat Administration) Neeraj Kherwal, entered the room, the grills at the entry point were shut, preventing officials who had been missing from their seats from entering the section. Most of the officials were standing nearby and having a leisurely conversation with other colleagues. Later, talking to mediapersons, Rawat said, “I have come here to see the working condition here so that there is a greater coordination in the government. I hope after my visit there is contemplation about the issues that I raised. I do not want to punish anybody, but in case things remain unchanged, the joint secretary, under secretary and the additional secretary will be held responsible,” said Rawat. When asked if he could rate the functioning of the Secretariat as on previous occasion he had said some agencies had given 17th rank to the Uttarakhand Secretariat, the Chief Minister refused to elaborate and said there was a shortage of review officials that needed to be addressed.
