For a second consecutive week, Memphis was the only American Athletic Conference team in the group. Houston and Temple finished just outside the coaches’ Top 25 with 75 and 71 votes, respectively.\nMemphis narrowly missed a Top 25 ranking in the second major poll, which is arranged by the Associated Press. The Tigers received 59 votes and finished just two spots out of the Top 25. Houston was ranked No. 24, and Temple received 96 votes to finish 26th.\nMemphis broke into the coaches poll last week at No. 25 after a 24-17 victory at South Florida, its 12th consecutive win. The next day, coach Justin Fuente said the team would not pay attention to such accolades.\n“We have an incredible challenge against an incredibly talented Ole Miss team, and then like I said, six days later, we have to turn around and take it on the road and play a Tulsa team that’s in the Top 5 in the country in scoring and is throwing and running it all over the place,” Fuente said last Monday. “So we don’t have time to sit around and pat each other on the back. We’ve got a lot of work to do.”\nThe Tigers, who were idle last week, are among the 16 unbeaten teams remaining in the FBS. They have not lost in a full calendar year.\nThe Rebels checked in at No. 12 in the coaches poll and No. 13 in the AP Top 25 after crushing New Mexico State, 52-3, on Saturday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T19:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T11:32:26.418+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
