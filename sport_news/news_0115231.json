(Photo: Kevin C. Cox Getty Images) \nThe key to getting a true sense of the Tom Izzo/Jim Harbaugh relationship that dates back more than 20 years was getting Tom Crean on the phone. The normally talkative Izzo wasn't forthcoming with a lot of details, presumably out of deference to Mark Dantonio and Michigan State — and as Izzo said, it's been a long time and it's obviously different with Harbaugh at U-M. And Harbaugh, you may have noticed, doesn't say much about anything. \nCrean also gave an interesting MSU angle on Harbaugh's coaching career that I hadn't heard previously. When Crean got Marquette to the 2003 Final Four in New Orleans, he got his pal Nick Saban — then LSU's coach, previously MSU's coach when Crean was there with Izzo — tickets to the national semifinals against Kansas. Harbaugh was there, of course, and had just completed his first season as an NFL assistant, coaching quarterbacks under Bill Callahan with the Oakland Raiders. His duties included serving as \"two-minute offensive coordinator.\" \nSaban and Harbaugh had a long talk about that aspect of football, in particular. Couch: MSU's 1995 win over U-M a euphoric false start \n\"Nick started asking Jim different questions there, and I've said I believe that was one of the bigger watershed moments for Jim's coaching career,\" Crean said. \"They really dove into two-minute football from a coach's point of view instead of a player's point of view, and it was one of those trigger points for Jim early on.\" \nSo yes, Michigan State fans, Izzo and Saban both played a small role in the Jim Harbaugh story. If only Saban knew what he knows now about those evil satellite camps…. \nMore from Crean on: \n*Harbaugh getting involved with MSU basketball: \"There's never been a time that Jim doesn't walk in and blend in. Jim's in the action. That's his competitive nature, he's got to be in the action. That's who he is. So whether it's picking up a different part of football, whether it's diving all the way in to being a Michigan State fan that weekend so we have a chance to beat Duke, whatever it is, Jim is always all in. And it's always from the competitive standpoint. He loves the game, he loves to be in the game. The hardest thing for Jim is to not be participating in the action.\" Fake Harbaugh spends day in East Lansing \n*The scene at Harbaugh family get-togethers: \"There's never any total getaway. And it doesn't happen as much as everyone would like, those actual moments like that. When they do happen, they're very, very centered on the family. So certainly when Joani's mom and dad are gonna be around, there's gonna be a lot of stories, interesting remembrances from all three of them on their childhood. The square footage of the room they lived in, there's always gonna be some element that's fun. Even that takes on a competitive tone, but in a good way.\" Izzo has longtime bond with U-M's Harbaugh \n*Sharing coaching notes with Jack, John and Jim Harbaugh: \"I learn something every time I'm around those guys. Every time. And it's just, there's nothing like being in that family and having it as a resource 365 days a year, but at the same time there's nothing like the feeling of being with people who care about each other the way the Harbaughs do. They really care about and look out for each other in a big way, and it's a very, very close-knit family. And when they get into something, they're all in. ... There's so many different things that come up. I get an awful lot from it. It shrinks the sports because there's a lot of commonality, dealing with people, dealing with players, running staff and then how you execute game plans. So much of it is just using your athleticism in the proper way, the best way.\" Read or Share this story: http://on.lsj.com/1RK3Gj4 TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T17:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T01:50:00.809+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
