Adjusted earnings, excluding special charges, were 29 cents per share, GE said.\nThird-quarter revenue totaled $31.68 billion, down 1% from $32.1 billion last year.\nWall Street analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters had forecast nearly $28.65 billion in revenue and 26 cents in earnings per share.\nUSA TODAY\nGE to sell $30B lending and leasing firms to Wells Fargo\nThe results came three days after GE sold $30 billion in commercial lending and leasing businesses to Wells Fargo, the latest step in a restructuring plan aimed at selling an estimated $200 billion in assets from the company's GE Capital financing division. The strategy features renewed focus on aviation, energy, transportation and health care, marking a return to GE's manufacturing heritage and a shift away from financing.\nThe company, viewed as a proxy for the U.S. manufacturing sector, said revenue from its aviation division rose 5% from the year-earlier quarter. GE's power and water division posted an equivalent rise of 1%. However, the company reported oil and gas revenue were down 16% year-over-year, amid a continuing global slump of energy prices.\nGE said it plans to launch a share exchange next week for the Synchrony Financial division, GE's consumer finance arm, after winning approval from the Federal Reserve. The exchange is expected to produce a 6% to 7% reduction in the nearly 10.1 billion shares of GE stock outstanding as of June 30.\nFile photo taken in 2014 shows the General Electric logo at a store in Cranberry Township, Pa.
