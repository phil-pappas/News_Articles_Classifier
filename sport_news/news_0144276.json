So you've got an organized crime problem: who ya gonna call? If you're a fan of international soccer, you have two choices.\nYou could choose to trust the team of federal prosecutors who secured a racketeering indictment from a Brooklyn grand jury charging 14 FIFA insiders with conspiring to \"use their positions within the enterprise to engage in schemes involving the solicitation, offer, acceptance, payment, and receipt of undisclosed and illegal payments, bribes, and kickbacks.\"\nOn the other hand you can hope for the best from FIFA's executive committee -- or at least those members of it not recently jailed, suspended, or turned state's evidence -- to adopt the recommendations of a separate FIFA committee, one whose \"preliminary recommendations\" for reform, unveiled Tuesday, include ambitious proposals such as 12-year term limits for FIFA presidents.\nBecause how much damage could a future FIFA president really do in just 12 years atop soccer's international governing body, which regulates and promotes soccer worldwide, organizing the World Cup tournament and steering the distribution of television broadcast deals worth billions of dollars?\nThe FIFA executive committee -- known as the \"Ex-co\" -- gathered for an emergency meeting on Tuesday and \"welcomed\" the proposals of the ethics committee, according to a FIFA news release. \"Welcomed,\" of course, is different from \"adopt.\"\nA few prominent Ex-co members did not attend the meeting in Switzerland. Among the absentees were Michel Platini of France, suspended during an ethics probe concerning financial mismanagement. Platini is trying to hold on to leadership of UEFA, the FIFA confederation that oversees European soccer. Also missing from Zurich was Brazilian soccer bigshot Marco Del Nero, who is reportedly being removed from the Ex-co by his own federation because he refuses to leave Brazil for fear of being arrested and extradited to the U.S.\nThe outgoing FIFA president, Sepp Blatter, has not been charged with any crimes. He sat atop FIFA for 17 years before his suspension last month on ethics charges that he rejects. He has rejected the idea that he was responsible for every action of every member of FIFA, where, according to the grand jury indictment, a vast conspiracy was allowed to fester.\nThe racket that corrupted the FIFA enterprise, the indictment says, \"used various financial mechanisms to facilitate a bribery system that included the creation and use of shell companies, nominees, and numbered bank accounts in tax havens and other secretive banking jurisdictions; the active concealment of foreign bank accounts; the structuring of financial transactions to avoid currency reporting requirements; bulk cash smuggling; the purchase of real property and other physical assets; the use of safe deposit boxes; income tax evasion; and obstruction of justice.\"\nBut Swiss lawyer Francois Carrard, who chairs FIFA's vaunted reform committee, seemed unimpressed with the Justice Department's allegations, which he said, upon being appointed in August, had really only targeted a few gredins\" -- a French term for \"scoundrels\" or \"rogues.\" This came in the same interview where Carrard said soccer, in the United States, was \"just an ethnic sport, for the girls in schools.\"\nThis comment came less than two months after Blatter, fearing a potential arrest, declined to come to Canada to award the women's World Cup trophy to the American women that were the tournament's champions.\nBlatter was not indicted, but he is under investigation by Swiss authorities for business deals he made with several members of the Ex-co, including Jack Warner of Trinidad, who has been indicted but has fought extradition from Trinidad. Blatter has denied all wrongdoing and challenged his ban, but he will be replaced, regardless of guilt or innocence, in a FIFA election scheduled for February 26, 2016.\nTo be fair, Carrard's reform committee has more radical proposals in mind than 12-year term limits for future FIFA presidents. There is also a proposed age limit of 74, and more freedom for the ethics committee to \"publish more information about its ongoing proceedings.\" But don't get the impression these reform proposals are now in place; Carrard only recently got his \"interim report\" to the Ex-co. The final proposals will be put forward in November, when the Ex-co will decide which of them to recommend to the full FIFA Congress in 2016.\nBy then, U.S. prosecutors will likely have made some moves of their own. Not \"proposals\" or \"draft recommendations\" but more like arraignments, cooperation agreements, and maybe even more arrests. After setting the FBI and IRS loose on the Ex-co for more than three years, the feds have scored four guilty pleas, the forfeiture of $151 million dollars by one defendant, Jose Hawilla, and deep undercover work by another, Chuck Blazer. Only three of the 14 FIFA members and sports marketing executives charged in May have entered a plea, but U.S. Attorney General has already promised that there are more charges to come.\nRelated Stories Germany paid FIFA members bribes for 2006 World Cup: report Judge unseals records of key witness in FIFA case Swiss authorities approve extraditing ex-FIFA official Rocha al-Hussein submits candidacy for FIFA presidential election FIFA hits Thai football president with 90-day ban End Zone: A timeline of Sepp Blatter's FIFA downfall", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T23:54:34.090+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
