TCCshowdown set Clinton secured a share of the Tri-County Conference championship with its win over Britton Deerfield, bringing a one-game lead in the standings into the Week 9 showdown with second-place Whiteford. Since suffering its only loss against Summerfield, Whiteford has won four straight games by a combined score of 206-58. Clinton can become the first team to win four consecutive TCC championships since Sand Creek from 2004 to 2007. Hudson defense steps up The Hudson defense shined in a shutout win over LCAArival Onsted that kept the Tigers alive for an at-large berth in the state playoffs. Hudson allowed Onsted only 69 yards of offense and four first downs in the contest. Onstedâ€™s longest gain of the night was just 15 yards. Last week, Hudson ranked third in the county in total defense (209.2 per game), behind Lenawee Christian (207)and Morenci (182.3). The Tigers will face Hillsdale in Week 9 and need a win for a shot at the playoffs. Adrian passing game heating up The Adrian passing attack was strong for the second straight week in a loss to SEC crossover opponent Monroe. Joel Hill connected on 17 of his 28 pass attempts for a county-best 230 yards and two touchdowns, one to Ty Peck and the other to Mitchell Dempsey. Peck finished with six catches for 144 yards, one of the best receiving performances in the county this season. Over the past two weeks, Hill has completed 25 of 37 passes (67.6 percent) for 372 yards, six touchdowns and no interceptions. Rydzinski a double threat for LCS Lenawee Christian's Thomas Rydzinski had a strong game both on the ground and through the air in an SCAA win over North Adams. Rydzinski rushed for 101 yards and four touchdowns on nine carries, while catching four passes for 70 yards. LCS (7-1) matched its school record for wins and can set a new mark this week against winless Camden-Frontier.
