Don Markus Contact Reporter The Baltimore Sun Mark Turgeon: \"When I took the job ... a long time ago, this is what I envisioned for Maryland basketball.\" \nSitting in the front row of the student section at Xfinity Center on Saturday night for Magic Maryland Madness, Maryland sophomore Kevin Dragonette of Clarksville recalled his doubts about the future of the Terps men's basketball team when Hall of Fame coach Gary Williams retired in the spring of 2011. \n\"I was personally a big fan of Gary Williams, so I was skeptical when Mark Turgeon came,\" said Dragonette, who was attending Calvert Hall at the time. \"When Mark Turgeon came, I was very impressed from the first game I saw until now, being able to recruit some of the best players in the country, like Diamond Stone. I'm ready for the season. I think we're going to be pretty good.\" \nAfter watching his players during a 10-minute scrimmage, Turgeon knows his Terps have a ways to go to to live up to their national ranking — No. 3, behind co-top-ranked North Carolina and Kentucky in the USA Today preseason coaches poll — and the expectations of their fans. \n\"We've started slowly with our practices, but we'll pick it up,\" Turgeon said. \"There's a lot of stuff going on right now with Maryland Madness and recruiting and different things that take away. But we'll really dive in. We've had 10 really good practices. We've still got a lot to put in. We still don't have an out-of-bounds play. There's a lot of things we have to do.\" \nTypical of what the Terps have shown since preseason practice began Oct. 5, Maryland took what is normally a showcase of dunks and ill-advised 3-pointers with an unusual level of down-to-business seriousness. \n\"I was proud of the way our guys played; we actually played hard and didn't make it an all-star game,\" Turgeon said. \"We showed a little bit of what we're going to be about.\" \nSophomore point guard Melo Trimble can attest to that. Reminiscent of when he suffered a concussion in the season-ending loss to West Virginia in the NCAA tournament, Trimble fell to the court hard after a solid screen by Stone, a freshman center. This time, he got up and capped the scrimmage with a tear drop after being fouled and a step-back 3-pointer.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T05:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T20:06:29.229+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
