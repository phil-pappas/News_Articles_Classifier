The momentum is on the side of the Red and Black as they are coming off a victory, but Syracuse's stingy defense is only giving up an average of 4.0 points-per-game and a solid home crowd will help Syracuse.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T05:57:55.879+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
