We have kind of had that - not the results. The players just need to focus on doing their job, making sure they fight for 95 minutes and give the crowd what they want. \n\"They want to see fight, they want to see attitude, they want to see good football. Give them that and generally - some things are out of your control, the result is - but generally if you get that, you win games.\" \nTo date, Newcastle have collected a paltry three points and went into the weekend rooted to the foot of the table and in danger of being cast adrift. \nNorwich arrive on Tyneside six points better off having made a decent fist of life back in the top flight. \nMcClaren said: \"They've been very good, very good. It's not surprised me at all that the three [promoted] teams have started quite well. \n\"They have got the buoyancy and the confidence of promotion, the nucleus of the squad stays, they add very well and they can be a handful at the start, which they are proving. \n\"I saw them [Norwich] against West Ham - they could have won that game, should have won that game, and Leicester, they shouldn't have lost that game, so this is not going to be easy.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T14:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T20:13:17.408+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
