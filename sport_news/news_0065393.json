(Steve Ruark / Baltimore Sun) Can Towson beat No. 23 Villanova to stay relevant in the CAA? \nVILLANOVA (3-3) @ TOWSON (3-3) \nSite: Johnny Unitas Stadium, Towson \nTV: Comcast SportsNet, Ch. 24 \nAudio: 1300 AM, TowsonTigers.com \nSeries: Villanova leads 7-4 \nWhat’s at stake: The Tigers helped themselves enormously by outlasting Colonial Athletic Association foe Stony Brook, 21-14, a week ago. Not only did they collect their first win in the CAA this season and improve to 1-2 in the conference, but they also gave themselves an outside shot at the league championship and a potential spot in the NCAA Football Championship Subdivision playoffs. But to remain relevant, Towson — which is 2-1 at home this fall — must overcome the Wildcats and a little bit of history. Villanova, which is 2-1 in the conference and ranked No. 23 in the FCS, has won six of the past seven meetings between the CAA rivals, including the past three in Towson. The Wildcats broke a two-game losing streak by blanking Albany, 37-0, on Saturday. It marked their first shutout since a 45-0 win over Rhode Island on Nov. 9, 2013.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T19:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T19:18:52.365+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
