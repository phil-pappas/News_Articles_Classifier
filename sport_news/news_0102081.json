It serves as compensation for track and field participants who qualify for national teams.\n“I was really pleased,” Symmonds said. “They had been making a lot of demands without compensating us for a long time. Now that they are increasing their revenue sharing, I think it’s a huge step in the right direction.”\nSymmonds might have been the loudest voice in the sport when it came to compensating athletes. He refused to sign a document involving apparel for the United States team that competed in the World Championships this year, and therefore was not allowed to participate.\n“USATF sold the right to what Team USA wears at championships for $20 million a year. That comes on our hard work,” Symmonds said. “We are out there day and night. We’re representing our teams and representing our country. Twenty million dollars is a significant amount of money. A majority of that, I believe, needs to be paid to the athletes one way or another. Previously it wasn’t.\n“Most countries pay their athletes to train full time. We rely heavily on corporate support but there are a lot of Olympic athletes who don’t have corporate contracts. That’s where the USATF had been dropping the ball.”\nSymmonds is a five-time national champion and a two-time Olympian. If the new rules had been in force during his entire career, he would have earned about $80,000 from the USATF. Symmonds believes the issue is a sign that the old rules and approaches regarding amateur sports haven’t completely gone away.\n“I say that track and field is a semi-professional sport,” the veteran runner said. “It’s not a professional sport in the way that I think other professional sports have achieved that title. ... We have a long, long way to go before we’re truly a full-fledged professional sport.”\nSymmonds made the remarks last week during a week-long tour of New York and Pennsylvania, which included a stop at Fleet Feet in Buffalo. Here he ran with about 40 runners for a half-hour in North Buffalo, took questions from participants, signed autographs and posed for pictures.\nSymmonds always has been on the outspoken side. He credits his upbringing for that.\n“My parents are pretty vocal people,” Symmonds said. “They always told me to speak up when something bothers me. This has been bothering me for a very long time. I started this fight back in 2011 when the USATF had some really ridiculous logo restrictions. I think the next fight is with” the International Olympic Committee, “which made $5 billion off the 2012 Olympic Games and gave the athletes zero. That’s not OK with me.”\nThe popular runner grew up in Idaho, where he was unbeatable on the track in high school. Symmonds could have gone to a Division I program, but was told it would be impossible to be a biochemistry major while training for major college athletics. So he headed to Willamette University in Salem, Ore., where he did both. Symmonds won seven NCAA Division III titles there.\nThis was all heady stuff, but it was difficult to know just how good he could become. It took a loss in a race right after graduation to teach him.\n“It was the first race I lost in seven years,” Symmonds said. “I said, ‘Wow, it’s the first race that I was pushing, and I still managed to get second.’ I shaved a second and a half off my personal best. I thought the sky was the limit if I continued to invest the right amount of energy and surround myself with the right people.”\nSymmonds qualified for the 2008 Olympics in the 800 meters, reaching the semifinals. That was a warmup for his 2012 performance in London, where he finished with a personal best of 1 minute, 42.95 seconds. Symmonds’ emotions were decidedly mixed at that point.\n“That time would have won a medal at every Olympics besides those Games. So from a medal-focused athlete’s point of view, yeah, it was really frustrating. But if I take a step back and look at the broader picture, I was an athlete who brought the best product ever on the very largest stage. I will always be proud of that fact.”\nSymmonds is 31 now, competing against runners a decade younger, but he’s still a world-class runner. But for how much longer?\n“I guarantee I can it do it for one more year,” he said. “I’ve got to train for Rio,” site of the 2016 Olympics. “I think I’ll probably run one more year after that. Unfortunately, there are no world championships in 2018, so it’s hard to imagine training from there.”\nemail: bbailey@buffnews.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T22:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T06:11:38.809+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
