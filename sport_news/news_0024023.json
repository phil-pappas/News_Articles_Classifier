Since taking the reins of BU football in 2008, the program has undergone a complete resurrection... a 45-12 record since 2011, a Heisman winner in Robert Griffin III, a brand new stadium and a pair of Big 12 titles. This year's team ranks #2 in the nation. In averaging nine touchdowns a game during their 5-0 start, the Bears have been almost 50-50 in run-pass production... 1,788 yards on the ground with three talented tailbacks, 1,837 yards through the air with first-year starter and junior Seth Russell. Nobody needs to remind the Bears that their only regular season loss in 2014 came at the hands of the Mountaineers. In that game, WVU held Baylor to a season-low 27 points by getting home on several well-designed blitzes.
