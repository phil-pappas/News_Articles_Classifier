Someday, there may no longer be a quarterback controversy at Ohio State — but that day probably won't be Monday.\nAdChoices J.T. Barrett might have played his way back into the starting quarterback role with his strong performance in No. 1 Ohio State's 38-10 win over Penn State.\nMORE: Best images from Week 7 | Five takeaways from OSU's win\nThe man who will make that decision, coach Urban Meyer, says he'll let everyone know his decision on Monday.\n\"I thought J.T. came in and played great,\" Meyer told reporters . \"He ran for [102] yards, and he obviously gives you that dual threat, and when you're bogged down a little bit, he did a great job.\n\"Just let me evaluate it. I'll let you guys know on Monday, and we'll go from there.\"\nBarrett scored two touchdowns on the ground, and added two more passing touchdowns after relieving starter Cardale Jones. That's become normal in recent weeks, with Barrett coming off the bench to breathe life into a sputtering Buckeyes' offense.\nMany OSU fans would be happy to see the redshirt sophomore Barrett reclaim the starting role he held until going down with an injury early last year. For his part, Barrett is just happy to contribute.\n\"Ultimately, it's Coach Meyer's call, but, at the end of the day, I'm just trying to help the team win,\" Barrett told reporters. \"Whether that means going in for the red zone or if I'm the starting quarterback, at the end of the day, I don't think it really matters. When I'm in there, I'm just trying to do the best I can to help the team win.\n\"I don't know what the credentials for stats on the field in order to start at Ohio State are. ... I'm just trying to keep on getting better in practice, and the results come out on Saturday.\"\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.sportingnews.com/list/4658538-ohio-state-beats-penn-state-jt-barrett-cardale-jones-ezekiel-elliott-hackenberg", "http://espn.go.com/college-football/story/_/id/13914259/ohio-state-buckeyes-coach-urban-meyer-assess-quarterback-situation-heels-jt-barrett-strong-play-bench", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "http://www.sportingnews.com/", "http://www.sportingnews.com/photos/4658340-college-football-week-7-photos-pictures-ncaa-auburn-kentucky-charles-walker-ricardo-louis/slide/366608"], "published": "2015-10-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T20:59:13.079+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
