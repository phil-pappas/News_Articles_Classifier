TOM SHERIDAN, STAFF Related article Â» Residents of a South Perris neighborhood who say they have been under siege from mosquitoes for weeks descended upon city hall on Thursday, Oct. 8, to vent, plead and state their case to public officials.\nMore than 75 people attended the community meeting in the city council chambers, as well as representatives from the city of Perris, Riverside County Environmental Health Vector Control, Riverside County Flood Control, the Regional Conservation Authority and the neighborhood's developer, KB Home.\nOne of them was Sheri Fink, 62, a resident of the Monument Ranch. Fink, who attended the meeting with her husband, Barry, modeled the effects of living in the area for the last two months by picking up her right leg.\nThere were scores of tiny blisters, a couple of larger open wounds and a callused scar on one of her toes. Fink said she had been to the doctor three times.\n\"I'm a prisoner in my own home,\" said Fink.\nOther neighbors told stories of dozens of mosquitoes congregating on their window screens, pets covered in bites, and their fears about the toxicity of the spray used by vector control agents to kill the pests.\nPeople at the meeting said they have lived in the area for several years and never seen anything like it. They won't let their children outside to play and can't enjoy a leisurely walk around the neighborhood.\n\"They bite through your clothes,\" said Amy Cisneros, 50, of Monument Park.\nMonument Ranch and Monument Park are neighborhoods along Ethanac and Goetz roads near the San Jacinto River.\nThe problem began in July when a drenching rainstorm left standing water in the retention basins that border the neighborhood.\nDoug Osborn, a vector control official, said that the department has been applying pesticides to the standing water collecting between the river levees, which kills mosquito larvae, and spraying the area, to attack the living mosquitos.\nThe most recent spraying operation occurred earlier Thursday, said Osborn.\nRon Carr, the Perris assistant city manager, said the city has been doing what it can, pumping away standing water left after the late summer and early fall rainstorms.\nBut the residents said it hasn't been enough. Osborn said the mosquitos are typically busiest at dusk and dawn, but people attending the meeting said they are being bitten morning, noon and night.\nOsborn conceded that the situation has serious ramifications. Mosquitos spread West Nile virus and Yellow Fever. According to Osborn, the county has attributed three recent deaths to West Nile virus, and he said that 54 cases have been confirmed in Riverside County.\n1 2 Next Page", "external_links": ["http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/twitter-ico.jpg", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/fb-ico.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nvxuqx-fot781f.jpg", "http://assets.pinterest.com/js/pinmarklet.js?r=", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nvxum0-fotbf00.jpg", "http://s7.addthis.com/js/250/addthis_widget.js#username=YOUR-ACCOUNT-ID", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/mail-ico.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nvxuqx-fot781f.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nvxum0-fotbf00.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T18:19:02.453+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
