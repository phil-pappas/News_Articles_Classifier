Posted: Tuesday, October 13, 2015 5:57 pm | Updated: 7:03 pm, Tue Oct 13, 2015. Bengals undefeated season compares to 1988 Super Bowl-bound team David Wysong | Sports Editor newsrecord.org \nThe Cincinnati Bengals have surprised NFL fans with the team’s 5-0 record thus far this season — a feat Cincinnati has not accomplished since 1988. \nBengals fans were thrilled Sunday after the team beat defending NFC champion, the Seattle Seahawks. Noting the last time this team started a season 5-0 they went to the Super Bowl, there is now much optimism lingering within Cincinnati. \nThis hot start for the Bengals has onlookers comparing the current roster to the 1988 team roster, and there are three glaring comparisons. 1. Andy Dalton vs. Boomer Esiason \nThe most analyzed position on any football team is quarterback and the Bengals current quarterback Andy Dalton is showing serious similarities to Boomer Esiason, Cincinnati’s quarterback of 1988. \nDalton is currently in his fifth NFL season after having a couple impressive years, but held a disappointing 2014 season. \nAfter throwing for nearly 4,300 yards, 30 touchdowns and 20 interceptions in 2013, Dalton struggled in 2014 by throwing from 3,398 yards, 19 touchdowns and 17 interceptions, according to the NFL’s official site. \nIn correlation to Dalton, Esiason was also coming out of a struggling season leading into his fifth NFL season in 1988. \nEsiason passed for 3,321 yards, 16 touchdowns and 19 interceptions in 1987 after passing for almost 4,000 yards, 24 touchdowns and 17 interceptions the year prior, according to pro-football-reference.com . \nThe other eyebrow raising similarity between these two quarterbacks is the closeness in their numbers during both undefeated five-game starts. \nSo far this season, Dalton has passed for 1,518 yards, 11 touchdowns and two interceptions, according to the NFL’s official site. Through Esiason’s first five games in 1988 he passed for 1,372 yards, 12 touchdowns and three interceptions, according to pro-football-reference.com . \nEsiason ended his 1988 season with 3,572 yards, 28 touchdowns, 14 interceptions and won the league’s Most Valuable Player award. \nIt will soon be seen how well Dalton continues his current season play, and whether or not the quarterback will lead the Bengals to Esiason’s same destination back in 1988. 2. 1988 Defense vs. 2015 Defense \nDespite the Bengals’ stout defense through recent years recently, so far 2015 has been average for Cincinnati. \nThis mediocre-level play has matched up well with the performance of the 1988 teams’ defense as well. \nCincinnati has allowed opponents just above 20 points per game thus far in 2015, with the 1988 Bengal team coming in a couple points less at 17.6 points per game, according to the NFL’s official site. \nIn an additional comparison, the amount of yards rewarded by each team through these first five season games averaged out to be a four-yard difference between the two. \nThe 2015 team has allowed 371.2 yards per game with the 1988 team allowing 367 yards per game in the same timespan, according to the NFL’s official site. Another similarity between the two defenses is their play at cornerback. \nIn 2015 the Bengals have an All-Pro corner lined up in Adam Jones, who already has two interceptions for the current season. \nCincinnati also had All-Pro cornerback in Eric Thomas, who led the team during its 1988 season with seven interceptions. 3. Big wins over key opponents \nThe last similarity goes slightly beyond week five for the 1988 Cincinnati Bengal team, but still is worthy of noticing. \nOn Sunday the Bengals beat the Seattle Seahawks, who reached the 2014 Super Bowl but lost to the New England Patriots 28-24, at the team’s home field of Paul Brown Stadium. \nDuring the final regular season game for the 1988 Bengals the team also beat its opponent, the Washington Redskins, at home. The Redskins, too, reached the Super Bowl in the previous year. \nCincinnati beat the Seahawks by three points in overtime after coming back in the fourth quarter to tie up the game.
