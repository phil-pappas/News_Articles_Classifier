I thought we hustled, made a lot of plays and dove for a lot of balls.” \nSenior Jenni Young led the Lady Cougars offense with 11 kills, seven of which came in a second set where Newnan closed on an 8-0 run off of a timeout. \n“We tell the girls we want to win the timeout,” Wilson said. “And we did that.” \nAhead 1-0, back-to-back errors allowed Rockdale County to close within a three-point deficit twice before Wilson called time. On the ensuing point, Ansley Knight came up with a dig that found Young, who quickly set up Callie Bass for a kill and a 18-14 advantage. \nWith Bass closing out the game on serve, Newnan picked up three consecutive points from Knight and Crystal Burk, the latter on two plays from the front line before Rockdale took a timeout of its own. By then, though, it was too late to salvage the second set. \nIt didn’t stop Rockdale from trying to get back in the match in the final game, which see-sawed through five lead changes and five ties before Bass served 10 consecutive points to help instigate a 14-1 Newnan run. \nYoung picked up her final kill for a 23-8 lead and Bass closed it out with Newnan’s final point. \nFive Lady Cougars had kills in game one, including two by Burk and one each from Bass, Knight and Hallie Goolsby. \nBass finished with five kills while Knight and Burk added four and three, respectively. Olivia Masonheimer provided a spark in the middle set with two kills.
