He left the game in the fourth quarter with the outcome sealed.\nNo. 1 Ohio State is 8-0, including 4-0 in the Big Ten as it heads into an off week, after which come the initial College Football Playoff rankings. But Buckeyes will face more formidable opponents than Rutgers (3-4, 1-3).\nOn College Football A regular analytical column looking at the game and business of college football.
