Arizona defeated Ottawa 4-1. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Fred Chartrand \n\"That was real important, especially on a longer road trip,\" said Boedker of snapping the streak. \"We still have two more games on this road trip so I think that was real important for us as a group to show that we can win on the road and we can win tight games and that feels really good.\"\nThe Senators have now lost four straight at home (0-2-2) for the first time since 2006-07.\n\"It wears on you. Fans come and they pay their money and they want to see wins and not 4-1 losses,\" said Bobby Ryan. \"You can't stay in the hunt losing points at home, especially when you're on a homestand and you haven't found a way to get anything out of it.\"\nSenators coach Dave Cameron is at a loss to explain what ails his team right now.\n\"As a coach you look for indicators,\" said Cameron. \"You look for the practice, you look for how they're carrying themselves, you look for how they are at the meetings when you're preparing them, for signs that they're not into it. I didn't see any of that.\"\nCameron felt that from the start his team showed very little interest in competing and can't understand why.\nWith three days off before hosting the Calgary Flames Wednesday you can bet Cameron will do his best to figure things out.\nBrad Richardson, with the eventual winner, also scored for the Coyotes (4-3-1). Anders Lindback made 35 saves in his first start of the season.\nCody Ceci scored the lone goal for the Senators (3-3-2) as Craig Anderson stopped 22-of-25 shots in defeat.\n\"Losing is not fun,\" said Anderson. \"Hopefully we can learn from some of our mistakes and we can move forward.\"\nThere was little to get excited about for the 17,270 on hand at Canadian Tire Centre.\nRichardson broke a 1-1 tie at the 14:31 mark of the third when he dove for the puck while lying on the ice and was able to get it behind Anderson, who made the initial save.\nBad communication by the Senators allowed Boedker to score his second of the night just over one minute later to take a 3-1 lead and he added his third into an empty net with less than three minutes to play in regulation.\n\"I think we just get too down on ourselves when we give up a goal late in the game,\" said Ceci. \"You definitely can't give up another one right away like that because we're really deflated and running all over the place and playing out of position. It's too bad the way it happened and it's been happening too much lately.\"\nBoth teams had a couple good chances in the first, but nothing overly challenging for the starting goaltenders.\nArizona opened the scoring with just over one minute remaining in the first period when Boedker was able to slip behind Erik Karlsson and beat Anderson glove side.\nCeci scored his first of the season as he took a great pass from Bobby Ryan, who had eight shots on goal, and beat Lindback shortside to tie the game 1-1 late in the second period.\nThe Senators played the final two periods without Curtis Lazar. Lazar went face first into the corner boards on a hit from Zbynek Michalek in the first period. He took a few more shifts, but didn't come out for the remainder of the game.\nNotes: Max McCormick made his NHL debut with the Senators after being called up to replace Mike Hoffman, who is out day-to-day with a lower-body injury. D Marc Methot was a late scratch despite saying he would play in the morning. LW Clarke MacArthur didn't play (concussion, out indefinitely). The Coyotes were without C Antoine Vermette (upper-body, day-to-day) and D Stefan Elliott.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T23:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T11:13:15.959+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
