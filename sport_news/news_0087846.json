Shirley still finished in 5:45. \nThe fast track to success has continued. After taking sixth at last year’s Class 1A state cross country meet, the Frankfort sophomore has established himself as one of the favorites for the title this year. \nIn Frankfort’s first five meets this year, Shirley has posted four victories — taking titles at Marysville, Onaga, Centralia and last Saturday’s Riley County Invitational. The only race he didn’t win was the prestigious Wamego Invitational where he finished behind Olpe’s Kyler True (defending 2A state champion) and Zach Nuessen (sixth at state) in the Class 3-2-1A race. \n“I kind of thought he was going to do this well,” Frankfort coach Tom Schroeder said. “He put in a lot of time over the summer, went to a camp and took what he learned there and applied it to the course. His dedication is amazing, I’ve never worked with a kid like him before.” \nLike Shirley, Schroeder had a pretty good idea just how good Shirley could be early on. As an eighth-grader, Shirley set the Twin Valley League’s record in the two-mile. \nRemember, this is a league that has produced some of the state’s best small-school distance runners in the past few years, namely Centralia’s Lucas Koch, an eight-time state track and one-time cross country champion, and Washington County’s Dylan Hodgson, a multi-time state champion. Both TVL alums are running in the Big 12 with Koch at Kansas State and Hodgson at Kansas. \nThrow in former Frankfort standout Adam Koch, a four-time, top-seven state placer, and Shirley has had plenty of local influence on his budding career. \n“I had those guys to look up to when I was younger and hope you can be as good as them at some point. That’s helped a lot because it shows me what a good time is and realize I need to put work in to reach their times.” \nTruth be told, Shirley would like to work even harder than he has. But he’s been hampered for much of the past few seasons by Sever’s Disease, also known as calcaneal apophysitis and essentially is an inflammation of the growth plate in the heel where the bone is growing faster than the muscle around it. \n“Having growth pains not allowed me to train as hard as I wanted to,” Shirley said. “I’ve had to be careful the past few years so I can make sure I can run the entire season. It’s a good sign I’m growing so I can train as hard as I want to.” \nIndeed, Shirley has grown this year. As a freshman, he stood a mere 4-foot-10 and weighed just 75 pounds. He’s now up to 5-1, 85 pounds. \nHis physical stature may not create an imposing figure. But Frankfort foes have quickly learned there’s plenty of punch packed into Shirley’s small frame. \n“He probably surprised a few people last year,” Schroeder said, “but not any more.” \nShirley now has his sights set on finishing off his season just as strong, starting with Thursday’s Twin Valley League meet at Centralia. Shirley was runner-up to Hodgson a year ago at league, and then took second at regionals to eventual state champion Caden Callaway of Pike Valley before finishing sixth at state. \nFour of the five runners that finished ahead of him at state a year ago were seniors with Ashland’s Quanah Gardiner the lone underclassman to beat him, taking fourth. \nBut if Shirley can duplicate his performance from earlier this season at Wamego where he ran a 16:45, he could be tough to beat. That mark would easily be a school record for Frankfort, which Schroeder said is based on state-meet performances. Koch holds the record at 17:17. \n“I’m hoping to win state and run a 16:25 or so,” Shirley said. “That might be pushing it. But I’m running the times this year I was hoping to run before the season started, so my success was kind of expected. I wasn’t sure how everyone else would run, so I really concentrated on setting times and trying to hit those. I figured if I did that, I’d do pretty well.” \nCROSS COUNTRY \n■ Pleasant Ridge’s Luke Oatney edged Tonganoxie’s Drew Cook by five seconds for the boys’ title at the Pleasant Ridge Invitational, winning in 16:33. Atchison’s Sarah Jaloma also had a three-second win for the girls’ crown over Perry-Lecompton’s Lexia Jamison, winning in 20:05. \n■ Silver Lake’s Jacob Gerber ran away with the boys’ title at the Osage City Invitational with his time of 17:57 39 seconds faster than runner-up Dallin Bailey of West Franklin. Anderson County’s Averi Wilson took the girls title in 20:19, beating Santa Fe Trail’s Hannah Honeyman by 25 seconds. \n■ Baldwin swept all four crowns at the Sabetha Invitational, sweeping the team and individual titles. George Letner led a 1-2-3 Bulldog finish in the boys race, winning in 15:51 which was nearly a minute faster than teammate Parker Wilson. The Bulldog girls also swept the top-three spots as Addie Dick won in 19:21, more than a minute ahead of teammate Mackenzie Russell. \nVOLLEYBALL \n■ In improving to 33-2 overall, Silver Lake clinched at least a share of the Mid-East League title with a Tuesday sweep of Wabaunsee, winning 25-21, 25-16 and 25-6, 25-15. \n■ Waverly fought off Olpe 20-25, 25-20, 25-14 and then downed Hartford 25-19, 25-7 to conclude a perfect 7-0 run in Lyon County League play. \n■ Valley Falls clinched at least a share of the Northeast Kansas League title with a sweep of McLouth and Immaculata on Tuesday. The Dragons are 14-0 in league play, two games ahead of Maur Hill, and 31-3 overall. \n■ Abilene enjoyed a big week, capturing the title at the Council Grove Invitational and then finishing off an undefeated North Central Kansas League title with a Tuesday sweep of Clay Center. The Cowgirls went 5-0 at Council Grove, beating Clearwater 25-21, 25-23 in the finals. Jessica Hayes was named tourney MVP and had 66 kills. A 25-20, 25-19 and 25-19, 25-17 sweep of Clay Center capped Abilene’s 10-0 league run. \n■ A 25-22, 25-20 and 25-9, 25-18 sweep of Perry-Lecompton earned Nemaha Central the Big Seven League title. The Thunder finished league play 15-1, the lone loss coming to Jefferson West. \n■ Council Grove swept Chase County on Tuesday to finish off a 14-0 run through the Flint Hills League. The Braves dropped the first game of the first match 26-24, but rallied to win the next two 25-12, 25-21 and then pulled out a 25-21, 26-24 win in the second match to cap the undefeated league season. \n■ Atchison won the Kansas City-Atchison League title, sweeping KC Washington on Monday to finish 10-0 in league play. \n■ Axtell and Centralia shared the Twin Valley League regular season title, each finishing 11-1 in league play. Centralia will be the top seed at Saturday’s league tournament thanks to a head-to-head win over the Eagles. \nTENNIS \n■ Marysville’s Shelby Downard and Madison Neiberding captured the doubles title at the Class 3-2-1A regional at Maranatha, beating KC Christian’s Callie Eldred and Alexis Termini 6-4, 6-0 in the finals. The Bulldogs also got a second from Rachel Frese in singles and fourth from the doubles team of Holly Holthaus and Avery Williams. \n■ Sabetha also qualified two doubles teams and a singles player for state from the Maranatha regional. Nicole Brey and Jenna Winkler took third and Laura Edelman and Savanna Metzger were sixth in doubles and Lexi Wegner was third in singles. \n■ Clay Center’s Hannah Callan and Chloe Gaug finished second and third, respectively, in singles at the Class 4A regional at Smoky Valley, each suffering their first loss of the season at the regional. Chapman’s Jessie Heiman and Katy Fink were fifth in doubles and Abilene’s Belle Barbieri and Sam Reiff took sixth. \n■ Emporia’s Ashley DeBauge qualified for state in both tennis and golf, taking third in singles at the Spartans’ 5A tennis regional and seventh at the golf regional. \nGOLF \n■ Silver Lake secured its eighth straight state berth, taking second at the Class 3-2-1A regional at Herington Country Club. Jordan Sharpe shot a 90 to win the regional title by six shots over St. Marys’ Madalyn Kleinsmith and Council Grove’s Jordan Carlson and the Eagles posted a team score of 439 to finish 13 shots behind Council Grove. Rossville’s Emily Woodcock and Jessica Sowers, West Franklin’s Jessica Carlson and Osage City’s Courtney Cooley and Kailyn Robert earned individual berths from the regional. \n■ Holton’s Quinn Holaday posted a career-best 93 to earn an individual state berth from the Class 4A regional at Village Greens Golf Course. Clay Center’s Erica Alquist also qualified individually. \nBrent Maycock can be reached at (785) 295-5662 or brent.maycock@cjonline.com .Follow Brent on Twitter @CockyHawk91 .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T22:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T23:26:09.472+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
