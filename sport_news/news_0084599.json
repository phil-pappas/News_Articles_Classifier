This week, the same. \nLast week, Blair Oaks had an 8-4 edge in first downs. This week, it was 8-6. \nAnd last week, the Falcons had a 536-76 edge in total yardage. This week, it was 436-80. \n“Give credit to the kids, it would have been real easy to come out here and run around a little bit, thinking last week was going to dictate the outcome of this week’s game, and they didn’t do that,” Blair Oaks head coach Terry Walker said. “I think the kids understand, certainly the seniors do, that there’s a finality to the season now. We’re just hopeful we can keep moving forward and getting better.” \nThe game was the opener of Class 3 District 6 play, and the top-seeded Falcons (10-0) now move into the semifinals to face Eldon at 7 p.m. Friday at the Falcon Athletic Complex. Eldon, the fifth seed, advanced with a 56-33 win at fourth-seeded Owensville. \nFor the second straight week, the Falcons were in the 30s by the end of one quarter. After a 35-point frame to start things last week, Blair Oaks was ahead 30-0 after one period Friday night. \nJake Van Ronzelen got things started for the Falcons, ripping off an 18-yard scoring run. Cody Alexander added the first of two straight 2-point runs and Blair Oaks led 8-0 at the 8:24 mark. \nThen with 7:02 left in the period, a 14-yard touchdown run by C.J. Closser made it 16-0. \nThe next touchdown came on a 31-yard pass from Jordan Hair to Adam Schell. John Karsten, who was 5-of-8 on PATs, booted the extra point to make it 23-0 with 5:36 left. \nThe final score of the first quarter came on a 55-yard run by Closser to push the lead to 30-0. \nThe lone tally of the second period was a 40-yard touchdown pass from Nolan Hair to Ethan Luebbering to gave the Falcons a 37-0 lead at halftime. \nAgain like last week, the entire second half was played with a running clock due to the mercy rule. It didn’t hamper the Falcons’ ability to score, as Blair Oaks had four touchdowns in the third quarter and another in the fourth. \nWith just 44 seconds gone in the second half, Schell ripped off a 51-yard scoring run that ran the lead to 43-0. \nAn 8-yard run by Nolan Hair at the 7:51 mark and a 41-yard run by Sam Dudenhoeffer with 3:45 left put the score at 56-0. \nThe final score in the third came when Closser returned an interception 47 yards with just 19 seconds remaining. \nBrayden Pritchett capped off the scoring with a 13-yard touchdown run with 7:55 left in the game. \nThe Falcons ended up with 311 yards rushing on 29 carries, led by Closser’s 69 yards on two carries. Jordan Hair completed 3-of-3 passes for 57 yards and one touchdown before Nolan Hair finished up by going 3-of-3 for 68 yards and one touchdown. \nThe Blair Oaks defense completely shut down the Versailles rushing attack, as the Tigers netted minus-4 yards on 24 carries. Versailles completed 14-of-27 passes for 84 yards, but threw interceptions to Closser, Van Ronzelen and Brenden Brown. \nThe Tigers end the season with a record of 3-7. \nFollow News Tribune sports reporter Tony Hawley (@tony_hawley) on Twitter for updates during games. ﻿", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T07:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T12:27:18.581+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
