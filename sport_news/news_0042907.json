As Iowa State’s newest point guard, Buckley is aiming to add her picture to the elite list.\nBuckley will have big shoes to fill as she takes over as the starting point guard this season.\n“It’s her job right now and it’s her team to lead and I have great confidence she can do that,” coach Bill Fennelly said during the team's media day Thursday afternoon.\nBuckley, a 5-foot-8, redshirt sophomore, will take over for Nikki Moody, who finished her career at Iowa State as one of the best point guards in school history. Moody, a four-year starter, averaged 14.5 points and 6.8 assists per game last season and became Iowa State’s all-time assists leader.\n\"This is the first year in a long time where we don't have an incumbent point guard that you know is really, really good,\" Fennelly said.\nWith Moody now gone, the attention now shifts to Buckley, a guard who has played on and off the ball at times during her Iowa State career. The Mason City native burst onto the scene during the 2013-14 campaign when she averaged 10.9 points, 3.3 assists, and 2.3 rebounds in 31 games, including 28 starts, as a freshman.\nAny hopes of an encore the following season were shut down when Buckley was shut down after nine games due to a stress injury in her right foot. Buckley, who averaged 9.4 points, 2.8 rebounds, and 2.3 assists while she was playing, received a medical redshirt for the season.\nThe season was full of trials and tribulations for Buckley who dealt with the physical pain of the injury as well as the mental demons of not being able to play.\n“I think a big thing was coaches and coach Fennelly telling me to look at the bigger picture,” Buckley said. “For me, I was only focusing on that season or that Saturday’s game.”\nThe picture is now clear for Buckley, who is healthy and ready to roll in her new role. In fact, those pictures of the players that she passes by routinely have become an inspiration for her.\n“He (Fennelly) always brings up in practice and in games stuff like that, things that they did and that’s something you want to live up to because they left a legacy so you want to leave a legacy, too,” Buckley said.\nThe idea that Buckley’s picture could end up on the wall isn’t out of the question.\n“If you look at that wall in there, it’s full of great point guards and I honestly believe Jadda Buckley could be the next one,” Fennelly said.\nTime will tell. But, so far, the move has gone well.\n“She’s bought into it,” said Iowa State guard Seanna Johnson. “She’s been doing pretty good in practice.”\nBuckley credits watching Moody as a learning experience. She said Moody’s ability to adjust on the fly is one of the big things she took away.\n“Plays break down during games so you have to go to other options and I think that was something that she was very strong in and that’s where I learned from her a lot,” Buckley said.\nBuckley realizes that there is still lots to learn. But she understands what her coaches were talking about when they told her to see the bigger picture when she was hurt.\n“I have a lot of work ahead of me, though, and I have a lot of basketball knowledge that I need to intake to get on one of those walls and next to one of those other girls but it’s always a dream,” Buckley said. “You’ve always got to dream.”\nBREAKING DOWN THE CYCLONES\nCoach : Bill Fennelly, 600-259 overall, 166-53 at Iowa State\nLast season : 18-13 (9-9 in conference), lost in opening round of the Big 12 Conference Tournament and opening round of the NCAA Tournament.\nKey departures : Nikki Moody (14.5 points per game, 6.8 assists per game), Brynn Williamson (11.6 ppg., 1.0 apg., and 6.3 rpg), and Fallon Ellis (5.2 ppg., 1.1 apg., and 4.2 rpg.).\nKey newcomers : Bridget Carleton (Chatham, Ontario, Canada), TeeTee Starks (Brooklyn Park, Minn.), and Meredith Burkhall (Des Moines).\n2015-16 SCHEDULE\nNovember— 5: vs. Midwestern State (exhibition); 8: vs. Concordia St. Paul (exhibition); 13: vs. Hampton; 15: at Drake; 22: vs. New Orleans; 26: vs. Texas State (at Cancun Challenge); 27: vs. Duke (at Cancun Challenge); 28: vs. Idaho (at Cancun Challenge).\nDecember —2: at Northern Iowa; 6: vs. Southern; 11: vs. Iowa; 13: vs. Arkansas-Pine Bluff; 20: vs. Alcorn State; 22: vs. Northern Arizona; 30: at Kansas State.\nJanuary —2: vs. Oklahoma State; 6: at Texas; 9: vs. Kansas; 17: at Texas Tech; 20: at Oklahoma State; 23: vs. Baylor; 27: vs. Texas Christian; 30: vs. Oklahoma.\nFebruary —2: at Kansas; 6: vs. Texas; 10: at West Virginia; 13: at Texas Christian; 17: vs. Texas Tech; 20: at Baylor; 24: vs. Kansas State; 27: at Oklahoma.\nMarch —1: vs. West Virginia; 4-7: Big 12 Conference Tournament at Oklahoma City, OKla.\nIOWA STATE WOMEN’S ROSTER\nLexi Albrecht (5-10, jr.).
