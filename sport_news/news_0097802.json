I think they’ll be just fine with that.\nBut it won’t be Aldridge who determines whether the grand experiment is successful and leads the Spurs to a sixth NBA championship this season. It will come down to whether Tony Parker, one of the foundations of the Spurs dynasty, can remain a pillar of strength for the franchise.\nLaMarcus Aldridge and Tim Duncan Photo: Getty Images It wasn’t long ago Parker was at the peak of his powers. He was the engine driving the Spurs to the brink of a title in 2013, leading France to a Eurobasket championship that summer then helping the Spurs claim a fifth title the following season.\nBut Parker is in a dangerous period for any small guard, having turned 33 in May. Last season, he began to show signs of the epic amount of wear and tear he’s placed on his body over the past 15 years. His stats dropped significantly (except for posting a career-best 3-point shooting percentage, which at least for now has to be considered an anomaly). Perhaps the most telling number was his free throw attempts per game dropping to 2.4 – half of what he averaged in 2012-13, arguably his best season. It’s a sign Parker has lost enough of a step that he’s unable to penetrate into the lane like in seasons past.\nThe genius in watching Parker always has been his tremendous speed and athleticism with the ball. Parker was never an explosive athlete in the way Russell Westbrook and John Wall are, guys who sprint up the court with the ball looking like they’re competing in the 100-meter dash. But Parker was always an exceptionally creative player, who would come around a screen, quickly accelerate into the lane to create some separation from his defender and toss up his patented little floater that dropped into the basket.\nNot including last season’s effort from behind the arc, Parker never has been a strong perimeter shooter. He’s needed his ability to create space with his quickness and agility. If that is beginning to go away, his game is in trouble.\nRussell Westbrook is the type of player that could cause Parker fits.

While Manu Ginobili has slowed down in recent years, San Antonio has leaned more and more on Kawhi Leonard to take on the bulk of the work load on the wings at both ends. Tim Duncan has essentially turned himself into a human metronome, but now the Spurs can use Aldridge as the fulcrum of their offense.\nPatty Mills is an effective spark plug off the bench, not a player capable of running an offense near the level Parker has during his career – especially not if he’s going up against Westbrook, Stephen Curry, Chris Paul or Mike Conley in a postseason series.\nThat’s why San Antonio is banking on last season being an outlier, and Parker – like Duncan before him – withstanding the tests of time and giving them an outstanding season as they go for yet another championship. If last season was the beginning of a new normal for the French legend, you can kiss the Spurs’ championship chances goodbye.\n  lamarcus aldridge ,  nba ,  san antonio spurs ,  tim duncan ,  tony parker", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T15:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T20:00:39.898+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
