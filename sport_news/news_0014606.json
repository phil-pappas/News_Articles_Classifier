The Vikings finished first and the Lady Vikings placed sixth overall. \nEast Coweta and Newnan split individual accolades on Saturday. Newnan senior Mary Douglass Hallman captured the girls title for the Lady Cougars, while Indians senior Matthew Shumake led the boys race. \nIn JV events, Newnan won the girls event. \nAll three schools continue to prepare for upcoming region meets starting next week. The Region 4- meet, hosted by Starr’s Mill, will take place at Heritage Christian Church in Fayetteville on Saturday. \nNewnan will host the 3- meet on Oct. 31 at the Newnan Utilities reservoir near Carl Miller Park while joined by East Coweta. \nOfficial results of Saturday’s Coweta Cup were unavailable at deadline.
