Its discovery was announced in a paper published online by PLOS One.\nYale University biologist Gisella Caccione led the investigation that identified the new species, which lives on Santa Cruz island.\nThe discovery will help protect and restore the tortoise, which is vulnerable as its numbers are estimated at 250, said Washington Tapia, head of giant tortoise conservation at Galapagos National Park.\nThat compares to more than 2,000 of the other species living on a different part of the island, Chelonidis porteri.\nThe new species was christened Chelonoidis donfaustoi after longtime park ranger and conservationist Fausto Llerena.\nTapia said scientists had long suspected that the species was different given that its shell was less dome-like.\nThe scientists said they suspected Chelonoidis donfaustoi was introduced on Santa Cruz at one point from a different island.\nThe unique flora and fauna of the Galapagos inspired naturalist Charles Darwin.\n___\nCorrects in paragraph 3 that tortoises live on Santa Cruz island, not Santa Catalina.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T05:36:20.213+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
