He said there is scientific evidence that the worst heavy rain events are increasing, \"but I am not sure you can conclusively link this event.\"\nFloodwaters break through a raised walkway in Columbia, S.C.

The 1861-62 floods were the worst in the recorded history of California.\nShepherd said storm-water management engineering may be behind the times, potentially exacerbating floods like that in South Carolina.\nGiven the vast size of the USA, it shouldn't be that surprising for extreme flooding to occur somewhere, Weather Underground meteorologist Bob Henson said in an e-mail. \"Even very rare events do happen on a very limited basis when you're looking at a large area such as the United States,\" he said. \"It's not hard to imagine getting 1-in-1000 year events at scattered locations over a few years' time.\"\nIt's also possible that the ongoing El Niño event, which has intensified throughout 2015, has played a role in boosting the amount of water vapor available for heavy rain across the southern U.S., Henson added.\nEl Niño is a natural climate pattern in which warmer-than-average Pacific Ocean temperatures change weather patterns around the world. Rain and snow from El Nino would help ease California's record drought.\nSome parts of South Carolina received more rain in the past few days than some parts of California have seen in the past three years, according to AccuWeather.\nBREAKING: A pastor from a church in Summerville pulls an unearthed casket out of the flood waters in Ridgeville pic.twitter.com/vtOYRUQMJo\n— Matt Alba
