Thus ends the October stretch with the November gauntlet of four SEC West opponents.\nThe last thing LSU wants to do is get ahead of itself. Western Kentucky at 6-1 is a serious opponent and should get SEC-level attention. Waiting for LSU after next's week's open date is Alabama in Tuscaloosa.\nScroll down for 5 things to know about Saturday's game, which kicks off at 6:02 p.m. CT on ESPNU. Here are times of interest for a schedule of events and a position-by-position game breakdown . Here are Leonard Fournette's approaching milestones against Western Kentucky .\nAnd away we go:\nHandle with care\nThe season started with people worried about the health of defensive players attempting to tackle Leonard Fournette. Now protection is being sought for Fournette? I think the whole thing got a little out of hand last week, not so much the hitting but the reaction. I wasn't at the bottom of the pile with Leonard and he did say there was quite a bit of grabbing and eye-poking going on, but that's football and I'm sure every LSU runner from Fournette to Doc Fenton has had a foe take liberties with contact. He did get a little frustrated on a couple of occasions, shoving back at Florida tacklers. Fournette admitted to being hit \"downstairs\" vs. Syracuse earlier this season.\nLSU should be wary of Western Kentucky | Vlog LSU beat writer Jim Kleinpeter and columnist Ron Higgins look ahead to the Tigers game with Western kentucky\nThere weren't any visibly dangerous hits last week, people trying to take out Fournette's knees, at least he didn't mention any. His facemask got pulled once and it was flagged, but nullified by an LSU penalty on the same play. Mostly it was pushing him backward past the whistle, although never once was he thrown to the ground after one of those scrums. But activity after the whistle does have to be nipped in the bud and that's likely what Les Miles was doing.\nPutting the thought into the heads of officiating crews before it becomes an issue could benefit LSU and Fournette in the long run, and save an unnecessary injury. I'm sure Miles will have a chat and address this subject with each officiating crew for the remainder of the year, and keep compiling his list of \"Greatest Hits on Leonard Fournette.\"\nWhat about ME?\nBrandon Harris was visibly worked after LSU's victory against Florida up about being \"dissed\" in the media. Not him specifically, but the continued talk of how LSU's passing game isn't carrying its weight and drags down the Tigers' offense is getting under his skin. Don't look at me, I've been singing his praises for the past several weeks. It's the national media, ESPN to be exact, and it has Harris saying he's playing with a chip on his shoulder.\nIn his last two games, he is 31 for 47 for 430 yards and four touchdowns, still no interceptions, so he has a point. The problem is as long as Fournette is around there will be this perception that Harris is riding in the Fournette motorcycle side car. It still hasn't completely sunk in how much of a team game this is and it shows the difference between the two star players.\nLSU QB Brandon Harris: I play every game 'with a chip on my shoulder' | Video LSU quarterback Brandon Harris talks to the media after LSU's victory against Florida.\nHarris is a precociously talented player with a precocious personality. He actually has more charisma than Fournette, who is more mature and used to handling attention. He brushes it all off and is always talking up the team. Whether or not he really means it is beside the point. He knows what he is expected to say.\nHarris is just getting started and although he has come a long way, he's showing signs of still being thin-skinned. It's not all bad. He wants badly to win and be a great player. But right now, and through next year, it's Leonard Fournette's team, barring an injury.\nHarris is learning how to play the quarterback position and how to act like the quarterback. In my mind's eye I can see Les Miles wince when he sees a video of Harris and the tone of his words. If he keeps putting up numbers like the last two weeks, his verbal bouquets will come.\nSilence is golden\nThe biggest fail last Saturday was the not-much-anticipated battle between the LSU and Florida secondaries for which is the real DBU. This time we had two losers as receivers ran wide open all over the field all night long on both sides. The title belt is back up for grabs among 127 secondaries nationwide. At least LSU should finally shut up about it.\nThe secondary started the season as the perceived strength of the team and it has been underperformed only by special teams. The LSU defense line has been excellent and the linebackers, although thin in depth, have played very well. But LSU has allowed 11 touchdown passes in six games, nearly two per game. Receivers are so wide open they seem to have walked off the sidelines. LSU is allowing a decent 205 yards passing per game, No. 6 in the SEC, but the busts are leading to touchdowns.\nLSU DB Jalen Mills happy to be back in action | Video LSU defensive back Jalen Mills talks to the media about playing his first game back from injury.\nBoth touchdowns last week went to Florida tight end Jake McGee, who was uncovered from start to finish. It's likely he was the responsibility of one of the safeties, either Rickey Jefferson or Jamal Adams. Jalen Mills' return to health could be the blessing LSU needs to eradicate this recurring flaw. His cover skills are better than Jefferson's and he's the most experienced member on the entire defense with 39 starts entering the season.\nThis group is going to be tested severely and if it has some pride, it would be a good time to respond. Their troubles have not escaped unnoticed. LSU's cornerbacks Tre'Davious White and Kevin Toliver have been very good all season with man-to-man coverage. Zone defense is trickier and the switch to Kevin Steele as defensive coordinator might be playing a role. The halfway point in the season is too deep for this much confusion.\nSpecial delivery\nSpecial teams is that part of football fans take for granted and coaches harp on. Les Miles never leaves it out when breaking down his team -- offense, defense and special teams. I like to compare this season to 2011 when LSU had a dominant defense and special teams that set up a weak offense game-after-game.\nThis year's version of special teams is springing leaks all over. Kicking off and the coverage of kickoffs has been fraught with error. Punting and punt coverage has also been a minus, and the latest issue. Tre'Davious White just doesn't seem to get it when it comes to fielding punts. The return teams, even with White having a 69-yarder for a TD vs. Syracuse, have been otherwise quiet.\nLSU LB Deion Jones discusses defense, Western Kentucky matchup Jones, Dwayne Thomas, Lewis Neal, Tigers preparing for Hilltoppers' vertical passing attack\nDon't blame it all on special teams coach Bradley Dale Peveto, although this array of special teams issues suggests an overall lack of attention to detail. His main focus is to coach linebackers. Special teams have to be coached and the players have to understand the nuances and there isn't enough time or coaching bodies to do it justice.\nLes Miles said that was the focus during the past week, not so much making changes but a refresher course in responsibilities and even he was getting involved with it. Kickoffs are better now that Cameron Gamble is the guy. But there is some physical limitation with Keehn that Miles referred to in vague terms on Monday.\nMiles is convinced Keehn will work it out but he has struggled all season. The punt coverage issue that allowed a 72-yard return to Florida last week was partly his fault for locating it in the middle of the field. This could be the problem that sinks LSU in 2015.\nTip of the hat\nBrandon Harris won't like this but he isn't even the best quarterback named Brandon on the field Saturday. Western Kentucky's Brandon Doughty is having a huge season statistically and appears to have the necessary tools to make it at the next level. His arm isn't super strong but he has a quick release, quick feet to move around in the pocket and fearlessness.\nHis accuracy this year has been astounding, leading the nation with a 74.1 completion percentage. That's hard enough to do against air. He has passed for 2,709 yards and 24 touchdowns with only four interceptions. Last year he threw for 4,830 yards and 49 touchdowns with 10 interceptions while completing 68 percent of his passes. He's using a sixth year of eligibility after suffering season-ending injuries in 2011 and 2012. LSU has a tall order.\nLes Miles: Western Kentucky has LSU's 'attention' | Video LSU coach Les Miles talks to the media on Wednesday about playing Western Kentucky\nHe's not a runner but the fact that he's been sacked only seven times is a testament to his ability to get rid of the ball quickly. He has the right measurable at 6-foot-3 and 210 pounds and his arm is plenty strong enough. He does have a history of knee injuries and could be a bargain in next year's NFL draft. LSU probably hasn't seen a non-conference quarterback this good in Tiger Stadium since Ben Roethlisberger played for Miami of Ohio in 2002. LSU football fans will hopefully be like their baseball brethren and cheer the guy at the end of the game.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T15:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T17:35:25.561+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
