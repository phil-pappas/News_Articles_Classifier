The leg before decision was reviewed by the opener but the umpire's call was upheld. \nUp until that point, it had been Pakistan making untroubled progress on a sedate pitch after opting to bat first and England doing their best to throw away any rare chance which came their way. \nFor the second session, a momentary lapse of judgement cost England a wicket as Stuart Broad's overstepping in his first over back after lunch cost him the wicket of Shoaib Malik, who was unbeaten on 72 at the tea interval. \nThe no-ball call, after the Pakistani number three had edged to Joe Root at gully, was marginal and only came down after the third umpire spotted it after numerous looks on the slow-motion replay. \nIt was the second life given to a Pakistani batsman after Ian Bell at second slip had dropped a simple chance offered by Hafeez when the opener was on seven. \nIn hot conditions and on a pitch offering very little assistance to bowlers, England will surely rue not taking their chances as Pakistan can look towards building a dominant total. \nSuch sloppiness from the visitors should not take away from Hafeez, who otherwise batted with ease until his exit just before tea. \nHe had used his feet well against debutant spinner Adil Rashid, and scored all around the wicket in a partnership of 168 with Malik. \nThe pair had come together after a bizarre dismissal of Shan Masood, bowled off the side of his helmet after being surprised by a short ball from James Anderson after making just two. \n(Reporting by David French; Editing by Amlan Chakraborty ) \nOur top photos from the last 24 hours.
