USA Today Sports Iowa State quarterback Sam Richardson, scrambling for yardage Saturday against Texas Tech defensive lineman Branden Jackson, was picked off three times in a 66-31 loss to the Red Raiders in Lubbock. Most Popular The Sports Xchange October 10, 2015 | 11:48 pm \nLUBBOCK, Texas — Texas Tech quarterback Patrick Mahomes consistently flummoxed the Iowa State defense, leading the Red Raiders to a 66-31 Big 12 Conference football victory Saturday at Jones AT&T Stadium. \nMahomes passed for 428 yards and five touchdowns as the Red Raiders posted 776 yards of total offense. \nIowa State (2-3, 1-1 Big 12) managed 495 yards of offense, but could not keep up with Tech (4-2, 1-2). The Red Raiders intercepted Cyclones quarterback Sam B. Richardson three times and won the turnover battle, 3-0. \n“He’s a mighty fine quarterback,” Iowa State Coach Paul Rhoads said of Mahomes, who completed 33 of 46 passes for 428 yards and did not throw an interception. \nIowa State freshman running back Mike Warren rushed for 245 yards on 23 carries, but did not score. \nWarren is the first Cyclone back to eclipse 200 rushing yards since Ennis Haywood in 2001 and already has established a single-season freshman record with 574 yards this season. The 245 yards also rank eighth on the ISU single-game charts. \nTexas Tech built a 24-point lead in the first half as Mahomes threw touchdown passes of 75 and 37 yards to receiver Jakeem Grant and also hit running back DeAndre Washington for a 49-yard touchdown and Reginald Davis for a 33-yard score. \nGrant caught nine passes for 166 yards and two touchdowns as the Red Raiders snapped a two-game losing streak. \n“I thought we played better, obviously,” Texas Tech Coach Kliff Kingsbury said of his offense, which recorded a modern era, school-record 776 yards. “The biggest deal to me was the turnovers. ... But if we protect the ball, we’ll be in every game. That’s what we did and we gave ourselves a chance.” \nIowa State stayed within striking distance. Warren rushed for 133 yards in the first half and set up two touchdowns with runs of 46 and 51 yards into Texas Tech territory. \nRichardson threw an interception on his first throw of the game, but also hit receiver Quenton Bundrage for a 33-yard touchdown for the Cyclones’ first score. \nTexas Tech took a 38-21 lead to halftime after posting 465 total yards in the first and second quarters. \nRhoads put Joel Lanning in at quarterback late in the game, but said it was just to get him some meaningful reps. “Sam was not having one of his better days ... we wanted to get (Lanning) some snaps,” he said. \nRichardson completed 10 of 21 passes for 139 yards and Lanning hit on 5 of 9 passes for 41. Bundrage finished with three catches for 75 yards.
