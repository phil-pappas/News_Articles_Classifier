It’s the type of look Bill Belichick was hoping to create, and his defense pressed all the right buttons.\nIt took away all of Weeden’s security blankets and left him alone to try and make something happen. Maybe Tony Romo could find a spark in that scenario. But not the backup. Not Weeden, clearly, after a 30-6 cakewalk at AT&T Stadium.\nBelichick and defensive coordinator Matt Patricia wanted to take away the two elements that could cause them trouble. Tight end Jason Witten, and the potential of the Cowboys running it down their throats.\nWell, Witten finished with five catches for 33 yards, and the Pats got the best of the offensive line everyone raves about.\nThey hit all the marks and checkpoints, leaving Weeden to look like a bad backup. He couldn’t even hit an open Terrance Williams in garbage time to salvage at least one score. The Pats had him that befuddled.\nGranted, it was a little like taking candy from a baby, this Cowboys offense was without Romo and star receiver Dez Bryant. That shouldn’t completely diminish, though, what the defense accomplished yesterday.\nFor a team that’s had some difficulty covering tight ends, the Pats made Witten a non factor. They did so by first having defensive lineman Jabaal Sheard jam him at the line in the allowed 5-yard zone to make sure he wasn’t getting a free release. That disrupted any kind of timing on short routes. Then it was a collective effort from there, be it Jamie Collins, Patrick Chung or Devin McCourty.\n“That was the game plan. We knew he’s a future Hall of Famer. That offense goes through him, particularly the passing game,” said safety Duron Harmon. “One of our goals was to eliminate him, take him out of the game. I think we did a decent job of that.”\nAdded McCourty: “I think everyone knows from watching us through the years, we are always going to try to take away teams’ best players. Obviously, he is one of the best tight ends to play the game. . . . At times, we did a good job, just not letting him be that go-to-guy, and keep catching big catches and moving the chains.”\nAll five of Witten’s catches came in the second half, many of those with the game well in the Patriots’ hands. Collins, who was a force in just about every aspect, also forced Witten to fumble one of those catches for a turnover in the fourth quarter.\n“It was a collective effort. We knew one person couldn’t stop a player of that caliber,” said Harmon. “We had to try different things, put different people on him, give him different looks, just to mess with the quarterback and try to make him go away from him.”\nMission accomplished. They messed with Weeden, all right.\nThey also took away his running game. While the final line may read a collective 100 yards for the Cowboys, again, a lot of that was in garbage time. The Pats stuffed Dallas at pretty much all the key junctures. Lead back Joseph Randle rushed for 60 yards on 15 carries, while Darren McFadden had 16 yards on five carries.\n“The coaches did a good job of getting us prepared for it, getting us ready for it, all their rush schemes,” said Sheard, who had three tackles and two sacks. “We went out there and just executed. Everybody played well up front.”\nSo without a running game that was gaining yards consistently, without his go-to-guy Witten, Weeden didn’t have much left to try and win a ball game.\nHe completed 26-of-39 passes for 188 yards, with an interception. Most of those receptions went to running back McFadden (nine catches for 62 yards) and wideout Cole Beasley (four catches, 40 yards) — who the Pats also bottled up pretty well. The more telling statistic was that Cowboys were only 4-of-14 on third-down conversions.\n“Everybody just had a great game. The secondary was doing a great job on the receivers. Up front, we are trying to put pressure on the quarterback and stop the run,” said defensive lineman Alan Branch, “Obviously, we did a decent job. There she blows. That’s what happened right there.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T18:37:04.562+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
