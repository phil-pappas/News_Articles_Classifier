The comment in the article is it appears to be a \"changing of the guard\" in the Cards backfield to CJ as the lead RB. Basically says Arians is a if it aint broke, don't fix it kind of coach. I certainly agree that CJ is making a strong case but will be interesting, NFL coaches tend to not like to replace a guy due to injury even if the backup plays this well. They usually take a few weeks beyond the return of the injured guy to make up their mind. Nice decision to have to make, do I play the hot back CJ, the guy who was our starter, or the young rook who keeps busting big plays.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T02:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T17:20:26.070+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
