Elaheh Ahmadi, Najmeh Khedmati and Narjes Emamgholinejad form a popular Iranian trio in the shooting fraternity , not only for having won the Asian Games team gold in the women's air rifle at Inche last year, but also for playing torch bearers for their sport in their country .\n\"Wherever we go, people ask us whether we face difficulties from our families government et al to pursue our dream, but things cannot be farther from this perception about Iran,\" says Narjes. \"In fact, I feel shooting is the easiest sport for Iran women. I feel in our sport, it is the men who have to face more challenges than the women,\" she adds.\nEven socially, the path is pretty clear for the women. \"It was my father who introduced me to coaching. He also trained me in the initial years. Then I married a journalist and he too supports me whole heartedly,\" Elaheh, a mother of a two year-old, chips in.\nThe trio would pose a serious threat to their Indian opponents, Apurvi Chandela, Pooja Ghatkar and Ayonika Paul when they take the range for the 10m air rifle event on Monday. But it was Iran and shooting that they seemed more interested in talking about at the moment. Narjes held forth on her observation that women shooters had it easier than the men in Iran. \"The men shooters are very good too. But they don't get as many opportunities as we get,\" she says.\nUnlike in women's, Iran's male shooters in the same event don't boast of world rankings or Olympic quotas. Elaheh is ranked 6th and Najmeh 7th in the world standings and the two have already qualified for Rio Olympics after winning gold and bronze respectively at the Gabala World Cup. \"In Iran, military service is mandatory for the men and since all the men shooters serve in the army, it becomes difficult for them to get permission all the time. We don't have any problem in getting the permissions,\" explains Narjes, Iran's Hungarian coach Lazlo Szucsak echoed his ward's idea. \"We don't have all our senior men shooters in the 10m rifle category. We have only one out of three shooters, since rest of the two didn't have enough funding to participate here,\" Lazlo said, highlighting the `reverse discrimination' in Iranian sporting society.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T09:44:32.996+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
