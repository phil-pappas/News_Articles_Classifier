They are No. 3 in the state, well deserved, and they don’t have any weak spots,” Woodstock coach Brent Budde said. “We were just outmatched (Friday).“Offensively at times, we executed, but then we turned the ball over or we could not sustain them up front and the quarterback would get sacked. That kind of kills the drives. Our execution offensively just needed to be a little cleaner and a little crisper.”In scoring the most points of its 65-year history, Roswell racked up 520 yards on offense, including 316 rushing yards, and spread the ball around all night. Sheldon Evans and Quintarius Neely did most of the work on the ground, combining for nearly half of the team’s rushing yards, but six receivers caught at least two passes for the Hornets. Evans scored three rushing touchdowns, and Neely passed for four touchdowns.“They prepare real hard in practice, and these kids do a good job of running our offense and executing out there,” Roswell coach John Ford said.Woodstock may not have been able to sustain drives, but Budde said he was proud of the effort in the second half to crack the shutout. The Wolverines scored their only points of the game on a 46-yard pass from Liam Byrne to Louis Hall late in the third quarter.“I am proud of our kids and how we fought. Our kids are never going to give up. They are going to fight and give us everything they got,” Budde said. “That shows us what kind of character they have.”Roswell defensive end Koby Cumberlander was a big reason Woodstock could not get much going on offense. Cumberlander recorded five sacks in the game and was in the backfield pressuring the quarterback or disrupting the run all night.“He is a really good player and a he is a hard worker,” Ford said. “He is one that people have to keep an eye out for. He is incredibly strong and fast and is really the total package.”Budde said he’s not thrilled for the prospects of having to face Cumberlander again next year.“He is strong and quick and has a great technique,” Budde said. “He uses great technique and I believe he is only a junior, so he is coming back next year. He is going to wreak havoc on a lot of region teams next year.”After the loss knocked Woodstock out of playoff contention, Budde said he had a simple message for his team.“That is what a championship-caliber team looks like, and if our goal is to try to get to that point, we have to play like that,” Budde said. “We have to be physical like that. We have to be fast. We have to execute. It is a good test to see where we need to get to.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T10:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T20:13:12.580+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
