It’s something that U.S. Soccer could use more of when it comes to the state of the men’s national team. Last Saturday, at the pregame fan fest before USA–Mexico outside the Rose Bowl, the U.S. Soccer Federation posted a giant banner over the stage for everyone to see:\nDOS A CERO, ONCE AGAIN.\nIt was the soccer version of MISSION ACCOMPLISHED, to say nothing of a near-guarantee of bad karma. And sure enough, the U.S. did not win 2–0 against Mexico this time, but rather lost 3–2 to its archrival in a game that mattered.\nIn fact, if we were keeping score over the past week, the best way to do it would be by asking how many tournaments Mexico qualified for in terms of the 2017 Confederations Cup and the 2016 Olympics — that would be two — and how many the U.S. qualified for.\nYep, zero.\nTalk about Dos a Cero .\n• WAHL: It’s time to look at Jurgen Klinsmann’s suitability as USA’s coach\nLet’s be honest: the U.S. men are a mess right now. The senior team has lost four of its last six matches on home soil, including competitive elimination games against Jamaica and Mexico and dismal friendly defeats against Brazil and (on Tuesday) Costa Rica , to go along with a penalty-kick shootout defeat to Panama (which technically counts as a tie).\nThe U.S. Under-23 team laid a giant egg at home against Honduras on Saturday, deservedly losing 2–0 with an Olympic berth up for grabs. Now the Americans will have to upset Colombia in a two-game playoff in Rio de Janeiro in March to avoid being the second U.S. team in a row to miss out on the Olympics.\nFor his part, U.S. coach and technical director Jurgen Klinsmann is being asked openly if he’s considering resigning (more on that in a second).\nPlanet Futbol Video Sluggish USA can't shake off Mexico loss hangover in falling to Costa Rica by Grant Wahl", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/GrantWahl"], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T13:09:38.612+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
