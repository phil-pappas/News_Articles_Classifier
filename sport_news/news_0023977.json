(Doug Kapustin for The Washington Post) \nMaryland interim head coach Mike Locksley continued to conjure up ways to energize his team during practice Tuesday morning, blaring music and giving an unconventional opportunity to a group of unheralded players. Locksley placed the ball at the 10-yard line and created a hypothetical third-and-goal situation, telling his scout-team offense it had two downs to score on the scout-team defense. \n“And they got excited about that,” Locksley said later, grinning about the uncoiled energy the team has released in recent days. The past 10 days have been difficult for the program in the wake of Randy Edsall’s firing , which has led to one of the most difficult tasks in Locksley’s long career as football coach: rally a stunned group of players who have lost three straight games by 21 points or more and prepare them for this weekend’s game against Penn State in Baltimore. \nTuesday’s red-zone drill was simple, but it also conveyed the type of coaching Locksley intends to do these next six weeks. He plans to use his outgoing and competitive personality to add wrinkles to Maryland’s daily approach, which has included playing music in the team facility before meetings to lighten the mood. \nLocksley said Tuesday that he does not feel as if he is auditioning for the team’s permanent job and that he refuses to campaign for the opening. He also noted at least three times during his news conference that he wants his players to play football in its “purest form” over the second half of the season. That he is encouraging his players to have more fun on the field shouldn’t be misconstrued, he warned. \n“All the things that this generation likes to do, we’re just trying to make sure it’s more of a mood than it’s something we’re doing necessarily on the field. I think it starts with me having a high energy about how you go about doing things like practice, and I think we’ve seen a little bit of a change,” Locksley said. \nLocksley has already made a number of personnel moves as the interim coach, which included naming Perry Hills the starting quarterback shortly after he was promoted last week. He also moved sophomore Shane Cockerille from fullback to quarterback on Monday , adding Tuesday that senior Daxx Garman is “banged up” and thus not listed on this week’s two-deep. \nThe move could also spell the changes Locksley wants on offense, which will focus on Hills’s dual-threat ability at quarterback. Cockerille has the same type of mobility, although Locksley said Tuesday that whoever is under center will have to provide a lift in the passing game. Locksley also made slight shifts at tight end and along the offensive line, all moves that are geared toward loosening his team up for Penn State. \n“The thing we’ve really stressed is, let’s just go out and have fun and play football in its purest form, which is back in the day when you played with your friends and you went into the backyard and just kind of let it all cut loose,” Locksley said. “That’s the mentality we want to play with, because we really have nothing to lose as a program.” \nRoman Stubbs covers the University of Maryland athletics for The Washington Post. sports Success!
