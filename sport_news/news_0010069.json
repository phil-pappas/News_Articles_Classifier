Overall Penn is just a great fit for me so I committed.\" \nNorton talked about why he decided to pledge to the Penn Quakers. \n\"I just loved it at Penn on my visit. It's more of an urban campus in Philadelphia and it's exactly what I was looking for in a school. I was able to get to know the coaches and the players and everyone was great. I'm planning to to major in business and Penn offers a world class education and an amazing business program. I narrowed it down to Penn or Princeton and in the end it was just the feeling I had at Penn that sealed it for me.\" \nNorton is thrilled to have his recruiting process behind him. \n\"I couldn't be happier that it's all over.
