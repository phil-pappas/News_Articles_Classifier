However, all bets were off after the Heritage Minister made a surprise announcement in April that she wouldn’t be seeking re-election and instead was going back to police work.\nHer Conservative replacement, Catellier, who runs his own consulting company ran a low-key campaign wasn’t able to capitalize on the popularity of his predecessor enough to compete against Vandal, who was the councillor for St. Boniface for over a decade.\nThe riding had been held by the Liberals from the late 1980’s to 2008, until Glover unseated Raymond Simard, who had been the Liberal MP since 2002, in 2008.\nIn 2011, Simard made a second stab at the seat, but lost again after Glover got over 50 per cent of the vote.\nThings became even more surprising in the race after Selby made a last-minute announcement she would run for the NDP.\nRelated Items Photo Galleries Canadians hit the polls for the 42nd general election Articles Looks like the Liberals are ready Liberals to form majority government Conservative MP Bezan keeps Selkirk-Interlake-Eastman Jim Carr wins Winnipeg South Centre for the Liberals Blue-sky morning giving way to dark night for Conservatives Bergen wins Portage-Lisgar for Conservatives Sopuck wins Dauphin-Swan River-Marquette for Conservatives Elections Canada, medical staff help Winnipeg woman cast ballot from deathbed Liberals sweep P.E.I.'s four ridings, toppling fisheries minister Interactive map: Federal election results 2015 national election poll tracker Winnipeg speaks Partisanship trumps bad blood: Selinger will vote for Selby on Monday Saint Boniface-Saint Vital is a battleground riding full of surprises Grit surge last thing Tories want Social justice topic of well-mannered forum in North End Selby seeking federal seat Liberals taking off in Manitoba, according to poll NDP aerospace vows familiar Selby to run for federal NDP, party sources say Politics are in candidate’s blood Rebel with a new cause, Selby launches bid for federal seat ", "external_links": ["http://thecanadianpress-a.akamaihd.net/graphics/elections/federal/pages/2015/index.html#saint-boniface-saint-vital"], "published": "2015-10-20T04:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T05:41:25.183+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
