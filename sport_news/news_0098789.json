He called the restoration \"stunning.\"\nThere was no grand reopening event Saturday. Astoria Mayor Arline LaMear said the Friends group and the city may schedule one later, after other work is complete. \"They want to wait until everything is in good order before we have a grand opening,\" she said.\nThe 125-foot-tall column, which sits on a hill overlooking the city, was built as one of 12 historical markers that stretch westward from St. Paul, Minnesota, to commemorate the settlers who helped expand the United States to the Pacific Ocean. It's modeled after Rome's Trajan's Column , which tells the tale of an emperor's major military victory.\nAstoria's column has 525 feet of murals that depict historic events such as the end of the Lewis and Clark Expedition and Capt. Robert Gray's discovery of the Columbia River. Attilio Pusterla created the art using a technique known as sgraffito .\nSchnitzer, president of Portland's Harsch Investment Properties, said he got involved with preserving the Astoria Column because he has a home in nearby Gearhart and has been visiting Astoria for decades. By the 1980s, he said, the effects of time and weather on the column were obvious. He contacted the mayor and a public-private partnership was born, with Schnitzer creating the Friends of Astoria Column to raise funds.\nThis year's project wasn't the first time that efforts have been made to restore the column, but none of the previous work was satisfactory, Schnitzer said. \"When you restore something as magnificent as the Astoria Column, it truly is an art and a science,\" he said.\nFriends of Astoria Column had originally planned a $1 million campaign, but started the restoration work in May after reaching the $600,000 mark. \"We didn't want to go one more year with the weather battering our beloved column,\" Schnitzer said.\nThe nonprofit will now work on raising $500,000 more to finish the rest of the work, such as repairing pavers loosened by an earlier seismic upgrading of the column's foundation and installing LED lights.\nSchnitzer said that while the Astoria Column has nothing on historic sites elsewhere in terms of age, it's venerable for its home state.\n\"We don't have that many structures like this in Oregon,\" he said. \"Therefore we have a greater obligation to take care of it, and it's something that belongs to every single Oregonian.\"\n-- Amy Wang\nawang@oregonian.com\n503-294-5914\n@ORAmyW", "external_links": ["http://www.britannica.com/art/sgraffito", "https://twitter.com/ORAmyW", "http://astoriacolumn.org/about/friends-of-the-column/", "http://www.nationalgeographic.com/trajan-column/article.html"], "published": "2015-10-11T04:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T10:22:34.460+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
