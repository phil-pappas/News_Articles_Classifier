(Andy Manis / AP) Teddy Greenstein Contact Reporter Chicago Tribune \nAlec Ingold did his research. Before scoring the go-ahead touchdown for Wisconsin on Saturday, the freshman got some advice from fellow running back Dare Ogunbowale . \n“He was asking me what the celebration rules were,” Ogunbowale said. “All we were worried about was (a penalty) … don’t do anything dumb.” \nOn second-and-goal from the 2, the 237-pound Ingold slammed into Illinois defensive back Jevaris Little , an apt name considering his 190-pound frame. It marked Ingold’s fourth touchdown in Wisconsin’s last three games. \nWith an official observing from just a few feet away, Ingold celebrated by mimicking the leg action of a placekicker. Needless to say, it won’t go down as one of the top 1,000 celebrations in football history. But most importantly, the zebra did not penalize him. \n“I just got excited and did whatever,” Ingold said, claiming it was not premeditated. “No, no plans. Just kicked the door down.” \nAhh, youth. \nWhen Ingold was asked about the Badgers’ quarterback situation, he replied: “I haven’t thrown a ball in a long time, and I wasn’t the best to begin with. Stuff has changed real quick, but I don’t see that coming.” \nThe question was meant to summon a response regarding Bart Houston and incumbent Joel Stave , who left the game with a concussion. \nBut, hey, it’s understandable that Ingold’s mind is still swimming. \nA year ago, he was a high school quarterback in Green Bay getting no love from his home-state school. He committed to Northern Illinois but also began considering Pittsburgh, where Paul Chryst was the head coach. \nOnce Chryst took the Wisconsin job in December, the move to Madison became Ingold’s destiny. \n“I appreciate that we’re together,” Chryst said. \nIngold planned to play inside linebacker in college but switched to running back last month because of a rash of injuries. \n“They asked me if I’d be comfortable at fullback, and I said: Sure, I’ll help out as much as I can,” Ingold said. “I love it. I’m grateful for it.” \nWith Corey Clement out indefinitely after sports hernia surgery and backup Taiwan Deal still bothered by an ankle injury, Ingold and Ogunbowale are Wisconsin’s top running backs. \nOgunbowale walked on and spent his first two-plus seasons playing defense. Sound familiar? \n“It’s different, it’s surprising,” Ogunbowale said of his path and Ingold’s. “Neither of us thought we’d be in this situation. But it’s exciting, and Alec is like my little brother.” \nGood things come in 3s: The Big Ten’s top quarterbacks have emerged, and how’s this for a wild coincidence? They play for the league’s top three teams. \nJ.T. Barrett , overdue to start by seven weeks, was brilliantly efficient in Ohio State’s 49-7 obliteration of Rutgers. He completed 14 of 18 passes for 223 yards with three touchdowns and no interceptions. And he ran for 101 yards and two scores. Can a guy become a Heisman Trophy finalist after spending the first half of the season as a backup? I say: Absolutely. \nConnor Cook threw for 398 yards against Indiana, two shy of the Michigan State record (Bill Burke, 1999). Cook was at his best on the money down, completing 10 of 15 passes for 139 yards on third down. \nC.J. Beathard and Iowa got a well-deserved breather. Let’s hope he’s no longer limping around like “Grandpa” Amos McCoy (of “The Real McCoys”), the comparison made by coach Kirk Ferentz. \nThe weak ahead: Ohio State and Michigan State are off Saturday, as are Northwestern and Indiana. So the Big Ten’s marquee matchup is … the prime-time Michigan-Minnesota game? Maryland-Iowa? Illinois-Penn State? There’s no excuse to blow off trick-or-treating, Big Ten fans. There are not many treats in this lineup. \nWho’s No. 1?: Using a criteria of 75 percent results, 25 percent expectations (the “eye test”), here’s how I voted in the Football Writers of America-National Football Foundation Super 16 Poll: 1.
