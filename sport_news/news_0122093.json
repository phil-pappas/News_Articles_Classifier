He missed the first month of this season with a lower-body injury unrelated to the blood clots. \nDupuis was working his way back from an ACL tear when he scored six goals in 16 games in 2014-15 before he was forced to sit out the final five months of the season because of blood clots that threatened his career. He came back to score a goal in four preseason games this season before his lower-body injury. \nCopyright Â© 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T19:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T20:04:46.715+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
