Boys, at that age, don’t think about danger too much, especially when they have a cute little girlfriend and her young brother.\nI had gone out on the sand bar on the south side of the island many times and knew when you had to start to leave that sand bar to get back to the main beach. We left the bar later than we should have, and I almost lost the young lady and her brother.\nWe were very lucky to make it back. I don’t recall any warning sign; however, they were probably there.\nIt was a terrible tragedy, a short while ago, when several Indian family members lost their lives while out on that sandbar. I would suggest a solution that might help people who are not familiar with that beach area.\nThe beach authorities should find the highest elevation point on that sandbar and have a wooden tower installed with a platform on top and an access ladder or steps to the top.\nThe top should be protected with handrails and equipped with a light and a hand cranked alarm of some type. At worst, a person would have to wait until the next tide change to get back to the main beach. You could name that tower “Your Last Resort.” You might put a sign there that states that the tower should not be used other than for personal safety.\nRICHARD LEECH\nSavannah\nOne phone call\nwill save a life\nOctober is recognized across the country as Domestic Violence Awareness Month. And while other shelters are busy with extra awareness activities, here in Savannah we are mourning the fact we had our fourth local homicide on Oct. 3. The victim broke up with her boyfriend and he apparently went to her home, killed her and then took his own life.\nAccording to the Georgia Commission Against Domestic Violence, year-to-date there have been 91 domestic violence-related deaths in the state. And that doesn’t include the most recent two here in Savannah. That is an increase of 20 over 2014’s 71 deaths in Georgia.\nWe have 42 certified shelters in this state, ranging from Athens all the way down to Camden County. There are statewide hotlines and local crisis lines for victims to call for help. But the numbers keep rising, and I can’t offer any explanation.\nYou can’t blame the economy or the unemployment rate. It has nothing to do with soldiers coming home from the war. Certainly these situations can be contributing factors, but domestic violence is about control — physical, verbal and emotional. And as a result, it’s pure fear that paralyzes victims from speaking out or getting help.\nWithout sounding like a broken record, we need to, as a community, create an environment where it’s easier for victims to reach out. We need to let them know there is help and where there’s help, there’s hope. It speaks volumes that once again, we never heard from any of the four women killed this year by their partner. This has been the case throughout the shelter’s 35-year history.\nI implore you to keep talking about domestic violence, and raise your voices loud enough so every victim living in silence and terror can hear you.\nWe need to shatter that silence if we’re ever going to break that horrific cycle of violence. And remember this number, 912-629-8888.\nAll it takes to save a life is that one phone call.\nCHERYL HAVEN BRANCH\nExecutive Director\nSafe Shelter Center for Domestic Violence Services\nSavannah\nCount me in\nRegarding safety in Savannah, Mr. Joe Dyer’s letter to the editor (“Crime in Savannah: What is the answer?” Oct. 5) is spot on regarding upping the ante for additional law enforcement and its funding.\nCount me in. So, where do I send my check?\nDICK HOCHMAN\nSavannah\nFreedom vs. liberty: Vote for liberty\nContrary to popular belief, freedom and liberty are not the same.\nFreedom is personal. It is about you. It is about people like you. When a politician talks about freedom, he is talking about what he can do for you. Freedom is to be free from something.\nLiberty is for your neighbor. Liberty is for all the faces of the people you never knew and may never know. Liberty is to be free to do something. Liberty is comprised of the inalienable rights of mankind.\nPoliticians love to talk about freedom. They promise us more and more freedom — freedom from government, corporations, rich, poor, everything. They cut us up into groups that they can use to hit that magical 51 percent. But what happens when you are in the 49 percent? What happens when your guy doesn’t pull through?\nFreedom is only good when you’re in the majority, and whether it be the shade of your ideology or the color of your skin, we are all minorities in one way or another. The greatest minority on earth is the individual. The only difference is in how the politicians cut the pie.\nI urge readers to take notice when they hear a politician talk about liberty.\nThere are not many, but when you hear them you will know. They are not just a politician, they are also true statesmen, and they fight for all of us.\nSHANE FARRAR\nArmstrong Student\nSavannah\nClinton supporters don’t bode well for our future\nThe Hillary Clinton sycophants, led by the prolific scribe of Black Creek, Bernie Evans, are on full display in his SMN letter of Oct. 4 (“News flash: Hillary will win nomination”). They apparently operate under the old worn maxim, “hear no evil, see no evil, speak no evil.”\nNo amount of obvious selling influence for dollars through the Clinton Foundation, improper or probably illegal handling of classified material by using an insecure private email account rather than the secure government server used by normal government leaders, or even the ability to miraculously turn $1,000 into $100,000 by trading cattle futures for the first time, seems to alter their worship of this terribly corrupt lady.\nIf there was justice in the world, then such a highly flawed individual would never be seriously considered as a candidate for president.\nIt does not bode well for our future that some 40-50 percent of the American people apparently no longer care about such once important, quaint characteristics for our national leaders as truthfulness, personal integrity and personal ethics.\nERIC HOGAN\nTybee Island", "external_links": ["http://sav-cdn.com/sites/all/themes/savannahnow/images/blank.gif"], "published": "2015-10-11T17:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T08:40:41.805+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
