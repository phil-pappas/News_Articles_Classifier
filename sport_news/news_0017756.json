AL DIAZ adiaz@miamiherald.com i \nThe team that keeps preaching consistency is Miami. \nThe team that has owned it year after year after year has been Florida State. \nTurns out 2015 was no different, despite a harrowing fourth quarter that seemed as if it might be. \nLed by a 222-yard rushing night and three touchdowns by Miami Central High graduate Dalvin Cook — he, with the injured hamstring — the 12th-ranked Seminoles continued their domination of in-state rival Miami on Saturday night with a 29-24 victory at Doak Campbell Stadium. \nThe Hurricanes got the ball back at their 19-yard line with 2:45 left but could only get as far as the 42. Quarterback Brad Kaaya, who completed 29 of 49 passes for a career-high 405 yards, had three balls batted at the line of scrimmage on his final drive. \nFSU (5-0, 3-0 Atantic Coast Conference) made it six consecutive victories over the Canes (3-2), who lost their first ACC game of the season, second game in a row and ninth in their past 11 games in the series that began in 1951. \nThe Seminoles now trail by only two games — 31-29 — in the rivalry. \nSeminoles coach Jimbo Fisher has never lost to Miami. \nHurricanes coach Al Golden has never beaten FSU. \nDown 20-10 at the half, Miami scored a 1-yard touchdown to make it 20-17 in the third quarter on a pass to Joe Yearby (15 carries for 33 yards) that culminated an 80-yard drive. \nFSU scored on a 25-yard field goal by Roberto Aguayo before UM receiver Stacy Coley (career-high 139 yards on seven catches) gave UM its only lead — 24-23 — on a 29-yard touchdown with 10:02 left. \nBut Cook sealed it for the Seminoles with a 23-yard run with 6:44 left. \nFSU quarterback Everett Golson finished with 291 passing yards and a touchdown. \nAfter FSU won the toss and deferred to the second half, the Hurricanes opened with a 22-yard pass down the middle by Kaaya to Stacy Coley, playing his first game since Nebraska. \nYearby ran for 5, then on second down Kaaya delivered a perfect pass down the field to a wide-open David Njoku that would have given the Canes a first down and put them in scoring position. \nNjoku dropped the pass with no one near him. \nTwo plays later, Miami, having squandered a crucial opportunity, was punting. \nFlorida State squandered no such opportunity. \nOn second-and-three from the FSU 28, Cook showed his hamstring was just fine, rushing 72 yards on an option pitch that Golson waited until the last second to release. \nAs the Canes looked around, Cook sprinted down the left side in no time to the end zone, and FSU led 7-0 after three-and-a-half minutes. \nMiami came back on the ensuing drive with a 38-yard pass to Coley to get to the FSU 23. Three plays later, on a 14-yard completion to Braxton Berrios, Kaaya got pummeled in the chest by safety Trey Marshall, who was ejected for targeting. \nMarshall will miss the first half of next week’s FSU game against Louisville. \nAfter the big hit, Kaaya recovered his own fumble on the next play, threw away a pass on second down and was sacked by DeMarcus Walker on third-and-8. \nThe Canes settled for a 30-yard field goal by Michael Badgley to make it 7-3 with 4:35 left in the opening quarter. \nNo worries, Cook must have been thinking. \nGolson delivered a 37-yarder to tight end Ryan Izzo, Cook rushed for 2, then showed he can catch with a 36-yard touchdown on a crossing pattern that had three Canes — linebackers Raphael Kirby and Jermaine Grace, and safety Deon Bush grasping for air. \nThe Seminoles led 14-3 with 5:42 left in the first quarter. \nFSU’s Aguayo kicked field goals of 22 and 32 yards in the second quarter, sandwiched with a beautiful 58-yard touchdown reception by Rashawn Scott. Scott shook off one defender, then beat Jalen Ramsey to the end zone. \nThe first half ended with a 49-yard field goal miss by Aguayo, who hit the right upright. \nWith Miami 3-19 in previous games when trailing at halftime, it didn’t seem promising.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T07:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T07:34:50.009+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
