(Matthew Emmons/USA Today Sports) \nSometimes when Rob Gronkowski is matched up against smaller players, it just doesn’t seem fair. Actually, that’s the case most of the time. \nThe Patriots tight end is too fast for most linebackers, and he’s simply too strong for any defensive back. Gronk proved that again in New England’s 30-6 win over Dallas Sunday, especially on one particular play, when he manhandled a pair of hapless Cowboys defenders. \nAfter catching a third-quarter pass from Tom Brady while battling tight coverage from cornerback Byron Jones, Gronkowski was able to get away from Jones with a stiff-arm. Actually, he didn’t get away from Jones so much as toss the Cowboy aside like an empty can of Shiner Bock.

Wilcox was eventually able to make the tackle, but not before the safety ate yet another Gronkowski stiff-arm and went for a five-yard ride. Gronk Catch. Gronk Stiff Arm. Gronk Run.
