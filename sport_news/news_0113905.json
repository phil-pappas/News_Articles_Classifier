It has been a punishing few weeks for the Terrapins, who are practicing with just nine players due to a slew of injuries. Center Malina Howard has been held out with a concussion. Guard Kiara Leslie has a sprained ankle. Forwards Tierney Pfirman and A’Lexus Harrison have missed time because of foot injuries. \n“I think everyone is eager to learn … the people that have been kind of banged up, they’re more experienced,” Moseley said. “So it’s good for people that that haven’t as much experience … we can give them more time.” \nThe attrition won’t cost Maryland any players on a long-term basis, but it provides proof that even the most dominant program must suffer through toil and pain. \n[ All eyes on Trimble and Maryland men’s team ] \nLast season Maryland finished 18-0 in its first Big Ten campaign, shredding opponents it had no familiarity with en route to a third Final Four under Brenda Frese, who was named Big Ten Coach of the Year. The Terps have been tabbed to approach the same heights in their second year, picked Wednesday night as the favorite to win the league by both coaches and members of the media. Juniors Shatori Walker-Kimbrough and Brionna Jones, both first team all-league players lasts season, were also selected as part of the preseason all-Big Ten team. \n“They were picked first. I voted them first. I think they should be picked first based on what they did last year, the players they have returning. They also have a really exciting freshman class coming in, so I think they’re the team to catch right now,” Ohio State Coach Kevin McGuff said. \nFrese said Thursday that it is important for her program to continue cultivating rivalries within the Big Ten, although it will take time. It certainly doesn’t help when the games are so lopsided in Maryland’s favor; of 18 conference wins last season, only four were decided by single digits. \n“I think that’s the biggest thing that probably needs to get established, and I think for our fans as well, you know, is kind of trying to understand a lot of those names,” said Frese, who is from Cedar Rapids, Iowa. Maryland will travel to Iowa on Jan. 10, a game that has been discussed by Frese’s family for more than two years. “The summer was spent at my family’s home with renovations and to make sure that it’s up to par to be able to bring the team over for a team dinner,” she said. \nIn the time being, Frese will get her team ready. Maryland is again stocked with talent, starting with Walker-Kimbrough, an electric guard who averaged 13.5 points and 5.3 rebounds per game as a sophomore. Jones anchors the front court, a powerful post player who had 14 double-doubles last season. She’s complemented by Howard, a senior who last season helped Maryland lead the Big Ten in field goal percentage and rebound differential (plus-10.6). \nMaryland has experience at point guard in Moseley (106 games) and sophomore Chloe Pavlech (31 games), while Leslie and sophomore Kristen Confroy are perimeter threats alongside Walker-Kimbrough. Though Maryland must replace dynamic guard in Lexie Brown, who transferred to Duke in the offseason, the future is bolstered by incoming freshmen Brianna Fraser (Brooklyn, N.Y.) and Kiah Gillespie (Meriden, Conn.), both of whom were McDonald’s all-Americans. \nFrese said Thursday that while Walker-Kimbrough and Jones have solidified their spots in the starting five, the entire roster is currently clawing for places in the playing rotation. That competition will heat up once the team weathers its difficult stretch and becomes fully healthy. \n“We embrace change. We love change. We like to see what we can do when change comes,” Howard said. Roman Stubbs covers the University of Maryland athletics for The Washington Post. sports Success! Check your inbox for details.
