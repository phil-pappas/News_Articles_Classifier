Taylor Beck beat Zach Fucale with James Wright setting a screen in front of the net to cut the IceCaps' lead to 5-3. \nWith 3:26 to go, after Alan Quine 's shot went wide on a power play, Joe Whitney retrieved the puck behind the net and banked it in off Fucale. \nBridgeport couldn't get Gibson off for an extra attacker until about 30 seconds remained, and an icing with 11 seconds left helped seal it for the IceCaps. \nAfter going 3-for-24 on the power play in the first six games, the Sound Tigers were 2-for-6 Saturday. Bracken Kearns scored on a deflection 5:53 into the game, answering the goal Daniel Carr scored on a breakaway 1:39 in. \nScott Mayfield tied it a second time at 15:08, his second goal of the young season after scoring only one empty-net goal all last season. But Charles Hudon put St. John's ahead for good with 2:39 left in the first period off a nice pass from Bud Holloway. \nNikita Scherbak (his first as a pro) and Holloway (off Hudon's setup, returning the favor) scored to put the IceCaps up 5-2 in the second period. \nBridgeport killed all five IceCaps power plays after giving up nine power-play goals on 29 chances in the first six games. \nIceCaps 5, Sound Tigers 4 \nBridgeport 2 0 2—4 \nSt. John's 3 2 0—5 \nFirst Period -- 1, St. John's, Carr 3 (Thomas, Fucale), 1:39. 2, Bridgeport, Kearns 4 (Whitney, Pulock), 5:53 (pp). 3, St. John's, Thomas 4 (Dietz), 9:10. 4, Bridgeport, Mayfield 2 (Halmo, Quine), 15:08. 5, St. John's, Hudon 2 (Holloway, Barberio), 17:21.
