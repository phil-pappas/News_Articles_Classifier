(AP) — A woman arrested on a DUI charge crashed into a crowd of spectators Saturday during the Oklahoma State University homecoming parade, killing three people and injuring nearly two dozen others, police said. \nStillwater police Capt. Kyle Gibbs said the woman’s sedan plowed into an unoccupied motorcycle of an officer who was working security at the parade, then into the crowd. The driver of the sedan was taken into custody on a driving under the influence charge, Gibbs said. \nGibbs said three people were killed and 22 were injured in the crash Saturday morning. \nOklahoma State University President Burns Hargis said the homecoming game against Kansas would be played Saturday afternoon. \nDave Kapple of Houston told the Stillwater News Press that he and his son were about 10 feet away when they saw the vehicle barreling into the crowd. \n“We heard somebody scream, ‘Look out!.’ (The driver) plowed through a police motorcycle, and then a crowd of people,” Kapple said. “People were flying everywhere.” \nKonda Walker, from Anchorage, Alaska, was attending the festivities ahead of the homecoming game. \n“At first we thought it was part of the show,” Walker told the News Press. “People were flying 30 feet into the air like rag dolls.” \nPhone calls to Oklahoma State officials were not immediately returned. \nThe university posted on Twitter: “Oklahoma State University is saddened by the tragic parade incident earlier this morning. Our thoughts & prayers are with those affected.” Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T21:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T21:18:42.895+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
