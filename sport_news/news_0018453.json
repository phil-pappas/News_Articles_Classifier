Singler to send to D-League By Andy Larsen | Posted Oct 21st, 2015 @ 4:30pm 0  \nSALT LAKE CITY  Jazz fans were confused when the Jazz signed E.J. Singler to their roster Wednesday afternoon, bringing the roster back up to 16 players. Singler, after all, played in the lowly Estonian league last season. \nBut Singler won't be on the roster long, according to sources. He'll be waived in order to bring him to the Idaho Stampede. \nWhen the Utah Jazz waive players that didn't have a previous D-League tie, the Idaho Stampede, as the minor league affiliate of the Jazz, generally will get their rights. The Jazz/Stampede can do this for up to four players. \nHowever, if Singler wouldn't have been signed by the Jazz, he would have been eligible for the D-League draft, so that any team could draft him. While the Stampede have the number one pick in that draft, they don't want to waste a pick on Singler, when they can use this NBA assignment loophole instead. \nSo, technically, Singler becomes a member of the Utah Jazz for a short spell, just so the team can efficiently get him on the Stampede's roster. The Jazz want the Stampede to improve, with the hopeful ideal of becoming a progressive development place for young players to grow into role-playing Jazzmen. \nSingler, who played for the Oregon Ducks collegiately, won the 2014 D-League Three Point contest.
