Instead of a ghost, be the Ghost of John Adams. Instead of a regular witch, be a Salem witch! (Colonial garb and nonstop screaming encouraged.)\nIf you prefer a getup from this century, however, we’ve got you covered. Here are six current Boston costumes (for either gender) that will be a hit at any party from Amesbury to Yarmouth.\n1. TOM BRADY & BILL BELICHICK\nWhat you need (Brady):\n— Tom Brady jersey\n— Ugg boots (if you can get them anymore)\n— A bottle of NeuroSafe to, you know, ease hangovers, prevent concussions, and cure blindness\nWhat you need (Belichick):\n— Gray hoodie with the sleeves cut off (or any other piece of the Belichic fashion line )\n— A professional-looking headset\n— A “let’s party” attitude\nParty plan:\n— Take over the beer pong table the second you get there and dominate it.\n— If it’s someone’s first game ever, beat them by 10 without cracking a smile.\n— If anyone makes a joke about the ping pong balls being regulation size, stare them down until they leave.\n2. ROBERT KRAFT & ROGER GOODELL\nWhat you need (Kraft):\n— Your loudest suit and flyest pair of kicks\n— Four Super Bowl rings (aluminum foil will work, though replica rings are available online)\n— A knife in your back from where Goodell put it\nWhat you need (Goodell):\n— A boring suit with an NFL logo patch on the lapel\n— Devil horns or a blindfold (optional)\nParty plan:\n— Establish a dominant partnership on the beer pong table.\n— Goodell, after a few wins, start dropping balls in your own cup, but blame Kraft, saying he’s dead weight.\n— Kraft, go to the bathroom. Goodell, find a new partner.\n— Goodell, start an argument with Brady and Belichick about the house rules on rebuttals and don’t stop arguing, even when everyone at the party is begging you to just forget about it and play.\n3. MIKE, JAY, AND THE BABY WHALE\nWhat you need:\n— A white tank top, a gold chain, a scally cap\n— An “It’s a tuna, bro!” T-shirt\n— A whale costume / fish costume / sea turtle costume / almost any other sea creature costume, kehd!\nParty plan:\n— Walk around the party taking nonstop video on your phone.\n— Tell everyone at the party your kehd is dressed as a baby whale as loudly as possible.\n— Shout really menial observations like, “THAT’S A GREAT TUNE, BRO!” and, “THERE IS STILL BEER IN THAT FREAKIN’ CUP, JAY!”\n4. THE 2024 BOSTON OLYMPICS\nWhat you need:\n— A white T-shirt with misshapen Olympic rings made from construction paper glued on. (It’s OK if you’re missing one.)\n— Random summer sports objects (e.g., a tennis racket and swimming goggles)\n— If you can get one of the rare Boston 2024 T-shirts, even better.\nParty plan:\n— Tell your friends you have an awesome group costume idea and that you’ll take care of everything.\n— Show up at the party with a hodgepodge of clothing you stole from other friend’s costumes without asking.\n— Mention that your dad can probably pay for the stuff, but if your friends could chip in $100 that’d be cool.\nAlternate party plan:\n— Stay home because no one wanted you to come anyway.\n5. DUNKIN’ DONUTS\nWhat you need:\n— A basketball jersey, shorts, and sweatbands (optional)\n— Inflatable doughnuts to be worn around the waist\nParty plan:\n— Walk around double-cupping everyone’s beer cans with Styrofoam.\n— If anyone brings their kids to the party, ask to hold them, then refuse to give them back because all munchkins belong to you by law.\n— During beer pong, keep asking if Dunkin’ is allowed. Just don't actually try one, unless you want to end up like this guy.\n6. THE T\nWhat you need:\n— A red, green, orange, blue, or silver T-shirt\n— Black spray paint for the T logo\n— Swag repping your local line (Harvard sweats for the red, Red Sox hat for the green, etc.)\nParty plan:\n— Enter the room in a conga line with your fellow T cars.\n— Announce that it’s either too hot, too cold, or somebody spilled beer on the floor, and that you’ll be standing by momentarily.\n— Don’t move for 20 minutes.\nShare 0 Tweet 0 Advertisement Health Runkeeper’s new app lets Apple Watch users run phone-free 10.22.15 | 4:55 PM Restaurants This Boston restaurant is one of the top-grossing independent eateries in the country 10.22.15 | 3:13 PM Local news Grab a tissue before reading this get-well note two kids taped to a cop’s door 10.22.15 | 2:13 PM Restaurants Getting ready for Halloween with Tito’s 10.22.15 | 12:19 PM Restaurants 11 restaurants to try near BU 10.22.15 | 11:28 AM Relationships Back to you 10.22.15 | 11:06 AM Local news Road kill will be served at a wild game dinner in Vermont 10.22.15 | 9:56 AM Relationships Afraid to ask where we stand 10.22.15 | 9:51 AM Life A Boston pizza place is trying something unusual.
