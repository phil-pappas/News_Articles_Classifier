The message read ‚ÄúKill all by 10-8-15‚Äù and the administration took it seriously, shutting down classes and moving the football game on Saturday to Georgetown. \nTurns out the EKU basketball team isn‚Äôt practicing on campus either; according to this photo from WTVQ‚Äôs Kennedy Hardman, UK opened up the Joe Craft Center for EKU to practice in , a very cool gesture. Head coach Dan McHale tweeted his appreciation: Really appreciate @UKAthletics for letting us use their gym.

Good on ya, Cats. \nThat‚Äôs not the last we‚Äôll see of the McHale, Bradley, and the Colonels this season. UK plays EKU in Rupp on Wednesday, December 9.

Really October 9, 2015 at 3:28 pm | Permalink \nWe have our issues but once a player does something he is gone unlike Tubman or the three stooges shooting people on campus. BTW if you think that isn‚Äôt that serious just today there has been two shootings on college campuses in TX and AZ but hey putting a campus on lockdown isn‚Äôt serious to you clowns in Lexington. Shoot the campus up we don‚Äôt care just don‚Äôt kick out off our players. J-Dub421 October 9, 2015 at 3:33 pm | Permalink \nTubman is gone from our program, even though he wasn‚Äôt indicted Really. As far as the air soft gun incident. You can buy air soft guns at Walmart. They‚Äôre for ages 8+. Unlike with Jameis Winston and his cronies at FSU who shot up people cars and apartments with bb guns, the UK players didn‚Äôt hurt anyone or damage anything. You have no idea what you‚Äôre talking about, so go back to your hookers and blow. Jon October 9, 2015 at 3:35 pm | Permalink \nLloyd Tubman was kicked out of the school. And ‚Äúshooting the campus up‚Äù is a pretty ignorant thing to say. They had plastic pellet air-soft guns. Ummmm October 9, 2015 at 3:58 pm | Permalink \n‚Äúonce a player does something he is gone‚Äù‚Ä¶..shouldnt that say once a player does something he is recruited. What world do Cards fans live in?

Kids are literally killed for pointing fake weapons at people Exhibit A October 9, 2015 at 4:07 pm | Permalink \nI love that the Card fan chooses to use Lloyd Tubman as an example of how UK is dirty. The kid ultimately had all charges dropped and UK still released him. Pure comedy. J-Dub421 October 9, 2015 at 4:09 pm | Permalink \nThey didn‚Äôt point fake weapons at anyone but each other, and they all knew they were fake. The only stupid thing they did was poor choice of location for their silly game. But keep trying to deflect away from the fact that your program was buying hookers for recruits and players. Really October 9, 2015 at 4:35 pm | Permalink \nWe may have bought strippers. My dad or any other recruits dad would not be mad for taking a visit let‚Äôs be honest. People are condemning the actions but go behind closed doors and watch pork and go to strip clubs themselves. There are plenty of gentlemen clubs and strip clubs in Lexington last time I checked. I guess those places don‚Äôt make a profit right‚Ä¶ I‚Äôd rather pay strippers then give out fake degrees like UNC King Henry October 9, 2015 at 4:43 pm | Permalink \nReally, we get it. You are a UL fan trying to take some of the steam out of this whole ordeal. The fact is, you look really naive when you do it. The VAST majority of society agrees, many of my UL fans included, that this whole ‚Äúhookergate‚Äù thing is beyond distasteful. Other than the Penn St. deal, this is the nastiest thing to ever happen in college athletics. Ha! October 9, 2015 at 4:55 pm | Permalink \nYou can‚Äôt escape this, Really, no matter how hard you try. Your program‚Äôs image is tainted, probably forever. \nJust keep your chin up, wipe those tears, and trudge forward. You all will hopefully relevant again one day. Maybe. üòâ \n#L1CWHORE J-Dub421 October 9, 2015 at 4:58 pm | Permalink \nThey weren‚Äôt strippers, they were hookers. There is a difference. No one is saying that adults can‚Äôt go see strippers, but coaches can‚Äôt pay for strippers or hookers for players and recruits. It‚Äôs a recruiting violation.
