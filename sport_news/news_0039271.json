This year is no different. Just six weeks into the regular season, we've already seen our share of the strange, wacky, and insane. Here are the 10 weirdest Cowboys stories of the season thus far.\n1. Christine Michael getting pulled over by a Texas Highway Patrol trooper so the officer could take his picture.\nLast week Christine Michael was just trying to get to the Cowboys' game against the Patriots when he was pulled over. The trooper didn't give him a ticket, though. He just wanted a picture. Michael posted the picture to his Instagram.\nAccording to TMZ Sports, the Texas Highway Patrol trooper originally pulled him over because it appeared Michael's Bentley had an illegal tint on the front windshield. The trooper is facing disciplinary actions for the stunt.\n\"The trooper's actions have been reviewed by DPS and are not consistent with department procedure,\" sergeant Lonny Haschel told TMZ. \"Corrective action, in the form of a procedural review, will be taken. In conversations with his chain of command, the trooper realized his error in judgement and was apologetic for the incident.\"\nMichael made it to the game on time. He had one carry for six yards.\n2. Greg Hardy's comments about Tom Brady's wife\nBefore Greg Hardy was slated to play his first game as a Cowboy after serving his four-game suspension, he met with the media for the first time in months. When asked about that week's opponent, the Patriots, Hardy turned the conversation to Tom Brady's wife.\n\"I love seeing Tom Brady, he's cool as crap,\" Hardy said. \"Have you seen his wife? I hope she comes to the game. I hope her sister comes to the game, all her friends come to the game. One of my favorite games of the year, guys.\"\nA reporter tried to make the point that Hardy would be excited for any matchup in his return, even Jacksonville. After all, Blake Bortles probably had a pretty attractive wife too.\n\"Is she?\" Hardy asked. \"This kind of information is important. That's how I select my Pro Bowls.\"\nThe comments got him roasted by almost every media outlet, big or small. He then added to the controversy...\n3. Greg Hardy's strange rap video\nA day before Greg Hardy was slated to play against the Patriots, a rap video emerged which didn't exactly help his image. In the video, Hardy is accompanied by a stripper while he raps lyrics that include:\n\"I'm just me, I'm just real, and that's all that I do, up in the booth, spitting the truth. That's me with my crew. I do what I preach. That boy is a beast.\"\nAnd:\n\"I'm one of the few dudes that don't trip when a chick ole me.\"\nShortly after, an NFL offical spoke out against both the comments about Brady's wife and the rap video.\n\"I couldn't disagree more with Greg Hardy's comments, and they do not reflect the values of the league,\" said Anna Isaacson, the NFL's vice president of social responsibility. \"We are working hard to bring attention to the positive role models many other players represent and also to continue our education with all members of the NFL family.\n\"We spend a lot of time at the NFL educating our players on domestic violence and sexual assault. That's what we control here, we control education. We control training, we control all the league does from a public perspective and public service, working with non-profit organizations. We can control that. So that everyone in the NFL family has the services and resources that they need if they need help.\"\n4. Joseph Randle getting chewed out for scoring a touchdown\nIn Week 4 against New Orleans, with the Cowboys at the goalline. Joseph Randle jumped over the pile, spun, swung his arm carrying the ball out and fumbled, which was recovered by New Orleans. A review gave Randle the touchdown, but Randle was chewed out for being careless with the ball.\nNone of that is all that weird. What was is the scope of it. Randle had been told eight days earlier not to leave his feet at the goaline. After he did against New Orleans, it wasn't just Garrett who had a talking with him. It was running backs coach Gary Brown, offensive line coach Frank Pollack and a host of players.\nRandle had an opportunity to cool things after the game, but chose not to. When asked about the play Randle had just two words: \"six points.'\n5. The Cowboys ending joint practices with the Rams early\nThe Cowboys and Rams have very little longstanding hatred. Yet, when the two convened for joint practices after training camp, fights on back-to-back plays sparked an all-out brawl between the two sides, which eventually went towards a fence near fans.\n\"It's a brawl, man,\" Cowboys defensive end Jeremy Mincey said at the time. \"They cheap shot.\"\nAfter things eventually settled, another fight started. Dez Bryant, who was off to the side, ran into the fray. One video clip shows Bryant without a helmet on and it appeared he took a punch to the face by Rams cornerback Imoan Claiborne.\n\"I wish I would have cheap shot his ass,\" Bryant tweeted , \"then all of y'all would have seen the difference.\" Bryant later deleted the tweet.\nThe fights caused the teams to end the practice early.\n6. Dez Bryant's calling our own David Moore a 'sucky' writer\nThe training camp fight prompted a column from SportsDayDFW's David Moore, asking when Bryant's passion crosses a line to become unproductive. Bryant apparently saw the column and felt the need to respond.\n\"you are a sucky writer.... You know damn well I didn't start the fight... I'm defending my teammates and I'll do it again,\" Bryant tweeted.\nThe tweet set off social media reaction on both sides.\n7. Jon Daly answering Cowboys questions during the British Open\nA rain delay halted the second round of the British Open, so Jon Daly did what any reasonable person would do: hunker down in Cowboys pajamas and answer questions on Periscope.\nDaly said he is buddies with a lot of Cowboys. He also projected 2,000 yards for Darren McFadden. That's not going so well.\n8. Drew Brees announcing he was going to play on Ellen\nPerhaps the biggest question in the leadup to the Cowboys' game against the Saints was whether New Orleans quarterback Drew Brees would play. There were rumors both ways and his status semed to change every day. But the first definitive proof Brees gave came when he went on 'Ellen.' Naturally.\n\"There's not anything that's going to keep me off the field this Sunday,\" Brees said.\nMaybe Tony Romo will announce when he'll return on' Dr. Phil.'\n9. Tony Romo's 'See you in February' comment to Tom Brady\nThe Cowboys had just got blown out by the Patriots, 30-6. All Tony Romo had to do was walk up and tell Tom Brady, 'good game.' Instead, he offered a 'See you in February,' referring to the Super Bowl. Whether Romo knew it or not, the exchange was captured by Showtime's \"Inside the NFL,\" leaving Romo with a very public declaration to live up to.\n10. The Giants choosing not to score at the end of the game\nLeading the Cowboys 23-20 and inside the five-yard line with under two minutes left, all the Giants had to do was score a touchdown to effectively end the game.\nInstead they told running back Rashad Jennings not to score. Eli Manning then threw an incomplete pass on third down, stopping the clock, and the Giants kicked a field goal.\nThe Cowboys got the ball back with 1:34 left and drove 72 yards for the game-winning touchdown, leaving Jennings not very happy when the game was over.\nOn Twitter:\n @SportsDayDFW", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/SportsDayDFW", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/dallas-cowboys/cowboys/2015/10/10/music-video-emerges-cowboys-de-greg-hardy-rapping-controversial-lyrics", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/dallas-cowboys/cowboysheadlines/2015/10/06/moore-suspension-greg-hardy-meets-media-found", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/dallas-cowboys/cowboysheadlines/2015/10/11/cowboys-rb-christine-michael-pulled-police-officer-just-take-picture"], "published": "2015-10-19T00:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T20:02:01.230+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
