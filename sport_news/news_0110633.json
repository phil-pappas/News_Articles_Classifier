Bayern and Olympiakos Piraeus have six points apiece, Dinamo Zagreb and Arsenal three each.\n\"They dominated the game, we knew they would do that but finally we managed to score and then finished with Mezut's goal,\" Giroud told BT Sport. \"We played against a fantastic team. (The win) is nice for the future.\"\nThe highlight of an outstanding first half of superb football came in the 34th minute when Neuer made a brilliant stop, leaping low to his left to save a powerfully executed, goalbound close-range header from Theo Walcott.\nNeuer had earlier pushed away another shot from Ozil, while at the other end Petr Cech blocked a point-blank shot after 11 minutes from Thiago, then tipped another effort from the electrifying Douglas Costa away for a corner after Costa had capitalised on a mistake in midfield by Alexis Sanchez.\nAlthough there were no goals before the break, both teams produced football of the highest quality with Bayern's relentless attacking, prompted by Arturo Vidal and Costa, penning Arsenal back for long periods, but Arsenal looking dangerous every time they counter-attacked.\nThe pace never relented from the kickoff, which some 300 Bayern fans missed as they staged a \"stay-away\" for the first five minutes to protest over the cost of a ticket for the match, but when they took their seats, applause rang around the stadium from both home and visiting supporters.\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/AO_Sports", "https://www.facebook.com/AhramOnlineSports?fref=ts"], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T09:14:26.380+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
