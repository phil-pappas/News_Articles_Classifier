I guess we'll just see tomorrow. It was just a sharp pain. That's all I can tell you.\n\"I shot a runner in the lane and felt the pain. I still don't know when it happened.\"\nClarkson said he told Lakers athletic trainer Gary Vitti about the pain he felt and that Vitti told him it was best to be \"precautionary.\"\n\"My arm, it felt numb for a second,\" Clarkson said. \"I came to the bench and coach got me right out. I just told them it just felt numb.\nClarkson said he first began to have problems with his shoulder after the Lakers played the Portland Trail Blazers Monday night.\n\"But it was nothing serious,\" he said.\nWhen Scott was told the news by Vitti about Clarkson, Scott just shook his head and crossed his arms.\nThe Lakers were already playing without guard Kobe Bryant (bruised lower left leg).\nClarkson had been a bright spot for the Lakers last season, earning All-NBA rookie first-team honors after averaging 11.9 points, 3.5 assists and 3.2 rebounds in 59 games, 38 as a starter.\nClarkson had started all eight exhibition games for the Lakers and had been penciled in as the starter for Wednesday night.\n\"It's pretty frustrating because that kid has done so well for us in the preseason,\" Scott said. \"He's played so hard, and obviously even with this, he has a very bright future. But obviously it puts a damper on the way we want to start the season. It might be without him next Wednesday.\"\nBryant \"gearing up\" for opener\nAfter a conversation earlier on Thursday with Bryant, Scott said his guard said he was \"gearing up\" for the season opener after missing the last three exhibition games.\n\"And I said, 'Good, because that's what I'm gearing up for as well,'\" Scott said. \"So, yeah, there's no doubt in my mind and I'm pretty sure it'll take a whole lot to keep him out of that game.\"\nEtc: Scott said he'll wait until the next four or five days of practice before he and Lakers general manager Mitch Kupchak make their final cuts. The Lakers, who have 17 players on their roster, have get down to the league maximum 15 by Monday.\n(c)2015 Los Angeles Times\nVisit the Los Angeles Times at www.latimes.com\nDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.\nShare Comment", "external_links": ["http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/basketball/s-1742089&h=Clarkson+injured+in+Lakers%27+136%2D97+loss+to+Warriors", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/basketball/s-1742089&hashtags=ArcaMax", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/basketball/s-1742089"], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T13:17:06.106+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
