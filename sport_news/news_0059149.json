The team has lost three straight games with Brandon Weeden as the starter.\nKeeping things simple has been the priority for Cassel, 33, as he took over the first-team reps during last week’s bye week.\n“I tell them, ‘You get open,’” Cassel said of receivers. “And then they tell me, ‘Just throw me the ball.’ Usually it works a lot like that. Hopefully we simplify it rather than make it more complicated.”\nThis already has been a celebratory past week for Cassel, whose wife gave birth to their fourth child, Clayton Cassel, on Saturday. That news continued what has been a whirlwind month for the quarterback, who was acquired in a Sept. 22 trade with the Buffalo Bills.\nIt remains to be seen whether Cassel will have more success than Weeden, who did not take many chances downfield. A conservative game plan restricted opportunities, but the limited passing game allowed defenses to focus on stopping the Cowboys’ running game.\nCassel, whose best NFL stretches came in 2008 with the New England Patriots and in 2010 with the Kansas City Chiefs, is more inclined to take chances downfield.\n“I think you’ll see more attempted plays from him than we got from Weeden,” Cowboys owner Jerry Jones said Tuesday on KRLD-FM radio in Dallas. “You could have more bad plays, but you got the chance to have some plays 20 yards or longer.”\nStarting Cassel is among the offensive changes the Cowboys will make Sunday. Rookie left guard La’el Collins will start over Ron Leary. And running back Christine Michael likely will be given more opportunities.\nGiants coach Tom Coughlin said the coaching staff has studied tape of Cassel dating to 2008, when he helped lead the Patriots to 10 wins after replacing an injured Tom Brady.\n“He turned in an outstanding year,” Coughlin said of Cassel, who threw 21 touchdowns and completed 63.4% of his passes in 2008. “Tall man, pocket passer, rhythm, does a nice job in there in terms of the rhythmic passing game and distributes the ball well.”\nCassel said he has never viewed himself as anything other than an NFL starter.\n“I think you have to,” he said. “And I think that’s why I’ve had longevity in this league.”\nFollow Eric Prisbell on Twitter @EricPrisbell .\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.twitter.com/EricPrisbell", "http://www.usatoday.com/sports/", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T04:06:03.596+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
