Warren St., Syracuse, N.Y. 13202. @MinkNate how are ticket sales looking for tomorrow? — Nick (@BigNickolas46) October 23, 2015 \nSure, you can complain about overkill on the attendance issue all you want. But what's it say when this is seemingly always on the minds of fans? \nThe athletic administration certainly isn't ducking it. It recently created a fan council to help tackle this very issue. \nAs for Saturday's game against Pittsburgh, there might have been potential for a spike in individual sales had the Orange handled its business on the road the previous two weeks. \nBut, sitting here with three wins and three losses, the betting money would lean toward comparable attendance figures to the opening three games of the season, when Syracuse hovered around the 30,000 mark. \nThe ticket map on cuse.com indicates available seating in nearly every section. While we know Riley Dixon could quickly & easily solve the Syrian crisis, would it be worth him missing a game? https://t.co/6HmepJC2dZ — David Hale (@DavidHaleESPN) October 23, 2015 \nThe bye week would've been an ideal time for that, but alas, Dixon went duck hunting . \nIf Dixon were to miss a game, senior Ryan Norton is listed as the backup punter. He was a long jumper, sprinter and lacrosse player in high school, so there is plenty of athleticism at that position. \nBoth Dixon and Norton are out of eligibility after this season, leaving the punting position in the hands of Florida native Sterling Hofrichter.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T18:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T21:19:51.116+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
