Christy Cabrera Chirinos Contact Reporter South Florida Sun Sentinel Butch Davis would love to return as the Miami Hurricanes' head coach \nA day after Miami fired Al Golden, one former Hurricanes coach wasted no time in expressing his desire to return to Coral Gables and try – again – to restore Miami to national prominence. \nDuring his weekly radio segment with 790 The Ticket on Monday morning, former Hurricanes coach Butch Davis, 63, said he hopes the school considers him for its vacant coaching job and that he’s already put together a list of potential assistant coaches and coordinators to consider if he were hired. \n“Obviously, I’d love to be considered for that opportunity and time will tell if whether or not that’s the direction the school would like to go,” Davis said. “I’ve told people many, many times that everything that I ever accomplished as a coach has its roots in Miami. I would have never gotten a chance to be a part of Super Bowl teams with Jimmy [Johnson] and some of the national championships that we played for in the 1980s as an assistant coach. ... They gave me the first opportunity to be a head coach at the collegiate level and then to get a chance to coach in the NFL. The relationships with the players, you spend 11 years there, you’ve got an awful lot invested in the community and hopefully, maybe, my name will be one that will get an opportunity to be considered.” \nMonday’s interview wasn’t the first time Davis has stated his desire to return to Miami. As pressure mounted on Golden in recent seasons, Davis has been repeatedly asked if he’d be interested in returning to Miami and he’s said he would be, if the job were to become open. \nAnd his name has long been one fans and former players have mentioned when discussing who they’d like to see replace Golden, despite how Davis’ first tenure as Hurricanes coach ended. \nPHOTO GALLERY: Several notable names have surfaced as possible replacements for Al Golden, who was fired as UM coach. \nHe was named Miami’s coach in 1995, replacing Dennis Erickson, and guided the program through crippling NCAA sanctions and building the roster that won Miami a national title in 2001 and is considered one of – if not the best – team in college football history. \nBut Davis never coached that championship team, opting instead to take a job as coach of the Cleveland Browns in 2001, paving the way for former assistant Larry Coker to lead the Hurricanes. \nThe way Davis left the school may have left a sour taste in the mouths of some in the Miami community, and could create a roadblock for him to return. But with Miami coming off the wake of another NCAA investigation, Davis’ tenure at North Carolina may also be a factor.

And he’d like to do it at Miami, where he went 51-16 from 1995-2000. \n“There’s no school in America, and I don’t care who it is, that has that tight bond that you were part of that program,” Davis said. “You’re a Cane for life. That’s a big part of it.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T17:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T19:57:20.745+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
