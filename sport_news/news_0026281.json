(Photo: Kirby Lee, USA TODAY)\n191 CONNECT 72 TWEET 7 LINKEDIN 15 COMMENT EMAIL MORE NEW YORK – The NFL could launch additional international series in Mexico and perhaps Germany and take the Pro Bowl outside the country in the coming years, too, as the league continues to aim to expand its borders.\nOwners approved a resolution at the NFL meetings Wednesday that extends the league’s ability to play international regular-season games through 2025 – including outside the United Kingdom, where it has held a dozen games at London’s Wembley Stadium since 2007.\nThe NFL agreed earlier this year with the English Premier League’s Tottenham Hotspur to play two games per year at the team’s new stadium, which is due to open in the summer of 2018.\n“We’d like to see if we can add a game in a new country for 2016 if we can,” said Mark Waller, executive vice president of NFL International. “That’s our goal.”\nUSA TODAY\nBrennan: Greg Hardy remains unapologetic, yet will be cheered on Sunday\nNo international games for 2016 are finalized, Waller said, but he said he’d be shocked if there aren’t three games at Wembley Stadium for a third straight year. The priority for an additional game is Mexico City.\n“That’s our biggest fan base,” Waller said. “It’s our most vibrant market. Our business is really good there. Our ratings performance is good and you’ve got huge synergy with the U.S.-Hispanic growth and population here. So, I think if we can do that, that would be a logical place to start.”\nThe league remains “hugely excited” about Germany as well, Waller said, though he strongly suggested a game in Mexico could be the start of a series as opposed to a one-off event in hopes of building the consistency the league has in London.\n“We want to build a fan base,” Waller said. “It’s not about bringing a circus to town.”\nThe NFL is limited to a degree by inventory. Each regular-season game scheduled means one team giving up a home game, which many are reluctant to do. The league also is somewhat limited geographically, Waller said, because it would be difficult logistically to play a regular-season game in, say, Asia and have it be competitive.\nThat issue wouldn’t necessarily exist with the Pro Bowl, which could feasibly be on the move as soon as the 2017 season, Waller said. He mentioned Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; South Africa; and Australia as places that might be attractive to players and the league for a year-end celebration.\n“It’s a very different animal,” Waller said.\nFollow Tom Pelissero on Twitter @TomPelissero\nVIDEO PLAYLIST: LATEST FROM THE NFL Los Angeles in spotlight at NFL owners meetings | 01:36 USA TODAY Sports' Tom Pelissero explains everything that happened at the NFL owners meetings Wednesday.
