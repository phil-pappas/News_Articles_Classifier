Servais expected to be named Mariners... \nThe Royals, who lost to the San Francisco Giants in seven games in the 2014 World Series, will play the New York Mets, beginning Tuesday at Kansas City. \nCain led off the inning with an eight-pitch walk from 20-year-old right-handed closer Roberto Osuna. Hosmer pulled a 2-2 pitch into right field. Third base coach Mike Jirschele waved Cain home and he scored when shortstop Troy Tulowitzki's relay throw was up the line. \nThe Blue Jays threatened in the ninth off Wade Davis. Catcher Russell Martin led off the inning with a single, his first hit in the series. Dalton Pompey ran for Martin and promptly stole second and third with none out. Davis walked Kevin Pillar, who stole second. Davis recovered by striking out pinch hitter Dioner Navarro and Ben Revere. Then he got Josh Donaldson to ground out to end the game to pick up the victory. \nThe Royals had to overcome two Jose Bautista home runs. \nKansas City took a 3-1 lead into the eighth when Bautista homered with Ben Revere on base. Bautista, who hit 40 home runs in the regular season, yanked a Ryan Madson 96 mile per hour fastball into the left field seats. \nBautista silenced the sold out Kauffman Stadium crowd of 40,494 that had been booing his every plate-appearance and catch in right field. He also homered in the fourth, becoming the first Blue Jay in franchise history with a multi-homer postseason game. \nRoyals right-hander Yordano Ventura was pulled with one out in the sixth after yielding a double to Edwin Encarnacion. Ventura allowed one run on four hits in 5 1/3 innings, striking out five and walking two. He threw 77 pitches, 51 for strikes. \nKelvin Herrera replaced Ventura and retired all five batters he faced, striking out two, before turning over a two-run lead to Madson in the eighth that he failed to keep for three hitters. \nMoustakas led off the seventh with a splintered-bat single to center. Catcher Salvador Perez drove a David Price pitch to the left-field bullpen fence, but Ben Revere made a spectacular leaping grab to rob him of extra-bases. Moustakas advanced to third on left fielder Alex Gordon's ground out. \nPrice did not finish the inning as rookie right-hander Aaron Sanchez was brought in to face Alex Rios with two out. Rios laced a single to left, scoring Moustakas. Price, who was the losing pitcher in his first seven career postseason starts, got a no-decision this time, thanks to Bautista. He left after 6 2/3 innings, charged with three runs on five hits, two of them home runs in the first two innings. \nThere was a 45-rain delay after the top of the eighth inning. \nWhile the Blue Jays topped the majors with 232 home runs during the regular season, the Royals used the long ball to grab an early 2-0 lead. \nSecond baseman Ben Zobrist punched a David Price 91 mph cutter out to left on a 1-1 count in the first inning for his second home run in this ALCS. \nIn the second inning, Moustakas belted a Price changeup over the right-field fence. Blue Jays manager John Gibbons requested a review though, claiming a fan in the first row reached over the wall. After a 107-second delay, the homer stood. \nThe Blue Jays flexed their muscles in the fourth with a Bautista solo home run. Bautista destroyed Ventura's 96-mile per hour fastball with a towering shot out to left. No review was necessary for that one, an estimated 428 feet. \nNOTES: Royals SS Alcides Escobar on why he likes swinging at the first pitch: \"Ninety-nine percent is a fastball right there in the strike zone.\" ... RHP Marco Estrada had a 2.33 ERA in three postseason starts. Only RHP Juan Guzman, a 1.71 ERA in three 1992 starts, has a lower ERA for the Blue Jays in a single postseason. ... Royals manager Ned Yost now has 18 career postseason victories, passing Joe Maddon for sixth among active managers.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T09:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T09:36:10.551+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
