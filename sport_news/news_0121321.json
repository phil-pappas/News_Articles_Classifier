It's a real cat ?? #wtf pic.twitter.com/LtsQAQjqxP\n— Julie Couret (@JCWilloz) October 16, 2015 This raised questions among the Black and Gold faithful.\nHOW IS THERE AN ACTUAL CAT HANGING OUT AT THE SUPERDOME IN A VERA BRADLEY BAG.\n— lMn (@_MidwestMess) October 16, 2015 @JCWilloz @nflcatwatch Cats in the dome. Saints win. Coincidence?\n— Ganondward (@Ganondward) October 16, 2015 It led to clever puns.\n. @JCWilloz @cmadmax I think we can genuinely say here: The cat is out of the bag.\n— Lee in Iowa (@Lee_in_Iowa) October 16, 2015 Journalists stopped what they were doing to get answers.\nRan all the way to Section 624 but the cat is gone. Folks in the section say it's a service animal, guy got off flight, cat was freaked.\n— Jason Saul (@jasonmsaul) October 16, 2015 And it possibly sparked a new tradition.\n@JCWilloz if Saints can hold on and win tonight this cat is coming to every game\n— Balki Bartokomous (@wargote4) October 16, 2015 And in true social media form, #WhoCat is trending in New Orleans the day after the game.\nCopyright 2015 WVUE.
