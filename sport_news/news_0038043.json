Posted: Thursday, October 15, 2015 4:00 pm Trojans try to maintain momentum By JOSH FLICKINGER Staff writer beloitdailynews.com | 0 comments BELOIT, Wis. — Celebrating? That’s for after the season. No matter the Beloit Turner football team knocked off Edgerton to clinch its first playoff birth since 1992 and first conference title since 1988. The 6-2 Trojans have a game to prepare for. Turner will welcome in Jefferson, which lost its starting quarterback Jack Cincotta in the second half of Friday’s loss to Clinton. Cincotta, who has rushed for over 1,000 yards, is expected to miss the game with an ankle injury. Trojans senior Justin Hansen said the team has kept focused despite a few distractions. “Practice has gone pretty well this week,” Hansen said. “This has been a very special season. After we played Clinton close, I knew we were going to be able to play well the rest of the way.” Hansen said Friday night’s game is critical. “This is a huge game for us,” Hansen said. “This game could be the difference between a three-seed and a five-seed, which would mean a home game. We haven’t been in the playoffs for over 20 years, so to go on the road for the first game in hostile territory would be tough. We’d rather be home and feeling good about ourselves.” Hansen said quarterback Seth Smith is expected to make the start under center, with Juan Reyes getting a handful of snaps at the position as well. “With Juan and me back there, you kind of have to pick your poison,” Hansen said. “You can either get run over by me or juked out by Juan. That’s kind of the way it’s been going.” • EDGERTON (3-5) at CLINTON (4-4): The Cougars, fresh off clinching their first conference title ever, will host the Crimson Tide Friday. Clinton will try to make its case for a better seed by finishing with a winning record. Running back Jordan Jones was the star for Clinton in last week’s 34-20 win over Jefferson. Playing without leading rusher Peyton Pope, Jones more than took up the slack. He carried the ball 27 times for 299 yards. Michah Rudd is Edgerton’s main offensive weapon, having rushed for over 700 yards. He hurt Turner to the tune of 162 yards and all five touchdowns in a 35-33 loss last week. • EAST TROY at BRODHEAD-JUDA (5-3): The Cardinals have lost two straight since rattling off a four-game winning streak in the middle of the season. Two of Brodhead-Juda’s four losses have come to Evansville-Albany, one of the state’s top teams in Division 4. After dropping a tight 14-12 decision in week two, the Cards fell 49-19 Friday night. “We have to get back to playing Brodhead-Juda football,” head coach B.J. Bockhop said. “We’ve been in a funk lately. Offensively we’ve been moving the ball, but we have to improve defensively. Evansville has gotten so much better since the second week of the season. They are really hitting on all cylinders right now.” Bockhop said East Troy’s explosive offense will be a significant challenge. “Their quarterback has a cannon for an arm,” Bockhop said. “But they want to run it first. They’ve got two backs close to 1,000 yards. So we’re concentrating on the run, and we will do our best to put pressure on the quarterback and hopefully force some mistakes.” Bockhop said it hasn’t been difficult to get his team up for the game. “This is senior night, and it could be the last time our seniors are ever on this field,” Bockhop said. “And then if we win, I really think we’ve got a chance to get a home game in Level 1 of the playoffs.” • EVANSVILLE-ALBANY at BIG FOOT: The Blue Devils have been challenged in just one game this season, and that was in week two against Brodhead-Juda. Since then, they’ve rolled over the opposition. Big Foot coach Greg Enz said the Blue Devils’ size stands out. “They aren’t overly fast or athletic,” Enz said. “But they have some huge kids. There isn’t a small kid in the bunch. And the other thing is they don’t make mistakes. They don’t turn the ball over, they don’t have holding penalties that put them behind the chains. They don’t ever have their gas to the floor, but they are at a steady 55 for four quarters. You have to maintain with them or they will continue to pull away.” The Chiefs will be forced to play without the services of sophomore standout Jackson Enz, who injured his knee early in the Chiefs’ loss at East Troy. “This is a great football team we are playing,” Coach Enz said. “And we’ve been competitive every single week. We are trying to bring the mentality of going out there and being competitive again. We’re going to have to go out there and punch them in the mouth. We can’t back down at all.” • PECATONICA (1-6) at SOUTH BELOIT (0-7): It’s homecoming in South Beloit, and the SoBos need some good spirit after a disheartening loss to Eastland-Pearl City last week. The SoBos were defeated 52-7 in the battle of winless teams. Friday represents the last realistic opportunity for a win for the SoBos. • NORTH BOONE (4-3) at RICHMOND-BURTON (6-1): The Vikings are coming off a disappointing home loss to Genoa-Kingston in which they were not competitive. The 47-14 loss was particularly damaging considering the Vikings need just one more victory to become playoff-eligible, but most defeat either 6-1 Richmond Burton or 7-0 Marengo, with both games coming on the road. • HARLEM (5-2) at HONONEGAH (5-2): The Indians play one of their biggest games of the season when they travel to fellow 5-2 Harlem. Both teams still have NIC-10 title hopes, as they along with Belvidere North sit one game behind 6-1 Auburn with two games to play. The Huskies were the NIC-10’s surprise team to open the season, rattling off five consecutive wins to begin the slate. Losses to Belvidere and Auburn in the past two weeks set up this critical clash. The Indians went through a two-game losing streak of their own before administering a 62-14 beating of conference doormat Jefferson on Friday. It was a breakout performance for the offense, but it remains to be seen how the outburst will translate when taking on higher quality opponents. Hononegah will still be without quarterback Daytona Chandler, who is recovering from a collarbone injury suffered against Auburn. • BELOIT MEMORIAL (0-8) at MADISON LA FOLLETTE (6-2): The Purple Knights will try to snap a 20-game losing skid to officially end their Big Eight season Friday night. Beloit scheduled a non-conference game against Milwaukee North Thursday. The Lancers represent yet another difficult challenge for the Knights to overcome. La Follette stands at 6-2 and have particularly excelled on the defensive side of the ball. The Lancers haven’t give up more than 25 points in a game all season, and have yielded under 10 points in half of their eight games. • MCFARLAND (1-7) at PARKVIEW (3-5): The Vikings will seek a three-game winning streak for the first time since 2010 when they began the season 3-0. Parkview’s Hunter Marshall became the school’s all-time leading rusher with another solid effort in a victory over Whitewater last week. Vikings coach Bob Meyers said although the team isn’t fighting for a playoff berth, they are hungry for their fourth win of the season. “These kids are really focused on winning,” Meyers said. “It’s too bad we didn’t have another win heading into the final week, but they have been very serious and focused all week in practice.” McFarland should provide good fodder for the Vikings. The Spartans squeaked out their first win of the season against Palmyra-Eagle last week, a 28-27 triumph that snapped a nine-game losing streak dating back to last season. McFarland’s struggles have come mainly on the offensive side of the ball. In six of McFarland’s eight games, they have scored six points or less.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T00:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T10:09:03.552+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
