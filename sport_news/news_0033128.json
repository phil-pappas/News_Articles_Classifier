In a matchup Sunday at Verizon Center against Bauru, a Brazilian team, the third-year swingman from Georgetown, he pulled off quite the dribbling exhibition and even finished the play with a rather nice finger roll. \nThe are two things to note here: \nThis was a nicely aggressive move even without the Harlem Globetrotter move, that might have led to a pretty nasty dunk. \nBut what makes this extra funny is Drew Gooden III’s reaction, who even off the initial fumble is out of his seat with his hands on his head, and then just starts screaming jubilantly in Porter’s face when the bucket finally drops. \nThe look of exsaperation on Bauru No. 23’s face ties the clip up nicely.
