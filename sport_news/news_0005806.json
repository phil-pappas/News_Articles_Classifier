Fantasy sports fans wonder if the games are rigged \nAre fantasy sports rigged? \nThat's what millions of fantasy players are wondering after it was revealed this week that a DraftKings employee won $350,000 in a weekly NFL contest on rival FanDuel. That same employee had access to company data that could... More \nOfficials said the sites can't operate in Nevada without a gambling license. \nThe decision comes amid a growing backlash against the sites, including a federal probe into the sites' activities. \nDraftKings and FanDuel said their sites provide games of skill and not chance, the AP said, and are protected under federal law. The games are legal in 45 states, the wire service said. Nevada's Gaming Control Board issued the notice on Thursday, saying the sites have to stop letting residents in the state play. Regulators told the AP that the sites can apply for licenses. \nThe federal probe is being led by the US Attorney's Office in Boston, law enforcement officials told CNN. Boston is the home of DraftKings. FanDuel is based in New York. \nLast week, the sites confirmed confirmed that a DraftKing employee had won $350,000 in prize money in a FanDuel game. The employee had access to confidential company data, although both sites insist that he did not have the information before making his choices in the FanDuel game and did nothing improper. But news of his win, and FanDuel's confirmation that DraftKings employees have won millions when playing its games, have raised questions about whether the games are being manipulated by players with insider information. \nBoth sites have since permanently banned their employees from playing fantasy sports for money, and said they would no longer accept entries from employees of other sites. But that did little to quiet calls for government action. \nNew York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman announced a probe of DraftKings and FanDuel last week, and set an Oct. 15 deadline for the services to turn over a trove of information, including policies about data usage and employees. Members of congress have also called for hearings on the matter, federal oversight by agencies such as the Federal Trade Commission and possible legislative action. \nSpokespeople for DraftKings did not immediately have a comment on word of the federal probe or whether they would meet Thursday's deadline from Schneiderman's office. FanDuel spokeswoman Emily Bass said \"we're cooperating with all parties about how to define the right set of rules for our industry as it continues to grow.\" \nThe sites are also facing civil lawsuits from players who argue that they were hurt by the fact that so many fantasy site employees win prizes. \nDespite the insider information allegations, fans have continued to flock to the sites to compete for prizes. In fact, DraftKings and FanDuel both had their best weeks ever last weekend, according to a fantasy tracking service. Still fans are worried that prosecutions or new government regulations could hurt the industry. \n\"I think that's the biggest worry that any of us really have right now. You never know what's going to happen,\" said said Dan Back, a partner with RotoGrinders, a news site for daily fantasy sports players. \nInvestigators will also look at whether fantasy sites improperly allowed people to play even if they lived in a state where fantasy sports are illegal. Federal law explicitly allows fantasy sports despite a prohibition on sports gambling. The five states where fantasy sports are illegal are Arizona, Iowa, Louisiana, Montana and Washington. One of the federal lawsuits was filed by a player who lives in New Orleans.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T03:40:24.613+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
