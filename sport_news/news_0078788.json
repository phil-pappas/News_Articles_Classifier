We're still a powerhouse.\" \nWith lopsided losses to division rival St. Augustine Prep in the season opener and to Maryland power Mt. St. Joseph on Oct. 10, St. Joseph has struggled a bit to find its footing this season. \nBut the Wildcats looked familiar on a cool, gray afternoon on their home field, controlling the line of scrimmage and unleashing a potent ground game. \n\"I liked the way we ran the football,\" St. Joseph coach Paul Sacco said. \nMore than a few St. Joseph fans probably were enthused by the play of several freshmen and sophomores. \nSophomore Qwashin Townsel, a fullback playing his second game after sitting out the first four as a transfer from Holy Spirit, ran for 124 yards and a touchdown on 17 carries. \n\"He's a baby but he's going to be a good one for us,\" Sacco said of Townsel. \nFreshman DeAndre Kennedy, a star on the ninth-grade team that has been overpowering the competition, scored his first varsity touchdown on a 12-yard run in the fourth quarter, and several other freshmen and sophomores were making plays against a Group 5 opponent. \n\"Some of these young kids can really play,\" Sacco said. \nSt. Joseph has won six consecutive state titles and 24 overall, so the Wildcats have as much tradition as any program in South Jersey. \nAnd the future looks bright based on the presence of several promising underclassmen. \nBut for seniors such and Lomax and Horne, as well as Salaam Horne - A'Laam's twin - and several others, the focus is 2015. \n\"It's been frustrating because we haven't been at our best,\" A'Laam Horne said. \"But we came together today. We're going to go from here. We still can win a state title.\" \nLomax said putting half-a-hundred on the scoreboard against a talented opponent felt like old times - and might have been a preview of times to come as well. \n\"This was the type of game we've been used to in the past,\" Lomax said. \"It was St. Joseph football, manhandling teams. \n\"I think we're going to build off of this.\" \nAtlantic City 0 8 0 7 - 15 \nSt. Joseph 0 20 21 12 - 00 \nSJ: Keagan Harvin 15 run (Eric Graziano kick) \nAC: Aaron Jackson 1 run (Dapree Wright pass from Ishmial Shukur) \nSJ: A'Laam Horne 3 run (Graziano kick) \nSJ: Matt Tucker 38 pass from Salaam Horne (kick fail) \nSJ: A.
