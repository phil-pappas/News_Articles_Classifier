No, they won’t have the worst start in franchise history, and yes, despite earlier evidence to the contrary, they can still play at an elite level.\nAfter three dreadful losses, the Kings had an all-around strong effort but still needed overtime to record their first victory of the season, 2-1, over the Minnesota Wild in front of 18,230 at Staples Center.\nAnze Kopitar scored 2:19 into the first 3-on-3 overtime in Kings history.\nThe Kings, who totaled only two goals in their first three games, avoided their first 0-4 start. They led 1-0 on Tyler Toffoli’s second-period power-play goal before Minnesota’s Mikko Koivu tied the score with a third-period power-play goal.\nKings goalie Jonathan Quick, who struggled in his first two games, had a second consecutive solid effort (25 saves) against Minnesota, which played the night before in Arizona and looked flat until the third period.\n“We were happy with our effort but now it's just time to build on that and keep going,” Kings defenseman Drew Doughty said. “I just think that everybody was ready for the game. In the other games, we maybe had four or five guys ready to go, but not everybody.”\nThe best news for the Kings? Some of their most-talented players were their best players against the Wild.\nThe newly constructed second line of Milan Lucic, Jeff Carter and Toffoli generated chances throughout the game and also teamed up for the Kings’ first goal. Team captain Dustin Brown, recently promoted to the first line, recorded six shots on goal, most of any Kings player this season.\n“A lot of times, the first win is the hardest one to get, and we saw that tonight,” Lucic said. “We didn't want to keep the losing streak going and the embarrassment. We were engaged right from the drop of the puck.”\nIn general, the Kings played a much sharper, more tenacious game than in their three losses. The defensemen were more stout in their zone and made crisper breakout passes, even though they failed to capitalize on frequent quality net-front scoring chances.\nThe Kings wobbled a bit early in the first period but were able to generate some momentum with a power play midway through the period. The Kings were 0 for 14 on the power play when they finally broke through, 1:13 into the second period.\nThat’s when Carter entered the Minnesota zone then passed left to Lucic, who looked up and made a perfect diagonal pass toward Toffoli. Without breaking stride, Toffoli took the pass and fired a shot past Darcy Keumper for a 1-0 Kings lead.\nDefenseman Derek Forbort, the Kings’ first-round draft pick in 2010, made his NHL debut as expected, as veteran defenseman Matt Greene missed the game with an upper-body injury. Forbort, a native of Duluth, Minn., was paired with veteran Christian Ehrhoff.\nContact the writer: rhammond@ocregister.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T17:29:04.395+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
