The Redskins are coming off a heartbreaking overtime time loss to the Atlanta Falcons in week five, while the Jets are fresh off their bye week. \nHere's who to start and who to sit based on the match up against New York. \nStart 'Em: WR Jamison Crowder \nFrankly, the match up against the Jets does not favor any of the Redskins' offensive players. The Jets allow the second fewest fantasy points to opposing quarterbacks (9 PPG), the third fewest to opposing running backs (11 PPG) and the eighth fewest to opposing wide receivers (18 PPG) according to ESPN fantasy statistics . \nCrowder has been sneaky good in his past two games, totaling 15 catches for 152 yards. Crowder's true value is in points per reception (PPR) leagues. He has yet to find the endzone this year and has yet to eclipse 100 receiving yards, but his remains a solid fantasy option because of the volume of targets he sees. \nOct 11, 2015; Atlanta, GA, USA; Washington Redskins wide receiver Jamison Crowder (80) makes a catch in the fourth quarter of their game against the Atlanta Falcons at the Georgia Dome.

Cousins looks for Crowder when he needs a quick completion, hence why the receptions have been piling up for the rookie wide out from Duke. Not to mention, Crowder returns punts, so he has additional value in that regard. \nThe Redskins' offense has a tough test ahead of them in the Jets' defense, but we expect Crowder to continue to be quietly productive. He may not score. He may not even surpass 75 receiving yards, but his receptions should continue to stack up. He is a solid WR2 or flex option, especially in PPR leagues. \nSit 'Em: RB's Alfred Morris and Matt Jones \nAs previously stated, the Redskins' offense is running into a brick wall of a Jets' defense who dominates against the run and the pass. But the Jets have been out of this world when it comes to stopping the run this year. The Jets have allowed a league-low 266 rushing yards this season, the only team in the NFL to hold their opponents to less than 300 rushing yards collectively on the season. \nJones and Morris have been hit or miss this year so far. Morris has yet to find the endzone, but he has outpaced Jones is rushing yards. Jones has found the endzone three times this year, but has seen his role somewhat diminish after his breakout performance against the Rams in week two. \nOct 11, 2015; Atlanta, GA, USA; Washington Redskins running back Matt Jones (31) scores a rushing touchdown against Atlanta Falcons strong safety William Moore (25) in the fourth quarter of their game at the Georgia Dome. The Falcons won 25-19 in overtime.

In fact, Washington's Chris Thompson may be a better option this week at running back because of his ability to catch the ball and because of his role on Washington third downs. Thompson could be a decent flex option in PPR leagues if you're in a squeeze. \nLike us on Facebook !", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T23:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T00:05:20.132+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
