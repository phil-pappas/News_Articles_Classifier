Since Freeney has missed five games, that amount is decreased to about $685,000. \nHis one-year deal does include incentives for sacks, according to the source. \nThe Cardinals needed outside pass rush help even before starting outside linebacker Alex Okafor suffered a calf injury Sunday against the Lions. Arizona Cardinals no longer picture of health \nThe team is awaiting the results of Okafor’s MRI, coach Bruce Arians said, but Okafor is expected to miss extended time. \nOkafor is the team’s best pass rusher, so his injury made finding another pass rusher an even higher priority. \nArians said on Monday, however, that a deal with Freeney was not in place. Rewind: A look at Cardinals' win over Lions \n“We’re just waiting to see what we’re going to do,” he said. “We’ll still have to find how long (Okafor) is going to be. And we’ll see what other options are available and go from there.” \nThe Cardinals have been interested in Freeney since July, according to sources, but the veteran pass rusher wanted more money than the team was willing to pay. \nFive games into the season, both sides had added incentive to get a deal done. \nThe Cardinals have only seven sacks through five games, and their sack-per-pass-attempt percentage, 4.15, is 25th in the 32-team league. Okafor leads the team in sacks with two, both coming in Week 1. Cardinals XTRA app: Get the latest news, analysis, scores, more \nSacks aren’t the only way to measure pressure on the quarterback, and Arians has consistently said he’s been satisfied with the pass rush. The Cardinals also have intercepted 11 passes, most in the NFL, so it's not as if the pass defense has been poor. \nFreeney, 35, played 11 seasons with the Colts and the past two with the Chargers. He made the Pro Bowl seven times and was a first-team All Pro three times. He has 111.5 sacks in his career. \nBut he’s had just nine sacks in the past three years, including 3.5 last year with the Chargers. Bickley: Carson Palmer, Arizona Cardinals prove a point \nFreeney, however, did have 53 quarterback pressures, according to profootballfocus.com. \nCardinals coaches know Freeney well. Arians was the Colts offensive coordinator and interim coach in 2012, and defensive coordinator James Bettcher was a defense assistant on that staff. \nFreeney is expected to join the Cardinals here this week where they are preparing to play at Pittsburgh on Sunday. Cardinals rewind | Kent Somers looks back at what we learned in the Cardinals' win over the Lions in Detroit on Sunday. The Cardinals moved to 4-1 after the win. Raj Mehta/USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen What we learned on offense | Did anyone notice the Cardinals used the no-huddle offense the first two series? Me, either. It was hard to tell what was going on in those possessions. The no-huddle wasn’t a bad idea, and it's something they have worked on a lot since last spring. Debuting it at home makes more sense, where players can hear the necessary code words. Tim Fuller/USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen On Sunday, it looked like a mess, and the second possession was especially awful because Carson Palmer was sacked twice. The play that put the offense on track was Chris Johnson’s 25-yard run on the third possession. The Cardinals just lined up and ran right at the Lions. That play seemed to open everything up, including the 14-yard touchdown pass to tight end Darren Fells that ended the possession. Tim Fuller/USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen It’s amazing that Johnson, an afterthought signing, really, has now become indispensable. He has given the Cardinals a big-play threat that they haven’t had in, well, forever from an every-down running back. That one 25-yard run was the jumper cable for this offense. Rick Osentoski/AP Fullscreen Like all offensive lines, this group likes to run the ball, and doing so early gives it confidence. And clearly the group benefits from a back like Johnson, who can turn a sliver of space into four yards. Things just started to click after his long run. It helped that the defense was handing the ball back every few minutes, too. Raj Mehta/USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen What we learned on defense | It’s hard to imagine there is a better all-around secondary in the NFL right now. Certainly not when it comes to playmaking. Safety Rashad Johnson accounted for three turnovers. Cornerback Patrick Peterson, who had another interception, said teammates call Johnson “Nick Saban” because he’s such a coach on the field. Raj Mehta/USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen Safety Tony Jefferson played an excellent all-around game. He was great in run support, forced a fumble and nearly recovered another. He is the most underrated player on the team. The Cardinals continue to insist that Deone Bucannon is a safety, even though he never lines up at the position. He lines up at inside linebacker and he again appeared to play well. Raj Mehta/USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen This unit might have suffered a huge blow if Alex Okafor’s calf injury is as serious as it appears. The group’s weakness is pass rushing, especially from the outside. Okafor was it. Now, someone unproven has to step up. Markus Golden? Kareem Martin? Shaq Riddick? Duane Burleson/AP Fullscreen Via Twitter, one Cardinals fan suggested General Manager Steve Keim get on the phone and find one. Keim’s made plugging holes look easy, but if he finds a great pass rusher on the street now, the NFL might have to investigate. Because of the blowout, some defensive starters received some time off in the second half. Tim Fuller/USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen What we learned on special teams | Punter Drew Butler does a fine job of placing the ball deep into opponents’ territory. But it seems every game he has one poor punt when the Cardinals need him to boom one. On Sunday, it was a 34-yarder that the Lions fair caught at their 28. If that continues, it's going to hurt the Cardinals in a close game. Paul Sancya/AP Fullscreen The Cardinals yielded two long kick returns, 34 and 41 yards, but they almost forced a fumble on one. It’s an area that needs to improve. The Cardinals' return teams didn’t get many chances, given the Lions’ turnovers and the Cardinals’ touchdowns. Rick Osentoski/AP Player of the game | Running back Chris Johnson gained 103 yards on 11 carries, a 9.4 yard average. His 25-yard run in the first quarter helped alter the course of the game. Duane Burleson/AP Turning point | The Lions took a 7-0 lead in the first quarter and the Cardinals responded with a 71-yard drive that started with Johnson’s run. Answering that touchdown on the road was a pivotal point in the game. Tim Fuller/USA TODAY Sports Injuries | Outside linebacker Alex Okafor (calf), linebacker Kenny Demens (knee) and safety Chris Clemons (hamstring) appeared to have suffered serious injuries. Indications are that Demens suffered a torn ACL. All were scheduled to return to the Valley for MRIs. Duane Burleson/AP View from the press box | Beating the Lions might not seem like a big deal since four other teams have done it. But the Cardinals needed that victory. Raj Mehta/USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen It’s the beginning of a stretch of six of eight on the road, and the Cardinals needed to avoid heading into Pittsburgh with a 3-2 record. Plus, it’s another victory in the NFC, which could be important when it comes time to break ties for playoff purposes.
