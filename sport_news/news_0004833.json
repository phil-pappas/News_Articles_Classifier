He has six tackles for loss, three forced fumbles and three additional quarterback hits.\nAnd on Saturday against Virginia, Thompson could have his best game of the season.\nUVA quarterback Matt Johns is a traditional pocket passer, unlike LSU's Brandon Harris and USF's Quinton Flowers, and an already banged-up Cavaliers offensive line will be without starting left tackle Michael Mooney.\nThompson, who has played 113 of 126 end snaps on the right side, per Pro Football Focus, will likely line up against converted defensive lineman Jack English for most of the game. English has been playing tackle since preseason camp in 2014 and saw his first significant experience last week, filling in for Mooney in the third quarter.\nThe Cavaliers could send double teams to Thompson's side, but the unit has other holes to plug. Mooney is far from the only injury the Virginia line has dealt with this season.\nFrom Virginia Athletics :\nOffensive linemen Ryan Doull, Eric Tetlow and Jake Fieler are among the UVA players out with season-ending injuries, and none of those three appeared in a game this year. Moreover, Sean Karl, who started at left guard against William & Mary and Boise State, missed the Pitt game for medical reasons and was not listed on the depth chart released Monday. Yet another offensive lineman, Sadiq Olanrewaju, who started two games at tackle in 2014, is still recovering from offseason surgery and has yet to play this fall.\nSo keep an extra close eye on Thompson on Saturday. You may even see another bowling celebration.\nRon Thompson picks up his first sack of the afternoon and follows it up with a bowling celebration. Rolled then made an 'X' with his arms.\n— Syracuse Football (@syrfootball) October 10, 2015 Contact Stephen Bailey anytime: Email | Twitter", "external_links": ["http://www.virginiasports.com/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/101315aad.html", "http://twitter.com/stephen_bailey1", "https://twitter.com/syrfootball/status/652949463301005312"], "published": "2015-10-16T22:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T17:23:53.764+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
