Delino DeShields led off with a double and moved to third on a groundout from Shin-Soo Choo. Another groundout from Prince Fielder led to a close play at the plate, but DeShields was able to get in for the run. \nTexas' second run came in the third inning, with Shin-Soo Choo hitting a solo shot with one out. \nToronto got their first in the bottom of the inning with Cole Hamels on the mound. Ben Revere reach first with an infield single, then scored on a double from Jose Bautista. \nThings settled down until the sixth inning when Edwin Encarnacion crushed a ball to left-center, bringing the score to 2-2. \nThe Rangers were able to take the lead in the seventh in a bizarre fashion. Rougned Odor singled, went to second to second on a sacrifice bunt from Gimenez, and third on a groundout from DeShields. While Choo was batting, Jays' catcher Russell Martin attempted to throw a ball back to the mound, but instead it ricocheted off Choo's bat to allowed Odor to score. \nMadness ensued in Toronto, with trash being flung onto the field and animated discussions taking place. The Jays officially agreed to play under protest and the game headed to the bottom of the seventh. \nIt only got more bizarre from there. The inning opened up with three straight error, two from Elvis Andrus and one from Mitch Moreland, to load the bases with no outs. A fielder's choice from Revere resulted in an out at home, and Sam Dyson came on to pitch for Hamels. \nA bloop single from Josh Donaldson, right over the head of Odor, tied the game but resulted in one out at the bases. Bautista followed it with a three-run homer to give the Blue Jays the imminent 6-3 lead. \nThe Blue Jays bullpen did what they needed to do, holding the Rangers offense scoring for the eighth and ninth innings to finish it off. \nThe Rangers had jumped out to a 2-0 advantage against the Jays in the ALDS, but lose the next two games at home to see the series tied at 2-2. \nIt was a heartbreaking way for the season to come to an end, but for the Texas Rangers, the worst team in the American League in 2014, to make it to the ALDS and push it to a Game 5 against arguably the best team in baseball, was a success.
