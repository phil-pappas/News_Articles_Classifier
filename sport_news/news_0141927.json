The Keystone Rifle Range MMRP information repository is located at the following location: Sonora Public Library 480 Greenley Road Sonora, CA 95370 The public is invited to visit the library to review the contents of the Administrative Record File and information repository. If you have any questions about the Keystone Rifle Range Military Munitions Response Program, Administrative Record File, or information repository contact Patrick Shaw, Army National Guard, at (703) 607-7199 or e-mail to patrick.p.shaw2.civ@mail.mil . Restoration Advisory Board Part of the U.S. Army's environmental program is to ensure that the community is involved in all aspects of the munitions investigation at the Keystone Rifle Range MRS. Community involvement is achieved through, but not limited to, public notices published in local newspapers, maintaining an administrative record file, and community participation in a Restoration Advisory Board (RAB). The purpose of a RAB is to provide a forum for community members who may be interested or affected by the investigation and clean-up activities at former U.S. Army training areas. RAB members meet on a regular basis to review and comment on contamination data and plans related to the clean-up activities. In keeping with the U.S. Army's policy to seek community involvement in the investigation processes, the U.S. Army is seeking input from the community to determine if there is sufficient community interest in establishing a RAB for the Keystone Rifle Range MRS. If there is sufficient interest in establishing a RAB, one will be established. Typically sufficient interest is indicated by 50 or more individuals who are interested and/or available to be involved in RAB activities. For more information about RABs, please access the following website: http://www.denix.osd.mil/rab/upload/RAB-Rule-Handbook_Final.pdf If you are interested in establishing a RAB for the Keystone Rifle Range MRS, please contact Patrick Shaw, Army National Guard, at (703) 607-7199 or e-mail to: patrick.p.shaw2.civ@mail.mil Publication Date: October 13, 2015 The Union Democrat, Sonora, CA 95370", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T10:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T02:37:14.473+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
