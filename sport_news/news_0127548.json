Two documentaries recently screened in Brazil on 2015, argue that hosting the World Cup was detrimental to the South American powerhouse. Taxpayers, the films show, ended up stuck with the bill for stadiums that cost several times their initial estimates. Some were built in cities such as the remote agricultural capital of Cuiaba, which does not have a first-division soccer team. (AP Photo/Felipe Dana, File) \nÂ© 2015 Cox Media Group .
