Since leading the Horned Frogs 35-17 at halftime, the Wildcats have mustered just 19 points in their last 10 quarters.\nQuarterback Joe Hubener, making his sixth start of the season, threw for just 97 yards with one touchdown and an interception, while adding 18 yards rushing.\nHubener held his own in Kansas State’s first three games of the season, leading the team to a 3-0 record, but has looked overmatched in the team’s four consecutive losses. With Kansas State needing three more wins to become bowl eligible, Snyder may look to backup quarterbacks Jesse Ertz, Alex Delton or Jonathan Banks to take the reins of the low scoring offense.\nThe Wildcats were actually very productive on the ground against the Longhorns with leading rusher Charles Jones running for 122 yards on 18 carries, compiling one his most productive games on the season.\nThe K-State defense held their own as well, keeping versatile Texas quarterback Jerrod Heard to 160 total yards. Heard entered the game leading the Longhorns in both passing and rushing yards, but was unable to get anything going against a stout Kansas State defense.\nThe Wildcat defense was essentially beaten by one player, Longhorn backup quarterback Tyrone Swoopes. Swoopes scored all three touchdowns for Texas while rushing for 50 yards on seven carries.\nThe Wildcats will need to rebound quickly if they’re going to make a run at a bowl game in 2015. Needing three more wins to become bowl eligible, Kansas State will have to find a way to win the majority of their five remaining in-conference battles. That slate will begin the first week of November against the Baylor Bears, as the Wildcats will have time to consider all their options during their upcoming bye week.\nCopyright 2015 KCTV (Meredith Corp.) and FootballKC.
