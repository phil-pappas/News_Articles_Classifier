Mercy. #NOvsPHI http://t.co/SDoVwTRScY â€” NFL (@NFL) October 11, 2015 \nPHILADELPHIA -- Eagles wide receiver Josh Huff made sure that his first receiving touchdown was a memorable one. \nThe second-year receiver hauled in a 41-yard Sam Bradford touchdown pass in the second quarter of Sunday's game against the New Orleans Saints at Lincoln Financial Field and capped the catch and run with a front-flip into the end zone, knotting the game up at 7-7. \nYou can watch video of the touchdown above. \nMatt Lombardo may be reached at MDLombardo@yahoo.com .
