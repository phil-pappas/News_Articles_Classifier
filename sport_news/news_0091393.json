The top-seeded pair eased past the Romanian team of Irina-Camelia Begu and Monica Niculescu 6-2, 6-3 in the title clash. \"Title number 7 #SanTina @mhingis #WuhanOpen,\" the Indian star tweeted accompanied by a picture of the duo with the trophy. Sania and Hingis had it relatively easy in the second round, quarterfinals and semi-finals after getting a first round bye in the tournament. Sania and Hingis dropped serve three times and fought back from a 2-0 deficit in the second set to emerge triumphant in the summit clash today. With today's win, the Indo-Swiss pairing has seven WTA doubles titles together this year -- Indian Wells, Miami, Charleston, Wimbledon, the US Open, Guangzhou and Wuhan. They have won their last three tournaments and their last 13 matches without dropping a single set. They now head to the China Open in Beijing, where they have been given the top billing.
