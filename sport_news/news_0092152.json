THE CANADIAN PRESS/ AP/Nam Y. Huh \nCHICAGO - Blackhawks star Duncan Keith had right knee surgery on Tuesday, sidelining the top defenceman for the Stanley Cup champions for four to six weeks. \nKeith, a two-time Norris Trophy winner, has two assists in six games this season. The team said he had a meniscal tear repaired. \n\"I don't think it was a defining blow, but it was bothering him,\" coach Joel Quenneville said. \nThe loss of Keith, who won the Conn Smythe Trophy last season for playoffs MVP, is a huge blow for the Stanley Cup champions. They play in one of the NHL's toughest divisions, and every point could make a difference at the end of the year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T05:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T08:54:09.571+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
