The post of president fell vacant after death of incumbent Jagmohan Dalmiya, and Manohar is all set to be re-elected as the president of the cricket board in Sunday’s meeting . “A lot of important people have led BCCI in the past and Manohar has also done it quite well. I am sure he will do a good job,” Ganguly, who has been named to succeed Dalmiya as Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) president, told reporters here on Saturday. “As you know, Jagmohan Dalmiya’s demise has brought unexpected circumstances for all of us, so we did things which were in the best interests for everyone,” he said. On his new role as CAB president, Ganguly said: “I have been the secretary in CAB for 12-13 months… I have never expected this to happen. Neither did I want to be the president in these circumstances. Dalmiya was not only the CAB president to me, I grew up in front of him.” BCCI secretary Anurag Thakur said all the six associations from the east zone nominated Manohar for the president’s post and no other nomination was received. “I congratulate Manohar. We will all wait for the formal meeting to happen. It will be one agenda for the meeting,” he said. Thakur said he is sure Manohar will take over for the good of the board. “After the demise of Dalmiya, it was very important to continue the reforms which had taken place in BCCI in the last six months. We have seen the previous tenure of Manohar where his work has been appreciated by all and we believe under his leadership, the BCCI will continue the reforms that has been taken place. I personally feel the experience he has as an administrator, it is going to benefit the BCCI,” he said.
