Yes No View results Six games into this season, the Birds are still in too much of a state of flux to look beyond what they just did and what is directly in front of them.\nDoing more than that keeps you from enjoying the fact that the Eagles crushed the rival New York Giants, 27-7, on Monday to win three out of their last four, even their record at 3-3 and take over first place in the NFC East.\nThe Eagles play at the Carolina Panthers on Sunday. It is a chance to go above .500 for the first time this season and knock off one of the five remaining unbeaten teams.\nBeyond that, however, follow the lead of Eagles coach Chip Kelly.\n\"We take it on a weekly basis,\" Kelly said at his news conference on Tuesday. \"So it's just what do we do now to prepare for Carolina.\n\"I don't look at things globally at this point in time. Once you get into the season, on each week it is really it's own individual season.\"\nThe Eagles cannot look at things \"globally.\"\nThat kind of vision is reserved for legitimate Super Bowl contenders like the New England Patriots, Green Bay Packers and Denver Broncos.\nThose type of teams have the pedigrees to look at where they are now and then extrapolate to where they can go, but it is based on an established pattern of consistency.\nThe Eagles have yet to display any complete level of consistency.\nFor each upswing, such as the continually improved play of the defense, there is an opposite concern, such as the erratic play of quarterback Sam Bradford.\nWhether it is fair or not, so much of this uncertainty is because of Bradford.\nWhen the Eagles traded for Bradford, the primary concern was whether he could stay healthy after missing consecutive seasons because of knee injuries.\nIronically, that is the least worry at this point.\nAfter Bradford threw three interceptions against the Giants to bring his season total to nine, the question is not whether he can stay healthy but, rather, whether he can play at a level required to take the Eagles anywhere beyond contending in a bad division.\nIt is difficult to look at the Eagles anywhere down the road because there has not been much evidence that Bradford is much more than he has shown - which isn't going to be good enough.\n\"I mean, it's drill work and I think, obviously, a lot of situations we do in the training, like everybody, are controlled situations,\" Kelly said when asked if Bradford can be coached up into playing better. \"When it comes to the game, it's an uncontrolled situation. So we need to simulate it as best we can.\n\"But you also can't go, you know, live, full-go and have a rush come after him and try to hit him in practice. I think that's the one difficulty with it, with any coach, when you're trying to simulate things in a practice situation that are applicable to the games.\"\nIn other words, no.\nThe only solution to the Eagles quarterback issue is that Bradford figures it out, if he is capable of that.\nKelly made it clear that change is not on his agenda right now.\n\"We are not waiting out anything,\" Kelly said when asked if winning gives Bradford time to figure things out. \"I don't know what the waiting out is. Sam is our quarterback, so we have full confidence in Sam.\"\nAll Eagle fans can cling to is the hope Bradford is still shaking off the rust from not having played competitive NFL football for so long and that he will improve and gain consistency as he plays more games.\nThe alternative is to believe that a full training camp and six regular season games should be enough time for Bradford to have regained form.\nBesides an upset stomach, what does that line of thinking get you?\nHowever, the Bradford issue is no different from the other issues.\nIs the offensive line finally finding some cohesion? Has running back DeMarco Murray finally found a comfort zone in the Eagles' offense? Can the defense continue to hold games together while the offense tries to get its act together?\nWe do not know those answers, and we still will not know them after the Carolina game.\n\"Really each week is its own individual week,\" Kelly said. \"I say the same thing after every game, 'One down, one to go,' and that's how we look at it.\"\nIf you want to get any enjoyment out of the Eagles right now, that is the only way you can look at things.", "external_links": ["http://polls.clickability.com/polls", "http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&mi=11081&pw=159355&ctc=TrainingCamp&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.fanatics.com%2FNFL_Philadelphia_Eagles_NFL_Training_Camp"], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T00:14:30.786+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
