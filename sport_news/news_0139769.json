With a loss to Hayden already on the ledger, the Indians (4-1) hold their title destiny in their own hands. \n“Our kids are aware of that, but they’re not necessarily worried about it,” Manhattan coach Joe Schartz said. “They’re just worried about executing and doing their job.” \nTheir job this week is a big one. Then again, any time it’s Manhattan-Junction City, it’s a big one. \nThat’s the nature of a rivalry as intense as it’s been between the Indians and the Blue Jays, who enter Friday’s contest in Manhattan with a 5-0 record. In the last six meetings between the schools, no game has been decided by more than nine points and three were by six or less. \n“It’s Manhattan week and there’s so much extra excitement for this week,” Junction City coach Randall Zimmerman said. “There’s not a lot we really have to tell the kids to get them going for this one.” \nIf Zimmerman needed any more motivation, he’s got it. A win over their arch rivals would assure the Blue Jays of an undefeated league season and nothing worse than a share of the league title. \nOnly Topeka High would be capable of also finishing league play unbeaten. \nJunction City cleared a big hurdle last week, knocking off previously unbeaten Washburn Rural 36-13. The Blue Jays trailed 13-8 at halftime, giving up points in the first half for the first time all season. \nBut with the defense pitching a second-half shutout, Junction City stormed back with 28 unanswered points in the second half to pull away for the victory. \n“We hope we benefit from that down the road and I believe we will,” Zimmerman said. “All we talked about at halftime was that was the first time we’d been hit with adversity to that level, down and not playing well at all against a really, really good Washburn Rural team. We said it was going to be a test of our character and would we scratch and claw and get it done or say, ‘Hey, we’ll wait until Manhattan week.’ Our kids came out and played a nice second half and we got the win.” \nThe test was the only one the Blue Jays have had in their 5-0 start as they’ve outscored their foes 247-41 on the season, opening the year with blowouts against Highland Park (56-14), Emporia (51-14), Shawnee Heights (64-0) and Seaman (40-0). \nLikewise, Manhattan has had only one true test through its first five games, a 21-14 loss to Hayden in a game the Indians led 14-0 at one point. In its other four games, Manhattan has allowed just 28 points with 21 of those coming in the second half against Seaman after building a 42-0 halftime lead in a 49-21 win. \nSchartz said the early slate, as well as the loss to Hayden, have been beneficial to his team. \n“It’s given us a chance to know one another especially with our quarterback being new to the system,” Schartz said, referring to junior quarterback Ian Trapp, a transfer from Ellsworth. “ But we’ve been referring to the Hayden game quite a bit. That was a quality opponent where when we needed to make a play we failed to execute. Hopefully since that time we’ve improved enough that when we get in a competitive situation that we’ll be in Friday night, we’ll be able to execute.” \nTrapp has been an impact player for the Indians, rushing for 751 yards and 12 touchdowns and throwing for 505 yards and six scores. \nJunction City has also relied heavily on a newcomer to its offense, though not new to the program. A starter at safety since his freshman year, Raye Wilson was moved to tailback this year and has responded with a huge season, rushing for 811 yards and 11 touchdowns in the first five games. \n“We’ve felt for a while that Raye has tremendous vision and we’d be silly if we didn’t talk him into moving over to the offensive side and putting the ball in his hands every offensive play we could,” Zimmerman said. “It took a little convincing, but he’s really liked it and has really taken off with it.” \nBrent Maycock can be reached at (785) 295-5662 or brent.maycock@cjonline.com .Follow Brent on Twitter @CockyHawk91 .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T22:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T03:58:23.742+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
