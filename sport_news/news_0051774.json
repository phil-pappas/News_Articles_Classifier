(Cliff Hawkins / Getty Images) Associated Press \nSmylie Kaufman won the Shriners Hospitals for Children Open on Sunday in his fifth PGA Tour start, shooting a 10-under-par 61 and waiting more than two hours while rival after rival fell short. \nKaufman played the final 11 holes in nine under with an eagle and seven birdies. He set up the eagle with a three-wood drive to 15 feet on the par-four 15th and closed with a 20-foot birdie putt on the par-four 18th to post 16-under 268 at TPC Summerlin. \nKevin Na, third-round leader Brett Stegmaier, Patton Kizzire, Cameron Tringale, Jason Bohn and Alex Cejka tied for second, a stroke back. \nNa, coming off playoff loss last week to Emiliano Grillo in the season-opening event in Napa, California, made a 25-foot birdie putt on the par-five 16th to tie for the lead, but bogeyed the par-three 17th after flubbing a chip, and missed a 15-foot birdie try on 18. \nStegmaier had the last chance to force a playoff, but hit his approach on 18 into the left fringe and came up short on a 20-foot birdie try. \nKaufman became the second straight rookie winner on the tour, earning $1,152,000 and a spot in the Masters. The 23-year-old former LSU player from Birmingham, Alabama, began the year with no tour status, won a Web.com Tour event in May and earned a PGA Tour card with a high finish on the money list. \nNa, the 2011 Las Vegas winner for his lone PGA Tour title, finished with a 67. Stegmaier shot 69, Kizzire 63, and Tringale, Bohn and Cejka 66. \nWilliam McGirt and Chad Campbell tied for eighth at 14 under. McGirt had a 62, going nine under in a nine-hole stretch that ended with an eagle on the par-five 16th. Campbell had a 68. \nRickie Fowler finished with a 68 to tie for 25th at nine under. Jimmy Walker, playing alongside Na in the second-to-last group, had a 78 to fall into a tie for 50th at four under. \nKo back to No. 1 with victory in Taiwan \nLydia Ko ran away with the LPGA Taiwan Championship in Taipei to regain the No. 1 spot in the world ranking. \nThe 18-year-old New Zealander holed a 30-yard pitch for eagle on the par-five 12th and finished with a seven-under 65 in sunny, breezy conditions at Miramar for a nine-stroke victory. \nKo took the top spot in the world from South Korea's Inbee Park with her fifth LPGA Tour victory of the season and the 10th of her career. Park skipped her title defense at Miramar to play in a Korea LPGA event, where she tied for second Sunday. \nAt 18 years 6 months and 1 day, Ko is the youngest player to win 10 events on any major tour. Horton Smith set the PGA Tour mark of 21 years 7 months in 1929, and Nancy Lopez set the previous LPGA Tour record in 1979 at 22 years 2 months 5 days. \nKo broke ties with Park for the tour victory lead and the No. 1 spot in the player of the year points race, and earned $300,000 to increase her tour-leading total to $2,716,753. \nThe South Korean-born Ko finished at 20-under 268 after opening with rounds of 69, 67 and 67 to take a four-stroke lead into the final day. South Koreans So Yeon Ryu and Ji Eun-hee tied for second. \nKo has three victories in her last five starts. She won in Canada and France — where she became the youngest major champion — in consecutive starts, tied for second two weeks ago in Malaysia and tied for fourth last week in South Korea. \nRose wins the Hong Kong Open \nEngland's Justin Rose won the Hong Kong Open, cllsing with a two-under 68 for a one-stroke victory over Denmark's Lucas Bjerregaard. \nRose finished at 17-under 263 for his eighth European Tour title. The 2013 U.S. Open champion opened with round of 65, 66 and 64. Bjerregaard closed with a 69.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T03:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T15:09:07.201+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
