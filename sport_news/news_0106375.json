He is part of our rebuilding process and I did not see signs of misunderstanding or issues working with a great player like Emenike.\" \nOliseh rubbished the reports about axing Emenike for the upcoming World Cup qualifier against Swaziland, saying it was all fabricated. \n\"It's a figment of someone's imagination because it did not come from me,\" the 1998 World Cup star (below, pictured) stressed. \n\"I've not spoken to any journalist about my squad or the World Cup game that will only take place in November. \n\"My coaches and I have been fully focused on the CHAN qualifier (against Burkina Faso), so I don't know where they got that [plans to axe Emenike] information from.\" \nNFF in the dark \nMeanwhile the Nigeria Football Federation has also said that it has not received any official correspondence from the player about his retirement. \n\"The NFF has yet to receive any official notification of retirement from Emenike. He didn\\'t inform us about his decision before going to the social media to announce it,\" NFF spokesman Ademola Olajire told The Punch. \nEmenike is the second top player to retire from the Super Eagles this month, following the decision by former skipper and first choice goalkeeper Vincent Enyeama to hang his international gloves after a public spat with Oliseh. \nWill be missed \nFormer Super Eagles midfield star Friday Ekpo believes the player, who won 37 caps and scored nine goals in his five-year international career, will be missed as the team is being rebuilt and the younger players would have benefitted from his experience. \n\"Emenike's retirement is coming at the wrong time. Since he has expressed it and he has given us reasons for doing so, I wish him the best of luck in his endeavors,\" Ekpo said. \n\"The Eagles will miss his experience. The team we have now is made up of new players who will need to learn from an experienced player like Emenike. When senior players leave a team, the younger ones find it difficult to learn. This may later affect the team.\" \n- \nFollow Joy Sports on Twitter: @Joy997FM.
