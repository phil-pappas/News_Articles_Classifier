I'm proud of the way that we played,\" said BUHS co-coach Kelly Markol, whose team is now 2-7-2 overall. \nAfter 60 minutes of regulation time, the teams went 7-on-7 during a 10-minute overtime period. Markol and Sherryl Libardoni sent Laura Freeman, Hannah Wilson, Hannah Blake, Kharisma Boyd, Kalin Noble, Marly Lynch and Weeks out on the field, and used Kylee Shatrau and Olivia Reil as subs. \nThe Colonels had the best three chances in OT. 1)Blake stole the ball in her own end, took the ball the other way and dished to Boyd, who was denied by Parker. 2)Reil passed ahead to Boyd, but she was robbed when going one-on-one with the Cosmos netminder. 3)Lynch made a fine centering pass during a corner, however nobody was there to tap the ball in. \n\"We do a lot of 7-on-7 in practice but with a young team, we try to stick to the basics,\" noted BUHS co-coach Sherryl Libardoni. \nWeeks made a highlight reel save in the first half to keep Springfield off the board. Emilia Battista stole the ball just outside the circle and dribbled past two defenders, but was unable to fool the Brattleboro goalie. Advertisement \nThe Colonels got timely clears from Wilson, Lynch and Freeman, as the only other scare was Madeline Macie's shot that glanced off the near post. At the other end, Parker stopped shots from Brattleboro's Kayla Leonard-Houle, Kyleigh Peterson, Boyd and Lynch. \nThe two goalies were magnificent in the second half as well. Weeks kicked away Ericka Schoff's blast on a corner play, and Parker turned back attempts by Shatrau, Noble and Boyd. \nAnd then came 10 exciting minutes of overtime, although nothing was settled, in front of a large crowd. \nThis was the second time this season that the two teams have finished in a tie. Their Sept. 17 matchup ended up 2-2. \nThursday was Senior Night and the Colonels honored 12th graders Laura Freeman and Hannah Wilson. \n\"Those two seniors have done an unbelievable job this year. They are positive, they are true leaders, and they really brought this team together. They work hard. They lead by example. They are really two great kids. They are model student-athletes,\" the two BUHS coaches agreed. \"They are the type of people you want to be your captains, kids, or friends.\" \nThe Cosmos are now 4-5-2 overall. The 2-7-2 Colonels will play at Bellows Falls on Monday.
