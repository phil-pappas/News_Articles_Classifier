Marchand is wearing a green, non-contact jersey, but just the fact that he's okay to skate means his concussion is probably of the very minor variety. Generally, players with such injuries are held out of action for only about a week.\nThe Bruis fly this afternoon to Denver, where they face the Colorado Avalanche tomorrow night. The Avs are 1-1-0, but have already scored 10 goals. The B's then face the Phoenix Coyotes in Glendale Saturday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T17:48:58.588+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
