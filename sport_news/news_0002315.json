Credit Rick Bowmer/Associated Press \nAdvertisement No. 3 Utah at Southern California 7:30 p.m. Eastern, Fox The most intriguing game of a sleepy week of college football features third ranked Utah traveling to the Colosseum to take on a 3-3 U.S.C. team. The Trojans might be the most talented .500 team in college football, however, and despite Utah’s lofty ranking, it is a 3.5-point underdog. To add to the intrigue, Utah Coach Kyle Whittingham is among the names being mentioned for the U.S.C. job . Utah has been getting it done with defense . The Utes are tough upfront against the run and have 13 interceptions on the season. Keep an eye on Utah running back Devontae Booker, a bruising runner who has carried the offensive load . For U.S.C., this game is the last chance to save the season. Cornerback Adoree Jackson is one of the most exciting players in college football and will see more time at wide receiver this week . No. 15 Texas A&M at No. 24 Mississippi 7 p.m., ESPN The only matchup between ranked teams this week also features two teams coming off losses. The Aggies were blown out by Alabama, while Mississippi lost to undefeated Memphis. The winner of this one stays alive in the SEC West, while the loser is basically eliminated. The Rebels’ star left tackle, Laremy Tunsil will return after serving a seven-game suspension, and his matchup with Aggie defensive end Myles Garrett might be the most compelling of the weekend . Washington at No. 10 Stanford 10:30 p.m., ESPN Stanford’s offense has clicked, and the team is suddenly among the hottest in the game. The offensive line has been tremendous, and running back Christian McCaffrey has been unstoppable over his last four games. Last week he racked up 369 all-purpose yards and four touchdowns in a victory over U.C.L.A. He leads the nation in all-purpose yards and is making the case to be included in the Heisman discussion. The Cardinal offense will be put the test against a Washington defense that’s allowing just 16.8 points a game, fewest in the conference. No. 6 Clemson at Miami Noon, ABC This one has all the signs of a trap game for Clemson. It is the first real test on the road for the Tigers this season. Their only other trip away from Death Valley resulted in a narrow victory over a Louisville team that is now 2-4. Clemson is in the thick of the playoff hunt, but everyone seems to be waiting for them to slip up . Miami has done a great job forcing turnovers on defense and taking care of the ball on offense. This game features two great quarterbacks, Clemson’s Deshaun Watson and Miami’s Brad Kaaya. No. 25 Pittsburgh at Syracuse Noon, ESPNU In his first season as coach, Pat Narduzzi (the former Michigan State defensive coordinator) has the Panthers at 5-1 and in the top 25 for the first time in 5 years. Their one loss came on the road to an undefeated Iowa team, which needed a 57-yard field goal as time expired for the win. No. 1 Ohio State at Rutgers 8 p.m., ABC How many 7-0 teams change their starting quarterbacks? That’s exactly what Ohio State has done, with Cardale Jones being replaced by J.T. Barrett . The speedy Barrett has looked great lately and has been getting the Buckeyes into the end zone, which was something they were struggling to do. No. 21 Houston at Central Florida Noon, ESPN News The Cougars are undefeated, and quarterback Greg Ward Jr. is among the best playmakers in college football. His 14 rushing touchdowns are tied with Leonard Fournette for most in the F.B.S. Winless Central Florida is unlikely to pose much of a threat. Tennessee at No. 8 Alabama 3:30 p.m., CBS The Tide are rolling, having beaten two top-10 teams on the road over their last three games. Since a loss to Mississippi, the Tide defense has been lights out, and the team is playing as well as anyone in the country.
