(Nathan Denette/The Canadian Press via AP) MANDATORY CREDIT Sponsored Links By The Associated Press The Associated Press \nThe latest on the League Championship Series. The Blue Jays and Royals play Game 2 in Kansas City with a first pitch set for 4:07 p.m. The Cubs and Mets play the opener of the NL best-of-seven at 8:07 p.m. Here's a look at what's happening (all times EDT) : \n___ \n2:40 p.m. \nRoyals starter Yordano Ventura will have the familiar figure of Salvador Perez behind home plate against the Blue Jays in Game 2 of the ALCS. \nPerez was ill for part of the divisional round, then took a bat off the back of his glove hand in the ALCS opener. Royals trainer Nick Kenney checked on Perez during that game, but the affable catcher decided to remain in the rest of the way. \nStill, there was some question whether Drew Butera might get the start Saturday. \n\"The toughest guy I ever saw was Jason Kendall and Sal is right there with him,\" Royals manager Ned Yost said of the longtime big league catcher. \"It's just amazing the beating that he can take and rebound every day, being in that lineup.\" \nPerez, a three-time All-Star and two-time Gold Glove winner, hit his third homer of the postseason in the Royals 5-0 win on Friday night. \n___ \n2:15 p.m. \nToronto manager John Gibbons said Edwin Encarnacion is back in Toronto's lineup for Game 2 of the ALCS, determined to \"deal with the pain.\" \nBatting fourth as the DH, Encarnacion was removed in the eighth inning of Kansas City's 5-0 win on Friday night when his left middle finger swelled up again. Gibbons said Encarnacion underwent an MRI before deciding to play on Saturday. \n\"A normal game, he wouldn't be in there,\" Gibbons said. \"But we need him, so he's in there. He'll battle through it.\" \nEncarnacion, who hit 39 home runs and had 111 RBIs for the East Division champs, has struggled with the finger much of the year, missing games in August and September. Justin Smoak pinch hit in the eighth inning and popped up with two runners on base. \n\"Edwin's a big part of our team,\" said Toronto outfielder Kevin Pillar. \"Any time he's in the lineup we're a better team. It's something he's dealt with throughout the year. He probably wouldn't be playing if it wasn't a postseason game. But Edwin is truly passionate and wants to win and he's going to do whatever it takes to get ready to play today.\" \n___ \n10:45 a.m. \nThe Chicago Cubs have added speedy outfielder Quintin Berry to their roster for the NL Championship Series against the New York Mets. \nBerry replaces rookie shortstop Addison Russell, who strained his left hamstring during Game 3 of the NL Division Series against St. Louis. \nBerry is 27 for 28 in stolen-base attempts during his big league career. He was on the roster for the wild-card game win at Pittsburgh, then was replaced by pitcher Jason Hammel for the Division Series. \nNew York also made one change Saturday, adding left-hander Sean Gilmartin in place of right-hander Erik Goeddel, who allowed three singles and a home run without getting an out in Game 3 of the Division Series against Los Angeles.
