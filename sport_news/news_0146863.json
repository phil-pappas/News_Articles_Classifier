For those of you curious about the console patch for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, it is 2 to 3 weeks away . The fixes below are PC specific. The team is aware of the dropped commentary during gameplay and will look into fixing it on the next patch. Added support for 21:9 UltraWide monitors, multiple monitor displays, and other non-16:9 aspect ratios. Fixed an issue where frame rate could stutter (even on higher end graphics cards) in either or both of gameplay and MyPARK. Fixed a bug where playcalling icons were not appearing for some users. Resolved a driver crash on below min spec DirectX 10.0 cards, such as the NVidia 9800 GT. Optimized crowd rendering, resulting in slightly improved performance on many configurations. Fixed black rectangle artifact. # 1 23 @ 10/09/15 01:19 PM Well it didn't stop the stuttering and temp. slow down and/or no commentary audio momentarily. I just don't get how this game has been like this for 2 years in a row now. # 2 balldoktor81 @ 10/09/15 01:23 PM i still can't see my players icons when i'm on offense while pressing right trigger (my setup) i would like to know who i'm passing to... it's easy to miss the right target if you constantly mix up the 2 and 3 position!!! please fix this! anybody else with the same problem??? play-calling is working fine, icons are there BUT above mentioned \"bug\" is driving me crazy sometimes... # 3 23 @ 10/09/15 01:26 PM I also don't understand why Nvidia is always only mentioned when plenty of people use AMD as well. It's AMD card's that are used in the consoles if im not mistaken as well so is this largely due to the fact that Nvidia users have more issues? Game looks great but this stuttering issue makes you hate it. # 4 Leftos @ 10/09/15 01:34 PM 23, can you please post your DxDiag in the other thread I just created? If you could record video of the issue you're having that would be very useful too. # 5 harryl @ 10/09/15 03:10 PM After this patch, I now have a new problem: after MyTeam games, I no longer get my MT Points Recap screen. I just get the Player of the Game video and then the game goes to the post-game menus. In 2K15, I had the same sort of problem, but the \"fix\" was to make sure that my controller (XBox 360 Wireless) was on and connected before game launch and/or launching from within Steam Big Picture mode (I forget if latter was necessary or just former). # 6 23 @ 10/09/15 03:10 PM Quote: Originally Posted by Leftos 23, can you please post your DxDiag in the other thread I just created?
