Obviously your routines change a little bit ... but as far as being prepared, being ready for it, I'll be fine come tomorrow.\"\nKershaw, who had another great campaign in 2015 with a 16-7 record, 2.13 ERA and 301 strikeouts, was the losing pitcher in Friday's opening 3-1 loss in the best-of-five that was tied 1-1 heading into Monday's contest.\nDespite his unquestioned regular season brilliance, Kershaw has suffered bitter playoff disappointments the past two years.\nIn 2013, Kershaw gave up seven runs in four innings in a 9-0 elimination loss to the St. Louis Cardinals in Game Six of the 2013 NL Championship Series.\nLast year the Cardinals were again his postseason nemesis as the Dodgers were ousted 3-1 in the NL Division Series. St. Louis erupted for eight runs in the seventh inning to stun Los Angeles and Kershaw in a 10-9 Game One shocker.\nPitching on short rest in Game Four against the Cards, Kershaw was initially dominant but again would take the loss after giving up a three-run homer in the seventh inning.\n\"Last year I did OK until the last inning,\" Kershaw said about his last outing on three days rest. \"(I'll) try not to do that again, I guess.\"\n(Editing by Andrew Both)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T02:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T02:39:43.980+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
