It protects a nearly 14-mile wide caldera – the collapsed remains of an ancient volcano – known for its scenic beauty and wildlife, and as a place for recreation.\nThe landscape includes subalpine forests, grasslands, geologic formations, streams and hot springs. It is one of just three supervolcanos located in the United States, and the area is considered sacred land by local tribes.\nThe federal government purchased the property in 2000 with the goal of operating it as a working ranch while developing recreational opportunities for the public.\nJEWELL: Highlighted the value of the preserve to Native tribes (Marla Brose/Albuquerque Journal)\nThe acquisition was made using $101 million from the Land and Water Conservation Fund. At the time, it represented the largest land acquisition in New Mexico’s history in terms of its size and cost.\n“Valles Caldera is a perfect example of the key role the Land and Water Conservation Fund has played in enhancing public lands, from city parks to national parks, over the last 50 years,” Jewell said.\nLegislation signed last year cleared the way for the property to transition from trust management to the Park Service. The NPS officially assumed full-time management of the preserve on Oct. 1.\nThe secretary called on Congress to permanently earmark more funding and resources so other local communities can invest in conservation and historic preservation.\nShe also highlighted the value of the preserve to many native tribes. The Interior Department is committed to being stewards of the preserve and supporting the values held by the tribes, Jewell said.\nOfficials say public access is expected to increase with the change to the preserve’s status.\nJournal staff writer T.S.
