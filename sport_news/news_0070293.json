No. 1 Ohio State struggles then shakes off Maryland 49-28 1  /  5 Back to Gallery COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) — Cardale Jones threw two touchdown passes, J.T. Barrett scored three times and No. 1 Ohio State remained unbeaten — and mostly underwhelming — with a 49-28 win over Maryland on Saturday.\nEzekiel Elliott had two touchdowns for the Buckeyes (6-0, 2-0 Big Ten), who were tied 21-21 in the third quarter before shaking free of the Terrapins (2-4, 0-2) and extending the nation's longest winning streak to 19.\nOhio State has won 26 straight regular-season conference games, but again struggled against a huge underdog.\nOhio State coach Urban Meyer juggled his quarterbacks, using Jones to start drives and Barrett to finish them. Jones threw a 19-yard TD pass to Braxton Miller and connected on a 48-yarder to Jalin Marshall .\nOutscored 73-6 the past two weeks, the Terrapins put up a fight amid speculation about coach Randy Edsall 's future.\nMaryland quarterback Perry Hills ran for 170 yards and two TDs.\n___\nAP college football website: collegefootball.ap.org", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T18:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T22:56:59.242+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
