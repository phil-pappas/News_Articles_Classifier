The center said that a panel on marijuana legalization is back by popular demand.\n\"It's the No. 1 problem in schools right now,\" said Lynn Riemer, president of ACT on Drugs, a nonprofit drug awareness and education organization.\nAssistant Attorney General Michael Song gave the marijuana presentation, telling teachers and school faculty about the shifting attitudes young people have toward marijuana and the ways in which authorities can address this new frontier.\nAdvertisement Jeff Whitmore, director of transportation for Bayfield School District in southwestern Colorado, shook his head in disbelief after the more than hour-long presentation that covered edibles, cannabis paraphernalia and the laws behind busting students for possessing the drug on school campuses.\n\"At first, I thought it was similar to alcohol and that the kids would do it anyway and all that,\" Whitmore said. \"But it's like they're disguising alcohol as Kool-Aid and marketing it to kids. These edibles are cookies and gummy bears, and they're filled with high amounts of THC.\"\nDuring the presentation, teachers took notes about the packaging of various marijuana edibles in the hopes of spotting the substances more easily. They also shared frustrations of complacent parents smoking with their children.\n\"There's a shift in culture,\" Whitmore said. \"Kids see their parents smoking it and see it marketed everywhere, and they think it's normal and OK for them to do.\"\nWhile data on marijuana-related incidents in Colorado public schools remains contested and scarce , many educators said they are seeing the problem escalate.\nGet news alerts in your inbox Sign up for updates and a curated roundup of news delivered to your inbox every morning.\n\"This is not a concern simply because it's new,\" Harms said. \"This really is an issue, and we need to educate our parents about it so they can be vigilant.\"\nElizabeth Hernandez: 303-954-1223, ehernandez@denverpost.com or twitter.com/ehernandez", "external_links": ["http://denverpostplus.com/app/mailer-rules/www/", "https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Andada|Montserrat:400,700|Open+Sans:400,800,700,400italic"], "published": "2015-10-14T13:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T14:12:11.061+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
