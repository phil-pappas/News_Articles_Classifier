And they are hopeful for attention to transportation and infrastructure.” \nMost people pointed to either investing in education and training or improving the state’s infrastructure — each with 23 percent — as the best way to improve the state’s job climate. Only 15 percent pointed to cutting or limiting taxes and regulations. \nThe survey shows that support for improving the state’s infrastructure, especially transportation, increased from 17 percent in 2014 to 23 percent this year, while support for cutting or limiting taxes and regulations dropped from 21 percent in 2014 to 15 percent in 2015. \n“Along with population growth comes more congestion and longer commutes — which is at least a partial explanation for growing support for infrastructure improvements,’’ she said. \nAmong other topics: Relations with Cuba \nMore than half, 56 percent, of those surveyed favor freeing up diplomatic relations with Cuba while 26 percent oppose it and 18 percent have no opinion. \nMacManus noted that Cuba was getting much attention when the pollsters were in the field. President Barack Obama announced on July 1 that the U.S. and Cuba would re-establish diplomatic relations, and it became effective on July 30. Media coverage generally reported that supporters saw economic benefits to Floridians from the change, while opponents saw economic gains as largely accruing to the repressive regime in Cuba. \nThe report found that support for opening relations with Cuba was highest for men, (63 percent,) people under age 65, (58 percent), households with an income of $75,000 or greater (63 percent) and people who have lived in Florida 20 or more years, (57 percent.) \nRegional differences were also reflected with residents of the I-4 corridor and the Miami to Palm Beach region — both areas with large concentrations of Hispanics — more likely than the state average to support normalizing relations. Residents of the North and Southwest regions are less likely than the state average to support normalization. Casino gambling \nThe poll also found that 67 percent of those polled support casino gambling but people are divided over where to locate it. One third, 34 percent, favor expansion to Nevada-style casinos, 33 percent want it restricted to Seminole Tribe facilities, and 20 percent want no gambling at all. \nRegional differences mattered as well. Residents of Miami to Palm Beach are slightly more likely than the state average — 37 percent to 34 percent — to support Nevada-style casinos. \nOpposition to any casino gambling at all increases with age, and is highest among residents of North Florida, who oppose it by 32 percent. Job incentives \nWhen it comes to economic development, the results also show there is little agreement throughout the state about the best approach to economic development. \nDespite Gov. Rick Scott’s travel across the nation to bring outside jobs to Florida, the survey found that for the first time since 2008, more Floridians — 45 percent — prefer the governor focus on maintaining existing businesses and jobs while 43 percent say the state should focus on attracting new businesses and jobs to the state. \nThe majority rate their taxes at the state and local level to be about right relative to the quality of services received but spending levels are perceived as wasteful, not efficient. \n“The reason why so many people regard government as wasteful at the moment is tied to the fact that so many people feel stress in their household finances,’’ MacManus said. “It’s long been a pattern in government finance … if people are having to make tough choices, any discussion of taxes and services by government is regarded as very wasteful.” Uber regulations \nThe survey also asked people what they thought of regulating ride-sharing companies such as Uber and Lyft, and the results showed that 89 percent believe such companies should carry liability insurance and 56 percent believe their prices should be regulated. \nContact Mary Ellen Klas at meklas@miamiherald.com .
