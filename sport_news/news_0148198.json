Speaking to the media afterwards, Harvick said he really didn't feel there was any pressure going into the race weekend. \nWe also heard from his crew chief, Rodney Childers, second place finisher Kyle Busch and Dale Earnhardt, Jr., who finished in third. \nAfter a short rain delay in Saturday's NASCAR Xfinity Series race at Dover International Speedway, Regan Smith powered from fourth to first place on the lap 121 restart, and led the rest of the way to score his second series victory of the season. \nIt is the sixth career victory for Smith, with all of those wins coming with JR Motorsports. \nSmith talked about the key moment in the race afterwards to the media. We also heard from second place finisher Denny Hamlin and third place Kyle Busch. \nThe NASCAR Sprint Cup Series and Xfinity Series both travel to the Queen City this weekend, as Charlotte Motor Speedway hosts both tours.
