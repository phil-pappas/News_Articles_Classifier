Unlike the first version held at City Hall, this one revolved solely around environmental issues. \nThe questions focused on a small number of topics, including the “Green Necklace” proposed to surround the Central Issaquah Plan area and conservation of forested hillsides around the city. \nThe Central Issaquah Plan describes the Green Necklace partly as a “lush urban garden benefitting Central Issaquah” through parks, corridor open spaces, tree-lined streets and so on. The green areas are all to be connected and linked to the regional trail system. \nThe only incumbent in the field, Council President Paul Winterstein, running for re-election to council Position 6, said Issaquah has land-use policies in place to promote the Green Necklace. \n“Obviously, enforcement is going to be a big part of that,” he said. \nWinterstein touted the $10 million park bond voters approved in 2013 as aiding that and other green efforts throughout the city. \nWinterstein’s opponent Christopher Reh said during his opening comments that he moved here because of the natural surroundings, and that there is a trailhead across the street from his home. But he added the city does not seem to be prioritizing green space, instead trying to please both environmentalists and developers. \n“We’ve adopted this stance that we can be everything to everybody,” he said. \nRunning for the Position 4 council seat, candidate Tim Flood noted he served on the committee that recommended the park bond. He several times noted the city has to work to protect its green spaces by slowing the pace of development. Flood again touted his traffic plan, “Address the Mess,” noting it includes money for parks. \nFlood’s opponent for the Position 4 seat is Bill Ramos, currently chairman of the city’s human services commission. He said his current position taught him you can’t tackle issues alone, that you need to get the facts, find any science behind those facts and then take a stance and fight for that stance, including questions in the environmental arena. \nIn talking about forested hillsides, nearly all of the candidates pointed to the Central Issaquah Plan as designed to keep development centrally located. But Reh and Flood both argued the city is allowing too much development outside the CIP area, such as in the Issaquah Highlands. \n“The trees on the hillsides are one of our trademarks,” Reh added. \nWinterstein countered that some development was approved years ago prior to implementation of the CIP. \nRunning unopposed for the Position 2 seat on council, candidate Jennifer Sutton also took part in the forum. She condemned the city’s traffic, saying all those idling cars do nothing good for the environment. Sutton also said tree removal particularly bothers her. \nSutton is involved with the King County Conservation Voters, a position, she added, that has introduced her to various “conservation heroes,” as she put it, people who can help her with issues facing Issaquah. \nLasting about two hours, the forum attracted about 20 people to the King County Library Services administration building. Several local environmental groups, including the Friends of Lake Sammamish State Park and the Issaquah Alps Trails Club, sponsored the forum. \nWritten by Tom Corrigan · Filed Under Elections , Local News \nCopyright © 2015 by Issaquah Press Inc.
