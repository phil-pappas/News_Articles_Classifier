Louisville received 649 points from the Blue Ribbon Panel, including a pair of first-place votes, while earning 190 points from the league’s 15 head coaches. Notre Dame was picked to win the title in both polls. \nSophomore Mariya Moore, one of four returning letterwinners, was voted to both the coaches' and the Blue Ribbon Panel's all-ACC teams. The Hercules, Calif., native was named an All-American by the Associated Press (honorable mention) and Full Court (first team) in addition to securing postseason all-conference accolades. She paced Louisville a season ago in scoring (13.4), while totaling 121 assists and 55 steals. \nLouisville freshman Asia Durr was named to the ACC Newcomer Watch List, comprised of true and redshirt freshmen, also by both the Blue Ribbon Panel and the coaches. The top-ranked recruit in the class of 2015 and a two-time Miss Georgia Basketball selection, Durr finished her prep career with 2,764 points on better than 50 percent shooting, 706 rebounds, 254 assists, 266 steals, and 75 blocks. \nLouisville is one of just three schools - others are Duke and Notre Dame - with at least one student-athlete on each of the four lists (ACC coaches' and Blue Ribbon preseason all-ACC teams and coaches' and Newcomer Watch Lists). \nIn addition to Moore, Louisville regains the services of All-American and all-ACC freshman team member Myisha Hines-Allen, sophomore and classmate Arica Carter, and redshirt junior Cortnee Walton. Hines-Allen averaged 11.8 points and 4.9 rebounds as a freshman, while Carter totaled 52 assists and 31 steals in a reserve role. Walton played in four games, but was sidelined for the remainder of the season following a foot injury originally sustained in the preseason. \nThe Cardinals will be supplemented by the No. 1 recruiting class in the country. Headlined by Durr, the five-player group boasts McDonald’s All-Americans Taja Cole (Richmond, Va.) and Sam Fuehring (Wanaque, N.J.) and highly touted out-of-state products Erin DeGrate (Waco, Texas) and Brianna Jones (North Babylon, N.Y.). \nUnder the direction of ninth-year head coach Jeff Walz, Louisville opens the 2015-16 campaign on Nov. 15 at home against 2013 Final Four opponent California. Season ticket information is available on GoCards.com. \nWalz, the winningest coach in program history, has guided Louisville to a 208-77 mark and seven NCAA Tournament appearances in eight seasons. Twice, he directed the Cardinals to the national championship game. \nFor the latest information on Louisville women's basketball, log on to GoCards.com, or, for up-to-the-minute updates, follow the team's Twitter account at www.twitter.com/UofLWBB or on Facebook at www.facebook.com/UofLWBB. \nPredicted Order of Finish (as selected by the Blue Ribbon Panel) 1.
