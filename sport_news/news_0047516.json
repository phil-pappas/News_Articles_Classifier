Bring out all the reinforcements. I need it LOUD.”\nArrieta addressed the first tweet Monday during his hourlong interview with ESPN 1000’s “Carmen and Jurko Show” at Chicago Cut Steakhouse.\n“There are so many things on Twitter, so many mentions, it’s hard to get through all of them,” Arrieta said. “The one that I responded just happened to be the first or second one I saw. I didn’t know who it was. I just felt like it was time to throw a little something out there and let the people on Twitter go nuts.\n\"What I was referring to was the crowd. It’s not going to affect the way I pitch. I’m going to go out there and prepare and execute like I have been. I’m not saying I won’t make a mistake throughout the game. It’s up to them to capitalize on those mistakes.”\nSwallow your pride: Downtown and North Side Giordano’s locations will sell large stuffed pizzas decorated with the Cubs' trademark “W” flag logo the day of Cubs playoff games beginning Wednesday. The “W” on the “Fly the W” pizza is made of fresh parmesan cheese. The Giordano’s in Prudential Plaza sold a pizza with a parmesan cheese Cubs logo during the Cubs Convention in January. Giordano’s – if you didn’t already know – is a Cubs sponsor.\n\"Fly the W\" Pizza Photo courtesy of Giordano's Famous Stuffed Pizza The Cubs-inspired \"Fly the W\" Pizza from Giordano's.\nThe Cubs-inspired \"Fly the W\" Pizza from Giordano's.\n(Photo courtesy of Giordano's Famous Stuffed Pizza) By the numbers: 1.

Sandberg is expected to watch the wild card game at Harry Caray’s that night.\nOn the record: “We got the nice cool weather for you. You ought to be able to run all day.
