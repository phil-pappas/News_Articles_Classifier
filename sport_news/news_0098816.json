It’s not clear how long the outage lasted, but by 11 a.m., the ice surface was only partially frozen, with many large puddles visible on the surface.\nSutter said he inquired about whether the Kings could practice at Staples Center, but the arena was being prepared for a Lakers preseason game. Players instead participated in off-ice workouts.\n“(It’s disruptive) in the sense that you wanted a theme for the week,’’ Sutter said. “You have things you could’ve worked on that require you to be on the ice. It was disappointing.’’\nThe timing is unfortunate for the Kings, who don’t play again until Thursday but had already scheduled Tuesday as a day off, in order to participate in a charity golf tournament.\nThe issues, going forward, are whether the power outages will continue and whether rink workers can improve the surface, which – independent of power issues – has been of poor quality this season.\n“We struggled with ice issues here all (during) training camp, quite honestly,’’ Sutter said, “so hopefully this will spur (improvements) on a little.’’\nWithin the past 10 days, the rink has had at least four power outages, including one that caused the Kings to cancel their morning skate last Tuesday. Even when the Kings can get on the ice, it’s been choppy. Goalie coach Bill Ranford, charged with shoveling excess snow off the ice during practice, has been busy.\nBACK ON TRACK\nFive goals allowed, then four, then two, then one, then one. Clearly, things have been trending in a good direction for Kings goalie Jonathan Quick, and not simply because of those numbers.\nQuick allowed nine goals in his first two games but has been stellar in his last two. Quick stopped 47 of 49 shots and helped the Kings to two 2-1 victories. He has also led the way for the Kings’ penalty-killing unit, which is 16 for 18 in the last four games.\n“I really think he’s been effective,’’ Sutter said. “It goes without saying that his first game was a tough game for him, but it goes without saying also that Jonathan is Jonathan. There’s only a handful of those guys in the league who can win you games (by himself), and he’s one of them.’’\nCORE OF FOUR\nThe Kings’ defensemen probably didn’t mind Monday’s day off. In a one-goal game Monday, Sutter essentially kept rookie Derek Forbort and veteran Christian Ehrhoff on the bench in the third period.\nForbort, in his second NHL game, had only two third-period shifts and sat the last 15 minutes. Ehrhoff, who can be shaky defensively at times, didn’t play in the last six-plus minutes.\nThe fact that the Kings took three penalties in the game’s final 10 minutes also contributed greatly to Sutter’s reliance on Drew Doughty, Brayden McNabb, Jake Muzzin and Alec Martinez.\n“There are four guys who are playing heavy minutes for us,’’ Sutter said, “so they have to be really, really effective guys. You have to see, shift in and shift out, that they’re consistent in what they’re doing.’’\nContact the writer: rhammond@ocregister.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T11:50:10.537+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
