MARK J. TERRILL , ASSOCIATED PRESS Related article » LOS ANGELES – Clayton Kershaw had already thrown more innings than any pitcher in baseball this season and struck out more batters than any pitcher since 2002 when manager-for-the-day Jimmy Rollins came out to pull him from Sunday’s essentially-meaningless season finale.\nAnd he still didn’t want to come out.\n“He was like, ‘Man, I can get him out of the stretch,’” Rollins said after the Dodgers beat the San Diego Padres 6-3. “I was like, ‘It’s over my head, Clayton.’ He said, ‘Really? They sent you out here to get me?’ ‘Yeah.’ So he handed me the ball, punched me in the chest and walked off the mound.”\nGiven Kershaw’s recent dugout confrontation with Manager Don Mattingly over being pulled from a start, a playful punch in the chest was pretty tame.\n“Kersh came out easy for him,” Mattingly said with mock indignation after the game. “He came out smiling. I haven’t seen Kersh smile on the field in, like, five years. And he’s smiling out there? That ain’t right.”\nKershaw took the mound Sunday needing six strikeouts to become the first pitcher since Randy Johnson and Curt Schilling in 2002 to strike out 300 batters in a season. He needed just 10 batters and 37 pitches to get there.\n“It’s definitely a cool thing,” Kershaw said of the achievement. “Obviously not the most important thing in the world. But it’s something when your career is all said and done that you can look back at and say I did that once.”\nKershaw’s catcher and close friend, A.J. Ellis, wasn’t buying it.\n“It’s really special,” Ellis said. “I know it meant a lot to him – even though I’m sure he lied and said it didn’t.”\nLimited to 60 pitches in his final tuneup start before the NLDS, Kershaw struck out seven while pitching 32/3 innings. He finished the season with a 2.13 ERA, a 0.88 WHIP and major-league leading totals of 301 strikeouts and 2322/3 innings.\nAnd he probably won’t win his fourth Cy Young Award for those efforts. Teammate Zack Greinke and Chicago Cubs right-hander Jake Arrieta have created a remarkably close three-way race with strong cases easy to make for any of the three.\n“Zack,” Kershaw said when asked who he thinks should win the award. “Lowest ERA. Lowest WHIP. What else do you want?”\nThe Dodgers hit three home runs in Sunday's win – two-run home runs by Joc Pederson and Chris Heisey and a solo home run by Corey Seager. They finished the season with 187 home runs, passing the Colorado Rockies on the final day of the season to lead the National League.\nThey finish the regular season with 92 wins, their third consecutive 90-win season (the first time since 1976-78) and third consecutive NL West division title. The Dodgers have never made the postseason in three consecutive seasons before, but will open their National League Division Series against the NL East champion New York Mets on Friday at Dodger Stadium. Kershaw is expected to start against Mets right-hander Jacob deGrom.\n“We’re ready. We’re as ready as we’ll ever be,” Mattingly said. “You’re hoping guys just kind of click this time of year, hope everything falls into place – that we execute, the ball bounces our way a little bit and things go our way.”\nContact the writer: bplunkett@ocregister.com", "external_links": ["http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nvq4ue-b88531608z.120151004184214000gh8cd335.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nvq4ui-b88531608z.120151004184214000gh8cd33b.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nvq4uh-b88531608z.120151004184214000gqucd0j3.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nvq4ud-b88531608z.120151004184214000gh8cd337.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nvq4uh-b88531608z.120151004184214000gh8cd339.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nvq4ue-b88531608z.120151004184214000gh8cd335.10.jpg", "http://assets.pinterest.com/js/pinmarklet.js?r=", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nvq4uf-b88531608z.120151004184214000gh8cd333.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nvq4uh-b88531608z.120151004184214000gh8cd339.10.jpg", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/fb-ico.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nvq4uh-b88531608z.120151004184214000gqucd0j3.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nvq4ug-b88531608z.120151004184214000gh8cd33f.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nvq4uf-b88531608z.120151004184214000gh8cd331.10.jpg", "http://s7.addthis.com/js/250/addthis_widget.js#username=YOUR-ACCOUNT-ID", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nvq4ug-b88531608z.120151004184214000gh8cd33f.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nvq4uf-b88531608z.120151004184214000gh8cd333.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nvq4ug-b88531608z.120151004184214000gh8cd33d.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nvq4ug-b88531608z.120151004184214000gh8cd33d.10.jpg", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/twitter-ico.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nvq4ui-b88531608z.120151004184214000gh8cd33b.10.jpg", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/mail-ico.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nvq4uf-b88531608z.120151004184214000gh8cd331.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nvq4ud-b88531608z.120151004184214000gh8cd337.10.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T05:15:27.536+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
