The agreement came during daylong talks convened by the NFL in London involving representatives of 15 sports leagues, including the National Hockey League and World Rugby. The panel discussed a range of initiatives to identify, treat and prevent concussions.\nMichael Turner, medical director of the Concussion Foundation, said the research starting in January would investigate the suspected link between concussions and the onset of an incurable brain degenerative disease called CTE, short for chronic traumatic encephalopathy, which can be definitively diagnosed only after death.\n\"Collaboration with the NFL will significantly accelerate the research we are doing with retired jockeys and help establish if there is any independent evidence that concussion has a long-term impact on health,\" Turner said.\nThe NFL and Turner didn't specify the funding commitment involved.\nIn 2013 the NFL reached a $765 million settlement with thousands of former players who sued the league, complaining of various conditions involving brain damage and degeneration. Last month, researchers at Boston University and the Department of Veterans Affairs announced they had found CTE in 87 of 91 brains tested of deceased former NFL players. Symptoms of CTE include memory loss, confusion, impaired judgment, aggression and depression.\n NFL Football Pro Men Associated Press", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share"], "published": "2015-10-25T01:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T17:47:31.245+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
