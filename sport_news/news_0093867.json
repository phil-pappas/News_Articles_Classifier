But they'll need quite a comeback to claim their first pennant in seven decades as they try to end that World Series championship drought that dates to 1908. \nArrieta led the majors with 22 wins and was so dominant on the mound after the All-Star break, his second-half performance ranks as one of the best in baseball history. He went 11-0 with a 0.41 ERA in 12 starts from Aug. 4 through the end of the season, then pitched a five-hit shutout at Pittsburgh to win the NL wild-card game. \nBut with his 2015 total now approaching 250 innings, the Cy Young Award contender has been much less effective in his last two outings. \nCubs manager Joe Maddon was asked if he thinks Arrieta's workload has taken a toll. \n\"I mean, I can't deny that it might be. I don't know that. If you ask him, he'll tell you no,\" Maddon said. \"If that (radar) gun was correct on the field, he might have been down a mile an hour or two, that's what I saw.\" \n\"From the side, delivery was good. He was not laboring to throw the ball. It's just, it wasn't as crisp as it had been, that's all,\" the manager added. \nArrieta finally got touched up at home by St. Louis in Game 3 of the Division Series. He yielded four runs and five hits in 5 2-3 innings of an 8-6 win that left him 2-0 with a 2.45 ERA and 20 strikeouts in two playoff starts. \nWorking on an extra day of rest against the Mets, the right-hander fell behind 3-0 after 13 pitches at chilly Citi Field. \n\"That was the game right there,\" Maddon said. \"It was really hard to recover from that.\" \nPitching in short sleeves on a windy, 45-degree night, Arrieta gave up a leadoff single to Curtis Granderson and a hit-and-run double to slumping David Wright that put the Mets ahead. \nMurphy reached down for a 1-2 curve and hooked it into the right-field corner for his fifth homer in these playoffs. He has connected in four consecutive games. \n\"I don't know so much that it was a lack of Jake's ability as much as it was a pretty hot hitter,\" Maddon said. \nIncluding the postseason, Arrieta had gone 25 straight starts (since May 29 against Kansas City) without allowing a run in the first inning, according to STATS. \nIt was only the second time he gave up at least three runs in the first. The other game also came against the Royals, on July 30, 2010, STATS said. \nArrieta issued a leadoff walk in the third to Granderson, who stole second and third before scoring on Yoenis Cespedes' infield single. \nWith his team trailing 4-0, Arrieta was pulled for a pinch-hitter to start the sixth. It matched his shortest start of the year. \nWhen the Cubs were unable to rally, Arrieta was handed his first loss since July 25 against Philadelphia. After that, he won 13 consecutive decisions - including the playoffs. \nBut still, no Cubs pitcher has won three games in one postseason. \n\"Jake wasn't as sharp as he can be, but he definitely held serve,\" Maddon said. \"But the ambush early got us.\" \nArrieta was outpitched by New York rookie Noah Syndergaard, who lost his major league debut to Arrieta at Wrigley Field in May. \nThis time, Syndergaard carried a one-hit shutout into the sixth. He was lifted after Kris Bryant smacked an RBI double off the left-field wall, but the Cubs couldn't get anything going against New York's bullpen. \nPOWER OUTAGE \nChicago is batting .159 in the series with three extra-base hits. The Cubs have one NLCS home run after hitting 12 in their first five playoff games this year. \nEND OF THE ROAD \nArrieta's only other defeat on the road this year came on May 7 at St. Louis. He entered Sunday night 14-1 with a 1.49 ERA away from home, including the wild-card game. Copyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
