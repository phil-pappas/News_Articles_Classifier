(AP) - State transportation officials say work is nearly completed on the replacement of two suburban Albany interstate bridges on one of the busiest stretches of highway in upstate New York.\nDepartment of Transportation Commissioner Matthew Driscoll announced Wednesday that the $22 million project in the town of Colonie is on track to be finished by the end of the month. The project has replaced the bridges carrying Interstate 87 - the Adirondack Northway - over Albany-Shaker Road.\nThe new bridges replace the originals that were built during Northway construction in 1959. They carry an average of about 100,000 vehicles each day.\nShoulder paving and landscaping will continue for the next two weeks.\nThe work began in late February and caused traffic backups when northbound and southbound lanes had to be shut down for portions of the project.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T13:24:17.604+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
