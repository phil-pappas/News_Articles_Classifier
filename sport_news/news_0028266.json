Justin Walterscheid, the previous assistant offensive coordinator and receivers coach, has replaced him.\n\"There is a lot of adversity with the change,\" Southern Utah coach Ed Lamb said. \"I have tremendous confidence in our team and in Justin. We're not changing anything. But every coordinator brings a little bit different perspective.\"\nAccording to Lamb, he still doesn't know all the details behind Crowton's decision to step away.\n  \"He's played it very close to the vest,\" Lamb said, \"but it was not a case of … us getting rid of him.

The Thunderbirds are 3-2 overall and 2-0 in the Big Sky Conference. They are one of two teams that remain unbeaten in league play. The other is Eastern Washington.\n\"I hope we're not paying too much attention to the conference standings right now,\" Lamb said. \"It's very early.\"\nluhm@sltrib.com Twitter: @sluhm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T06:55:26.544+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
