That's good for the lowest amount of points per game for any team in the country.\n1. The defense\n\"High-powered offense\" and \"Big 12\" pretty much go hand in hand nowadays. The conference is known for its explosive offenses, and for good reason. A \"good\" defense could give up 600-plus yards and 40-plus points and call it a victory as long as the team's offense wins the shootout.\nWest Virginia has a good offense, but its defense is what sets it apart from the rest of the conference.\nThe team runs a 3-3-5 defense and has been incredibly successful this season. Through three games the team has given up a total of 23 points. That's good for the least average per game in the country at 7.7 points a game.\nAre Georgia Southern, Liberty and Maryland offensive powerhouses? Not by any stretch. But the Mountaineers have gotten off to a great start on defense, especially in the passing game. Teams have only completed 45 percent of their throws against the West Virginia defense averaging 154 yards per game. Both sit in the top 25 teams in the country.\nThe one \"weakness,\" if you can call it that, is the Mountaineers' run defense. A year ago Samaje Perine had a breakout game against WVU racking up 242 rushing yards and four touchdowns on 34 total carries. He, along with Joe Mixon, could do some damage again this year.\n2. It's leader -- Karl Joseph\nThe 5-11 safety is a wrecking ball. Karl Joseph has all the tools to be an effective safety in the NFL. Early projections have him has a fourth round pick in next year's draft .\nThrough three games he already has four interceptions and 15 total tackles. And he can hit. Hard.\nThat his was from last year's game against TCU where Joseph (who stands at a mighty 197 pounds) absolutely lit up tight end Cliff Murphy. For further clarification, that's six-foot-four, 288 pound tight end Cliff Murphy.\nOther names to keep an eye on are Daryl Worley and K.J. Dillon, both of whom are defensive backs that are over six feet tall. They have a combined five passes defended in three games, which means Sterling Shepard and Durron Neal are going to face some stiff competition.\n3. Series history\nSince 1958, the two teams have met a total of seven times, with one of those meetings being the 2008 Fiesta Bowl where the Mountaineers humbled the Sam Bradford-led Sooners 48-28. Since then, the Sooners have figured out WVU.\nThe last three meetings between the two teams have seen an increase in the amount of points the Sooners have won by; one in 2012, nine in 2013 and 12 last season. Oddly enough, the Sooners have been more efficient on offense in the two meetings in Morgantown, WV., which is a tough place to play for any Big 12 team.\n4. Skyler Howard\nLike nearly every other quarterback in the Big 12, Howard can be as lethal with his legs as he is with his arm. In six career starts, he averages 290 yards through the air and 38 rushing yards a game.\nHe's also getting better as he gets more starts. In three games as a sophomore he completed a tad more than half of his passes at 50.9 percent. That number is up to 69 percent this year.\nOut of all of his stats, one that stands out is his ability to not turn the ball over. He's throw just one interception in 84 passing attempts. He may be able to keep that positive streak going against a Sooners defense that has only forced two turnovers this year (to compare, West Virginia has forced 11 in the same amount of games played).\n5. More on that defense\nWhen West Virginia has needed a shift in momentum, the defense has stepped up in some big ways. According to Charleston Gazette-Mail writer , Mike Casazza the WVU defense has forced five turnovers when their opponents have been inside their 30 yard line. Two of those five turnovers were in the end zone in the team's last game against Maryland (a forced fumble recovered in the end zone and an interception).\nMore impressively, West Virginia's only two turnovers of the season were immediately followed by interceptions by the Mountaineer defense giving the ball right back to the WVU offense, according to Casazza.\nFollow Joshua Friemel on Twitter at @Josh_Friemel .\nOn Twitter:\n @Josh_Friemel", "external_links": ["http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/draft/players/1983624/karl-joseph", "http://makegif.com/g12kw.gif", "http://makegif.com/g12kw", "https://twitter.com/Josh_Friemel", "http://www.wvgazettemail.com/article/20150928/GZ02/150929469/1143", "http://twitter.com/Josh_Friemel"], "published": "2015-10-01T06:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T06:17:33.840+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
