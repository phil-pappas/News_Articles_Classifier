They've witnessed his lowest moment of the year, a Sunday Night Baseball massacre in Baltimore, when he gave up four home runs and eight runs in 6.1 innings. But, they also saw him throttle the Astros in game-5 of the ALDS last week. Cueto held Houston to just 2 hits and two runs over eight innings. He set down the last 19 men he faced, the longest perfect playoff stretch since Don Larson's perfect game in the 1956 World Series.\nWhich Johnny Cueto will Royals fans see Monday night?\nThis postseason, the Royals are 2-0 in games Cueto's started. He carries a 3.86 ERA in two postseason appearances.\nThat will be the major storyline at the beginning of game-3.\nCopyright 2015 KCTV (Meredith Corp.)
