Upon further review, you can’t blame all the sacks on the alignment. Four of the five came when an offensive lineman simply got beat one-on-one. Nate Solder had the toughest game, allowing two sacks. Sebastian Vollmer and Marcus Cannon were responsible for one apiece. The first sack of the game, less than two minutes in, came on a third-and-10 and pushed the Patriots out of field-goal range. On this sack, credit goes to the Cowboys’ defensive scheme. Using only three defensive linemen, the Cowboys rushed two linebackers up the middle and caused massed confusion among the offensive linemen. Rolando McClain blitzed through the A-gap between center David Andrews and right guard Josh Kline. Both Andrews and Kline had their hands full with defensive end DeMarcus Lawrence and Tyrone Crawford, leaving the linebacker untouched to Tom Brady. Dallas’ second sack, about five minutes into the game, didn’t need any disguising. It was all Greg Hardy. He rushed to the outside, swept right around Soldier and landed a solid hit on Brady. Hardy’s second sack came early in the second quarter. This time the defensive end blew by Cannon. It was similar to Hardy's first sack, except that Cannon tried to push Hardy but failed to disrupt his path to Brady and a strip sack. The Patriots got a break, when safety Barry Church did not make the recovery, even though the ball bounced right to him. Julian Edelman eventually covered the ball. Later on that same drive, the Cowboys collected their fourth sack. On a third down, Jack Crawford pushed Vollmer to the outside and snuck inside to sack Brady. It was a rare poor play for Vollmer, who has been consistent this season at right tackle. The fifth and final sack allowed came with 53 seconds remaining in the first half, and resulted in an elbow injury for Solder. The left tackle was battling with Tyrone Crawford when it appeared that his right arm got hyperextended. Solder had a hook on the defensive tackle, but Crawford tossed him aside and got to Brady. It was a poor start for the Patriots offensive line, but the group deserves credit for rebounding in the second half. The offense used players like Dion Lewis, Rob Gronkowski and Michael Williams to help the offensive tackles handle Hardy and Jack Crawford. That extra help, combined with a quicker release by Brady, helped push the offense forward. Edelman, Lewis prove to be elusive Edelman said that Bill Belichick had talked all week about Dallas’ open-field tackling. Edelman and Lewis, however, made it extremely difficult for the Cowboys to make any sort of open-field stop. It was an impressive game by both players. Early in the third quarter, Lewis caught a pass at the line of scrimmage and evaded three defenders to gain seven yards for the first down. The back’s first step is eye-opening. On this play, he faked outside and then sprinted inside to initially fake out safety Jeff Heath. That play, however, was only the appetizer. Later in the same drive, from the Dallas 10-yard line, Brady faked a jet-sweep to Edelman before throwing the ball to Lewis, right at the line of scrimmage. Lewis caught the pass with one hand. Next, he got past Church by faking outside and running inside. Lewis then ducked underneath Jack Crawford and broke attempted tackles by Corey White and J.J. Wilcox for the score. Dallas bit on the run fake to Edelman, pushing most of the defense to the left side of the field, but Lewis still had to work to get the score. In the fourth quarter, Edelman got in on the fun. On his 59-yard touchdown reception, he ran through four defenders and broke two tackles (from Brandon Carr and Sean Lee) on his way to the end zone. Edelman caught the ball on the left sideline and made a great cutback to get to the middle of the field. Earlier in the game, Edelman embarrassed cornerback Morris Claiborne before catching a wide-open pass for 16 yards. His feet were so quick as he faked outside that by the time he cut inside, the cornerback was on the ground. Secondary rises to the occasion Defensively, the Patriots secondary deserves a lot of credit for its play on Sunday. The cornerbacks stifled the Cowboys’ receivers and with some help, the safeties shut down tight end Jason Witten. That forced Brandon Weeden to rely on short passes to his running backs, which were not enough to get Dallas back into the game. The Patriots started out mostly in man coverage. They had Malcolm Butler lined up on Terrance Williams for most of the game. Logan Ryan and Justin Coleman played on the other side of the field and Tarell Brown was mainly used in the slot to cover Cole Beasley. In the second half, the secondary played more zone, conceding short passes from Weeden to Darren McFadden. In the end, only 83 of Weeden’s 188 passing yards went to wide receivers. Butler had a nice game. Weeden was 1-of-4 for 17 yards when targeting the corner. Butler also had a pass deflection. Brown gave up the most yards (three catches on five targets for 33 yards), but a large chunk of that came on one play, Beasley’s 21-yard catch in the second half. Coleman was only targeted once, giving up a 13-yard reception. Ryan had one of his best games of the season. The corner allowed one reception for three yards on four targets. He also had an interception. Ryan had perfect coverage on his interception midway through the fourth. He was stride for stride with Vince Mayle and made Weeden pay for the bad pass. Devin McCourty and Patrick Chung played well against Witten, who finished with five catches for 33 yards. They had help, as the Patriots were using defensive ends like Jabaal Sheard to jam the tight end at the line of scrimmage. McCourty deserves credit for his solo tackle on Witten, two yards shy of a first down, late in the third quarter. The play forced the Cowboys to settle for a field goal.
