Norfolk Festevents is going to make sure you can still see the football game- on a BIG SCREEN! \nODU fans can gather at Town Point Park on November 7th at 4 p.m. for picnics and “tailgating” in the park. The game starts at 7, and it’ll be broadcast live on a large outdoor screen. \nBring your lawn chairs, blankets and picnics. DO NOT BRING: cars, grilling, tents, or your own alcohol. Food and drink will be available for purchase at the event, including beer and wine. \nIf you really want to go big, Festevents is accepting reservations for a limited number of 20’ x 20’ VIP boxes for private entertaining throughout the event. Contact Domenick Fini for more details at finid@festevents.org. \nIt’ll be happening rain or shine (in case of really bad inclement weather), and we hope to see you there!", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T19:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T18:21:37.132+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
