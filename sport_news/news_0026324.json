If a team doesn’t finish in top three but qualifies at least three individuals, that team will also advance to the state championships as a team, according to NCHSAA bylaws. Also, a top-three team could qualify its fourth and fifth golfer among top 17 individual qualifiers. Time is running out, at least in Kaitlyn Maready’s mind. She’s not on the 18th green just yet, but the two-time Coastal 3-A Conference player of the year is certainly on the back nine of what has been stellar golf career at Jacksonville High School. If only all that was needed was to pull out the big dog, which she smokes “250ish” and generally – 85 to 90 percent of the time by her reckoning – down the middle of the fairway. Then she’d have no reason to fret. The 16-year-old junior dreams of playing college golf. And her ultimate dream is to play golf for Duke. Hence, her concern with time. With just one full season left to show what she can do – as if she hasn’t already done that, she knows it’s time to get it done. “It’s very nerve-racking because whenever I was a freshman or sophomore, it was like, Okay, you can keep getting better, you’ve still got a lot of time,” Maready said. “But now I’m kind of like at the point where I’m out of time. I need to get better now. So it’s a little stressful, but in a way it kind of helps me.” What would help her even more, especially in the eyes of college coaches, would be a strong showing Monday in the NCHSAA 3-A East Regional at Wedgewood Public Golf Course in Wilson and an equally solid effort in the state championships Oct. 26-27 at Foxfire Resort and Golf Club. While all but a shoo-in to advance to the state finals – she made it as a freshman and sophomore, Maready isn’t taking anything for granted. But she also has big goals. “I definitely want to be in the 70s at regionals,” said Maready, who shot a 91 in last year’s regional. “It’s like a goal for me, and I’d like to be in the top at the regionals, like (among) the top players. Then if I make it to states, I definitely want to be in the top 10. I definitely want to make sure I look good for anyone looking at me.” Anyone paying any attention so far would have seen a golfer who has been medalist in all 14 conference tournaments the last two years and who improved her stroke average to 80 from 82 last year. Along the way, she also shot a school-record 4-over 76 at the Morehead City Country Club. “That,” she said, “was the craziest day ever. I had two doubles. I had four bogeys. I had four birdies. Throughout, I was like, ‘Oh, my gosh,’ but I love Morehead’s course.” Page 2 of 2 - She also said she “loved” earning conference player of the year honors again this year. “It feels great,” she said. “I wanted to make sure I could live up to what I did last year.” Coach Tim Hood had no doubt his star would do exactly that. “She’s one of those special talents that comes along once a career,” Hood said. “But really the sky’s the limit. If she squares up a couple things in her short game, then she will be around even par next season.” What makes her so good? Hard work? Talent? Just a knack for the game, mentally and – or – physically? “All of the above,” Hood said. “She’s blessed with some natural ability, but she’s played a lot of golf in her life. She hits the ball a very long way in comparison to a lot of her competitors. So she has an advantage from that perspective. But she’s worked pretty hard in her career so far.” And he firmly believes that career will continue into college. “I think she can be big-time Division I in my opinion,” he said. “She’s got that potential.” Earlier this month, Maready won her second straight ladies championship at Rock Creek Country Club. The teenager shot 83-84 to claim the title again. Maready, however, didn’t mention that during an interview. Hood did. While she certainly knows she’s talented and has a gift for golf, Maready also had no problem coming up with areas she needs to improve on. For example, she said she worked hard this year to improve her short game. “I definitely was struggling with that. I definitely did improve on it. Some things I had to glue more together,” she said. “So I still have much to improve on, but I improved overall as putting everything together, I guess you could say, which was great.” So why does someone who hits the ball off the tee on average 245 to 260 yards struggle with her chipping and putting? “I don’t know,” she said with a laugh. “They’re saying it’s all in my head because I got it all. It’s just getting it all together. It’s a head game in a way.” What isn’t a head game, however, is playing in regionals or states. While some may get nervous, Maready said she’s always been able to remain calm. “I’m not nervous when I’m there,” she said. “I love it out there. Any kind of tournaments I love. States, you’ve got the best players in the state, and it’s so much fun to compete against them and see all the talent out there. It’s great.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T15:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T15:15:26.908+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
