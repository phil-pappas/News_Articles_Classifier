The English side has four points, while Maccabi remains pointless. \n“It was a very important win for us,” Brahimi said. “But we are not qualified yet. We have to win one more match.” \nPorto, coming off a 2-1 win over Chelsea, will play its next match at Maccabi, while Chelsea will host Dynamo Kiev. \n“We wanted to win and we managed to do that,” Porto midfielder Andre Andre said. “We played a good match, we controlled things well in the second half and we are top of our group. \n“There are still three games to go, though, and we know that the next one, in Israel, will be very difficult.” \nCopyright © 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T00:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T02:14:15.373+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
