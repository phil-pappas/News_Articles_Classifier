These included a double homicide outside the Hour Glass Pub & Eatery in Northeast Portland's Montavilla neighborhood, and a homicide at the Pallas strip club on Southeast Powell Boulevard.\nAt least two more shootings have unfolded since then, bringing the 2015 tally to 148 so far.\nWhat do we know about the trends behind this big increase?\nThe Oregonian/OregonLive's Everton Bailey worked with visual media artist Mark Graves to produce a video animation of the data behind the violence.\nWe know from this, for example, that May was the biggest burst of gang calls , and that nighttime is when most gunplay breaks out.\nWe'll continue to track gang team calls on our interactive map through the rest of the year. Data are typically updated every two weeks.\nVideos and maps can give you the lay of the land.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T15:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T00:19:05.455+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
