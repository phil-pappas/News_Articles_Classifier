Not a big enough difference to have the attention on this that it’s gotten. What I come down to is, does it really matter? Some guys like the ball a little softer. And if a guy likes a harder ball, that’s fine too. We want the quarterbacks to be as successful as they can be, and we want them to give the fans the best entertainment they can. Who cares if a quarterback likes it at 10 and a half? If that makes him play better, fine.”\nThe GM believes giving the four-time Super Bowl Champion extra motivation is bad news for his Broncos.\nBrady has come out of the gate flying this fall, and is a frontrunner to be named the league's MVP. Through five games, he's thrown 14 touchdowns, one interception and is averaging 339.8 yards per game through the air. His quarterback rating is 118.4, and he's on pace to have the best statistical season of his career.\nBrady has downplayed any quest for revenge, but Elway thinks Deflategate has been the catalyst for his torrid start.\n“The last thing you want to do is poke the bear,\" Elway said. \"The bear got poked, and this is what happened.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T23:28:04.790+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
