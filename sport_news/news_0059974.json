Caption The Falcons beat the Redskins, 25-19, in overtime. Washington Redskins quarterback Kirk Cousins drops back to pass against the Atlanta Falcons at the Georgia Dome on Oct. 11. John McDonnell/The Washington Post Wait 1 second to continue. \nThe Washington Redskins suffered another coulda-shoulda-woulda loss on Sunday, falling in overtime to the Atlanta Falcons. \nThe Falcons struggled much of the game, and Washington moved the ball, but the Redskins couldn’t capitalize and score points needed to put the game away. The momentum appeared to have shifted back into their direction as they forced overtime, but another self-inflicted wound cost them the game. \nHere are five areas that stood out during this morning’s review of the game: \n1. The pick-six: The game-deciding play understandably has garnered the most scrutiny today as Redskins fans try to figure out exactly what went wrong. Was it Ryan Grant’s fault? Was Kirk Cousins to blame? Yes, Grant fell down, but that wasn’t the only element of the play that went poorly. Cousins got the ball out in a hurry, as he needed to with a defender coming off the edge unblocked. But the pass went wide and toward the sideline. Re-watching the play over and over, it’s evident that Grant and Cousins weren’t on the same page. Grant turned around to the right and sat on the route as if expecting a throw to the inside. Cousins sent the ball to the outside toward the sideline. As Grant tried to pivot and get outside to the ball, he slipped and fell. Robert Alford read the pass, caught it and returned it 59 yards for the game-winning touchdown. \n[ Bog: Playing the blame game on Cousins-Grant game-ending interception ] Atlanta cornerback Robert Alford, right, races to the end zone with an interception as wide receiver Ryan Grant, center, is blocked out of the game-ending play by defensive end Adrian Clayborn (John McDonnell/The Washington Post) \nCousins struggled with accuracy all day. On the bulk of his throws, he was a little off, whether too high or too far behind receivers. This throw appeared to be a little off as well, but without knowing the exact play call, it’s hard for us to say. However, Cousins did say Monday morning during his weekly radio appearance on 106.7 The Fan’s “Grant and Danny Show” that he should have thrown more to the inside to give Grant a better chance of making a play. But Grant falling down greatly impacted the play. Even if Cousins placed the ball as wide as he had, a sure-footed Grant would have at the least managed to make a play on the ball and swat it away from Alford, if not make the catch. It’s a play that both players would like to have back. \n2. Head-scratcher decisions: The game truthfully should have never come down to overtime. The Redskins had the chance to put the contest out of reach with a touchdown following Bashaud Breeland’s fourth-quarter interception and return to the 21-yard line. But Washington’s play-callers became too conservative after getting inside the 10-yard line. \nThe Matt Jones run from the 10 to the 6 was fine, but going back to Jones on the same play call the very next play seemed curious and predictable. A shot to the end zone on second and goal would’ve either produced a touchdown, but even if incomplete, Washington still would have another chance. \nThen the third-and-goal bubble screen to Jamison Crowder proved too predictable as well. As soon as the slot receiver motioned to that side, where Pierre Garcon and Ryan Grant were already lined up, the linebackers and defensive backs began cheating to that side. They swarmed Crowder instantly, dropping him for a four-yard loss. Washington had to settle for the field goal that made the lead 16-12 rather than a touchdown that could’ve resulted in a 20-12 lead. Had everything else played out the similarly, Atlanta would have had to attempt a two-point conversion with 24 seconds left just to tie and send it to overtime. \n3. Identity crisis in the run game? – Give the Falcons credit for preventing the Redskins from getting going on the ground. Washington squeezed out a measly 2.1 yards per carry on Sunday. Neither Matt Jones nor Alfred Morris could get on track. Atlanta did a good job of getting a push off the line and slipping through gaps in Washington’s front. And Washington’s tight ends also struggled to effectively block on the edges. Is quarterback Kirk Cousins handing off to Alfred Morris often enough? (Jonathan Newton/The Washington Post) \nBut it’s hard not to wonder if several other decisions have also held the Redskins in check. Despite statements from Jay Gruden that Alfred Morris remains the go-to guy, the coach has appeared to lose patience with the three-time thousand-yard rusher far too quickly. Splitting carries doesn’t appear to have benefited Jones either. Gruden and running backs coach Randy Jordan, who is also involved in the determining the in-game running back rotation, have made it hard for running backs to settle into any kind of a rhythm. Morris has proven himself as a rhythm runner. He may get off to slow starts, but he generally picks up in production as games continue. However, Jones quickly replaces him, and the sprinkling in of Chris Thompson seemed to prevent Jones from settling in too. \n[ Fancy Stats: Blame the running game for the offense’s woes, not the quarterback ] \nJones isn’t yet at the point where he can be the workhorse back. He has some flash runs, but far too often, he gets stopped for no gain. He needs to do more to earn the spot atop the depth chart. A patient approach with Morris should pay off, if his coaches could ever figure out they need to remain committed to him. When on limited carry counts, Morris doesn’t run with the same decisiveness. It’s like he doesn’t completely trust his eyes, or have a feel for the timing of his blockers, or the pace of the defense. Because Morris is the good soldier, he isn’t going into anyone’s office and demanding the ball, or voicing his frustrations through the media. But he needs to get the ball, again, and again. \n4. Defense leads the way – If anyone tells you they expected that a battered secondary that featured Will Blackmon primarily matched up against Julio Jones would limit the league’s leading receiver to just five catches for 67 yards on 10 targets, they’re lying. But Perry Fewell’s defensive backs got the job done against Jones, Roddy White and Leonard Hankerson (the last two combined for two catches for 36 yards). \n[ Barry’s defense proves it can make almost any game competitive ] \nThe cornerbacks and safeties did a good job of working together. The corners funneled the receivers toward their help coverage, and for the most part avoided one-on-one situations. Washington’s defensive front did a good job of pressuring Matt Ryan and preventing him from finding his rhythm. Washington recorded two interceptions after failing to record one in the first four games of the season. The defense struggled against the Falcons rushing attack, but still kept their team in the game and actually set up Cousins & Co. to win the game. \n\n[ A closer look at how the run defense faltered in Atlanta ] \nThe Falcons exposed a weakness in Washington’s defense. The front seven struggled to defend Atlanta’s outside runs. The zone-blocking scheme shouldn’t have given the Redskins so much trouble. They see those types of plays every day, even now, although Bill Callahan has instituted more power. Players predicted last week that they would defend these runs effectively. However, the Falcons instead succeeded at getting Washington’s defensive linemen running side to side, and out of their gaps. Linebackers also struggled to get off blocks, and Devonta Freeman found plenty of openings, becoming the first 100-yard rusher against the Redskins this season. Still, Washington’s defense deserves credit for the plays made. The unit certainly bent here and there, but it never broke. \n5. Not a moral victory – Jay Gruden said the Redskins are past the moral victory point , as he should have. However, many players expressed encouragement and satisfaction with the way they had played. They expressed disappointment over the loss, but said they took pride in the fight they had displayed. \nHowever, if this team truly is to develop into a winner, players have to feel sick about letting a game like Sunday’s get away from them. It’s possible that the “Disappointed with the loss, but not with how we played” talk was just players putting on a good face and trying to keep their fans encouraged. But behind closed doors, Washington’s offensive players need to beat themselves up over the missed opportunities. \nThe defense had three takeaways, and the offense scored only three points off of those gifts. The defense neutralized Jones, but they couldn’t get off the field on third downs and appeared gassed late as Freeman continued to roll. On a day where the offense wasn’t clicking, the defense needed to do a little more. And on a day where the defense did the unexpected and continued to disrupt the Falcons’ high-powered passing attack and protected a lead until late in the game, the offense needed to capitalize. \nLast year, after a narrow defeat against the Eagles, Washington’s players talked about the moral victory and expressed pride with the way that they had played. The next game, they went out and played terribly. It’s important that the Redskins not become complacent and begin believing that they are further along than they are. Up next is a trip to face the 3-1 Jets, and a home game against the struggling Buccaneers. Washington has a chance to own a 4-3 record at the bye. The NFC East is wide open . But if the Redskins unravel next weekend and the week after that and own a 2-5 record at the bye, with a road trip to New England awaiting after that, you can basically remove them from the list of surprise contenders in the division. \nMore from The Post :", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T20:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T20:46:19.272+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
