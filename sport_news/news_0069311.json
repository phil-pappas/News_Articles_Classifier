Elliott Bay is the scene for the annual Tengu Derby. \nThe summer-long hatchery chinook fishing closure in central Puget Sound was not a welcome sight for anglers, and after being open this month for a little more than two weeks it will be shutdown once again. \nState Fish and Wildlife has decided to close down the popular stretch of marine area after Sunday (Oct. 18) since the wild chinook encounter guideline was expected to be achieved. The area was supposed to remain open through Jan. 31. \nAccording to data, anglers had 1,512 chinook encounters through Oct. 11 under a guideline of 2,221. \nState fishery managers will crunch numbers to see if enough remains to possibly reopen the area at some point in the near future.
