In these conditions I knew the game would be unexpecting.” \nMillen briefly flashed her thoughts back to the Pocono Mountain East game. \n“I didn’t think it was our worst game, but I thought we’d hit a little lull,” Millen said. “We addressed it, and the girls really picked up their game today.” \n“I think we played really well today,” said Royer, who leads Parkland (7-3-1 overall, 4-3-1 league) with 10 goals. “Our passing was really on even though we had to thing about it because it was slow and wet.” \nRoyer can feel the camaraderie of the team picking up. \n“We have a good attitude,” she said. “We were real supportive of each other today.” \nLysakowsk scored less than seven minutes into the game to start a three-goal barrage between the teams in the next two minutes. \nEmilly Wahlgren scored for Nazareth to tie it 1-1 before Royer answered right back to put the Trojans in front to stay, 2-1, with 21:47 left in the first half. \n“It really all stems from the forwards,” said Royer, who splits time between forward and midfield. “They all work hard to get it up there. The ball tipped off the defender and I shot it and it went in. It really gave us momentum.” \nLauren Resh made it interesting when her goal pulled Nazareth (7-5, 6-5) within 3-2 with 13:12 left in the game. However, the Trojans held off Nazareth’s challenge with the help of goalkeeper Brie Barraco, who made eight saves. \n“We were expecting a pretty good game,” Royer said. “They tied us last year. They’re a strong team and we were expecting a pretty good fight.” \nMillen might have felt some tension on the sideline. But she thought it was a good game from the spectators’ point of view. \n“Both teams worked really hard,” she said. “It was a fun game to watch.” \nTom Hinkel may be reached at thinkel@lehighvalleylive.com .
