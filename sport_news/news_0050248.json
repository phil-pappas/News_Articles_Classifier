One week before Halloween, the time-honored campfire story opener was no mere cliche long Sheridan Road, as the Waukegan Historical Society launched the first of two scheduled Ghost Tours of local sites with haunted legacies on a rainy Friday evening.\nWhen Ty Rohrer, curator at the Waukegan History Museum, stood in a steady drizzle before a collection of 25 ghost-seekers in Upton Park just after sunset, he had a simple review of the weather that greeted the inaugural event: \"This is awesome.\"\n\"It's my pleasure to do a little something different today,\" said Rohrer, forgoing the umbrellas held by everyone else in attendance. \"We are looking at a lot of stories passed down through the generations, I've found some information printed in the newspapers, and since I put this (tour) in the park district brochure, other stories that we're going to hear have come my way.\nFormer Jane McAlister Hospital Judy Fidkowski / Lake County News-Sun The ancestral Jane McAlister Hospital remains as an apartment building after closing in 1923 and then serving as a Shimer College.

(Judy Fidkowski / Lake County News-Sun) \"I'm figuring in future years, this is going to build and build and build,\" he added, saying with a smile that \"I'm sure the one question that many of you are wondering is, 'Are these stories real?' Well, I'll leave that up to you.\"\nThe first opportunity to make such a judgment came in Upton Park itself, which sits on Sheridan Road at the head of Genesee Street. Douglas House, which dates to 1853, serves as a park district office and has inspired its share of stories — employees who work there report an exterior door that opens and slams on its own late at night, and items vanish from where they were left only to turn up elsewhere.\nAs the rain picked up, the group headed south on Sheridan, stopping every block or so to share in Waukegan spectral tales both familiar and new:\nAt the corner of Sheridan and Franklin, Rohrer pointed west toward North Avenue, where the ancestral Jane McAlister Hospital remains as an apartment building after closing in 1923 and then serving as a Shimer College dormitory.\n\"Students that used the dormitory started to experience strange things,\" Rohrer said. \"They claimed there were two ghosts in that building. One they called the 'Good Nurse.' Any time someone was sick, the Good Nurse would come, tuck them in and put a cool hand on their feverish forehead to help take care of them. So they liked that ghost.\nResidents listen to Ty Rohrer Judy Fidkowski / Lake County News-Sun Residents gather at Upton Park in Waukegan on Friday night before the Ghost Tour.

They called him 'The Creepy Janitor.' (He) would only appear to women. They'd be down in the basement, feel someone breathing down the back of their neck, turn around and no one would be there. He would even trip them and try to push them down the steps, so the girls didn't like going down in that basement very often.\"\nAt 438 N. Sheridan, the 1845 home of railroad surveyor Robert Connelly, now a law office, has inspired such tales as a Shimer College student being so frightened by a cold presence and \"a menacing, shadowy figure\" in a hallway that she escaped through a window and sat on a second-floor ledge until classmates came to her aid.\nDown the block, the Peterson and Patch Funeral Home at 408 N. Sheridan also dates to the 19th century and, according to Rohrer, is said to occasionally be filled with phantom laughter from two long-lost young girls with tuberculosis who played in what was a solarium on an upper floor.\nAt the southeast corner of Sheridan and Washington Street, a metal-clad Victorian home known as The Gables was reputed to have been purposefully constructed on an old Native American burial mound in the 1890s by its eccentric owner, Dr. Norman J. Roberts. Rohrer said it was known by locals as \"Waukegan's haunted house\" before it was torn down in 1979, with teenagers daring each other to spend a night inside without being scared away by moving shadows and random noises like music from a spectral piano.\nAs the rain picked up and a cold wind turned umbrellas inside out, Rohrer pointed out toward Lake Michigan and recounted the 1868 sinking of the Seabird, which burned and sank in a gale and subsequently was claimed to have been seen from time to time, still burning offshore before disappearing.\nTy Rohrer of the Waukegan History Museum Judy Fidkowski / Lake County News-Sun Ty Rohrer of the Waukegan History Museum talks about Waukegan area Lake Michigan shipwrecks as he leads a tour highlighting haunted and strange stories of Waukegan's past in a walking tour on a rainy Friday night.

(Judy Fidkowski / Lake County News-Sun) All told, Friday night's crew covered more than two miles on foot over the course of two hours. A second tour was scheduled for much calmer weather on Saturday, and Rohrer said he hopes it will become an annual event that will invite the owners of older homes to come forward with tales to share.\n\"We're trying not to tell stories about private residences,\" he said. \"In the future I hope to, but for the first time around, we're not doing it. After everybody's comfortable with it and if others agree that it's OK and it's not going to hurt their property values, then we'll share other stories.\"\ndanmoran@tribpub.com\nTwitter @NewsSunDanMoran\nCopyright © 2015, Lake County News-Sun Waukegan Haunted Houses (attractions)", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-562d3225/turbine/ct-ct-lns-waukegan-ghost-tour-st-10-3-jpg-20151025", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-562d3100/turbine/ct-lns-waukegan-ghost-tour-st-1026-20151025", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-562d3224/turbine/ct-ct-lns-waukegan-ghost-tour-st-10-2-jpg-20151025", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-562d3225/turbine/ct-ct-lns-waukegan-ghost-tour-st-10-4-jpg-20151025"], "published": "2015-10-25T19:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T15:16:41.145+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
