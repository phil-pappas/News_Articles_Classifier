(AP Photo/Michel Euler) more > By SAMUEL PETREQUIN - Associated Press - Thursday, October 22, 2015 \nPARIS (AP) - After a frustrating European night at the Parc des Princes, Paris Saint-Germain returns to business as usual in a French league where the three-time defending champions have no rival. \nPSG’s ambition to win the Champions League might take a long time to be fulfilled, as Laurent Blanc’s players were reminded by a depleted Real Madrid side that still controlled the game in their 0-0 draw on Wednesday. \nBut in France, PSG is unstoppable. \nAfter 10 league games, PSG has already opened a 10-point gap over Lyon and leads surprise packages Angers and Caen by five points ahead of Sunday’s home game against Saint-Etienne. \nStruggling Marseille travels to Lille looking to end a five-match winless streak while Nice, the league’s best attacking team, is at Ajaccio. \nHere are some things to know ahead of this weekend’s matches. \n___ \nINFERIORITY COMPLEX? \nAmong all the reasons for PSG’s inability to shake off the injury-hit Madrid squad that traveled to the French capital, there is one frequently cited in the French media: the club’s lack of pedigree. \nAlthough PSG has already proved itself with prestigious wins over Barcelona and Chelsea since Qatari investors took over the club back in 2011 to build a star-studded team, there is always the sense that the French capital side does not belong to the European elite. \n“It’s always difficult to play against such a great team, we have lot of respect for them,” said Lucas Moura, while Serge Aurier did not hide his joy of taking part to “a prestigious match.” \nFor 10-time European champion Madrid, it was nothing more than a routine group match. \n“The aim for the club remains to win the Champions League, but you have to remember the project is only four years old,” PSG coach Laurent Blanc said. \n___", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T13:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T16:17:05.833+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
