Just ask his Fort Morgan Mustangs.\n\"He definitely let us know that he wasn't happy and we had to step it up,\" senior Tate Kembel said Saturday.\nAnd step it up they did — a 35-point second half fueled a 49-14 victory over host Vista PEAK at Aurora Public Schools Stadium to take command of the Colorado 7 League. Ranked No. 2 in the Class 3A Associated Press media poll, the Mustangs are 7-0 overall, 4-0 in league.\n\"This was good and kind of what we needed,\" Chisum said.\nThe Mustangs owned the line of scrimmage and piled up 437 yards of offense, including 412 yards rushing. Kembel, who ran for 234 yards, scored four TDs.\nColorado State-bound Toby McBride and sophomore Trey McBride headed the rugged play. \"I'm happy with how we did, and Vista PEAK played well,\" Chisum said.\nThe newer Bison did for a bit, but coach John Sullivan was hoping for more late. \"(The Mustangs) are a physical team. This was one of the first times our kids have been in a position to have a really meaningful game, and they wore us down,\" he said. \"They're the No. 2 team in the state for a reason.\"\nVista PEAK (4-3, 3-1) managed 267 yards, 183 passing by sophomore quarterback Derrick Smashum, but the Bison couldn't keep up. Their first possession ended on downs in its own territory, leading to Fort Morgan's first score.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T20:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T00:10:04.355+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
