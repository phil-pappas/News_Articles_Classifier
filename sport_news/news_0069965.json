She finished just off the podium at the 2014 Olympics and the last two world championships. It’s her goal this season to break through and win a medal at worlds, but once again, will face fierce competition from the loaded Russian and Japanese teams.\nShe starts her quest this weekend at Skate America in Milwaukee, her first stop in skating’s Grand Prix. Gold will take on Julia Lipnitskaya, who was a key part of Russia’s team gold in Sochi, and 2015 junior world champion Evgenia Medvedeva, also from Russia.\n“Any time you go to a high level competition, of course there are going to be great skaters there. I just assume that everyone is going to be amazing and skate perfectly, and I train to skate my best,” Gold said.\nGold’s season already has gotten off to a rough start, as she fell on her opening combination and took last place in the Japan Open earlier this month.\n“I kind of choked. I got nervous and didn’t rely on all of my training and hard work,” Gold said. \"I froze. I wanted to skate so well and show everyone how hard I had been working and everything that I ended up tripping over my own feet.”\nUSA TODAY\nRio could be reward for success at gym worlds\nThe key for Gold is a new free skate set to “Firebird,” familiar skating music she says she connects with much more than her long program set to “Wishing You Were Somehow Here Again” from “Phantom of the Opera” last season.\n“Last year I felt like my program didn’t fit me, and it wasn’t good for me. I didn’t really relate to it. I couldn’t connect to it. I feel like this program is really full of energy and full of life. I can perform it, and I want to perform it,” she said.\nGold will also compete with fellow American Karen Chen, who took bronze at the U.S. nationals last season in her first season as senior. At just 16, Chen is looking to build her experience.\nOn the men’s side, reigning U.S. champion Jason Brown is hoping to add more than a successful quad jump to his performances. In the past, Brown’s skates have been fun and crowd-pleasing, but showed off his youth. Now, with the Olympics and world championships under his belt, Brown wants to display more maturity on the ice.\n“For me, the maturity is related to confidence. Related to that I own what I’m doing. I’m here, and I’m going to rock what ever I’m doing, and staying confident in that,” Brown said.\nBrown landed a quad at the Nepela Trophy in September. He will need the jump to beat Skate America competitors Denis Ten, Kazakhstan's Olympic bronze medalist, and Japanese up-and-comer Shoma Uno.\nIn pairs, American champions Alexa Scimeca and Chris Knierim will compete against Russian Olympic silver medalists Ksenia Stolbova and Fedor Klimov. American ice dancers Madison Chock and Evan Bates will look to build on their most successful season yet, which included a silver medal at the world championships.\n5 CONNECT 33 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/10/23/USATODAY/USATODAY/635811906670767598-GTY-491113728-76436350.JPG", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/c449859bd2882314bf05729e3b9b9141c25f5050/c=0-909-1875-2784/local/-/media/2015/10/22/USATODAY/USATODAY/635811316494115353-XXX-KAROLYI-7331-76337230.JPG", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1LRAXId&text=Gracie%20Gold%20ready%20to%20show%20off%20new%20program%20at%20Skate%20America&via=usatoday", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/27f6664fb8ef48299f06ee96e2d6771613497b2a/c=170-0-2830-2000&r=x404&c=534x401/local/-/media/2015/10/23/USATODAY/USATODAY/635811906670767598-GTY-491113728-76436350.JPG", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/4044b1e7645488621f157de466cf1a990870caa2/r=500x333/local/-/media/2015/10/23/USATODAY/USATODAY/635811906670767598-GTY-491113728-76436350.JPG", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1LRAXId&mini=true"], "published": "2015-10-23T17:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T18:52:42.336+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
