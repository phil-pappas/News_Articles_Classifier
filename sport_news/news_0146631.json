Munford starts fast; rolls to win over Childersburg By LAVONTE YOUNG, Home sports editor Annistonstar.com MUNFORD -- Last week, the Munford High School football team got off to a slow start to the dismay of head coach Bill Smith. The Lions first-year head coach preached to his team this week about starting of fast, and it paid off as Munford scored 21 points in the first quarter points en route to a 47-21 win over county foe Childersburg on Friday night. “We feel good about the win tonight,” Smith said. “Childersburg has very talented skill players. No. 10 for them (Tylan Coleman) is a jitterbug; he has some moves on him. “I think Charles Smith had over 100 yards rushing at halftime. He is his biggest critic. I had to cheer him up because he always feels like he can do better. He was down on himself. “I believe our first-team defense gave up a goose egg tonight. I am pleased with our first-team offense and the way that they played. We will go to the drawing board and see what we did wrong or right and make adjustments. I am pleased with the win.” It only took Munford 14 seconds to get on the scoreboard in the first quarter. James Jenkins took the opening kickoff 84- yards for a touchdown to give Munford a 7-0 lead. “I am going to get on to James for taking 14 seconds to run 80 yards,” Smith said jokingly. “We have really been practicing hard on our special teams. We missed two extra points tonight. I think one of them was the snap and the other one was our kicker. We have to be flawless in special teams going forward if we are going to make a run at anything. “I am very pleased. We have two types of kick returns, and that was a wedge return; we executed it. “ Munford’s Darren Parker recovered a fumble on the Tigers’ second possession of the game at the Childersburg 5-yard line. Munford quarterback Avery Harris capitalized on the turnover a few plays later as he scored from 4 yards out to give Munford a 14-0 lead with 4:50 left in the first quarter. Harris finished with 123 yards in the air and 70 yards rushing with a touchdown. The Lions finished the first quarter just like they opened it -- with a big play. Harris connected with Tranas Patterson for a 46-yard touchdown to give Munford a 21-0 lead going to the second period. Munford (5-3, 3-2) continued to have its way on offense   The Lions put together a seven play, 80 yard drive for a touchdown. Smith capped off the drive with a touchdown run from 9 yards out to increase thelead to 28-0. Smith finished with 118 yards on 21 carries. His second score of the game came at the end of the first half. The senior running back capped off a 10- play, 59 yard drive with a 4-yard touchdown run to give the Lions a 34-0 lead going into halftime. In the third quarter, the Lions continued to roll. Backup quarterback Tanner Reeves found Tacorrie Russell wide open for a 41-yard touchdown to give the Lions a 41-0 lead. Childersburg (2-5, 1-3) made it respectable in the second half by scoring 21 unanswered points. Coleman was responsible all three scores. Coleman connected with Takairre Kenebrew for a 70-yard touchdown. After a Munford turnover, Coleman found Davondre Garrett for a 6-yard touchdown pass. The senior quarterback also scored on a 21-yard run late in the fourth quarter to make it 47-21. “We dug a hole quick and pretty much stayed in there all night,” Childersburg head coach Adam Fossett said. “We missed assignments ... we are not doing the things that we are supposed to be doing. “A lot of it has to do with youth, we have younger kids playing. Part of the growing process is growing pains. It was a tough loss. Munford had a great game plan and stuck with it. Any time you give up a touchdown 14 seconds into the game, it makes for a tough night.” Childersburg plays host to Leeds next Friday, while Munford travels to take on Holtville.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T07:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T08:50:18.206+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
