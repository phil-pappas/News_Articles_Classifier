With only one returning starter and juniors who played junior varsity last season, there was plenty of work to do to get the offense to jell. \nSix games into the season, they are varsity rookies no more. The Scarlets improved to 5-1 on the season with a solid 24-9 win over Pascack Hills to move closer to a North 2, Group 3 playoff berth. \n“These guys have just continued to improve every week,” RP coach Pete Kraljic said. “Our line coach, Dan Morris, has worked wonders with them, and they’re still getting better.” \nOne Scarlet player who will certainly second that is Elijah Carlos, who had a monster game. The senior piled up 235 yards rushing on 21 carries and found plenty of room to run right from the start. \nTaking the Wildcat snap to start the game, he went 65 yards for a touchdown on the second play of the game to give the Scarlets an early surge of adrenalin. \n“We were looking to see what they were going to do defensively,” Kraljic said. “We wanted to try to spot No. 2 [Nick Garcia] and run the other way. He’s a heck of a player and he’s all over the field.” \nPascack Hills (3-2) gambled early, going for it on fourth down inside their 40-yard line on each of its first three possessions. They missed on the first one, but got it back on downs and drove deep into RP territory before settling on a Mark Henni 25-yard field goal. \nThe Scarlets increased their lead to 14-3 with 1:29 left in the first half on a fourth-and-2 gamble. They went to the pass, with QB Alex Pratissoli finding Steve Orozco down the seam all alone for a 19-yard score. \n“[Garcia] was creeping up like a linebacker and they were playing run all the way,” Kraljic said. “It was a bit of a risk, but it paid off.” \nGarcia brought Hills to 14-9 on the first play of the second half, getting a seam inside and going 76 yards for the touchdown. The senior had 179 yards on 21 carries in the game.. \nRidgefield Park won the battle of the trenches on both sides, as they held the Cowboys to no gain or negative yardage on 11 plays. \nChandler Olivieri hit a 25-yard field goal midway through the third quarter to extend the Scarlets lead to 17-9, and Carlos ripped off a 70-yard touchdown run with 55 seconds left in the third quarter to close the scoring. \nHills got inside the red zone twice in the fourth quarter but were thwarted and Ridgefield Park got an all-important win. \n“There are five undefeated teams in our bracket,” Kraljic said of the North 2 Group 3 playoff chase. “There’s going to be a 6-2 team that’s not going to get in, and we certainly don’t want to be that team. Getting this win was a big boost, but there’s still a lot of work to do.” © 2015 North Jersey Media Group Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T07:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T00:19:48.727+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
