GM A.J. Preller said that a search for a new manager would begin immediately. \nThe Padres fired longtime manager Bud Black after a 32-33 start to the season, but Murphy, 56, guided them to a record of just 42-54 (Dave Roberts also managed one game). \nExpectations were high for the Padres after Preller, in his first months on the job, drastically remade the team's roster and took on payroll. In the end, though, they wound up 74-88 -- three games worse than in 2014. Thanks to Preller's gutting of the farm system and acquisition of decline-phase talents, whoever gets the managerial job inherits a team not well-positioned for near-term success. \n\nPat Murphy won't be back as Padres manager in 2016.
