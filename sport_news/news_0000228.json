Forget about their three state titles and 50-game win streak that ended in the 2013 state championship game.That’s what Cyclones first-year head coach Billy Dawson wants his team to do. The Greenwood Bulldogs are just another team — albeit it a very good one — and other teams can be beaten.“Greenwood does a really good job at what they do,” Dawson said. “Their process is established. Their coach has been there for, I think, 11 years. They’ve had a lot of success, and the process of their success is the same process that we are on right now.”Russellville (1-3, 0-1 7A/6A-Central Conference) very nearly defeated the Bryant Hornets — a team ranked by The Associated Press at No. 8 in the state — last week.The Cyclones scored 17 unanswered points and led 17-3 at halftime. The Hornets battled back, took the lead and then lost it, but an 87-yard kickoff return for a touchdown with 40 seconds left in the game doomed Russellville.Special teams are a concern, Dawson said. Last week’s loss to the Hornets marked two straight games the Cyclones surrendered a touchdown on a kickoff.“We thought we had that fixed after Pottsville,” Dawson said. “Hopefully, we have it fixed now. The one against Bryant is glaring because of when it happened. We have to do a better job of running our lanes. We have all the growing pains of a young team.”Injuries have also hindered the Cyclones. Russellville has cycled through three quarterbacks in four games. Quarterback Michael Mullen injured his wrist before the season began. Cale Fulsom left after the Rogers Heritage game with shoulder issues. Ryan Talley, who started against Bryant, left the game with an injury.“I thought Talley played really well,” Dawson said. “He was just a warrior. Then, he gets hurt and Michael comes in and goes 5-for-6 and played really well. I was proud of both those guys.”Fulsom, who threw for more than 150 yards against Rogers Heritage, should return by Friday. Dawson said Talley’s injury was minor, and Mullen is nearly fully recovered.“You never want kids to get hurt,” Dawson said. “But we have three kids at quarterback who have played big in big games. That’s a positive. You hate for it to happen that way, but the way it played out, all three of those kids will be better for it.”So who will get the start? Dawson said he wasn’t sure.“We will just have to see,” he said. “We will see how the week goes. All three are getting reps, so we will see who is ready to go and who gives us the best opportunity to win.”“Opportunity,” Dawson said, is all he’s asking for. If Russellville can create an opportunity to win, then they can eventually start claiming those opportunities.“We are knocking on the door,” Dawson said. “Sooner or later, we are going to kick it in.”Greenwood (4-0, 1-0) is currently ranked No. 6 in the state by The Associated Press. Handling them will be a job, Dawson said — but not an impossible one.“They are very good at quarterback,” he said. “They are very good on defensive line, and they are going to be sound everwhere. They are a very good football team, no question. To beat them, we have to be sound. They aren’t real flashy. They just go out and play. We have to tackle in space and keep them away from the big play.”  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T20:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T00:53:08.256+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
