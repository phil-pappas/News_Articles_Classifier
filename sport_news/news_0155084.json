However, this weeks opponent is just as challenging as the last. Oklahoma State comes to WVU sitting undefeated at 5-0. However, the Cowboys have lost two straight years at the hands of WVU, and the Mountaineers would love nothing more than to make it three in front of a homecoming crowd. The Cowboys are currently the only team in the country that ranks in the top 25 for both offense and defense. Offensively, OK State is led by sophomore quarterback Mason Rudolph. Although he is young, Rudolph is 7-1 in career starts, and has thrown for over 260 yards in each of those 8 starts. Rudolph also has a skilled receiving corps. The bottom line? This will be yet another test for the Mountaineer defense. Defensively, the Cowboys lead the nation in sacks and tackles for a loss. Considering WVU's passing game struggled against Oklahoma and their run game has shown up week-to-week, expect the Mountaineers to keep it on the ground for a majority of Saturday's game.
