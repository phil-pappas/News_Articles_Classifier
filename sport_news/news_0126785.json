It will show up on the field on Saturday. It doesn’t matter who we’re playing. We’ve got to focus on ourselves and fine-tune those things we need to improve.”\nBYU QB Tanner Mangum\nPROVO — With a winless FCS opponent coming up this week — Wagner is 0-6 on the season — BYU coach Bronco Mendenhall is working to help his team maintain focus.\n“I think the biggest challenge will be probably managing the external environment. Inside, our message will continue to be working on improving, which we think there’s plenty of room to improve,\" he explained. \"I don’t think the players will see, feel or acknowledge anything that’s different from us this week, but I know from the outside it won’t be presented as such. I think our players, like anyone, are impressionable, so it’ll be a different kind of challenge in having to show as much or more maturity as if maybe there was a ranked opponent coming in.\n“It's just a different kind of challenge,” Mendenhall continued. “And I’m sure the team from Wagner will do the very best they can and the kids will play hard and it’ll be a great opportunity for them to see if they can upset a team like us, but our focus is really just on how much we can improve and what else we can do to continue to gain momentum through our season.”\nIt would seem to make sense to sideline or limit freshman quarterback Tanner Mangum, who is still dealing with a hamstring injury. But that’s not in Mendenhall’s plans.\n“I think that we’ll all do the best we can to play the best game possible and the same would be for our quarterback,” he said. “We’ll make our decisions as the game goes based on how it goes, but I don’t intend to give him a play off, a day off, a week off. I intend to help him get better if possible. And then we’ll just manage the game as we see it.”\nMangum, who said Monday he was about 70 percent healthy in last Friday’s 38-24 victory over Cincinnati, is taking more reps this week in practice than he did last week.\n“This week comes down to us focusing, day in and day out and not looking past anyone,” Mangum said. “We’ve got to better ourselves and improving every day. It will show up on the field on Saturday. It doesn’t matter who we’re playing. We’ve got to focus on ourselves and fine-tune those things we need to improve. That way, come game-time, we’ll be able to show that.”\nBYU will have a bye after playing Wagner, which will be followed by a pair of road games at San Jose State and against Missouri at Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City.\n“Every team is going to play us as hard as possible,” said BYU center Tejan Koroma. “We’ve got to look at this game (against Wagner) as another to get better, another opportunity to get ready for future opponents.”\nHow will Mendenhall measure his team’s improvement this week?\n“Usually by what I see daily — execution-wise in practice, what I see mindset-wise, what I see in terms of work ethic and consistency, and usually that manifests on Saturday, not all the time, but usually,” he said. “But really I notice it more not just as a one day thing, but just as a weekly progression. That’s where I find the most solace. Our (staff) meetings are the same, our mindset is the same, everything’s the same. It’s just the next opponent.”\nEMAIL: jeffc@deseretnews.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T20:24:41.601+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
