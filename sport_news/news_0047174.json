And in the Champions League you have to be perfect. We weren't,\" said Guardiola after their Arsenal defeat. \nBut Bayern chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge had a different spin. \n\"Actually nothing dramatic has happened. We're still top of the table,\" he said. \n\"It is important that the players show the right reaction immediately and continue their winning streak. \n\"I recommend that you just keep it up against Cologne, it could be a record that stands for all time.\" \nGuardiola hopes to have wingers Douglas Costa, Kingsley Coman and Arjen Robben available to face Cologne. \nCosta played against Arsenal, Coman was on the bench after a thigh strain and Robben is set to return from a groin strain having trained with the reserves at the start of the week. \nSecond-placed Borussia Dortmund host bottom side Augsburg on Sunday in the battle of Germany's Europa League teams with the hosts' star-studded attack looking to add to their impressive goal tally. \nOnly Bayern have scored more goals (29) than Dortmund (24) so far this term. \nGabon striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang failed to score in last Friday's 2-0 win over Mainz, the first time he has failed to hit the net in nine league matches so far this season having claimed ten Bundesliga goals. \nThere will be a fascinating battle at Borussia Park also on Sunday when hosts Moenchengladbach take on third-placed Schalke. \nGladbach's 10th place in the table disguises their impressive recent form having won all four Bundesliga matches under caretaker coach Andre Schubert since Lucien Favre resigned last month. \nTheir run includes a 2-0 home win over Wolfsburg and a 5-1 routing of Eintracht Frankfurt away last weekend. \nBayer Leverkusen are home to Stuttgart on Saturday with the visitors having only escaped the bottom three last weekend. \nRoger Schmidt's Leverkusen are eager to learn the lesson from their 4-4 draw with Roma in the Champions League on Tuesday. \nBayer took an early 2-0 lead when Leverkusen's Mexico striker Javier Hernandez scored twice, only for the hosts to ship four goals before scoring twice in the final ten minutes to rescue a point. \n\"We need to look at what we did well in this game so that we can do the same (in Stuttgart), but we also need to improve,\" said Hernandez. \n\"We can't afford to throw a lead like that away again and concede so many goals. \n\"Sometimes, though, football is like that and that's why I love it.\" SHARE", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T19:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T21:35:31.117+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
