Utah is 5-0 for the first time since 2010. \nThis week on the show we'll revisit the Utes win over Cal, look ahead to Utah's game against Arizona State and even take a look back at a classic featuring Alex Smith and Aaron Rodgers in 2003. \n\n— a Top 25 matchup featuring two players in the Heisman Trophy race, Utah's Devontae Booker and Cal's Jared Goff. \nIf that didn't create enough hype, ESPN's College Football GameDay came to town as well. The good news is that the game lived up to the hype. \n\ne Utes forced six turnovers, including five interceptions against one of the best quarterbacks in the country. Hans Olsen and former Ute Christian Cox from 1280 the Zone break down how the Utes were able to do it. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n&M. \n\nHERE or hit us up on Twitter, @JJSportsBeat and @RoJackKSL. \nJeremiah Jensen, Josh Furlong Robert Jackson", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T02:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T02:18:25.290+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
