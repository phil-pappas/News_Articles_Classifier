The two men responsible pled guilty to the charges, and were sent to federal prison. Stow sued the team at the time, and was awarded $18 million in damages.\nA lack of security evidently remains an issue, however, as this recent incident shows. This particular case is reportedly being handled by LAPD's elite robbery-homicide division, which means that local authorities are beginning to take situations like these extremely seriously. What would be nice, though, is if these incidents would simply cease to exist.\nThe investigation is focused on reviewing surveillance video and interviewing potential witnesses in hopes of identifying all parties involved.\nSend all complaints, compliments, and tips to sportstips@complex.com", "external_links": ["http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-dodger-stadium-fight-20151012-story.html"], "published": "2015-10-13T17:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T18:20:30.603+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
