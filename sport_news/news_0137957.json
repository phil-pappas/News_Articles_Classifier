Opening night indeed was a culture shock. \n“It was really cool ... even bigger than I imagined it would be when I decided to come here,” said Lensker, who is from Nordhorn, near the border with the Netherlands in northwest Germany. “A football game is such a big event here. It seemed like everyone from the school and town was there.”\n\nBerlin, who hails from the village of Schinne in north-central Germany, noted that Europe has no high-school athletics and that club sporting events are sparsely attended.\n\n“There’s a completely different feeling at an American football game,” Berlin said. “The people get so excited. Everyone is so serious. I knew I wasn’t going to get to play, but I was still nervous. When I get back home, I want to get people more interested in this game.”\n\nThe 15-year-old sophomores are in uniform for varsity games but play on Saturday mornings on the junior-varsity team. Lensker is a receiver and kicker. Berlin plays offensive line.\n\nOddly enough, the Germans did not know each other previously and came to America via different exchange programs. They live with separate host families.\n\n“I got an email from a host parent in May indicating that a young man from Germany wanted to give football a try and I thought it would be a fun experience for him and for the players and ,coaches as well,” Thomas Worthington coach Rodney Hopkins said. \n\n“I got a similar email in June, and after I hit reply, it occurred to me that a different person had sent it. So in two-a-days, we’ve got two German kids who have never played football before.”\n\nLensker had competed in soccer, tennis and swimming. Berlin’s background is in track. Both are considering playing other sports at Thomas Worthington during their stay. Their only previous exposure to football had been watching the Super Bowl. Neither had a rooting interest, but they were taken by the grandiosity of the event.\n\n“In my region of the country, there’s no football anywhere, except what you call soccer,” Berlin said. “A lot of people think of it as very rough. Of course, accidents will happen. But I don’t find that to be a problem. Everyone tries to be safe. My mother, though, she still worries about me playing.”\n\nThe differences between soccer and football have perplexed Lensker, who, according to Hopkins, has made great improvement in his footwork and ball-catching skills.\n\n“Football is so much more complicated than it looks on TV,” he said. “There is much more strategy involved. In soccer, you just react. There are so many signals to learn in football … and so many players on the field. It gets difficult to follow sometimes.”\n\nHopkins said working with Lensker and Berlin has been a breath of fresh air for the coaching staff.\n\n“It reminds us what teaching the sport at the basic level is all about and we all need a dose of that from time to time,” he said.\n\n“My first concern was to make sure that they could protect themselves not only in games but in practice situations. Your worst nightmare is something happening to these boys who are over here to learn the game. Secondly, we wanted them to feel just like all the other guys. We got them garage signs and the whole bit. We want to send them home with some gear to remember us by. The rest of the players have really taken to them. It’s been an awesome experience for everyone involved.”\n\nThomas Worthington senior offensive lineman Liam Buchy said the players have gained much from the German visitors.\n\n“We go to dinner together every Thursday night and we talk a lot about the differences in our countries,” he said. “They came here to learn about us and our game, but it’s been just as educational for us.\n\n“From a football perspective, I work closely with Marten. He had absolutely no idea what was going on at first, but he can hold his own out there now. And Eric, I think he could be a pretty good player if he got some more time to work at it. He’s contributing on the JV team.”\n\nBeing thousands of miles away from home, one would expect the foreign students to lean on each other for support, but that isn’t the case. They don’t want to be tempted to speak German during their stay, they explained, and hanging around together would offer that temptation.\n\nBesides, as Lensker pointed out, “One of the main reasons we came to America was to meet new people and experience new things, and football was an opportunity to do that.” \n\n@BlackiePreps", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T01:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T06:14:51.322+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
