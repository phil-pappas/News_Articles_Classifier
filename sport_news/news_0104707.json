He might lead the league in eye rolls and smirks, and isn’t one to give a Pernell McPhee-style pep talk.\nStill, his very presence on the sideline Sunday — two weeks after suffering a hamstring injury that was supposed to keep him out longer — speaks to his leadership most of all.\nIt was Cutler in a nutshell. Yes, he was hurt doing chasing a defender after throwing a dumb interception against the Cardinals. But his rapid recovery — much less his 28-of-43 performance for 281 yards, two scores, and, yes, the all-too-common fourth-quarter interception — buoyed those at Halas Hall.\n“I think I’ve said many times, I’ve been very impressed with him in our tenure here,” coach John Fox said Monday. “I think I speak for all the offensive coaches, or just coaches and staff in general. …\n“The mental and physical toughness it takes to speed something like that up, deal with it, go out and perform like he did under that duress—forget about the duress of just playing NFL football—but to have maybe not 100 percent body with you, I think is pretty admirable.”\nHis teammates marveled at the return.\n“Because he’s a beast,” guard-turned-emergency center Matt Slauson said. “I don’t know what it is, I just know he works his tail off.\n“The couple times he’s been hurt, the amount of work he puts in to get back it’s just constant. It’s a testament to what a great pro he is.”\nHe’s done it before. When Cutler tore his left groin Oct. 20, 2013, against the Redskins, then-coach Marc Trestman said doctors told him it was “a legitimate four-week injury.”\nHe missed one full game, benefiting from the Bears’ bye, and returned 21 days later.\nThen, and in the past two weeks, Cutler returned so with the help of an ARPWave machine, which breaks down scar tissue to encourage blood flow to the area. It’s a painful process, but one Cutler fights through.\n“Having him in there, we’re just so confident because he’s our guy,” Slauson said. “We have full belief in him.\n“I mean, he played lights out (Sunday) and we know that he can do that every week, so when he’s in there it just juices us all up.”\nIn a Bears season haunted by soft-tissue damage, Cutler’s recovery time is a skill in itself. But coach John Fox was hesitant to compare it to wide receiver Alshon Jeffery’s hamstring strain — or, before then, mild calf strain — or cornerback Tracy Porter’s hamstring injury, which cost him all but five snaps before starting Sunday.\n“It’s why I don’t give timelines, because everybody’s different,” Fox said. “I think he’s probably a little bit different with a hamstring injury as a quarterback than it is as a corner or wide receiver. Not slighting it by any stretch.\n“And it says a lot about him. I think you obviously have to get a lot of treatment, spend a lot of work, spend a lot of time.\n“And it’s a lot mental, as well.”\nEmotional, too.\n“I’ve just been so surprised of how hard of a worker he is,” said outside linebacker Sam Acho, who signed a one-year deal in the offseason. “How much he cares and how passionate he is about being great.” .\nIt showed Sunday, he said.\n“I’ve only been here a couple months, so I’m still getting to know a lot of guys on the team,” Acho said. “But just to see that last drive, how can you not like that?”\nFollow me on Twitter @patrickfinley\nEmail: pfinley@suntimes.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T00:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T19:47:05.012+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
