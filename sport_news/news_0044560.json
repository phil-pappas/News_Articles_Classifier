The four-year starter at Sturgis High School dropped back, flung a pass to Joe Srebernak for 10 yards and picked up a new set of downs on his first pass as a starting college quarterback. He went on to have a pretty good day as well, but you wouldn’t know it talking with him after the game. Saturday was Parent’s Day at Hillsdale College and the Chargers put up a solid fight, but fell to visiting Ohio Dominican 34-29. “I didn’t make enough plays today,” he said as parents, fans and working personnel left Frank “Muddy” Waters Stadium Saturday afternoon. “We’ve got to go back and watch film, learn from our mistakes and get better next week.” Stewart led the Chargers on six scoring drives on the day, but in the end Hillsdale came up just a bit short. The Chargers started the season at 1-4 before making the move to Stewart as the starter and they threw it more than they had all season with 40 attempts on Saturday. The most memorable of those attempts will be his first touchdown, a 90-yard pitch and catch to Alex Fogt out of the backfield. Often known as the “wheel route,” Fogt came out of the backfield, got matched up against a slower defender and Stewart hit him in stride down the sidelines for the first TD toss of his career. “A 90-yard touchdown pass for my first career touchdown was pretty cool,” Stewart said, also mentioning his first pass in high school was a 97-yarder to Dan Scheske. “Fogt made a great play and out-ran the guy. I wasn’t sure he would be able to out-run him but he made a great play.” At one point in the third quarter Stewart was pressured on third and long but he didn’t tuck the football, he just flipped it parallel to Wade Wood, who picked up a first down to continue the drive. He has done a lot of growing up during his time in college and he ran the football several times, including some big runs in the second half for first downs. Stewart finished the day 19-of-40 for 294 yards and two TDs. He also ran the football seven times for 26 yards. He got decked a few times by interior lineman and linebackers as well. In college defensive coaches certainly like to blitz quarterbacks, especially young ones making their first start. Stewart stood tall and tough the entire game, though, taking shots when they happened and continuing to get back up again. “Honestly, I wanted to get hit, after two years I needed to get hit to know that I could stand back up and continue playing,” he said. “It’s been a journey the last two years, a very interesting one, with a lot of ups and downs but when I found out I got the starting job I called my dad, called my mom and that was a great moment. Getting hit and playing hard were just part of the game and I knew I could take it.” Page 2 of 2 - Charger head coach Keith Otterbein said he is going to take a look at the game film before committing to a starter next week, but he did see some positives from Stewart. “We’re going to look at some film, as much as our quarterback has to make decisions to get us into the right plays, he’s also got to make decisions to get us out of bad plays,” Otterbein said. “It’s a combination of those two things that comes with learning the offense more and more.” He never saw time on the field as a redshirt last year at Western Michigan University but the time there certainly galvanized him as a highly-ranked recruit looking to earn his time. While some might have questioned his decision to transfer, Stewart just wanted to help his team win football games. Hillsdale offered him that opportunity and he earned the starting spot after finally learning the playbook. And even though they lost, Stewart looked positive for the Chargers. Those in attendance Saturday saw the reasons Stewart was ranked the way he was as a high school recruit. Stewart looked flustered at times, yes, because the Ohio Dominican defense brought pressure quite a bit. That was to be expected. After all, he was making his first start in college. “He moved the offense and our guys responded well to him,” Otterbein said. “He did some positive things with his feet. Those are the things on the surface that are certainly attractive.” Stewart said he saw a lot of positive things on the field today, but like all quarterbacks looking to make the team better, he also saw some negatives. “There were some negative things that we can improve on,” he said. “We’ve got to find those negatives on film and improve and gain some confidence going into next week.” Stewart is looking to become a leader for the Charger program. In his first start, he led the team down the field several times and almost took them to a win. Still, only a couple of months in and one start under his belt, Stewart is focused on getting better and taking nothing for granted. “I need to just keep leading the guys, I thought we came out today with a chip on our shoulder,” he said. “I’ve got to keep leading, I’ve got to keep building chemistry with these guys. I’ve only been here two months, so we’re looking to keep building relationships and performing well in the future.” Hillsdale plays at Ashland University next weekend.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T02:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T09:43:01.240+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
