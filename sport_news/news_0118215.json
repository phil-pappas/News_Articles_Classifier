After a heartbreaking non-region slate, the Warriors have turned the tide in Region 4 , beating the Hawks to take a half-game lead over McEachern. Special photo by Anthony Stalcup KENNESAW — In each of its first three games, North Cobb saw potential victories slip away in the fourth quarter.Now, the Warriors are securing victories in the fourth quarter.Clinging to a six-point lead over Hillgrove in a pivotal Region 4 game Friday night, the Warriors stepped up with a 94-yard touchdown drive to give them separation in a 19-7 victory at Emory Sewell Stadium.The win, coupled with North Paulding’s loss to Harrison, allowed North Cobb (3-3, 2-0) to take a half-game region lead over McEachern — its opponent next week in Powder Springs.North Cobb’s defense held Hillgrove to just 29 rushing yards.“Early on in the season, we weren’t finishing in the fourth quarter and we had 11-point leads in two games and we were a young football team,” North Cobb coach Shane Queen said. “I kept preaching to the kids to believe in our system and don’t go off the path. A missed extra point in the first half didn’t make North Cobb’s 13-7 third quarter lead comfortable. Hillgrove (3-3, 1-1) threatened late in the quarter and appeared to score to tie it when Hunter Arters threw a 17-yard touchdown pass to Jeremiah Bridges, but the play was negated for an illegal receiver down field.Afterwards, North Cobb’s defense stepped up. Two plays later, Gilbert Blow broke up what looked to be another touchdown catch by Bridges before Larry Bryant sacked Arters for an 11-yard loss that put the Hawks out of field-goal range and forced them to punt as the third quarter came to a close.North Cobb (3-3, 2-0) were pinned on its own 4-yard line on a third-and-12 during the opening minute of the fourth quarter, but quarterback Will Lovett got the Warriors out of trouble with his longest completion of the game — a 48-yard pass to D.J. Render, who was running down the left sideline.“Before, I told D.J., ‘You need to make a play,’ and he made a play to keep the ball moving,” Lovett said. Lovett’s connection with Render opened up North Cobb’s running game, and C.J. Cole punched it in from 21 yards out seven plays later to end a drive that lasted nearly 5 minutes and helped the Warriors open up their lead.North Cobb’s defense then held Hillgrove to a three-and-out before giving the Hawks a heavy dose of Cole and Jai Irwin, who rushed for 109 yards on 28 carries. Although the drive stalled on the Hillgrove 4, the Warriors managed to chew an additional 4 minutes of clock.The Hawks got the ball back, but only 2 minutes remained, and they had just made it into North Cobb territory when time expired.“I was so proud of our offense executing in the fourth quarter, running the clock out,” Queen said. “And the defense was coming up with big play after big play. Holding them to seven points, that’s phenomenal.” Matt Wilson started the game for Hillgrove at quarterback, but he struggled to move the chains and was replaced by Arters in the second quarter. Arters was 13-of-29 for 204 yards, highlighted by a 39-yard touchdown to Bridges in the second quarter.Cole scored on a 2-yard run in the first quarter to put North Cobb on the board, and Quannie Green added to the lead in the second quarter with a 45-yard touchdown on a sweep to the left side.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T10:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T09:51:57.939+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
