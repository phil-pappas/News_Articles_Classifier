We should not forget history. Today migration has become a global phenomenon. Germany has opened up its border to migrants. We have to take lessons from the fact that our country was divided on religious lines,\" Deka said.\nHe added that vested interest groups are up in arms to create unrest in the state in the name of centre's notification.\nIndicating that migration of religious minorities from Bangladesh is not a threat to the state, Deka said he is confident Assam's culture, identity and language will not be endangered.\n\"Today state's Muslim comprise 34 per cent of the total population. Of this 3 to 4 per cent are indigenous Muslims. We have to maintain Assam as Hindu majority state,\" Deka said.\nThe BJP MP from Mangalgoi constituency has also launched a tirade against the Congress government, alleging that the administration has failed to find out the culprits involved in throwing beef in temple premises in different parts of the state.\n\"The present government is to be blamed for the communal tension,\" Deka alleged.\nDeka also took a potshot at former chief minister Prafulla Kumar Mahanta, one of the signatories of Assam Accord, of miserably failing to solve the problem of infiltration during his tenure.
