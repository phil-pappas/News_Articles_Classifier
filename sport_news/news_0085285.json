That distinction went to Todd Richards, whom the Blue Jackets dismissed on Wednesday in the wake of an 0-7-0 start. Julien now hopes Richards beats a system that could lead to fired coaches going unhired, because prospective employers may not want to give up the draft-pick compensation that teams are entitled to seek when their terminated employee still has time left on his contract. \"As a coach, I would find it a shame that I wouldn't be able to get a job somewhere because the compensation was too high,\" said Julien, who was fired by the Canadiens and Devils before the Bruins hired him (in the pre-compensation era) on June 21, 2007. \"(A new team) thought enough of me that they would be willing to hire me, but they wouldn't be willing to for a second- or third-round draft pick?\" Fired coaches aren't the only ones subject to draft-pick compensation; front-office executives can also come at a price to teams that want to hire them. The Bruins, in fact, are awaiting a second-round choice from the Oilers as compensation for their hiring general manager Peter Chiarelli, who had time remaining on his contract when the Bruins fired him in April. Julien, who is under the impression that the NHL is going to reexamine its current compensation policy, said \"to me, once you're fired, you're fired … You shouldn't be held back from working anywhere because of compensation.\" While understanding the potential value of draft picks, Julien thinks it should be enough that once a fired coach is hired by another team, the coach's salary comes off the firing team's payroll. \"(Coaches) want to get back and work again,\" Julien said, \"and … I think it's a benefit to the team that fired you, because they don't have to keep paying you for doing nothing.\" Julien, signed to an extension last season by Chiarelli, is believed to be under contract to the Bruins through 2017-18. He hopes to honor it, but knows many doubt he will. \"Even though my name comes up a lot,\" Julien smiled, \"I'm still not worried about that.\" Rinaldo provides tips Left wing Zac Rinaldo, acquired June 29 for a third-round pick in the 2017 draft, was excited to face his former team for the first time, and more than willing to share information that would help his new team beat his old one. \"I talked to some (Bruins) about different scenarios,\" said Rinaldo, who played 223 games for the Flyers over parts of four seasons, compiling 24 points (8 goals, 16 assists), 572 penalty minutes, multiple NHL suspensions and a reputation as one of the league's more notorious pests. \"I gave them the word, gave them what I thought.\" Rinaldo may have had the inside scoop on various Flyers, but not much on the team's system under Dave Hakstol, the first-year head coach who spent the previous 11 seasons as head coach at the University of North Dakota. Hakstol replaced Craig Berube, the second coach Rinaldo played under in Philadelphia. Peter Laviolette was the other. Rinaldo didn`t expect any former teammates to try to stir him up. \"No,\" he said. \"They know better.\" Seidenberg still four weeks out Defenseman Dennis Seidenberg, who had back surgery on Sept. 24, started skating on his own on Monday, but is still only four weeks into a projected eight-week recovery. \"He's back on the ice,\" Julien said, \"but still not close to returning, obviously.\" … Max Talbot, another former Flyer, would have moved back into the lineup had both Patrice Bergeron and Matt Beleskey (upper body) missed the game, but was instead a healthy scratch for the third straight game and fourth time in six games this season … Defenseman Zach Trotman was scratched for the fifth straight game.
