Center. \"We know that, and around the league, players know that. That's why the game was selected.\"\nHarris ultimately signed with Tennessee and former coach Bruce Pearl, starring for the Volunteers for one season before entering the NBA draft. Selected 19th by the Bobcats and traded to the Bucks, Harris, it seems, has found a long-term home with the Magic.\nThe 6-foot-9 forward signed a four-year, $64 million deal in the offseason to continue heading up a roster that includes former Indiana star Victor Oladipo. The Heat, the designated home team Wednesday, will bring with them names such as Dwyane Wade, Chris Bosh and Amar'e Stoudemire.\n\"I think overall it's going to be a fun experience,\" Harris said. \"Louisville fans can see a different type of basketball. Fans that love the game and respect the game will like what we have to show them here.\"\nHarris will be a big part of that. Since moving to Orlando, he has averaged double-figure scoring and last season started 63 of 68 games in which he appeared.\nThe New York native previously dealt with a dilemma familiar to U of L and UK fans – whether to enter the draft after one college season.\n\"I think I made the right choice,\" Harris said in hindsight. \"I think the decision really came from timing, seeing my draft position where I was likely to go and my own confidence in my game, knowing I could be a good player in the NBA.\"\nHarris values the college game plenty. His younger brother, Tyler, recently transferred to Auburn, where he'll play a final season for Pearl, who in 2009 lured the five-star prospect Harris away from the Cards and Cats.\nNow he'll play in the Yum! Center after all.\nIt's uncommon that NBA clubs meet outside of both teams' home arena, even during the preseason. But for the second straight year, the Heat are returning to town with their home AmericanAirlines Arena – as with the Yum! Center – operated by AEG.\n\"It's a great connection we have with our general manager and AEG,\" said Robbie Valentine, the Yum! Center's director of premium sales and services. \"There's also a relationship we have now with the Miami Heat. ...The gain for them is it gives them an opportunity to get into a beautiful venue in basketball country.\"\nIt's only one game and only the second NBA contest in Louisville since 1996. But last year's exhibition between the Heat and New Orleans Pelicans drew an announced crowd of 20,074 thanks to returns by U of L's Russ Smith and UK's Anthony Davis. The Pelicans and Sacramento Kings, with a trio of former Wildcats, also play later this month at Rupp Arena in Lexington.\nNext-level basketball interest in Kentucky is real.\n\"I know we're all excited,\" Harris said. \"We know about Louisville and how they have fans that love basketball. It will be a different kind of atmosphere – fun time all around. We've heard a lot about the Yum! Center and how nice it is. We're just excited to play a game there.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T00:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T08:07:27.022+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
