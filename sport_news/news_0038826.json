The Cats have a critical NJIC Meadowlands Division game this weekend at Saddle Brook which also has only one loss. \nNorth Arlington (2-3) gave the NJIC Meadowlands Division leading Park Ridge team all it could handle but dropped a 28-24 decision on Friday night. \nFriday, Oct. 9 \nLyndhurst 30, Garfield 21 \nLyndhurst has in the past stayed with most of the teams on their schedule but would always fall apart in the second half. This time the Golden Bears were down only 21-17 at the half against Garfield and took control in the second half. Lyndhurst quarterback Peter Guerriero had another big game as the Bears hope the win will turn around their season. Guerriero ran for 314 yards and three touchdowns including an 85-yard run in the third quarter. The senior signal caller became the first player in New Jersey to surpass a thousand yards in rushing this season. But it was the Lyndhurst defense led by Matt DeMarco that was the difference. DeMarco contained Garfield's All NJIC first team quarterback, Alex Victorino, all night and kept him off the scoreboard. \"We just kept putting pressure in his face all game,\" said Lyndhurst head coach Rich Tuero who added about DeMarco who led the team in tackles with 15. \"He (DeMarco) is just so good on defense. We literally contained him (Victorino) in the pocket all game. This was a tremendous win and incredible atmosphere.\" \nBecton 10, Cresskill 6 \nBecton lost a tough battle to Cresskill last season as Cougars kicker Matt Ferrara kicked the game-winning field goal in a 9-7 verdict. Ferrara has graduated but Cresskill still has a kicking game. This time though the Wildcats would get the best of the special teams. Wildcats kicker James Loremkian hit a 16-yard field goal in the second quarter and then Gianni Failla blocked a Cresskill Field goal in the second quarter. Failla's brother Nico would pick up the ball and run it back 65 yards. Wildcats quarterback Michael Bolwell would hit wide receiver Seven Strong on a 25-yard touchdown pass that would give Becton a 10-0 lead heading into the second half. Cresskill would come back in the second half with a Jack Maltby six-yard touchdown run, but the Becton defense was dominant. \nPark Ridge 38, North Arlington 34 \nNorth Arlington almost picked off Park Ridge, but could not get passed the Owls. It was a back-and-forth contest. Vikings quarterback Michael Manzo-Lewis had four rushing touchdowns to lead North Arlington. Joe Morales added another score. The Vikings cut the score to 38-34 after a one-yard run from Manzo-Lewis, and then Allan Ford scored on a two-point conversion. North Arlington though could not get the score to pull off the upset. \nSaturday, Oct. 10 \nSt. Mary 35, Weehawken 6 \nSt. Mary didn't wait to get going this week as the Gaels scored 28 points in the first half to take a 28-6 lead and walked away in the second half in Weehawken. St. Mary senior running back Derius Stone had a big game with four rushing touchdowns including a 72-yard rumble in the first quarter. \nQueen of Peace 30, Bogota 14 \nQueen of Peace was able to pull away from Bogota and win its first game of the season. Golden Griffins quarterback Derick Suazo threw for three touchdowns and 165 yards in the air. Junior Gregory Barnes, who was converted from a wide receiver to running back, had a break out game with 105 yards on the ground and two touchdowns. After taking a 12-6 lead at halftime, the Golden Griffins pulled away in the third quarter with 18 points. \nRutherford 49, Manchester 14 \nRutherford broke out in the third quarter with 28 points to finally put away an upstart Manchester team. The Bulldogs were ahead only 21-14 at halftime, and head coach Andrew Howell opted to bring back Sebastian Medina, the spark plug on the offense and defense for the second half after he sat the first half with an injury. \"We wanted to sit him (Medina) for the game, but we needed him,\" said Howell about the junior running back/linebacker. \"He (Medina) gets the team going.\" Rutherford quarterback Nick Birchby had a big game completing 8 of 14 passes for 159 yards and three touchdown passes including two to Laris Mulic. Kevin Kosakowski and Billy Fin had two touchdown runs each. Kosakowski surpassed the century mark for the game with 13 carries for 127 yards. Tom Reid led the Bulldogs defense with 12 tackles and two fumble recoveries. \nFootball Preview Â© 2015 North Jersey Media Group Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T19:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T05:41:30.930+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
