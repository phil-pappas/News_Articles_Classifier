It's going to take a combination of luck and my players playing their best game.\"\nSpellman's players haven't been at their best the past two weeks. Spellman has lost four of its past six, and Crane chalked the lull up to \"spring fever\" as some of his upperclassmen have been preoccupied with final exams, SATs and preparing for the prom.\nSenior center fielder Kasey Grisanti said the Falcons can bounce back; they just need to renew their focus.\n\"If we have our heads in the game, then no one can beat us,\" said Grisanti, who's hitting .330.\nThe Falcons (10-7, 7-4 Bronx/Westchester) appeared to be on the verge of breaking out of their slump in the regular-season finale against Preston last Friday. They scored four runs against their division rival in the bottom of the first, but the game was called due to rain and rescheduled for Monday afternoon; the winner would take the Bronx/Westchester Division title.\nSpellman will travel to Staten Island on Wednesday to play a yet-to-determined opponent in the first round of the interdiocesan playoffs. The Falcons have reached the semifinal the past three seasons, and senior second baseman Victoria Galasso, who leads the team with a .520 average and 29 stolen bases, is hungry to reach the next round.\n\"It's so important to make it,\" said Galasso, who has received an academic scholarship at Boston College and hopes to walk on with the Eagles. \"After four years, I really want to seal the deal and win the title.\"\nHow far the Falcons advance depends largely on how much Varela can pitch. Crane called Varela one of the most talented second baseman in the city, though the coach lamented the fact that he'd had to use her so much on the mound.\nValera is 11-3 and has started 14 of the Falcons' 17 games.\n\"She's not really a pitcher, but she's great for us,\" Grisanti said. \"She goes out there with a lot of heart and carries us.\"\nCrane knows Valera is the key. She's pulled her teammates together and helped the coach to forget the loss of Pino.\nWhatever happens in the playoffs, the coach is proud of her performance this spring.\n\"She sacrificed playing second base just to pitch for the team,\" Crane said. \"We would not be where we are without her.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T11:43:33.846+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
