It rolled hard around the right rim of the cup and boomeranged out. Kirk had won the match. \n\nA fraction softer and it would have dropped. A smidgen to the left and it would have disappeared. Fine margins indeed. \n\n\"These things are scripted I guess, and I wasn't in the script this time,\" said a despondent Lahiri. \n\n\"I made a good stroke. But I did what I've done all week, misread putts. Went left to right. Spat it out.\" \n\nKirk didn't quite know what to do. \n\n\"I just said sorry, basically,\" said the American. \n\n\"I didn't really know what to say. You don't ever really want to win a match like that.\" \n\nInstead of a 15-15 tie, the US went on to win 15.5-14.5, but no one was blaming Lahiri who \"hit a great putt\", according to his International team captain Nick Price. \n\n\"I said to Anirban that he may never have a putt that he'll be that nervous over, but he hit a great putt,\" said Price. \n\n\"It was just a little unlucky. Probably 95 times out of 100, that putt would have gone in.\" \n\nKirk said he felt for his \"good friend\" Lahiri. \n\n\"Anirban is as nice and as classy of a guy as you'll see out on tour. I feel like we're pretty good friends and I'll always pull for him. I hated to see him miss that putt.\" \n\nLocal hero Bae Sang-Moon, also on debut, had a chance to grab a share of the trophy by winning the 18th hole in the final match against Bill Haas for a half point. \n\nOne down for all of the back nine, Bae time again sank putts to keep the match alive. But it was his wedge that let him down at the vital moment. \n\nWith unbearable tension he fluffed a chip and watched in horror it stopped short on the fringe and rolled back to his feet. \n\nHe needed to hole his second attempt and although this time it found the putting surface, Haas was six feet away with two putts for the match and the US celebrations could begin as Bae conceded. \n\n\"I was pretty nervous. That's why I hit that really bad chip,\" said Bae. \n\nIt was his final stroke as a professional before heading into the South Korean military for 21 months compulsory service. \n\n\"Anirban and Moon (Bae) were in very difficult predicaments today, which I don't think they have ever felt before,\" said Price. \n\n\"But it's all part of the experience. Today is a day they will never forget, but I hope that they use it in a positive way to take the next step. \n\n\"He had all the pressure of all of us on him on the last hole. It wasn't about what he did on the last hole. If we look back, there were many, many other instances we could have won it outright way before that.\" \n\nStay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T19:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T22:37:08.215+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
