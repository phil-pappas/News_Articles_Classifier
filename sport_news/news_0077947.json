Quarterback Brian McGough faked the handoff to teammate Shawn Gowans and scampered into the end zone himself to cap off a 16- play, 80-yard drive. \nThe drive was nothing short of impressive, and gave Sanborn head coach John Welch something to build on during practice. \n“It was good to see that they still stuck with it,” said Welch. “We always say to give it your best effort, and not giving up was definitely important. They’re [Souhegan] a good football team.” \nWelch is one of many who see the talent on the Souhegan sideline. The Sabers football squad was ranked seventh overall in the state of New Hampshire heading into Saturday’s contest. \nWhile the Indians continued to fight offensively, they had problems containing a trios of Souhegan backs. Jonathan Nogueria and Cameron Kinney rushed for a combined 318 yards. Sophmore back Dante Savo only got carries in the second half, but he used his time to rush for 98 yards and two TD’s. \nIt was a great day, however, for the Indians in the turnover category. They intercepted Souhegan quarterback Michael Mancini twice and forced two fumbles. Sanborn stood tall in the red zone, as three of those four turnovers were forced as Souhegan was about to go in for a score. Christian Ehlers intercepted Mancini in the end zone late in the first quarter to keep the game at 7-0. \n“When you get turnovers you hope that you can capitalize,” said Welch. “Those turnovers were important because it kept them off the board.” \nIt was a one-score game for much of the first half until Nogueira rushed in for his second touchdown with 52 seconds left, providing a 13-0 lead at the half. The Sabers then struck quickly for a score just two minutes into the third quarter. \nNathan King had another strong game for the Indians. The junior rushed for 66 yards to bring his season total to 427, but he was denied the end zone. \nSanborn will face Monadnock next Saturday. \nSouhegan 26, Sanborn 7 \nSouhegan (4-1): 7 6 7 6 — 26 \nSanborn (1-4): 0 0 0 7 —  7 \nFirst Quarter \nSou — Jonathan Nogueira 54 run (Zachary Bossi kick), 8:20 \nSecond Quarter \nSou — Janathan Nogueira 5 run (kick failed), 0:52 \nThird Quarter \nSou — Dante Savo 33 run (Bossi kick), 10:19 \nFourth Quarter \nSan — Brian McGough 2 run (Christian Ehlers kick), 2:59 \nSou — Dante Savo 27 run (kick failed), 1:12 \nINDIVIDUAL LEADERS \nRUSHING: San (43-183) -- Nathan King 14-66, Christopher Hanna 7-30, Shawn Gowans 13-58, Christian Ehlers 8-27, Brian McGough 1-2; Sou-- Jonathan Nogueira 17-194, Cameron Kinney 18-124, Dante Savo 8-98 \nPASSING: San -- Brian McGough 1-7-0 49,; Sou -- Michael Mancini 3-7-0 74 \nRECEIVING: San -- Kyle Storms 1-49; Sou -- Zachary Bossi 3-74 Sign Up / Sign In With your existing account from... {* loginWidget *}", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T07:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T18:01:54.763+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
