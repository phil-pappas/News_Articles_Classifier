I don’t know why this year, but (their support) is evident. I’ve been at other schools where the students — they make the game day atmosphere — and that is here. I’ve never seen it this way here.  It’s great to be a part of. It’s electrifying.”\nBYU offensive coordinator Robert Anae said.\nPROVO — The turnover at the starting running back slot at BYU has been extraordinary this season. A rash of injuries has caused coaches to field a different rotation in just about all of the five games played this season.\nThe season started off with assumed starting running back Jamaal Williams withdrawing from the program. Then it was Algie Brown, the assumed heir to Williams, sustaining a knee injury that sidelined him two games and kept him from performing at his best since the first game against Nebraska.\nIn between the losses of Williams and Brown have been injuries to Adam Hine (ankle) and Francis Bernard (hand), with Hine expected to miss some time after going down against Michigan. The only running back that has seemingly come away unscathed has been former walk-on Nate Carter.\nThe good news is that Brown feels healthy and is raring to go following a solid outing last week against UConn, where he toted the ball 18 times for 95 yards.\nSpeaking to the media Wednesday, Brown assured everyone that his, “knee is perfect. Knee is feeling great.\"\nBrown saw very limited work against Nebraska and even more limited work the following week against Boise State. The decision was made, after consecutive sub-par outings, to rest the former Skyline High standout against UCLA and then again against the Wolverines before giving him significant playing time last Saturday.\nNow that the waiting is over, Brown is happy to be back at full strength.\n“It was fun and exciting to be back out working with the guys,” Brown said. “It was kind of hard being out watching the guys for three weeks just busting their butts and you’re just there not doing anything.”\nAs for offensive coordinator Robert Anae, he's very happy to have Brown back at anywhere close to full strength, although he saw some wear toward last week's game against the Huskies.\n“We got the most, I think, out of Algie and his injury started showing up really bad in the fourth quarter,” Anae said. “So we had to pull off and go with Francis. Francis had the hot hand and we were going with it in the fourth quarter.”\nAs for the true freshman Bernard, he saw his first action two weeks ago in a loss against Michigan, and has since shown good ability after recovering from a finger injury sustained in fall camp.\nWhile Hine recovers from his latest injury, Anae will likely look to Brown and Bernard to handle the load, among others, stating that, “It’s by committee again. We have a young running back (group) and, you know, there’s growing pains when you’re breaking in new guys.”\nOne of the newest guys seeing time at running back is converted defensive back and true freshman Riley Burt. Burt, in his first action as a Cougar, ran the ball once against UConn last week for five yards.\nAnae expressed optimism regarding Burt's progress, stating, “We’re excited about Riley Burt and looking forward to better things as the season unfolds.”\nSTUDENTS OFF THE CHAIN: When asked about the support BYU is currently receiving when playing at home, a typically stern Anae perked up and gave lavish praise the BYU student section.\n“Our student support is off the chain,” Anae said. “I don’t know why this year, but (their support) is evident. I’ve been at other schools where the students — they make the game day atmosphere — and that is here. I’ve never seen it this way here.  It’s great to be a part of. It’s electrifying.”\nFAMILIAR FOE: When the BYU offense lines up against East Carolina Saturday, the anticipation is the defense they see will strongly resemble what the Cougar offense sees during every practice session.\n“They’re very similar to our defense,” Anae said. “If we had to go out and play against our (defense), that would be a tough outing and we look at the same challenge going against East Carolina.”\nEmail: bgurney@desnews.com\nTwitter: @BrandonCGurney", "external_links": ["http://deseretnews.sportsdirectinc.com/football/ncaaf-teams.aspx?page=/data/ncaaf/teams/team33.html", "http://deseretnews.sportsdirectinc.com/football/ncaaf-teams.aspx?page=/data/ncaaf/teams/team91.html"], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T07:13:58.539+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
