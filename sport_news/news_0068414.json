Jennifer Shellabarger closed it out with a tip over the defense. \n\"We have to battle a lot of times to play to win rather than to play not to lose,\" Broncos' coach Beth Etchison said. \"I think they got those first two sets rather easily and they played complacent and decided to defend rather than to go on the offensive.\" \nIngenito finished with 21 kills and 19 digs, and Zannah Weber had 43 assists, 18 digs and eight aces. \n\"Having Lindsay's leadership on the court is something that we have to have at all times,\" said Etchison of Ingenito, a sophomore middle hitter. \nLC (8-19) took a six-match winless streak into its match and that coincided with a shoulder injury sustained by starting middle hitter Monica Watkins, which also kept her out Saturday. \n\"When Monica went out, it threw us (off) a little bit,\" Lions' coach Mike Carey said. \"She's such a dynamic player, but when you lose a player like that, it's like, 'How do you fill that gap?'\" \nThe Lions' other middle hitter, Melody Davidson, helped pick up the slack with 11 kills and three blocks. \nCowan (9-19 going into the final) erased a 3-1 first-set deficit with six straight points and went on an 8-1 run to extend the lead to 17-9. \nLC, and especially Davidson, came to life in set 2. The 6-foot-1 junior had six kills and a block as the Lions dug out of a 4-0 hole and jumped ahead 10-7. The Lions built it to eight on three occasions (16-8 and 18-10 on kills by Savannah Rees, and 17-9). \nBut a series of hitting errors and violations enabled Cowan to tie at 20, and an ace by Diana Campbell put the Blackhawks up 21-20. Cowan won the last four points of that set. \nThe Lions faced another uphill climb in the final set, as the closest they got was ties at 1 and 4. LC made a mini-run near the end, postponing Cowan match points four times with Jenna Scott serving. \n\"(Cowan's) going to be tough playing on their home court,\" Carey said. \"But overall, I thought (we) played competitively and did a good job.\" \nMacy McFall contributed nine kills for the Lions, including five in the third set. \nFive LC seniors will depart the program -- Brooklynne Rees, Elizabeth Lane, Justice Clem, Danielle Johnson and Sierra Edwards.
