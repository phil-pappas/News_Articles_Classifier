(AP Photo/Seth Wenig) \nWASHINGTON– The Redskins final game before the bye has been labeled a “Code Red” by Jay Gruden. Tampa Bay comes to town with a 2-3 record and coming off of a bye. The Redskins are on a two-game losing streak and need to find something positive soon before the season spirals out of control. Trent Williams and Jordan Reed are expected back in the lineup this week which should provide a much needed boost to the offense. Here are a few other things to watch for on Sunday: \nKirk Cousins \nThe quarterback is coming off another two-interception game last week and has thrown four in the last two weeks with only two touchdowns. He needs to be better, plain and simple. Jay Gruden said repeatedly this week that he is not going to make “any drastic changes” to the quarterback position or anything else this week. If Cousins doesn’t bounce back this week, there could be a lot of questions for Gruden to answer during the bye week. \nReed and Williams are back \nThe Redskins haven’t been able to run the ball the last couple of weeks with just 85 yards total in the last two games. A big part has been the injuries. With Trent Williams back on the left side we’ll see if Alfred and company can get going again. They should be able to take advantage of a Bucs defense that allows over 120 yards a game. \nWith Jordan Reed back in the lineup it gives Kirk Cousins a big weapon, especially on third down. There aren’t many people that can guard Reed and the Redskins have been lacking the production since he went down. \nRun defense \nThe Redskins have given up nearly 400 yards rushing the last two weeks, something that has to change for a group that is supposed to be a big key to winning football games. Doug Martin can run the football averaging 4.5 yards a carry. He’s ninth in the league with 405 yards and is a proven runner. The Redskins defense cannot let him beat them this week. \nStopping Winston \nThe defense has said all week that the key to making rookie quarterback Jameis Winston uncomfortable is to hit him as much as possible and get him out of his comfort zone. The Redskins need to make Tampa Bay one dimensional and force Winston to beat them, something he most likely will have a hard time doing. He’s ranked 30 out of 32 with just 56% completion percentage. If they can force him to throw interceptions it could be a good day for the defense. \nThird Quarter \nA big topic of conversation this week has been the dismal third quarters the Redskins have had this year. They have been outscored 43-6 in the third and have been out-gained 737 yards to 300. The Redskins have had the lead in five of six games at the half but for whatever reason they have not been ready to play in the third quarter. Jay Gruden and staff have spent a lot of time on this and know it has to be better. \nWith a bye next week and a trip to Foxboro to face the Super Bowl champions the week after, the Redskins need to find a way to beat Tampa Bay. If not, then there is a chance this season will unravel pretty quickly. 3-4 sounds a lot better than 2-5. \nFollow @WTOP on Twitter and WTOP on Facebook . \n© 2015 WTOP. All Rights Reserved.
