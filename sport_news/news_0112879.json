De Quay worked under Roland Liccioni at Rhapsody in Symphony Center and was executive sous-chef at the University Club. For the past 12 years, he's been executive chef at Hinsdale Golf Club. But the itch to fly solo persisted.\n\"My inner clock was ticking,\" he said. \"At Hinsdale, I felt that I'd gone as far as I could, and the more I thought about it, the more I thought I'd love to have my own little restaurant.\"\nThat dream came true May 1 with the opening of De Quay, where the food explores the chef/owner's Dutch heritage, with occasional nods toward Indonesia.\n\"My dad is Dutch,\" de Quay said, \"and I've been to Holland many, many times. And Holland and Indonesia's ties go back 500 years, since the beginning of the spice trade.\"\nThe menu is brief — seven appetizers, five entrees — as befits a 42-seat dining room (the bar seats another 15). De Quay doesn't overburden himself with strict authenticity; there are a few dishes that are clearly Dutch and one immediately identifiable Indonesian dish, but the rest commingle European and Asian flavors in ways that defy geographic designations.\nThe Indonesian dish to try is the nasi goreng, a fried-rice dish that has as many versions as there are Indonesian cooks in the world. De Quay himself will vary his presentation; at the moment, it's a vegetarian dish, the rice cooked in a spicy paste and mixed with market vegetables. On the side, are a couple of sambal sauces (which can be fiery hot in some restaurants but provide gentle heat here), pickled cucumbers and seroendeng, a coconut-peanut mix used as a condiment.\nThe star on the Dutch end is the grilled pork chop and smoked rookworst, the latter a pork sausage with nutmeg, coriander and clove among the seasonings. The smoked sausage is a keeper, the sous-vide pork pink and moist and as meltingly tender as a top-level tenderloin, and the vegetables — mixed cabbage and fried kale alongside Gouda-fortified mashed potatoes — are perfect accompaniments.\nThose are the must-have dishes, but there are more highlights. Steamed mussels in a sweet coconut-curry sauce arrive in fine shape in an impressive portion; chicken sate combines breast and thigh meat for a more juicy version than a lot of other restaurants can claim. Indonesian spices add aromatic interest to a fine roasted chicken over garlicky basmati rice, and a duck composition (tamarind-glazed leg, medium-rare breast alongside cooked apple slices and gingerbread croutons) works especially well, every flavor complementing the others.\nEven the head-scratching dishes are somewhat entertaining. There's a dumpling appetizer that arrives looking like fried pot stickers, but the filling is Euro-inspired — potato, Gouda, peas and bacon. The fondue of goat-milk Gouda and pureed cauliflower is a curiosity, though an inoffensive one. Grilled cobia, a new menu addition, is tasty enough to withstand its schizophrenic platemates — pandan rice over here, acorn squash puree with brown butter over there. Amsterdam frites with peanut sauce (the same sauce that graces the chicken sate) and herbed mayonnaise are just about pointless as an appetizer; I'd bust them down to the \"accompany\" category or, better still, delete them entirely.\nThe three desserts are all Dutch, all good and worth a visit by themselves. House-made stroopwafels are thin cookies with caramel filling, served with vanilla-bean ice cream; spekkoek is a cake made of micro-layers of cake and almond paste, alongside pandan-flavored ice cream (pandan is a distinctly flavored leaf used extensively in Indonesian cooking) and a peanut-butter pave is accented with Dutch spices, encased in Dutch-chocolate ganache, and graced with grapes and candied ginger.\nThe beverage program is especially strong. There are fine cocktails by \"spiritual consultant\" Noel Catrambone, and a brief assortment of craft beers. General manager Terry McNeese has put together a thoughtful wine list of modestly priced bottles and 20 by-the-glass options. McNeese is also a constant presence in the dining room, overseeing attentive and accommodating service.\nThe Apollo Theatre is a block away, making De Quay a handy pre-theater (there's a special three-course menu for that) and post-theater destination. De Quay just added Sunday brunch, where the menu includes pannenkoeken (Dutch pancakes), a breafast-y nasi goreng with pork belly and eggs, and seroendeng-coated French toast.\nIf anything, de Quay could be bolder with his flavors, perhaps kick up the heat on his Indonesian spices to make those dishes more distinctive. The Euro-inspired dishes he has down pat.\npvettel@tribpub.com\nTwitter @philvettel\nDe Quay\n2470 N.
