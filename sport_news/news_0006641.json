It’s the first time Miami has beaten the Texans in eight tries. \nBox Score: Houston Texans vs. Miami Dolphins \n“That was not a good performance,” Texans head coach Bill O’Brien said. “It’s terrible. It’s something I take full responsibility for.” \nIt’s five losses this season O’Brien has taken the blame, and not much seems to change each week. \nAnother stagnant offense that finally strung together drives when it didn’t matter.
