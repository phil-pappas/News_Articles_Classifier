The Tide's redshirt freshman left guard, Ross Pierschbacher.\n\"He's done a nice job for us,\" Saban said.\nRanked by Rivals as a four-star recruit and the eighth-best offensive guard in last year's recruiting class, the 6-foot-4, 300-pound Pierschbacher had not allowed a sack, did not have any missed assignments and recorded 11 knockdown blocks through Alabama's first three games, according to his bio on the Tide athletics website.\nThe Iowa native is part of an offensive line that has paved the way for running back Derrick Henry to rush for 422 yards and five touchdowns while averaging 6.8 yards per carry against Alabama's three Power Five conference opponents.\nPierschbacher squatted 600 pounds during the Tide's spring testing. That was tied for the best on the team.\nHis 40-yard dash time (5.19) was tied with freshman lineman Brandon Kennedy for the best among Alabama offensive linemen.\n\"I'd say (I'm) more of a smart offensive lineman,\" Pierschbacher said when asked to describe his skill set. \"Kind of base my play off of knowing what to do and trying to get there fast and efficiently.\"\nRoss Pierschbacher Ross Pierschbacher discusses Georgia win, improvements on the OL and more.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T08:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T07:53:17.907+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
