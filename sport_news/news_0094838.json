He’s expected to play for the Erie (Pa.) Bayhawks in the NBA D-League once he clears waivers. \nSibert, who signed as a free agent with the Magic in September after not being drafted in June, appeared in five preseason games, averaging 6.1 minutes per game. He scored three points. \nThe Magic also cut Keith Appling, of Michigan State. They have 17 players on the roster and have to be at 15 by the end of the week. \nThe Erie Bayhawks were formed in 2008. They were originally a Cleveland Cavaliers affiliate and then the Philadelphia 76ers. They open the season Nov. 14 at the Westchester (N.Y.) Knicks. More News \n© 2015 Cox Media Group .
