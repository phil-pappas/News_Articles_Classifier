The teams don’t meet again this season and there’s only one weekend of DODDS Korea intra-league games remaining this season. \nBut the game was closer than the score indicated, Falcons coach Jimbo Davis said. \n“They (Warriors) have speed and weapons that can get you,” Davis said, adding he was worried that the Falcons could have met the same fate as they did last month against Nile C. Kinnick, losing 19-18 after leading 18-0. \n“We were able to hang in there,” Davis said of taking a 25-0 lead on Daegu, then holding off a late charge in which the Warriors outscored the Falcons 16-6. \nKyle Ellison scored on runs of 4 and 18 yards, Eben Shelton added a 22-yard TD run and Haynes posted a 43-yard touchdown run for the Falcons. \nDaegu answered in the second half with a pair of DeAndre Rosalie touchdown passes to Josh McCaw. Rosalie was 7-for-18 for 124 yards and ran 18 times for 75 yards. McCaw’s two pass catches went for 75 total yards. \n“We weren’t mentally prepared,” Warriors coach Phillip Loyd said. “Seoul American is a tough team and they really played well. We have to work on the mental aspects of our game.” \nSeoul American next hosts defending Far East Division I champion Kadena on Saturday, a school the Falcons vanquished in the 2006 and 2008 D-I title games. Kickoff is at 6 p.m. Daegu next plays a Monday game against the Singapore Falcons; kickoff is at 6 p.m. Oct. 19.
