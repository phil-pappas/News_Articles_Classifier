Not only have they won five straight titles, but they’ve taken an eye-popping ten of the last thirteen district tournaments. The circumstances were a little different in 2015, but the outcome was typical. El Dorado entered this year’s tournament as the No. 4 seed. They were the No. 1 seed in the previous three tournaments. On Tuesday, the top tournament seed stood in their way. CLICK HERE FOR PHOTOS After dropping the first set to No. 1 Lamar in the semifinals, El Dorado rallied back to take the next two sets and advanced to the championship game. Lamar beat the Lady Bulldogs in straight sets back in September. “We came out tonight and Lamar is a fantastic team, they got the one seed,” said Eldo head coach Ashley Rogers. “We weren't really sure what to expect out of them. We had played them earlier in the season but it's been a little while since then, so we knew it was going to be a fight for sure. But I told them it'd be worth it if they would do it.” That match gave the young El Dorado team tons of confidence to take on a good Pierce City team in the title match. The Lady Bulldogs ripped off the first six points to begin the first set and didn’t look back. They won the first set 25-16. “We work really hard on not having to go three games,” said Rogers. “Just capitalize on that fifty points, get the fifty points and be done, not have to go three, and not be tired.” They did just that. Pierce City fought back and jumped out to a 9-3 lead in the second set, but El Dorado called a timeout and settled down. El Dorado won the next point (in fact, they won ever point after each timeout throughout the match) and rallied once again to win 25-20. “Pierce City was a scrappy little team and they fought back,” Rogers said. “I give it all to the girls. They've done everything, they've worked so hard for this and I'm so, so proud of them for what they've done.” The Lady Bulldogs leaned on their lone senior Kinli Simmons, who led the team in assists (19), blocks (7) and digs (10) and also had three aces. On a team with just one senior and one junior, the setter Simmons shoulders the leadership role on the team. “Kinli means oh, so much to us,” said Rogers. “She's a four-year varsity starter, she's amazing... She's just really the glue that holds us all together. She works hard for us and everything, the girls respect her, and they look to her for the confidence that they need.” Kayla Collins tallied six kills and three aces. Taylor Robison had six blocks, Kelsey Thomas had seven digs, and Keili Tough had five kills. El Dorado, now just 12-19-1, will square off against a 30-win Crane team in the opening round of the Class 2 tournament on Saturday, Oct. 24. Despite the recent success, this young team will have a brand new challenge ahead. “Some of them haven't experienced this,” said Rogers. “I have a couple of girls that haven't even ever played varsity last year, so this is a new thing for them. They may have experienced it in the crowd but they didn't get to experience it on the floor. That district is rough, we're going to have to really work and come out and see if we can get a little scouting report on [Crane] and try to come away with another win.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T09:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T10:40:10.568+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
