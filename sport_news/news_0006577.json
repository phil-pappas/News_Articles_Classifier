But the 35-year-old birdied Nos. 10 and 11 and played the last three holes in Even-par to take home the victory at 1-under par for 36 holes. Skeadas, II, and his son, John Skeadas, III, tied for runner up at 2-over par. \nTripp Coggins finished fourth followed by Parker Stone, Jeff Cowart, Phillip Kennedy, Davy Clay, Peter Brennan, Ben Brennan and Walter Hagan. The only score under par in the final round belonged to Stone, a junior at Savannah Country Day who won the Savannah City Championship in the spring at Bacon Park. \nDonald Consos, who was the head professional at Bacon Park until 1973, won the Senior Division with score of 74-75 to edge Bill McCloskey by two strokes. Flight winners included David Schaller in the Legends Divison, Keith Thomas in Men’s Net Division and David Davis in the Senior Net Division. \nThe tournament was played on the fully restored Donald Ross Course for the first time, and the lowest score of the weekend from the field of 96 players was Kent’s 68 in the first round. The Donald Ross Course is now open for public play. Please call 354-2625 for tee times and additional information. \nCopyright 2015 WTOC. All rights reserved.
