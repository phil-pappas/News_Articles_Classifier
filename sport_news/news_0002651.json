The series is currently deadlocked (36-36-1) until the two teams meet on Saturday where Tech coach Kliff Kingsbury will try for his first win against the Bears. Baylor introduced a new trophy into the equation this season, which will be awarded to the winner of the Texas Farm Bureau Insurance Shootout. Last year's meeting was indeed a shootout, in which the Bears emerged victorious despite six touchdown passes from Patrick Mahomes. Saturday's matchup also marks the first time in school history the Red Raiders will play back-to-back top-five nationally ranked teams. Texas Tech is the nation's only program to face two top-five opponents in its first five games of the 2015 season and was seconds away from topping then-No. 3 TCU last week.
