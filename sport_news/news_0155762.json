(Photo: Mark R. Sullivan/Gannett) Buy Photo \nPISCATAWAY No.4-ranked Michigan State is 0-5 against the spread but 5-0 against opponents. \nGood news for bookies. Bad news for Rutgers. \nMichigan State started the week favored by as many as 17 points over Rutgers but was down to a 14-point favorite at the end of the week on Sportsbook.ag . \nThe teams meet at 8 p.m. tonight at High Point Solutions Stadium on Big Ten Network in a rematch of Michigan State's 45-3 victory last season. \nGannett New Jersey has four writers on hand to cover the action. Here are the staff predictions: \nRyan Dunleavy: Two ways to look at Michigan State's too-close-for-comfort win against Purdue last week. Either it was a sign that Michigan State is overrated or it was a wake-up call not to play down to competition. I'm guessing the latter. Like against Penn State, Rutgers offensive line can't hold up, the rushing attack struggles and quarterback Chris Laviano is never comfortable. Michigan State 31, Rutgers 10. \nSteve Edelson: With reinstated receiver Leonte Carroo making a pair of TD receptions, the Scarlet Knights nearly pull off their biggest victory since defeating No. 3 Louisville in 2006. And while the loss was heartbreaking, the final margin showed they are closing the gap on the Big Ten’s top teams. Michigan State 24, Rutgers 23. \nJosh Newman: There are winnable games left on Rutgers’ schedule, but this is not one. Michigan State has too many weapons and is too balanced on both sides of the ball. Michigan State 38, Rutgers 10. \nJerry Carino: Leonte Carroo makes a big play for Rutgers in his return to action. Michigan State makes about 10 big plays. Welcome to the big-boy portion of the schedule. Michigan State 31, Rutgers 14. \nStaff Writer Ryan Dunleavy: rdunleavy@gannettnj.com Read or Share this story: http://on.app.com/1LocEl6 TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T23:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T00:13:07.295+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
