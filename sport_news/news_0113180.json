Shawn changes this team in many ways. We are extremely excited to have him as part of the pack.\" \nCalgary also gave New England its third-round pick in the 2018 NLL Entry Draft. In exchange, the Black Wolves gave up Tyler Digby – acquired in a trade from Vancouver on Sunday – and first round picks in the 2018 and 2019 NLL Entry Drafts. \n\"We are very excited to add a player of Shawn's caliber to our group,\" Black Wolves coach Glenn Clark said. \"His offensive abilities are exceptional, and he will help us on our path to becoming a competitive team in this tough Eastern Conference. Shawn has one of the highest compete levels in the game and that is a trait that we want to become part of our teams identity.\" \nA 29-year-old forward who has played 10 seasons in the NLL with Rochester and Calgary, Evans is coming off his most productive season, finishing with career highs of 47 goals, 83 assists and 130 points. The points and assists were league highs as Evans was named NLL MVP for the second time in his career (he was also honored in 2013). \n\"I feel like, right now, I am at the top of my game,\" said Evans, who has racked up three straight 100-point seasons. \"The last two or three years, I've been putting up high numbers. I feel healthy and ready to play and continue that winning attitude. I like winning and I like being part of a team. I'm looking forward to carrying that on to New England.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T19:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T23:58:25.163+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
