He entered the concussion protocol last Friday after sustaining what the team originally termed a neck injury in Week 5.\nReed has missed two straight games. He has 24 catches for 278 yards and a touchdown this season.\nBlog: Eat Sleep Redskins Redskins news, analysis and opinion\nFollow @EatSleepRedskin \n<img style = \" position: relative; float:left; margin-right:25px;border:1px solid silver;\" src=\"http://hamptonroads.com/files/imagecache/story_photo_main/files/images/1169571.jpg\" width=\"100\" height=\"75\" border=0\"></a> <h4>More Redskins</h4> <ul class=\"disc\"> <li><a href=\"http://hamptonroads.com/category/pilotonline.com/sports/redskins\">Team news</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://hamptonroads.com/blogs/joe-kacik\">Fantasy sports blog</a></li> </ul> </div> </div></div> </div> <div id=\"omc-right\"> <div class=\"related\"> <div class=\"related_inner\"> <h4>Related</h4> <ul class=\"disc\"> <li><a href=\"/2015/10/clinton-portis-gruden-has-redskins-locker-room-zorn-didnt\">Clinton Portis: Gruden has Redskins' locker room, Zorn didn't.</a> - Oct. 21, 2015</li> <li><a href=\"/2015/10/healthier-rested-jets-pose-big-problem-redskins\">Healthier, rested Jets pose big problem for Redskins</a> - Oct. 18, 2015</li> <li><a href=\"/2015/10/gruden-redskins-desean-jackson-could-play-sunday-vs-jets\">Gruden: Redskins' DeSean Jackson could play Sunday vs. Jets</a> - Oct. 15, 2015</li> <li><a href=\"/2015/10/exredskin-riggins-speak-chesapeake-jamboree\">Ex-Redskin Riggins to speak at Chesapeake Jamboree</a> - Oct. 15, 2015</li> <li><a href=\"/2015/10/redskins-linebacker-kerrigan-looking-find-his-rhythm\">Redskins linebacker Kerrigan looking to find his rhythm</a> - Oct. 10, 2015</li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div> </aside> <div class=\"story-head story-foot\"> <h2><strong>Posted to</strong>: <span class=\"tag\"><a href=\"/category/pilotonline.com/sports/redskins\">Redskins</a> <a href=\"/tags/redskins\">Redskins</a> <a href=\"/category/pilotonline.com/sports\">Sports</a> <a href=\"/tags/washingtonredskins\">Washington Redskins</a></span></h2> <div id=\"socialButtons2\" class=\"gigya-sharebar\"></div> </div>", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T16:15:13.018+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
