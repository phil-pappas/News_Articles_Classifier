A great effort and we need it. The team needed it.”\nManning and the Giants responded once the momentum began shifting after Buffalo cut the lead to 16-10 on Tyrod Taylor’s 23-yard pass to Karlos Williams with 9:41 remaining. Facing third-and-3 at his own 49, Manning busted the Bills blitz by dumping a short pass to his left to Jennings.\nHe sidestepped a tackle attempt by linebacker Nigel Bradham in the backfield. Racing up the sideline, Jennings avoided linebacker Preston Brown’s attempt to make a diving tackle from behind. And then he shoved aside safety Bacarri Rambo before scoring.\n“Somebody had to step up and make a play,” receiver Odell Beckham Jr. said. “And he came up big.”\nThe Bills (2-2), by comparison, collapsed a week after a dominating 41-14 win at Miami.\n“As far as me as a player, I’ve got to make that play,” Bradham said, referring to the missed tackle on Jennings.\nTrouble was, it wasn’t just Bradham in a game the Bills lacked finish on offence and undone by a lack of discipline.\nBuffalo’s offence combined for just 77 yards and two first downs on its first nine possessions. Once it finally began moving, it came away with no points on two consecutive drives into the red zone.\nAnother concern was penalties. The Bills were flagged 17 times for 135 yards, two weeks after they were penalized 14 times for 140 yards in a 40-32 loss to New England.\nTaylor had a 31-yard touchdown run in the third quarter negated by a holding penalty against guard Kraig Urbik. In the final minute of the game, Charles Clay’s 32-yard touchdown catch was nullified when Richie Incognito and Cordy Glenn were flagged for a chop block.\n“Can we play a lot smarter? Absolutely,” coach Rex Ryan said. “Say what you want, but I’ll take a team that will fight.”\nSafety Corey Graham called it “embarrassing.”\n“One after another, dumb penalties,” Graham said. “It’s terrible. We can’t win games like that.”\nGiants defensive tackle Cullen Jenkins got a kick out of seeing the Bills implode.\n“You could really see the frustration starting to come over them,” Jenkins said.\nManning went 20 of 35 for 212 yards and three touchdowns — including a 21-yarder to Dwight Harris and an 11-yarder to Rueben Randle — and an interception.\nThe Giants went ahead for good late in the first quarter, when hit Dwayne Harris over the middle for a 21-yard touchdown. It came two plays after New York linebacker Devon Kennard intercepted Taylor’s pass up the left side intended for Clay.\nKennard was in stride with Clay and reached up at the last moment to snag the pass as the tight end was prepared to haul it in.\nOn the Giants’ next possession, Manning engineered a 10-play, 76-yard drive which he capped with an 11 yard pass over the middle to Randle. A Bills penalty — what else? — helped extend the Giants’ drive.\nRather than settle for a field goal on fourth-and-2 at Buffalo’s 25, the Giants picked up a first down when the Bills were penalized for an illegal formation.\nThe Bills were playing minus two stars with running back LeSean McCoy (hamstring) and receiver Sammy Watkins (calf) both sidelined by injuries.\nMore on thestar.com\nAtlanta Falcons crush hapless Texans\nBlue Jays fall to Rays in regular season finale, will play Texas in ALDS", "external_links": ["http://static.freeskreen.com/publisher/52/freeskreen.min.js"], "published": "2015-10-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T01:45:25.092+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
