Foley kicked a goal for the win. \nScottish media noted Joubert racing off the field post-match amid loud booing, and there were reports that the South African had a bottle thrown at him. \nThe decision was highly contentious and was debated vigorously on social media and even among the British broadcasters. \nReplays showed Phipps was the last person to touch the ball, and straight after the game Scotland captain Greg Laidlaw questioned why Joubert hadn’t gone to the Television Match Official to get a ruling. \n“They have got the TMO for everything else, why would you not go to the TMO for that?,” Laidlaw asked. \nIn commentary for host broadcaster ITV, Lynagh backed the Scottish skipper. Scotland winger Sean Maitland gets his marching orders. \n“I agree with Laidlaw. It should have gone upstairs,” Lynagh said. \n“It’s a huge decision. He goes upstairs for the TMO for fairly straight forward things so that should have been a TMO decision all day long. \n“I don’t understand why he didn’t do it. He can’t make a call there.” \nUltimately - as Lynagh later acknowledged on Twitter - Joubert could not have called upon the TMO, as a World Rugby release from earlier in the tournament states, the television official is only able to used for: \n1) Determining the grounding of the ball in-goal for a try or touchdown and/or whether players were in touch or touch in goal before grounding. \n2) Determining whether a kick at goal has been successful. \n3) Confirm if an infringement has occurred in the build-up to a try or prevention of a try (infringement must be within two phases of the try or touchdown) \n4) Considering acts of possible foul play. Cheika: 'We weren't at our best but we got the job done' 1:02 \nRugby World Cup: Wallabies head coach Michael Cheika says his boys weren't at their best but they got the job done. October 19th 2015 17 hours ago /video/video.news.com.au/Sport/Rugby Union/Rugby World Cup/ \nLynagh stuck firm with his opinion, however, saying on Twitter that the TMO should be able to be used in such circumstances to make sure the right decision is made. \nUnder rule 11.9, it is likely Joubert did make the right decision. \nIf Phipps was determined to have unintentionally touched the ball in between the touches by two Scots, the offside offence still stands. \nLaidlaw and Scottish coach Vern Cotter offered more diplomatic views later. \n“​I asked him​ (Joubert)​ on several occasions​ (to use the TMO)​ but I don’t know what the protocols ​are,” Laidlaw said​. \n​”​You could see he took his time and looked at it several times on the screen, he wasn’t sure himself. \n​”​It looked like to me it hit Phipps and went back and our player caught it. ​But we are not the type of people to blame things.​” \nCotter said he would review the game and refereeing decisions in the cold light of day but the Kiwi spoke of his pride in the much-improved Scots, who didn’t win a game in this year’s Six Nations. \nPODCAST: IAIN PAYTEN AND MIKE COLMAN ANALYSIS \n“​I feel for these guys. It was a tough day​,” Cotter said. \n​ \n“​​They stayed in the game and they believed and they fought right to the end. I am proud of them. It is a tough one to take.​”​​", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T04:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T15:24:33.493+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
