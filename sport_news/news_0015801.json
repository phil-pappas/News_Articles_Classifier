And when that didn't work out ... The only thing worse than getting your hopes up is getting your hopes up on an annual basis, only to have the rug pulled out from underneath you.\n\"So I'm very pleased for them because this is really what they live for and what they've always wanted. It shouldn't have taken us nine years but all that really matters now is we're there and it will be not only good for them but interesting to see what we do with it now.\"\nToronto FC (15-13-4) clinched its first ever post-season berth with a 2-1 win over the East-leading New York Red Bulls 2-1 on Wednesday.\nToronto, second in the Eastern Conference, hosted the fifth-place Columbus Crew (13-11-8) on Saturday. Greg Vanney's team wraps up the regular season Oct. 25 in Montreal, looking to remain in the top two to ensure a first-round playoff bye.\nToronto's designated players have all stepped up this season, led by the marvellous Sebastian Giovinco. Going into weekend play, Giovinco (22 goals), fellow forward Jozy Altidore (12 goals) and captain/midfielder Michael Bradley (five goals) had combined for 39 goals.\nThat's more than the Portland Timbers, Real Salt Lake and the Colorado Rapids have scored this season.\n\"Probably a higher payroll than those three teams as well,\" Leiweke said with a chuckle.\nThe Toronto DPs are making a combined US$18.37 million this season.\nOn a more serious note, Leiweke praised MLSE ownership for not recoiling from such major player investments after getting burned by English star Jermain Defoe, who left after just one year.\n\"We learned our lesson on Defoe. We kind of shook ourself off and got up off the mat and brushed it off. I think we kind of said 'OK, go big or go home.' And we convinced the board to do it again. And so as much grief as people love to give MLSE and the owners, I will tell you I think they were spectacular on this one. Because it would have been very easy for them after the Defoe experience to call it a day and move on.\n\"There were some tense moments. We had some friction at the end of the Defoe experiment. And again it would have been easy for our owners to say call it a day.\"\nLeiweke notes not only did ownership commit to Giovinco, they dug into their pockets to take him from the start of the MLS season when the original plan was to have him join mid-campaign from Juventus.\n\"To me that is the big difference. We got him in early. He got a full training (camp) with us. He hit the ground running. ... I think that's one of the reasons why Seba's has been as great as he's been.\"\nWith 22 goals and 15 assists prior to Saturday's game, Giovinco has been directly involved in 65 per cent of Toronto's 57 goals this season. And he has scored from all over the place.\nTen of his goals have come from outside the penalty area, which is six more than any other player in MLS.\nLeiweke also credits GM Tim Bezbatchenko and Vanney for targeting Giovinco as the creative attacker they wanted. \"From Day 1, they called it,\" he said.\nHe also singled out Giovinco's agent, Andrea D'Amico, for having the foresight to see that MLS would allow the Atomic Ant to reinvent himself.\nGiovinco, who is signed to a six-year deal, is drawing headlines outside of North America these days and is back in the Italian national team fold. Leiweke, who helped bring David Beckham to MLS, calls Giovinco \"maybe the best player the league's ever seen.\"\n\"More importantly this kid loves Toronto. He loves the Blue Jays. He loves the Raptors. I can't imagine having someone that fit as well as he has fit into Toronto. And this is a kid that doesn't want to leave and my guess is he'll never leave here. I think this is a guy who will be here long-term.\"\nThe issue was discussed at the last MLSE board meeting and the ownership group has \"zero interest, zero, on even hearing about Seba moving,\" he added.\nLeiweke also talked up new TFC president Bill Manning, calling him a \"soulmate\" in terms of his passion for the MLS club and the city.\n\"I think the team of Bill and Tim and Greg puts this club in very good standing long-term.\"\nThe goal for the franchise \"is to be great not today, but to be great every day,\" he added.\n\"The real opportunity for TFC is can we be a club that competes for a championship each and every year,\" he said.\nLeiweke believes Manning and Bezbatchenko can build on the existing foundation and take the club to a level where it \"can be very good for a very long time.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T23:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T03:08:23.192+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
