They're betting $100. The money will go to the winner's charity of choice. \nSenator John Thune of South Dakota announced he's placed a friendly wager on the football game. If the Jackrabbits win, North Dakota Senator John Hoeven will give bison steaks to Thune. If the bison win, Thune will give meats and cheeses to Hoeven. \nThe university presidents also placed a bet. The winner will send a team jersey to the loser. \nAnd last, but not least, there's the Dakota Marker. \nKickoff is Saturday at 6 p.m. in Brookings. Tickets are sold out, so with the new, larger stadium there will be a record crowd. \nIf you are there, send us pictures of the action.
