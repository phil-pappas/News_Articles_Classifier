Comment   Dave Horvath Posted Oct. 21, 2015 at 8:13 PM By Dave Horvath Posted Oct. 21, 2015 at 8:13 PM As archery and firearms deer seasons approach on the calendar, the Missouri Department of Conservation is offering a free class to instruct hunters how to properly care for their harvested meat and/or trophy. Field to Freezer will be from 6:30 to 8:30 p.m. at the Wildcat Glades Conservation & Audubon Center, 201 W. Riviera Drive, Joplin. “They need to give us a call and register so we can know how many to plan for,” encouraged Diana Steele, public service assistant. “We have a real deer, and Don Scott will show people how to prepare the deer for taxidermy if they are wanting to have it mounted. Then he will go into the process of how to cut it up into the proper cuts and how to package it.” Scott is a retired meat processor and taxidermist. It’s important to know what to do after downing the deer, Steele said. Scott will go over the process of how to get it ready to take home to process the cuts. Techniques will be demonstrated for field dressing the deer and placing meat cuts in the freezer. Also explained will be regulations, supplies needed and tips on transporting the harvest. “Hunters need to make sure that they mark the packages with their confirmation number and date it,” she said. “Because that’s always a good thing to know how old your meat is in your freezer. They would need the knife to cut the door open, something to store the entrails in, and plastic gloves are always helpful. Those would be the main supplies.” A question-and-answer time is included. Demonstrations by Scott are shown on a large video screen to allow a better view as several dozen people often attend the event. To register or for more information, call (417) 629-3423. The program is for ages 7 and older. Those up to age 15 must be accompanied by an adult.
