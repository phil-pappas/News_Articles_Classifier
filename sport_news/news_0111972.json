Alabama has won the last four games against Les Miles' Tigers, but it's become one of the most anticipated annual games. CBS tabbed it as its night game, setting the stage for another 7 p.m. CST kickoff when the two meet. \nAlabama head coach Nick Saban won't single out LSU as a special rivalry -- the school has multiple big rivalries, he says -- but credits LSU's success for adding interest to the game. \n\"LSU has become a little bit of a rivalry game because their program has become so good,\" Saban said. \"This game usually has a lot of significance coming down to the ninth game of the season because we've had some success too. That's what's made it a national interest game, that's what's made it a rivalry game and that's what's made it an important game. So it's a real compliment to them.\" \nThe last time LSU defeated Alabama was when the two were ranked No. 1 and No. 2 in the country in the famous \"Game of the Century\" in 2011. Alabama later defeated LSU in the national championship that season and has defeated the Tigers in the regular season the last three years. Last year, Alabama beat LSU 20-13 in overtime. \nThis year's game might not get the \"Game of the Century\" billing, but will feature two teams ranked in the top 10 and the favorite to win the Heisman Trophy. Fans of both teams are already looking forward to the game, but after eight straight weeks of games, Saban won't inundate his players with LSU preparation this week. \nThe Alabama coach thought his team lacked energy and looked tired in its 19-14 win against Tennessee on Saturday. Players like Ryan Anderson said after the game they didn't think fatigue was a major factor, but Saban reiterated the point on Monday. He wants this week to be an opportunity for his 7-1 team to \"rest, recover\" and \"get caught up academically\" after a grueling two month stretch that included trips to Dallas, Athens and College Station. \nSaban would rather think about ways to improve in practice this week than get his guys already thinking about Leonard Fournette. \n\"I don't think you play any better in a game for thinking about it longer or practicing longer,\" he said. \"We kind of have a routine we go through in preparation for every game and I think that's how our players are kind of conditioned to it.\" Nick Saban talks LSU Alabama head coach Nick Saban talks LSU preparation.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T20:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T22:07:30.948+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
