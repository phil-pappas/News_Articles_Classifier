The Rutgers running back broke through the line on a first quarter run and had nothing but open field in front of him. \nJames had been running outside the numbers on the right side, but at the Michigan State 15-yard line, he began to veer back toward the middle of the field. That change in direction allowed a Spartans defender to dive and trip him up at the 6. \n\"I made a bad decision,\" James said of his 72-yard run. \"I tried to turn up the field and he clipped my ankle. I looked at the big board and I thought he was a little further back because I think there's a little delay so I thought he was a little further back than what he was. So I tried to turn upfield and he clipped my ankle.\" \nJames said he doesn't plan to stop looking at the video board when he gets in the open field, but he learned a valuable lesson on the run against Michigan State. \n\"I might use it, but I'll just know now that if I think he's a little further back, I just have to know he's a little closer,\" James said. \"If you can look up at it, it helps you from looking back and slowing yourself down. So you can just give a quick glance and you can see who's around you.\" \nVideo board deception aside, James was asked if he would have scored last year before he tore the ACL in his right knee. \n\"Definitely,\" James said. \"And if I get any more like that, I'm definitely scoring. I'm not getting caught anymore.\" \nJames backed up his words in Saturday's 55-52 win over Indiana , as he broke a 40-yard touchdown run in the fourth quarter. \n\"It definitely restored some confidence,\" James said of the long runs. \"It's always good to have to fall back on and to know that you can do that.\" \nRELATED: What happened to Paul James after his 72-yard run vs. Michigan State? \nJames said he was 100 percent healthy at the start of training camp , but he averaged just 3.6 yards per carry in the first three games of the season. He appears to have regained his explosiveness in the past three games, as he has averaged 10.2 yards per carry over that stretch. \n\"It definitely feels like it's coming back,\" said James, who has started every game this season. \"It just took a couple of games to get back in the game flow after not playing for so long and not being in game situations. It's so hard to get that in practice. Throughout the games I feel like each week I'm getting better and better.\" \nDan Duggan may be reached at dduggan@njadvancemedia.com .
