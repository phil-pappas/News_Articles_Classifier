Hammonds, who has committed to play at Arkansas, is averaging 116.6 yards per game. \nPulaski Robinson Coach Todd Eskola couldn't fool his team when it came to facing Dardanelle, the defending 4-4A Conference champion, tonight. \n\"This group, honestly, you can't pull the coachspeak on them,\" Eskola said. \"They understood if we stumbled early, this game wouldn't matter.\" \nTonightâ€™s game \nWHERE Bob Keenan Field, Dardanelle \nRECORDS Robinson 7-0, 4-0 4-4A Conference; Dardanelle 7-0, 4-0 \nRANKINGS Robinson No. 2 in Class 4A; Dardanelle No. 1 in Class 4A \nKEY PLAYERS Robinson: QB Brennen Johnson, Sr., 5-11, 185; RB T.J. Hammonds, Sr., 5-11, 201; RB Myles Fells, Jr., 5-11, 185; WR/FS Nathan Page, So., 6-0, 180. Dardanelle: WR/FS Chris Kershner, Sr., 5-9, 175; QB Elyas Carter, So., 5-8, 155; LB Daniel Craig, Sr., 5-9, 205; DL Caden Brown, Jr., 6-1, 270. \nThe Senators haven't stumble in the first seven weeks of the season. Neither have the Sand Lizards. \nDardanelle and Pulaski Robinson have been ranked No. 1 and No. 2, respectively, all season in the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette 's Class 4A Super Six. The Sand Lizards (7-0, 4-0) and Senators (7-0, 4-0) play tonight, with the winner in position to capture the conference title and earn the league's No. 1 seed in the playoffs next month. \nDardanelle Coach Josh Price said he warned his team over the past seven weeks about looking ahead to tonight's matchup. \n\"On Mondays I've had to remind them, 'We play so-and-so. We do not play Robinson this week.' \" Price said. \"It's finally here and we get to focus on Robinson.\" \nBoth teams have lived up to preseason expectations. \nRobinson is led by senior quarterback Brennen Johnson, 5-11, 185 pounds, and running back T.J. Hammonds, 5-11, 201, who have helped the Senators average 49.2 points per game while allowing 16.1 points per game. Dardanelle senior wider receiver Chris Kershner, 5-9, 175, has been the focal point for a Sand Lizards team that averages 44.7 points per game while allowing 11.5. \nThe Senators finished 6-5 last season but have been boosted by the play of Johnson, who has completed 65 of 96 passes for 1,300 yards with 15 touchdowns and 3 interceptions. \n\"This year their quarterback is light years better,\" Price said. \"He's the bell cow and makes their offense go.\" \nHammonds, who has orally committed to the University of Arkansas, has rushed for 816 yards and 15 touchdowns on 55 carries and is averaging 116.6 yards per game. Sophomore receiver Nathan Page, 6-0, 180, leads the Senators with 24 receptions for 545 yards and 6 touchdowns. \n\"They have so many weapons on offense,\" Price said. \"You have to try to keep them in front of you. They live and breathe off the big play. You cannot let them do that.\" \nKershner started the season at quarterback but moved back to receiver after sophomore Elyas Carter, 5-8, 155, was handed the reins on the offense. Kershner has caught 22 passes for 414 yards and 6 touchdowns and has rushed for 624 yards and 8 touchdowns on 43 carries. \n\"Kershner is a game-breaker,\" Eskola said. \"You have to be aware of where he can play.\" \nCarter has completed 44 of 64 passes for 709 yards with 11 touchdowns and 4 interceptions. \nDardanelle beat Robinson 55-21 last season at Charlie George Stadium in Little Rock after taking a 28-0 lead into halftime. That has been a source of motivation for the Senators this season. \n\"Our kids were embarrassed with the way we played last year,\" Eskola said. \nThe Senators have defeated 7A-West Conference member Rogers Heritage 43-22 and 2-4A Conference leader Central Arkansas Christian 55-35, but Eskola said Dardanelle is the best team Robinson has faced so far. \n\"We've coached it this week literally as a top-four game,\" Eskola said. \"We feel like we're one of the top four teams in the state. We feel like Dardanelle is one of the top four teams in the state. This is an opportunity to play a semifinal or a state final game in Week 8.\" \nPrice admitted that the Sand Lizards haven't been tested often this season, having outscored opponents 313-81 while allowing more than 14 points only once this season, when Dardanelle defeated Clarksville 69-35 on Sept. 18. Still, he's tried to keep his players on an even keel. \n\"You can't put too much in it, win or lose,\" Price said. \"It's a huge game, but it's another game in the 10-week schedule.\" \nSports on 10/23/2015", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T09:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T16:40:41.904+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
