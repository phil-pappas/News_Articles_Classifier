I've played with a lot of great teammates, but I want to play for a long time. Maybe 10 more years. I think that's probably what my goal is.\"\nWhen asked if he was being serious about playing another decade, Brady insisted that is definitely his plan.\n\"Well, it's not always up to me,\" he acknowledged. \"That's what my goals are, so that's just what I'm hoping. And it will take a lot to achieve that. Obviously, a team has to want you, but I think that's, you know, I love playing this sport. I love making a commitment to my teammates and my coaches, and hopefully I can do it for a long time.\"\nThe 38-year-old Brady has shown no signs of slowing down.\nHe's tied for second in the league with 14 touchdown passes while throwing just one interception. His 1,699 yards passing rank him fifth in the NFL, and he is completing 70.6 percent of his passes.\n\"It's a great mark, there's no doubt about it,\" he said. \"To complete 70 percent is hard to do, but I would say it may reflect on the quarterback, but to me, it really reflects on the entire offense because it's just, you've got to spread it around to different people.\"\nBrady's Patriots (5-0) take on the AFC East-rival Jets (4-1) on Sunday at MetLife Stadium. New England has the second-ranked overall offense, while New York boasts the No. 1 overall defense.\n\"They're loaded with players and that's, I think, why they're tops in the league in basically every category that you look at,\" Brady said. \"So it's a big challenge, and hopefully we can nail things down by the time the game kicks off Sunday.\"\n___\nAP NFL website: www.pro32.ap.org and http://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n Videos From ", "external_links": ["http://host.coxmediagroup.com/cop/digital/sites/common/js/cmgo_right_rail_addons.js\\", "http://host.coxmediagroup.com/cop/digital/common/js/handlebars-v3.0.0.js\\", "http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/lt/lt_cache/thumbnail/908/img/photos/2015/10/21/4d/b1/277236f6997a43d1a68281594e07b2ba\\u002De8f5d1bcac204c8e9f882af634cb6ba0\\u002D1.jpg", "http://host.coxmediagroup.com/cop/digital/sites/daytondailynews/hbs/cinesport_grid_items.hbs", "http://www.kirotv.com/news/news/national/watch-nike-sends-michael-j-fox-his-very-own-pair-s/nn7YL/", "http://www.wftv.com/news/news/national/man-confesses-road-rage-killing-4-year-old-police-/nn7Z7/", "http://host.coxmediagroup.com/cop/digital/common/cache/cacher.php?saveas=ddn_cinesport_main&format=rss&json_url=", "http://www.wpxi.com/gallery/classifieds/real-estate/photos-inside-jp-morgans-former-295m-new-york-retr/gCXgj/", "http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/lt/lt_cache/thumbnail/908/img/photos/2015/10/21/01/12/277236f6997a43d1a68281594e07b2ba\\u002De8f5d1bcac204c8e9f882af634cb6ba0\\u002D0.jpg", "http://www.wsbtv.com/news/news/national/potentially-toxic-chemical-found-nail-polish/nn7cF/", "http://host.coxmediagroup.com/cop/digital/common/php/simple_get_file.php?url=", "http://www.whio.com/news/entertainment/music/r-kelly-helps-his-high-school-music-teacher-87-kee/nn7df/", "http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.0/jquery.min.js\\", "http://twitter.com/AP_NFL", "http://w.sharethis.com/button/buttons.js", "http://widgets.outbrain.com/outbrain.js"], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T17:21:29.613+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
