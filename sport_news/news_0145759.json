BLODGETT / CONTRIBUTING WRITER\nPublished: Oct. 1, 2015 11:11 a.m. MORENO VALLEY: Local youth overcomes cancer Print Photo Share Pin It 1 of 2 More Galleries ADVERTISEMENT Sydney Satterwhite of Moreno Valley celebrates the day he discovered he was cancer free. , COURTESY OF SYDNEY SATTERWHITE Related article » After postponing college for a year to fight cancer, Sydney Satterwhite of Moreno Valley returned to Howard University in the spring of 2013 with a desire to help others. Now he seeks others’ help to win a contest that could wipe out his school debt and let him focus on paying his medical bills.\nEarlier this fall Satterwhite entered the annual Dr. Pepper Tuition Giveaway. Contestants tell their “one of a kind” story in an essay and video and solicit votes online. Prizes range from $1,000 to $100,000 and can only be applied to school loans and tuition.\nIn his essay, Satterwhite wrote that he wants “to show the world how to turn pain into strength” and to “be an example to any youth or young adult who has had a hardship.”\nSatterwhite’s hardship offset the excitement his family felt when he left for college in August of 2011.\nLike many a proud yet concerned mother, Nancy Satterwhite told her son to dress warmly for the East Coast weather, to eat his vegetables and to make good decisions.\nThere was one thing she couldn’t know to warn him about.\n“When Sydney came home (for Christmas break), we initially thought he had bronchitis,” she said. “Hours later were told he had stage 3 T-Cell Lymphoma, a collapsed lung and he might not make it through the night.”\nSydney Satterwhite spent two long, dark weeks in intensive care at Loma Linda University Hospital. He was cheered when he was cleared to go home for Christmas.\n“It was big to go home and be in my own house and know when sun comes up and sun goes down,” he said.\nHe endured a year of treatments before being cleared to return to school. As his May 2016 graduation nears, he is cancer-free yet still has periodic checkups.\nSatterwhite said cancer was the most difficult thing to happen to him, but also the best. It strengthened his relationships with family and God and his resolve to do something worthwhile with his time.\nAlways goal oriented, he said he now aligns his goals with helping others. He chose to study information systems so he can use technology to improve the delivery of education or medical care.\n“I know from all the waiting rooms I’ve waited in, it makes your life a thousand times easier to lessen the wait,” he offered as an example.\nSatterwhite also participates in cancer-related events and organizations including Relay for Life, Hoops for Hope and the Aaron Bonner Foundation, founded in memory of a Howard University student who lost his life to cancer.\nVoting for the $100,000 grand prize tuition contest closes Oct. 19. There are smaller tuition awards available until January, but Satterwhite is aiming high. Paying off his student loans would let him concentrate on tackling his medical bills.\n“My parents have kept the (dollar amount) away from me because they don’t want me to worry about that,” he said\nBut he does.\nSatterwhite’s essay can be viewed and voted on at Voteforsyd.com .\nContact the writer: community@pe.com", "external_links": ["http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/twitter-ico.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nvjzz5-b88526965z.120151001111123000gjdc9q1a.10.jpg", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/fb-ico.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nvjzz5-b88526965z.120151001111123000gjdc9q1a.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nvjzz5-b88526965z.120151001111123000gjdc9q1d.10.jpg", "http://assets.pinterest.com/js/pinmarklet.js?r=", "http://voteforsyd.com/", "http://s7.addthis.com/js/250/addthis_widget.js#username=YOUR-ACCOUNT-ID", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/mail-ico.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nvjzz5-b88526965z.120151001111123000gjdc9q1d.10.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T08:23:23.647+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
