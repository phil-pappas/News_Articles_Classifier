McNulty returned as the Mean Green's starting quarterback and played for the first and last time in that stadium on Saturday.\nThe experience was a bittersweet one for the senior, who made a few plays and a few mistakes in a 62-16 loss to the Hawkeyes on a day of homecomings for the Mean Green.\nUNT head coach Dan McCarney also grew up in Iowa City, played for Iowa and spent time as an Iowa assistant.\n\"When I first stepped onto the field there were a lot of emotions. I took a moment, took it all in, then moved on and worried about the game,\" McNulty said.\nThe return to Iowa has become something of an old story for McCarney, who had been back as the head coach for Iowa State, as well as the defensive coordinator for Wisconsin.\n\"There are a lot of great memories and a lot of tough ones like today,\" McCarney said.\nThe Mean Green (0-3) never really mounted much of a challenge on a day Iowa quarterback C.J. Beathard seemingly connected on everything he threw. Beathard completed his first 15 passes and went on to throw for 278 yards on 18 of 21 passing with two touchdowns to lead Iowa (4-0).\n\"They executed better than we did,\" UNT defensive end Jarrian Roberts said. \"Our job up front is to hold the line and get to the quarterback. We just didn't make enough plays.\"\nMcNulty threw for 137 yards, but completed just 14 of his 36 passes. Both McNulty and backup Josh Greer threw interceptions that were returned for touchdowns.\nUNT rushed for 183 yards, more than triple the 51.0 yards Iowa was giving up per game. Jeffrey Wilson tallied 74 yards and Antoinne Jimmerson 66.\nTrevor Moore hit a 38-yard field goal before UNT cashed in on a key Iowa turnover. The Hawkeyes tried a reverse, but misfired on a pitch. UNT linebacker Anthony Wallace recovered the Derrick Mitchell fumble at the Iowa 6.\nOn the next play, wide receiver Carlos Harris threw a 6-yard touchdown pass to tight end Chris Loving after taking a pitch from McNulty, cutting UNT's deficit to 28-13.\n\"We felt like we had some momentum there,\" Wilson said.\nThat momentum vanished in a flash when Iowa quickly put together an 11-play, 80-yard scoring drive that Jordan Canzeri capped with a 3-yard touchdown run.\nIowa went on to outscore UNT 27-3 in the second half.\nCanzeri's touchdown essentially ended any slim hopes UNT had. The loss also left UNT in a tough spot. The Mean Green are 0-3 for the first time since 2011 and have already dropped their Conference USA opener to Rice.\nThat wasn't close to what UNT was looking for on a day McNulty and McCarney returned home.\n\"It was different,\" McNulty said of playing back in his hometown. \"It was the last time I will get to experience it. I wasn't satisfied with the result. We are going to keep working hard and try to get better.\"\nFollow Brett Vito on Twitter at @brettvito .\nOn Twitter:\n @brettvito", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/brettvito", "https://twitter.com/brettvito"], "published": "2015-09-27T04:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T19:19:51.275+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
