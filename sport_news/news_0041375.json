That doesn't make them any less important, as star players continue to drop like flies due to injury, and bye weeks don't make filling lineups any easier. \nHere are a few players who may be off the radar that could surprise in Week 6. 1. Jay Cutler, quarterback, Chicago Bears \nThe idea of starting Jay Cutler is enough to scare most fantasy owners these days. Over the last few years, Cutler has put together enough cringe-worthy performances that he has lost any goodwill he had ever built in the fantasy football world. Still, he has at least 250 yards and two touchdowns in the last two weeks, and this week he gets a Detroit defense that has struggled mightily against the pass. If ever there was a time to take a chance on Cutler, this is it. 2. Ronnie Hillman, running back, Denver Broncos \nRonnie Hillman's role in the Broncos' offense is a bit inconsistent, but the matchup against the Cleveland Browns is worth the risk. Denver will likely be playing with a lead for much of this game, and the Browns have been among the worst teams in the league at stopping the run. If Hillman gets the carries, he should be able to reward fantasy owners bold enough to plug him into the lineup. 3. Marvin Jones, wide receiver, Cincinnati Bengals \nThe Bengals' offense has a tough matchup against the Buffalo Bills' defense, so they may to rely on some unlikely sources for offense. Stephon Gilmore should be able keep A.J. Green quiet enough. That could mean more targets for Marvin Jones, who has turned the only two games in which he was targeted more than five times into 10 catches for over 150 yards and a touchdown. He's worth a shot. 4. Bishop Sankey, running back, Tennessee Titans \nBishop Sankey hasn't been getting a ton of work in the Titans' backfield, but that should change if Tennessee runs the ball like it should against Miami this week. The Dolphins could come out fired up coming out of the bye week, but if the run defense plays like it did in the first month of the season, Sankey should benefit. 5. Chicago Bears defense \nIt's not always easy to find sleeper defenses, but the Chicago Bears could qualify this week. They are hitting the road to play the Detroit Lions, who turned the ball over at will in Week 5. Matthew Stafford is beat up and playing behind a struggling offensive line. The Lions have no running game to speak of, and the Bears have actually been putting some pressure on the quarterback in the last few weeks.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T19:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T20:54:25.265+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
