The Niners fell to the Hawks (3-4) 20-3. After finding some kind of success with their offense the past two weeks, the 49ers sputtered to an embarrassing loss. \nThe prime-time beatdown was another piece in a disappointing season for the 49ers. They entered the season with hopes of turning last year’s underachievement around and getting back to the Super Bowl. But, so far, the results are not going to help the 49ers playoff chances.

He was able to stretch his string of games without an interception into Week 7. He’s now gone without a pick in three consecutive games. \nKaepernick is now 1-6 against the Seahawks in his career, including the playoffs. The 49ers fell to 2-5 and into last place in the NFC West. The Seahawks have won the past three meetings by a combined score of 56-13. \nNiners head coach Jim Tomsula was embarrassed and disheartened as he talked to reporters after the game. The 49ers were blown out by the Seahawks for the second straight year at home. Tomsula was somber, via Comcast Sportsnet . \n“That game today was not what we want,” Tomsula said. “It was not acceptable. We did not play well. We don’t have an excuse. Again, that lies right here and we need to do a better job. We’re going to take the next few days and get after that.” \nTomsula is in his first year as head coach of the 49ers. He replaced Jim Harbaugh, who was released and is currently coaching the Michigan Wolverines. Harbaugh took the 49ers to three NFC Championship games and a Super Bowl appearance. Following that performance will be a huge task. [Photo by Thearon W. Henderson/Getty Images] \nThe 49ers have some decisions to make before they play the St. Louis Rams. The players aren’t concerned. They feel as though they match up well with any team in the NFL. The way the 49ers played Thursday night doesn’t support that theory. \nThe 49ers’ numbers were anemic. They only managed 142 yards of total offense. That signals a total domination by the Seattle defense. Fifty-five of those yards came in the first half. The 49ers ended up with more punts (9) than first downs (8). \nRussell Wilson and the Seahawks began their beatdown of the 49ers early. Wilson completed 10 of his first 12 passes and finished with 235 yards passing, and Lynch ran for 122 yards after vomiting on the sideline in the first half, something Pete Carroll said was caused by him getting winded during a busy opening drive. Seattle won for the first time in four road games this season, avoiding another fourth-quarter collapse. \nWhen asked if he believes the 49ers could still make the playoffs, Tomsula answered, “We’re going to fight every day to make the playoffs. As long as there’s a chance to make the playoffs, we’re going to fight like crazy to get to the playoffs.” \nThe 49ers have a lot to repair before the next key NFC West matchup. The Seahawks beat the 49ers for the fourth consecutive time. The game was never in question after a 49ers three-and-out to open the game and the Seahawks touchdown scoring drive to cap the victory. \nThe Niners were dominated in every facet of the game. The bright spot on defense was two picks of Russell Wilson. But the offense wasn’t able to capitalize on the turnovers. That may have given the game a different outcome. Instead, it was another Seahawks beat down. \n[Feature Photo by Ezra Shaw / Getty Images]", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T19:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T20:24:06.495+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
