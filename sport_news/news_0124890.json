The 41-year-old was a member of Carroll's staff at Southern Cal from 2001-03 and 2005-08. He then served as the University of Washington's head coach from 2008-2013, leaving the Huskies to take the job at USC.\nWhen asked about Sarkisian in his Monday press conference at the Virginia Mason Athletic Center in Renton, Carroll said he was rooting for his former assistant.\n\"I think this is an opportunity for Sark to get right and to get well,' Carroll said. \"Pulling for him. He's up against some big challenges, and he's got to ahead and take care of it. It's not about coaching now. It's about his personal life and getting things in order and I know he's committed to taking the right steps to do that, and this is hugely important to him.\"\nIn August, Sarkisian appeared to be drunk during a pep rally when he disparaged other Pac-12 schools and used obscene language in front of USC boosters.\nOn Sunday, Athletic director Pat Haden put Sarkisian on indefinite leave after Sarkisian reportedly showed up drunk to the Trojans' practice earlier in the day. Just one day later, Haden announced his decision to fire the head coach after just one full season.\nOffensive coordinator Clay Helton will be the Trojans' interim head coach.\nCarroll said he would do what he could to be a good friend to Sarkisian in the aftermath of his firing.\n\"I'll be there to support him,\" Carroll said. \"I know him before and I think there's a lot to offer the world. It's been hard on him, and he's made it hard on people around him, too, and he knows that. He's got to take the steps to take care of business now.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T03:44:29.426+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
