Like a baseball switch hitter, he can hurt his team either way, with alcohol or marijuana. \nGilbert brings a little more of the Fall Classic flavor to the mess after he drove into a ditch at the end of a high speed chase in a road rage incident. Before Gilbert crashed his car, he flung a cup of tobacco juice on the other vehicle. \nGilbert was taken eighth in the first round, compared to 22nd for Manziel. An alleged cornerback, Gllbert hasn't even had Manziel's brief flashes of exciting play, although Gilbert certainly will claim he has. \nStill, all the headlines go to the former Johnny Football, a sensation on Twitter, Facebook and the world of TMZ, if not that of professional football. \nIn every instance with these players, the Browns have been more afraid of airing their dirty laundry in public than of publicly confronting what has happened in open and honest dialogue with reporters and, through them, their fans. \nEveryone lawyers up so much in sports these days that no one wants to blow it by violating the players' due process. You know, the way NFL commissioner Roger Goodell and his cockamamie legal department have done with Ray Rice, Adrian Peterson and Tom Brady. \nBut is it possible that \"handling it internally\" is a form of denial? Is the players' right to privacy greater than the resources for treatment? \nThink of how much domestic abuse, child abuse, drug abuse and alcohol abuse have been empowered by not talking about it and by keeping it in the family. \nDespite the many seemingly sincere words of contrition Gordon and Manziel have offered, the Browns' culture of private admonition and discipline hasn't exactly encouraged personal accountability. Both Manziel and Gordon have been a classic backsliders. \nGordon reacted to a failed test by blaming others' second-hand smoke. \nManziel complained when he did not get the starter's job after his big plays against the Titans. Why stay on the straight and narrow if he wasn't going to play anyway? \nFor his part, Gilbert denied culpability. \"Other than one play, it was flawless for me,\" he said after a spotty exhibition game performance against Washington. \nWhat if Mike Pettine \"handled it externally\" or \"dealt with it for everyone to see\"? Better yet, what if general manager Ray Farmer or owner Jimmy Haslam did that? \nHow much of a difference in everyone's lives would it make if an authority figure with the Browns had said, \"Johnny is a young man who has a lot of problems. Some are common to every player his age, and some are particular to wealthy young men who live public lives in the spotlight. He's had trouble with alcohol. He's had trouble controlling his emotions. He has trouble making good life decisions that affect others.\" \n\"We think he can be a valuable football player,\" the Browns could conclude, \"and we're doing what we can to help. But ultimately, he has to grow up.\" \nPrivacy isn't sacrosanct for repeat offenders. If the players union and the players' agents object, and there is no doubt they would, the Browns would have a ready response: \n\"If they don't like it, they can stop embarrassing themselves, their teammates, their employers and their fans.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T14:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T17:04:43.806+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
