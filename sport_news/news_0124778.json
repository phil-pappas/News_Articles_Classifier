(AP) - The Jackson budget that went into effect Thursday includes revenue from proposed higher fees for admission to the Davis Planetarium, more for traffic accident reports, more to rent space at Smith Robertson Museum and Cultural Center, and more for other services.\nHowever, Jackson Councilman Tyrone Hendrix tells The Clarion-Ledger ( http://on.thec-l.com/1QOWqBk ) it's his understanding the higher fees can't go into effect until the City Council officially approves the increases.\nMichael Raff, the city's deputy director for cultural services, said the proposed fee increases are expected to be presented to the council in a week or two.\nJackson Director of Administration Trivia Jones said fees aren't a big part of the city's budget. She said during budget hearings that the city looked at raising fees that hadn't been raised in a long time.\nInformation from: The Clarion-Ledger, http://www.clarionledger.com\n ", "external_links": ["http://on.thec-l.com/1QOWqBk"], "published": "2015-10-02T14:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T17:50:37.328+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
