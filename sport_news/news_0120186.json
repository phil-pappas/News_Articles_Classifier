(Julie Jacobson / AP) Steve Dilbeck \nAll season long – no even before it began – the Dodgers have had two great starting pitchers and then a whole bundle of questions. The answers proved difficult to come by. \nNow for the Dodgers to advance in the postseason, it will have to be behind their two high-quality starting pitchers – Clayton Kershaw and Zack Greinke. \nKershaw is first up with the Dodgers left in a must-win situation after being embarrassed, 13-7, Monday by the Mets at Citi Field in Game 3 of their National League division series.

Game 4, a potential series clincher for the Mets, is Tuesday against Kershaw. If he can force a decisive Game 5 back in Los Angeles, Greinke will get the call. \nThat was the plan last season, too, and it did not work out so well against the Cardinals. \nMonday the Dodgers started left-hander Brett Anderson, signed to be the No. 5 starter before the season, but he was pushed into the third spot after early injuries to Brandon McCarthy and Hyun-Jin Ryu. He did not respond well to his first postseason appearance as Dodger, lasting just three innings. \nAfter he departed Monday night, No. 4 starter Alex Wood took over and got hammered too. \nThings looked briefly encouraging for the Dodgers in the top of the second when the jumped out to a 3-0 lead against Matt Harvey, who in truth, looked fairly beatable Monday. \nBut the Mets came back with four runs of their own in the bottom of the inning against Anderson and the beating was on. \nCurtis Granderson had three-run and two-run doubles to finish with five RBIs. Travis d’Amaud had a two-run homer and Yoenis Cespedes a three-run homer. The Mets finished with 13 hits, making most of them count. Nine of their first 10 runs came with two outs. \nThe Dodgers added three late runs in the ninth on a three-run homer by Howie Kendrick, but it was deep into the too little, too late category. \nNow after nine long months, the Dodgers officially have their backs pressed so firmly against the wall the can feel the pores in the brink. \nAfter all the pregame attention to Chase Utley, when the game began it was all baseball. Or at least Mets baseball.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T07:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T00:30:36.423+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
