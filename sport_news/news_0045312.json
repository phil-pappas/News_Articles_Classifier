Just not being out there is kind of hurting me, but I'm happy to be back this week and I'm excited.\" \nWilliams did not feel the effects of the concussion until the Monday following the Titans game. \nHe had a brief talk with veteran cornerback Tramon Williams, and the Super Bowl winning defender recommended he report the symptoms, which included headaches, to the Browns' medical staff. Shortly thereafter, Williams was put in the NFL Concussion Protocol. \n\"It was a couple hits, but I didn't feel funny,\" Williams recalled. \"I felt a little funny throughout the week, and it just kept getting worse and worse. So I mentioned it to our trainers, and they did a great job, Joe Sheehan and those guys in there, and they kind of held me back and just to be precautionary, they put me in the protocol. \n\"Certain circumstances like I was in, I think it was important for me to say something because I have a previous history of this. So when I was feeling funny, I kind of knew what it was. I just brought it upon myself to tell somebody.\" \nCounting the one from the win over the Titans, Williams has now suffered three concussions in just 15 NFL games, and his teammates have done a lot in the way of counseling him when it comes to making tackles while protecting himself at the same time. \n\"With K'Waun, he has that killer instinct,\" Browns cornerback Joe Haden said. \"He has that dog in him basically that you look for in the secondary, but sometimes, with K'Waun, I tell him too, and when he's saying play smarter, K'Waun, he loves the game so much, he plays so hard that he takes unnecessary shots. \n\"He'll just throw his head in there sometimes just because that's the way that he plays. I try to tell him, 'K.K., sometimes, you don't have to throw them up top. Just go low, take out their legs, keep your head out of there, and you'll be good. More of just not always trying to impose your will on them. Sometimes, K., it's cool to just take them down, chop down the legs and you'll be good.' \n\"He means a lot to the defense, man. He's one of the best nickel backs I've been around. He's a very, very smart football player, very tough football player. As far as the slots, covering those guys, he has the quickness laterally. He understands slot concepts. He understands what slot receivers are trying to do against him, uses his leverage. He blitzes so well off the nickel back, so he's a special part of our defense and we need him.\" \nAdmitting that he has to play the game in a smarter way, Williams plans on doing everything within his power to protect himself, but still be an aggressive defender. \n\"It's something I've got to adjust,\" Williams said. \"I still play the game aggressively. I still make the plays that I've got to make. Most of my concussions have been friendly fire or I hit my head off the ground. I've never really had a concussion leading with my head because I don't lead with my head. \n\"I still have to be aggressive and still have to make the plays. You're in there to do a job, and I've got to do it by any means.\" \nWhen asked about considering retirement after suffering his third concussion, Williams said, \"I don't really want to get into that.\" Rather, he plans on using his love for the game to help the Browns. \n\"I've got a great grasp of what's going on,\" Williams said. \"I know the risk factor in terms of long term, but right now, I still want to play the game. I've still got a lot of football left in me and I still love to do what I do. I come to work happy and I progress through the day like I normally would. \n\"I still love this game. It's something I love to do. I know what my body is telling me. I still feel good. I'm still happy. I know the risk. I know what I'm risking. I still want to play this game.\" Read or Share this story: http://on.wkyc.com/1LlNMKz TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T18:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T18:39:07.704+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
