Remember that John has been having a lot of quality work at Finch Farm (club's training ground) and it will be a matter of just getting that match fitness,\" Martinez told the club's website (www.evertonfc.com). \n\"We have still got three very important days ahead of that fixture in terms of preparation so we'll get a better idea on Friday of where John is. \n\"I would say medically he is ready now. He's been joining the group and from a medical point of view I don't think there is a concern or worry,\" the former Wigan Athletic manager added. \nThe Toffees lie seventh in the Premier League table with 13 points from eight matches. \n(Reporting by Shravanth Vijayakumar in Bengaluru; Editing by Amlan Chakraborty ) \nOur top photos from the last 24 hours.
