Racing Coverage See our RSS feeds \nJoey Logano’s thoughts were mixed when he drove into Victory Lane on Sunday at Charlotte Motor Speedway. \nWhile he was thrilled to win the race, he was equally relieved to know his playoff hopes won’t rely on surviving next week’s race at NASCAR’s most notorious minefield, Talladega Superspeedway. \n“Obviously, we can all talk about Talladega and how special it is to get through to the next round because the pressure that a lot of these drivers are going to have on them, that we had on us when this race started, to get to the next round is big,” Logano said. \n“To be able to have that pressure off of us and to be able to relax and enjoy this next round, don’t get me wrong, there are still two trophies to win, but to have that pressure off and be able to have our batteries charged up and ready to attack when we get to the next round is going to pay big dividends.” \nPressure on the remaining 11 drivers in the playoffs will intensify during Sunday’s race at Kansas Speedway. It’s their last chance to win a golden ticket to the third round and not have to worry about avoiding one of Talladega’s multi-car crashes. \n“I’ll be honest with you, Talladega is still there,” Martin Truex Jr. said. \nRacing at the 2.66-mile raceway usually involves three-wide, 10-deep packs of traffic. The turbulence created makes cars more difficult to control. \nBecause cars are required to use a restrictor plate on the engine to reduce speeds for safety reasons, nobody has enough power to break away from the rest of the pack. That usually leads to huge pileups — and dramatic dashes to the finish line, where the difference between first and 15th place is less than a half-second. \nChase rules call for the four lowest-ranked drivers in the playoffs to be eliminated every three races. Kevin Harvick, Jamie McMurray, Clint Bowyer and Paul Menard all struggled in the opening race of the first round. With only two races to erase the mistakes, Harvick was the only driver to recover — and he needed a win at Dover, Del., to do it — and advance. \nNow Ryan Newman, Kyle Busch, Dale Earnhardt Jr. and Matt Kenseth have to make a similar rally. They left Charlotte as the bottom four drivers in the standings. \nFor them, Talladega may offer a unique opportunity to move to the third round. \n“It ain’t over,” Earnhardt said. “Don’t worry about that. I mean, we don’t have to go to Talladega and be nervous like those guys that are going to have to play it safe. We can just go hard. \n“So, we’ve got a great car that can win that race. We can go to Kansas and run great. I like that track and don’t see why we can’t run great there and maybe win the race there. It ain’t over.” \nBrad Keselowski avoided the second round cut a year ago with a win at Talladega. While anything — and everything — is possible at the track, most are leery of counting on success there. \n“I mean, there’s just so many unknowns there,” Truex said. “You’re really just trying to survive, but it’s nearly impossible. It’s out of your control. ... My outlook the last few times we’ve went there has been try to stay at the front, try to lead laps, try to keep the thing at the front the most you can, and even that is no guarantee. \n“It’s stressful, you know, for sure. There are going to be some sleepless nights that week no doubt for a lot of people. \n“And then again, that’s why there’s so much effort being put into Charlotte and Kansas.” \nWith the victory, Logano’s team doesn’t have to fret over Talladega. \nWith that in mind, Logano can have fun at Kansas because he has nothing to lose. \nEveryone else has so much to gain.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T04:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T18:11:03.437+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
