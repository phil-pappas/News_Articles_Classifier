Esler, the Crocus quarterback, finished with 36 yards on the ground and was 13-for-20 passing for 130 yards and two interceptions. \n“The kids played their asses off. I was very proud of them,” said Crocus head coach Kevin Boyd. \nReilly Keele added 54 rushing yards to the Plainsmen attack, while Bryce Parnetta caught five passes for 68 yards. \nCole Kardash made six tackles on defence and also forced a safety touch on special teams. \nSteven Butson added three tackles and a sack for Crocus, while Cordell Chartrand made four tackles. \nMike Olive kicked a 27-yard field goal and a convert to round out the scoring for Crocus. \nThe Plainsmen close out the regular season on Thursday when they host the Kildonan East Reivers. \n» The Brandon Sun Rate this This article has not yet been rated.
