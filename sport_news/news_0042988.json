The Indians have won three of those games (Dunbar, Bourbon County and Woodford County) and lost the other two (Lexington Catholic and Bryan Station). \n“That tells you a lot about our team,” Central coach Mark Scenters said of the outcome of the past five games. “When things are going well, then we are pretty good. When things are not going well, we struggle. So, that’s something that we have to really focus on and really do a good job of helping our kids figure out.” \nThe Indians will be looking to develop some kind of positive consistency when they open up district play today against Tates Creek (2-4) in Lexington. \nGame time is set for 7:30 p.m. \nCentral had last week off, but their past two games really showcase the extremes they’ve experienced so far this season. \nOn Sept. 18 in Richmond, the Indians were blasted by Lexington Catholic, 41-0, in front of disappointed Homecoming crowd. \nA week later, they went to Versailles and completely dominated Woodford County, 55-0. \n“We went to Woodford with a little bit of a chip on our shoulder and we were ready to play football,” Scenters said. “That was huge. It was a rainy night, but our kids went and had fun playing on a rainy night.” \nIn the win over Woodford, the Indians forced five turnovers, scored two defensive touchdowns and allowed just 151 yards of total offense. Senior Johan Williams had 204 yards rushing and three touchdowns, including a 98-yard TD run. \nCentral did not have a turnover and finished with 309 yards rushing. \n“As well as we played against Woodford, we are going to have to up that level tremendous the next three weeks,” Scenters said. \nThe next three games — all against district opponents — will determine Central’s postseason positioning. \nNext week, the Indians will take on Lafayette at home before traveling to long-time rival Clark County. \nTates Creek was also off last week. \nThe Commodores have two of lost of their past three games heading into district play, with the only win coming against Madison Southern (30-20). \nCreek is averaging 33.5 points a game and most of that offense has come from the talented duo of Peyton Burke and Jackson Beerman. \nBurke, a senior quarterback, has thrown for most yards than any other 6A quarterback in the state so far year (1,349) and has 20 touchdowns and just three interceptions. \nBeerman, a junior wide receiver, has eight touchdown catches and 413 receiving yards. \n“(Beerman) is a big-play guy and Burke is very good,” Scenters said. “He’s got a good arm and he makes good decisions.” \nThe Commodores have five players with more than 100 yards receiving yards. Robbie Lofton has five TD catches and Jaden Baird has four touchdown receptions. \nCreek has more than 1,400 yards passing this season, which accounts for almost 70 percent of its offense. \n“They try to spread the field and in a lot of ways they look like a pass-heavy version of us,” Scenters said. “They have the ability to run the ball, but they are pretty good at what they do. They can put points on the board.” \nLast year, the Indians beat Creek 41-21 in Richmond. Williams had 114 yards rushing and Korrion Crier had 187 yards on 17 rushes with two touchdowns. \nCentral has won three of the past four meetings with the Commodores.
