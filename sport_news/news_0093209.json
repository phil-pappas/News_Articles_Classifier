The format of the league will be worked out in the next couple of days. We are hopeful that the league will help in making baseball popular,\" ABFI president Jasraj Mehta told reporters.\n\"Baseball faces a big challenge due to a dearth of good grounds in India. Baseball grounds matching international standards were almost nought in India. We are working on developing good grounds for baseball,\" he said.\nHe said that his priorities are good infrastructure for baseball, encourage players to take part in international tournaments and facilitate their foreign trips.\nABFI will organise separately senior and junior national baseball competitions in January and June next year respectively.
