The Missionaries trailed heading into halftime, but Lena de Guzman tied the game less than two minutes into the second half. The tie was Whitman’s second of Northwest Conference play and moved its overall record to 1-8-2 overall, and 1-4-2 in conference play. The Loggers remained unbeaten at 6-0-4 and 2-0-4, respectively. The Missionaries played primarily on the defensive side of the ball in the first half. Whitman goalie Haley Case kept busy, collecting two saves and facing four corners in the first 45 minutes. Puget Sound converted one corner into a goal in the 19th minute. Amalia Acorda-Fey connected with Emma Donckels, who sent a header into the back of the net, giving the Loggers a 1-0 advantage. Whitman wasted little time scoring in the second half; de Guzman sent a shot from outside the penalty box to the top-right of the net, tying the game at 1-1. Although, the Loggers were able to get a couple shots off in the latter part of the half, the Missionaries’ defense stayed strong, sending the game to overtime. The game took a turn toward the physical side in the first overtime period as Whitman and UPS combined for six fouls, with the Loggers receiving the first yellow card of the afternoon. Whitman next plays at Lewis & Clark on Sunday.
