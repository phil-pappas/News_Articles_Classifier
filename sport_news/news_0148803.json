Everyone comes to the field with a smile on his face and it makes it that much easier coming from another team.\"\nSince joining the Cubs on Aug. 31, Jackson has adjusted by playing right and left fields after playing center his entire career and is adjusting to spot duty while trying to earn a playoff spot.\n\"Time will really tell with that,\" said Jackson, who is batting .231 in 26 games since joining the Cubs from the Mariners. \"I'm trying to do whatever I can do to help the team win.\"\nIf selected, Jackson believes he can be an asset.\n\"It's a different animal in the playoffs, but … these guys definitely have the composure to win.\"\nSplit decisions: If Jason Hammel pitches in the playoffs, he likely will face the Cardinals in the National League Division Series.\nHammel pitched six shutout innings before being charged with three runs in the seventh inning of an 8-5 victory Sept. 8 at Busch Stadium. That was one of his few impressive starts in an otherwise rough second half.\n\"A tale of two halves,\" said Hammel, who lasted only one inning in his last start of the first half against the Cardinals because of a knee injury. \"Post-injury, I wasn't good. It's the honest view of it.\"\nHammel, who pitched five shutout innings Thursday to pick up the 5-3 victory over the Reds, had a 5-4 record and 2.86 ERA in the first half but his era was 5.10 in the second half though he went 5-3.\nPrivacy Policy Major League Baseball Austin Jackson Jason Hammel Seattle Mariners St. Louis Cardinals Cincinnati Reds Detroit Tigers", "external_links": ["http://www.tribpub.com/privacy-policy-and-your-privacy-rights/", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-560dd99a/turbine/ct-austin-jackson-playoffs-bits-cubs-spt-1002-20151001"], "published": "2015-10-02T04:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T21:05:39.095+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
