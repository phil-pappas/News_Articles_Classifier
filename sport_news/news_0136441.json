That moment led to some special experiences for the young fan.\nAt just 12 years old, Max can say his face is on a Major League Baseball card.\n“It's really cool. It's an honor,” Max said.\nMax and his dad where there when Moustakas caught a foul ball hit by Baltimore Orioles center fielder Adam Jones.\n“I got a whacking on the nose. I got a bloody nose but I’d do it all over again for sure,” Max said.\nMax held on to Moustakas tight that night, trying to keep the him from hitting the ground. That night, Moustakas pointed in approval to the fans who caught him. Then he did much more than that.\n\"It was really cool he said hi. He wrote on it (a custom bat), 'To Max, my catch was good. Your catch was great. Thanks for your help bro.' I thought that was really cool, and he signed it too,” Max said. \"It's something I'll have forever, that's for sure.\"\nThe Royals also handed out bobbleheads celebrating that play. Max even got to throw out the first pitch that night.\nA split-second play led to priceless memories, a signed bat, a baseball card appearance and a chance to throw a baseball to Moustakas himself.\nMax says he was so nervous the night he threw out the first pitch that he didn’t even wave to the fans. However, he got less nervous when he found out Moustakas would be the catcher, because he says no matter how he threw he knew he could catch it.\n“It just lets me know how much he appreciates fans,” Max said.\nMax hopes to soon call Moustakas a World Series champ.\n“It would be outstanding. That would just be awesome. I think we have a chance though that's for sure,” Max said.\nCopyright 2015 KCTV (Meredith Corp.)
