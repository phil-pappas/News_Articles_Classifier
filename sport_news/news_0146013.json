Only one local band can claim the title as the #1 High School Band in the Greater Lansing region. Is your band worthy? \nIf your high school band rocks on and off the field, enter them in the contest then gather your friends and family to vote! The 3 bands with most votes will be considered our finalists and be invited to our Greater Lansing High School Sports Awards Banquet, where the winner will be announced and presented with an award. Plus you'll get bragging rights! Good luck.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-07T23:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T09:21:05.086+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
