The social media platform has suggested a lack of team cohesiveness and exacerbated an ugly start to the 2015 season.\nAdChoices Two Texas underclassmen lashed out at junior Dylan Haines after the safety criticized the work ethic of younger players on the Longhorns' roster.\n\"They just want to go out and play the game on Saturday,\" Haines said earlier . \"They don't want to put in the work on Sunday and Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday. You can just kind of go through the motions in practice, or you can go out there and practice. ...We're trying to get where everyone — 100 percent of the people — on the team are just going out there stealing reps in practice. Just get as much done as you can.\"\nIn response, freshman defensive end Charles Omenihu tweeted, \"Lol.\"\n\"People get in front of the cameras and just talk they heads off,\" Omenihu added before deleting that tweet.\nAnd sophomore receiver Armanti Foreman tweeted in response to Haines: \"I walk around campus every day, no body guard, no security! If you have something to say please say it (to) me and stop hiding behind Twitter!\"\nTheir Twitter jabbering comes on the heels of freshman Kris Boyd's halftime tweet during a 50-7 pummeling against TCU on Saturday. Boyd re-tweeted a Texas A&M fan suggesting he transfer to the Aggies before later apologizing. \"In NO way did I intend to be disrespectful or disloyal,\" Boyd said in a statement after the game. He also apologized directly to the team, coach Charlie Strong said.\nA long Twitter message by freshman receiver DeAndre McNeal summed up the team's woes.\n\"We're supposed to be a team, but instead we're bashing each other,\" McNeal said. \"If you don't want to be here at Texas then kick rocks. We haven't won ANYTHING to have people calling out others.\"\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.usatoday.com/sports/", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "http://www.hookem.com/2015/10/05/texas-players-sniping-at-each-other-on-twitter/"], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T23:08:11.662+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
