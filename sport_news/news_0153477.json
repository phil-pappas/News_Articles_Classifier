There could be a bigger storm headed FedEx Field’s way. (Jonathan Newton/The Washington Post) \nThe Washington Redskins will aim for their second straight victory over the Philadelphia Eagles when the teams meet Sunday at 1 p.m. at Fed Ex Field in a game broadcast on Fox. The Redskins won the Week 16 meeting at FedEx Field 27-24. The lead the regular season series 81-73-5. \nThe Eagles also own a 1-2 record, but the oddsmakers have made them three-point favorites. The Eagles are 2-4 against the spread in their last six games against Washington. \nHere are five story lines to follow in this game. \n1. Weather conditions: Hurricane Joaquin apparently will blow on out to sea and not force the league to change the plans for this game. But it still could be pouring Sunday, and even if the rain has died down by then, some soggy conditions at FedEx Field. The Redskins want to pound the football regardless, and the conditions should suit them just fine. Look for a steady dose of Alfred Morris and Matt Jones. But ball security will be key. The running backs have practiced carrying wet footballs all week long, so they are prepared to deal with the poor conditions. The rushing attack is the strength of the offense. The Redskins rank fifth in the league, averaging 4.6 yards per carry and 143.7 rushing yards per game. The Eagles, meantime, rank 30th with 2.7 yards per carry and only 64.3 yards per game. Obviously, there will be times when both teams have to throw. But a wet ball will lead to errant throws, dropped passes, and possibly interceptions. \n2. Battered secondary: Soreness in his knee, quad and groin areas prevented cornerback Chris Culliver from finishing Wednesday’s practice and forced him out Thursday and Friday. The Redskins list Culliver as questionable for Sunday’s game. If he plays, it’s hard to say how effective he will be. If he doesn’t, that leaves Washington with Bashaud Breeland, Will Compton (signed off the streets two weeks ago) and Quinton Dunbar (promoted from the practice squad) as the only healthy cornerbacks. Fortunately for the Redskins, the Eagles haven’t had much production out of their wide receivers outside of Jordan Matthews (22 catches, 231 yards and a touchdown), and Sam Bradford has struggled (three touchdowns, four interceptions, 72.5 QB rating). But the Redskins have a history of being a get-right opponent. \n3. Turnover battle: The Redskins have forced only one turnover this season, and they have given away the ball six times (four interceptions, two fumbles). The Eagles, meantime, have forced eight turnovers (five interceptions, three fumbles). Philadelphia also has turned over the ball six times (four interceptions, two fumbles). Ball security very well could determine the outcome of this game. Redskins coaches have stressed the importance of the defense doing a better job of getting the ball back for the offense. However, with an injury-plagued secondary and an inconsistent pass rush, increasing takeaways will prove easier said than done. \n4. Cousins’s performance: The quarterback is coming off of a bad game at New York and needs to get back to the type of play he produced against St. Louis in Week 2. His ability to get the ball out of his hands quickly will help an offensive line that is basically starting three rookies now in right guard Brandon Scherff (three starts), right tackle Morgan Moses (four starts) and left guard Spencer Long (zero starts). But Cousins has to make better decisions. He started forcing things again last week as his team trailed, and that led to a pair of interceptions. If ugly losses begin to mount and Cousins’s ball security issues continue, Jay Gruden could have to reconsider his stance on Cousins being the starter for the season. A quality performance Sunday will help ease the heat on the quarterback, and his coach. \n5. Special teams play: Washington again proved incapable of avoiding disaster on special teams as the punt unit surrendered a block and safety. (Rashad Ross returned a kickoff for a touchdown late in the game, but it didn’t matter at that point). This week the Redskins face another tough test as they try to contain the talented Darren Sproles, who is averaging 16.8 yards per punt return, and last week scored on an 89-yard runback. The Redskins have lacked stability on their coverage units because of the season-long rash of injuries. At some point, however, they need to stop the bleeding and make an impact. \nMore from The Post :", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T23:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T23:17:30.819+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
