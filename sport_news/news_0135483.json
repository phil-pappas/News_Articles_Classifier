On Friday night, the Bishop Guertin Cardinals figured it was Housman's turn. Housman raced for 216 yards and three TDs on 16 carries as the Cardinals stunned the Titans, 54-14 at Stellos Stadium. \"My Dad showed me the papers, his name was all over them, and I didn't see my name anywhere, so I was motivated to show them,\" Housman said. \"We were motivated as a team. \"We had a very good week of practice, we knew what it meant.\" What it means is BG (5-2) is now in the driver's seat for the West Conference title with two games left. It was important for the Cardinals since a loss would have given them a tough time down the road in tiebreakers. North, meanwhile, fell to 4-3 but have a slightly easier schedule remaining to perhaps stay in the playoff mix. \"We talked about it all week that this was a playoff game,\" Guertin coach Jeff Moore said. \"We could see early (the Titans) were having a hard time with (Housman), so we said let's ride him. They had a hard time with him. He's a phenomenal athlete.\" Guertin jumped out to a 20-0 lead, led 34-7 at halftime, and it was running time (with 35-plus BG lead) four minutes into the third. \"We got our butts kicked in every phase, in every aspect,\" North coach Dante Laurendi said. \"Tackling, blocking, catching.... Just every phase. I knew they were very good, and I knew they were explosive (487 yard of offense), and their team speed defensively was probably the best we've seen.\" Leonard, in fact, was held to a pedestrian 44 yards on 17 carries, thanks in part to that speed. Housman opened the scoring with a 42-yard TD run four minutes into the game. About six minutes later, the Cards made it 12-0 on a Jordan Hiscoe 14-yard TD pass to Dylan Fagan. Hiscoe was 10 for 12 for 130 yards, three TDs and one interception. The Cards, just 30 seconds later, got a Titan gift, when Chase Hughes picked off a Jeff Baldassari pass and returned it 25 yards to paydirt. A two-point conversion made it a 20-0 Cardinals lead. Still, North seemed to regain momentum as its other QB, Jared Levesque, capped an eight-play march with a 9-yard TD flip to Steve Lambert with 10:38 left in the half, cutting the deficit to 20-7. Leonard then picked off Hiscoe on the next series and the Titans had the ball at midfield and lots of energy. But their drive went nowhere, and two BG TDs in the final 3:52 of the half accounted for the 27 point halftime difference. \"The defense played great,\" Moore said. \"We tried to keep things real simple.\" First, the Cards took just four plays to score with Hiscoe rambling in from 17 yards out to make it a 26-7 game with 3:52 left in the half. Fagan picked off Levesque near midfield, and four plays later Housman ran it in from 14 yards out. The Cards expanded their lead to 46-7 four minutes into the third with a Hiscoe to Nick Lorden 35-yard TD connection, and another TD pass from Hiscoe, this one to Matt Theriault for 38 yards. Housman (a 9-yard run) and North's Levi Gosselin (a 15-yard TD reception) accounted for the rest of the scoring. Perhaps also motivating BG was the controversy surrounding Moore, who resigned from the Lowell (Mass.) Police Department after being caught on camera asleep in his cruiser during his shift. \"It was a tough week for him but we played for him,\" Housman said. \"He's happy now.\" And so are the Cardinals.
