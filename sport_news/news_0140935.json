(Photo: Mike Carter - USA Today Sports) \nEAST LANSING — Michigan State coach Mark Dantonio often says he doesn’t discuss injuries, but he always does when the injury is season-ending in nature. \nSo perhaps the lack of any announcement Sunday night about the status of left tackle Jack Conklin and his left knee means Conklin — who watched the second half of Saturday’s 30-10 victory over Central Michigan in street clothes and a knee brace — isn’t in danger of missing the rest of the season. Or maybe it means MSU simply doesn’t have all the test results back yet, which is possible because an MRI can’t happen until swelling goes down. \nOr maybe Dantonio just didn’t feel like talking. Either way, the guessing game continues as the second-ranked, banged-up Spartans (4-0) prepare for Saturday’s homecoming game and Big Ten opener against 1-3 Purdue (noon, ESPN2). \nDantonio did have some encouraging evaluations and two “winning” grades for a pair of reserves who could see bigger roles in the near future. A “winning” evaluation for a game performance at MSU is bested only by a “championship” grade. Couch: MSU, U-M intrigue buoyed by Utah's Duck thumping \nSophomore left tackle Dennis Finley (Detroit Cass Tech), thrown in Saturday to replace Conklin in the second quarter, got an early holding call and then got better. \n“This was his first opportunity with a lot of football plays, and he got better and better as the game went,” Dantonio said. “And I thought he played winning football. He did exactly what he needs to do. He’s a big guy, he was exceptionally sudden and pass-blocked well. Had one holding call but other than that I thought played very well.” \nJunior cornerback Darian Hicks also graded “winning” for his play, all in the second half, after MSU initially planned to hold him out with a minor injury. Hicks and Arjen Colquhoun played cornerback, with Demetrious Cox moving from corner to replace Montae Nicholson at free safety. \nNicholson, who has struggled early in his sophomore season, returned later because senior safety RJ Williamson left with a right leg injury. Rexrode: MSU can forget playoff with this defense \n“Montae needed to play better,” Dantonio said. “He has played more of a (strong safety) position, which may be what he needs to play, I’m not sure but we will look at that this week. We need to have a guy playing better at (free safety) in a game, so we went in that direction and gave Darian Hicks a shot at the corner position and he played well. Cox played well at the safety position.” CONNECT 3 TWEET LINKEDIN 2 COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://on.lsj.com/1KFgN2g TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-28T14:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T03:48:37.772+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
