In addition, I’ve solicited advice from long-time observers and scoured our archives for nuggets of information, all in an effort to identify some of the athletes who have helped drive that passion over the years.\nIn the first of our five-part series, we’re looking at some of the best linebackers and defensive backs ever to patrol the area gridiron. The names I came up with span a half-century, provide glimpses into the rich history of local high school football and are sure to spark some fond memories.\nIn the coming weeks, we will be rolling out the rest of our series, including linemen, both offensive and defensive (Oct. 20), receivers (Oct. 27), quarterbacks (Nov. 3) and running backs (Nov. 10).
