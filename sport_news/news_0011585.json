In Friday’s 4-2 win over Sacramento State, the senior scored twice, including the eventual match-winner, as Weber State scored three times in the opening 50 minutes of action. \nIn Sunday’s 4-1 win over Portland State, Bair scored the Wildcats’ third goal on a cross from junior midfielder Chansi Crompton . This season, Bair has three goals and four assists, for 10 points, and is third on the team in total offensive points. She currently ranks ninth in Weber State’s career scoring charts with 14 career goals. It’s her second career weekly Big Sky honor and her first of the season. \nClayton, a native of Layton, Utah, helped anchor a Wildcat defense that allowed just 13 total shots on goal in 180 minutes and three goals, two of which were penalty kicks. She played all 180 minutes during the weekend and also recorded five shots. \nAgainst Sacramento State on Friday, Clayton helped the Wildcats limit the Hornets to just seven shots on frame and one goal during the run of play. The Hornets had four of their seven shots on frame after Weber State had built a 4-1 advantage in the second half. \nIn a 4-1 win over Portland State on Sunday, Clayton and the Wildcats limited the Vikings to just five shots on goal after a third-minute penalty kick, with three of those coming after Weber State had built its three-goal advantage in the second half. \nThis season, Clayton has started all 15 matches for the Wildcats and recorded a team-high 1,272 minutes of action. This is her first career weekly award. \nWeber State is back in action for its final home match of the season on Sunday, when the Wildcats host Montana at noon at Wildcat Soccer Field. The match will be Senior Day for the Purple and White, with eight seniors — including Bair and Clayton — set to be honored.
