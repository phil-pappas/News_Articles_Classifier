Here are some highlights from his press conference:\nOn how he'd assess the offense through five games:\n\"Inconsistent. Again, I continue to feel that we've got to be able to run the football in a better way. At times we had some plays the other day when we did run it that we did run it. Probably need to run it a little bit more at times. The passing game too, too inconsistent. We've gotta do a few things in a better way.\"\nOn where the responsibility lies between coaches and players in a loss:\n\"It's a college game. I'm not going to sit here and call out [players]. Bottom line is you talk about it, you show them why...we [the coaches] did our part. We showed them 100 times. We went through two years ago, the Texas game, where they're ranked and where we're ranked and what's happening. You show it to them and show it to them. We even showed them 10 minutes of the game of them beating us. They've gotta choose to be ready to play. I can't figure out why that would be, a 20-year-old or 21-year-old, when you only get to play so many times and you have a rivalry game that they're not [ready]. I didn't feel that way. That might be their excuse. The bottom line is that we got out-executed. I didn't feel that way. I felt like we had a good week of practice, felt like we came in the game knowing we needed to play well. You get in the game and they out-execute you and get charged up, then it appears that they're excited and we're not. I guarantee you had we scored a touchdown, kicked off to them, recovered their fumble and scored a little bit later, we'd be the ones charged up. I think that's young people. I don't buy they weren't ready to play. Again, you could put it all on me, but I don't play.\"\nOn how Texas did well offensively without throwing the ball very much:\n\"They started with the lead and continued to run the football because we never forced their hand, meaning we never scored points to put them into a position that they're gonna have to throw. The two series after the initial 14 points, we really did play good defense and gave up the one sprint draw. If we don't give up the sprint draw, who knows? We've got a chance to be in it, just like we did with Tennessee to have a chance to win it in the fourth quarter or overtime, but they make the one play with the draw to spring it. The way we started, them being up 14 points and us not being able to score, allowed them to play it close to the vest and continue to run it just like they did two years ago.\"\nOn if he thinks Samaje Perine should get more touches:\n\"I'd like to be able to see us run it better and more productive with him being a part of that. Can we do it? We're going to keep trying.\"\nOn if the receiving corps regressed against Texas:\n\"That's fair to say. We weren't as productive, obviously, as we were against West Virginia. It's probably fair to say.\"\nOn he makes sure Lincoln Riley involves the running backs:\n\"It's what is being productive for us and what is working for us. Can the offensive line do what we're asking them to do? That's something we'll talk about.\"\nOn how the defense will prepare for Kansas State's run-pass option plays:\n\"They're actually run plays and [the quarterback] just decides to throw it at the last second. You've gotta do a great job with your eyes, key your keys and be able to lock onto a guy who is coming through the middle of the defense. Is he blocking or going out for a pass? A lot of times, like you said, it's a designed run and he's running down the middle and can throw it at any time. We've gotta keep our eyes on him and be aware of him.\"\nOn if Baker Mayfield might be holding on to the ball too long during games:\n\"I'm sure on the sideline coach Riley is talking to him about it that there's a time or two if he'd hung on to it for a little bit that a route's coming open. Hang in there and deliver it. When you're not the one that the bullets are hitting it's easy to sit there from afar and say, 'Oh he should have done this.' Baker, through these other games, has really done a good job in a lot of ways. And maybe too had so much success with his feet that he wants to trust in them a little too much which can lead to trouble. It did the other day.\"\nClick here to watch Stoops' full 39-minute presser .\nTwitter: @Josh_Friemel\nOn Twitter:\n @Josh_Friemel", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/Josh_Friemel", "http://www.soonersports.com/mediaPortal/player.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=31000", "https://twitter.com/Josh_Friemel"], "published": "2015-10-12T22:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T06:13:48.189+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
