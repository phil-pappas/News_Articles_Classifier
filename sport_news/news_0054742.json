In a 21-13 win at Linden on Oct. 9, Howard ran the ball 21 times for 86 yards, both team-highs. \n“He’s had the biggest impact on the offense, He hasn’t had 300-yard games but he’s certainly had the biggest impact,” said head coach Casey Kester. “He’s turned into a beast these past few games.” \nHoward, who has played football for nine years, also sees minutes on the defensive side of the ball. But Kester and his coaching staff elected to have Howard focus on offense prior to the Bret Harte-Calaveras game, and since then he has been effective between the tackles. \n“It was just a matter of the staff deciding to have him focus on offense and not split his attention,” Kester said. “He’s a very good linebacker for us, but we decided his power bubble was bigger on offense. And it’s really paid off; he’s really started running well.” \nHoward is a wrestler for the Bullfrogs as well, having taken to the mat for two seasons now. He hopes that he can help his football team move the chains toward a league championship and a playoff berth. \n“With the strength and conditioning program we’ve put in, he gets stronger in the fourth quarter,” said Kester. “We put up 21 points on Linden in the fourth. He wears teams down. They don’t want anything to do with him, especially as the game goes on.” \n\nContact Joe Klarer at joe@calaverasenterprise.com or 498.2076.
