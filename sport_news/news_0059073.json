Show Caption Previous Next \nCAK clinched a berth in the Class 3A football playoffs with a 42-20 victory over visiting Loudon on Friday night. \nThe Warriors (7-0, 3-0 Region 2-3A) remained perfect on the season with another superb effort by junior quarterback Cole Smith’s accurate arm. \nSmith picked apart the Loudon secondary in the first half. \nStill, CAK tight end/linebacker Austin Pope said the Warriors were not happy. \n“Honestly it was kind of hard today,” said Pope, a University of Tennessee commitment. “We didn’t have any energy at all coming out.” \nPope was a key part of the first-half scoring drives. He blocked well and scored on a 45-yard pass from Smith to give CAK a 14-0 lead. \nLoudon broke through with a designed quarterback run by Jacob Crabtree to cut the deficit to 28-6. \nIn the third quarter, Loudon (2-4, 0-3) continued its heavy running attack, which was lead by junior Hayden Richardson. \nTrying to catch up, Loudon started going for it on fourth down. \n“We were down three touchdowns and against a great football team,” Loudon coach Joe Campbell said. “At that point, we really didn’t have a choice.” \nCAK began giving its backup players some opportunities toward the end of the game. \nFreshman Kyle Carter picked up the last CAK touchdown with 7:33 to go in the fourth. \nAfter a blocked punt by Austin Jewell, the Redskins scored two late touchdowns. \n“We’re just going to build off of that and bring forward the positives out of this ball game,” Campbell said.
