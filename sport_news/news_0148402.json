Bogaerts was done with his baseball equipment for a while. The Red Sox 2015 season ended yesterday. It might’ve been a disappointing loss, 3-1 to the Cleveland Indians, but the series hardly seemed to matter.\nIn their eyes, the Sox’ final series was in New York, and they took 3-of-4 from the playoff-bound Yankees while stringing together a six-game winning streak, their longest of the season.\n“We wasted a lot of energy in New York and you hate to say that, but we were tired when we came in here,” interim manager Torey Lovullo said.\nSwept by the Indians to finish the season, the Red Sox were unfazed. Their fate had long been sealed, their tickets back home booked for early October instead of early November. With a 78-84 record, the 2015 Red Sox hadn’t accomplished what they hoped for. They’re now sitting on three last-place finishes in four years, with the 2013 World Series title sandwiched in there.\nAnd it had to end here, in chilly and quiet Cleveland, where the city motto is, “There’s always next year,” and where the Red Sox will play their next game that counts in 183 days.\nThe Sox will probably have John Farrell managing and Torey Lovullo on the bench. Maybe they’ll have an ace on the mound, too, though general manager Mike Hazen said earlier yesterday that it’s not so cut and dry.\n“We’d love to have one,” Hazen said, standing in the dugout before the game, “but there are only so many out there. I still think there are other ways to build a winning team.”\nAsked who will be the Opening Day starter for the Red Sox next season, Lovullo jokingly responded with, “Clay Buchholz.”\nThe front office has work to do.\nIf the Red Sox are going after free agent lefty David Price, they might have to fend off his current club, the AL East champion Toronto Blue Jays. But soon-to-be president of the Blue Jays Mark Shapiro admitted he’s scared of what the Red Sox are capable of in the division next year.\n“I look at the Red Sox as a team that over the next 1-5 years may have the best projection of talent and ability of any team in baseball,” said Shapiro, the longtime Indians GM who said goodbye to Cleveland yesterday. “I mean, between the resources they have, along with the young talent already in place, they’re in pretty good shape.”\nThe Red Sox finished with the third-highest scoring offense — “though we can still improve on that,” Hazen said — and their young players who were considered question marks at this time last year — Bogaerts, Jackie Bradley Jr. and Mookie Betts — each posted an OPS of at least .800 after the All-Star break.\n“I just hope it continues to go up,” said Bogaerts, who finished with 196 hits. “Next year is a new year. I know we have a lot of excitement going around. With (Dustin Pedroia) over there, me and him trying to be solid — he’s obviously solid already, but me trying to be as solid as him. And we have Jackie or Mookie or Rusney (Castillo) in center field. It’s very good up the middle.\n“That’s what Pedey always says, championships are built up the middle.”\nUp the middle is the Red Sox’ strength, and if they have to hide Pablo Sandoval and Hanley Ramirez at the corners and hope for the best, well, it won’t be hard to get more from them next year than they got this year. Lovullo admitted Ramirez is no sure bet to be a good first baseman, but he has faith in Sandoval.\n“I think we have our third baseman, a guy that can go there, play and help us win a championship,” Lovullo said. “And that’s an easy bet because he’s done it.”\nDavid Ortiz finished his 39-year-old season with another RBI yesterday. His youthful attitude hasn’t left him, nor has it left his bat, which finished with 37 homers and 108 RBI.\nBut the nonchalant attitudes in the Red Sox’ locker room following a last-place finish isn’t that of a deadbeat team. From the players to the coaching staff to new president of baseball operations Dave Dombrowski, the Red Sox are more hopeful than they are worried about the future.\nThere was only one player who seemed a bit upset.\n“Every year the goal is the win the World Series, and if you don’t, I don’t care if you’re second, last or 15th,” Pedroia said. “The goal is to win a World Series, and if you don’t do that it’s considered a failure.”\nPressed on the issue, Pedroia squeezed out a few nice words.\n“Yeah, sure, we have a good group of young guys that have grown up a lot and are playing winning baseball,” he said. “Obviously going into next year, the possibly of going to do what we want to do is there. But we have to go do it.\n“I think if you don’t win a World Series, it’s a failure. There’s really no other feeling than that. What do you want me to say, ‘Yay! We’re in last!?’ ”\nPedroia shook his head, frustrated.\nAnother Red Sox season is in the books.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T11:31:34.456+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
