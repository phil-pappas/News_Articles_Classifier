Posted: Friday, October 9, 2015 5:00 am Apache-Sitgreaves National Forests wears many hats 0 comments SPRINGERVILLE — Men wearing hardhats and hanging from OSHA approved ropes while talking via radios from a lookout tower is a normal occurrence for facility engineer Jim Morrison. Continued maintenance of administrative facilities is only a small part of what the Apache-Sitgreaves National Forests’ (ASNFs) Engineering Department oversees. One of many things James Morrison’s job entails is to make sure all administrative facilities are continually maintained and are safe not only for the public, but the employees who work within these located on the ASNFs. Two contractors were hired to assess the structural integrity of the Promontory Fire Lookout Tower located on the western edge of the Sitgreaves National Forest’s Black Mesa Ranger District that is used during spring/summer months. “We want to know why the connection points of some of the diagonal braces have cracked. The contractors will provide us with design recommendations on what we should do to repair the tower,” according to Morrison. As part of the contractor’s work, they too are climbers who are engineers certified by the Society of Professional Rope Access Technicians (SPRAT). As part of their pre-work process, they are developing a site specific Job Hazard Assessment (JHA). They are very safety conscious and their JHA covers many topics to include medical evacuation, helicopter support, and communications. Morrison maintains administrative facilities situated across two million acres and, one of the two hundred plus permanent jobs located on the ASNFs.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T15:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T14:17:30.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
