Just like we have in Savannah.”\n“Please explain to me how the school board can take an expensive retreat at Jekyll Island yet teachers like myself can’t get copier paper, art supplies or even my printer fixed. Have you no shame, Jolene Byrne? I thought things were supposed to be different.”\n“Why do we get tickets when walking in a roadway when there are no sidewalks?”\n“To break the cycle, Savannah should follow the police department and the adoption of the New York-style program for targeting known criminals to known areas of poverty.”\n“ Since DOT has cleaned the median of Ga. 204 between Rio Road and King George will the county do the same for the on and off ramps of Veterans Parkway that’s above 204?”\n“Acts 28:27: For the heart of this people is waxed gross, and their ears are dull of hearing, and their eyes have they closed; lest they should see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and should be converted, and I should heal them.”\n“Well here we go again. I see that Brooks Stillwell wants to represent the individuals. One of them is already in prison! When is Savannah going to have enough? It’s time to clean house and start all over again. We can’t get any worse. People have lost all respect for the city of Savannah and I cannot blame them.”\n“I think it is kinda crazy that Social Security recipients don’t get an increase in their yearly earnings. They say it’s because of the gas. Look at eggs. They used to be 99 cents a carton and now you can’t even find them for less than $2.39. Something is wrong here.”\nContribute to Vox Populi by calling 912-525-0VOX (0869) or emailing us at vox@savannahnow.com . Be sure to write Vox Populi in the subject field.
