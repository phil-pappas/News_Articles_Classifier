After finishing the season winning five of their last six games, the Bears have a lot of confidence built up heading into next season. But now, the Bears softball program has more to build off of off the field. Kaitlyn Harris (Fr. Catcher), Shaeley Arneson (Fr. 3B) and Peyton Caldwell (So. SS) were named to the Western Slope League 4A first team All-Conference team, Monday. Along with Arneson, Caldwell and Harris, Kaitlyn Jackson (Fr. P) was named as an Honorable Mention for WSL 4A, making it four of nine starters named to the All-Conference team for the Rifle Bears. “This is big for our program moving forward, Rifle head coach Troy Phillips said. “Our team is young, so to be recognized like this will be big for us moving forward in terms of confidence.” Harris, who was arguably the best player for Rifle in 2015, finished the year with a .458 batting average, 14 runs batted in, 27 hits and 12 stolen bases. Each of those numbers from Harris was best on the team or tied for best on the team. Arneson hit .360 in 2015 and drove in 13 runs. Defensively, the freshman third baseman totaled 46 assists. Caldwell — the oldest Bear on the All-Conference team — was an on-base machine for Rifle all season, finishing with a .623 OBP while drawing 14 walks on the year. Although Jackson wasn’t named to the first team, getting an honorable mention in her freshman year is a big boost for her game. In 2015, Jackson compiled an 8-9 record with a 4.98 ERA. The freshman pitcher totaled 13 complete games for the Bears while striking out 95 batters in 95 innings pitched.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T02:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T12:02:48.340+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
