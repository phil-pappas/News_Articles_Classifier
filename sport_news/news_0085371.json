Here are some highlights.\nQuestion: What instate college football team is impressing you the most this season?\nTim Cowlishaw: I think Baylor's better than TCU but not by much and the game is in Fort Worth. That makes it about dead even. Is there another team I'm supposed to consider? Oh, the Aggies. Better than I expected. Christian Kirk is amazing for a freshman. Defense starting to show up. Maybe the SEC West isn't as tough as usual. They might make a run at it if they can ever beat LSU.\nQuestion: You have a favorite memory from Red River Showdown?\nTim Cowlishaw: My senior year in college, McBath and Aune both got hurt in the first half. Seemed like the game and the season were over. Randy McEachern came off the bench, didn't make mistakes, Earl continued to be Earl, Steers won 13-6 and went on to be No. 1.\nCLICK HERE TO VIEW THE FULL CHAT\nOn Twitter:\n @TimCowlishaw", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/TimCowlishaw"], "published": "2015-10-09T02:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T21:11:55.519+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
