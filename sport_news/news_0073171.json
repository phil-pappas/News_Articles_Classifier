He's blaming the players for poor execution. \nThere's plenty blame to go around as Georgia Tech (2-4, 0-3 Atlantic Coast Conference) prepares to host Pittsburgh (4-1, 2-0 ACC) on Saturday. \nJunior quarterback Justin Thomas is trying to do too much. Linemen are missing basic assignments for an injury-riddled offense that played five true freshmen in last week's blowout loss at Clemson. \nThe Jackets have lost four straight. \nAP college football website: http://collegefootball.ap.org \nAll content copyright ©2015 Pendleton Times-Post, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T22:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T00:04:55.444+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
