But with those reps, the junior nose tackle made his presence known in a big way.\n\"From the film that we watched after the game, he just dominated the center. It’s kind of scary what he can do,\" said BYU defensive lineman Graham Rowley about his teammate's play. “It’s nice. It kind of takes a lot of pressure off of our defense in the middle. He’s got one of the most important jobs in the run game.\"\nTuiloma has missed BYU's last four contests after sustaining a knee injury during BYU's season opener against Nebraska. Since that time the Cougar run defense has suffered, but appears to be trending upward with the return of its starting nose tackle.\nSo just how important is Tuiloma's presence in the lineup? During Monday's press conference, coach Bronco Mendenhall appraised him as\"our best defensive player.\"\nSo why only 20 reps given to your best defensive player when he's available?\nAccording to Mendenhall, it was due to the formations being run while not wanting to put too much on Tuiloma in his first game back from injury. \"We kept him out quite a bit because of the amount of nickel we were playing, but Travis will play more going forward,\" Mendenhall said.\nAccording to Tuiloma, he feels fully recovered from his injury, but not quite in game shape due to sitting out for so long.\n“I’m still getting there. I’m almost there,” Tuiloma said. “I just need some more reps so I can feel more comfortable out there. But I’m feeling great now. It’s great to be back.”\nWhen informed of the high praise Mendenhall expressed about him, Tuiloma almost seemed embarrassed.\n“It’s an honor, but there’s still so much I can improve on as a player,” he said. “But Mendenhall is a great coach, so any praise he gives you, it’s a great thing. But I know I can still improve and work harder and that’s my goal from now until the end of the year.”\nDefense fully-loaded: For the first time all season, the BYU defense expects to have all of its starters healthy and playing when the team kicks off against Cincinnati this Friday.\nMendenhall stated that defensive backs Michael Shelton and Jordan Preator are expected back after serving a one-game suspension last week while linebacker Harvey Langi, who sat out last week's game with injury, is also expected to return. Cornerback Micah Hanneman, who left the East Carolina game with an injury, is expected to return as well.\nOn the offensive side, offensive lineman Lui Lapuaho is expected to play despite leaving last week's game with an apparent leg injury.\nSpecial teams miscue: Mendenhall expressed satisfaction with his team's overall play on special teams against East Carolina save for allowing a blocked punt that was returned for a touchdown.\nAccording to Mendenhall, the block came about due to a lack of, \"Teaching and education,\" for the three players used as a shield right in front of the punter.\n“We changed the people in our shield a little bit and didn’t quite articulate it well enough to where there was an exact idea, for sure, on what happened,\" Mendenhall continued. \"I don’t think it was our player’s fault. We just didn’t teach it well.”\nEmail: bgurney@desnews.com \nTwitter: @BrandonCGurney", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T10:21:35.381+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
