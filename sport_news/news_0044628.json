Tre Sterling scored four touchdowns -- three offensive and one defensive -- in Sunnyvale's 70-38 victory over Nevada Community on Friday night at Braves Field.\nWho is he? A 6-0, 180-pound junior free safety.\nThe stats: 16 solo tackles, 6 assists 2 interceptions, 1 45-yard interception return for touchdown and 1 pass breakup.\nHe said it: \"It feels really good. I have a good time scoring on defense and just to put my team in a position to win. It gives my offense a better chance not to be on the field more -- it gives them rest. It's fun for me. We were in a coverage where we were supposed to drop back, and I saw my receiver try to run a double move, and I made a break on the ball.\"\nCoach said it: \"He does have a good knack for the ball. He's actually now three straight games on defense. He had one called back last week, so he's doing something right back there, that's for sure.\" -- John Settle.\nDid you know? He had 14 carries for 110 yards and three touchdowns in the victory. Sterling recorded 88 yards on four kickoff returns.\nHonorable mention Player School Cl. Pos.
