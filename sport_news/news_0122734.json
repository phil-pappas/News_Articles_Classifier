She was timed galloping out five-eighths of a mile in 1:01 1/5.\nOliver trains the 5-year-old mare for her father, breeder G. Watts Humphrey, and also serves as Frivolous’ training and work rider.\n“She’s a very deceiving filly when she works, but she worked really well,” Oliver said. “She’s normally a very good work horse. Some days she can go out there and be really switched off and you can get her to go in 49. But today, I think she was really on her game. When I was warming her up down below (on the training track), she was quite animated. Sometimes she’ll leave the pony and be real quiet. But she was ready to work today.”\nFrivolous, a daughter of 2003 Belmont Stakes winner Empire Maker, really came into her own last fall, winning Churchill Downs’ Grade II Falls City over Breeders’ Cup Distaff runner-up Don’t Tell Sophia. This year she won Churchill’s Grade II Fleur de Lis over possible Distaff favorite Sheer Drama, finished second to Sheer Drama in the Grade I Delaware Handicap and won Churchill’s Locust Grove by eight. The top four finishers of the Spinster are targeting the Distaff.\nJon Court rides Frivolous in the Distaff.\nRachel's Valentina works for Juvenile Fillies\nTrainer Todd Pletcher worked part of his Breeders’ Cup arsenal, starting dark and early with Saratoga’s Grade I Spinaway winner Rachel’s Valentina working a half-mile in 49 1/5 seconds in company for the Oct. 31 Juvenile Fillies.\nNo matter how routine the work, Rachel’s Valentina attracts a lot of attention as the second foal of the great Rachel Alexandra, the 2009 Horse of the Year who nearly died after giving birth to the filly. Rachel’s Valentina has done her part to make it up to mom, winning her first two starts.\n“She breezed very well, very typical of the way she goes,” trainer Todd Pletcher said of the daughter of 2006 3-year-old champion Bernardini. “The farther she went, the stronger she got. Galloped out really well. Very happy with her. Looked good.”\nAfter the 8 a.m. renovation break, the Pletcher-trained double Grade I winner Curalina (heading for the Oct. 30 Distaff) worked a half-mile with Oaklawn Handicap winner Race Day in 47 4/5 seconds, galloping out in 1:00 3/5.\nRalis gets in first Keeneland work\nThe Doug O’Neill-trained Ralis, the California invader who captured Saratoga’s Grade I Hopeful, worked five-eighths of a mile in 59 3/5, his first work at the track for the Oct. 31 Juvenile and tying Sprint candidate Limousine Liberal for fastest at the distance. Louisville product Drayden Van Dyke was aboard as Ralis galloped out six furlongs in 1:13 3/5.\n“Drayden said he had to angle out a bit off the rail because a couple of horses were working in front of him,” said Jack Sisterson, the former University of Louisville soccer player who is an O’Neill assistant. “He got over the ground well and I chatted with Doug and he was happy about the work.”\nThe O’Neill camp lost a leading Breeders’ Cup contender with the news that Gomo, winner of the opening-day Darley Alcibiades, will undergo routine surgery to remove an ankle chip, knocking her out of the Juvenile Fillies.\n“Mr. (Paul) Reddam already has Land Over Sea for that race,” Sisterson said. “Gomo is a Grade I winner and we are going to let her mature over the winter. She’ll be fine.”\nLand Over Sea, second to likely Juvenile Fillies favorite Songbird in the Grade I Chandelier, will fly in from California Oct. 25 with stablemates Nyquist (leading contender for the Juvenile) and Sharla Rae (Filly & Mare Turf).\nDude targeting Juvenile\nSticksstatelydude, fourth in Keeneland’s Claiborne Breeders’ Futurity, earned a likely spot in the Breeders’ Cup Juvenile after working a half-mile in 47 4/5 seconds. The Breeders’ Futurity was the colt’s first start in two months after he missed the Hopeful after spiking a fever. Sticksstatelydude, named for the late Lexington businessman Alvin Haynes, is half of the stable trained by Greg Burchell.\n“It is just maintenance now,” Burchell said. “The Breeders’ Futurity got him tight. The way he trains, he’s a free galloper and goes around there in 2:05, 2:06. Conditioning will be no excuse.”\nChurchill Downs work report\nMark Casse worked his Breeders’ Cup contingent, his biggest star the turf mare Tepin, who went an easy half-mile in 50 seconds under jockey Julien Leparoux. Tepin captured Keeneland’s Grade I First Lady to earn a shot against males in the Oct. 31 Breeders’ Cup Mile on turf.\n“She relaxed really nicely,” Casse said by phone. “He dropped her head a little bit after the wire and she took off a little bit. If we wanted her to go fast, we’d put her with somebody. But we didn’t think she needed to do a whole lot.”\nBut Casse said his “work of the day” went to Keeneland maiden winner Conquest Big E, whose five-eighths of a mile in a minute flat under jockey Shaun Bridgmohan in company with the well-regarded Conquest Windycity was so good they are looking at the Breeders’ Cup Juvenile.\n“I was amazed how effortlessly Big E was able to handle Windycity,” Casse said. “As good as he worked, his gallop-out was even more impressive. He just took off. … He has no stop in him. He just goes and goes. I haven’t seen him for maybe 10 days or so. He’s picked up weight since I’ve seen him.”\nAlso working well was Keeneland’s Dixiana Bourbon winner Airoforce, who went a half-mile in 48 seconds in preparation for the Oct. 30 Juvenile Turf. Airoforce worked with third-place Bourbon finisher Siding Spring, a colt Casse hopes to get into the Juvenile Turf but who trains so well on dirt that the Juvenile could be an option, he said. Both colts won their debuts at Kentucky Downs on turf.\n“Those horses get over the dirt very well,” Casse said. “The only reason we started those horses at Kentucky Downs versus, say, Churchill is the purse. I mean, you’re talking $120,000 pots instead of $38,000. I don’t know that they’re limited to turf. That’s what was presented to us, so we took advantage of it.”\nTrainer Kenny McPeek’s Breeders’ Cup-bound 2-year-olds worked together, with Pocahontas winner Dothraki Queen (second in the Alcibiades) going five-eighths in 1:01 and Breeders’ Futurity third Rated R Superstar in 59 3/5.\nRaven Run\nBar of Gold, second in her last two starts to leading 3-year-old filly sprinter Cavorting, heads a field of 11 in Saturday’s $250,000, Grade II Lexus Raven Run at Keeneland.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T01:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T04:05:17.800+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
