The impact and the gains of all the four are debatable, but there is little doubt that the most novel, exciting, and also the most substantial part was the ‘connect’ with the Silicon Valley. I served as the Indian Consul General in San Francisco not too long ago and happen to know this area well. The most satisfying and stimulating part of my job was to get to know and work with Silicon Valley entrepreneurs and professionals. With this perspective, I believe that Modi’s visit to the area and his multiple engagements were timely, intense and productive. Why do I say so? Several factors contributed in shaping the outcome. The first is Modi’s own interest and belief in the power of technology. It is by now obvious that he is an early adapter to IT, keeps track of advances and has taken to using it too through e-monitoring of government programmes or messaging through Twitter. More important, he believes in tapping technology for answering some of India’s challenges, ranging from clean energy to fast communication to last-mile connectivity. His reputation preceded him and added to the ready receptivity at high-level and high-visibility meetings. These no doubt served his political purposes, as well, but were a result of curiosity on both sides. Second, Silicon Valley is much more than a habitat of business and commercial success. Above all, it is a laboratory or an incubator for new technologies that change our lives. Tesla, the corporation headed by Elon Musk is a good example. Today, its core businesses are: solar power generation on a city scale, next generation batteries to provide electricity without a grid, space exploration, artificial intelligence and electric cars of unparalleled sophistication. To take another example, how Google has fundamentally changed the way we access knowledge and has transformed lives is a familiar story. There are breakthroughs in other areas, as well, bio-technology, nano-technology, material engineering, apart from the well-known ICT. Third, this habitat already has an established Indian presence and an Indian connect. With hundreds of Indian origin CEOs, a quarter of all start-ups having been founded by Indians, and now celebrities like Sundar Pichai of Google, Satya Nadella of Microsoft, and Vinod Khosla, previously of Sun Systems, India enjoys a privileged position in the Valley. For three decades, Indians have played a role and their success stories have had a cumulative effect. In the last decade, many have returned to India, some to start their own companies, and others to man the Indian centres of companies like Intel, Google or HP. Thus, the bridge between our Silicon Valley clones like Bangalore or Hyderabad and the original has already been built. Silicon Valley corporates find India an attractive but challenging destination though this will be equally true for all exports or investments from abroad. The demography, the reasonable growth trajectory in a climate where growth has reached a plateau in most countries and the aspirations of a huge middle makes India attractive for any foreign company. But as explained earlier, some of the Silicon Valley behemoths—Apple, Tesla, Intel - are focussed on the future, on the products and processes for tomorrow. For them, India presents a challenge and an opportunity ‘to scale up’, a sacred concept in the digital world, where the growth numbers have to be in hundreds of millions. Also, they view some of the limitations in India as technological challenges to be overcome, such as low speed internet, inadequate broad band, unreliable power, multiplicity of languages and so on. The specifics offered during the visit such as WiFi in railway stations, ‘search’ in diverse languages, internet in all schools, and experimentation in e-education, offer the kind of challenges in bringing advanced tech in a hitherto low-tech environment. Finally, how much of the promise and the potential is likely to be realised? This is the question that we now ask after each visit by the Prime Minister, and we normally end up by lamenting the slow pace of implementation. Will it be the same, this time? Some of the hurdles are formidable, though familiar. Inadequacy of infrastructure is a perpetual problem. The state of the brick and mortar highways cannot be ignored and are in fact a requisite for growth in information superways. Despite much talk, reliable power, clean water and smart cities continue to elude us. Other issues relate to the bureaucratic and regulatory framework, interface with multiple agencies and lack of large numbers of well trained manpower. Notwithstanding, it can be argued that the enhanced connection with the west coast is likely to bring benefits. Past experience already suggests that in the ICT revolution (Information and Communication Technology), it is possible for India to leapfrog stages and move to the global level, as we witnessed with widespread use of PCs and now, mobile telephony. The visit mentioned several specific applications in the digital world relating to education, health, governance and connecting people that are implementable on the ground. It should also be recognised that apart from the quantitative figures for investments or job creation, the qualitative aspects of ideas and innovation may reinforce the connection between the west coast and Indian entrepreneurs. It is in this area, that Modi’s visit may turn out to be a force-multiplier.
