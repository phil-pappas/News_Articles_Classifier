But it was too little too late as Washington State posted a 52-31 victory.\"Everything was better in the second half; defensively, offensively, special teams,\" Andersen said. \"The second half we were able to make some aggressive calls and make things happen.\"The struggling Beavers continued to have defensive woes, giving up more than 40 points for the third consecutive game. The pass attack also suffered, as freshman quarterback Seth Collins completed 17 of 30 passes for 176 yards, but was intercepted twice.\"Seth would like to have a few balls back,\" Andersen said. \"We need to throw the ball better.\"Washington State quarterback Luke Falk tied a team record with six touchdown passes, but all came in the first half.

The Cougars had 399 yards of offense in the first half.Neither team scored in the third quarter.Collins threw a short touchdown pass to Jordan Villamin late in the fourth, to close within 45-25.
