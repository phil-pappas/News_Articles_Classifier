On Monday, Miami fired coach Joe Philbin after a 1-3 start. The Dolphins went 24-28 under Philbin, a Worcester Academy graduate. Tight ends coach Dan Campbell will take the reins and become the eighth head man to appear in a game for Miami since 2000 — the season the Patriots hired Bill Belichick. It has become routine. When Campbell coaches his first game with the Dolphins on Oct. 18 at Tennessee, it will mark the 21st man to head up an AFC East rival since New England hired Belichick. That explains plenty about the Patriots’ long-running supremacy in the division. On Monday, during his weekly appearance on WEEI, Tom Brady said he believes continuity has been the team's most significant key to success. “I think, first of all, the NFL is a very, very tough league, and it’s a very competitive league,” Brady said. “There’s a lot that it takes for things to go well. I think we’ve been blessed to be part of an organization where things have gone well for a long period of time. “I know it may feel normal being here, but at the same time, I think it’s very abnormal. I think there’s very few teams who have experienced this. Certainly, with Coach Belichick, he’s truly a one-of-a-kind coach. We’ve been consistent to be together for a long period of time. Mr. (Robert) Kraft and Jonathan (Kraft), and their consistency of doing things, we’ve had the same system in place, and a lot of the same coaches — our coaching staff, offensively, it didn’t change much for a long period of time. “The consistency, I think, is so important for NFL football.” With Philbin gone, the Dolphins, Bills and Jets each have a new coach from the end of last season. Rex Ryan, after being fired from the Jets, is in Buffalo. In New York, Todd Bowles has replaced Ryan. Since 2000, AFC East teams have fired head coaches 18 times. Of course, quarterback play also comes into the equation. Since 2000, the Patriots have relied on Brady for 14 of 16 seasons. Matt Cassel started 15 games after Tom Brady's knee injury in 2008, and Drew Bledsoe started in Belichick's first season. Over that same time frame, the Bills and Dolphins both have had nine quarterbacks finish the season with the team lead in passing yards. The Jets have had seven. As Brady pointed out, when a team changes coaches, it typically introduces a new system on offense or defense. A new coach and new system usually leads to roster turnover, as players who fit into the system are brought in. “I know the easy thing in sports now is to change coaches, and then the whole scheme of players change, but I think that’s a good thing for the Patriots when that happens for other teams, truthfully,” Brady said. “When teams change their coach, I think that’s an advantage for us. They’ve got to rebuild, and we’ve got to continue to make improvements on the things we need to improve on. I feel like we always start at a better place than these other teams because they’ve got so much ground to make up.” The Patriots have four championships to show for their continuity at coach and quarterback. After the bye week, the team enters Week 5 of the 2015 season again looking like one of the best teams in the NFL. It won't be easy to attain championship No. 5. But the Patriots certainly have a few things going for them that their division rivals do not. “If we can just keep working on — like we said earlier — working as hard as we can identifying problems, identifying the solutions, working hard at them, continue to get better, and, like coach always says, ‘Ignore the noise, ignore all the BS, focus on your job and do it,’ that’s really the system that he’s put in place,” Brady said. “He finds a lot of players who fit into that system. “There’s a lot of ways to be successful in this league, and our way works for us. Doesn’t work for every player, doesn’t work for every coach, but it works for the Patriots. That’s the culture that’s been in place. There’s a lot of good players, a lot of good coaches, anyone can win on every week. Over the course of 16 games, you figure out where you’re at and which way your season is heading. We’ve had a good opportunity to be in the place we’ve been in for a long time. We’ve just got to keep going.” By Mark Daniels Posted Oct. 5, 2015 at 7:21 PM » Comment or view comments [+] CDL TRUCK Driver Wanted: Dennison Lubricants in CDL TRUCK Driver Wanted: Dennison Lubricants in Worcester, Ma. is currently hiring for the position of a CDL truck driver, class A or B.
