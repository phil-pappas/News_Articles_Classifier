The women were at the game as part of the Associated Press Sports Editors sports media diversity weekend.\nPublic relations staffs from both the Colts and the Jaguars apologized to the women.\nColts spokesman Avis Roper tells The Associated Press the usher was in an area where he didn't know who was allowed access.\nThe Association for Women in Sports Media says it's unfortunate that such issues continue to exist.\n___\nAP NFL websites: http://www.pro32.ap.org and http://www.twitter.com/AP_NFL \nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
