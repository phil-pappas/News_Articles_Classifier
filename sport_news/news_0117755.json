The Cru (5-0, 1-0 ASC) stretched its regular season win streak to 59 consecutive victories with a 62-20 win over Sul Ross State University in the American Southwest Conference opener last Saturday. \nThe Cru is ranked second in the country in the fourth American Football Coaches Association Top 25 Poll of the 2015 season. The Cru received two first-place votes and 995 total points from the AFCA. Mount Union took over the top spot with 38 first-place votes and 1,045 total points. Hardin-Simmons is ranked 13 th in the nation with 570 total points and Texas Lutheran received votes totaling 32 points. The Cowboys and Bulldogs are both on the UMHB schedule for later this season. \n\n“It was good to get a victory, but it really says something that our players were disappointed in themselves afterwards,” Cru head coach Pete Fredenburg said. “They celebrate the wins, but still understand that there is room to improve and things we can work on to get this program to where we want it to go.” \n\nUMHB moved up to #3 in the country in the D3football.com Top 25 Poll. The Cru totaled 571 points in that poll. Mount Union took over the #1 ranking with 19 first-place votes and 619 total points and Linfield College is second with the other six first-place votes and 595 total points. Hardin-Simmons is ranked 15 th in the country and Texas Lutheran is ranked 25 th in the nation by D3football.com this week. \n\nUMHB will return to action with another key American Southwest Conference showdown this Saturday. The Cru will travel to Pineville, Louisiana to take on Louisiana College (2-3, 1-1 ASC). That game will kick off at 1:00 PM at Wildcat Stadium.
