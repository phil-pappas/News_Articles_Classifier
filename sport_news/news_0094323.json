Four months later, his family says they still do not know what happened to him or where he is.\nThe Freedom for the Brave campaign said on its official Facebook page that there has been no official information regarding his arrest, prosecution or his being at any of the country's morgues.\nFollowing the ouster of president Hosni Mubarak in February 2011, Massouny, a university student at the time, was politically active and participated in several youth-led protests.\nHe was briefly detained in July 2011 while filming a protest against the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces in Luxor. He was also arrested briefly in August 2011 after the dispersal of a Tahrir Square sit-in.\nIn 2012, Massouny switched his attention to a career as a film editor.\nIn June 2015, the Freedom of the Brave campaign issued a statement on recent cases of political activists disappearing, stating that 163 cases have been documented since April. In some of the cases, the activists have resurfaced, while the rest remain missing.\nThe centre-left Constitution Party issued a statement on Tuesday condemning the disappearance of Massouny and demanding his immediate release.\n\"For more than three months, nobody has known the whereabouts of Mostafa Massouny,\" read the statement, adding that forced disappearances are a crime against the constitution and the law.\nSeveral prominent Egyptian TV hosts like Khairy Ramadan and Gaber El-Armouty also commented on the case, demanding answers for Massouny's disappearance.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T00:14:29.037+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
