Whenever she needed me, I had her [back]. We were really good friends. It hurt me when I found out she got killed because I wasn't in school that day.\" \nSimmons, a National Honor Society student, explained that the two had exchanged texts that morning. \nHowever, he didn't attend school because of a doctor's appointment. \n\"She told me good morning and asked if I was going to school,\" said Simmons, a 4.0 student who hopes to study sports medicine at Delaware. \"And that was the last time I talked to her.\" \nSimmons, who lives near 21st and Somerset, nearly lost his older sister, Bria, years ago to gun violence. She survived a gunshot wound to the chest as a student at Philadelphia Electrical and Technology Charter. \nSimmons may no longer have Abdur Rahman's final text messages, but he still has access to memories of her. \n\"I don't have them anymore because I lost that phone,\" he said softly. \"It's not hard for me though, because I'm always going to remember the good times that we had even if I don't have those messages. I think about her all the time.\" \nDel-Val improved to 2-3 overall and 2-0 in the league. Strawberry Mansion fell to 0-2, 0-5. \nShaheed Brown was magnificent for Del-Val Charter.
