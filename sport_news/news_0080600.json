Last year, the figure was $60,000 -- and that money, Golden said, came without strings attached. \n\"We want to have the best ethical standards,\" said Golden. \"We want to teach our students about avoiding conflicts of interest.\" \nA similar decline has played out nationally, with medical schools taking 22% less money from drug companies for doctor education courses last year than in 2011, according to the Accreditation Council for Continuing Medical Education , which certifies providers of the courses. \nThat amounts to a $45 million difference. \nDuring that same time, drug companies shifted funding to publishing and educational companies, typically for-profit firms, which received $63 million more, a 25% increase. \nIn 2010, the University of Michigan Medical School announced it would no longer accept any industry funding for CME and similar educational courses. \nPaul Lichter , MD, who heads the school's Clinical and Educational Conflict of Interest Committee, said the money represented too much of a conflict, even if it was only of perception. \n\"Industry does not give money without a profit purpose,\" Lichter said. \"The fact that industry supports these courses means that they will be able to tell their shareholders that the money was given to support and increase profit. There is no other way to rationalize this for companies.\" \nThat position was disputed by Graham McMahon, MD, president and chief executive officer of the ACCME. \n\"CME activities are not promotional,\" he said. \"They're required to be evidence-based. They're required to be independent of commercial support.\" \nWhile some medical schools may be turning down industry money, it doesn't mean universities as a whole are avoiding it, McMahon noted. He said the trend may simply be a sign of more published or web-based courses rather than live events, which universities often host. \nIn 2008, Stanford School of Medicine severely restricted funding from drug companies for doctor education programs it offered. \nThe medical school said it only would accept general funds from industry for broad areas such as pediatric or surgical specialties. It also banned drug company exhibits at Stanford-sponsored continuing medical education courses. \nOver the last decade, industry support has declined from 38% to less than 3% of the total budget for the Stanford courses, said Linda Baer , MSPH, director of continuing medical education. \n\"These policies were developed to ensure that all CME activities are free of potential influence or bias,\" she said in an email.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T14:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T17:28:17.164+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
