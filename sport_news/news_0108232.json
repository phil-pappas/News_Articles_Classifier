Emails and texts keep coming. And it probably will be that way right up until the day the highly sought-after Division I recruit makes his final decision.\n\"It’s still kind of hectic,\" said Fuller, who earned The Record Male Athlete of the Week honor after leading the Golden Knights to a 42-14 victory over No. 2 Pascack Valley. \"I still get a ton of calls, but it’s OK. It’s not overwhelming.\"\nIn case you missed it, Fuller’s final list in no particular order is: Rutgers (which offered him a scholarship as an eighth-grader), UCLA (where his big brother, Devin, plays football), Notre Dame, TCU, Ohio State, Michigan, Penn State and Virginia Tech. Fuller said he still plans to take five official visits, but he still hasn’t worked out the particulars.\nFuller said he doesn’t think he’s going to make a huge production out of announcing his final choice. He wants to keep things simple, telling his family and friends.\nAll that college speculation, however, is a worry for another day. Fuller said his main concern is this season, hoping to lead the unbeaten Golden Knights, the No. 1 team in The Record public Top 20, to a North 1, Group 4 sectional title.\n\"We’ve got to stay focused,\" said Fuller, who doesn’t know what he’ll study in college yet. \"We can’t get caught looking ahead or anything like that.\"\nFuller also plans to run track again this spring. When he’s not playing football, Fuller said he’s just like any other teenager, hanging out with his friends, playing video games, and listening to hip-hop and R&B.\n\"Ask my teammates and they’ll tell you that I’m always laughing and having a good time,\" Fuller said. \"I’m always laughing when I’m off the field. I’m just a happy kid.\"\nAlso nominated: Aveon Irving of Garfield, Nick Garcia of Pascack Hills, Josh Paez of Wood-Ridge, Alex Morales of Manchester, Pete Guerriero of Lyndhurst and Michael Bolwell of Becton for football.\n</div>", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T04:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T08:45:54.706+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
