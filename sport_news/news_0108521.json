So, too, did a story significantly more graphic than merely bad.\nLet’s put this as simply as possible: Today is not a good day to be Steve Sarkisian.\nOne-loss college teams still interested in competing nationally pretty much face must-wins every week.\nBut for USC’s Sarkisian, this one Thursday was the double-secret probation of must-wins, a win easily mustier than any game he’d coached yet for the Trojans.\nLeading Washington by the eye-rubbing, temple-massaging score of 6-3 at halftime, USC never did what USC so often does in the second half, the Trojans instead repeatedly stalling in a 17-12 loss that invited the fiercest wrath of Trojans fans and the sharpest mockery of everyone else upon Sarkisian.\nThey were outplayed, out-willed and, most important, outcoached by the program Sarkisian once led, some of the very players he recruited making his life difficult again in a season that wasn’t supposed to be this hard. Not through the first five games, at least.\nA must-win lost, USC’s coach will face another barrage of questions about the direction of his program and, more specifically, the pace of that direction. Sarkisian teams at USC are now 12-6.\nThe questions began shortly after the game ended, and Sarkisian, to his credit, answered by taking the fall for a team that never did get up against the Huskies.\n“This one, at the end of the day, is on me,” he said. “This game starts with me. When we don’t perform as a football team, it’s on the head coach. We just didn’t get it done. It starts with me.”\nWith the talent spread more evenly than ever, college football has become unpredictable enough, each week featuring outcomes no easier to grasp than a greased gecko. Four teams currently ranked among the top 13 weren’t ranked at all entering the season.\nAnd the Pac-12 – like all big-time conferences – is deep and tough. Sarkisian’s Trojans losing at home to the overmatched Huskies, however, defies more than just predictability.\nThis was a game that featured numerous dropped balls by USC receivers, eight penalties, an oddly subpar Cody Kessler, three turnovers and a 1-for-13 third-down conversion rate – the signs of a team not ready to play and after having nearly two weeks to prepare.\n“This is the way college football is now,” Sarkisian said. “This is the way our conference is right now. We’re going to be in tight games and have to realize how important it is to execute.”\nThis was the first time Sarkisian faced the school where he began his head coaching career in 2009. In five seasons with the Huskies, he earned the reputation of being able to win – just not enough.\n“Seven-Win Sark” wasn’t a nickname; it was an expression of derision. In some places around Seattle, Sarkisian remains less popular than even the weather.\n1 2 Next Page", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T19:47:53.555+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
