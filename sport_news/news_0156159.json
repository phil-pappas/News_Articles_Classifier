WALTHAM, Mass. — Terry Rozier is not a guy who is ever going to shy away from a challenge. Growing up in a tough part of Ohio, with his father in jail, the Celtics rookie said he was always sure he would make it out of the type of situation that had sabotaged the lives of so many aspiring basketball players before him. Through the NBA draft process, when most had him pegged as a second-round pick, the University of Louisville product insisted he always thought he was a first-round talent. On Tuesday night at TD Garden, after the first open practice of the year, Rozier even told season-ticket holders that he hoped they would cheer he and his teammates on to a championship this year. So it’s not surprising that the 6-foot-3 guard is convinced he will contribute greatly to the long playoff run he is predicting despite the team’s deep and guard-heavy roster. “I know for sure — I’m saying this with confidence — I will find a way to get time out there on the floor,” he said prior to Thursday’s practice. “Whether it’s four, three or two minutes, I know I will find my way onto the floor this season.” That determination, and self-assurance, is part of what made the Celtics target Rozier with the 17th pick in June’s draft. As heads were scratched among season-ticket holders at The Seaport Hotel draft party trying to figure out what was so special about yet another point guard who shot 41 percent from the floor — 31 percent on 3-pointers — the Celtics made the selection with as much confidence in Rozier as he always shows in himself. “I was born with it,” Rozier said of that mentality. “That’s me. Everybody will have their things to say about what I can or can’t do. At the end of the day, I’m the one who has to put on the jersey and play. “It’s all about what I think. I am always going to keep my confidence. That’s me as a person. It’s helped me a lot.” That’s not to say Rozier expects to come into the preseason and take over a team that was in the playoffs last year. But he does believe his strengths — defensive disruption, energy, mental and physical toughness — will earn him time on the floor. “He’s got a shot,” Celtics coach Brad Stevens said. “We’re not into the position where we know, exactly, who is going to be in what playing time, but he’s certainly in that mix where he is playing for it. Page 2 of 2 - “There’s something to be said for a guy who always stays ready and is able to provide that lift.” The transition from being a college star to playing a smaller role in the NBA is a tough one for many rookies. Outside of the top few picks in the lottery, it is the ones who excel in those roles early in their careers who afford themselves the chance for more playing time moving forward. “That’s why we try to focus on the process every minute of every day,” Stevens said. “We don’t gauge development in term of minutes played here. We gauge development in terms of what you are doing before practice, what you are doing after practice, how you are progressing during practice. Then, when you get those minutes, how do you play when you get those minutes? “It’s easy to look from the outside in and say, ‘It’s always better to throw them to the fire and give them minutes.’ Well, there are a lot of ways to get better. That’s what these guys have got to embrace regardless of whether they are playing or not. It’s all about growth.” It didn’t take long for the 21-year-old to impress some of his older teammates during this week’s training camp. “Terry is incredibly quick and athletic,” 10-year veteran Amir Johnson said. “He works hard. He is an unbelievable player. The young guys are high-energy. They get everyone going.” Rozier has a reputation for having a motor that starts fast and never stops. It's a motor he's used to surge past the roadblocks in his way on the court and in life. It’s a motor he’s used to leave more heralded opponents in his wake when theirs have sputtered. It’s how he plans to earn himself a spot in the rotation as a rookie — even if it’s one minute at a time. “I’m pushing for it,” he said. “I’m real good at it. It’s one of my attributes, one thing I’m very good at. If you keep doing something you are good at, it’s going to get you by. “I’m going to keep perfecting my craft and keep getting better.” By Scott Souza More Content Now The Bulletin By Scott Souza More Content Now Posted Oct. 1, 2015 at 9:38 PM", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T05:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T04:48:20.264+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
