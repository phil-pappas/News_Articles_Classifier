Most of the evidence and witnesses are also located in the USA.”\nOf the six other officials arrested in Zurich last May, former FIFA vice-president Jeffrey Webb of the Cayman Islands agreed and was subsequently extradited to face corruption charges in the U.S.\nSwiss authorities had already approved the extradition to the U.S. to face the same charges of others arrested in the corruption sting — former Venezuelan Football Federation president Rafael Esquivel, Uruguayan former FIFA vice-president Eugenio Figueredo, former head of the Costa Rican Football Federation Eduardo Li and former general secretary of the Cayman Islands Football Association Costas Takkas.\nAlthough not among the seven arrested, Blatter is being investigated by Swiss prosecutors over the sale of World Cup television rights and a $2 million (1.8 million euros) payment to UEFA president Michel Platini.\nLast week both Blatter and Platini were suspended from football for 90 days by FIFA’s ethics committee pending the investigation.\nRecommended: 4 reasons why FIFA’s Sepp Blatter must step down immediately\nTwo other former FIFA officials, Jack Warner and American Chuck Blazer, have been banned from all football-related activities for life for their roles in the sale of television rights at grossly deflated values.\nWarner is fighting extradition to the U.S. from his home on Trinidad and Tobago while Blazer has turned whistleblower and is assisting U.S. authorities.\nU.S. authorities have charged 14 people in relation to more than $150 million in bribes given for television and marketing deals.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T00:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T21:11:43.436+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
