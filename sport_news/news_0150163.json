Angel Abbey hugs its hillside site as though not to intrude on the surrounding pastoral landscape or the abbey campus atop the butte. One of Oregon's architectural gems, and one of only two buildings in the United States designed by the great Finnish architect, its interior descends in clean lines and natural textures through three levels bathed in natural light. Unlike increasingly busy city libraries, it remains a place of silent study, but its history has included major musical events: Duke Ellington played here at the 1970 opening, and this weekend Third Angle New Music celebrated the structure in an intense and absorbing set of concerts in the third installment of its \"Frozen Music\" series.\nThe program, which opened Saturday with both Third Angle and Cappella Romana in three one-hour cycles over the afternoon, wove together several threads. The Clarinet Quintet of contemporary Finnish composer Magnus Lindberg reflected Aalto's heritage; a Gregorian antiphon and psalm setting reflected the abbey's spiritual community; Einojuhani Rautavaara's choral setting of the Lord's Prayer reflected both. In between, the ensemble presented a soundscape meant to draw people throughout the library's architecture and deep into its cultural context, and lectures before and after the set of performances offered further perspective.\nHighlights: The transition from Lindberg's dense, hectic music, performed in the auditorium off the library, to the sounds presented in the library proper symbolized the passage from outside world to sanctuary. An exploratory period within allowed listeners to wander slowly as the quintet players bowed wine glasses to build a chord on the room's resonant frequency — a low hum reinforced by an amplifier deep in a basement stairwell — and the singers strolled the stacks quietly reading aphoristic passages from Aalto's writings. The architect's words sounded quietly in a Finnish-language recording on speakers distributed throughout, and in two alcoves screens with headphones played clips from Ellington's performance. The atmosphere was one of appropriately reverential, quiet cacophony. Finally, the singers processed to the mezzanine and finished with a strong and sonorous performance of the Rautavaara, standing in a circular configuration reflecting the curves of the room.\nLow notes: If you wanted to experience both lectures flanking the performances, you had a long day — not to mention the drive.\nMost valuable performer: While the strings in Lindberg's enormously challenging quintet — violinists Ron Blessinger and Greg Ewer, violist Charles Noble and cellist Marilyn De Oliveira — deserve high praise for their work, clarinetist Louis DeMartino gets top honors for a Herculean performance. For a relentless 20 minutes, he flew through spiky arpeggios, swooping scales, extended stratospheric notes and trills that flitted over the octaves like a hummingbird over a flower garden. And then he did it twice more, with three more stints to come Sunday.\nAlso noted: The revered Finnish architect Juhani Pallasmaa was to offer words on Aalto at the end of the afternoon. Before a full crowd in the auditorium, he quietly announced that he had changed his mind and would instead discuss his close friend, the legendary designer Tapio Wirkkala. Any idea that it might be an incongruous departure were soon dispelled as he offered in thoughts and reminiscences accompanied by photographs and focused on the role of hands in creating art. His talk resonated with the spirit of both the library and the project, extolling the virtues of organic creation and arguing for the unity of hand and mind — like the prayers of the devout in the surrounding community, it was an homage to the maker.\nRepeats: One-hour music cycles at 1, 2 and 3 p.m., with a lecture/tour at noon and a lecture (both by Portland architect and Aalto scholar Bill Tripp) at 4 p.m.; Mount Angel Abbey Library, 1 Abbey Drive, St. Benedict\nTickets: thirdangle.org\n--James McQuillen", "external_links": ["http://thirdangle.org/", "http://www.cappellaromana.org/", "https://www.mountangelabbey.org/abbey-library/"], "published": "2015-10-04T23:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T02:25:20.622+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
