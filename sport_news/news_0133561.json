More than one-quarter complained of disturbed sleep.\nIt also found that suffering a severe injury \"might lead to mental health problems in the long term.\"\nFIFPro medical chief Vincent Gouttebarge called for \"all stakeholders in football to put supportive measures in place so that those suffering from mental health problems know they are not alone.\"\nThe union said 219 retired players from 11 countries, all men with an average age of 35, participated in the research that expands on a 2013 pilot study.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
