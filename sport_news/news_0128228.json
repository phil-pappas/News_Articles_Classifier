Both sides remain polarized following last spring's religious objections law, which brought unwanted national attention to Indiana. Critics said the law could sanction discrimination against gay and lesbian couples. Lawmakers have shied away from public statements on LGBT rights, though acknowledge it'll be hard to avoid when the Legislature meets in January. Opponents say giving civil rights protections to lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people will have negative repercussions and could expose children to transgendered people and what opponents call \"sexual predators\" in public restrooms. Supporters of LGBT civil rights say those are \"scare tactics\" and point to other states and cities that have approved such rights without problems.
