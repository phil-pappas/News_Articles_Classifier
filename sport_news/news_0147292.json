The biggest difference on defense a week after the Bears showed improvement in a loss at Seattle was the play of Tracy Porter. He stepped into the starting lineup even though Alan Ball, who was questionable with a groin injury suffered during the week in practice, was active. Porter looks like someone who will stay in the starting lineup after successfully handling an assignment to follow Raiders rookie wide receiver Amari Cooper from side to side.\nComing off consecutive 100-yard games, the No. 4 overall pick Cooper was generating headlines and for good reason. It took him very little time to become Derek Carr’s go-to target and the Bears knew that would be the case. Carr targeted Cooper nine times but he made only four receptions for 49 yards. Yes, Cooper scored a 26-yard touchdown, but that was on one of the few plays he lined up in the slot and in that instance, coverage went to nickel back Sherrick McManis. Cooper ran a great route, selling an inside move hard before converting to a corner route. Carr’s pass was perfectly delivered and safety help from Antrel Rolle wasn’t close to being in time, although Rolle had a long way to go.\nSo take away the touchdown pass with McManis covering and Porter limited Cooper to three catches for 23 yards. Makes me wonder right now if Porter will follow Chiefs wide receiver Jeremy Maclin from side to side next Sunday at Arrowhead Stadium.\nI think it’s fair to say Porter figured he would get a little more action last Sunday at Seattle when he played only five snaps. He missed the first two games recovering from a hamstring pull that had him on the sideline for the majority of preseason and the second half of training camp. His patience paid off and part of it was probably having to develop a comfort level for defensive coordinator Vic Fangio and secondary coach Ed Donatell. Coach John Fox had Porter in Denver. GM Ryan Pace was in New Orleans when Porter made one of the bigger interceptions in Super Bowl history. In Super Bowl XLIV, Porter picked off Peyton Manning and returned it 74 yards for a touchdown to preserve the Saints’ victory when it looked like the Colts were headed for a game-tying score. There’s no question Porter advanced his career in a major way jumping the Reggie Wayne route on the sport’s grandest stage.\nTracy Porter Jose M. Osorio / Chicago Tribune Tracy Porter celebrates an incomplete pass to the Raiders' Amari Cooper in the first quarter.\nTracy Porter celebrates an incomplete pass to the Raiders' Amari Cooper in the first quarter.\n(Jose M. Osorio / Chicago Tribune) Porter, 29, has been a playmaker with quality man-to-man skills for a long time but he lasted only three games for the Redskins a year ago and was healthy for only six games for Denver in 2012. That’s how the Bears wound up landing Porter on a one-year contract for the minimum salary benefit when he was signed June 8.\nI asked Porter if it bothers him to be called injury prone. He did play in 38 of 48 regular-season games for the Saints from 2009 to 2011 and started all 16 games for the Raiders in 2013.\n“That’s just a label,” he said. “I don’t take nothing from it by people saying it. They can say it ’til the cows come home. As long as I am available to help my team win when they need me, that’s the bottom line.\n“You can go back and look at the injuries I have and you can nitpick. You can nitpick each injury but the bottom line is they were injuries and I had to be out for whatever amount of time. It’s all about how you come back.”\nHis comeback against the Raiders was strong and while the Bears ultimately would surely prefer to have Kyle Fuller in a place where he can be the matchup cornerback, he’s not there right now. The Bears have to hope he sees elements of Porter’s game in this scheme that can help him improve along the way.\n“For the last couple weeks I have been the same guy, coming in and working hard and the coaches and my teammates, they just had confidence in me,” Porter said. “They believed in my skill-set and I believe in my skill-set and once your teammates and the coaches believe in you, you have to show up.\n“(Fox and Pace) both know me but I was new coming in under Vic and Ed. I may know Fox and Ryan but I am new to the defensive guys. Whether it is through injury, performance or whatever, for whatever reason they called me up to play and I was ready.”\nDoes Porter see an opportunity to remain in the starting lineup?\n“I’m not even looking that far ahead and I really don’t even get caught up in any of that,” he said. “I leave that up to the coaches. I just go out whenever they call my number to go out and I try to do my best. They’re going to make the decision.”\nNo question outside linebacker Pernell McPhee made the most plays for the defense but Porter was the biggest difference from Week 3 to Week 4 and really from the first three games to now. Ball wasn’t playing poorly but the Bears had not gotten play like that from a cornerback to this point.\n2. With Will Montgomery sidelined with a fractured left fibula , that certainly sounds like the kind of injury that can be season ending. Montgomery’s absence is going to create a major decision for the Bears and I see three options. Do they stick with Matt Slauson, who did a pretty nice job sliding over from left guard, especially when you consider he doesn’t get snapping reps in practice? Yes, one shotgun snap was high and quarterback Jay Cutler made a nice play to keep the ball from going into the end zone, and there was a botched exchange, but with full-time practice at the position, that stuff gets ironed out. The second option would be to promote third-round draft pick Hroniss Grasu, who has been inactive for the first four games. The third option would be to sign a free agent and put him at center and keep Slauson at left guard.\n“I’d like to take about 24 hours to enjoy this win before we start getting into personnel issues,” coach John Fox said when asked about the dilemma in the middle.\nWill Montgomery Brian Cassella / Chicago Tribune Bears center Will Montgomery goes down with an injury in the first quarter.\nBears center Will Montgomery goes down with an injury in the first quarter.\n(Brian Cassella / Chicago Tribune) There are several experienced centers on the street right now including former Bears Roberto Garza and Brian de la Puente, ex-Lion Dominic Raiola and journeymen Samson Satele and Scott Wells -- among others. Sources told me the Bears poked around on Satele during the offseason before signing Montgomery.\n“I am ready,” Grasu said after the game. “Been ready and I have been preparing myself every single day.”\nThe preseason looked a little rough for Grasu, who had the make the adjustment from Oregon to the NFL where there is a lot more on his plate. He read the front side of the defensive formation only in college in the hurry-up offense that didn’t huddle. Way more goes into the job as far as communicating with the quarterback and the rest of the line in the NFL. Grasu was overpowered at times and that was probably two things. First, leverage is the key to playing well at center and Grasu also looked like he needed to get stronger in his base.\n“Ever since the season started, I have been focused on getting ready mentally and getting ready physically,” he said. “I gained some weight and have been lifting a lot, more days extra, and I feel really good and ready to go.”\nHe said he weighs between 302 and 304 pounds, up almost 10 from the start of training camp.\nFormer general manager Phil Emery said Slauson was a potential candidate to replace Garza in the future but his experience at center was limited to just a few occasions with his former team the New York Jets.\n“A couple of quarters here and there with the Jets but that was a dire emergency type of deal where if I was ever called upon to come in it was a deal where, ‘All right, Slauson is in. We’re not going ’gun the rest of the game,’” Slauson said. “Just because it is hard to get those reps when you are starting at one position and backing up at another. You don’t have the time to work on the other. I just have to do mental reps at center throughout the week.\n“Identification-wise, I am all in-tune with everything. But not able to take the snaps (in practice). Not enough time to work on it. If I am that guy going forward, identifications are never going to be an issue. It’s going to be now just getting a comfort level with playing as the center now, using center techniques. Snapping the ball is going to be fine.”\nArrowhead Stadium is among the most difficult road venues in the NFL and that could factor into the decision this week. The Bears might stick with Slauson for that reason alone. But a player like Grasu has a chance to make real gains in practice because he’s working with the scout team and that means he’s going against the No. 1 defense every day. If he’s shown improvements over the past month, perhaps the coaches are comfortable giving him a shot. It’s not unusual for rookie centers to be groomed in practice. Olin Kreutz was a third-round pick in 1998 and he started only one game that season in Week 16 as a 21-year-old. Kreutz was All-Pro by the time he was 24, which is Grasu’s current age.\nHroniss Grasu Phil Velasquez / Chicago Tribune Hroniss Grasu speaks after Bears rookie minicamp.\nHroniss Grasu speaks after Bears rookie minicamp.\n(Phil Velasquez / Chicago Tribune) A decision with Grasu will also likely involve the comfort level the coaches have with Patrick Omameh, who came in to replace Slauson at left guard. If they like what Omameh did, that could make it easier for them to go forward with Slauson at center.\nI’m guessing Fox is as cryptic as possible about his offensive line this week.\n3. The best development on the offensive line was the performance of Charles Leno in his first career start at left tackle in place of Jermon Bushrod, who was out with a concussion and a shoulder injury. Leno was beaten by Aldon Smith for a sack on the final play of the first half but all in all, it was a quality performance and he played with much more poise than he showed in Week 3 of the preseason at Cincinnati when the starting right tackle job was on the line.\nIt’s just one game and you can’t put too much stock in it, but Leno playing well is a positive for a team searching for young players who can perform under pressure with an eye toward the future. He took one extra kick step on the sack and that allowed Smith an inside lane.\n“I should have been more patient like I did the rest of the game,” Leno said.\nBut he was focused on the positives afterward.\nCharles Leno Jose M. Osorio / Chicago Tribune Charles Leno blocks the Raiders' Aldon Smith as quarterback Jay Cutler looks to pass.\nCharles Leno blocks the Raiders' Aldon Smith as quarterback Jay Cutler looks to pass.\n(Jose M. Osorio / Chicago Tribune) “What can I say? I feel great,” Leno said. “Hometown team. Born and raised in Oakland and been a fan of them for my whole life. I just wanted to go out there and show what I can do. I think I did that. I think I did that through preseason but like I told you, I didn’t play as well as I was supposed to and I knew I could play better and I feel like I did that today.\n“This is going to give me a lot of confidence. I am just ready for an opportunity. My job was to be the swing guy and my job was to come in and step up and I feel like I did that.”\nThe strength of the Raiders defense, such as it is, is the defensive line with Smith, Justin Tuck and Khalil Mack. Playing at Soldier Field helps. Yes, the grass surface is maligned by pretty much everyone -- everyone but offensive linemen. The grass slows down opposing pass rushers. If Leno plays again this coming week, it will be a different experience and the Chiefs have even better pass rushers with Justin Houston and Tamba Hali, among others.\n“Charles Leno, you can’t say enough,” right tackle Kyle Long said. “Going into a game when you have Khalil Mack, Aldon Smith, Mario Edwards and various other guys on the edge and you’ve got two guys that are new, in particular a left tackle and it is first start, he was aces. He did such a great job today. The sky is the limit for him.”\n4. One thing I had wondered recently was if undrafted rookie free agent Cameron Meredith would warrant a greater look from the coaches in the games if Marquess Wilson continued to get a high percentage of playing time without much production. It’s hard to judge the Seattle game in Week 3 given the fact quarterback Jay Cutler was out and the offense produced next to nothing, but through three games Wilson was on the field for 158 of 185 snaps (85.4 percent). He was targeted nine times and had three receptions for 69 yards with the bulk of it coming on the 50-yarder against the Packers in the opener when Cutler kept a play alive and Wilson sprung free from cornerback Sam Shields.\nBut Wilson stepped up with his biggest game in three seasons with six catches for 80 yards. He caught two balls on the game-winning drive, a 6-yarder on third-and-3 and a 9-yarder that put Robbie Gould in field goal range. They came after a drop with a minute remaining.\n“I thought Marquess did a heck of a job,” Cutler said. “Coming up big. Some big-time catches. He had the drop, came back, had a couple of catches in a row.”\nMarquess Wilson Nam Y. Huh / AP Wide receiver Marquess Wilson makes a catch against the Raiders' Neiko Thorpe during the second half.\nWide receiver Marquess Wilson makes a catch against the Raiders' Neiko Thorpe during the second half.\n(Nam Y. Huh / AP) I don’t think we can say Wilson has arrived but he needed to go out there and produce and he did. He’s still a young player with limited playing time the past two seasons. I can shelve the Meredith idea for now. No question about that. Let’s see if Wilson can string a few games together although Alshon Jeffery could potentially return next week. We’ll have to see how involved he is at practice during the middle of the week.\n5. The maligned special teams unit got its biggest boost of the season from Robbie Gould when he nailed a 49-yard field goal with two seconds remaining to clinch the victory. Earlier in the game he connected from 54 yards, his third from 50-plus this season. He’s 9 for 9 on field goals through four games.\nIt was the 12th game winner of his career and tied for the longest. He hit a 49-yarder to the same South end zone to defeat the Seahawks in overtime of the divisional round playoff game on Jan. 14, 2007. Ten of Gould’s game-winners have come at Soldier Field and of those, nine have been to the South. The only game-winner he hit to the North was a 44-yarder in Week 2 of the 2009 season to defeat the Pittsburgh Steelers 17-14 with 15 seconds remaining. This was his first game-winner since Nov. 17, 2013, against the Ravens.\nRobbie Gould John J.

Kim / Chicago Tribune) “All of my game winners have been down there, all except for Pittsburgh,” Gould said. “I like that wind. It’s just comfortable.”\nGould said he aimed for the right post and knew the ball would carry through.\nKickoffs were a bit of an adventure. The Bears went to popped up kicks to limit big returns even though the Raiders return man Taiwan Jones missed the game. One Gould kick off went out of bounds, putting Oakland at its own 40-yard line to begin a possession. As I’ve written, the kickoff coverage issues are more on the 10 players out there with Gould than his kickoffs.\n6. Fill-in punter Spencer Lanning was the man charged with holding the snap of Thomas Gafford on the field goal. Lanning was officially signed Saturday with Pat O’Donnell missing the game with a right knee injury. Lanning was part of a tryout on Wednesday and the Bears asked him to hold as well as punt. That’s not something punters do at every tryout. He was in Carolina for a look from the Panthers on Tuesday and they only asked him to punt. That tryout, though, was as much about putting Brad Nortman on notice for some shaky performances as anything else. The Panthers just wanted to see what was available.\nLanning did a lot of holding for Gould when he was a camp leg with the Bears in 2011 and he developed a strong bond with Gould then, calling him a “great friend.”\nSpencer Lanning David Banks / Getty Images Spencer Lanning warms up before Sunday's game.\nSpencer Lanning warms up before Sunday's game.\n(David Banks / Getty Images) “I think we worked on more on holding than punting when I first got here for at least a couple weeks,” said Lanning, who punted for the Browns the last two seasons.\n7. When Antrel Rolle went down with an ankle injury , he said the first thing he did was look down expecting to see his right foot turned the wrong direction. That’s how bad it felt. X-rays came back clean and the Bears will work to get a better handle on the nature and severity of the injury beginning Monday.\n“Thank God everything is good. I’ll be all right,” Rolle said. “I am a fighter. My body heals fairly well and I am going to push and push and give it everything I’ve got.”\nAntrel Rolle Brian Cassella / Chicago Tribune Antrel Rolle is taken off the field with an injury.\nAntrel Rolle is taken off the field with an injury.\n(Brian Cassella / Chicago Tribune) Rolle, 32, has been remarkably durable throughout his career and has missed only one game in the last nine seasons. Undrafted rookie free agent Harold Jones-Quartey filled in for him. The only other safety on the roster was Chris Prosinski, who was signed to help on special teams this week. Jones-Quartey was claimed off waivers from the Arizona Cardinals at final cuts.\n“I was excited,” he said. “I hate to see a guy like Antrel go down but I was excited to go out there and do what it takes to help the team win.”\nA month in now, Jones-Quartery, who played at Division II Findlay, feels like he has a good grasp on the defense.\n“I was watching from the sideline and just learning from my teammates,” he said. “I was staying in my book and it made it pretty easy with the guys around me. Of course, I am comfortable. If I hear my number called, I am going to do what it takes to help the team win. That’s all I can think about.”\nIf Rolle is out this week, it’s possible the Bears would promote Demontre Hurst from the practice squad. He has been worked at safety and nickel cornerback.\n8. If Jack Del Rio has vacancy in his dog house , you have to believe running back Latavius Murray will be taking up residence there soon. Like this week. Murray bobbled a pass in the flat that turned into a Pernell McPhee interception and then he fumbled a clean pitch by quarterback Derek Carr at midfield in the fourth quarter with the Raiders driving. Sam Acho recovered the fumble. Murray didn’t play again, replaced by Roy Helu Jr.\n“We did what we thought we could at the end to give ourselves a lift,” Del Rio said.\nThat is a rough outing and the Bears did a nice job against the run as Oakland managed only 70 yards on 22 carries. Murray had 16 carries for 49 yards. The run defense will be tested at a much higher level by Jamaal Charles in Kansas City next week.\n9. Not sure what the Raiders were thinking in giving the Bears such soft coverage on the final drive. The cornerback were playing off and it made it easy for short out routes as the Bears dinked and dunked their way into field goal range. Sure, you don’t want to give up the big play there and Oakland surrendered far too many downfield completions in the first three weeks, but it was almost too easy. I asked Raiders defensive end Justin Tuck about the ease in which the Bears were able to reach the boundary.\nPhotos of Bears quarterback Jay Cutler.\n“It looked that way because it was evident,” Tuck said. “They did a good job of managing the clock there and getting out of bounds. They kept the drive moving. We have to find a way to stop them and get off the field.”\nSome different calls were probably warranted.\n10. The Raiders were concerned about Pernell McPhee coming into the game in pass-rushing situations. They wanted to avoid situations where the outside linebacker could be manned up on a tight end, fearful that he would get to Carr, who had been sacked only once coming into the game, on a busted screen pass when he ran out of bounds. But McPhee was allowed to work on a tight end on the third-and-2 play that kept the Bears alive. He easily overpowered tight end Clive Walford to stuff Roy Helu Jr. in the backfield for a 1-yard loss. McPhee came from the backside and just blew up the play in the backfield. As productive as McPhee has been, I’d imagine opposing offenses begin scheming for him more.\n10a. Jarvis Jenkins beat former Bear J’Marcus Webb for his third sack of the season -- one more than Jenkins had in the last three seasons with the Redskins. A continued pass rush from Jenkins will free up the outside linebackers for more 1-on-1 situations.\n10b. Rookie linebacker John Timu had five signs hanging in his locker last week. They all had the same message -- 8 a.m. Weigh In. Weigh-ins are held on Thursdays and he missed his in Week 3 when the staff had to go looking for him in Halas Hall. That’s a fine.\n“I just wanted to make sure that the warning I had was good enough,” Timu said. “It slipped my mind, they had to come look for me. It’s everything. It’s details. You have to do everything right.”\nI asked Timu, who made a special teams tackle, why he didn’t have an alarm or message programmed in his phone. He said his phone is always off. Why? Because if it were to go off in a meeting, that’s another no-no.\n10c. Fill-in left guard Patrick Omameh , who started 16 games for the Buccaneers last season, said he was ready this week to start if called upon. The Bears stuck with Vladimir Ducasse at right guard despite five penalties through the first three games.\n“I am feeling good,” Omameh said. “I’m a guy that prides myself in being able to catch onto things pretty quick and I feel like I am in a good spot. I’ve been in a number of offenses over the years and I feel like there isn’t much in this system that I haven’t seen in the past. Most of the schemes are similar. It’s really only a matter of a few differences in technique philosophies and that. Otherwise, it’s all about the same.”\nWith the Will Montgomery situation, perhaps Omameh is in position to start at guard this week.\n10d. The victory didn’t create much buzz for Las Vegas oddsmakers. They had the Bears as a 10-point underdog for this coming Sunday’s game at the Chiefs (1-3) when the opening numbers were hung.\n10e. Fox has assigned the broadcast crew of Sam Rosen, John Lynch and Pam Oliver for Sunday game against the Chiefs at Arrowhead Stadium. Rosen is plenty familiar with the Bears as he handles their preseason games.\n Chicago Bears Oakland Raiders Robbie Gould John Fox Amari Cooper Antrel Rolle Kansas City Chiefs", "external_links": ["http://www.tribpub.com/privacy-policy-and-your-privacy-rights/", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-56127910/turbine/ct-brad-biggs-bears-raiders-20151005-007", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-5611cfa3/turbine/chi-jay-cutler-chicago-bears-photos-20140102", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-561273a9/turbine/ct-brad-biggs-bears-raiders-20151005-001", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-561273a5/turbine/ct-brad-biggs-bears-raiders-20151005-002", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-56127906/turbine/ct-brad-biggs-bears-raiders-20151005-006", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-56127915/turbine/ct-brad-biggs-bears-raiders-20151005-005", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-561273a2/turbine/ct-brad-biggs-bears-raiders-20151005", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-5612790c/turbine/ct-brad-biggs-bears-raiders-20151005-004", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-5611bbad/turbine/chi-jay-cutler-chicago-bears-photos-20140102-067", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-56127909/turbine/ct-brad-biggs-bears-raiders-20151005-008", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-56127913/turbine/ct-brad-biggs-bears-raiders-20151005-003", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-5611bbb1/turbine/chi-jay-cutler-chicago-bears-photos-20140102-065"], "published": "2015-10-05T16:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T01:46:51.754+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
