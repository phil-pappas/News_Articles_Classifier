That’s when the five-time Super Bowl-winning NFL team goes head-to-head with the Baltimore Ravens.\nJust two years ago the 49ers and Ravens fought one of the great Super Bowls, with the east coast team hanging on for a 34-31 victory.\nToday both teams stink. They’ve lost four games and had one victory, records their proud fans can’t stomach.\nThe 49ers will literally limp into the game with running backs Carlos Hyde and Reggie Bush suffering foot and calf injuries respectively.\nHyde is officially listed as “questionable” for the game while Bush is a longer shot at playing after being tagged “doubtful”. Kick returner and wide-receiver Bruce Ellington also has a leg injury.\nCoach Jim Tomsula put on an optimistic face on Friday about Hyde and Bush after reports had Hyde limping off the field shortly into Thursday’s practice.\n“Fully expect him to play,” said Tomsula, discussing Hyde, who has been the 49ers’ standout player.\nTomsula added the team’s trainers continue to work with Bush. That leaves rookies Hayne and Mike Davis as the only 49ers’ running backs.\nThe 49ers like Hayne as a punt returner but have shown little confidence in him as a running back, only bringing the former NRL star on a few times in the regular season when they needed to rest their banged up top options.\nOn Friday Tomsula continued the cautious theme on Hayne, who just a few months ago had never played an NFL game. “I mean, it’s a guy that’s never played football,” Tomsula said.\nThe Ravens, knowing the 49ers’ running back depth is thin, will undoubtedly attempt to batter Hyde out of the game.\nIf successful, it will be left to rookies Hayne and Davis to pull them from the abyss.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T12:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T07:52:27.262+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
