Fourth-place Rennes also has 15 points ahead of Sunday's match in Monaco.\nThe three clubs are five points behind leader Paris Saint-Germain.\nTorrential rain played havoc in Nice, where the host was tied at 2-2 with Nantes after 46 minutes when their match was suspended.\nAngers continued its excellent run of form with a 1-0 win over Bastia for its fifth league victory, a result that provisionally lifted the promoted side to second place in the standings, two points behind PSG. Billy Ketkeophomphone scored the winner in the 41st minute against a Bastia side which had only four attempts at goal.\nElsewhere, last-place Ajaccio failed to hold on to its lead in a 2-2 draw against Toulouse after defender Issiaga Sylla scored an own goal by diverting a shot from Martin Braithwaite into the net and Guingamp won 1-0 at 10-man Troyes.\nCarpi stun Torino\nPromoted Carpi stunned Torino 2-1 for their first Serie A win Saturday, days after sacking Fabrizio Castori and appointing Beppe Sannino as coach.\nTorino, stays third overall and two points adrift of leader Fiorentina and Inter Milan which play Sunday.\nChievo Verona missed the chance to move above Torino when they were held 1-1 by Verona in the day's late kickoff.\nThe hosts trailed to Eros Pisano's 70th-minute goal before Lucas Nahuel Castro levelled seven minutes from time. — Agencies", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T06:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T02:58:56.437+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
