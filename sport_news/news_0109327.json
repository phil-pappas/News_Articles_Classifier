Mandatory Credit: Mike Carter-USA TODAY Sports (Photo: USA TODAY Sports) \nEAST LANSING – “The Journey” set out last week to tell the story of Michigan State defensive end Shilique Calhoun and ended up with some of the best footage out there of the aftermath of the Spartans’ 27-23 win at Michigan. \nCalhoun is featured in the Big Ten Network’s award-winning reality show, in an episode that debuted Wednesday night. He visits his high school, Middletown High in Middletown Township, N.J., and hangs out with high school coach Joe Trezza and old friends while draining lefty jumpers on an outdoor court. \nHis mother, Cynthia Mimes, talks about the importance of her son returning for his senior season to finish his degree. Meanwhile, a Jim Harbaugh press conference and radio show, and Ann Arbor barbershop are featured to set up the big game, and BTN’s cameras get crunching footage of the action set against both schools’ radio calls. \nThen, the jackpot. After a slow-motion end zone shot of Jalen Watts-Jackson’s 38-yard rumble return to win the game for MSU as time expires, BTN comes from the MSU sideline as players race to where Watts-Jackson is lying in the end zone. Hey Joe: Mailbag on lucky wins, cheering in the press box \nIt’s an up-close look at the chaos, with screaming players everywhere. There are shots of euphoric MSU fans and dejected U-M fans. Calhoun does a special handshake with DeAnthony Arnett and Lawrence Thomas. Players make space for Watts-Jackson, in clear pain on the ground with a dislocated and fractured hip. \nThen it’s R.J. Shelton in the front row of the MSU fan section, celebrating with his mother, Erin Broome. Michael Geiger, MSU’s 5-foot-8 kicker, bear hugs 6-6 defensive tackle Malik McDowell. \nThe Paul Bunyan trophy is paraded around and, as Arjen Colquhoun and Macgarrett Kings Jr. carry it out of the stadium, MSU’s Josiah Price says: “Craziest thing that you’ll ever see.” Amazing camerawork to capture final play and @MSU_Football reaction to miracle finish at Ann Arbor. https://t.co/SV7UY7Ogh7 @richarddeitsch — The Journey (@BTNJourney) October 22, 2015 \nIn the locker room, MSU’s Chris Frey hugs co-defensive coordinator Mike Tressel and says: “Always comes down to special teams.” \nThe episode finishes with Dantonio gathering his team together, inviting his players to his house and imploring them to “be careful” as they celebrate. \n“The most important thing, we’re 7-0!” Dantonio yells. “Our dreams are still alive!” \nIs it contagious? Watts-Jackson’s week of stardom continued Thursday with an appearance on ESPN’s popular radio show, “Mike & Mike.” Mike Greenberg and Mike Golic both agreed that Watts-Jackson should plan for a July trip to Los Angeles for the “ESPY” awards – his winning return would seem to be a lock as a nominee for Play of the Year. MSU's Watts-Jackson thanks fans, U-M Hospital workers \nA day earlier at his first public comments since the play and the injury, Watts-Jackson laughed at the fact that he rooms with MSU cornerback Vayante Copeland and running back Madre London. Copeland is out for the season with a fractured vertebra and London is out for an undetermined period of time with leg injury. \n“The first joke was, man, there's got to be something in the water,” Watts-Jackson said. “Because first Vayante and then Madre - but Madre will be back - and now me. It's like, man, we're all hurt. I don't know how this happens. \n“We were all just talking during camp like this is going to be a big season for us, and then Vayante and Madre came out with a really big first game. … We all decided like we tried to make light of the situation, don't try to dwell on it too much because like we're still young. We've still got a lot of football ahead of us.” \nRespect given : After three straight shutouts for U-M, MSU scored three touchdowns and had a season-high 386 yards on the Wolverines. But MSU co-offensive coordinator Dave Warner said U-M’s defense was as strong as advertised. \n“They’re a great defense,” Warner said. “Very well-coached and they were very good up front most especially, and obviously we had trouble moving around and getting a good run game going. Back end, they’re good back there but we felt our wide receivers matched up OK there. So we knew it would be a challenge going into the game and thought we would be able to run the ball better, but as things went on we had to sort of go a different direction, and fortunately we had some receivers that stepped up. And Connor, first of all those receivers got open, and second of all Connor did a great job of putting the ball in great spots.” 310 CONNECT 15 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://on.lsj.com/1LPGlLX TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T00:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T09:33:31.081+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
