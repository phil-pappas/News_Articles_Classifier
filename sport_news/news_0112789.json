The Colts started things off by beating the Texans on Thursday night, and Pittsburgh finished off the week by shocking San Diego with quarterback Michael Vick starting under center on Monday.\nAdChoices Week 6 looks to provide just as many opportunities for a few underdogs to defy the odds and emerge victorious. Based on the listed odds from Sportsbookreview.com , here are five potential upsets for this week:\nChicago (+3) at Detroit\n© Doug Pensinger/Getty Images Quarterback Matthew Stafford #9 of the Detroit Lions delivers a pass against the Denver Broncos at Ford Field on September 27, 2015 in Detroit, Michigan. The Broncos defeated the Lions 24-12. Oddsmakers haven’t totally given up on the winless Lions, but it’s growing increasingly difficult to understand why. Detroit ranks 30th in scoring offense (16.6 points per game) and point differential (-55), 26th in scoring defense (27.6) and dead last in turnovers committed (15).\nThe Lions are also coming off an embarrassing 25-point home loss to the Cardinals, in which head coach Jim Caldwell was forced to pull quarterback Matthew Stafford (who now leads the NFL in interceptions with eight) early in the second half of the game.\nThe Bears are gaining some confidence under new head coach John Fox, having come from behind to beat the Raiders and Chiefs in back-to-back weeks. These two teams are trending in opposite directions.\nMiami (+1) at Tennessee\n© Jim Brown-USA TODAY Sports Tennessee Titans quarterback Marcus Mariota (8) fakes the hand off during the second half against the Buffalo Bills at Nissan Stadium. Buffalo won 14-13. Never underestimate the power of making an in-season coaching change, especially for a team with as much talent as the Dolphins have. Sunday will be the first game for interim head coach Dan Campbell, who has had the better part of two weeks to both correct Miami’s many issues and reunite a torn-apart locker room. The change could provide the spark needed for the Dolphins coming off the bye week.\nMeanwhile, the Titans have lost three straight games, including the last two at home. Quarterback Marcus Mariota could have a long afternoon if the Miami defensive line suddenly comes alive under Campbell. The rookie has thrown three interceptions with a passer rating of 77.4 over his last two games.\nBaltimore at San Francisco (+1.5)\n© AP Photo/Gail Burton Baltimore Ravens quarterback Joe Flacco looks for a receiver in the first half of an NFL football game against the Cleveland Browns, Sunday, Oct. 11, 2015, in Baltimore. These two teams allowed 1,030 total yards combined in Week 5, including 863 passing. Making the Ravens a slight road favorite likely has to do with favoring Joe Flacco over Colin Kaepernick at quarterback.\nBut don’t sleep on the 49ers at home, especially defensively. In two games at Levi’s Stadium in 2015, San Fransisco has allowed just 20 total points, with eight sacks. The Ravens have already committed six turnovers in three road games this season.\nMore importantly, Kaepernick finally showed some signs of life in New York, throwing for 262 yards and two scores against the Giants in Week 5. Baltimore ranks 25th in passing yards allowed, and Josh McCown torched them for 447 a week ago.\nCarolina (+7) at Seattle\n© Bob Donnan-USA TODAY Sports Carolina Panthers quarterback Cam Newton (1) reacts in the fourth quarter. The Panthers defeated the Saints 27-22 at Bank of America Stadium. Two important factors give the unbeaten Panthers a chance to go on the road and upset the Seahawks in CenturyLink Field. For starters, Carolina fields a defense that ranks fourth in the NFL in points allowed (17.8 per game). The unit will also get the benefit of having All-Pro linebacker Luke Kuechly on the field, as he had missed the last three games with a concussion.\nQuarterback Cam Newton provides the second factor. He’s accounted for nine touchdowns and over 1,000 yards of total offense during Carolina’s 4-0 start. The Panthers are averaging 27.0 points per game despite Newton throwing to a group led by Greg Olsen and Ted Ginn. A team capable of limiting points on defense and receiving productive quarterback play on offense can win anywhere, even Seattle.\nNew York Giants (+4) at Philadelphia\n© Robert Deutsch-USA TODAY Sports Could Eli Manning and the Giants pull off a questionable upset against the Eagles? Why is there no love for the NFC East-leading Giants? New York has won three straight games, including primetime victories over Washington and San Francisco.\nQuarterback Eli Manning has been red-hot during the streak, throwing eight touchdowns and possessing a passer rating of 107.2 over the last three games. And while the Eagles are coming off a blowout win over the Saints, the Philadelphia defense is still ranked 26th against the pass. Manning can still have a big game even if go-to receiver Odell Beckham Jr. can’t play. The Giants have six players with at least 10 catches and a touchdown this season.\nAnother important factor to consider: New York’s defense ranks second in rushing yards and first in yards per attempt through five weeks. Manning plus a strong run defense is more than enough for the Giants to go on the road and win on Monday night.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.sportsbookreview.com/betting-odds/nfl-football/", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-10-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T02:25:43.959+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
