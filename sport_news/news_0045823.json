Forced to make a tough decision - brave a freak storm and risk losing her crew or assume Mark's dead and escape to safety - Commander Melissa Lewis opts for the latter.\nWatney survives and \"sciences the sh*t out of this\", creating video logs and attempting to get by on the meagre supplies he has, hoping NASA discovers that he's alive and works on a way to bring him back home.\nThey're faced with two options: Send him fresh supplies and wait for the next manned mission to Mars to reach him or just ask his crew members to turn back and retrieve him with a little help from 'friends in need'.\nWith all of Earth rooting for his return and NASA under mounting pressure to find a way to 'bring him back', hard decisions have to be made. Will Watney cheat death a second time and come home?\nWhat's hot:\nBased on the Andy Weir novel of the same name, The Martian has the charismatic Matt Damon playing the never-say-die Mark Watney. Scott is firmly in the driver's seat and the supporting cast is top-notch. The screenplay (Drew Goddard) keeps the enthusiasm for a man-alone castaway alive with some strong moments, especially through the humorous lines given to Matt to mouth. The drama of the intense moments are intact as well and that's always a good sign. Then there's some strong camera work by Dariusz Wolski ( Prometheus and next week's The Walk ) who has you scanning the screen in appreciation. And despite its long running time and explanations on video logs, there's not a moment where you feel that this film is boring. Because it isn't.\nWhat's not:\nIf you've read the book and then watch this film, you'll find that while the content has largely been retained, there are a few omissions and quite a few creative liberties taken. Also, there is a head-scratching moment when you realise that Chiwetel​ Ejiofor plays Vincent Kapoor, but India barely registers in the story. Wonder how that happened.\nWhat to do:\nA solid entertainer that's high on entertainment, humour and science, it is a space-flick you shouldn't miss.\nWatch Trailer:", "external_links": ["https://apis.google.com/js/platform.js", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ue4PCI0NamI"], "published": "2015-10-02T17:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T04:27:04.785+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
