We don't give up and we never will.\"\nGKLL backed Bruno's assertion by scoring four runs in that final frame and winning, 6-5, capturing the state title for the first time in the program's 59 years and earning a berth in Little League's Mid-Atlantic regional in Bristol, Conn.\nGreat Kills' next test will come on Friday, when the 11- and 12-year-olds face Conococheague (Md.) at 5 p.m.\nThe winner came off an RBI single by Noah Echavarria .\nGreat Kills went into the game without three top pitchers including ace James Greig . Each had pitched earlier in the state tourney and was prohibited from taking the mound on Monday.\nTo make matters worse, Fayetteville had its ace ready to go.\nDuring practice on Sunday, Great Kills manager Frank Cambria settled on Bruno, saying that he felt a \"great vibe\" from the young pitcher's slider and fastball.\nBruno threw three innings and gave up five runs before he was replaced by righty Tom Bonviso , but Cambria said Bruno did more than enough.\n\"Five runs, that's nothing for us,\" Cambria said. \"I got so much confidence in this team, I was not worried about the five runs.\"\nBonviso held Fayetteville scoreless over two marvelous innings, striking out three, but Fayetteville's ace, Josh Loeffler , was busy hurling a gem, striking out five and holding Great Kills to two runs over five innings.\nWhen Loeffler took the mound in the top of the sixth, his pitch count was at 69 (the limit is 85), and that's when Great Kills took advantage.\nJerry Huntzinger started the comeback on the first pitch he saw, hitting a home run over the center field fence and bringing Great Kills to within 5-3.\n\"( Coach ) said, 'The first pitch is going to be right down the middle - jump on it,'\" said Huntzinger, who went 2-for-3 with three RBI and scored twice. \"I knew if I didn't get a home run, I was going to get a base hit.\"\nGreig, Sean Favkovec and Johnathan Carbonella each singled to load the bases, and Greig scored on a wild pitch by Loeffler.\nBonviso grounded out and Favkovec was tagged out trying to score on another wild pitch, but Carbonella moved into scoring position on the play.\nNick Perry came in to relieve Loeffler, and the starting pitcher took shortstop. The next batter, Michael Briordy , hit an easy ground ball to Loeffler, who fielded it cleanly but made a wild throw to first. Carbonella scored on the play, tying the game at 5-5.\nThe error allowed Briordy - who represented the winning run - to move up to second base. Briordy scored the go-ahead run on Eschavarria's bloop single over the second baseman's head.\n\"Our starting pitcher, the player we relied on all season long to get here, ran out of pitches and ran out of gas,\" said Fayetteville manager Mike Hoalcraft . \"They put the ball in play and put pressure of us defensively.\"\nBonviso closed out the game with a 1-2-3 sixth inning that included two strikeouts and a groundout.\nThe victory marked the second championship game that Great Kills won by coming from behind late. Great Kills used a four-run rally to win the city tournament on July 22, a 13-12 thriller over Franklin Square Park.\n\"These kids don't want to give up,\" Cambria said of his players. \"They want to go all the way to Williamsport , the way they're playing. They have given us everything they've got, and I'm very proud of them.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T13:15:43.368+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
