Green and Ray Rai­mo, the two Manches­ter-based attorneys who ini­tially rep­resented Caplin in the wake of the murders, are back as his defense team, accord­ing to the court file. \nRaimo asked the court to appoint Green as co-coun­cil \"because of the serious­ness of the allegations and the complexity of matters\" in Caplin's case, according to his motion. \nProsecutors, documents state, raised no objections to Raimo's motion. \nCaplin's next scheduled appearance in court is a bail hearing set for Friday, Oct. 30. A dispositional con­ference is scheduled for Nov. 9, with trial set to start Dec. 20, documents state. \nBarnaby, meanwhile, is scheduled for a bail hear­ing on Tuesday, Oct. 27, after the court granted prosecutor's motion to re­schedule the hearing from Sept. 15. \nAccording to his file, Barnaby is scheduled for a dispositional conference on Nov. 18. \nBoth men are charged with two first-degree and two second-degree mur­der charges in the deaths of Charlene Ranstrom and Brenda Warner on Oct. 3, 1988. \nBarnaby was tried for the murders three times and each resulted in a hung jury. Caplin was initially arrested in June 1990 and charged in the killings, but never went to trial and had the charges dropped the following month. \nPolice say Barnaby re­portedly confessed to beat­ing, tying up and repeat­edly stabbing the women, as well as discussing his hatred of their life­style, but he later re­canted. \nProsecu­tors initial­ly opted against a fourth trial and Barn­aby returned to Canada, until four years ago when new evidence and addition­al witness accounts led to new warrants in April 2011 for the arrest of Caplin and Barnaby, childhood friends from the Restigouche Indi­an Reservation in Quebec. \nDean Shalhoup can be reached at 594-6443, dshalhoup@nashua telegraph.com or @Telegraph_ DeanS.
