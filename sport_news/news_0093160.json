That has changed. Now the Wildcats are top dogs, too ... at least heading into the playoffs. Having already secured a postseason berth, Milton on Saturday punctuated a dream start to coach Steve Dembowski’s first year at the helm by beating Wellesley, 14-7, on the road to claim the Bay State Conference Herget Division title for the first time ever. The Wildcats (7-0), fresh off their first league championship of any kind since 1963, got their expected reward on Sunday. They were slotted as the No. 1 seed in the MIAA’s Division 3 Southwest Sectional playoffs. Marshfield (7-0 in Div. 2 South) and Cohasset (6-1 in Div. 6 South) were Ledgerland’s other top seeds. The Rams’ and Skippers’ success is no surprise – they are both defending state champions. Milton, on the other hand, had just one winning season in the previous 13 years before morphing into a juggernaut this fall. “It was good for the kids, and the community support was overwhelming,” Dembowski said of the aftermath of Saturday’s come-from-behind win. “It was a good day for us. The police and fire department met us at the (Milton) border and drove us around town. People were really excited.” Milton trailed 7-6 with less then two minutes remaining before quarterback Mike Fallon made two huge plays, converting a fourth-and-7 with a pass to Derek Perkins and then hitting David Perkins for a 21-yard touchdown. Milton, which hosts No. 8 Norwood (3-4) on Friday night at 7 in the sectional opener, will be hoping for more big plays as it tries to navigate a field that includes No. 2 North Attleboro (7-0) and No. 3 Duxbury (6-1). “We understand how special this is for the community and for (the players),” Dembowski said. “But we still have all these games left to play. I think it’s hard to get too excited. “I guess I’ll probably know how they feel about it (when practice starts this week). If they come to work hard on Tuesday, I’ll know that they’re not satisfied. If that’s all they wanted was to win the Herget Division I guess I gotta do a better job of motivating them.” Here’s a look at the rest of the MIAA playoff landscape. Dates and times for first-round games have not been announced yet, but assume most will be on Friday at 7 p.m.: Sixteen Ledgerland teams made it. Thirteen did not, include three hard-luck clubs that were squeezed out despite finishing the regular season above the top-eight cutoff mark: Page 2 of 3 - Canton (5-2) was No. 6 in the Div. 4 South power ratings, but the Bulldogs were bumped by No. 9 Apponequet (4-3), which earned an automatic berth by finishing in second place in South Coast Large. Rockland (3-4) suffered the same fate in Div. 5 South. The Bulldogs finished No. 8 in the power ratings but were bumped by automatic qualified Dover-Sherborn (No. 9, 5-2), the runner-up in the Atlantic Coast League. Ditto for Carver (4-3) in Div. 6 South, which finished in eighth place but was bumped by No. 10 St. John Paul II (4-3) from the Catholic Central Small. On the other hand, Blue Hills (5-2), the Mayflower Large runner-up, used the same strategy to bump Upper Cape (5-2) out of the No. 7 seed in Div. 6 South. The Warriors finished ninth in the power ratings but are in the playoffs for the fifth time in six years. After a regular season that was mere formality, Marshfield begins its Div. 2 state title defense when it hosts No. 8 Quincy (1-6) – the unlikeliest of playoff participants. No other South Sectional playoff team has fewer than three wins, but the Presidents took advantage of a weak field that saw only Durfee (2-5), Barnstable (1-6) and Taunton (0-7) fail to qualify. Cohasset opens up at home against St. John Paul II in the first round. The Skippers have two 7-0 teams in their bracket – No. 2 Nantucket and No. 3 Bishop Connolly. In Div. 5 South, No. 4 Abington (6-1) begins defense of its state championship by hosting No. 5 Greater New Bedford (5-2) on Friday at 7. The Green Wave could get a rematch against No. 1 East Bridgewater in the semis. The Vikings beat Abington 21-0 in Week 4. Abington avenged a similar regular-season setback to EB in last year’s sectional final. In Div. 1 South, No. 4 BC High (4-3) hosts No. 5 Catholic Memorial (3-4) in the first round. Those Catholic Conference teams will play again at Fenway Park on the night before Thanksgiving. Speaking of familiar foes, we have another Battle of Plymouth in Div. 3 Southeast, where No. 3 Plymouth North (6-1) hosts No. 6 Plymouth South (4-3) in the first round. This will be the third straight year these Thanksgiving foes will square off in the playoffs. South won 7-6 in 2013 (sectional final) and 21-14 in 2014 (first round). Welcome back, Archbishop Williams, which earned its first playoff berth since 2005. The Bishops (5-2) are seeded seventh in Div. 5 South and will play at CCL rival No. 2 Cardinal Spellman (7-0) in the first round. These teams will meet again on Thanksgiving. Duxbury is in the playoffs for an eighth straight season, but this will be the Green Dragons’ debut in Div. 3 Southwest after back-to-back first-round losses in Div. 2 South. Duxbury (6-1) is seeded third and will host No. 6 Hopkinton (4-3) in the first round. Page 3 of 3 - Hanover and Scituate each are making their third straight playoff appearance in Div. 4 South. Both are seeking their first playoff win under the new system. No. 3 Hanover (6-1), fresh off its Patriot League Fisher Division crown, hosts No. 6 Westwood (5-2) in the first round, and No. 5 Scituate (5-2) visits Fisher rival No. 4 Middleboro (5-2). Scituate beat Middleboro 34-13 at home two weeks ago. Braintree (3-4, No. 7 seed in Div. 2 South) and Whitman-Hanson (4-3, No. 8 seed in Div. 3 Southeast) are in the playoffs for a second straight year. Braintree’s appearance last year was its first since 1998. Weymouth (4-3, No. 7 seed in Div. 1 South) is back in the playoffs after missing out last year.
