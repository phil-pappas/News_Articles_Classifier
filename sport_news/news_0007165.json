Mattingly followed, and twice Ethier turned toward Mattingly and yelled at him while gesturing angrily with his arms, pointing twice at the field and twice directly at Mattingly. \n\"He was mad about the ump's call,\" Mattingly said. \"I was trying to settle him down. I didn't want him thrown out of the game, and Andre's pretty emotional. It was nothing more than trying to settle him down.\" \nAfter the Dodgers' 3-2 loss, which ended their season, Mattingly said he didn't think Ethier was angry with him.
