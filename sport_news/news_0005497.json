(AP Photo/John Raoux) Story Photos Brazil US Women Soccer ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) - Alex Morgan, Crystal Dunn and Stephanie McCaffrey scored to help the U.S women's team beat Brazil 3-1 in an exhibition game Sunday before an announced crowd of 32,869 at the Orlando Citrus.It was the Americans' second victory in a week over Brazil as the U.S. continues its World Cup victory tour. With the victory the U.S. extended home winning streak to 102 games.Morgan scored in ninth minute off a pass in the box from midfielder Tobin Heath to put the U.S. ahead.Brazil's Cristiane tied it in the 45th minute. But a minute later, the U.S. went back up for good after Lindsey Horan took Meghan Klingenberg's corner kick and tapped it to Dunn, who then slipped it past Luciana. McCaffrey added another goal just before the final horn.For the second straight match, the U.S. team bid farewell to retiring players. Sunday was the final international match for 29-year-old U.S. midfielder Lauren Holiday and 31-year-old defender Lori Chalupny. Holiday finished with 133 national team caps, and Chalupny had 106.Morgan easily got the loudest ovation from the Citrus Bowl crowd when her name was announced during pregame warmups.She then ignited the crowd early when she split a pair of defenders before maneuvering outside of Brazilian keeper Luciana to get a clear shot.The goal by Morgan could have been a preview of sorts for the hometown Orlando crowd.Morgan was the center of reports last week that she could soon be dealt from National Women's Soccer League's Portland Thorns to the expansion Orlando Pride, which begins play next year.Neither team has confirmed the deal, but the Pride has a news conference scheduled for Monday. Morgan's husband, Servando Carrasco, plays for Major League Soccer's Orlando City.When asked about the potential deal on Saturday Morgan said only that there were on-going negotiations, though she acknowledged having met Orlando ownership through Carrasco, and praised the budding soccer culture in Orlando.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T00:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T00:17:25.212+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
