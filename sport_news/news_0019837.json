Here are three observations.\nThe Bulls aren't sharp defensively\nThe Bulls allowed 38 points in the fourth quarter alone to the Pistons. And while that featured some non-rotation players, there hasn’t been much consistency otherwise either.\nPart of this, of course, has been the lack of a set rotation because of injuries to Derrick Rose and Mike Dunleavy and conservative approaches with Pau Gasol, Joakim Noah and Taj Gibson. But that can’t account for lack of transition defense, which is mostly effort.\n“Transition defense has been an issue,” Gasol said. “We have to be aware when the shot goes up to have one, two and possibly three sprinting back and containing the break. We haven’t done that. We have good stretches. And then we have terrible stretches. We have to work harder to get better.”\nCoach Fred Hoiberg also cited poor pick-and-roll defense and on-the-ball defense. Is that all?\n“The fact we’re not getting back in transition, that’s the disappointing thing. That’s something that you should be able to take care of every night. That’s obviously going to be a big emphasis in practice the next few days,” Hoiberg said. “We had guards that were supposed to get back who were crashing. You can’t do that.\n“Pick-and-roll defense, especially in the middle of the floor, we’re not keeping it on the side well enough. When we get into our ‘ICE’ defense on the side, it’s getting into the middle too much. And we’re giving up too many blow-byes. There’s nothing you can do about those. By the time you get over, it’s going to open up a wide open shot on the backside. So we gotta guard the ball better.”\nThe jumbo lineup experiment could be over\nIt was at least on Wednesday after one half. Hoiberg replaced Joakim Noah, who had started the first half with Pau Gasol at center and Nikola Mirotic at small forward, with Doug McDermott.\nNikola Mirotic on last season vs. this season Nikola Mirotic on last season vs. this season.\nNikola Mirotic on last season vs. this season.\nSee more videos Hoiberg said the lineup lacked energy at the start.\n“I felt we got some good looks. Defensively, I didn’t think it was very good,” Noah said. “I think I missed a lot of easy baskets around the rim. I think Pau made some great passes to me down low. Things are going to get better. But it’s not just me and Pau. Our whole team has to play better.”\nTaj Gibson looked solid in his exhibition debut\nIn his first game following offseason left ankle surgery, the versatile reserve logged less than 10 minutes, a total Hoiberg said would climb by next Monday’s game in Charlotte. Gibson played strong defense but admitted he could’ve finished better.\nTaj Gibson on his return to the court The Bulls' Taj Gibson talks about his return to the court.\nThe Bulls' Taj Gibson talks about his return to the court.\nSee more videos “I felt I could’ve done better. It’s just a different feeling being able to run up and down, especially in terms of competitiveness,” Gibson said. “I felt good from a leg standpoint. I think the sky is the limit. I feel great. But there’s a long way to go. I didn’t attack the rim the way I wanted to yet. That’s just jitters and being nervous. I’ll shake it off.”\nHoiberg said Gibson gave the Bulls “great energy.”\nPrivacy Policy Chicago Bulls Taj Gibson Fred Hoiberg Joakim Noah Pau Gasol Derrick Rose Mike Dunleavy", "external_links": ["http://www.tribpub.com/privacy-policy-and-your-privacy-rights/", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-561f26d9/turbine/ct-bulls-gibson-video-spt-20151014", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-561fb5af/turbine/ct-bulls-pistons-observations-20151015", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-561e8004/turbine/ct-nikola-mirotic-on-last-season-vs-this-season-20151014"], "published": "2015-10-15T17:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T19:15:42.471+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
