Jonathan Newton/The Washington Post Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue. \nThe Washington Redskins pulled off the biggest comeback in franchise history on Sunday, defeating the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, 31-30 , and now head into their bye week with a 3-4 record. \nThe victory brings temporary relief to a franchise that appeared to be teetering on the brink of disaster. Two straight losses (one on a gut-wrenching pick-six in overtime, one following a flat-out dismal showing in all phases), a desperate “code red” mandate by coach Jay Gruden and a 24-0 start by Tampa Bay on Sunday made for a sickened atmosphere at FedEx Field late in the first half. \nAlthough people within the organization had said Gruden and quarterback Kirk Cousins’s jobs were both safe regardless of Sunday’s outcome, the disastrous way in which yesterday’s game began begged the question as to whether or not ownership/management would stick to that plan, or would a blood bath instead ensue during the bye? \nBut Gruden and his men dug deep, rebounded and prevailed when they very easily could have rolled over. However, they didn’t have an option, they believed. \n“Why would we give up?” defensive end Ricky Jean Francois said. “If we had given up, we would’ve given y’all a whole different story. We’d be looking at ESPN tomorrow about how we gave up. So why? We had a whole two quarters of football to go. We knew we didn’t need to give up. We could still win the ball game.” \nNew to the team this year, Jean Francois didn’t understand that rolling over and settling for embarrassing defeats is what this team usually does when facing circumstances like Sunday’s. He and his teammates have insisted, however, that times are changing. And so, they scratched, clawed and fought their way out of the hole and came out on top. We’ll see if this is a defining moment, or if this was just a nice temporary reward to the fans for sticking through the suffering. \nFor now, here are five observations from that very un-Redskins-like victory. \n1. Gruden pulling out all the stops – Give Jay Gruden credit for the way he got his team to respond to a pressure-packed week and listless start to the game. Yes, Kirk Cousins had a lot of pressure on him, but Gruden needed that win almost more than anyone. Throughout the season, we’ve wondered about his ability to motivate, lead and also make in-game adjustments. Gruden answered questions all around on Sunday.

(John McDonnell/The Washington Post) \nPlayers had said they didn’t need the “code red” message from Gruden earlier in the week, but they certainly looked like they needed something as they went in at halftime down 24-7. Players said Gruden was livid at halftime, and was yelling and giving quite the tongue lashing. That at least partially ignited the team, although the coach downplayed any significance of his halftime speech or the whole “code red” thing. From an X’s and O’s standpoint, Gruden seemed sharper and more effective than we’ve seen all week. The run game continued to struggle, but the coach didn’t let that keep him from using the play-action, zone read and bootlegs to keep the Bucs off balance, as he has much of this season. The Redskins also took shots downfield more than in any other game. Gruden and offensive coordinator Sean McVay dialed up eight play-action passes, and Cousins – who does well rolling out and throwing on the run – completed seven of them. The game plan also featured five zone-read plays, one of which resulted in Cousins’s touchdown run. \nThese plays helped keep the defense honest, helped move the pocket and keep the defense from being able to tee off on the quarterback. Cousins averaged 7.93 yards per pass attempt (a season-high) a week after posting an average of 4.56 yards per pass. Gruden’s approach differed from previous weeks. Asked following other games why the team opted for few play-action passes, which not only help create opportunities downfield, but also soften up a defense to create more opportunities in the run game, Gruden had always said the team couldn’t because success in the run game had to come first and then create opportunities for those type of plays. But Sunday night, Gruden said “I think that around here, if you watch us on tape, I still think we have the threat of the run even though we may not be successful, I still think we can get the play-action off of them, we can still get some of the bootlegs which helped a little bit today.” The coach added that things remained far from perfect. That’s true. But for this game, he got the job done. \n[ D.C. Sports Bog: An oral history of how “You like that?\" came to be ] \n2. Cousins redemption – There’s one way to silence critics and earn job security: win. Cousins put his unit on his shoulders and willed them back from the dead and got a much-needed victory. Obviously, the start was not good. He had some errant passes, and on the sack-fumble play, he held on to the ball too long (failing to spot an open Jamison Crowder in time to avoid the turnover). But Cousins showed once again that he could respond to adversity, and for the second time this season, he directed a game-winning drive with only seconds left on the clock. Redskins tight end Jordan Reed is a happy man back on the bench after he caught the game-winning touchdown pass with 24 seconds left to beat the Bucs. (John McDonnell/The Washington Post) \nCousins completed 33 of 40 passes for a season-high 317 yards and three touchdowns. It should be noted, both on this point and on the Gruden point, that return of Jordan Reed had a lot to do with the success the offense and quarterback enjoyed. Reed creates so much for the offense and expands the number of and kinds of plays that the team can run and have a legitimate chance to succeed on. Cousins targeted Reed 13 times and completed 11 of those passes, the last of which was the game-clinching six-yard touchdown pass. Remember last week? Gruden said he wanted to see what his quarterback could do with more of a full collection of weapons. The Redskins still were without DeSean Jackson, but Reed made a big difference, and Cousins capitalized. \nSunday represented the first game in his career that Cousins has thrown three touchdowns and no interceptions. And, it was Cousins’s third interception-free game of the season. Interestingly enough, all three of those performances have led to wins. And as was the case with the win against the Eagles, Cousins got the job done without the assistance of a powerful rushing attack. Now, none of this is to say that Cousins has finally turned the corner, and that he has proven himself as a full-fledged NFL franchise quarterback. But he again justified Gruden’s loyalty, and produced what the Redskins hope are evidence of long-term growth and improvement. \n3. Run game struggles – Although Cousins got right, the run game still is not back up to par, and Gruden, Bill Callahan and McVay must spend a good chunk of time during the bye week figuring out what adjustments they must make to produce better results. Alfred Morris’s struggles continue. On Sunday, he rushed for a career-low five yards on six carries. Sunday represented the third single-digit carry day of the season for him. In his first three seasons combined, Morris had previously had only one single-carry game. \n[ Redskins’ snap counts: Jones gets more action than Morris ] \nMatt Jones didn’t have a great day, either, mustering 29 yards on nine carries, with a long of 11 yards. Some of Morris’s struggles do have to do with his approach, and his inability to settle into a rhythm while splitting carries. He has appeared tentative as he approaches holes. He’s a patient runner, but he needs to run with more confidence. \nBut the line hasn’t helped. On Sunday, there were very few cutback lanes for the backs. Josh LeRibeus got knocked back off the line a couple of times, and there was another run on which Trent Williams and Spencer Long failed to win their battles. Those shortcomings left Morris with nowhere to go. The same problems persisted when Jones ran. On another sweep to the outside, fullback Darrel Young served as a lead blocker for Morris and missed a block, and linebacker Kwon Alexander stopped Morris in the backfield. Had Young managed to pick up that defender, Morris would’ve been sprung for a decent gain. \nMorris’s lack of confidence doesn’t help matters. At least with Jones, there are times where he will just take the ball and run rather than trying to wait for something to open up. That produced some success, but switching starters will not magically solve everything. \n4. Run defense/pass rush – The numbers didn’t get any prettier against the run for the defense. And the pass rush didn’t produce better results. Doug Martin had a field day. \nAs was the case last week, Washington’s defenders continue to hurt themselves by overpursuing. By my count, seven times a defensive lineman or linebacker ran into the backfield only to over-run the back and get caught out of position to make a tackle. The backfield whiffs weren’t just limited to the running backs. The defenders also missed opportunities to sack Jameis Winston on five plays because they ran right by the quarterback and couldn’t slam on breaks, recover and make a play. \nSo, the opportunities are there. Players must figure out how to capitalize on them. There are still a lot of times where edge rushers fail to fight through blocks and are thus rendered useless. Losing Ryan Kerrigan, who could have to have surgery on his fractured right hand, will not help matters. He wasn’t having his most impactful year, but he did get into the backfield twice on Sunday to hurry Winston. Winston’s ability to stand tall in the pocket under little duress and complete 72 percent of his passes for 297 yards and two touchdowns and no interceptions is not a good sign for a unit that will face Tom Brady coming off of the bye. \n[ First and 10: Mark Maske reviews the week that was in the NFL ] \n5. Finally a special teams play that mattered – The special teams units have drawn all kinds of criticisms – and rightfully so – given the many gaffes committed in the past two seasons under Ben Kotwica (and in the years before he took over as well). And they’ve produced big plays at points of games where it didn’t matter. So, Sunday’s onside kick was tremendous because not only set up the Redskins with the ball, but it jump-started a drive that produced a touchdown. During their week of film study, Kotwica and his crew had noticed that on that side of the field, Tampa’s front line often starts bailing as soon as kicker approaches the ball. That’s why they believed they would have success catching them off-guard. Dustin Hopkins nailed the kick, and Trenton Robinson came up with the recovery. Hopkins also had a clutch day, nailing four extra-point attempts – the game-deciding kick came with him booting the ball into the wind – and four touchbacks. \nStill have questions?
