We’re going to have to play our best game to beat these guys.”\nThe Blue Jays lost the first two games of the division series to the Texas Rangers — at home, no less — and had to win three in a row to advance.\nThey face the same task, and the climb begins when they take the field in Game 5 on Wednesday afternoon.\n“Winning those two games in Texas and winning Game 5 here, they were all do-or-die,” said staff ace David Price, who would start a Game 6 in Kansas City. “This is something we’ve experienced already in the playoffs. I know this team is ready for the challenge.”\n“Hopefully we can score first,” reliever Aaron Sanchez said. “I feel like that’s been the biggest key in both series; whoever scores first seems to have the momentum their side.”\nMomentum is something these Jays know about.\nFrom the time the front office made several key trades in late July, the focus turned from not just making the playoffs and ending a postseason drought that had lasted since 1993, but to winning a World Series.\nThe addition of stars Price and Troy Tulowitzki — as well as complementary players such as outfielder Ben Revere and relievers Mark Lowe and LaTroy Hawkins — catapulted Toronto from six games behind the New York Yankees on Aug. 1 to finish six games ahead.\n“We lost 12 games in the regular season from the time I got traded,” Lowe said. “That just shows you right there how good we are. We’ve been down both these series, but we battled back once before, so there’s no doubt we can do it again.”\nThe offense that propelled the Blue Jays to the AL East title — a major league-leading 5.5 runs a game and .797 on-base-plus-slugging percentage (OPS) — has managed four runs a game and a .666 OPS in the ALCS.\nIf the Jays fall short this postseason, the trade deadline deals might have failed in one respect. But the foundation of a perennial playoff participant seems to be in place.\n“If you look around, there’s a lot of guys expected to be back next year. They’re all really good players. There’s a reason why we’re where were are right now,” Lowe said. “It’s not a fluke, it’s not just random guys having good years. I think it’s definitely going to carry over.”\nThe Jays have Tulowitzki under contract through 2020, but Price and Game 5 starter Marco Estrada will be eligible for free agency after the World Series.\nThe club can exercise options on Bautista and Encarnacion for one more year. But the core of the team goes deeper.\n“Look at all the young talent we have in this clubhouse,” Price said. “All these guys that have really come into their own — with (Kevin) Pillar and (Ryan) Goins, Tulo is going to be here for a long time, Sanchez, (Marcus) Stroman, all these guys — they’ve got a good core of young talent.\n“I love it here. This is a lot of fun. That’s something I’ll worry about when the time comes.”\nThat time will be Wednesday — unless the Jays can win and get the ball to Price for Game 6.\n“Tomorrow is a huge day for us,” Lowe said.\n“This is what this city has been missing for 20-something years now. I’m just thankful to be a part of something special.”\nGALLERY: ROYALS vs. BLUE JAYS\nALCS: Blue Jays vs. Royals\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.usatoday.com/sports/", "https://w.graphiq.com/w/ly5OmBfjRpb?data-uid=7d00c4a52b&data-campaign=303d21363f", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T21:04:45.060+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
