An NFL spokesman confirmed to the Honolulu Star-Advertiser that Vernon was fined, \"$17,363 for striking the quarterback (Mariota) in the knee area in the second quarter and $20,000 for striking the quarterback in the head and neck area in the third quarter\" of Sunday's game.\nTitans coach Ken Whisenhunt announced earlier today that Mariota will sit out Sunday's game against Atlanta with a knee injury.\nIt will be the first game Mariota has missed as a starter in four seasons â€” three at the University of Oregon.\nFor Vernon, the total fine amounts to almost 2.5 percent of his $1.53 million base salary.\nVernon, who claimed the second-quarter hit was not intended to injure Mariota, has said he will appeal the fine.\nMariota sustained what the Titans said was a sprained medial collateral ligament in his left knee in the second quarter of the 38-10 loss to the Dolphins when Olivier dove into the back of his left leg.\nMariota came out briefly and took the field with a knee brace.\n\"We are going to list him (Mariota) as out for this game, a combination of (him) just missing practice and not quite being there,\" Whisenhunt said on the Titans' website today. \"We want to get him back on the field as soon as possible, it just won't be this week.\"\nEarlier in the week, Mariota had said he hoped to play Sunday. Instead, Zach Mettenberger, who finished the 2014 season as the Titans' starter at quarterback, will take over.\nMettenberger was the Titans' presumptive starter until Tennessee drafted Mariota in April with the second overall pick of the NFL Draft.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T16:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T03:20:43.792+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
