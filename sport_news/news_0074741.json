The figures suggested that no one candidate won an absolute majority in the district, thus making a four-way runoff imminent.\nHowever, tallies of ballots finalised late on Monday showed that Ali garnered more than the 50 percent necessary to make it to parliament without a runoff.\nThe constituency has been described as the \"celebrity constituency\" due to competition between four well-known public figures.\nAli is a controversial TV host known for his anti- 25-January Revolution stances. Mansour is the son of the Zamalek Club chairman and sits on the board, El-Shobaki is a renowned liberal political scientist who sat in the 2011 parliament and Gohar is a former-NDP MP who had occupied the Dokki and Agouza seat for 20 years.\nThe run-off will take place on 27 and 28 October.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T04:28:28.844+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
