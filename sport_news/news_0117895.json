Closer Roberto Osuna was perfect in the ninth. \nToronto’s sharp pitching held Cain hitless, snapping his team record 13-game hitting streak in the postseason. \nYordano Ventura will start for the defending AL champions on Friday in Game 6 against Toronto left-hander David Price, the Game 2 loser. \n“We’re excited to go home,” Royals pitcher Danny Duffy said. “We wish we could have got it done today but we didn’t.” \nHosmer echoed Duffy’s upbeat vibes. \n“Nothing but positivity,” Hosmer said. “We’ve got a 3-2 lead and we’re heading back to Kansas City. That’s where we play our best baseball so everyone is still feeling pretty good.” \nToronto is trying to become just the 13th team of 80 that trailed 3-1 in best-of-seven postseason series to rally and win. It has happened four of 17 times in the LCS, including when the Royals bounced back against the Blue Jays in 1985 en route to Kansas City’s only World Series title. \nIn this year’s best-of-five Division Series, Toronto lost the first two games before winning three straight against Texas. \n“They didn’t let anything slide by today,” Royals third baseman Mike Moustakas said. “They earned that W.” \nTroy Tulowitzki broke the game open with a three-run double off Kelvin Herrera in the sixth, giving him seven RBIs in the series. Edwin Encarnacion had walked with the bases loaded against Edinson Volquez, who seemed flustered by close calls that didn’t go his way. \nEstrada, a 32-year-old right-hander, enabled his bullpen to rest, a day after Kansas City romped 14-2 in a game that saw infielder Cliff Pennington pitch in the the ninth. \nRoyals shortstop Alcides Escobar said Estrada did “a tremendous job” against the Royals \n“He was really good,” Escobar said. “He threw the ball down, down and away, down and in. He didn’t miss many pitches.” \nBefore 49,325 roaring fans at Rogers Centre, Chris Colabello’s solo homer into the left-field seats in the second gave Estrada a lead. \nEstrada didn’t make a miscue until Salvador Perez homered with two outs in the eighth. Estrada retired his first nine batters, ending at four Escobar’s record streak of leading off playoff games with hits. \nEscobar, who entered 9 for 15 (.600), collected Kansas City’s first hit when he opened the fourth with a groundball single past a diving Tulowitzki at shortstop. Ben Zobrist promptly grounded into a double play. \nKansas City had no other runners until Cain walked with two outs in the seventh. Price got up in the bullpen after that free pass, but Estrada got Hosmer to fly out. \nVolquez, who won Game 1, allowed just two singles after Colabello connected but lost the strike zone in the sixth. \n“I lost my rhythm a little bit,” Volquez said. \nBen Revere led off with a walk and Volquez hit Josh Donaldson with the first pitch. In August, Volquez hit Donaldson in a testy game that included a benches-clearing scrum. \nVolquez then walked Jose Bautista in a 10-pitch at-bat on a pitch that looked to get a piece of the plate. \n“I thought the pitch to Bautista was definitely a strike,” Royals manager Ned Yost said. \nEscobar threw up his hands at plate umpire Dan Iassogna’s call on Bautista. \n“For me, from shortstop, that’s a strike,” Escobar said. “I don’t know if right behind home plate they see it different but from shortstop it looked like a strike.” \nEncarnacion walked on another pitch that upset Volquez and Yost. Volquez turned his back to Iassogna as Revere jogged home for a 2-0 lead. It was his last batter. \n“They didn’t hit me very hard today,” Volquez said. “I got into trouble myself walking a couple of guys.” \nHerrera relieved and struck out Colabello. With the crowd chanting “Tu-lo! Tu-lo!” Tulowitzki cleared the bases with a double off the wall in center, sending fans into a towel-waving frenzy. \nBautista and Donaldson had consecutive doubles off Duffy in the seventh to make it 6-0, and Kevin Pillar doubled home a run in the eighth.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T06:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T08:08:28.321+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
