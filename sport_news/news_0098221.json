I'm the head coach. It's time for me to get out of the way.\" \nOver and over, as Spurrier crept closer to a 70th birthday that would ultimately serve as the threshold for his effectiveness at South Carolina, he kept repeating this promise: The moment things started going bad, he would simply walk away. When any coach starts losing, Spurrier would say over, everybody knows you've got to let someone else give it a try. \nAnd damned if he didn't live up to it. \nCriticize Spurrier if you wish for abandoning the Gamecocks in the middle of a going-nowhere season , leaving his players and assistants to lose more games while he plays golf and bathes on Florida's Crescent Beach. \nBut say this for Spurrier: It's better than the alternative that so many feared. \nSpurrier, unlike too many of his contemporaries, didn't need to be told when it was time to go. He didn't need to be cajoled into retirement or bargained with or placated with some phony exit strategy to keep the veneer of power. There was no need to assemble boosters behind him and wage internal warfare against an administration that recognized the need for change. \nSpurrier knew, and then he walked, saving his dignity and a world of drama for athletics director Ray Tanner to manage. Steve Spurrier's 15 greatest trash-talking quotes \n\"Yesterday, I was sort of a recruiting liability,\" Spurrier said. \"I was the best coach for this job 11 years ago, but I'm not today.\" \nIn the end, it really wasn't that complicated and leave it to college football's ultimate straight shooter to get right to the point. When South Carolina lost to Kentucky and then badly at Georgia, Spurrier saw all the signs that it was coming to an end. When the Gamecocks struggled to beat Central Florida on Sept. 26, he realized he would not make it through the season. \nAnd no, Spurrier didn't want the losses and he didn't want the questions that would come with hanging on for games against Tennessee, Florida and Clemson. If that's shirking responsibility, so be it. The 14 greatest GIFs of Steve Spurrier's career \nBut Spurrier had already played his final card before the season when he talked about his longevity at SEC Media Days and his belief that South Carolina, coming off a 7-6 season, was close to contending in the division again. Then, when more questions came about how long he wanted to coach and speculation he almost called it quits in 2014, he came back and angrily delivered the message that he would be coaching at South Carolina for years to come. \n\"Now that we're 7-6, some of our enemies want to make you think Spurrier's gettin' old, can't do it anymore,\" he said at an impromptu news conference in late July. \"Some people are gonna try to convince you that our 7-6 isn't as good as some other schools' 7-6.\" \nAs it turned out, Spurrier can't do it anymore, and it was becoming more obvious every week. No matter how may doctors reports he could trot out about his good health, a 70-year old Spurrier wasn't going to convince top-level players and their families that he would be there for four or five more years. Follow the road to the 2015 College Football Playoff at The Football Four , our home to rate and debate the nation's best. \nThough that isn't guaranteed for anyone in this notoriously unstable business, there comes a point where it is impossible to overcome. That moment came for Spurrier last season when South Carolina didn't live up to expectations and recruits, fearful that he would retire, began to bail. \nThere were no more Jadeveon Clowneys or Marcus Lattimores on which to bank the future, and a coach who had chastised others like Bobby Bowden for hanging around too long wasn't going to let the same thing happen to him. \n\"When something is inevitable, I believe you do it right then,\" Spurrier said. \nOf course it was temping to hold onto those visions of going out on top, of leading South Carolina to that elusive SEC title and being carried out on the Georgia Dome on the shoulderpads of his players. But Spurrier's entire life has been a storybook, from the Heisman Trophy to winning an ACC title at Duke to the dominant run at Florida to his seemingly perfect marriage to his improbable second act at South Carolina. It's OK for the final chapter to end so abruptly and imperfectly. \n\"Nothing goes on forever,\" he said. \"I've gone on a lot longer than most people.\" \nAnd then he was done, finished with questions and reflections and ready to get in another workout or go hit golf balls or whatever the now Former Head Ball Coach, as he rebranded himself Tuesday, wanted to do. \n\"Let's get moving,\" he said. \"I've had enough here.\" \nEnough, indeed.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T00:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T08:15:14.270+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
