We know it can be frustrating when you've trained so hard for a race that isn't going to happen.\"\nThe DRC has slashed the DRC Half Marathon registration fee to $50 for the 40 th DRC Half. It's a $35 discount from the current registration fee.\n\"This is a substantial discount over current registration costs and allows you the chance to put all those Saturday long runs and Tuesday tempo runs to the test on one of the best courses in Dallas,\" Johnson said.\nInterested runners should send an e-mail with proof of their Dallas Michelob Ultra 13.1 registration (race confirmation or a race bib photo) to: DRCMU13.1@gmail.com . Upon receiving the e-mail, the DRC will send a discount code to use that will allow the discounted entry.\nOn Twitter:\n @DFWRunning", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/DFWRunning"], "published": "2015-10-24T21:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T03:12:38.859+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
