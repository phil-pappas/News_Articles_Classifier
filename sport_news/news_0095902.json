Every team has some key words or some culture that they want to build. And we kind of talk about that each day, how that relates on the court and off the court.\" \nMidlick returns to Austin Peay after stints as assistant coach at Memphis, Tennessee State and two different tenures at APSU, one as a men's assistant coach. \nThe exact phrasing may still be in flux, but Midlick's squad has a clear focus on the identity of the program, as well as a tactic to fix one of last season's weak points. \n\"We want to have an identity of defense. We want to improve on that. Last year, the team when they struggled in the conference, it was the other team just shot a good percentage against us,\" the Memphis native said. \"And we've got to make defense a priority where they take pride in that, Our team takes pride in making stops and making it difficult on the other team to score.\" \n\"That's really what we are trying to find out about ourselves — how do we really put ourselves in a position defensively to do well. \" \nOutside of Midlick's defensive-driven plans, he will have one of the top Ohio Valley Conference players on his teamm Tiasha Gray, to help handle the offensive side of things. \n\"It's good to have a player that you can put the ball in her hands, that you know you can get a shot out of, when you need to. Or the shot clock's winding down or tough defense. She has a well-deserved honor to be first-team all-conference and by the media the preseason player of the year.\" \nGray will have help from post Tearra Banks, Brianne Alexander and Madison Rich to help carry out the transition-heavy plan Midlick is implementing to better fit with the increase game-pace set by the new clock-shot changes. \n\"We are going to push the basketball down the floor. That doesn't mean we are going to take crazy shots,\" Midlick said. \"We'll have an identity of when each player can shoot and when she should shoot it, but we want to push the ball. When you have a 30-second shot clock, you don't have a whole lot of time to walk the ball down; the clock is ticking.\" \nNow if these changes will result in a repeat visit to the OVC tournament Midlick isn't sure, but he and his players have decided to control what they can to create the type of season they want to achieve. \n\"We've talked quite a bit with them about that — they can have the year they want to have effort- and attitude-wise, and we'll let it fall where it does on the court.\" \nReach Autumn Allison at aallison@theleafchronicle.com or (931) 245-0248.
