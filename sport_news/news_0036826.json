After spotting the Rams seven points, Tanner Schminke tied the game with an 11-yard touchdown run. In the second quarter, Brodey Woodruff recovered a Toreador fumble in the end zone, but Boone trailed by two scores at the half. Schminke hit Johnathan Herrick with a 5-yard t-d toss in the third quarter, then Schminke intercepted a Rams’ pass on defense and on the ensuing drive ran it in from the 22-yard line. Schminke and Herrick hooked up for two more touchdowns, of 26 and 25 yards, in the fourth period, but it was not enough as Greene County held on for a 49 – 42 victory.
