Rahane and Binny were seen slogging it out at India's practice session ahead of the dead rubber at Eden Gardens . \nThough it's difficult to infer the the team composition from the batting order at Eden Gardens nets, it was however striking to see Binny starting the proceedings at the practice session alongside Suresh Raina. Stuar Binny and Ajinkya Rahane. \nThe all-rounder also slogged it out while bowling his medium pacers to the Indian batsmen, hinting that skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni may be contemplating the option to bring him in to bolster the batting down the order. \nPreview: 3rd T20I: India Vs South Africa in Kolkata \nAfter facing flak for ignoring Rahane, Dhoni it seems may also give a chance to the specialist T20 batsman in place of Ambati Rayudu, who has failed in both the matches, getting out for ducks. \n\"Rahane is a quality player and there is no doubt about it. All depends on the team management as to what they feel will be the best team combination to win the game and going forward. Let's see what they decide,\" Harbhajan Singh said. \nBringing the Rajasthan Royals opener at No 1 is an option but in that case, will Dhoni risk to rest Rohit Sharma at a venue where he had scored the ODI record 264 will be interesting to see. \nShikhar Dhawan in any case is yet to convert his starts and was run-out in Dharamsala as the left-hander will look forward to get back among the runs before the ODIs begins. \nExperts are also of the view that leg spinner Amit Mishra should be given a chance in place of Axar Patel. \nHaving sealed the series 2-0 after their six-wicket win in Cuttack, South Africa will be eyeing a clean sweep as India will look to play for pride in the final match of the shortest edition. Five-match ODI series beginning in Kanpur on October 11 and four Tests follow the T20Is. \nOneIndia News \n(With inputs from agencies) Read more about: Other articles published on Oct 8, 2015 Please Wait while comments are loading...", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T10:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T11:49:32.260+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
