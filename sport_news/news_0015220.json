Member Center: Arkansas holds on to defeat Auburn 54-46 in 4OT Posted: Get breaking news alerts sent to your phone with the WSFA 12 News app. Here's how. FAYETTEVILLE, AR (WSFA) - \nIt took the Arkansas Razorbacks four overtime periods to defeat the Auburn Tigers 54-46 in Fayetteville, Arkansas on Saturday. \nOne of the biggest problems that plagued the Tigers was dropped passes by receivers. Auburn receivers dropped eight passes over the course of the game, with four of those drops coming from Ricardo Louis, who has been the Tigers' leading receiver in recent weeks. \nArkansas jumped out to a quick 14-0 lead as the Auburn offense struggled to get anything going. In the first half, Auburn quarterback Sean White completed just six passes on 12 attempts, but those six incompletions came on six drops by Auburn wide receivers. Three of those drops came from Ricardo Louis. \nIn the second quarter, the Tigers got a big break when Kris Frost picked off Arkansas quarterback Brandon Allen at the Auburn 4-yard-line. That interception led to a 96-yard touchdown drive that put the Tigers on the board and made the score 14-7 right before the half. \nThe Tigers quickly tied the game up at 14-14 in the third quarter when Jason Smith ran the ball in from nine yards out. \nThe Razorbacks would retake the lead later in the third quarter on a 7-yard run from running back Alex Collins to make it 21-14, but Auburn would be quick to tie it back up after Montgomery native Jeremy Johnson punched it in from the 1-yard-line to make it 21-21. \nArkansas retook the lead with a 25-yard field goal with 1:07 left in the game to make it 24-21. It looked like that would be the game winning score, but Auburn drove down the field and sent the game to overtime as kicker Daniel Carlson nailed a 41-yard field goal with :04 left in the game to tie the game 24-24. \nThe Tigers and Razorbacks exchanged scores in the first three overtimes, with two of the Razorbacks' scores coming on fourth down. In the fourth overtime, Arkansas scored on their first play and converted on the two-point conversion to take a 54-46 lead. Auburn had their chance to tie the game, but fell short on 4th down to seal the win for the Razorbacks. \nAuburn quarterback Sean White finished the day with 19 completions on 32 attempts for 254 yards. \nPeyton Barber had another great day for the Tigers, racking up 120 yards and four touchdowns on 37 carries. \nCopyright 2015 WSFA12 News .
