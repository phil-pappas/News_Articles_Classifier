He had surgery Sept. 2.\nThomas caught 108 passes and 24 touchdowns the last two years in Denver. He signed a five-year, $46 million contract with Jacksonville in free agency in March.\nThe Jaguars (1-3) expect Thomas, when fully healthy, to be a significant part of the passing game. They need a proven playmaker to help take some pressure off second-year receivers Allen Robinson and Allen Hurns.\n___\nAP NFL websites: http://pro32.ap.org and http://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n ", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/AP_NFL"], "published": "2015-10-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T17:33:08.762+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
