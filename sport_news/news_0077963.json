(Trent Nelson | The Salt Lake Tribune) Brigham Young Cougars running back Algernon Brown (24) scores a touchdown as BYU hosts East Carolina, college football at LaVell Edwards Stadium in Provo, Saturday October 10, 2015. Junior rushes for 134 yards and scores four touchdowns. Share This Article ARTICLE PHOTO GALLERY (1) Provo • BYU's plight against Eastern Carolina looked perilous. On Saturday night at Lavell Edwards Stadium, the Cougars trailed by two touchdowns midway through the first quarter. They faced fourth-and-one from their own 34-yard line. Coach Bronco Mendehall shouldered an obvious dilemma. He could punt, give the ball back to the Pirates and look at the possibility of falling behind by three scores, or he could get the ball the 235-pound battering ram Algie Brown and attempt to maintain possession. Mendenhall picked the Brown Option and the junior running back from Salt Lake's Skyline High School delivered. After taking a handoff from quarterback Tanner Mangum, Brown was initially stopped at the line of scrimmage by a wave of East Carolina defenders. But he spun free and lunged for the first down.
