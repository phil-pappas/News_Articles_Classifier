Because of that, Wells Fargo is cutting nearly 500 jobs nationwide. \nA Wells Fargo spokesperson tells KELOLAND Nws the cuts are having a minimal impact on Sioux Falls. She says four team members will lose their jobs at the end of the year. They have been given 60 days notice. \nWells Fargo says as the economy continues to improve, there are fewer delinquency and foreclosure rates and many borrowers facing those difficulties have taken advantage of loan modification programs. While interest rates remain low, the demand for refinancing has dropped off. \nThe majority of the jobs cut are in the Carolinas and Delaware.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T20:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T19:21:00.921+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
