As a result, his trick-or-treat bag will be looking pretty bare.\n\"This year it won't matter so much. He's still young.

But this year families in Chicago and beyond are reaching out to kids who can't eat peanuts, milk or other common allergens by putting a teal-colored pumpkin on their front porches as a signal that they are handing out treats that...\n(Chicago Tribune staff) So, Gerardot and other local moms are banding together to make Halloween a holiday all kids can enjoy.\nGerardot will be making a trip to the dollar store to get glow sticks, bubbles and crayons to give away in addition to candy.\nGeneva mother Stacey Lueck will also make a trip for temporary tattoos an other non-food treats, she said.\nAlthough her boys, ages 2 and 4, don't suffer from allergies themselves, Lueck said she knows plenty of kids who do.\n\"I'm sure it's hard enough to be a kid and not be able to eat what all of your friends are eating,\" Lueck said. \"I couldn't imagine having to sit out on a holiday. (The teal pumpkin) is a simple way to include everyone and keep everyone safe.\"\nAccording to the Teal Pumpkin Project campaign, more than 100,000 homes have pledged to offer non-food treats this Halloween. There is also a map on the project's website, www.foodallergy.org , which maps out participating homes.\nLueck said her goal is to get her pumpkin out early enough so that parents of children with allergies can plan a visit.\n\"While I'm not sure the movement is super well-known, I do think that parents who have kids with allergies will see and recognize a teal pumpkin,\" she said.\nThe holiday could also cause problems for Aurora mother Kim Trujillo, whose 4-year-old daughter was diagnosed with epilepsy last year.\nRoles adapt, but room parents still host parties, assist teachers Jane Michaels Even if you like to throw parties, entertaining two dozen 7-year-olds for at least a half hour without Chuck E.

But with working mothers and food...\n(Jane Michaels) Trujillo is still learning the ropes of what can and can't trigger her daughter's seizures, so Halloween can be a scary time, she said. Despite that, this mom's making sure her little one gets the most out of the evening.\n\"Halloween is fun. I think taking away the strobe lights is taking away from the fun of Halloween,\" she said. \"It's scary to have a child with medical problems, but we will avoid those houses (with lights).\"\nOswego mother Heather Szymczak already knows how her 12-year-old will react to the Halloween fanfare. Things as common as police car, tow truck and construction vehicle lights can set her off.\n\"I can say that as a parent of a child with seizures, the strobe lights bother my daughter and we try to avoid those homes,\" Szymczak said. \"Unfortunately, this year a neighbor has decided to light up his display already at night.\"\nFor Szymczak, it marks a month of possible seizure-ridden agony.\nSzymczak wishes that he and other homeowners might take her daughter and others like her into consideration when decorating this month.\n\"Each child has a different trigger,\" she said.\nGerardot said by doing just a little bit, residents can make Halloween happier for all. Turn off the strobe lights, she said. Spend a few extra dollars on non-food treats.\n\"You're not buying every single kid a toy,\" she said. \"The majority of kids don't have a whole host of allergies. I'm going to have both options, and I'm hoping by reading this more families will participate.\"\newurst@tribpub.com\nCopyright Â© 2015, Aurora Beacon-News Halloween", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-5616d044/turbine/ct-dlg-room-parents-tl-1015-20151008", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-561aa5f5/turbine/ct-abn-teal-pumpkin-st-1013-20151011", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-54412959/turbine/ct-teal-pumpkin-project-met-20141017"], "published": "2015-10-11T17:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T00:26:42.055+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
