We didn’t start well, but we did a lot of things that we worked on (Friday) in practice that showed up in the game (Saturday). We’ve got to be happy with that, although we’re disappointed we couldn’t close it out. We have to learn to do that as a team, but it was a big improvement from what we saw in Edmonton (Thursday).”\nThe loss dropped the Oilers to 6-1-1 in the preseason. They open the regular season Thursday, on the road, against the St. Louis Blues.\nSluggish start\nThe Oilers were sluggish to start the game, perhaps due to having flown into Vancouver a few hours before the contest as is the custom in the preseason.\nThe Canuck opened the scoring four minutes in on their second shot of the game.\nSven Baertschi, who collected four assists in the Canucks’ 5-2 win Thursday, feathered a pass from the boards to Bo Horvat in front. Horvat was able to redirect the pass by goaltender Cam Talbot.\nThe Oilers didn’t generate much in the way of offence and were limited to five shots in the first period.\n“You get in (that day), it’s obviously different than coming in from the hotel,” said Oilers centre Ryan Nugent-Hopkins.\n“It’s just the way it is in preseason, but you have to find a way to get yourself going right away.\n“I thought at the very start of the game, they took it to us, but for the most part, even in the first period, we played smart, we played a hard game and we got some good bounces.”\nThe Oilers were better in the second and were the stronger team the rest of the way as they took the play to Vancouver. They were, however, unable to beat Canucks goaltender Ryan Miller, who turned away all 14 shots he faced in the middle frame and finished the night with 25 saves.\nMiller’s best save was made on Benoit Pouliot, who was able to take a pass and split Canucks defencemen Matt Bartkowski and Luca Sbisa on his way to the net. Miller denied Pouliot, sprawling out to get a pad on a backhand attempt.\n“It was a big step from our last game, that’s for sure,” Pouliot said.\n“Todd had a lot of positive things to say to us between periods and it got us going a little bit more.\n“We did the job, it’s unfortunate we didn’t finish it off in the right way, but if we can play this way every game and be more consistent and have some confidence with the puck, we’ll be fine.”\nNugent to Hopkins\nThe Oilers tied the game in the third period on a great individual play by Nugent-Hopkins, breaking in on the right wing.\nNugent-Hopkins banked the puck off the boards past defenceman Ben Hutton, retrieved it, then slid it across to Pouliot for the tap-in.\nNugent-Hopkins gave the Oilers the lead with under three minutes to go in the game converting a pass from Teddy Purcell on a two-on-one rush.\nThe lead lasted 45 seconds as a shot from Alexander Edler slipped through Talbot, allowing Yannick Hansen to poke it in, sending the game to overtime.\nThe Sedins broke out on a two-on-one rush early into the extra frame and put the game away.\n“It’s definitely back and fourth (in overtime),” said Nugent-Hopkins. “They make a stop and they go back three-on-two or two-on-one.\n“You have to be quick to react. You can’t be out there watching it all. With the Sedins, they’re going to take advantage of that, obviously, they can find each other all over.”\nGame Review\nCanucks 3, Oilers 2 (OT)\nThree Stars\n1. Ryan Miller, Canucks\nWas the reason his team didn't get run out of the building.\n2. Benoit Pouliot, Oilers\nHad one of his best games of the preseason and finished with a goal and assist.\n3. Ryan Nugent-Hopkins, Oilers\nSet up the tying goal in the third period with a great individual play then scored later in the frame.\nGame Grades\nOffence C\nDefence C\nGoaltending B\nPower play D\nPenalty kill -\nToughness C\nEffort C\nThe why\n: They shook off the plane legs in the first period and put in a much better effort than the Canucks through the next two periods but fell to the Sedin brothers in overtime.\nPlay of the game:\nRyan Nugent-Hopkins gets the puck down the wing and banks it off the boards past defenceman Ben Hutton. Nugent-Hopkins collects the puck and sends it across to Benoit Pouliot for the simple tap-in.\nBig save:\nCam Talbot made arguably his best save of the preseason in the second period, turning aside Brandon Sutter on a breakaway by throwing out a right pad.\nUp Next\nOilers at St. Louis Blues, Thursday (6 p.m.) Scottrade Center.\nEdmonton Oilers lose 3-2 in OT to Vancouver Canucks\nFirst posted: Sunday, October 04, 2015 12:32 AM EDT | Updated: Sunday, October 04, 2015 12:46 AM EDT\nVANCOUVER — It may have taken a period, but the message in regards to playing harder was received by the Edmonton Oilers.\nUnfortunately for them, Daniel and Henrik Sedin are deadly in three-on-three overtime.\nThe Oilers were the better team through two periods but fell 3-2 in overtime as Daniel Sedin scored on a set up from brother Henrik, 29 seconds into the extra frame.\nRegardless, it was the type of effort head coach Todd McLellan demands from his team on a nightly basis this season.
