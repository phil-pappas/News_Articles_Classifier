On almost every restart, Logano jumped to a sizable lead and held it throughout each green-flag run. \nKevin Harvick, Martin Truex Jr., Denny Hamlin, and Kurt Busch rounded out the top 5. All four are currently in the Chase. \nThree other drivers in the Chase finished in the top ten. Carl Edwards finished sixth. Jeff Gordon and Brad Keslowski finished eighth and ninth respectively. \nThe next highest Chase finisher was winless Ryan Newman, who finished in 15th place. Last year, Newman was quietly the only driver in the final round Chase without a win. \nThe other three Chase drivers had rough days at Charlotte. \nKyle Busch finished one lap down in 20th place. He was running in second behind Logano for much of the race, but Busch collided with Kyle Larson in one of the strangest moments of the race. \nDuring a caution, Busch seemed to want to go into the pits, but then pulled up to either fake out his opponents or wait a little longer before pitting. \nSimultaneously, Larson tried to pull into pit road late, causing a collision between the two drivers. The collision put significant damage on Busch’s car from which he was not able to recover. \nDale Earnhardt Jr. finished in 28th. Earnhardt made contact with Carl Edwards early in the race, putting him a lap down. \nEarnhardt rallied back onto the lead lap, but later slipped on oil on lap 180 that sent Earnhardt’s car sliding up the track. Earnhardt hit the wall again, this time with much more damage. He finished four laps down. \nMatt Kenseth had the most disastrous day of all the Chase drivers. Despite qualifying on the pole and leading 73 laps early, Kenseth was plagued with problems throughout the race. \nHis issues culminated on lap 204, when Kenseth hit the wall for a second time. Kenseth needed several repairs, and fell multiple laps down. He made contact with the wall again 40 laps later, knocking Kenseth out of the race. He finished in 42nd place. \nKenseth, and possibly Earnhardt, will need a win at one of the next two races at Kansas and Talladega to advance in the Chase. \nNext week, NASCAR heads to Kansas Speedway for the Hollywood Casino 400. The race is scheduled for Sunday, October 18 at 1:31 p.m. CST. WSFA 12 News will broadcast the race. \nCopyright 2015 WSFA 12 News . All rights reserved.
