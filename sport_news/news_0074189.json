Arsenal are definitely better than zero points from two games.\"\nLahm described Mueller as \"cold as dogs' noses\" in his finishing for the winning goal in Bremen, while the 26-year-old forward said their records will count for little against a Gunners' side desperate for Champions League points.\n\"The records won't do anything for us in our next few games, but it's something which has never happened in Bundesliga history, so it's fascinating,\" said Mueller.\nWith a seven-point lead at the top of the Bundesliga table already, Bayern are on course to become the first side to win four straight Bundesliga titles.\nMeanwhile, in keeping his 137th clean sheet in the Bundesliga, Germany goalkeeper Manuel Neuer matched the impressive haul of Bayern's legendary shot-stopper Sepp Maier.\n\"In London, we'll need to give everything to win,\" said the 29-year-old Neuer.\nArsenal are fresh from beating Watford 3-0 away on Saturday in the Premier League thanks to three second-half goals.\nGuardiola was missing his main wingers in Bremen with France Under-21 star Kingsley Coman nursing a thigh strain and Douglas Costa rested, while Arjen Robben and Franck Ribery are not yet ready after lengthy lay-offs.\n\"We've won a tough game at Bremen, who defended very deep,\" said Guardiola.\n\"It wasn't easy to find gaps, especially since we had no wingers,\" added Guardiola who hopes to have Costa, Coman and Robben available for the game in London.\n(For more sports news and updates, follow Ahram Online Sports on Twitter at @AO_Sports and on Facebook at AhramOnlineSports .)", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/AO_Sports", "https://www.facebook.com/AhramOnlineSports?fref=ts"], "published": "2015-10-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T08:22:48.104+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
