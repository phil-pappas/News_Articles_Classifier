Most of them did not live in the units that were slated for demolition.\nThe IDF did not deny the allegations, but responded stating it \"does everything in its ability in order to reduce the damage from the demolition point on the surrounding structures and property. Every action of this kind involves a preliminary tour [of the site], a review of the impact and the involvement of an engineer.\"\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T16:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T08:47:26.856+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
