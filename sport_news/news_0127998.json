Fayetteville has a lone doubles team in the semifinals. \nThe semifinals will start at 10 a.m. today, with the finals scheduled for around 1 p.m. at Memorial Park. \nRogers stayed in the hunt when 7A-West Conference singles champion Michael Zheng won a hard-fought 6-7, 7-6, 6-2 quarterfinals match against LeDarrien Ledbetter of Little Rock Central. The Rogers doubles team of Adam Breach and Moss Matthews also advanced to the semifinals after a pair of wins Monday. \n\"That was a big win by Michael, it still keeps us alive for a state championship,\" said Rogers coach Mike Harper. \"It was good for Michael to fight through that and come back and win that match. It is going to be wide open, there are four teams that can win it. \n\"All we can do is control what we can control. The doubles team needs to win their first match, and Michael needs to win. Then we will go from there.\" \nBentonville's Sriker Chikkala rallied to defeat Rogers' Jack Vaughan 3-6, 6-3, 6-1 in another quarterfinals singles match. The Bentonville doubles team of Ryan Hargrove and Jack Neal defeated Fayetteville's Marquese Hayes and Austin Gantz 6-4, 6-4 in the quarterfinals to advance. \n\"Sriker getting those two points for us was big,\" said Bentonville coach Nick Nersesian. \"The doubles boys came through and pulled it out. I think they will refocus and look out there and see what it will take.\" \nThe Little Rock Catholic doubles team of Henry Nolan and Stephen Weeks will face Hargrove/Neal in one semifinal while Breach/Matthews will play Fayetteville's Hans Corbell and Cannon Kern in the other semifinal match. \nChikkala will face Parker Stearns of Little Rock Catholic in one singles semifinals match while Zheng will face Van Buren's Braydon Montgomery in the other semifinal match. \nSports on 10/20/2015", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T09:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T14:10:29.975+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
