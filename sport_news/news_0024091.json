(Photo: David Guralnick / Detroit News) \n2 CONNECT 7 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Detroit — The typical pregame afternoon nap or watching a little bit of Michigan State-Michigan on Saturday?\nIt’s a question Luke Glendening is going to battle with for the rest of the week.\n“I don’t think so,” Glendening said of the chances he’ll derail his pregame routine to watch the football game. “But we’ll see how close the game is.”\nThe Red Wings locker room has taken notice of the biggest football rivalry in the state.\nAnd, the resurgence of Michigan under coach Jim Harbaugh has made the game a must watch — and fueled the confidence of Wolverines such as Glendening, who has an ally in Dylan Larkin against Michigan State alums Justin Abdelkader and Drew Miller.\n“Usually I’m the only one, and (the football team isn’t) any good, so I am getting it from all angles,” Glendening said. “But this year they’re proving themselves and Larks is here to help me out.”\nMichigan’s three consecutive shutout victories have energized maize and blue fans everywhere.\nAbdelkader has even noticed a little different demeanor from Glendening leading into this year’s game.\n“Glennie already came to me, he didn’t propose any bet, but it’s first time he’s come to me this early,” Abdelkader said. “Usually he waits until the final minute and says ‘We don’t need to bet anything because we’re not going to win.’\n“But he seems pretty confident this year.”\nAnd the bet?\nThe details haven’t been worked out — except for one part.\nAnd it’s difficult to fathom.\n“(Wearing) the shirt of the other team the next practice day,” Glendening said. “So I’m hoping to see Millsie and Abby in maize and blue.”\nIn the eyes of Michigan fans, a Michigan State loss would mean its return to “Little Brother” status.\n“You hope it turns into that,” Glendening said.\nted.kulfan@detroitnews.com \ntwitter.com/tkulfan", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T20:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T01:46:11.565+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
