It wasn't their fault EJ Manuel was giving away touchdowns like a clown gives away balloons at the county fair. The defense had trouble on three drives, and the result was two touchdowns, one in the second quarter before Manuel started playing giveaway, and then the last drive of the game when Bortles drove Jacksonville 84 yards in seven plays to his 31-yard TD pass to Allen Hurns. And that drive may have turned out fine if not for the horrific pass interference call on Nickell Robey that helped keep it alive. The 17-play drive to start the second half looked bad, but the defense stood up at the goal line and kept Jacksonville off the scoreboard there. It looked like the guys on defense were more comfortable with the game plan, and moving forward, this is how Ryan should play defense. Thirty-four points looks terrible, but really, only 14 were solely the responsibility of the defense. Manuel implosion kills Bills in London \n2. Will LeSean McCoy have his breakout game as a Bill? No, not really. McCoy has been hampered by a hamstring and his first season with the Bills has not been productive. He had a burst on a few carries Sunday, but he finished with just 68 yards, plus 36 more on only two receptions. The score dictated that the Bills had to get away from the run game, but where was McCoy in the pass game? That's supposed to be one of his strengths, his ability to catch the ball and make plays out in space, but that's been absent, too. For the season he has just 304 yards rushing and 123 pass receiving. Again, I get it, the injury cost him two full games and a good chunk of the Miami game, but when he has played, he hasn't been all that impressive. The Bills need more from their $40 million running back.
