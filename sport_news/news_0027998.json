I have been told that my great grandfather stowed away on a ship and went to Canada from France. He met and married a young woman who was the daughter of a French trapper who lived for a time with Cree Indians in Northwest Ontario north of Lake of the Woods. Her mother was a full-blood Cree Indian. So there isn’t much of the Canadian Cree blood in me, but there is a little, and I can feel it when I visit the Lake of the Woods area a couple of times a year. It is a spectacular multicolored wilderness in October with clean, clear blue water and woods where you could get lost forever. There isn’t a way for me to use words or photos to describe it. It almost seems to be a sacred land, a place where God stoops closest to the earth. I loved the Ozarks dearly when I was young, but it is nearly gone, the Ozarks I knew. The rivers are filled and dirty and the woodlands recede. The type of people I knew are gone, and the values and convictions they had are fading away fast. Canada’s cities, Winnipeg and Toronto being the two I have seen, are at the least, no better than cities found here. They are stuffed with far too many people and they seem to crave a life of more money, and new technology. But in the rural areas of Manitoba, Northwest Ontario, Saskatchewan and Alberta, you will find the greatest country people you have ever met, and their morals and values are much like I saw as a boy here in the Ozarks. I think if I were a young man today, I’d look at the part of Alberta just below and just east of the Rocky Mountains where the land and life is too difficult for the lazy and those looking for government handouts. The only illegal immigrants they would ever have to worry about are those people from the U.S. like me who are craving peace and neighbors who have the old-fashioned beliefs that I have. Small churches there are the only crowded places, made up of those who will work hard without the worship of money nor the screwed-up “diversity” we are seeing destroy our nation. The rural people of Canada can escape their government socialist leanings and incompetent leaders, which are as bad or worse than our government, by just going deeper into the wilderness, where the laziness of “diversity” and the heathen element of immigration which envelopes our nation doesn’t exist. You can forget who they are in that bush country of northern Manitoba or Saskatchewan. People in our country who are over fifty can sense what is coming here… it is something you just feel in your soul, seeing more of the west burn each summer and the consuming drought which is unmatched in history, only a part of natural catastrophes which are coming. In Korea and Iran, nuclear weapons are now being held for our cities, and if you pay attention to that little fat moron that heads Korea you know that in a matter of a decade or two or perhaps sooner, you will see great destructive, horrible bombs fall on our country, or perhaps brought across our border and detonated on the ground by those ‘diverse’ people who hate us. Page 2 of 2 - I know that a very small percentage of Americans have the love of solitude and peace that I have, but those who are younger and do share such feelings, should forsake all places where numbers of humans are increasing rapidly, and look at remote wild areas like those found in rural Canada. I was only a small boy when my grandfather told me that a lifeboat will only hold so many, and that someday I would see the country we loved so much destroyed by numbers of people beyond my comprehension. He added that when nature endures tremendous numbers of any species, some kind of destructiveness comes to save the lifeboat from sinking. Something is coming, and you can feel it. We have abandoned the things that made our country great. There are no more Abe Lincolns or Roosevelts in our future. I feel so fortunate to be able to live as close to the earth as I have been. If my kids and grandkids would go with me tomorrow I would be headed for Canada somewhere, never to return. That beautiful, natural wild country is a rough land to survive in, but it is a place where life has more of a purpose than the accumulation of wealth. Without computers or television, it would not be hard to get back to a real purpose for living, close to God again.
