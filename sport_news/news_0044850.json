Bynes is in his second season with the Lions and first as a starting linebacker. Despite losing that starting job with the return of DeAndre Levy, Bynes decided it was his turn to try to change the emotions of his teammates.\nEven though quarterback Matthew Stafford, linebacker Stephen Tulloch and wide receiver Calvin Johnson are among the team's most notable leaders, Ihedigbo said Bynes — who was with the Super Bowl-winning Ravens in 2012 — taking that role doesn't say anything about the other leaders who didn't speak out about the poor first half.\n\"When you have, I guess, the makings of a good team, you have the makings of a great team, it's not one single leader,\" Ihedigbo said. \"We take care of each other, and it's accountability. If someone isn't doing the right thing, you better believe someone is going to speak up. People aren't just going to sit back and let it happen.\"\nThe Lions are 0-5 and have done little right so far in 2015. Regardless of how poor the team has played, most of the players and coaches still think they have the makings of a good team.\nThe problem is the Lions aren't playing nearly as well as last season, when coach Jim Caldwell helped lead a turnaround that produced an 11-5 finish and postseason berth. Ihedigbo said Caldwell was as upset -- halftime and postgame -- as Ihedigbo has seen him.\n\"Of course, and he has a right to be,\" Ihedigbo said. \"This isn't what he's coaching. This isn't what he's all about. This is not what he's all about.\"\njkatzenstein@detroitnews.com \ntwitter.com/jkatzenstein \nDetroit Lions quarterback Matthew Stafford watches on the sidelines in the fourth quarter with offensive coordinator Joe Lombardi and head coach Jim Caldwell, after he was benched in the second half of the game against the Arizona Cardinals at Ford Field in Detroit Sunday Oct. 11, 2015.
