The senior's return to the lineup is not known at this time, but will be monitored on a week-to-week basis. \nWAYNE - Even though the Wayne Valley football team had outscored its first four opponents, 145-21, head coach Roger Kotlarz still had pause for concern. \n\"To succeed in the playoffs, teams have to be prepared to overcome adversity,\" Kotlarz said. \"That's a bit of a concern, because we really haven't faced much adversity this year.\" \nUntil now. \nHis concern vanished when his heralded quarterback, Nick Goodwin, went down with an undisclosed foot injury in the second quarter of the team's Week 5 matchup with Teaneck. That, for Kotlarz, was more than enough adversity. His Indians, though, overcame the major setback with flying colors. \nKotlarz simply turned to \"the next man up,\" Grant Ferrauilo. In barely over two quarters of play, the junior completed seven passes for 103 yards and three touchdowns, as Wayne Valley (5-0) defeated Teaneck, 44-20. \n\"Grant could start just about anywhere else in North Jersey,\" Kotlarz said. \"It just so happens that at Wayne Valley he is a year behind one of the best quarterbacks (Goodwin) in North Jersey. Grant works hard to prepare each week because he knows his opportunity could come at any moment and with little notice. I was confident that we wouldn't miss a beat.\" \nWayne Valley scored on its first four possessions of the second half. First, Ferrauilo threw a 10-yard TD toss to senior Vinny Tedesco. Next, he found senior tight end Ryan Monteyne for scoring passes of 9 and 24 yards. Senior Connor Olaya capped off the scoring onslaught with a 27-yard field goal. Ferrauilo's long ball was a 40-yard strike to senior Johnny Rikowich. \n\"I'm very pleased with the way the entire team responded to the (Goodwin) injury,\" Kotlarz said. \"When a high school team loses its leader, many times the rest of the guys just kind of look at each other and basically say 'oh my gosh - what are we supposed to do now?' That's not what happened here.\" \nFerrauilo entered the game with a 20-7 cushion. The team jumped out to an early lead with two long plays in the first quarter. \nFirst, junior Joe Scancarella returned a punt for a 66-yard touchdown. Seniors Anthony Cerciello and Olaya had key blocks on the return. Next, senior Michael Ocello returned an interception for a 54 yard score. \n\"That punt return was executed perfectly,\" Kotlarz said. \"We set up a nice wall for Joe and he took off. Ocello has some big interceptions for us this year. He's our most improved player this year.\" \nWill Kearney added a 1-yard TD run for Wayne Valley in the second quarter. The senior led the team with 60 rushing yards. The defense was led by senior Adam Lounsbery, who recorded 8 tackles. Kearney and Tedesco had 5 tackles apiece. Junior Tyler Fenske added a key sack. \nJordan Gamble had a 58-yard TD reception in the third quarter and threw a 25-yard TD pass to Corey Gordon in the fourth quarter for Teaneck. \nKotlarz wouldn't speculate on a timetable for Goodwin's return, saying only that his status is \"week to week.\" \n\"He's going to be ok,\" the coach said. \nNOTES: Wayne Valley is off to its best start since 2007, when they last reached the State Sectional final and finished 11-1. With a win over Northern Highlands on Friday night, the Indians will be assured of its first winning season since 2009.
