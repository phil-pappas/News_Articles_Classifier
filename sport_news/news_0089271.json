This years was no different, with full-blown race trucks, mini monster trucks, vintage broncos and almost as many JKs as there were people on display, there was something for everyone. \nIf you weren’t able to come out this year you missed out on a good time with great people, but that doesn’t mean you can’t still see the cool stuff that was there. We were able to walk the show and capture the cool trucks that you missed out on. Hopefully these photos will inspire you to make the trip out next year!", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T10:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T20:19:24.059+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
