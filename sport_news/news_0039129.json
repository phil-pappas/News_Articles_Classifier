The third baseman did not play more than six straight games without a day off and continues a specialized pregame workout routine to strengthen the muscles in his back.\nTo help bridge the gap while Wright was sidelined, Alderson acquired Juan Uribe and Kelly Johnson in a trade with the Braves on July 24 and both were important contributors in the second half.\nWright called it “bittersweet” to reach the playoffs in a season in which he was limited to 38 games.\n“Obviously I would have liked to have been here and played more games,” Wright said. “But you could either moan and whine about it and feel sorry for yourself, or go out there and do what you can do to get back as quickly as possible and I felt that was the option that we had and it feels good to celebrate.”\nOnly fittingly, it was Wright who took the microphone and thanked the fans on Sunday after the Mets completed the regular season with a 1-0 victory over the Nationals at Citi Field.\n“I wish we could have gotten them home-field advantage — that didn’t work out how we had planned,” Wright said. “But I think that very early on this year, I think that they understood that we had something special and the way they have turned out, the way they have supported us, I wish we could have clinched at home, to celebrate with them, but I think a lot of us felt it was necessary to salute the fans for coming out the way they did to making this such a memorable season.”\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google Whatsapp Email Filed under david wright ,  new york mets ,  nlds", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T01:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T05:34:34.171+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
