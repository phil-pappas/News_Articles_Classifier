It wasn't clear whether those involved were fans of rival teams.\nDetectives with the robbery-homicide division were interviewing witnesses and reviewing stadium surveillance footage, Hernandez said.\nA call to a Dodgers spokesman seeking comment wasn't immediately returned Monday.\nSecurity at Dodger Stadium came under national scrutiny after a 2011 attack in the parking lot on opening day left San Francisco Giants fan Bryan Stow with brain damage. Two men - Marvin Norwood and Louie Sanchez - later were imprisoned after pleading guilty.\nStow sued the Dodgers and their former owner Frank McCourt, saying they were to blame for the attack because of insufficient security and lighting. A jury faulted the team, along with Sanchez and Norwood, and awarded Stow nearly $18 million after a six-week trial in 2014.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
