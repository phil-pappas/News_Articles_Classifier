Kirksville’s John Bohon, Macon’s Nolan Bright and Putnam County’s Calvin Heidenwith are all quarterbacks who have given defensive coordinator’s fits to try and game plan around. But none of them could lead their teams to the second round of the playoffs. Only one dual-threat quarterback is leading his team to second-round play and that’s Scotland County’s Aaron Buford. “Buford is a great kid. He’s a great athlete and you couldn’t ask for a better leader,” Scotland County coach Mikel Gragg said. “He’s stepped up and took charge of this team and leading the right way.” Gragg is the first-year head coach at Scotland County and after seeing film of what he had on the team, made the switch to a spread offense. It was a complete change from previous coach Dan Burns’ Wing-T offense. He even took a budding star at the running back position and shifted him to the line. “He knew after watching film over the summer, it would fit us perfectly. We’re fast, aggressive and our offensive line is not overly big, but they can get out and pull and we’ve got some strong kids up front,” Buford said. “Our two guards, Will Pickerall and Aaron Blessing, when they pull, you can’t stop us.” That was evident in the first game of the season against Salisbury. The Scotland County offense totaled over 400 yards of offense with Buford accounting for over 200 yards by himself from the quarterback position. Even in the loss to Knox County the following week, Buford totaled over 250 yard of offense. But an elbow injury at Clark County forced Buford to the running back position, which he accepted without question. “Just like most of our team, it’s whatever it takes to win. He knows that going to tailback, that’s what we needed at the time. He made the switch and did a great job back there as well,” Gragg said. Buford would make the switch back to quarterback when Will Fromm went down for the season with a broken collarbone. All the switching may have made things difficult for Buford but he didn’t see it as a negative. As long as he’s helping his team to wins, he doesn’t care where he plays. “Going back to quarterback, I was a little nervous, not going to lie, but it’s helped our team out a lot,” Buford said. “I don’t care which position I’m playing, as long as we‘re winning.” Page 2 of 2 - Having Buford back at the quarterback position has helped Gragg open up the playbook for his offense. “He opens up our playbook up quite a bit. We’re able to get the ball on the edge and gives us a deep threat,” Gragg said. Buford has totaled over 800 yards through the air as well as over 750 yards on the ground and has 16 touchdowns for the Scotland County offense. Buford knows that he has a unique skill set at the quarterback position but he points to his offensive line being the real reason for his success. “Really, without my front five, who worked hard all year and even in the weight room over the summer, we wouldn’t be where we are right now. I know I wouldn’t be where I am right now. The front five, if they’re not blocking, I’m not going anywhere.” Buford said. ScotlandCounty will play Paris on Friday in the second round of the Class 1, District 5 playoffs.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T07:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T12:48:12.272+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
