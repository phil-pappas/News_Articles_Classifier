For a few drives in the second quarter the Tigers matched Mexico score for score. But eventually the powerful running game of Mexico took over and overpowered Kirksville, handing the Tigers a 54-14 loss on homecoming. “We are starting to see a little more improvement,” Kirksville coach Clint Iadanza said. “We saw signs of what we’re looking for in terms of improvement with our guys. We talked about it at halftime, when we get those flickers of what we want for football to be like for us. We’ve got to learn how to keep that going.” Mexico took a 26-0 lead midway through the second quarter and the Kirksville offense hadn’t put up much of a fight up until then. But a 30-yard flea flicker pass play from TJ Schilling to Joe Sollars brought the crowd and the energy back. The offense started pushing back and creating holes for the running game and Kirksville had it inside the red zone for the first time in the game. John Bohon would roll to his left and find a wide open Schilling for a 19-yard touchdown reception to cut the lead to 26-6. On the next defensive possession, Kirksville had Mexico’s Spencer Thomas stopped and nearly down behind the line of scrimmage on a third-down play, but Thomas managed to shovel the ball to Karsten Ekern, who sprinted, nearly untouched, for a 69-yard touchdown run. “I thought the kid was down but the ball just kind of shot out and the kid just runs away,” Iadanza said. “I told the kids that when you’re down, you have to make your own luck. We managed to do that in that quarter.” Kirksville’s offense would have an answer for that touchdown run. After converting on a third-and-10 and with less than 30 seconds to go in the half, Bohon scrambled to his right and launched a 25-yard pass intended for Schilling. The pass was batted away from Schilling and into the open hands of Sollars for a touchdown and Kirksville cut back into the lead, 32-14. But after that it was Mexico’s offense that wrestled the momentum back from Kirksville and never gave it up, even though it was tougher sledding than it has been for other Kirksville opponents. “Mexico has a powerhouse offense and our defense got into a little different look to gameplan against them,” Kirksville’s Tanner Sparks said. “It’s not that we didn’t execute, it’s just they were a little tougher than us tonight.” Page 2 of 2 - Mexico even attempted a few more pass plays than Kirksville had seen on film. “It’s good when you get them to throw the ball like that. It means that you’re frustrating them a little bit,” Iadanza said. Mexico would tack on 22 points from the ground game in the second half to account for the final score. Kirksville (0-7, 0-5 NCMC) will look to build upon some of its improvements it saw offensively for the final home game of the season against Trenton next week. “Trenton will run a very similar offense, which hopefully we’ll learn from the mistakes we made this week. Hopefully, we’ll get some guys back next week. We still have some guys injured and we’ll go from there,” Iadanza said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T07:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T04:25:10.194+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
