An inventor, from Dieppe, New Brunswick, Canada, thought there could be a better way, so he invented the CLEAR VISION.\nThe CLEAR VISION enables the user to see clearly during an outdoor activity. It also prevents mosquitoes and other insects from flying around the head, face and eyes. As a result, it enhances comfort and safety and it could help to make outdoor activity more enjoyable. The invention features a protective design that is ideal for outdoor enthusiasts, campers, hikers and fishermen. Additionally, the CLEAR VISION is producible in design variations and a prototype is available.\nThe inventor described his inspiration for the invention. “I came up with this idea while trout fishing. I thought there needed to be a better way to protect the face from bugs without obstructing the vision, so I invented this.”\nThe original design was submitted to the Telemarketing office of InventHelp. It is currently available for licensing or sale to manufacturers or marketers.
