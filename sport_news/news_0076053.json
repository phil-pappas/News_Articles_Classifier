Both schools are undefeated and will be looking to extend their unblemished marks with ESPN GameDay in town.\nIn preparation for the big showdown, The Deseret News caught up with Jeff Faraudo of the Bay Area News Group to get the inside scoop.\nDN: Utah has not seen a quarterback this season as good as Cal's Jared Goff. How will he fare against a Utah secondary that's recorded seven interceptions in its first four games?\nJF: Goff is very accurate and has thrown just four interceptions in 178 attempts. Given time, he will find receivers and move the ball. The bigger issue for him is whether Cal can run the ball well and pass protect well enough to let Goff thrive. The Bears struggled in the run game against Washington State last week and teams have gotten pressure on Goff. If he is given time to throw, Cal will score some points.\nDN: Conversely, Cal has not seen an offense quite like the Utes . How are the Golden Bears preparing for the well-balanced attack that hung 62 points on Oregon in Week 4?\nJF: Cal is very aware how much quarterback Travis Wilson has improved this season. The Utes don’t have him throw a lot, but he is effective as a passer and equally dangerous running the ball, as Oregon discovered. For Cal to even slow down Utah, it must continue to generate turnovers. The Bears lead the nation with 18 takeaways, but Utah may not be real cooperative. The Utes have just four turnovers in four games.\nDN: Aside from Goff, who should the Utah defense be targeting? What player on Cal's offense could potentially be an X-factor?\nJF: Goff’s favorite target is wide receiver Kenny Lawler, who is 6-foot-3 with long arms and huge hands. He gets open, but also can catch the ball in a crowd. Lawler has eight touchdown receptions already this season and 22 for his career. The Utes will be very aware of where he is at all times.\nDN: Cal head coach Sonny Dykes singled out Utah's special teams unit earlier in the week as the best group that Utah has. How will the Golden Bears keep this unit from making big plays like it seemingly does weekly?\nJF: Certainly the Bears’ punt coverage team will keep its heads up and eyes open in order to prevent a repeat of the impressive decoy punt return the Utes ran against Oregon. Utah’s punter is excellent and Cal has not returned punts particularly well this season. Likewise, the Utes’ return teams have been productive. Special teams are a significant concern for Cal.\nDN: Are the Golden Bears buying into the College GameDay hype? What does Cal have to do to get the win on Saturday?\nJF: Cal’s players are aware of the national spotlight that will be on this game and they’re embracing the opportunity to play on the big stage. But they won’t be rising early Saturday to attend the GameDay events and they understand the need to focus on what matters. To beat the Utes, the Bears will need to run the ball and create turnovers on defense to slow down the Utah offense. Without a doubt, they will have to play their best game of the season.\nTwitter: @GriffDoug", "external_links": ["http://deseretnews.sportsdirectinc.com/football/ncaaf-teams.aspx?page=/data/ncaaf/teams/team93.html"], "published": "2015-10-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T02:47:37.424+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
