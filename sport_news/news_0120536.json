Simon plays forward for Poly, while Jack is a defender and Paul plays up front for Friends. \nThe brothers' parents -- Eric and Sandi -- will find seats right smack in the middle of the stands to show their loyalties to both sides. Eric will be sporting a Poly shirt and Friends hat. \n\"The boys are really best friends,\" Eric said. \"They've played sports their whole life together -- soccer, baseball and lacrosse. It's just unbelievable that the schedule played out this way.\" \nAt 13-3, Friends is enjoying a solid season in the Maryland Interscholastic Athletic Association B Conference. And while Poly has struggled through a 2-6-1 campaign and will be the clear underdog on Wednesday, it didn't stop Simon from talking some smack. \n\"Simon has been growing a little beard lately and he and Jack have a little wager that if Friends win, Simon needs to shave it off. Simon I believe will be shaving at the end of the day,\" Eric said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T16:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T20:26:05.384+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
