Related Don't touch: Caterpillar seen around Pa. can cause rash \nBryant caught six passes for 137 yards and two second-half scores in Sunday's 25-13 win over Arizona in his first action of the season. Bryant sat out the first four games for violating the league's substance abuse policy and missed another one with a minor knee injury. Bryant says he wants to prove to the Steelers he's more than a one-dimensional threat. He thrived while working with third-string quarterback Landry Jones, who could start again in place of Ben Roethlisberger on Sunday when Pittsburgh plays at Kansas City.
