Nine others were wounded,\" an interior ministry spokesman said in a statement.\nHe said that at about 7:00 pm (1600 GMT) Friday a suspect with an automatic weapon \"started to shoot randomly\" at a Shiite hall used for commemorations in the Saihat area of Qatif city.\nPolice intervened and opened fire, killing the suspect, the spokesman said without giving details about the attacker.\n\"The situation is still under investigation,\" he said.\nState television earlier reported that the gunman was 20 years old.\nA group calling itself Islamic State-Bahrain State said in a communique that one of its \"soldiers\", Shughaa al-Dosari, \"attacked a Shiite infidel temple with an automatic weapon\" in Saihat.\nIt warned that \"infidels will not be safe in the island of Mohammed\".\nDuring Ashura last year, gunmen killed seven Shia worshippers, including children, in the eastern town of Al-Dalwa.\nThe interior ministry said the unprecedented incident had links to ISIS.\nA witness to Friday's attack, Ali al-Bahrani, told AFP that \"a gunman began randomly shooting at people attending a sermon\".\nHe said that a woman was killed.\nHussein al-Nemr, a local resident, said the shooting was one of three incidents on Friday evening.\nNemr, speaking from Saihat, said a gunman had stolen a taxi in neighbouring Dammam city, and a shooting also occurred at a mosque in Saihat but nobody was injured there.\n\"We are not sure yet if they are linked to each other,\" he told AFP, adding IS had warned of attacks.\nSince the start of Ashura commemorations, Shia security volunteers had been checking people at the entrances to houses of worship, Nemr said.\nSecurity has been tightened at Shiite facilities since May when separate suicide mosque bombings killed 25 people.\nBoth attacks were claimed by ISIS, which considers Shia to be heretics.\nMost Saudi Shia live in the oil-rich east, and many complain of marginalisation.\nThe Ashura commemorations -- which peak late next week -- mark the killing of Imam Hussein, the grandson of the Prophet Mohammed, by the army of the Caliph Yazid in 680 AD. That event lies at the heart of Islam's divide into Shia and Sunni sects.\nISIS, which has also targeted Saudi police, controls swathes of neighbouring Iraq and Syria where it has carried out widespread abuses.\nSaudi Arabia and its Sunni Gulf neighbours last year joined a United States-led military coalition that is bombing ISIS in Syria and Iraq.\nIn July, the interior ministry said it had broken up an IS-linked network and arrested more than 430 suspects involved in attacks and plots.\nEarlier Friday, Saudi Arabia's top cleric, Grand Mufti Abdulaziz al-Sheikh, named IS as an enemy of Islam.\n\"The reality is that they are shedding Muslim blood and destroying Islam. There is no good in them,\" he said during weekly prayers at the Imam Turki bin Abdullah mosque in Riyadh.\n\"They are neither an Islamic state nor mujahedeen or Islamic mercenaries. Their faith is falsehood... their reality is bloodshed and looting.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T16:57:00.361+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
