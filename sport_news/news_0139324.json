Wake Up America Ted Cruz is called the pit bull in Congress because he relentlessly sinks his teeth into battles that he is passionate about such as defunding Planned Parenthood and defeating the Iran Nuclear Deal. He has no fear in calling out fellow Congressional leaders who support the status quo over the will or well-being of the people-even if he is alone. Cruz staunchly supports the Constitution and calls out those who circumvent it, all the way to the White House. He stands strong in his Christian faith and is not shy about sharing his testimony. All-in-all a perfect candidate.\nHowever, if you look at the polls and Cruz's debate performances, you may not agree with that analysis. Wednesday the National Review asked the question many are thinking, \"Where’s Ted Cruz?\" Cruz is running at about 6 percent nationally, including key states such as Iowa and New Hampshire - well behind outsiders Donald Trump, Carly Fiorina, and Ben Carson. Because of this, the press has mostly ignored him.\nNR points out that it would be a huge mistake to underestimate Cruz. After all, back in August of 2013 he began meeting with Iowa activists to plan his path to presidential victory only nine months after he was elected to the Senate. According to some of his rival's strategists, Cruz may be one of the last men standing in this campaign.\n“He’s got a long way to go, but unlike some of these guys, he has a coherent strategy, he has a lot of money, he has a pretty consistent message, and he’s not making mistakes,” says a top Republican strategist allied with Florida senator Marco Rubio. “He’s running a good campaign.”\nCruz has a plan that goes beyond Iowa. His goal is to win the most delegates rather than to take entire states. Often rebel candidates take a number of early states, but typically don't have the financial reserves and have to rapidly raise the cash and build the big infrastructure needed to turn out voters across the country. Cruz won't have that problem.\nAccording to Politico on Wednesday, Cruz is hedging his bet on the GOP nomination fight being a grueling, drawn-out affair that could stretch all the way to the convention. To this end, he is working the most distant corners of the political map, courting Republicans in the farthest-flung U.S. territories. Cruz is doing so satisfy an obscure provision of the Republican National Committee rule No. 40 (b). It states that in order to receive the nomination, a candidate must win majorities of delegates in eight states or territories.\nAlthough other candidates are also mining the territories for delegates, it is said that no other campaign appears to have matched the aggressiveness of the Cruz campaign. The territories offer \"a lot of lower-hanging fruit,\" explained a GOP strategist supporting Cruz, meaning winning a majority of delegates in those places is a more manageable endeavor than in the mainland states.\nDon't let the gentleman senator's slow and steady approach fool you, reports The Hill . Remember the Tortoise and the Hare story. He has stolen supporters from fellow GOP candidate Rand Paul (Ky.) and has won the rousing support of evangelicals just in this past week alone.\nIt's part of Cruz's aim to go after his rivals on their home field. “Our theory has always been that you need to crush your bracket first in order to advance,” Rick Tyler, a Cruz spokesperson, said, comparing the primary slog to the annual college basketball tournament. \"We don't want to break out. ... We are moving slow and steady.\"\nThe 2016 presidential race is a process of elimination nomination, and if you are built for the war of attrition. If you are still standing one, two, four months from now, you’re in a good position.", "external_links": ["http://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/255791-ted-cruz-sees-slow-and-steady-path-to-2016-victory", "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/10/ted-cruz-2016-strategy-republicans-214212", "http://www.nationalreview.com/article/425183/ted-cruz-iowa"], "published": "2015-10-09T04:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T06:10:59.878+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
