That linchpin vote, in addition to approving $476 million in borrowing backed by the taxes, could unlock or help win state funding that would raise the total to $854 million.\nLosing the vote would imperil the city's grand plan for remaking the stock show complex into a year-round tourism, event, education and agricultural innovation center — a decade-long project that's potentially legacy-making for Mayor Michael Hancock.\nEarlier this year, Colorado legislators approved $250 million in state funding to support Colorado State University's ambitious plans to set up shop on the eventual 270-acre campus. But they made it contingent on Denver voters approving the tax extensions, ensuring there's local skin in the game.\nAdvertisement The week after the election, the Colorado Economic Development Commission on Nov. 12 is set to decide whether to award the project state Regional Tourism Act funding, as well as how much. Denver is seeking $128 million, but an analyst has suggested cutting that by more than one-third .\nKelly Leid, executive director of the city's North Denver Cornerstone Collaborative office, said commission members likely will be watching Denver's election closely.\nMeasure 2C has spurred questions but hasn't faced any organized opposition. Still, the gravity of the city tax vote has fueled a robust campaign that raised nearly $1.2 million through September, including from consultants, contractors and other interests.\nThe \"Smart Deal for Denver\" campaign carefully has framed two TV ads to emphasize that the project is about more than keeping the National Western Stock Show in town . One is hosted by Hancock on a downtown street. The other is set in an old-west saloon. Both star a big bull.\nEarly phases of the project would include major infrastructure fixes and cleanup, new street connections and bridges for surrounding neighborhoods, and revitalization of the South Platte Riverfront. That would lay the groundwork for relocated stockyards that would double as a city festival park as well as new livestock and equestrian centers, seen as key to attracting big new events.\nLater, a final unfunded phase calls for a new arena, an expo center and the retrofitting of the 1909 Stadium Arena to turn it into a market.\nThe 1.75 percent portions of the car rental and lodging taxes, which paid for the last Colorado Convention Center expansion, are set to expire in 2023. The ballot measure would permanently extend them to help fund the National Western project as well as a new convention center expansion, budgeted separately at $105 million.\nThe ballot language seeks authorization to borrow up to $778 million, including financing costs and the chance to borrow against any state RTA award.\nA handful of vocal opponents have questioned aspects of the plan, including the taxes selected. Some have asked if the city money could be spent better on other projects.\n\"The City of Denver will be spending over $1,000 on the National Western Project for every man, woman and child in the city of Denver,\" civic activist Thad Tecza wrote, including another $197 million in planned city funding — besides the tax extensions — that hasn't yet been identified.\nHis arguments were included among opposition arguments in the Elections Division's official information booklet.\nTecza and Mike Krause from the libertarian-leaning Independence Institute also question the permanent extension of the taxes, which the city intends to use to cover ongoing maintenance costs on the projects.\nExcess proceeds could go toward other tourism-related projects. Cary Kennedy, the city's chief financial officer, said any new city-issued debt would require voter approval.\nSome critics have questioned the lack of details on the remaining city funding. City officials have said that money might be raised through land and asset sales, new on-site revenue, other city funding, federal grants or private partnerships.\n\"Many projects of this size go forward with a gap,\" Kennedy said, \"and I'm fully confident that the city will be able to close that gap over a decade.\"\nIf voters approve the ballot measure, Leid says much of the next two years would be spent acquiring land surrounding the stock show site, rezoning it, preparing some parcels for construction, moving railroad tracks away from the riverfront and talking with potential private partners.\nOnly then could major projects begin to break ground, working around the schedule of the January Stock Show and Rodeo. Plans call for the formation of a public project authority to oversee the site after construction begins.\nOn Oct. 5, the city got a head start on land acquisition when the City Council approved the $6.1 million purchase of a nearly 5-acre property at 5135 Race Court. International Paper already had plans to move out of its recycling facility, Leid said, so the city seized the opportunity.\nOn the financing front, the Western Stock Show Association has pledged to raise as much as $50 million for the city's master plan. Spokeswoman Karen Woods said it has hired a firm to study fundraising options and feasibility, and then suggest a plan to the organization's board.\nJon Murray: 303-954-1405, jmurray@denverpost.com or @JonMurray", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T09:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T02:04:03.913+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
