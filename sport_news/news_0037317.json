During the past two months, the police have registered 14 FIRs against 30 persons who had procured their licences through middlemen from Nagaland 15 of whom have been arrested. What has complicated the investigations is that the middlemen have given fake addresses to the accused. Cops are conducting raids at the given addresses of middlemen, but are returning empty handed as the latter have disappeared after collecting the money. “Without arresting the local middlemen, we cannot get the exact details of touts in Nagaland. But almost all addresses given to persons who have been booked for procuring fake licence turned out to be fake during raids,” said DSP Virender Singh who is investigating the scam. During investigations it came to light that middlemen charged Rs 40,000 - Rs 80,000 from each person to issue all India arms licences which can only be done by the Ministry of Home affairs (MHA). After the case was registered, the cops started arresting the accused and seized their weapons purchased from Kanpur and ordinance Calcutta factories. So far, five weapons have been confiscated. Some accused told the police that they got the licences from Nagaland as they wanted to work as guards in MNCs in New Delhi and they were unaware about that only the MHA could issue such licence. “We are conducting raids to arrest all the accused to break the long chain of middlemen,” the DSP added.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T02:17:08.617+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
