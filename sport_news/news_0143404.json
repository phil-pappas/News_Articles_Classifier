A week ago, the Scarlet Knights beat Kansas, 27-14, to improve to 2-2. Coach Kyle Flood will be suspended for Saturday’s game, the final one he’ll have to miss as part of a three-game punishment for contacting a professor about the academic status of one of his players. Rutgers’ offensive star, receiver Leonte Carroo, is suspended indefinitely after an assault charge, making him the seventh Rutgers player arrested this season — with the others kicked off the team.\nThree things we learned about MSU on Saturday\nLJ Scott is finding his stride: The freshman running back is looking more and more like the Spartans’ best option at the position after his beastly 146-yard game against Purdue . Of course, starter Madre London wasn’t exactly a slouch with 97 yards on 17 carries. The tandem worked perfectly against the Boilermakers.\nConnor Cook can run, too: The senior quarterback threw the ball only seven times in the second half amid bad weather and behind an injury-riddled offensive line, but the Spartans kept Purdue off balance with some quarterback runs. Cook gained a career-high 48 yards, including a career-long run of 22, in setting the MSU wins record with 28 as the starter.\nThe MSU defense plugs one hole, finds another: The Spartans had some success blitzing and didn’t give up much downfield to Purdue’s passing attack. But the Boilermakers opened holes on MSU’s vaunted defensive line, and freshman Markell Jones raced 68 yards for a touchdown thanks, in part, to a gap mistake up front. He had the best rushing game vs. MSU since Nebraska’s Taylor Martinez in 2012.\nThree things to watch this week\nGetting away: MSU played its first five games in the state, the past four at home, and Saturday’s trip to Rutgers marks the start of a stretch that will be largely out of Spartan Stadium. Between now and a Nov. 14 home game against Maryland, the Spartans will have one home game. That stretch includes an off week and a trip to Michigan.\nA time to rest, maybe: Any road night game in the Big Ten has to be considered dangerous on some level, but with the Wolverines due up on Oct. 17, it’s possible the Spartans could rest some iffy players Saturday. Jack Conklin, Josiah Price, Kodi Kieler and Macgarrett Kings Jr. are among the MSU questionables to play.\nBack to the drawing board: MSU’s streak of 12 straight games with 30 points or more — a school record and the longest active streak in the nation — was snapped by Purdue. The Spartans’ passing offense disappeared in the second half, though they ran well enough to hold on. More balance and more points will be sought at Rutgers.\nContact Joe Rexrode: jrexrode@freepress.com. Follow him on Twitter @joerexrode .
