The mission took place as dense sea fog rolled in from the Gulf of Mexico.\nThe full report, obtained by The Associated Press late Thursday through a public records request, said the pilots were not authorized to fly in such bad weather and that others failed to challenge the over-confidence of the lead pilot.\nDetails of the report were reported by The Irish Times in June.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
