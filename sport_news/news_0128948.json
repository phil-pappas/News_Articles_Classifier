By Mark Lelinwalla \nJalen Rose and Chris Webber will always be attached for being the two key members of Michigan's Fab Five. \nBut the one-time brothers bonded by basketball just can't see eye-to-eye. \nThe always opinionated Rose drove that point home during an appearance on Power 105's The Breakfast Club on Thursday morning, explaining how their rift started and where their relationship stands today. \nRose said the feud initially sparked when Webber had unpleasant things to say about former Michigan booster Ed Martin , something that Jalen didn't appreciate. \nBut their relationship only got that much more strained when Webber didn't participate in ESPN's 30 for 30 documentary about the Fab Five, even though Rose alleges that his former teammate vowed to be a part of it. \n\"Even if you don't mean it, you should apologize...if that's going to help preserve the legacy,\" Rose said about Webber's wrongdoings. \"So, for him not to do that, that's a selfish act. Somebody has to call him on it and the collection of people I talk to say, 'Jalen, you got to be the one to do it, so here I am.'\" \nHe added: \"We weren't just alums and teammates...we were brothers. You don't break up with family. And that's moreso why I'm talking about it now.\" \nAs the interview continued, Rose went on to describe his brief feud with Shaquille O'Neal over words they exchanged and Rose commenting that the future Hall of Fame center is a cop, but has an \"Against The Law\" tattoo. \nRose appeared on The Breakfast Club to promote his new book, Got to Give the People What They Want: True Stories and Flagrant Opinions from Center Court. \nBET Sports News â€” Get the latest news and information about African-Americans in sports, including weekly recaps, celebrity news and photos of your favorite Black athletes.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T16:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T22:11:12.865+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
