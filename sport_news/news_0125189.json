We're going to do right by him, but today he's doing pretty darn good.\"\nKubiak added that the Broncos' schedule could factor into the decision on Ware. They have a bye week after this weekend's game at Cleveland, which would give Ware two weeks of rest if he sits.\n\"I'm just going to do what Greek (head trainer Steve Antonopulos) and the trainers tell me,\" Ware said. \"The plane ride home was real, though.\"\nTeammates have braced for the possibility that he might miss Sunday's game, but are confident in their depth at linebacker. Backups Shaquil Barrett and Shane Ray filled in during the second half at Oakland and recorded a sack apiece and combined for five tackles and two quarterback hits.\n\"We expect big things out of Shane and Shaq to be able to step up,\" cornerback Chris Harris said Monday. \"We feel like they can get the job done.\"\nNicki Jhabvala: njhabvala@denverpost.com or @NickiJhabvala", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T19:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T04:23:11.793+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
