I don’t change a word of what I said. I have two world-class goalkeepers,” a livid Wenger told reporters ahead of Arsenal’s Premier League clash with table-toppers United. \n“Do not come always back with that same story. I think you lack a bit creativity in the press, you all follow a bandwagon that is very, very, very, very boring,” . \n“It’s the easiest choice I have to make, to pick one of those two. Look, stop that story, or we stop the press conference. If you question Ospina, I question your knowledge of football. \n“Nobody analysed the numbers. It’s depressing. Yes, the goalkeeper made a mistake, but we could still have won the game,” the 65-year-old added. \nCurrently fourth in the table, Arsenal have a 24 per cent win rate against United in the league, their lowest against any team in the competition, and their hopes to improve that record have suffered a blow, with defender Laurent Koscielny ruled out of the tie. \nThe France international was forced off in the 57th minute of the match again Olympiakos with a hamstring injury. \nWenger also confirmed that midfielders Mathieu Flamini and Mikel Arteta, both of whom missed Tuesday’s game, have not recovered in time to face the Red Devils. \n“Koscielny will be out. Flamini and Arteta will also be missing,” the Frenchman said. — Reuters", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T18:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T18:50:52.129+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
