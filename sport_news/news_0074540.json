(AP) — The latest on the ZombiCon shooting in Fort Myers, Florida, on Saturday night that left a 20-year-old dead and five others wounded. (All times local): \n8:30 a.m. \nTwenty-year-old Expavious Tyrell Taylor had only been at ZombiCon in Fort Myers, Florida, for less than 45 minutes when shot rang out, killing him and wounding five others. \nHis girlfriend, 26-year-old Jasimne Gaure, told the News-Press (http://newspr.es/1Nk5Bcq ) they weren’t sure until the last minute that they’d even attend the Saturday night festival. But the offensive lineman for the ASA College football team in Miami had the weekend off and they wanted to make the most of their free time. \nShe says they were waiting in line for a drink when gunfire erupted. Everyone hit the ground for safety and when they raised their heads, Taylor was motionless, still wearing his creepy clown mask. \nGaure told the newspaper Taylor had an interest in forensic science and wanted to become a mortician. She says he was heading in “the right direction.” \n___ \n4:20 a.m. \nA shooting in downtown Fort Myers, Florida, during ZombiCon has left one person dead and five others wounded. \nSaturday’s chaotic scene sent throngs of crowd goers running through the streets. The shooting happened around 11:45 p.m., just 15 minutes before the event officially ended. Large crowds were still in the streets and authorities quickly cleared out nearby bars and set up crime scene tape, while others patrolled the area with rifles searching for a suspect. \nFort Myers Police Lt. Victor Medico says Expavious Tyrell Taylor, a 20-year-old who played football at a local junior college, died at the scene. Four others were taken to the hospital with non-life threatening injuries and one additional victim refused medical attention, authorities said. \nAuthorities said the suspect or suspects were still at large Sunday.
