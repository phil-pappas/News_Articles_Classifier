(Photo: Dale G. Young, Detroit News) \nCONNECT 1 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Ann Arbor — If Michigan State would have ended up losing on Saturday against Michigan, it wouldn't have been because of its defense.\nEven starting two true freshmen in the secondary, No. 7 Michigan State turned in its best defensive performance of the season in its 27-23 victory over No. 12 Michigan. The Spartans allowed only 230 total yards, their best outing of the season, and held the Wolverines to 62 yards on the ground, 27 coming on one carry from Michigan fullback Sione Houma.\n\"I think we played our most complete game defensively,\" junior linebacker Riley Bullough said. \"I think they hit us with a few plays that were tough and they were hiding some things. But we adjusted well, stopped the run for the most part. This was definitely our best game.\"\nEntering the game, the team that ran the ball for more yards won 42 of the last 45 games. That trend ended as Michigan State managed just 58 yards.\nDETROIT NEWS\nMSU's 'D' turns to freshmen, who deliver like veterans\nBut that was an offensive issue. Michigan State was stout on defense all day, forcing Michigan to punt seven times and allowing only 4-of-15 conversions on third down.\n\"That's just what we've been saying the past week or so, that we've got to be consistent every single play and everyone doing their job,\" Bullough said. \"Tonight we did that. That is what we've been looking for the whole season and that is why it was our most complete game defensively.\n\"Our team is resilient. We've got a lot of guys that aren't playing we thought would be in the preseason. Guys are coming in and out and we're jelling together and getting better each week. That's all we can ask for.\"\nNo disrespect \nIn the confusion of the final play of the game, Michigan State coach Mark Dantonio and Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh never came together for a handshake.\n\"No, I didn't get a chance,\" Dantonio said. \"I was down on the other end and I turned and they said coach was trying to find me, I heard. Pass my regards to Jim. I know his family and he's a good man.\"\nEarlier, Dantonio was effusive in his praise for Harbaugh and the Wolverines.\n\"Football is a crazy game and I respect the people we're playing against,\" Dantonio said. \"I very much respect the University of Michigan and what coach Harbaugh has done so far and the direction they are going. They played a great game.\"\nBust a move \nMichigan State's locker room celebrations have become a big deal over the past few years, and defensive end Shilique Calhoun said he had never seen Dantonio dance like he did after Saturday's victory.\nHowever, the Michigan State coach begged to differ.\n\"First of all, he hasn't been watching,\" Dantonio said. \"I danced at the Rose Bowl, I danced after the last two Michigan games, I danced at the Cotton Bowl and I danced at the Big Ten Championship game.\n\"So I have experience.\"\nExtra points \nDantonio improved to 7-2 (.778) during his tenure against Michigan, including a 3-1 record in Michigan Stadium. The Spartans have also now won 12 straight Big Ten road games and are 19-3 since 2010.\n\"That's something we try and do,\" Dantonio said. \"You want to play well away and it further validates who you are. You have to play well away to win a championship, you have to. We learned that over the last five years. We did not know how to do that early on, consistently, but we have been able to do that now and this is a big one.\"\n… Michigan State extended its overall winning streak to 11, tying for the fourth-longest winning streak in school history, and matching the longest under Dantonio.\n… Michigan State has won 20 of its last 21 games against Big Ten opponents, including 16 wins by double-figures.\n… MSU has won 33 of its last 36 games, and has won 31 games since the beginning of 2013.\n… Connor Cook is the second Spartan quarterback to beat Michigan three straight times, joining Kirk Cousins who won three straight from 2009-11.\nmcharboneau@detroitnews.com \ntwitter.com/mattcharboneau", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T04:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T09:31:06.780+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
