When I would ask (U of L staffer Andre McGee), 'Does Pitino know about this?' he would laugh and say, 'Rick knows about everything.'\"\nIn a press conference on Friday, Pitino denied any knowledge of the alleged activity, saying he first heard of the claims when the publishing company for Powell's book, \"Breaking Cardinal Rules: Basketball and the Escort Queen,\" reached out to U of L through Indiana University's athletics department to identify a player in one of Powell's pictures.\nA U of L spokesman, reached for comment Monday regarding Powell's claims about Pitino, referred the Courier-Journal back to Pitino's statements in Friday's press conference.\nLouisville coach Rick Pitino says he was heartbroken when he heard the allegations that a former staff memeber purchased escorts for players/recruits.\nPitino denied knowledge of the situation again Monday in an interview with ESPN .\n\"Not myself, not one player, not one trainer, not one assistant, not one person knew anything about any of this,\" Pitino told ESPN. \"If anyone did, it would have been stopped on a dime. Not one person knew anything about it.\"\nIn the book, Powell says she and other escorts — including her own teenage daughters — provided services to U of L players, recruits or their guardians 22 times over the course of four years, running up a bill north of $10,000.\nShe claims in the book that McGee, a former U of L player, graduate assistant and director of basketball operations, set all of the visits up and paid her for them.\nMcGee, now an assistant coach at the University of Missouri at Kansas City, has denied the allegations through his lawyer, Louisville-based attorney Scott Cox. McGee has been placed on administrative leave by his new school.\nTHE COURIER-JOURNAL\nU of L book leaves dots yet to be connected\nTHE COURIER-JOURNAL\nU of L hoops' accuser: 'Men wanted her body'\nPowell told the IBJ, a sister company to the book's publisher, that she's \"been up front and told the truth from the beginning.\"\n\"This story is the truth. This is what happened for four long years,\" she said. \"All I can do is tell my story and hope people understand where I’m coming from and why I told my story.\"\nPitino is mentioned in Powell's book, but her comments to the IBJ are the only time she has suggested that the coach knew.\nPitino, who has been at U of L since 2001, said he spoke to 12 former assistant coaches and several other video and support staffers who worked at U of L between 2010 and 2014, and none said they knew about Powell or her claims.\nTHE COURIER-JOURNAL\nAmid scandal, Pitino, players focus on hoops\nTHE COURIER-JOURNAL\nUK's Mitch Barnhart talks U of L allegations\n\"When this first broke a month ago, I questioned everybody, if anybody has even a little knowledge or hearsay or seen anybody, and everybody, to the person, 15 people, said they had no knowledge of anything, never seen anything,\" Pitino said Friday.\nPowell doesn't deny in the interview that her motivation for writing the book was money. She will receive a 10 percent cut of the profit from the book, which she wrote with journalist Dick Cady.\n\"Are you asking me if I just did it for money? If my biggest goal is money? If a person asked me to do it just to tell my story, I probably would have said no,\" Powell told the IBJ.\nShe said she came forward \"for survival, to put money in my pocket and food on my table.\"\n\"I can’t say it or explain it without sounding greedy,\" she said. \"I don’t know how to answer that. I do want to get away from this type of life.\"", "external_links": ["http://download.gannett.edgesuite.net/courierjournal/brightcove/29913742001/201510/2651/29913742001_4527749607001_4527615019001-vs.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/a87d80da098b28e103d4a8284662d1c37a569a70/c=584-0-2920-2336/local/-/media/Louisville/2014/05/07/barnhart.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/3faf0c4e341022d95ff4b34e5c0c7d8a44cafa4b/c=0-65-258-323/local/-/media/2015/10/03/Louisville/Louisville/635794900559720767-book-cover.jpg", "http://www.ibj.com/blogs/4-the-score/post/55160-katina-powell-this-story-is-the-truth?id=4-the-score", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/6bf3949b2eb9e9bffa6dfba96275342a713a0fbf/r=540&c=540x304/http/download.gannett.edgesuite.net/courierjournal/brightcove/29913742001/201510/2651/29913742001_4527749607001_4527615019001-vs.jpg", "http://download.gannett.edgesuite.net/courierjournal/brightcove/29913742001/201510/2651/29913742001_4527749607001_4527615019001-vs.jpg?pubId=29913742001", "http://cjky.it/1Rr431P", "http://espn.go.com/mens-college-basketball/story/_/id/13816205/louisville-cardinals-coach-rick-pitino-denies-knowledge-alleged-use-escort-service-recruiting", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/e50c613cc159a5eef0aa40b060f412a48c882c5a/c=0-69-2206-2275/local/-/media/2015/10/03/Louisville/Louisville/635794964115145629-UofLRedWhite-Pitino2.jpg", "http://download.gannett.edgesuite.net/courierjournal/brightcove/29913742001/201510/2651/29913742001_4527749608001_4527615019001-th.jpg?pubId=29913742001", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/8f6483db08ef7326dba2a7640b09f45c0ddf5b39/c=0-24-258-282/local/-/media/2015/10/04/Louisville/Louisville/635795755405511481-rsz-katina-powell---small.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-06T01:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T08:09:15.483+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
