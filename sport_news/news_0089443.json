After receiving a pass in traffic in the box, she set herself up before letting an amazing bicycle kick rip. The result? A stunned defense and a lead for her Knights.\nWhat makes this play amazing is that she was heavily guarded the entire time. This wasn’t just a case of having a lot of room to work with. Rodrigues felt the defenders on her back, so she kicked the ball up to herself to give her the room she needed. The defense looked a bit shocked that she even attempted the shot, so they were stunned when she found the back corner of the net for the goal.\nRodrigues is pretty used to scoring, as she leads the team with nine goals in 14 matches this year. It’s pretty safe to say that “Carol’s Crazy Cycle” on Sunday might just be the one everyone will remember.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BB5XEUw.img&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Syracuse", "https://www.youtube.com/iframe_api&quot;}", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAfmCBk.img&quot;}}", "https://www.fanduel.com/insider/feed/&quot;},{&quot;ns&quot;:&quot;ignore_this_version&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;System.Collections.Generic.List`1", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAf8yHp.img&quot;}},{&quot;csId&quot;:&quot;BB5Xmi3&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;#22", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAfk8jL.img&quot;}}", "https://www.fanduel.com/insider/2015/10/12/college-soccer-player-pulls-off-amazing-bicycle-kick-finish/&quot;,&quot;sourceFriendly&quot;:&quot;FanDuel&quot;,&quot;sourceLogo&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;UCF", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BB5XEUw.img&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Plays", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/b?&quot;,&quot;Category&quot;:&quot;soccer&quot;},&quot;HomePageLink&quot;:&quot;//www.msn.com/en-us&quot;,&quot;GeofenceUseSps&quot;:&quot;false&quot;,&quot;GeofenceEnabled&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;SwfCacheRefreshTime&quot;:86400,&quot;AdConfig&quot;:{&quot;FWFlashProfile&quot;:&quot;188286:MSN_US_AS3_LIVE&quot;,&quot;FWHtml5Profile&quot;:&quot;188286:MSN_HTML5_Live&quot;,&quot;FWNetworkId&quot;:188286,&quot;FWServer&quot;:&quot;http://2df7e.v.fwmrm.net&quot;,&quot;HybridPlayerAdInitTimeout", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BB5XEUw.img&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Goal", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAfdlBg.img&quot;}},{&quot;csId&quot;:&quot;BB5Xmi3&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;NC", "https://www.youtube.com/iframe_api&quot;,&quot;tags&quot;:"], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T19:27:12.586+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
