(Getty Images) \nThis version of the Blue Jays would not have been the first odds-on playoff favorite to crash and burn out of the divisional series in postseason history. \nBuried somewhere underneath the unwritten rules of baseball, there's a general assumption that the playoffs are essentially a lottery. You grind through the 162-game schedule (and a Wild Card Game, if needed) for a chance to toss your name into a hat, and see if you emerge as the victor through three rounds in the postseason. \nAfter a dominating second half though, and with David Price and Marcus Stroman lined up at home to start the ALDS, it seemed improbable the Jays would trail 2-0 heading to Texas, needing to become just the third team ever -- after the 2001 Yankees and 2012 Giants -- to win three straight after losing the first two games at home in a best-of-five series to advance past the first round. \nThis was the scenario facing the Jays after Price allowed five runs in seven innings in a Game 1 loss followed by a 14th inning defeat in Game 2. Prior to Sunday's game in Texas, manager John Gibbons was very clear in what their team needed to get back in the series. \n\"We need a big outburst with the bats,\" Gibbons said. \"If you look at our season, we score and win, we score in bunches. That's kind of our trademark. Their pitching's really shut us down the last two games. Hopefully we can do it one time, catch our breath a little bit and gain a little confidence. That's what it's going to take because that's really the identity of our club.\" \nThe Jays led the Majors with 891 runs scored during the regular season (127 runs more than the second best offense in the league, the New York Yankees) but managed just seven runs through the first two games of their series against the Rangers. Toronto was worst in the league -- 15-28 -- in one-run games, with a 16-56 record when they scored four runs or less. \nIn Game 3, Toronto put together a 2-0 lead heading into the sixth inning when Troy Tulowitzki stepped to the plate with runners on second and third and two outs. Tulo, one of the team's prized acquisitions near the trade deadline this year, was 0-for-11 in the series. He had not shown what he was capable of with his bat in 41 games with the Jays, during which he batted .239 with five home runs while missing time in September due to a cracked shoulder blade. While Toronto held the lead, the Rangers had four double plays on the evening. And then, Tulowitzki belted a three-run homer to left run to open up a five-run lead that the Jays would hold on to for a comfortable 5-1 win. \nYour browser does not support iframes. \n\"I think we learned from our mistakes,\" Tulowitzki said after the game. \"We were more patient in those big situations. It was something we had talked about today, because we can hit the long ball, late in the game, guys wanted to try and hit that home run. Today we put together good at-bats, walks, hitting the ball the other way and moving runners over. We just played better baseball overall.\" \n\"If [Tulowitzki] catches fire,\" Gibbons said. \"We're real dangerous.\" \nTulowitzki's home run would not have mattered without a masterful performance from starter Marco Estrada, who allowed one run and no walks in 6 1/3 innings. \nYour browser does not support iframes. \nWhile the offseason trade for Josh Donaldson and deadline acquisition of Tulowitzki and Price earned all the headlines, it was the under-the-radar trade of Estrada for Adam Lind that general manager Alex Anthopoulos made last November which paid huge dividends on Sunday with his team facing an early exit from the playoffs. \nLast season, the 32-year-old right hander gave up 29 home runs as a starter in Milwaukee, a total that led the Majors. After 9 2/3 shutout innings spanning five bullpen appearances in April with the Jays, Estrada was promoted to the starting rotation. Before Price arrived in Toronto and the return of Stroman from injury in September, and prior to R.A. Dickey and Mark Buehrle making their second half runs, Estrada was a stabilizing force in a rotation filled with question marks. Prior to Sunday, Estrada said he would treat Game 3 just like any other start, which would have been just fine for the Jays, as the right-hander started 28 games during the regular season, finishing with a 3.13 ERA, holding opposing hitters to a .203 batting average, which led the American League. With the season on the line, and the Jays having failed to win in both Price and Stroman's first starts of this series, Estrada stabilized the rotation once more. \n\"It felt great,\" Estrada said after the win. \"I wasn't really thinking about the situation. Obviously, I know we're down by two games, or we were. I just kept thinking, hey, the way you thought about pitching this year, why not just keep doing the same thing. That's basically the mentality I took.\" \nWith Estrada's performance and Tulowitzki's timely home run, the Jays have a chance to bring the series back to Toronto for a deciding fifth game, with another road win on Monday. Price warmed up in the bullpen late in Game 3, but did not enter the game. Gibbons plans on talking to his ace Monday to decide whether he will be available should things go awry for Game 4 starter R.A. Dickey. Otherwise, Stroman will also be available. In either scenario, the Jays are set up for either Price or Stroman to start a potential win-or-go-home fifth game. \nBut they're still a victory away from thinking about that. For now, they can hold off on answering questions about an early playoff exit and the disappointment of a terrific season ending way too early.
