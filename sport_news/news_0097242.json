The ACC's most efficient passer will have to be productive again facing a stout Pittsburgh front seven. Thus far, he's been able to make plays with his feet and arm against most opponents. Stephen D. Cannerelli | scannerelli@syracuse.com 3rd-down defense \nSyracuse's young defense has struggled to get off the field late in its last two games. Most recently, Virginia engineered a 10-point comeback in the fourth quarter behind 15- and 19-play drives. Back-breaking penalties like safety Kielan Whitner's late hit at South Florida and linebacker Zaire Franklin's face mask against UVA have factored into the defene's recent third-down deficiences. Stephen D. Cannerelli | scannerelli@syracuse.com Secondary problems \nSyracuse's entire defense has been shaky in the last couple weeks, but the secondary has appeared especially rough in 2015. Senior corner Julian Whigham continues to be picked on after a \"wasted\" year in 2014 and young players across the board have led to more missed assignments. Look for safety Rodney Williams to return from injury against Pitt and a potential shakeup in cornerback snaps . Improved play will be needed with stud wideout Tyler Boyd coming to town. Stephen D. Cannerelli | scannerelli@syracuse.com In lieu of Lewis \nWith redshirt junior hybrid Ben Lewis out for this contest , look for freshman Dontae Strickland to fill in as Erv Philips' primary backups. And since Syracuse often features dual-hybrid sets, Strickland could be in for his most snaps of the season. The explosive freshman has already found the end zone three times this year. His knowledge of the playbook and understanding of blocking assignments at a versatile position will be put to the test. Stephen D. Cannerelli | scannerelli@syracuse.com Hitting the hots \nOne aspect of Syracuse's offense that has a bit of room for improvement is Dungey's hot reads . When the opposing team sends one more blitzer than SU can block, the freshman quarterback has to identify the best receiving option and fire off a throw quickly. He's spending time this week practicing a first step to avoid pressure that sets up the fast release. Stephen D.
