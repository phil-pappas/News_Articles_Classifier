But when it is about 4th-and-1 and I decide to go for it, I’m giving the ball to Le’Veon Bell every time. \nFor some inexplicable reason, the Steelers in a crucial situation decided to throw a pass instead of handing off to Bell. Actually twice. So when they turned the ball over to the Ravens, it naturally inspired the famous words: “C’mon man!” \nI’m sure it inspired other words from Steelers fans that aren’t printable in a family newspaper. \nOf course if Steelers kicker Josh Scobee makes a field goal or two earlier, the game wouldn’t have gone to overtime either. Part of the reason the Steelers decided to go for it in 4th-down situations late in the regulation. \nAdmittedly Heinz Field is a tough place to kick long field goals – statistics show that. But it didn’t seem to bother Baltimore kicker Justin Tucker who nailed a couple long ones including the overtime game-winner. \nThe Steelers defense didn’t help a whole lot either as they gave up 150 yards rushing to Justin Forsett, who had been shut down by three other teams prior to Thursday. And I thought the passing defense was a weakness. \nSpeaking of weakness, how about those Cleveland Browns? As pathetic as they have been in the past decade or so, this team could be the worst group yet. \nTheir performance against Oakland last week was miserable. And at home, to boot. \nOther than the kicking game, the Browns are sad on both sides of the football. Let’s face it: If you can’t run the football and you can’t stop the run, you aren’t going to win a lot of games. \nMaybe none. \nOf course some fans will blame Josh McCown, who was reinstated as the starter last week as the starting QB after Johnny Manziel led the team to a win the week before. McCown certainly wasn’t outstanding, but there were other bigger problems. \nThe way things are shaping up we will see the revolving door of coaches in Cleveland continue to spin at the end of the season (if not before). \nThe coaching staff seems to have no grip on what they are doing and the team appears totally unprepared. \nThe running game is abysmal and on defense last week they were allowing huge runs to the Raiders. \nAnd never once did they get even close to Oakland QB Derek Carr, who doesn’t exactly rank up there with the best in the league. \nToday the Browns travel to San Diego. The Chargers aren’t very good, but they are certainly good enough to handle a dysfunctional Browns team. \nLook for a 27-13 San Diego win. \nLast week my picks went 11-4 for a season mark of 27-19. Following are the rest of this week’s predictions, betting line in parentheses just for fun: \nGreen Bay (-8 1/2) over San Fran \nAtlanta (-6 1/2) over Houston \nTampa (plus 3) over Carolina \nMinnesota (plus 6 1/2) over Denver \nArizona (-7) over St. Louis \nSeattle (-9 1/2) over Detroit \nMiami (plus 2 1/2) over NY Jets \nIndy (-8 1/2) over Jacksonville \nBuffalo (-6) over NY Giants \nChicago (plus 3) over Oakland \nPhilly (-3) over Washington \nKansas City (plus 4) over Cincy \nDallas (no line) over New Orleans \nLYNN SATERNOW is sports editor of The Herald.
