Williams\nRoseburg attracted international attention this last week when a lone gunman killed nine people and injured nine others at Umpqua Community College. It was yet another horrific and violent incident involving a school in our state. It was senseless and inexplicable. It has brought untold pain to many local families. It should not have happened.\nThe first responders to this violent scene, however, deserve our admiration. Shortly after a 911 call was received that an active shooter was at the school, two Roseburg police detectives and an Oregon State Police trooper arrived on the scene. Moments later, the two Roseburg police detectives risked their lives when they encountered the shooter. These were selfless acts of heroism that saved additional lives.\nMost of us never face dangerous situations like this, but law enforcement officers routinely find themselves confronting difficult, dangerous and sometimes violent situations that require split-second decisions and life-threatening risks. This is a reality that is too often neglected or underappreciated.\nWorking round the clock over several days, city, county, state and federal law enforcement officers, first responders and agents addressed this mass shooting incident professionally, efficiently and cooperatively. I was in Roseburg on behalf of the U.S. attorney's office, and I was impressed to see how effectively the various agencies came together to work on a dangerous and complex investigation. Many of the officers, agents and first responders involved, however, regularly put their lives on the line for the community. And I was pleased to witness how the Roseburg community appreciated those efforts. While taking a break with law enforcement partners in a cafe, two local citizens took the time to thank us for being in Roseburg and helping their community. It was humbling. It was also illuminating in that it demonstrated the success of some of the community trust-building efforts that have been undertaken across this nation. Every day, citizens and law enforcement officers interact in positive ways in their communities. Roseburg is an excellent example of this, even though such a kind, simple gesture — like that of the two cafe patrons — may never make the news. What's important is that acts of this kind go a long way toward building positive relationships between the community and law enforcement.\nMuch of the national focus over the past year has been on the dysfunctional relationships that exist between the public and police. Ferguson, New York, Baltimore, Chicago and other cities witnessed officer-involved shootings that prompted questions about police tactics. Debate about the appropriate use of deadly force as counterbalanced against the need for officer safety is not new. It is an important topic and a discussion that will and should continue. The public needs to trust its law enforcement officers, and police officers need to be able to safely do their work. The Department of Justice is fully committed to achieving both of these goals. Keeping citizens safe from harm and responding to tragic circumstances like those that took place in Roseburg last week reveal the best that law enforcement can be to a community. Building trust is critically important. So is thanking those who serve our communities.\nI urge all Oregonians to take a moment to thank a cop, a firefighter, an EMT or any of the many law enforcement professionals who routinely risk their lives to keep us safe. On behalf of the U.S. attorney's office to the men and women who responded to the tragedy in Roseburg, thank you for your service to our community.\n•\nBilly J.
