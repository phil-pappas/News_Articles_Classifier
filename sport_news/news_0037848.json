On those rare occasions when the Green Hornets are defeated, it tends to linger on their minds. \nEmmaus suffered a shocking 1-0 loss to Stroudsburg last season in the Eastern Pennsylvania Conference title game at Pleasant Valley High School. \nThe Green Hornets could gain some measure of revenge when the teams meet for this year’s EPC title game on Thursday at a time and site to be determined. \nEmmaus advanced to the title game with a 4-0 win over Easton on Tuesday night at J. Birney Crum Stadium in Allentown. \nRELATED : Emmaus' Meredith Sholder has an unparalleled enthusiasm for field hockey \nStroudsburg earned a spot in the final with a 2-1 overtime win over Whitehal l at Pleasant Valley. Emmaus and Stroudsburg didn’t play during the regular season. \n“We’re really excited for that game,” Emmaus junior star Meredith Sholder said. “We really want to take that title back. It’s going to be a tough, competitive game because Stroudsburg is really good. But I know we’ll be ready.” \nBoth teams ran through the conference season unbeaten. Emmaus is 19-0 overall while Stroudsburg is 18-1 with its only loss coming to state power Crestwood. \nThe key for Stroudsburg, as it is for each of Emmaus’ opponents, will hinge on its ability to slow down the high-scoring Sholder, who has an astounding 53 goals and 35 assists this season. \nStop Sholder, which is virtually impossible to do, and Emmaus still has a number of other threats that can hurt you. Junior Kira Koehler registered two goals against Easton. \n“I’m really excited (for Stroudsburg),” Koehler said. “We’ll definitely be ready. We’ll practice hard and we’ll be ready to regain our title.” \nEmmaus coach Sue Butz-Stavin is just happy her team was able to take care of business against Easton. \n“I’m very happy just to be playing for the title no matter who it’s against, “Butz-Stavin said, “but the girls have goals and missions and they’ll play to the best of their abilities on Thursday.” \nTom Hinkel may be reached at thinkel@lehighvalleylive.com .
