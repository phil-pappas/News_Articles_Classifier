When there was still snow on the ground in Montreal last winter, the Impact were training at high altitude in Mexico during an unexpected run to the CONCACAF Champions League final. THE CANADIAN PRESS/AP,Christian Palma) \n\"It's been a really long time,\" forward Dominic Oduro said this week. \"That edge is out of us now.\n\"It's going to be a whole different chapter. But every team goes out there to play in that altitude so you can't make any excuses. We have to be one of the teams that goes out there and gets a result.\"\nThe Impact have never taken a point against the Rapids, going 0-3-0 since joining Major League Soccer in 2012. They have lost both meetings at Dick's Sporting Goods Park, including a 4-1 setback last season.\nBut if they are ever going to beat Colorado, now is the time.\nThe Impact (12-13-6) are clinging to the sixth and final Eastern Conference playoff position, only one point ahead of Orlando with a game in hand. A win would eliminate New York City, which is five points back, and put Orlando in deep trouble with only two regular season games to play.\nThe Rapids (8-13-10) are last in the Western Conference and are winless in five games. They were officially eliminated with a 2-1 loss to Salt Lake last weekend.\n\"We control our own destiny,\" said Oduro. \"You win, you're in, pretty much.\n\"So it's up to us to make it happen. We have that chance.\"\nThe Impact have made it hard on themselves.\nThe game in Colorado will be their third on the road in eight days, following a crushing 2-1 loss at Orlando, when they could have clinched a playoff spot but instead let the Lions back in the race, and a 2-1 loss to the first-place New York Red Bulls on Wednesday night.\nThe Impact came out flat against New York and right back Ambroise Oyongo was expelled for a hand ball 15 minutes in, leaving Montreal with 10 men the rest of the way.\nIt was Didier Drogba who kept it close, playing mind games that contributed to Sasha Kljestan missing a second Red Bulls penalty and then scoring himself from the spot in the 68th minute to give the Impact some hope.\nIt was the former Chelsea striker's eighth goal in as many MLS games, tying him for the team lead with Oduro and Ignacio Piatti.\n\"You never know when designated players come in, there are always skeptics and people talk about age, but he shown he's come here for the right reasons and he's part of the group,\" Impact captain Patrice Bernier said of Drogba. \"He wants to push this team to go as far as it can.\"\nPiatti was held out of the New York game because he hadn't enough time to adjust after returning from attending to a family matter in Argentina.\nHis chemistry with Drogba could be crucial against Colorado. And his compatriot, midfielder Andres Romero, should also see action after sitting out a game.\nMidfielder Johan Vengas (Costa Rico) is away on international duty, as are defender Wandrille Lefevre and midfielder Maxim Tissot with Canada. Oyongo and midfielder Marco Donadel are serving one-game suspensions.\nThere was a scare in the 71st minute when it appeared defender Laurent Ciman was shown the yellow card, which would have brought a suspension. But the caution was for Bernier.\nThe Impact play a fourth straight road game Oct. 17 in New England.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T09:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T03:18:09.359+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
