Tennessee Titans quarterback Marcus Mariota (8) walks off the field with head coach Ken Whisenhunt after Mariota was injured in the first half of an NFL football game against the Miami Dolphins Sunday, Oct. 18, 2015, in Nashvil... \nNASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) - Tennessee Titans rookie Marcus Mariota will not play Sunday against Atlanta as he recovers from a sprained MCL in his left knee. Zach Mettenberger will start at quarterback. \nCoach Ken Whisenhunt said Friday that Mariota has been ruled out after missing practice all week. \nMariota sprained the medial collateral ligament in his left knee when hit low by Miami defensive end Olivier Vernon in last week's 38-10 loss to the Dolphins. Mariota stayed in the game wearing a brace. \nMettenberger started six of the seven games he played last season as a rookie. The sixth-round draft pick out of LSU still is looking for his first career win. \nThe Titans (1-4) also will be without wide receiver Harry Douglas (ribs) and starting cornerback Perrish Cox (hamstring). \n___ \nAP NFL websites: http://www.pro32.ap.org and http://www.twitter.com/AP_NFL  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T21:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T21:52:45.940+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
