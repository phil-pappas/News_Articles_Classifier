Zaheer (left) and Laxman at an event in Pune in 2013 \nLaxman, who is a member of BCCI's high-powered Cricket Advisory Committee (CAC), spoke about how good Zaheer can be as a bowling coach. \n\"I think because of Zaheer's vast knowledge and experience and more importantly his communication skills, he will prove to be an excellent bowling coach, who can help in the development of young fast bowlers. His reading of the game is probably one of the best I have seen. I am sure that he will contribute immensely he will contribute in the growth of fast bowlers in the country,\" Laxman told PTI-Bhasha today. \nTowards the end of his career, Zaheer also became a mentor to the next crop of fast bowlers. \"I would say that a lot wickets of other fast bowlers, who have played for India along with Zaheer, they have to give credit to him for some of the wickets that they took. He was fantastic with young fast bowlers,\" Laxman said. \n\"I would like to congratulate Zaheer for his outstanding career. For me his greatness was not only that he was skillful but he had the ability to plan a dismissal. His greatness lay in the fact that he became a world class performer despite not having great facilities at the start of his career,\" said Laxman. \n\"Having normal background and coming from a small town like Shrirampur and going through a tough time in Mumbai but still persevering and was determined to play at highest level so he is an inspiration for a lot of youngsters,\" said the stylish batsman from Hyderabad. \nLaxman then fondly recollected that Zaheer was his roommate when he scored that epic 281 in Kolkata and how he inspired him before the start of the second innings against Australia. \n\"Since 2001, I became very close with Zaheer. He was my roommate when I played 281 knock against Australia at Eden. I still remember him saying that it's an opportunity for me to do something special for the country before the start of second innings. He is one of the closest friends I have got In my life,\" said the veteran. \nPTI", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T13:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T14:29:34.218+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
