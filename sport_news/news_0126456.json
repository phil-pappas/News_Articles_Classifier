Crews were continuing to assess homes in the area, and Lee said the number of those destroyed could rise.\nGary and Gina Hartle, who own a 70-acre horse ranch in Lake Hughes, said they have so much work to restore their property, they have no idea how long it will take.\n\"Our property is 75 percent devastated,\" Gina Hartle, 54, told The Associated Press as she surveyed the damage. \"We can't access our homes too well right now because everything is washed out.\"\nShe said the two homes on the land seemed like they were OK, but that one of the homes was without water because of an inpump, and their 20-foot trailer is nowhere in sight.\n\"It either got buried or it's downriver,\" Hartle said.\nAssociated Press writer Christopher Weber contributed to this report.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
