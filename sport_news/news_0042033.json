But there was nothing misleading about a succinct statement Belichick made about the Cowboys, who the Patriots play Sunday in Dallas. “Best offensive line in the league,” Belichick said Wednesday. He’s not alone in that assessment. Left tackle Tyron Smith, center Travis Frederick and right guard Zack Martin were all voted first-team All-Pros last season. All three are former first-round picks: Smith was drafted ninth out of USC in 2011, Frederick 31st out of Wisconsin in 2013 and Martin 16th out of Notre Dame in 2014. Completing the unit are left guard Ronald Leary, who has started since making the Cowboys as an undrafted rookie out of Memphis in 2012; and right tackle Doug Free, a sixth-year starter and ninth-year pro taken in the fourth round out of Northern Illinois in 2007. “Those guys, we love coaching them because they come to work and all they want to be known as is the hardest-working group in football,” said Jason Garrett, who is 43-34 since taking over as head coach of the Cowboys midway through the 2010 season. “They’re real professionals. They go about it the right way and they’re always trying to get better, and that’s really where their focus is.” Continuity has also contributed to the success of the Cowboys’ offensive line. Smith, Leary, Martin and Free have all started for at least the past three seasons. Martin joined them last year and might already be the best of the blocking bunch. “They’re big, physical, they run well and they play well together,” defensive end Rob Ninkovich said. “I think that’s one common thing. A good offensive line plays well together and they communicate well. I think they do that at a high level. It’s definitely a very good offensive line and a good challenge for us and it starts [Wednesday] to get ready for that.” Crash course for Hicks The Patriots acquired defensive end Akiem Hicks from the New Orleans Saints last Thursday during the bye week. It’s been a crash course in NEP 101 since then for the fourth-year pro. So far, so good. “He’s worked really hard,” Belichick said. “I mean, he’s a sharp guy. He’s been in the league, so he’s got a familiarity. And Rob [Ryan]’s defense, I‘d say there is probably some carryover from what he did in New Orleans to what we do here. I’m not saying it’s the same, but there is some part of the family of each of those that’s connected. “But yeah, it’s just kind of learning our words and our terms and relating them to things he’s done in the past. I don’t think we’re going to be asking him to do things he’s never done before. I think he’s working hard to pick it up.” Hicks credited his work ethic to his dad, Frank Hicks, who spent 22 years in the Army and achieved the rank of master sergeant. “One of my traits I carry with me everywhere I go is discipline,” Hicks said. “My dad was in the military for 22 years, so it’s something that I believe in. So I’ve definitely been dedicated and working hard toward learning this scheme and being able to be a help to this defense.” No one missing at practice The Patriots had a full house at practice once again on Wednesday. The team wasn’t missing a single player during their second practice of the week. They have two more sessions before departing for Dallas on Saturday. The only player missing from practice over the past couple of weeks was Ryan Wendell, who was out with an illness, but he returned Monday and practiced for a second day in a row on Wednesday. Wendell was listed on the team's first injury report of the week, with an illness, but he was a full participant on Wednesday. Tarell Brown (foot) and Trey Flowers (knee/shoulder) were the only two players who were limited. Flowers hasn't appeared in a game this season and has been on the practice report since Week One, but with a knee injury. The shoulder injury appears to be new. Brown was active but didn't appear in the Patriots last game against Jacksonville. This is the first time he's been on the injury report. Logan Ryan and Dont'a Hightower were both removed from the practice report.
