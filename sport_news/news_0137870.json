The Red Bull Air Race is followed by millions of fans worldwide and has been growing in popularity since its creation in 2003.\nAggreko negotiated a global agreement in early 2015 that secured it powering four races out of the eight stops, which included Rovinj (Croatia), Ascot (UK), Dallas and Las Vegas (USA).\nOn the US tour, Aggreko will provide 1.2 MW of power through multiple generators, and the company will activate its proprietary Aggreko Remote Monitoring (ARM) service, on the critical generators used to power Red Bull TV.\nThe added support of ARM provides real-time asset monitoring and dedicated diagnostic support by Aggreko’s technical experts, which will aid in preventing issues, improving uptime and helping keep the operations running at peak efficiency. Aggreko will also provide multiple panels of distribution and several hundred miles of cable for the event.\n“The global agreement is a great example of the innovative work being done by Aggreko Event Services around the world,” said Gary Meador, head of Aggreko Event Services North America. “We are able to work with our global team and provide rental power for the Red Bull air race as well as supply additional dual voltage support for equipment coming from Europe that are required to meet US specifications.”\nThe fastest motorsport series in the world features 14 of the best race pilots in a pure motorsport competition that combines speed, precision and skill. Using the fastest, most agile and lightweight racing planes, pilots navigate a low-level aerial track made up of air-filled pylons 25 meters high.\nAggreko is widely known for powering large scale events such as the Olympic Games, PGA Tour, Tour de France, Ryder Cup, and FIFA World Cup. Most recently, the world leading power provider powered its third Pan American/Parapan American Games and the broadcast center with its power systems and temperature control solutions.\n###\nAbout Aggreko\nAggreko plc is the world leader in the supply of temporary power and temperature control solutions. Aggreko employs over 7,700 people operating from 211 locations. In 2014 we served customers in about 100 countries, and had revenues of approximately GBP 1.6bn (USD 2.6bn or Euros 2.0bn).\nAggreko provides power and temperature control solutions to customers who need them either very quickly, or for a short or indeterminate length of time. Examples would be the supply of power to an industrial site which needs to service its permanent power supply, supplying a whole city in times of power shortage, or providing a major sporting event with power and cooling systems. We serve our customers either through our 211 service centres, which we call the Local business, or globally through our Power Projects business.\nIn the Local business, which accounts for about half of our revenues, we hire our equipment to customers, who then operate it for themselves, although we retain responsibility for servicing and maintaining it. In the Power Projects business, which also accounts for about half of our revenues, we operate as a power producer. We install and operate power plants and we charge our customers both for providing the generating capacity, and for the electricity we produce. We design and manufacture equipment specifically for these requirements in our factory in Dumbarton, Scotland.\nRecent customers include the 2014 FIFA World Cup BrazilTM, the XX Commonwealth Games and Cirque du Soleil and the power utilities in over 50 countries including the UK, France, Ivory Coast, Mozambique, Indonesia, Bangladesh, Argentina, Venezuela, Chile, Brazil and the USA.\nIn 2014 we fulfilled over 55,000 customers’ assignments and of those who responded to our research, 67% gave us a recommendation of 9 or 10 out of 10.\nFor the latest updates, please subscribe to our social media channels on LinkedIn, Twitter or Facebook\nFor further information, visit http://www.aggreko.com .\nAbout the Red Bull Air Race World Championship\nCreated in 2003, officially the World Championship of air racing since 2005, the Red Bull Air Race is followed by millions of fans worldwide.
