I was losing confidence in my game and starting to wonder if I would even be a factor to my team in college.” \nWickenden said things began to change for him when Greg Martin, a senior on the team and the team's de facto number one golfer, took him under his wing. \n“He explained to me that he was the same way at the beginning of his college golf career and to just stick to it and practice with a purpose and your time will come,” he said. “That's when something clicked.” \nThat, in addition to coach Mike Dugas recommending Wickenden make “a small tweak” in his swing, and Wickenden was back in business. \n“Our next match went much better and I got my first collegiate top-10 finish and was named NAC rookie of the week,” Wickenden said. \nWickenden's season, thus far, has been impressive as he finished tied for fifth at the Husson Invitational Sept. 26-27 at the Bangor Municipal Golf Course, as he carded a 73 and 74 for a combined 147 over the two-day event. \nThe Eagles finished second among 12 teams, falling to St. Joseph's College of Standish by one stroke. \nIn the Maine Intercollegiate Championship Sept. 19-20 at the Fairlawn Golf & Country Club in Poland, Wickenden finished 4-under par 68 on day one and even-par 72 on day two to combine for a 140, which gave him his first tournament win as a freshman. \n“This was my first collegiate win and a memory I won't soon forget,” he said. “Lucky for me my mom, dad and sister were all there to watch which made it even better.” \nThe Eagles again finished second among 12 teams, again falling to St. Joseph's College by one stroke. \nIn the Bowdoin Invitational Sept. 12-13 at the Brunswick Golf Club, Wickenden shot 77 on day one and a 74 on day two to combine for 151, finishing sixth overall in the tournament. \nThe Eagles finished fifth among 11 teams, as Endicott College of Beverly, Mass. won the team championship. \nIn the 13th annual John Queenan Memorial Tournament at Point Sebago Golf Resort Sept. 8, a one-day tourney, Wickenden carded 79 to finish eighth. \nThe Eagles finished fourth among the six teams, as the University of Southern Maine won the title. \nWickenden was a terrific golfer all four years at Camden Hills, including helping lead the Windjammers to state Class B championships in 2013 and 2014. He also played baseball for the Windjammers and was one of the team's top pitchers, for a squad that reached the state Class B title game last spring. \nHusson University is scheduled to play in the Mariner Invitational on Thursday, Oct. 1 at the Augusta Country Club. \nHe added that while the individual accolades are nice, he is focused on helping his team win the NAC championship Oct. 9-10 at Rutland Country Club in Rutland, Vt. \n“If our team can pull that off then we go to nationals, which has been a dream of mine sense I started thinking about college golf and here is our opportunity,” he said. “So far college golf has been a blast for me and I really look forward to the next four years.” \nCourier Publications' sports staff can be reached by email at sports@villagesoup.com or by phone at 594-4401.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T20:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T08:59:06.211+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
