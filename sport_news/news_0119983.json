The first is in pool play on Thursday and the second is on finals day provided both teams get past Samoa and Fiji. \nVeteran Black Sticks defender Ryan Archibald knows just how important the week is. \n\"There's a lot at stake for us, an Olympics spot up for grabs. Rio is the carrot absolutely. Everyone wants to qualify. It's the pinnacle of our sport,\" he said. \n\"Australia are a high tempo team. They play the fastest style of game at a high skill level. That's why they are ranked No 1. They're physical and aggressive and that's something we will have to deal with.\" \nArchibald, who missed the last Oceania Cup tournament in Stratford two years ago, said the side had prepared well. \n\"We had a good series against India. They're a quality team, but they're different from Australia. We lost the series to them, but played some good games.\" \nArchibald said there would be a few nerves in the New Zealand camp. \n\"I imagine there will be a few nerves come the big one on Sunday. But nerves are natural and the guys will be prepared.\" \nOn a personal note, Archibald is sure to add to his tally of 295 games for his country. If he played in all four games in Stratford, he would go to 299. \n\"I might just fall short of 300 this week, but it doesn't matter. I'd much rather win the final.\" \nArchibald is also hoping home-town support would play a major part. \n\"Hopefully the crowd will get in behind us. I know there's a lot of people travelling to Stratford for the tournament and I'm sure the local support will be there.\" \nNew Zealand, ranked seventh in the world, missed out on qualifying for Rio at the FIH World League semifinal tournament earlier this year. The Oceania Cup tournament is their last chance. \n\"We know it's going to be a huge challenge for us but there's a lot of excitement as well. We know we can do it,\" said Black Sticks captain Simon Child. \nThe Black Sticks are without veteran striker Phil Burrows, defender-midfielder Shea McAleese and defender Andy Hayward who have opted to stay in Europe playing club hockey. \nIt's a different story for the Black Sticks women's team - they have already qualified for Rio as have Australia. \nWhile the two sides are certain to meet in Sunday's final, there's still plenty to play for with world ranking points up for grabs. It's also an important part of the New Zealand team's buildup to the World League final tournament in Argentina in December. \nAT A GLANCE \nBlack Sticks men: Ryan Archibald, Simon Child (captain), James Coughlan, Steve Edwards, Nick Haig, Hugo Inglis, Stephen Jenness, Devon Manchester, Leo Mitai-Wells, George Muir, Arun Panchia, Kyle Pontifex, Nick Ross, Kane Russell, Brad Shaw, Blair Tarrant, Nick Wilson, Nic Woods \nBlack Sticks women: Sam Charlton, Sophie Cocks, Amelia Gibson, Jordan Grant, Ella Gunson, Pippa Hayward, Charlotte Harrison, Kat Henry, Rose Keddell, Julia King, Olivia Merry, Stacey Michelsen, Brooke Neal, Kirsten Pearce, Anita Punt (captain), Sally Rutherford, Liz Thompson, Petrea Webster. \nTHE DRAW", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T04:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T04:37:33.264+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
