Getting them all on the field at the same time, however, has been difficult. Here's a breakdown of the Bills' broken-down roster heading into Week 7.

(Photo: Jae S. Lee / The Tennessean) Story Highlights Percy Harvin has been bothered by a chronic hip injury since 2013. Rex Ryan officially ruled out Tyrod Taylor and Sammy Watkins from Sunday's game. \nWATFORD, England - There was clearly something askew with Percy Harvin when Rex Ryan announced Wednesday that he did not make the trip to London with the Bills. \nThe answer came Thursday when published reports indicated that the seventh-year wide receiver remained in the United States because he is contemplating what to do about his football future. \nThere were mixed signals regarding what Harvin was doing â€” the Buffalo News reported he is contemplating retirement, while ESPN refuted the retirement report, saying he's concerned about his ongoing hip injury and isn't sure whether he can continue playing this year. \nAll Ryan knows is that Harvin won't be on the field Sunday at Wembley Stadium when the Bills face the Jacksonville Jaguars. QB EJ Manuel gets start for Bills in London \nWhen he was asked for an update on Harvin, and to confirm that he definitely won't be traveling overseas to join the team, Ryan said that Harvin was indeed out for the game, then added, \"I'm not going to say any more on it because I don't know where he is.\" \nHarvin has battled his hip injury for more than two years. After signing a rich free agent contract with Seattle prior to 2013, he underwent surgery and missed almost the entire regular season. He did return for the postseason, and he returned the second-half kickoff for a touchdown in the Seahawks' 43-8 blowout of Denver in Super Bowl 48. \nThe Seahawks traded Harvin to Ryan's Jets early last year amid reports that Harvin was a problem inside the locker room. Harvin, according to Ryan, was a model citizen and a great teammate in New York, and when the Jets decided not to re-sign him as a free agent, Ryan pounced on the chance in March to bring him to Buffalo. \nHarvin missed a good chunk of training camp and all of the preseason dealing with the hip injury, and he has been given rest days every Wednesday of the regular season. After playing in the first five games, Harvin could not go last week against Cincinnati, and even if he doesn't decide to call it quits, it seems like he's going to be sidelined for several weeks, if not the rest of this year. Sal Maiorana reports from Day 2 of Bills practice in London. \nWatkins is out: In addition to announcing that quarterback Tyrod Taylor would not play in the game, Ryan went ahead and declared several other players out. Obviously, the four players who did not come to London are all out; Harvin, defensive tackle Kyle Williams (knee), running back Karlos Williams (concussion), and offensive tackle Seantrel Henderson (concussion). Also, wide receiver Sammy Watkins, who suffered an ankle injury last week, will not be able to dress. \nRyan said special teamer Marcus Easley, who may have to take some snaps at receiver, participated in practice on a limited basis with his shoulder injury. As for cornerback Leodis McKelvin, he also worked on a limited basis as he works his way off the Non-football/Injury list. McKelvin's chances for playing seem long. Postcards from London: Sal's British birthday bash \nRoot for the Bills: It is said that fans often just root for laundry. You root for players on your team, and then once they change uniforms, they no longer exist in your universe, until they come around as an opponent. Ryan hinted that perhaps Englanders should be pulling for the Bills Sunday because they have the same red, white, and blue colors as the Union Jack. \n\"I think the big thing out of today is the fact it just dawned on me that the fans here in London, they definitely should be cheering for the Bills,\" Ryan said. \"Got the same colors, the Union Jack, all that kind of stuff. When in doubt, what do you want, teal? What is Jacksonville, come on please, stop.\" \nMAIORANA@Gannett.com General view of a mural of Buffalo Bills running back LeSean McCoy (25) and Jacksonville Jaguars quarterback Blake Bortles at Niketown London.
