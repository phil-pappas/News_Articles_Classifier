Hamilton started second behind Rosberg and took over the lead from his Mercedes teammate when Rosberg suffered a throttle problem that forced him to slow to a crawl and then come into the pits to retire. With four races to go, Hamilton leads Vettel by 66 points and Rosberg by 73. MLB Tulo-led Blue Jays avoid ALDS elimination ARLINGTON, Texas – Troy Tulowitzki drove in four runs, including a three-run homer for his first hit this postseason, and the Toronto Blue Jays avoided elimination in the AL Division Series with a 5-1 win over the Texas Rangers in Game 3 Sunday night. Texas has another chance Monday to clinch the series at home. If not, a deciding Game 5 will be played Wednesday in Toronto, where the Rangers won the first two games. Tulowitzki’s two-out homer in the sixth put the Blue Jays up 5-0. That was two innings after he drew a bases-loaded walk. Holland (4-3) starts Game 4 against knuckleballer R.A. Dickey (11-11) Astros take 2-1 series lead over Royals with 4-2 win HOUSTON – Dallas Keuchel remained perfect at home with seven gutsy innings, and Chris Carter homered Sunday, leading the Houston Astros to a 4-2 win over the Kansas City Royals to take a 2-1 lead in the American League Division Series. The Astros could wrap up the best-of-five series with a win over the defending AL champions in Game 4 Monday. Keuchel, who shut down the Yankees in the AL wild-card game, worked out of jam after jam, allowing five hits and one run with seven strikeouts after going 15-0 at home this season, a modern major league record. Tennis Djokovic beats Nadal for 6th China Open title BEIJING – Novak Djokovic defeated Rafael Nadal 6-2, 6-2 on Sunday to win his sixth China Open title and improve his record at the tournament to a sterling 29-0. Djokovic had seven aces to none for his Spanish rival, and saved both break points he faced in the match, which was the 45th between the two players. Nadal still leads 23-22 but hasn’t beaten Djokovic since the French Open final last year and hasn’t prevailed on hard courts since the 2013 U.S. Open final. WNBA Catchings helps Fever force Game 5 against Lynx INDIANAPOLIS – Shenise Johnson scored 15 points and Marissa Coleman added 14 to help the Indiana Fever beat the Minnesota Lynx 75-69 on Sunday night, forcing a decisive Game 5 in the WNBA Finals. As they’ve done all playoffs, the Fever found a way to stave off elimination. Indiana is 5-0 in elimination games this postseason and 9-2 since the 2012 playoffs when it beat Minnesota for its lone title. Trailing 38-36 early in the third quarter, Indiana took control with a 13-2 run. Johnson scored the final four points of the burst. Indiana led 51-44 before Coleman scored five straight, including a 3-pointer that gave the Fever the biggest lead of the series for either team at 58-44. That was the Fever’s only basket in a nine-minute stretch. Indiana had just one basket in the final quarter allowing Minnesota to rally within four behind Maya Moore, but the Lynx could get no closer.
