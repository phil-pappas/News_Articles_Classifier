Show Caption Previous Next \nNAPLES, Fla. - The LPGA’s CME Group Tour Championship has grown and grown in its three years in Naples. Last year, it gave out the second-largest paycheck in the history of women’s sports. \nNow it’s going to network TV. \nThe tournament announced Wednesday at its media day at Tiburon Golf Club at the Ritz-Carlton Golf Resort that the final round on Sunday, Nov. 22 will be televised by ABC from 2 to 4 p.m. with limited commercial interruptions thanks to CME Group. The first three rounds still will be on the Golf Channel, with ESPN producing the telecasts. \n“For us to have a network opportunity and get more eyes on the game and on our players and superstars is great,” LPGA tournament director Dennis Baggett said. \n“We’re absolutely thrilled with that,” said Anita Liskey, CME Group’s managing director of corporate marketing and communications. \nTom Rinaldi will call the play-by-play on ABC’s telecast, joining the team that called the RICOH Women’s British Open Championship on ESPN: Dottie Pepper, Judy Rankin, Andy North and Bill Kratzert, led by coordinating producer Mike McQuade. \n“We are thrilled to have the final round of our 2015 LPGA season air live on ABC,” LPGA Commissioner Mike Whan said in a press release. “Combining our incredible Golf Channel weekly coverage, with a steady diet of network opportunities, is a critical component to our continued growth. This way we cannot only reach our core audience, but also capture the casual fan, that may not be aware of the incredible stories taking place on the LPGA. \n“Thanks to CME Group, we are able to showcase the final step to our season-long Race to the CME Globe, and do so with limited commercial interruption. \nCME Group Executive Chairman and President Terry Duffy, a Naples resident, also was thrilled with the agreement. \n“We are pleased that ABC has agreed to live broadcast the final round of the LPGA season,” Duffy said in a press release. “Combined with Golf Channel’s stellar weekly coverage, this is an incredible opportunity to showcase the talent and celebrate the achievements of these remarkable athletes from across the globe while also providing significant exposure for the CME Group brand. \n“We also thank Commissioner Mike Whan and all our friends at the LPGA for their hard work and dedication to growing to growing the LPGA into a world-class brand.” \nLydia Ko, then 17, won the first Race to the CME Globe points race last year and the CME Group Tour Championship, winning in a playoff. She won the second-largest payout in the history of women’s sports at $1.5 million. Ko won the $1 million Race to the CME Globe and $500,000 for the tournament win. \nKo won the Evian Masters this year to become the youngest LPGA Tour player to win a major. She and the top 71 on the Race to the CME Globe points after the Lorena Ochoa tournament in Mexico next month will qualify for the CME Group Tour Championship. \nNaples High graduate Kris Tamulis sewed up one of those berths after her first LPGA Tour win, the Yokohama Tire LPGA Classic in Mobile, Alabama, last month. Tamulis was supposed to be at Wednesday’s press conference, but qualified for the Sime Darby LPGA Malaysia, and left to go there. \nAnd Brittany Lincicome, who was at Tiburon on Wednesday, is in position to be eligible for the $1 million payday. If Lincicome, who won her second major earlier this year, can do well enough in the five events she has left to move up from 14th, she could get in the points list’s top nine, who mathematically have a shot at the $1 million. \nThat would be a perfect cap to an already memorable year for Lincicome, who got engaged last December. She won the ANA Inspiration in April, beating Stacy Lewis in a three-hole playoff, and then was part of the Solheim Cup, where the U.S. rallied from an 8-5 deficit to win by a point thanks to a 9 1/2-5 1/2 romp in singles. \nThe party carried on for Lincicome the week after, stopping in Miami and the Florida Keys. \n“It was a 30th birthday and bachelorette party, all in one,” said Lincicome, who will get married sometime in December. “We were going to Miami and we ended up in the Keys. Being somebody who likes water and fishing, it was kind of a perfect place for me to go. It was nice, the week after Solheim, we were all just completely dead, and just needed time to relax. We sat by the pool during the day, and we went out to nice dinners at night.” Copyright 2015 Journal Media Group. All rights reserved.
