Northern South Dakota will have sunshine last a little longer today but clouds will thicken during the afternoon. \nRain will be likely in central and western South Dakota after 3:00 this afternoon. Rain will become widespread across KELOLAND later this evening and tonight. In the meantime, afternoon highs will be in the 50s and 60s. \nRain will last through the overnight and into Friday morning. As the system moves through eastern KELOLAND, drier air will punch into southeast KELOLAND to allow for partly sunny skies. \nThe partly sunny skies will help redevelop showers and storms in Iowa and Minnesota after 4:00. At the same, widespread rain will continue in central and northern KELOLAND. Rain amounts of a half to full inch will be common. \nThe rain will be east of KELOLAND for the weekend with seasonal temperatures as highs will be in the 50s. \nWe'll also be watching colder weather next, possibly the coolest shot of air of the season so far.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T15:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T15:33:43.553+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
