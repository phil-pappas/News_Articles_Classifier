Speaking of high-end youngsters — always the wild-cards in any fantasy pool — a few of these forwards will open the season on the wing such as Sam Bennett, Teuvo Teravainen, Brayden Schenn and Alex Galchenyuk, but could well finish at centre and bear watching. And of course there is the annual (ranging to daily) guessing game of who plays left wing alongside the superstars, which affects their draft day status. Who joins Ryan Getzlaf and Corey Perry on the Ducks’ top line, has been a revolving door for years and we expect it will continue that way for a while yet. The Blackhawks have a few promising youngsters vying to open the season with either Patrick Kane or the Jonathan Toews/Marian Hossa duo while the coveted LW slot with Sidney Crosby and Phil Kessel may still be up for grabs. We’ll have updates on these key situations, and others, in Sunday’s weekly Fantasy Fare column. And once again, these are not strict rankings. The further down the lists you go, any player within five up or down of the guy you are looking at stands just as good a chance of making his expected fantasy impact. CENTRES Sidney Crosby PIT Kessel gives him arguably the most skilled winger he’s ever worked with on Pens John Tavares NYI If all goes right, could threaten 100 points for first time in his career Evgeni Malkin PIT Has missed at least 13 games in five of his past six seasons. Tyler Seguin DAL An elite offensive force, but won’t help out much elsewhere Steven Stamkos TB Goals total (43) will over-value him on draft day as assists, points dipped Ryan Getzlaf ANA Primo playmaker went 4-13-17 in 11 games with Perry hurt last December Claude Giroux PHL Led the NHL with 37 points on the power-play last season Ryan Johansen CLB Joined NHL’s elite centres last year and should remain there for years Logan Couture SJ The transition from Thornton to Couture as Sharks go-to guy continues Joe Pavelski SJ Has topped 70 points in each of the past two years. Should make it three Tyler Johnson TB Can’t expect the Triplets to duplicate last year’s numbers, can we? Nathan McKinnon COL Rookie-year magic disappeared, but that doesn’t mean it can’t return Jonathan Toews CHI Always a 30-40-70 threat with dazzling plus-minus figures every year Anze Kopitar LA The presence of Lucic just might give him more room to manoeuvre Connor McDavid EDM First-round fantasy pick? Next year. This year? Don’t let him slip past the third Henrik Zetterberg DET Even at 34 and an injury risk, likely still good for 60-plus points Patrice Bergeron BOS Faceoffs and 55 points aside, his plus-2 last year was a major disappointment David Backes STL Multi-category contributor may wind up out of Blues top six for balance purposes Sean Monahan CGY Rising star good for another 30-30 year centring one of league’s top lines Nicklas Backstrom WAS Still worth a high pick as long as they keep him alongside Ovechkin Kyle Turris OTT Finally playing like a No. 3 overall pick, showing great chemistry with Stone Ryan Nugent-Hopkins EDM McDavid’s arrival will cut into his power-play time Nick Bjugstad FLA Should be about ready to fully harness his size and skill Jack Eichel BUF If McDavid is a fantasy second-rounder, Eichel might be a steal in the fourth Derek Stepan NYR Had 25 points in first 23 games after returning from broken leg Eric Staal CAR Numbers dropping but still young enough, at almost 31, to bounce back Matt Duchene COL Big sleeper. His disappointing 55 points last year don’t reflect his skill level Joe Thornton SJ We’ve given up predicting when age will catch up to veteran assist machine Jason Spezza DAL Having a legitimate top-flight winger in Sharp should help him Bryan Little WPG Has a good thing going with Ladd and Wheels and could threaten 60 points Henrik Sedin VAN Rediscovered his elite playmaking touch last season Paul Stastny STL May be returned to top-six role after slow start dropped him out it last year Mark Scheifele WPG Second half last season showed he’s on the cusp of big things Derick Brassard NYR Finally blossomed with a 60-point season as a setup guy for Nash Adam Henrique NJ After back-to-back 43-point years, healthy cast around him should aid a rebound David Krejci BOS Injuries and dropping plus-minus dropping him out of early rounds Mikael Granlund MIN Outstanding setup man back working top line with Parise Mika Zibanejad OTT Has upped offensive totals each of past three years, eyeing 50+ Ryan O’Reilly BUF Will centre top line or switch to RW with Eichel. Both are good situations Nazem Kadri TOR Has the tools, but if Mike Babcock can’t assemble the pieces here, who can?

No one figured it would happen this fast Ryan Callahan TB Tied his career-high with 54 points and likely to return as Stamkos’ RW Johnny Gaudreau CGY Forget the points. From this corner, he’s NHL’s most fun player to watch Nikita Kucherov TB Somehow managed 28 goals, 64 points with under 15 minutes of ice time a game T.J. Oshie WAS Fantasy stock takes a leap if, as anticipated, he lands on top line with Ovie, Backstrom Taylor Hall EDM Injury-shortened season will knock McDavid’s LW down a round or two on draft day Mark Stone OTT Career took off after joining Turris line, going 18-29-47 in 46 post-New Year’s games Wayne Simmonds PHL Has twice fallen just shy of 30 goals, but PIMs dropped off by 40 last year Gabriel Landeskog COL Like many of his Avs teammates, it’s best to just forget last season Chris Kreider NYR One of these years, he’s going to put it all together and reach 70 points Tyler Ennis BUF Will likely land with either Eichel or O’Reilly and rack up maybe 65 points Alexander Steen STL Could be in for a fine season if he stays with Backes, Tarasenko Scott Hartnell CLB Scored 14 goals in his last 20 games and hit 100 PIMs on the final night Marian Hossa CHI No reason why he can’t make it three 60-plus point seasons in a row, even at 36 Daniel Sedin VAN Weird thing about his bounce-back season was that he finished third in NHL in assists Andrew Ladd WPG A good bet for 70 points for the first time, plus plenty of hits and PIMs Brayden Schenn PHL May start at LW on top line, but averaged fewer than two shots a game James van Riemsdyk TOR Can’t see him matching last year’s points without Kessel as a linemate Tomas Tatar DET Skilled and hard-working and led the Wings with 29 goals in just his second season Jaden Schwartz STL Highly skilled in his own right, but fantasy owners hope he gets back with Tarasenko Radim Vrbata VAN Playing RW on the Sedins line still has its advantages Kyle Okposo NYI Sticking on the Tavares line for a full season would help, but isn’t a sure thing Jonathan Huberdeau FLA Went 6-15-21 in 20 games after Jagr’s arrival. Marian Gaborik LA Returns to RW where he has been at his most productive Brandon Saad CLB Talented ex-Hawk should be a perfect fit with Johansen and Foligno Brad Marchand BOS Dropped to plus-5 after averaging plus-29 the previous four years Gustav Nyquist DET Minus-11 wasn’t good, but capable of a 30-30-60 year in second full season Tomas Plekanec MON Career was revitalized when he was placed with Galchenyuk and Gallagher Ondrej Palat TB Playmaking skills will work either back on the Triplets line or with Stamkos Jeff Carter LA Proposed move to C could help his point totals but hurt his plus-minus 833 Bobby Ryan OTT Best days behind him, but will play on a solid second line and on power-play Patrick Marleau SJ Goals dropped from 33 to 19 and, at 36 years of age, it’ll be tough to recover. Jaromir Jagr FLA How long can he continue to defy Father Time? Should be good for this year Mathieu Perreault WPG Might have 60 points in him, if only he could keep from getting hurt Valeri Nichushkin DAL Should be a nice sleeper back on top line after missing most of last year David Perron PIT Bump him up if he secures spot on the top line with Crosby and Kessel Tyler Toffoli LA Should benefit greatly from Pearson’s return and That 70s Line re-united Jordan Eberle EDM Stock fades with memory of 76-point 2nd season. Hurt his shoulder Tuesday Milan Lucic LA Ex-Bruin looks already like he’ll be riding shotgun for Kopitar and Gaborik Brendan Gallagher MON If only his feistiness translated into more than 31 PIMs Pavel Datsyuk DET Still an elite performer but, sadly, injuries have become a growing factor Jakob Silfverberg ANA Game took a giant leap in playoffs with 18 points in 16 games Jiri Hudler CGY His 31 goals aided by an unrealistically high 19.6 shooting percentage Anders Lee NYI Seems locked in as Tavares’ LW following 25-goal rookie season Marko Dano CHI Has already looked comfortable, and dangerous, with Toews and Hossa Mats Zuccarello NYR Last year was a step back, but has meshed well with Nash and Brassard Thomas Vanek MIN Could open the season as a third-liner, but should see PP time Reilly Smith FLA Looking to bounce back in Florida playing on second line with Bjugstad Mikkel Boedker ARZ Lack of high-end linemates again will blunt any possible notion of a breakout Matt Moulson BUF Could pile up some points trailing in behind the speedy Eichel and Gionta Steve Downie PIT League penalty leader also chipped in nicely with 14 goals, 28 points Colin Wilson NAS Team-leading plus-19 elevates him slightly from rest of Preds’ second-liners Ryan Strome NYI It’ll help if he sticks with Tavares, but it’s not essential to his fantasy value Alex Galchenyuk MON He’ll be the No. 1 centre soon enough if the scrutiny doesn’t get to him Chris Kunitz PIT He’s not guaranteed to be Crosby’s left winger and could wind up on third line RELIABLE 40-POINTERS: Jarome Iginla COL, Loui Eriksson BOS, Kris Versteeg CAR, Mike Hoffman OTT, Alex Tanguay COL, Troy Brouwer STL, Jason Pominville MIN, Brock Nelson NYI, Ryan Callahan TB, Valtteri Filppula TB, Brandon Dubinsky CLB, Antoine Vermette ARZ, Craig Smith NAS, ON THE WAY UP: Johan Larsson BUF, Artemy Panarin CHI, David Pastrnak BOS, Elias Lindholm CAR, Jason Zucker MIN, Nail Yakupov EDM, Kevin Hayes NYR, Sergei Plotnikov PIT, Chris Stewart ANA, Teemu Pulkkinen DET, Thomas Hertl SJ, Calle Jarnkrok NAS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T19:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T01:59:29.368+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
