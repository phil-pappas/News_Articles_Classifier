Poor Michigan sports TV crew \nIt's every TV sports reporter's worst nightmare: You have to shoot a live shot recapping a college football game, but in an era night games and TV timeouts, sometimes that means missing the final few plays of a game. \nWZZM 13 in Grand Rapids, Michigan, had to do just that from Ann Arbor, Michigan, on Saturday night. Sports reporter Jamal Spencer got set up with his live shot and even did a substantial bit of homework to bring the news to his viewers just seconds after the ending of a rivalry game between Michigan and Michigan State. \nHe only got one thing wrong: The final score  after the Spartans returned a botched punt for a touchdown to win 27-23 with no time on the clock, presumably after Spencer had left to do his live shot outside the stadium. \nHere's the broadcast, captured on the Internet by SB Nation . \nSpencer, to his credit, owned up to the mistake and treated it like a professional. Not the first time I've made a mistake in my career and it won't be the last. Gotta take the bad with the good < a href=\"https://t.co/N4vxwJRgyM\">https://t.co/N4vxwJRgyM — Jamal Spencer (@JamalWZZM13) \n\nLive television is hard, folks. \n. @CoachJim4UM r u ok — Fake Bo Pelini (@FauxPelini) \n\nCincinnati took a 24-17 lead over BYU into the fourth quarter Friday night, and the Bearcats nearly walked out of Provo with a win before the Cougars rallied with 21 unanswered points in the final period. \nAfter his team lost 38-24 at BYU, Cincinnati wide receiver Max Morrison tweeted out a witty response about a hit by BYU defensive back Kai Nacua that he later regretted. \nCincinnati WR Max Morrison was slightly embarrassed about losing to BYU tonight pic.twitter.com/9XvqnbA3SQ — Barstool Sports (@barstoolsports) \n\nMorrison had fun with fans on Twitter for the remark, for which he also apologized. Nacua hasn't responded from his own Twitter account, but he may not need to after outside lineba \n@gregwrubell I thought I would make sure the world knows that I love #MtDew ! @KaiNacua_23 does as well \n\n\nAfter a monstrous three-run homer helped the Blue Jays clinch a spot in the American League Championship Series, big-time slugger and local Toronto legend Jose Bautista could've taken any ride home that he wanted — whether his or a fan's. \nSo what was the hero's welcome of postgame transportation?
