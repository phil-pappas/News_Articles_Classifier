He made a pretty turnaround fade away from 18 feet with 1.9 seconds remaining in the first half. \nIn his first game since surgery, Anthony shot 8 of 10 for 17 points against Bauru, a Brazilian team. \nWashington's Bradley Beal provided the most memorable shot of the evening with a driving dunk midway in the third quarter. Beal leaped, and the ball hit the Knicks' Kristaps Porzingis in his shoulder on the way down. \nPorzingis, a 7-foot-3 Latvian taken fourth overall in the draft, had nine points and 10 rebounds. \nNew York's Derrick Williams had 23 points - 13 in the fourth quarter. \nMarcin Gortat led the Wizards with 15.
