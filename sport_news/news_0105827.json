(AP) - A new poll shows that 50 percent of New Hampshire residents surveyed think U.S. Rep. Frank Guinta should resign amid his campaign finance troubles and 4 percent said they would back his re-election bid next year.\nThe Republican said the $355,000 he reported loaning himself for his 2010 campaign was his because for years he contributed to and managed a \"family pot\" of money. The Federal Election Commission concluded Guinta broke the law by accepting donations above the legal limit from his parents and fined him.\nIn a WMUR Granite State Poll released Thursday, 56 percent said they'd vote for someone else if Guinta's on the ballot. Twenty-four percent were unsure.\nThe telephone poll of 286 First District residents was conducted by the UNH Survey Center from Sept. 24-Oct. 2, with a sampling margin of error of plus or minus 5.8 percentage points.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T07:46:05.033+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
