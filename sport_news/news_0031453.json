A Supreme Court news release Friday says an appeal to the high court was denied.\nTwo people had filed a challenge saying Crawford failed to file a 2012 tax return and a judge ruled in their favor. But the 4th Circuit reversed the ruling and dismissed the appeal on procedural issues. Those issues stemmed from a mistake in the original challenge: The candidate was misidentified as Raymond instead of Ray Crawford.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
