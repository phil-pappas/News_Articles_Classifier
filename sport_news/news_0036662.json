If it is me...\n\"I think what Uchimura has done is very amazing and I don’t think anyone could do what he does.\"\nDespite his diminutive 1.62-metre frame, Uchimura is regarded as a gymnastics goliath as he has turned countless rivals into emotional wrecks in his never-ending search for perfection.\n\"A lot of foreign athletes say I perform like a machine. I take that as a compliment,\" said the 26-year-old, whose haul of 16 world medals includes seven golds.\n\"To me, moves and performances that are mechanical are perfect. A robot can be more accurate and exact in movement than a human can every time.\"\nDespite all his success, there is one gold that has eluded the man known as \"Supermura\" over and over again -- a coveted team title for Japan at a global meet.\nThe collective strength of China means that since 1994, Chinese men have won 10 of 11 world titles and three of the five Olympic golds on offer.\nJapan did win the Olympic title in Athens in 2004 but that was in the pre-Uchimura era.\nThe Asian powerhouses have been engaged in a mighty tug of war since 2007, with China trumping Japan every time, and last year's world title was decided by just one-tenth of a point.\n\"All I'm looking at is winning team gold,\" added Uchimura, who is hoping to help Japan triumph in a world team event for the first time in 37 years.\nIn the women's competition, Biles and her American team mates -- who include Olympic all-around champion Gabby Douglas -- are targeting a hat-trick of world titles as countries vie for a top-eight finish in order to secure an automatic berth into the 2016 Olympics.\nHosts Britain will be spearheaded by Claudia Fragapane as she returns to the arena where she won four Commonwealth golds in 2014.\n(Reporting by Pritha Sarkar, editing by Neville Dalton)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T19:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T18:16:13.736+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
