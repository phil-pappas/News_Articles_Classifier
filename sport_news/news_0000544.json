It seemed a fair argument, given Bryant's status as the team's second most important player.\nWell, there was nothing last-minute about the Cowboys' 20-10 dismantling of the Eagles on Sunday, a game that had the local supporters booing the home product from the second quarter until they made their early exits in the fourth.\nBut, again, the news was muted, this time by the broken left clavicle Tony Romo suffered in the third quarter. He missed 10 weeks with the same injury in 2010, but there was no reason for him to rush back at the end of a dying season.\nEight games is a fair guess, and it's about the average, but it's exactly that. A guess.\nNo Romo, no Dez and ... no lack of confidence going forward?\n\"The NFL really is about adversity in general,\" Romo said. \"The job for our football team is to just find ways to win, and I think we have guys in the room who can do that.\"\nThat group will now be led by Brandon Weeden, who produced a 42-yard touchdown pass to Terrance Williams with 4:13 to play -- the first offensive touchdown for either side in a game dominated by the defense the Cowboys threw at the Eagles and the flags the officials fired at the Cowboys (18).\nI asked coach Jason Garrett why he believes Weeden's time in the spotlight will go better than last year's 28-17 loss to Arizona, his only start in place of Romo.\n\"It's his job. He's a good football player,\" Garrett said. \"I have a lot of confidence in Brandon, and more importantly, his teammates have a lot of confidence in Brandon.\"\nSo it's Weeden, not Tim Tebow, not RG3 via trade or any other nonsense that pops into people's heads.\nI would guess that my expectations for Weeden (while lower than Garrett's) are probably at the high end among media members. I've always thought judging him on one game last year against a Cardinals team that was leading the Seahawks in the NFC West in November was unfair.\nThe man does have experience, although that statement generally elicits jokes about his age since he made an extended try at a baseball career before playing football at Oklahoma State.\nOld?\nWeeden was once traded for Kevin Brown, the Rangers' first-round pick in 1986.\nOld?\nWeeden's last win as an NFL starting quarterback came in 2012 against Brady Quinn.\nYes, he will turn 32 during the Cowboys' bye week. But after two games this is very clearly a Cowboys team we thought it was (built around a powerful offensive line) and a team we thought it wasn't (strong and quick in the defensive front even without Greg Hardy, Rolando McClain and Randy Gregory).\nThat suggests that a quarterback of the \"bus driver\" variety can win games here. How many? No one can say that. Right now the Atlanta Falcons are 2-0 in their NFC East Victory Tour and surely relishing the chance to come to Dallas and face a team with no Dez and no Romo.\nWhat can Weeden do about that?\nHis 5-16 record as an NFL starter is misleading, at least for now. It includes 20 games with the Cleveland Browns. That hardly equates to the conditions he finds in Dallas.\n\"This is the first time I've had the same coordinator two years in a row since seventh grade,\" Weeden said. \"My comfort level is much higher than a year ago. I look forward to the challenge, but I feel terrible for Tony. I know how hard he has worked.\"\nHis alacrity will be tested for sure. The Cowboys failed to run the ball with any degree of dependability Sunday as Joseph Randle and Darren McFadden combined for less than a 3.0 average on 28 carries.\nThis was not particularly noticeable given that all eyes were on DeMarco Murray, and last year's NFL Offensive Player of the Year ran 13 times for 2 yards.\nNow a lot of that is on the Eagles' porous offensive line (he had eight carries for 9 yards against Atlanta), but Sean Lee and the Cowboys had their say in that lack of production as well.\nSo here they go, 2-0 and missing their most indispensable of players.\n\"You say are we equipped to win as easy as [with] Romo at quarterback? Of course not,\" owner Jerry Jones said. \"We're a different team. But we're a team that can win football games in the NFL without Romo.\"\nThey will win some games without him for sure. But if they're still trying to do it in November, the losses will be increasing, too.\nFollow Tim Cowlishaw on Twitter at @TimCowlishaw.\nDo you believe the Cowboys have a chance to make the playoffs without Tony Romo More on Tony Romo's injury, the Cowboys' win over the Eagles\nCowlishaw: Even without Tony Romo, Cowboys aren't dead yet\nGosselin: Without Romo, the 2015 hinges on Cowboys' defense\nCowboys QB Tony Romo injured; Jerry Jones: 'Just about as low as a crippled cricket's ass'\nEx-Longhorn, Eagles linebacker who injured Tony Romo: 'I just kind of attacked him'\nFox's Buck brings up Tim Tebow as Cowboys' QB; Jimmy Johnson predicts DeMarco's bad day\n5 thoughts: Critical division win tarnished after Tony Romo fractures clavicle\nBob Sturm: Catastrophic!
