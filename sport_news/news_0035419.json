I knew that carried a lot of responsibility.”’ \nCole said playing for Chuck Noll was a great experience. \n“It was just so exciting to be part of a team that played at such a high level each and every week,” Cole said. \nPrior to his arrival at YSU, Montgomery coached Ben Roethlisberger at Miami University. \n“I knew from day one that Ben just had it and felt deep down that he would be a very special player when it was all said and done,” Montgomery said. \nMembers of the winning Team Kernan Insurance squad included Mike Kernan, captain, J.P. Daliman, Harry Wollet, Gregg Strollo, Brian Canacci, Bill Durkin, Dant DeLisio and Matt Polkovitch. \nAs for my team with captain Dennis Miller at the control, we had 146 points and finished 14th. \nWe’ll just have to put our thinking caps on and try harder next year. \nWrite Vindicator correspondent Greg Gulas at sports@vindy.com .
