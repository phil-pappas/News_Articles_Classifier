With her new single, released in the early hours of Friday, British singer Adele announces that the four-year wait for the follow-up to her 30-million-selling 2011 album “21” will soon be over.\n“Hello” picks up the heartbreak theme of “21,” which documented a tumultuous breakup in her personal life. The new single echoes the reflective mood of the album’s closing track, the piano ballad-turned-anthem “Someone Like You” (as well as Lionel Richie’s huge 1984 hit, “Hello,” for that matter).\nLike that previous Adele hit, “Hello” begins with the singer contemplating a long-ago relationship that didn’t end well over stark piano chords. It slowly builds to something bigger but never quite trips into bombast -- Adele seems to have a knack for knowing just how far to push emotional buttons and then let up before things slide into melodramatic mush. Lyrics that work best when they zoom in on personal details match her combination of vocal power and restraint.\nAn accompanying black-and-white video suits the somber tone. The narrator’s apology includes a little dig at herself, an intimate aside between two people who once shared everything: “It’s so typical of me to talk about myself.” The song also suggests that while the singer is the one who initiated the breakup, she’s the one who can’t quite get over it. “I’m in California dreaming about who we used to be/ When we were younger and free,” she sings.\nAs Adele fills in the emotional colors of her past with this unnamed person, the well-paced arrangement builds without becoming overwhelming. Backing vocals provide percussive emphasis by emphasizing certain words and syllables, and a bell tolls. The song’s co-songwriter and producer, Greg Kurstin, is a new player on the singer’s team, rather than a holdover from “21.” Kurstin -- who has previously worked with Sia, Kelly Clarkson and Lily Allen, among others, -- doesn’t try to reinvent her sound. Indeed, this style of ballad is now an Adele signature and might soon become a cliche if she keeps returning to the formula. But for now, “Hello” serves as a bridge between the sound of “21” and what her next album, “25,” might bring when it is officially released Nov. 20.\nEven celebrities are crying over Adele's new song Adele had these celebrities at hello with the release of her first new song in three years. Stars like Katy Perry and Lena Dunham couldn't contain their excitement (or their tears) over this morning's unveiling of \"Hello,\" the first single off Adele's upcoming album, \"25.\" Hear that? It's the sound... Adele had these celebrities at hello with the release of her first new song in three years. Stars like Katy Perry and Lena Dunham couldn't contain their excitement (or their tears) over this morning's unveiling of \"Hello,\" the first single off Adele's upcoming album, \"25.\" Hear that? It's the sound... Read the story The singer, born Adele Laurie Blue Adkins 27 years ago in London, has offered hints as to what the song and the album are about in an open letter released a few days ago. If she had to label this album, Adele wrote, “I would call it a make-up record. I’m making up with myself. Making up for lost time. Making up for everything I ever did and never did.”\nWithin hours of its release, the single had already prompted speculation from Internet pundits about its subject, including the ex-lover dissected on “21” and her estranged father.\nIt was preceded by a teaser commercial during a break on the British television show “X Factor” last Sunday with a snippet of Adele’s vocal and thin white lyrics on a dark screen. As marketing campaigns go, it was underplayed. But, as “Hello” affirms, that’s likely the way Adele prefers it.\ngreg@gregkot.com\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-562a2018/turbine/ct-adele-new-song-hello-20151022", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-562a8889/turbine/ct-adele-hello-song-reactions-20151023"], "published": "2015-10-23T18:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T00:03:36.753+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
