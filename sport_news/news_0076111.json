Dodge County edges Cook to stay unbeaten By Jacob Dennis Special to The Times Valdosta Daily Times \nADEL — In a battle between two run-heavy offenses, Dodge County narrowly defeated Cook 21-14 Friday night at Cook Memorial Stadium to stay unbeaten and atop the Region 1-AAA, Subregion A standings. \nDespite passing for just two yards   31 in the game, the Indians (8-0, 5-0) used a stifling defense that is allowing just 9.5 points per game on the season to shut down the Cook’s talented rushing attack. \nThe game was tied on two separate occasions, once at 7-7 and again at 14-14, but Dodge never trailed en route to picking up a fifth region victory. \nCook (6-3, 4-2) drove into opposing territory on its first drive of the game, thanks in large part to running back Brandon Doe, but the team missed a 40-yard field goal and never had a legitimate chance to take the lead thereafter. \nDodge, which only attempted four passes the entire night, took an early lead in the first quarter on a Camron Young 7-yard run, but Cook quickly answered after a sack and fumble recovery. \nDoe, whose ability to make defenders miss has his name being mentioned as one of AAA’s best young backs, scored the Hornets’ opening touchdown on a 6-yard plunge just one play after the turnover. \nThe sophomore sensation finished the night with 25 carries for 83 yards and a touchdown, but gained just seven rushing yards in the second half as a stout Dodge defense keyed in on him. Doe also added two receptions for 29 yards. \nThe Hornets again drew level on the second play of the fourth quarter, but Dodge drove the length of the field to tack on the game-winning score by Young with just 2:17 to play. \nFor Dodge, Young had 11 carries for 86 yards and two touchdowns, while feature back Kyle Glover chipped in 101 yards on 17 carries and another score. \nCedarius Arnold added an efficient 63 yards on just seven carries for the Hornets. \nCook quarterback Connor Hilliard was injured on the team’s next-to-last series of the night and did not return, severely limiting the Hornets’ ability to throw the ball down the field late in the game. \nThe team had a chance to tie the game, but couldn’t go the required 74 yards in two minutes to do so. The Hornets did, however, drive near the red zone with seconds to play, but a desperation pass attempt was intercepted with no time remaining. \nThe Hornets outgained Dodge 221 to 208 in the on the ground and 56 to 31 in the air. \nDespite the loss, Cook exhibited the ability to play with one of the region’s top teams, a momentum boost that could prove beneficial for the Hornets come playoff time. Friday night’s game was the team’s last of the regular season with a region play-in game coming Nov. 7. \nDodge will conclude its quest for an unbeaten regular season next Friday night against Pierce County.
