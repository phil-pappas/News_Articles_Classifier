Following a pledge made on his behalf, ENEOS will donate $300 for each game Tazawa entered during the 2015 season to the Red Sox Foundation. During the season, he pitched 61 games and achieved 16 holds, both commendable stats. Tazawa finished the season with a 2-7 record and 4.14 ERA in those 61 appearances, striking out 56 and walking 13 in 58 innings.\nThe 61 games Tazawa entered racked up a donation of $18,300. However, ENEOS is providing an additional $1,700 bonus, bringing the total donation to $20,000.\n“We are happy to donate on behalf of Tazawa to the Red Sox Foundation charity, and in support of the people of the New England area,” said Motoshi Sunami, President and CEO of JX Nippon Oil & Energy, parent company of ENEOS. “Tazawa worked hard again this season and the donation we are providing was well-earned by his dedication as a player.”\n“I am happy to have played a part in this joint charity project with ENEOS, and am very pleased that we were able to send a donation to the Red Sox Foundation,” said Junichi Tazawa. “I hope that our contribution will continue to help our local communities, and looking forward to coming back stronger next season!”\n“The Red Sox Foundation would like to thank ENEOS and Mr. Tazawa for their very generous donation,” said Gena Borson, Executive Director of the Red Sox Foundation. “We’re extremely proud of our partnership with ENEOS this entire season.”\nENEOS is the Official Motor Oil of the Boston Red Sox.\nAbout the Red Sox Foundation\nThe official team charity of the Boston Red Sox, the Red Sox Foundation has distributed over $78 million to support programs serving children and families across New England.
