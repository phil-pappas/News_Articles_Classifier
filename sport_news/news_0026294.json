Currently, the division has only one investigator.\n“Additionally, more attorneys will share the difficult and emotional caseload of our domestic violence cases,” the news release said. The paralegal staff will double in size, and “our victim advocates will receive some reprieve from the difficulty of such emotional cases.”\nBrandenburg said in the news release that the felony domestic violence division has had a large increase in criminal trials and that vacancies have been difficult to fill since a state Supreme Court order this year aimed at speeding up criminal felony cases in Bernalillo County.\nAnn Badway, who was chief of the division from about 1995 to 2004, said the felony domestic violence division was created by then-District Attorney Bob Schwartz, who served eight years as DA, from 1988 to 1996.\n“It was almost like a pet project with him. And you know what? We did a heck of a job,” Badway said Wednesday. “I think having that specialized unit had an incredibly positive impact on the community. We educated whole lot of folks. It was a heck of a program.”\nBadway, who now lives in Florida, headed the division from 1996 to 2004. She said merging the two divisions would be beneficial for the sharing of the talent and expertise.\n“But I thought that when Bob Schwartz started that division, I thought it made a significant impact in the community’s awareness as well as law enforcement,” she said.\nShe said domestic violence cases are “very unique, and can be very challenging, and it took someone who really wanted to take on that challenge of that type of case.”\n“These are crimes that are often kept behind the closed front door of someone’s home,” Badway said.\nKayla Anderson, DA spokeswoman, said incoming domestic violence cases will be spread out among attorneys in the violent crimes division. The felony domestic violence division brought 249 indictments in the first nine months of this year, compared with 450 indictments in the violent crimes division for the same period.\nSince the merger, the violent crimes division has gone from 13 lawyers to 21.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T08:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T18:11:19.300+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
