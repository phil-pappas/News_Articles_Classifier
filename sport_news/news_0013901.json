Catholic senior Donald Stewart plans to take an official visit to Rutgers in December, following a visit to the school Saturday for the Michigan State game. \n\"I asked them if I could take my official Saturday, but they said that it would be better to come in December after the season,\" said Stewart, a member of the NJ.com Top 50 . \"That way we can sit down and talk to everybody instead of me just going to a game.\" \nThe 6-4, 195-pounder is trending as positively as any wide receiver in New Jersey, being named NJ.com Football Athlete of the Week , coming off a 35-yard game-winning touchdown reception against Don Bosco Prep (Ramsey, N.J.), Friday night. \n\"Usually, I play outside. And on the last play, coach (Greg) Russo (offensive coordinator) and coach (Arthur) Guess, my wide receivers coach, they put me in the slot,\" said Stewart. \"So (quarterback) Allan (Walters) came to the huddle. He said, 'Don, you're in the slot.' So I switched with my running back. I went in the slot and I had double coverage. I had Wankeith (Akin) press me and then I had Tyrone Hill over the top. And then Allan just made a perfect pass and the line gave him like three seconds to throw the ball. And I just had to come down with the catch and I did.\" \nAnd he made that catch, despite tight coverage. \n\"The defender was literally all over me,\" said Stewart. \"I had no idea he had such perfect coverage. Like I saw some pictures and I saw some videos and he was literally right on top of me. So I'm just glad I came down with the catch and all my hard work is finally paying off.\" \nStewart has been his team's go-to offensive threat all year, amassing 375 receiving yards and seven TDs on 21 grabs in five games. \nAnd he's not done yet. \n\"We're just trying to win from here on out,\" said Stewart. \"People have been coming at us, coming at my quarterback. So we're just trying to win games, man.\" \nAlthough Stewart has yet to officially release a list of finalists, he's already scheduled official visits to Michigan (for the Ohio State game) and Stanford (in January). \nSo just how much is Rutgers in the mix? \n\"I love Rutgers,\" said Stewart. \"My visit was absolutely wonderful. I spoke to literally everybody on the coaching staff. I felt very welcomed. I had a great night. \n\"They were always in the mix. They've been overlooked a little bit because of Michigan and their crazy fan base and then Stanford because they're out west, a Pac-12 school. But they've always been in the mix.\" \nWith Rutgers taking an official visit slot, Stewart is left with two openings. \nCoaches from various schools have requested video of his first five games of the 2015 season and could move in with an offer. \n\"I had a really good game last week, so a few coaches have been hitting me up like North Carolina State, Clemson, Mississippi State, (Ala)bama, Auburn, Virginia Tech, Baylor. So hopefully I can keep my grades up and we keep winning and we'll keep this thing rolling,\" said Stewart. \nThat said, Stewart's recruitment could extend deep into the Winter. \n\"(My dad) wants me to enjoy the process,\" he said. \"This process has allowed me to get closer with my brothers and my family because they come on recruiting visits with me. So I can spend more time with them and with my dad, as well.\" \nTodderick Hunt may be reached at thunt@njadvancemedia.com . Follow him on Twitter @TodderickHunt .
