Taiwan is a sixth claimant.\nIn the past, Chinese ships have harried fishing vessels from neighbouring countries for operating in contested waters in the area.\nVietnam has repeatedly accused China of ramming the craft as they ply local waters.\nChina has invited ASEAN defence ministers for a two-day informal summit in Beijing starting Thursday, according to the country's defence ministry.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T15:14:02.518+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
