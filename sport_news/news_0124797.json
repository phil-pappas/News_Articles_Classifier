The junior from Jacksonville, Fla., was injured in the season opener against South Carolina. \n“After talking with my family and the UNC doctors, I have decided it is in my best interest to stop playing football,” says Jackson. “It was a difficult decision, and I appreciate the support of my teammates and coaches.” \nJackson was listed as the starting weakside linebacker entering the season and made four tackles against the Gamecocks. In 2014, he played in eight games as a reserve and had seven tackles. \nIn addition, redshirt freshman safety Cameron Albright will miss the remainder of the season with a knee injury. Dr. Alex Creighton performed microfracture surgery on his right knee at UNC Hospitals earlier this month. \nCopyright 2015 The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. All rights reserved.
