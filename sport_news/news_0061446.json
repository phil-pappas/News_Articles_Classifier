THE CANADIAN PRESS/Darryl Dyck Photograph by: DARRYL DYCK , THE CANADIAN PRESS \nVANCOUVER -- The hardest thing about making the National Hockey League at age 19, besides, you know, making the NHL at 19, is understanding the difference between being on the roster and playing in the league. \n“That’s probably the toughest part,” centre Bo Horvat said Saturday after the Vancouver Canucks finished their pre-season with a 3-2 overtime win against the Edmonton Oilers. “You work so hard in the pre-season, and it’s an honour to make the opening-day roster. But there’s still only nine games for you and you have to perform or you’ll be right back down in junior.” \nHorvat knows because he made the Canucks a year ago at age 19, then passed the nine-game trial period the NHL allows junior players, then became a lineup regular and, in the second half of the season, one of Vancouver’s best players. \nHe was the first 19-year-old in a decade to play regularly for the Canucks. \nThis season, this week, the team is expected to start with two of them. Teenage forwards Jake Virtanen and Jared McCann did everything asked of them in the pre-season and have earned spots in the NHL, although the Canucks don’t have to declare their 23-man roster until the day before Wednesday’s season-opener in Calgary against the Flames. \nWe think the last time the Canucks had two teenagers in their lineup was 1988-89, when Rob Murphy played eight games on the same team as some rookie named Trevor Linden. \nAnd as if Virtanen and McCann making the Canucks isn’t extraordinary enough, the defence is expected to include another pure rookie, Ben Hutton. Hutton is 22, but may as well be 19. He spent the last three seasons at the University of Maine. Winger Sven Baertschi, who turns 23 today, will also have a key role in his first full NHL season. \nHorvat, who played his way to the Canucks’ second line as the best forward in the pre-season, turned 20 in April. \n“Nobody could actually (relate to) my situation last year; I was kind of all by myself,” Horvat recalled. “To have three guys in the same situation this year definitely helps them. They have each other to lean on, and they know what each other is thinking. And if they want to talk to me about it, I just went through it all last year. I think they’re going to be fine.” \nVirtanen always had a spot to claim, which he did. McCann, who thrived as the pre-season competition intensified, looks NHL-ready at least a year ahead of schedule. They were first-round picks — Virtanen sixth, McCann 24th — in 2014, Jim Benning’s first draft as Canuck general manager. \nSo determined is the staff to find a place for McCann on the top three lines, marquee off-season acquisition Brandon Sutter was shifted Saturday from centre to right wing and played with Daniel and Henrik Sedin. \nCoach Willie Desjardins liked the combination so much, he may go with it again on Wednesday. \n“Honestly, I really liked it,” he said. “I thought it was good. I thought they had some good chances. I’ll talk to them to see how they rated it and what they thought of it, but I thought there were some pretty good things out of it.” \nUsing Sutter on the wing allowed McCann to centre Alex Burrows and Jannik Hansen on the third line. It’s hard to imagine Sutter, who has played only centre in his seven NHL seasons, staying for long outside his natural position, especially since the Canucks will want to spread out the first nine games for Virtanen and McCann and not put too much pressure on them at the start. \nBut Saturday’s deployment showed what the Canucks think of McCann and Virtanen, who skated on the fourth line with winger Brandon Prust and centre Adam Cracknell, a journeyman 30-year-old who may be another new face in the lineup on Wednesday. \n“They’re looking at young guys and they’re really showing (well),” Abbotsford’s Virtanen said. “A lot of guys are playing hard. Ben Hutton and Jared are playing really strong out there each and every game, making plays happen. \n“I thought I played pretty well throughout the pre-season. Just my size — being physical out there, playing hard — obviously I think I’m ready but there’s still a lot of things to go here. I’ve just got to stay level-headed, keep playing hard and stay humble and hopefully I can be here.” \nMcCann said: “I set a goal in the summer to make this team and I came here and feel like I’ve shown myself. I’d be honoured to make this team. And whatever situation I’m put in, I’d do my best to try to help this team win.” \nHorvat’s advice to Virtanen and McCann: just enjoy playing and practising and being in the NHL, and try not to think about where you stand after each game. \n“Have fun with it,” Horvat said. “If you play the same game that got you this far, you’ll be playing well and they’ll notice.” \nThis youth movement is unprecedented in Canuck history. \nLinden, the president of hockey operations, and GM Benning vowed repeatedly that any young player who deserved to be on the team would be on the team. \nThe newcomers will not only infuse the locker-room with enthusiasm and energize veterans, they could redefine the team former coach John Tortorella famously called “stale” and inspire fans who have watched the Canucks erode since their run to the 2011 Stanley Cup Final. \n“As a team, we need that,” Danny Sedin said after scoring the 3-on-3 winner Saturday. “The organization, too. I think we’d heard that before, too, that there was a chance for young guys to make the team. And in the end, the spots weren’t really given to young guys. But this is not about giving them spots, either. They deserve these spots. I think it’s a great thing for our team.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T04:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T16:08:55.202+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
