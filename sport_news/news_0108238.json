By ROB OESTERLE - roesterle@shawmedia.com \nMORRIS – After winning the singles title at the Ottawa Sectional over the weekend, Morris junior Megan Davy qualified for the state tournament for the third straight year. Related Links \nHowever, with her individual title, along with the third-place singles finish of senior teammate Emma Dingbaum and the first-place doubles finish of senior Autumn See and junior Alyssa Larsen, she got something she had never seen in her lifetime. \nMorris won the sectional team title. \nThat hasn’t happened since 1997, according to the IHSA record book. \n“They said it was the first time since 1997 that we won a sectional title,” Davy said. “I wasn’t even born then. I was born in 1999. I told my sister [Monica, who graduated in the spring] and she was surprised. She was like, ‘Sure, you wait until I am gone until we win a sectional.’ \n“It was pretty exciting to do that. This year, I hope the third time is the charm. I am looking forward to it and going into every match with a mindset of playing to win.” \nDavy went 0-2 at the state meet as a freshman and was 1-2 last year. She enters this weekend’s play with a 23-6 record. \n“We hope she can keep progressing,” said coach Samantha Shannon, who is in her first year as head coach. “Freshman year, we were just happy for her to be there, then she got one win last year. We would like to keep improving, and she has this year, I think. Her freshman year, she played Whitney Lewis of Mendota and lost to her in three sets. Last year, she beat her in three sets and this year, she beat her 6-2, 6-3 in the sectional championship match.” \nDingbaum has worked through an ankle injury that still isn’t 100 percent and finished third at the sectional to earn a state berth. \nShe is 12-7 on the season heading into state play. \n“One of my goals this year was to get to state,” the senior left-hander said. “I am very excited to make it. I had a pretty tough draw in the sectional, so I know I earned my way there. Making state has been a goal since sophomore year, so I am excited to end my high school career at state.” \n“Emma played the No. 3 seed and No. 5 seed at sectionals,” Shannon said. “We are really happy that she was able to make it. Playing kind of in the shadow of someone as good as Meghan can be tough, so it’s nice to see Emma get her own chance to shine.” \nSee and Larsen also have had a strong season, entering the state tournament with a record of 19-10. \nThey won a pair of three-set matches on Saturday at the sectional to capture the sectional title. \n“It’s exciting,” See said about winning the sectional title. “This is our last hurrah as a doubles team, so it’s fun to go out on top and play together at state. We’ve been playing together for two years, so we are pretty much one unit.” \n“We communicate on the court pretty well,” Larsen said. “There isn’t much we don’t know about each other out there” \nShannon is looking forward to taking the group of four to the state meet. \n“It’s going to be fun,” she said. “We will go up Wednesday night after school... It will be fun for all of them to see competition from all over the state and see the level of tennis that’s played. Meghan and Emma, in a lot of their matches, weren’t really challenged that much, but I think they will be up to the challenge they will see up there. And Autumn and Alyssa have already been challenged and met the challenge in the sectional, so I hope they can keep that going. \n“We’re excited to be taking a group of four.” \nAlso competing at the state tournament will be Coal City singles player Carly McGinn and the Coaler doubles team of Katie Albrecht and Katie McGinn.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T05:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T10:53:09.975+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
