City leaders haven't raised meter rates since 2009, when hourly charges rose from $1.25 to $1.60.\nThe increase was recommended by a city panel tasked with studying central city parking. A subcommittee of 12 members voted 10 to 2 in favor of the $2 hourly rate.\nThe City Council is scheduled to review the proposal Dec. 2 at 2 p.m. If approved, the new rates would go into effect in 2016.\nAs envisioned, the $2 rates would only apply to downtown-area parking meters. The downtown zone includes the area bound by Interstate 405, but it also includes the South Waterfront District and parts of Goose Hollow.\nOfficials hope to justify the increase because parking experts say there isn't enough on-street parking turnover.\nGenerally, if more than 85 percent of on-street parking stalls are full, prices are too low, according to a presentation the City Council received last week. The presentation stated that parking exceeds that 85 percent target \"for several hours each day.\"\nBut a 2014 study found that the city's downtown parking stalls exceeded 85 percent just once during the daytime , when 90 percent of stalls were full at 1 p.m. weekdays.\nThe study also indicated that 87 percent of stalls were full at 7 p.m., the same time the city stops charging hourly rates for parking.\nStaff for the Portland Bureau of Transportation expect that raising parking rates could create negative perceptions about shopping downtown.\nBut, according to their presentation, higher parking rates would create more turnover – making it easier to find parking – and thus \"improve the parking experience.\"\nSandra McDonough, president of the Portland Business Alliance, said her group has been talking to city officials about a $2 hourly rate but hasn't yet taken a formal position on the increase.\nMessages left for the Portland Bureau of Transportation and Commissioner Steve Novick, who oversees the bureau, weren't immediately returned Tuesday.\nIn May, Transportation Director Leah Treat said a rate-hike proposal would likely move forward by year's end.\n-- Brad Schmidt\nbschmidt@oregonian.com\n503-294-7628\n@cityhallwatch", "external_links": ["https://www.portlandoregon.gov/transportation/article/547325", "https://www.portlandoregon.gov/transportation/67883"], "published": "2015-10-14T01:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T06:05:41.818+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
