In the words of Thompson Speedway Motorsports Park general manager Josh Vanada, “it’s a Herculean effort.” The 75th anniversary celebration of the facility concludes this weekend with the World Series of Speedway Racing. The event begins today and ends late Sunday afternoon with a whole lot of racing in between. Fifteen divisions will race with 14 crowning division or series champions. “It’s a lot like a puzzle with lots of small pieces; you have to fit it all together and it’s beautiful in the end,” Vanada said. The biggest title on the line is in the NASCAR Whelen Modified Tour championship. Doug Coby and Ryan Preece come into the 150-lap finale tied with 565 points apiece with Woody Pitkat in hot pursuit just four points behind. Should it end in a tie, Coby has the tiebreaker with six victories this season over Preece’s four and one for Pitkat. Coby is chasing history. He’s hoping to become the first driver since Tony Hirschman in 2004-05 to win back-to-back season titles and just the fourth driver to do it in Modified Tour history. Coby also has the chance to become just the third driver to earn three or more championships and just the third — alongside Steve Park (1996) and Mike Stefanik (1998) — to complete a season sweep at Thompson. Coby has won all three races at the 5/8th–mile oval this season. “Maybe it’s a mental advantage, but maybe not truthful,” Coby said of his dominance at Thompson this season. “Those guys are really fast there and I’m not thinking we’re going there thinking we have this in the bag. We have to be on our game and we have been so far, but certainly Woody has been extraordinarily fast there. Even though we have won, he has been right with us for two of those three wins. Ryan won the race last year and he’s going to come in well prepared. I know everyone is going to be talking about that, but I’m not taking it for granted.” Coby has led 340 of the 425 laps (80 percent) run at Thompson this season. With the points battle being so close, the margin could come down to mere points. Preece said that was why he fought so hard to lead laps, 96 of them, at Stafford Speedway two weeks ago. A point is awarded for each lap led and an extra one for most laps led, plus three more for winning. “(Thompson) seems to be the track that we’re struggling with a little bit, but I have all the faith in the world in (crew chief) Tommy (Grasso). I know we’re going to do everything we can to show up and be one of the fastest cars there. It’s not about finishing anymore. It’s about winning that race,” Preece said. Page 2 of 2 - Considering how close the championship battle is, the champion may have to win Sunday’s finale to take the crown. The only Tour champion to do that was Ted Christopher in 2008. The Late Model championship will be settled tonight with a 25-lap feature. Brian Tagg holds a seven-point advantage over Keith Rocco. Tagg, who has driven a Thompson and Sunoco Modified, is in his first year running a Late Model. “Rocco has the advantage for being there before, but circumstances dictate everything,” Tagg said in a press release. “My attitude is the same. Just get out there and keep going. Keep your head down and focus on us.” Four other local track champions also will be crowned. On Sunday, it will be a battle of two veterans. Scott Sundeen holds a two-point lead over Moosup’s Larry Barnett in the Limited Sportsman division. “I’m sure it will be fun,” said Sundeen in a press release. “It’s always a rough race and if it’s anything like last year it is going to be a war out there. I’m not worried about Larry; whatever happens, happens.” Pitkat leads Rocco by 14 points and Preece by 18 in the Sunoco Modifieds. Dave Trudeau is seeking his first career Mini Stock crown and goes into the finale 30 points up on Scott Michalski. Other races to watch include the 100-lap American Canadian Tour final on Saturday. It will mark the first time the touring series has raced at Thompson in 23 years. The Modified Racing Series also will hold its 50-lap finale on Saturday. “It’s bittersweet,” Vanada admitted. “You are up on this monumental high all weekend, and when it’s over, you’re left a little down because it’s the last event of the season. But in a couple of weeks, we’ll start working on 2016.” By Marc Allard The Bulletin The Bulletin By Marc Allard The Bulletin Posted Oct. 15, 2015 at 7:47 PM Updated at 10:34 PM", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T06:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T13:15:10.396+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
