Sarpong has insisted that Ghana left back Baba Rahman should apply for loan from Chelsea to maintain his sharpness before he fizzles out. \nThe former national coach contends that insofar as Joe Mourinho has hinted that Baba is not ready for the English Premier League, there is no way he will use the Ghanaian. \nJ. E Sarpong therefore believes that the Black Stars left back must apply for a loan to leave the London club in order to get enough playing time for himself. \nBaba, 22, made a £22 million move to the English champions a few months ago but has been struggling to get a regular place in Mourinho's side. \nSpeaking in an interview with GHANAsocernet.com, J.E Sarpong said 'Baba should apply for loan to enable him go back to his former club to get his regular role. He will be rotten on the bench at Chelsea if he relies on Mourinho.' \n'For a coach to come out to say a player is not ready for the Premier League, then it tells you the player has no future with the club.' \n'Baba's managers should quickly do that for the boy before he ends up ruining his career,' Sarpong added. \nFor more Ghana football news visit www.ghanasoccernet.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-07T23:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T08:04:57.507+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
