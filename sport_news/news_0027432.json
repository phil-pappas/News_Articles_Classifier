More > KANSAS CITY, MO (KCTV/AP) - \nThe Kansas City Royals are going with a speedy roster for their AL Division Series against Houston, including pinch runner Terrance Gore at the expense of outfielder Jonny Gomes. \nThe Royals acquired Gomes from the Atlanta Braves late in the season. But while Gomes excels against left-handed pitchers, and the Astros are starting lefty Scott Kazmir on Friday, Kansas City manager Ned Yost elected to go with a more versatile lineup. \nThat means Gore, a career minor leaguer, gets another postseason call. He was part of the bunch that rolled to the World Series a year ago. \nThere were no other surprises on the Royals' 25-man roster Thursday. They kept 11 pitchers, including Yordano Ventura, Johnny Cueto and Edinson Volquez, who will start the first three games.
