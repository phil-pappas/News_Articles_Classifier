Raji got quicker to stay stronger at the line of scrimmage. He has returned to his disruptive ways after missing the 2014 season with a biceps injury. \nRaji, a graduate of Westwood High School, just might be better than ever back at nose tackle as part of the first line of a defense that has been strong against the run over the last few weeks. \n\"B.J. is very smart. He really studies the game and I think he’s probably in as good a shape as he’s been in,\" veteran defensive coordinator Dom Capers said. \nThe brawn still is there on Raji’s broad 6-foot-2 frame, listed at 337 pounds. Raji added yoga to his conditioning routine the last couple years with the hope of improving mobility. \nAdd Raji to a unit that includes high-energy end Mike Daniels and fellow run-stuffer Letroy Guion, and it’s no wonder the Packers have held starting backs to an average of 36 yards on 11 carries over the last three games. \n\"I think we’re trending in the right direction,\" Capers said. \nIt’s quite the contrast from this time last year. The Packers had trouble against the run until giving pass-rushing linebacker Clay Matthews more snaps at inside linebacker. The hope was that Matthews’ athleticism would help slow down running backs. \nThe move worked. Now when he is inside, Matthews gets the added benefit of having Daniels and long-time teammate Raji in front of him occupying offensive linemen. That often leaves Matthews clean of a blocker and able to get to the ball carrier. \n\"They’ve been fantastic. Obviously they do a great job of, as I said, keeping guys off me, but even more importantly ... when a play gets rolling, they make sure they stay in their gaps,\" Matthews said. \nStopping the run on early downs allows the Packers to go after quarterbacks during third-and-long situations. Green Bay has 17 sacks, tied for second in the league with today’s opponent, the St. Louis Rams. \n\"Oh, he definitely helps them,\" Rams coach Jeff Fisher said about Raji. \"They’re also really good at penetrating and tackles for losses in the run game. Which, second-and-12 and second-and-13 are hard to overcome there.\" \nThe Packers are tripping up backs even without two of their best run defenders. Inside linebacker Sam Barrington was lost for the year in the season opener with a right foot injury. Safety Morgan Burnett has missed three of four games with a calf injury. \nBut with Raji back, the Packers have more experience up the middle on early downs. Raji and Matthews were each drafted in the first round by Green Bay in 2009 and won the Super Bowl together five seasons ago. \n\"I can remember having a conversation with them after we drafted them about ‘You guys have to be the cornerstone here that we build on from a defensive standpoint,’ \" Capers said. © 2015 North Jersey Media Group Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T08:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T18:23:08.052+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
