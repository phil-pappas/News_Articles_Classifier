According to a police report obtained by FOX 8, the men told the victims to “get on the floor” and “hand over your money.” Bar patrons say the men leaped on top of the bar to get to the bartender. The report says they pushed her head with a gun and led her upstairs at gunpoint to the office.\nJust four days before that, two men hit Atchafalaya restaurant. In this case, the suspects didn’t say anything to the patrons. The police report says they simply handed over their belongings, willingly. A little more than a month before that, three men robbed Patois. Victims told police they said, “everyone get down.”\nAfter the robbery at Monkey Hill, Mayor Mitch Landrieu told FOX 8, “We have these three robberies that happened, that appear to me, although the lawyers won’t tell you that, they look like they are the same guys doing the same thing. But we don't know that for sure yet.”\nIn all three robberies, victims report seeing both black and silver handguns used by the suspects. But one interesting difference, unlike the other two, during the hold-up at Atchafalaya, the suspects never pointed a gun at any of the victims. In fact, a man who had his wallet stolen, which contained a military ID and a Tennessee conceal handgun license, told police that one suspect held the firearm secure, properly, and in a safe direction at all times.\nIn each of the three robberies, the suspects were dressed alike, wearing hoodies pulled tight, masks over their faces and gloves.\n\"Those similarities are sufficient enough to warrant additional federal resources, particularly at the investigative level. All of our federal agencies will now be involved,” U.S. Attorney Kenneth Polite said last month.\nNOPD Chief Michael Harrison says he’s not ready to say for certain that the incidents are connected, but with additional help investigating them, the department hopes to have the crimes solved soon.\nOne more interesting note found in the police reports: Cell phones were taken during the first hold-up at Patois. One of the phones was later tracked to a stolen car. In the subsequent two robberies, the suspects didn’t take anyone’s phones.\nCopyright 2015 WVUE.
