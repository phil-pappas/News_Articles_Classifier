Patrick Marleau, though, was already an old favorite. \nMarleau scored his first two goals of the season and Jones finished with 27 saves for his eighth career NHL shutout as the Sharks beat the Anaheim Ducks 2-0 for their fifth straight win in a home opener. \nWith brilliant goaltending coming from both Jones and counterpart Frederik Andersen, Marleau broke the stalemate with 39 seconds left in the second period. His shot and Logan Couture's shot from in close were both stopped by Andersen. But Marleau corralled the rebound off Couture's attempt and scored on the short side for what would be the winner.

As linemate Joel Ward peeled off, Marleau skated around the net and his wraparound attempt slipped through Andersen. \n\"I don't want to get caught up the ice,\" Ward said of the play. \"Next thing you know, our hands are up in the air and I was looking for water.\" \nJones had 24 saves through 40 minutes and was locked in a terrific goaltender duel with Andersen. The Ducks' starting goalie had 26 saves through two periods, then stopped Joe Thornton on a breakaway midway through the third. He finished with 42 saves. Advertisement \nMarleau, who had 19 goals last season, had reason to perhaps feel somewhat snakebit. He had six shots, including two misses, in the first two periods Saturday, and had five more shots in Wednesday's win over Los Angeles. \n\"This guy is one of the best players in the last 10 or 15 years,\" Sharks coach Pete DeBoer said. \"Not surprised. He's in great shape. I think last year was a bit of an aberration. He's come out with a lot of other guys to prove that.\" \nBoth goalies shined in the first period. Jones was tested early as Anaheim exerted some pressure with its forecheck, and he made a nifty toe save on a Jiri Sekac shot from between the circles with just under six minutes left. \nJones also made three saves on a Ducks power play after Joe Pavelski was sent off for boarding Rickard Rakell. \n\"He was fantastic, composed, gives you a real calm feeling back there,\" DeBoer said. \"Made some critical saves at key times. It was one of those games where both goalies were really good. It was almost who would blink first and thankfully our guy didn't.\" San Jose Sharks' Tomas Hertl mixes it up with Anaheim Ducks' Patrick Maroon as Maroon is held back by Tommy Wingels in the second period at SAP Center in San Jose, Calif., on Saturday, Oct. 10, 2015. (Jim Gensheimer/Bay Area News Group) ( Jim Gensheimer ) \nThe Ducks featured a slightly different look to start Saturday's game, as Corey Perry, Ryan Getzlaf and Ryan Kesler were all on different lines. The Sharks felt they had enough depth with their forward group and defensive pairs to match up, and now have two impressive wins to start the year. \nDeBoer said before Saturday's game that it was an opportunity to make a statement against a team favored to win the Pacific Division. \nPerhaps that's what the Sharks have done. \n\"I think a statement was made that the Sharks are back and we're for real this year,\" DeBoer said. \"We talked about it through training camp. We're only two games in but we played two tough teams. I think our game is getting better every day.\" San Jose Sharks' Joe Thornton battles with Anaheim Ducks' Simon Despres, at left, and Rickard Rakell in the first period at SAP Center in San Jose, Calif., on Saturday, Oct. 10, 2015. (Jim Gensheimer/Bay Area News Group) ( Jim Gensheimer ) \nThe Sharks unveiled their banner honoring original owner George Gund III at SAP Center. It hangs beside the team's Pacific Division champion banner for the 2001-02 season. Participants in the tribute included Gund's brother and former original Sharks co-owner Gordon Gund, son George Gund IV and George Kingston, the Sharks' first head coach. \nForward Ben Smith and defenseman Dylan DeMelo were the healthy scratches for the Sharks, who went with the same lineup as they did Wednesday in Los Angeles. Forward Melker Karlsson, remains out with a lower body injury, Barracuda coach Roy Sommer said Friday. Karlsson was sent down to the Barracuda at the end of training camp and is now day-to-day, according to Sommer.
