The Panthers have district games at Jensen Beach (2-1 in 14-6A), coming Friday, and home against Bayside (0-3), a week later. \nHeritage had to win without a pair of starting offensive linemen on Friday and struggled much of the night to move the ball. \n“We moved kids around. We kind of had a hodge-podge offensive line,” Ainsley said. “Everyone had to play both ways.” \nJust when it looked like the Panthers might be in trouble, one of those two-way players showed what speed can do. Josh Gaines broke free on the visitor sideline for a 64-yard touchdown run and a 21-13 Heritage lead at 8:17 of the third period.
