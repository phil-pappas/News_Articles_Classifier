ONE TO WATCH \nWashington State product Adam Johnson turned in a productive basketball weekend for the Concordia Thunder, ranking among the ACAC’s top five in points per game, field goal percentage, rebounds and defensive blocks. The Thunder split their opening two-game series with the Grande Prairie Wolves. NOTES \nTight battles for third place and the last playoff positions in ACAC men’s soccer loom this weekend, last one on the 2015 schedule. \nIn the Northern Division, the King’s Eagles and Concordia Thunder are bound for a head-to-head to a showdown. In addition to that vital confrontation, Concordia also faces the NAIT Ooks, who are locked safely into a playoff position behind the unbeaten and first-place Keyano Huskies, who will host the provincial finals and did not need such a lofty position to qualify. \nKeyano grabbed first place by defeating NAIT on the opening weekend of the season and held it from Day One. Their fierce regular-season rivalry ended with a 2-2 tie on the Ooks’ home field. So intense was the game that one of NAIT’s coaches was ejected. \nCarole Holt’s potent NAIT squad long ago wrapped up top spot in the women’s Northern Division. Concordia and the Grande Prairie Thunder are assured of the second and third spots in playoffs. In the south, Red Deer, Lethbridge and Medicine Hat have wrapped up women’s playoff positions. \nOnly two points separate the first-place Queens from second-place Lethbridge and Medicine Hat. Lethbridge meets the Rattlers in a game that could turn the playoff seeds upside down but will not change playoff teams. \n*** \nMacEwan Griffins centre Brett Njaa collected six points – three goals, three assists -- to lead all weekend point-getters in Alberta Colleges Athletic Conference hockey. \nAll of his scoring by the former Camrose Kodiaks forward was done against the Briercrest Clippers in a 12-1 victory that opened the way for a 5-1 triumph that created a two-game MacEwan sweep. \nGriffins head coach Bram Stephen described the Njaa, a 185-pound Saskatchewan product, as a playmaking centre –“really quite cerebral on the ice.” His scoring outbreak left him only one point away from the scoring lead. \n*** \nFirst-year setter/libero Cheyenne Zweifel was injured and left the floor during one of the NAIT Ooks’ successive losses in women’s volleyball games with the King’s Eagles. \nLoss of the Lloydminster product further reduced a roster that already was down to 11 student-athletes. Head coach Benj Heinrichs entered the season knowing that other ACAC teams would have more replacements available than his team would be carrying. \nExtent of her injury was not disclosed. Still wide gaps in high school football competitiveness By John Short , Edmonton Sun First posted: Tuesday, October 20, 2015 07:14 PM MDT | Updated: Tuesday, October 20, 2015 08:49 PM MDT \nTight and competitive games have been extremely rare in Metro Edmonton’s Tier I high school football program. \nFour serious examples of the imbalance were on display last week, when every Tier I (Carr Conference) game was decided by at least 30 points. \nMost overwhelming were the first-place — and undefeated — Bev Facey Falcons, who flattened the Austin O’Brien Crusaders 62-3, and the Spruce Grove Panthers, who destroyed the Ross Sheppard Thunderbirds 77-0. Elsewhere, the Paul Kane Blues whipped the Salisbury Sabres 36-6 in what passed as the week’s closest encounter and the Harry Ainlay Titans whipped the Jasper Place Thunderbirds 39-7. \nTwo years ago, when extended conversation (and sometimes confrontation) erased the long-standing separation in sports between Public and Catholic schools, there was an immediate suggestion that one-sided games would become a thing of the past. \nNow, saner heads prevail and there is common recognition that every change takes time Top stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T05:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T13:47:43.133+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
