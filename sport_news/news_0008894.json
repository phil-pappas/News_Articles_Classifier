Patrick Reed has clubs and will travel 1 / 5 Back to Gallery NAPA, Calif. (AP) — The Presidents Cup followed the end of a long season for Patrick Reed, and he still has a long way to go. Reed took up European Tour membership this year, and even with the Presidents Cup counting toward the minimum 13 events he must play, he is four short. That's why he is headed back to Asia next week to finish off his schedule. It starts with the Hong Kong Open. He also will be in Shanghai for two weeks (HSBC Champions, BMW Masters) ahead of the DP World Tour Championship in Dubai. But then he's still not done. Reed also said he would play the Hero World Challenge that Tiger Woods hosts in the Bahamas and the Franklin Templeton Shootout that Greg Norman hosts in Florida. \"It's tough,\" Reed said. \"After I play Tiger's and Shark Shootout, I'll be at 35 or 37 weeks of the year I'll be gone. It's a lot.\" It might have been easier except that Reed chose to withdraw from two European Tour events — the BMW PGA Championship at Wentworth and the Irish Open — in May when his wife's cousin died. Reed is the only American-born player who had his PGA Tour card first and chose to play both tours, and he said he still hasn't decided whether he would try it next year when the schedule will be even more packed because of the Olympics. But he had no intention of skipping the European Tour events in Asia. What does he get out of playing both tours? \"Learning how to travel a little bit better, especially with time-zone changes,\" Reed said. \"In the States, it's very easy. But when you're starting to fly to different countries, it becomes tough. Even though we had a direct flight here, a 14-hour flight, flying to Hong Kong is a long flight. Hong Kong to Malaysia is still a five-hour trip. Then Malaysia to China is not bad, but then China to Dubai is a long trip. \"You get in Monday afternoon and it seems like the weeks become a little shorter and you need to learn the golf course a lot quicker.\" ___ SPIETH'S PUTTING: According to the PGA Tour, Jordan Spieth led six putting categories (some of them are repetitive), including the tradition putts per round and overall putts. But one statistic remains hard to believe. Spieth made 27 percent of his putts between 15 feet and 25 feet. That's the highest percent since the tour began using lasers for its ShotLink scoring system. ___ MICKELSON'S WEEK: Phil Mickelson wasn't kidding when he said how much he enjoyed the team events. He sat out Saturday morning and was on the course early despite the threat of rain. Standing on the tee at the par-3 third hole, Lefty made sure every American player who walked by rubbed his belly for good luck. On the golf course, he turned in an unbeaten record (3-0-1) for the third time in the Presidents Cup. He also went 4-0-1 at Harding Park in 2009 and 3-0-2 at the Robert Trent Jones Golf Club in 2005. At the start of the week, Mickelson bit his tongue when asked if he wondered how many more times he would play in a Presidents Cup or Ryder Cup. This was his 21st consecutive team. \"Not yet,\" he said. \"I'm excited about the way the last few months have gone, which makes me very excited for the coming year and coming years.\" When the reporter mentioned it was a negative question, Mickelson seamlessly interrupted by saying, \"with a very positive answer.\" Mickelson headed home for what amounts to a three-month break before starting out in 2016. He is No. 5 in the Ryder Cup standings, mainly on the strength of his runner-up finish at the Masters, though the team effectively is decided by 2016 performances. \"I'm certainly looking forward to next year's Ryder Cup, as well, and I hope that I don't put the captain in a position where he has to pick me this time,\" Mickelson said. \"I hope that I will be able to make it on my own.\" Still, the question leaving South Korea was whether Mickelson did enough to warrant a captain's pick for the Ryder Cup if he is 30th in the standings as he was for this one? ___ SAWGRASS CHANGE?: PGA Tour commissioner Tim Finchem said it might not be long before The Players Championship has a reachable par — the 12th hole. But it wouldn't be a matter of just playing from a forward tee. \"If we move the tee up, we probably have more guys taking a shot at it,\" Finchem said. \"What we want is a combination of it being risk-reward and the way it's structured is it entices you to take a shot at it. If there's no downside to it, that raises the question, 'Do you really want to spend the energy?'\" ___ TOUGH TO WIN: Jordan Spieth and Jason Day each won five times last year, and combined to take three of the four majors. But there was more to the 2014-15 season that showed why it was tougher than ever. Throw out the opposite-field events, seven players won 17 times on the PGA Tour at a time when they were in the top 10 in the world ranking — Spieth and Day five times each, Rory McIlroy and Bubba Watson twice, once each for Jim Furyk, Justin Rose and Rickie Fowler. ___ DIVOTS: The LPGA Tour picked up some encouraging news in recent weeks when it announced that Volunteers of America has signed a three-year extension of its tournament in North Texas, and the final round of its season-ending CME Group Tour Championship in Naples, Florida, will be televised on network TV (ABC Sports). ... Australia Golf and the New South Wales government signed a new deal that will keep the Australian Open in Sydney for the next eight years. Jordan Spieth defends his title Nov. 26-29 at The Australian Golf Club. ... Because of his commitments in Europe and Asia, Anirban Lahiri likely won't make his PGA Tour member debut on the mainland until the CareerBuilder Challenge. \"I think it used to be called the Humana,\" he said. At that point, a few more experienced reporters filled him in on the Bob Hope Classic. ___ STAT OF THE WEEK: Freddie Jacobson did not have a three-putt green since the 17th hole of the second round of the Humana Challenge. ___ FINAL WORD I: \"My job this week is to get Chris Kirk excited.\" — Fred Couples, assistant captain at the Presidents Cup. ___ FINAL WORD II: \"That was for everybody who has never seen me fist-pump before.\" — Chris Kirk on his 15-foot birdie   the Presidents Cup.
