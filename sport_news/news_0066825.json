One lap before the end it seemed like everything went away from us. I was very unhappy with myself but in the end I thought ‘I gave it all’. \n“On the last lap when it came it was just amazing.” \nBottas was upset, declaring: “I got past Perez and approaching Turn Four someone hit me from behind. \n“It’s really disappointing because it's ruined my day. I guess he (Raikkonen) will get a penalty, but I would have to see the video It feels bad when it ends like this.” \nFelipe Massa secured some compensation for Williams by finishing fourth ahead of Raikkonen, local hero Daniil Kvyat of Red Bull and Felipe Nasr of Sauber. \nPastor Maldonado took eighth for Lotus and the two McLaren cars both claimed points with Jenson Button finishing ninth and Fernando Alonso 10th, having started on the back row of the grid. \nVettel's strong finish and Rosberg’s exit meant champions Mercedes were unable to wrap up another constructors title triumph. \nSainz, in his rookie season, started cleanly in his Toro Rosso, but in the midfield pack, Nico Hulkenberg in his Force India spun and tangled with Marcus Ericsson’s Sauber after hitting Verstappen’s Toro Rosso. \nThis resulted in a Safety Car signal that re-packed the field behind Rosberg as Russian President Vladimir Putin watched on from the stands. \nOn the restart, Rosberg reported his throttle pedal problem, Mercedes advising him to hit his brakes to fix it. \nThe German’s difficulties continued and he was soon passed by Hamilton with Rosberg twice went off circuit before heading back to the pits. \nBy lap seven, it was all over. “The pedal popped back completely, but it was still revving,” said Rosberg as the team informed Hamilton of his plight and instructed him to re-focus and win. \nOn his enhanced title prospects Hamilton said: “I never get to the point where I think it's done and dusted. The goal is still to make sure I have it when I cross the line in Abu Dhabi.” — AFP", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T17:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T18:15:04.414+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
