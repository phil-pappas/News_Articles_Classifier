TCU escaped another tough game against a Big 12 foe, but still remains a top 3 program nationally. More importantly, the pack is starting to get muddied in a competitive Big 12 conference.\nCheck out this week's installment of SportsDay's Big 12 power rankings:\n1. Baylor Bears / Previous ranking: 2nd / 5-0, 2-0 / Last week: 66-7 win over Kansas / This week: vs. West Virginia, 11 a.m. Saturday / Notable: The Bears blasted through their fifth straight foe this season, taking care of business against the lowly Kansas Jayhawks. Baylor scored 52 points in the first half of the road contest, before pulling its entire starting offense at the beginning of the second half. Even though its schedule has been suspect to start the year, Baylor has not won by less than four touchdowns this season against any foe this season.\n2. TCU Horned Frogs / Previous ranking: 1st / 6-0, 3-0 / Last week: 52-45 win over Kansas State / This week: vs. Iowa State, 6 p.m. Saturday / Notable: TCU was down by three scores heading into the second half and 11 points halfway through the fourth quarter before QB Trevone Boykin saved the Horned Frogs' season. Boykin ran for two TDs and found WR Josh Doctson for a score with 1:10 to win the game. However, this is the second game this season TCU needed a miracle at the last minute to pull off. Will Boykin's luck run out? Probably not this week against Iowa State.\n3. Oklahoma State Cowboys / Previous ranking: 4th / Last week: 33-26 win over West Virginia / This week: Bye / Notable: Oklahoma State has yet to look impressive against a Big 12 team, but the fact is it has tight wins over Kansas State, West Virginia and Texas. QB Mason Rudolph has looked inconsistent, but the defense has been incredibly disruptive. Defensive linemen Emmanuel Ogbah and Jimmy Bean have combined for 21.5 tackles for loss while spearing the Cowboy defense to a national-leading 51 TFLs. OSU plays Kansas this week, so it may be a little more time before we know what to think about the Cowboys.\n4. Oklahoma Sooners / Previous ranking: 3rd / Last week: 17-24 loss to Texas / This week: at Kansas State, 2:30 p.m. Saturday / Notable: Oklahoma moved up to No. 10 in the country last week, but were promptly smacked by hated rival Texas. New offensive coordinator Lincoln Riley has subjugated star running back Samaje Perine in the offense and it came back to bite them on Saturday. Oklahoma needs to find a consistent source of offense heading forward against some of the better defenses in the Big 12.\n5. Texas Tech Red Raiders / Previous ranking: 6th / Last week: 66-31 win over Iowa State / This week: at Kansas, 11 a.m. Saturday / Notable: Texas Tech picked up a dominant win over Iowa State last weekend and seems to be proving itself as a legitimately good team in the Big 12. QB Patrick Mahomes has averaged 377 yards per game this season and given this Red Raider team a whole new look. However, the defense will need to get better if Texas Tech wants to be a contender in the Big 12: it gives up 566.7 yards per game.\n6. Kansas State Wildcats / Previous ranking: 7th / Last week: 45-52 loss to TCU / This week: vs. Oklahoma, 2:30 p.m. Saturday / Notable: Kansas State coach Bill Snyder always seems to find a way, doesn't he? The Wildcats led over No. 3 TCU by three scores at halftime, but eventually gave it away at the end. It seems as though Snyder's offenses always seem to find a quarterback who can make plays with his feet and pass if need be. Joe Hubener seems to be that guy for the Kansas State offense. It will be interesting to see whether the Wildcats can keep up the success against other top opponents.\n7. Texas Longhorns / Previous ranking: 8th / Last week: 24-17 win over Oklahoma / This week: Bye / Notable: Texas picked up what could be a momentum-changing win over Oklahoma on Saturday. The Longhorns rushed for 313 yards on the day and forced Oklahoma to miss several tackles. Texas had been reeling the past few weeks, but the hard-nosed win might have bought Texas coach Charlie Strong some time to get things in order on the 40 acres.\n8. West Virginia Mountaineers / Previous ranking 5th / Last week: 26-33 loss to Oklahoma State / This week: at Baylor, 11 a.m. Saturday / Notable: West Virginia lost a tight overtime contest with Oklahoma State, but still fell a couple spots after other teams had better performances this week. West Virginia has shown flashes of elite play on both sides of the ball, but has struggled to keep any consistency going through Big 12 play. This has been one of the hardest teams in the Big 12 to play this season and it won't get any easier with games against No. 2 Baylor and No. 3 TCU next on the schedule.\n9. Iowa State Cyclones / Previous ranking: 9th / Last week: 31-66 loss to Texas Tech / This week: vs. TCU, 6 p.m. Saturday / Notable: Iowa State's offense has looked much improved this season and averaged 28.0 points per game. Freshman running back Mike Warren has combined for 546 yards and two touchdowns over the past three games and four wide receivers have over 175 receiving yards this season. Unfortunately, the defense has been just as bad. The Cyclones have given up 35.0 points per game and 66 to Texas Tech last week. Now that ISU has beaten Kansas, who else in the Big 12 can it beat?\n10. Kansas Jayhawks / Previous ranking: 10th / Last week: 7-66 loss to Baylor / This week: vs. Texas Tech, 11 a.m. Saturday / Notable: Kansas picked up one of its toughest losses in recent memory, a 66-7 beatdown at the hands of No. 3 Baylor. The Jayhawks have lost quarterbacks at a rate only matched by cross-state rival Kansas State, but have not found players who can contribute at a Big 12 level.\nOn Twitter:\n @ShehanJeyarajah", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/ShehanJeyarajah"], "published": "2015-10-14T06:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T18:18:21.508+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
