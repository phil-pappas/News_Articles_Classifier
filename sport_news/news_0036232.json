The rest were taken by ground transport. The extent of their injuries was not immediately known.\nHarborview Medical Center spokeswoman Susan Gregg said Thursday evening that three of the six injured arrived at the Seattle hospital for burn treatment, The Associated Press reported. Two men, both in their 40s, were in critical condition and in an intensive care unit. Another man, 58, was in satisfactory condition, Gregg said.\nHospital officials were also expecting two additional men from the explosion to arrive later, the AP reported.\nIt likely will be several days before officials establish the official cause of the blast, Stredwick said, but \"at this point we know it's not foul play or an act of terrorism.\"\n\"It's likely a piece of electrical equipment that has malfunctioned,\" he told The Oregonian/OregonLive on Thursday evening.\nThe blast did not compromise the structural integrity of the dam, which is more than 50 miles east of Yakima, Stredwick said. It was built in the 1950s.\nThe explosion caused some electrical power and cell phone outages in the rural, largely agricultural area, the AP reported, and 911 call service may have been out briefly.\nGrant PUD also operates the Wanapum Dam, which made news in 2014 after officials discovered a 61-foot crack . The utility employs 700 workers; Stredwick could not say how many work at the Priest Rapids Dam.\nInformation from The Associated Press was used in this report.\n-- Luke Hammill\nlhammill@oregonian.com\n503-294-4029\n@lucashammill", "external_links": ["http://www.grantpud.org/your-pud/what-we-do/power-generation/hydropower/priest-rapids-dam", "http://www.twitter.com/lucashammill"], "published": "2015-10-09T02:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T14:39:04.232+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
