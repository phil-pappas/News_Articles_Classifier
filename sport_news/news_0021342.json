USC visits Notre Dame on Sunday. \nHaden wasn't specific about the reasons for Sarkisian's absence, only saying the second-year coach is ''not healthy.'' \nSarkisian publicly apologized before the season after he showed up drunk at a pep rally and made a slurred public statement. \nSarkisian is 12-6 leading the talented Trojans, who lost 17-12 to unranked Washington last Thursday. \nHelton is in his second stint as USC's interim coach. He led the Trojans to a Las Vegas Bowl victory in 2013. \n---", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T00:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T00:51:18.128+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
