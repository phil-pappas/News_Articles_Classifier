Also, theyâ€™re difficult to use and made of breakable material. Most golfers have to hand carry and use more than one club when approaching the golf greens. This requires that at least one club be placed on the ground, so an inventor from Ogden, Utah, was inspired to design an effective solution.\nHe then created a prototype of the patent-pending GRIP DRY, an accessory that keeps a golf-club grip dry at all times by preventing it from contacting damp grass. This eliminates the need for bulky, inconvenient items that are already on the market. Easy to retrieve, use and store, the accessory also can be used for long-handled tools or gardening/landscaping equipment, or sports equipment with grips or handles. Logos can easily be printed on the surface of the device for promotions.\nThe original design was submitted to the Salt Lake City office of InventHelp. It is currently available for licensing or sale to manufacturers or marketers.
