On the season, she has three goals and an assist and ranks third on the team with seven total points.Senior Maggie Marks continues to play well in between the post since taking over for an injured Lauren Sestak. Marks has two victories on the year and has 25 saves on 73 shots faced.Incarnate Word (3-10-1, 1-4-1 SLC) dropped their lone conference match to Texas A&M-Corpus Christi last week, 1-0.The Cardinals offense is led by freshman Emani Stewart and junior Abigail Koenigs. The duo has combined for eight goals on the season. Freshman Sydney Huntsinger has taken over as the team’s starting goalkeeper and has allowed just one goal in 245 minutes of play.Following Friday’s match, the Cowgirls will continue their weekend homestand against Abilene Christian on Sunday with the match schedule for a one o’clock start.
