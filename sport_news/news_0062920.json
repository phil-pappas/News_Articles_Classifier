Argentina is aiming to advance to the final for the first time. \nMaradona was in the crowd at Leicester for Argentina's pool-stage win over Tonga last month. He went into the Pumas' changing room after the game, and sang and danced with players. \nAll content copyright ©2015 Pendleton Times-Post, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T16:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T16:12:29.212+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
