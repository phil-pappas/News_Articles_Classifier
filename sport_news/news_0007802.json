McDavid has five goals and eight points in eight games to start his NHL career. “He’s a special talent,” Kings defenseman Jake Muzzin said of the 18-year-old McDavid, the first overall pick in the draft last June. ... After three straight losses to open the season, the Kings appear to have gotten their act together during a four-game winning streak that included a 3-0 victory Friday over the Carolina Hurricanes. They were tied for the Pacific Division lead going into Saturday’s games around the league. Goaltender Jonathan Quick stopped 40 shots and recorded his 38th career shutout. Tyler Toffoli scored in the first and third periods for his team-leading fifth and sixth goals of the season. ... The Oilers are 3-5-0.\n–Elliott Teaford\nAdvertisement", "external_links": ["http://widgets.outbrain.com/outbrain.js"], "published": "2015-10-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T03:37:28.142+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
