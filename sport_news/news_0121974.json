The Blazers led by 21 points in the game, but coach Terry Stotts did not play anyone more than 25 minutes and the Kings, who played some regulars extended minutes, stole a win with a late flurry.\nEven with the loss, it's been an encouraging exhibition season for the Blazers, who have showcased a versatile and potent offense, surprising depth and good chemistry.\nWill they take another step in the right direction? Can they continue to get a host of contributions from a variety of positions?\nJump in and share your thoughts about these questions and the game in the comments section below.\nVisit OregonLive.com/blazers for a recap and more coverage.\nâ€” Joe Freeman | jfreeman@oregonian.com | 503-294-5183 | @BlazerFreeman", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/BlazerFreeman"], "published": "2015-10-11T05:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T10:17:32.347+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
