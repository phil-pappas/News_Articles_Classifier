Quarterback Tom Brady has been named the AFC Offensive Player of the Month; place-kicker Stephen Gostkowski has been tabbed the AFC Special Teams Player of the Month. It was a month of milestones for the two players, who played key roles as the Patriots put up 119 points, a franchise record for points scored over the first three games of a season. Completing 96-of-133 passes for 1,112 yards and nine touchdowns with no interceptions for a quarterback rating of 119.6, Brady directed the Patriots to a 3-0 record in the month. His nine TD passes included the 400th of his career (making him the fourth QB in NFL history to attain that feat), a 1-yarder to wide receiver Danny Amendola in last Sunday’s 51-17 rout of the Jacksonville Jaguars. The player of the month award is the eighth in Brady’s 16-year career. The Patriots’ can’t miss kid, Gostkowski has converted all 21 of his placement attempts – seven field goals and 14 point-after conversions – this year. The 14 straight point-after conversions pushed his streak to 425 consecutive PATs, six of them coming last Sunday when he eclipsed Matt Stover’s previous NFL record of 422 in a row. Through three games, Gostkowski leads the league in both points scored (with 35) and touchbacks (18). Now in his 10th year, Gostkowski has earned the player of the month award three times. Promotion for Thornton: The Patriots signed defensive lineman Khyri Thornton from their practice squad to their 53-man roster on Thursday. The team added four players to its practice squad, signing defensive back Brandon Dixon, offensive lineman Sean Hickey, wide receiver Austin Hill and linebacker Eric Martin. Let’s make a deal: Speaking to reporters via a conference call on Thursday, Saints head coach Sean Payton said that Wednesday’s trade that saw his team ship defensive lineman Akiem Hicks north to New England in exchange for tight end Michael Hoomanawanui came about “fairly quickly. “It was really over a matter of two or 21/2 days,” he said. A pause for the cause: Sounds like Jimmy Garoppolo’s mind will be wandering a lot further than his body during his team’s idle time. “Just hanging out, staying in Foxboro,” the Patriots’ backup quarterback answered when asked his plans for the bye week. “Hopefully it doesn’t rain as much as it’s supposed to, so we’ll see.” Regardless of the weather, Garoppolo said the free time from football, even at this early juncture in the NFL season, comes as welcome relief. Page 2 of 2 - “Usually it’s later in the year, so that’s a little different,” Garoppolo said, “but it’s nice to get away from it for a second. We’re not game planning, making adjustments, all that type of stuff. Just get your mind off it, relax a little bit, and then when we come back we’ll be full swing.” Rob Gronkowski cited the bye as an opportunity for some rest and relaxation for the body and the mind. “You can always use the rest for your body,” said the tight end, who added: “It’s always good to get your mind refreshed, get your mind off football for a few days and then come back fresh and prepared and ready to go.” When they do come back, the Patriots will be preparing to go to Dallas to play the Cowboys at AT&T Stadium, the 4:25 p.m. kickoff on Oct. 11 next on the Patriots’ schedule. Prior to the road trip, special teams captain Matthew Slater is looking forward to spending some time at home. “Just sticking around,” Slater said of his plans. “Try to catch up on some rest, spend some time with my wife, watch some football and be ready to go when I come back.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T04:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T07:47:47.925+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
