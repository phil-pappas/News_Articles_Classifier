They haven't lost yet, and there would be nothing better to upset them heading to the playoffs.\" \nThat's right, the Hilltops are 7-0 on the season. \nThe Colts (4-3) are now finishing up the toughest part of their schedule when these two rivals butt heads at Saskatoon Minor Football Field for a 1 p.m. kickoff. \nAfter playing three-straight against teams below them in the standings, the Colts lost to the second-place Regina Thunder last Sunday and get the Hilltops as a final salvo to the regular season. \nBut the second-year coach wouldn't have it any other way. These games are what heat the forge and mould the steel for the mettle of playoff football. \n\"You want to be playing your best football and playing against the best competition when the dance starts,\" Blokker said. \"You want to go into the post-season playing intense football.\" \nMetaphorically speaking, the Colts are circling the airport in a charter, waiting to see where they land in terms of the final standings. \nA win against the Hilltops and they're guaranteed third place and a second run at the Thunder this season in a semifinal game. A loss, combined with a Winnipeg Rifles win over the Edmonton Huskies, and the Colts get the Hilltops in the semis, while the Rifles would get the Thunder. \nOf course, there are a couple of scenarios waiting to unfold, but what matchup gives the club the best chance to advance to the final? \nThat's the $10 question. \nApparently, there aren't any best-case scenarios for the coach or his team. \n\"We have to play both those teams if we want to win the PFC,\" Blokker said. \"Whether we go to Regina first or Saskatoon first, we have to beat both those teams. I'm not going to stress over it.\" \nMeanwhile, there is a game to play as the Colts look to swing a sledgehammer to the Hilltops' perfect season. \n\"I don't know if we need to play a perfect game to beat them,\" Blokker said. \"We have to do the things we do well. We can't afford to give things away by being out of position. We can't (be individuals) out there. If we do that, that's a team that can kill you.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T08:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T15:18:57.081+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
