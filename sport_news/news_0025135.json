With Brian Ferlin out with post-concussion symptoms last Sunday, Khokhlachev fit in beautifully at right wing alongside Austin Czarnik and Frankie Vatrano as Providence beat Portland. Set up by Khokhlachev, Vatrano put Providence on the board just seven seconds into the game. Vatrano finished with four goals, Khokhlachev with four assists and Czarnik with a goal and three helpers. You couldn’t help but wonder if shifting Khokhlachev was a convenient solution to an injury situation or maybe part of a plan by management to get a look at him on the wing? “I’d say yes to both,’’ said John Ferguson Jr. , Boston’s executive director of player personnel. “We’ve considered the possibility that for him to legitimately maybe have a role and contribute up top, it may be on the wing. We don’t know.’’ “Those guys clicked right away in that first game. It’s not just based on need. It demonstrates Khokhlachev’s versatility. What better way to learn to play both positions than to do it here and make that part of what he can offer us in the future,’’ Ferguson said. P-Bruins coach Bruce Cassidy sees no reason why Khokhlachev can’t succeed on the wing. “I think Koko can be a fit on the wing cause he’ll compete on the walls. He can still make his plays in the offensive zone. Catching pucks on his backhand is going to be an issue, but he doesn’t always have to play his off-wing. He just happened to go there because there was a hole,’’ he said. The Khokhlachev-on-the-wing trial lasted just over two games. After an injury to Czarnik early in Friday’s game, Khokhlachev was moved back to center, with Vatrano and Zack Phillips on the wings. Dynamic duo With or without Khokhlachev on their line, Vatrano and Czarnik have been two of the best rookies in the league through the first two weekends of the season. “You really have to give them both a great deal of credit for investing time, effort and diligence in their own careers. These guys came to camp in excellent shape. They’re improved over last year, on and off the ice,’’ said Ferguson. “Vatrano’s made great strides in his fitness levels and it shows on the ice. He’s getting to more places on the ice where he can use his best assets more frequently. It’s early, but they’e been doing it right from the first day of camp.’’ Page 2 of 3 - A tremendous backchecking play by Vatrano in Hartford caught Ferguson’s eye. “That’s an impressive display of teamwork and character. A guy who has contributed on offense, but who respects the role of the goaltender and his defensemen. He’s getting help on the ice and he’s helping others. That’s what makes good teams and good teammates,’’ he said. Very special teams The P-Bruins went 0 for 6 on the power play on opening night and went 0 for 4 in the final two-plus periods on Saturday night. In between, Providence reeled off an amazing stretch of eight power play goals in 12 chances. The penalty kill has been strong, too. The P-Bruins have been shorthanded 12 times, but have given up only one goal. Langenbrunner on the job New Boston development coach Jamie Langenbrunner was on the ice for the first time for P-Bruins practices at the Dunkin’ Donuts Center a couple of mornings last week. “He’s working under the direction of (director of player development) Jay Pandolfo ,’’ said Ferguson. “He’s not going to relocate. He lives in the Midwest. He will be here on occasion. He’ll be out watching some of the players we’ve drafted and provide his input and evaluations and his advice.’’ Captain of the 2010 U.S. Olympic team, Langenbrunner won the Stanley Cup with Dallas and New Jersey, where he was a teammate of Pandolfo. Arnesson learning Defenseman Linus Arnesson is in his first full season in the American Hockey League after playing 11 regular-season games at the end of last season. The 21-year-old Swede – Boston’s second round pick, 60th overall, in 2013 -- has experienced the usual rookie ups and downs. “He’s had flashes of good and flashes where he loses a bit of his game. Usually with young guys, it’s about consistency. For him it’s just putting it together. He competes. His skating is good. I think he’s still trying to carve out an identity, but he’s been fine,’’ said Cassidy. According to Ferguson: “He looks like he’s adjusting well to North American hockey. He’s utilizing his strengths – skating, vision and puck movement. Like any other pro, he has areas that he can improve, but he is learning. He’s taken some real positive steps.’’ Injuries piling up Czarnik was the latest P-Bruin lost to injury. He left Friday’s game with an upper body injury after a hard hit from Bridgeport’s Mike Halmo . Page 3 of 3 - Other injured P-Bruins are Malcolm Subban (lower body), Ferlin (post-concussion symptoms), Ben Sexton (hand), Colton Hargrove and Andrew Cherniwchan (lower body). First start for Ginn With Subban out, rookie Zane McIntyre started the P-Bruins’ first four games. But after McIntyre gave up five goals on 17 shots on Friday night, Cassidy went with rookie Matt Ginn on Saturday. Ginn, who just traded in his purple-and-white Holy Cross pads for some black-and-gold pillows last week, was solid in his first pro start in Bridgeport, giving up two goals. He will return to Atlanta of the ECHL once Subban is healthy.
