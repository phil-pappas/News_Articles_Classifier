Chase Stevens/Las Vegas Review-Journal Follow @csstevensphoto By Matt YoumansLas Vegas Review-Journal \nIt's not too soon to predict Ike Nwamu will be a fan favorite this season. The muscular 6-foot-5-inch senior guard was the star of the UNLV basketball team's first public show Thursday night. \nNwamu made a 3-pointer before throwing down two spectacular dunks, the first off a missed free throw and the second on the run in transition, to highlight the Scarlet & Gray Scrimmage at the Thomas & Mack Center. \n\"Dunks are always momentum plays, so anytime you can get one it's good,\" he said. \"It gets the whole team going.\" \nNwamu got the crowd of around 2,500 going. But the graduate transfer from Mercer was more impressed by the fans. \n\"It's amazing for this many people to come for a scrimmage,\" Nwamu said. \"I've never experienced anything like this coming from Mercer, so it's really appreciated.\" \nThe Rebels played three six-minute periods, and Nwamu finished with a team-high 13 points in 17 minutes. The final score was 36-33. Nwamu was on the losing side with 7-foot freshman Stephen Zimmerman, who had seven points and 10 rebounds. \nSophomore guard Jordan Cornish led the winning team with nine points, and junior forward Ben Carter, freshman guard Jalen Poyser and senior guard Jerome Seagears each scored seven. \n\"It's a glorified practice, but there's a value in doing it,\" coach Dave Rice said. \"You always want to see how guys react to the lights being on with some people in the stands.\" \nThe free-throw shooting for the two sides (15 of 29) might seem to indicate the lights were turned off. But sophomore center Goodluck Okonoboh was the main culprit by shooting 1 of 7. Nwamu made all six of his free throws. \nRice expects Nwamu to deliver when it matters because that's his track record. Nwamu scored 11 points in Mercer's memorable upset of Duke in the 2014 NCAA Tournament. He led the Bears in scoring last season at 15.1 points per game. \n\"Ike has played in a lot of college basketball games, and he played in the NCAA Tournament. He has a maturity about him,\" Rice said. \"He's got credibility with our guys. He actually will help coach the younger guys. You will hear him during a break in the action make constructive, positive comments to the younger guys. It's a lot easier to make comments when you're one of the hardest working guys out there.\" \nNwamu also is one of the most physically impressive guys on the roster, sporting the build of a linebacker. \n\"Not only does he look that way, he is that way,\" Rice said. \"He's big and strong and very explosive.\" \nHe wants to finish his career with a return to the NCAA Tournament, but that goal is a long way off. \n\"It was a lot of fun to get out there and kind of get some game action. We're really excited to get this season started, so it was a good first step,\" Nwamu said. \n\"It's amazing talent here. All of the young guys are really good. It's just getting everybody acclimated to the way high-level basketball is played. I feel really good about where we are right now.\" \nContact reporter Matt Youmans at myoumans@reviewjournal.com or 702-387-2907.
