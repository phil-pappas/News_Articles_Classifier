Breaking News Alerts Chicago-area native Curtis Granderson reached on an error in his first playoff at-bat in Chicago, Tuesday night. \nIf it looks like Curtis Granderson is playing like he has some kind of grudge against the Cubs, maybe it goes back to middle school when they kept pre-empting his favorite show. \n“I would get home from school ready to watch Saved by the Bell,” said the Mets right fielder from Lynwood. “I would be excited, ready to watch one thing, and the Cubs would be on in the sixth or the seventh inning, and I would be disappointed.” \nNo wonder he seems so ticked off at the Cubs. \n“Not necessarily the Cubs,” he said. “Just the fact that I didn’t get a chance to see Saved by the Bell.” \nWhether it’s all those afternoons without getting his fix of Screech and Lisa Turtle or some comfort zone against one of his hometown teams, Granderson has answered the Bell throughout his career when it comes to the Cubs. \nThe TF South grad, who was drafted out of UIC in 2002, is 17-for-48 (.354) in 13 regular-season games at Wrigley Field, with a .421 on-base percentage, three steals and a .984 OPS. \nAnd as he played Tuesday night in his first career playoff game in Chicago, the Mets’ leadoff hitter already had been a big part of beating the Cubs in the first two games of the NLCS in New York – driving in two runs in the Mets’ 4-2 win in Game 1 and scoring twice in their 4-1 Game 2 win. \nHe also stole two bases in Sunday’s Game 2, including a steal of third that allowed him to score on a two-out infield hit – and robbed Chris Coghlan of a home run with a leaping catch at the wall in Sunday’s second inning. \nHe reached twice in Game 3 but did little damage in the Mets’ 5-2 win that put the Cubs on the brink of elimination. \n“Any time I get a chance to play against either one of the Chicago teams, it’s always a lot of fun,” said Granderson, who didn’t do nearly the consistent damage against the White Sox in his 10 years in the American League, including six as a division rival with Detroit. \n“Obviously, with it now being in the postseason, with more eyes on it, and where the games mean more, it’s really fun getting a chance to be a part of it,” he said. \nAnd, obviously, this Saved by the Bell thing is still really grinding his gears, the way his 34-year-old body suddenly has him playing with the energy of a kid. \n“No, not at all,” he said. “I’m just trying to help us win as many games as possible and hopefully advance.” \nIn fact, he had no local allegiances or grudges with Chicago’s teams growing up. He was a Braves fans, because they were always on the Superstation he actually turned to for baseball. \n“Every time I got a chance to go to one of those teams’ games I enjoyed being at the ballpark,” he said. “But that’s really it when it comes to either of the Chicago teams. \n“I just like going home when I get a chance to.” Celebrity", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T19:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T23:16:05.460+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
