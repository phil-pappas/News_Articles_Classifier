Everyone gets on really with him, even though he is American, but there we go. I am not sad because in losing Tom I am gaining another, so it makes everything all good.\" \nDaley's mother also confirmed to the Plymouth Herald that the couple will not set a wedding date until after the Rio 2016 Olympic Games, where the diver will be fighting for gold.
