The SPSL 4A Northeast schools have become so linked, THS coach Tony Davis isn’t sure how to categorize it.\n“It’s like playing your brother? No, maybe cousin,” said the long-time coach of the connection that keeps hatred from polluting the rivalry. “It’s their (Kentwood) homecoming, so it wouldn’t shock me if some of our guys are invited to their dance.”\nFirst-year Kentwood coach Mike Bush adds more intrigue to Friday’s game at French Field because he trained some of Tahoma’s players before accepting the position. And the former Bothell High assistant coach has the Conquerors passing the ball more, looking somewhat like Tahoma.\nBut few can mirror Bears quarterback Amandre Williams. The senior leads the league in passing, completing 96 of 153 passes for 1,186 yards, 11 touchdowns and two interceptions.\nMost Read Stories Fatal crash involving stolen motorcycle snarls I-5 traffic Car strikes, kills toddler in stroller in Bellevue Rare fish landed off Westport could be new state record Man charged with breaking $120,000 Chihuly glass sculpture in Tacoma Seahawks 26, Bears 0: What the national media are saying Unlimited Digital Access. $1 for 4 weeks. Williams, a 6-foot-3 two-way player, has Tahoma off to a 4-0 start heading into its Northeast division opener.\n“Even in warmups, he does a great job of focusing and is never just going through the motions,” said Kentwood quarterback Brian Campbell, who participated in the Northwest 9 elite camp with Williams in August. It was the first opportunity for the players to work side-by-side.\n“Everything is for a purpose,” Campbell continued. “Working hard has always been my philosophy, so I was impressed. He’s a really great player.”\nUnder Bush’s tutelage, Campbell is growing as a passer. The coach was an All-Pac-10 athlete in basketball and football at Washington State.\nBush’s strength on the offensive end has Campbell completing 38 of 60 passes this season for 528 yards, seven touchdowns and three interceptions. But Campbell can still run the ball, rushing for touchdowns of 49 and 13 yards in Kentwood’s 62-24 victory against Kentridge last Thursday.\nThe Conquerors are on a three-game winning streak heading into Friday’s game. Kentwood (3-1, 1-0 SPSL 4A Northeast) lost 35-24 to Curtis in its season opener.\n“I was sizing him up, too,” said Williams of Campbell during the offseason camp in Kirkland. “(Brian) is throwing the ball a little bit more because of the coaching change. But I know he can run. He’s a good quarterback that’s going to give us some trouble. We’re going to have to lock him down.”\nHelping Williams is senior defensive end Michael Clausen. He has 22 solo tackles and 16 assists.\nOverall, Tahoma’s defense has helped the Bears outscore opponents 163-55.\n“Amandre is a great quarterback, but he’s an even better defensive end,” Bush said. “We need to match their intensity and play physical. From what I know, Kentwood has been pretty dominant in the series. But with Tahoma getting some lopsided victories, we’ll have to keep the game close to have an opportunity to win.” \nIf the proximity of the schools is telling at all, close shouldn’t be a problem.\nJayda Evans: 206-464-2067 or jevans@seattletimes.com .
