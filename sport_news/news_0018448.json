The Centre will provide soil health cards to all farmers in the country in three years but Himachal has decided to achieve the target in one year. The Centre has released Rs 1 crore under the project, said Director Agriculture JC Rana. “Since the samples have to be taken after harvesting and before sowing of the next crop, all-out efforts are being made to achieve the target in homogeneous agro-climatic locations and cards will be issued to farmers on the basis of sample reports”, he said, adding that the proforma containing all information regarding the land, size, location and cropping pattern had been filled. Rana said the sampling was more exhaustive this time and 12 parameters had been added and besides major nutrients such as nitrogen, phosphorous and potassium, analysis of micro nutrients such as calcium, magnisium, iron, boron, zink and copper had been included in the samples. Further, the samples were being taken through GPS and as such the exact location, latitude, longitude, khasra numbers, etc were also given in the cards. The samples would be tested in laboratories and cards would be prepared accordingly. Rana said the World Soil Day was being observed on November 5 and the Union government targeted to distribute 4-crore cards on that day. Functions for distributing cards would be organised in the parliamentary constituencies and a target of distributing 2-lakh cards had been fixed for Himachal, which would be achieved. The department had taken 28,000 samples last season between rabi harvesting and kharif sowing and campaign was going on a war footing to take 41,000 samples before the second week of November when the rabi sowing would commence, he informed.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T22:47:59.932+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
