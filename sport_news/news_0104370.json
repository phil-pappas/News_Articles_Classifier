The Rangers will entertain New Jersey, the Jets are home for the Washington Redskins and the Mets will host Game 2 of the NL Championship Series against the Chicago Cubs.\nThe only other instance of all three teams being home on the same day was 16 years ago Saturday - Oct. 17, 1999. The Jets were beaten by Peyton Manning and the Indianapolis Colts 16-13, the Rangers topped the Atlanta Thrashers 4-1 and the Mets needed 15 innings to beat the Atlanta Braves 4-3 in Game 5 of the NLCS.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
