A little more than two minutes into the first half, Ashun found sophomore Richard Cabrera unmarked in the box, and Cabrera netted his first score of the season. \nThe rest of the first half was filled with great opportunities, but no one could capitalize. The Cardinals drew a 30-yard free kick with 26 minutes to go until halftime. Junior defender Jackson Iorio sent a nice cross near the goal, but the ball sailed out of bounds, as nobody from Westwood could get a touch on it. \nFive minutes later the ball was kicked by the Cardinals into the box and stopped by a Huskies defender. As he was controlling it, the Westwood team and its fans all alleged that the back touched the ball with his hand. No call was made, and the ensuing argument led to one Cardinals' player being shown a yellow card. Despite all the chances, Dumont only led Westwood by a goal at halftime. \nHuskies add 2 more \nWestwood head coach Scott Murphy thought his team played a solid first session. He believed they controlled an important element of the game. \n\"We played well in the beginning,\" he said. \"The early goal let us down a bit, but we played our possession game pretty well.\" \nThe Huskies doubled their lead nine minutes into the second half, when Ashun scored his fifth goal of the season. His shot deflected off a Westwood defender and landed on the opposite side of where the Cardinals goalie thought it would fall. \nFour minutes later Dumont struck again. Senior Eric Ramirez had some open space and decided to shoot. Westwood senior goalie Alan Miller dove to his left, attempting to make the save, but the shot was hard enough that the ball tipped off Miller's hand and crossed the line to put the Huskies up by three. \nMiller remained positive about the remainder of the season. \n\"We need to keep working together as a team,\" he said. \"Obviously, our record doesn't show where we want to be. There are a lot of growing pains going on, but it doesn't mean that our winning era is over.\" \nCommunication \nAshun added his second tally on the day when he faked out a Cardinals defender, and placed his shot in the right corner of the net to put Dumont up 4-0. With about five minutes to go, senior Zachary Naveo used a poor Westwood clearing pass to his advantage, scoring the team's fifth and final goal. \nThe officials called the game with three minutes left, due to the rain. \nHuskies junior goalkeeper Michael Vietri finished with a clean sheet and six saves. Vietri had to sprawl out more than once to avoid fishing any balls out of the back of the net. Vietri said his team could use work on one vital skill. \n\"We need to communicate more - that's been one of our problems,\" he said. \"We've been picking it up a lot though and we just have to keep working hard.\" Â© 2015  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T19:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T07:15:01.111+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
