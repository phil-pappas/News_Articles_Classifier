I wish him the best.\"\nThe 6-foot, 181-pound sophomore joins defensive end Tyler Marona, offensive tackle Kyle Knapp and defensive lineman Isaiah Johnson as Orange players to be medically disqualified due to concussions in the last two calendar years.\nLong, who never had a concussion reported previously, thanked the Orange community in an Instagram post on Monday.\nThank you #CuseNation these past 2-3 years have been incredible!! I'm looking forward to what else happens here in my next 2-3 years!! #s4g #alphalifestyle\nA photo posted by Aj Long (@apocalypse4) on Oct 12, 2015 at 10:32am PDT\nWith starter Terrel Hunt with a fractured fibula for most of last season, Long played in six games as a true freshman, starting five. He completed 54 percent of his passes for 935 yards, four touchdowns and eight interceptions while running for 45 yards and a pair of scores.\nLong also dealt with multiple injuries since arriving at SU in January 2014. His throwing hand became numb due to inflammation in his shoulder area following a eight-sack game against North Carolina State.\nEarly this summer, Long broke a bone in the area of his right hand that required a cast to be put on. He was limited for most of preseason camp and didn't start getting a significant amount of team reps until a couple weeks into the season, coaches said previously.\nLong came to Syracuse from Friendship (Lebanon, Tenn.) Christian School as one of two quarterbacks originally in the team's 2014 class. The other, Alin Edouard, never made it to SU due to a \"transcript issue.\"\nLong quickly became a fan favorite, helping recruit other players to the Orange, and bringing a competitive approach to his practice and training.\nWithout him, Syracuse has three healthy quarterbacks on roster: freshman Eric Dungey, sophomore walk-on Zack Mahoney and redshirt sophomore Austin Wilson. Hunt suffered another season-ending injury with a torn Achilles tendon .\nThe Orange has two quarterbacks pledged to its 2016 class in Rex Culpepper and Lindsey Scott. Culpepper, who is rehabbing a torn ACL , will arrive in January. Scott is the most recent addition to SU's class after pledging on Oct. 5\nContact Stephen Bailey anytime: Email | Twitter", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/stephen_bailey1", "https://instagram.com/p/8vvwB_hMnM/"], "published": "2015-10-14T11:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T07:31:45.218+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
