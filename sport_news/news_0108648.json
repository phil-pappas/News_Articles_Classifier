Ask the experts! \nSecond quarter \nAnalysis: Assuming command \nOhio State in the second quarter looked a lot more like the nation’s No. 1 team than it had looked in the first 15 minutes. The Buckeyes scored on two of their first three possessions, but somewhat curiously didn’t go for the throat when they could have buried Rutgers in the final minute of the first half. As it was, OSU’s 21-0 lead had a somewhat-safe feel; the offense was mostly rolling even though leading rusher Ezekiel Elliott was bottled up and the defense allowed a few big plays but nothing that threatened to remove the zero from the scoreboard. Ohio State was quick-strike on its two scoring drives – 80 yards in four plays on the first and 65 yards in four plays for the second. Michael Thomas had the game’s second TD when he caught J.T. Barrett’s simple out pass on the right sideline, made a nifty move on Isaiah Wharton and found an open lane to the end zone. The next touchdown was sparked by Barrett’s 45-yard bomb pass to Braxton Miller, which allowed the Buckeyes to move from their 37 to the Rutgers 18. Miller ran 16 yards on the play and Barrett ran a hurry-up sneak for the final 2 yards and the score. Ohio State then forced another Scarlet Knights punt – their fifth of the half – and took over on the OSU 17 with 54 seconds left in the half and all three timeouts. But coach Urban Meyer had Barrett take a knee on two straight plays to run out the clock; the Buckeyes were to receive the second-half kickoff, anyway.\nScoring summary \nOSU: Thomas 50 pass from Barrett (Willoughby kick), 6:48. Drive: Four plays, 80 yards, 2:12. Key plays: Miller 10 pass from Barrett for first down at the OSU 34; Barrett 16 run for first down at the 50; on the next play, Barrett passed to the right sideline to Thomas, who put a move on Wharton, cut to the middle of the field and was gone. Ohio State 14, Rutgers 0\nOSU: Barrett 2 run (Willoughby kick), 3:02. Drive: Four plays, 65 yards, 1:28. Key plays: Miller 45 pass from Barrett for first down at the Rutgers 18; Miller 16 run for first-and-goal at the 2; on the next play, Barrett took the snap and moved to his right along the line until a path to the end zone opened. Ohio State 21, Rutgers 0\nFirst quarter \nAnalysis: Feeling-out process \nOhio State managed to avoid being shut out in the first quarter for the second week in a row, and from falling behind its opponent for the fourth consecutive time in Big Ten play, but just barely. The Buckeyes scored with only 10 seconds left in the quarter when Ezekiel Elliott burst through a hole over left guard for his 12th rushing touchdown of the season. By all rights, that should have made the score 7-3, but Rutgers’ Kyle Federico banged a 29-yard field-goal attempt off the left upright. Rutgers had moved smartly after taking the opening kickoff, going from its 25-yard line to the OSU 11 in 11 plays, mixing passes from Chris Laviano (22 yards) and runs from Paul James (35 yards). After Federico’s gift miss, the Buckeyes went from the 20 to the Rutgers 20 before quarterback J.T. Barrett lost a fumble after being hit on a third-down scramble. Ohio State forced a punt, however, and Jalin Marshall had a 29-yard punt return to set up the scoring drive. Barrett had two key completions on the drive, an 11-yard pass to Elliott on third-and-9 and a 20-yard bullet to Michael Thomas for a first down at the Rutgers 12.\nScoring summary \nOSU: Elliott 2 rin (Willoughby kick), :10. Drive: Nine plays, 42 yards, 4:03. Key plays: Elliott 11 pass from Barrett on third-and-9 from the Rutgers 41; Thomas 20 pass from Barrett for first down at the 12; Elliott 1 run in third-and-1 from the 3; he scored over left guard on the next play.
