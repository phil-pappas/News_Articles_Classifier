A combination of controlling the clock and holding onto the football is how the game is played at Herriman High.\nIt took until the 2:18 mark in the first quarter before Herriman senior quarterback Hayden Reynolds could find senior wide receiver Peniamina Mobley in the Viking end zone with a five-yard pass for the first score. Kicker Denver Osborne added the point after. Needing to take every opportunity to get on the scoreboard, with just .13 seconds remaining in the first quarter, Viking freshman running back Dane Christiansen hauled in a Isaac Hamilton pass for 41 yards to score. Pleasant Grove's only score with senior Matt Smyth contributing the point after.\nHerriman scored twice in the second quarter. At the 5:48 mark, Reynolds hit senior receiver David Fotu with a four-yard pass and with 14.8 seconds remaining in the half, Reynolds pitched the ball to senior running back Kaden Strasters for a seven-yard touchdown run. Osborne added both PATs for Herriman. The rest of the game was all defense as no one could get the ball across either goal lines for the third or fourth quarters.\nPleasant Grove had their chances as three times Hamilton hit his receivers in the end zone, but all three times, the ball was dropped or knocked loose.\nFor the game, Pleasant Grove had 14 carries for 43 yards rushing and 15 of 33 passes for 151 yards for a total of 194 yards offense with 12 first downs. Herriman had 54 carries for 219 yards rushing and 6 of 8 passes for 95 yards for a total of 314 yards of offense with 17 first downs.\nHerriman head coach Dustin Pearce said, \"This was a hard-fought game, we didn't expect anything different. We play American Fork next and it doesn't get any easier.\"\nPleasant Grove falls to a 1-2 record in Region 4 play with a 3-4 overall record. They hit the road again next week to play at Riverton High School.\nHerriman now has 3-0 region record and a 5-2 record overall. They will travel to American Fork next week.\nKent Allen lives in Pleasant Grove and reports on Pleasant Grove High School varsity sports for Deseret Connect.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T06:11:14.876+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
