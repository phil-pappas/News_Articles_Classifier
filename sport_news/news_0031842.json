Chris Godwin had four catches for 135 yards and DaeSean Hamilton totaled 96 yards on his five receptions. \nHackenberg became the school career leader in completions (608) and yards passing (7,453), displacing Zach Mills in both categories. \nPenn State (6-2, 3-1 Big Ten) improved to 36-2-1 against the Terps, but Maryland's determined effort before a spirted crowd of 68,948 could help turn this into a regional rivalry. \nLocksley was promoted from offensive coordinator after head coach Randy Edsall was fired on Oct. 11. Although Maryland (2-5, 0-3) led in the fourth quarter and played its best game in a month, the result was all too familiar. CONNECT TWEET   \nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
