(Photo: Eric Hartline/USA TODAY Sports) \nVOORHEES — Goalies Michal Neuvirth and Steve Mason looked at each other quizzically as their nets were put side by side on the goal line. \nWhat was this drill? \nAssistant coach Gord Murphy spray-painted a line in the center of the ice from the blue line down to the back boards. \nFor the next 15 minutes or so, the Flyers battled. Each side of the freshly painted black line had a 3-on-2 battle, one puck being used for both of the mini-games and players not able to cross the new line to help. \n“Those are also good drills to battle with,” Mason said. “There’s lots of bang-bang plays. You don’t have a good feel of where you are in your crease because there is no crease and those are drills where you just try to have the extra effort and make the extra saves. At the end of the day, guys have fun with it. I thought the guys had pretty good compete level there, some guys breaking sticks over boards and what not.” \nJake Voracek was the one who had slammed his stick on the boards in frustration. He’s also the one whose goal won the drill for his team, dressed in green jerseys just like Dave Hakstol’s old team, the University of North Dakota. \nThe green guys celebrated as if they had won a game that counted in dramatic fashion. \nThere was a ton of emotion in the drill, a trick pulled out of Hakstol’s sleeve as he tries to keep the compete level high as the Flyers wait out a five-day break between games. They are hoping they can come back Tuesday against the Dallas Stars and not miss a beat from back-to-back wins over the reigning champion Chicago Blackhawks and Florida Panthers. \n“We just can’t panic if it’s going to be rusty, because I think it’s going to be rusty,” Voracek said. “It’s always like that. If you have five, six days without a game, that first 20 minutes you have to make sure you pay attention to the details. Maybe you’re gonna have heavy legs because that game tempo has nothing to do with the practice tempo. We’ve got to stay patient like we did the last two games and we’ve got to find a way to win the games.” \nThe Flyers were given off Thursday and Saturday so Hakstol could run practices back-to-back days before play resumed. \nLast season the Flyers had a five-day break in November, after they had won three straight. When play resumed, they dropped four in a row. \nWayne Simmonds said the rest could be “a good thing in this case,” because the Flyers are still fine-tuning Hakstol’s new systems. \n“I thought we’ve done a good job the last couple games with our systems but this is just going to solidify it,” Simmonds said. “We’re going to be going through them a little bit more. It should be second nature by the time we’re done this layoff.” \nTo Voracek’s point, the Flyers may be more familiar with Hakstol’s system, but the bigger concern will be matching the speed of the Stars Tuesday. Dallas will have had an extra game, Saturday night against Florida, on the Flyers before visiting Philly. \nThe next two days of practice for the Flyers will be interesting to see how else Hakstol tries to replicate game situations. By the time Tuesday rolls around, the Flyers will probably still need to take it up a notch or two. \n“It’s different. You’re practicing, you’re not playing,” Simmonds said. “You can be as intense as you want in practice, but it’s still not game situation. I think for us, when we get back to it on Tuesday against Dallas, we’ve got to play that first 20 minutes the way we played against Chicago our first 40. We took what they gave us and we didn’t try to force the play or anything like that. If we do that we should be successful.” \nDave Isaac; (856) 486-2479; disaac@gannettnj.com .
