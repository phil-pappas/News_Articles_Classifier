[The goalies] came up big, and that's why you have to have a good goalie. It's obvious, but it's the truth.\" \nKelly finished with eight saves, while Bile finished with five. And it seemed like each save was more important than the last.

(Geoff Smith — Berkshire Eagle) \nPittsfield opened the game with a goal inside of five minutes when Quinn Matthews tucked away a shot on a headed pass from Jackson Rich. Monument (4-5-2) went searching for an equalizer, and almost got it when Evan Peretti picked the ball off a Pittsfield defender and got 1-on-1 with Bile. Bile, though, rushed off his line and reached his hand behind him to deflect away Peretti's shot. \nThe first half stayed at 1-0 until the whistle. Pittsfield had a chance to add another when Rich got a head on a Jamie Rosiello pass, but Kelly was able to make the save and keep his team in it. \n\"[The goalies] played really good, and that's what you expect,\" Monument coach Matt Naventi said. \"That might not have been the case for us at the beginning of the season but Kevin is growing into his role really well.\" Advertisement \nMonument finally got itself going to open the second half. After a bit of a defensive shuffle from Naventi aimed at clogging up the midfield worked, Dan Newey blasted home a rebound on a shot from Isaac Graves that deflected off the right goalpost. It was an unfortunate sequence for Bile, who made saves on either side of the goal in more difficult situations. \nMonument was able to dictate possession for the first 20 minutes of the half, but as the game wore on Pittsfield started to find its footing again, only to be denied by Kelly. \nFirst, Kelly saved a nice header from Mike Holmes to keep things level, then Kelly and his defense somehow managed to keep a looping ball floating in the six-yard box from crossing the line on a Pittsfield corner. \nThe play was close, with the ball teetering on the goal line twice. Antil said he wasn't sure whether the ball did cross or not, but instead referenced how he was disappointed his team had to hope for a goal like that to save the game. \n\"It may have been, it may not have been in,\" Antil said. \"I didn't see it. But the game shouldn't come down to a toss-up like that.\" \nHolmes, who delivered the corner that nearly went in, then almost stepped up again as the helper, sending a free kick to Rich at the far post that Rich got a head on, only to see Kelly make a reaction save to tip the ball over the crossbar. \nThe result left both coaches on opposite ends of the satisfaction spectrum. For Naventi, the draw was a big boost for his team after the Spartans fell to the Generals 5-1 in the first game of the season. \n\"We are a young team with little varsity experience, so we knew we were going to take our licks,\" Naventi said. \"We did, but we know if we can go out and get whipped the first game of the season 5-1 against Pittsfield then get a tie the second time around, I think for their confidence they know they are getting better as a team and doing the right things.\" \nFor Antil, the draw was puzzling. It means the Generals are now winless in their last three games, but Antil saw something out of his side in the first half that leads him to believe the turnaround will come sooner rather than later. Pittsfield's Luke Dallenbach holds off Monument Mountain's Isaac Graves during Wednesday's game between the two sides. (Geoff Smith — Berkshire Eagle) \n\"We don't want to get to that point where we are playing desperate soccer,\" Antil said. \"We want to come into the last few minutes on top and have [the other team] chasing. It's good to see us controlling the game, but I'd like to be controlling the game in the first half through the second half — the whole time. We have the guys to do it, but we just need to find the missing piece.\" \nPittsfield returns to action on Saturday with an away game at Minnechaug. Monument Mountain is back on the pitch Friday when the team hosts West Springfield in a 6 p.m. contest.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T05:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T06:27:38.156+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
