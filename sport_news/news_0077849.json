Adam Le Fondre was well placed on the edge of the six-yard box only to see his shot blocked.The rebound flew to Afobe but he could not keep his shot from 10 yards down and it sailed aimlessly over the bar.Brentford cashed in on that let-off when Hofmann, who had been denied seconds earlier, raced into the boxa to collect a header from John Swift and calmly took the ball around Martinez before finishing into an empty net.
