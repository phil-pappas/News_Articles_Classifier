Most Popular October 5, 2015 | 4:54 pm \nAMES — Mike Warren surprised himself when he rattled off back-to-back 100-plus yard rushing games. \nThrough all of the questions that surrounded the Iowa State run game in the preseason and first two weeks, Warren approached his role as a starter with a zen-like quality. The red-shirt freshman doesn’t let pressure get to him when he has success, he channels it to strive for more. \n“I’ve just got to go out there and play football and just surprise people again and again,” Warren said. “I don’t want people to be complacent with how I’m doing right now when I know I can do way better.” \nWarren’s 175-yard rushing output fueled the Cyclones’ (2-2, 1-0) 25-point blowout against Kansas, giving the ISU run game optimism in sustaining a ground attack. Back-to-back 200-plus rushing yard games was a breath of fresh air — after mustering 140 yards in the first two games combined — but Iowa State coach Paul Rhoads isn’t ready to say with 100-percent certainty the run game is fully established. \n“We’ve done it back to back, but I don’t know if there’s any consistency yet in our running game,” Rhoads said in his news conference Monday. “If we do it a third (time overall) and do it a second against a Big 12 Conference opponent, then you might say we have something there.” \nTexas Tech — Iowa State’s opponent Saturday at 2:30 p.m. in Lubbock, Texas — might just be the perfect team for the Cyclones to prove the running game has some merit. The Red Raiders (3-2, 0-2) are last in the Big 12 in total defense, giving up 581 total yards. \nBoth of Texas Tech’s losses were to top-five teams — No. 2 TCU by three and No. 3 Baylor by 28, respectively — but it has given up an average of 277.4 yards per game on the ground, also last in the Big 12. Last week marked the first time an ISU running back had 100-plus rushing yards in back-to-back weeks since 2013, and Warren sees no reason why he can’t ride this wave of confidence he’s amassed. \n“It really boosts (my confidence) going into this week,” Warren said. “They’ve given up 277 rushing yards and that’s a big plus for me. I know I can capitalize off my last game if I stick to the little things and stick to my fundamentals and technique.” \nThe newfound success in the running game has also helped open up things for senior quarterback Sam Richardson and the ISU passing attack. Big plays in the running game allowed Richardson to run more play attack against the Jayhawks defense last week, allowing him to throw for 269 yards and two touchdowns. \nTexas Tech also possess the last-place passing defense in the conference and has given up 303.6 yards per game on average through five games. When the defense commits to stopping the run, Richardson is able to recognize single coverage matchups down the field and a chance to deliver passes to his big targets at receiver. \n“Any time the defense is worried about stopping the run, it’s taking numbers away from the receivers and the coverages they’re getting,” Richardson said, “so the pass helps the run and the run helps the pass.” \nl Comments: montzdylan@gmail.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T23:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T19:07:40.637+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
