But, personally I am very disappointed at the way I played, especially on the greens. I just couldn’t buy a putt today and unfortunately for me, even Adam Scott, who I was partnering today, also had a case of a cold putter and in matchplay one cannot afford that. We lost 3&2 to Phil Mickelson and Zach Johnson, who not only got out of trouble when they needed to, but also made their share of birdies, which we did not.Frankly, I played pretty well on the front nine, hitting the ball and gave myself enough opportunities. But, pretty much every time I had a look at a birdie, I missed it, except when once on 10th I had a decent one. I could definitely have made at least four more birdies, but it was not to be. So, it is quite disappointing; it is never a good feeling to lose.Hopefully I can make up tomorrow and contribute in the singles, where I am up against Chris Kirk. I know if I can roll in one or two good putts, then I should be fine and then I could get on a roll. So, it is very important for me to get that quite early tomorrow. Adam, as a partner was great. He was encouraging and has taken on the role of a mentor in our team. He is playing his seventh Presidents Cup and he, more than anyone one of us, desperately wants to win the Cup. Believe me each one of us in that room from the captain to vice-captains, assistants and the players, spouses and our support staff badly want to win the Cup.The team as a whole has been pulling for each other, even the guys, who are not in for any of the sessions. For instance the feeling was so amazing when Hideki (Matsuyama) and (Sangmoon) Bae blitzed the course. That was just like Rickie did on the first day against Thongchai and me.I think that’s what I need tomorrow, a hot putter at the start to get me going.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T17:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T01:41:22.045+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
