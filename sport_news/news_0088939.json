(AP) - The Kansas City Royals were in this situation last year, dropping the World Series opener to San Francisco before responding with victories in the next two games. \nThey aren’t shaken by a 5-2 loss to the Houston Astros in Game 1 of their AL Division Series. \n“It’s a five-game series,” manager Ned Yost said Thursday night. “It’s not a death sentence to lose Game 1.” \nEspecially with Johnny Cueto headed to the mound in Game 2 on Friday. \n“That’s exactly why we got Johnny Cueto. If you lose Game 1, then you’ve got Johnny to help you bounce back,” Yost said. “And best-case scenario, you win Game 1 and you’ve got Johnny to take it to a two-game lead. So that’s why we got Johnny, for games like that.” \nNot that Yordano Ventura and the Royals’ other pitchers weren’t any good Thursday night. \nIt’s just that Collin McHugh and the Astros’ arms were better. \nMcHugh allowed four hits, including a pair of solo homers by Kendrys Morales, while pitching around a 49-minute rain delay. The right-hander lasted six innings before turning the game over to his bullpen, which scattered three runners over the final three frames. \nLuke Gregerson, part of Oakland’s wild-card collapse in Kansas City last year, got the save. \n“Obviously, it’s not the way we wanted to start out, especially at home,” Royals first baseman Eric Hosmer said. “We need to get out of here splitting the series 1-1.” \nGeorge Springer and Colby Rasmus went deep for the homer-happy Astros, but they also scored via the same sort of small ball the Royals used in reaching the World Series last season. \nVentura (0-1) yielded three runs on four hits and a walk in two innings for Kansas City, but did not come back following the delay. Chris Young served up Springer’s home run with one out in the fifth, but tossed four otherwise solid innings of relief. \n“I hated it rained,” Ventura said through a translator, “but that’s part of it.” \nThe Astros, who struggled so mightily on the road this season, have apparently solved their woes just in time. They beat the Yankees 3-0 in New York in Tuesday night’s wild-card game, then took care of a Royals club built specifically for spacious Kauffman Stadium. \nHouston also made it the first time since 1970 that visiting teams won baseball’s first four postseason games, STATS said. The other two times it happened were 1906 and 1923.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T08:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T10:08:49.263+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
