The Lady Pirates won 14-25, 25-16, 25-20, and 25-16, overcoming a hot start by Gulf Coast to take a 2-1 lead in the season series and move to within one victory of clinching the league championship. “It’s very exciting,” Pensacola State coach Chris Laird said. “It’s tough to come over here and get a win and we’re fortunate to come out with one. I think the girls played great. Both sides had some great digs and some flashes of brilliance. Luckily, we sustained that a little longer.” In the early going, it looked as though the home team would again hold serve as it had in the first two meetings this season, with Gulf Coast controlling the opening set from start to finish. Jordan Rayburn had six of her team-high 11 kills in the first set, with a kill and a subsequent ace serve by Rayburn putting the Lady Commodores up 18-9. A kill by Mackenzie Chambers gave GulfCoast set point and Delia Morin served it out for the 25-14 win. The tide turned quickly in the second set, with seven early errors by the Lady Commodores and a kill by Leah Rand helping Pensacola State to a 12-6 lead. An ace serve by Jessica Fabian and an error by Pensacola State trimmed the margin to 13-10, but the Lady Pirates answered with an 11-2 run capped by a kill by Shantel Williams for a 21-12 edge. Marigrace Holt served it out on set point to level the match 1-1, and the Lady Pirates opened the third set by scoring 10 of the first 13 points to take control. GulfCoast fought back with a 7-1 run, getting three straight serves from Fabian to cut the deficit to 11-10. Back-to-back aces by Taylor Sauer put the Lady Commodores up 19-18, but the Lady Pirates stormed back with a 7-1 run to close the set. A kill by Christina Strange tied it back up and consecutive kills by Rand put Pensacola State up 21-19. Rand added two more kills to close out the set, including on set point to put her team up 2-1. The Lady Pirates again started the fourth set on fire, jumping out to a 6-1 lead thanks to kills by Rand, Williams, Strange, and IyariaWalker. Another kill by Walker made it 20-9 before the Lady Commodores finally showed some life, getting a kill from Chambers and three straight serves from Tessa Morken to cut the deficit to 20-13. But the hole was too deep to dig out of, as Rand stopped the run with another kill and Taylor Kasper followed with two straight serves to bring the Lady Pirates two points from a match win. Page 2 of 2 - Kills by Brooklynn Roberts and Sauer got Gulf Coast back to within seven at 23-16, but a Williams kill gave Pensacola State match point and Kaitlin Grote ended it with an ace that clipped the back line. Rand led Pensacola State (16-8) with 13 kills, with Williams adding 11 kills, and Strange and Walker eight each. Grote finished with 36 assists to lead the Lady Pirates, with Kasper leading with 15 digs. Rayburn’s 11 kills were tops for the Lady Commodores (11-12), while Sauer had nine kills, Roberts eight, Chambers five, and Fabian three. Delia Morin had 33 assists. The two teams will meet again Oct. 22 and Laird said he expects to see a hungry GulfCoast team looking to keep its postseason dreams alive. “We’re excited to go back home,” he said. “I know Gulf Coast is a fantastic team and they’ll come over and try to return the favor, so we have to make sure we’re prepared and don’t play to the moment.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T05:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T05:47:14.988+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
