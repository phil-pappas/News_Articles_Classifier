Honestly, I just want to do whatever I can to help this team win and win a World Series.”\nIf nothing else, Reynolds has his “Bull Durham” clichés down.\nHe was placed on the postseason roster, despite spending all of 2015 with Triple-A Las Vegas, when Ruben Tejada suffered a broken leg in Game 1 of the NLDS on Chase Utley’s takeout slide.\nThe Yankees’ Chet Trail was placed on the 25-man roster for the 1964 World Series, but never was activated, and also never played a single major league game. Oakland’s Mark Kiger was the only player in the modern era to play his first MLB game in the postseason, when he entered as a defensive replacement in Game 3 of the 2006 ALCS.\nThe Mets haven’t set their World Series roster yet and Juan Uribe took grounders and hit during a workout at Citi Field on Friday, but Reynolds remains the lone healthy shortstop to back up Wilmer Flores.\nReynolds was prepared for his 2015 campaign to be over when he failed to get a September call-up from the Mets.\n“As a competitor, I wanted to be up here and help the team win and get to the playoffs,” said Reynolds, who hit .267 with six homers and 65 RBIs with Las Vegas. “But at the same time I accepted the fact I wasn’t called up and went into the offseason looking forward to next year and getting ready.”\nBut before he went home, Reynolds was told to head to Port St. Lucie instead.\n“I got the call to go to Florida just in case of an injury or something like that,” Reynolds said. “Unfortunately for Tejada, it happened and now I’m here just trying to make the most of my opportunity, and we’ll see what happens.”\nHis presence almost was needed when Flores took a knee to the head sliding into second base against the Cubs in Game 4 of the NLCS. Flores remained in the game, however, so Reynolds has had to keep himself sharp.\n“I take extra ground balls in batting practice,” Reynolds said. “Take live BP off a machine, just stay ready for live pitching.”\nThe 24-year-old is eligible to receive a postseason share in a vote taken by the team’s players before the playoffs begin.\nHis focus, though, is on the field.\n“It’s been very exciting just to be a part of this experience,” Reynolds said. “Not everyone gets to play in a World Series or even make the playoffs in their career. Just to be here to be a part of this team, to see what it’s like to be in the big leagues and to be in the playoffs is a remarkable experience, something I will cherish the rest of my life.”\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google Whatsapp Email Filed under matt reynolds ,  new york mets ,  ruben tejada ,  wilmer flores ,  world series", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T03:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T14:23:10.744+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
