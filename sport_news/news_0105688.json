(Image Source: Jared Wickerham/Getty Images) \nHere’s a look at the Sunday Night Football matchup between the Indianapolis Colts and the New England Patriots: \nSeries: Patriots lead 46-28; Streaks: Patriots won past 4; Last Meeting: Patriots 42, Colts 20 (11.16.14) \nTime: 8:30 PM ET; TV: NBC (Al Michaels, Cris Collinsworth & Michelle Tafoya) \nSpread: Giants -7; O/U 43 \nInjury Report: Patriots: Out: CB Tarell Brown (foot), OT Nate Solder (bicep); Questionable: DE Trey Flowers (knee/shoulder), Dont’a Hightower (ribs), RB Dion Lewis (abdomen) \nColts : Questionable: ILB Jerrell Freeman (groin), ILB Nate Irving (knee), QB Andrew Luck (right shoulder); Probable: OLB Trent Cole (back), WR T.Y. Hilton (groin), OLB Bjoern Werner (hamstring), DT Billy Winn (eye); No Status: RB Tyler Varga (concussion) \nWhere They Stand: Heading into Week 6, the New England Patriots are one of six undefeated teams in the NFL, leaving them atop the AFC East. This rematch of the AFC Championship Game features not just one but two first-place teams. After starting the season 0-2, the Indianapolis Colts have won three straight games, all against AFC South foes. The similarities end there, as New England’s plus-73 tops the AFC, second in the NFL, while Indianapolis is the only team with a winning record and a negative point differential (-14). \nThe Patriots: QB Tom Brady threw for 275 yards and two TDs (no INTs; 1309.9 rating) last week, making him the third passer in NFL history to lead his team to 4-0 starts in four different seasons. WR Julian Edelman is emerging as a go-to pass catcher and in his past nine games the former college QB has 75 receptions for 909 yards and six TDs. No one is more dangerous than TE Rob Gronkowski , who leads the NFL with 58 TD catches since 2010, including 10 in his past 10 games. He needs two TD receptions to become just the fifth TE to reach 60. On the ground, the Pats mix it up with the quick Dion Lewis and the powerful LeGarrette Blount . Blount has rumbled for 70-plus yards in the past two games, while Lewis has scored in three straight games. He also had a career-high eight grabs in last week’s win. Leading the New England defense is a pair of edge pass rushers. DE Chandler Jones has 6.5 sacks in his past six road games and OLB Jamie Collins has 7.5 sacks in his past nine games overall. The Pats had major losses to the secondary in the offseason, vaulting CB Ryan Logan into a bigger role. His nine INTs since 2013 are third among AFC corners. \nThe Colts: In two regular season matchups, QB Andrew Luck has thrown for 637 yards and four TDs against the Pats. Luck has missed the past two games with a shoulder injury and veteran Matt Hasselbeck has filled in admirably. The three-time Pro Bowler threw for 213 yards and two scores (no INTs; 107.4 rating) last week, winning his second-straight start for the first time in four years. He’s not the only Colt long in the tooth who is proving he still has something left in the tank. RB Frank Gore ran for 98 yards last week giving him 11,398 in his career, as he moved ahead of Steven Jackson and John Riggins for 16 th place all-time. WR Andre Johnson caught six passes for 77 yards and two TDs a week ago to move past Isaac Bruce for eighth on the all-time reception list with 1,024 catches. WR T.Y. Hilton hopes to get a quarter-way to 1,000, needing nine tonight to crack the 250-catch plateau. LB D’Qwell Jackson has a whopping 58 tackles, more than double any other Colt. He’s had 10-plus tackles for three-straight games. S Mike Adams is a solid two-way player who is second on the club with 28 tackles and he is tied for first in the AFC with eight INTs since the start of last season. \nPrediction: I don’t know if you heard…but the Patriots are like super pissed at the Colts for being tattle tails…and because of that they going to blow them out by like a gazillion points. Such an easy narrative, right? Except sports don’t always work that way. The Colts, they want to win too. They’re also professionals with their own motivations. It’s not that easy or obvious when picking outcomes, especially in the NFL. Having said that, I still believe the Pats will come out on top, but Indy gives them a fight. \nScore: New England Patriots 31, Indianapolis Colts 27 \nDaniel Mogollon is a member of the Pro Football Writers of America and the Football Writers Association of America.
