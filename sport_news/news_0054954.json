We still like our chances.” \nLast year, Cebu CC bungled a formidable lead in the final day to lose by one at Alta Vista in Cebu. Because of their respective team’s average handicaps, only SW-Masters and Cebu CC are entered in the Championship division. \n“It’s virtually match play,” said Ong. \nTeams will be allowed to field in eight players a day for two rounds, with the top six scores to in the event sponsored by the Mareco Broadcasting Network (Crossover), Travelife, Business Mirror, Airbus, Splash Philippines, Wealth Inc. and East Gate Publication.
