(AP) - The entire state of Mississippi has been put under a burn ban because of dry conditions.\nGov. Phil Bryant issued the ban Tuesday at the request of the Mississippi Forestry Commission. It will last indefinitely.\nMuch of the state is experiencing a drought, and more than half of the 82 counties were already under a burn ban before Tuesday.\nA news release from the governor's office says the Forestry Commission has responded to more than 430 wildfires since Oct. 1.
