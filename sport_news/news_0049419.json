(AP) - \nAaron Rodgers threw for two touchdowns and 241 yards, and the Green Bay Packers held off the St. Louis Rams for a 24-10 win on Sunday in spite of three turnovers by their normally mistake-free quarterback.Rodgers connected with receivers Ty Montgomery and James Jones for long scoring strikes.But NFL-record streaks of 587 pass attempts and 49 touchdown passes at home without an interception for Rodgers ended in the first quarter on linebacker James Laurinaitis' diving pick of a tipped ball for the Rams (2-3).Rodgers threw another interception in the second quarter before losing a fumble in the third.Relentless pressure on quarterback Nick Foles helped keep the Packers (5-0) unbeaten. Foles threw a career-worst four interceptions, two in the fourth quarter inside the Packers 10.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T00:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T00:57:05.631+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
