Sokolowski, USA TODAY Sports Unorthodox trio carries Royals to cusp of WS TORONTO -- The leadoff hitter rarely reaches base and has told the world he’ll always hack at the game’s first pitch.\nAdChoices The starter is a towering right-hander who didn’t throw a single pitch 90 mph and allowed more fly balls than any other pitcher in baseball.\nThe right fielder had the sport’s worst offensive production at one of its premium offensive positions.\nThese are the Kansas City Royals, whose methods are openly unconventional but whose results are unquestioned.\nAlcides Escobar has led off all four games of the American League Championship Series with a base hit — Tuesday’s single sparked a four-run inning highlighted by Ben Zobrist’s home run — while Chris Young held the vaunted Toronto Blue Jays lineup to three hits and two runs and Alex Rios went 3-for-3 with a home run.\nThis trio is more anomalous than archetypal, but their efforts led the Royals crushed the Jays 14-2 to lead three games to one and move within a win of a return trip to the World Series.\n“Obviously we’ve got a good chance to be back at the big dance, but you’ve got to realize the ball club we’re playing over there,” first baseman Eric Hosmer said. “It’s a team that can explode at any time. We’ve got to continue to keep our foot on the gas and try to seal up this last win.”\nMost managers now understand the value of on-base percentage supersedes speed at the top of the order, yet Royals skipper Ned Yost continues writing Escobar’s name atop his lineup card for the simplest reason: “It works.” Never mind that Escobar had the lowest on-base percentage among any regular leadoff hitter; he reached base in nine of first 15 plate appearances this series — all without the aid of a walk.\n“Statistically speaking it doesn't make any sense,” Yost has admitted.\nThis season, the Royals were 82-49 (.626) when Escobar led off and 13-18 (.419) when he didn’t; when K.C. needed a strong finish to clinch home-field advantage, Escobar returned to the No. 1 spot for the last five games of the regular season — all wins — and now a 6-3 postseason record.\nAmplifying the absurdity is the superstition that Escobar has been instructed to swing at every first offering of the first inning. Escobar has explained, “Always I swing the first pitch,” at the behest of hitting coach Dale Sveum. The result is immaterial. He swung and missed in Game 4, for instance, but later singled.\n“I want to go to the home plate and be aggressive,” Escobar said “trying to swing at the strike.”\nBy the second inning, Rios had also homered for the visitors, Escobar was hit by a pitch and Lorenzo Cain walked, ending Dickey’s day before he could record six outs. Dickey had a 1.94 ERA in his final eight home starts, but seven of the 12 batters he faced reached, as they adhered to the adage about squaring a falling knuckleball: “Up high, let it fly; down low, let it go.”\nThe Royals kept picking away at the bullpen, too: Escobar added a late-game RBI single and two sacrifice flies, half of their postseason-record four on the day.\nYoung exited one out shy of qualifying for a win — a “somewhat ridiculous stat,” he later quipped — but his 42/3 inning of two-run ball was more than ample distance for the Royals’ vaunted bullpen to preserve the victory. It’s a remarkable return on investment for an early March signing for an incentive-laden contract with a puny $675,000 base.\n“We were three weeks into spring training, and CY shows up randomly,” first baseman Eric Hosmer said, “and he’s pitching Game 4.”\nThe 6-11 Young, 36 and pitching for his eighth organization, never once lit up a first-digit \"9\" on the radar gun in 2,048 pitches this season, and didn’t on any of his 78 deliveries on this afternoon either. Even Blue Jays infielder Cliff Pennington — who pitched part of the ninth inning — touched 91.\nArmed with a high-80s fastball and a good-enough slider, however, Young worked low in the zone and kept Toronto off-balance.\n“The guys went out and set the tone with the bats early and gave me room for error,” Young said, “and from there it allowed me to be aggressive and turn it over to the bullpen, which is just lights out.”\nRios, who until this month was the longest-tenured active big leaguer without a postseason appearance (1,691 games), batted .255 with four home runs for a .640 OPS that was the third-worst in the last quarter-century of any right fielder with 400 plate appearances.\n© John E. Sokolowski, USA TODAY Sports Unorthodox trio carries Royals to cusp of WS “I told him before the game, ‘You’re going to have a great game today,’” Yost said. “I don’t know why I felt it. But he sure did.”\nSome of the Royals’ success isn’t entirely explicable, but it sure keeps happening.\nPHOTOS: BEST OF THE ALCS\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.usatoday.com/sports/", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T21:04:57.240+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
