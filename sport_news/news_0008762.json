But Santiago and the Boca Raton offense made some adjustments at halftime and pulled away for the win, which gives the Bobcats their best start since the 2008 team was 7-0.\nHill was a workhorse in the backfield, lugging the football 29 of Boca Raton's 35 running plays. He culminated his night with a 5-yard touchdown run on the Bobcats' final possession of the game.\n\"The offensive line did a great job and opened up the running game in the second half,\" Davis said.\nSantiago threw touchdown passes of 30 yards and 4 yards to Jeremy Reynolds and Shermar Moore, respectively, in the first half and connected on a 5-yard touchdown toss to Xavier Morley in the third quarter that gave Boca Raton a 21-7 lead.\nGabe Bravo kicked a 33-yard field goal to account for Boca Raton's other points.\nDanny Montero caught a 7-yard touchdown pass from Chris Nazien for Lake Worth's only touchdown. The Trojans were limited to 126 yards total offense by Boca Raton's defense, which also forced two turnovers.\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-5621b751/turbine/fl-boca-raton-lake-worth-recap-1017-20151016"], "published": "2015-10-17T03:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T16:43:39.257+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
