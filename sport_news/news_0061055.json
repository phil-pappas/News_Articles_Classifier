And he’s bringing his hammer with him. \nWhen the Columbus Blue Jackets announced that they had fired head coach Todd Richards and replaced him with John Tortorella, the message being sent was crystal clear: things are about to change. \nRichards had been too soft with a Blue Jackets team that started the season 0-7-0. That will certainly not be the case with Tortorella, who despite losing a high-profile job with the Vancouver Canucks a year ago, is not expected to tone down his iron-fisted coaching style. \n“Don’t blow everything up,” Tortorella said last month after being announced as Team USA’s head coach for the World Cup of Hockey. “Don’t blow your philosophy up because it was a tough year. You still need to have confidence in yourself, and stay with your convictions and philosophy.” \nIn other words, Columbus players can expect more chastising than coddling with Tortorella behind the bench. \nDescribed as a tyrant who picks fights with the media and opposing coaches — he was suspended for 15 games in 2013-14 when he tried to confront Calgary Flames head coach Bob Hartley during an intermission — Tortorella only knows how to coach one way: the hard way. \nHe barks, threatens and gets in players’ faces. He throws his goaltender under the bus and then for good measure backs it over him. It is a coaching style that led the Tampa Bay Lightning win a Stanley Cup in 2004 and also guided the New York Rangers to the Eastern Conference final in 2011-12. \n“John’s had a lot of success, but what I was most intrigued by was that he was willing to admit he’d made mistakes,” said Team USA GM Dean Lombardi. “He freely opened up as far as mistakes he’d made with players, maybe even times with his system, as well as the media. That takes a lot.” \nThe short-fused and short-tempered Tortorella saw his method blow up in his face when the Canucks fired the 57-year-old after missing the playoffs in 2013-14. And with more and more iron-fisted coaches being replaced with player-friendly coaches, some wondered if a coach who was unwilling to change with the times had coached his last game in the NHL. \n“I’m still just as demanding as I’ve ever been in playing the game right, but I think as you get older, what you don’t do is carry it with you the next day,” said St. Louis Blues head coach Ken Hitchcock. “You move on very quickly when you get experience. You learn not to carry things with you, whether it’s anger, disappointment or frustration. That’s what experience does. \n“If I can’t move on, I stay home. There’s no point in coming to the rink if I don’t have a hopeful attitude.” \nA coaching change inherently brings about hope. But there was a reason why Tortorella was chosen ahead of, say, Peter Horachek. \nThe Blue Jackets need to be pushed and prodded. You do not fire a coach less than two weeks into the season unless you believe drastic measures need to be taken. Clearly, a fire needs to be lit, because Columbus has all the pieces to be competitive. But for whatever reason, it just was not happening. \nSo they hired Tortorella, even though it meant giving Vancouver a second-round draft pick because he was still under contract by the Canucks. \n“I think players want to be pushed,” said Hall of Fame head coach Scotty Bowman. “Good players do. The real top guys have said that. Nobody likes it, but I think players appreciate somebody who wants to get the most out of them. You have to be fair about it, but they want to be pushed to the limit.” \nTortorella will have to do more than just push the players. He needs to get Sergei Bobrovsky (5.07 goals against average and .835 save percentage) to play better. He needs to help Ryan Johansen (one goal in seven games) find the back of the net. And most importantly, he needs to get the Blue Jackets back in the win column. \nChances are, he’ll do it by offering the stick before the carrot. \n“I understand the concept of the iron-fisted coach, but at the same time I don’t think anyone’s come off the hammer,” said Winnipeg Jets head coach Paul Maurice. “If anything, there might be more of it now because of video. It’s more hands-on. You can tell what’s going wrong easily.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T18:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T22:48:53.877+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
