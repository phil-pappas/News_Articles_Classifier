Quarterback Michael Brewer was active after breaking his collarbone back in August but did not start. He did get in however in the fourth quarter and threw four times completing three of those passes with one going for a touchdown and one for an interception. \nTech made it a back-n-forth game the whole way but after Tech scored a touchdown to cut Miami's lead to 23-20 midway through the fourth quarter, Brad Kaaya led a nine-play drive and capped it by throwing a 2-yard touchdown pass to Rashawn Scott with 2:44 to go. \nThe Hokies will be back home Saturday as they will play host to Duke.
