(AP Photo/Patrick Semansky) \nThe boos came early on Sunday at FedEx Field. They could be heard after the Redskins, who already trailed 7-0, failed to pick up a yard for a first down on consecutive plays on their second possession. Boos rain after #Redskins can't covert on 2nd and 1 and 3rd and 1. \n— Master Tesfatsion (@MasterTes) October 25, 2015 \nThe boos grew louder as a 7-point deficit ballooned to a 24-0 hole midway through the second quarter. The Redskins scored a touchdown before halftime, but players were showered with boos as they headed to the locker room. \nQuarterback Kirk Cousins heard them. \n“You certainly don’t want to hear them,” Cousins said after leading the Redskins to a 31-30 comeback win . “They paid for their ticket. They can do what they want. But I heard cheers at the end. That’s all that matters.” \n[ Kirk Cousins was very fired up after the Redskins’ win ] \nLinebacker Keenan Robinson heard the boos, too, and he called out booing fans on Twitter after the game. To the fans that started \"booing\" and then left in the 1st half when we were down 24-7. Best believe we saw and heard all of it \n— Keenan Robinson (@KeenanRobinson1) October 25, 2015 If yall so fed up then stay at home. We lay it all on the line every time we play. The opposing teams get paid too. Its the NFL for a reason \n— Keenan Robinson (@KeenanRobinson1) October 25, 2015 I have some tickets and a pair of signed game worn cleats for some of you positive fans for the next home game \n— Keenan Robinson (@KeenanRobinson1) October 25, 2015 👀👀.. *pulls chair up* *turns up volume* *takes handful of popcorn* https://t.co/t3c1SCLvJl \n— Will Compton (@_willcompton) October 25, 2015 \nMeanwhile, Redskins nose tackle Terrance Knighton wanted to explain something to fans who might consider booing him for not piling up gaudy statistics. Knighton had two total tackles on Sunday and is still seeking his first sack with Washington. Ima say this and say this once. My job is not to make 10 tackles and have 3 sacks. I get damn near double teamed every play. Selfless player \n— Terrance Knighton (@MisterRoast98) October 25, 2015 Ima rock wit the majority of this great fan base. These trolls will get no love from the roast 😂😂😂😂. Block button in full effect \n— Terrance Knighton (@MisterRoast98) October 25, 2015 \nCousins apparently wasn’t the only one feeling feisty after an incredible comeback.
