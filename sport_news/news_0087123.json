East with an all-too-familiar foe: the Jets. On paper, this promises to be a matchup not unlike so many of the Patriots-Jets games in recent years, centered on a stingy, rugged Jets defense taking on a high-flying Patriots offense. Entering this game, the Patriots’ offense ranks as the N.F.L.’s highest-scoring unit, averaging 36.6 points per game. The Jets’ defense ranks as the league’s best, giving up an average of only 15 points. Something, as they say, has to give. As always, it should be a blast to watch. The matchup also features an interesting side story: Patriots quarterback Tom Brady squaring off against Jets cornerback Darrelle Revis. Revis played against Brady many times as a member of Rex Ryan’s Jets squads, but he also helped Brady and the Patriots win a Super Bowl last season. The two stars now find themselves back in more familiar roles. While the Patriots and the Jets have given us all some memorable nail-biters, the rivalry has been lopsided in the Brady/Bill Belichick era. Brady is 20-5 against the Jets as a starter in the regular season, 10-2 against them at home. The game will be a homecoming of sorts for the former Patriots running back Stevan Ridley, who practiced for the first time this week after sustaining a knee injury last season. His return to health should only strengthen a Jets backfield that leads the league with 146 rushing yards per game. If the Jets can control the ball against New England, which has at times had problems stopping the run, they have a shot to spoil their rivals’ bid for another perfect regular season. PICK: PATRIOTS Eagles (3-3) at Panthers (5-0) 8:30 p.m. Line: Panthers by 3 Four games into the 2015 season, the Eagles were 1-3 and fans were calling for Coach Chip Kelly’s head. Speculation ran wild about which college program Kelly might helm next year after receiving his walking papers in Philadelphia. But with two straight wins, including a 27-7 throttling of their division rival Giants, the Eagles sit atop the N.F.C. East. Their offense, which struggled mightily in its first four games, averaged 472 yards in its last two (it averaged only 294 in its first four). In short, the Eagles are looking like the Eagles many expected coming into this season. And they are doing it despite the poor play of quarterback Sam Bradford, who tossed three interceptions against the Giants and is second in the league in interceptions over all with nine. Bradford does not seem to have any grasp on what his problems are. “If I knew, I would stop throwing them,” Bradford said after beating the Giants. “It is something that I never really had a problem with in my career. I have never thrown a lot of interceptions, so this is kind of new to me.” Panthers quarterback Cam Newton, on the other hand, has looked like an M.V.P. contender of late, especially after leading his team to victory in Seattle last week with two late drives after trailing by 20-7. It should be noted that he is doing it with a group of receivers the average N.F.L. fan probably could not identify in a lineup, outside of maybe tight end Greg Olsen. PICK: PANTHERS Cowboys (2-3) at Giants (3-3) 4:25 p.m. Line: Giants by 4 Rumors began swirling early in the week that Dez Bryant, the Cowboys’ star wide receiver, might miraculously return to the field this week after sustaining a broken foot in Week 2. The source of those rumors? None other than the Cowboys’ owner, Jerry Jones. “We’ll take a real good look at him tomorrow and Thursday,” Jones said in a radio interview. “It totally depends on how he’s doing. He had a good end of the week last week. He got in some really good work. He didn’t have much negative response from that work. It was strenuous work, the kind that if he can step out here and have a couple of really good days of practice then you could see him go.” The reality is that it is unlikely Bryant will be anywhere near ready to play Sunday, giving him more time to spend with the pet monkey he has adopted, which he named Dallas Bryant. PICK: GIANTS Saints (2-4) at Colts (3-3) 1 p.m. Line: Colts by 4.5 As if a 2-4 start weren’t bad enough, the Saints were personally touched by the troublesome crime wave that has made headlines in New Orleans, and nationally, of late — masked bandits have been robbing employees and patrons of restaurants and bars at gunpoint, and a wealthy French Quarter resident established a private police force to patrol the streets — when Joe Vitt, the team’s linebackers coach, tore an Achilles’ tendon and broke a wrist fending off car thieves. “Joe Vitt is on the injury report,” Saints Coach Sean Payton told the news media. “He’s on a little scooter. You’ll see him out there.” On the bright side for New Orleans, the team is coming off its most impressive outing of the season — a 31-21 victory against Atlanta — and the Colts are probably still trying to shake off the humiliation of the worst fake punt of all time. PICK: SAINTS Steelers (4-2) at Chiefs (1-5) 1 p.m. Line: Steelers by 2 Conventional wisdom would very likely hold that the Steelers’ success or failure in this game hinges on whether Ben Roethlisberger will be able to play now that Michael Vick is out with a hamstring injury. But the Steelers’ defense and running game seem capable of keeping the team in any game, so if the third-string quarterback Landry Jones winds up under center, you might want to think twice before betting against Pittsburgh. It does indeed look as if Jones will be the starter in Kansas City, even though Roethlisberger practiced during the week. Jones looked good in relief of Vick last week, completing 8 of 12 passes for 168 yards and two touchdowns in a win over the Cardinals. And according to some of his teammates, he may be in a better position to succeed than Vick was when he took over. “Landry kind of plays a lot like Ben with check downs and things like that, so he kind of knows where I’m at at times,” running back Le’Veon Bell said. “Obviously it was a little different with Vick because he didn’t always know where the check down was and he’s kind of new to the offense.” On the other side, the 2015 Chiefs seem to be even more of a lost cause without running back Jamaal Charles, who is out for the year with a knee injury. The team was held to season lows in rushing yards and points in a loss to the Vikings last week. PICK: STEELERS Share This Page Photo Something will have to give when James Jones and the Packers face other presently undefeated teams in the coming weeks. Credit Matt Ludtke/Associated Press 2015-10-25T11:24:48-04:00 October 25, 2015 11:24 AM ET The N.F.L. is making a parody out of the idea that it is a league defined by parity. For the first time in its history, five teams remain undefeated through six weeks. The Green Bay Packers, the Denver Broncos and the Cincinnati Bengals are 6-0, while the New England Patriots and the Carolina Panthers are 5-0. A parity-driven league could be defined as one in which all teams have similar records or one in which the top teams vary from year to year; right now, neither definition can be applied. The Panthers have made the playoffs in each of the past two seasons, making them the closest thing to an upstart among the unbeaten franchises. Both the Broncos and the Bengals have made it to the postseason in four consecutive years, while the Packers and the Patriots have made the playoffs in six straight seasons. Right now, the odds overwhelmingly favor each franchise making it to the playoffs again. Before 2015, there had been only one season in which even four teams emerged with perfect records through six weeks. That was in 2009, when the Minnesota Vikings, the New Orleans Saints and the Indianapolis Colts started undefeated and went on to play in their conference championship games. The fourth team that year, the Broncos, began 6-0 but finished 8-8 and out of the playoffs. In part, scheduling luck has helped these teams remain undefeated; the four head-to-head games among this group were all scheduled for November and December. In two weeks, the Packers will travel to Denver, and a week later, Green Bay heads to Carolina. At the end of November, the Patriots visit Denver, and the Broncos host the Bengals at the end of December. The Patriots, the Bengals and the Packers are perfect largely because of stellar quarterback play: Tom Brady, Andy Dalton and Aaron Rodgers are the three leaders in passer rating through six weeks. The Broncos are led by a dominant defense that has scored a touchdown in four of six games while leading the N.F.L. in sacks (26), turnovers (17) and yards allowed per play (4.3). Carolina’s success is not so neatly defined, but strong defense, excellent fourth-quarter play from quarterback Cam Newton and a friendly schedule has helped the Panthers remain unbeaten. The Patriots and the Panthers host the Jets and the Philadelphia Eagles next weekend, while the other three undefeated teams have byes. That means these five teams could remain unbeaten through seven weeks, a mind-boggling number in a league that is known for its parity.
