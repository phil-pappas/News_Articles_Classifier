With two outs and the Mets leading, 3-2, baserunner Michael Conforto took off from first and batter Wilmer Flores lashed a line drive into short right field.\nAdChoices Cubs outfielder Jorge Soler charged in on the ball and made a diving effort, but missed it entirely, giving the Mets what appeared to be a certain insurance run as Conforto jogged around third.\nBut wait! The ball rolled all the way to the wall in right field, and when it got there, Wrigley Field’s ivy swallowed it right up. Center fielder Dexter Fowler, who had rushed over to play the ball, smartly threw his hands up in the air instead of attempting to play the ball.\nBy Wrigley Field’s ground rules, any ball that gets stuck in the ivy is a ground-rule double. So even though Tejada would have easily gotten to third — at least — he was pointed back to second, and Conforto returned to third, erasing the run.\nThis made Mets manager Terry Collins very mad, but the rules are the rules.\nMets fans apparently let the Cubs know how they felt about the play on Twitter:\nThank you all for your groundskeeping advice.\n— Chicago Cubs (@Cubs) October 21, 2015\n© Provided by USA Today Sports (USA Today Sports Images) © Provided by USA Today Sports (USA TODAY Sports Images)\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/Cubs/status/656651849307725828", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BB6qRzt.img&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Murphy", "http://ui.bamstatic.com/120sports/util/embed/ots.embed.js&quot;}", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/b?&quot;,&quot;Category&quot;:&quot;baseball_mlb&quot;},&quot;Mute&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;HomePageLink&quot;:&quot;//www.msn.com/en-us&quot;,&quot;GeofenceUseSps&quot;:&quot;false&quot;,&quot;GeofenceEnabled&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;AutoPlay&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;AutoPlay&quot;:true,&quot;Mute&quot;:true,&quot;SwfCacheRefreshTime&quot;:86400,&quot;AdConfig&quot;:{&quot;FWFlashProfile&quot;:&quot;188286:MSN_US_AS3_LIVE&quot;,&quot;FWHtml5Profile&quot;:&quot;188286:MSN_HTML5_Live&", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BBmgPz5.img&quot;}},{&quot;csId&quot;:&quot;BB2D59E&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;Daniel", "http://www.usatoday.com/sports/", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BBmgUVK.img&quot;}}", "http://c.120sportsstatic.com/gen/client/rss/timeline.xml&quot;},{&quot;ns&quot;:&quot;ignore_this_version&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;System.Collections.Generic.List`1", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BB6qRzt.img&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Mets", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BBmgXCQ.img&quot;}},{&quot;csId&quot;:&quot;BB2D59E&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;The", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BB6qRzt.img&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Wrigley&#39;s", "http://ui.bamstatic.com/120sports/util/embed/ots.embed.js&quot;,&quot;tags&quot;:", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BB6qRzt.img&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Ivy", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAfBtjr.img&quot;}}"], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T21:03:12.752+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
