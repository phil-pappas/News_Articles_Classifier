Not his fellow offensive linemen, not his blocking assignments along Cincinnati's defensive front, and perhaps most importantly, his quarterback Tanner Mangum.\nHoyt saw most of the reps at right tackle during last Saturday's 38-24 win over Cincinnati after Mathews, a senior, went down with an injury early in the contest. Although he admits to feeling a bit nervous at first, the 6-foot-8, 270-pound freshman didn't miss a beat.\n“It was a lot of fun just to get in there,” Hoyt said. “When Ryker went down I just went in and worked on what I’ve been coached on all week and it was a lot of fun. I thought I played well, but there’s always things to work on to keep improving.”\nAlso having fun, again, was fellow freshman Mangum, who was able to operate within the pocket and go through his progressions without much disruption. Given that he was playing with a gimpy hamstring, Hoyt's work, along with the rest of the offensive linemen's, was much appreciated.\n“They did awesome,” Mangum said. “It’s hard to tell if it’s the best they’ve played, but they did great. Just watching the film, you could tell they were working hard and I hardly got touched.”\nWhat's remarkable about Mangum going largely unscathed during his 32 dropbacks was that the offensive front wasn't down just Mathews, but also had to make do without starting left tackle Lui Lapuaho. On that side, it was junior Brad Wilcox filling in and effectively protecting Mangum's blindside.\nAltogether the offensive line gave up zero sacks on the game, a great accomplishment for any offensive front, but particularly so for BYU 's, when considering the two significant parts it was operating without.\nOn Wednesday, offensive line coach Garett Tujague was asked about his position group's performance to date, coming off of what many consider its best collective effort.\n“I was excited with the way we performed,\" Tujague said. \"There are things we need to improve (but) to say I’m surprised by how they responded would not be accurate. That’s what I expect them to do.”\nAs for his two fill-ins at tackle, Tujague is pleased with what he's seen and how Wilcox and Hoyt are progressing.\n“I thought Brad last spring did a really good job of setting his name at the tackle spot. He struggled a little in fall camp but it was nice to see him rebound and play well,\" Tujague said. \"With Austin, it will be a lot of fun to see what happens with a good offseason with him. Athletically, I’m very pleased with him.”\nWilcox has had some time to develop within the program since returning home from his LDS Church mission service to San Bernadino (California) in 2012. For Hoyt, he's only been home from his mission service for eight months and only recently began feeling up to the task playing effectively.\n“Athletically, I feel like I was before the mission,” Hoyt, who served his mission to Denver, said. “I’m working on getting a little bit bigger because I’m pretty skinny right now.it took the whole summer to get my legs under me and back in shape.”\nBoth Wilcox and Hoyt are expected to reprise their roles as starting tackles this week against Wagner, although both Lapuaho and Mathews are expected to return for the San Jose State game on Nov. 6.\nAnother offensive lineman who has battled through injuries, but has seen increasing playing time is guard Tuni Kanuch. the former Bingham product played at left guard throughout last Saturday's game and is expected to start this week against Wagner.\n“A guy who’s totally stepped up his game in October is Tuni,\" Tujague said. \"He’s done an amazing job of battling and giving up push in the run game. He does a good job of getting people targeted in the right place. He’s fun to be around.”\nEmail: bgurney@desnews.com \nTwitter: @BrandonCGurney", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T17:30:51.120+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
