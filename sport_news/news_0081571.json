Coach Todd Bowles said he is \"not sure\" if Decker will be healthy enough to play against the Dolphins.\nStar cornerback Darrelle Revis, who left in the fourth quarter of the Philadelphia game because of a hamstring injury, practiced on a limited basis and said he felt fine. Bowles said he is hopeful that Revis and running back Chris Ivory (quadriceps) will be able to play Sunday. Ivory also was limited in practice.\nBowles also said he doesn’t expect tight end Jeff Cumberland to play. Cumberland suffered a concussion against the Eagles, and still is in the NFL’s concussion protocol. The Jets would rather not have him on a seven-hour flight in that condition.\nWithout Cumberland, the Jets would have only one tight end, blocking specialist Kellen Davis, available for the game. Bowles acknowledged it’s possible the Jets could promote undrafted free agent tight end Wes Saxton from the practice squad. There is a spot available on the 53-man roster because the Jets waived nose tackle Deon Simon, a seventh-round pick.\nBriefs \nBowles was asked about safety Dion Bailey, whom the Jets claimed off waivers from Seattle. He started the first two games for the Seahawks but was cut after Kam Chancellor ended his holdout. \"Dion is a good football player,\" Bowles said. \"He did some things that we liked. He was a guy for future reference that we wanted to get our hands on.\" … Miami LT BrandenAlbert (hamstring) returned to practice on a limited basis. He sat out the blowout loss to Buffalo.\n— J.P.
