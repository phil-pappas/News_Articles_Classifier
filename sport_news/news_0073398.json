It was an amazing atmosphere, and to pull out a win in front of them makes me feel really good about our team.” \nAli Dowdall led all players with 23 digs while Alisha Hinrichs posted her first career double-double with 23 assists and 10 digs. Hinrichs was the Trojans’ primary setter for the first two sets, then gave way to Reina Terry who finished with 26 assists in the final three sets. \nPamela Soriano led Florida A&M with 17 kills, but also had 10 errors and hit just .152. Valeria Lopez posted a match-high 47 assists for the Lady Rattlers. \nThe Trojans return to the court and to Sun Belt play this weekend when they travel to take on ULM and UL Lafayette on Friday and Saturday, respectively. Troy just defeated both the Warhawks and Ragin’ Cajuns last weekend at home. \nHawks get 3-0 win over Piedmont \nHuntingdon picked up its first USA South Athletic Conference win of the season with a 3-0 win over Piedmont College on Tuesday night. \nThe 25-19, 25-23 and 25-20 win snapped a 28-match conference losing streak for the Hawks and a 10-match losing streak to Piedmont. This was the first win over the Lions since 2010. \n“I’m extremely proud of our girls,” Huntingdon head coach Latonia Allen said. “They wanted it so badly tonight. We have come so close in matches this season, losing in four games and five games. The girls understand how close we have been to winning those matches and there were just a few little things we needed to fix. \nJunior Kalen Morgan finished with 10 kills and 11 digs for Huntingdon (8-16, 1-8 USA South). Cora Murchison recorded 39 assists and nine digs and Lauren Condon had 17 digs. \nBria Rochelle led the team with 16 kills and recorded eight digs. Audrianna Hargitt tallied 15 kills.
