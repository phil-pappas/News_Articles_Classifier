We don’t talk about championships much. If we do, we talk about it in terms of the process,” added Cone, whose team has done well in their preseason games, including a 92-81 win over defending champion San Miguel Beer last Wednesday at the CCF gym in Pasig City.\n“We’re trying to get the idea of that we’re working on an end result. We need to figure the process and if we do it correctly, the result will take care of itself just to try to be process oriented,” he said.\nThis is the second time in his coaching career that Cone will be starting all over again with a new team, or since he left Alaska in 2011 after nearly 23 years and 13 titles, to join B-Meg (now the Star Hotshots).\nIt took some time for the franchise led by James Yap to figure out Cone’s system of “triangle offense” that included a painful loss to Powerade when the No. 1 twice-to-beat B-Meg lost in the quarterfinal playoffs.\nB-Meg finally won its first title with Cone the following conference when import Denzel Bowles helped the team to the Commissioner’s Cup title, but the team lost to Rain or Shine in the Governors’ Cup finals.\nThe following year, after failed attempts to make the finals of the Philippine Cup and Commissioner’s Cup, B-Meg became the San Mig Super Coffee Mixers and avenged their defeat to Rain or Shine by winning the Governor’s Cup, followed by a Grand Slam feat the next season.\nHowever, Cone and the Hotshots failed to defend any of their three championships last season.\nNow, he is with a team that knows his trademark Triangle Offense since Ginebra was once handled by a Cone student and former player in Jeff Carisao. Aside from that, Cone has Ginebra point guard LA Tenorio – his former playmaker with Alaska.\nAlso, Cone will handle a team that has the twin tower combination of 7-footer center Greg Slaughter and 6-foot-10 forward Japeth Aguilar, and talented players like Mark Caguioa, Jayjay Helterbrand, Sol Mercado, Chris Ellis and Joe Devance, who was acquired from Star in a three-team trade.", "external_links": ["http://i.po.st/static/v3/post-widget.js#publisherKey=4qcr4d26tnrf260rqrda&retina=true"], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T20:40:39.500+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
