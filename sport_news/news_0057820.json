Cook passed for 139 yards and a touchdown while going over the 7,000-yard mark for his career but the Spartans nearly squandered a 21-point lead. \nFreshman running back Markell Jones gained a career-high 157 yards on 22 carries and scored twice, including a 68-yard touchdown run, for Purdue. \nNo. 25 Florida 38, No. 3 Mississippi 10 \nWith freshman quarterback Will Grier and a fast, hard-hitting defense sharing starring roles, the Gators thumped the Rebels in a stunning Southeastern Conference mismatch. \nFlorida established a 25-0 halftime lead as Grier threw four touchdown passes, then cruised through the second half as its defense throttled the high-scoring Ole Miss offense at almost every turn. \nGrier completed 24 of 29 passes for 271 yards for Florida, which figures to soar up the rankings after perhaps its biggest win since Urban Meyer was presiding over national titles in 2006 and 2008. \nNo. 4 TCU 50, Texas 7 \nFORT WORTH, Texas -- The Horned Frogs thoroughly dismantled the Longhorns, leaving a wide chasm between the two Big 12 rivals. \nTrevon Boykin set a new school record for career touchdown passes after throwing for five -- four going to freshman receiver KaVontae Turpin. \nTCU's senior Heisman candidate was able to pick out his targets on his way to 332 yards in three quarters of work. \nNo. 5 Baylor 63, Texas Tech 35 \nARLINGTON, Texas -- The Bears' Big 12-opener looked pretty familiar for the two-time defending conference champions. \nBears quarterback Seth Russell passed for 286 yards and four touchdowns, and running back Shock Linwood rushed for 221 yards and two TDs on 20 carries. \nTexas Tech quarterback Pat Mahomes passed for 415 yards and three touchdowns. However, he was intercepted twice, and the Red Raiders lost two fumbles. Texas Tech was also penalized 17 times for 142 yards. \nArizona State 38, No. 7 UCLA 23 â€¹previous", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T13:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T13:52:09.605+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
