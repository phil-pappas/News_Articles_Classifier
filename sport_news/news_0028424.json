Sheldon Richardson got to eat right away, just as he hoped. Well, a little bit anyway.\nThe Jets' star defensive lineman returned from his four-game suspension in Sunday's 34-20 win over Washington , and he found himself on the stat sheet with half a sack. He split the sack of Kirk Cousins with Muhammad Wilkerson.\n\"Apparently we beat our lineman at the same time,\" Richardson said. \"I looked up and he's on the sack too.\"\n\"Bittersweet,\" he joked. \"But I'm glad he got it with me.\"\nMANISH MEHTA'S INSTANT ANALYSIS: JETS 34, WASHINGTON 20\nThough Todd Bowles had said that Richardson needed to get back into football shape, the third-year defensive lineman ended up playing quite a bit.\n\"He gave us some energy while he was in there,\" Bowles said. \"He still has to get in football shape. There were a couple where I forgot about him, probably left him in there to play too long.\"\n\"Not like I was dog-dead tired and if I was, I came off,\" he said.\nThe Jets, normally a 3-4 team, played some 4-3, which got Richardson in the game at the same time as Wilkerson, Damon Harrison and Leonard Williams.\n\"It wasn't just to accommodate Sheldon from a game plan standpoint,\" he said. \"Most of their run game is based off the double-team and people getting up to the linebackers on the second level. We thought we could take that away and put another guy down. They couldn't handle all of them.\"\nFOLLOW THE DAILY NEWS SPORTS ON FACEBOOK. \"LIKE\" US HERE.\nSECURITY ISSUES\nThough the Jets again relied heavily on Brandon Marshall and Eric Decker in the passing game, each ended up with a fumble. Marshall had the ball taken away from him by Bashaud Breeland.\n\"He stripped me,\" Marshall said. \"I saw the linebacker coming and kind of took my eye off the guy that was on me. He already had both his hands on it. I guess I've got to get in the weight room.\"\nINJURY REPORT\nBuster Skrine left Sunday's game with a concussion. He was replaced by Dexter McDougle as the nickel cornerback. Bilal Powell suffered a sprained ankle.\nCHECK OUT OUR NEW APP: GET THE DAILY NEWS ON ANDROID OR iOS\nSTAYING DISCIPLINED\nTodd Bowles took care of the team's penalty problems from the last time they played. Two weeks ago against the Dolphins, the Jets had 14 penalties. On Sunday, it was a mere one.\n\"It's a big switch, especially coming off a bye,\" Bowles said. \"Our coaches harped on it.\"\nRelated Stories Jets beat up on Washington, improve to 4-1 with 34-20 win Beat-up Giants still confident thanks to Eli Manning Brandon Marshall tweets support for Mets with Yankees hat Tags: sheldon richardson , buster skrine", "external_links": ["http://images.performgroup.com/namedImage/12637/install_flash.gif", "http://static.eplayer.performgroup.com/flash/js/swfobject.js", "http://nydn.us/app", "https://www.facebook.com/NYDNSports", "http://www.adobe.com/go/getflashplayer", "http://static.eplayer.performgroup.com/flash/js/performgroup.js"], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T04:28:37.673+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
