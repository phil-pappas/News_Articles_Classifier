A person with knowledge of the deal tells The Associated Press it is a four-year extension worth $44 million. It could reach $48 million with incentives. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because the team does not disclose contract terms.\nThe 24-year-old Henson averaged 7.0 points, 4.7 rebounds and 2.0 blocks in 18 minutes per game last season. The deal ensures that Henson will remain a core member of a young team on the rise as he enters his fourth season in the league.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
