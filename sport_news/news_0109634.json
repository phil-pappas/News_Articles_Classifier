Posted: Monday, October 19, 2015 8:34 pm Colts try to move past embarrassing blunder By George Bremer | The Herald Bulletin Herald Bulletin Posted on Oct 19, 2015 \nANDERSON â€” The Indianapolis Colts became a national punchline Monday. \nAnd the wound was self-inflicted. \nMemes featuring the fateful fourth-down snap from wide receiver Griff Whalen to safety Colt Anderson dominated the sports-centric corners of the Internet, and head coach Chuck Pagano continued to take the blame for miscommunication that led to one of the worst executed trick plays in NFL history. \n\"Not pleased obviously with the way that we prepared the guys or coached the guys to go out and execute the play,\" Pagano told media at the Indiana Farm Bureau Football Center. \"That's on me. I talked about that with great length, and I've got to be better. I don't regret the play call at all.\" \nIt's certainly a moment few witnesses ever will forget. \nOn fourth-and-3 from their own 37-yard line Sunday night, Whalen and Anderson lined up well to left of the rest of the punt team as the third quarter wound down. Pagano said the object was to get the New England Patriots to burn a timeout or be caught in a situation that would result in a penalty. \nInstead, Anderson was taken to the ground by a pair of defenders shortly after the ball was snapped to him and the Colts were flagged for illegal formation after the entire right side contingent failed to line up on the line of scrimmage. \nThe disaster handed the Patriots the ball at the Colts' 35-yard line, and Tom Brady threw an 11-yard touchdown pass to LeGarrette Blount six plays later to push the visitors' lead to 34-21. Indianapolis lost 34-27, continuing its string of fruitless efforts against the Pats. \n\"It's one play,\" Anderson said in the locker room Monday. \"It ended up being a big play. It's tough for everyone. I just happened to be out there. When I'm in there, I got to take charge and I got to be a better communicator.\" \nThe Colts' challenge now is quickly moving past the mistake. \nIndianapolis (3-3) hosts a New Orleans Saints team this week that is coming off an upset victory against the previously unbeaten Atlanta Falcons and has shown signs of rediscovering its old offensive flair. \nA Colts defense that struggled to put pressure on Brady now must prepare for Drew Brees, one of the most accurate passers in league annals. \nAnd the schedule ahead gets no easier. A trip to unbeaten Carolina is on tap Nov. 2, and Indianapolis hosts unbeaten Denver on Nov. 8 before entering the bye week. When they return Nov. 22, the Colts will travel to Atlanta. Those three opponents currently have a combined record of 16-1. \nSo now is not the time for pointing fingers or questioning leadership. \nQuarterback Andrew Luck, who returned after a 21-day injury layoff with 312 passing yards and three touchdowns against New England, said that won't be a problem. \n\"I think everybody in this locker room has each other's back,\" he said. \"Everyone in this building has each other's back. We all buy into the plan, and that's the way it is. The second-guessing is for the media and the fans to do, and that's also the beauty of sports is that everybody has an opinion. And that's great. But no second-guessing from this locker room. We're all in.\"  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T01:12:57.869+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
