He said it’s not just the offensive line. Harding noted that running backs are asked to protect at all times; the quarterbacks have done a nice job of knowing where the progression is and getting rid of the football; and the wide receivers are getting open.\n“The passing game involves all 11 people,” Harding said.\nCase in point, last week’s 54-yard touchdown pass from Travis Wilson to Cory Butler-Byrd in Utah’s 30-24 win over California. Harding pointed to a well-timed isolated block from running back Joe Williams for making it happen.\n“It’s a whole offensive accomplishment,” Harding said. “But we’ve got to be ready this week.”\nUtah’s opponent this week — Arizona State — recorded eight sacks against Colorado last Saturday.\nThe Utes counter with senior center Siaosi Aiono. He’s credited for being a “wizard” out on the field for adjusting protections and pointing out blitzes and such.\n“That dude is smart and you’ve got to give a lot of credit to him,” said starting right tackle J.J. Dielman. “Because he’s the brains of the organization. We just do what we’re told.”\nMISSION MAN: Freshman wide receiver Britain Covey made it clear this week that he is still planning to serve an LDS Church mission after the season — confirming such in a statement on Twitter. He’ll file his papers soon and hopes to depart in March.\n“I made the decision a long time ago, regardless of how well this season went for me and my team,” Covey’s tweet read in part. “. . . The Lord has blessed me with so much. For me personally, the least I can do is step away from football for a few years and focus on completely devoted service to Him.”\nCovey is currently second on the team with 17 receptions for 182 yards. He has two touchdown catches.\nMAKING AN IMPACT: Former Utah star Paris Warren , who was co-offensive MVP in the Fiesta Bowl victory along with Alex Smith , is back with the Utes this season as a student assistant while completing work on his degree. Whittingham said Warren is doing a great job assisting the receivers. He’s also been a good sounding board for running back Devontae Booker . Warren and Booker grew up in the same neighborhood in Sacramento, California, and call themselves “cousins” after developing a close friendship over the years.\n“We talk about everything,” Booker said.\nEXTRA POINTS: The Utah men’s and women’s basketball teams will be recognized during a break in Saturday’s game . . . Officials are already announcing that the 35th consecutive sellout crowd at Rice-Eccles Stadium will be on hand . . . The team will wear a “Ute Proud” decal on their helmets against ASU.\nEmail: dirk@desnews.com \nTwitter: @DirkFacer", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T17:11:16.570+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
