Flood served the final game of his suspension on Saturday during Rutgers' 31-24 loss to then-No. 4 Michigan State .\nFlood was banned from speaking to the media as part of the punishment levied by Rutgers president Robert Barchi on Sept. 16. Interim coach Norries Wilson handled the media responsibilities well in Flood's absence. Flood will return to the podium in the team's meeting room for a 12 p.m press conference on Monday.\nFlood will have plenty of questions to answer about an unprecedented penalty he received for violating a university policy that prohibits coaches from contacting professors about a player's grades.\nAn investigation by an independent law firm revealed that Flood emailed and met with a professor about changing the grade of cornerback Nadir Barnwell , who would have been ruled academically ineligible if his failing grade stood. The grade was not changed because members of Rutgers' academic support staff reported Flood's actions in August, which launched the month-long investigation. Barnwell was kicked off the team on Sept. 5 following his arrest on an assault charge.\nAs a result of the investigation, Barchi suspended Flood for three games and fined him $50,000. Flood's suspension only applied to game day, so he was able to coach the team the other six days of the week. Rutgers went 1-2 during Flood's absence; the results of the games during the suspension will count on Flood's career record .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T16:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T20:57:10.851+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
