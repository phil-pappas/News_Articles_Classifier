When asked if that was one of the worst of his 100 games in charge of Stoke, Hughes said: “It wasn’t one of my best. Losing defender Geoff Cameron to injury disrupted us. We had to make changes at the back. We didn’t deal with the two up front. We needed to be better than we were today. \n“Their two guys up front [Troy Deeney and Odion Ighalo] demand service and they managed to mess us around at the back. We will be better than that. At 1-0 down we tried to change things around because we couldn’t make any headway. We then made an individual error when Marc Wilson lost the ball leading up to the second goal.” NigeriaI striker ghalo has undoubtedly been Watford’s star man this season; he has been involved in each of Watford’s last seven Premier League goals (five goals, two assists), including the two assists for Deeney’s goals on Saturday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T22:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T22:40:42.729+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
