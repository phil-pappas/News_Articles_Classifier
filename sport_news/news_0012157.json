A general contractor who worked on the buildings that exploded in the East Village earlier this year pleaded guilty to bribery in an unrelated case Wednesday.\nDilber Kukic, 40, copped to bribery, a felony, in Manhattan Supreme Court Wednesday morning.\nHe admitted to handing off $600 to an undercover officer in the investigator's car in an effort to get violations cleared from a pair of buildings he owns on W. 173rd St. on an expedited basis.\nJustice Marcy Kahn offered a sentence of probation and 200 hours of community service in exchange for his admission.\nHe will also have to cough up a $4,000 fine.\nKukic's lawyer Mark Bederow said he believed prosecutors refused to offer his client a misdemeanor deal, like they had for other defendants, because of his ties to the March blast on Second Ave., in which authorities were probing whether a rigged gas line was the cause of the deadly inferno which leveled two buildings.\nJoe Marino/New York Daily News Kukic also worked on the buildings that exploded in the East Village earlier this year. Two people were killed in the seven alarm blast.\nKukic was on scene doing renovations on the day of the explosion and helped a person escape to safety, Bederow said.\nTo date, no one has been arrested in connection with the terrifying explosion, but the Manhattan District Attorney's office is still investigating, a source familiar with the probe said.\n“Mr. Kukic has adamantly declared his innocence with respect to that matter,” Bederow said.\nKukic had been one of a number of people — including city Department of Buildings employees and Housing Preservation and Development workers — arrested in February after a long-term investigation.\nJoe Marino/New York Daily News A member of the FDNY is removed from the scene of the Second Ave. explosion in March. Many lower-level offenders were allowed to plead to lesser charges, Bederow said.\nKukic is less culpable “in terms of the seriousness of the case, in terms of the amount of cash issued in the alleged bribery scheme,” Bederow argued in court.\nAccording to Kukic and his attorney, the work had been done to clear the violations. The money, Kukic understood, was to speed up the bureaucratic process of wiping them from the record.\n“It had been made apparent to me that the people's position for the jail recommendation in this case is not related in fact to the current case for which Mr. Kukic finds himself, but in actuality relates to the people's view or ongoing investigation of the East Village explosion from early spring,” Bederow said, and that’s “not an appropriate situation.”\nKahn sided with Bederow, offering Kukic a jail-free sentence as prosecutors insisted on six-months in jail.\nShe sentenced him to 200 hours of community service, and said, “My strong preference is that it be an organization that services the hungry.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T20:11:10.424+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
