It was Mora Rodriguez’s lone save for the Lions, who awoke from a sluggish start for a pair of second-half goals and a 2-0 Mother Lode League victory over the Wildcats Thursday night at Linden High. The Lions (12-2-4, 9-0-1 MLL) out-shot the Wildcats 29-6, but struggled a bit on a slippery pitch that contributed to numerous off-target shots. “Both teams were sliding around a little,” said Lions coach Hans Frey, whose squad earned its 10th consecutive victory. “We came out a little flat to start the game and our shots, which are normally on-target, were a little off.” Sonora (4-9-2, 3-5-1) played with extra defenders back after learning how quickly the Linden forwards can strike in its earlier league match and ventured forward on a few counter-attacks with little success that left the game scoreless at the intermission. Linden junior Aaron Gonzalez came off the bench early in the second half to take a corner kick after junior Jose Servin’s blast from his left was deflected away from the Sonora goal by Wildcats senior Anthony Prophet. Gonzalez put some touch on the ball that flew directly to senior Ulisis Lara, who headed the ball directly under Prophet for the 1-0 lead. Linden senior Jaime Cardona fired in a long throw from the left sideline in the 68th minute that senior Josef Polk leaped to reach for a header, but the ball instead deflected into the right side of the Wildcats goal off a Sonora defender’s head for the 2-0 lead. “(Linden) has a lot of talent on its team, but I thought our guys played hard,” Sonora coach Lloyd Longeway said. “I thought we had a couple of chances – that one right at the end – that was our best (scoring) chance. (The Lions) gave us a real thumping at home and we wanted to come down here and give them a good game and earn some respect and I think we did.” Prophet finished with six saves off seven Linden shots on goal, while Mora Rodriguez had one on Sonora’s only shot on frame. “It’s both difficult and different to play goalie,” said Mora Rodriguez, a senior exchange student from Colombia who leads the MLL in saves and goals against average. “It doesn’t matter if you haven’t seen a shot in the entire match, you have to be completely focused until the very end as happened in the match today when I had to make the (late) save.” By Scott Niendorf", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T06:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T01:19:16.567+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
