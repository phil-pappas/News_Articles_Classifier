It's a lot tougher from here. But we have a pretty good team, too.\"\nLeading 3-0 and with ace David Price on cruise control having retired 18 consecutive batters, Toronto looked poised to level the series until a Kansas City barrage of seventh inning singles during which Eric Hosmer, Mike Moustakas, Alex Gordon, Alex Rios and Kendrys Morales, on a fielder's choice, all drove in runs.\nThe inning began on an ominous note when Kansas City second baseman Ben Zobrist floated a soft pop fly into shallow right that left Ryan Goins and Jose Bautista staring at each other to make the easy catch as the ball fell fair.\nWith the two players running to make the catch Goins put up his glove, appearing to call off Bautista, but then stopped and dropped to the turf as the ball hit the ground between them.\n\"I put my glove up and was pretty much saying I'm going to make this play and I didn't so it's on me,\" Goins said.\n\"I put my glove up, that's our sign and it means I've got it, and just thought I heard something that I didn't.\"\nKansas City left fielder Gordon considered the mix-up the turning point of the game.\n\"He (Price) was cruising, we got that early at-bat. Price is a tough pitcher,\" Gordon said. \"I felt like we needed to catch a break and Zobrist's ball there I think got things going.\n\"Once this lineup gets moving, it's one guy after another, and it was a big seventh inning.\"\nAdded Gibbons: \"The way I saw it looked like Ryan kind of held him (Bautista) off a little bit and he might have backed Jose up a little bit and the ball dropped in.\n\"They were looking for that one crack because David was so good ... It's a shame it had to end that way.\"\nAfter Toronto opened the door the Royals did not look back, scoring five and adding another on a Moustakas RBI in the eighth.\nA regular Cy Young contender rated one of the best pitchers in baseball, Price has not produced the same results in the postseason, where he is 0-7 as a starter.\n\"The breaks didn't go our way,\" said Goins. \"We've been down two before and came back so we are going to Toronto (to) take three games.\nReuters", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T20:47:01.207+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
