(AP Photo/Lenny Ignelzi) \nLOS ANGELES — Los Angeles Dodgers right fielder Andre Ethier shouted at manager Don Mattingly in the bottom of the third inning of Game 5 of the NL Division Series on Thursday night. \nAfter Justin Turner led off the inning with a double, Ethier followed with a popup to left. \nEthier returned the dugout and began yelling at Mattingly while simultaneously walking away from him. Mattingly followed, and twice Ethier turned toward Mattingly and yelled at him while gesturing angrily with his arms, pointing twice at the field and twice directly at Mattingly. \n\"He was mad about the ump's call,\" Mattingly said. \"I was trying to settle him down. I didn't want him thrown out of the game, and Andre's pretty emotional. It was nothing more than trying to settle him down.\" \nAfter the Dodgers' 3-2 loss, which ended their season, Mattingly said he didn't think Ethier was angry with him. \n\"He's maybe yelling at me because I'm trying to settle him down, but it was nothing between us,\" Mattingly said. \nAll content copyright ©2015 The Tribune, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T06:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T07:12:46.215+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
