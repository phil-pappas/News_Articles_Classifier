As a restricted free agent, Moore would have had arbitration rights and been due a raise from his 2014-15 salary of $850,850. The Devils ended up signing him to a three-year, $5 million contract.\n\"You do get reminded a lot that it’s a business at the end of the day,\" Moore said. \"Our feedback from them was that my arbitration number would be just a little bit too high and that was that.\"\nMerrill out again \nDefenseman Jon Merrill missed his second consecutive game because of a stomach ailment. Merrill practiced Monday and took part in Tuesday’s skate, but still doesn’t have all of his energy back.\n\"I think it’s just I haven’t eaten much and I’m kind of run-down,\" Merrill said.\nCoach John Hynes said the decision to sit Merrill again was based on him not being 100 percent and liking the way the other six defensemen played Sunday.\nRuutu in boot \nRight wing Tuomo Ruutu also missed his second game in a row. The Devils still have not revealed the exact nature of Ruutu’s injury, but he was seen with a walking boot on his right foot.\nElias not close \nAlthough LW Patrik Elias, 39, continues to skate on his own and has been upping his activity, Hynes said \"he’s not close\" to being ready to practice with the team.\nElias (right knee) has been out since the start of training camp.\n— Tom Gulitti", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T04:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T08:41:32.176+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
