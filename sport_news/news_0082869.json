Johnson caught six passes for 166 yards for the Lions (1-5) while wide receiver Lance Moore had five receptions for 106 yards and a touchdown.\nThe teams traded scores in the final 21 seconds to send the game into overtime. Stafford hit Johnson with a 6-yard pass to put the Lions on top 34-31. The Bears tied it as time expired on Robbie Gould's fourth field goal, a 29-yarder, after they worked into position thanks to a pair of defensive pass interference penalties.\nChicago quarterback Jay Cutler passed for 353 yards and a touchdown. Matt Forte rushed for 69 yards and a touchdown for the Bears (2-4).\nBears wide receiver Alshon Jeffery, who sat out the previous four games with a hamstring injury, had eight receptions for 147 yards and a score.\nDetroit squandered an eight-point lead in the second quarter by committing three turnovers.\nThe Lions' second special teams giveaway early handed the ball to the Bears at the Lions 21 early in the fourth. Cutler's 17-yard pass to Jeffery cut Detroit's lead to 24-23.\nA few plays later, an ill-advised shovel pass attempt by Stafford was picked off by linebacker Jonathan Anderson at the Detroit 24. Forte scored on a two-yard run up the middle and also caught a pass from Cutler for the two-point conversion, giving the Bears a 31-24 lead with 7:50 remaining.\nPrater's 32-yard field goal with 2:46 left cut Chicago's lead to four prior to Johnson's go-ahead score.\nStafford threw three first-half touchdowns to give the Lions a 21-13 halftime lead.\nDetroit scored in the final minute of the half on a two-yard pass from Stafford to wide receiver Golden Tate.\nTate was stripped by cornerback Kyle Fuller on the play and the ball wound up in Anderson's hands. It was originally ruled a turnover but the replay official determined that Tate broke the plane before he lost the ball.\n(Editing by Steve Keating )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T01:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T01:01:52.424+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
