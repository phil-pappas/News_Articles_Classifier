The Nye County Sheriffâ€™s Department was called on Tuesday to Love Ranch, a legal brothel in Crystal, Nevada, for a report of an \"unresponsive\" man needing an ambulance, according to Sheriff Sharon A Wehrly.\n\n\nKhloe Kardashian and Lamar Odom \nThe sheriff said the man identified as Odom, was treated by physicians and taken to hospital in Nevada, before being transported to a Las Vegas hospital. The emergency call came from Richard Hunter, media director for Dennis Hof, who owns the Love Ranch and other brothels in Nevada, Wehrly said.\nThere were no further details on the condition of the 35-year-old, who had been reported by celebrity website TMZ to be \"fighting for his life\". Odom won NBA titles with the Los Angeles Lakers in 2009 and 2010, but last played in the league in 2013.\nMarriage \nHe married Kardashian in 2009 in a splashy televised wedding, but she filed for divorce in 2013. In August of that year, Odom, the subject of a string of news stories about alleged drug use and marriage troubles, was arrested for drunk driving. He last played in the NBA for the Los Angeles Clippers in the 2012-13 season, becoming a free agent in July of 2013.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T07:10:41.942+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
