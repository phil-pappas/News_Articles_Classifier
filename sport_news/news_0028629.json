(WKYT) ESPN quotes Skal Labissiere's guardian as saying the big man from Haiti is still seeking NCAA clearance. \n\"Not yet,\" Labissiere's guardian, Gerald Hamilton, told ESPN. \"We're just trying to get everything squared away. They are asking a few questions.\" \n\"They haven't cleared him, but we're sticking with our faith,\" he added. \"There's no real concern about anything from the Kentucky compliance people.\" \nUK spokesman Eric Lindsey told ESPN the school will not confirm eligibility of its players until game-day. Kentucky opens the season November 13 against Albany. Lindsey said Labissiere has been practicing. \nLabissiere came to this country from Haiti following the devastating earthquake in 2010. He played high school basketball in the Memphis, Tennessee area. After being ruled ineligible, he played his senior year for Reach Your Dream Prep, which Hamilton formed.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T06:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T16:46:57.901+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
