In the opening set, Fensler responded by winning five straight games to win 6-2. In the second set, Fensler again put together a string of wins, this time four of them, for a 5-2 lead. \nDeutsch would not close out his high school career so quietly and won two straight games to cut the lead to 5-4. Fensler held serve to finish the set and the match at 6-4. \n\"I think I made the most errors in that match that I have any time this season,\" said Fensler. \"I usually like to play to his backhand. Josh played really well. I missed a lot of the lobs he hit.\" \nLapel's quickest point came at No. 1 doubles where Daniel Conrad and Daulton Fensler combined to post a 6-1, 6-2 victory over Matt Etherington and Dane Hueston. It was really the only match where the Bulldogs enjoyed breathing room. \nThe Bulldogs' final point came at No. 2 singles as Joseph Conrad fell behind 5-4 in the opening set against the Tigers' Matthew Hensley. Hensley was serving the ball very well, but Conrad held serve, broke Hensley and then served out the set for a 7-5 win. \nConrad pulled away in the second set for a 6-2 victory, and the match belonged to the Bulldogs. \n\"Alexandria came out ready to play, and I think we were a little tight in the beginning,\" said Lapel coach Justin Coomer. \"That was what we wanted to do to them. The wind was strong and it was cold, but the girls (in the spring) play in that weather every other day. I think it effects players mentally more than anything.\" \nAlexandria's first point came at No. 2 doubles as the tandem of Sam Hensley and Kiel Gregg defeated Samuel Parkison and Zach Krebs 6-3, 6-3. Blake Morehead provided the Tigers their other point at No. 3 singles by topping Austin Lyons 4-6, 6-2, 10-7. \n\"I was extremely impressed with how hard we played at all five spots,\" said Alexandria coach Matt DeVault. \"We are ranked No. 4 in our district, and this year we lost to No. 2 and No. 3. We finished at 20-3 and had a very good season with a young team.\"  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T02:22:49.316+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
