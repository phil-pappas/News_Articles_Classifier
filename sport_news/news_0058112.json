Pitino claims it as an act of selflessness, so as not to draw attention away from the conference’s other schools.\n“I do not want the allegations we are facing to negatively impact the other 14 institutions on what should be a great event to talk about the approaching basketball season,” Pitino said in the release. “I realize that while many would like to question me on the allegations, the NCAA does not permit me to speak on the subject.”\nRick Pitino advised not to attend ACC media day by legal counsel. Been told not to talk about situation, but “no comment” not his strength.\n— Jeff Goodman (@GoodmanESPN) October 23, 2015 \n\nInstead, graduate transfers Trey Lewis and Damion Lee will attend the event and likely be quizzed on the scandal that’s rocked college basketball. A former escort, Katina Powell, claims ex-Louisville graduate assistant Andre McGee paid her $10,000 to provide girls for on-campus stripper parties. \nFive former Louisville recruits and players have backed up Powell’s claims — which included some of the strippers sleeping with recruits in exchange for cash — but Pitino has not been implicated. He has said he will not resign as head coach.\nMcGee resigned Friday as an assistant at the University of Missouri Kansas City.\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google Whatsapp Email Filed under college basketball ,  louisville cardinals ,  rick pitino", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T18:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T04:12:18.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
