(AP) - Flyers forward Michael Raffl says he’s fine and ready to play Tuesday after a scary incident on the bench Saturday night. \nRaffl had to be helped to the locker room in the second period of a 3-2 shootout win over the New York Rangers after he says he became dizzy and passed out for a couple of seconds on the bench. \nRaffl got disoriented when he took an inadvertent elbow to the head from Rangers center Jarret Stoll. He went to the bench and play was stopped moments later when teammates saw he needed help. \nRaffl practiced Monday and says he felt fine 10 minutes after the incident during the game. \nThe Flyers host Buffalo on Tuesday. \nCopyright © 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T20:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T21:29:34.452+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
