Jason Kenny shocked the restrained Ajibade four times with a Taser. Cpl. Maxine Evans and nurse Gregory Brown are accused of failing to check Ajibade's condition and faking jail records to make it appear checks had been made.\nThe jail video shows a fight breaking out as deputies tried to book Ajibade. Two deputies were injured and Ajibade snatched a Taser before he was punched in the face twice and kicked by jailers trying to bring him under control.\nFormer Lt. Debra Johnson, who was the night commander that day, told jurors the action was justified under jail policies in an effort to control the inmate, WTOC-TV reported.\nSheriff Al St. Lawrence fired eight deputies in connection with Ajibade's death. But none of those involved in the jailhouse brawl were charged with crimes.\nInstead, it was Kenny, who shocked Ajibade with a Taser after he had been restrained, as well as Evans and Brown, who are accused of neglecting to check his medical condition, who were charged for policy and procedure violations that prosecutors say contributed to Ajibade's death.\nDefense attorneys say the three former jail employees aren't to blame for the young man's death.\nJurors saw jail surveillance video Thursday that showed Ajibade sitting alone in a cell strapped into a restraining chair from 12:09 a.m. until 1:42 a.m. without any jail staff checking on his well-being.\nJohnson, the former lieutenant, testified at one point that night that she heard Evans say \"she got busy and forgot to check on him,\" the Savannah Morning News reported (http://bit.ly/1FV7lcD).\nState medical examiner Stacey Desamours testified earlier in the week that several factors could have contributed to Ajibade's death, including the struggle with jailers and being struck by a stun gun.\nChatham County coroner Dr. Bill Wessinger said Ajibade suffered several blunt injuries to his head and upper body and had blood inside his skull case.", "external_links": ["http://bit.ly/1FV7lcD)."], "published": "2015-10-08T11:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T19:33:11.133+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
