Senior receiver Tajae Sharpe is rewriting the record book. Sharpe needs 33 yards to equal Adrian Zullo’s career receiving yardage mark of 2,892 set from 1998-2002. Already the program leader in career receptions with 224, Sharpe has caught at least one pass in all 40 games he has played, the third-longest active streak in Division 1.\n2. The Minutemen must improve in red-zone defense. Opponents have scored on all 22 of their drives inside the UMass’ 20, with 15 of the 22 (68 percent) ending in a touchdown.\n3. UMass needs to make better half-time adjustments. Foes have outscored the Minutemen, 71-14, in the third quarter of games this season.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T17:18:19.082+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
