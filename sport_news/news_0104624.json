Me and Pacquiao used to train together as well, spar together. \n\"We are friends but sometimes, you know, friends have to fight each other. \n\"I think it can happen. It's all about just doing the little things, contracts and stuff. \n\"I have left it to my team, my team are taking care of it, it's a good fight for me.\" \nKhan was speaking at the same venue where Manny Pacquiao had visited on Thursday. \nDuring that visit, Pacquiao confirmed he was in negotiations with the 28-year-old Briton and Floyd Mayweather for what would probably be the final fight of his career. \nThe Filipino said any fight, whoever the opponent, would probably take place in late March or early April 2016, as he is likely to run for a seat in the Philippines senate next May. \nPacquiao added that a final decision will be taken by November or December this year. \nKhan on Saturday said Mayweather \"chickened out\" of a fight between the two. \n\"Floyd, in a way, chickened out, he didn't give me the fight. Three years he was saying he was going to give me the fight but then he didn't give me the fight,\" said the 28-year-old. \n\"Manny Pacquiao after Floyd Mayweather is the best fighter and I want to fight the best fighters.\" \nKhan and Pacquiao used to be a stable-mates before the Briton switched camps, leaving the Freddie Roach Wild Card Boxing Club in Los Angeles to team up with Virgil Hunter at the King's Boxing Gym in Oakland. \nKhan lost his last two fights while trained by Roach but under Hunter he has won five in a row, including a decision victory over American Chris Algieri -- a former Pacquiao victim too -- last time out in May. \nThe Briton, who won an Olympics silver medal as an amateur, will stay in Qatar until the end of October and will do media work for the BBC at the AIBA championships.
