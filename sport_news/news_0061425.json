Eagle Simpson set for contract extension \nWest Coast coach Adam Simpson is set to be rewarded with a long-term contract extension, but the Eagles have shut the door on Gold Coast midfielder Harley Bennell joining the club. \nSimpson’s current deal runs out at the end of next season. \nBut Eagles chief executive Trevor Nisbett says a contract extension will be drawn up for Simpson over summer after the Eagles defied all expectations to reach this year’s grand final. \n“Speaking to Adam over the past 12 months, he is very confident in his decision he has made to come to Perth,” Nisbett said on Monday. \n“He is pretty happy and the kids have settled, so I think it would be a good move if we can cement a longer-term tenure than just the 12 months ahead.” \nThe Eagles will target Sydney speedster Lewis Jetta and Brisbane’s Jack Redden during this year’s trade period. \nBut Bennell, who was caught up in numerous off-field sagas during his time at Gold Coast, isn’t on the club’s radar. \n“Harley’s not in our thinking,” Nisbett said. \nRichmond have also ruled out drafting in Bennell, but Fremantle are still open to the prospect of snaring him. \nJetta and Redden have both made it clear they want to join the Eagles, who are looking to inject more class into their squad after losing to Hawthorn by 46 points in the grand final. \nNow the challenge is for West Coast to get the deals done, with ruckmen Scott Lycett and Callum Sinclair reportedly set to be used as trade bait. \n“You have to have more than one or two irons in the fire in the trade period, because you can’t always get exactly the players you’re after,” Nisbett said. \n“We’re interested in those two blokes (Jetta and Redden) for sure. \n“But there’s other players we’ll be looking at to see whether they can help our squad and can’t, and we’ll make decisions on that during the trade period.” \nNisbett said the Eagles were resigned to losing free agent Scott Selwood, who appears set to link up with his older brother Joel at Geelong. \nMeanwhile, West Coast have made an official request to the AFL to fixture more Eagles games at the MCG. \nWest Coast played at the MCG just once during the home-and-away season; a 20-point win over Richmond in round 12. \nSince 2007, West Coast have won just four of their 18 games at the venue. \nThe Eagles are keen for more experience at the ‘home of football’, which is 19m wider than Domain Stadium. \nNisbett said the Eagles would want at least two or three games at the MCG each year.
