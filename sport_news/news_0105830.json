The Eagles' Josh Huff had four receptions for 78 yards and a touchdown in Sunday's victory over New Orleans. (Matt Rourke / AP) Nick Fierro Contact Reporter Of The Morning Call Huff struts his stuff as #Eagles bury Saints. \nPHILADELPHIA — A week after it looked like an important window had been slammed shut for him, Philadelphia Eagles second-year wide receiver Josh Huff responded with his best performance as a pro. His team couldn't have asked for a better time for him to deliver, either. \nHuff finished with career highs of four receptions and 78 receiving yards and scored his first career non-special teams touchdown, which came when he caught a short pass from San Bradford and rumbled 41 yards untouched to the end zone. He also opened the game with a 40-yard kickoff return. \nIn the end, the Eagles had a 39-17 victory over the New Orleans Saints. \nOn his touchdown, Huff tumbled across the goal line with a spectacular somersault that perhaps symbolized what this breakout performance meant to him and his team and the weight of expectations that seemed to be lifted off his shoulders. \n\"It definitely felt good, especially since we got the win,\" he said. \"But it's over right now and we have to go back and analyze the film and get ready for next week.\" \nComing into the game, Huff's career numbers as a receiver were barely noticeable: 12 receptions for 137 yards in 15 games. \nWhat's more, he barely played with the offense in a 23-20 loss at Washington the week before, when it looked like the coaches had lost confidence in him. \nThat wasn't the case, head coach Chip Kelly insisted last week. And Sunday, he and Huff proved it. \n\"I just prepare like I'm going to get my number called,\" Huff said. \"Today, my number was called and I was able to make the most of my opportunities. … My confidence was already high, but I just have to keep preparing until my number is called again and try to help us win games.\" \nCashing in \nFour more takeaways by the Eagles defense (on three fumbles and an interception) led to 19 points. The Eagles have forced at least one turnover in 11 straight games for a total of 26 during that span. The 4-2 advantage they finished with in turnovers in this game improved their season turnover differential to plus-3. \nRookie of the year? \nRookie ILB Jordan Hicks recovered a fumble for the third consecutive game. Since entering the lineup in Week 2, he has a sack, an interception, a forced fumble and three fumble recoveries. The last Eagles rookie with three fumble recoveries in a season was Michael Lewis in 2002. Hicks also became the fifth Eagles rookie linebacker with at least three fumble recoveries in a season and the first since Ray Farmer in 1996. \nPractice makes perfect \nAfter the previous week's makeshift alignment in which Matt Tobin shifted from right guard to left tackle when Jason Peters was felled by a quadriceps injury and Dennis Kelly was installed at right guard, the Eagles in this game were able to start and finish with Tobin at right guard and Peters at left tackle, despite the injury he's still trying to work through. \nThat continuity helped immensely in getting the offensive line to play at a competent level for perhaps the first time this season. For example, in just the short time right tackle Lane Johnson had to work with Tobin last week, Johnson believed they were able to accomplish so much. \n\"Practicing a lot with Tobin definitely helped me,\" Johnson said. \nAdded Tobin: \"Going through the walk-through Friday and practicing Thursday with Lane was good. We're kind of learning together how each other plays, once we get the call, what he needs to know, what I need to know. It's just getting on the same page.\" \nSafety dance \nMaybe Walter Thurmond should have switched to safety from cornerback much earlier than this year. On Sunday, his third interception in just five games represents a significant improvement over the one he had in the 36 career games he played as a cornerback coming into this season. \nBradford comes around \nAfter an uneven first half (19-for-30, two interceptions, one TD), Eagles quarterback Sam Bradford was nearly perfect after intermission, completing 13 of 15 passes for 188 yards and a TD. \nIn the second half of all games this season, Bradford is 66-for-94 for 753 yards and six touchdowns for a QB rating of 102.0. \nThe last word \n\"Probably never. Not even in college, high school — never.\" Eagles DE Fletcher Cox, who was asked after delivering a career-high three sacks, if he had ever done that before.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T06:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T08:20:51.585+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
