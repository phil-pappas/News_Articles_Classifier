The Sports Quotient 1 day ago Matthew Kaminer © Soobum Im/USA TODAY Sports LaMarcus Aldridge could be the final piece to a championship winning Spurs team.\nThe pandemonium that landed power forward LaMarcus Aldridge with the San Antonio Spurs was one of the most significant free agency plays of this past summer. The Spurs front office pulled out all the stops, sending Tiago Splitter and his $8.5 million contract to the Atlanta Hawks and restructuring Danny Green’s deal under the increased salary cap.\nAdChoices Given the chess game that was played to land Aldridge, his expectation coming into this year’s regular season will be hefty, and with good reason. He posted career bests in points per game (23.4), free throw percentage (84.5 percent), and three-point percentage (35.2 percent) in 2014-15, and he will be expected to mold his skill set and game into what has proven to be a spectacular Spurs' system. How exactly he will mold into coach Gregg Popovich’s prolific game plan has been the question on the minds of many NBA fans since his signing.\nOffense\nThe book on Aldridge, from an offensive standpoint, is no secret; he is extraordinarily skilled for a power forward. With uncanny shooting ability, both around the rim and outside the paint, as well as smart passing tendencies, Aldridge has the potential to be the consummate team player in San Antonio. NBA fans haven’t seen much “team ball” from Aldridge in the past, as he has spent his first nine seasons carrying a Superman-esque workload for the Portland Trail Blazers. Notorious as a relatively inefficient shooter, LMA has been criticized in the past for his quick trigger when it comes to “long two’s.” However, he’ll be working with a system and supporting cast that are arguably unparalleled in the NBA, and that should lighten the burden quite a bit from what he was accustomed to in Portland.\nWith the departure of Splitter, Aldridge slots in nicely in the Spurs’ starting lineup, taking the power forward spot and bumping Tim Duncan to center. This move could prove to be very effective for the Spurs. Duncan has a fading but still effective offensive arsenal that will translate well to center, and LMA matches up exceptionally with most NBA power forwards. The two of them will play alongside Kawhi Leonard, Danny Green, and Tony Parker.\nLooking at the Spurs starting lineup, as well as their deep bench, it is already clear that Aldridge is playing with significantly more talent than he was given in Portland. For this reason, he will have to become a much more efficient player. In 2014-15, Aldridge’s True Shooting Percentage was 52.8 percent, which, according to Box Score Geeks, slates him around average (54.1) for NBA power forwards. Average efficiency will not be tolerated in a Spurs' offense that is nothing if not efficient.\nHe’s also going to need to share the ball a bit more than he did in Portland. In 2014-15, Aldridge recorded a 30.2 usage percentage; no 2014-15 Spurs player exceeded 25 percent, but five players exceeded 20 percent, so LMA is going to have to buy into a system that will not only get him a reasonable number of touches, but also put the ball in the hands of the Spurs’ other star players.\nDefense\nThe primary concerns Spurs fans might have, if any, of the Aldridge signing exist on the defensive end of the floor. As good of an overall player as he is, LMA doesn’t have quite the defensive prowess that Splitter did, and he will need to put in much more effort defensively. However, one factor to note is that, again, Aldridge carried a sizeable load with the Trail Blazers, and there is a chance that he improves on defensive when he isn’t relied upon as often on offense.\nLooking at the lineup from a defensive standpoint, the shift of Duncan to center gives both him and Aldridge manageable matchups night in and night out, as far as size goes. Duncan has shown the ability to consistently defend centers, even at his tender age, and LMA will have an easier time staying in good position when he is defending true power forwards.\nDespite the modest concerns that may exist among the big men on defense, Leonard, Green, and Parker all have remarkable defensive skills. Leonard and Green are arguably two of the best perimeter defenders in the NBA, and this is going to limit the number of tricky situations that Aldridge and Duncan run into. If LMA has any problems, it will be in one-on-one scenarios, as Green and Leonard will keep opposing guards and forwards out of the paint.\nLeadership\nOne of the arenas in which Aldridge’s burden may be entirely relieved is in leadership. The Spurs are one of the most seasoned teams in the NBA, with Duncan, Parker, and Ginobili as likely Hall-Of-Fame locks. Additionally, this Spurs group has been together for quite some time, and LMA won’t have to expedite any team communication or chemistry processes. Duncan is known league-wide as one of the game’s best leaders, and Parker and veteran Ginobili aren’t bad sidekicks. Aldridge should fit in seamlessly.\nAll in all, LMA is an absolute steal for the Spurs, and it appears that the pieces are once again coming together for a possible title run. This comes at an opportune time, as Duncan, Parker, and Ginobili aren’t getting any younger. With veteran David West taking a steep pay cut to come to San Antonio, and other reserves, such as Patty Mills and Boris Diaw contributing at a high clip, Aldridge might be the missing piece of the puzzle.\nThat piece is missing no longer.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://thesportsquotient.com/nba/2015/7/13/can-the-spurs-create-an-efficient-lamarcus-aldridge", "http://thesportsquotient.com/", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T23:30:07.530+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
