The Sports Post 8 hrs ago Shaun Ranft © Tom Szczerbowski/Getty Images Will Pablo Sandoval and Hanley Ramirez be with the Red Sox in 2016? The Boston Red Sox finished 78-84 in 2015, slumping to their third last-place AL East finish over the last four years - though a championship in 2013 certainly softens the blow a little - and have two outlandish contracts on their books for the next three-four seasons.\nAdChoices You know who I’m talking about: Pablo Sandoval and Hanley Ramirez.\nAre each of them really as bad as their 2015 production - or lack thereof - indicates? Of the two, who has the better chance of bouncing back both short- and long-term? And, will they both remain in Boston through the end of next season? Beyond that?\nPablo Sandoval\nSandoval turned 29 in August, and boasts a career batting line of .288/.339/.452 over eight seasons - seven with San Francisco - while averaging roughly 30 doubles and 19 home runs in seven full seasons at the big league level.\nHis best season, by far, came in 2009 when he was 22 years old, as he slashed .330/.387/.556 with 44 doubles and 25 home runs.\nFast forward to 2015, and we’re met with the worst season of his professional: a .245/.292/.366 batting line - all career lows - 25 doubles, and only 10 home runs.\nSure, Boston couldn’t have expected this when they signed him last November to a five-year contract through 2019 worth $95 million, as well as a team option for the 2020 season (when he’ll be 33 years old) valued at $17 million.\nJust about everything that could go wrong, did for Sandoval in his first year with Boston. He was benched in June after admitting to using his cell phone during a game, and of course there’s the question of his weight. Sandoval is listed at 5’11”, 255 pounds. Despite constant efforts , it continues to be a problem for the 29-year-old.\nManager John Farrell more or less admitted after a game in July that the Kung-Fu Panda’s weight was a recurring issue:\n“ That’s something Pablo has dealt with his entire career. It continues to be addressed. I can’t say tonight is a direct result of that. There are ongoing efforts to support that, to try to get him in the best shape possible. ”\nAs Farrell mentioned, he’s been dealing with this since his first days in San Francisco. It’s been an on and off problem for eight years, which would allow us to assume that playing third baseman becomes increasingly difficult. His 2015 metrics defensively appear to back that up.\nNow, Sandoval has never been known for his defensive prowess—boasting UZR and UZR/150 totals of -6.3 and -1.2, respectively, for his career. That said, those 2015 numbers show a staggering decline: -16.9 and -21.9—again respectively. Was that horrid showing just a one-off, or something Red Sox fans should be worried about going forward?\nHanley Ramirez\nIf you thought the Sandoval deal was bad, the Red Sox may have outdone themselves with the four-year, $88 million contract they gave to a 30-year-old Ramirez last November .\nHe was coming off of a productive 2014 with the Dodgers - slashing .283/.369/.448 with 35 doubles and 13 home runs - but was limited to 128 games. He played in only 86 the season before. Injury-prone was written on the wall, which explains the fact he only played in 105 games for Boston this past year.\nHe was signed by Boston as an amateur free agent in 2000, but only played twice for the Red Sox before being shipped off to Florida, where he won the Rookie of the Year in 2006. His production offensively with the Florida/Miami Marlins was great, with an average line of .300/.374/.499 over parts of seven seasons, but his attitude eventually grew tiresome and they moved him to the Dodgers.\nAfter parts of three seasons in LA, the Dodgers never showed much interest in bringing him back. Barring an incredible 86 games in 2013, his offensive numbers declined, and he never was great defensively - evident by his career -56.4 and -8.8 UZR and UZR/150 in over 9,200 innings at shortstop.\nSo Boston, with a strong infield already in place, tried him out in left field. The results were less than ideal, with UZR and UZR/150 totals of -17.8 and -31.9, respectively, over roughly 750 innings of work. Small sample size or not, Ramirez isn’t going to show much improvement at the easiest outfield position in baseball.\nOffensively, like Sandoval, he posted the worst numbers of his career as well: a .249/.291/.426 batting line with 12 doubles - though he somehow hit 19 home runs.\nThe Better Bet\nWe’ve seen in the past that if Sandoval can get a grip on his weight, he’ll be alright. He’s performed at his best when he’s shed 20-30 pounds, but the problem has always been maintaining that.\nAs for Ramirez, I believe his best days are far and away behind him. Reports about “bad attitude” - whether narrative or reality - follow the former shortstop wherever he goes, as does the injury bug and a sudden lack of production.\nBoth of these players won’t make it through their full contracts with the Red Sox, I imagine, but if I had to choose one who will, it’d be Sandoval. No questions asked.\nThese expensive mistakes are ones Boston can afford from a financial standpoint, but when two marquee players both post their career-worst year in the same season, they’ll certainly take a hit in the win-loss column.\nIf Boston can get just get one of these two players turned around next season, it won’t be considered a colossal failure. In fact, it might turn out to be a mild success. That won’t be clear until we’re a couple more years down the road, however.\nStatistics courtesy of Baseball Reference and Fangraphs\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.yardbarker.com/", "http://espn.go.com/boston/mlb/story/_/id/11931183/hanley-ramirez-boston-red-sox-agree", "http://espn.go.com/mlb/story/_/id/13108912/pablo-sandoval-boston-red-sox-benched-using-instagram-game-progress", "http://espn.go.com/blog/boston/red-sox/post/_/id/45730/john-farrell-admits-that-pablo-sandovals-weight-needs-addressing", "http://www.sbnation.com/mlb/2014/11/25/7277415/pabo-sandoval-contract-details-official-red-sox", "http://espn.go.com/blog/boston/red-sox/post/_/id/46154/pablo-sandoval-working-extra-to-keep-weight-in-check-will-it-help", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-10-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T02:44:28.183+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
