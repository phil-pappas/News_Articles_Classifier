More than any team we’ve seen since the days of Robbie Alomar and Joe Carter, this is a group that has lived in the moment. The question becomes, can there ever be a point in time that could top that utterly chaotic seventh inning? \nBefore they hit the reset button to face the Kansas City Royals, a team the Blue Jays have already had some issues with this season, it can’t hurt to hang back a little and sneak a few peeks at what may be the most ridiculously wonderful inning in anybody’s playoff memory. \nFirst of all, is there a way to circumvent convention and just order up a few metal letters and put Jose Bautista’s name up on the Rogers Centre “Level of Excellence” as soon as possible? Like yesterday? We know that home run didn’t win a World Series, that the Jays have not yet won anything that matters, but that home run may have been just as important to this franchise and this city as “Touch-’em-all-Joe’s.” We know that Carter’s homer won a World Series, but consider what might have ensued if the Blue Jays don’t win that game Wednesday. \nFirst of all, the Jays, their fans and, especially Russell Martin, would have had to live with the knowledge that the 2015 dream had ended on a flukish play dictated by an obscure rule. Even though the rule was correctly interpreted by the umpiring crew, it would have been a tough pill to swallow. \nWhen Martin’s throw back to Aaron Sanchez — a throw he’s made hundreds of thousands of times in his career — hit Shin-Soo Choo’s bat and skittered down the third base line, allowing Rougned Odor to score the go-ahead run in the top of the seventh, Martin was sick about it. \n“Never done that,” said Martin. “First time in my life. \n“I was just throwing the ball back the way I have a million times before and at that moment — it was probably the worst timing of my life. (Choo) didn’t do anything wrong, it was either they’re lucky or we’re unlucky. It was a situation where you either feel sorry for yourself or you do something about it. I’m thinking, ‘I better do something. I need to get on base here. I better do something.’ I mean, I knew what I did.” \nSo it was Martin who high-tailed it down the first-base line after hitting a routine ground ball to start the bottom of the inning, hoping against hope to be able to start a rally. When Elvis Andrus booted the ball, his prayer was answered. \nWhen Bautista hit his momentous home run, Martin was out of the game, lifted for pinch-runner Dalton Pompey. When Bautista’s blast left the premises, Martin could be seen looking to the sky, incredible relief obvious on his face. \nWho knows what other future events the Bautista home run derailed? Had the Jays lost the game and the series, how would ownership have seen GM Alex Anthopoulos’ mad deadline gambles? Would John Gibbons have become a managerial scapegoat? With a new president on the way next month, who knows how the ALDS loss would have been seen? \nAnd then, there was the bat flip. Not just a flip, but a full-out caber toss, right out of the Highland Games. The Maple Leafs sent out a tweet congratulating Bautista, but asked him to please come by and pick up his bat. \n“It’s on the Air Canada Centre roof,” the tweet said. \n“I can’t really remember what was going through my mind, to be quite honest with you,” said Bautista. “After I made contact, you know, I didn’t plan anything that I did and so I still don’t even know how I did it. I just enjoyed the moment, rounded the bases and got to the dugout. And after all the guys stopped punching me and hitting me is when I kind of started realizing what happened. I knew I did something great for the team at the moment of impact because I knew I hit that ball pretty good, and I gave us the lead in a crucial moment, so I was happy to do that.” \nSam Dyson, whose 97-mph fastball found its way to the sweetest spot on the barrel of Bautista’s bat, didn’t like it. \n“He needs to respect the game a little more,” Dyson. “He’s a huge role model for the younger generation coming up playing this game. He’s doing stuff that kids do in backyard baseball and it shouldn’t be done.” \nThanks for your input, Sam. And you know, all those kids you say are being spoiled by such demonstrations of emotion? Those are the same kids who, for a hundred years, have been dreaming about hitting a ball like Bautista did in a playoff or World Series game and only one in a billion ever will. This was not a home run hit in the middle of May in Game 40, with the score 10-1. A bat flip in that situation? Sure, it deserves a heater in the ribs down the road. A home run to win a playoff series? The guy who hit it gets to celebrate any way he cares to. And the guy who threw it, has to wear it. In silence, we might add. \nSo now it’s on to Kansas City. The last time these two teams met, on the first weekend of August, both benches and bullpens emptied after Toronto reliever Aaron Sanchez was ejected for hitting Kansas City’s Alcides Escobar on the thigh in the eighth. It was the climax of a game-long spat that began when Royals starter Edinson Volquez hit Josh Donaldson on the left shoulder in the first. \nVolquez didn’t mince words when asked whether Donaldson overreacted to being hit and to a pair of later pitches that were up and in. \n“He’s a little baby,” Volquez said. “He was crying like a baby.” \nDonaldson and Volquez traded stares and words as the Blue Jays slugger took a slow walk to first base after being hit. Home plate umpire Jim Wolf warned both dugouts. \nWhen Donaldson batted again in the third, Volquez missed high and inside with a pitch that sailed to the backstop. Blue Jays manager John Gibbons came out to argue, but Volquez was not ejected. \nIn the seventh, Royals reliever Ryan Madson hit Troy Tulowitzki on the right forearm, then threw high and inside to Donaldson, who stepped out and yelled at Wolf. Gibbons and on-deck hitter Bautista stepped in to break up the argument, and Gibbons was eventually ejected. \n“I think they’re used to pushing people around,” Dickey said of the Royals that day. “So when they come onto the playground and there’s a kid that’s bigger than they are for a day, I think it probably (ticks) them off. And I can’t blame ’em.” \nThat history aside, it would be quite a surprise to see any fireworks in the ALCS, given the stakes and the potential for suspensions if things deteriorated into a beanball war. \nVolquez is going to start Game 1 for the Royals and, while it’s a safe bet he and Donaldson won’t be making dinner plans, it’s unlikely anything personal will boil over. When last we saw Donaldson on Wednesday night in the champagne-soaked Blue Jays clubhouse, the man who would be MVP was declaring his own MVP choice. \nThat would, of course, be Bautista. \n“The guy’s amazing. He’s my hero. I want to hug him forever.” \nDonaldson and about 35 million other people, we’d guess.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T07:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T16:13:49.336+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
