Manager Bruce Bochy obliged him, all right. \n\"He's earned that,\" the skipper said. \nHudson allowed three runs and three hits in 2 1-3 innings in the final start of his 17-year major league career, taking the loss in a 3-2 defeat to the division champion Los Angeles Dodgers on Thursday. \nThe 40-year-old right-hander (8-9) said his farewell last weekend across the bay in Oakland where his career began in 1999, pitching opposite former Giants lefty Barry Zito. \nHudson is the majors' active wins leader for a few more days with 222 victories. He won his first World Series ring last season and winds up having thrown 46,631 pitches against 13,005 batters. \n\"I was surprised how good I was able to hold it together there,\" Hudson said. \"The last couple weeks have been a little bit of an emotional rollercoaster for me. I've had so much fun over the last 17 years and today was a really special day for me, the way the fans responded, the way my teammates responded. I didn't quite know what to expect but I'm very grateful for all of it.\" \nBochy expected Hudson's outing to be short considering he has been bothered by a tender left hip, though that wasn't an issue Thursday. \nHudson will be honored during the weekend along with left-handed reliever Jeremy Affeldt, who announced his retirement Thursday and entered to relieve Hudson. \nAfter so many playoff failures, Hudson finally won his first World Series ring last fall. \n\"I never would have dreamed things would have unfolded how I hoped they would. That never happens, especially in this game,\" Hudson said. \"It seemed very magical.\" \nDodgers left-hander Brett Anderson, who got his start with the A's five years after Hudson departed for Atlanta, pitched two-hit ball into the eighth in his final regular-season start. \nAnderson (10-9) retired 14 straight batters following Kevin Frandsen's one-out single in the third before Jarrett Parker singled to start the eighth. He made his career-high 31st start, topping his 30 outings in 2009 as a rookie with Oakland. He reached a high for innings with 180 1-3. \nJust three balls left the infield against Anderson and no San Francisco runner reached second base until an eighth-inning throwing error by second baseman Howie Kendrick. Anderson gave up four hits, struck out three and didn't walk a batter in 7 2-3 innings. \n\"We just couldn't generate any offense,\" Bochy said. \"He had us off balance all day.\" \nThe Giants won the season series 11-8, beating the Dodgers in eight of 10 at home. \nFILM SESSION \nFans were asked to boo during the \"Kiss-Cam\" and seventh-inning stretch as Netflix filmed for a portion of an upcoming original series, \"Fuller House,\" due out next year. \nTRAINER'S ROOM \nDodgers: OF Yasiel Puig was playing four innings in an instructional league game and is running at 100 percent on his strained right hamstring in what manager Don Mattingly called \"pretty miraculous\" and \"legendary\" — yet that doesn't mean he's certain to make the division series roster for the best-of-five series against the Mets. \"Like three days ago he was running at 80 percent and having pain and then all of a sudden he's going 100 percent and feeling fine,\" Mattingly said. \"It's been pretty miraculous, actually, to me.\" \nGiants: World Series MVP Madison Bumgarner is being shut down and won't start Sunday, with Yusmeiro Petit likely to pitch. Bumgarner threw 270 innings last year and another 218 1-3 this season. ... OF Nori Aoki was being examined by renowned concussion specialist Dr. Micky Collins at the University of Pittsburgh on Thursday. Even if cleared he is \"doubtful\" to play the rest of the season. \nUP NEXT \nDodgers: LHP Alex Wood (11-12) starts Friday night against San Diego looking to bounce back after allowing eight runs to Colorado last Sunday matching a career high. \nGiants: Rookie RHP Chris Heston (12-10) looks to end his first year in the majors with consecutive wins as he pitches the opener of a season-ending series against Colorado. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T02:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T04:45:23.068+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
