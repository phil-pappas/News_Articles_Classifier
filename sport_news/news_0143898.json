And No. 4, and No. 5. \nThere’s been a shakeup in the top five after a weekend of surprising results for those teams counted among the elite of college football after the first month of the regular season. TCU moves up two spots to No. 2 after surviving Texas Tech’s best shot. UCLA is up to third after dismantling Arizona. Notre Dame’s three wins against Power Five competition have the Fighting Irish up to No. 4. \nMichigan State and Mississippi dropped outside of the top five after struggling against Central Michigan and Vanderbilt, respectively. Utah soars to No. 7 after handing Oregon an unbelievably lopsided home loss . Follow the road to the 2015 College Football Playoff at The Football Four , our home to rate and debate the nation's best. \nThe Ducks are one of six teams to fall out of the top 25, joining two peers from the Pac-12 Conference. \nNew to the top 25: Utah, Texas Tech, Oklahoma State, California, Temple and Michigan. \nOut of the top 25: Oregon, Arizona, Arizona State, Georgia Tech, Brigham Young and Missouri. 162 CONNECT 75 TWEET LINKEDIN 27 COMMENT EMAIL MORE TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-28T17:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T05:58:38.979+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
