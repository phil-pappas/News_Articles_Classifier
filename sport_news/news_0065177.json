It was an unnecessary challenge in the circumstances as defenders were covering. \nSilvino Louro, one of Mourinho's assistants, was apoplectic and sent to the stands. \nWhen Mourinho did not emerge on the touchline for the second half, instead being found in the West Ham directors' box, it became apparent that he, too, had been dismissed at the interval. \nWest Ham appeared more distracted than Chelsea, who looked better with 10 men, and Gary Cahill equalised only for Andy Carroll to head in a deserved winner for the Hammers. \nMourinho did not speak to the media, in breach of Premier League regulations. \nBut the likely fine is the least of his worries, with the FA awaiting Moss' report. \nIt is not expected to automatically trigger the stadium ban, as that sanction, which is subject of an appeal, appears to relate specifically to rule E3 and improper conduct surrounding comments on officials. \nFurther disciplinary action awaits for Mourinho, though, while Chelsea can also anticipate a fine for having more than five players yellow carded in the game. Seven cautions were issued against them. \nCahill, who spoke to the broadcast rights' holders, felt the fine margins went against Chelsea, illustrating their season in microcosm. \nHe told Chelsea TV: \"It's a summary of our season sometimes. \n\"You're talking about the smallest of margins. At this moment in time they're going against us, not for us. \n\"What do you do? Do you sit back and feel sorry for yourselves? Of course you don't. \n\"You need to keep going. You pick yourselves up and go again, work even harder to make this turnaround and the good times will feel even better. \n\"When you have a result like this you want to play again tomorrow. It's better that games are coming thick and fast.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T16:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T20:19:52.088+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
