With the Ames football team on board heading toward a road game, they veer out of the school’s parking lot onto 20th Street, hang a right on Grand Avenue, and turn left onto 13th Street. \nAs they roll toward Interstate 35, they pass the Mary Greeley Medical Center and, right after that, the Ames Municipal Cemetery. This is when senior Micheal Agbaje perks his head up and peers out the window. \nAgbaje scans the burial ground for a person he wishes were still here. He does not know the specific location of the tombstone he seeks, but he knows the general area. He says he has found it a few times. \n“I just need to look there,” Agbaje says, “and then …” — he trips over his words as his eyes begin to well — “and then I’m set.” \nHe continues: “I just wish he could see all the things I’ve been doing, and all the great things my brother and the rest of my family has been doing. It’s hard to talk about. I don’t really have the words. \n“But when I look over there, I see him.” \n• • • \nAyobami and Bunmi Agbaje came to the United States in 1996, after Ayobami won a diversity immigrant visa through the lottery program. They came to Ames from their native Nigeria and stayed with Ayobami’s sister. With nine-month-old Temi in tow, they began a new life in the midwest. Micheal came along in November of 1997. \nThey flew back to Nigeria often. They would go every few years and spend close to three months traveling the country. The last time they went was 2012. The Agbajes have dozens of aunts, uncles and cousins that still live there, and seeing them is always a priority. \nBut the visits were bittersweet, because the memories Agbaje and Temi have just involve their mom. \nAyobami died in a car wreck on Nov. 30, 2000. They do not know exact details of his death. They only know he was hit by a semitruck in Ames, and was killed on impact. \nIt was two weeks after Agbaje’s third birthday. \n“We were young, so we didn’t quite understand,” Temi says. “Like we understood that we were never going to see him again, but we didn’t quite understand the gravity of what that meant.” \nThe death forced Bunmi to adjust her work schedule. She works the nightshift at the Northcrest Retirement Community. There are some weeks when Agbaje barely sees her, and others where he does not see her at all. \nWhen he returns home from practice in the afternoon, Bunmi is either leaving for work or already gone. When he leaves for school in the morning, she’ll have just returned home. Bunmi doesn’t always get to the high school to watch him play football on Friday nights, either. \nDuring Ames’ homecoming game against Ankeny, Bunmi came for the halftime show, when Agbaje was crowned king, but left shortly after to go back to work. \n“My mom’s been playing both parent roles, and I’m forever grateful for everything she’s been doing and all that she’s done,” he says. “I know why she does it. I appreciate it a lot. She works hard for us, but it’s hard sometimes.” \n• • • \nOn a Sunday at the end of summer, Agbaje sits at church. He needs a pencil. There are three small ones in the shelf on the back of the pew in front of him, but they are all broken. He looks to his left and asks his older brother if there are any by him. \nTemi pulls one out. Broken. He reaches for another. Busted. Agbaje is offered a pen. He smiles. “No thanks,” he says. “You keep it.” \nTemi finds a sixth pencil. It’s freshly sharpened. \n“Awesome,” Agbaje says. He takes it, turns back in his seat and waits for the service to begin, wearing a big, cheesy smile. \nThis place of worship is Agbaje’s escape from reality — from the struggles that plague the Ames football team; from the stress of schoolwork; from the nagging injuries that make it hard to get out of bed some days. \nHere, he gets to see his family all together for the first time in what could be weeks. \n“I grew up here,” Agbaje says. “All my friends I made then are still my good friends now. We’re all in the same youth group together. This whole church has been really nice, really helpful, and raised us up, in a sense.” \nAgbaje has been here every Sunday since he can remember. His parents came here when they first emigrated to the United States, and it is where the family turned to after his father died in a car wreck 15 years ago. \nThe church opened its arms to the Agbaje family. Members would watch young Agbaje and Temi while Bunmi worked. Others would mow the family’s lawn or drop off food. The support was, and still is, endless. \n“Ames is home,” Bunmi says. \nWhen Agbaje is here, he feels relaxed. Every Sunday morning, his worries, if only for a few hours, disappear. This, he says, is by design. His only real problem, on this day at least, is finding a pencil so he can scribble notes while pastor Will Hatfield delivers his message. \n“It’s a place where I come to help remind me that there are things beyond football,” Agbaje says. “It’s something I enjoy doing, but there are things that are bigger and better for me. \n“God has a plan in it all. What these guys have shown me through the gospel is that He has a plan, and I should trust Him, and attack everything with a smile.” \n• • • \nAfter the service, Agbaje and other church members drive 5 1/2 miles from Crossroad to a tailgate lot near Jack Trice Stadium to pick up trash. Over the next two hours, Agbaje will ride on the back of a trailer, collect garbage cans in five different parking lots and pile them up next to dumpsters. \n“It beats homework,” he says and smiles. \nThe university pays the church for doing this, and that money goes toward mission trips, among other things. Agbaje went on two separate mission trips over the last few years. This past summer, he traveled to Brooklyn to spread the gospel to inner-city kids, and evangelized mostly through playing basketball. \n“I think he played with them on the playground for like three hours straight — and they’re pretty good basketball players in Brooklyn,” says Jeff Wood, his youth pastor. “By the time he was done playing, they were all friends. That’s just the way Micheal is. He can go into anywhere and make connections with anyone.” \nOn this particular Sunday, at the beginning of October, Agbaje is making another connection with a stranger on the back of the trailer. As they corral garbage cans and stack them up, they talk about school, work and life; how Agbaje loves to dance, and once became a Twitter meme because of it; and that maybe, just maybe, this is the year the Vikings finally get back to the playoffs. \nThen, a moment of silence. Agbaje hesitates to go forward, deciding how much to share. He produces a smile. He feels compelled to tell this next story. It is what’s on his heart. \n“I don’t think I’ve ever told anybody this,” he begins, “but I find it really hard to sleep after football games.” \nAgbaje has never figured out the true source of his inability to sleep. He thinks it’s probably the combined stress of football and school. This is not something he puts much focus on, perhaps because insomnia from a kid who never really knew one parent and struggles to see the other comes off as depressing and sad, and he is not about that life because, in his words, “negativity kills vibes.” \nSo instead of dwelling, he does homework. When he wants to procrastinate, he’ll text friends and ask if he can pray for them. Recently, a set of twins at school lost their grandfather. He sent one a text shortly after. \n“They were going through some tough times, and I know what that’s like, so I asked if I could pray for them,” Agbaje says. “They were on my heart.” \n• • • \nHis path to starring on the Ames football team was nearly derailed before it even began. \nThe summer before his freshman year, Agbaje was running on an old golf course at a church camp, and broke his tibia, fibula and partially tore his patella tendon after stepping in an uncovered hole. He missed that entire season. \nWhen he returned as a sophomore, the coaches put him at linebacker, a position he had never played before. Agbaje grew up playing on the line because he was “the big, chubby kid in elementary and middle school.” \nHe slimmed down and filled out before he turned 16 — he stands 6-foot-1 and weighs 200 pounds now — and when the coaches called him up to varsity, they put him at rover, a linebacker-defensive back hybrid. Agbaje admits the transition was weird at first, but he loves hitting people. \n“Even if I’m the last one there, I’m still getting in on the tackles,” he says. “It’s fun.” \nAgbaje’s breakout performance came in the ninth game of his sophomore season, when he totaled a team-leading 7.5 tackles in Ames’ 41-7 win over Johnston. He had just 3.5 tackles before that game, and finished the year with 27. He’s been a permanent fixture in the defense ever since. \n“He’s one of those guys you’re extremely fortunate to get to coach,” Ames’ assistant coach Vance Downs says. “He is so intent on doing the right thing and playing so hard to please you that you want to make sure — you know, you don’t want to cheat any kid, of course — but I don’t want to leave practice having cheated this young man.” \nAgbaje wants to play football at the next level, but didn’t start the recruiting process until after his junior season. He made a highlight reel and filled out questionnaires. He went to some camps over the summer to help build interest. \nFor now, though, he waits, praying that a coach will call and offer him a scholarship. It is something he thinks about a lot, primarily because he knows how happy it would make his mom. \n“The reason I do what I do every single day is for her,” Agbaje says. “She’s the motivation. She’s the reason I get up and do what I do. I don’t want to let her down. \n“I don’t know how far football will take me, but if it does take me far, then I’d love to get her a big house hopefully. I just want her to be settled and to not have anything to worry about.” \n• • • \nAfter Temi graduated high school in May 2014, the entire family went to Ames Municipal Cemetery. Agbaje stood in front of the tombstone he tries to find on his way to every away football game. It’s a different feeling when he actually sees it, he says. He doesn’t know what to think, so he usually thinks nothing at all. \n“It’s hard,” he says. “I’ve never had a time where it’s been completely silent in my head. I usually think optimistic things. But when I’m there, I can’t really think much or do much. \n“I know he’s looking down. I know he’s in a better place. But I miss him to death. Hopefully I’ll see him again.” \nBefore the family left, Agbaje took a picture of the tombstone. On the drive back home, he thought about his father. Ayobami always wore a smile and went to church every Sunday. He was easy-going, an everyman who worked his tail off for his family. He loved playing ping pong, a trait his youngest son did not inherit. \nThere is one distinct memory of his father that Agbaje clings to. It is of the four of them in a blue Oldsmobile. Dad is driving, mom is sitting shotgun, and he and Temi are in the back, smiling as the Beach Boys play over the speakers. In that memory, they are one big happy family again. \nAbout a month after Temi’s graduation, Agbaje opened his phone and logged into Instagram. He pulled that photo of the tombstone, cropped it into an even square and posted it. \nThe caption read: Happy Father’s Day Dad.
