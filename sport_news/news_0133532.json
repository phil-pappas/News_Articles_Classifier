Bayern said Tuesday that the 69-year-old Mueller has had the illness for “a long time” and that he has been cared for professionally with the support of his family since the beginning of February this year.\nHis wife Uschi asked for understanding, as there will no official appointments or visits for his 70th birthday on Nov. 3. Mueller, known as “Der Bomber” for his scoring-prowess, scored 533 goals in 585 games for Bayern between 1964 and 1979, helping the side to four German titles, four German Cup wins and three European Cup victories in that time.\nHis 365 goals in 427 Bundesliga league games remains a record, as does his feat of 40 goals in a single season from 1971-72. — AP", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T08:40:12.174+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
