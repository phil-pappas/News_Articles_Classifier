(Keith Srakocic / Associated Press) Daniel Gallen Contact Reporter Former Terps star Torrey Smith comments on Randy Edsall's firing. \nDuring a sparkling career in College Park, Torrey Smith became one of the most recognizable figures in the recent history of Maryland football. At the end of his career, Smith ranked first in career all-purpose yards (5,264), third in career receptions (152), third in career receiving yards (2,215) and second in career touchdown catches (19). He then moved up I-95 and spent the first four years of his pro career with the Baltimore Ravens, winning a Super Bowl. \nAnd though Smith now plays for the San Francisco 49ers, Maryland remains close to his heart. On Wednesday, Smith commented on Sunday's firing of coach Randy Edsall. \n\"I think it’s tough for anyone to get fired, and probably the way it happened, I know it’s probably tough on the players,\" Smith said. \"Edsall, he did a great job while he was there, and obviously, they moved on. That’s the big guy’s choice.\" \nSmith played his whole career for former coach Ralph Friedgen, who was fired after the 2010 season, Smith's last in College Park. Smith's presence is still felt around campus. He has appeared in \"Maryland Pride\" hype videos and has been courtside at a few basketball games. He also appeared at the unveiling of the Maryland Pride 2.0 uniforms in 2013. \nSmith, who owns one of the best single-game performances in Maryland history when he caught 14 passes for 224 yards and four touchdowns against N.C. State in 2010, is looking forward to see how the Terps finish the season under interim coach Mike Locksley.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T23:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T12:33:46.676+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
