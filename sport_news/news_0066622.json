(For OzarksSportsZone.com) -- The Fordland Lady Eagles volleyball squad defeated the Willow Springs Lady Bears in two sets in home action on Monday evening, a reversal of the defeat that the Lady Bears handed to them at the Forsyth Tournament earlier this year. The victory was especially sweet for Fordland’s five seniors as they celebrated Senior Night between the junior-varsity and varsity contests.“It was fantastic to have a win on Senior Night with all of our friends and family here,” said Ali Sparks, a 5’9” outside hitter for the Lady Eagles. CLICK HERE FOR PHOTOS The first set had both squads battling for dominance early on, but a later run by the Lady Eagles led to a 25-18 victory. The Lady Eagles started the second set with a 5-0 run, with the Lady Bears struggling to adjust to the Lady Eagles’ hitting style.“We play certain types of defenses and we just went to those spots instead of adjusting to how they were coming in,” said Lady Bears Coach Valarie Jackson. “Number two (Ali Sparks) kept hitting down the meat of our defense and our middle blocker didn’t make any adjustments.”“It really helped that we started off (the set) pretty strong,” said Fordland coach Laurel McDaniel. The Lady Eagles ended the set with a 25-10 victory, bringing their record to 24-3-1, behind a strong performance by freshman Libero Sophie Sparks, along with Ali Sparks, according to McDaniel.“Sophie was all over the court, and Ali performed well,” she said. Sophie Sparks led the squad with 20 digs, followed by Ali Sparks with 14. Ali Sparks led in kills with 7, followed by Middle Hitter Danielle Bailey with 4. For Willow Springs, senior Allie Tooley had 8 assists and 4 kills, sophomore Kaitlyn Perkins had 4 kills and 8 digs, junior Cassidy Crewse had 9 digs and 6 kills and sophomore Kameron Woody had 6 digs. The loss brought Willow Springs’ record to 17-11-1.“We just weren’t on the same page,” Jackson said. “We were just looking at each other and letting balls fall in the floor. We don’t normally do that. We’ve been playing pretty well, playing together, playing for each other, and we just weren’t doing that today.“We just have to move on to the next game.” Willow Springs will face Ava tomorrow (Tuesday) evening before entering the Class 2 District 9 Tournament at Cabool on Monday, Oct. 19 at 7:30 p.m. against Licking (5-15-2). With a win, the Lady Bears will face the winner of the Plato/Cabool contest on Tuesday, Oct. 20 at 6:15 p.m. Fordland has the rest of the week off, and as the Class 1 District 6 #1 seed has a bye in the first round of the tournament. Therefore, the Lady Eagles will face the winner of the Bradleyville/Thayer contest at 5 p.m. next Tuesday (Oct. 20) at Winona High School.
