His beliefs and convictions and vision were made pliable and irrelevant by the BCCI factionalism and the wealth it began to earn after the IPL was set up in 2008. He is said to be a man of great personal integrity, and some say he’s incorruptible. But even the loftiest ideals are sacrificed at the altar of careerism. Manohar had to make a lot of compromises on his personal beliefs in his three years as the BCCI president. He hates ostentation, but the BCCI became a money-chasing, gaudy organisation with him at the top. He wanted to introduce performance-based remuneration for the players, but player earnings shot through the roof during his time. He wanted to limit the number of product endorsements by the players, but the reverse happened. Manohar failed to achieve his stated goals. Manohar was the BCCI president when a crucial clause in its constitution was changed in September 2008, specifically to allow N Srinivasan to buy an IPL team. This was clearly unethical and probably illegal, because Srinivasan had already bought a team earlier that year. Manohar was a part of the committee that reviewed the BCCI constitution and changed it. Earlier this year, the Supreme Court struck down this amendment. Manohar was the president when Lalit Modi was kicked out of the IPL and the BCCI, and when IPL teams Rajasthan Royals and Kings XI Punjab were terminated; the two teams went to the courts and were soon back in the IPL. The Kochi IPL team was also terminated, but the BCCI got a setback on that front too — the board has been asked to pay the team owners Rs 550 crore and interest on this sum. Modi is painted as the villain in the IPL/BCCI foreign exchange rule violations made when the IPL was moved to South Africa in 2009. But Manohar was the BCCI president then, and a member of the IPL governing council. He can’t escape blame. In fact, the Enforcement Directorate had served a notice on Manohar too on this issue. Four years before he became the BCCI president the first time, when he presided over the Vidarbha Cricket Association (VCA), he was a key protagonist in an infamous cricket episode. Indian captain Sourav Ganguly pulled out of a Test match against Australia at Nagpur in 2004 as he was angry over the amount of grass left on the pitch. India lost the match because the conditions favoured Australia’s pace bowlers, who took 16 of the 20 Indian wickets. The grass had been left on the pitch, despite Ganguly’s requests, because VCA/Manohar faction wanted to spite then BCCI president Jagmohan Dalmiya, who had beaten Manohar’s mentor, Sharad Pawar, in an acrimonious election a few weeks back. Manohar, thus, worked against the interests of the Indian team. These instances show that while Manohar might possess great personal integrity, he had to go with the flow in the BCCI politics. The commercial and factional factors were too strong for him to resist. This time around, Manohar might have a greater chance to implement his own vision and clean up the BCCI. There’s a great public support for a clean-up, and the Supreme Court is deeply interested in it. The Supreme Court-appointed Lodha Committee is working on a blueprint to reform the BCCI. Manohar has the mandate to cleanse the BCCI. He has the chance to walk the talk and actually demonstrate his integrity with his actions – this, alas, hadn’t happened during his first term.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T12:32:29.875+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
