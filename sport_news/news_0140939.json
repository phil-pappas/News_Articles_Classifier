Coach Danny Blind on Friday called up 20-year-old Ajax winger Anwar El-Ghazi as a possible replacement on the right flank. \nIceland and the Czech Republic have already qualified from Group A. After a disastrous qualifying campaign, the Netherlands is two points adrift of third-place Turkey fighting for a playoff spot. \nBlind also is missing defender Stefan de Vrij for the final two qualifiers. The Dutch travel to Astana to play Kazakhstan on Oct. 10 and take on the Czech Republic three days later in Amsterdam. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T14:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T14:55:41.987+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
