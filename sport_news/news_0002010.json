The Bills landed Monday morning, while the Jaguars, who were making the trip for the third straight year, decided to get in Friday morning and treat it like a west coast game.\n\"It was a little bit of an adjustment,\" Jaguars defensive tackle Roy Miller said. \"I've been here five times, and this time was different. Every other time I came early, but once we got adjusted to the time, took a nap the first day and got some sleep, it was one of the best experiences yet.\"\nThe Jaguars beat the Bills, 34-31 .\nA sleep expert told Yahoo earlier this week that the Bills would be at a huge advantage , but Jaguars players seemed to enjoy getting in later in the week.\n\"It just felt like a west coast game,\" Jaguars defensive end Andre Branch said. \"That's what it was. It was a little bit longer flight, but we treated it like a west coast game and it paid off.\"\nBills coach Rex Ryan said he was advised that coming earlier in the week was the smarter move. Truth be told, the Bills were probably hurt more by EJ Manuel turning the ball over three times than they were by any sleep schedule.\nStill, the Jaguars think they have the formula to stick to for future trips.\n\"I'm sure we're going to start doing it now, because the last two times we lost doing it the other way,\" Branch said. \"I think we'll still to this one.\"", "external_links":
