Their 30-7 home loss Saturday night put the Spartans 1 1/2 games behind the Aztecs rather than a half-game ahead.. \nThe postgame theme was about moving on -- coach Ron Caragher spoke of the need \"to hose off the ugliness\" -- but senior defensive tackle Tony Popovich spoke the greatest truth. \"It's definitely not easy,\" Popovich said. \"But it's something we have to do.\" San Diego State's Donnel Pumphrey scores a touchdown on a run against San Jose State in the first quarter at Spartan Stadium in San Jose, Calif., on Saturday, Oct. 17, 2015. (Jim Gensheimer/Bay Area News Group) ( Jim Gensheimer ) \nThe Spartans weren't competitive Saturday, and now San Diego State has a strong hold on a weak division. The Aztecs (4-3, 3-0) are the only team in the six-team West Division with a winning overal record and SJSU (3-4, 2-2) is the only other team with as many as two victories That provides some modicum of hope that the Spartans could still sneak their way back into the race. \nBut in reality, San Jose State needs to focus on the bowl-eligibility math. The Spartans need to win three of their final five games to qualify. Two of those are road games in notoriously tough places (Nevada and Hawaii) and two others are against teams that have been ranked in the top 25 at one point this season (BYU and Boise State). Advertisement \nThat makes next week's home game against New Mexico (4-3, 2-1) an almost must-win scenario. Caragher's first order of business is to pick his team up off the mat. \n\"Sometimes as people we get so frustrated from tough incidents that we don't move on,\" Caragher said. \"I think our guys felt the pain. They're human. They'll feel the pain from that. We're going to have to shake that. It's still early in the season.\" \nBut it's not that early, and the New Mexico team that comes into Spartan Stadium on Saturday night isn't the same team that has won two or fewer conference games every year since 2008. The Lobos rallied to beat Hawaii 28-27 in the final minute Saturday and, although their two conference wins are against last-place teams, they run the triple option offense that has given SJSU fits over the past three years. \nThe Spartans need to be better prepared. They clearly weren't ready for what San Diego State threw at them defensively, and Caragher took responsibility for that. \n\"I run the scout team during practice and I need to a better job simulating,\" Caragher said. \"I certainly didn't do a good job simulating San Diego State's defense.\" For more San Jose State coverage, visit the SpartanCentral blog at blogs.mercurynews.com/sjsu .
