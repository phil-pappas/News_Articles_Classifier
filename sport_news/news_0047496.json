To stop or reduce the high levels of murders in Savannah, the mental health of gun owners will have to be addressed.\nIf a person kills another person because they were disrespected, just got in the way, did not hand over their money while being robbed or looked at them funny, you and I know that the shooter has a mental disorder. Most of the time the shooter cannot articulate the reason for shooting someone.\nThe pillars of amoral, asocial and homicidal behavior in the Savannah black community are: the psychogenic/cellular/molecular retention of the experience of slavery passed down through generations, racism, poverty, drugs, the lack of cultural and grandmotherly guidance, and the diminution of spirituality.\nThe Savannah-Chatham County Public School System has not addressed adequately the student discipline pipeline to jail problem. From birth, many African-American children suffer mentally from the influence of diabolically created “American Urban Culture.” A true African-centric cultural emerging would be mentally therapeutic.\nJuveniles and juvenile criminals are not fully matured until they reach the age of 24 years old. This fact is frequently overlooked. Criminal recidivism is an indicator that appropriate psychotherapy was not adequately provided during maturation.\nWithout addressing the primary cause of homicidal behavior, more policemen on the streets of Savannah may help, but will not curtail most of the shootings.\nPAUL LAWRENCE JOHNSON\nSavannah\nGlobal warming just another freedom being taken away\nIn 1800, the U.S. was just beginning as a free nation. Travel was by foot or horse and wagon (if you were well off) or by row boat or sailboat by water. Average annual income (in today’s dollars) was well below $3,000 a year and life expectancy was about 40 years.\nThe steam engine had been invented and steam railroads and steamships were being invented. The gasoline engine was invented and automobiles, trucks, railroads and ships made the world go round.\nBy the year 2000, the average life expectancy in the U.S. and Europe was 75 years and the average annual income was about $40,000.\nThe fuel for this boom was mostly coal and oil, which produced carbon dioxide (CO2) as an exhaust product. The air in industrial cities became smoky and gritty. In the 1950s and ’60s, there were programs to clean up the exhausts from industrial plants and automobiles. Now these exhausts are mostly invisible and harmless.\nHowever, this boom is now at risk because of global warming.\nNot because the globe is actually warming — the global temperature has not changed at all in the last 17 years — but because a group of people want more control of our country and more control of you and more power for themselves.\nThey have hijacked a group of scientists who have written computer programs that predict disastrous world temperature increases. The predictions have been wrong every year for the past 17 years.\nThe global warmists claim that CO2 is the cause of manmade global warming, and therefore they must regulate burning of fuel, which is the main producer of CO2. Coal is one of the highest producers of CO2 while natural gas is a much lower producer.\nThe EPA wants to limit CO2 emissions to such a low level that many coal burning power plants will have to shut down causing your electric bill to sky rocket and your electricity supply to be less dependable. It also wants to raise gasoline taxes making it very costly for you to drive your car and for businesses to operate.\nGlobal warming is just one way our freedoms are being taken away from us by Big Government.\nWe need to wake up.\nGEORGE FAWCETT\nSavannah\nObama Administration thinks we’ll believe anything\nA few days ago, we were notified that there will be no cost of living increase next year due to the low cost of gasoline.\nFellow seniors: We are being misled again by this administration.\nAbout two to three years ago, when we were almost paying $4 for a gallon of gas, we were notified that energy and food were removed from the list of items that determine the cost of living.\nThese items were removed to keep the percentage of increase lower, thus lower cost of living increase.\nI recall saying, what the devil do seniors purchase regularly? The two items they pulled from the lineup.\nI swear this administration feels it can tell us anything and sometime later contradict what it said. I guess we are like the architect of Obamacare who told a senate committee, we are stupid and will believe anything.\nChalk this up along with, “You can keep your doctor. You can keep your medical plan.”\nRALPH PEREIRA\nSavannah", "external_links": ["http://sav-cdn.com/sites/all/themes/savannahnow/images/blank.gif"], "published": "2015-10-17T18:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T14:10:22.133+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
