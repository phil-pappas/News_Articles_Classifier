His first two touchdowns were on short runs, but his last one, which secured victory, covered 10 yards with 1:47 remaining. Swoopes ran for 13 and 29 yards on the previous two plays. \nTexas (3-4, 2-2 Big 12) rushed for 274 yards, maintaining a strength the Longhorns created with 313 yards on the ground - its most since 2013 - during a victory against Oklahoma on Oct. 10. \nTailback Johnathan Gray led Texas with 103 yards against Kansas State (3-4, 0-4). \nCharles Jones, Kansas State's junior running back, rushed for a career-best 122 yards. Jones gained 87 in the second half. \nKansas State has lost four consecutive games for the first time since 2005. Copyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
