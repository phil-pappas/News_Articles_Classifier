Embattled Missouri Tigers quarterback Maty Mauk was in the stands to watch his father Mike and brother, offensive coordinator Ben Mauk, coach Glendale to its first playoff win in their two seasons with the Falcons. \n“I think our guys have come a long way. We’re nowhere near we want to be, but they’ve been resilient,” Mike Mauk said. “They work hard, they’ve committed themselves to trying to be the very best they can.” \nGlendale sophomore quarterback Alex Huston went 33-of-41 passing for 470 yards and nine passing touchdowns, an apparent state record. His season total of 5,108 passing yards also appears to break a record set in 2005.

With 26 touchdown receptions on the season, Montgomery ties the Missouri record and surpasses the Springfield Public Schools record of 24 touchdowns in a season held by Hillcrest graduate Dorial Green-Beckham, now of the NFL’s Tennessee Titans. \nMauk sent his players directly to two waiting buses after the game and did not make them available for postgame interviews. Mauk said that the team’s success matters more than chasing individual milestones. \n“I don’t think it’s something that they shoot for,” Mauk said. “The most important thing is to try to help us win.” Buy Photo \nGlendale High School linebacker Ian Marshall (9) celebrates after sacking Bulldogs quarterback Quintin Batson (not pictured) in second quarter action of the Falcons' game against Central High School at Harrison Stadium in Springfield, Mo. on Oct. 23, 2015.

Bulldogs coach Lorenzo Williams complimented Glendale for its stellar attack. \n“What they do is really unique, we’re not used to seeing it. (Glendale) did a good job of making plays when they had to make plays,” Williams said. “I’ve got to give a hats off to Mike and Ben, they do a great job over there. I feel like I just got beat by a hall of fame coach.” \nCentral sophomore Garrett King carried the ball 25 times for 135 yards and three touchdowns in the loss. Seth Holyfield scored a touchdown on a two-yard run in the fourth quarter of what would be his final high school football game. \nWhile there were tears in the Central locker room and the departure of four seniors to observe, Williams encouraged his team to be positive. Central had not enjoyed a winning season since 2002.

Don’t hang our heads down about one loss,’ because it’s bigger than that.” \nGlendale advances to the district semifinals and will play on the road Oct. 30 at 7 p.m. at Republic (5-4), the recipients of the No. 1 seed and a first round bye in the seven-team district. 2 CONNECT 14 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://sgfnow.co/1S1QV3A TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T07:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T15:25:22.664+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
