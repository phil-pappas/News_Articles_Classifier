The Giants were good enough on Sunday, aided greatly by a Buffalo team that couldn’t get out of its own way, in a 24-10 road win. After losing in heart-breaking fashion to Dallas in the opening week of the season and falling to Atlanta in a game that got away the next week, the Giants are back to .500. In an NFC East that’s now up for grabs following the Tony Romo injury and the Eagles’ 1-3 start, the Giants are suddenly back in the mix. This team will get prime-time games in each of the next two weeks and both games certainly look winnable. Sunday, the Giants host San Francisco in NBC’s late game of the week. Eight days later, it’s off to Philly for a Monday night tilt against the Eagles. Sitting at 4-2 heading into the big Oct. 25 showdown against Dallas is a distinct possibility for this Giants team. Sure, the Giants have righted the ship following their dreadful start. But there is still plenty of work left for this team to do in the weeks to come. The defense played well on Sunday, holding the Bills to three points through the first three quarters. Buffalo, however, never established its running game – falling behind early can do that to an offense – and a ridiculous amount of penalties (17 for 135 yards) also crippled the Bills’ offensive efforts. Buffalo’s first-year starting quarterback Tyrod Taylor did throw for 274 yards, but the Bills were 3-for-16 on third-down conversion attempts and did not score in any of their three trips to the red zone. The Giants' deserve credit where it’s due. Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie and J.T. Thomas combined to make a huge tackle at the goal line early in the fourth quarter, keeping the Bills out of the end zone. Prince Amukamara made a key strip and fumble recovery to thwart a Bills’ drive later in the quarter. Nikita Whitlock and Cullen Jenkins did sack Taylor during that final Bills’ drive, but those were the only two sacks the Giants had all day. That’s not exactly a scary amount of pressure being generated on a quarterback who dropped back 42 times. Offensively, there were a few highlights for the Giants as well. Odell Beckham made another unbelievable one-handed catch, only to fall out of bounds on the landing. Beckham finished with five receptions for 38 yards, well below what we’ve come to expect from the talented young wideout. Of course, there was Rashad Jennings’ 51-yard touchdown scramble down the sideline that put the Giants up two touchdowns with just less than eight minutes to play. Still, Brad Wing had to punt eight times in this game as the Giants were barely better than the Bills on third downs, converting three times on 15 chances. After digging themselves a deep, deep hole through the first two weeks, the Giants have climbed out of that hole in the last two weeks. That bodes well for this team, especially with its upcoming schedule. But it’s hard to be so bullish on these Giants, not quite yet. The team made big plays when it needed to on Sunday in Buffalo, but there’s a certain consistency that’s missing. Can this team run the ball for first downs? Can it get to the passer on non-obvious passing plays? That’s the challenge for the Giants on Sunday night against San Francisco. In prime time. All eyes will be watching.
