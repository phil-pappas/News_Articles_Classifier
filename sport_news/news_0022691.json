The Lady Cyclones made sure that would not happen as they rolled to a 25-12, 25-15 Prairieland Conference victory. West Prairie improved to 21-7 overall, 10-0 in Prairieland play. Lewistown slipped to 17-9 overall, 7-2 in league play. With the victory, the Lady Cyclones clinched no worse than a share of the title with Elmwood/Brimfield. West Prairie can win the crown outright Monday with a win against Rushville-Industry at Rushville on Senior Night for the Lady Rockets. “Winning the Prairieland Conference is one of our team goals,” said West Prairie coach Teri Paul. “We’re one step closer.” Seniors Sydney Broadhead, Emily Phillips and Molly Torrance were honored prior to the varsity match and all three contributed to the victory. “The team feels very good about the leadership that they provide and the people that they are,” said Paul. Phillips recorded six digs, while Broadhead chalked up four kills for West Prairie. Torrance chipped in three service points, including an ace. “It was a good night for the seniors,” said Paul. “I wanted to see a lot more energy with it being Senior Night,” she added. “But they’re a quiet group.” Denied a chance for the Prairieland title a year ago with a loss at Lewistown, the Lady Cyclones left little doubt Tuesday. After a Haley Jockisch kill gave the visitors a 2-1 lead, West Prairie soon got on a roll, scoring 10 of the next 11 points. Phillips tallied five service points and Broadhead three as Peyton Bowman recorded a pair of kills. That allowed the home team to build a 11-3 edge. A four-point service run by Hannah Thompson that included a pair of kills by Broadhead pushed the West Prairie lead to 17-6. Lewistown got no closer than 10 points the rest of the set as the Lady Cyclones needed just 17 minutes to win the opening game. Set two saw West Prairie break a 5-5 tie with a 10-point service run by Thompson. That included a pair of aces, along with a pair of kills by Julie Shoemaker, and a kill and a block by Pema Zellman. Lewistown inched within 17-11, but kills by Bowman and Thompson pushed the margin back to eight and the Lady Indians got no closer than seven points the rest of the way as West Prairie wrapped up the contest in 36 minutes. Bowman finished with seven kills, while Thompson added five for West Prairie. Shoemaker recorded 4.5 blocks, while Cora Vyhnanek tallied 15 set assists and three digs. Thompson and Karlee Herman added three digs each, while Kendra Hopping chipped in three set assists for the victors. Page 2 of 2 - Tuesday’s win added momentum from Saturday when West Prairie posted a 5-0 record in winning the United Township Tournament. That included three set wins against United Township in the semifinals and Limestone in the title contest. “The weekend was fantastic. Overall, we played very well,” said Paul. “We had one set against (United Township) that we came out flat in the semifinals. But we were able to come back in sets two and three to really play well and fight hard. “We showed a lot of good team fortitude, moxie, whatever you want to call it to get to that championship match against Limestone,” she added. “They have two dominant lefts, but we were able to block and dig and do well. It was a very solid match for us. A big confidence booster to get a tournament win and to play overall pretty well for the entirety of it.” Jockisch tallied six kills for Lewistown. Skyler Mikulich added 13 set assists and Lexi Beyers eight digs for the Lady Indians. The fresh-soph match saw Lewistown defeat West Prairie 27-25, 25-12 in 45 minutes.
