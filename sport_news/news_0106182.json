(AP Photo/Gregory Bull) NEW YORK – Terry Collins wouldn’t say whether he felt Chase Utley should be disciplined for his aggressive slide into Ruben Tejada in Game 2 Saturday night.\nBut the Mets manager admitted the play, which broke Tejada’s right fibula, was something that needed to be addressed.\n“But I’ll let Major League Baseball handle that,” Collins said during a news conference Sunday.\nHours later, MLB chief baseball officer Joe Torre announced Utley has been suspended for Games 3 and 4.\nTorre reiterated in a statement that it’s up to an umpire to determine whether or not a baserunner intentionally interfered with a fielder attempting to turn a double play, and it’s a call that is not subject to review.\n“However, after thoroughly reviewing the play from all conceivable angles, I have concluded that Mr. Utley’s action warrants discipline,” Torre said.\nUtley’s slide, Torre said, violated the rule that is designed to protect fielders from that type of “rolling block that occurs away from the base.”\nUtley appealed the suspension quickly and the Dodgers expect a hearing will take place before tonight’s game.\n\n“The New York Mets completely support the decision made by Major League Baseball to suspend Chase Utley for two games and feel this was the appropriate course of action,” the team said in a statement. “With this decision behind us, the team and our fans can now focus on playing winning baseball.”\nThe Mets made their cross-country flight from Los Angeles still disappointed about losing Tejada. Collins said he was shaken, “because I thought it was something that didn’t need to happen.”\nBut Dodgers manager Don Mattingly said he thought it was an aggressive, legal slide, “but since someone got hurt, now it’s a story.”\n“If it would have been their guy, they would be saying, ‘David Wright, he’s a gamer; he went after him,’Ÿ” Mattingly said. “But it’s our guy, it’s different. So I know how the New York media gets a little bit going, and it gets dramatic. But for me you can’t have it both ways. If David would have done it, it wouldn’t have been any problem, here in New York.”\nRegardless, the Mets are left without their top defensive shortstop for the remainder of their postseason run. That means Wilmer Flores will be starting at a position where he’s struggled in the past.\nThe 24-year-old committed 14 errors in 103 regular-season games at shortstop. But Collins said he’s confident Flores can handle the pressure of starting in the playoffs.\nFlores always has been a bigger offensive threat than Tejada. He finished the regular season hitting .263 with 16 home runs and 59 RBI.\nFlores also endeared himself to Mets fans when he cried on the field on July 29 thinking he had been traded to the Brewers along with Zack Wheeler for Carlos Gomez.\nUltimately, the deal fell through. Now Flores finds himself starting in the playoffs.\n“I’ve been ready since we started the postseason,” Flores said after Saturday’s game.\nBut his health has recently been a question.\nBack issues forced him out of a game on Sept. 30, and he also dealt with a bout of strep throat, which caused him to lose about 10 to 15 pounds in a matter of days. Collins said Flores hadn’t been able to eat and was taking medication that was helping.\n“But has he put all the weight back on? No, not really,” Collins said. “But as long as he’s got some energy, that’s all that matters because he didn’t have it for a while.”\nThe Mets likely will have some insurance at shortstop. Collins said Sunday that prospect Matt Reynolds was on his way to New York, but the team would make a final decision about their roster today.\nBut Collins is plenty confident in Flores.\n“I think he’s grown through the season,” Collins said. “Go out and just catch the ball and make the routine play, which is all we’ve ever asked any of those guys to do.”\nEmail: iseman@northjersey.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T01:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T01:11:39.059+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
