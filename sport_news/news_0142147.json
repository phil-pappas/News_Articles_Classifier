NEW YORK — The celebration was subdued. There wasn’t much running, or jumping. Perhaps, there was more relief than anything.\nAfter all, it shouldn’t have taken this long.\nBut on the first day of October, the Yankees finally made it official: for the first time since 2012, they’re headed back to the postseason.\nThe Yankees beat the Red Sox, 4-1, at the Stadium, clinching the first of the two spots in Tuesday night’s wild-card game.\nThat wasn’t the only reason to celebrate: this was the 10,000th victory in the franchise’s history, dating to 1903.\nCC Sabathia pitched well on a brisk and rainy night, going five innings, allowing six hits and only one earned run in his team’s final regular-season home game of the season. Their wild-card opponent is yet to be determined, but the game will be played at Yankee Stadium if the Yankees win once this weekend or if Houston loses once.\nCarlos Beltran put the Yankees ahead with a solo home run in the second inning, a lead they would not relinquish.\nTwo rookies made sure of that: Greg Bird hit a solo homer in the seventh inning — his 11th since being called up in mid-August — to give the Yankees a 3-1 lead. And in the eighth, Rob Refsnyder hit a monstrous solo home run over the left-field bullpen to make it 4-1.\nThe three-game losing streak was over. And, suddenly, the playoffs loom large on the horizon.\nDespite the struggles heading into Thursday night, manager Joe Girardi was pleased with what he’s seen from his team in recent days.\nWhile many see a team reeling and limping toward the playoffs — the Yankees played exactly .500 baseball in August and September — Girardi sees a team that’s fighting.\nYes, the Yankees had lost the first three of this four-game series against a Red Sox team with nothing to play for. But in the previous two losses, the Yankees had rallied back from huge first-inning deficits.\n“The fight is there, that’s not a concern of mine,” Girardi said. “They’re playing hard, trying to win games. We’ve had some opportunities to score some runs that we haven’t. But that’s something that offenses go through during the course of the year, and hopefully that changes.”\nThe Yankees stranded 15 runners in Wednesday night’s loss. But in Thursday’s game, they set a different tone early.\nBeltran’s 19th home run of the season leading off the bottom of the second was a high fly ball that just cleared the right-field wall. With two outs in the second, Brendan Ryan smacked a ball through the left side of the drenched infield, driving in John Ryan Murphy and giving the Yankees a 2-0 lead.\nThat was enough for, Sabathia who turned in a solid performance — albeit without David Ortiz or Dustin Pedroia in the Boston lineup — on a night when the conditions were far from ideal.\nLess than 30 minutes before the game began, the infield was still covered by a tarp and a steady rain was falling. The precipitation didn’t let up, but the grounds crew removed the tarp and got the field ready for play.\nThe rain was still falling steadily when Sabathia threw the game’s first pitch in front of a mostly empty stadium; the fans had congregated in the concourses and under awnings, looking for shelter from the chilly precipitation.\nThe rain lightened up as the night went on, but never really went away. Still, Sabathia was dominant through the first four innings, allowing only three hits and not allowing a runner to reach scoring position.\nIn the fifth inning, however, he began to struggle. The lefty allowed three hits, capped by an RBI single by new Yankee nemesis Mookie Betts. But with the bases loaded, he was able to get out of the jam by inducing a Travis Shaw fly-out to center field. He had done his job, and in the process, given his team a chance to clinch — finally.\nEmail: vasqueza@northjersey.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T02:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T06:31:44.778+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
