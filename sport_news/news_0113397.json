(Elaine Thompson / Associated Press) Associated Press \nORCHARD PARK, N.Y. -- Andy Dalton threw three touchdown passes and the unbeaten Cincinnati Bengals won their sixth straight to match the team's best start to a season with a 34-21 victory over the Buffalo Bills on Sunday. \nWith star receiver A.J. Green covered much of the game, Dalton completed touchdown passes to Marvin Jones, Tyler Eifert and Jeremy Hill. Dalton finished 22 of 33 for 243 yards for Cincinnati, which was also 6-0 to start the 1975 and '88 seasons. \nThe Bengals broke the game open by scoring 17 points on their first three second-half possessions to build a 34-14 lead. \nThe Bills (3-3) were undone by injuries and several penalties that allowed the Bengals to enjoy an average drive start of midfield in the first half. \nBackup quarterback EJ Manuel started in place of Tyrod Taylor, who was sidelined with a sprained left knee. Manuel finished 28 of 42 for 263 yards with a touchdown and interception. \nPanthers 27, Seahawks 23 Landry Jones Jared Wickerham / Getty Images \nSteelers quarterback Landry Jones celebrates after connecting on a 88-yard touchdown pass with Martavius Bryant in the fourth quarter Sunday. \nSteelers quarterback Landry Jones celebrates after connecting on a 88-yard touchdown pass with Martavius Bryant in the fourth quarter Sunday. (Jared Wickerham / Getty Images) \nSEATTLE -- Cam Newton threw a 26-yard touchdown pass to Greg Olsen with 32 seconds left to help Carolina remain unbeaten as the expense of reeling Seattle. \nNewton led the Panthers (5-0) to touchdowns on their final two possessions after trailing 23-14, the second straight week the Seahawks collapsed in the fourth quarter. Newton found Olsen wide open down the seam as All-Pros Earl Thomas and Richard Sherman looked at each other in confusion. \nNewton was 12 of 15 for 169 yards in the fourth quarter and threw for 269 yards overall. He led the Panthers on a pair of 80-yard touchdown drives in the final period as the Panthers improved to 5-0 for the second time in franchise history. \nIt was the second straight week the Seahawks (2-4) suffered a late defensive meltdown. \nBroncos 26, Browns 23 (OT) \nCLEVELAND -- Peyton Manning shook off three interceptions and drove Denver in range for Brandon McManus' 34-yard field goal with 4:56 left in overtime to keep the Broncos among the NFL's unbeaten teams. \nManning took the Broncos from their 12 to the Cleveland 16 before McManus kicked his game-winner to make Denver 6-0 for the seventh time in franchise history. The Broncos only rallied thanks to their top-ranked defense, which came up big in overtime. \nAfter Manning's third pick, Denver recorded two sacks to push the Browns (2-4) out of field-goal range. \nGiven another chance, Manning took over. He completed 4 of 4 passes for 39 yards on the last drive. \nThe extra period came after a frenetic fourth quarter during which Cleveland took the lead on an interception return only to have Manning take it back 14 seconds later with a 75-yard touchdown pass. \n49ers 25, Ravens 20 \nSANTA CLARA, Calif. -- Colin Kaepernick completed a 76-yard touchdown pass to former Ravens star Torrey Smith and San Francisco intercepted two passes by Joe Flacco to snap a four-game losing streak. \nPhil Dawson kicked four field goals in the first win since Week 1 for San Francisco (2-4), while Anquan Boldin — a Super Bowl star for the Ravens against the Niners — made a 51-yard reception late that set up Quinton Patton's 21-yard TD catch. \nFlacco's desperation pass to the end zone on the final play went incomplete. \nThe rematch of the Super Bowl three seasons ago featured a pair of last-place teams trying to turn around their seasons, and it showed in some sloppy play. \nSteve Smith caught a 34-yard TD pass from Flacco in the third, but the Ravens (1-5) are reeling through the worst start in franchise history. Tough weekend for the Harbaugh brothers after Baltimore coach John Harbaugh's brother Jim's Michigan team lost Saturday to Michigan State on a botched punt. \nSteelers 25, Cardinals 13 \nPITTSBURGH -- Landry Jones threw two touchdown passes to Martavis Bryant in relief of Michael Vick and Pittsburgh rallied for the win over Arizona. \nVick left in the third quarter with a hamstring injury and Pittsburgh's offense took off when Jones took over. Jones hit Bryant for an 8-yard score to give the Steelers the lead. The two hooked up later for an 88-yard strike as the Steelers (4-2) won their second straight. \nJones completed 8 of 12 passes for 168 yards and the two scores. Bryant caught six passes for 137 yards in his first action of the season. Le'Veon Bell ran for 88 yards and rookie Chris Boswell kicked three long field goals for the Steelers. \nCarson Palmer threw for 421 yards with a touchdown and two interceptions. John Brown caught 10 balls for 196 yards but the Cardinals collapsed in the second half. \nLions 37, Bears 34 (OT) \nDETROIT -- Matt Prater kicked a 27-yard field goal with 2:29 left in overtime to help Detroit get its first victory of the season. \nMatthew Stafford heaved a 57-yard pass to Calvin Johnson to set up the kick for the Lions (1-5). Johnson finished with six receptions for 166 yards. \nThe Bears (2-4) had chances for a third straight comeback win. \nChicago's Robbie Gould kicked a 29-yard field goal as time expired in regulation. The tying score was set up by Darius Slay getting called for interference after Jay Cutler's 25- and 24-yard passes to Alshon Jeffery. \nStafford threw a go-ahead, 6-yard touchdown pass to a leaping Johnson in the end zone with 21 seconds left in the fourth following consecutive penalties. \nVikings 16, Chiefs 10 \nMINNEAPOLIS -- Minnesota's defense and rookie wide receiver Stefon Diggs bailed out Teddy Bridgewater from an erratic performance, and the Vikings held on to beat mistake-prone Kansas City. \nAlex Smith's 42-yard touchdown pass to Albert Wilson midway through the fourth quarter pulled the Chiefs within three points, but the Vikings (3-2) played well enough early to survive their ragged finish. \nCharcandrick West, one of their replacements for the injured Chiefs star Jamaal Charles, lost a fumble down the stretch. The Chiefs (1-5) had eight penalties enforced for 95 yards. \nDiggs had 129 yards on seven catches on a day when Bridgewater threw two interceptions. Adrian Peterson, who was on the sideline late in the game with the Vikings trying to put it away, finished with 60 yards on 26 carries. \nDolphins 38, Titans 10 \nNASHVILLE, Tenn. -- Cameron Wake got his first four sacks this season and also forced two fumbles — all in the first half — as Miami routed Tennessee Tin Dan Campbell's debut as interim coach. \nThe Dolphins (2-3) came in having lost three straight, costing coach Joe Philbin his job Oct. 5. \nWith Campbell preaching a more fun and physical approach, the Dolphins finished with six sacks and intercepted Marcus Mariota twice. The rookie quarterback needed a knee brace and was replaced by Zach Mettenberger after the 2-minute warning. \nMiami had been one of two teams in the NFL without a rushing touchdown, but Jarvis Landry ended the drought with a TD run, and Lamar Miller ran for 113 yards and a TD. \nThe Titans (1-4) lost their fourth straight, and their home skid is up to eight dating to last season. \nJets 34, Redskins 20 \nEAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. -- Ryan Fitzpatrick threw two touchdown passes and ran for another score, and the New York Jets overcame a sloppy first half to beat banged-up Washington. \nChris Ivory ran for 146 yards and a TD on 20 carries for the Jets, who improved to 4-1 for the first time since 2010. Brandon Marshall had seven catches for 111 yards, and Eric Decker also caught a TD. \nThe Jets, coming off a bye-week break, trailed 13-10 at halftime, with the Redskins (2-4) scoring their points off three turnovers — all by Bashaud Breeland. \nBut New York opened the second half with 24 straight points to take control against a Washington team without several starters, including wide receiver DeSean Jackson and cornerbacks DeAngelo Hall and Chris Culliver. \nKirk Cousins finished with a touchdown and two interceptions for the Redskins. \nTexans 31, Jaguars 20 \nJACKSONVILLE, Fla. -- Brian Hoyer threw three touchdown passes on third down, two to DeAndre Hopkins, as Houston won at Jacksonville. \nHoyer regained the starting job last week against Indianapolis and looked deserving of the spot. At least against the Jaguars (1-5), who lost their fourth in a row and surely raised more questions about coach Gus Bradley's job security. \nThe Texans (2-4) started emptying the stadium midway through the fourth after Andre Hal returned an interception 41 yards for a touchdown and a 31-14 lead. It was the sixth pick-six thrown by Blake Bortles in 19 career starts. \nHoyer and Hopkins pretty much had the game in hand well before that. \nHoyer was at his best on the game's most important down, connecting with Arian Foster on third-and-goal from the 7 and then hooking up with Hopkins for two more third-down TDs.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T02:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T07:45:00.956+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
