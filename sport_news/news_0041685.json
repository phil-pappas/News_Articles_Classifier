DT 6-1 170 4-star In the nearly two decades that Mike Farrell has followed recruiting as analyst for Rivals.com, he can’t remember a time when a program received a verbal commitment on the same day the school’s head coach departed. While Spurrier was announcing his resignation during a press conference at Williams-Brice Stadium Tuesday afternoon, Darius Whitfield, a four-star defensive tackle from Mobile, Ala., told reporters that he’d be playing at South Carolina next season. “I was shocked that Whitefield decided to go ahead and make that commitment today,” said Farrell, the website’s national recruiting director. “Any day, that’s a really good pickup for the Gamecocks, it just so happens it comes on the same day that Spurrier resigns.” The fact that Spurrier won’t be his head coach didn’t seem to bother Whitfield, who had offers from Florida, Missouri, Mississippi State and Kentucky. “I’ve always loved the Gamecocks,” Whitfield told AL.com. “Jadeveon Clowney was one of my favorite players. I also felt like South Carolina was always very sincere with me in my recruitment. I feel like I can go up there and compete right away.” The Gamecocks currently have the nation’s 35th-ranked recruiting class and the ninth in the SEC, according to Rivals.com. Of the players that have already verbally committed prior to Spurrier’s announcement, only one — outside linebacker P.J. Blue — has publicly decommitted from the program. Farrell said Blue was already wavering on his commitment even before Spurrier resigned. “It doesn’t surprise me that he decommited so quickly,” Farrell said. Another casualty of Spurrier’s decision could be defensive back Marlon Character, a four-star recruit out of Atlanta. “I know that Auburn has been heavily involved with Marlon even after he committed to South Carolina,” Farrell said. “It wouldn’t surprise me to see him jump ship. I think this class will be fine, it’ll be as good as a class can be during a transition like this. They have some talent in it. It doesn’t have the depth you’d like, but they’ve got some players that can definitely help.” The Gamecocks other top prospects — quarterback Brandon McIlwain and wide receivers Kelvin Harmon and Bryon Edwards — all have said publicly that they remain committed to South Carolina. “It’ll be interesting to see if McIlwain stays with his commitment because when you’re a quarterback you want to play for Steve Spurrier,” Farrell said. When the news first hit social media Monday night, Edwards, a four-star prospect at Conway High School, said he is still committed to the Gamecocks, but will keep his options open. “As of now I’m verbally committed to South Carolina,” Edwards said on Twitter. “South Carolina is my home and I have tons of love and respect for it and the University of South Carolina, their program and fans. Obviously, the timing of coach Spurrier’s retirement is a surprise and sad thing to see. However, at the same time I have to do what’s best for me and my future as a student-athlete. I will be contemplating my future in the next few weeks in light of recent events.” It was widely known that Spurrier was never an enthusiastic recruiter, Farrell said. He left most of the heavy lifting to his assistant coaches, especially to his son Steve Spurrier, Jr., the Gamecocks’ wide receivers coach and recruiting coordinator. “The last couple of recruiting classes have been a disaster,” Farrell said. “It’s pretty common knowledge that Spurrier didn’t like the recruiting aspect of coaching at the college level. We knew that back at Florida. He’s not going to live and breathe it like an Urban Myer or some of the others. Recruiting really took a hit last season when he came out and said he was only going to be around for two more years. That was a huge mistake. That’s why you saw all of those kids start to decommit.” The Spurrier brand alone was enough for many recruits to attend South Carolina. Few coaches have the national reputation or name recognition as Spurrier. “Steve Spurrier is a legend and college football doesn’t have many legends,” Farrell said. “There are not many programs where a kid will pick a school because of the head coach. Steve Spurrier was one of those coaches. Urban Myer is a legend. Nick Saban is a legend. Kids picked South Carolina simply because they wanted to play for Steve Spurrier and be a part of that legacy.” Farrell actually believes that recruiting under the next coach could be better. “I think if they get the right coach who is really going to emphasize recruiting and really compete for some of these kids I actually think that they’ll be better off recruiting wise,” Farrell said. “The problem is that those players won’t be playing for Steve Spurrier and that’s a bigger issue. I just don’t know if you can replace Steve Spurrier the coach. It’ll be easy to replace Steve Spurrier the recruiter.” Farrell said several coaches that should be on South Carolina’s wish list are Alabama assistant coach Kirby Smart, Southern Methodist’s Chad Morris, Houston head coach Tom Herman and Memphis head coach Justin Fuente. “They need someone young, they need someone energetic or someone well-known in the Southeast,” Farrell said. “If they get one of those guys I actually think that recruiting will improve because there will be a lot more attention paid to it. The head coach will be a lot more involved. “If I’m a South Carolina fan I’m more worried that the greatest coach in my program’s history has left. Steve Spurrier didn’t sign Marcus Lattimore or Jadeveon Clowney. He played his part, but the assistant coaches did most of the work. Recruiting will be fine. The problem is replacing one of the greatest coaches in the history of college football.” Keywords", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T02:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T02:24:45.040+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
