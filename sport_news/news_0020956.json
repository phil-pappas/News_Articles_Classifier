(AP Photo/Gary Landers) \nSEATTLE -- The Seahawks went from the high of highs to the low of lows against the Bengals.\"No matter how many times I look at this,\" head coach Pete Carroll said on Monday, \"I can't get the end to change.\" The Seahawks squandered a 17-point 4th quarter lead against Cincinnati, matching the largest collapse in franchise history. The result: a 27-24 overtime loss, leaving Seattle 2-3 on the season.\"Everybody's pretty disappointed for obvious reasons,\" said Carroll. \"The whole room feels it. Everyone is sharing in it, but the conversation already went to Wednesday. Let's get back and get going. Let's take the things we have improved at, and let's own those things so we can carry them forward. Seattle is staying motivated, because they've been in a similar hole before. It happened just last year. The Seahawks started 3-3 before heading back to the Super Bowl.\"I'm hoping that marker stays with us so we can get moving,\" Carroll said. \"This is the week to get moving, as opposed to the next week. We're running out of time for making a real turnaround here early, and I'd like to see us do that.\" The hits keep coming for Seattle. The Seahawks face another undefeated team this weekend. Seattle plays unbeaten Carolina on Sunday at CenturyLink Field.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T04:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T18:41:58.804+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
