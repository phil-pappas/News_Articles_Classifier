HALSTEAD — The Halstead Dragons will look to take control of Class 3A District 11 Friday night when they take to the road. A win will put them at 2-0 with one game remaining. It would also drop Garden Plain to 1-1. Currently both teams enter this contest undefeated. “It is an exciting week. There will be two pretty good football teams playing on Friday night,” said Jason Grider, coach of the Dragons. “We will do our best to be prepared and it should be a heck of a game.” The Owls are a team Halstead handled one year ago, thumping Garden Plain 58-0. This, however, a different year. “They are a lot better this year. They are undefeated and won their league,” said Halstead coach Jason Grider. “They defeated Hutch Trinity and are 1-0 in district.” Part of the reason for resurgence by the Owls is on the offensive line – most notably 235 pound Jonah Nowak who plays both guard and defensive tackle. “He is one of the best lineman we will see this year,” Grider said. That line has helped the Owls rush for more than 230 yards per game this year. “We will have to be fundamentally sound defensively, for sure,” Grider said. Halstead will face a defense that has recorded 17 interceptions in just seven games. “I think we have seen about what everyone can throw at us. We expect some 4-4 and 5-3,” Grider said. “This year teams want to load the box against us and stop the run, and they will be no different. We will have to be patient offensively and continue to take care of the football.” Grider said despite an injury to running back Blake Beckett last week, he expects the Dragons to at full strength come game time in Garden Plain.
