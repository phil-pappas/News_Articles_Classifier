As he does, he considers his options.\nAs The Realist slowly swathes the tools of his trade, he sees what all good boxers see. He sees the punches coming and knows where the easy escape route is, although now it’s words not fists he’s coping with.\nThere is no sport where being a realist is more important than prize fighting. There is no sport where reality is as starkly revealed, either. So The Realist doesn’t hesitate when someone suggests perhaps he got a raw deal 41⁄2 years ago in Laredo, Texas, when two of three judges gave every round to an undefeated prospect from New York named Gabriel Bracero and not one to the kid from New England making his first appearance on national television.\nFrankly, judging in Texas is known more for its mistakes than for its precision, so many fighters have left that state vowing never to return. The Realist knows that as well, realizing it would be easy, so many years after the fact, to sidestep that night and agree the first defeat of his career had been a shadowy one.\nBut The Realist doesn’t take the opening. Instead he does what works best in boxing. He faces the harsh reality of that outcome and why it happened.\n“I did,” Danny O’Connor says, his voice emotionless and unforgiving. “I absolutely did. I lost every round. I had an eight-round panic attack.\n“It was my first big fight in the limelight. I’d just had my first baby two weeks earlier. It was my first time on television. Those were life-changing events. Ultimately, the stress and worry manifested itself in me not being ready.\n“I didn’t lose to Bracero. I lost to the process. I had a three-month training camp that should have been filled with fun and learning but instead I filled it with stress and anxiety. I didn’t understand how to handle that pressure. It was a spiral of stress and anxiety I couldn’t handle.\n“A loss like that either ruins you or moves you forward. I don’t regret it. It was part of my journey. That was my path.”\nThat path has led O’Connor to an association with boxing’s most powerful figure, promoter/manager Al Haymon, who runs Premier Boxing Champions, as well as a managerial deal with Dropkick Murphys founder Ken Casey. Haymon’s company seems to have television deals with every network in boxing. Shows run regularly on CBS, NBC, ESPN, Bounce, Spike, Showtime . . . and tonight’s headliner on NBC Sports Network is a rematch between O’Connor (26-2, 10 KOs) and Bracero (23-2, 4 KOs) at the Lowell Memorial Auditorium. It is a fight that has been long simmering, like hot chili.\nAs with many fights of this type, the future is on the line for both the 32-year-old Bracero and 30-year-old O’Connor, who was scheduled to face two-time world champion Paulie Malignaggi at Madison Square Garden several months ago in the biggest fight of his career only to see it disappear a week before the bell when Malignaggi pulled out because of a badly cut eye in sparring.\nInstead of the big stage in New York, O’Connor ended up dropping a guy named Chris Gilbert five times at Agganis Arena on his way to a fifth-round stoppage that kept him busy but didn’t further his quest for a shot at one of Haymon’s stable of big-name welterweights. This fight might not either, but O’Connor understands he has to handle this moment far differently than the first time he faced Bracero — because the only option at this stage of his career is to win.\n“I’m a fighter pilot now when it comes to handling the pressure,” he said assuredly. “I’ve done the work to become an adult. I’ve literally carbon copied things.”\nBy that he means, not only is he back on national television against Bracero, but just over a week ago he and his wife had another child. New baby, new limelight, new response to a familiar situation from the Framingham welterweight.\n“Maybe subconsciously this is the way I wanted it,” O’Connor said of the odd circumstances repeating themselves tonight. “I’ve been offered this fight four or five times and always thought it wasn’t quite right. This was the time. I’m ready for it physically, and mentally I’m equipped for it.”\nWhere Bracero is will be difficult to know until the fight begins. While O’Connor has been active on the fringes of the welterweight division, Bracero had a big win over a former contender named Dmitry Salita 16 months ago, but didn’t fight again until April 4 when he lost a decision to undefeated prospect Felix Diaz at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn, on the undercard of another Haymon show.\nThose kind of fights are the ones O’Connor seeks on nights like this, knowing to get them he must first get rid of Bracero for good.\n“I want to match my skills with everyone in the Haymon stable,” O’Connor said. “(WBA champion Keith) Thurman, (ex-champion Shawn) Porter, (two-time champion Andre) Berto. What will come will come.”\nThe Realist understands, however, that while whatever will be will be, what should be isn’t always what happens in boxing. The Malignaggi disappointment was an example of how easily things can slip out of your control without having taken a misstep.\nDealing with that stress was different, however, from his feelings the first time he faced Bracero. Yet O’Connor insisted it was an outgrowth of what happened that night in Laredo.\n“It’s natural to have feelings of disappointment when something doesn’t work out,” O’Connor said. “That disappointment lasted a day. The Bracero fight allowed me to grow to a point where I could understand what I was feeling. Without it, I would have handled it differently and not as well.\n“I’ve learned to adapt and overcome. If this was just about money I would have quit a long time ago. The intrinsic value in boxing for me comes from the fight. That’s my fix.\n“I hope it pays off financially someday too but I’m not looking to be the next Floyd Mayweather. I would like to be able to pay my kid’s school lunch bill for the year, though.”\nAt that The Realist shrugs and goes off about his business knowing, inside the ring at least, the truth will set you free.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T09:50:03.188+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
