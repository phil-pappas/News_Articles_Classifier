Nigeria, the defending champion, dominated most of the game and finished with a 19-4 shot advantage.\nNigeria came out nervously but soon settled into the game after winning a pair of corner kicks within the first five minutes. Neither led to a clear-cut opportunity, but forward Victor Osimhen did get behind the U.S. defense in the 10th minute through the run of play before skewing a shot wide off the outside of his foot.\nU.S. playmaker and Borussia Dortmund midfielder Christian Pulišić created two chances for the U.S. not long after, though Nigerian goalkeeper Akpan Udoh cut out one cross before Haji Wright put another from close range over the bar. Pulišić was consistently the brightest American player at both ends, driving toward the endline in attack and winning multiple challenges in defense.\nPlanet Futbol Podcast: U.S. Soccer's awful week; TFC in playoffs; Klopp, Mourinho by SI Staff", "external_links": ["http://facebook.com/liviubird", "http://twitter.com/liviubird"], "published": "2015-10-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T06:22:17.936+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
