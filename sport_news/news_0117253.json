We went five games last season without winning and went on to have a fantastic season. I’m more than confident in the group that I have — it’s about bringing the players’ confidence back up and working with them closely.” \nMeanwhile, Tottenham Hotspur midfielder Nacer Chadli has been ruled out for six weeks after he sustained ankle ligament damage during Saturday’s goalless draw against Liverpool, the club said on its website. \nThe 26-year-old Belgium international was forced off the field at White Hart Lane after 11 minutes last Saturday having landed awkwardly inside the Tottenham penalty area. \nChadli joined the growing ranks of Tottenham players on the treatment table, including recent signing Son Heung-min, midfielder Ryan Mason and Nabil Bentaleb.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T19:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T23:43:24.380+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
