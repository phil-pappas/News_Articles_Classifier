Quebec? Or Seattle? \nWhen it comes to deciding where the next NHL franchise might be popping up, James Reimer could not care less if it was on the moon. The backup goalie for the Toronto Maple Leafs is just looking forward to the possibility of more jobs opening up. \n“I don’t think expansion can come quick enough for goalies,” Reimer said with a laugh. “I read a stat or heard a stat from a real reliable source in the game two years ago, I think, that said there’s 80 quality NHL goalies out there and only 60 spots. I’m sure that number’s only grown.” \nWhether it was Montreal’s Carey Price being named league MVP or Devan Dubnyk single-handedly leading the Minnesota Wild into the playoffs, last season belonged to the goaltenders. Everywhere you looked, something special was going on in the crease. \nIn Ottawa, Andrew Hammond inspired Senators fans to shower the ice with hamburgers. In New York, Cam Talbot was stealing playing time away from Henrik Lundqvist. And in Minnesota, a goaltender that had been traded three times and demoted to the minors twice in 13 months became a finalist for the Vezina Trophy. \nBy the end of the season, 20 goalies had a goals-against average that was less than 2.40. But not one skater had reached the 90-point mark. \nWhile you could still probably count the number of elite NHL goaltenders on one hand — Price, Lundqvist, Pekka Rinne and Tuukka Rask would be on most peoples’ lists — the number of legitimate starters is becoming much harder to quantify. \nLast season alone saw the goalie fraternity welcome several new members. And with new starting goaltenders in potentially six cities this year, there is less need for general managers to waste top dollars or top draft picks on a fickle position where supply clearly exceeds the demand. \n“You look at Vancouver ... (Ryan) Miller was always supposedly an elite goalie. And then (Eddie) Lack’s there and they play pretty much equal,” said Reimer. “You look at New York and Lundqvist is one of the best goaltenders in the league. But at the same time, Talbot had just as good stats, maybe if not better.” \nConsider this: Montreal’s Price was one of 18 goalies who is earning more than $5.2 million this season. But while Price had the best save percentage last season, the next three on that list earned less than US$4.2 million, including Dubnyk and Talbot, who each made less than US$1 million. \nIn other words, Price (US$6.5 milllion) provided the Canadiens with everything they paid for. But for most other teams, it might be wiser to sign several cheap options and use the leftover money to address the defence or other roster needs. \nThat is the approach the Anaheim Ducks are taking, with Frederik Andersen, Anton Khudobin and John Gibson combining to earn less than US$4.2 million. The money they saved went to acquiring defenceman Kevin Bieksa (US$4.6 million) and forward Carl Hagelin (US$4 million) in trades. \nMinnesota, meanwhile, re-signed Dubynk to a six-year contract worth US$26 million without addressing an offence that finished 12th in goals per game. \n“I think there are a lot of good goalies even outside of the goalies people talk about,” said Boston Bruins goalie Tuukka Rask. “Obviously, nobody other than the players in the league knew about Talbot, Dubnyk and these guys before they got there. But they’re good goalies and they just need that one chance and if they make the most of that chance, these things happen.” \nIndeed, opportunity is the most difficult hurdle for a goaltender trying to break into the NHL. There are only 60 jobs and half of those require you to sit at the end of a bench with a baseball hat on. It often takes an injury or poor play by the starting goaltender for someone to get a chance. \nOttawa’s Hammond was the No. 3 goalie on the depth chart playing in relative obscurity in the minors when Craig Anderson and Robin Lehner both went down with injuries. During a 23-game stretch, the undrafted goaltender went 20-1-2 to help the Senators clinch a playoff spot. \nIn New York, Talbot went 17-4-3 while Lundqvist was injured and is now the starting goalie for the Edmonton Oilers. Martin Jones, who had been Jonathan Quick’s backup in Los Angeles, is now the No. 1 goalie in San Jose. \n“Goalies, like the players, are just so prepared now with the way they train,” said Lundqvist. “The competition level is extremely high. There’s a lot of good goaltending coaches teaching good technique. It’s good for the quality of the league.” \nThey might not all be considered elite goalies. But, as Reimer said, they are good enough to win games. \n“I think there’s only a handful of elite goaltenders,” said Reimer, “but there’s maybe 30 guys who 10 years ago would have been considered elite.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T05:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T08:04:56.035+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
