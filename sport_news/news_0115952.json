Steuber is the third-leading tackler for the Ichabods with 43. By Rick Peterson Jr. richard.peterson@cjonline.com \nWith just a handful of games left in his college career, Washburn senior linebacker Alec Steuber is feeling a sense of urgency to end things on a strong note. \nThat mentality might explain why Steuber has been a turnover magnet for the Ichabods the last two games. \n“I guess I’m trying be more aggressive because I only have a few more games left to play football, a sport that I love,” Steuber said. “I’m going all-out.” \nThe Hayden product has created four turnovers over Washburn’s last two games. Steuber snagged two interceptions against Fort Hays State before forcing two fumbles this past week against Central Missouri. \n“I’m looking and thinking ahead to the future a little bit,” Steuber said. “I’m like, ‘Dude, you’re not going to be on this field and you’re not going to be playing this game that you love so much.’ I’m just giving all I can for the next couple months.” \nSteuber, who ranks third on the team in tackles with 43, said he’s taking on more of a leadership role for the Ichabods, who enter Saturday’s 2 p.m. game at Missouri Western with a 3-3 record. \n“In the beginning of the season, I was just trying to lead by my play on the field,” Steuber said. “But I think now I’m definitely more verbal, because as a senior, it’s kind of your season. \n“The last couple of games haven’t gone quite like we’ve wanted, so I’m trying to be more verbal.” \nSteuber is part of a deep inside linebacker corps that includes Cody Heiman, Austin Tillman, Zack Weekley and Derrick McGreevy. \nSteuber said the competitive nature of the linebackers bring out the best in each other. \n“We’re all pretty much best friends,” he said. “We’ll talk a little trash and make it competitive, but in the end it’s all in good sport.” \nSteuber, 5-foot-11, 215 pounds, came into the program as a fullback, which explains his knack for the finding the ball, Washburn coach Craig Schurig said. \n“He plays awfully hard,” Schurig said. “He’s got a really good athletic sense. He’s got good ball skills, and he utilizes that on defense. \n“He forced two really good turnovers (against Missouri Western), and it was frustrating because when you make a great play like that, you need to capitalize on it, and we weren’t able to. He made two exceptional plays punching the ball out; that was really heads-up.” \nSteuber said the Ichabod defense is looking to get off to a faster start on Saturday against the Griffons, who enter with a 4-2 record. \n“(Slow starts) killed us the last couple games,” Steuber said. “It’s crucial that we get out to a fast start and hold them from the get-go, instead of waiting until the second half.” \nWU RECEIVER HART OUT INDEFINITELY AFTER ARREST — Washburn receiver Jordan Hart was arrested early Monday morning and booked into the Shawnee County Jail in connection with several offenses, including disorderly conduct, resisting arrest, criminal threats and possession of opiate/opium/narcotic drug and/or stimulant. \nSchurig said Wednesday that Hart “is out indefinitely.” \nHart, a senior from McPherson, has 17 receptions for 294 yards and two touchdowns this season. \nRick Jr. Peterson can be reached at (785) 295-1290 or rick.peterson.jr@cjonline.com .Follow Rick Jr. on Twitter @RickiePeterson .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T02:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T10:40:30.375+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
