Prosper Harrison Addo, Esq. - Chairman2. W.O.1 J.W. Amoo - Member3. Godsway Glah - MemberRaphael Tottimeh - GFA ProsecutorTHE CHARGESamartex FC was charged with two counts of misconduct with regards to the GN Bank Division One League match between Samartex FC and Elmina Sharks FC played at Samreboi. \nOn the first count, it was alleged that officials of Samartex FC prevented the GFA camera man from filming the match by threatening him with injury and death should he attempt to cover the match in violation of the Articles 35(1)(c) of the GFA General Regulations. \nOn the second count, it was alleged that around the 86th minute of the match, Samartex FC failed to control the club's supporters when one of them invaded the field of play without permission and prevented a player from taking a ball which had gone out of play in an attempt to waste playing time contrary to Article 58 of the Disciplinary Code and Articles 35(1)(a), 35(4) and 35(7)(d) of the General Regulations. \nDEFENCESamartex FC pleaded not guilty to the first charge but partially admitted the second charge in its Statement of Defence. \nPROCEEDINGS AND FINDINGSThe Committee considered the depositions in the Charge Sheet, the written Statement of Defence and the reports of the match officials of the said match. \nThe Disciplinary Committee will give the club the benefit of the doubt on the first charge after considering the evidence. However, on the second count, Samartex FC stated that “we duly condemn the behaviour of this fan who perhaps was carried away by the excitement….”. The Committee is satisfied with the evidence before it that the conduct of the supporter amounts to misconduct and a breach of the GFA Regulations. The Committee urges all clubs to continue to educate the supporters. \nDECISIONThat the Committee, having satisfied itself that the evidence adduced before it supports the charge of misconduct on the second two, hereby imposes a fine of Three Hundred Ghana Cedis (GH¢300.00) on Samartex FC to be paid to the GFA within fourteen (14) days upon receipt of this Ruling, failing which Samartex FC shall automatically forfeit all subsequent matches after the said deadline in accordance with Article 15(b) of the GFA Disciplinary Code and Article 39(8)(b), 39(8)(d) and 39(8)(f) of the First Amendment to the GFA General Regulations.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T21:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T03:28:55.124+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
