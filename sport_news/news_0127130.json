ROMERO Associated Press   02, 2015 - 2:37 amLast Updated: October 02, 2015 - 2:37 am   \nPeople: \nCalifornia (1459) \n\nPHOENIX â€” Every game in the series was close. And in every one, the Colorado Rockies came up short. \nPhil Gosselin hit an inside-the-park homer with two outs in the seventh inning and the Arizona Diamondbacks went on to rally four runs, beating the Rockies 8-6 Thursday night for a three-game sweep. \nThe Rockies arrived in Arizona with a three-game winning streak. They lost the first two games to the Diamondbacks by one and two runs. \n\"You've got to find a way to win those games. Whether it's on the offensive side or on the mound or defensively,\" Rockies manager Walt Weiss said. \"They were three tough games and that is usually the case when we play these guys.\" \nGosselin's home run sparked the Diamondbacks off Rockies reliever Justin Miller. Replays appeared to show the ball clearing the yellow line on top of the left-field wall and then bouncing back on the field. \nSecond base umpire Lance Barrett did not indicate a home run and by the time left fielder Rafael Ynoa retrieved the ball and threw it back toward the infield, a hustling Gosselin was headed for home. \nPaul Goldschmidt had an infield single and rookie Socrates Brito singled to left before Welington Castillo hit a two-run double off Miller (3-3). Castillo then scored on two wild pitches by Boone Logan. \nMiller was charged with four runs while getting just two outs. \n\"Miller has been lights out for us. He has been outstanding,\" Weiss said. \"Those are the first runs he's given up in a while. It was a tough night for him, but he has been really good.\" \nEnrique Burgos (2-2) got the win in relief despite allowing a run on two hits with two wild pitches in the seventh. Silvino Bracho pitched a scoreless ninth for his first major league save. \nThe Rockies got two doubles and two RBIs from Ynoa and two hits and two runs from Kyle Parker. \nThe Rockies consistently hit the ball hard off Diamondbacks starter Patrick Corbin, with D.J. LeMahieu lining a single off Gosselin's glove at second base to drive in Jose Reyes in the first inning. \nThe Diamondbacks took a 2-1 lead with two runs in their half of the first off starter David Hale, who pitched five innings. A.J. Pollock came in on a sacrifice fly by Goldschmidt, his 409th career RBI. That passed Chris Young's 408 for fourth place on the club's all-time list. \nGosselin scored on Castillo's ground out before the inning was over. \n\"For the offseason I know what I've got to work on,\" Hale said. \"I need to continue to work on the mechanical things that have changed. I'm happy with the way they are now.\" \nColorado chased Corbin after back-to-back doubles for Parker and Ynoa made the score 5-4 in the sixth. Corbin was charged with five runs on 10 hits with five strikeouts and a walk in 5 1-3 innings. \nTom Murphy doubled in Nolan Arenado with two outs in the seventh to give the Rockies a 6-4 lead. \nTHIRD IS THE WORD \nThe Diamondbacks clinched third place in the NL West behind the division-winning Los Angeles Dodgers and runner-up San Francisco Giants. Arizona is 78-81 with three games to play and the fourth-place San Diego Padres are 74-85 with three games remaining. The Rockies will finish fifth. \nSEE YOU IN APRIL \nArizona and Colorado concluded their 2015 season series Thursday and open up the 2016 regular season in Phoenix with a three-game series April 4-6. \nUP NEXT \nRockies: RHP Kyle Kendrick (6-13) makes his final start of the season for the Rockies at San Francisco. He has allowed six earned runs in each of his last two starts, both in Denver. He's 4-7 with a 5.55 ERA on the road this season. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T09:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T09:45:24.288+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
