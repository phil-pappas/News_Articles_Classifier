Pastore Ridgewood middle hitter Amy Mullen (5) leaps to block an attempted spike by Northern Highlands’ Anya Riccitelli (36) in a Big North Freedom girls volleyball match earlier this season. \nAnyone who dwells on Ridgewood High School’s volleyball record this season is not seeing the entire picture. \nThe girls are on the rise at just the right time, performing spectacularly in a pressurized situation. The goal was to reach the .500 mark in order to qualify for the state tournament, and they polished off a trio of talented teams on the way to reaching a mark of 9-8.

The Lions were the No. 15 seed, so Ridgewood had to go on the road as the No. 18 seed to spring the upset in order to earn Saturday’s Round of 16 match-up with No. 2 Immaculate Heart. \nIt was all or nothing next, as the Maroons hurriedly sought out an independent opponent to insert into the schedule and did not choose a weakling. They played Bloomfield, which held a 16-1 record entering the match, and beat the Bengals, 25-19, 25-21, to even their record. \n\"They’re a Group 4 school, and that could do us well in the power point standings [for state selection],\" Knott said on Tuesday, hours before his team completed the clutch run by dispatching Hackensack, 24-26, 25-17, 25-13. \nBig-time schedule \nThe meager percentage of wins across the season can easily be explained. Ridgewood lost twice each to Big North Freedom rivals Paramus, Ramapo and Northern Highlands, and once each to the two Northern Valley schools, Old Tappan and Demarest. \n\"All those teams are highly regarded,\" Knott noted. Each is ranked in The Record Top 20, and NV/Old Tappan is No. 1 in both the poll and the Bergen County seedings. Ridgewood, despite its record and because of its determined play, was at No. 19 in the latest rankings. \nKnott’s early-season aim was to field a team whose members could play a variety of spots, and he has succeeded. He also has unusual depth at key areas of the court, plus the versatility he sought. \nIt begins with three setters in a sport where having two good options at the position is a luxury. They are senior co-captain Christina d’Ecclesiis, senior Megan Collier and sophomore Emily Rea. \n\"Christina is in her second year starting, and she’s done some terrific things,\" Knott said of the girl who assisted 19 times Tuesday. \"She plays the whole court and has a great ability to reach anything. Just about every match, my assistant coach and I look at each other and say, ‘Did she just get that?’ Volleyball is a game of momentum, and she gives us a chance to either start momentum or continue it. \n\"Megan is a bit taller and a quality setter who provides a steadying influence for the team. A lot of teams don’t have a good setter in the front row like Megan,\" Knott continued. \n\"And Emily is a transfer from IHA with strong serving skills, good hands for setting,\" he added. \"She knows the game well, and she has played for a few good club programs. She’s also a good blocker in the front row.\" \nAt the net \nSenior co-captain Brittany Gilbert is the primary hitter who also plays well under control, which is imperative, Knott said. Instead of powering every hit, she has varied the speeds of her returns. \n\"Brittany needed to reduce her hitting errors and she’s made huge strides,\" the coach said. \"She’s become a dynamic weapon for us. We were 2-5 at one time and her adjustment helped us to get to [9-8].\" \nGilbert had 11 kills in the Leonia win and 14 against Hackensack. \nJunior Shea Darienzo returned for her second year as libero and is a bit of a dynamo, the coach said. \"Shea’s passing has continued to improve, and she has a fire in her. When things aren’t going well, she shows it and that fires up the team.\" \nDarienzo keyed the Hackensack win with eight digs. \nFive-foot-10 junior middle hitter Amy Mullen caught Knott’s eye as a JV player last year. © 2015 North Jersey Media Group Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T07:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T15:59:59.086+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
