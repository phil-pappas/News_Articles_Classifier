Before Monday afternoon's game against the Jets, Islanders coach Jack Capuano threatened changes to his power play unit if he didn't see more production.\nApparently, his players heard the message loud and clear.\nIn a sloppy contest that featured eight penalties from the two sides in the first two periods alone, the Isles scored two power play goals en route to a 4-2 victory over Winnepeg before 11,183 at Barclays Center - New York's first victory of the young 2015-16 season.\nThe Islanders faced off twice with the Blackhawks to open year - both losses - which was likely a driving force behind the squad going 0-for-4 on power plays in the home-and-home set. Capuano termed Chicago the best penalty-killing team in the league in 2014, but he didn't use that as an excuse.\nHe wanted results.\nAndrew Theodorakis/ for New York Daily News John Tavares gets his name on the scoreboard to seal the Islanders victory. Through most of the opening period Monday, though, the struggles continued. The referees awarded the Islanders an extra man three times in the first 17 minutes of play, but each time New York failed to capitalize despite putting pressure on Winnipeg goaltender Ondrej Pavelec.\nThen, finally, on the fourth power of the period, the Islanders broke through.\nThe call was interference on Jets defenseman Mark Stuart, and with less than 20 seconds remaining, Kyle Okposo drove a slap shot the scooted wide of the net. It caromed of the boards and slid to the stick of Ryan Strome, who buried the rebound to give the Isles a 1-0 lead heading into the first intermission.\nBrock Nelson extended the lead to 2-0 early in the second period with an even-strength goal. John Tavares collected a blocked shot in his own zone and started on a 3-on-1 break the other way. He fed Nelson as he crossed the blue line, and Nelson carried toward the goal before slotting a wrist shot.\nAndrew Theodorakis/ for New York Daily News Islanders coach Jack Capuano (c.) finally sees results from his power play unit. Four minutes later, the Islanders added another power play goal on their fifth opportunity to make it 3-0. New York went on a 4-on-3 after a Dustin Byfuglien roughing penalty. This time, Tavares put away a rebound for his second goal of the season.\nMark Scheifele added a goal for Winnipeg before the close of the second period to pull the Jets within two goals, and the Islanders' lead was cut to one when a Byfuglien slap shot found the back of the net with less more than eight minutes remaining in regulation.\nBut goaltender Thomas Greiss, filling in for the injured Jaroslav Halak (upper body) for the second time this season, kept the Jets out of the goal down the stretch before Josh Bailey scored on an open net to polish off the victory.\nRelated Stories Islanders drop second straight to Blackhawks, 4-1 Islanders open season with 3-2 OT loss to Blackhawks Tags: jack capuano , jets", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T00:20:01.852+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
