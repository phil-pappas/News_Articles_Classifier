Zeeland West at Unity Christian Kickoff >> 7 p.m. tonight at Hudsonville High Records >> Zeeland West 8-0, Unity Christian 6-2 Scouting report >> A win would give the Dux their third undefeated regular season in five seasons and would clinch an outright OK Green title. Unity Christian, along with Byron Center, has only one conference loss and would like to get in on a share of the conference title, but the Dux have a 10-2 all-time record against UC and hasn’t lost to the Crusaders since 2009. Muskegon Reeths-Puffer at Zeeland East Kickoff >> 7 p.m. tonight at Zeeland Stadium Records >> Zeeland East 5-3, Reeths-Puffer 3-5 Scouting report >> With a win tonight, the Chix will punch their ticket to the playoffs after missing the postseason last year after a run of four-straight appearances prior to that. Reeths-Puffer comes in on a three-game losing streak and you know the Rockets would love to play spoiler, especially against a Chix team they lost 30-34 to last season but beat 46-26 in 2013. Fennville at Saugatuck Kickoff >> 7 p.m. tonight at Saugatuck Records >> Saugatuck 8-0, Fennville 3-5 Scouting report >> The Indians have locked up a playoff berth and the SAC Valley title, but they’ll be in the hunt for their first undefeated regular season since 2011 tonight. Fennville has battled through a slew of injuries this season, but the Blackhawks have kept fighting up until the end. That was evident last week with a 30-25 victory over Marcellus to snap a five-game losing streak. But in the end, Fennville hasn’t beat Saugatuck since 2010 and the Indians will obviously want to keep their positive momentum going into the postseason against an under-manned Fennville team. Holland Christian at Hamilton Kickoff >> 7 p.m. tonight at Hamilton Records >> Holland Christian 3-5, Hamilton 1-7 Scouting report >> Two teams that started the season with some promise will look to end the regular season on a positive note. The Maroons have lost their last three games to fall out of the playoff picture, but they held an early 7-0 lead over Zeeland West last week and controlled much of the first half before the Dux pulled away with 42 unanswered points. Hamilton has lost seven in a row but has played the Maroons tough the last few seasons, losing by four points or less in two of their last three matchups. Byron Center at Holland Kickoff >> 7 p.m. tonight at Hope College’s Ray & Sue Smith Stadium Records >> Holland 2-6, Byron Center 6-2 Scouting report >> The Dutch showed some life with a 39-28 victory over Hamilton in Week 7, but suffered a letdown with a 55-7 lopsided loss to Unity Christian last week. Like Unity Christian, Byron Center can get a share of the OK Green title if they win and the Crusaders beat the Dux, so the Bulldogs will be motivated despite already having a playoff berth locked up. Page 2 of 3 - West Ottawa at Grand Haven Kickoff >> 7 p.m. tonight at Grand Haven Records >> West Ottawa 2-6, Grand Haven 2-6 Scouting report >> With both teams sporting 2-6 records coming into the finale, this one is about establishing some momentum going into next season. The Panthers have hung around with some tough teams, including a stellar performance by their defense last week despite losing 27-0 to Rockford. Neither team has had much success finding the end zone, with West Ottawa averaging 13.6 points per game and Grand Haven 14 points a game, so expect another defensive showdown in this one. Week 9 Picks Dan D'Addona West Ottawa 27, Grand Haven 14 . The Panthers have improved all season and will end the season on a high note. Byron Center 31, Holland 17. It has been a tough year for the Dutch, and unfortunately, they end their season against one of the top teams around. Holland Christian 42, Hamilton 20. The Maroons will top their rival in this OK Green showdown. Zeeland East 38, Muskegon Reeths-Puffer 14. The Chix will punch their ticket to the playoffs with the OK Black victory. Zeeland West 44, Unity Christian 17. The Dux will complete the perfect regular season and claim the outright OK Green title. Saugatuck 38, Fennville 21. The Indians will complete an unbeaten season with a rivalry win. Last week 6-1. Overall 46-13 Greg Buckner West Ottawa 17, Grand Haven 14. The Panthers end the season with some forward momentum. Byron Center 28, Holland 17. Holland looked like a defeated team last week and Byron Center still has hopes of a piece of an OK Green title. Holland Christian 42, Hamilton 14. The Maroons will look to end the season on a positive note. Zeeland East 31, Muskegon Reeths-Puffer 21. The Chix know the playoffs are on the line and they’ll get the job done. Zeeland West 40, Unity Christian 20. The Dux don’t want to share the Ok Green title, and they won’t. Saugatuck 42, Fennville 24. The Indians want the undefeated season and they’ll get it. Last week 7-0. Overall 46-13 Jason Barczy West Ottawa 20, Grand Haven 17. Both teams sport similar 2-6 records, however, Grand Haven has been riding a 5 game losing streak which will continue as the Panthers look to end the season with a bang. Byron Center 45, Holland 13. No real logic to this. The Dutch (2-6) aren't very good whereas the Bulldogs (6-2) are looking to improve their playoff standing. Page 3 of 3 - Holland Christian 31, Hamilton 21. The Maroons look towards next season with a win over the Hawkeyes. Zeeland East 28, Muskegon Reeths-Puffer 20. The Chix need this to secure a playoff spot, otherwise it's up to the committee. Zeeland West 56, Unity Christian 14. The Dux roll into the postseason undefeated for the third consecutive season. Saugatuck 42, Fennville 0. Can the Indians be slowed down? That question won't be answered this week. Last week 6-1.
