Things have gone wrong, and thus they’ve been predictably unsuccessful. \nDo two losses make this a lost season? Of course not, but they have proven Jacobs and president Cam Neely ’s words about the season being a growing process right. \nUnfortunately, these growing Bruins might have more ground to cover than expected. The adjustments were anticipated, but glaring lapses were not. This isn’t guys not knowing where a new linemate is in the offensive zone; it’s poor coverage and failures to get guys out of the front of the net. \nA Loui Eriksson goal was disallowed in the second period Saturday night because a Montreal defenseman (Alexei Emelin) had pushed Patrice Bergeron into Carey Price for a surprisingly upheld goaltender interference call. The Habs had no such worries on their goals, as Joe Morrow, forced to kill penalties due to Boston’s injuries on defense, and Kevan Miller left David Desharnais alone in front of Tuukka Rask on a Montreal power play early in the first period. \nAfter Morrow allowed an Andrei Markov pass past him to Desharnais on the doorstep, the unencumbered Montreal center was stopped by a strong kick save from Rask but had enough time alone to jam the rebound in. \nRask, who seems to be bending over backwards to not complain about the defense, was as diplomatic as he could be after the game. \n“It shouldn’t happen,” he said of the defensive lapses on the Desharnais goal. “I mean, a cross pass and another cross pass obviously shouldn’t happen, [but] it happened, and a couple rebounds too, but we figured it out after that. Too bad it happened though. We’re trying to be a tight group there.” \nThough the defensemen’s miscues have been most glaring so far, it isn’t just a defense problem. Claude Julien has tried two different fourth lines so far — Rinaldo-Kemppainen-Kelly and Rinaldo-Kelly-Talbot — and neither of them have been particularly good. \nRyan Spooner’s line hasn’t been any better. The trio of Spooner with Jimmy Hayes and Brett Connolly were put together at the start of training camp, but it appears they still need time to jell in all three zones. The line has not had the puck (Spooner has a minus-10 Corsi through two games) and has done little to give Julien confidence that it can hold up in its own zone. \nShould the Bruins continue to lose, Julien will face the hard task of figuring out whether these are growing pains or indications that the lineup needs tweaking. Last season, Julien was far more willing to alter his lineup from game-to-game than in seasons past, but then again last season was the first in a while that his team wasn’t very good. \nIn the meantime, Boston’s players are trying to remain positive. That might get more difficult over time if the B’s don’t come out the other end of this. \n“It’s tough because we’re trying to work through something right now,” Torey Krug said. “Especially as a group, we’re being tested early, and [as] a new group we’re being tested early. I think on the bench we could always be better, more positive and make sure we manage the game a little bit better as players. There’s always room for improvement, but by no means are we down on ourselves and yelling on the bench or anything like that. I think we can always improve.” \nThen there’s the Brad Marchand situation. The veteran left wing left during the third period of Saturday’s loss after essentially crashing into Dale Weise’s elbow and leaving the ice slowly. Marchand had one of the best plays of the night for Boston earlier in the game, knocking the puck away from P.K. Subban and then stealing it from Alexander Galchenyuk to set up a shorthanded bid in which he hit the crossbar. Yet his exit from the game and the possibility that an already banged-up group could lose another key player overshadowed any of the positives. \nThe 2015-16 Bruins were expected to be a decent team with a high likelihood of starting slow. Even if nobody thought the B’s would fare particularly well early, it doesn’t make watching uncharacteristically poor performances any easier.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T07:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T08:09:49.940+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
