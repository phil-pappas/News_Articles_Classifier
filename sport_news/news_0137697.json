Shower or two. Sport Cairns Taipans written off by bookies ahead of NBL opener v Illawarra tonight in the Far North by: What are these? FIRED UP: After coming so close to the championship this year, the fire is still burning for the Cairns Taipans. (L-R) Markel Starks, Mark Worthington, Cameron Tragardh, Torrey Craig and Cameron Gliddon are ready for the 2015/16 season. PICTURE: BRENDAN RADKE Source: News Corp Australia \nTHE Taipans have again been written off by the bookies ahead of their NBL season opener tonight, the Cairns club fifth favourite to win the championship despite making the final last season and winning all three games at the preseason Blitz. \nNever a team to attract much hype from south of the border, the Taipans say they enjoy the underdog tag even if they don’t deserve it after going 21-7 in a club-best season that took them to the grand final series. \nCairns are fifth on the list with most betting agencies at about $6.50 behind metropolitan clubs Sydney ($5) and Melbourne ($6), who both missed the final four last season. \nNew Zealand and Perth are the two favourites while Adelaide and Townsville are tipped to fight for the spoon. \nLast season Cairns were the first regional side to finish on top of the NBL ladder since 1984 and not since 1990 have the minor premiers missed the playoffs in the next season. \nCairns have three new faces in their squad but present as another strong force, dual Olympian Mark Worthington adding staunch and import point guard Markel Starks winning MVP honours in the preseason tournament. \nAnd while they start favourites in tonight’s home opener against Illawarra — in what is a battle between last season’s first and last-placed sides — all that hasn’t been enough to win the trust of the bookmakers. \n“It doesn't surprise me but personally I love the fact we fly under the radar,” Taipan swingman Stephen Weigh said. \n“Even last season got as far as the semis and still people out there were writing us off. \n“I like that; don’t create any hype around ourselves and just go about our business.” \nTaipans coach Aaron Fearne was typically dismissive of the figures. \n“Whatever that all means,” he said. \n“The rest of the country doesn't care about what goes on up here; it’s all about the big city clubs.” \nCairns and Illawarra are the two most experienced teams in the league, Cairns with five players boasting 200 or more games in the NBL. \nWeigh said that, plus their ability to retain the likes of exhilarating import Torrey Craig, captain Cameron Gliddon, inspirational forward Alex Loughton and sixth man of the year Cameron Tragardh held them in good stead. \nIllawarra have reacted to their wooden spoon last season, in which they won just six games, by changing coaches and adding pivotal trio Kirk Penney, Kevin Lisch and AJ Ogilvy. \n“In the last five years in the NBL teams have looked good on paper but not always put it together,” Weigh said. \n“I hold more stead on teams retaining core players and coaches and that's one thing we’ve done a great job of this season. \n“We know everyone’s tendencies and what to expect from the guy next to us from one through 10 and the coaches — that’s a huge strength.” \nCairns are likely to go in without Tragardh (calf) in their sole injury concern, while the Hawks have drafted in former Sydney King Jarrad Weeks to cover for guard Rhys Martin (knee).", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T06:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T09:18:45.836+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
