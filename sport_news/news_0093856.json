The Utes and Cardinal's performance were enough to stay atop their divisions. More exciting games occurred during the weekend. Here are takeaways from each matchup. \nArizona 38, Colorado 31 \nIt's been a long time coming since the Buffaloes won a conference matchup. It looked like the tradition was near an end when they were up 24-17 at half. However, the Wildcats scored three touchdowns in the last quarter to seal the win. \nArizona running back Jared Baker filled in for an injured Nick Wilson and had a career night. He ran for 207 yards on 23 carries with two touchdowns, including one for 79 yards. \nConference implications: Arizona is in a quarterback conundrum. Anu Solomon and Jerrard Randall both played — Solomon returned to the field after Randall suffered an injury. The defense was also hesitant, giving up crucial plays that could've lost the game. Good news: the Wildcats improved their win column, but there are still issues that need to be resolved. \nOnce again, the Buffs were almost good enough. They shut out the Wildcats in the second and third quarters — making them punt six times and sacked Solomon four times. Their next competition is their best hope for beating a conference rival. \nArizona hosts Washington State; Colorado travels to Oregon State. \nUtah, 34, Arizona State 18 \nGame recap: onents. Running back Devontae Booker never shows he's tired and he did so again Saturday night. After being held by Arizona State's rushing defense all night, he broke free at the end of the game and scored on a 62-yard run. \nUtah quarterback Travis Wilson went 26-of-36 for 297 yards with two touchdowns. \nConference implications: \nA win here would've given the Sun Devils great leverage at the South title. Instead, they are left with a grueling task to perform perfect play to stay in the division talks. \nUtah travels to USC; Arizona State enters its bye week and hosts Oregon Oct. 29. \nOregon 26, Washington 20 \nWith Vernon Adams Jr. back at quarterback, the Ducks hoped things would come together. They sort of did. Oregon finished with an improvement to its record, but the win was \"ugly\" as one Oregon player called it. Washington cut a 17-point deficit to just six late in the fourth, but the Ducks came up with an interception to mark the game in their favor. \nIn his first game of the season, Oregon receiver Darren Carrington had five receptions for 125 yards and two scores. \nConference implications: The Ducks are definitely a better team with Adams holding the reins. This was their 12th-consecutive time defeating the Huskies, and it keeps them in the North division title conversation. \nWashington's defense looked good, keeping running back Royce Freeman &ford. \nOregon enters its bye week and travels to Arizona State Oct. 29; Washington travels to Stanford. \nWashington State 52, Oregon State 31 \nGame recap: With a first half rally, Washington State was able to pull off a victory. Quarterback Luke Falk led the team to 45 points before halftime. The determined Beavers held the Cougars' offense scoreless in the latter half the only Washington State score came from an 84-yard pick six. Too many early mistakes cost Oregon State on its road to its first Pac-12 win of the season. \nFalk's first half consisted of six touchdowns. He completed 28-of-33 passes for 323 yards in the half. \nConference implications: \nIt's very clear Oregon State is in a rebuilding season. While it may be a long year for this young team, the experience brings a bright future. \nWashington State travels to Arizona; Oregon State hosts Colorado. \nStanford 56, UCLA 35 \nStanford's offense was exquisite against a UCLA team that was once considered a South Division title contender. Once up just 14-10, the Cardinal scored 21 unanswered second quarter points. The largest lead was 56-20, but the Bruins added a couple late touchdowns to boost their score. \nKey stat: Stanford running back Christian McCaffrey ran for a school-record 243 yards and four touchdowns. He also ended the night with 369 all-purpose yards the most of any FBS player in a game this year. \nConference implications: The Cardinal proved they're championship worthy with plays such as a 96-yard kickoff return by McCaffrey and a 41-yard touchd \nAny hopes for UCLA's playoff contention is dwindling away. This loss is the second consecutive conference loss for the Bruins, who shot themselves in the foot with nine offensive penalties and missed tackles. Injuries haven't helped the cause either, but the team is sinking into the depths of hibernation. \nStanford hosts Washington; UCLA hosts California. \nNotre Dame 41, USC 31 \nA rally by the Fighting Irish in the fourth quarter sent the Trojans home with a loss. Tied at 24 at the half, USC pulled ahead to take a seven-point lead mid-third quarter. But the Fighting Irish fought their way back with 17 unanswered points. \nUSC's offense totaled 590 total yards. \nConference implications: A lot more went on with the Trojans than preparing for this game. Despite all the commotion, USC nearly won against a longtime rival. The offense looks great, led by quarterback Cody Kessler, who threw for two touchdowns and ran for another score. Kessler Co. now have to compete against Utah for a chance to regain leverage in the Pac-12 South.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T00:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T05:04:38.340+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
