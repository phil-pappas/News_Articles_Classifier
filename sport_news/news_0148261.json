(Photo: Duane Rankin/Advertiser) \nTUSCALOOSA -- Shaun Hamilton has turned Alabama's inside linebacker duo into a trio. \nReggie Ragland leads the team in tackles, Reuben Foster is an emerging star, but Hamilton is becoming a key cog for the Crimson Tide this season. The former G.W. Carver High star posted five tackles in last Saturday's 38-10 win at Georgia. \n\"It's been really good,\" Hamilton said. \"Just seeing the field and doing whatever I can to help the team win. It's been great. I'm all about winning.\" Alabama linebacker Shaun Hamilton has 16 total tackles this season. Duane Rankin/Montgomery Advertiser \nHamilton has 16 total tackles in five games with a career-high six coming in the season opener against Wisconsin. Last season, Hamilton only made three total tackles in 14 games as he played primarily on special teams. \nHamilton plays more in Alabama's base defense. The Tide have played more nickel based on facing more spread teams, but when given an opportunity, the 6-foot, 229-pound linebacker is making an impact. \n\"I feel like I bring physicality,\" Hamilton said. \"Strike blockers, get off blocks and make tackles.\" Read or Share this story: http://on.mgmadv.com/1Rrml2V Most Popular", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T23:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T03:31:58.238+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
