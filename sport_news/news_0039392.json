Mets take 1-0 lead over LA Dodgers in NLDS UPDATED 12:48 AM CDT Oct 10, 2015 Photos Stephen Dunn/Getty Images \nSecond baseman Daniel Murphy homered and Jacob deGrom struck out a career-high 13, sparking the New York Mets to a 3-1 victory over the Los Angeles Dodger in Game 1 of their National League Division Series before a sellout crowd of 54,428 at Dodger Stadium on Friday night. Mariners part with manager McClendon \nDeGrom threw five-hit ball with a walk (intentional) in seven innings. His 13 strikeouts tied Tom Seaver's franchise mark, which the Hall of Famer set in Game 1 of the 1973 National League Championship Series against the Cincinnati Reds. \nDeGrom retired the final 11 batters he faced. He and Dodgers starter Clayton Kershaw, who struck out 11, became the first two opposing pitchers to strike out at least 10 hitters in a game. \nMets closer Jeurys Familia worked a perfect 1 1/3 innings for the save. \nWith the win, the Mets took a 1-0 lead in the best-of-five series. Game 2 is Saturday at Dodger Stadium. \nKershaw lost his fifth straight playoff game. Kershaw (0-1), who is 1-6 in the postseason, was charged with three runs on four hits with four walks in 6 2/3 innings. Kershaw also lost to the Mets for the first time in 10 career starts. \nMurphy gave the Mets an early lead, driving a 2-0 Kershaw fastball into the visitor's bullpen in right for a solo blast to open the fourth inning. \nWith two outs in the eighth and the bases loaded, third baseman David Wright laced a two-run single up the middle off reliever Pedro Baez to make it 3-0. \nThe Dodgers scored a run on first baseman Adrian Gonzalez's RBI single to left, scoring second baseman Howie Kendrick, who reached on a double, to slice the lead to two runs with two outs in the eighth. However, Familia induced third baseman Justin Turner to line out to first to limit the damage. \nDodgers catcher A.J. Ellis, who went 1-for-3, had a fourth-inning single to extend his postseason hitting streak to a franchise record-tying 11 games. Ellis tied left fielder Carl Crawford's mark, set in 2014.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T08:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T10:23:24.528+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
