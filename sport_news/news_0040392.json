Albany's Lewis given longer deal 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Albany native Dion Lewis has taken off in his first season with the New England Patriots . Coach Bill Belichick ensured the shifty running back will be around for several more years.\nThe Patriots signed Lewis to a contract extension through the 2017 season, worth potentially $5 million. The contract calls for a $2.6 million base, with nearly $2 million more in incentive potential. Lewis also received a $600,000 signing bonus.\nESPN first reported the news.\nLewis signed a futures contract last year after missing the past two seasons. He suffered a fractured fibula in August of 2013, wiping out one season. Lewis was then cut by several teams in 2014 and sat out all year.\nMore Information\nIn three games for the unbeaten Patriots this season, Lewis has rushed for 146 yards on 30 carries with two touchdowns and caught 15 passes for 179 yards.\nColts 27, Texans 20: Andre Johnson had two touchdown catches to help Indianapolis beat Houston. Johnson, who spent his first 12 NFL seasons in Houston before he was released in March, made it 27-17 with a two-yard touchdown reception from Matt Hasselbeck . Texans QB Brian Hoyer was intercepted by Mike Adams with less than 2 minutes left.", "external_links": ["http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/33/05/8761686/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/33/05/8761686/3/920x920.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-09T07:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T09:00:05.958+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
