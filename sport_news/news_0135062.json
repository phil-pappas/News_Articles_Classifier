After a Saturday full of action and overreaction, we're here to help you figure out what's hot, what's not and what's true. Here are five story lines to know (and, in some cases, debunk): \nThis week's Snap Judgments: 1. Michigan could definitely beat Michigan State next week ... or perhaps Ohio State at the end of the season \nIt's pretty incredible what coaching can do. Jim Harbaugh took essentially the same roster that went 5-7 a year ago and is off to an impressive 5-1 start , with the team's lone loss coming at Utah. He gained a healthy Jabrill Peppers, and a transfer quarterback in Jake Rudock, and suddenly Michigan's got a stifling defense (currently on a three-game shutout streak) and a consistent, balanced offensive attack. \nThe Spartans have looked shaky in recent weeks, eking out wins against Big Ten bottom-dwellers Purdue and Rutgers. Michigan has the momentum, the talent and the confidence it needs entering this rivalry game. We don't even think it would be that big of a surprise if the Wolverines win at this point. Like, at all. Follow the road to the 2015 College Football Playoff at The Football Four , our home to rate and debate the nation's best. 2. Florida could very well win the SEC East \nThe Gators remind us a lot of the Wolverines; both have shown major improvement in their new coaches' first year. Under Jim McElwain, Florida's offense is formidable and consistent. Its defense remains solid. And the Gators have a two-game lead (!) in the SEC East. This team is no fluke, and it will have a chance to prove that against one of the big boys of the SEC West, LSU, next weekend. 3. We won't hear about Charlie Strong being on the hot seat any more this season \nWe aren't even sure he ever actually came close to being on the proverbial hot seat. (Reminder: There's no permanent AD right now. Oh, and it's only Year 2, and Strong didn't inherit much, lest we forget.) But after an emotional 24-17 win against then-No. 9 Oklahoma — Strong's biggest win since getting to Austin — critics should and will quiet down. Hopefully, the teammate Twitter spats will stop, too. \nMarcus Johnson (center) and Texas relished every second of their victory celebration Saturday.

Trevone Boykin is making the Heisman a two-man race \nThis year's September Heisman winner, LSU's Leonard Fournette, certainly looks like he'll stick around. He won't run away with this competition, though, and his most formidable challenger could be TCU's star quarterback Trevone Boykin. Boykin was 20-of-31 passing for 301 yards and two TDs (along with two interceptions) while rushing for 124 yards and two more scores against Kansas State on Saturday . He's the reason TCU remains undefeated and must-see TV. He'll gain some votes in this week's Heisman survey. ... Oh, and so will Florida State's dynamic running back Dalvin Cook, by the way. 5. A Utah team by any other name would smell sweeter \nLet's face the facts: If a brand-name program were 5-0, with wins against Michigan, Oregon and a top-25 Cal team ... it likely would be the No. 1 team in the nation. But the Utes are unique and non-traditional, and they remain in the top 10 — not top one — despite respect building for what they've done. Utah forced six Cal turnovers on Saturday on its way to winning 30-24 in the battle of unbeaten Pac-12 teams and further looking like the favorite to win the league this season. Utah's defense remains stringent, and running back Devontae Booker remains sensational. So why aren't more people talking about this team as perhaps the nation's best? \nHOW THE TOP 25 FARED IN WEEK 6", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T09:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T17:10:25.008+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
