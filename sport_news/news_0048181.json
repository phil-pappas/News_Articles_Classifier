It was a game in which the oft-criticized quarterback Josh McCown -- a journeyman -- set a franchise record with 457 yards passing . McCown finished 36-of-51 with two touchdowns, bringing the team back from a 21-9 third-quarter deficit. ( Go here to listen to a podcast from Cleveland.com's Dan Labbe and The Plain Dealer's Dennis Manoloff.)\n\"All I know is we won the game,'' McCown said. ( Go here to read an analysis of McCown's effort from Manoloff.) \"That's cool stuff and when you're done playing, that's cool things that you can look back on and be proud of, but for me, there's other things that I want to be the first Browns quarterback to do and that involves stuff with our team, so that's where my mindset will be.''\nJosh McCown on the Browns OT win over the Ravens Cleveland Browns quarterback Josh McCown talks about how important the overtime victory over the Baltimore Ravens at M&T Bank Stadium was to the team. Sunday, Oct 11, 2015. Dave Andersen, Northeast Ohio Media Group\nWhat do Browns writers think about the team's performance? We'll get to that in a bit. Right now it's more interesting to see what reporters covering the 1-4 Ravens have to say ... and it's not good. Mike Preston of the Baltimore Sun says the loss to Cleveland basically negates all hope for this season :\nThere were three certain things in life: death, taxes and the Ravens beating the Browns. Not anymore. It's a sign that the Apocalypse is upon us and life as we once knew it is over. The Ravens had been to the playoffs six of the past seven years, but this isn't the time to talk about playoffs. All hope is about gone, fading with Travis Coons' game-winning, 32-yard field goal in sudden-death overtime. All that has to be done now is the mathematical equation of when the Ravens will be officially eliminated from postseason contention.\nMary Kay Cabot and Tom Reed discuss Josh McCown and the offense Mary Kay Cabot and Tom Reed discuss Josh McCown and the offense.\nThen there's the flip side ... Plain Dealer columnist Terry Pluto says the win at Baltimore likely saved the Browns' season :\nThe Browns won the kind of game that they have been losing week after week. Make it year after year. You could even say, decade after decade. ... But this time, the Browns' (Joe Thomas) was smiling. He was like a big kid who was told there was no money left for Christmas presents, then found his favorite Xbox Game under the tree. \"Now this will give us a real boost,\" said Thomas. \"I know it's one game, but it still means a lot.\"\nThe Plain Dealer's Bud Shaw says the victory makes a big difference for the Browns , and he says the play of McCown is exceeding expectations:\nIt may not be the healthiest strategy to depend on McCown to keep slicing defenses, but it's working. And confidence is building, not despite him, but because of him. It's not only working. That's faint praise. Sunday it reversed a season heading in the wrong direction: 1-3 is a bad start; 1-4 with Denver and Arizona as two of the next three opponents â€“ would've introduced yet another black cloud into a young season. OK, blacker cloud.\nGary Barnidge on his acrobatic TD catch in Browns OT win over Ravens Cleveland Browns tight end Gary Barnidge talks about his acrobatic legs catch for a touchdown in the Browns come-from-behind overtime win over the Baltimore Ravens. Dave Andersen, Northeast Ohio Media Group\nBefore Sunday, there had been plenty of people calling for the Browns to bench McCown ... Akron Beacon Journal columnist Marla Ridenour was one of them. She writes the Browns made the right decision not to listen to her and other detractors:\nFor the first time in years when it comes to quarterbacks, the Browns made the wise and astute decision. They didn't cave to fan or media pressure over the wildly popular Manziel. They realized they couldn't use their full playbook if they went forward with Manziel, just starting to study and take the game seriously in his second year. ... But even the Browns' front office couldn't have expected this. McCown is accomplishing things that Brian Sipe, Bernie Kosar or Otto Graham never did.\nJosh McCown on Gary Barnidge's acrobatic catch in Browns OT win over the Ravens Cleveland Browns quarterback Josh McCown talks about the acrobatic legs catch by tight end Gary Barnidge that brought the Browns closer to their 33-30 overtime victory over the Baltimore Ravens at M&T Stadium Sunday, Oct 11, 2015. Dave Andersen, Northeast Ohio Media Group\nThe Browns couldn't run the ball and the defense again had its struggles, but McCown did get some help, most notably from tight end Gary Barnidge, who made an absurd catch for a touchdown in the fourth quarter that gave Cleveland a 22-21 lead :\n\"I knew the ball was on my leg and (I) clenched my legs and trapped it,\" said Barnidge, who was upset with himself for a pair of uncharacteristic drops. \"There was a lot of luck and awareness. Not a lot of skill involved in that.\"\nCoach Mike Pettine says he hopes it is a signature win for the Browns:\n\"I talked to the guys. Sometimes you have wins that can define a season or be a turning point, and we hope that was it for us. We did a lot of bad things but we found a way. The resolve of the men on the sideline ... defensively we didn't play well, but we made just enough plays. I can't speak enough about the guys on offense. They just kept going out, were down 14-3, and kept going at it. It was a team win and was sorely needed, and will be much enjoyed.\"", "external_links": ["http://www.baltimoresun.com/sports/ravens/bal-losing-to-the-browns-eliminates-just-about-all-hope-for-the-ravens-20151011-column.html", "http://www.baltimoresun.com/sports/ravens/bal-baltimore-ravens-cleveland-browns-20151011-story.html", "http://www.ohio.com/sports/browns/marla-ridenour-josh-mccown-rewards-browns-for-wise-decision-puts-aside-personal-redemption-for-city-s-teammates-joy-1.631557"], "published": "2015-10-12T10:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T12:24:00.621+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
