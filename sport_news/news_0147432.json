At least, that's how the saying goes.\nFans in any sport like the flashy plays. An overtime winner, a booming home run, or a massive hit in football get the highlights on sports shows. In UFC, fans love knockouts. The league even has a \"knockout of the night\" post-fight bonus given to the best KO of any event.\nThe fans want what the fans want, and welterweight No. 1 contender Johny Hendricks knows that. The Dallas native is set to face off against No. 3 Tyron Woodley at UFC 192 in Houston this weekend.\nHendricks, who is a former welterweight title holder, was thought to be in line for a trilogy match with current champion Robbie Lawler, but Carlos Condit was given the nod over the division's No. 1 contender.\nHendricks was recently Quote: d by MMA Junkie saying that he didn't get another shot at the title partly because of UFC fans.\n\"It's not even so much the UFC's fault,\" he told the site of not getting the title fight. \"It's also the fans; whenever they do a polling of the fans, they might want something different.\"\nThe Dallas Morning News was able to sit down with Hendricks recently to talk all things UFC 192. He clarified on the comments saying the article's headline was \"100 percent misleading.\"\n\"The title sucked. What I said was they did a polling and the UFC listened to the fans and they want to see Carlos Condit and Robbie Lawler,\" Hendricks said. \"They don't want to see me. That sucks. What can I do? The fans helped them out, they helped Carlos Condit out. Yeah, I'm still going to say that. I'm not sitting here saying that it's the fans' fault like that report says. It is what it is.\n\"There's going to be Johny haters out there. They're the ones who aren't going to read the article. They're going to read the headline and say, 'Oh. Johny hates the fans.' Anyone who has known me, anyone who has done a report on me and anyone who actually reads besides the headline they know that's not the case.\"\nOn Twitter:\n @Josh_Friemel", "external_links": ["http://mmajunkie.com/2015/09/johny-hendricks-its-partly-the-fans-fault-i-didnt-get-title-rematch", "https://twitter.com/Josh_Friemel"], "published": "2015-09-30T05:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T17:38:03.846+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
