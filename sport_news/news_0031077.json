We got to take it one game at a time and hopefully get the same goal, win every game.\" \nThe other thing the win accomplished is Salem Academy, No. 3 in the OSAA's power rankings, sets up an Oct. 16 showdown with rival Blanchet, No. 4 in the power rankings, for second place in the PacWest. \n\"I'm excited,\" senior quarterback Andrew Baker said. \"I think we can do good things, but we'll see. We're confident.\" \nBaker was an efficient 15 of 18 passing for 261 yards and touchdown passes to Rylan Stamback, Kaleb Carmony and Wilson McLean. \nIn all he mixed six receivers into the passing game and kept Jefferson's defense on its heels all night. \n\"I'd say definitely it's a chemistry,\" Palanuk said. \"Every day we're running routes after practice and we're getting timing down, play after play after play and rep after rep.\" Conference showdowns starting to heat up \nFor a Salem Academy team that focuses on the passing game, Palanuk showed the Crusaders can grind the ball out on the ground when they need to. \nHe rushed for 76 yards and two touchdowns on 13 carries, only one longer than 10 yards, and provided a ball-control element to the game. \n\"Braden runs really hard and he's a great running back,\" Baker said. \"I couldn't ask for a better running back next to me.\" \nSalem Academy's defense limited Jefferson to 83 yards of offense and four first downs in the first half. \nThe Crusaders also scored on defense. \nKyle Haslebacher returned an interception 47 yards for a touchdown and Jefferson snapped an attempt at a punt through the back of the end zone for a safety. \nbpoehler@StatesmanJournal.com , (503) 399-6701 or Twitter.com/bpoehler Buy Photo \nJefferson High School's Justus Arlundson (21) brings down Salem Academy's Kaleb Carmony (5) during their football game on Friday night in Jefferson.
