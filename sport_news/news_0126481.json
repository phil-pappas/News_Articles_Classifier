He suffered a seizure and doctors, nurses, coaches and trainers worked to keep him breathing. \nThe rural community is 11 miles from the nearest town, so after a 20-minute wait for an ambulance officials summoned a medical helicopter from Tyler, about 50 miles to the north. He remained in critical condition until dying Saturday night. No official cause of death has been determined. \nAlto High School has an enrollment of almost 200 students.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T21:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T22:14:48.349+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
