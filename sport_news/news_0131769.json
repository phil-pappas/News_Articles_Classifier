The eighth-grade Warriors from Ewing Grade School hope to make their mark at the state tournament. They also will mark the birthday that day of team member Zach Dungy. Zach died after a July 20 collision near the intersection of Camp Hope Road and Kettermen Lane in Ewing. To honor Zach, and to let the world know that they wouldn't be heading to state without him, the boys in the team's photo display Zach's No. 10 jersey. And before the players have take the field this season, they yell -- in unison -- \"Team Dungy.\" The Ewing Warriors are scheduled to face the team from New Hope at 11:30 a.m. The tournament runs throughout the day, Saturday, culminating with a champion being crowned. The Warriors won their shot to the Southern Illinois Junior High School Athletic Association Class S state tournament with a shutout victory, earning them the regional title on Monday. It was the first time that a Ewing baseball or softball team played in a regional championship game. The win capped off a terrific 16-2 season. If the Warriors are successful in the tournament's first round, they will play two more times, with four places -- 1st through 4th -- being awarded. The two teams to not win in the first round are eliminated. Coaches Jestin \"Pokey\" Squires, Denzil McClintock, Craig Zinzilieta and Mike Holman lead the team made up of (players listed by number): 2-Aiden Beaty, 3-Aaron Webb, 4-Judd Hicks, 5-Holden Allsopp, 7-Jacob Anderson, 8-Wyatt McClintock, 9-Zane Harmon, 11-Logan Browning, 12-Dillon Poe, 13-Jake Zinzilieta,14-Bennett Browning, 15-Alex Sharp, 16-Kael Pearce, 17-Nason Clark, 18-Brendan Minor, 20-Dylan Stubblefield, 21-Isaiah Sprehe, 23-Hunter Roberts, 28-Jaron Picklesimer, 29-Jaden Smith and 42-Lucas Holman.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T19:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T08:42:25.940+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
