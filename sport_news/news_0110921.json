Kraemer was killed early Sunday morning in a single vehicle accident in Madison County. \nThe redshirt defensive lineman joined the team in August after transferring from UTEP. He had not played in any games this season for Eastern. \nThe Colonels will also wear gold shoelaces on Saturday night to help raise awareness for childhood cancer. Over 13,500 children nationwide are diagnosed with cancer each year, and in Kentucky pediatric cancer rates are higher than many other parts of the country. \nEKU purchased its gold shoe laces from Go4theGoal.org, who then donated a portion of the proceeds to UK Children’s Hospital. \nThe Colonels and Wildcats are scheduled to kick off at 7:30 p.m. at Commonwealth Stadium.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T23:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T06:10:34.367+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
