A few were in direct response to a question, and a few were unprompted. \nThe Ball State coach clearly felt the need to hammer that point home after a 24-10 loss to visiting Toledo. A true freshman quarterback making his second career start, Neal showed that youth Saturday in completing 23 of 37 passes for 236 yards and a touchdown, totals boosted mostly by a strong second half after the Cardinals fell behind by 24 points. \n\"Riley certainly looked like a freshman at times today,\" Lembo said. \nAnd that can be hard to keep in perspective sometimes because, for the most part, he didn't really look like a freshman in his first three games. \nFor the first time in his collegiate career – and maybe ever, considering his video-game numbers at nearby Yorktown High School – Neal was unable to find any success running the ball, finishing with 11 carries for 0 yards (he entered the game averaging 6.2 yards per attempt). That meant the 6-foot-5 signal-caller had to rely solely on his arm, which delivered mixed results.
