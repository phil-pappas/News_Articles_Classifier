(Photo: David Guralnick, Detroit News) \nEdmonton, Alberta – In an effort to get more offense throughout the lineup coach Jeff Blashill shuffled his lines.\nOne of the new creations has Riley Sheahan centering Gustav Nyquist and Tomas Tatar, three young players capable of creating offense that’s been missing.\nIt’s a good opportunity for Sheahan to break out, having one goal in the first five games, but now playing with two goal-scoring wingers.\n“That line, in particular, has to be a good and consistent line,” said Blashill, who is looking for someone to complement or take some of the scoring load off the Dylan Larkin-Henrik Zetterberg-Justin Abdelkader line. “I’m looking for them to take the next step.”\nThe Red Wings are hoping that Sheahan takes another step in his young career this season.\nOnly 23, Sheahan has the size (6-foot-3, 222-pounds) and hands to become a two-way force in the NHL, scoring at one end and shutting down opposing centers.\nBut attaining that consistency at the NHL level is something Sheahan is still learning.\n“He’s real good defensively and he has a big body,” Blashill said. “He protects the puck well and he can make good seam passes in tight places.\n“I’d like to see him spend more time in the offensive zone.”\nSheahan understands the importance of his line producing offense and taking some of the pressure of Zetterberg’s line.\n“Obviously it would help,” Sheahan said. “You go throughout our lineup, we have to many good players. Our depth is one of the things that’ll be working in our favor.\n“It’s (important) to get more contributions throughout our lines.”\nLast visit \nThe Red Wings are making their final regular season appearance at Rexall Place (formerly Northlands Coliseum).\nNow it’s 32nd season, the arena has seen the brilliant Oilers’ dynasty headed by Wayne Gretzky and Mark Messier , and been the home rink of many Hall of Famers and legendary hockey figures.\nThe Oilers are moving into a new downtown arena next season.\nSimilar to the Red Wings’ new arena, there will be an entertainment district by the new Edmonton arena which locals are hoping will energize a sleepy downtown area.\nMore than a few Red Wings players rate Rexall as one of the better places to play.\n“There’s so much history here,” Sheahan said. “The fans, they’ve gone through a whirlwind and it’s definitely a historical organization.\n“To be in the same building and feel that pride, it’s pretty cool.”\nSheahan compares the situation to the Red Wings’ current dilemma.\n“It’ll be sad to see it leave, but a new building is always exciting,” Sheahan said.\nIce chips \nDylan Larkin and Edmonton rookie Connor McDavid , the No. 1 overall pick in June’s draft, spent time together last month during the league’s rookie showcase.\nThe two competed as teens, also, in national tournaments.\n“I’ve played against him since I was probably 12, 13,” Larkin said. “He’s always been a special player. He’s a good guy. It’s good to see a nice, humble guy like that.”\n…There were no changes to the Red Wings lineup. Brendan Smith was the extra defenseman, but will play at some point during this road trip, said Blashill.\n“We have to keep guys playing,” Blashill said. “We have seven good ones (defensemen), but as a group they can all play better, so that’s going to be the first focus.”\n\nted.kulfan@detroitnews.com \ntwitter.com/tkulfan", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T19:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T01:20:15.534+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
