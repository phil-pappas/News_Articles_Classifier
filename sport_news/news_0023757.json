It came after a shot hit Yorktown goalie Tyrah Bell in the hands and she was unable to corral it. \nBefore Bell could recover, Mariah Bailey swooped in and knocked the ball into the net, tying the game for Jay County. The Jay County offense was stagnant up to that point, but the goal provided an opportunity for a momentum swing. \nThe goal could have taken the air out of the Yorktown team after such an uplifting start, but Ashton's team was prepared for an aggressive Jay County offense. \n\"I talked to (my players) before the game and told them that (Jay County) is going to be able to score,\" Ashton said. \"We just have to drive the ball to the net, get started and keeping doing what we need to.\" \nTigers forward Hannah Rapp listened to the message and responded. With just seconds left in the half, she outran the Patriots defense and flicked the ball into the net just before Rogers could block it, giving her Tigers a 2-1 halftime lead. \nTrying to put the game on ice, Yorktown's Katie Nixon hit the post early in the second half, unable to extend the lead. Soon after, Lizzie Smith swung a shot off a free kick from 20 yards away just over Rogers' head, giving her team an insurance goal. \n\"It felt amazing. At the beginning of the season, I wasn't hitting all of those free kicks,\" Smith said. \"At the last Jay County game, I hit one of those, so I'm really excited to have been able to contribute to the win.\" \nYorktown's defense was tested, but besides the lone goal in the first half, remained unbroken. Bell finished the game with nine saves, the final line of a defense that swarmed Jay County's forwards whenever they started to approach the box. \nGabbie Mann scored three goals in Jay County's sectional semifinal win but was blanked in the championship. She had her chances and attacked recklessly, but usually found a Yorktown defender between her and the goalie. \n\"Nobody had to defend alone, that was the key,\" Ashton said. \nContact prep sports reporter David Polaski at dpolaski@muncie.gannett.com.
