SDSU also secured the second point in the South Dakota Showdown Series, sponsored by South Dakota Corn. \nOverall, the Jackrabbits outshot the Coyotes, 25-4, and scored a goal in each half. Reigning Summit League Offensive Player of the Year Diana Potterveld, a senior from Fort Collins, Colorado, scored the first goal for the Jacks 31 minutes into the game. Potterveld notched her third goal of the season. \nIn the 80th minute of play, senior Alyssa Brazil obtained SDSU’s second goal of the game when she sent the ball rolling into the net out of the goalkeeper’s reach. The goal was Brazil’s second of the season and moved her into the eighth place spot on the SDSU career charts with 17 goals. \nJunior Nicole Inskeep made one save for the Jacks adding another shutout to her record. USD’s Katelyn Floysand nearly gave the Coyotes an early lead as she sent the ball soaring to the net just under the crossbar, but Inskeep made a jumping save by tipping the ball behind the net and out of danger. \nUSD’s record falls to 4-11-0 in the season, and 1-3 in conference play. \nThe Jackrabbits will return to Fishback Soccer Park, Sunday, to take on North Dakota State University.
