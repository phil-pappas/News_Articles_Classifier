The franchise hasn't won a playoff game since 1990, when it defeated the Houston Oilers at Riverfront Stadium. And it's never won a Super Bowl, having lost both appearances to the San Francisco 49ers in 1981 and 1988.\nBut Cincinnati enters Sunday's matchup at Paul Brown Stadium (10 a.m. Pacific Time, FOX) with the Seahawks at 4-0. Quarterback Andy Dalton is getting early MVP consideration, the offensive line has allowed two sacks this season and the rushing attack is tied for 7th in the NFL in yards-per-game (128) with the Seahawks.\n\"The players have done what they've been asked to do and that's all we can be,\" coach Marvin Lewis said Wednesday. \"They've been down these roads before, four (wins) doesn't get you anything and they realize that. So we've just got to keep playing. The other people, I can't talk for. I don't understand what people expect us to be.\"\nThe Bengals have leaned heavily on a downfield passing game to produce the NFL's No. 2 offense, at 422 yards per game. Wide receiver A.J. Green is one of the league's best deep threats. And Dalton, who's come under heavy criticism the past few years for his postseason shortcomings, owns the league's second-best passer rating (123), trailing only Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers (125.9).\nThe Bengals also have 15 pass plays of more than 25 yards, most in the NFL. \n\"They like to throw deep,\" Seahawks safety Kam Chancellor said. \"They like to let that ball go, man. Throwing deep, throwing seams, they got a lot of trick shifts. There are a few gadgets here and there but they're trying to hit those seams to the tight ends and speedy receivers.\"\nThat means the Legion of Boom should be tested more than it has the past two weeks. Chicago Bears quarterback Jimmy Clausen rarely threw downfield and Detroit Lions quarterback Matthew Stafford mostly seemed to shy away from trying Seattle's safeties as well.\nIt may be part of the reason why, after four games, the Seahawks have yet to record an interception. It's something safety Earl Thomas said the secondary hasn't talked about. \nBut it's fair to wonder: Has it become harder to intercept passes because teams are hesitant to test them?\n\"I think we have a great front 7. They do the hard work, and we just try to add to that,\" Thomas said, deflecting the question. \"Without them, I think it would be probably be bombs over Baghdad in the deep end.”\nIt's not as though the secondary has been ineffective. The return of Chancellor in Week 3, in particular, and the emergence of cornerback Cary Williams is helping the Seahawks hold opponents to 190 passing yards per game. \nWilliams, 30, signed a three-year, $18 million deal with Seahawks over the offseason after spending the previous two with the Philadelphia Eagles. Tough for the veteran has been learning the \"step-kick\" technique used by the Seahawks defense, which focuses on staying on top of receivers instead of trailing and making contact around the line of scrimmage.   \nAfter some initial frustration transitioning, Williams played well in Monday's win, limiting receiver Calvin Johnson and recording a pass defensed. \n\"From OTAs to now, it’s a big, big, big leap,\" Thomas said of Williams' improvement. \"He’s very comfortable out there.\"\nUndoubtedly, he'll get tested again this weekend.\nBut Chancellor added he wouldn't be surprised if Cincinnati played conservatively either, nor does he think it matters. \n\"It doesn't really change our game much,\" he said. \"We're a one-eyed team and a lot of the things that they run are our issues. So we just have to be on them, communicate and just be disciplined.\"\nLynch, Jackson, host of others, miss practice   \nFor the second day in a row, the same six Seahawks missed practice because of injuries. Those who sat out were running back Marshawn Lynch (hamstring), defensive end Demarcus Dobbs (shoulder), cornerback Tye Smith (hip), cornerback Tharold Simon (toe), cornerback Marcus Burley (hand), running back Fred Jackson (ankle) and linebacker Kevin Pierre-Louis (hamstring).\nDefensive tackle Brandon Mebane (groin), wide receiver Ricardo Lockette (shortness of breath) and safety Steven Terrell (hip) were full participants.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T04:41:30.109+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
