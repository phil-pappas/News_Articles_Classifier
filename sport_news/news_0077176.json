It was the second straight win for the Eagles, and snapped the Giants' three-game win streak. The visiting Giants scored first, but then gave up 27 unanswered points. Though both teams now have identical records of 3-3, by virtue of the head-to-head win, the Eagles now lead the NFC East division.\nPhiladelphia's win over the Giants, was the final game played on the sixth week of the 2015 NFL season . There are still five undefeated teams remaining; those teams are Cincinnati, New England, Denver, Carolina and Green Bay. Here is a look at the latest NFL Power rankings .\n1) Last Week # 1- Cincinnati Bengals (6-0): Quarterback Andy Dalton continues to pass every test. Cincy has a bye week coming up and then will be on the road to take on the fast-rising Pittsburgh Steelers . The week 8 showdown may well coincide with the return of Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger. Mark the calendar.\n2) LW # 2 - New England Patriots (5-0): Tom Brady and the Patriots just keep winning. Their +80 point differential is the best in the NFL . It is hard to believe this defense actually lost Vince Wilfork, Darrelle Revis and Brandon Browner this past offseason. In the upcoming week 7 contest, the rough and ready New York Jets will provide a stiff test for the Pats defense and vice versa.\n3) LW # 3 - Green Bay Packers (6-0): Defense wins championships. It also doesn't hurt that the Packers have a clutch quarterback like Aaron Rodgers running the offense. The Packers have been tested in each of their last three wins, but have come through. Most impressive may have been the last game, in which the Pack won despite San Diego quarterback Philip Rivers having thrown for 503 yards.\n4) LW # 6 - Carolina Panthers (5-0): It may be time to start taking this team more seriously. It is not just the ability of quarterback Cam Newton, but his emergence as a leader. This had been the most sorely lacking part of his game, but this season he is a different person. With Newton running the offense, and All-pro linebacker Luke Kuechly now back in the lineup and anchoring the defense, the Panthers are a force to be reckoned with.\n5) LW # 7 - Denver Broncos (6-0): Quarterback Peyton Manning continues to play mediocre, but the Denver defense is always there to save the day. Through the first six games, the toughest teams they faced were Baltimore and Kansas City. After the bye this week, they will face the Green Bay Packers in Week 8; this will be the acid test.\n6) LW # 5 - Arizona Cardinals (4-2): The Cards have the feel of an elite team, but some aspects are rather troubling. The defense is great against the pass, but not against the run. The loss this weekend to a Steelers team which was playing it's third-string quarterback, is puzzling. Former defensive coordinator Todd Bowles is now head coach of the New York Jets. When Bowles left, he may have taken something with him.\n7) LW # 4 - Atlanta Falcons (5-1): Even if it was a tough division game played on the road, the Falcons had no business losing to the New Orleans Saints last week. If this team is for real, they should be above getting \"overwhelmed by the moment.\" Hopefully it was just a hiccup. Falcons are a solid team, but not invincible.\n8) LW # 9 - New York Jets (4-1): A ferocious defense and a most enviable ground game have the New York Jets and their fans, thinking playoffs. This may not be a perfect team, but they are undeniably gritty. The defense is only allowing an average of 15 points per game. On offense, quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick has been efficient and running back Chris Ivory has been stellar.\n9) LW # 10 - Pittsburgh Steelers (4-2): Ben Roethlisberger's injury may have been the best thing to happen to this team. Since Big Ben wet down with a knee injury, the team has pulled together and are functioning much better as a unit. Beating the Arizona Cardinals while using a combination of Mike Vick and Landry Jones at quarterback, was huge. As long as running back Le'Veon Bell stays healthy, they will be tough to beat. Big Ben is due back in week 8 vs Cincinnati.\n10) LW # 13 - Philadelphia Eagles (3-3): Consistency is the name of the game. The Eagles defense is fine, but the offense has been inconsistent all year long. Quarterback Sam Bradford has been up and down, and running back DeMarco Murray's struggles have been well-documented. Against the Giants, Murray had 22 carries for 109 yards and one touchdown. If Murray has finally gotten comfortable in the Philly offense, it could mean trouble for the rest of the NFL.\nHonorable mention: #11) Seattle Seahawks - The struggle is real. 12) Minnesota Vikings - This offense has great potential. 13) San Diego Chargers - Philip Rivers throws for 503 yards but still loses ? Unbelievable. 14) Indianapolis Colts - No more fake punts, please. 15) Buffalo Bills - Still hanging on the fringes of the playoffs, but injuries are piling up.", "external_links": ["http://www.nfl.com/scores", "https://sports.yahoo.com/nfl/new-york-giants-philadelphia-eagles-20151019021/"], "published": "2015-10-20T22:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T00:25:41.403+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
