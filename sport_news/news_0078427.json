So for us, we have to focus on what we did well and learn from our mistakes and come out with a lot of energy and play as good as we did the other night.” \n“I know they were really disappointed in their game, just from reading comments in the paper,” added Vancouver coach Willie Desjardins. “But I thought it was a really close game. They had some chances that didn’t go in. If they go in, they get some momentum. I think we’ll see a similar game, maybe they are going to go harder. I don’t think they are going to change a lot of what they do. Maybe they think their intensity has to be higher, but I would expect them to be ready and playing hard tonight.” \nNot surprisingly, the Canucks will make no lineup changes. That means defenceman Yannick Weber and rookie forward Jake Virtanen will be healthy scratches tonight. \n“We analyzed it really hard,” Desjardins said. “We have two guys that are sitting out who can both play and we want to get them in the lineup. Every day we are looking for that. They deserve to play, but the hard part is you have to take somebody out. In the end we ended up going with the same lineup.” \nThat means the Canucks will line up this way up front: Henrik and Daniel Sedin will play with Brandon Sutter; Bo Horvat will centre Radim Vrbata and Sven Baertschi; rookie centre Jared McCann will skate between Burrows and Jannik Hansen; and Adam Cracknell will centre Derek Dorsett and Brandon Prust. \nOn defence, Alex Edler will skate with Chris Tanev, Dan Hamhuis will be paired with Matt Bartkowski, while rookie Ben Hutton and Luca Sbisa will comprise the third pair. Ryan Miller starts in goal. \nThe Flames, meanwhile are making some changes. Jonas Hiller will replace Karri Ramo in goal and former Canuck Mason Raymond, who was a healthy scratch on Wednesday night, replaces Josh Jooris. \nCaptain Mark Giordano said he expects a much different Flames team tonight. \n“Our all-around team game was nowhere close,” Giordano said today of Wednesday night’s loss. “We have to have that passion, that intensity that we didn’t have in Game 1. It’s on us, it’s on myself, the leaders of this team to sort of pick that up right from the get-go tonight. \n“You know what, our systems play wasn’t good, a lot of things weren’t good, but it was all a result of the fact that we just weren’t hungry enough and didn’t play with enough passion, which is very uncharacteristic of us. So we’ll change that tonight.” \nCalgary’s forward lines are expected to look like this tonight: \nSean Monahan will skate between Jiri Hudler and Johnny Gaudreau; Sam Bennett will centre Raymond and Michael Frolik; Mikael Backlund will be between Lance Bouma and Brandon Bollig; and Matt Stajan will centre Micheal Ferland and David Jones. \nOn defence, Giodano will be paired with Dougie Hamilton, Kris Russell will play alongside Dennis Wideman and former Vancouver Giant Brett Kulak will skate with Deryk Engelland.INJURIES \nThe Canucks are without LW Chris Higgins (foot) and G Jacob Markstrom (hamstring).", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T01:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T06:09:12.093+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
