CHRIS CARLSON, THE ASSOCIATED PRESS Related article » The nation’s two largest metropolitan areas are separated by a 2,500-mile flight across the belly of North America, three time zones and what could be a column full of shallow stereotypes and smack talk about the cultural differences between tanned, toned, fake-smiling Los Angeles residents and frumpy, foul-mouthed New Yorkers.\nWe could debate the merits of beaches versus boroughs, sand versus skyscrapers, sprawl versus tall, sun and drought versus biting winters and snowstorms, freeways versus subways, casual versus corporate, the Hollywood Walk of Fame versus Wall Street, or flip flops versus flipping off.\nBut all that would be a superficial oversimplification of the complex rivalry between these two cities on opposite ends of America, frequently fighting for supremacy as the capital for entertainment, finance, cuisine, art, and, once again, beginning Friday night, sports.\nThe Dodgers play host to the New York Mets in Game 1 of the NLDS, with Los Angeles and New York going head-to-head for high stakes that have rarely, at least lately, involved sports and, of course, also celebrity sports fans.\nIn 2014 the Kings defeated the New York Rangers in the Stanley Cup Final, ending an almost 33-year drought of these cities’ major sports teams battling over a championship.\nThe Dodgers beat the Yankees in the 1981 World Series. The Lakers faced the New York Knicks in the NBA Finals in 1970, 1972 and 1973.\nGiven that is has been a while since Los Angeles and New York have regularly played each other for something big, we have to wonder how much of a city grudge match there can be.\nNeither city has recently dominated baseball like the St. Louis Cardinals or the San Francisco Giants. There’s no NFL team in Los Angeles (yet), the Lakers and Knicks both have bigger problems than each other, and hockey just resumed and is, well, hockey.\nMoreover, this isn’t even the World Series, but merely the NLDS. And this matchup doesn’t hold the allure of the Dodgers against the more vaunted, and more symbolically New York, Yankees.\nSo while this meeting may give America a reason to pick a side in the Los Angeles-New York fisticuffs, the more interesting Dodgers-Mets backstory lies not in their cities’ differences but in the clubs’ commonalities and entangled histories. There wouldn’t be one without the other.\nThe Dodgers wouldn’t be called the Dodgers, shortened from Trolley Dodgers, without having been born in the trolley car-maze/borough of Brooklyn in 1884. (The club began as the Brooklyn Atlantics in the American Association before taking the name Dodgers in 1911.)\nNine of the 10 retired Dodgers numbers are for players who began their careers as Brooklyn Dodgers. The Mets have retired four numbers, including that of former USC pitcher Tom Seaver and color-barrier-breaking Brooklyn Dodger Jackie Robinson, for whom the rotunda at the Mets’ Citi Field is named.\nHad the Dodgers not left Brooklyn to start the 1958 season in Los Angeles, the New York Metropolitan Baseball Club might have never been born in 1962.\nWithout the Dodgers, the Mets wouldn’t have blue as part of their color scheme. (The Mets’ orange is a tribute to Giants, that other ballclub that left New York for California.)\nBefore 2009, when the Dodgers moved spring training to the Cactus League in Arizona, they had spent 60 years in Dodgertown in Vero Beach, Fla., on the grounds of a former Naval air base. Their closest Grapefruit League playmate from 1988-2008? The Mets in Port St. Lucie.\n1 2 Next Page", "external_links": ["http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/twitter-ico.jpg", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/fb-ico.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nvxpg9-smith.dodgers.1009.jpg", "http://assets.pinterest.com/js/pinmarklet.js?r=", "http://s7.addthis.com/js/250/addthis_widget.js#username=YOUR-ACCOUNT-ID", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/mail-ico.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nvxpg9-smith.dodgers.1009.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T19:51:08.627+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
