But en route to the final result, they earned kudos from the tough headmaster for erasing a 3-0 deficit and showing the resilience so lacking in their character in last season’s second half. \n“We have a tendency that when things go bad, we seem to feel bad and we seem to be fragile,” said Babcock, sounding for a moment like frustrated predecessor Randy Carlyle. “Tonight I felt we kept playing. \n“I would have loved to have won the game. We should have scored on the breakaway (by Brad Boyes during 3-on-3) on the 2-on-1 and we should have scored on the power play (that turned 3-on-3 into a 4-on-3). But from where we were, I think it’s positive. You just gotta believe every day when you come to the rink you’ll be winning You can’t be hoping, you have to know you’re going to win.” \nThat’s something else for the players to ponder in the unusually long five days off so early in the National Hockey League schedule. Surely that time off would have been excrutiating if they’d followed Friday’s 4-0 no-show in Detroit up with a one-sided loss in the Battle of Ontario. \nBut Babcock made a good point, they deserved better after a scoreless first they had dominated, before falling back on three power-play goals. \n“I thought we worked real hard and we shouldn’t have been behind,” Babcock said. \nThen came the rally that Babcock hoped would be kindled by almost a month of training camp drills and psychological repair. There was Daniel Winnik’s nice play to free Joffrey Lupul in front to end the latter’s long goal drought. Then came captain Dion Phaneuf’s stretch pass from the shadow of the Leaf net to Tyler Bozak, a breakaway that might have been one of Phaneuf best assists as a Leaf. \nThere was Peter Holland working free in tight for a power-play goal to tie it and after Mark Stone’s potential dagger for Ottawa midway through the third. The capper was Boyes and Winnik grinding out another tying goal. \nOr did they? As Winnik and Boyes celebrated, one of the referees waved it off, convinced it had hit the post. The look of the two stunned Leafs in mid-embrace was priceless as they hustled back, until play was blown dead. Replays clearly showed the puck had hit the TV camera attached to the net’s centre support. \n“I thought it was in and Winny celebrated because he thought so,” said Boyes. “I went over to congratulate him. Then for a second I thought there might be a second puck out there.” \nWinnik momentarily thought he’d missed some 10-bell save from Craig Anderson, but was relieved to have his first of the year. Boyes and P.A. Parenteau had their first points as Leafs on the goal, but when the Leafs could not solve Anderson in 3-on-3 time, with the power play thrown in, Mike Hoffman’s goal was the second to beat James Reimer in the tiebreaker. \n“It’s open ice, that’s what the league wants, end-to-end and it creates plays,” said Boyes said of the Leafs’ first official encounter with 3-on-3. “I go down and miss the net, they come back 3-on-1, a turnover and I get a breakaway.” \nAfter three games in four nights, Babcock made the expected changes. The Leafs had come out with renewed purpose after being out-classed in Detroit the night before, in large part to some new forward units, defensive pairings, a change in goal and two new players in the lineup. \nTight-lipped after Babcock shelved him for the first two games, Roman Polak came back with Martin Marincin as his partner. Babcock praised Polak for getting better as the evening progressed and called it Phaneuf’s best game as a Leaf since his arrival as coach. \nThat was part of a re-shuffled blueline with the left shooting Morgan Rielly changing to the right to be with Matt Hunwick. That re-united Phaneuf and Jake Gardiner. \nA late scratch with an upper-body injury from the Detroit game, Shawn Matthias was replaced by Michael Grabner, who swung on to left wing with Nazem Kadri and Boyes. Bozak and James van Riemsdyk had Leo Komarov added to their right side. \nIt all added up to 16 first-period shots, or as many as the Leafs had in the first 40 minutes against the Red Wings. But the last minute proved troublesome, a hooking call on Boyes that bled into the middle period. Helped by fresh ice, Kyle Turris was open in the slot and whipped the puck over Reimer’s glove. \nToronto’s chance to even the game on special teams was wasted when Gardiner was called for hooking. And there wasn’t a shout from the bench or a slap from Reimer’s stick to warn the five Leafs on the ice that Alex Chiasson was about to leave the box. He went upstairs blocker side after taking Mika Zibanejad breakaway pass, with the Leaf coaches huddling briefly to see if they would challenge the goal for being offside. \nAnother power-play goal ensued after Parenteau got carried away with a check to the head. Reimer couldn’t gobble up a hot point drive from Erik Karlsson, one of his three assists on Saturday, and Milan Michalek pumped it by him. \nThe Leafs shook it off, began to change lines and finally got on the board at 7:05. Winnik took out his man on the end board and gave Lupul a break to beat Anderson low. The latter is filling in while Andrew Hammond gets through a minor groin injury. \nOne point would result, but it will be a loss that felt like a win.

Finally settling the disc down, he deked Craig Anderson to make it 4-4. Or did he? \nAs he and Boyes celebrated, one of the referees waved it off, convinced it had hit the post. The two stunned Leafs hustled back, but the replay showed the puck had hit the TV camera attached to the centre bar. \nDespite the loss there is considerable relief that the Leafs wouldn’t spend a five-day break in the schedule suffering from the shock of no points in three losses.
