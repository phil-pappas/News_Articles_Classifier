They aren't playing ball. All that was left to do is to sign the contract. But they are stalling. \n\"I have pulled out of the negotiations. I am no longer fighting Manny Pacquiao. \n\"They know I am a tricky fight for him and they know I will beat him. Or else, why pull out of a fight when there is a lot of money on the table? \n\"I don't really know if Mayweather is fighting Pacquiao again. It is a possible reason for him to stall on signing the contract, but I don't really know.\" \nKhan is now looking at alternative options for a fight early next year, including Sheffield's IBF welterweight champion Kell Brook. \n\"I am not going to wait around for Manny like I did for Mayweather,\" he added. \"I need to fight and if they don't want to fight then that's fine, I have other targets. \n\"I already had a back-up plan drawn up in case the Pacquiao fight didn't go to plan. We are looking at a Danny Garcia rematch. I also would like to fight Tim Bradley - that's another interesting fight. \n\"A rematch with Lamont Peterson and of course Kell Brook is also another option. I am willing to fight anyone, but it seems not everyone is willing to fight me.\" Promoted Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T10:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T16:12:11.777+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
