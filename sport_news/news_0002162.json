If the Spartans and Blue Raiders both win, Stang, Somerset and Feehan would finish as tri-champs and the Spartans would get the EAC's automatic playoff bid with the best overall record. If Stang wins but Somerset loses, the Spartans would finish as co-champs in the EAC with Feehan, but would get the automatic bid having won the head-to-head matchup. If the Shamrocks win, they would win the EAC outright and get the automatic bid, leaving the second-place bid up for grabs between Stang and Somerset based on playoff power rankings. “We’re looking at it that we have to win to get in,” said Bishop Stang coach Ryan Sylvia after explaining all of the possible scenarios. The Spartans failed to make the playoffs last year after reaching the tournament in 2013. Stang has lost its last two meetings with Feehan by a combined eight points, including 14-13 during the 2014 regular season. The Spartans will take a three-game win streak into tonight’s matchup in Attleboro. The key to Stang’s success has been a dominant rushing attack. Last week against Coyle-Cassidy, the Spartans racked up 325 rushing yards led by 188 from Nick Landry (two touchdowns) and another 90 from Jeff Chicca. Starting quarterback Will Landry suffered a knee injury and could miss the rest of the season, according to Sylvia. He’ll likely be replaced by the tandem of Chris McGuire and Matt Golden. After injuring himself during the preseason, Golden saw his first action of 2015 last week and threw a touchdown pass. The Shamrocks have also been hot as of late. After opening the season 0-3, they’ve won three straight games, all in the EAC, with wins over Martha’s Vineyard, Coyle-Cassidy and Somerset Berkley. Bishop Feehan has outscored its EAC competition 60-13. This season, the Shamrocks are averaging 18.2 points per game. Last week against Somerset Berkley, a field goal by Josh Cayer in the fourth quarter was the difference for the Shamrocks. Bishop Feehan’s lone touchdown came on a three-yard run by Jason Medeiros in the third quarter. GNB VOC-TECH AT BOURNE RECORDS: GNB Voc-Tech (4-2, 2-0 SCC B); Bourne (1-4, 0-2 SCC B) LAST WEEK: GNB Voc-Tech 47, Case 20; Fairhaven 45, Bourne 0 LAST SEASON: GNB Voc-Tech 51, Bourne 30 OUTLOOK: With a win over Bourne, the Bears can capture their third straight South Coast Conference Division B title and run their all-time conference record to 9-0 over the past three seasons. After turning the ball over on its first drive last week against Case, GNB Voc-Tech scored on every possession after that to surpass 40 points for the first time this season. The run-minded Bears wore down the Cardinals behind the running of Alex Dixon, who carried the ball 12 times for 218 yards and scored three touchdowns. The Canalmen are coming off a shutout loss to Fairhaven despite solid performances from Tyler Rondeau and Tanner Cannon. Rondeau completed 10 passes for 69 yards and Cannon had 20 rushes for 101 yards. Bourne has lost four straight since opening the year with a win over Monomoy. The Canalmen have scored 25 or more points three times, but are allowing an average of 34.6 PPG. MAYNARD AT APPONEQUET RECORDS: Maynard (3-3); Apponequet (3-3, 3-1 SCC A) LAST WEEK: West Boylston 26, Maynard 6; Apponequet 14, Seekonk 13 LAST SEASON: DNP OUTLOOK: After opening the year 0-2, the Lakers can wrap up the regular season with a winning record if they can beat visiting Maynard and could possibly earn a spot in the Div. 4 South playoffs. Brendan Cooney scored both touchdowns and Jonathan Nee had the deciding conversion in last week’s 14-13 win over Seekonk, the team’s second straight victory. Cooney led the Lakers on the ground with 21 rushes for 89 yards. Maynard’s lone touchdown a week ago came on a 38-yard scoring strike from Cal Howes to Matt Early. Zach Uglevich ran 17 times for 79 yards for Maynard, which has lost two of its last three games. WAREHAM AT DIGHTON-REHOBOTH RECORDS: Wareham (2-4, 0-3 SCC A); Dighton-Rehoboth (5-1, 3-0 SCC A) LAST WEEK: Old Rochester 41, Wareham 13; East Bridgewater 37, Dighton-Rehoboth 14 LAST SEASON: Dighton-Rehoboth 35, Wareham 0 OUTLOOK: With starting quarterback Issac Nascimento out of the lineup, the Vikings suffered their third straight loss last week, falling to previously winless Old Rochester. It doesn’t get any easier this week as Wareham takes on once-beaten Dighton-Rehoboth, which can clinch the South Coast Conference Division A title with a win. The Falcons are coming off their first loss of the season despite rushing touchdowns from Jake Salera and Cam Reed. D-R’s defense gave up 37 points to No. 17 East Bridgewater after allowing a total of just 35 in its first five games. Nascimento is likely to miss another three weeks with an injury to his non-throwing shoulder, according to head coach Dan Nault. In his absence, Stephen Toal rose to the occasion against ORR with a hand in both of his team’s touchdowns. Toal threw a scoring strike to Josh Onujiogu and scored on an eight-yard QB keeper, but the Vikings had two costly turnovers. SEEKONK AT OLD ROCHESTER RECORDS: Seekonk (1-4, 1-2 SCC A); Old Rochester (1-5, 1-2 SCC A) LAST WEEK: Apponequet 14, Seekonk 13; Old Rochester 41, Wareham 13 LAST SEASON: Seekonk 48, Old Rochester 20 OUTLOOK: The Bulldogs are finally healthy and it showed last week when they captured their first win of the season and first win under new head coach Justin Kogler. Quarterback Cam Hamilton had a hand in three touchdowns, throwing for two and rushing for another as ORR erupted for 41 points after scoring a combined 43 points in its first five games. Running back Harrison Smith ran nine times for 82 yards and scored two touchdowns. The defense was also strong, forcing two turnovers. Seekonk’s lone win this season also came against Wareham in Week 4. Outside of that game, the Warriors have struggled offensively, averaging just 6.3 points per game. Seekonk, which is coming off a one-point loss to Apponequet, has dropped two straight. The Warriors depend heavily on the play of quarterback Brendan Smith, who completed 19 passes for 201 yards and a touchdown against the Lakers. DARTMOUTH AT BARNSTABLE RECORDS: Dartmouth (4-2, 0-1 OCL); Barnstable (1-5, 0-1 OCL) LAST WEEK: Dartmouth 34, New Bedford 20; Bridgewater-Raynham 48, Barnstable 24 LAST SEASON: Dartmouth 34, Barnstable 15 OUTLOOK: The Indians, who are a lock to make the Div. 3 Southeast playoffs, are looking for a final tuneup before they officially begin their title defense from a year ago. Dartmouth is coming off an emotional win over rival New Bedford in which the Indians once again rode their defense and the back of Chris Martin. Dartmouth scored two defensive touchdowns on pick sixes by Matt Craig and Jack Sullivan, and Martin carried the ball 30 times for 198 yards and three touchdowns. In the last four games, Martin has scored 10 touchdowns and rushed for more than 900 yards. Dartmouth did not complete a pass in the game, but finished with 329 rushing yards. The Red Raiders are coming off a loss to Bridgewater-Raynham last week that clinched the Old Colony League title for the Trojans for the second straight year. Bryce Conroy threw two scoring strikes to Will O’Day, but Barnstable couldn’t stop B-R, which put 48 points on the board. The Red Raiders opened the season with four straight losses before their lone win over Somerville, 32-22, in Week 5. Barnstable is averaging 15.6 points per game while giving up an average of 40.2 ppg. CASE AT FAIRHAVEN RECORDS: Case (4-2, 1-1 SCC B); Fairhaven (3-3, 1-1 SCC B) LAST WEEK: GNB Voc-Tech 47, Case 20; Fairhaven 45, Bourne 0 LAST SEASON: Fairhaven 42, Case 26 OUTLOOK: If the Blue Devils have a shot at making the playoffs, they must finish the regular season strong. They had a huge performance last week in a 45-0 victory over Bourne, the team’s first shutout win since 2012. The offense was also impressive with running back Noah Furtado scoring five touchdowns, three on the ground, one through the air and another on an interception return. Furtado’s five TDs ties the school record for most in a game set by Nate Pickup in 1991. Quarterback Ian Furtado also had a big game, throwing three touchdowns passes, two to Brett Raymond and the third to Noah. Fairhaven could be in for a shootout this week against an improved Case team that lost last week to GNB Voc-Tech 47-20. Quarterback Brendan Costa led Case's running attack with 110 yards on 12 carries while running back Aidan Silva finished with 87 yards on 17 carries. Costa had two rushing touchdowns and threw a scoring strike, but the Cardinals couldn’t match the Bears’ offensive attack, which surpassed 40 points for the first time this season. The Cardinals are averaging 27 points per game and have scored 30 or more three times. SATURDAY’S GAME WEST BRIDGEWATER AT OLD COLONY WHEN: 6 p.m. RECORDS: West Bridgewater (5-1); Old Colony (3-3) LAST WEEK: Nantucket 14, West Bridgewater 6; Old Colony 49, Sacred Heart 16 LAST SEASON: West Bridgewater 32, Old Colony 6 OUTLOOK: The Cougars will see how their high-scoring offense stacks up against West Bridgewater’s stingy defense, which held its first five opponents to a combined 24 points. The Wildcats’ lone loss came last week to undefeated Nantucket, 14-6. Jason Emmons put West Bridgewater on the scoreboard first, but the Wildcats let up 14 unanswered points. Of West Bridgewater’s six games, three have been shutout wins. The most points they’ve given up in a game was 16 points two weeks ago against South Shore. Old Colony’s offense is averaging 24.0 points per game and has been shutout just once — a 30-0 loss to Nantucket. Jack Murphy leads all area quarterbacks with eight scoring strikes. Drew Maurer has found the end zone seven times, including three last week against Sacred Heart. Luke Cavallaro is second on the team with six touchdowns. Cam Pierce also provided a boost last week, scoring three rushing TDs. Follow Laurie Los on Twitter @LaurieLosSCT.
