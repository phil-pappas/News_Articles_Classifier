He does make some plays throughout the game that kind of go unnoticed.\"\nWilson dropped a potential 13-yard completion with 1:03 left but came back with 2 catches for 15 yards to help set up Robbie Gould's game-winning field goal.\n\"In that situation there, I know Jay (Cutler) has a good rapport with him, and there are times out here (on the practice field) when they hook up and we see some things that you really feel encouraged about.\n\"That play (the first catch after the drop), especially at that time of the game, was great to see.\"\nBigger and better: Rookie center Hroniss Grasu, who could see his first playing time of the season Sunday, has been working to get bigger and stronger since the end of the preseason.\nHe has made gains by eating even when he's full, drinking protein shakes before bed and working hard in the weight room.\n\"He's getting better,\" coach John Fox said. \"He'll get it. I think it usually takes about a year to develop a pro body. It's a different game we play now.\n\"We play pretty much two college seasons here in the NFL. So it takes a little bit of time to get used to that, and I've seen really good progress. He works very hard in the weight room.\"\nTough enough: Offensive coordinator Adam Gase saw another side of Jay Cutler in last week's performance while the quarterback played with a strained hamstring.\n\"The first thing I learned was how tough he was,\" Gase said. \"For him to go out there and perform the way he did, I don't know if I've been around a performance like that, as efficient as he was, to fight through what he had going on.\"\nConfined to the pocket, Cutler completed 28 of 43 passes for 281 yards, 2 touchdowns, 1 interceptions and an 89.4 passer rating.\n\"Him sticking around in the pocket, obviously, he did a good job of protecting himself,\" Gase said, \"and he did a good job with all his reads.\"\nCutler was sacked three times but came through the 22-20 victory healthy.\nWaiting his turn: Fourth-round rookie running back Jeremy Langford had 6 carries for 21 yards in Week 2 but just 1 carry for 4 yards in the following two weeks.\nStarter Matt Forte has 45 carries for 165 yards (3.6-yard average) the past two weeks, while Jacquizz Rodgers has 6 carries for 14 yards (2.3-yard average).\n\"The coaching staff is getting more and more comfortable with him,\" coach John Fox said of the 6-foot, 208-pound Langford. \"Sometimes it's hard to get three guys in there. But he continues to improve and show himself, and he'll get more and more playing time.\"\nGet great articles like this sent to your inbox!
