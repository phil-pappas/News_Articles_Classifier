Many officers brought their family and children to the memorial service.\nMemorial for Vancouver police dog Ike Vancouver Police dog Ike died Sept. 2 after a wanted man stabbed him. He was 6-years-old, with a \"cosmic gleam in his eye and a tail that never ceased to wag.\"\nThe dogs, alongside their handlers, formed a corridor opposite the American flag-bearing Patriot Guard Riders on the sidewalk in front of the Hilton Hotel in Vancouver.\nIke was 6 when he died Sept. 2 after a wanted man stabbed him the day before. He joined the Vancouver Police Department in 2012, said Kim Kapp, agency spokeswoman. Ike had more than 450 deployments, both for tracking and drug detection, and more than 60 captures over his three-year career.\nSpeakers described Ike as a hero, protector and family member.\n\"A hero is defined as a person who is admired or idolized for courage, outstanding achievement, or noble qualities,\" said Ike's handler, Officer Jack Anderson, who added later that he buried Ike on his property. \"Reflecting back on the last three years with Ike and what I saw Sept. 1, I would have to say I agree. I believe Ike is as close to a hero as a dog can get.\"\nVancouver Police Chief James McElvain recalled how easily Ike transitioned between his twin roles.\n\"A really good police canine must be able to apprehend a suspect one day and then turn around the next day and spend time with kids at a school, happy to be petted on and loved,\" McElvain said.\nThe corridor of K-9 units here to honor Vancouver K9 Ike. pic.twitter.com/fqlfGiXki7\n— Vancouver Police USA (@VancouverPDUSA) September 30, 2015 The Vancouver Police Department awarded Ike the Purple Heart award — which his handler, Anderson, accepted on his behalf. The Washington State Canine Association awarded Ike the Medal of Valor.\nA reception at city hall followed the memorial service.\nIke's death comes eight years after another Vancouver police dog was shot dead in the line of duty . In April 2011, a Clark County sheriff's dog named Kane was stabbed and killed during a pursuit of two suspects.\nKapp said the police department does intend to get a new police dog, but the agency doesn't have a timeline for when that would happen.\nOn Monday, the Vancouver Police Department raised nearly $30,000 at a fundraiser for the agency's police dog fund, according to a tweet.\nThank you to everyone that pledged to the K9 fundraiser tonight.
