The world No. 3 has been plagued by injury since July, after she lost the Wimbledon semifinal to Serena Williams in July. \n“I am very disappointed to have to pull out of the China Open this year and not have the chance to defend my title,” Sharapova said. \nThe Russian had been hoping to launch a comeback at the Wuhan Open. Her withdrawal from the China Open leaves a question mark over whether she will be fit to play the year-ending WTA Finals in Singapore at the end of next month.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T19:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T06:39:57.901+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
