The Storm (5-0, 3-0 NWC) is the league’s only remaining undefeated team. Who would have thought the program could elevate itself this quickly? \nWhile Squalicum is ascending to new heights for the first time, an old powerhouse — Ferndale (4-1, 3-0 NWC) — already owns more wins than it had last year, and the Golden Eagles appeared poised to compete for a league title. \nSuddenly, Lynden, which has played for the Class 2A state title each of the past four seasons, has company in the NWC, and the Lions (3-2, 2-1 NWC) are in an unfamiliar spot halfway through the year. Not in the AP top 10, not atop the NWC standings, who are these Lions? \nMeanwhile, in the 1As, Mount Baker and Meridian seem to be the class of the conference. They’ve already offered a 33-28 gem Mount Baker won that was complete with controversy regarding a mystery minute added in the game’s final moments. \nBefore the second half of the year begins, here’s a look back at what’s been a memorable first half. Best team: Squalicum \nThanks to a deep collection of athletes, an increased focus on physical play, a stingy defense and a junior quarterback who’s played with tremendous poise, the Storm have become the frontrunner to snag the NWC’s No. 1 seed in the district playoffs. \nSqualicum took down Lynden, the state runner-ups last year, 27-0 on the road. And the Storm provided an encore performance the next week by beating the defending champs, Sedro-Woolley, 42-30 at home. \nNew QB Garrett Sorenson has filled in nicely, and he’s been able to distribute the ball to Josiah Westbrook and Ben Peterson. The signal caller has completed 58 percent of his passes for 792 yards, 11 touchdowns and three INTs. He’s also ran for 204 yards and three scores. \nDefensively, Squalicum has shown an ability to match up well with some of the league’s best offenses, which was evident during its shutout of the Lions. \nIf the Storm can get past Ferndale this weekend in a game that’s shaping up to be the potentially game-of-the-year, there’s no reason to think Squalicum won’t finish the regular season undefeated. Second-half team to watch: Lynden \nThere’s no reason to be foolish. The Lions are far from finished. \nWeek 3’s 27-0 home loss to Squalicum didn’t look good, but the Lions have rebounded with convincing back-to-back wins over Anacortes and Sehome. \nNow the real work begins. These next three weeks will be more telling of who the Lions are. \nLynden enters a stretch of schedule that includes games against Burlington-Edison, Ferndale and Sedro-Woolley. Lynden looks to have solved some of its issues up front, and few teams can pass the ball like Sterling Somers and the Lions’ offense can. \nIf there’s anyone who can get the most out of a team it’s coach Curt Kramme. Lynden may not have as many physical difference makers as its had in the past, but the Lions certainly have the talent to be playing November football. MVP so far: Squalicum’s Ben Peterson \nThis is a no-brainer. \nPeterson is a game-changer, and the junior has displayed his penchant for making big plays time-and-time again through the first five weeks. \nHis stats are appealing: seven rushes, 129 yards and a TD; 13 receptions, 288 yards and four TDs. Those are through four games. \nHe also has a punt return for a touchdown, a kickoff return for a touchdown and a fumble return for a touchdown. Defensively, he supports the run tremendously from his safety spot and uses his blazing speed to track receivers. \nThe big plays he’s made, though, give him the edge over anyone else. Against Lynden, he tracked down Noah King early in the game and knocked the ball out his hands and out the back of the end zone to turn the game’s momentum. Against Sedro-Woolley, he sealed the game on the Cubs’ potential game-winning drive by stripping a ball and returning it back for a score. Against Burlington-Edison, he scored the game’s first 24 points on a rushing score, receiving score, kickoff return, field goal and three extra points. Breakout player: Jalen Kortlever, Blaine \nKortlever hadn’t seen any varsity time before this year, and wasn’t even the team’s backup QB last season. \nHe worked diligently over the summer on his passing skills and has used talented pass-catchers Anthony Ball, Jonathan Starcer and Josh Fakkema to throw for 841 yards with 12 touchdowns and three interceptions. \nHe can make all the throws and gives the Borderites an extremely balanced offense. Top performance: Jed Schleimer, Mount Baker, Week 4 vs. Nooksack Valley \nBefore the season started Schleimer said coach Ron Lepper billed him “the man” in Mount Baker’s backfield, and the junior back has not disappointed. \nHe’s amassed a league-high 1,145 yards and 15 touchdowns averaging a ridiculous 14.3 yards per carry. \nMuch of that yardage was thanks to a state record-setting performance against Nooksack Valley Week 4. Schleimer went for an official 521 yards and scored touchdowns on carries of 35, 37, 55, 75, 77 and 78 yards. Top offensive line: Ferndale \nNo NWC 2A/3A team has ran for more yards than the Golden Eagles. \nAustin Honeycutt, Justice Powell, Taylor Bellefeuille, Cole Semu and Ben Broselle are great backs, but they’re also running behind an experienced, physical offensive line. \nFerndale is averaging 279 yards per game, and paving the way has been tackles Nick Bartel and Christian Rodriguez, guards Nate Slaton and Sam Cleary, center Zach Eriksen and tight end Winterhawk Leigton. Best game: Week 5 Mount Baker at Meridian \nSqualicum’s ability to fend off Sedro-Woolley late was a great game, but no contest has been as good as the Mount Baker-Meridian matchup last week. \nThe Mountaineers fell behind 21-0 before scoring 27 unanswered points. Meridian was driving late in the fourth quarter when a mystery minute was added to the scoreboard. \nNick Dritsas scored a receiving touchdown off a tip with 2:04 left in the fourth quarter, giving the Trojans a 28-27 lead. \nBut Mount Baker went 87 yards and answered back with a touchdown from Mason Bass to T.J. Bass with 51 seconds left to give Mount Baker a wild 33-28 win. Top defense: Ferndale \nFerndale and Squalicum both have tremendous defenses, but a narrow edge goes to the Golden Eagles. \nSince showing some vulnerability against Kamiakin and Oak Harbor, Ferndale’s defense has been great against Blaine, Burlington-Edison and Anacortes. The Golden Eagles are giving up 21.8 points per game. \nTaylor Bellefeuille is arguably the most sound linebacker in the Northwest Conference, and he is flanked by Jake Leavitt. Christian Rodriguez, Winterhawk Leighton, Austin Honeycutt and Chris Hernandez form a dominating defensive line, and secondary players James Hinson, Jacob Kildall, Sky Freeman and Justice Powell have had nice seasons so far. \nFerndale is yielding a respectable 156.8 rush yards per game and only 121.8 pass yards. Oddest storyline: Meridian walkout \nThe first half of this fall season cannot be passed without remembering the odd situation at Laurel. \nTo refresh memories, a day before the Trojans’ Week 2 non-league matchup with Squalicum Meridian decided to forfeit its game. \nReports were a team walkout occurred due to players’ dissatisfaction with practice length and communication had soured between players and coaches. \nAs odd as the situation was, the Trojans played the following week and seem to have moved past the issue. Meridian is playing great football and has the looks of a state tournament team.
