Donaldson followed by hammering a 1-0 pitch for an opposite-field home run off the left-hander.\nYour browser does not support iframes. The Blue Jays must win on Monday to force a deciding game in the best-of-five series on Wednesday.\nDonaldson homered in the second game of the series on Friday, too, after leaving the opener on Thursday as a precaution feeling light-headed following a collision at second base.\nRELATED: JOSH DONALDSON LEAVES AL PLAYOFF GAME AFTER COLLISON AT SECOND BASE\nDonaldson hit a career-high 41 home runs during the regular season, when he led the American League in runs and RBIs.\nRELATED: JOSH DONALDSON MATCHES HANK AARON FEAT\nHolland was on the Wallace State team that went to the NJCAA World Series in 2006.\nHolland won 38 games for the Texas Rangers from 2011 through 2013, but knee surgery limited him to six games in 2014. He took the mound on April 10 to start the 2015 season, but that outing lasted just one inning. A strained shoulder kept Holland out of action until Aug. 19. He made nine starts down the stretch for the Rangers, including a shutout of the Baltimore Orioles on Aug. 30. Holland went 4-3 with a 4.91 ERA. In 58.2 innings, he struck out 41 and walked 17.\nHolland had a 3-0 postseason record entering Monday's game, with his most recent victory coming in the 2011 World Series.", "external_links": ["http://m.mlb.com/shared/video/embed/embed.html?content_id=522131783&topic_id=94781126&width=400&height=224&property=mlb"], "published": "2015-10-13T06:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T04:27:17.625+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
