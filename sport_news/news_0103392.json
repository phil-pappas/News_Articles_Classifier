And it's what this event sorely needed.\nGrace delivered two big shots in the gathering darkness, and the South African duo went 4-0 in team matches. Bae and Hideki Matsuyama teamed for nine birdies in 11 holes for the biggest rout of the week. And the International team played the Americans to a draw in a double session Saturday to stay just one point behind.\nConsidering how lopsided the Presidents Cup has been, it felt like a lead.\n\"We need to win this,\" Oosthuizen said. \"This is huge for us. We believe we can do it.\"\nThe Americans had a 91/2-81/2 lead. They also have Dallas' Jordan Spieth, the No. 1 player in the world. He made two clutch putts in morning foursomes to cap the biggest comeback at the Jack Nicklaus Golf Club Korea, and he made eight birdies in 14 holes in a fourballs win in the afternoon.\nNot since the matches were tied going into Sunday in 2005 has the Presidents Cup featured a final day of drama.\n\"This is what we all came here for -- for it to be exciting tomorrow,\" International captain Nick Price said.\nThe South Africans have certainly done their part, with Grace producing two critical shots.\nGrace and Oosthuizen were all square with Bubba Watson and J.B. Holmes, and it was clear their fourballs match would set the tone for the final round. Grace chipped in for birdie from left of the 16th green, raising his arm before the ball reached the cup and sharing a bear hug with his childhood friend.\nIt was getting so dark that Grace had no idea Oosthuizen's second shot into the par-5 18th hole had gone into the water. Grace could barely see the green from 263 yards away. No matter. He smashed his 3-wood, watched it disappear into the gloaming and had no idea what happened until he heard cheers.\nThe ball narrowly cleared the bunker and settled on the edge of the green.\n\"I don't know where it finished or how it got to where it did,\" Grace said. \"Just remarkable to pull a shot off like that.\"\nWatson and Holmes both missed the green, and when neither chipped in for eagle, Grace rolled his putt close enough to be conceded the birdie and a crucial win.\nThe only other team to go 4-0 in the Presidents Cup was Tiger Woods and Steve Stricker in 2009.\nThe Americans opened with a 4-1 lead Thursday and have been outplayed since.\n\"To me, it kind of feels like we're losing just because of what's gone on the last two days,\" Zach Johnson said.\nSpieth salvaged the morning session by making a pair of 7-foot putts on the final two holes and turned a small deficit into a big win with Dustin Johnson. He was just as big in the afternoon with Patrick Reed, making three straight birdies to go from 1 down to 2 up, then holing a bunker shot on No. 12.\nSpieth was so certain he was going to hole out that he asked caddie Michael Greller to get the ball out of the hole for him before he hit the shot.\n\"But not loud enough that Jason could hear,\" Spieth said.\nHe was referring to Jason Day, his chief rival for the year, who lost twice to Spieth on Saturday with Charl Schwartzel as his partner.\nSpieth and Day figured to be the marquee match in the final round, only it didn't work out that way. The pairings are announced one side at a time, and U.S. captain Jay Haas put Spieth in a singles game with Marc Leishman.\nThere were groans in the room when it was clear the Presidents Cup would not have a Spieth-Day match. Haas cared only about putting Spieth in the No. 9 slot, which tends to be the deciding match when it's close.\nOur favorite Spieth stories\nTownsend: Why Michael Greller is a perfect counterbalance for Masters champion Jordan Spieth\n(Quick note with this one: Greller also made a ton of money in a very short amount of time working with Spieth ).\nJesuit grad Jordan Speith was told, âœto stick with golf because he wasnâ™t as good at the other sportsâ\nRead Jordan Spiethâ™s heartwarming letter to the family who helped pay his tuition\nMasters champion Jordan Spieth has history with Tony Romo\n10 things you might not know about Masters, U.S. Open winner Jordan Spieth\nCheck out his $2.3 million crib Click here to see Spieth's house , which includes a 288-bottle wine closet, five bedrooms and 5.5 baths.", "external_links": ["http://dallasnews.stats.com/golf/final.asp?tour=PGA"], "published": "2015-10-08T08:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T00:29:19.588+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
