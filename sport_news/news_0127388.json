(AP Photo/John Raoux) × COLUMBIA — Steve Spurrier’s father was a preacher, and every few years he’d move from one church to another, sensing that his congregation needed to hear a new voice. That was how South Carolina’s now-former football coach explained his sudden resignation to his players in a team meeting he addressed Tuesday. “I think a little bit of that is right,” said USC senior guard Mike Matulis. “It’s time for a different kind of energy to be brought to the table.” That energy was evident in the first practice under interim head coach Shawn Elliott, who boomed music from the loudspeakers as the Gamecocks went through drills Tuesday evening. The session was likely an outlet for players who expressed shock at Spurrier’s sudden decision, but stopped short of accusing him of abandoning them. “I don’t feel he quit on us. He’s not a quitter at all,” said junior linebacker Skai Moore. “You could see that in his emotion, especially after games and stuff. I feel like he just made a decision that was best for him, and I support him 100 percent.” In the midst of a 2-4 start which represented his worst first half to a season at USC, Spurrier said earlier in the day that it was simply time for him to step aside and let someone else take over a program which had won 11 games just two years ago. Elliott, formerly the offensive line coach and co-offensive coordinator, will finish this season on an interim basis with a national search for a successor to follow. Spurrier’s absence was notable on the practice field, which he typically zipped around on a golf cart. Players, many of whom chose South Carolina to play for him, also noticed his departure in other ways. “In the meeting room, he has his own little chair, and it was still there,” said junior linebacker T.J. Holloman. “We were all just looking at each other like, ‘Wow. That chair’s still there, and he’s not there.’ It just hit us hard.” Spurrier had intimated in a team meeting Monday night that his resignation was forthcoming, and players received confirmation of that fact a short while later via a text message from Elliott. “I was kind of shocked,” said senior offensive tackle Brandon Shell, a Goose Creek native. “I was like, ‘What? This is crazy. This can’t be true.’” Added Matulis: “It was definitely a shock. It was a lot to kind of take in at that time, especially at midseason. But he did what he felt was necessary, and I absolutely respect his decision in every way.” Spurrier had been mulling retirement for two weeks, he said, and had told athletics director Ray Tanner on the day after Saturday’s loss at No. 6 LSU of his intention to step down. But his assistant coaches were still caught off-guard. “I don’t know if anything is a complete shock in this business,” said co-defensive coordinator Lorenzo Ward. But “it was surprising that we’d have no idea. But he has the right to go out he way he wants to go out.” The Gamecocks are off to their first 0-4 start in SEC play since the 0-11 season of 1999, and need to win four of their final six games — a stretch which includes three top-nine opponents — to avoid the program’s first losing season since 2003. Now they face the task of refocusing in time to play Vanderbilt (2-3, 0-3) Saturday at 4 p.m. “It’s really about us now,” Holloman said. “We have to come together as a team, as a group, and show that we can handle big challenges like this. A head coach leaving is a big deal. Most teams split up, and most teams divide. But it’s on us to show that we can stick together and turn the season around.” Matulis said the first practice under Elliott was a good sign. “Today was one of the smoothest practices we’ve had in a while,” he said Tuesday evening. “I felt like it was fast-paced, we were hitting hard. Everybody was moving, everybody was listening well. I really, really enjoyed today.” Extra points — All three USC quarterbacks are back working in practice. Lorenzo Nunez, held out of the LSU game due to a sprained throwing shoulder, was back at practice Tuesday. So was Connor Mitch, who has been out four weeks with a separated throwing shoulder. Perry Orth is listed as the Gamecocks’ starter for Vanderbilt, but that decision had been made by Spurrier before his departure. — ESPN’s “SportsCenter” program will originate from the USC campus on Saturday morning prior to the Vanderbilt game. The show will broadcast from the Horseshoe from 7-9 a.m., leading into “College GameDay,” which is in Ann Arbor, Mich., this week. The USC-Vanderbilt game will be televised by SEC Network.
