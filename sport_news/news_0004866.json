I think we’re doing something really special with our business (TB12).”\nOn Friday, Boston Magazine revealed Guerrero was sued by the government in 2004 for claiming he was a doctor and advertising and selling an alleged cure for terminal illnesses called “Supreme Greens.”\nGuerrero paid a $65,000 fine and was barred by the FTC from ever referring to himself as a doctor and promoting “Supreme Greens” or “any substantially similar product.”\nBrady has been open about how much he relies on Guerrero as his body coach and touts his guidance as a key in keeping the Pats quarterback durable.\n“So much of what we talk about, Alex and I, is prevention. It’s probably a lot different than most of the Western medicine. . . . I’d say in professional sports, or in any sport in general, you kind of just play the game until you basically get hurt. Then you go to rehab and then you try to come back and you try to play your sport again. And I think so much for me and what we try to accomplish with what my regimen is . . . do things proactively so that you can avoid getting injured.”\nBrady cited his ability to withstand a hard hit in the back Sunday in Dallas as evidence of Guerrero’s work paying off.\n“That’s all about injury prevention. And a lot of times you’ve got to pay the price in advance for that,” he said.\nAs for Guerrero’s history detailed in the Boston Magazine article, Brady said he only knew bits and pieces.\n“I didn’t read the whole story, I didn’t read the whole transcript (of the FTC testimony),” Brady said.\n“I know what I’ve spoken (about) with Alex over the years, and I have tremendous belief with Alex and what he’s accomplished with me. In the 10 or 11 years we’ve been working together, he has never been wrong.\n“I had doctors with the highest and best education in our country tell us — tell me — that I wouldn’t be able to play football again (after his 2008 ACL injury), that I would need multiple surgeries on my knee from my staph infection, that I would need a new ACL, a new MCL, that I wouldn’t be able to play with my kids when I’m older. Of course, I go back the next year and we win Comeback Player of the Year. I follow the next season and win MVP.”\nBrady doubled down and endorsed Guerrero’s methods as superior to “Western medicine.” He claimed the country has been “lied to.”\n“The (way food in America is set up is) very different,” he said. “They have a food pyramid. I disagree with that. I disagree with a lot of things that people tell you to do. You’ll probably go out and drink Coca-Cola and think, ‘Oh yeah, that’s no problem.’ Why? Because they pay lots of money for advertisements to think that you should drink Coca-Cola for a living? No, I totally disagree with that. And when people do that, I think that’s quackery. And the fact that they can sell that to kids? I mean, that’s poison for kids. But they keep doing it.\nGuerrero, who now markets NeuroSafe, which claims to help treat concussions, is also a business partner with Brady. The QB explained why he’s confident selling products with Guerrero.\n“What I’m trying to provide for athletes and for people and all the clients that we have that come in is a different way of thinking,” he said. “You need to think differently if you want to sustain what, for me, is my peak performance, the very best that I can achieve as an athlete every day. And I learned that a long time ago.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T10:50:45.997+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
