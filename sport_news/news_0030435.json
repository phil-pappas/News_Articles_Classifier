By Kim Wade What do you get when you cook 1,500 pounds of Georgia shrimp, 3,000 ears of sweet Georgia corn, 1,100 pounds of sausage, 100 pounds of Vidalia onions, 30 pounds of butter and 150 pounds of spices?\nIf the Tourism Leadership Council has their way, it will be the record-setting World’s Largest Lowcountry Boil.\nTLC, the organizers of the Savannah Food and Wine Festival, will host the World’s Largest Lowcountry Boil from 4:30-7 p.m. Nov. 7 on Hutchinson Island’s Riverfront Esplanade. Tickets are $25 and can be purchased online at savannahfoodandwinefest.com.\nThe big party is a pre-Savannah Food and Wine Festival event set for the same day as the Savannah Rock ’n’ Roll Marathon, so the two groups are teaming up to bring as many hungry folks across the river to help set the record.\nAccording to TLC president Michael Owens, the new event is a way to show the world “who we are.”\n“It has a lot to do with our identity,” Owens explained. “So many places have a food culture … that points to who they are. So, what’s our dish?\n“…When more than 50 people come to our house, we do a Lowcountry boil. … We stand around peeling shrimp, crack open a few beers and spend the day laughing and talking. That to me is Savannah. That is very much who we are.\n“It’s about friends, family and neighbors. We throw newspapers on the table and everyone is shelling shrimp… and having fun. It’s about the perfect afternoon … and our community coming together.\n“A big part of who we are as a culture is being welcoming and friendly and sharing a lot of laughs around a dish that we can create uniquely.”\nOwens said every product used for the Lowcountry boil is a Georgia product — from the corn to the Vidalia onions and, of course, fresh shrimp.\nAnd it’s the poundage of that shrimp that will set the record. According to Owens, the current record is 1,300 pounds of shrimp and the Savannah event will use 1,500 pounds. Capt. Randy Cuthrell of BD Judge Seafood will be in charge of getting the shrimp. He’s a veteran at planning large Lowcountry boils.\nPart of knowing how to do this right means knowing what ingredients to add, which is why the potatoes (they get too mushy in the larger boils) will be a part of the All You Can Eat Fixins’ Side Bar, which includes 10 pounds of potato salad, 15 pounds of coleslaw, 3,000 rolls and four super-large chocolate sheet cakes.\nA cash bar is available with beer choices from Blue Point Brewery along with wine and Coca-Cola products.\nAnd Owens feels this is one of the most approachable events Savannah Food and Wine Festival will host this year.\n“Food and wine is not allocated to just people wearing ties and ascots… It’s also about being casual, wearing jeans … and having a beer.\n“You don’t need to be a wine expert; you just need to get your hands dirty when you’re peeling shrimp.\n“One of the biggest differences in our festival from other cities … is how much fun we have. In Savannah, you see big smiles and a lot of laughing, that’s the festival we wanted to build and this event goes perfectly with that.\n“No matter who is in town that weekend, they are invited. It’s a y’all-come-down-and-get-some-shrimp event.”\nThe Savannah Food and Wine Festival takes place Nov. 9-15 and features world class dinners, classes and wine tastings.
