The DMV says 11 people have been killed on motorcycles so far this season. That's up two fatalities from Vermont's yearly average, and a tragic reminder of the importance of road safety.\n\"One of the best ways you can keep yourself safe is to take a motorcycle safety course,\" McManamon said.\nMcManamon says there are many ways bikers can help protect themselves:\nAlways have multiple escape routes Wear a helmet and protective gear Make yourself seen with lights and bright clothing Know your limits and the roads limits People driving cars also carry a responsibility. McManamon says you should actively look for motorcycles and give them space.\n\"Don't encroach on them, don't cut them off, don't come up onto their back. Motorcycles can stop a lot quicker than a car can, so don't tailgate them,\" he advised.\nEven motorcyclists have blind spots. Everyone, he says, needs to have a 360-degree awareness and recognize the vast majority of bikers are riding safely.\n\"There are irresponsible riders out there, I won't deny that,\" McManamon said. \"They speed, they drive aggressively and they go to the limits.\"\nAccidents happen, but McManamon says it's responsible bikers and attentive drivers who help keep Vermonters alive.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T21:13:35.853+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
