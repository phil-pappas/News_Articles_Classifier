Wake Forest has turned in some special defensive performances in a couple of narrow victories. North Carolina has cranked up its offense. “Being in a close game for them doesn’t scare them,” North Carolina coach Larry Fedora said of the Demon Deacons, who last week survived in a 3-0 decision at Boston College. North Carolina is aiming for its first 2-0 ACC start since 1997. “I would say we’re playing smarter,” Fedora said. “I think some of it is our guys are a little bit older, a little bit more mature. They understand what needs to be done and they are making better decisions.” The Tar Heels have been cautious with some of the praise that has accompanied a four-game winning streak. “We haven’t accomplished anything,” linebacker Jeff Schoettmer said. Wake Forest is attempting to double its ACC victory total from a year ago. Fedora said Wake Forest appears prone to blitz more often than any previous opponent this season. “I love it when people blitz,” Tar Heels quarterback Marquise Williams said. “That will let you know if you’re a top-dog quarterback.” Williams said he has a good vibe about this game because it comes during fall break. Last year, the Tar Heels toppled visiting Georgia Tech during fall break. Wake Forest coach Dave Clawson said the Demon Deacons will be tested, in part, because North Carolina is a vastly different type of opponent than what they faced last week. “I think good football teams are able to win all types of games,” Clawson said. “Last week we went against the best defense in the country and this week we are going against one of the best offenses in the ACC and one of the best offenses in the country.” Clawson has declined to reveal the Demon Deacons’ quarterback plans for Saturday night. John Wolford started the first three games before an ankle injury, then Kendall Hinton was used until sitting out last week with a hip pointer.
