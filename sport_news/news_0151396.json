Jay Inslee remembered the victims.\n“We have all been touched by the tragedy. These children are ours no matter what country they are from,” he said.\nThe company voluntarily suspended tours and Thursday agreed with the state Utilities and Transportation Commission to stay off the road while the UTC investigates safety companywide.\nThat means not just inspecting the vehicles but also looking into the way they are operated by just one driver playing a dual role.\n“The drivers of your vehicles not only have to drive the vehicles but they have to entertain the passengers. And is that too much to ask given the complexity of the vehicles?” asked commission chair David Danner.\nIf the commission says the tours can resume safely, the owner says Ducks will no longer use the narrow lanes on the Aurora Bridge.\n“His trucks will not be using the Aurora Bridge. They will be using a different route,” said Pat Buchannan, a lawyer representing Ride the Ducks Seattle.\nWhile the commission has said it may be able to complete the safety investigation in 30 days, both sides agreed that there is no time limit.\ncomment (1)", "external_links": ["http://w.sharethis.com/button/buttons.js"], "published": "2015-10-02T07:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T14:12:25.098+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
