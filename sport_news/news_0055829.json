Walker reporting from Nashville, Tenn.\n___\n9:15 a.m.\nJacksonville Jaguars tight end Julius Thomas is expected to make his season debut at Tampa Bay.\nThe team says Thomas is \"likely\" to play against the Buccaneers (1-3) on Sunday.\nThomas practiced this week without a cast for the first time since breaking his right hand in the preseason opener Aug. 14. He had surgery Sept. 2.\nThomas caught 108 passes and 24 touchdowns the last two years in Denver. He signed a five-year, $46 million contract with Jacksonville in free agency in March.\nThe Jaguars (1-3) expect Thomas, when fully healthy, to be a significant part of the passing game. They need a proven playmaker to help take some pressure off second-year receivers Allen Robinson and Allen Hurns.\n___\nAP NFL websites: http://pro32.ap.org and http://twitter.com/AP_NFL", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/AP_NFL"], "published": "2015-10-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T20:39:13.252+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
