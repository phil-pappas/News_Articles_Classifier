Kind of takes you out of the immersion of the character at that time when he's coming out like Kane does now without the entrance theme lead up to the pyro. # 2 Mercury112491 @ 09/30/15 10:20 AM So current era Masked Kane isn't in # 3 redsox4evur @ 09/30/15 10:21 AM Quote: Originally Posted by Mercury112491 So current era Masked Kane isn't in You mean the one that just debuted just over a week ago?

However the costume he \"re-debuted\" as is the same one he's been wearing the last few years with his mask. It's not totally unreasonable to wonder if that costume, one they've had in the game before, would be included as an alternate attire. # 5 redsox4evur @ 09/30/15 10:30 AM Quote: Originally Posted by Mercury112491 I'm well aware of the cut off dates and how it generally works.

I just started getting into wrestling since right after Battleground. So I figured this was a whole new attire they were using for Kane. So you are correct that if it was in the game before it's not that unreasonable. But I can still see it being too late to get it in the game. Because who's to say that the WWE would use that attire for him and the game going gold in about a week or so. And I read on either here or the 2K forums that takes the team about 2 months to get a wrestler perfectly correct. # 6 Bard @ 09/30/15 11:30 AM Yeah! My favorite Kane is in finally, 2001 time frame.

It was even in last years game. # 8 jaredsmith83 @ 09/30/15 03:40 PM I'd imagine that you should be able to edit him to get that attire. With 100 CAW spots, its not like we have to pick and choose as much as we did last year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T17:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T00:24:00.837+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
