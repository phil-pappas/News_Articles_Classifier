I screwed up,” Lowndes said. \n“I wanted to make amends for Richo. \n“Richo is one of those quiet achievers. \n“He goes under the radar but he did everything we needed.” \nThe Richards family now boast 11 Bathurst wins, a tally still dominated by his famous father Jim – for now. \nRichards said he hoped to continue his veteran combination with 41-year-old Lowndes at next year’s Bathurst. \n“We make a pretty good team,” he said after their win from 15th spot on the starting grid. \n“But I am pretty humbled to be honest. \n“I am just a very small cog in a big wheel.” \nBut it seems fans should not hold their breath for the next generation of Richards drivers at Bathurst. \nRichards admitted his children were not quite in the mood to follow their father’s footsteps. \nHe revealed his children were “filthy” with him after he decided they shouldn’t attend Bathurst this year. \nThe last time he made that call was in 2013, when he conquered the mountain with Ford’s Winterbottom. \n“I am in a lot of trouble because in 2013 when I won with Frosty (Winterbottom) we didn’t bring the kids up,” Richards said. \n“And this year the school holidays didn’t quite fall in the right area so they stayed at home. \n“They are absolutely dirty on me.” \nRichards and Lowndes will combine again in V8 Supercars’ next round, the Gold Coast 600 enduro starting on October 23.
