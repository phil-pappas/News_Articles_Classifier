Someone called the couple and said their grandchild failed to buy rental insurance on a car they had rented and were in an auto accident. The caller said someone needed to post a cash deposit to cover the cost of the damages to the car they rented, a Sonora Police Department press release stated. \nThe victims were told if they didn’t deposit the money their grandchild would be incarcerated and not allowed to leave the country until the funds were deposited. \nWhen the phone-scammers are from another country, they are often not caught or prosecuted, the police said. \nNeither victim attempted to contact their grandchild to confirm what the officials had said, and learned it was a scam after wiring the money to the scammer’s accounts. \nSonora Police officers warned residents to beware of phone scams that are active within the county. \nSpeaking with a friend or relative to verify information regarding the alleged scam is an important tactic to avoid being taken advantage of. Another way is to call local law enforcement officials and speak with them, stated the release. \n“Whatever you do, speak with someone before sending money to a person in another country who you don’t know,” the release stated.
