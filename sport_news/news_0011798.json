The Cameroonian will now attempt to guide the organization through strict reforms, ahead of next year's election to find a permanent successor to long-time President Sepp Blatter.Hayatou has taken over as interim boss from Blatter, who was suspended last week for 90 days by FIFA's Ethics Committee, along with Secretary-General Jerome Valcke and UEFA President Michel Platini, pending a full investigation. \nHayatou has addressed staff, and met with acting Secretary-General Markus Kattner to discuss administrative matters. \nHe recognizes that it's an unprecedented situation for FIFA, but pledges to remain focused on the necessary reform process, the Presidential Election, and supporting the current investigations. \nThe 69-year-old Confederation of African Football President will remain in Zurich until next week, and he's scheduled to head up an Extraordinary Executive Meeting on Tuesday. \n\"Having spent 28 years here now, I think I know enough about how football works. We can now take the opportunity to move forward, with all the people who are in position here, because this is not a job that the president can do all on his own. There are committees here and there are partners too, and my job is to galvanise all of them so that we can work together to achieve the organisation's objectives,\" he said.
