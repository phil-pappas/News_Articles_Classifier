He has a penetrating kick and loves to take the game on. He also showed earlier in the year that he can stand up on the big stage,” Crows head of football David Noble said. \n“Paul wants to get better and we think he can develop into a consistent and damaging player.” \nA series of draft picks also changed hands. \nPort Adelaide grabbed Toumpas and draft pick No.32 in exchange for picks No.29, No.50 and No.68. \nSeedsman, who won this year’s Anzac medal, came to the Crows at the cost of pick No.32. \nCollingwood said farewell to Seedsman and Kennedy, gaining pick No.68 and Howe as compensation. \nIn addition to Kennedy, Melbourne picked up selections No.29 and No.50 in exchange for Howe and Toumpas. \nMeanwhile, ruckman Jonathan Giles has joined his third AFL club after being starved of opportunity at Essendon. \nGiles joined the Bombers after the 2014 season, having played 51 games with Greater Western Sydney. \nHowever, he managed only three matches in Essendon’s disastrous 2015 campaign. \nThe Eagles offloaded pick No.57 in exchange for Giles and pick No.62.
