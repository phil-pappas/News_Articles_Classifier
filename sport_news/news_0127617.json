The colt is named for Jonathan Toews, captain of the Stanley Cup champion Chicago Blackhawks . He is trained by Bob Baffert and co-owned by Mike Pegram, a friend of Hawks coach Joel Quenneville. \nStreet Vision returned $2.80 and $2.10, while Blameitonthelaw was another 3 3/4 lengths back in third and paid $2.10 to show. \nEspinoza replaced Toews On Ice's regular rider Martin Garcia, who rode Pretty N Cool to victory in the Grade 2 Matron Stakes at Belmont Park in New York. Baffert also trains Pretty N Cool. \n\"I had a good outside post and he broke in front,\" said Espinoza, who drove to the lead leaving the quarter pole. \"He did things easily. He's still learning and some horses need one or two races to really focus and he's one of those.\" \nThe victory, worth $42,900, increased Toews On Ice's career earnings to $115,200, with two wins in four starts. \n\"He's still a little green, still wanting to run on his left lead,\" said Jim Barnes, Baffert's assistant, \"but he's moving forward and I'm sure we have big things to come.\" \nAll content copyright ©2015 Pendleton Times-Post, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T02:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T03:53:50.229+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
