Norm Wood Contact Reporter nwood@dailypress.com Taquan Mizzell sees #UVA's poor running game as \"work in progress\" going up against Pitt's stout defense \nVirginia's Taquan Mizzell had the chance to be a regular, remote-control hogging college football fan last weekend, but there was a serious scouting mission involved. It was the end of U.Va.'s second preseason. \nThat's the attitude U.Va. (1-3, 0-0 Atlantic Coast Conference) has adopted heading into its ACC opener Saturday at Pittsburgh. Mizzell and some fellow U.Va. running backs stayed on campus last weekend during U.Va.'s off week, had an informal workout with teammates, picked up a giant order of chicken wings and watched the Pittsburgh-Virginia Tech game together. \nThe viewing party was part curiosity and part opportunity to break down upcoming Coastal Division opponents. After struggling through its relentless non-conference schedule, including an embarrassing 56-14 loss to Boise State on Sept. 25 at home in its last game, U.Va. is trying the rebirth approach as ACC play begins and pressure mounts on coach Mike London. \n\"This is a big game for us,\" said Mizzell, who leads all Football Bowl Subdivision running backs in receptions per game (5.5; 22 catches this season) and receiving yards per game (73; 292 for the season). \"We're 0-0 in conference play. That's all we're thinking about now. The games that we had, we learned from them. We watched film, you know, got better from those games, but it's 0-0 right now. \n\"We feel like all our games in the ACC are winnable.\" \nWhat Mizzell saw in Pittsburgh's 17-13 win at Tech made an impression. Pittsburgh (3-1, 1-0) had seven sacks, and held Tech to 100 yards, including 9 yards rushing. \nThe 2015 Virginia football season in pictures. \nIt was a defensive effort befitting a team that's fourth in the nation out of 127 FBS programs in total defense (243.8 yards per game) and rushing defense (71.3 yards per game). Not exactly the most encouraging matchup for a U.Va. offense that's 122nd in the nation in rushing offense (93.8 yards per game; has failed to run for more 98 yards against two of three FBS opponents). \n\"It's a work in progress right now,\" said Mizzell of U.Va.'s running attack, which he leads with 157 yards. \"We're still getting some (offensive linemen and wide receivers) healthy, just improving each week. It's still a work in progress, but we feel confident about it still.\" \nU.Va. has surrendered seven sacks, which is largely because of quarterback Matt Johns' mobility. Boise State often had to employ just a three-man rush to get pressure on Johns, who tossed three of the six interceptions he's thrown this season against the Broncos. \nWhile Mizzell has been one of U.Va.'s primary offensive catalysts in the passing game, Pittsburgh boasts the most productive receiver in the ACC in Tyler Boyd. In just three games, and with Pittsburgh often rotating Nate Peterman and the shifty Chad Voytik at quarterback, Boyd is tied for the conference lead with 26 catches that have gone for 274 yards and a touchdown. \nU.Va., which had to hold on to defeat Pittsburgh 24-19 last season in Charlottesville after leading the Panthers 24-3 in the third quarter, should be better equipped to try to slow down Boyd with the return of cornerback Demetrious Nicholson. He sat out the Boise State game with a concussion. \nPittsburgh has successfully moved on without reigning ACC player of the year James Conner, who suffered a season-ending knee injury in the opener against Youngstown State. \nRedshirt freshman Qadree Ollison, who had 122 rushing yards against Tech's reeling defense, has helped ease the running back transition from Conner. Ollison is second in the ACC with 106.8 rushing yards per game (427 yards and three touchdowns for the season). \nU.Va. is last in the nation in turnover margin per game (minus-2.25) and has yet to log its first takeaway. Pittsburgh has turned the ball over six times, which is middle of the pack in the ACC. \nAfter its slow start, U.Va. is confronted with the reality of having to compile at minimum a 5-3 mark in ACC play just to be bowl-eligible. U.Va.'s players still believe it's a realistic goal. \n\"As of right now, I feel like the guys are much more locked in,\" U.Va. right tackle Eric Smith said. \"We're playing (teams) in our conference who are really going to have an impact on our season and what we can do (in the postseason) and whether we can (get to the postseason). \n\"We've played some of the best teams â€¦ so, we're not down at all. We're not moping around.\" \nWood can be reached by phone at 757-247-4642.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T02:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T03:34:12.796+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
