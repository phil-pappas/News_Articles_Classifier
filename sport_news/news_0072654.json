I grew up in Tampa, so I eviscerated my hometown — which, by the way, is a truly terrible place — and was banned for life from entering the state of Florida. (That wasn't the only positive outcome. The Blackhawks also won the series. You’re welcome, Chicago.)\nNow I did actually live in St. Louis for a summer — I was interning at one of the local dung factories — but I will not stoop to writing another slam piece just to inflame Cardinals fans and fire up my fellow Chicagoans.\nInstead, I’ll help Cubs fans prepare for the National League Division Series, which starts this evening in Missouri, by providing some straight-forward and in-no-way-totally-fabricated facts about St. Louis:\nThe city is on the banks of the Mississippi River, built on a land mass of accumulated waste that drifted downriver from the Chicago stockyards in the late 1800s. Founded by a French conman named Gerard Flatuleau, the city was first named “Horribles Ville des Ordures,” which translates to Horrible Garbage City.\nAnother Cubs turnaround artist gives Chicago reason for hope David Rapp A baseball mastermind comes to Chicago with a mission to deliver a city from its ignominy. He brings a track record of success from Boston, where he orchestrated multiple championships in a city equally starved for victory before he turned Cub history on its head.\nThe brainy impresario recruits...\nA baseball mastermind comes to Chicago with a mission to deliver a city from its ignominy. He brings a track record of success from Boston, where he orchestrated multiple championships in a city equally starved for victory before he turned Cub history on its head.\nThe brainy impresario recruits...\n(David Rapp) Federal officials immediately saw the budding city’s potential and purchased the land from Flatuleau, turning Horribles Ville des Ordures into a penal colony for the criminally depraved. The first warden was named John Louis, and one of his first acts was to rename the city “St. Louis.” (Louis was known for holding himself in very high regard and for being a complete idiot.)\nFor another decade, criminals made up the majority of the population of St. Louis, earning it the still-popular nickname, “the Australia of the Midwest.” Eventually the city’s criminal residents settled down and started families, largely out of boredom, and St. Louis became a booming town known for its pickpocketing and animal prostitution rings.\nWith the help of German immigrant Adolphus Busch, St. Louis soon became famous for ruining beer and the city started offering free tours of the Anheuser-Busch Brewery to veterans whose taste buds had been shot off during World War I.\nAs St. Louis continued to grow and more westward-bound settlers passed through, a towering arch was built. Residents believed the arch was a symbol of the city’s status as a “Gateway to the West,” but the out-of-state architect who built the arch said it was intended to help visitors quickly find their way out of the city, or to warn passersby to steer clear entirely.\nOne of the city’s biggest claims to fame is St. Louis-style pizza, which has been described as “slightly worse than putting ketchup on a Saltine” and “this isn’t pizza.” The inventor of St. Louis-style pizza — Gusto Contestabile — was born without depth perception, possibly explaining the absurdly thin crust of his creation.\nTo keep the crust from disintegrating and floating into the air, Contestabile created a gooey cheese called Provel, which is Italian for “goat barf.” The Provel-topped, cracker-like pizza is traditionally served with a Budweiser in the hopes that the beer will keep you from tasting the awful pizza while the pizza keeps you from tasting the awful beer.\nCentral to all life in St. Louis — along with scabies — is the city’s beloved baseball team. The Cardinals started out as a prison team called the Insidious Trouser Farts.\nIn 1900, team owner Chris von der Ahe decided to change the name of the team to something more inspiring. No one who lived there had ever actually seen a bird — they tended to stay away because of the unbearable stench — but someone in the organization had once read about a cardinal, a red-feathered creature renowned for its beauty, despite its limited mental capacity and lack of self-awareness.\nThe Cardinals were born and have remained a source of great pride for the people of St. Louis, winning 11 World Series championships and distracting fans from the fact that they descended from criminals and still live atop a pile of fetid hog waste.\nThat should be enough of a primer on St. Louis to carry Cubs fans through the coming series. I have to say, it feels good to take the high road and not cast aspersions on our Missouri-based opponents.\nGood luck, Cubs players. Remember, if anyone down there offers you pizza, run for the arch. It’s the quickest way out of town.\nrhuppke@tribpub.com\nCopyright © 2015, Chicago Tribune St. Louis Cardinals Chicago Cubs Chicago Blackhawks Tampa Bay Lightning Stanley Cup Playoffs National League", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-5617c419/turbine/ct-cubs-cardinals-huppke-20151008", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-5616c0e7/turbine/ct-cubs-epstein-tinker-evers-chance-baseball-perspec-1009-jm-20151008"], "published": "2015-10-09T16:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T18:36:49.638+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
