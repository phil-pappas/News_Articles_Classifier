And you have Dante Exum, who would have been the starter had he not torn his ACL during the summer. And you have General Manager Dennis Lindsey saying emphatically that production at this position needs to improve.\nThis is who the Jazz are at the point guard spot. It's a team trying to make the playoffs with question marks at perhaps the most collectively talented spot the NBA has to offer. Burke will be the starter and Neto the backup. They are the only two true point guards on the roster, since the Jazz cut Bryce Cotton this last week.\n  And this puts Burke's ability to produce under a microscope.\n\"My job is to do what my team needs me to do: Show up and work hard every day,\" Burke said. \"I have to work hard to become a better player. I don't pay attention to the criticism, because if I do that, I'm focusing on the wrong thing. I have to focus on what I can control.\"\nBurke has performed well during the preseason. He hung 22 points on Damian Lillard and the Portland Trail Blazers a week ago. He came back with 20 points, four assists and three rebounds against Russell Westbrook and the Oklahoma City Thunder on Tuesday. He's shooting the ball better than he has previously in his career. And he's said the game is slowing down for him in his third season out of Michigan.\nBut Burke knows he's going to have to play at a high level on a consistent basis for the Jazz to be a contending team this season. In cutting Cotton, the Jazz showed confidence in Burke and Neto to get the job done. Neto has had his moments in the preseason, showing off adroit passing skills and the ability to be a pest defensively.\nAt the same time, Utah's point guard position remains under the watchful eye of the front office. Lindsey has said he wouldn't hesitate to bring in veteran help if he thinks the position needs it. And as a team with playoff aspirations, the Jazz have the assets — they are $7 million under the salary cap — to make a move, if they so desire.\nUtah also is committed to its three-wing offense of Rodney Hood, Gordon Hayward and Alec Burks. Those three are good enough to be primary ballhandlers and good enough to run Quin Snyder's offense. So while Burke and Neto are the two true point guards on the roster, the Jazz are putting faith in their wings to help with the load.\n\"Trey's had a good preseason,\" Snyder said. \"He's been focused on defending, and he's had good energy. We're still trying to figure out the best way to utilize our guys. But I've liked what I've seen from Trey this preseason.\"\n\ntjones@sltrib.com \ntwitter: @tjonessltrib", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T07:50:46.225+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
