But Julia Gomes put the visitors in front with three minutes remaining to leave both sides with a share of the spoils. \nBlack Sticks striker Olivia Merry, playing her 100th international, described both her personal milestone and the fortunes of her team as \"bitter-sweet\". \n\"Playing your 100th in front of a sold-out Christchurch home crowd is an absolutely awesome feeling, but to not come away with the win is gut-wrenching,\" she said. \"We didn't come out firing in the second quarter and, once Argentina went 1-0 up, they are very skilful side and they had the confidence.\" \nThat goal arrived for Argentina after a pair of penalty corner opportunities, with Noel Barrionuevo eventually making the most of the chance to slot past goalkeeper Amelia Gibson. \nThe Black Sticks initially struggled to respond to the setback but, when the tempo was raised in the second half and numerous penalty corners arrived, Kat Henry eventually found the equaliser in the 50th minute. \nBoth teams fought hard to find the winning goal as the clock counted down but it was Julia Gomes who spoiled the home side's party, converting a penalty corner with three minutes left to secure the win and leave the series square. \nBoth teams will now head to Taranaki for the Oceania Cup, with Australia, Samoa and Fiji also set to compete.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T19:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T00:43:06.250+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
