Friday night the Royals beat the Blue Jays 4-3 ( box score ) in Game 6 of the ALCS to clinch the AL pennant. They won the best-of-seven series four games to two. \nThe Royals will take on the Mets in the 2015 World Series, which doesn't begin until next Tuesday. The Fall Classic will begin in Kansas City because the AL won the All-Star Game back in July. Here are a dozen things to know about Game 6 of the ALCS. \n1. The 2-1 call to Revere changed EVERYTHING ... \nLet's skip to the top of the ninth: the Blue Jays, trailing 4-3, had the game-tying run on third base with no outs. Russell Martin started the inning with a single, then pinch-runner Dalton Pompey stole second and third. \nWade Davis rebounded to strike out Dioner Navarro for the first out, then, with Ben Revere staring at a 2-1 count, Davis got a gift call from home plate up Jeff Nelson to even the count 2-2. Here's the strike zone plot via Brooks Baseball : \nThat is from the catcher's perspective. Pitch No. 4 is the pitch in question. It's clearly off the plate and it changed the at-bat dramatically. Revere should have had a 3-1 count. Instead it was a 2-2 count. Huge difference. Davis struck him out for the second out, then Josh Donaldson grounded out to end the ALCS. \n2. ... but it's not the reason the Blue Jays lost either. \nNelson's call on the 2-1 pitch to Revere was very bad and it hurt the Blue Jays big time. It's also not the reason they lost. They had the tying run at third base with no outs, so they had three chances to get him in, and they failed all three times. Also, Toronto went 0 for 12 with runners in scoring positionin Game 6. 0 for 12! They had chances earlier in the game in addition to that ninth inning. Nelson's call was bad. The Blue Jays' situational hitting was way worse. \n3. The rain delay came at a bad time for the Royals. \nGame 6 was interrupted by a 45-minute rain delay between the top and bottom of the eighth inning. Royals skipper Ned Yost acknowledged the rain affected his bullpen usage. Here's what he told Erin Andrews during an interview with Fox Sports 1 during the rain delay: \n\"They hit it pretty well on the nose. They said it was going to come down at about 9:55 to 10 o'clock and it would last about 10:15 to 10:20. They said it was a small cell and it should pass quick.\" \n\"We'll see how long it takes. Wade's upstairs staying loose. You know, this is what I was kind of hoping to stay away from, getting Wade in the ballgame and then raining, but, you know, it was at a point where we had to do it, so Wade will come in. He's upstairs. Got a heat wrap on his arm in the weight room staying loose.\" \nRather than go to Davis for a six-out save, Yost went to Ryan Madson to face the top of the order in the eighth, and Madson allowed the game-tying two-run home run to Jose Bautista . It wasn't a terrible pitch either -- a fastball up and out of the zone. Bautista turned it around in a hurry though ( video ): \nSo rather than go to Davis for the six-out save -- Davis closed out Game 4 of the ALDS with a six-out save, and he hadn't pitched since Saturday, so he was well-rested -- Yost went to Madson because he didn't want to lose Davis during a rain delay. In the end, Madson blew the lead and Yost ended up using Davis n the inning anyway. \nOf course, it didn't matter in the end. The Royals took the lead immediately after the rain delay and Davis remained in the game to close it out anyway. He wasn't particularly sharp in that ninth inning but still got the job done. \n3a. Also, this is noteworthy. Bautista did stuff a Blue Jays player had never done before in October: \nAlso, if you haven't already heard, Jose Bautista is the first Blue Jay ever to hit 2HR in one playoff game & 4HR in a single postseason. — Brendan Kennedy @BKennedyStar) October 24, 2015 \nBautista had a monster postseason. He went 12 for 41 (.293) with four home runs, 3 RBI and more walks (eight) than strikeouts (seven) in 11 playoff games. \n4. Bautista goes from G.O.A.T. to goat. \nThat said, Bautista made an ill-advised throw on Eric Hosmer 's single in the eighth inning, allowing Lorenzo Cain to score what proved to be the game-winning run all the way from first. Hosmer ripped a single to right, Bautista ran it down, spun around and threw blindly towards second base, and Cain took advantage. Bautista didn't necessarily miss the cutoff man, he threw to the wrong base entirely. He's got to get the ball to the cutoff man near first base for the best chance to get Cain at the plate. His throw went to the second base bag and that opened the door for Cain to score. The play at the plate wasn't even close. \n5. The Royals hit Price really hard in the first few innings. \nThe Royals jumped on David Price for two home runs in the first two innings -- Ben Zobrist hit a solo shot in the first, and Mike Moustakas hit a controversial solo shot in the second. Both ball were well-struck, obviously. There's also this: \nThe Royals did not hit multiple HRs by the end of the 2nd in a home game all year. Zobrist and Moustakas have already homered in Game 6. — ESPN Stats & Info @ESPNStatsInfo) October 24, 2015 \nEarly on every ball in play was well-struck against Price. Statcast does not make exit velocity available for every ball in play live during the game, so here's the data we have for the first time through Kansas City's order: Alcides Escobar ground out: 101 mphBen Zobrist home run: 100 mphLorenzo Cain ground out: no reading", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T09:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T09:19:07.623+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
