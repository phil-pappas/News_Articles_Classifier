He was in ICU on Friday. \nDoctors fear the infection might spread into his bone, and from there could further spread via the bloodstream. \nThe Giants consulted with disease specialists before scrubbing their player facilities. \nFells, 32, is in his eighth NFL season. He caught six passes for 60 yards in New York’s first two games last month. \nMORE LIKE JOSHY FOOTBALL \nFor a livin’ fact, Josh McCown is the best quarterback on the Cleveland Browns roster. There’s no doubting it now. \nJohnny Football? Yeah, forget about Johnny Manziel. The Browns are in good hands with their old guy. \nJoshy Football, if you will. \nIn dramatic fashion on Sunday, McCown engineered a 33-30 overtime win in Baltimore -- and looked great in doing so, against a suddenly horrific Ravens defence. \nCleveland improved to 2-3. Baltimore plopped to 1-4. \nMcCown proved once and for all that his head coach, Mike Pettine, was right all along for insisting since the spring that McCown gave the Browns the best chance to win this year. \nMcCown passed for 457 yards and two touchdowns on 36-of-51 throwing at M&T Bank Stadium. The 36-year-old also rushed for a score. \nMcCown broke the single-game Browns passing-yards record of 444 (set in 1981 by Brian Sipe), and he became the first quarterback in Browns history to pass for 300 yards in three successive games. \nThe majority of Browns fans, and many in the media, had been lobbying for Pettine to play Manziel over the greybeard McCown. \n“I never wrote me off,” McCown said. “The people in Cleveland never wrote me off. I respect the job that (the media) has to do, but I can’t let it affect me. \n“I think this will be a cool thing to look back at when my career is over. There are a lot of things that I want to be the first Browns quarterback to do. Those are all team goals. Everybody had a hand in making this a historic game.” \nMcCown rallied the Browns from 14-3 and 21-9 deficits, as the Ravens fought in vain to win at home for the first time this season. \nOn top of all that, McCown was “a little gimpy on the ankle” afterward, Pettine said afterward. “I’m sure it’s fine now. When the adrenaline goes away, we’ll evaluate it and see how it is \n“Josh made some huge throws.” \nIncluding a bunch to Browns tight end Gary Barnridge. He led all receivers with eight catches for 139 yards, including a crazy, lucky but savvy, between-the-legs, 18-yard touchdown lob that McCown calmly threw while backing up with a free blitzer up the middle about to pulverize him. \nTravis Coons kicked the winning 32-yard field goal with 6:43 left in OT. McCown had piloted the Browns 51 yards in 12 plays to set him up. \nBefore that, Cleveland’s defence forced Joe Flacco and the hot-and-cold Baltimore offence to go three-and-out at the start of overtime. \n“I talked to the guys,” Pettine said of his post-game speech to his players. “Sometimes you have wins that define things for you -- can define a season, or be a turning point. And we hope that was it for us. \n“That was truly a team win, hopefully a team-building win. That was one that was sorely needed -- and will be much enjoyed.” \nCOUSINS' HEROICS \nThrough four quarters, quarterback Kirk Cousins not only wasn’t a liability for his Washington Redskins, he generated nearly all of his team’s offence at undefeated Atlanta. \nAnd his passing heroics in the final 24 seconds of the fourth quarter sent the game into overtime. \nBut six plays into overtime, Cousins screwed up. Big time. \nFrom midfield, the fourth-year player made the terrible decision, under pressure, to throw a cross-field out pass to receiver Ryan Grant. \nCousins probably does not possess the arm strength, even if not backing up under duress, to safely make that throw. As it was, he didn’t get enough power behind the throw. It hung up. \nThen Grant stumbled. Atlanta cornerback Robert Alford easily jumped in front, picked it off, and coasted 59 yards down the sideline for the game-winning pick-six in a 25-19 Falcons victory. \nAtlanta remains unbeaten, at 5-0. Washington is 2-3. \nCousins otherwise played quite well. He was 21-of-32 for 219 yards. \nThose are impressive numbers, given that the Washington offence is predicated on run-game success, and the Redskins couldn’t run it a lick against Dan Quinn’s reworked Falcons defence: 51 yards on 24 carries. \n“I thought that was a real clear demonstration of our toughness, of our grit and a mindset to finish today,” Quinn said. “We’ve developed a lot of grit and toughness with our group, and they just won’t back off and stop competing.” \nAs for the Falcons offence, quarterback Matt Ryan had a tough day against Washington’s stout defence. He threw two interceptions and connected with star receiver Julio Jones only five times for 67 yards. \nBut Ryan piloted the Falcons 80 yards in 10 plays to give Atlanta a short-lived 19-16 lead with 24 seconds left. \nCousins then heroically completed passes of 20, 19 and seven yards to set up Dustin Hopkins for a game-tying 52-yard field goal, as time expired. \nAlford had earlier intercepted Cousins. \n“He had a bunch of pass breakups last week,” Quinn said. “We couldn’t be more thrilled for him.” \nDevonta Freeman again proved dynamic as a ball carrier for Atlanta. He ran 27 times for 153 yards and one touchdown -- his seventh of the season. \n“For us, that (run/pass) balance is really important,” Quinn said. \n“The fact that we’re able to run it and have success that way, it opens up so much of the play-action and the keepers that we like to feature, and the down-field throws.” Sponsored Links", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T02:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T02:39:02.074+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
