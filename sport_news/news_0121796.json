(excluding halftime)\nOver/Under: 2.5\nNBC play-by-play man Al Michaels got wind of this news and took it upon himself to make the bet go over.\nDuring a break in the action, Michaels said, “You know there’s an over/under out there on how many times we’ll say deflate tonight? Deflategate, Deflategate, Deflategate, Deflategate. Four. You won the over.”\nYou can watch the video here. \nAnd in case you were wondering if Bovada would still pay out on the bet after Michaels’ antics, wonder no more. FOXSports.com got confirmation Monday morning from Bovada that all “over” bets were paid out.\n  This article originally appeared on Fox Sports .\nFiled under al michaels ,  deflategate ,  gambling ,  new england patriots", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T18:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T00:45:10.596+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
