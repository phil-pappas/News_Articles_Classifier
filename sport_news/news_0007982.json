Mattie Hooper made five saves in the cage for the Mariners, while Hailey DeMascio made four saves in goal for the Hornets. \nOceanside was without starting defender Alexis Mazurek and goalie Lauren Hoppe, both nursing injuries. \nThe Mariners appear to be locked in the 10th and final playoff spot in Class B North and likely will travel to face No. 7 Nokomis of Newport in a prelim playoff game, probably on Saturday, Oct. 17. \nNokomis beat Oceanside 2-1 on Sept. 24 in Rockland. \nIn the Maine Principals' Association Heal Point Standings for Class B North, Oceanside (5-8-1, 27.0663 points) is 10th, while Gardiner (12-2, 134.0816 points) is first in the 14-team region. The top 10 teams qualify for the playoffs. \nCourier Publications' sports staff can be reached by email at sports@villagesoup.com or by phone at 594-4401.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T20:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T19:50:01.344+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
