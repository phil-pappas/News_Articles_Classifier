That's not great, of course, but if it's the kind of thing that happens just once, it's not that big a deal.\n\nThe latest from SportsLine Will the Ravens' pride show up in the desert? \n\nMallett didn't oversleep on Saturday when he missed the Texans' charter flight to Miami for their game against the Texans. This time, he had a different excuse.\n“I got caught in traffic,” Mallett said, per the Houston Chronicle . “Got to be on time. It's not the leadership role that I need to exhibit. So, I have to be better.”\nWhen asked why he's repeatedly late to team activities, Mallett replied: “It only happened twice.” Fair enough, Ryan. But that's probably two times too many.\nAs for how this latest incident will be handled, reporters went to Texans coach Bill O'Brien for answers. “Anything that has to do with Ryan Mallett, I can tell you right now, the way that will be answered by me is everything that we do as far as discipline or anything, personal problems, whatever it might be, is handled internally, in-house,” O'Brien said. “It's not for public consumption.”\nOur own Jason La Canfora says Mallett's days could be numbered in Houston after missing the Texans' charter.\nAs for Mallett, who is bordering on outright defiance and insubordination at this point, I'd have cut him already. If developmental QB Tom Savage wasn't on IR, that move may have happened. For more on the Texans, check out La Canfora's Monday Inside Football column .
