The University of New Hampshire hockey team has made a habit of falling behind this season. The Wildcats also keep coming back. They did it in their exhibition game and they did it again last week in their season opener against AIC. This time, however, they couldn’t finish it off. UNH rallied from a two-goal deficit Friday night by scoring twice in the final eight minutes of regulation to force overtime, but St. Lawrence scored midway through the extra period to skate away with a 3-2 win at the Whittemore Center. “Disappointing to lose it in overtime, especially with the way the guys battled back in the third period,” said UNH coach Dick Umile. “You battle back to tie it, you don’t want to lose it.” SLU’s Christian Horn ended it with 2:23 left in overtime on a hard wrist shot from the high slot. The Wildcats nearly won it in the first minute of OT, but SLU goalie Kyle Hayton, sliding from left to right, robbed Dan Correale, who was trying to finish an odd-man rush with Tyler Kelleher. “It was a nice pass to the shooter,” said SLU coach Greg Carvel. “From the bench (it looked like) he had a lot of net. Kyle gets over there so quickly. Side to side I can’t imagine anyone quicker than him.” With the Wildcats trailing 2-0, Jamie Hill scored a shorthanded goal with eight minutes left in the third period. They pulled even on a power-play goal by Maxim Gaudreault with 2:24 remaining in regulation on a nice feed from Kyle Smith. Gaudreault also set up Hill’s wraparound goal that made it 2-1 and jump-started the offense. “We battled hard,” Hill said. “It’s unfortunate it ended the way it did. The third period I thought we played well.” UNH (1-1) outshot St. Lawrence (3-0) in the third period, 10-3. The Saints outshot the Wildcats overall, 28-27. Hayton and UNH’s Danny Tirone each made 25 saves. Tirone had 13 stops in a scoreless second period to keep the Wildcats in the game. Slow starts have plagued the Wildcats the last two seasons. They will try to salvage a weekend split against ECAC opponents when they host Clarkson on Saturday night (7) before hitting the road for six consecutive games. “We were real confident,” Gaudreault said. “We had the momentum going. It’s kind of devastating to have it end like that.” The Wildcats fell behind 2-0 in the first period as the Saints scored on two of their first five shots. They struck less than a minute apart on goals by Gavin Bayreuther and Brian Ward. Bayreuther gave St. Lawrence a 1-0 lead at 10:39 if the first period when he scored on a high wrist shot from below the dot in the right circle after taking a nice feed from Ryan Lough, who did most of the work on the play. Ward made it 2-0 at 11:22 when he stuffed home the rebound of a Jacob Pritchard bid that hit the left post. That’s the way the first period ended. “We dug ourselves a hole early,” Gaudreault said. “We got the juice going toward the end. They capitalized on that last goal. It’s unfortunate. A missed opportunity for us.” The Wildcats still trailed by two after a scoreless second period as Tirone kept his team in the game by stopping all 13 shots he faced. St. Lawrence outshot UNH, 23-16, over the first two periods, including 13-7 in the second. UNH nearly scored early in the third period, but SLU’s Gavin Bayreuther, who was covering for his goalie, stopped Hill’s wraparound attempt at the 7:23 mark. However, Bayreuther was called for delay of game after he covered up the puck. Although the Wildcats failed to capitalize on the ensuing power play, Hill scored less than five minutes later shorthanded on a similar shot to get UNH back in the game. “We needed the next goal to give ourselves an opportunity,” Umile said. “Give them credit. They played hard in the third period.” By Al Pike", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T08:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T09:29:04.433+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
