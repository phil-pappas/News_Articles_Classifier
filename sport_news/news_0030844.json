Pic/AFP \n\"It's a morale boosting win for us as we move next to Mumbai to play against Mumbai City FC, who also won their last match and are high on confidence,\" Zico said at the post-match press conference.\n\"We started off badly and played lot of miss passes in the middle which helped the visitors to have the ball possession as they played lot of aerial passes, which got them the goal. But after introducing Mandar Rao and Romeo Fernandes midway in the second half, things worked better for us as they opened the games on the flanks earning us us corners and we scored.\"\nZico was all praise for keeper Laximani Kattimani, who brought off couple of good saves and turned the table. \"It was a tough game and we fought well after being down to collect full points. Now we must concentrate and remain focus to keep the winning momentum going,\" stated Zico. Kerala Blasters coach Peter Taylor was disappointed that his team could not win inspite of better scoring chances.\n\"The boys played well but goals were hard to come with rival keeper bringing off couple of good saves. We lacked a geninue striker who could score goals. We have been put into difficult position after three defeats at a trot and now we are playing against a highly motivated team Pune FC which will be a tough match to win,\" stated Taylor.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T02:49:04.076+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
