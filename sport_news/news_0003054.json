After starting up ... more > By TIM DAHLBERG   \nWorld headquarters for the daily fantasy site Draftpot is a bedroom in a New York City apartment a few blocks from Columbia University. \nJoey Levy and his two fellow Draftpot co-founders sleep in the apartment, too, making for an easy commute. \n“It’s very convenient and very cost effective,” Levy said. “And it allows us to work day and night.” \nThe story is a familiar one: College student with an idea creates a website and the money starts rolling in. Draftpot may not be the next Facebook, but in the first few weeks of the NFL season there was money rolling in - and out. \n“We paid out $220,000 in prizes our first football weekend,” Levy said. “We’re well on our way by the end of December of paying a million dollars.” \nLevy’s company is doing it by tapping into a daily fantasy sports market dominated by DraftKings and FanDuel, which both spent huge amounts of money leading to the opening of football season promising to make millionaires of some of their best players. \nDraftpot - at least so far - is promising no such thing. The company does believe, however, that the niche it has found in the marketplace - essentially games with no salary caps - gives players a far better shake than contests that are dominated by the bigger and more sophisticated players. \n“It levels the playing field and gives casual players more of a chance,” Levy said. “That $220,000 we paid out the first week didn’t just go to five people.” \nPaying out $220,000, of course, means the company took in more than that. Draftpot charges a “rake” of between 8 percent to 10 percent, so there is some room for profit, even after paying rent and utilities at the company’s apartment headquarters. \nNot bad for a 20-year-old fantasy sports junkie who just a few months ago was quietly pursuing a history degree at Columbia. \n“I’ve promised my mother that I will go back to school when this is over,” Levy said by phone. \nLevy hopes to postpone that return after taking an idea and turning it into an operating company in such a short time. It was in January when he and fellow students Joshua Hughes and Jessica Vandebon launched a prototype and went on the social media app Reddit to ask people to test it. \nWithin 15 minutes, a Reddit user was asking how he could invest in the company, eventually putting in $20,000. A few months later, with help mostly from angel investors, Draftpot has raised $2.2 million to fund operations. \nWith only 7,200 registered users, Draftpot is tiny compared to the industry powerhouses, which spend tens of millions of dollars to get customers. It’s also in a business where customer loyalty is fleeting and there’s no guarantee the next week will be better than the last or the company will survive at all. \n“There’s a lot of operators out there trying to get a piece of the pie,” said Cory Albertson, a top fantasy player who studies the industry. “Ultimately, most of them will fail.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T23:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T00:18:07.247+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
