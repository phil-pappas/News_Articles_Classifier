Whether it was the 6 a.m. boot camp he ran, the team-bonding exercises, the new study-hall format or the timed mile-long run that took place this week, there’s clearly a new sheriff in town when it comes to Nevada hoops. \n“It’s been a grind mentally,” senior forward Lucas Stivrins said. “There is such a change in the atmosphere. I can’t tell you how excited I am to play a game this season. I’m ready for it. I’m pumped.” \nSaid junior wing player D.J. Fenner: “I’m extremely excited. There’s just a new camaraderie, a new team.” Ex-Hug star Sam Williams commits to Wolf Pack \nMusselman inherits a team that went 9-22 last season and 5-13 in Mountain West play, which was the Wolf Pack’s third straight losing season and fourth losing campaign in five years. Coach David Carter was fired and replaced by Musselman, an accomplished coach who will run his first college program. \nHe’s taken an NBA approach to preparing for the season. The team-bonding events are new to the Nevada players. The 6 a.m. boot camp included running – “We just ran non-stop,” Fenner said – and strength training. On Wednesday, the players had to finish a mile in under 6 minutes if you were a forward/center and under 5:45 if you were a guard. Some completed the task in time, but many didn’t. \nAfter inheriting a once-proud program that has fallen on hard times since moving to the MW prior to the 2012 season, Musselman has made his players work. Hard. Harder than they ever have before. \n“People I’ve worked for, from Chuck Daly to Mike Fratello to Hubie Brown, that’s how you do things,” said Musselman, who was a college assistant the last three years. “You get ready for the season. You make players uncomfortable to get them in the proper condition and get them ready to play games. That’s the only way I’ve ever been around. I’ve never been around a country club atmosphere in getting ready for a season. It’s the only way I know how to do it, but I do think it’s new for many of our players.” \nWhile it’s been an adjustment, the Wolf Pack players have bought in. Only one scholarship player transferred (forward Robyn Missa) and the returning players speak glowingly about the change in the team. The offseason was arduous, but it’s been easy to buy into the new coaching staff, Fenner said. \n“It’s because of Coach Muss,” he said. “He makes us want to buy in. Although he demands a lot, we understand where he’s been and we understand that he’s coached at the level we want to play at, so for us not to buy in would not make any sense. We’re in a position with a great coach we can learn from.” \nThe biggest change is how the players look at each other. Last season, the players weren’t very close. \n“Honestly it’s fair to say that and it kind of showed in the wins and loss column,” Fenner said. \nThis year, they say it’s different. The team-bonding activities have led to tighter bonds. Whether it was hiking together, eating together, going to movies, playing video games or playing pickup football, the Wolf Pack players spent more time as a team in the hope that it will pay off in the win-loss column. \n“We’re definitely closer this year,” said Fenner, who was a team captain last season. “We’ve just been able to spend more time with each other off the court, whether it’s at somebody’s house playing video games or going out for dinner we’ve spent a lot of quality time together getting to know each other.” \nMusselman said the players’ response has been “phenomenal.” He said the team has made great strides but there’s still a long way to go. When asked what he likes most about the players he inherited, he didn’t talk about their on-court strengths. He fingered something else that might be more important. \n“The biggest thing right now is the willingness to be coached,” Musselman said. “That’s the No. 1 attribute that’s been a surprise to us, their willingness to be coached and willingness to have an open mind and an open heart because this is a definite culture change for a lot of guys.” \nMusselman has brought in a lot of new blood, but most of those players are transfers who are ineligible this season. The team added just two scholarship players eligible for the 2015-16 season in point guard Lindsey Drew and power forward Cameron Oliver, both freshmen. If Nevada is going to have success in 2015-16, it will largely be done on the backs of the players who won just nine games last season. \nSo, there’s a new culture and a new optimism, but there’s also a lot of work left ahead. \n“I’ve been around a lot of basketball and there are a lot of teams right now that feel really good about themselves,” Musselman said. “There are a lot of NBA teams that feel real good right now, a lot of college teams that feel real good, but with shots, minutes, roles, it’s how you respond to those types of things that make a true team. We’re going to lose a game and when we lose a game how are we going to respond? Are we going to respond the proper way? All of those things are challenges that lay ahead of us.” \nColumnist Chris Murray provides insight on Northern Nevada sports. Contact him at cmurray@rgj.com or follow him on Twitter @MurrayRGJ.
