In his first public comments since his dismissal, he wished the Trojans good luck Wednesday and also posted that no one will be cheering them on more than him. \nUSC hasn't elaborated on Sarkisian's problems, but he had an embarrassing public display in August at a pep rally where he appeared to be intoxicated while giving a speech. Sarkisian later apologized and said he had combined alcohol and medication, but promised not to drink again during the season. \nSarkisian also expressed his gratitude on Twitter for the support he had received. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T06:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T07:23:17.378+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
