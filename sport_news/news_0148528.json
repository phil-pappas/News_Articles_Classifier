The first occasion was 27 years ago, though it seems like . . . 27 years ago. Who are we kidding? We are getting old, and if we’re being honest, you can remove the word “getting” from this sentence.\nJust one player on the current roster was even alive (David Lee was all of 5) when the Celts played the Yugoslavian national team and Real Madrid in the 1988 McDonald’s Open. How long ago was it? There’s no longer a Yugoslavia.\nDanny Ainge and I were mere children then, and it was interesting to get together recently to recall the trip — in that we are at points in our lives in which remembering where we left our keys is a major accomplishment.\nThe journey, with its long flights and crowded schedule of appearances, wasn’t entirely popular with the Celtics’ aging core, but Ainge — then a boyish guard, now the president of basketball operations — seemed to have a good time.\nAt one promotional stop, the club was getting back on its bus and encountered a group of parochial schoolgirls. Ainge spoke to them. He then stepped back and smiled as they followed his direction and began chanting, “Danny, Danny.”\nBefore the trip, he decided he would take on the name “El Terrible” (pronounced El Te-ree-blay) while overseas. I recall it as a takeoff on enfant terrible, but Ainge isn’t certain.\n“I do remember giving myself the nickname ‘El Terrible,’ ” he said. “But I don’t even remember how it happened. I think I said it to somebody, and then it just got out. I just sort of had fun with it. I taped it onto my practice jersey.\n“You know me, I was just joking around. I knew just enough Spanish to get myself in trouble. I heard that on the Spanish broadcast, they even referred to me one time as El Terrible. I was dying laughing when I heard that.”\nNames were a major issue for those doing play-by-play. There weren’t a lot of Smiths and Joneses on the European clubs’ rosters. The legendary Johnny Most’s call of the game against Yugoslavia is a classic.\n“You know what I remember the most was that Johnny couldn’t pronounce anybody’s name,” Ainge said. “That was really funny.”\nJohnny wasn’t alone in his challenge. Two hours before the Celtics’ first game, the great Skip Caray walked up to me, pointed to the names on the Yugoslav roster and said, “My career will end tonight.”\nMost of the good stories came away from the court. On it, the Celts handled their business, though it seemed to take them a bit to find their stride in each game.\nThe NBA brought some American entertainment along, including the famous San Diego Chicken. Spanish fans at first thought he was Larry Bird’s personal mascot.\nThe language barrier made for some interesting moments as well. One night, Jack McCallum from Sports Illustrated, Bob Ryan and I were out investigating Madrid’s drinking customs and tried to get the DJ to play something other than local music. The guy didn’t speak any English, so McCallum did his best to convey his request. After naming a few American artists and getting a blank stare in reply, he asked, “How about Frank Sinatra? Do you have any Frank Sinatra? You know, El Jefe de Boardo?”\nNothing.\nDinner was an adventure, too. Glenn Ordway, then the Celts’ color commentator on radio, brought along an English-to-Spanish guide, making him our point man with the waiter. After the meal, he said something to our server, and someone wondered if he’d asked for the check.\nOrdway nodded quietly as he looked into his book. “Either that,” he deadpanned, “or I just ordered an elephant.”\nAinge laughed as he heard the story.\n“The whole experience was fun,” he said. “It was fun to see how many Celtics fans there were in Madrid. I remember the siestas, thinking that would be a good idea to have in the U.S., if we could implement a two-hour siesta every afternoon where everything was shut down.”\nThe Celtics didn’t get any siestas. They were part of the league’s move to globalize the NBA brand, a process that continues today in Madrid.\n“I don’t remember all the details, but it seemed like we were the first NBA team to ever go to Spain,” said Ainge, who began his friendship with Drazen Petrovic on the trip. “I remember there being talk in the early ’80s of how basketball had become a worldwide sport. (Commissioner) David Stern had talked a little bit about that, so I do think that we felt a responsibility to help expand the game in Europe and all over the world.\n“We didn’t get to spend as much time in Madrid just by ourselves as we wanted to. There were a lot of demands on our time, but it was fun. The basketball was fun, and it was overall a good experience. As the president of an NBA team, it’s not something that I want to do every year. But it’s a good experience for the players, a cultural experience.”\nTwenty-seven years ago, it was pretty good time — up to and including the Celtics gathering for a group photo on the hotel lobby steps before flying home. Some in the group began to sway and sing, “We Are the World.”\nIt was then we learned why El Terrible never made it as an Osmond Brother.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T09:43:46.018+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
