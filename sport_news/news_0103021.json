He forced and recovered a fumble in an upset win against No. 2 Colorado State-Pueblo, and recorded a career-high 19 tackles in a 52-38 victory against Tarleton State to begin Lone Star Conference play. \nThe former Bulldog played in 11 games as a true freshman last year, recording 18 tackles and returning a blocked punt for a touchdown against Texas A&M-Kingsville. Myklebust and WTAMU are off to a 2-3 start this year, having played four ranked teams. They continue conference play Oct. 17 at home against A&M-Commerce. \nMyklebust was an all-state selection and two-sport all-district selection at Austin. He was a key part of a Bulldogs squad that ended a 13-year playoff drought with consecutive postseason appearances. \nCody Moncure, Travis \nSoph., LB, HBU \nListed as a sophomore, Moncure could be considered a seasoned veteran in his third year of action with the Huskies. He has started all five games this year, bringing his career total to 23 games. \nAfter a team-high 11 tackles and a pass break-up against Central Arkansas, the former Tiger ranks second on the Huskies with 37 tackles, along with two TFL and 1 1/2 sacks. He made 53 tackles in seven games at safety as a true freshman and 55 tackles last year as a redshirt freshman linebacker. \nMoncure was a two-way standout at Travis, earning all-district recognition at receiver and defensive back during three varsity seasons. He amassed more than 1,300 receiving yards and balanced 81 tackles, 10 passes defended and five interceptions with five touchdown receptions as a senior. \nHis miraculous tipped touchdown catch in the bi-district playoffs was key to Travis winning the area championship in 2012, still the best run in school history.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T00:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T07:51:37.787+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
