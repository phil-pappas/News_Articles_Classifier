So, what’s in store for the team that put Deflategate in motion? What will the Patriots choose for their method of execution?\nSlow torture by running it down their throats, which has been the popular choice the past few games against Indianapolis? Or will it be demolition by Tom Brady, the preferred path of opponent destruction based on the first four games of 2015?\nBoth seem as if they’d be good choices tonight at Lucas Oil Stadium. Maybe the Pats will crush them both ways, like a boxer angrily throwing combination punches. We’ll soon see what Bill Belichick has up his sleeve.\nIn the NFL Network documentary “Do Your Job,” the strategy during the AFC Championship Game did not veer one bit from the regular-season meeting in Week 11. After gaining 246 yards on the ground in that game, with former Patriot Jonas Gray (201) doing most of the damage, they went ground ’n’ pound again during the AFC title game, opting for LeGarrette Blount as the weapon.\n“Until they stopped it, we were going to use it,” offensive line coach Dave DeGuglielmo said in that documentary with regard to running against the Colts in that fateful playoff game.\nAdded running backs coach Ivan Fears: “Pound the freakin’ ball. That’s all. Just pound the ball.”\nAnd they did, with little or no resistance.\nThe Colts once again had no answer. Blount was a wrecking ball, with 148 of the team’s 177 rushing yards and three touchdowns.\nWill they go to that well again tonight? And if so, will they do the job with Blount or Dion Lewis? That’s an interesting little subplot as well. Lewis, who was limited in practice late in the week with an abdomen injury, has not only taken over the Shane Vereen role as third-down back, but he’s been so good carrying the football, he’s started every game and gotten the bulk of the carries (36 to Blount’s 33). So he would seem the likely choice.\n“Dion’s been giving us a lot of productive plays, both running and passing. Some inside plays, some outside plays, some run-after-catch plays,” Belichick said. “He’s been doing it for us all year. He’s a hard guy to tackle.”\nAnd wouldn’t it be a kick if Belichick and offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels wanted him to be the guy to run all over the Colts, considering he was summarily released by Indianapolis last season after spending just six days on the roster.\nOr maybe, they won’t run at all. Now that would really drive the Colts crazy, because that’s what Chuck Pagano’s team has been bracing for over the past 10 days.\nMaybe Belichick will just defer to Brady and let his three-time Super Bowl MVP have his way with a Colts secondary that is ranked 28th out of 32 teams.\nThe Pats are, after all, a game plan offense. If the secondary is the weak area, and if that’s where the matchups are best suited to attack, forget pounding the ball as the first option.\nWhat’s the best way to destroy an opponent. No, make that really destroy an opponent?\nPut the ball in Brady’s hands.\nHe’s merely been lights out, with 1,387 yards in four games, which averages out to 346.8 yards per game. He’s on pace for the first 5,500-yard season in NFL history.\nBrady wouldn’t acknowledge much about his thoughts on the Colts during his media session Wednesday.\n“It’ll be an exciting game. I know they’ve got a good team. They’ve won three straight,” Brady said. “They made some changes this offseason, so they’re a very confident team. So it’s going to take a great effort to beat them.”\nWhile the regular-season game last year had an unbalanced run/pass ratio, with the Pats running 44 times and throwing it 30, it was more balanced during the playoff game, with a 40/35 split.\nMaybe that’s the way they’ll go tonight. Maybe that’s how they’ll exact a measure of revenge against the team that lit the fuse on the powder keg known as Deflategate. They’ll slam them with equal parts Brady and the combo of Lewis and Blount.\nIt’s certainly plausible within the Patriots’ week-by-week game plan mentality. The Colts have finally fixed their porous defensive line, although they’re still ranked 21st against the run.\nThey’re surrendering an average of 112 yards per game, which is just under one yard better than the Patriots.\nSaid Pagano: “We’ve gotten better and our numbers are better. I’m not a bean counter. At the end of the day, you try to keep people out of the end zone and scoring defense is huge. You want to play great situational football and stopping the run is always going to be paramount to any team’s success. We’ve done a better job of that. I think our front seven interior linemen have played well to this point. I think they’re gaining confidence and playing better.”\nPagano now has two Stanford rookies, Henry Anderson (third round) and David Parry (fifth round), manning the D-line along with free agent pickup Kendall Langford\n“We’re going to have to play really well come Sunday night. Again, we all know what’s transpired and that’s in the past and that’s history,” Pagano said. “This team hasn’t really played that team and they got some different players and we got some different players, but I like the direction we’re going. (We) did a good job last week and the week before that against the run, against some good runners and things like that. We’re going to have to be outstanding come (tonight).”\nOr perhaps they’ll need to be outstanding against the Pats passing attack, led by a quarterback who has been on a season-long assault, and would love to add the Colts’ hide to his 2015 bounty.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T08:40:51.673+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
