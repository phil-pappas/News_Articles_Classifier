Ever.\n“Can you envision any scenario where Isiah makes it back to the Knicks?” Bryant Gumbel asks.\n“No,” Dolan responds. “For starters, I can’t imagine having a better [management] team as I have with the Knicks right now. … Even if there was no Phil [Jackson] or no Steve [Mills], I would not do it.”\nIn the HBO clip, Dolan says: “There’s 29 teams, right, out there in the NBA, any one of which would be an easier assignment than this one. I don’t think that the New York market would ever give him a fair chance at this. And I can’t imagine why that would be … what would make it worthwhile.”\nDolan’s remarks were a reiteration of feelings he conveyed to The Post’s Mike Vaccaro two years ago in an exclusive interview. Dolan then said he wouldn’t put Thomas through such scrutiny as a friend.\nThomas, since leaving the Knicks in 2007, has told confidants his goal is to one day run the Knicks again.\nIn the sitdown with Gumbel, Dolan said he’s still thrilled with the Jackson/Mills management team despite the Knicks’ franchise-worst 17-65 record last season and a modest summer overhaul. Dolan spoke with HBO three weeks ago for about an hour regarding his peculiar relationship with Thomas, who left the Garden amid a sexual harassment scandal only to return this year as president of the Liberty.\nHBO released a “Web Extra” excerpt of the Dolan-Gumbel conversation Tuesday, hours before the debut of the “Real Sports” episode. This dialogue will not be shown on the air, according to a source.\nIn the HBO excerpt, Gumbel also asks Thomas about a Knicks future — and Thomas blatantly leaves himself some wiggle room.\n\n“You realize that a lot of people, much like you hear about gateway drugs, a lot of people think that this is a gateway back to the Knicks and the NBA,” Gumbel begins.\n“I only concentrate and focus on the New York Liberty,” Thomas says, in a passage obtained by The Post. “And you can see that I’ve had my hands full with the New York Liberty, in terms of all my focus and attention and concentration is there.\nGumbel continues: “What would you say are the chances in another seven years that we’re sitting here and you’re involved with the Knicks?”\n“That’s a slippery slope question,” Thomas says. “I can comfortably tell you this: I don’t see myself ever coaching the New York Knicks.”\nHere is the expanded transcript of Dolan’s exchange with Gumbel, as furnished to The Post:\nGumbel reads Dolan’s quote from the NY Post in 2013. \nGumbel: Why did you change your mind?\nDolan: I didn’t change my mind. That was about the Knicks.\nGumbel: Are you telling me that any publicity is good publicity where the Liberty is concerned?\nDolan: I think Isiah was going to bring a winner to us.\nGumbel: Can you envision any scenario where Isiah makes it back to the Knicks?\nDolan: No. For starters, I can’t imagine having a better [management] team as I have with the Knicks right now.\nGumbel: Yeah, but nothing last forever.\nDolan: OK, but I’m hoping that this one lasts long enough. Beyond that, I can’t think of a tougher assignment. Any of the other NBA teams would be an easier assignment than this one.\nGumbel: You can’t envision any scenario?\nDolan: No. Even if there was no Phil or no Steve, I would not do it. I care about Isiah, but I don’t think the New York market would ever give him a fair shot.\nGumbel: So you’re telling me it would be a no as much for his sake as anything else?\nDolan: Absolutely.\nGumbel: As a friend?\nDolan: Yes.\nGumbel: As a boss, would you like to see it happen?\nDolan: No.\n  Filed under hbo ,  isiah thomas ,  james dolan ,  new york knicks", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T15:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T23:30:47.159+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
