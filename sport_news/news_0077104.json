It was just seven years ago when Emily's dad found out he had Alzheimer’s, a diagnosis that changed her family's life. Emily is the daughter of Jim Yark, of the Yark Automotive Group. He was diagnosed at the age of 55.\n\"We would go there for lunch, we would go there for dinner, guys from the dealership would come out every Tuesday and make things more routine for my dad so every Tuesday he had something to look forward to. The boys and I were always there to be his number one supporter.\"\nThey are one of the thousands of families helped by the Alzheimer’s Association of NW Ohio. Jim Yark was one of the 38 thousand people diagnosed with Alzheimer’s in NW Ohio every year. The annual fundraising walk at University of Toledo will raise over $250,000. And much of it will stay right here at the University for research.\nSalli Bollin, of the Alzheimer’s Association of Northwest Ohio says when a family receives a diagnosis Alzheimer’s, they are being told they have a long hard road ahead. “But the University of Toledo is actively looking for solutions. They have received a $100,000 two-year grant for research. They have already created small molecules that could be a link to a cure.\"\n“It is a hard road. At the present time, there is no cure. It is one of the few major diseases where we don't have any affective treatment,\" says Dr. Bill Messer, Vice President of UT Research. He has been working with the national organization to see how UT researchers could focus on Alzheimer’s\nMs. Yark says, \"There are so many of us, so come out, and talk to other people and let's all join together and find a cure.\"", "external_links": ["http://up.anv.bz/latest/scripts/anvload.js", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?sz=640x480&iu=/301721715/WTVG&ciu_szs&impl=s&gdfp_req=1&ad_rule=1&vpos=preroll&env=vp&output=xml_vast2&unviewed_position_start=1&correlator=", "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/C79/FDC/C79FDC697DB246959444619FE770444E.mp4"], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T02:09:18.164+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
