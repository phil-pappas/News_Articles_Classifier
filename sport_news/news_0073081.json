It's very unlikely. But it is a possibility.\n\"That game is on a long list for that weekend -- we have many potential options,\" an ESPN spokesperson wrote in an e-mail today. \"The primary factors that go into the decision for a GameDay location are the compelling storylines, records of the teams and the quality of the matchup.\"\nThough Memphis is being considered for GameDay, there are several other marquee matchups that weekend that seem like more likely destinations. Among the other games scheduled for that day: No. 2 Michigan State at No. 22 Michigan, No. 23 West Virginia at No. 5 Baylor, No. 15 Oklahoma at Kansas State, No. 25 Florida at No. 9 LSU and No. 13 Alabama at No. 14 Texas A&M.\nNo. 17 USC will also play at No. 6 Notre Dame in a game scheduled for 5:30 p.m. CT on NBC, while Penn State will travel to No. 1 Ohio State at 6 p.m. on the ESPN family of networks.\nWhether Memphis is ranked at the time may be a pivotal factor. Last year, only three GameDay destinations featured an unranked Football Bowl Subdivision team: No. 1 Florida State at Oklahoma State, Missouri at No. 13 South Carolina, and Army against Navy, which was played in Baltimore.\nThe kickoff time for Memphis' game against Ole Miss could be determined as early as Monday, which would mark the beginning of the 12-day window in which television networks can set game times. It could be announced as late as the following Sunday, however. Television rights-holders can choose to wait until six days before a game in select circumstances to ensure that the best games are shown in the premier slots.\nDecisions about College GameDay's destinations are made independently of game times. They are typically announced the weekend before a game.\nTo even be considered by College GameDay is a small feat for Memphis, which won just three total games under Larry Porter in 2010 and 2011. Under Justin Fuente, the Tigers won 10 games in 2014, capped by a thrilling 55-48 victory over BYU in the Miami Beach Bowl. Entering Friday's game at South Florida, they are in the midst of a program-record 11-game winning streak.\nThe basketball version of the pregame show has been in Memphis multiple times, most recently in February 2014, when the Tigers hosted Gonzaga. The network has never brought College GameDay to Memphis for football.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T01:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T08:19:37.885+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
