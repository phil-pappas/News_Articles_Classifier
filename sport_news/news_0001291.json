It's not gate-worthy. \nAlabama's left tackle shouldn't have shoved that Arkansas player after Robinson got knocked to the ground at the end of that interception return in the second quarter of Alabama 27, Arkansas 14 . \nRobinson also shouldn't have raised his hand to Bielema after the Arkansas coach came off the sideline and raised his hand to Robinson. Was able to get another video angle that shows Cam Robinson's personal foul. Doesn't look like a Bret Bielema flop. pic.twitter.com/nCilLLbsWz \nRobinson has admitted the errors of his ways to his head coach, Nick Saban said. Credit to the young man. \nBut Bielema shouldn't have come off the sideline and raised his hand to Robinson in the first place. If a coach senses trouble brewing in the heat of the moment, as Bielema said he did, his responsibility as the adult in the room is to help escort his player or players from the scene. \nInstead Bielema confronted Robinson, and it's disappointing that the coach didn't take the same responsibility for his actions that the player did. \nSEC Commissioner Greg Sankey acknowledged Bielema's role in his public statement on the situation . The statement said Sankey spoke to Bielema by phone Monday and advised, \"Football is played in an intense competitive environment, and I reminded him of the need for head coaches to resolve with their own players issues that may arise, which was his intent.\" \nKey phrase: With their own players. Whether it was intended or not, Bielema escalated the incident when he attempted to resolve the issue with Robinson. \nAs usual, Sankey chose his words very carefully in his interpretation of \"Bret's efforts to intervene at the end of the play.\" \nUpon further and far too much review by everyone concerned, Sankey handled it just right, and no further intervention on his part was necessary. There was no need to suspend Robinson or Bielema . There was a need to address it and move on. \nNow, with that nuisance off his plate, maybe the commish can get to the bottom of why that ESPN sound guy was waving his hand on the Arkansas sideline, whether he had a camera rolling as well and if he was indeed auditioning for an internship with the New England Patriots. What is going on here? What do these hand signals indicate? Is this guy with ESPN? @SEC @KevinScarbinsky @KTHogs pic.twitter.com/JSrapUjVpD â€” Jim Harris (@jimharris360) October 14, 2015 \nHopefully, Sankey can clear up this confusion before all those black helicopters circling the state of Arkansas run out of gas.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T23:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T00:24:48.587+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
