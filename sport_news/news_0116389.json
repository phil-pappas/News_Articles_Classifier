Jason Cowan / Union Democrat, Copyright 2015. Three people were killed Tuesday deep inside rural Calaveras County, beyond the Butte Fire burn zone in a pocket of vegetation, where houses can be found between the vast meadows, tucked into a hillside. Sgt. Anthony Eberhardt, with the Calaveras County Sheriff’s Office, said Tuesday afternoon the department was interviewing a person of interest who was not considered a suspect at the time. He declined to comment regarding any other aspect of the case. The shooting took place on an almost empty piece of land off of Railroad Flat Road, directly across the street from Doe Road between Rail Road Flat and Mountain Ranch. The call came into 911 at 9:30 a.m., a Calaveras County Sheriff’s Office report stated. Neighbors interviewed by The Union Democrat said they heard three shots at 6:03 a.m. Ten minutes later three more and then after 7 a.m., three more, they said. Though the incident occurred before the sun rose, some neighbors said they believed the gunfire was target practice, an activity common in the area. Others, though, said it was unusual. Neighbors said the property does not contain a house and was vacant except for a shack as recently as a year ago, before the city made the owner tear the structure down because it lacked a septic system. The property owner could not be reached for comment. A struggle of some sort was evident. On a normal day, the land, known for its barbed wire enclosure and pair of closed green cattle gates, would be vacant. On Tuesday, the barbed wire fence had been clipped on the right side and one gate sat ajar. Inside the property and beyond the trees sat a light-colored four-door SUV. It faced an old storage unit hidden within the vegetation. Most of the evidence markers at the crime scene were visible from the street — lying just inside the entrance — but it was not possible to see what they were marking. In the distance, a Calaveras County Sheriff’s deputy could be seen carrying a bag full of white material and placing it in a tub. No one at the crime scene would comment on what they found.
