It’s the Midwest Conference South Division opener for both schools and also homecoming for the Foresters (1-3). Knox needs to eliminate the self-inflicted wounds in order to notch a victory against Lake Forest, who is coming off a 35-13 loss at Carroll University last week. The Prairie Fire (2-2) had four costly turnovers that led to 25 Scots points as Macalester College defeated Knox 46-19 last Saturday. “Lake Forest is a very hungry team, I think,” Knox coach Damon Tomeo said after Tuesday’s practice. “They’re a good football team that plays a really good physical brand of ball and we’re going to have to bring our game on Saturday. We have to overcome the challenges with the travel, overcome the physical aspects of it and play all four quarters. It sounds cliché-like but we’ve struggled with that in our two losses. “We have to continue to maintain and improve our focus and really play every snap. I think offensively and defensively, statistically, we played pretty well (last week) but four or five snaps it was catastrophic.” Knox holds a 31-24 mark against Lake Forest in the series which dates back to 1901. The Fire suffered a 27-6 loss to the Foresters last season at the Knosher Bowl. Jim Catanzaro is in his seventh season as Lake Forest’s coach. The Foresters, who went 4-6 overall and 2-3 in the MWC South in 2014, return 11 starters. Knox’s 3-4 defense will have its hands full with Lake Forest senior wideouts Willie McIntyre and George Vidas. McIntyre is averaging 83.3 all-purpose yards per game and has 24 catches for 334 yards and a touchdown this season. Vidas has 16 catches for 134 yards and two touchdowns and is averaging 35 all-purpose yards per contest. “They are both returning starters. They’re in the special teams game, too,” Tomeo said of the pair. “They can get it going pretty, pretty good. They are probably the better tandem in the conference of wide receivers. Everybody has one but they have two who we feel are very, very good. “They have a lot of moving parts that are coming back. The tight end is back. Their H-backs are back. The fullback is back. They’ve struggled a little bit at quarterback and offensive line but there are so many other skill guys around they’ve been able to hang in games. I don’t think their record reflects how good the program is there at Lake Forest. It will be a big challenge for us.” Page 2 of 2 - For the Foresters, Fire wide receiver Ilir Emini will be hard to contain. He had a single-season Knox record 88 receptions in 2014 as a junior. Emini finished with 781 yards and five touchdowns. The senior has 24 catches for 294 yards and two TDs this season. Knox quarterback Matt McCaffrey has completed 70 of 119 passes for 824 yards with five touchdowns and five interceptions this season. The sophomore has 36 rushing attempts for 208 yards and three TDs. Jared Zanger has 24 rushes for 84 yards and has scored four TDs. Nick Edlund has 72 carries for 341 yards and hasn’t scored for Knox.
