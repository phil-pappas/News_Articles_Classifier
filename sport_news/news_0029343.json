The Stars squandered a 3-1 lead and were blown out by the Avalanche 6-3.\nBut as much as the final score was tough to swallow, the fact the game was tied heading into the third period had Stars head coach Lindy Ruff fuming.\n\"It's disappointing. It's embarrassing, worse than disappointing,\" Ruff said. \"It's a 3-3 game with 20 minutes left, that's not good enough. They won the battles and their best players were the best players and ours weren't.\"\nGabriel Landeskog finished with two goals and two assists, Nathan MacKinnon had a goal and two assists and Alex Tanguay chipped in two pretty assists for Colorado. The Stars were led by two goals from Cody Eakin and one from rookie Mattias Janmark.\n\"We had 20 minutes left in the hockey game, and they wanted it more than us and outbattled us, and that pretty much sums it up,\" said Stars captain Jamie Benn, who had an assist but finished minus-2.\nDallas had a 33-28 advantage in shots on goal and was solid for the first 30 minutes of the game. Janmark scored just 20 seconds into the game, scoring on his first shot for the second game in a row. The rookie scored 1:39 into his NHL debut and then broke open on a Jason Demers pass on his first shift against Colorado.\nJanmark beat Semyon Varlamov and an Avalanche team that had squandered a 4-1 lead in a 5-4 loss to Minnesota on Thursday was on the ropes. MacKinnon tied the game, but then Eakin scored twice to put the Stars in the driver's seat.\nBoosted up to the top line and given power play time, Eakin was opportunistic. He scored off a rebound set up by Benn and Tyler Seguin, and then followed that up with a power play goal off a nice pass from Demers.\nWith Antti Niemi riding a hot streak and the Stars playing with confidence, it seemed the team was off to the second step of that fast start it so desired.\nBut then Colorado came back with power play goals from Erik Johnson and Jarome Iginla, and the battle was on. Tied 3-3 after two periods, the Avalanche ran away with the game. John Mitchell set up camp in front of the goal and waited for the puck. It found its way to him, and he beat Niemi for the go-ahead goal at the 8:11 mark. Mitchell was left alone by the Stars' team defense in a moment that characterized the third period for Dallas.\nLandeskog then scored on a one-timer 47 seconds later, and the game was pretty much over. Varlamov held the fort, and Landeskog added another goal to make Niemi's night pretty terrible.\nAfter stopping 37 shots in a shutout on Thursday, he allowed six goals on 28 shots Saturday.\n\"It's a long season, and we have to be sharp in these situations,\" Niemi said. \"It was 3-3 going to the third; we've got to be better there.\"\nIn fact, the Stars have to be much better. If they want to win the Central -- or just make the playoffs -- they need to solve the mystery that is Pepsi Center.\n\"We learned our lesson last year. These guys had our number last year, and we had a pretty bad record in our division, and it makes a pretty big difference coming down the stretch,\" Benn said. \"We don't want to be looking back ever. We wanted to change that, but it wasn't there.\"\nDallas last won in Denver on Feb.4, 2013, and most of those seven losses haven't been close.\n\"At this point, it just sucks to lose this game,\" said Jason Spezza when asked if the losing streak stings. \"We know we've got to beat these guys, we know we've got to beat the division, but we just have to ge t back to work.\"\nTwitter: @MikeHeika\nOn Twitter:\n @MikeHeika", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/MikeHeika", "http://video.stars.nhl.com/videocenter/console?catid=1227&id=844539&lang=en", "http://video.stars.nhl.com/videocenter/console?catid=1229&id=844538&lang=en", "https://twitter.com/MikeHeika"], "published": "2015-10-11T07:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T11:13:27.277+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
