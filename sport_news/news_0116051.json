Philadelphia also sacked Manning’s backup, Ryan Nassib, twice. The Giants’ offensive line this season has been overhauled with a first-round draft pick, a free-agent acquisition and lots of shifting of personnel. No starter on this year’s Giants offensive line played that position for the team a year ago.\nSo far this year, the Giants’ line has done a respectable job protecting Manning, but Monday’s game may be the biggest test yet of the revamped unit’s cohesiveness. Philadelphia can be a loud and confusing place for an offensive line to operate, and the Eagles’ pass rush may also be finally hitting its stride. Last week against New Orleans, Philadelphia sacked Saints quarterback Drew Brees five times.\nNumber to watch: 3-1\nThat is Chip Kelly’s record against the Giants since he became the Eagles’ head coach. The Eagles defeated the Giants twice last season.\nQuotation of the Week\n‘Oh, yeah, they treat you like royalty.’\nODELL BECKHAM Jr., Giants wide receiver, when asked if Philadelphia fans treated him well when he made his first career visit to Lincoln Financial Field last season.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T07:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T07:10:11.353+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
