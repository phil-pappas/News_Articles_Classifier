The Jags QB’s four touchdown game was a career high and it was the first time he has thrown more than two in a game. \nn Despite the fact that we knew since Friday that Marshawn Lynch would miss this game, backup Thomas Rawls is still unowned in 53% of Yahoo leagues. Well, if you started him against the tough Bengals defence, you were rewarded to the tune of 22.9 points. \nROB LONGLEY'S YOU BET \nIt would have taken a full week of waiting to get it, but if you were a patient enough Buffalo Bills backer, you could have cashed in on Sunday — and in dramatic fashion. For much of the days leading up to their date with the Titans, the Bills were 2 1/2-point road favourites and even through most of Sunday were down to a point. But by kickoff in Vegas, the consensus line in Vegas was ‘pick ‘em and that late touchdown for a 14-13 win got Buffalo’s record to 2-2 and a cash score for some ... Beware the big favourites? Not so much when it is the New England Patriots and Green Bay Packers giving up the large number this week. The Pack were the nine-point choice at home and used a late turnover to preserve the cover with a 24-10 win over the visiting Rams. The Patriots, meanwhile, went to Dallas and destroyed the Tony Romo-less (and thus offence-less) Cowboys 30-6 to easily cover the 8 1/2 point spread ... And then there were the Chiefs, who were nine-point home favourites to the Chicago Bears and lost outright. Oops. ... Speaking of the Packers and Patriots, can the Vegas oddsmakers just get down to business and set a Super Bowl line? Prior to Sunday action, the Packers were slight 5-2 favouritees to win the Bowl, followed by the Patriots at 4-1 ... Seattle was the third choice, but after blowing a huge lead and chance to win outright as underdogs in Cincinnati, expect that to change ... The Seattle-Cincy matchup was one of a handful in the afternoon that would have had bettors pulling their hair out. Imagine if you were a Seattle bettor (guilty) and saw a 17-point fourth quarter lead turn into a three-point loss ... No less than three contests finished in OT, including Baltimore blowing a big lead to Cleveland and Atlanta coming back to defeat Washington. The Browns, by the way, are now 7-2 against the spread as a road dog the past nine times they’ve been in that spot ... Not a pleasant time to be a Lions fan (as if there ever is one.) After getting destroyed at home to the Arizona Cardinals on Sunday, the Lions are not only 0-5 straight up but a costly 1-4 versus the spread.
