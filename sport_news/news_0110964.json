(Source: AP/Danny Johnson) \n(RNN) - The first week in October, and already, SEC powers are fighting for respect and against irrelevance. \nSaturday, there will be rain from Portland, OR to Portland, ME; from San Diego, CA, to Saint Augustine, FL. Close the drapes, Southeastern U.S.A., lock the door, keep the remote at hand, anchor your potato to that couch and watch ball. That’s an order. South Carolina at Missouri Noon ET, SECN \nThe early TV game is an entertaining little eye opener if you are a fan of freshman quarterbacks, bitter struggle and desperation. \nThe ever erratic Maty Mauk will sit out a suspension for unspecified bad acting, and freshman Drew Lock will start at quarterback for Mizzou. The Western Tiger offense has been heinous against a cake-like schedule, ranking a solid 120th of 128 FCS teams with a dreadful 4.88 yards per play average. The team is coming off a 21-13 loss to a resurgent Kentucky, but nevertheless Kentucky, and that was with Mauk. \nSouth Carolina is on its third quarterback this year, but that Lorenzo Nunez kid looked like a trained killer against UCF last week, running for 123, passing for 184 to bring a ray of hope to the dark night of the Gamecock soul. It was a good win, but it’s UCF, which ranks a resounding last among the 128 FBS teams, averaging a pitiable 3.28 yards per offensive play. Alabama at Georgia 3:30 p.m. ET. CBS \nSpeaking of quarterbacks, bitter struggle and desperation: witness the Alabama Crimson Tide and Coach Nick Saban, underdogs for the first time since 2009. A loss here, the Tide drops to 0-2 in the SEC, igniting the furious anger of that segment of the Bama fan base that includes the overly demanding, hypercritical and thoroughly obnoxious, which hovers around 100 percent. \nAre we seeing the end-time spasms of a football Ozymandias, or does the fighter still remain? \nTide starter Jake Coker and Cooper Bateman, the ill-advised starter in the home loss to Ole Miss, make you wonder about life and stuff. \nLike, if Alabama has had the No. 1 recruiting class every year since stone tools, why didn’t somebody think to sign a dual-purpose quarterback, or at least a brain who can complete short passes and do calculus in his head like Greg McElroy? \nEverything else on Bama’s offense seems pretty tight. Two murderous running backs, check. A boat load of talented, young, if inexperienced wide receivers and the best tight end anywhere who nobody ever throws to. Check. A massive, mobile road-grader of an offensive line? Check-ish, most of the time. \nGeorgia’s quarterback Grayson Lambert, like Coker, transferred in after losing the starting battle at another school. Coker lost the job to FSU’s Jameis Winston, who you may have heard of. Lambert headed to Athens after he lost out to a person called Matt Johns, who has paced the Virginia Cavaliers to a pathetic 1-3 start, and who tossed a brainless, over-the-shoulder catastrophic pick-6 to a 300-pound Boise State defensive tackle to start an embarrassing rout. \nLambert has laughed all the way to being the hottest quarterback in the game for the No. 8-ranked Bulldogs of the East. But up to now, his competition has amounted to precisely nobody. \nIn an aside, UGA starting receiver and punt returner Isiah McKenzie was named in a police report as making a “terroristic threat” to a waitress at Chili’s, allegedly saying he was going to call up his friends and kill her. We’ve all been upset when our bacon ranch quesadillas don’t arrive promptly, but threatening murder in a public place is poor conflict resolution. McKenzie hasn’t been charged with anything, the school hasn’t issued a comment, and unless he actually does kill the waitress, look for him to play. \nWhich probably won’t matter much, because it’s going to rain like there was a giant hurricane nearby, which there is. \nAs Coach Potato’s official weather guru Josh Johnson of WSFA in Montgomery, AL put it: The rain is the obvious issue, but don't ignore the breezy conditions. NE at 10-20 with gusts to 25. That's enough of a breeze to potentially affect the passing game. \nHanding the ball to Nick Chubb about 40 times is a lovely option under those conditions. \nWhether college ball’s best running back can run through Alabama’s first-rate defensive front in the mud will tell the tale. \nBoth teams have great defenses. Alabama’s bigger and Georgia is faster, bearing a strong resemblance to Ole Miss, which forced five Tide turnovers in Tuscaloosa. \nCan Chubb’s Bama counterpart, Derrick Henry throw his team on his back, pound the rock and hit the occasional vertical crease on a saturated field? \nDon’t be surprised if this one winds up 5-3 after a last-second safety on a bad call. Arkansas at Tennessee 7 p.m., ET ESPN2 \nCall it the Underachiever Bowl. Two teams that began the year with such promise only to fall over when pushed. \nTennessee blew big fourth-period leads against Oklahoma and Florida. Yes, Florida, surrendering a 63-yard scoring pass on a fourth-and-long to keep the Gators alive. Let me repeat that: this was Florida. \nLast week, Arkansas played Texas A&M hard on the road, but blew a fourth-quarter lead to continue a tragic spiral into oblivion and beyond. \nThis is going to be train wreck contest between two titanic train wrecks. Enjoy. Ole Miss at Florida 7 p.m. ET, ESPN \nLook! It’s an interdivision clash of unbeaten SEC teams. \nOle Miss beat Alabama in Tuscaloosa then struggled against Vandy. Florida has snatched two fouth-quarter victories from Kentucky and Tennessee. \nThe Rebels have an outstanding, athletic defense, and Florida, um, doesn’t. \nThe Gators offense has sputtered, but these are gritty Gators who’ve done just enough to win. New coach Jim McElwain may curse out players using words that can take the paint off a car, but he’s got the team playing with enough heart to overcome shortcomings. \nThat probably won’t be enough against a pack of Rebels who are fully deserving of a No. 3 national ranking. But they’ll need a good performance out of the exciting Chad Kelly, who plays like his hair was on fire with a grizzly bear chasing him over broken glass. \nIf Ole Miss wins, they are the indubitable SEC West frontrunner and a beautiful and terrifying national championship contender. If Florida wins, they have got to be taken seriously in the SEC East race, and McIlwain may get a thank-you bouquet from his old boss, Nick Saban Mississippi State at Texas A&M 7:30 p.m. ET, SECN \nTexas A&M has won all its games this year by pulling just enough explosive rabbits out of the offensive hat to fend off two bad and two overrated teams. \nLast week, Arkansas managed to hold A&M to just 28 points, and if they weren’t so Arkansas-y, probably would have won. \nMississippi State in no way resembles the wallowing-in-mediocrity Hogs. These guys tackle in large groups, cover receivers, rush quarterbacks and generally speaking, are ill-tempered. In their close home loss to LSU they didn’t stop Leonard Fournette, but this time next year, neither will anybody in the NFL. \nTexas A&M has been hamstrung by a bunch of unlucky running back injuries, and has zero depth after Tra Carson, who’s plenty good, but he’s the only guy unless and until some people get well. Kyle Allen is a promising freshman QB, but the best thing about freshmen is that they turn into sophomores. \nWestern Bulldog QB Dak Prescott is a wicked-good quarterback who can throw it over yonder mountain and he’s fast and h ge, as a certain presidential candidate might say. \nTexas A&M defensive coordinator John Chavis and his lads had a tough time with Arkansas last week. \nIf anybody’s old enough to remember pinball machines, the scoreboard might look like one of those. \nTune in and place cell phones on airplane mode for this one. The other ones \nSan Jose State at Auburn, 4 p.m. ET, SECN: Auburn fans hope for a short respite from the unspooling tragedy that this season has become. San Jose is 2-2 with losses to Air Force and Oregon State, who one would is assume are not appreciably better than the Eastern Tigers. Well, Air Force only lost to Michigan State 35-21 last week, and Auburn lost. \nVanderbilt at Middle Tennessee, 7 p.m. ET: Coach Derek Mason has got the Commies playing tremendously better than last year’s sorrowful march through futility. Go get em, Big V. \nEastern Kentucky at Kentucky, 7:30 p.m. SECN Alternate Channel: The Wildcats are slowly, slowly climbing the ladder out of the eternal SEC basement. Here’s a lower-division state rival that lost to N.C. State 35-0, so run it up, Coach Mark Stoops. Your fans deserve it. \nCopyright 2015 Raycom News Network.
