Ya’ll come on in here with me, so that’s when I said come on, let’s get down on the floor,” says Malone.\nShe says it seemed as if, the gunfire would never end.\n“I wasn’t even trying to count. I was just praying, Lord, please just let it be over,” says Malone.\nWhen the gunfire stopped, she says police quickly arrived and she discovered three places where bullets literally flew through her home.\n“I got a bullet hole through my window, through my garage door, and through my front door,” says Malone\nOutside, in the street, next door to her home, police found three gunshot victims.\n“Two victims were still there, and one victim had been transported to Oschner Hospital in Laplace,” says Sheriff Mike Tregre.\nPolice say all three victims had pulled up in a vehicle around 1:50 a.m. Monday, when they believe the shooter or shooters pulled up in a white pickup truck and opened fire.\nTravis Gregoire, 23, died from his injuries. Monday evening, police announced that a female victim, identified as 18-year-old Sierra Gregoire also passed away.\nAnother 23-year-old man was also shot.\n“She was laying at this lady’s house over there. I thought she was just a little girl, but she was 18 years old,” says Laura Campbell.\nCampbell says she ran out of her home and approached the victim.\n“She just said her name. She was trying to give me her phone number for us to call her family I guess. She really kept repeating that phone number,” says Campbell.\nSheriff Tregre says he’s hoping surveillance video of the truck believed to be used in the shooting will generate calls to CRIMESTOPPERS.\n“It’s not right. It’s just not right. Why are they killing up each other like that?” says Campbell.\n“This is the first time. Nothing like this has ever happened, and it just scared me,” says Malone.\n The surviving victim is in stable condition.\nCopyright 2015 WVUE .
