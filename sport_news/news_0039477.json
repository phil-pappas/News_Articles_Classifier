Offensive coordinator Mike Locksley will serve as the interim coach. The move ends days of speculation surrounding Edsall's future and opens an uncertain chapter for a reeling Maryland program that has been blown out in three consecutive games and suffered eroding support this season in home attendance and among donors. Edsall, 57, was terminated with one year remaining on his initial six-year deal. Edsall, who was hired in 2011 after Maryland had forced out longtime coach Ralph Friedgen, closed his tenure with a 22-34 record. Maryland fell to 2-4 this season, 0-2 in Big Ten play, after Saturday's 49-28 loss at No. 1 Ohio State. Edsall was brought to College Park after an 11-year stint at UConn to elevate Maryland's program from \"good to great,\" Athletic Director Kevin Anderson said shortly after making the hire, but that vision never fully materialized. The move will have short-term financial implications for Maryland, which must pay Edsall his salary of $2.1 million for this season in addition to a buyout that will cost roughly $2.6 million. Since Edsall's arrival, the Terrapins improved their academic record and had relatively few off-field issues. They entered this season coming off back-to-back winning years for the first time since 2002. But the team never enjoyed Anderson's promised breakthrough under Edsall, whose selection in 2011 was considered a disappointment by some Maryland fans who yearned for a more prominent hire. Edsall did not win more than seven games in a season in College Park; lost all 12 of his games against top 25 opponents, including Saturday's setback in Columbus; and failed to lead the team to victory in two postseason appearances. Maryland lost to Marshall in the 2013 Military Bowl and was trounced by Stanford in the Foster Farms Bowl last December. The Terrapins have been on a backward slide since last season's meltdown against Rutgers in the regular season finale, when they blew a 25-point lead and lost, 41-38, to deny Edsall his first eight-win season at the school. Since that point, Maryland has been outscored, 167-55, by four major conference opponents. That does not include an embarrassing 48-27 home loss to underdog Bowling Green on Sept 12. The loss to the Falcons underscored not only the Terrapins' plaguing on-field issues, most notably their lack of a viable starting quarterback, but inflamed the dissent among the fan and donor base that helped lead to Saturday's move. A person with knowledge of the situation said earlier this week that it appeared Edsall had lost support in the locker room over the last month, speculation that intensified after the team held a players-only meeting without the head coach's knowledge three days after a 45-6 loss at West Virginia on Sept. 26. Page 2 of 2 - As Maryland struggled on the field, momentum against Edsall ramped up off it. One high-level booster said this week that he was among a group of season-ticket donors who notified Anderson that they would cancel funding should Edsall not be fired. Another high-level booster said earlier this week that it was becoming more difficult for the school to solicit donations for the renovation of Cole Field House, a $155 million project that is slated to make Maryland the last Big Ten school to have an indoor football facility. Attendance for games at Byrd Stadium has also dropped by 13 percent this season, according to an analysis conducted by CBSSports.com . A year after Maryland touted a 30 percent increase in season ticket sales in its inaugural season in the Big Ten, this season's attendance dip is one of the five largest among the 65 programs that form the \"Power Five,\" the sport's wealthiest and most powerful conferences. Through last Saturday's 28-0 home loss to Michigan, which attracted a season-best crowd of 51,802, the average announced attendance over four home games was 40,769. Byrd Stadium has a capacity of 54,000. The quarterback position has been at the root of Maryland's on-field dysfunction since fall camp wrapped in August. At that point, Edsall surprisingly named junior Perry Hills the starter over redshirt junior Caleb Rowe and graduate transfer Daxx Garman. But in an odd twist, Hills was demoted to third string after the Bowling Green loss and Rowe took over as the starter the following week in a win over South Florida. Rowe, whose 12 interceptions entering this weekend's games were most in major college football, was benched in the second half of ugly losses to West Virginia and Michigan in favor of Garman, who has struggled to learn the offense after transferring in the offseason from Oklahoma State. Maryland hit new lows under Edsall in both games. The 39-point loss to West Virginia was the third worst of his tenure, while the loss to Michigan was the first time Maryland had been shut out at home since 1999. Edsall, a former quarterback at Syracuse, reopened the competition between the three players earlier this week, hoping to jump-start a position that entered Saturday's game at Ohio State with the second-worst passer efficiency rating among 128 programs in the top tier of college football. He reinstated Hills as the starter for Saturday's game. The offensive ineptitude was not the only issue under Edsall in his fifth season. Maryland also entered Saturday's game against Ohio State with its defense ranked 109th in yards allowed per game among Football Bowl Subdivision schools. It is not immediately clear who Maryland may target to replace Edsall on a permanent basis, although the current staff is likely to be overhauled following the season's end. Edsall was just four months removed from signing a three-year contract extension, which at the time represented a measured vote of confidence from the administration. Anderson praised Edsall at the time for guiding the program through its first season in the Big Ten, where Maryland finished 7-6. He also credited Edsall for prioritizing academics and for his work on the recruiting front. All of that quickly became an afterthought as this season began.
