(AP) - Former members of the upstate New York church where two teens were viciously beaten paint a picture of a once vibrant and joyous house of worship that had declined into a place of fear and intimidation under new leadership.\nChadwick Handville says the church in New Hartford was at first warm and welcoming, but changed when its founder returned.\nHandville left Word of Life Christian Church in June 2000. He said things went downhill after founder Jerry Irwin reclaimed his position as pastor. Irwin died several years ago after a stroke.\nSix church leaders and parishioners now face charges including manslaughter and assault for a brutal beating last Sunday that left 19-year-old Lucas Leonard dead and his 17-year-old brother Christopher hospitalized. Church members Bruce and Deborah Leonard, parents of the victims, face the most serious charge of manslaughter.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T13:03:10.415+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
