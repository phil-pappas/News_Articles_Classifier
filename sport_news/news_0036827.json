CLIFTON – Coach Ralph Cinque couldn’t have asked for a better response Friday night to the Clifton football team’s first defeat of the season.\nJunior tailback Saadiq Pitts scored three touchdowns, junior quarterback Joe Santillo threw for two scores and the Mustangs’ defense shut down Kennedy in a 38-0 win at Clifton Stadium.\nThe Mustangs, who went 1-9 last season, improved to 3-1-1 a week after losing at Ridgewood and moved another win closer to securing Clifton’s first playoff berth since 2008.\n“They worked hard all week in practice,” said Cinque, a longtime Clifton assistant who’s in his first season as head coach. “I told them, ‘If we start doing more than what’s expected of us, we’re going to win some football games.’ It was a great all-around effort – offense, defense, special teams. … It’s a coach’s dream.”\nClifton recorded its first shutout since the Mustangs defeated Fair Lawn, 19-0, in September 2013. Senior defensive end Maurice Greene recorded two sacks and recovered a fumble for the Mustangs.\nKennedy, which began the season ranked No. 10 in The Record public Top 25, fell to 2-5.\nPitts, a transfer from Paramus Catholic, finished with 60 rushing yards and two touchdowns on 11 carries, all in the first half. He also caught a 23-yard touchdown pass.\n“I think he came into his own as a football player [Friday night],” Cinque said of Pitts. “We always knew how good of a football player he was. But [Friday night] he showed us how much of a man he has become these last couple weeks. I couldn’t be more proud of him. He said, ‘Coach, give me the ball. I’ll get you three [touchdowns].’ He got us three.”\nClifton capitalized on fantastic field position throughout the first half to take a 31-0 lead into intermission.\nUp 7-0, Pitts scored his second touchdown of the game, a 15-yard run around left end with 1:09 to go in the first quarter, on the Mustangs’ first play after recovering a Kennedy fumble.\nClifton began its next drive on Kennedy’s 17-yard line because the Knights botched a snap on an attempted punt. Three plays later, senior kicker Steele Leon kicked a 22-yard field goal for a 17-0 Clifton lead at 6:54 of the second quarter.\nA 1-yard punt by Kennedy on the Knights’ ensuing possession enabled Clifton to begin its next drive at Kennedy’s 23. Santillo threw a strike on first down to senior receiver Delano Dixon in the end zone for a 23-yard touchdown that helped increase Clifton’s lead to 24-0 at the 5:39 mark of the second quarter.\nThe Mustangs’ final drive of the first half began at Kennedy’s 49. It resulted in Pitts’ third touchdown, a screen pass from Santillo he took 23 yards for a score with 56 seconds left in the second quarter.\n“This shows that hard work does pay off and it builds confidence,” said Adam Miranda, a junior guard/linebacker for Clifton. “We had to do what our coaches tell us, grind and work hard.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T03:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T07:53:13.159+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
