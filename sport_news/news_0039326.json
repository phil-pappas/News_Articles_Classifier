Christy Cabrera Chirinos Contact Reporter Sun Sentinel 'Canes looking to end five-year skid against rival Seminoles \nAs a California kid, Brad Kaaya may not have grown up with the kind of exposure to the Miami-Florida State rivalry that some of his teammates had. But it didn't take long for the Hurricanes' young quarterback to learn what the game means, not just in the locker room, but across the state. \nAnd the feeling he had walking off the field at Sun Life Stadium after last year's 30-26 loss to the Seminoles is one he hasn't forgotten as he prepares to face FSU for the second time in his Miami career, especially since the Hurricanes controlled much of that game. \n\"It was a rough loss. Guys on our team, that was a huge game for them, for a lot of our seniors,\" said Kaaya, who was 16 of 34 for 316 yards with a pair of touchdowns and an interception against the Seminoles in 2014. \"We as young guys, we wanted to win the game for them. We let them down, we feel like. Of course, it's always a big game. But that game hurt pretty bad last year.\" \nKaaya and his teammates will get their shot at redemption Saturday night when they take the field at Doak Campbell Stadium for yet another nationally televised game against the 12th-ranked Seminoles. And after five straight losses to FSU, Kaaya and his younger teammates are hoping they can find a way to help another group of seniors get the win they so desperately want against their in-state rival, especially since yet another loss would give Miami its second-longest losing streak in the history of the 60-year-old rivalry. \nBut with the Hurricanes coming off an embarrassing 34-23 loss at Cincinnati, there's even more at stake. \nMiami coach Al Golden again finds himself the subject of much scrutiny and criticism from an angry fan base. The Hurricanes have yet to play four consistent quarters against a quality opponent this season. They can't find solutions to their third-down woes. And the push for that Coastal Division crown — one that has proven elusive since Miami (3-1) joined the Atlantic Coast Conference — begins in earnest, since the game also happens to be the Hurricanes' ACC opener. \nPerhaps no yearly matchup in college football has spawned a greater collection of NFL-caliber talent--certainly over the past three decades--than the annual Miami Hurricanes-Florida State Seminoles game. Here are a collection of the series' standout performances----throughout a game, or even in a crucial moment of a win. (Steve Svekis) \nAdd to all of that the fact that Miami hasn't been able to bounce back from its losses to FSU (4-0) in each of the last two seasons and Saturday has all the makings of a \"must-win\" game. And while Golden has acknowledged how important – and emotionally charged – he expects this matchup to be, he hasn't wanted the stage too get too overwhelming for his relatively young team. \n\"The mental aspect of the game is a big part of it and you can't extricate that from the physical,\" Golden said earlier this week. \"It's going to be a physical game Saturday night. It's going to be an emotional game. But we have to control the things that we can control if we want to be a good team and we want to win in that environment. That's what these guys are trying to do.\" \nFor the Hurricanes, part of that control has included preparing for injured FSU running back Dalvin Cook, who hurt his hamstring in the Seminoles' 24-16 win over Wake Forest last week. After missing workouts early in the week, Cook – eighth nationally with 570 rushing yards – returned to practice Thursday. Although how effective he'll be remains a mystery, Miami's defenders haven't forgotten his performance last year, which included scoring the go-ahead touchdown on a 26-yard run with 3:05 left. \nMiami's offense will counter with Kaaya, who enters the game having completed 61 percent of his passes for 1,094 yards with five touchdowns, and Cook's high school teammate at Miami Central, running back Joe Yearby, who leads the Hurricanes with 424 rushing yards. \nThe hope is the pair can help Miami snap its losing streak to the Seminoles. \nAnd for Miami's seniors, that would be the perfect way to bounce back after last week's loss. \n\"This would mean a lot to us. This is why you come to Miami, to play games like this,\" linebacker Raphael Kirby said. \"As a senior class, we understand this is our last shot. It's our last shot at beating them, and we came here to beat these guys. I'll be danged if we leave here without beating them.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T02:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T09:28:53.860+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
