SANDERFORD • TIMES RECORD Charleston center Robert White places a pink ribbon on a Charleston football helmet as it sits next to a Lavaca helmet on Thursday, Oct. 22, 2015 in Charleston. The ribbons that have the initials M.S. are in honor of Murna Scott, and Breast Cancer Awareness Month. By Kevin TaylorTimes Record • ktaylor@swtimes.com \nA kind gesture from a member of the Life Church of Charleston led to longtime rivals Lavaca and Charleston agreeing to wear helmet stickers in honor of October Breast Cancer Awareness month during today’s annual football rivalry game. \nMrs. Murna Scott passed away Monday from complications due to breast cancer. She was a staunch supporter of Charleston athletics. Her twin sons, Garrett and Damon Scott, played football at Charleston. \nBoth Tigers coach Greg Kendrick and Lavaca coach Schlinker were made aware of the gesture by one of Life Church of Charleston’s members, Lavaca resident Mark Andrews. \n“There are some things that transcend a rivalry, and this is one of those things,” Schlinker said. \nCharleston and Lavaca are locked in a tough 3A-4 playoff race, with the Tigers boasting a 3-1 league record and Lavaca sporting a 1-3 mark. \nAndrews took his idea to Righteous Rebel Printing in Barling. They supplied the decals at no cost. \nBoth schools happily agreed to put them on their helmets. \n“She had two sons, Damon and Garrett, play for us,” Kendrick said. “For us to get that opportunity to honor her is great. She’s had an impact on this community, as well as Lavaca.” \n“What I like about it is a lot of times kids get caught up wearing pink socks and pink wristbands and may forget what we’re honoring,” Schlinker said. “We try to remind them what it’s about. This is close to home, and this is a great way to honor such an important event.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T13:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T15:18:39.074+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
