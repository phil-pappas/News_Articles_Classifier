THE CANADIAN PRESS/Graham Hughes \nMONTREAL - Jeff Mathews threw a touchdown pass to Terrell Sinkfield as the Hamilton Tiger-Cats took over top spot in the CFL East Division and ended a 13-year winless run in Montreal with a 23-11 victory over the Alouettes on Sunday afternoon. \nJustin Medlock added five field goals and missed another for a single for the Tiger-Cats (10-5), who posted a fourth straight road victory and spoiled the Alouettes debut of veteran quarterback Kevin Glenn. They beat Montreal for the first time in three meetings this season. \nThe last time the Ticats won in the regular season in Montreal was a 29-26 decision on Oct. 20, 2002. They lost on their next 18 visits. The Ticats topped Montreal in the playoffs the last two seasons, however. \nFred Stamps caught a TD pass with 1.3 seconds left in regulation time and Boris Bede had a field goal for Montreal (5-10), which lost a fourth game in a row and fell to 2-5 since general manager Jim Popp took over as head coach. \nThe Alouettes still hope to make the playoffs via crossover by finishing ahead of the bottom three West Division clubs. \nA crowd of 23,058 at Percival Molson Stadium saw Glenn, acquired this week from Saskatchewan after starter Rakeem Cato was injured, throw three interceptions while only generating one touchdown, when he hit Stamps with a 16-yard toss with the game all but over. \nLight snow fell through a first quarter in which the only scoring was a 15-yard Medlock field goal on Hamilton's first possession. A Simoni Lawrence interception set up a 30-yard Medlock boot 3:28 into the second quarter. \nMike Daly blocked a Bede punt and Frederic Plesius recovered to give Hamilton the ball on the Montreal eight, setting up a three-yard TD strike to Sinkfield at 5:47 by Mathews, who made his third start in place of injured Zach Collaros. \nThe Alouettes picked up a safety in the last minute of the half after Winston Venable blocked a punt and John Bowman recovered. Bede had trapped the Ticats inside their five with a punt. \nConsecutive Hamilton drives produced Medlock field goals to open the second half before Glenn led a 10-play drive capped by Bede's 26-yard boot at 14:50. \nHamilton running back Michael Ford (lower body) and Lawrence (upper Body) left the game late in the first half, as did Montreal linebacker Kyries Hebert (upper body). \nThe Ticats had receiver Andy Fantuz back after missing nine games with an elbow injury and ex-Alouette guard Ryan Bomben returned from a five-game absence with a lower body injury. Mike Edem, acquired from Montreal this week, played special teams. \nThe longest losing streak by a team in an opponent's stadium is 20 by Saskatchewan at Calgary (1990-2001). Ottawa's football teams combined to lose 20 in a row at Edmonton (1984-2015). \nGlenn was given No. 6 when he joined the Alouettes, but he switched with backup Anthony Boone to get his usual No. 5.
