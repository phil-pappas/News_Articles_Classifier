The woman told police she ran away.\nOn Tuesday afternoon, police say a man matching the same description followed a young woman home from the Oregon State University campus. The woman went into her home but police say she later saw the naked man masturbating across the street.\nThe woman called friends who came to the house and photographed him. He then left on a longboard, which is a longer version of a skateboard.\nAnyone with information about the incidents is asked to call Corvallis police at 541-766-6924 or 541-766-6911.\n-- The Associated Press", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T16:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T00:31:57.271+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
