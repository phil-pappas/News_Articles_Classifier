Sheldon Gant picked off a pass and returned it 20 yards for a score to give the Bucks a 22-0 lead after one quarter. \nYankton continued its offensive outburst in the second quarter. Jared Rafferty hit a 26-yard field goal, Sheldon Gant scored on a 21-yard run and Nate Stephenson hit Brendan Caskey for a 38-yard score to give the Bucks a 38-0 lead at the half. \nCaskey then opened the third quarter with a 31-yard touchdown run to give the Bucks a 45-0 cushion. \nHuron (2-5) got its offense going after that, scoring on a Hyland Heinz 43-yard touchdown pass to Greg Conrad. Alex Hill later scored a pair of rushing touchdowns, to cut the final margin to 45-18. \nCaskey finished the game with 78 rushing yards on 15 carries. \nYankton, now 4-3 on the season, returns home to face Douglas next Friday night.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T06:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T11:31:18.283+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
