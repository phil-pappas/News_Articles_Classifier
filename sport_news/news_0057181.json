It’s Valencia’s 12th title in the last 14 years. \n“I lost four important seniors from last year and for us to come back and win it again this year was really big for us,” said Valencia head coach Annie Kellogg, whose team graduated four All-SCV performers from 2014. \nValencia (15-3 overall, 9-0 in Foothill) will go for a second consecutive 10-0 league run on Thursday at Hart. \nTuesday, the Vikings were led by the doubles team of Gianna Benitez and Lauren Wolf, which swept three sets, 6-2, 6-0, 6-0. \nValencia won six sets on the singles side, losing only those against Canyon’s Katrina DeGuzman. \nThe Cowboys senior beat Jennifer Shin 6-1, Kate Zeile 6-3 and Amanda Tabanera 6-1. \nNo easy task. \n“I can’t believe how much confidence and calm she’s playing with,” Kellogg said of DeGuzman. “Her serve is so improved.” \nZeile and Shin both won two sets for Valencia. \nCanyon (7-8, 3-6) will try and fend off Saugus (one match back in the league standings) on Thursday for fourth place in the Foothill standings and a potential postseason berth. \nWest Ranch 15, Saugus 3 \nSomething became pretty clear on Tuesday at West Ranch High. Something else lost a little clarity. \nThe West Ranch Wildcats girls tennis team (13-3, 7-2) moved one step closer to a solo second place finish in the Foothill League with a dominating win over Saugus (6-10, 2-7). \nA Cats’ win against last-place Golden Valley or a Hart loss to first-place Valencia on Thursday would secure West Ranch’s solo finish ahead of the Indians. That much is sure. \nThe league’s doubles title, on the other hand, got more interesting Tuesday. \nThe Centurions’ three set wins came from the doubles team of Megan Cho and Carlie Ozaki. And that included a 7-6 (7-4) tiebreaker win over Olivia Bloome and Brittany Waugh, the perceived doubles favorites heading into next week’s league individual tournament. \nIt was Bloome and Waugh’s first Foothill loss of the season. \nEnter intrigue. \nBut Tuesday belonged to the Wildcats, who lost only one game on the singles side, sweeping all nine sets. \n“I’m exited,” Wildcats head coach Dina McBride said of a top two finish. “That was our goal coming into the season. ... Next year our goal is to win league. We’re in a two-year process right now.” \nUna Stanisavljevic won three sets, while Julia van der Colff and Emily Andrews won two sets each for the Wildcats before being subbed out. \nBloome and Waugh recovered to win their final two sets, 6-1, 6-1. \nQuinterra Walter-Eze — normally West Ranch’s No. 1 single — played doubles with Cori Raffish, losing 6-0 to Cho and Ozaki but winning the other two sets 6-0, 6-0. \nThe duo will remain together at league prelims, McBride said. \nHart 16, Golden Valley 2 \nThe Indians swept in singles to stay alive in the race for second place in the Foothill League. \nHart (9-7, 6-3) will need to beat Valencia Thursday and hope for a West Ranch loss just to tie. \nNicole Alvarez and Cami Hernandez swept three sets each for the Indians Tuesday. \nHart’s Natalia Munoz won two sets before being subbed out. \nOn the doubles side, the Indians got three set sweeps from the pairing of Cassidy Wilkinson and Alex LaForteza, and from Abby Morris and Zobia Quraishi. \nGolden Valley moved to 1-15 overall and 0-9 in league play.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T07:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T11:15:24.925+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
