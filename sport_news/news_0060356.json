Paris Saint-Germain versus Real Madrid was billed as the marquee game of the Champions League round this week. Famous and fashionable people were flown in to sit in the stand, but as rain swept relentlessly down on the Parc des Princes, the teams ground out a soggy tie that was both goalless and guileless. Cristiano Ronaldo and Zlatan Ibrahimovic were on the field, but as close to anonymous as these two players could get. Ronaldo, who was described before the event by the Paris manager Laurent Blanc as “one of the two extraterrestrials gracing the modern game,” had one of his sulky nights and squandered the game’s best chance to score by shooting woefully wide. Ibrahimovic never got that close to goal. He hid himself away in deep midfield, trotting around the center circle, looking like an aging superstar going through the motions of athletic performance. Indeed, among the invited guests was Ronaldo de Lima, the original Ronaldo from Brazil. Now 39 and comfortably above his playing weight, one couldn’t help but think that even in his overcoat this once great goalscorer might have been invited down to break the deadlock on the field. Alas, no. Madrid’s excuse for this boredom, which was the first time in eight years that its team failed to score at this stage in the Champions League, was that its starting lineup was deprived through injuries to some leading talents: Karim Benzema, Gareth Bale, James Rodríguez and Luka Modric. Poor Cristiano was made to play with their stand-ins and to earn his salary alongside makeweights. Yet according to the latest report by Global Sports Salaries Survey, these two clubs, Real and PSG, pay the highest wages in the whole of world sports — including the giant American baseball, basketball and N.F.L. teams. Paris averages about $9 million per man, Madrid about $ 8.6 million, and after that the scale descends through Manchester City, Barcelona, the Los Angeles Dodgers and — some way down the list — the New York Yankees and the Brooklyn Nets. Endorsement earnings, especially for the American superstars and the likes of Cristiano, would probably rearrange some of that wealth chart. But these are projected salaries for playing the game, and it can be argued that those at the Parc des Princes on Wednesday shortchanged their audience. Not one player did as Kevin De Bruyne, the new man at Manchester City, did late in City’s home game against Sevilla. When his team was struggling to strike, De Bruyne was switched from the wing to lead the attack and he controlled the ball with his right foot, swerved inside a defender, and curled the ball low inside the far post with his left foot. That is what really top players do. They change the course of matches; they fashion chances out of nothing, and they finish with aplomb. No one in Paris did that because no one dared. \nAdvertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T14:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T14:48:07.388+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
