I grew up on the corner of North Heights and Ohio Avenue and we’d gather to watch the band, cheerleaders and majorettes march past my house on the way to Rayen Stadium. We’d then run up North Heights to Fifth Avenue in order to wave to the team bus, all the while jumping in the leaves while pretending to catch a touchdown pass as if we were in the game.” \nFall in the Midwest still appeals to the Modern Family and Married with Children star. \n“One of my idols was Paul Fleming and I remember guys like John Rorick, John Green and Fred Moosally, all of whom were tough as nails,” he added. “We’d eat at the Golden Dawn the week of the game and then at DeMain’s Royal Oaks and everyone wished us good luck. You knew the pressure and you played for those before you because they were in the stands rooting us on. You didn’t want to disappoint anyone and both teams literally left everything they had on the field.” \nFormer Cardinals standout Bob Stoops, current University of Oklahoma Sooners head football coach, still follows football in the Mahoning Valley and especially their annual game with the Fighting Irish. \n“It’s exciting to know that the Mooney-Ursuline rivalry continues. These two schools are prominent programs in the Youngstown area with long, traditions of success,” Stoops noted. “It will be great for the entire community to experience this game and I wish both teams the best of luck.” \nPlay-off implications aside, both teams want to win in order to gather some momentum for what they hope will be a deep, post-season run. \nUrsuline (4-4) enters as the visiting team, is 3-2 in road games this season but coming off a 23-21, come-from-behind victory over the Boardman Spartans \n“I’m only 12 years into this rivalry but you understand early on what it means to both schools’ communities. My phone hasn’t stopped ringing since last Friday night after our game with Boardman,” Fighting Irish head mentor Larry Kempe stated. “Alums just wanted to remind me that it is Mooney week, as if I might forget. Both schools are in very similar situations for the play-offs and as I watch film, they’re a lot like us. When they’re healthy and playing at their best, they’re a very good football team and so are we.” \nThe Cardinals will come in 4-3 overall, riding a two-game winning streak and a 27-19 victory over Warren Harding, a game in which they racked up an area code (330) of ground yards. \n“Every week is a big week so from a football standpoint, the key is to prepare like any other week. Everyone has a role, from parents to the student body to alumni and most of all the players, who just need to keep their focus,” Cardinal Mooney head coach P.J. Fecko said. “It’s a longstanding tradition between two great schools and programs.” \nFecko has been a part of the rivalry as either a player, assistant or head coach all but one year (1993) since 1989 and is 18-9 in 27 games played. \nCardinal Mooney tight Andrew Armstrong is a St. Christine’s alum who chose the Cardinals. \n“We all know each other, have played with and against each other so it will come down to who wants it more,” he noted. “They’re big and strong so we have to be just as physical.” \nFighting Irish center and defensive lineman Giacomo Cappabianca is another St. Christine’s product. \n“In eighth grade we had a decision to make and it was the toughest decision of our lives,” he added. “You tend to go where your friends go and I chose Ursuline because of the tradition. It was the right for me. The game will probably come down to a big play, perhaps a touchdown, interception, fumble or even a punt return, but a big play could be the deciding factor.” \nCappabianca’s teammates, Jabbar Price and Kimauni Johnson, don’t want to graduate having lost three consecutive contests to their crosstown rivals. \n“Coach [Larry] Kempe and staff might look at it as another game and we won’t look ahead, but it is Mooney week and something that is very, very special. This is my last chance to get to .500 before I graduate,” Price noted. \nJohnson is also playing a fourth time in the rivalry.” \n“They’re in our division [IV] and we’d see each other in the play-offs, so as much as they want to get a good look at us, we also want to get a good look at them,” he stated. \nCardinal Mooney running back Ray Anderson (154) and quarterback Jack Lynch (142) enter game on the heels of 100-yard rushing efforts. \n“This rivalry brings out the best in everyone. Fans dress up, there’s a different theme each day and whoever stays focused and has the most in their tank at the end of the game will be the winner,” Anderson said. \nLynch has a team best five rushing tallies this season for the Cardinals. \n“We need to win in order to remain in the play-off hunt so it’s do or die,” he added. “It’s been a fun week and the atmosphere in school has just been absolutely fantastic.” \nUrsuline athletic director Sean Durkin perhaps put the rivalry in the proper perspective. \n“It’s an extremely exciting week here. The entire school community is involved for weeks in preparation, from decorating the building, to the rally on Thursday and the tailgate party on Friday night,” he said. “Add the fact that this year’s game has extreme playoff implications and that should make Friday night that more exciting.” \nKickoff is 7:30 p.m.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T07:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T07:51:41.374+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
