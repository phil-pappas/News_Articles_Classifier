Burnett, chairman of the Nevada Gaming Control Board, said all unlicensed daily fantasy activities must cease and desist as of Thursday. Operators could be invited to apply for a gaming license. Those who do not comply could face felony fines and 10 years in prison. \n\"We are saying that daily fantasy sports are a gambling game under the statutory definition,\" Burnett told ESPN on Thursday night. \"We're also saying that these are sports pools, which is when someone is in the business of accepting wagers on sporting events through any system or method of wagering. We have found that it is a wager, and obviously, it's on a sporting event, and DFS companies are in the business of accepting those wagers.\" \nFanDuel and DraftKings, the two most prominent daily fantasy operators, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. \nDaily fantasy operators have been persistent that they are a game of skill and not a form of gambling, but the skill argument did not play a role in Burnett's analysis. \n\"A lot of people have the idea that all of gambling is determined by skill versus chance,\" Burnett said. \"That's just not the case, because in a state like Nevada, our statutes and definitions override that.\" \nThe American Gaming Association issued the following statement in response to the ruling: \n\"The casino gaming industry has repeatedly called for greater legal clarity on daily fantasy sports. We appreciate that the Nevada Gaming Control Board has provided that clarity as well as a roadmap for DFS companies and casinos to provide popular fantasy sports within Nevada borders. We will continue to seek additional clarity in other jurisdictions, as eliminating ambiguity is in the best interests of all parties, including consumers.\" \nThe decision comes amid growing backlash by regulators and investigators, including New York's attorney general, after it was revealed employees often played on competing sites, raising questions about possible insider information being used to win. \nNevada regulators govern the country's main gambling hub in Las Vegas, and their actions could hold sway with regulators elsewhere. \nAs of late Thursday afternoon, at least some Nevada residents were able to log on to DraftKings and enter contests. \nArizona, Iowa, Louisiana, Montana and Washington are states that currently do not allow daily fantasy sports. Several additional states prohibit some form of daily fantasy. \nInformation from The Associated Press was used in this report. 0 Shares", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T02:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T04:38:04.561+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
