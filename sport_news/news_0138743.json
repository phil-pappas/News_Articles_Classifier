In Smithville, the Born Again Emporium thrift store, run by nine local church congregations, is giving out three days of clothing to those affected by the fires.\nOn Friday morning, three women diligently folded shirts, underwear and other garments in a room of the thrift store at 200 NW Loop 230 in Smithville.\n“We’ll probably give more than we take in today, but that’s what we’re here for,” said Jan Rodwick, a coordinator at the thrift store with St. Paul’s Catholic Church in Smithville.\nTo receive clothing from the Smithville thrift store, people can sign up at the Smithville Recreation Center and receive a voucher. So far, five families with 14 total people have signed up, said Susan Guedry, a coordinator at the thrift store with First Presbyterian.\nIn Bastrop, people can go straight to Bits & Pieces to check in for free clothing, according to the Family Crisis Center.\nBoth locations are checking IDs with streets that have been evacuated and addresses of homes that have been confirmed destroyed.\nThe Born Again Emporium is open from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. Friday and Saturday and Bits & Pieces in Bastrop is open from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. on weekdays and 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. on Saturday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T05:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T06:08:53.332+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
