Fans, media and the football world often push for an immediate resolution at the game’s most critical position, and sometimes there’s not a definitive answer. \nTake Florida, for example. Gators coach Jim McElwain is playing his quarterback situation right down the middle, which is the right call for now. He’s starting Will Grier Saturday against No. 3-ranked Ole Miss, as any coach would after last week’s heroic performance by the freshman. \nGrier engineered two scoring drives in the last 10 minutes of a 28-27 win over Tennessee, capped by a 63-yard TD pass on fourth down to Antonio Callaway with 1:26 remaining. Since backup Treon Harris sat out the UT game under suspension, Grier is the obvious choice, though McElwain remains open to the possibility of using both quarterbacks. \nIn 1993, then UF coach Steve Spurrier found himself in a similar situation to where McElwain is now. He had two quarterbacks — freshman Danny Wuerffel and junior Terry Dean — and no permanent starter. \nAfter Wuerffel delivered his iconic touchdown moment, a 28-yard pass to Chris Doering with three seconds remaining to beat Kentucky 24-20 after replacing the benched Dean, many thought Wuerffel would forever keep the job. \nFor a while, he was the primary starter, until he struggled with a heavy ball against Georgia and Spurrier turned to Dean again. The quarterback race went back and forth for another year, hampered somewhat by Wuerffel’s knee injury that sidelined him for two games to end the ’93 season. \nThe point being, Spurrier didn’t close the door until Dean’s awful performance against Auburn midway through the ’94 season finally put the quarterback issue to rest. Wuerffel quarterbacked four SEC championship teams and won a Heisman Trophy, which is why he has a statue outside Florida Field next to Spurrier and Tim Tebow. \nBut one big moment against Kentucky didn’t earn Wuerffel the permanent job. And neither should Grier, who was below average for three quarters against Tennessee, get that privilege for leading a miracle rally from a 13-point deficit. \n“Part of a young quarterback’s maturation is settling into the game,” said McElwain. “I thought there were times [Grier] moved better in the pocket and didn’t just give up, and yet there were a couple of those ‘Oh, my, what are you doing?’ moments when he just threw it up. He’ll learn.” \nMcElwain wants consistency, and until he sees that from his quarterback, the Gators are better off waiting for a clear No. 1 to emerge. Harris might well be one more off-the-field strike from being an ex-Gator, but his presence is a good thing to keep Grier on edge. \n“Neither of them were particularly effective in the spring or preseason,” said Doering, now a studio analyst for the SEC Network. “I think that competition has driven them to be better. Grier still does things that Coach Mac doesn’t like out of his quarterback. He makes sure to be hard on Grier and build up Treon, too. Plus, you never know when an injury might change things up. \n“I relate everything to what I learned from Spurrier. He was a big believer in John Wooden-isms. Part of that philosophy is the threat of the bench and staying on people out of fear of losing their jobs. Some people disagree, but [Spurrier] applied that same thing to the quarterback. If you didn’t play to his expectation level, he wasn’t afraid to try the next guy. I think Coach Mac is the same way.” \nRemember, the season is young. This 4-0 start by Florida might be fool’s gold, as it was in Will Muschamp’s first season (2011) when the Gators did the same thing, only to lose six of the last nine games without ever having a quality starting quarterback. \nMcElwain knows UF could easily be 2-2 instead of unbeaten. He has no choice but to let this quarterback dilemma play itself out. An effective starting quarterback needs patience. So does the coach picking one.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T16:32:36.480+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
