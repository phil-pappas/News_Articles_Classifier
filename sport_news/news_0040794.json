Martin Luther King Jr. atop Georgia's Stone Mountain is getting a chilly reception from some of the civil rights groups that King worked with.\nThe Southern Christian Leadership Conference, which King co-founded, and the Atlanta and DeKalb branches of the NAACP say they oppose placing a tribute to King near the figures of three Confederate leaders engraved on the mountain outside Atlanta.\nSCLC President Charles Steele said Tuesday that a reference to King doesn't belong near the carving of \"three traitors.\"\nOfficials with the groups say they will meet Wednesday with Georgia Gov. Nathan Deal to discuss the issue.\nA Confederate heritage group also has opposed the King monument at Stone Mountain.\nThe Atlanta Journal-Constitution first reported on the proposal Sunday.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
