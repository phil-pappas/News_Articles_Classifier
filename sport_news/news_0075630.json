Saturday at Darlington County Park, Mahwah \nDIVISION A \nRace starts : 10:45 a.m.\nTeams : Dwight-Englewood, Holy Angels, Immaculate Conception, IHA, Paramus Catholic, Queen of Peace, Saddle River Day, St. Mary.\nFavorites : IHA, Holy Angels, Paramus Catholic.\nReturning Top-10 finishers : Giavanna Tabbachino, IHA (8th); Tara Lyons, Holy Angels (7th in B); Tara Satnick, Dwight-Englewood (5th in D).\nOther contenders : Megan Brockmeier, Jill Neggia and Caitlin McPartland, IHA; Rhiannon Novelli, Mackenzie Hughes and Grace Jansson, Holy Angels; Katerina Harte, Paramus Catholic.\nHow the race will go : IHA already has beaten Holy Angels twice this year, and in this smallest of groups (only four full teams are expected to run), could make it three straight. IHA should win its first division title since 2009 and Holy Angels might not win one for the first time since 2004.\nDIVISION B \nRace starts : 11 a.m.\nTeams : Bergenfield, Bergen Tech, Fair Lawn, Hackensack, Indian Hills, Northern Highlands, NV/Old Tappan, Paramus, Ridgewood, Teaneck.\nFavorites : Ridgewood, Northern Highlands, NV/Old Tappan, Indian Hills, Bergen Tech.\nReturning Top-10 finishers : Monica Hebner, Northern Highlands (3rd in B); Sam Halvorsen, Ridgewood (4th in B); Olympia Martin, Ridgewood (5th in B); Michelle Kubasek, Bergen Tech (7th in B); Jodi Hinchen, Northern Highlands (9th in B); Abigail McLaughlin, Bergen Tech (10th in B); Julia Guerra, Indian Hills (1st in B); Kadreya Simeon, Hackensack (5th in B at Tenafly last year).\nOther contenders : Courtney Brunet, NV/Old Tappan; Isabel Hebner and Paige Wilderotter, Northern Highlands; Serena Martinez, Hackensack.\nHow the race will go : If Hinchen is healthy, the Highlanders have a shot at their first division title in 20 years. If she’s not, Ridgewood could win its sixth straight title and record 30th overall. NV/Old Tappan should grab a wild card, with Indian Hills and Bergen Tech in the mix for a wild card as well. Guerra is running as well as she ever has in her great career, and if the weather cooperates, could make a bid for the course record of 17:29.\nDIVISION C \nRace starts : 11:15 a.m.\nTeams : Cliffside Park, NV/Demarest, Dwight Morrow, Fort Lee, Garfield, Pascack Valley, Ramapo, Ridgefield Park, River Dell, Tenafly.\nFavorites : River Dell, Pascack Valley, Ramapo, Tenafly, NV/Demarest, Cliffside Park, Garfield.\nReturning Top-10 finishers : Alexandra Harris, Ramapo (4th in B); Ashley Evans, Pascack Valley (6th in B); Nikki Criscuolo, Pascack Valley (9th in B); Shannon Goria, River Dell (10th in B).\nOther contenders : Ines Greenway, Tenafly; Courtney Geisenheimer, NV/Demarest; Ginger Pojednic and Nicole Muscat, River Dell; Jennifer Polo, Cliffside Park; Marlo Guastella, Pascack Valley.\nHow the race will go : River Dell last won a county division title when it won Group 2 in 1985. The Golden Hawks should coast to the win this year. Pascack Valley has a slight edge over Ramapo, Tenafly, NV/Demarest and Cliffside Park for the second automatic spot. The scramble for the wild cards will be wild. Goria already has broken the school record at Holmdel and Garret Mountain set by her coach, Briana Bayersdorfer, and on Saturday, should break the Darlington record of 19:19 run by Bayersdorfer in 1998 to win her first title.\nDIVISION D \nRace starts : 1:25 p.m.\nTeams : Dumont, Glen Rock, Leonia, Lyndhurst, Mahwah, New Milford, Park Ridge/Emerson, Pascack Hills, Ramsey, Rutherford, Westwood.\nFavorites : Ramsey, Glen Rock, Park Ridge/Emerson, Pascack Hills, Mahwah.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T02:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T07:30:07.373+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
