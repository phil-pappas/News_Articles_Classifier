The wicketkeeper has scored 27 runs in three innings this series and has also been clumsy in the field. \nJonny Bairstow could take over the gloves and another batsman come in -- perhaps opener Alex Hales -- which would allow Moeen Ali to return to the middle order. \nYet Root was adamant that Buttler will come good. \n“I think he will be disappointed after today, but he’s a fine player and I expect him to bounce back because that’s what great players do,” added Root. \n“I can see him scoring many runs for England in the future.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T18:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T19:11:15.722+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
