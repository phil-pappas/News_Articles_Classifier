The first goal wasn’t a power-play goal but it came two seconds after a power play expired and that got us going. We were able to build on the lead and played well defensively.\" \nHawryluk opened the scoring after an early Brandon power play had ended when he knocked in a rebound. Before the period ended, he had knocked in two more rebounds on the power play for the natural hat trick. \nJohn Quenneville wired a shot in early in the second on another power play and Hawryluk added his fourth goal of the game, again with the man advantage, just over a minute later. Reid Duke made it 6-0 late in the second with a nice shot from the slot that he created off the rush. \nJordan Papirny, making his fourth straight start of the young season, stopped 16 shots for his seventh career shutout. He had five last season. \nQuenneville ended up with a goal and two assists, Nolan Patrick had three assists and Hawryluk added an assist for a five-point night. \nICINGS:  Wheat King F Rihards Bukarts has been suspended by the WHL for a dangerous hit from behind on Friday against the Calgary Hitmen that earned him a major and game misconduct.
