(Getty Images) By Rufus Peabody and Will Leitch \nLast week on Man vs. Machine -- an idiot who is barely able to write his name in the ground with a stick, picking against the NFL point spread, against an intelligent algorithm produced by some of the finest minds in football analytics -- the Machine got two of its top five picks correct. Overall last week, Will got two picks correct against the spread vs. four total for the Machine. \nThe eternal battle between robots and humanity re-commences here. Nothing less than the survival of our species is at stake. Let's hear from our \"Machine,\" Rufus Peabody. \n* * * \nPredicting NFL games is difficult. Sure, some teams are certainly much better than others. We know that. The difficult part is predicting how they will perform each week relative to expectation. Even the most optimistic Panthers fan wouldn't realistically have predicted a victory in Seattle. And even if you expected the Dolphins to win last week, they certainly aren't fundamentally 28 points better than the Titans. \nTrying to identify which teams will over and underachieve each week is what makes forecasting so difficult in the NFL; it's also what makes it so much fun. You'll hear touts spew facts such as \"Team X is 10-2 against the spread in its last 12 games coming off a double-digit loss when facing a divisional opponent.\" These trends are completely meaningless. They're an example of the human tendency to be fooled by randomness -- to see patterns where none truly exist. I heard many theories last week suggesting that the Patriots had added motivation to blow out the Colts because of the latter's role in Deflategate. Sure, these types of narratives are enticing, but they are rarely supported by the data, and we tend to remember the times things did turn out the way we theorized and ignore the times they didn't. \nWhat's ironic is that the best way to predict football games involves doing less work. Look at the quality of the two teams, add in home-field advantage, and you're done. Massey-Peabody has been very successful doing just that the last six seasons. Rather than chase the dream of explaining random fluctuations in performance, we've spent our time trying to more precisely gauge the mean from which that performance will vary. \nAcademics have a term for what I'm referring to -- \"irreducible uncertainty.\" It applies to situations that are not perfectly predictable. It's the coin-flip part of the equation, and it means some part of what is going to transpire is simply beyond your ken. Accepting that is tough, yet freeing -- it points you away from stories and toward models. It also makes you a better forecaster. -- Rufus Peabody \n(Home teams are spelled out with all caps. The win probability percentage for each team is in parentheses on the Machine's line. NOTE: Those WP percentages do not indicate confidence against the spread, it just basically tells you which teams the algorithm likes to win the game outright. So if you are in a survivor pool, for instance, you might just want to ignore the scores we predicted and just go by percentages. In any case, these are listed in order of confidence against the spread, not confidence in outright winners. Hope that's clear!) Five most confident picks against the spread from the \"Machine\" \nMan: LIONS 31, Vikings 20 \nIt would be just like the Lions to go on a win streak now . \nMachine: LIONS (62 percent) 24, Vikings 20 \nThe Vikings offense relies heavily on its running game -- rated second-best in the NFL a week ago by Massey-Peabody -- so rushing for only 79 yards on 32 attempts at home against a mediocre run defense is alarming. \nVegas: Lions -2.5 \nMan: COLTS 24, Saints 16 \nYou're better off just watching Super Bowl XLIV again. Or just That Play . \nMachine: COLTS (58 percent) 27, Saints 25 \nMathematically, the Colts made the right decision to go for it on fourth-and-3 in the third quarter against the Patriots last week. Personally, I would have gone with a different play call. Jim Zorn wants to know if he'll still get paid his consulting fee. \nVegas: Colts -4.5 \n---- \nMan: GIANTS 21, Cowboys 18 \nNo real logic behind this pick, except that this division makes so little sense that I'm just coin flipping at this point. So: heads. Giants. \nMachine: GIANTS (56 percent) 22, Cowboys 21 \nFor all the talk of Brandon Weeden checking down too much, he has averaged 10.4 yards per completion this season, better than Tony Romo, and Weeden's 7.5 yards per attempt lag only slightly behind Romo's 7.7. But Weeden is 0-3 as a starter this year, so he must be the scapegoat. \nVegas: Giants -3.5 \n---- \nMan: PATRIOTS 34, Jets 16 \nThis is as competitive as this series gets … and it's still less fun without Rex Ryan. \nMachine: PATRIOTS 29 (81 percent), Jets 18 \nInterceptions are credited to quarterbacks, but how often are they really the result of a poor decision or poor throw rather than a tipped ball, miscommunication, receiver falling down or jump ball? Tom Brady's interception-free first four games were very impressive, but also very lucky. Sure enough, his first interception of 2015 was a 100 percent Edel-fail. \nVegas: Patriots -9 \nMan: Steelers 19, CHIEFS 7 \nYou see, Steelers fans, Landry Jones was the answer in your hearts all along! \nMachine: CHIEFS (62 percent) 22, Steelers 19 \nHere are some facts about Jones: He was a fourth-round pick in the 2013 NFL draft, he did not play a single snap his first two seasons, and he barely made the Steelers' roster this season as the team's third-string QB. But I guess we should forget all that and only look at the 12 NFL passes he's thrown. \nVegas: Steelers -2 The rest of the slate (listed in order of Machine \"confidence\" ATS) \nMan: Falcons 24, TITANS 10 \nMarcus Mariota is starting to learn that the NFL is a lot harder than it looked in Week 1, particularly when you play for the Titans. \nMachine: Falcons (69 percent) 27, TITANS 21 \nMariota's incredible Week 1 performance is a distant memory. Tennessee rates significantly below average on both sides of the ball in all four statistical categories Massey-Peabody uses -- passing efficiency, rushing efficiency, scoring efficiency and play success. The 2015 Tennessee Titans: Still employing Ken Whisenhunt. \nVegas: Falcons -4 \n---- \nMan: Texans 17, DOLPHINS 9 \nIs there a Dolphins bandwagon after last week? That would be hilarious. Anyway, if there is one, jump off it. \nMachine: DOLPHINS (66 percent) 25, Texans 20 \nI know what happens in garbage time matters little, but good teams are able to put away bad teams and not allow them a glimmer of hope. The Dolphins showed a lot in doing that last week. \nVegas: Dolphins -4 \n---- \nMan: CARDINALS 34, Ravens 20 \nLast week's hiccup aside, the Cardinals should feast on the Ravens' poor pass defense. If you want, you can watch the \"Star Wars\" trailer again at halftime. \nMachine: CARDINALS (71 percent) 28, Ravens 21 \nAll six Ravens games this season have been decided by less than a touchdown. Five of six Cardinals games have been decided by double-digits. What does that mean? Nothing. I just needed something to write. \nVegas: Cardinals -7.5 \n---- \nMan: PANTHERS 31, Eagles 28 \nThe Panthers' schedule is about to get tough. They've got this game, the Colts and the Packers, all at home, the next three weeks. If they can get two out of three, look out. \nMachine: PANTHERS (60 percent) 24, Eagles 21 \nYour 2015 Carolina Panthers retain the title of NFL's most boring team (they're also still undefeated). They make up for it by having the least boring Spanish radio announcer . \nVegas: Panthers -3.5 \n---- \nMan: RAMS 24, Browns 23 \nI bet this will be the most exciting game of the weekend that you don't notice is going on until it's almost over. \nMachine: RAMS (65 percent) 23, Browns 18 \nWith the emergence of Todd Gurley and a quietly very good defense, maybe the Rams can finish their tenure in St. Louis by being average. \nVegas: Rams -5.5 \nMan: CHARGERS 34, Raiders 29 \nPhilip Rivers should go for 600 this week. (Yards, Rivers, not children.) \nMachine: CHARGERS (65 percent) 25, Raiders 20 \nPhilip Rivers has led a very good passing attack, but the Chargers can't run the ball or stop the run -- they are averaging 3.6 yards per rush, and giving up 5.4. \nVegas: Chargers -4 \n---- \nMan: REDSKINS 20, Buccaneers 19 \nWashington is closer to first place than the Seahawks, Steelers, Chargers and Rams. In that division, why not them? \nMachine: REDSKINS (62 percent) 24, Buccaneers 20 \nJust how dysfunctional is the Redskins organization? They continue to play an alarmingly bad quarterback because the better quarterback (Robert Griffin III) would be due $16 million next year if he got hurt. So why is RG3 playing safety on the scout team? \nVegas: Redskins -3 \n---- \nMan: Bills 21, Jaguars 17 \nThe Jaguars have been intelligently and prudently constructed under the current regime in a way they haven't in years … and it hasn't made a lick of difference. Will anyone want to coach this team next year? Will anyone even bother coming back from England? \nMachine: Bills (63 percent) 24, Jaguars 20 \nHow often have the Jaguars played in London? Well, let's just say that their players are on a first-name basis with plenty of local bartenders. \nVegas: Bills -6 \n---- \nMan: Seahawks 27, 49ERS 13 \nI'm so entranced by Seattle's run the past two years that I might keep overrating them long after everyone currently on the roster is retired. \nMachine: Seahawks (70 percent) 23, 49ERS 17 \nWho cares that he's a game manager … Russell Wilson is a great QB because his teams win! Oh, wait, that argument doesn't work this year. \nVegas: Seahawks -6", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T09:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T20:07:51.280+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
