Spurrier resigns, takes blame for South Carolina's slide South Carolina head football coach Steve Spurrier speaks during a news conference to announce he is resigning on Tuesday, Oct. 13, 2015, at the University Of South Carolina, in Columbia, S.C. Spurrier said he felt he needed to step down now because he doesn't believe there is accountability with players if they know the coach won't be back next year. He also said he was a recruiting liability. He had never had a losing season in 25 previous seasons coach at Duke (1987-89), Florida (1990-2001) or South Carolina, where he has been since 2005.
