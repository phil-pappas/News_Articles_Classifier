And the Jaguars never let up. \nIsaiah Morris scored five touchdowns as third-ranked Desert Pines routed host Del Sol 76-6. \n\"Isaiah is a very special talent,\" Desert Pines coach Tico Rodriguez said. \"He's dynamic whenever he touches the ball. He can do a little bit of everything.\" \nMorris scored on a 29-yard run on the Jaguars' first play, and the team added five more touchdowns in the first quarter to take a 42-0 lead. \nDesert Pines (7-0, 5-0 Sunrise League) continued to pour it on in the second quarter, going for two after a 25-yard TD run by Amari Calvillo-Tatum to make the score 50-0 early in the quarter. \nMorris added TD runs of 5 and 10 yards in the second quarter as the Jaguars took a 63-0 halftime lead. \n\"We really did not try to do that,\" Rodriguez said about the lopsided score. \"I really feel bad for coach (Gary) Maki. He's got a young team. After the first quarter, we pulled our starters. It's just our second unit is really talented. Eight minutes to go in the game, we were taking a knee.\" \nDesert Pines had 430 total yards at halftime and held Del Sol to 1 rushing yard. \nMorris returned the second-half kick 55 yards for a touchdown. He finished with five carries for 130 yards and three scores and also hauled in a 48-yard scoring strike from Marckell Grayson in the first quarter. \nGrayson rushed for 103 yards, including a 29-yard touchdown, on just three carries. He also completed three of six passes for 111 yards. The Jaguars finished with 447 yards of offense on only 24 plays. \nDel Sol (1-6, 1-4) ruined the shutout when Bo Beagle connected with Jonathan Spearman for an 8-yard touchdown pass as time expired. \nBeagle completed 10 of 31 passes for 126 yards, and Spearman caught four passes for 56 yards for the Dragons, who finished with 30 rushing yards. \nComment section guidelines The below comment section contains thoughts and opinions from users that in no way represent the views of the Las Vegas Review-Journal or GateHouse Media.
