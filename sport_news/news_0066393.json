Today, 5 p.m., at Clifton No. 2 Clifton (19-5) vs. No. 1 Wayne Valley (18-4) \nStory line: Underdog Clifton seeks a record 13th county title and its first since 2007. The Mustangs’ strengths are serving and defense and senior L Jamie Marchioni and Co. must serve well to spots and pass well to keep Wayne Valley off balance. Wayne Valley seeks a fifth title and its first since 2009. The Indians are deep and well-balanced, feature two All-Passaic seniors, M Olivia Pantale and L Olivia Lozy, and possess the firepower to dominate. Wayne Valley defeated visiting Clifton last month, 25-21, 25-19, as well as earning single-game wins in the Clifton Invitational semifinals and Passaic Invitational final. © 2015 North Jersey Media Group Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T06:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T08:33:19.806+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
