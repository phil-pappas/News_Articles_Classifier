For a few years now, the players on the Portsmouth High School field hockey team have worked together, taken their lumps together, improved together and suffered heartbreak together. Now, they’re going to the final four together. The third-seeded Clippers made a goal from junior midfielder Haily Blodgett nine minutes in stand up in their Division II quarterfinal game against No. 11 Hanover on Saturday, fending off a late assault from their opponent to secure a 1-0 win. In the semifinals for the first time since 2008, the Clippers (12-2-1) will face No. 7 Kennett on Wednesday at Exeter High School. “It’s amazing,” said senior forward Katie Locandro, who got the scoring play in motion. “Freshman year we were 3-11. To be in this situation going to the final four is awesome. I wouldn’t want to do it with anyone else.” The Clippers and Kennett (9-4-3), which upset No. 2 Windham in its quarterfinal Saturday, played to a 1-1 tie in North Conway late in the season. No. 1 Lebanon and No. 5 Souhegan will play in the other semifinal. “It’s really exciting,” said second-year Portsmouth coach Sara Carpenter. “It’s been a while for Portsmouth field hockey. It’s exciting for me, but it’s super-exciting to watch the girls’ reaction getting a win today. It was big.” The Clippers carried most of the play, finishing with a 9-1 edge in penalty corners. But it was when the Marauders earned their first corner with just under three minutes to go that both sides seemed to sense things had moved into the end game. Hanover coach Jean Essex called timeout with 1:42 left, and her squad spent most of those precious seconds closing in on the Clippers’ goal. “I knew it was going to be a full-court press for her,” said Carpenter, “and that’s what I tried to tell my girls: This is what’s coming at you, be ready, don’t play frantic, play your game and get the ball.” Ultimately they did, with Blodgett getting possession on the left sideline to relieve some pressure, and then the defense on the other side getting the clear that ended the game. And punched their ticket to Exeter. “It’s amazing to finally be a part of the final four,” said defender Lexi Fratamico, one of 10 seniors on the team. “We’ve put in so much work, from preseason, to our practices at 6-o-clock in the morning, to our practices after school … I think it’s an amazing team and we really brought it today against Hanover. I’m just really proud of everyone.” On a chilly, windless evening, the Clippers got a grip on this one from the start. They earned four corners in the opening nine minutes and cashed in on the fourth. After a pass in, Locandro lifted a high ball that Lilly Hardy got a stick on, dropping it right at the feet of Blodgett, who shot it past goalie Sophie Cardenali. It was the first goal in nine days for the Clippers, who had a bye in the tournament’s first round. “After the anticipation, waiting for this game, I think we definitely came out hard and did what we wanted to do,” said Blodgett. “It definitely picked us up and took us to another level, confidence-wise. We were hoping to get one after another after another.” “In the first half they were definitely the No. 3 seed,” said Essex. “They have some key players who can control the ball and they’re fast, so we had to make some adjustments. It was a matter of settling in.” The Marauders, who started just two seniors on a team that finished 6-9-1 and knocked off No. 6 Derryfield in the prelims, protected the fort in the opening minutes after halftime, with Locandro and midfielder Olivia Grant creating scoring bids. Then they played their best near the end. But while the bids at the end belonged to Hanover, the spot in the semifinals belongs to Portsmouth. “I feel like we played a good game and at times we dominated the game,” said Carpenter, who knows about trips to the semifinals from her stint coaching at St. Thomas. “The score might not reflect that but that’s a reflection of their defense, and their goalie is exceptional. There are things that we can work on for the next few days.” Days will lead up to a trip to the final four.
