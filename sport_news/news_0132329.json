He knows what is ahead for CC Sabathia.\n“It’s long road, and it may become lonely,’’ Strawberry told The Post Monday after Sabathia checked himself into an alcohol rehabilitation center. “And it may become lonely because you get so accustomed to doing what you are doing and putting down the drink or the drug, whatever you have to put down.\n“It’s very hard. It’s not an easy process. You have to work. You have to work on yourself. The biggest obstacle for him — it happened to me when I was playing — it’s very hard while you’re playing. You have to stop going around certain people, places and things.”\nStrawberry indicated Sabathia surrounding himself with a better environment would help more than just the alcohol problem.\n“He’s going to have to find a different place, but also at the same time, it’s going to make him a better man,’’ Strawberry said of the Yankees left-hander. “It makes you a better man when you grab hold of your problem being in the public eye.’’\nThe former Mets and Yankees star was in Washington on Monday to speak about addiction and recovery. He walks the walk with his recovery center, based in Florida.\n“I just hope people understand and are willing to give CC the privacy that he needs to get well as a person, not as a baseball player, but as a person,’’ Strawberry said.\n“My thoughts and prayers are with CC and his family, and I applaud him more than anything for being able to step up, right in the middle of where the Yankees are at, in a playoff atmosphere and say, ‘You know what, I can’t do this. Because if I’m pitching and I’m playing I’m still going to go out and drink and nothing is going to change.’ ”\nSabathia had to think bigger than baseball, Strawberry said.\n“He realizes, ‘I don’t want to completely destroy my life and my children’s lives,’ ” Strawberry said. “It takes a man to do that.’’\nBeing a celebrity can make it tougher.\n“I think so many people in the public eye get defensive and then they get in denial and then they can’t get well,’’ Strawberry explained. “That’s why you see so many celebrities in Hollywood and entertainment and athletes and you see so many of them [overdosing] and dying because they can’t get past the fact that they have a problem.\n“It’s OK to admit that you have a problem and start dealing with it. It took me a very long time to realize that I had a very serious problem and I needed to deal with it.\n“It doesn’t matter if you are a celebrity athlete or celebrity star or on a park bench somewhere in a rough neighborhood somewhere, addiction is real. Until I face what is going on inside of me, I can never get help.’’\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google Whatsapp Email Filed under cc sabathia ,  darryl strawberry ,  new york yankees", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T23:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T05:34:43.320+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
