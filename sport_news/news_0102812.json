Taquan \"Smoke\" Mizzell was as surprised as anyone.\n\"Thirty touches?\" the junior tailback from Bayside High repeated Saturday, after he had 24 carries and six receptions in Virginia's 26-13 loss to North Carolina.\n\"Yeah, I'm tired,\" he said.\nMizzell had a right to be, following a career day that was one of the bright spots in another ACC loss, and Virginia's 13th straight road defeat.\nMizzell's 117 rushing yards were a career high, as were his 24 attempts. His previous bests were 18 carries and 66 yards vs. Notre Dame on Sept. 12.\nAs for his production as a receiver, that was just another day's work for a player who leads the nation's running backs in receiving yardage.\n\"He's one of our best players, if not the best player we have, in terms of production, in terms of being able to catch the ball, run the ball,\" coach Mike London said.\n\"He's a dynamic player for us.\"\nMizzell did much of his damage between the tackles. Virginia, which has talked all season of being a downhill running team, rushed for a season-high 205 yards.\nBut that didn't provide much satisfaction on a day when the Cavaliers committed five second-half turnovers.\n\"As far as us as a team, we've just got to find that game where the offense is clicking, the defense is clicking, and the special teams are clicking,\" Mizzell said. \"I know if we don't beat ourselves, it's not too many teams that can beat us, honestly.\"\nTight ends get more looks \nWith its receivers mostly bottled up, Virginia turned to its tight ends in an effort to jump start its passing game and take some off the heat off Mizzell. Senior Charlie Hopkins caught a season and career-high three passes for 36 yards and the Cavaliers' only touchdown. Brendan Marshall, a former quarterback, had his first career catch.\n\"It's just kind of the way it worked out,\" London said. \"We've got to find ways to keep using our best guys.\"\nBlanding takes stand on defense \nSafety Quin Blanding, a Bayside High graduate, led the team with 12 tackles and had Virginia's first interception of the season. After failing to get a takeaway in the first four games, Virginia has six in the past three.\n\"We were playing really tight, I guess, early in the season, especially when things weren't happening,\" linebacker Micah Kiser said. \"Our confidence was down. We've been having a lot more fun out there, and got our first interception on a great player by Quin. Hopefully we'll keep getting better.\"\nCornerback Demetrious Nicholson (Bayside) forced a fumble and had 1.5 tackles for loss. Linebacker Mark Hall (Green Run) had four tackles, as did safety Wilfred Wahee (Norfolk Christian).\n[X] Click a thumbnail to view the full-size image. Buy Pilot photos here. \n\nLoading...
