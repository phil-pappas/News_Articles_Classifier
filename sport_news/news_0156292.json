Here's some the reaction to the win and what it means moving forward.\nAfter an upset of No. 2 Alabama, plus scares for No. 1 Ohio State and No. 3 TCU, Sports Illustrated's Colin Becht asked if anyone really wants to be No. 1 , including the Horned Frogs.\n\"Let's take a quick look at how some of the top teams in the AP poll entering this week fared. No. 1 Ohio State looked lost offensively with both Cardale Jones and J.T. Barrett under center and would have likely fallen to Northern Illinois if not for a standout defensive performance. No. 2 Alabama destroyed itself with turnovers and defensive breakdowns in a 43-37 defeat to No. 15 Ole Miss. No. 3 TCU led SMU by just five midway through the fourth quarter before pulling away late. No. 6 USC was upset by Stanford at home.\n\"So who deserves to be the top seed at this point? Luckily, that's moot, as Week 3 rankings won't matter when the College Football Playoff field is announced on Dec. 6. But with most teams a quarter of the way through their regular season, little certainty has developed. That's making for a fun year.\"\nESPN's Jake Trotter said an up-and-coming SMU squad exposed the Horned Frogs in the defensive backfield.\n\"TCU's makeshift defense was exposed by a much improved, but still not great SMU offense. The TCU secondary especially struggled after [Ranthony] Texada left the game, as Corry O'Meally, Nick Orr and Torrance Mosley had trouble hanging with SMU's receivers in one-on-one situations downfield. TCU wound up surrendering 508 yards of offense; the Horned Frogs gave up more than 500 yards only once all of last season (to Baylor).\"\nTrotter isn't too optimistic for what conference play brings for the Frogs when they'll face even more explosive offenses.\n\"The trip to Texas Tech next weekend looks daunting, given how dynamic the Red Raiders have been offensively this season, especially Saturday night in their win at Arkansas. The Horned Frogs will have to lean on quarterback Trevone Boykin even more while the TCU defense finds it way with so many new -- and unproven -- faces.\"\nFOX Sports Stewart Mandel has TCU quarterback Trevone Boykin at No. 4 in his Heisman Trophy watch , slotting Boykin behind three running backs in LSU's Leonard Fournette, Georgia's Nick Chubb and UCLA's Paul Perkins.\n\"After a quiet opener against Minnesota, Boykin has started putting up the video game numbers we expected, going 21-of-30 for 454 yards and five touchdowns and rushing for another against SMU,\" Mandel writes.\"\nOn Twitter:\n @RyanGerbosi", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/RyanGerbosi", "http://espn.go.com/blog/big12/post/_/id/103757/banged-up-tcu-survives-smus-late-push-wins-56-37", "http://www.si.com/college-football/2015/09/20/week-3-takeaways-sec-pac-12-notre-dame", "http://www.foxsports.com/college-football/story/lsu-tigers-leonard-fournette-georgia-bulldogs-nick-chubb-heisman-trophy-top-5-092015"], "published": "2015-09-20T22:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T03:02:11.207+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
