I will not shoot you if you give this to the cops.\"\nDowning said he stood up then, and the shooter pointed a gun at him. \"This is the moment I thought I was going to die,\" Downing said.\nInstead, the shooter paused for a moment, Downing said, and handed him the envelope. Next, the shooter told Downing to sit in the very back seat and face him.\nDowning did so and said at that point Harper-Mercer fired into the center of the room and began asking students one by one if they were religious. The shooter fired at one student who said he was Christian and another who said she was Catholic.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T14:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T22:25:15.451+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
