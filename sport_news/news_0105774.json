Reynolds Razorback Stadium, Fayetteville, Arkansas\nTV: SEC Network\nLine: Arkansas by 6.5\nThis game will determine...\nWho is in last place in the SEC West and potentially who is going to a bowl. The loser will fall to 1-3 in the SEC and depending on the outcome of Mississippi State-Kentucky, could be in sole possession of last place. Should Auburn lose, the Tigers would be in last regardless as MSU has the tiebreak. It would be particularly disheartening for an Auburn squad that entered the season as the favorite to win the SEC and believes it turned a corner in October to fall to the basement of the division before Halloween. A win would essentially guarantee a bowl berth for Auburn, which still has Idaho on the schedule. For Arkansas, a loss would further bury a team that has been unable to build off its strong finish to last season while a win would put the Razorbacks in line to get to 4-4 following their FCS game next week.\nThree things to look for\n1. Offensive rhythm. Auburn's offense looked its best all season during the first half against Kentucky. The Tigers were able to throw deep and finish drives, with five scores before halftime. Sean White had his best game, Peyton Barber was successful though not as productive as usual, and Ricardo Louis made several good catches. If Auburn can repeat its efficiency from a week ago, the Tigers will be hard to slow down. If not, it would be a long day.\n2. Tempo. In moving the ball with such success last week Auburn also ran up-tempo more than it had all season. Arkansas loves to dictate the pace of play, especially against Auburn, but has added some up-tempo style to its arsenal as well. With the gamesmanship never lacking between Gus Malzahn and Bret Bielema, it would not be at all surprising if Arkansas tried to beat Auburn at its own game at some points.\n3. Run defense. Auburn has not been able to limit running attacks at all this season. Even while holding Mississippi State to 56 rushing yards, the Bulldogs were not attempting to run much, with just 21 carries. Alex Collins could easily add his name to a growing list of 100-yard rushers against the Tigers during the last year.\nAuburn beat writers share Arkansas predictions Auburn beat writers Wesley Sinor, James Crepea and Brandon Marcello share their score predictions for the Arkansas game. (Wesley Sinor/wsinor@al.com)\nKey matchup\nAuburn's defensive line vs. Arkansas' offensive line. It always starts up front and Auburn has been unable to great pass rush or contain running backs. Arkansas has the largest offensive line in all of football and has allowed just five sacks this season, tied for seventh-best nationally. If Brandon Allen has time to throw and Collins has room to run, the chances Auburn can win are slim to none.\nBy the numbers\n16.86 â€“ The average margin of victory during the last 14 games in the Auburn-Arkansas series is 16.86 points, with 11 games decided by 17-plus.\nInjuries\nAuburn -- RB Roc Thomas probable (leg), RB Jovon Robinson probable (leg), DT Montravius Adams probable (undisclosed), OL Jordan Diamond questionable (undisclosed), DL Jauntavius Johnson questionable (knee), CB T.J.
