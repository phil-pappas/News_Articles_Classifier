After that, teams have to earn at-large bids based on their overall 10-game record. \nWe've seen upsets, inconsistency, and close losses – all of which will have a significant impact on who is in, who is out, and who is on the bubble. \nAt the 4-A level, teams typically need to have a 5-5 overall record (or better) and be at least .500 in conference to get an at-large bid. So in a 7-team conference, you're looking for a 3-3 conference record. But in an 8-team conference you'll likely need a 4-3 record. Cap 8 Conference: \nIN: Wake Forest, Millbrook, Wakefield \nOUT: Broughton, Enloe \nBUBBLE TEAMS: \nHeritage – The Huskies are 4-3 overall and 2-1 on the season with a tough schedule remaining. Heritage has games remaining against Wake Forest, Millbrook, Wakefield and Broughton. Heritage will have to pick up two wins, which means they will have to upset either Wake Forest, Millbrook or Wakefield, the top three teams in the conference right now. \nLeesville Road – Friday night's loss to Sanderson really hurt the Pride's chances of making the state playoffs. Leesville Road is 3-4 overall and 2-1 in the Cap 8. Leesville's situation is similar to Heritage. The Pride need two wins and they have four games left, including three games against Wake Forest, Millbrook and Wakefield. This week, Leesville will play Enloe, which is essentially a must-win. \nSanderson – Sanderson's win over Leesville Road keeps the Spartans on the bubble for now, but barely. With a 2-5 record, Sanderson needs three more wins with four games left. The Spartans have winnable games against Broughton and Enloe coming up, but they will need to pick up a win against either Wake Forest or Millbrook. Sanderson could look back at one-point losses to Green Hope and Knightdale at the end of the season as games that could keep them out of the playoffs. Eastern Carolina Conference (4A Only): \nIN: D.H. Conley, New Bern, J.H. Rose \nOUT: South Central \nOUT: Harnett Central \nBUBBLE TEAMS: \nClayton – Clayton is on the bubble, the Comets are in a though spot. With just three games left against West Johnston, Rolesville and Southeast Raleigh, Clayton needs to win two of them to have a legitimate shot at making the playoffs. The Comets are on a bye week this week, but two of the three games are road games in the final three weeks of the regular season. \nEast Wake – The Warriors are one of five different teams with one loss in the conference, so they still have a very real chance at one of the three automatic bids. They do have a some very important games remaining though, including this Thursday at home against Garner. East Wake needs two more wins to ensure an at-large bid, but the Warriors have higher hopes – a conference title or one of the top three spots in the standings. \nGarner – Garner's situation is very similar to East Wake's. The Trojans have three away games and one home game remaining, but they only need to win one more to clinch an at-large bid. Anything else is just cushion and helps their eventual seed. \nKnightdale – Knightdale is in a good place. The Knights are 5-2 overall and 2-1 in the league. One more win Knightdale is pretty much guaranteed a spot in the state playoffs. Of course, there is a very real chance Knightdale could get an automatic bid by finishing in the top three of the league. The Knights have games remaining at Rolesville, at home against Garner and East Wake, and at West Johnston. \nRolesville – Rolesville is also among the teams tied with one conference loss. The Rams need two more wins to get into the playoffs as an at-large team, but they're hoping for one of the automatic bids. Rolesville has three home games remaining against Knightdale, Harnett Central and Garner, and a road game at Clayton. \nSoutheast Raleigh – The situation for Southeast Raleigh is very simple – the Bulldogs likely have to win out to make the playoffs. After beating Chapel Hill and Garner earlier in the season, Southeast Raleigh has lost three straight to West Johnston, Rolesville and Knightdale. They have games coming up with East Wake, Harnett Central and Clayton, and they're all must-win games. \nWest Johnston – One more win for West Johnston should get the Wildcats into the playoffs as an at-large team, but like many of the other teams in the league, West Johnston hopes to have one of the top three spots when it's all said and done. The Wildcats have games against Clayton, Garner and Knightdale remaining. Mid-South Conference: \nIN: Jack Britt, Cape Fear, Seventy-First \nOUT: None \nBUBBLE TEAMS : \nE.E. Smith – E.E. Smith has yet to win a game in the Mid-South, but the Golden Bulls are in decent shape when it comes to the playoff bubble. At 4-3 overall, E.E. Smith likely needs just two more wins to qualify for the playoffs as an at-large team. The Golden Bulls have games against South View, Cape Fear, Overhills and Seventy-First coming up. \nOverhills – Overhills also needs two wins to get into the playoffs, sitting at 4-3 overall and 1-1 in the – Mid-South Conference. Overhills has a tough road ahead though, with games against Seventy-First, Pine Forest, E.E. Smith and Jack Britt. \nPine Forest – Pine Forest is in decent shape as well. One more win should get Pine Forest into the playoffs as an at-large, two more would be a guaranteed berth. Pine Forest also has a chance to get an automatic bid as a top three team. Game remaining include Cape Fear, Overhills and Seventy-First. \nSouth View – The Tigers are beginning to slide off the playoff bubble. The situation is simple – South View must win out to make the playoffs. They have tough games too, including home games against E.E. Smith and Cape Fear, and a road game at Jack Britt. PAC 6 Conference: \nOUT: Jordan, East Chapel Hill \nBUBBLE TEAMS: \nCardinal Gibbons – Cardinal Gibbons has four wins overall, and two more should get the Crusaders into the 4-A state playoffs. There are some winnable games on the remaining schedule for Gibbons too – home games against Jordan and East Chapel Hill, and road games at Person and Northern Durham. It's very possible that Cardinal Gibbons gets an automatic bid from the PAC 6 too. \nNorthern Durham – Northern Durham finds itself in an interesting spot. The Knights could get into the state playoffs with just four wins by finishing in the top three of the conference. It's hard to make an absolute statement about Northern Durham without knowing what is going to happen in the rest of the conference. But, if Northern wins two more, I think they have a good shot at making the playoffs. If they win all three remaining games against Person, East Chapel Hill and Cardinal Gibbons, the Knights are definitely in. \nPerson – The Rockets benefited from a good non-conference showing and now reports a 5-2 overall record. If Person can win one more game, they're going to make the state playoffs. Person has games remaining against Northern Durham, Cardinal Gibbons, Riverside and Hillside. \nRiverside – Riverside finds itself with its back against the wall headed into the final four weeks of the regular season. The Pirates are 2-5 overall and need to win at least three of the last four to get in. Riverside has lost three straight games and has games remaining against Hillside, Jordan, Person, and East Chapel Hill. Southeastern Conference: \nOUT: Purnell Swett, Hoke County \nBUBBLE TEAMS: \nLumberton – The road looks tough for Lumberton. Right now, Lumberton is 3-4 overall and has four games remaining. They are 0-1 in the Southeastern Conference. I believe Lumberton needs to win three more games to get into the playoffs. They have games remaining against Hoke County, Richmond, Scotland and Purnell Swett. That means Lumberton would have to upset either Richmond or Scotland, and that's tough for most anyone. Southwest Wake Athletic Conference: \nOUT: Cary, Athens Drive \nBUBBLE: \nApex – Apex stands at 3-4 overall and 2-2 in the SWAC, and the Cougars need to win at least two more games to get into the playoffs as an at-large team. There are three tough games coming up for Apex too – Green Hope, Panther Creek and undefeated Middle Creek. \nGreen Hope – Green Hope also needs two more wins to get into the playoffs. The Falcons' win against Panther Creek last week put them in much better shape on the playoff bubble, and now the Falcons have winnable games against Apex, Cary and Athens Drive coming up. Green Hope will also make a trip to Middle Creek for a game. Two wins and they're in. \nHolly Springs – Holly Springs sits a 4-4 overall and 2-2 in the SWAC. Two more wins is what the Golden Hawks needs to get into the playoffs. Holly Springs has three games left against Panther Creek, Athens Drive and Cary. \nPanther Creek – Panther Creek's situation is exactly like Holly Springs' situation. The Catamounts are 4-4 and 2-2 and have three games left to win two. The game against Holly Springs is crucial for Panther Creek. The Catamounts have three games left – Holly Springs, Apex and Fuquay-Varina. A loss to Holly Springs this week means Panther Creek will likely have to upset undefeated Fuquay-Varina in the season finale to make the playoffs. \nCopyright 2015 by Capitol Broadcasting Company.
