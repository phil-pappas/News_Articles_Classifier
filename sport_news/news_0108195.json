Marcel Pourtout October 21, 2015 02:02 PM | 210 views | 0 | | Special PhotoMount Vernon Presbyterian running back Ahmir Lee (34) plunges into the end zone for touchdown in contest last season. slideshow With three weeks left in the football regular season, teams are immersed in region play and looking to move up in the standings.Riverwood has won six of its first seven contests and its first four games in Region 7 play through Oct. 15. The Raiders posted a shutout against North Springs, 48-0, on Oct. 9 behind Marvin Kinsey’s 152 rushing yards and three touchdowns. Quarterback Porter Sanford threw for 107 yards and touchdown. Riverwood’s defense held North Springs to less than 100 yards of total offense.“We were really focused because North Springs beat us last year and the players wanted to make a statement,” Riverwood coach Ben Stready said.The Raiders will host Cambridge out of Milton this Friday with the chance to enter its region play-in game on Oct. 30 for a spot in the state playoffs. Cambridge sports a record of 6-1 on the season and is currently on a four-game winning streak. Riverwood holds a 2-1 series lead over Cambridge but the Bears won last season’s contest 35-17.North Atlanta, also in Region 7 is also looking to keep its playoff hopes alive after a comeback win over Forsyth Central on Oct. 9. The Warriors were down 33-14 in the fourth quarter but fought back for the victory. Jack Ferguson threw three touchdown passes while KD Welch rushed for 147 yards and two scores for North Atlanta.“The easy way out would have been to raise the white flag and tap out in defeat but our young men refused to be remembered that way,” North Atlanta coach Jeremy Gainer said. “Our staff and players spend a lot of time with one another teaching and learning what is the right way to go about life and the game of football. To see these lessons play out on Friday Night is a very special moment that we will remember for a long time as a football family.”North Atlanta has already won three contests this season which matches the victory total of the previous three years combined. The Warriors will visit Kell in Marietta this Friday. The Longhorns have won five contests this season. Kell won last season’s contest over North Atlanta 35-7.Lovett has continued its turnaround this season, winning its last three contests in Region 6AA action after dropping the first four games of the season in non-region action. The Lions defeated Hapeville Charter 25-14 at home on Oct. 9.“We felt going into the game that we had to try to limit Hapeville as far as big plays were concerned,” Lovett coach Mike Muschamp said. “They had scored a bunch of points off of explosive plays so we thought that was a key to the game. We felt like we needed to try to control the ball to keep their offense off the field. I think we did both of those.”Lovett has lost only one region contest this season which puts them third in the standings and fighting for a playoff spot. “We are still alive,” Muschamp said. “As long as we continue to push to improve, we have a chance. We’re not a good enough team right now to get satisfied with where we are. We must continue to get better.” The Lions will host Wesleyan this Friday with the Wolves entering the contest on a four-game winning streak. Lovett has won all five previous meetings against Wesleyan including last year’s 30-24 victory.Westminster returns to the field in a Region 4AAA road contest against Douglass on Friday. The Wildcats are coming off of a 49-16 home win over Decatur on Oct. 9. Douglass defeated Washington (Atlanta) 21-12 on the same night. Westminster won last season’s contest over the Astros 42-8.Pace Academy out of Region 6AA looks to get back in the win column with a home contest against Hapeville Charter on Friday. The Knights started the season with five consecutive wins but have dropped their last two contests, including a 31-13 road loss at Greater Atlanta Christian on Oct. 9. Pace Academy is still in playoff position with two region wins and sitting fourth in the standings. The Knights won last year’s game over Hapeville Charter 37-20.Other matchups of interest on Friday include North Springs visiting Forsyth Central in Cumming and Mount Vernon Presbyterian making the trip to Locust Grove and facing Strong Rock Christian.This Saturday has two additional contests as well. Holy Innocents’ will host Greater Atlanta Christian and Young Americans Christian visits Holy Spirit Prep.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T22:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T16:06:27.149+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
