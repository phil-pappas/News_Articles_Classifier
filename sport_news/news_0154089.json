But I talked to guys like Amar'e Stoudemire in the locker room after, and they were like, 'It's tough when you start out, you know, the game's moving so fast.' But they said I looked all right, so that's encouraging.\"\nRichardson, the guard out of Tennessee who was selected at No. 40 in the second round, 30 picks after Winslow went at No. 10, played the final 5:40, missing both of his shots, with his lone statistic a steal.\nRichardson said it was helpful having the previous experience of summer league under his belt.\n\"The first day of summer league, I was shaking when I walked on the court, just nervous,\" he said. \"I wasn't nervous or anything like that [Sunday].

But the NBA is a game of pace.
