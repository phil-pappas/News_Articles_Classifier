Like a publicist announcing the demise of a Hollywood marriage, the parties insisted the split was amicable. Mattingly even suggested he \"will be friends like forever\" with his former bosses. \"I don't really want to get into details of our conversations. They were good conversations, they were open and they were honest,\" Mattingly said by phone from his offseason home in Evansville, Indiana. \"It just became evident that this was the best thing for both parties.\" Related Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T01:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T02:41:10.862+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
