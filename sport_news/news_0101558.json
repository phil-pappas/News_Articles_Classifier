No worries. \nCoach in his first year with the program? No problem. \nWhen it comes down to it, putting on a Union County volleyball uniform comes with high expectations. \nJust the first step of very lofty expectations was accomplished Saturday as the Patriots swept their way to another sectional title. \nUnion County defeated Centerville 25-14, 25-21, 25-21 Saturday night to claim the IHSAA Class 2A Sectional 41 championship at Winchester Fieldhouse. \nIt's the third straight sectional title for the Patriots (22-9), the fourth in five years and 14th in program history. \n\"It does feel pretty good. These guys really worked hard. We came in here, we started open gyms in March, and I could tell right away that this was a special group of kids,\" said head coach Frank Spurlock, in his first year with the team. \n\"They haven't taken their past success for granted, and they've worked their tails off all summer, and they've faced a lot of adversity during the season.\" \nThe Patriots will host Shenandoah, winner of the Sectional 42 championship, Tuesday at Union County. \n\"It's amazing. It's just how hard we've worked all season, it's really great, so I appreciate it a lot, the team that I'm on is wonderful,\" said senior four-year starter Allison Kassens, who had 13 kills, three assists and four digs in the championship match. \nShe also set school records for digs and kills during the 25-22, 16-25, 25-17, 25-18 semifinal win over Hagerstown Saturday morning. \nKassens, the three-time reigning All-Area Player of the Year, now has 1,625 kills and 1,371 digs in her career. \n\"I am so proud of her. She's earned that, there's nobody better, and I'm so glad she has that,\" said junior Ella Dils, who had 14 kills, two aces, two blocks and a dig in the final. \n\"… I'm just proud of how we played today.\" \nThe Bulldogs never went away and fought back to tie the match at various times, but once again, the Patriots prevailed. Centerville last won against Union County in 2011, before losing in the sectional that same year. \nThe Bulldogs finish 20-7 and won the Rushville invitational. \nThey graduate Emily Jones, the school's all-time leader in digs, who added 16 on Saturday, as well as Kaylin Smith, Alexis Toschlog and Monica Herrman. \nToschlog and Kelsee Troutwine each had four kills, Lanie McClanahan had five kills, 10 digs and three blocks and Lizzie Walther had 16 assists and two aces. \n\"I was proud of the effort we put in the second two sets, especially there at the end. They got game point and we still managed to take a couple extra points from them, which is just a testament to the mentality we've been working on all season,\" Centerville coach Victoria Bevins said. \n\"… Our mentality entering today was, 'Win or lose, can you walk away with no regrets?' And that's how they played, knowing we were going to leave it on the floor with no regrets.\" \nUnion County's senior class of Kassens, Danielle Hill, Bailey Jenkins, Micaila Rosenberger, Lauren Lester and Sydney Bradford has contributed to 12 postseason victories. Dils, the only junior, has 11. \nJenkins had three kills, 27 assists, a block and four digs, Hill had five blocks and two kills, Lester had nine digs, Bradford had five aces and three blocks and Madison Rosenberger had a block and six digs. \n\"It feels really good,\" Bradford said. \"I'm extremely glad that we finished that strong.\" \nUnion County owns seven regional titles and a semistate title, won in 1997. \nThey have won regional titles three of the last four years. \n\"It's an indescribable feeling,\" Lester said. \"Just getting here and making it three in a row is awesome, especially being a senior, because you never want it to end.\" \nClass 2A Sectional 41 Match 1: Union County 3, Winchester 0 (25-8, 25-4, 25-21) Match 2: Hagerstown 3, Lincoln 0 (25-14, 25-16, 25-11) Match 3: Union County 3, Hagerstown 1 (25-22, 16-25, 25-17, 25-18) Match 4: Centerville 3, Northeastern 0 (25-16, 25-21, 25-13) Match 5: Union County 3, Centerville 0 (25-14, 25-21, 25-20) 1 CONNECT 11 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://pinews.co/1N04hgy TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T04:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T07:56:48.846+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
