The Pioneers responded with a dominating performance, defeating the Knights on Wednesday evening in the Laney Center, 30-7. \n“It’s always good getting a win to build our morale and confidence,” Wayland coach Aaron Meister said. “It helps the girls believe what we’re teaching them in practice.” \nThe eighth-ranked Pioneers made big believers out of the No. 21 Knights, especially Wayland’s Michele Guerrero, Asia Igafo, Rizpah Umi and Valerie Rosales, all of whom won by pin. \n“We were excited that as a team we scored bonus points,” Meister said. \nIt took Rosales, already a three-time all-American, just 22 seconds to pin her opponent in the 155-pound class, drawing cheers from her family visiting from El Paso. \nIt was Wayland’s second season-opening win in the program’s six-year history. The other victory came four years ago over Missouri Valley’s Orange team. \nAgainst Warner Pacific on Wednesday, Wayland recorded four more pins in eight exhibition matches, by Evelynn Simmons, Rhonda Johnson, Alana Quackenbush and Brittany Marshall, who tallied her fall just 32 seconds into the action. Conversely, Simmons prevailed with just two seconds left in the match. \n“I felt the younger girls were a little bit timid starting out, but throughout the dual they started gaining some momentum and became more comfortable,” Meister said. \nOverall, the coach said, “I’m optimistically content. \n“I thought we did what we can do, and I know we can do more…and we’re going to have to this weekend,” he said of Wayland’s next competition – the Oklahoma City University Cliff Keen Duals – on Friday and Saturday. The Pioneers and Knights will travel together to Oklahoma City where they will face some of the best teams in the nation. \nWayland Baptist 30, Warner Pacific (Ore.) 7 \n101: Evelynn Simmons (WBU), forfeit; WBU leads, 5-0 \n109: Michele Guerrero (WBU) over Kaelynn Canyete (WPC) by fall; WBU leads 10-0 \n123: Kaitlyn Funai (WPC) over Destany DeLaCruz (WBU) by decision, 12-5; WBU leads 11-3 \n130: Asia Igafo (WBU) over Maria Garcia (WPC) by fall; WBU leads 16-3 \n136: Rizpah Umi (WBU) over Breanne Diaz (WPC) by fall; WBU leads 21-3 \n143: Keira Gabaldon (WPC) over Marina Briceno (WBU) by decision, 8-2; WBU leads 22-6 \n155: Valerie Rosales (WBU) over Lokelani Kam (WPC) by fall; WBU leads 27-6 \n191: Kierra Boyce (WBU) over Reydell Ewaliko-Kauhane (WPC) by decision, 2-1, WBU wins 30-7 \nExhibitions \n101/109: Evelynn Simmons (WBU) over Kaelynn Canyete (WPC) by fall \n116/123: Kaitlyn Funai (WPC) over Leah Olguin (WBU) by decision, 6-5 \n123/130: Maria Garcia (WPC) over Destany DeLaCruz (WBU) by technical fall, 10-0 \n130: Regina Bell (WPC) over Asia Igafo (WBU) by fall \n136: Breanna Dudoit-Vasquez (WBU) over Breanne Diaz (WPC) by technical fall, 12-1 \n155: Alana Quackenbush (WBU) over Lokelani Kam (WPC) by fall \n170/191: Brittany Marshall (WBU) over Reydell Ewaliko-Kauhane (WPC) by fall \n101/109: Rhonda Johnson (WBU) over Kaelynn Canyete (WPC), by fall", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T05:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T06:53:09.572+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
