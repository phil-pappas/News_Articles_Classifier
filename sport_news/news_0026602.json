Louis Picamoles got their only try in the first half. \nNew Zealand captain Richie McCaw declared himself \"very proud\" of the performance. \"We were very clinical,\" he said highlighting how the All Blacks had piled on the pressure from the start. \nIn addition to Savea's triple, Tawera Kerr-Barlow touched down twice and Nehe Milner-Skudder, Brodie Retallick, Jerome Kaino and Kieran Read also crossed. Dan Carter added 17 points from the boot. \nFrench coach Philippe Saint-Andre was booed by his country's fans at the end of his last game in charge of the team. He said he accepted \"a large part\" of the blame for the defeat which French media quickly condemned as a \"fiasco.\" \nThe day's other quarterfinal could not have been more different. With Wales leading 19-18 and with just five minutes left, South Africa captain du Preez picked up a sublime Duane Vermeulen backhand pass and drove through to the corner to touchdown.
