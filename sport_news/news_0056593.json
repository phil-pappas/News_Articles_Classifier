Ornelas, San Antonio Express-News Image 16 of 16 Duncan passes the torch to Aldridge on Sports Illustrated cover 1 / 16 Back to Gallery Graying, stoic, Tim Duncan stands with folded arms, inches behind his heir.\nLaMarcus Aldridge — labelled \"The Student\" by a small, upwards pointing arrow — clings to a basketball with his broad, tattooed arms, embracing it as if nothing in the world matters more, emulating the pregame ritual of his \"mentor\".\n\"New Blood in the Old School,\" the overlay reads.\nSports Illustrated regional covers for the NBA's coming season have been released this year with a \"passing the torch\" theme, and Duncan and Aldridge embody that notion perhaps better than any tandem in the league.\nThe league's elder statesman, a two-time MVP, five-time champion and unequivocally one of the greatest players in NBA history, alongside the native son now returned to become the Spurs' big man of the future — what Duncan once was nearly two decades ago.\nThe three other regional covers feature similar duos, though none are as inspired a choice as the Duncan-Aldridge pairing.\nKevin Garnett and Karl-Anthony Towns represent the Timberwolves, but Garnett made excursions elsewhere during his career and his time as a dominant force is long over.\nKobe Bryant and D'Angello Russell feature for the Lakers, but does anyone truly believe the Mamba is content to concede his alpha dog status to anyone, let alone a rookie?\nMiami's tandem of Dwayne Wade and Justise Winslow should develop a fruitful relationship, but Wade has a few years left as the face of the franchise, if he can stay on the court.\nDuncan is the only one of the elders who either has a torch to pass or is truly willing to hand it over.\nThe more pressing matter, though, is the supposed Sports Illustrated cover jinx.\nThe jinx dates back to Aug. 16, 1954, the very first issue.\nIn the midst of a nine-game winning streak, Braves third baseman Eddie Mathews became the first man to appear on the cover.\nHis reward? The streak was broken, and soon, so was his hand.\nThis year alone the cover has brought ill fortune upon the Oregon Ducks football team, Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball team, Seattle Seahawks, Cleveland Indians, Washington Nationals, Seattle Mariners and Serena Williams.\nThat might worry a legion of Spurs fans, but it won't rattle Gregg Popovich in the least.\n\"Are you superstitious in anyway?\" a fan once asked Pops.\nHis answer?\n\"Absolutely not, in no way whatsoever. It's a waste of time.\"\nnmoyle@express-news.net\nTwitter: @NRMoyle", "external_links": ["http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/20/26/24/4285711/11/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "https://twitter.com/NRMoyle", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/52/67/8826330/4/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/47/42/8812681/5/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/47/36/8812452/9/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/52/25/8824132/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/20/24/15/4277115/13/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/47/37/8812516/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/47/54/8813342/7/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/47/37/8812487/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/52/66/8826303/4/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/52/66/8826268/4/920x920.jpg", "http://www.nba.com/spurs/features/pop_mailbag_1011.html", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/52/67/8826331/4/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/47/54/8813342/7/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/52/66/8826268/4/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/47/37/8812487/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/47/37/8812516/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/52/67/8826330/4/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/20/26/24/4285711/11/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/47/42/8812681/5/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/52/27/8824274/21/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/52/67/8826331/4/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/52/27/8824270/21/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/20/24/15/4277115/13/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/52/27/8824270/21/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/47/54/8813341/7/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/47/54/8813341/7/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/52/25/8824132/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/52/66/8826303/4/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/47/36/8812452/9/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/52/27/8824274/21/920x920.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-21T20:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T21:47:46.275+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
