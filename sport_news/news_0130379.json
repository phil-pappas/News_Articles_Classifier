General managers were not permitted to vote for their own team or personnel. Percentages are based on the pool of respondents to that particular question, rather than all 30 GMs.\nGasol also picked up the nod as the league’s best interior defender ahead of Anthony Davis (New Orleans) and DeAndre Jordan (Los Angeles Clippers). And for just the second time since Dirk Nowitzki has played in the NBA, league general managers named someone else as the best among international players.\nGasol received 62.1 percent of the vote in that category.\nVeteran swingman Tony Allen checked in as the toughest player in the NBA for a second straight season with 20.7 percent of the vote. Golden State’s Draymond Green finished second while Griz forward Zach Randolph tied Kobe Bryant and Jimmy Butler for third place with 6.9 percent.\nAllen finished fourth for best defensive player in the NBA. Davis, LeBron James (Cleveland) and Kawhi Leonard (San Antonio) ranked ahead of Allen.\nAs for perimeter defenders, Allen placed second behind Leonard.\nMemphis came in second behind Golden State for best defensive team. Griz coach Dave Joerger finished second behind San Antonio’s Gregg Popovich as the coach with the best defensive schemes.\nThe GMs ranked the Grizzlies sixth among Western Conference teams behind Houston, the Los Angeles Clippers, Oklahoma, San Antonio and Golden State.\nMike Conley received the only other Griz mention. He ranked fourth among the best point guards in the league and received votes for player most likely to have a breakout season. Russell Westbrook, Chris Paul and Stephen Curry ranked ahead of Conley in the category of best point guards.\nThe GMs also said Conley would make the second-best future NBA head coach someday. They rated Paul No. 1 in that category.", "external_links": ["http://www.nba.com/news/features/john_schuhmann/nba-com-2015-16-gm-survey/index.html?ls=iref:nbahpt3a"], "published": "2015-10-20T19:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T10:32:36.583+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
