Here are five high school football games we are anxious to see play out: \nMarionville (7-0) at Skyline (7-0) \nThe Mid-Lakes Conference title hangs in the balance in Urbana, where Class 1 No. 3-ranked Skyline hosts No. 2 Marionville. Both offenses have senior quarterbacks with capable legs, Dylan Mountain for Skyline and Jacob LaSalle for Marionville. In the last 10 meetings between the teams, Skyline has won five times and Marionville has won five times, with Marionville picking up victories in the most recent two seasons. \nCass-Midway (5-2) at Lighthouse Christian (4-2) at Kickapoo \nThe defending national homeschool champion Lighthouse Christian Chargers play their final home game at Kickapoo’s Pottenger Stadium. Running back Ben Friend enters the game averaging 207.7 rushing yards per game. Lighthouse Christian coach Rian Bess said the strength of his team is its ability to possess the ball on offense with a balanced attack. \n“We’re expecting big things out of Ben, Haaken Friend is also his brother, a 6-foot-5 wide receiver that we use quite a bit, and our quarterback Bryant Taylor. We’re hoping we can throw a lot this week and rely on our passing game,” Bess said. \nKickapoo (7-0) at Lebanon (5-2) \nLebanon could spoil Kickapoo’s sole possession of first place in the Ozark Conference with a home win in what is expected to be a dangerous matchup for Kickapoo’s defense. \n“(Lebanon has) probably the best offensive line we’ll face,” Kickapoo coach Kurt Thompson said. “They’ll line up in some flex bone stuff and then get in three-back and run right at you, and I’m not sure that’s our best game when people line up and run right at us.” \nAsh Grove (4-3) at Fair Grove (5-2) \nFair Grove will try to shake off a two-point loss to Marionville while Ash Grove comes into the game rolling from a 62-0 win over Pleasant Hope. Quarterback Jackson Bagley serves as Mr. Do-it-all for the Pirates, having passed for 99 yards and four touchdowns a week ago. Bagley is a capable runner, as is the Fair Grove backfield tandem of quarterback Brayden Lumley and running back Dalton Cloyd. \nFriday, October 9 \nAll games begin at 7 p.m. \nNews-Leader Game of the Week \nCentral (4-3) at Reeds Spring (7-0) \nOzark Conference \nKickapoo (7-0) at Lebanon (5-2) \nParkview (3-4) at West Plains (6-1) \nWaynesville (3-4) at Glendale (1-6) \nRolla (2-5) at Hillcrest (0-7) \nCamdenton (3-4) at Joplin (5-2) \nCentral Ozark Conference \nNixa (4-3) at Carthage (6-1) \nWebb City (7-0) at Ozark (1-6) \nWillard (4-3) at Branson (1-6) \nNeosho (4-3) at Republic (4-3) \nBolivar (6-1) at Catholic (2-5) \nHollister (2-5) at Rogersville (1-6) \nMarshfield (2-5) at Buffalo (1-6) \nNon-conference/Independent \nCass-Midway (5-2) at Lighthouse Christian (4-2) at Kickapoo \nEl Dorado Springs (3-4) at Strafford (2-5) \nClinton (3-4) at Monett (5-2) \nWindsor (2-4) Jasper (7-0) \nSarcoxie (1-5) at Butler (6-1) \nMid-Lakes \nMarionville (7-0) at Skyline (7-0) \nStockton (2-5) at Pleasant Hope (0-7) \nAsh Grove (4-3) at Fair Grove (5-2) \nSouth Central Association \nWillow Springs (1-6) at Thayer (6-1) \nSalem (3-4) at Mountain View-Liberty (7-0) \nMountain Grove (6-1) at Houston (4-3) \nCabool (0-7) at Ava (4-3) \nBig 8 \nMcDonald County (1-6) at Mount Vernon (3-4) \nLamar (7-0) at Aurora (4-3) \nEast Newton (0-7) at Cassville (2-5) \nSeneca (2-5) at Carl Junction (7-0) \nSpring River Valley \nLockwood (6-0) at Miller (1-5) \nDiamond (4-2) at Liberal (2-4)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T08:59:37.797+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
