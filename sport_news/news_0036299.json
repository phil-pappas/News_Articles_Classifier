The regular season and subsequent post-season tournament will run through the middle of November.\n\"This is a lot of fun,\" said Varney's teammate, Lauren Miller, 15 and a sophomore at Boca Raton High who has played basketball since the fifth grade. \"You can meet new people and you make new friends.\"\nAnother teammate, 13-year-old Sophia Scroggie, is one of the youngest players in the Girls Under-16 Division. The eighth-grader at Unity School helped her middle school team win league championships in basketball and lacrosse.\n\"I am practicing more to help me get ready for the [Boca Hoops] season,\" said Scroggie, who is playing in the league for the first time. \"After [Boca Hoops] is over, I go straight into my season at Unity.\"\nBermuda Landscaping coach Brad Miller has spent five years in the league.\n\"It is all about the kids,\" Miller said. \"It's great watching them develop and progress throughout the season. They are all good kids.\"\nLoren Coffer, 14, also enjoys being part of the Boca Hoops action.\n\"So far, the competition is pretty good,\" said Coffer, a member of the Macular Magic squad and an eighth-grader at Boca Raton Middle School.\nCaroline Applewhite, 13, who also plays for the Macular Magic team, has been playing in Boca Hoops for five years. The Don Estridge Middle School eighth-grader said there is an equal emphasis on teamwork and winning.\n\"I think the competition from the other teams helps you become a better player,\" said Applewhite, 13. \"You can watch [the other players] and see how they move the ball around and how they play.\"\nTaylor Bennett, 13, has played basketball since age 5. The eighth-grader at Boca Raton Middle School said it is nice that the city offers the Boca Hoops program.\n\"It brings everyone together,\" Bennett said. \"I have known these players a long time, ever since I started. It is good to see them year after year at Boca Hoops. It is not only about winning. It also teaches you about having fun and trying your best.\"\nMacular Magic coach Doug Bennett, Taylor's father, enjoys watching his players grow.\n\"It is very gratifying,\" he said. \"I love watching them get better. From the beginning of the year to the end, it is a world of difference, and they can see it, too. At this age, I think it is about them having fun together. I think it is always great to win, but they really enjoying being with each other.\"\nJody Forstot, who founded Boca Hoops 27 years ago, said there are about 1,000 players ages 8-15 allocated to 100 teams within eight divisions. For the younger players, there is an instructional coed division where they are introduced to the sport in a fun setting.\nTo improve skills, the league has a rule where over the first three quarters, coaches are required to give each team member equal playing time. Then, in the fourth quarter, unlimited substitutions are allowed.\n\"For me, this is great,\" Forstot said. \"I love it. I have my grandkids playing. I have a 10-, 12- and 14-year-old playing.\"\nHave an idea for a sports centerpiece feature?
