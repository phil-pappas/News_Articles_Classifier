According to KEYE in Austin , Bevo passed away in his sleep on Friday at the age of 13: \nFollowing a preliminary diagnosis of the illness last week, BEVO XIV had been resting at his ranch, where he died in the company of his best longhorn friend Spike and John T. and Betty Baker, the owners and caretakers of both BEVO XIV and his predecessor, BEVO XIII. \n“BEVO XIV was so much more than a traditional mascot – he was so big and strong, but he had such a sweet personality and a gentle soul,” said Ricky Brennes, Executive Director of the Silver Spurs and BEVO XIV’s regular traveling partner. “He loved the attention that came with being BEVO but was very cool, calm and smart. Like a dog he would come when called by name, show up to the house looking for treats and even roll over on his side so Mrs. Baker could rub his belly. He did so much for his university and community. His last few days provided great memories, but we miss him already.” \nThe search for Bevo XV will begin immediately, with hopes that he’ll be gracing the Longhorns’ sideline for the 2016 season opener. \nBevo XIV had been in place since 2004 and was on hand when Texas won its most recent national championship in January 2006.
