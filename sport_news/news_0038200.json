They know that even when we play teams that we feel like we should beat, I tell them they have to jump on top of them and make sure they win the game so we put ourselves in a spot for districts or leagues. They literally have no time to relax. There's no letdowns. Every game's a battle. I asked them to come prepared for this game and they were. It just didn't work out our way.\" \nNazareth got two first-half goals from Amy Strauser to clinch the win over the Vikings on Thursday. \n\"I'm extremely proud of my girls today. They did everything I asked them to,\" Gorski said. \"They executed the game plan. I thought it was working very early. We had a good three or four opportunities in front of net. Their goalkeeper ( Caitlyn Lazzarini ) does a great job. She did a great job on those opportunities. I think there was a good part for about 10, 15 minutes in the first half where Nazareth was confusing our girls a little bit. No. 3 (Strauser) is a very a good player. She got two shots on goal and buried both of them. The second half we came out, I thought my girls did a great job of trying to rally. They were pressing them all second half, unfortunately we couldn't any goals to go in.\" \nCentral Catholic is 10-5-1 overall on the season and trails Nazareth (10-4-2), Whitehall (10-2-1) and Parkland (16-1) in the very challenging division. \nDespite the rough schedule, the Vikings have managed to go 6-2-1 in their last nine games, securing a District 11 playoff spot. \nWith Northampton and Emmaus coming up next week, Central Catholic will try to clinch a spot in the EPC playoffs. \n\"There's some teams from other divisions kind of nipping at our heels. The girls know that. We have to come to play this week if we want to guarantee ourselves a spot,\" Gorski said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T08:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T02:19:19.135+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
