Photo gallery: Scenes from Thursday's game \nBrothers Dylan Hopkins and Joel Hopkins accounted for three touchdowns apiece in the first half, and Isaiah Cobb added a 69-yard touchdown run as the top-ranked Rebels (7-0, 4-0 Region 1-6A) cruised to their state-best 37th consecutive victory. \n“It starts with our quarterback in our offense” Maryville coach George Quarles said. “The quarterback has to make some plays, and Dylan Hopkins did that for us early. I think when we watch film, we’ll find he made some really good decisions.” \nNot bad for Hopkins’ second start as Maryville’s quarterback. \nThe sophomore accounted for 270 yards, completing 6 of 8 passes for 199 yards and a touchdown and adding 71 rushing yards and two touchdowns on just three carries against sixth-ranked Dobyns-Bennett. \nIt’s the first game Hopkins hasn’t rotated at quarterback this season. Junior Austin Ensley had made five starts this season and shared time with Hopkins, but Ensley was dismissed on Wednesday along with starting defensive back Cameron Russell for violating team rules. \nThere were some admitted “jitters” early for Hopkins, but he found a groove in a hurry. \nHe sandwiched Joel Hopkins’ two 1-yard TD runs with a 12-yard scamper in the first quarter, then added a 17-yard scoring run to open the second. His 80-yard touchdown pass to Kelby Brock (three catches, 140 yards) moments later gave Maryville a 35-0 lead, and Cobb’s long touchdown run pushed the lead to 49-7. \nNeither team scored in the second half. \n“I overthrew Kelby on a slant on the opening possession,” Dylan Hopkins said. “But I settled down after that.” \nThe offensive prowess overshadowed a dominant defensive outing for Maryville. \nDobyns-Bennett (4-2, 2-1) converted just 3 of 13 third-down plays, and didn’t threaten to score until the game was out of hand. \nBlake Rogers punched in the Indians’ only touchdown on a 3-yard run late in the second quarter, and Landon Salyers added a 43-yard field goal in the final minute of the half. \n“We’re not as dominant looking,” Quarles said. “We don’t have the size we had last year. But we have guys making plays.” \nChris Thomas covers high school sports. Follow him on Twitter at twitter.com/prepxtra . Copyright 2015 Journal Media Group. All rights reserved.
