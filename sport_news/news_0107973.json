Georgia Tech has lost five in a row to opponents who are combined 27-4 this season.\n\"We knew it was going to be a tough schedule and we haven't won any of the close games,\" Johnson said. \"I would venture to say every game but Clemson we've been right in the game in the fourth quarter.\n\"We just have to find a way to a game, make plays when we have to.\"\nMaking plays has been a season-long struggle.\nAgainst Pittsburgh, the Jackets' defense faced 66 snaps and didn't have a minus-yardage play. On Pitt's winning drive, it gave up two fourth-down conversions and allowed the Panthers to hold the ball for 7 of the game's last 8 minutes before Chris Blewitt's stunning 56-yard field goal.\nOn the opening drive of the second half, the offense advanced to Pitt's 47 before losing 23 yards on three straight plays. And midway through the fourth quarter, running Clinton Lynch had an inexplicable pass interference call that led to a punt two snaps later.\nGeorgia Tech didn't make so many blunders last year, advancing to the ACC title game and winning the Orange Bowl to finish 11-3.\nNow, suffering the longest losing streak since the 1994 team went 1-10, the Jackets will find it difficult to reach a bowl for the 19th consecutive year.\nThey'd need to go 4-1 against Florida State, Virginia, Virginia Tech, Miami and Georgia to have a chance.\n\"You've got to put it behind you,\" Johnson said. \"You have to move on because the challenge is getting bigger. I mean it ain't getting any easier this Saturday. So you've got to dial in and focus, look at the tape, how can we fix it, you put in a plan and you go play.\"\nThere were some bright spots last week. Freshman Marcus Marshall, despite some difficulties blocking, averaged 15.9 yards rushing on 10 carries and scored two touchdowns in his first career start.\nQuarterback Justin Thomas broke off runs of 51 and 45 yards and led a spread option attack that set a school single-game record of 9.4 yards per carry.\nBut the offense still isn't playing well enough to overshadow the inadequacies of a defense that's allowing over 27 points per game and ranks second-worst against the run in the ACC.\n\"Last year we were really good on offense — really good, probably as good as you've ever been here, ever,\" Johnson said. \"They could carry more of the load. This year's team is playing five freshmen. They're not that good right now.\n___\nAP College Football website: www.collegefootball.ap.org\n1 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Copyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
