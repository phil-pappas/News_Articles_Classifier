Now I'm like 'I don't know where it's going next'. There is no-one else I look to, that I want to equal or emulate now.\" \nHamilton, who surpassed his boyhood hero Senna's tally of 41 career victories in Russia earlier this month, added: \"I feel like I've got the baton now for myself and Ayrton and I'm going to carry it as far as I can, as strong as I can and keep building and see where I take it. \n\"As a kid, I just wanted to be world champion and so it's kind of crazy to think that me and Ayrton, in terms of championships, stand on the same line which is just the greatest.\" \nHamilton can now head to the final three rounds in Mexico, Brazil and Abu Dhabi safe in the knowledge his third championship is in the bank. \nIt is a different sensation for the Briton whose two previous triumphs have been determined at season finales in Abu Dhabi last year and in Brazil in 2008. \n\"The first I won 17 seconds before the end of the race, and obviously last year it was amazing but it took a lot out of us,\" said Hamilton added. \n\"This one still feels just as special, if not more special. I think this has to have topped last year for me, being as it's equalling Ayrton.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T06:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T20:24:47.389+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
