Couldn't even have dreamt this.\"\nThe Internationals trailed 9.5 to 8.5 going into the final day at the Jack Nicklaus Golf Club Korea but got the first point on the board when Adam Scott thrashed an out-of-sorts Rickie Fowler 6&5 to level the match.\nLouis Oosthuizen eagled the 18th to claim a half of his match against Patrick Reed, while fellow South African Branden Grace beat Matt Kuchar 2&1 and became just the fifth player to win five matches at a single Presidents Cup.\nAmerican veteran Phil Mickelson, who has played in all 11 Presidents Cups but needed a captain's pick for the first time since 1994, crushed Charl Schwartzel 5&4, while Dustin Johnson overcame a game Danny Lee, who led by one through 14 but then lost three in a row.\nNO BLAME GAME\nThe early American red plastered across the other matches on the scoreboard began to fade in the afternoon as Japanese sensation Matsuyama fought back to beat J.B. Holmes and Thai Jaidee took an unexpected half point when Bubba Watson missed from five feet on the 18th.\nWatson missed a similar tiddler at the same hole on Saturday but he was not the only one who struggled with short putts on the difficult final hole.\nLahiri, the first Indian to play at the Presidents Cup, lipped out from just over two feet to hand Chris Kirk victory, just as the Internationals looked to be turning the corner.\n\"I had Bubba Watson come up to me about a minute after we finished up and he said that he had done the same exact thing,\" said a despondent Lahiri. \"I guess wasn't meant to be unfortunately.\"\nAfter Spieth was stunned by Australian Marc Leishman and Day lost to Zach Johnson, the Cup boiled down to the final match between two captain's picks -- Haas and Bae.\nSouth Korean Bae, playing in his last event before he swaps four irons for firearms and begins compulsory military service, trailed by one with two holes to play and drained a 10-footer on the 17th that kept the Internationals' hopes of a tie alive.\nWith the home crowd's hopes on his shoulders and the fate of his team in his hands, the pressure finally told on Bae and he cracked on the last, stubbing his chip into a steep bank and seeing the ball roll back down the hill.\nInternational skipper Nick Price was determined no blame should be apportioned to Bae and Lahiri and said his team could have had a much easier task had it not been for their woeful foursomes performance on the opening day.\n\"I don't want any of you to be negative in any way toward Anirban and to Moon,\" Price told reporters.\n\"The truth of it is, is that if we got off to a better start on Thursday and we had not been 4-1 down, it might not have been quite as exciting today ... so we all feel for Anirban and for Moon for what happened. But they are part of our team, and we will leave here as a team.\"\nThe Presidents Cup returns to U.S. soil in two years' time at Liberty National, New Jersey before coming to Melbourne for a third time in 2019.\n(Editing by Amlan Chakraborty )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T12:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T12:24:04.312+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
