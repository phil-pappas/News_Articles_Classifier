(Photo: File art) CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nWeek 6 was the start of the district season for the majority of the Central Louisiana teams, while District 3-3A stepped into the heart of league play. \nEven though the top and the bottom spots remained the same, nearly everything in between changed as a good week of football set the tone for some key games for this coming week. \nSo without further ado... \n1. Menard (6-0, LW: 1): No sweat last week for the Eagles as they dominated Rosepine, 58-0, to kick off their District 3-2A schedule. While Menard's running game performed as usual during its homecoming tilt (238 yards on 32 carries), the passing game flourished against the visiting Eagles secondary as Keesler Morrison passed for 233 yards and five touchdowns in a banner day. Those yards will be harder to come by Friday, when the Eagles travel to Many for the right to stay in first place in the district. \n2. Jena (6-0, LW: 4): The Giants remained undefeated as they ran over, through and around Vidalia to stay atop the 3-3A standings with Marksville. Jena tallied 28 first downs and 325 rushing yards as Jordan Mitchell found the end zone twice, while the team jumped up to a 35-0 lead before the Vikings got on the board. A key game awaits for the Giants, as they travel to Marksville with sole possession atop 3-3A on the line. \n3. St. Mary's (6-0, LW: 3): The Tigers continue to work hard, as they blasted Montgomery, 42-6, and held on to the No. 1 spot atop the LSWA's Class 1A rankings. St. Mary's limited Montgomery to 124 yards and five first downs, while sophomore quarterback Aaron Howell accounted for three touchdowns — two passing. The Tigers travel west to Logansport this week. \n4. ASH (5-1, LW: 6): The Trojans regained bragging rights in the Red River Rivalry as they survived a wild 49-40 shootout to ensure at least a .500 regular season record for the first time since 2012. Senior quarterback Matthew Beck completed 25 of his 36 passes for 373 yards and five touchdowns, as Suede Taylor and Jorian Vallien both eclipsed the 100-yard receiving mark. Alexandria Senior High heads to Monroe for a matchup with Ouachita, after it came back to defeat Natchitoches Central. \n5. Natchitoches Central (4-2, LW: 2): Speaking of the Chiefs, they have nothing to be ashamed of as they nearly knocked off the Lions for the second consecutive year, if not for a 33-yard touchdown pass from Davion Warren to Desmond Jones with 46 seconds remaining. NCHS nearly had a pair of 100-yard rushers as Josh Fortenberry (97 yards) and Austin Guy (90) helped the Chiefs gain 283 yards on the ground. The Chiefs will be up for a challenge Friday when they welcome West Monroe, which is ranked No. 1 in the LHSAA Class 5A power ratings. \n6. Pickering (4-2, LW: 8): The Red Devils are getting healthy at the perfect time as they defeated Oakdale, 35-14, to kick off their district slate. Junior quarterback Patrick Hinson passed for 168 yards and ran for 115 as he helped Pickering snap a two-game losing streak that it suffered against DeRidder and Mangham. Up next for the Devils is Bunkie in one of two marquee matchups in District 3-2A Friday. \n7. Marksville (4-2, LW: 9): The Tiger starters had a quick night last week as they blasted Bolton, 64-7, to keep pace with Jena in 3-3A. Despite the short night, Marksville running back Romeo Williams carried the ball five times for 123 yards — highlighted by a 79-yard touchdown run to open a 29-point first quarter for the team. The Tigers hope to make it four straight in the homecoming game with Jena. \n8. Bunkie (5-1, LW: 7): The Panthers had Many down right where they wanted it at halftime with a 10-6 lead, but they could not keep the visiting team down for long. Nevertheless, Bunkie senior running back Joe Murray still managed to run for 112 yards in nine carries, as the team proved that it can hang with the district's elite. A battle with Pickering takes place Friday as the Panthers hope to avoid going 0-2 in 3-2A. \n9. Leesville (3-3, LW: 5): Still possibly feeling the effects of an injury he suffered against Iowa, Wampus Cat junior running Cory McCoy was severely limited against Washington-Marion as the team lost, 19-14, to kick off 3-4A play. The Chargin' Indians held McCoy to 40 yards on 15 carries as Leesville could not generate any offense. The Cats host 1-5 Rayne Friday in an attempt to snap a two-game losing streak. \n10. Pineville (3-3, LW: 10): The Rebels gave ASH everything, but the valiant effort fell short despite 281 yards on 30 carries by senior running back Jarious Green. Pineville carved up the Trojan defense for 548 yards — 457 rushing — but could not pull within a possession of the lead in the game's final nine minutes. The Rebels head to Ruston, with both teams hoping to shake off a loss to start district play. \nGafford's 11th: Peabody (2-3, LW: NR): For the first time this season, the holder of the Gafford's 11th spot did not win, so the Warhorses will be charged with the task to bring back the good luck of the spot. Peabody dominated and grounded the Avoyelles high-powered attack Saturday, as Sadrick \"Wanya\" Kirklin passed for 169 yards and two touchdowns to spark the offense. The Warhorses will try to gallop to another victory when they make the short drive to Bolton this week.
