The hard part is figuring out which ones should stick to energize squad By Iain MacIntyre, Vancouver Sun October 2, 2015 Jared McCann is making Vancouver Canucks GM Jim Benning’s life difficult. The 19-year-old surpassed expectations in the pre-season, and could force his way on the NHL roster. Photograph by: DARRYL DYCK , THE CANADIAN PRESS \nJake Virtanen is on my team, and so is Jared McCann. Probably they’re on your teams, too. \nI’d like rookie defenceman Ben Hutton on my team as well, but it’s difficult to find a way to make that happen because I’m not exposing Frankie Corrado on waivers and would prefer not to waive Yannick Weber, either. \nIt’s tough being a National Hockey League general manager. \nBut it’s much better for Vancouver Canuck boss Jim Benning now than it was during the summer, when he was getting spit-roasted for trading folk-hero backup goalie Eddie Lack and, among other moves, an incongruous trade that sent 24-year-old Zack Kassian to the Montreal Canadiens for 31-year-old Brandon Prust. \nThe biggest challenge Friday and this weekend for Benning and his hockey-operations staff is deciding how many of their impressive A-list prospects to keep — uh, just about all of them — and whom to drop from the NHL roster to make room for them. \nThe team re-assigned forwards Brendan Gaunce and Ronalds Kenins to the American League on Friday, a few hours after third-string goalie Richard Bachman and depth defenceman Taylor Fedun were sent to the Utica Comets. Gaunce, who showed well in the pre-season and elevated his standing in the organization, is still a winner despite his demotion. But Kenins, who spent the second half of last season with the Canucks, is one of the September losers. Incumbent centre Linden Vey could become another. \nThe Canucks need something or someone to re-energize fans who have watched the team erode and slip year-by-year farther from the Stanley Cup since Vancouver’s appearance in the 2011 final. Exciting young players — if they’re ready to play — can do this. Centre Bo Horvat did it last season. \nThe Canucks have their final pre-season game Saturday night at home against the Edmonton Oilers but it sure looks like the training-camp winners will include 19-year-old forwards Virtanen and McCann. \n“This is a good problem to have,” Benning said Friday between staff meetings to discuss how to shoehorn all the newcomers into the lineup. “A lot of young players have come in and taken the next step and look like they’re ready to compete in the NHL. We’ve had a two-week sample size and we want to make sure we’re making the right decisions. \n“We said all along if the players deserved (to be in the NHL) we would try to make moves to get them here and get them in our lineup.” \nWhen training camp opened 15 days ago, power-forward Virtanen, already possessing NHL size and disposition, was considered the only rookie with a realistic chance of making the Canucks. Much has changed in two weeks. This is why, every coach and manager in the history of hockey will tell you, they play the pre-season. \nVirtanen has a couple of goals in exhibition games but has been noticeable most nights for his power — a willingness to drive to the net and through opponents. But McCann, a first-round pick chosen after Virtanen in 2014, has looked stronger and more dangerous offensively with each game. Wherever McCann has been plugged into the lineup, he has played effectively. \nHe wasn’t thought two weeks ago to be strong enough to play in the NHL now, but has continued to stand out as the calibre of the pre-season ramps up with stronger lineups. McCann, a centre, has been tried on the wing. He looks good on the power play. He can help the Canucks now. \nIn the last 10 years, the Canucks have had one 19-year-old player: Horvat. For the season-opener Wednesday in Calgary, they could have two. By the way, Horvat is another big winner from September, having played his way into an offensive role, possibly partnering top goal-scorer Radim Vrbata. \nSince the Canucks also like journeyman free-agent acquisition Adam Cracknell, easily the best fit among the centres auditioned on the fourth line, getting Virtanen and McCann on the roster probably means putting Vey on waivers, which did not apply to Kenins. \nKenins and Vey have been flat-out outplayed in the pre-season. \nBut the danger in keeping teenagers, who are ineligible to play in the American League, is that they can look ready for the NHL in October but by November are overwhelmed and need to return to junior hockey. By then, the Canucks could have lost Vey or another player. \n“But if that’s the way we decide to go, we feel we have other guys in the system who can replace them,” Benning said of this scenario. “We feel we have enough depth to handle that.” \nBenning, of course, wouldn’t say who will still be with the Canucks on Sunday. But he acknowledged the single biggest surprise of training camp has been 22-year-old defenceman Ben Hutton, a fifth-round pick who leads the Canucks in pre-season scoring after spending the last three years at the University of Maine. \nTwo weeks ago, the Canucks’ seven defencemen seemed set in cement. Benning may take a jackhammer to them to make room for Hutton. Weber and Corrado would be candidates to go, although the Canucks could choose to keep everyone as part of an eight-defenceman package. \n“We knew Ben Hutton was going to be a good player, but we didn’t know he was going to challenge for a lineup spot this year,” Benning said. “We thought he would become a top-four defenceman eventually, but we didn’t know he could play with this kind of poise with the puck. On any given night, he has been one of our top two or three defencemen.” \nAnd why wouldn’t you want a guy like that in your opening-night lineup?", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T05:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T16:33:18.694+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
