After junior Bryce Brandt sacked Haener on third down, the quarterback hit senior Traehone Banda for a 33-yard gain that was 7 yards short of the first down. \nRamos ran for two first downs and then knelt three times as the Ugly Eagles began chanting from the sideline as the last seconds ticked off. \nClayton Valley Charter coach Tim Murphy credited his defense before adding, \"Offense came through on that last drive.\" \nThat game-winning drive started on an interception in the end zone by senior Ja'Ron Jackson, whom Murphy called \"the best DB we've had since I've been at this school.\" \nMost of the drive was powered by senior tailback Ray Jackson III, who had 208 yards and two touchdowns on 32 carries, though just as integral was the Ugly Eagles' lone pass of the night. On fourth-and-4, Ramos hit senior Robert Carson for an 8-yard gain. Then Jackson took a pitch to the left for 36 yards to set up four keepers by Ramos that culminated in the leaping score.

You know you're not going to get that many, and you've got to take advantage of it. First half, I thought we did. Second half, we just had too many mental mistakes.\" \nThat first half included two 10-point leads for Monte Vista. The Mustangs built the first double-digit advantage on a 30-yard field goal by Peyton Henry and a 3-yard touchdown pass from Haener to senior Noah Sol (13 catches for 112 yards). Haener was 23 for 32 on the night for 265 yards, almost half of which were caught by Banda (seven for 122 yards). \nJackson zigzagged for a 49-yard touchdown to get Clayton Valley Charter on the board. \nHaener's 10-yard scoring strike to Garrett Fitzgerald gave the Mustangs a 17-7 lead. \nJackson finished off Clayton's ensuing drive with an 8-yard touchdown. \n\"The offensive line started picking it up,\" Murphy said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T08:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T09:56:05.429+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
