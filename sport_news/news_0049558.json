Nor were they expecting to benefit from similar good fortune in the first of two potential elimination games this weekend at Kauffman Stadium. \n“He gave up a hit on the first pitch and then he didn’t give up another hit until the seventh inning,” Royals manager Ned Yost said on Thursday as his team prepared to face the ace the would-be ace for a second time in the series. “He’s a guy that’s in the top five in the voting for Cy Young. He’s a tough matchup. \n“We’re just going to have to hope that we can take advantage of mistakes, if he makes any, and just keep battling.” \nWhen asked what his Royals hitters can take away from that decisive seventh inning, Yost didn’t flinch: “Nothing.” \nPerhaps that’s why Yost has been such a solid manager and his player’s — especially at the plate — are so mentally strong. The Royals weren’t going to refund the win, but they know that some nights getting bat on ball can benefit from some good fortune. \nThe skipper wouldn’t get any argument from those in the Kansas City batting order, either. To a man, the hitters that got to Price in Game 2 knew they didn’t necessarily smack around a pitcher poised to be a $200-million man in the off-season. \nAfter surrendering a single on his first pitch of the game, Price retired 18 Royals in a row, was staked to a 3-0 lead and looked destined for his first career playoff “W” as a starter. \nWhat happened next will make for a long winter for all involved if the Jays don’t capture the next two in K.C. \nThe Ryan Goins botch of a routine pop up started it and four hits to the subsequent six batters sealed it. \n“I don’t even know how to explain (what happened), quite honestly,” Royals first baseman Eric Hosmer said of what seemed an unlikely rally given how effective Price had been. “The guy was still nasty, even in the seventh. He was doing a good job of working the outside of the plate with us. We just tried to stay patient.” \nLike most MLB teams, the Royals take pride in the video work they put in on pitchers and upon further review of Game 2, they found nothing to think they have the 30-year-old left-hander solved. They certainly didn’t rock Price, more accurately they stayed patient in working the count in mentally tough at-bats. \nOn Thursday here, Price gave credit to those Royals hitters, in particular praising Lorenzo Cain’s single that kept the inning going as a “good piece of hitting.” \nBased on what they saw in Game 2, the Royals certainly don’t believe Price’s 1-2 record and 7.02 earned run average this post season is representative of what he can do. In fact, if Price is on again, suddenly it may be the Royals who tighten up. \nIf the Jays can ride the starter that helped them get to the playoffs in the first place, they will move onto Marcus Stroman, the man who threatened to replace him as the ace late in the season. Back at Kauffman Stadium, though, the Royals hitters are at their peck-away-at-you best. \n“It’s a tough lineup, they use their speed,” Price said of the Royals. “They’re not going to beat themselves and that’s what you’ve got to do at this point of the season. \n“This is the same situation we were in against Texas in the Division Series. This team does a very good job of focussing on the task at hand. That’s what this team has done an extremely good job of ever since I’ve been here. It’s been pretty impressive.” \nOther than the end result in Game 2, that’s about how the Kansas City Royals view David Price as well.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T03:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T03:21:14.620+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
