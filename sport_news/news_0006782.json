He’s handled it unbelievably well. But I think it’s been way, way too much. \n“The media coverage, the constant comparisons and everything that’s out there right now I think is just way over the top and just not necessary. \n“I just hope and pray Connor can filter all that stuff out and figure out how to go and play without having to deal with all that other stuff. \n“That’s my big wish. \n“I just hope he can put all of that other stuff out of his head and ignore it. \n“I hope he can just go and concentrate on being a young player trying to figure out how he can fit in the league and help his team at the same time. \n“My hope is that it goes away. \n“I’m not overly optimistic on that. But Kelly and I talk about it quite a bit. We just want it to go away and let him focus on doing what he’s doing.” \nIn a way, the McDavids appreciate what their son has gone through in the past three years, first with the granting of exceptional player status and the notoriety that came with that and then the attention which came with the draft lottery and the draft itself. He basically received basic training for this. \n“It’s been three years of it,” said Brian. \n“When he went through the exceptional player status he entered the OHL with a lot of eyes focused on him. It was the same year as the NHL lockout and there was NHL Network coverage of OHL games and he seemed to be in the news back then. And of course there was everything he experienced leading up to the draft. \nRelated - Jones breaks down how many more points the Oilers will get \n“So I think all of that has helped prepare him for what he’s gone through and is going through. \n“Connor is most at home when he’s on the ice. When all the other things are swirling around him, when he’s on the ice, he’s where he’s supposed to be.” \nThe McDavids will fly from Toronto to St. Louis today to watch Connor play his first game in the NHL with the Edmonton Oilers against the Blues tonight. \n“We wouldn’t miss this first game for anything. We’d walk if we had to,” said Brian. \nThey’ll be in Edmonton next Thursday to watch Connor play his first game at home. Then they’ll drive to Calgary for his first Hockey Night In Canada and Battle of Alberta game two nights later. \n“So we’ll see three of the first five games, I guess,” he said. \nThere will then be long stretches not seeing their second-born son. And it’s already been tough. \nPeople forget. Conner McDavid is an 18-year-old kid. While he’s been away playing junior hockey in Erie with the Otters, that’s an Edmonton to Calgary drive away from Newmarket, Ontario. His parents seldom went more than a few days not seeing him. The Oilers training camp stretch felt like an eternity. \nDad Brian flew to Edmonton to watch him play the pre-season game against Arizona. \n“It was kind of fun. I got to see Dylan Strome, who he played with in Erie. Dylan is a very close friend of his and we know Dylan’s parents and Dylan very well. I got a chance to speak with him for five or seven minutes. It was really nice. It was friendly. There were a few laughs. It was really good.” \nBut the trip, taken without wife Kelly, was mostly to see his son. \n“It had been a while since I’d seen him, probably the longest period of time since I hadn’t seen him. I’m very close to both of my boys and it’s tough when they leave and in the case of Connor, I spent a lot of time coaching him when he was younger. This past summer we played golf together a lot. It was just nice having him around. And it was difficult to see him go so far away. \n“Nonetheless, he’s following his dream. But it was a bittersweet time, to be honest with you. It was terrific for him in pursuing his dream, something he’s dreamed about his whole life but at the same time we’re still a family and it’s still tough when your children leave. \n“It was great just to see him. We had dinner a couple of times. It was great.” \nThe McDavids’ oldest son, Cameron, is 3 1/2 years older than Conner and will be coming out to Edmonton next week for the home opener and game in Calgary. Cameron is attending the Ivey Business School in London, Ont., recognized as one of the best schools in the country. \nSeeing and following Connor in the OHL was no problem. \n“We drove to Erie a lot. I couldn’t count the number of times over the three years. Generally when they played on the weekends they’d play Friday, Saturday so we’d leave Friday afternoon, have breakfast with him Saturday, see him after the game again Saturday night and would often stay and spend time with him on Sunday as well. \n“And we didn’t have to go to Erie to see him for any length. The Otters would be playing in Guelph, Kitchener, London, Peterborough, Oshawa and Barrie and places like that. \n“We got to see him frequently. So to have him out in Edmonton is … well, it’s a lot further away. \n“We are planning to come in at Christmas when they’re home for a long stretch there and again in February,” he said of a pair of six-game homestands. \nThere’s also the “circled on the calendar” Nov. 30th game in Toronto, Feb. 4th and 5th games in Ottawa and Montreal and March 1st visit to Buffalo. \nWhen Brian, the hockey coach, sat in Rexall Place, he tried to evaluate Connor objectively. \n“He looked good. You could tell he has great legs and a good head for the game. During the game I remember texting my wife: ‘He belongs. There’s no question.’ Sponsored Links", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T07:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T12:23:16.915+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
