At 41 years old, he is running low on chances to score his first Cup title.\nEleventh in Chase points, Junior needs a win Sunday in the second-round finale to stay in the Chase hunt for the third-round races at Martinsville, Texas and Phoenix.\nAlthough other Chase drivers, notably Matt Kenseth and Kyle Busch, also are in deep holes entering Sunday’s race, Earnhardt Jr. will be firmly in the spotlight. The Talladega grandstand crowd typically is weighed heavily toward Earnhardt, and he is among the circuit’s best drivers at its biggest track.\n“We’re taking the same car we won with earlier this year, so it’s got great speed and we feel confident,” Earnhardt Jr. said. “It really helps when you have a great car. We’ve had a fast car at the last couple of plate tracks — we’ve won at Talladega and Daytona, so it really helps when your car is that dominant.\n“It makes it a lot easier on the driver to do his job and fend off challenges and get the car to the front in the first place.”\nEarnhardt Jr. is 31 points behind eighth place in the Chase standings.\nJunior hasn’t won three Sprint Cup point races at restrictor-plate tracks in a single season, although he owns six wins at Talladega and four at Daytona International Speedway. He is tied with Jeff Gordon for most wins at Talladega among active drivers.\nA win Sunday would make Earnhardt Jr. the first driver to win three plate races in a season since his father in 1990.\nJunior led the final 55 laps in winning the July race at Daytona.\nAfter disappointing finishes at Charlotte (28) and Kansas (21) in this Chase round, Earnhardt Jr. expressed confidence that Talladega could provide his rescue.\n“I wouldn’t rather be going anywhere else than Talladega for the next race if we need a win,” he said Sunday after the Kansas race. “That is a good opportunity for us. Even over Daytona, I think we can go to Talladega and do the job.”\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.usatoday.com/sports/", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T02:53:32.564+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
