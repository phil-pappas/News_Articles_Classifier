They were unsure what happened other than seeing Greg Olsen standing in the end zone celebrating a winning touchdown. \nAfter a week of vowing the fourth-quarter collapses were over, the Seattle Seahawks crumpled once again. \n“It’s very frustrating, especially when you know we had them,” Thomas said. “We don’t (stink). We know who we are. We’re not finishing. We know we’re going to be in those pressure situations every game.” \nCam Newton was the culprit this time, leading a pair of long fourth-quarter touchdown drives and capping Carolina’s rally with a 26-yard touchdown pass to Olsen with 32 seconds left in the Panthers’ 27-23 win over Seattle on Sunday. \nIt was the second straight loss for the Seahawks (2-4), who are facing a climb beyond just correcting their continued problems in closing out games. According to STATS, since 1990 only 14 of 168 teams to start the season 2-4 have reached the playoffs and none have ever reached the Super Bowl. \nThat was the expectation for Seattle before the season. And now, it’s just getting the problems fixed. \n“To be where we are right now, it puts us in a position of tremendous adversity for a team,” coach Pete Carroll said. “It calls on you a lot of stuff, but it calls on us to believe in the guys in the locker room and believe in what we’re doing and hang together until we get things right.” \nCarroll noted that Seattle believes it should be 6-0 considering in all six games the Seahawks have held a lead in the fourth quarter. \nBut the claim stands hollow when the results don’t match the statement and the track record continues to be mostly failure. Seattle held fourth-quarter leads of at least seven points against St. Louis, Cincinnati and Carolina and lost all three. \nThis time, Seattle led 23-14 with 11:46 left after Steven Hauschka’s third field goal. The lead was still 11 when it took possession at its own 20 with 8:08 remaining. Over their final two drives, the Panthers ran 17 plays, rolled up 160 total yards and scored 14 points. Newton was 12 of 15 for 162 yards in the fourth quarter and threw for 269 yards overall. \nJonathan Stewart made it a 23-20 game when he scored on a 1-yard TD run with 3:55 remaining. Seattle was unable to run out the clock and punted back to the Panthers with 2:20 left. \nNewton hit two quick passes that got the ball to the Carolina 46 at the two-minute warning. Newton hit Ed Dickson to the Seattle 40, but Bruce Irvin sacked Newton back near midfield, forcing the Panthers to use their final timeout with 1:20 remaining. \nNewton rebounded to hit Devin Funchess for 16 yards and Jerricho Cotchery caught a contested 7-yard pass. After spiking the ball and moving quickly to the line, Newton saw confusion in Seattle’s secondary, hitting Olsen wide open for the winning score with Thomas and Sherman looking at each other in confusion. \nThe reason Olsen was so wide open was mixed signals in Seattle’s secondary. Sherman got one call from the sideline while Thomas and others got a different call. The result was Olsen running uncovered. \n“You’re not open that much against these guys,” Olsen said. “They cover so much ground, there’s usually bodies around you when you catch the ball. But we’ll take it.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T06:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T08:08:01.311+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
