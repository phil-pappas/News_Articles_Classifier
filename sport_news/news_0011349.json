(AP Photo/Kin Cheung) \nHONG KONG (AP) — Venus Williams closed in on a spot in the season-ending WTA Finals by beating Alize Cornet 6-1, 6-1 Friday to reach the Hong Kong Open semifinals. \nThe third-seeded American, a seven-time Grand Slam champion, won the Wuhan Open this month. \nWilliams will next meet either Jelena Jankovic or Daria Gavrilova. \n“I’m not thinking of winning that match only,” Williams said. “My goal here is to win the tournament.” \nAngelique Kerber and Samantha Stosur also advanced, and will face each other in the semifinals. Stosur beat Heather Watson 4-6, 6-3, 6-0 while Kerber defeated Caroline Garcia 7-5, 6-3. \n“I lost my way at the outset but being a three-set match, I didn’t let it bother me,” said Stosur, the 2011 U.S. Open champion. “It doesn’t matter if you don’t start fantastic, what matters is how you finish.” Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T16:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T16:40:13.052+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
