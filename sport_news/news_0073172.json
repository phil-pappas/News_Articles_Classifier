Courtesy of Chicago Suburban Antiques Dealers Association Debbie McArdle \"Timeless Design\" will be the theme of the 41st annual Fall Fox Valley Antiques Show in St. Charles. The show's atrium will captivate attendees as they enter, welcomed by the steampunk offerings of Nathan Rock of Industrial Artifacts & Facebook's \"American Dealers\", new to the Fox Valley Antiques Show. He will focus on the form and function of furniture and lighting from the industrial age; his mission, in his own words, \"to preserve America's history one piece at a time\". Several other time-traveling vendors, new to the Fox Valley Antiques Show, are Buckingham Antiques of Texas; Randall Hopkins, of England; and American Sampler of Barnsville, Maryland. John & Nancy Smith of American Sampler plan to bring many small, intensely interesting objects with strong figural content: a small sampling; a carved & polychromed panel with deer, a trolley sign \"Rules for Weather\", and a number of unusual figural door stops and hooked rugs.
