(AP Photo/Christophe Ena) \nLONDON (AP) — The latest at the Rugby World Cup (all times local): \n12 noon. \nIt’s time for the northern hemisphere teams to front up in the Rugby World Cup quarterfinals. \nNew Zealand thrashed France 62-13 and South Africa squeezed past Wales 23-19 as the Rugby Championship heavyweights got a jump-start in the battle of the hemispheres. \nEurope’s best chance for representation in the semifinals lies with Six Nations champion Ireland, which takes on Argentina in Sunday’s first game at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff. Then it’s Australia vs. Scotland to round off the quarterfinal stage. \nBy the end of Sunday, all roads lead to Twickenham, which will host the two semifinals next weekend and the final on Oct. 31.
