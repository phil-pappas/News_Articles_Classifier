But she's made a very smart decision to not contest the federal charges announced against her Thursday.\nHer lawyer and prosecutors said Byrd-Bennett is cooperating with authorities and plans to plead guilty to charges related to the 23-count indictment alleging her participation in a bribery and kickback scheme.\nIn practical terms this means she'll save lots of money in legal bills and spend far less time in prison than she would have had she gone to trial, where odds are, she would have been found guilty anyway.\nThe U.S. attorney's office seldom loses, so \"OK, ya got me!\" is a better response for most defendants than \"Hmm, how might I wriggle out of this?\"\nAt all levels of the justice system, those who choose to fight charges against them risk paying what's informally known as a \"trial tax\" — a longer sentence and/or steeper fine than they likely would have gotten in a plea bargain.\nA vivid example is former Gov. Rod Blagojevich. If he'd had the wisdom and perspective to admit to wrongdoing after his arrest on corruption charges in December 2008, and quickly begun serving his time, he'd surely be a free man today, delivering motivational speeches about redemption and planning some sort of comeback.\nCorruption at the top of Chicago Public Schools Editorial Board How did a north suburban consulting company land a $20.5 million no-bid contract to train principals for the Chicago Public Schools?\nThat's been an open question since April, when CPS revealed it had been served with federal subpoenas for documents related to its dealings with Wilmette-based SUPES...\nHow did a north suburban consulting company land a $20.5 million no-bid contract to train principals for the Chicago Public Schools?\nThat's been an open question since April, when CPS revealed it had been served with federal subpoenas for documents related to its dealings with Wilmette-based SUPES...\n(Editorial Board) Instead he fought the inevitable, chirped defiantly in the media and couldn't even bring himself to acknowledge his guilt at his sentencing hearing in late 2011 — the best he could manage was, \"I'm here convicted of crimes. The jury decided I was guilty. I am accepting of it.\"\nSo he got slammed with a startlingly long sentence that — barring a reduction at an upcoming reassessment ordered by an appellate court — won't see him at liberty until 2023.\nHere's a prediction: Though Byrd-Bennett was nabbed nearly seven years after Blagojevich and allegedly committed crimes more brazen and more contemptible than Blagojevich's sleazy machinations, she will be the first of the two to leave prison.\nOn the download\nGet ready to hear a lot in the coming months about \"Limetown,\" a compelling new podcast that has the potential to spark the long-predicted revival in radio drama.\nThe show tells its story in the style of an NPR documentary report and features a young reporter reinvestigating the unexplained disappearance of 327 people at a neuroscience research facility in rural Tennessee in 2004.\nPDF: Read the Barbara Byrd-Bennett indictment Read the story Fans have compared \"Limetown\" to \"Serial,\" the hit 2014 podcast in which reporter Sarah Koenig revived a real-life 1999 murder case in Baltimore, and to \"The X-Files,\" the 1993-2002 Fox TV drama in which sleuths dug into paranormal events.\nMy thought is that it also recalls \"Twin Peaks,\" the early 1990s ABC TV miniseries set in a creepy, mysterious small town, and Orson Welles' 1938 radio adaptation of \"War of the Worlds,\" a production that borrowed all the conventions of breaking-news reporting and had many listeners convinced that aliens had actually invaded America.\nWhat happened to all the people in \"Limetown\" — men, women and children; scientists and support staff — on that terrible night? What was the secret experiment they were conducting?\nActress Annie-Sage Whitehurst plays narrator Lia Haddock, an American Public Radio reporter on a mission to answer these and other questions. Her intimate dispatches blend interviews, sound effects and archival recordings in the seamless, nearly cinematic way listeners have come to expect from \"This American Life\" and other highly crafted audio productions.\nThe show's creators, former New York University film students Zack Akers and Skip Bronkie, released the first of seven episodes, a 30-minute scene-setter, at the end of July. The second episode, which took a dark turn into science fiction and was only 22 minutes long, didn't drop until Sept. 13. Shortly thereafter, word of mouth made \"Limetown\" the most downloaded podcast in America for a week, according to the iTunes chart.\nIt has since fallen to 20th place, but look for it to rocket up the charts again Monday when the highly anticipated third episode will be released. (\"Serial\" is in sixth place and two podcasts about \"Serial\" are in the top 30, even though that show hasn't released a new episode since December.)\nAudio theater was big and beloved before the advent of television, and \"golden age of radio\" enthusiasts have long predicted its revival — the scenery is better, goes the old saying, it's like books on tape come to life. But the vintage programs, with their corny sound effects and edgeless plots, never had much appeal for younger listeners. And what little new, original work was produced didn't have a big enough platform or proper outlet to generate a breakthrough hit.\nBut podcasts have changed all that. They're the ideal medium for such a revival — portable, free, easy to use. Subscribe to a show and new episodes automatically show up on your smartphone for when you're commuting, doing chores or exercising. Old episodes, for binge-listening purposes, are just a touch away.\nAnd talented producers and writers are at last taking advantage. \"Limetown\" is already a hit, as is the similarly eerie but less linear \"Welcome to Night Vale\" (currently No. 36). Other series in other genres are certain to follow.\nA new golden age is here. Or, rather, \"hear.\"\nRe: Tweets\nReaders selected as the funniest tweet of the week this offering from @brandonIee : \"If I got a dollar for every time I thought about you, I would start thinking about you.\"\nMy favorite of the 15 finalists, posted by @shariv67 , finished fourth: \" After a few days without my phone, I've learned what's really important in life.
