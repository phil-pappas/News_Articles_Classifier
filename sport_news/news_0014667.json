The artistes played various characters, namely demon King Ravana, Sugreev, Baali and the most adorable Hanuman. The scenes of communal brotherhood were also witnessed when Tasdik Khan, a Muslim, donated around two quintals of apple for the artistes. The tourists from the USA and the UK appreciated the gesture and said such brotherhood could only be witnessed in India where a Muslim also registers his contribution in the Ramlila in one way or the other. Farmers from the apple belt of Harsil in Uttarkashi also gave several quintals of apple to the Ramlila Committee. Jaipal Yadav, DIG, ITBP, Mahidanda Unit, who was the chief guest on the occasion, commended the efforts of the committee in organising the Ramlila in the town. Local artistes also performed traditional musical ballad Rami Baurani on the occasion. Ilam Singh, a government employee, who is playing the role of Ravana for the past 20 years, says the Ramlila is the place where raw theatrical talent is honed over the years. “I started performing in the Ramlila at the age of 14 and have been associated with it since then. The Ramlila has disappeared from big urban areas, which is unfortunate,” he adds. Though IIam Singh is delighted at the renewed interest in the Ramlila in the Garhwal region, he says more efforts are needed to support local artistes who perform without any financial assistance from the government.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T02:02:46.808+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
