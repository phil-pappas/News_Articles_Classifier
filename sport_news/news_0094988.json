I am very happy for him.” \nStill, Mortimer wondered what might have been. \n“If we had Thurston up to now we would have played up to four more grand finals,” he said. \n“He would definitely had meant more premierships for the Bulldogs. \n“I saw from day one he was a great player but more importantly a great person.” \nSince their 2004 premiership triumph, the Bulldogs have appeared in two losing grand finals – in 2012 and last year’s defeat at the hands of South Sydney. \nMortimer – who won a total of four titles with his beloved Bulldogs – likened Thurston to his heyday in the 1980s. \n“Like Johnathan I used to play with a bit of passion, it was using the heart before the brain,” Mortimer laughed. \n“And sometimes the passion got the better of me. \nMortimer wasn’t so confident that Thurston could deliver the Cowboys to their maiden premiership though. \n“My heart says the Cowboys for Sunday but my head says the Broncos.”  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T11:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T12:36:33.663+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
