Here are a few thoughts, observations and takeaways from the afternoon. (OK, well, more than a few.)\n-- Memphis coach Justin Fuente downplayed this game all week and kind of walked a tightrope after the game. He said he certainly understands how big this win is for this program. “I don’t want to diminish that in my remarks,” he said. “It’s just, that cannot be our focus. We’re in the middle of the season.” For that reason, Fuente couldn't call this what it was -- a historic, monumental, program-altering victory. In a few hours from this writing, the Tigers will be ranked in both polls. They are now the unquestioned favorites to win the American Athletic Conference, and probably the favorites to get that Access Bowl spot among Group of Five teams. (A spot which I’ve previously said “should not be on the radar for Tigers fans this year.” Clearly, the Tigers proved me wrong on that.) But really, the impact of this win goes well beyond this season. It will have ripple effects in attendance and interest across town. It will influence the national perception of the program, from casual college football fans to AP voters and pundits. And perhaps most importantly of all, it will have big-time ripple effects in recruiting. I don’t have a specific count, but there were at least a couple hundred recruits on the sidelines before the game. Several players who have orally committed to Memphis -- from Keon Howard to Noah Barnes -- tweeted that they were at the game. And hundreds, if not thousands, of other high-school football players watched this game on TV. Imagine seeing all of that as a recruit: The crowd, the game, the fans storming the field. That’s a potential difference-maker in recruiting, in my opinion.\n-- This game changes everything for quarterback Paxton Lynch. It was his most difficult test of the season, and he passed with flying colors. If you’re an NFL talent evaluator, there’s not much you can criticize at this point. He has the natural tools: size, arm strength, mobility. He takes care of the ball. He’s coachable. He has the statistics. And now, he’s proven that he can be as successful against a respected SEC defense as he has been against the AAC. (Remember: He also looked pretty good against UCLA last year.) So all this draft talk that’s been bubbling in recent weeks? Expect it to grow. Exponentially. How Lynch handles it all -- as I wrote in Saturday’s paper -- will only be that much more important now.\n-- I think my favorite play from Lynch was an incomplete pass in the fourth quarter. Here's the situation: There’s a little more than 10 minutes left. Memphis leads, 31-24. It’s 3rd-and-4 on the 18. Lynch takes the snap and sees a free blitzer coming off his left side, essentially blowing up the play. This is a situation where a lot of quarterbacks will try to make something happen in a big game -- panic, heave the ball up and hope for the best. Instead, Lynch slides right to avoid the sack, takes the hit and throws it away. Jake Elliott kicks the chip-shot field goal to make it a two-possession game. It seems like a pretty simple thing, right? It’s not. At all. You see dumb decisions made in those situations every Sunday across the NFL, and even moreso in college. That’s the type of cautious split-second decision-making that every team wants from its quarterback.\n-- Alright, let’s talk about the defense. A lot of folks have been critical of this unit. I’ve been critical of this unit. But Saturday, they probably won that game for Memphis. It started up front. At least when I watched the game live, I thought it was the best overall performance we’ve seen from the front seven this year. That front completely shut down Ole Miss’ rushing game and, honestly, has been pretty good against the run all year. Memphis deserves more credit for that. Then, after the first two drives, Chad Kelly was repeatedly under duress. This alleviated pressure on the secondary, which looked plenty good in its own right. Yes, the Rebels finished with 440 passing yards. Kelly completed 70 percent of his passes. There’s still a lot of room for improvement. But that’s what Fuente has preached since the preseason: Improvement. Does the defense improve every week? In the past two weeks, the answer has been yes. Tulsa -- which, runs a Baylor-style offense like Bowling Green -- could pose some problems, but kudos to the defense, and defensive coordinator Galen Scott and his staff, for that performance yesterday.\n-- While we’re doling out kudos: How about Memphis’ offensive line? I haven’t talked about that group enough. When Lynch looks good, it’s usually, in part, because the offensive line is doing a tremendous job giving him time and space in the pocket. I know the counterargument about yesterday will be, “but Robert Nkemdiche was hurt, and it would’ve been a different story if he was in there.” Sure. I get that. But it’s not like the rest of Ole Miss’ defensive line was a bunch of scrubs. This was a really good unit that Memphis largely kept quiet. One of the keys, in my mind, was having 6-foot-7, 330-pound backup tackle Chris Roberson at left guard. It really helped to have a big body like that in the middle, and Roberson did a good job.\n-- One thing that continues to stand out about this Memphis team is that it wins big downs, on both sides of the ball. I crunched the numbers last week. Entering this weekend, the Tigers were one of only five Football Bowl Subdivision teams that ranked in the top 50 in these four categories: third-down conversion percentage, fourth-down conversion percentage, third-down defense and fourth-down defense. (The others were Clemson, Iowa, Vanderbilt and West Virginia.) I’m not sure how that stat will change this week, but I think Saturday was a good example of what I’m getting at. Memphis was 12 of 20 on third downs. Ole Miss was 4 of 13. The Rebels were also 0 of 2 on fourth downs. Memphis has converted 5 of 6 fourth downs this year. Those are all plays that decide games. I’m not sure why Memphis is so good in those spots, but it’s important to note. And it makes a big difference.\n-- Ole Miss went for it twice on fourth-and-1. I’m not a coach, nor an expert in situational football like most coaches, but neither seemed to be a good decision by Hugh Freeze. Before the second fourth-down attempt, I literally said aloud in the press box, to nobody in particular: “This is so dumb.” I still believe that. And I believe those two decisions helped swing the momentum of the game in Memphis’ favor.\n-- I wrote a feature story about Anthony Miller earlier this week. He caught 10 passes for 132 yards and a touchdown yesterday. That’s some good planning, huh? I do what I can. Do read that story if you haven’t, though, because it partially explains why Miller was so emotional after yesterday’s game. He didn’t have a single FBS offer out of high school, so he walked on at his hometown college. Then he waited two years to see the field. Now, he’s doing this. I texted his high-school coach, Kevin Locastro, during yesterday’s game. “Anthony played his tail off,” he replied. “He could start at a lot of schools!” I agree. And I bet a lot of schools are kicking themselves for not giving him more of a look.\n-- A brief shoutout to Jarvis Cooper, who finished with 17 carries for 76 yards. He accounted for 46 of the team’s 70 yards on its first scoring drive, the one that really put Memphis back in the game. His effort on that drive was a footnote in the larger story of the game, but it’s a really important footnote when you go back and look at it.\n-- Another brief shoutout to the Liberty Bowl and Memphis athletics department for the entire gameday operation yesterday. I haven’t heard any complaints about traffic yet (probably because everyone was too busy celebrating) but it seems like things went at least relatively smoothly. Someone emailed me earlier this week about handling a crowd of roughly 60,000. “Tennessee does that all the time!” he wrote. Yeah, well Memphis doesn’t. It’s relatively uncharted territory. And it was handled well, from what I can tell so far. (Also, we got both Gibson’s Donuts AND Rendezvous in the press box yesterday, so that was awesome.)\n-- Ole Miss was a challenge, but this week will be a big one, too. “All of y’all are going to shake your heads at me,” Fuente said in his opening remarks at his postgame presser, “but in six days, we’ve got to go on the road and play a conference game against Tulsa.” He’s right. And really, the stretch that will define this season has yet to come: Navy, at Houston and at Temple. Memphis could theoretically lose two of those three games and not even make the AAC championship game. The team will need to put this game in the rearview mirror, fast. It’ll need to move past Ole Miss, past the scene of fans storming the field, and recalibrate for the second half of the season.\n-- Lastly, speaking of field-storming … after the game, you may have seen a guy in a blue sweater vest running around the concourse, rudely bumping into people and swearing under his breath. If you saw that guy, hello! That was me. And I’d like to apologize for being so rude. I stayed in the press box until the very end of the game to put the finishing touches on my early story, then found it nearly impossible to get to the field level, where the postgame press conferences are held. So I jogged around the concourse like a crazy person, eventually hopping a wall (like most of the student section) and zig-zagging across the field to the press conference room. I still missed a chunk of Fuente’s press conference. But, again, sorry about the rudeness. It was a crazy afternoon.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T18:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T10:21:40.626+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
