Those numbers of however just bookkeeping as the Bears have absolutely rolled through their opponents in a 6-0 start. The final margin of 24 points represented Baylor's closest game to date this season. West Virginia trailed by ten at half and they had a chance to narrow that margin even further late in the second quarter. In their final two possessions of the first half, WVU drove to the Baylor two and then to the nine. Those possessions however resulted in a total of just three points. The search for playmakers in the receiving core took an intriguing turn as the redshirt was burned for backup quarterback David Sills. Early returns were promising, a pair of long receptions, one for a third quarter touchdown. After turning the ball over a total of nine times against Oklahoma and Oklahoma State, one interception accounted for the only Mountaineer giveaway against the Bears. After a difficult day against Oklahoma State last Saturday, Skyler Howard tossed four touchdown passes. It was a performance Dana Holgorsen praised for perseverance under pressure, both in the pocket and off the field.
