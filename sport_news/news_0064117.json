I just put it in the hands of our best player.” Jeffers took the two-point conversion to the right again, walking in untouched and giving the visiting Buccaneers the decisive score in their 16-15 victory Friday night in Mid-State 2-A Conference football. “Coach asked if we wanted to win or if we wanted to tie, and everybody said they wanted to win,” Jeffers said. “They wasn’t ready for it, and they had to capitalize.” For Cummings coach Jauron Holman, he knew the entire time that Bartlett Yancey would go for two if it scored. “I was telling somebody (on our sideline), ‘I got a bad feeling about this,’ and you hate to be like that,” Holman said. “But as a coach, you get some stuff inside, like instinct, and I knew they were going to go for two the whole time.” Weathersby and Jeffers both said the Buccaneers ran the exact same play on the touchdown and the two-point conversion, which doesn’t count in Jeffers’ stat line of 18 carries for 125 yards. “I’m a simple man,” Weathersby said. “The players and coaches said they were confident in the play, and we ran with it.” Jeffers said: “If it’s not broke, don’t try to fix it. I saw they were playing close, so I knew if I got to the outside, I was in there. Once I got in the end zone, it didn’t feel real.” Bartlett Yancey (5-3 overall, 2-1 Mid-State 2-A Conference) is amid its best season in two decades. Cummings (2-7, 1-2) drove back and sent freshman kicker Carlos Bertane out for a 55-yard field goal in an attempt to win on the game’s final play. His kick cleared the end zone but didn’t have the height needed. “I couldn’t look at it,” Jeffers said. “I couldn’t look, so I had my man (Micheas Mitchell) tell me it didn’t go in and I saw everybody cheering. I figured it was time for me to cheer too.” Weathersby agreed about the tension. “There were nerves, because I thought he hit it (in),” he said. “I’d be nervous to try a 50-yard field goal, but he almost got it.” Page 2 of 2 - Even though Beltrane didn’t connect on the potential game-winning field goal, Holman said he has complete faith in his talented young kicker. “In practice, he hit a 55-yarder, so why not?” Holman said. “Give the kid the chance as a freshman, because he may not make it this year, but he may make the next one in the state championship in his senior year. He needed the opportunity to grow, and that’s what we gave him.” After a scoreless first quarter, Cummings opened the second with a 12-play, 93-yard drive that took 6 minutes, 6 seconds. Ryan Boswell ran in a 1-yard touchdown, but Beltrane’s extra-point attempt was blocked by a bull rush from the Buccaneers. Bartlett Yancey responded immediately, as Donielle Totten hit Rasheed over the middle. He avoided two defenders and cruised into the end zone for a touchdown. Totten found Tre Dildy for a two-point conversion, giving the Buccaneers an 8-6 lead at halftime. Cummings took the lead back late in the third, capitalizing on great field position to drive 26 yards on four plays. Isaiah McPherson ran in a 5-yard run, but the Cavaliers couldn’t convert the two-point conversion. Beltrane added a 39-yard field goal midway through the fourth to push the Cummings lead to seven.
