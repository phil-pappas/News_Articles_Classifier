P. - 'MEMBERS ONLY' CLUB With the clouds above set on 'car wash rinse' all night, the three-time reigning state champion L.C. Bird Skyhawks battled both the elements and the Class 4A state semifinalist Monacan Chiefs on Thursday night in a rather sloppy game that eleven fumbles and five interceptions leading to eleven combined turnovers on the night. Elliott to Townsend 24 yards, PAT blocked 9-0 Elliott to Hines 5 yards, two-point failed 15-0 Jones 39 yards fumble recovery, PAT misses 15-6 Wright 3 yards, PAT Riley 22-6 Wright offensive fumble recovery in end zone, two-point Wright run 30-6 Oledejo fumble recovery in end zone, two-point failed 36-6 KEYS TO VICTORY SHUTDOWN DEFENSE Through the first quarter, it didn't look like either team would get much traction on offense as Monacan punted twice and turned the ball over three times (two fumbles and one interception) on their first five possessions while Bird was matching their futility as they opened the game with two punts and an interception on their first three drives. The Skyhawks broke through just before the end of the quarter when Keaton Riley squeaked a 33-yard field goal over the crossbar to open the scoring in the contest. The field goal capped a strange drive that actually saw Bird go backwards as they had taken over possession on the Monacan 10-yard line on a Damontre Blowe (pictured) fumble recovery. Three plays and a penalty later, Coach David Bedwell called for the Riley attempt. The domination of the Bird defense would continue all game as Monacan totaled 16 offensive possessions on the night and each ended in disappointment as they punted seven times, lost four fumbles, threw two interceptions, turned the ball over on downs once and saw both the halftime break and the end of the game killed their other two drives. In total, the Chiefs managed -12 yards of offense on the night rushing for -28 while throwing for 16 with six turnovers and seven punts. SHORT FIELDS The turnover leading to the field goal at the end of the first quarter set up a recurring pattern that played itself out all night as the Skyhawks defense would continually set up their offense with short fields keeping the unit from having to drive the length of the field. The second quarter was filled with more sloppy football as Monacan threw another interception, lost another fumble and punted twice while Bird opened the quarter throwing a pick and punted on their next possession. However, the offense pieced together two scoring drives capped by Jalen Elliott (pictured) passes, the first to Kier Townsend from 24 yards out and the second to Kumonde Hines from the Monacan five-yard line as the 'Hawks carried a 15-0 lead into the break. Of the Skyhawks five scoring drives on the night, only one started in their own territory and even the one that did start on Bird's side of the field began at their own 40-yard line. The two second quarter scoring drives totaled only 78 yards as one started at the Chiefs 47 and the other from their 31. GROUND GAME The second half opened with the teams trading punts before Bird moved from their own 8-yard line to midfield before disaster struck as a Skyhawks fumble was scooped up by lineman T.J. Jones who dashed 39 yards for a Chiefs touchdown putting them back into the game at 15-6. Bird responded with a scoring drive of their own as their run game really started to get cranked up behind tailback J.B. Wright who saw the bulk of the workload in quarters three and four. A 60-yard drive was capped when Wright scored from three yards out on the first play of the fourth quarter to extend the lead to 22-6. From there, Bird put the game away with another short scoring drive (four plays, 29 yards) and tacked on a defensive score for good measure to provide the final margin. After totaling only 35 yards on 19 carries in the first half, the Skyhawks put up 187 yards on the ground in the second half on 31 attempts as Wright began finding more and more room in the C gaps.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T20:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T04:04:39.412+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
