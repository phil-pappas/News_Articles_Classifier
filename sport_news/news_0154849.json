It was the moment Giants wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr. let his emotions get the best of him in Sunday's 24-10 victory over the Buffalo Bills, but wasn't really mentioned until two days later.\nBeckham took a swipe at safety Duke Williams after he was laid out (legally) on an interception return. It will likely cost him $8,681. He plans to appeal the fine.\nThat moment wasn't completely isolated. It was building from the opening series, when Beckham and Bills cornerback Stephon Gilmore had their hands in each others' faces on multiple occasions.\nNot that this is anything new.\n\"Yeah, I get punched every single game or 'punched' or whatever it is—I get hit in my face every single game,\" Beckham said. \"Like I said, it is what it is, but we're playing football and these are grown men out here. I don't think anybody should be talking about what happened after they lost the game.\"\nThe Bills did. They called out Beckham for his actions throughout the contest. They called him a \"prima donna\" and a \"cheap shot\" artist. They called him \"weird\" and the NFL's \"golden boy.\" And they also said the hype was based \"off that one catch.\"\nThat final one is the real head-scratcher. Beckham's numbers in the first 16 games of his career are off the charts. Calling him a one-catch wonder should immediately taint any of their claims.\nStill, I scoured the coaches film to see if there was any validity to what they were saying. Here's what I found:\nBeckham and the Bills' starting cornerbacks (Gilmore and Ronald Darby) battled all afternoon. Buffalo coach Rex Ryan clearly had a game plan that involved being physical with Beckham. It's not all that different from what most teams employ.\nOn more than one occasion, it resulted in borderline illegal contact, both past the 5-yard limit and in the vicinity of Beckham's head/neck.\nIt began when Beckham and Gilmore matched up for most of the first drive. It extended throughout most of the first quarter.\nThis was late in the first quarter. Gilmore clobbers Beckham 7 yards downfield and rather high.\nNo penalty was called on the play. The camera cut away on the live broadcast and the coaches film just as they appeared to get in each others' face.\nAs Beckham likes to say, \"It's football.\" This isn't anything abnormal. Just another day on the field for the explosive wide receiver.\nRELATED : Beckham's silly numbers after 16 NFL games\nAgain a few minutes later, this time in the second quarter, Beckham (out wide right) is hit high by rookie cornerback Ronald Darby. His head jerks back before he continues to run his route.\nAt the end of the play, Beckham appeared to turn to the official to express his disgust. This happened Sunday on multiple occasions, which is rare for Beckham. He's usually rather quiet on the field.\nBut Beckham and quarterback Eli Manning weren't always on the same page. There appeared to be some disgust at their ability to connect. Maybe that contributed to the amount he complained. Maybe not.\nStill, Beckham was giving maximum effort, trying to contribute in other ways, as seen on this play. Here he sprints downfield to make a block for wide receiver Rueben Randle. The final result is a crushing hit on Bills safety Bacarri Rambo in the first quarter.\nThis didn't appear to go over well with the Bills, even though the block and tackle occur pretty much simultaneously. It seems to have contributed to their late-game frustration as things began to crumble around them.\nThe Giants didn't seem to think there was anything wrong with it.\n\"[Beckham is] an emotional guy,\" coach Tom Coughlin said. \"Hey, let's face it, I told him, 'I want you to continue to block the way you're blocking.' He flies around out there.\"\nWith 6:22 remaining, that is when it officially began to fall apart. The Bills picked up an unnecessary roughness and unsportsmanlike conduct penalty on back-to-back plays. According to offensive lineman Justin Pugh, they didn't care because they conceded the game was over.\nLater that drive, on a play that was blown dead, pushing ensued after the whistle. Giants left tackle Ereck Flowers was tossed to the ground and Beckham came to his teammate's aid. There was some run of the mill pushing and shoving.\nWhen things seemed to have settled, Bills linebacker Preston Brown put his hands in Beckham's chest. The wide receiver angrily slapped it away.\nThat's when Brown blows a gasket. He's assessed a 15-yard penalty.\nAt this point there still isn't much out of the ordinary. It was your normal run-of-the-mill late-game scrum. Everything seemed to settle.\nThree plays later, an agitated Beckham throws a slappy football punch at Williams.\nThis was crossing the line, but nothing that is uniquely dirty. This kind of post-play stuff happens pretty regularly. It has happened to Oakland's Charles Woodson, Houston's Andre Johnson, Washington's Trent Williams, and Seattle's Ricardo Lockett, just to name a few, over the past few years.\nIt even happened on the Bills sideline Sunday with Giants defensive tackle Cullen Jenkins the victim. Jenkins took a shot from a Bills player or coach in street clothes on the sideline.\nFlag ? @BigBlueUnited @Giants @Giants_101 @BigBlueUnited @bigblueview @CullenJenkins @buffalobills @billsbuzztap pic.twitter.com/kRtUUl6LFh\n— DoubleDs (@dunnright_56) October 4, 2015\nIllegal, no doubt. Worthy of fines, of course. Deserving of whines, complaints and a blasting of Beckham as a person and player by the Bills after the contest, not really.\nAs Jenkins explained, seemed like sour grapes. There was nothing there besides that one play that showed Beckham to be a perpetually dirty player who delivers \"cheap shots.\" Mostly it was just hard-nosed, competitive football.", "external_links": ["https://vine.co/v/e20aIuxgjV1/embed/simple", "http://t.co/kRtUUl6LFh", "https://twitter.com/billsbuzztap", "https://twitter.com/dunnright_56/status/650765638017941506", "https://twitter.com/bigblueview", "https://vine.co/v/e20BMOHQBj7/embed/simple", "https://platform.vine.co/static/scripts/embed.js", "https://vine.co/v/e22g0wIEudO/embed/simple", "https://twitter.com/Giants_101", "https://vine.co/v/e22vWW6YYI1/embed/simple", "https://twitter.com/buffalobills", "https://vine.co/v/e22eB5MJuF3/embed/simple", "https://twitter.com/BigBlueUnited", "https://twitter.com/Giants", "https://twitter.com/CullenJenkins", "https://vine.co/v/e22lU9HepKn/embed/simple"], "published": "2015-10-08T16:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T18:33:32.030+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
