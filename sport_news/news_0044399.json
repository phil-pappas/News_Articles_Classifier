He may not be the fastest guy on the field, but he’s got the strength to get into the end zone on a third-and-1 situation. \n“I just go where the line opens the hole for me,” Mullins said with a shrug. “I just do what the line allows me to do. I just run.” \nIf we were talking NFL — which has stated the perfect back would be at least 5 feet 10, 215 to 225 pounds and has more power than speed — Mullins would be an ideal fullback for any number of teams. \nBut we’re talking high school, and it’s those same attributes that have made him such a threat to opposing teams’ defenses. \nIn the Bison’s game against Stuarts Draft last Friday, he picked up all three of the team’s touchdowns, with each run into the end zone longer than the last. And in the muddy, wet conditions that have been present for the last month, Mullins power has been critical on fourth down conversions for the team. \nEven against a strong Riverheads team, Mullins couldn’t be contained — he managed two touchdowns against a team that’s still undefeated. \nAside from Mullins achievements on the field, this season has been one for him and the rest of the Bison to remember. \nThe team planned to go far, and fans knew it coming into the season, but with a 5-1 record at this point, the Bison have gotten to a point where they look like true contenders for a state title, something that wasn’t even imaginable three years ago. \n“We have a bunch of guys that came back from last year — a bunch of seniors with a lot of experience,” Mullins said. “I think we’re doing well because of all of the senior leadership.” 213 CONNECT 4 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://www.newsleader.com/story/sports/2015/10/14/mullins-quiet-force-gaps-season-football/73925984/ TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T03:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T20:17:06.819+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
