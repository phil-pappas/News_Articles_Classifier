But when it found itself trailing in its biggest match of the season on Saturday, it knew how to rally. Trailing undefeated South Kingstown, 3-2, in the title match of the Division II state tournament at Slater Park, the Crusaders posted victories in the two matches still on the court and captured their first title since 2003 with a 4-3 victory over the Rebels. “They haven’t had to come back too often this season. They have been a pretty dominate team,” coach Steve Matzner said about his Crusaders, who posted a 12-1 regular-season record. “But when they had to, when they had tough competition, they managed to rise above it and win the matches.” The Crusaders' only loss of the season was a 4-3 setback to South Kingstown in a divisional crossover match in the first week of the regular season. South Kingstown went on to a 13-0 record and the Division II-Suburban B regular-season record. But on Saturday, Prout received a big lift from senior Jacqueline Joyal, who won her second singles match after having lost at the same spot in her September match against South Kingstown. Joyal’s victory coupled with a straight-sets triumph by Alexandra Pratt at first singles gave the Crusaders a 2-0 lead. South Kingstown, came back, however, to win three straight matches with Kat Jarbeau posting a straight-sets triumph at third singles and the Rebels' second and third doubles combinations of Kendall Harrison-Nicole Gennari and Margaret Vorhaben-Zoe Pagliaro, respectively, posting victories. That left only the fourth singles and first doubles matches on the court, and both had gone to third sets. The Crusaders' duo of Jenson Tavares-Angela Figueroa fell behind in the early going of the final set, but eventually came back for a 6-4 triumph that tied the team score at 3-3. “They completed an undefeated season and they had to come back to do it,” said Matzner. That left the Crusaders title hopes in the hands of freshman Elizabeth Duffy at fourth singles. Duffy had won the first set of her match against Jacqueline Burns, 6-1, but then dropped a 6-0 decision in the second set. But after taking an early 4-1 lead, Duffy needed to hold off a strong Burns comeback effort en route to a 6-4 third-set triumph. “She has learned to compete this year,” Matzner said of Duffy. “I needed to get a lot of guts, this year,\" said Duffy. \"I never really had done a lot of competition.” Page 2 of 2 - “I started getting really nervous,\" Duffy said of Burns' efforts in the third set. “But I told myself, I had it in me. And I had to do it.” jgillool@providencejournal.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T04:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T04:57:39.380+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
