He had a really good game.” \nErney completed 14 of 27 passes on the night, including 12 of 19 in the first half for 213 yards. Darian Street (lehighvalleylive.com file photo) \nJunior wide receiver Darian Street was shut out in last week’s win over Whitehall but came through in a big way Thursday, catching five passes for 44 yards and two touchdowns. \n“Doug Erney had a hell of a game,” Truby said. “Darian Street had a hell of a game.” \nThe duo first connected on a four-yard touchdown pass in the first quarter to give Liberty the 14-10 lead. Erney led Street into the corner of the end zone and Street made a highlight-reel reception to secure the ball and get a foot inbound for the touchdown. \n“That was definitely a great catch,” Erney said. “I threw it a little too far and I kind of got scared, but I knew he’s athletic enough to make a wonderful catch like that.” \nThey hooked up for the Hurricanes’ next touchdown in the second quarter, when Erney threw into a crowd of Emmaus defenders but put the ball right on the money and Street hauled it in for the 14-yard score. \n“Great catch and great blocking by the linemen,” Erney said. “(Street) wasn’t in the mix the first four games, so I’m glad we got another asset to the wide receiver core.” \nStreet had caught eight passes for 89 yards and a touchdown through the first four games but was a much bigger factor Thursday night. \nHe wasn’t Erney’s only option, though, as the quarterback also found Victor Santiago and Elijah Williams on touchdown passes. \nErney’s receivers helped him out on those scores, too. Santiago caught the ball 10 yards deep on a slant and took off, beating the rest of the defense with his speed for the 66-yard touchdown. \nWilliams didn’t appear to be headed to the end zone on his before he cut his way through the Emmaus secondary on a series of jukes to get in for the 41-yard score. \n“I’m glad my receivers pulled through for me today even though it was raining and stuff,” Erney said. \n“We knew we were gonna have a hard time with some of their guys in space,” Green Hornets coach Randy Cuthbert said. “We’re not the fastest team and that’s gonna give us some challenges.” \nErney also created a few plays with his feet, finishing with 11 carries for 52 yards. \n“Their quarterback is tough to defend,” Cuthbert said. “He’s really good. I think he’s a great player.” \nLiberty went with a heavy dosage of the ground game in the second half to help chew up the clock. Gunner Anglovich took 12 carries for 73 yards and a touchdown while Nasir Legree added 12 rushes for 79 yards. \nThe win propelled the Hurricanes to a 4-1 mark, their best start through five games since the 2008 state championship team. \n“It definitely feels good,” Erney said. “First time going 4-1 in my career. I’m glad my guys have the same mindset as me that we want to win every game. Not looking ahead in the future, going week-by-week and that’s what we’ve been doing so far and it’s been working out.” \nThey adjusted on the fly this week when they found out Wednesday they’d be playing a day early due to weather concerns, and now they’ll have an extra day to prepare for their toughest foe yet. \n“It feels great to be 4-1 in a very tough conference,” Truby said. “We have a heck of a challenge coming into our house next week with Parkland. We’re going to get ourselves ready, rest up and get after them next week.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T06:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T01:52:39.576+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
