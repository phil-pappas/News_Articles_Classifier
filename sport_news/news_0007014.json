Matz long tossed Friday and felt fine, and that secured his spot on the roster. The rookie threw a simulated game Thursday consisting of approximately 90 pitches.\n“Get to Game 4 and what it means, and where we’re at, and decide then,” manager Terry Collins said before Friday’s Game 1 against the Dodgers.\nCollins’ options for Game 4 are Matz, Jacob deGrom on short rest, or Bartolo Colon. All signs point to it being Matz or deGrom.\nAGENT DEFENDS HARVEY: Matt Harvey’s agent, Scott Boras, did not comment Friday about Harvey throwing more than 180 innings this year, but defended Harvey’s work ethic.\n“I think the perception of every player is that Matt’s got a great work ethic, everybody knows that,” Boras said. “Matt Harvey gave his arm already for the New York Mets, and that is when in 2013 he went out and pitched until he didn’t have a ligament. He’s the kind of guy, he wants his team to do well, he wants them to win, and you’ve see what he’s done.”\nBoras and Harvey said earlier this year that Harvey’s surgeon, Dr. James Andrews, said Harvey should not exceed 180 innings this season in his return from Tommy John surgery. Harvey pitched a career-high 189¤ innings this season.\nBoras said he talked with Mets general manager Sandy Alderson in September, and doctors were also on the call. He expects there to be conversations after the season.\nHarvey caused a stir by arriving late to Tuesday’s mandatory workout.\nROAD START: Noah Syndergaard starts tonight against Zack Greinke, and the rookie tossed one of the best starts of his career at Dodger Stadium on July 3. Syndergaard threw six innings of one-run ball in a matchup against Clayton Kershaw, and received a no-decision.\n“The atmosphere here was electric,” Syndergaard said.\nSyndergaard struggled on the road to start his career, and is just 2-5 in 12 such starts with a 4.23 ERA, but finished the season 2-0 with a 2.29 ERA in his last three road starts.\nCollins said the team has no concerns about Syndergaard in a road start.\nBRIEFS: Michael Conforto will start tonight vs. Greinke. Michael Cuddyer played Friday against Kershaw, a southpaw … Collins said his starter at shortstop each game could be a day-by-day decision. Ruben Tejada started Friday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T17:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T06:10:00.412+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
