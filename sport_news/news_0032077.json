(AP) - A coroner says a 20-year-old college football player has been killed in a one-car crash in Mississippi. Altee Tenpenny was pronounced dead at 6:57 p.m. Tuesday at Delta Regional Medical Center in Greenville. Washington County Coroner Methel Johnson says Tenpenny was taken to the hospital after he wrecked a 2008 Dodge Charger near the community of Glen Allan. Johnson says a Mississippi Highway Patrol officer who responded to the crash told her Tenpenny was traveling alone when the vehicle hit road signs and flipped. She says he was thrown from the car, but she did not know whether he was wearing a seatbelt. Tenpenny is from North Little Rock, Arkansas. He was a backup running back at Alabama in 2013 and 2014 before transferring to UNLV and then Nicholls State. (Copyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
