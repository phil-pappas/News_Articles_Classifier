The only time Sindhu had beaten the World No. 2 Spaniard was in 2011 Maldives International Challenge. \n\nBlowing hot and cold this season, Sindhu came into the quarter-finals with a 1-4 record against Yihan. The only time she had beaten the Chinese was at the World Championships in 2013 but the Indian produced a superb game to completely leave Yihan clueless. \n\nSindhu came up with a neat game where she held a 3-0 lead early on and didn't allow Yihan to come anywhere near her vicinity in the first game. \n\nThe script didn't change much in the second game as Sindhu once again moved to a massive 7-1 lead and zoomed to 19-15. Yihan reeled off four straight points to conjure up hopes of a turnaround but the Indian shut the door on her with two more points.
