Haines was ruled to have made helmet-to-helmet contact with California tight end Stephen Anderson at the end of a 22-yard catch and was ejected. Kevin Vaccaro replaced Haines.\nTexas caught a break when no one fielded a Cal kickoff in the first quarter, and the Golden Bears recovered deep in Longhorn territory. Cal was ruled offsides and had to kick again.\nQuarterback Jerrod Heard was penalized for an illegal forward pass, negating a 33-yard gain in the second quarter. Heard had already fully crossed the line of scrimmage â” the point of no return â” at the Texas 5 before he saw tight end Caleb Bluett open in the flat.\nCal came up empty on a second-quarter drive because of an illegal substitution penalty. The Bears were preparing to go for it on fourth-and-1 at the Texas 21 when they were flagged for 12 men in the huddle. Kicker Matt Anderson was then wide left on a 44-yard field goal attempt.\nHeard made his first major mistake late in the first half, failing to account for Cal linebacker Jalen Jefferson dropping in coverage. The interception set up a 34-yard field goal by Anderson with four seconds remaining in the second quarter to lift Cal into a 24-24 tie.\nCal played without leading rusher Daniel Lasco, sidelined with a strained hip muscle. He had 137 yards on the ground and two touchdowns in the first two games.\nInterim athletic director Mike Perrin, a three-year letterman under Darrell Royal in 1966-68, was an honorary captain.\nSherrington: 45-44 loss to Cal shows UT has lots to fix, but Strong has found a QB\nCarlton: Heard puts on a show, but ...
