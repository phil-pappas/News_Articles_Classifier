(AP) â€” A United Airlines flight carrying nearly 200 people from Houston to San Francisco had to divert to Albuquerque, New Mexico, after the co-pilot passed out Tuesday.\nAir-traffic controllers got word shortly after 8 a.m. that the plane would be landing after the first officer, who is second in command, had a medical episode, Albuquerque airport spokesman Dan Jiron said. The plane landed without incident around 8:20 a.m.\nThe co-pilot regained consciousness and was able to walk off the plane to be transported to a local hospital, Jiron said. He had no details about the co-pilot's condition or what may have caused the episode.\nAn airline spokeswoman said 177 passengers and 10 crew members were aboard the plane. United did not release any details about the co-pilot.\nThe diversion comes a day after an American Airlines captain became gravely ill while flying from Phoenix to Boston. He later died.\nAdvertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T20:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-07T00:03:21.949+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
