Is there a passing game in LSU's immediate future?: There certainly needs to be, because six of LSU's final seven games are SEC battles, including against the league's top two rushing defenses next Saturday vs. Florida and Nov. 7 at Alabama. As Leonard Fournette's rushing legend grows, so will the defensive attention. You can certainly expect South Carolina on Saturday will put eight or nine defenders in the box and dare LSU quarterback Brandon Harris to throw. Throwing is not the Tigers' problem, but catching is the biggest bug-a-boo. LSU's best receivers have dropped too many balls the last two games.\n2. Can the Tigers play a full game of lights-out defense?: On the surface, it seems the focus and intensity of LSU's defense burns hot for the first 1Â½ quarters and then flips off and on the rest of the game. The fact the Tigers have outscored opponents in the first (49-0) and third (48-32) quarters while getting outscored in the second (20-16) and fourth (34-31) quarters seems to support the flickering focus theory. But much of the reason is there's a noticeable gap when the defensive reserves see action, allowing opponents to gain too much confidence and momentum.\n3. Will Fournette finally break the LSU individual game rushing record of 250 yards?: South Carolina ranks 12 th in total defense in the SEC allowing 388.8 yards per game. Georgia's Nick Chubb ran for 159 yards and two TDs in the Bulldogs' 52-20 victory over the Gamecocks, but had just four runs longer than 10 yards. The longest run South Carolina has allowed this season is 44 yards. In his last three games, Fournette had at least one run of 62 yards or more. He'll need a couple of those to position himself to break Alley Broussard's record set in 2004 vs. Ole Miss.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T19:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T23:48:43.310+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
