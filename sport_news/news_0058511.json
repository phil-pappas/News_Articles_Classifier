There hasn’t been an NBA playoff game since May 2010. The Diamondbacks and Suns have combined for two winning records in the past 10 seasons combined.\nWhen it comes to a fast-growing downtown, the only thing lagging are the highest-profile tenants.\nThe Diamondbacks are getting closer. The Suns are getting better. Their respective plights are vastly different.\nAZCENTRAL\nDiamondbacks XTRA app: Get latest news, analysis, scores, photos\nThe Diamondbacks fight weather, apathy and the biggest problem of all: Millennials don’t like baseball all that much. According to ESPN, the median viewer age for the sport has risen from 46 to 53 in the past 10 years, while the NBA’s has held constant at 37. That means young people keep tuning into basketball, while baseball’s audience just gets older.\nThe problem is exacerbated at Chase Field, where energy and buzz are rarely in attendance. Maybe it’s a credit to all the diversions and food options throughout the concourse, but nobody seems to want to stay in their seat. The hospitality is five-star, but the ambiance is meh.\nFrom climate to stadium vibe, it’s a tough place to call home. Which is partly why the Diamondbacks won more games on the road (40) than they did at Chase Field (39) in 2015.\nBut everyone loves playoff baseball, right? The drama and suspense are off the charts. The one-game playoff is awful yet mesmerizing. Crowd shots dominate television coverage, with fans covering their faces in moments of high anxiety. Meanwhile, a player just boxed a Gatorade cooler, bobbing and weaving as if the beverage container had arms. Pure madness.\nMORE: Bickley columns\nThis postseason field features teams from New York, Los Angeles, Chicago and Toronto. At the moment, the Cubs and their 107-year drought is the best story in sports. There are interesting players everywhere, and three of the best aren’t even here (Mike Trout, Bryce Harper, Paul Goldschmidt).\nThere is a chance this postseason will be so good and so far-reaching that it might actually grip a millennial or two, tempting them to visit a baseball stadium next spring. The sport has to seize the moment, continuing to speed up the game, market its young stars and appeal to millennials through their handheld devices.\nProfessional basketball doesn’t have this problem. Their sport seems to have no problem connecting with youth through athleticism and fierce displays of individualism, whether it’s LeBron James and his hipster glasses or James Harden and his famous beard. For that and many other reasons, Suns owner Robert Sarver said he’s very bullish on the sport’s financial future.\nPhoenix Suns forward T.J. Warren makes a layup against the Sacramento Kings during preseason NBA action at Talking Stick Resort Arena in Phoenix on Oct. 7, 2015. (Photo: Michael Chow/azcentral sports)\nIn other words, he’s winning at business, even if he’s not winning on the court. Yet the current Suns have a chance for relevancy. Expectations are low. Eric Bledsoe looks and sounds different, which is to say his lips are actually moving. T.J. Warren might be a star in the making. And you can mark it down: newcomer Jon Leuer has already dunked on DeMarcus Cousins this preseason, and with some playing time, he’s guaranteed to be a fan favorite.\nThe Diamondbacks face a much tougher battle, and they desperately need to find their way back to the postseason. Playoff games at Chase Field always feel enormous. They have created a basket of eternal memories, from the 2001 World Series to winning a pair of elimination games against the Brewers in 2011.\nJust think of how different would it feel around here if the Diamondbacks were about to host those Cubs, just like they did in the 2007 National League postseason, which is also the last playoff series victory in franchise history.\nWhile it’s nothing compared the competitive drought in Chicago, it’s far too long in a climate like ours.\nReach Bickley at dan.bickley@arizonarepublic.com or 602-444-8253.
