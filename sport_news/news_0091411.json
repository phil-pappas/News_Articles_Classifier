Independent league aiming to bring professional baseball to capital city Proposed contract will go before Shawnee County Commission on Thursday Posted: October 13, 2015 - 7:31pm Photos FACEBOOK The Shawnee County Commission will consider entering into a contract with the independent Pecos League to allow Bettis Family Sports Complex to host a team to be known as the Topeka Train Robbers. Related Stories By Rick Peterson Jr. richard.peterson@cjonline.com \nA proposal to bring professional baseball to Topeka will be brought before the Shawnee County Commission on Thursday morning. \nThe commission will consider entering into a contract with the independent Pecos League to allow Bettis Family Sports Complex to host a team to be known as the Topeka Train Robbers. \nThe item will be on the agenda when commissioners Kevin Cook, Shelly Buhler and Bob Archer meet at 9 a.m. Thursday in the county courthouse. \nIf the contract is approved, the Pecos League would pay the county $365 per game and $1 per person from gate admissions. \nThe Train Robbers, previously located in Las Vegas, N.M., would play 35 to 38 home games from May to August 2016. \nThe Pecos League, which started in 2010, operates teams throughout New Mexico, western Kansas, Texas, Oklahoma and southern Colorado. \nPecos League commissioner Andrew Dunn described the league as “short-season rookie ball for players age 25 and under.” \nDunn said players typically play in the Pecos League for one or two years, with a goal of moving up to a higher level, such as the American Association, which features the Wichita Wingnuts and the Kansas City T-Bones, or affiliated minor league baseball. \n“It’s great baseball,” Dunn said of the league. “We have entertainment. We have a full professional package. We work with the ballparks we have, and we have a great time.” \nThe other teams in the league are the Alpine (Texas) Cowboys, Garden City Wind, Las Cruces (N.M.) Vaqueros, Roswell (N.M.) Invaders, Santa Fe (N.M.) Fuego, Trinidad (Colo.) Triggers, Woodward (Okla.) Westerners and the White Sands (N.M.) Pupfish. \n“We had a great year in the state of Kansas in Garden City,” Dunn said. “We think it’ll be great in Topeka, and we’re excited to be there. \n“Topeka, being a place that never really could get its own baseball identity, we feel it will be similar to Santa Fe, which has been great. Santa Fe is our best city and it’s the capital of New Mexico. Topeka’s the capital of Kansas, it’s on the Amtrak line and it has an AstroTurf facility.” \nTrain Robbers games would be played on Jerry Robertson Field at Bettis. \n“We’re willing to take that place as is,” Dunn said. “The seating isn’t great, but the surface is great, the locker room is great and the dugouts are great. Everything is great about it, except the seating. It’s marginal for us, but we’re going to make it work. If it’s a problem, we’ll figure it out.” \nThe regular season for the Pecos League would run May 19 through July 27, with 70 days of games, either home or away. \nDunn said he is expecting modest crowds for weekday games while targeting a larger attendance for weekend games. \n“We’re wanting average, on our weekend nights, around 550,” Dunn said. “On our weekdays, we’re just going to get what we can get. This is a type of deal where Monday, Tuesday, Wednesdays aren’t big. But your weekends — just like anything else — are your bigger nights.” \nRick Jr. Peterson can be reached at (785) 295-1290 or rick.peterson.jr@cjonline.com .Follow Rick Jr. on Twitter @RickiePeterson .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T03:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T23:25:08.897+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
