Photo: Tom Reel /San Antonio Express-News E-N Game of the Week: (1) Steele vs. (2) Judson 1 / 6 Back to Gallery Judson at Steele\nKickoff: 7:30 p.m. Friday, Lehnhoff Stadium\nRadio: KLUP-AM 930\nE-N Area rankings/records: 6A No. 2 Judson (7-0, 3-0 District 25-6) 6A; No. 1 Steele (8-0, 4-0 District 25-6A)\nCoaches: Sean McAuliffe (17-5 career, two seasons, all at Judson); Scott Lehnhoff (Scott Lehnhoff (33-4, three seasons, all at Steele)\nSeries: Steele leads 5-0.\nLast meeting: Steele won 23-22 in 2014.\nJudson breakdown\nSetting the scene: Judson came close to handing Steele a rare district loss in a game that ended up being a turning point for the Rockets. After a shaky start to the season, Judson reached the Class 6A Division I state semifinals. The Rockets are tied with Steele atop the 25-6A standings and ranked seventh in the Associated Press 6A state poll.\nKey to victory: Judson’s running game has been effective behind the trio of freshman Sincere McCormick, sophomore Jay Miller and junior Mi’kel Jackson. Those sets of legs are a big reason why Judson is averaging 6.8 yards per carry. The run game could play a factor on a night when storms are expected\nStatistical leaders: Passing — Julon Williams 51-96-5 841 yards, 7 TDs; rushing — Jay Miller 67-577, 6 TDs; receiving — Dreshon Govan 6-254, 3 TDs; tackles — Dominique Ramsey , 52; sacks — Alton Robinson , 4; interceptions — Malik Taylor , 3.\nSteele breakdown\nSetting the scene: Steele is ranked fifth in the 6A AP poll and narrowly escaped last year’s contest with a one point win. The Knights avenged their lone regular-season loss from 2014 earlier with a win over DeSoto and have outscored district opponents 175-26. Steele returns many key skill players from last year’s team that reached the 6A-DI state semifinals. Steele and Judson are guaranteed to enter the same 6A playoff brackets because of their enrollments.\nKey to victory: Steele’s passing attack could challenge Judson’s talented defensive backs. Junior quarterback Xavier Martin, junior receiver C.J. Williams and senior receiver Antoine Cox-Wesley have found success often. Martin and Cox-Wesley are both committed to Texas Tech . If the passing game is as effective as Steele’s stingy defense has been so far, the Knights could be in for another win over the Rockets.\nStatistical leaders: Passing — Martin 84-121-1, 1,385 yards, 14 TDs; rushing — Bryson Denley 58-583, 14 TDs; receiving — Williams 31-628, 5 TDs; tackles — Jayden Jackson , 72; sacks — Mark Jackson, 6; interceptions — Isaiah Fields , 4.\nE-N prediction\nSteele 33, Judson 23: The outcome shouldn’t affect either team in its title aspirations. But Steele will show why a trip to Houston to play for its second state championship is a real possibility.\nBen Baby", "external_links": ["http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/53/12/8827573/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/53/12/8827573/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/34/55/8768362/5/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/23/64/8731934/5/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/34/55/8768362/5/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/00/11/8651348/9/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/00/05/8651135/5/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/00/05/8651135/5/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/00/11/8651348/9/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/23/64/8731934/5/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/23/65/8732026/7/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/23/65/8732026/7/square_gallery_thumb.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-21T23:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T01:01:59.805+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
