I was in my home office. I heard this blood-curdling scream, and usually I wouldn’t come out around here when we hear stuff,” Mid-City resident Rachel Dangermond said.\nDangermond, though, knew someone needed help. She came out of her home to find a group of people on the corner.\n“One of the men approached us. He was on the phone with police and he was asking us what the coordinates were and everything,” Dangermond said.\nDangermond said the man told her he’d been robbed.\nAccording to police, a gunman approached a group of four people near Cleveland and Lopez streets Wednesday just after 9 p.m. and demanded their property. After the armed robbery, the gunman took off.\n“You can’t walk out of you home and be safe,” resident Lewis Wills said.\nThis armed robbery wasn’t the first incident in the neighborhood. A little over a month ago, a home invasion occurred just down the street, when four men barged into a house looking for cash.\n“They pushed open the door and shoved me down. Three other guys followed behind him. Two of them had guns,” the victim said.\n“This comes after a home invasion, some carjackings and rapes in the neighborhood. It’s just been unrelenting lately,” Dangermond said.\nPeople who live in the Mid-City neighborhood are on edge.\n“Sometimes when I leave to get my mother, I’m nervous just to walk down the street. Anything could happen,” resident Broc Wills said.\n“You can’t park here anymore because it’s so dark,” Wills said, noting that overgrown trees have knocked out street lights in the neighborhood.\n“The trees are creating dark spots. It’s pitch black at night,” Wills said.\nLongtime Mid-City residents say they love their homes, but things must change here before they can feel safe again.\nPolice say both the home invasion and the armed robbery remain unsolved.\nCopyright 2015 WVUE.
