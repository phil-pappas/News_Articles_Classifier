As the former Springhill running back says, “How many Charcandricks do you know?” \nWell, that’s pretty much where the story ends. His parents never gave him the background. \n“If only I knew,” he said. \nNaturally, West was asked why he didn’t press his parents for the information. \n“I was trying to learn how to spell it,” West said. \nThe Times’ 2009 All-Area running back has recently encountered a more difficult task – replacing one of the NFL’s greatest running backs. \nWith no professional snaps under his belt prior to this season, West shoulders part of the responsibility for filling the shoes of Kansas City Chiefs star Jamaal Charles, who was lost for the season following a torn ACL in his right knee in Week 5. \n“It brought tears to my eyes,” West said of the Charles injury. \n“Patience” is one lesson West, less than two years removed from Abilene Christian University, has deemed valuable in the NFL. The other is preparation. \n“You have to be prepared for everything -- a moment like this,” said West, who originally committed to Louisiana Tech as a cornerback. “We have to step up – big shoes to fill.” \nThe Chiefs’ backfield now consists of the 5-foot-10, 205-pound West, Knile Davis (5-10, 227) and former LSU star Spencer Ware (5-10, 229), who was elevated from the practice squad after Charles’ injury. According to West, there is a competitive, yet good-natured battle to produce in the Chiefs’ backfield. \n“We’re all brothers,” West said. “We’re running back by committee for real.” \nSunday, in the first game since Charles’ absence, West was the guy. He collected a team-high 10 touches (nine carries for 33 yards, one catch for 6 yards). However, West’s first career start didn’t exactly follow a Hollywood script. \nWest was stuffed on a fourth-and-1 carry at Minnesota’s 7-yard-line, although the Chiefs argued West's knee never touched the ground. The play was not reviewed. \n“You just have to move on,” West said. “There were more opportunities to make plays.” \nUnfortunately, West fell victim to his first fumble when a teammate jarred the ball loose at the Vikings’ 38 with 4:32 remaining in the game. The Chiefs lost 16-10 and dropped to 1-5. \n“The fumble killed everything,” West said. “At that point of the game it’s crucial. It doesn’t matter who hits it, at the end of the day you have to hold on to it.” \nKansas City head coach Andy Reid concurred. \n“It's too bad it ended the way it did,” he said. “Charcandrick did some nice things. We had 24 plays in the first half, so he didn't get to show much there. I thought as things went on he did some nice things. Got a couple of good blitz pickups, he had a couple good runs, ran hard and aggressive. He has to hang onto the football. He learned a lesson, whether it's your own guy punching it out- not by purpose obviously- or somebody else hits it. It doesn't matter. You have to keep it high and tight.\" \nWest isn’t the only local product learning to deal with Charles’ injury. Kansas City’s offensive coordinator Doug Pederson, a former Northeast Louisiana (ULM) star and former Calvary Baptist Academy head coach. \n“You know – the (running backs) that we have, we’ve had them since OTAs and through camp so you know their strengths and weaknesses,” Pederson said. “Charcandrick gives you a little more of that shiftiness. He’s a one-cut guy that can make guys miss. He is a tough nut that sticks his hat in there and is not afraid to take on a defensive end or a linebacker. \n“We’ll put them in situations to utilize their strengths.” \nPerhaps West will get an opportunity at redemption when the Chiefs host the Steelers on Sunday. \n“I’m just going to do what I’m asked to do,” he said. \nTwitter: @RoyLangIII 9 CONNECT 4 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://www.shreveporttimes.com/story/sports/nfl/2015/10/21/former-springhill-running-back-gets-shot-nfl-starter/74341780/ TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T22:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T23:10:30.756+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
