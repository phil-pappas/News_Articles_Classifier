(I'm) trying to worry about the next team. That stuff isn't on my mind too much. It's so out of your control. Anything can happen in football. You don't want to stake on anything. You don't want to get too far ahead. You have so much to worry about with the week in front of you. \n\"You just play as well as you can. That stuff's kind of out of my control. It's not something I really focus on. You've got so much else to worry about week-in and week-out going against such good players. If you do your part on the field, really the rest will take care of itself.\" \nWith it being a contract year for Schwartz, he has picked a great time to play the most consistent football of his career. Schwartz is currently ranked as the No. 1 right tackle in the NFL by Pro Football Focus. \n\"It's obviously nice,\" Schwartz said. \"It's hard to put a quantifiable grade on things like that. It's hard to figure out what we're supposed to do on every play. So many things go into every play. Maybe the back's supposed to be here and you're expecting one guy to be there, another guy to be there. It's hard to evaluate stuff, but obviously, I'll take positive grading. It's kind of cool. \n\"Obviously, it's cool to be rated high. I respect what they do. They obviously do a good job of it, and I think there's no one really like it out there right now. It's based on some really cool stuff, but it's so hard for us to evaluate ourselves, let alone I couldn't imagine trying to figure out what -- especially with O-linemen -- it's so hard to quantify performance. \n\"Sack stuff could be misleading. A guy could go a game and give up no sacks and give up 14 pressures, 14 quarterback hits. He didn't give up a sack, but he had a terrible game. It's kind of cool, but it also has some drawbacks.\" \nAnd it is not just Pro Football Focus that considers Schwartz as the top right tackle in the game. \nEight-time Pro Bowl left tackle Joe Thomas, who has lined up on the same line as Schwartz since he was drafted in 2011, feels his bookend lineman is playing at an elite level. \n\"I think Mitch is playing outstanding,\" Thomas said. \"I think he's playing as good as any right tackle right now in the NFL. He's playing lights-out. He's doing a great job. The challenges that we've drawn on the offensive line and as offensive tackles specifically have been as great as any in my career. Every week, we're playing all-pro-caliber guys and for him to be playing as well as he has is a testament to the work that he does each week. \n\"People always seem to like to pick on the right tackle ever since I got here, for good reason or bad reason, so I'm sure people are picking on him now even though they shouldn't be, but it's important not to pay attention to the outside noise because when you're winning, people love you and when you're losing, people hate you, and it doesn't matter how you're playing individually.\" \nAccording to Schwartz, his successes on the line have come from a better understanding of what is expected of him, and he embraces the opportunity to play against a physical defense like the Rams at the Edward Jones Dome today. \n\"It's been a decent start,\" Schwartz said. \"I think there's still some things I'd like to clean up. I'm kind of a perfectionist about stuff, so even if you get the job done correctly, there's some technique stuff to clean up. Maybe it's not going to work this week. Chris Long's got a different set of moves than someone else does, so maybe what I'm doing isn't going to work against him. So I've got to make sure I'm on top of things and I think that's what separates Joe from a lot of other guys is just his consistency. That's something that you've got to strive for. \n\"It's a fast defense as well, so that'll pose some challenges for us. We know they're going to be a good pass defense, so we've just got to make sure we're on top of our game and kind of ramp up the speed a little bit.\" Read or Share this story: http://on.wkyc.com/1N0BAjM TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T14:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T14:07:08.702+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
