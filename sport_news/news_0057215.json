LAHS football coaches said of Garcia, “Caylan played hard on defense and shut down any run attempts up the middle. The opposing team would double-team Caylan and try to stop him. Good job, Caylan. Keep up the good work!” Of Spady, LAHS volleyball coaches commented, “She is a hard worker, comes in ready for practice every day and she keeps improving. She understands the rules of the game and earned her spot as a captain on C-team.”   Writer", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T14:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T18:59:30.688+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
