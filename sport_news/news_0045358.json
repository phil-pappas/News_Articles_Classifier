The Canton Little Giants are at the top of the list as coach Ryan Pearson's club must win-out to finish at 5-4 and hope they have enough playoff points. Both Farmington and South Fulton are 4-2 and have key match-ups this weekend. The North Fulton Wildcats are even again at 3-3 and probably must win their final three games as five wins and playoff points might not get them in. As for Lewistown, coach Darren Winkler's club earned their first win last week and hope to play spoiler as the season closes out. Friday Night Lights Limestone (3-3, 2-2) at Canton (3-3, 2-2) \"Limestone is a good football team,\" said Canton coach Ryan Pearson. \"The biggest thing that impresses me is that they play with confidence. They have great senior leadership and every kid on the field played against us last year as juniors.\" The Rockets also are still in playoff contention. They played Metamora tough last week before losing 42-33. In addition, coach Darin Driscoll's team has Dunlap and Pekin left on their schedule after finishing with Canton on Friday. \"They are not fancy,\" said Pearson about the Rockets. \"They run the belly and we must be able to contain their quarterback who has the ability to get outside.\" \"We've talked to the kids about adversity this week,\" added Pearson. \"What defines you is how you handle it. We've got to buck up and work harder.\" Farmington (4-2, 4-0) at Elmwood (5-1, 4-0) On paper, this has the potential to be the best 'small school' game in the area. Farmington has won four games in a row after beginning the year 0-2. Coach Toby Vallas' team has gotten outstanding efforts from quarterback Steven Gilstrap and running back Jake Jepson. Receivers Reid Berry Eric Higgs have also done a good job of catching the ball. Meanwhile, the Trojans and Farmers are tied atop the Prairieland Conference Blue Division. Whoever wins this game will be conference champs. And with all this on the line, both teams will have every reason to be up for this game. And when you figure in the proximity of the two schools and their history with each other, that just adds fuel to the fire. Elmwood's lone loss was a 28-21 defeat at the hands of Kewanee Wethersfield-Annawan the second week of the season. Farmington lost 20-14 to the same team in the season's first week. South Fulton (4-2, 2-2) at Rushville-Industry (4-2, 3-1) The schedule makers certainly didn't do the Rebels any favors as coach Dave Wilson's team closes out the year against Rushville-Industry, Knoxville, and Elmwood-Brimfield. Page 2 of 2 - Playing without quarterback Alex Dorethy and receiver Tyson McGinnis, the Rebels overcame an early deficit against North Fulton last week only to have the Wildcats score late for the comeback win. Reserve quarterback Trace Hood moved back to receiver during the game with Seth Hammond taking over behind center. Defensively, the Rebels will need to find a way to keep the Rockets' offense off the field. Additionally, R-I won't be in a very good mood after losing 14-13 to Lewistown last week. Peoria Heights (3-3, 2-2) vs North Fulton (3-3,2-2) at Valley Both teams come into the game with identical overall and conference records. The Wildcats earned a big win last week by beating South Fulton 28-22. As the schedule plays out, coach Elliott Craig's team will earn a forfeiture win over River Valley next week. However, a win over the Patriots will make the road to the playoffs somewhat easier as they finish the season against Havana on the road. The Patriots have just two games left as their Week 9 opponent was to be River Valley so they can't afford to stumble Friday or next week against Farmington. A 5-4 record will put then on the bubble with their extrapolated playoff points. Lewistown (1-5, 1-3) at Abingdon-Avon (3-3, 2-2) The Indians of coach Daren Winkler pulled off the upset last week with a 14-13 win over Rushville-Industry. Two key PATs from Seth Boggs and defensive stand with one second left kept the Rockets out of the end zone on a 2-point conversion which would have won the game. Meanwhile, the Tornadoes are fighting for their playoff lives. After Lewistown this week, coach Rick Quinn's teams closes out against Elmwood-Brimfield and Knoxville. The Indians though come first and should A-Town stumble Friday night their season will be practically over.
