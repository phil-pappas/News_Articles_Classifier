There are a lot more than one fox in the area.\nJIM WOOTEN\nSavannah\nWho would want to work for a corrupt police department?\nLet me start by saying I have nothing against City Manager Stephanie Cutter.\nI do not feel that she is qualified to oversee the police department, so I offer a solution.\nI hear and read all the time that the new police chief’s hands, like maybe other chiefs’ hands, were tied by the city manager.\nHow about a police commissioner who will oversee the police department?\nThis works in all the major cities.\nLet this person be chosen by a group of the mayor, district attorney, chairman of the Chatham County Commission, sheriff and maybe an independent citizen. I have never met Chief Joseph Lumpkin, but I feel safe in saying he did not need this job, but took it anyway as a challenge.\nHow can he do his job when his hands are tied?\nWith the recent lawsuit, it seems possible that some of those that served under Willie Lovett may still be on the force and the perception in the public eye is that our police force is still corrupt, which will explain all the crime and not use the lack of officers as an excuse.\nTo close, who in their right mind would want to work for a police department with all these dark clouds over their heads?\nCHIP DETWILER\nSavannah\nHow to improve Savannah’s tour guides\nSavannah is a city of character, not a city of characters.\nThe feeling of the Hostess City cannot be summed up by a bench, a statue, a “hey y’all,” or even a Panama hat.\nNotable personalities have helped preserve its character; citizens like Thomas Gamble, Lee Adler, Sarah Parsons and W. W. Law (just to name a few) have saved this jewel of city planning for generations to come.\nAs National Trust Guide to Savannah Rhoulac Toledano claims, “A viable historic city is the best gift a community can give to itself and to civilization.”\nHistoric Jonesborough, Tenn., is the Storytelling Capital of the World, and as such, storytellers and their listeners gather there from all across America to share stories.\nSavannah is the original capital of the British Colony of Georgia and people from all over the world come to learn its history.\n“A narrative that is not merely in a dry detail of events, but a series of authentic historical facts, determined with acuteness, commented on with deliberation, and relieved by pleasing anecdote or interesting episode.” (William of Malmesbury)\nA tour guide accreditation system needs to be established.\nThis could possibly be accomplished under the auspices of Historic Savannah Foundation that could work with Armstrong State University to offer a course(s) that culminates in a certificate of completion.\nThere are many precedents for granting licenses and permits to tour guides.\nThe U.K. has a four-badge system, which reserves the Blue Badge for the most competent and accurate guides.\nFrance grants a “license professionelle guide conferencier” — a university level diploma. In Italy, where tourism is one of the leading industries, tour guides are held to a high standard to ensure that consumers are protected and that they receive the highest level of service.\nFor example, after earning a degree in art history, the applicant is required to pass an intensive exam issued by the province in which he or she wishes to work.\nYou can easily spot a licensed guide by the credentials they wear around their neck or carry on their person.\nI am by no means insisting on a college-level diploma, but merely that guides demonstrate a basic knowledge of the facts so that the visitor is not shortchanged.\nThe National Park Service has a buzzword: “infotainment.” People want entertainment, but they also want good, reliable information. Seeing a badge of accreditation will help tourists know whom to choose as their guide.\nROBERT EDGERLY\nSavannah\nDon’t be a Kool-Aid drinker\nI am writing in response to the letter of Oct. 4 from Emma Walthour Morel Adler entitled, “Pope Francis reminds her of Martin Luther.”\nLuther was a reformer, but one must be reminded he was just a man.\nHe, like most men, had a side that people try to hide. He was anti-Semitic.\nAt first, he was sympathetic to the Jews for their opposition to the Catholic Church, but when he realized they would not convert to Christianity he turned violently against them.\nEmma should read Luther’s “The Jews and their Lies.” He advocates setting fire to their schools and synagogues; their houses be razed and destroyed; all their prayer books and Talmudic writings be taken from them; all their cash and treasure be taken from them and put aside for safekeeping.\nRead his entire essay to really understand Luther’s hatred of the Jews.\nHitler used the writings of Luther to justify the Holocaust.\nAs to Pope Francis, doing what “he thinks is best for all humanity,” let me say this: Throughout history many have done what they thought was best for humanity. Tyrants such as Lenin, Mao, Mussolini, Stalin, Ivan the Terrible, Pinochet, Pol Pot and Kim Jong Il are just a few. I am not comparing the pope to them, just illustrating how it can be abused.\nOne must be weary of anyone professing to know what is best. Do as Paul writes in Acts 17;11. He praised the Bereans because they examined the Scriptures every day to see if what Paul said was true.\nDo not be a Kool-Aid drinker.\nAL SAPP\nSavannah", "external_links": ["http://sav-cdn.com/sites/all/themes/savannahnow/images/blank.gif"], "published": "2015-10-10T19:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T12:13:27.188+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
