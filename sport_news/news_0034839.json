He looked tired, not from the long night but from the slow months that made such a night inevitable. \n“There were periods of time this year when this team looked like it had a chance to do some serious damage in October,” the Yankees general manager said. “But that team that we saw earlier wasn’t the team that finished.” \nIn the end, the Yankees were not good enough. Their wild card elimination to the upstart Astros was not a one-night disappointment, it was the product of two-plus months of declining numbers and diminishing confidence. \nAfter losing six of seven in the final week of the season, the Yankees backed into home field advantage on Tuesday and left even their GM unconvinced they could get the one win necessary to keep this season going. \n“I didn’t know what to expect from this club (in the wild card game),” Cashman said. “I thought hopefully we could turn it on and now it’s a new season and we would kind of reset that button mentally, physically, emotionally. Didn’t happen. And that’s probably a credit to (Astros starter) Dallas Keuchel, but it’s also more reflective of how we’ve recently been playing baseball.” \nFlash back to late July, and Cashman approached the trade deadline believing he’d assembled a contender. Alex Rodriguez had outperformed all expectation, the rotation was relatively healthy, and some young pitchers had emerged to fortify the bullpen. \nThe Yankees went 17-7 in the month of July, pushed their division lead to a season-high seven games, and began to score runs in bunches as the deadline approached. \nCashman did very little. He made a relatively minor trade for Dustin Ackley, but otherwise stuck with his team, choosing to supplement from within rather than make a splash. \nCashman said he made aggressive offers for relief pitchers — including one report of offering a top shortstop prospect for Padres closer Craig Kimbrel — but no one took the bait. Supplementing the lineup was tricky because every position but second base was tied to a player under a long-term commitment. \nHe talked to the A’s about second baseman Ben Zobrist, but Oakland wanted both Rob Refsnyder and Adam Warren, so Cashman passed. \n“I didn’t have any place to put anybody,” Cashman said. “I’d be piling guys on top of guys that didn’t have a place to play.” \nProspects Luis Severino and Greg Bird played well as much-needed injury replacements, and the combination of Refsnyder and Ackley eventually took over second base, but injuries to Nathan Eovaldi, Mark Teixeira and Bryan Mitchell — who was expected to become a key bullpen contributor — came too late for Cashman to make a move. Ditto for Alex Rodriguez’s late-season decline. \nFrom August 1 to the end of the season, the Yankees had a losing record. The team that controlled the division for four months was long gone by the time the Yankees took the field on Tuesday. \n“No excuses,” Rodriguez said. “I think the team just hit a wall, collectively, and that’s rare because usually some guys get hot, some guys get cold. It seemed like all of us hit the wall at the same time.” \nHow to get past that wall going forward? That’s tricky for the very same reasons Cashman found it difficult to make a splash at the trade deadline. The Yankees have plenty of big names coming off the books next winter — Teixeira, Carlos Beltran, possibly CC Sabathia — but their biggest free agents this offseason are role players Stephen Drew, Chris Young and Chris Capuano. \nEven breakout rookie Bird might not have a place to play next season due to commitments to Teixeira and Rodriguez. \nSo if these are the Yankees going forward, which will it be: the group that defied expectations the first 100 games, or the group that fell apart in the final 62? \n“Am I comfortable with those guys moving forward? Yeah,” Cashman said. “Do I recognize that we have to find ways to improve ourselves at the same time and continue to find more weapons for Joe Girardi to utilize and this coaching staff to fall back on? The answer to that is yes, too.” 1 CONNECT 2 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://lohud.us/1RubfKD TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-07T22:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T01:07:54.928+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
