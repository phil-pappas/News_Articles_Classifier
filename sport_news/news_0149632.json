Every year the university hosts festivities to get the fans pumped up for the coming season. This year, the UConn programs urged people to wear glow in the dark clothing for its Glow in the Dark theme. The first 8,000 fans received glow in the dark sunglasses. Freshman Tristan Marino was happy to show his stuff. \"I have some Nike glow-in-the-dark shorts and I got a neon tank top so trying to follow the instructions and see where it goes,\" he said. Where it goes is inside Gampel Pavilion, where a UConn-East Carolina women's volleyball match held the court in the afternoon. At 7:30 p.m. a co-ed scrimmage, Team Geno versus Team Kevin, begins. Many of the students staying outside the doors lined up for their first First Night. Sarah Anderson, UConn freshman, said, \"I came to UConn because they have a really good science program and I absolutely love that and I love all the sports that they have too.\" Allison Tozzi, a UConn freshman who took a shot at a dunk tank set up to promote the Homecoming football game Saturday said, \"I mean the campus is really big and having activities like this always happening is exactly why I came here.\" Admission to First Night is free and the event is open to the public.
