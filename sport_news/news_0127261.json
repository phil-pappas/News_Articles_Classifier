Photo by Charlotte Wilder If you stand near what you’re guessing is the center of the corn maze at Marini Farms in Ipswich, Massachusetts on a weekday morning, you won’t hear much. The music playing from the loudspeaker by the farmstand (most likely a Johnny Cash song) will be muffled by the rustling of the corn leaves many feet above your head. The weekend crowds and their accompanying sounds—the yelling children and the thumping of feet along dirt paths—won’t be there to fill the space.\n“You get out there, and it’s a different world,” said Sarah Churchill, one of the farm employees. “It’s quiet.”\nRelated Links Get today’s headlines right in your inbox Where to go apple picking in Massachusetts It’s also potentially terrifying. As you stare up at the stalks of corn that have become your own personal jailer, you may feel momentary panic. That anxiety, however, is no match for the thrill of finally figuring out how to escape.\nThe maze at Marini Farms attracts a myriad of enthusiasts chasing that thrill, including families, elderly folks who walk the maze every morning for exercise, couples on dates, school tours, corporate groups looking to engage in team-building, and birthday parties. But the activities don’t end with the corn maze.\nOver the years, a veritable fairground of farm-themed activities and games has sprouted up in the grassy space before the maze’s entrance. It’s filled with bouncy houses, a silo of dried corn where children play, a huge slide, some water games, a sand pit (“that’s a real crowd-pleaser”) and a giant wooden pirate ship. Visitors can even rent out fire pits and purchase a package that includes a farm dinner and s’mores.\nPrevious -- of -- Next Abandon all hope, ye who enter here.

Photo by Charlotte Wilder Previous -- of -- Next Advertisement This agricultural playground is exactly what Mike Marini, the farm’s owner, had in mind when he first cut a maze through a field of corn with his lawn mower in 2001 as a recent college graduate. The farm, which his grandparents bought in 1928, thrived during the summer months. But after Labor Day, Marini said, business would slack off.\nGiven that most of the farm’s 200 acres of vegetables are being harvested during the fall, this was terrible timing.\n“We needed a way to bring people back and keep them coming through the end of year,” Marini said.\nEnter “agratainment,” as Marini calls it. He’d seen a corn maze at a farm in Delaware and thought he could generate revenue through admissions and attract an influx of customers who would shop at the farmstand.\nThe pirate ship at Marini Farms is new this year. Photo by Charlotte Wilder But he realized he needed to enlist the help of a professional. He reached out to Hugh McPherson, a man whose entire business, Maize Quest, is centered around helping farmers sustain their working farms with corn mazes. The company is now a franchise, with 75 farms across the country participating.\nIn exchange, McPherson’s team uses their expensive GPS technology to design and cut mazes and coordinate all the marketing materials for the mazes’ themes.\n“We used to design the maze by hand, and it would take days,” McPherson said. “But now, with our high-level GPS system, which isn’t something any single farm would want to purchase since it costs thousands and thousands of dollars, we can spread that cost over 75 locations. It makes it very affordable for Mike to have his maze cut by us every year.”\nThis year at Marini, the maze’s theme is pirates. Although McPherson lives in Pennsylvania, you’ve seen him if you’ve been to Marini’s maze: He plays the pirate in the introduction video you have to watch before you take you life into your own hands and venture into the heart of the corn field.\nYou will probably never see a more enthusiastic pirate, and it’s worth noting that he’s just as eager on the phone out of character as he is brandishing a plastic sword around, yelling, “Avast, ye scurvy slobs!”\n“Yes, I am the pirate,” McPherson said.\n“Mike and his wonderful gang have invested time, energy and money in creating this wonderful place for family and kids,” McPherson continued. “And we like to make sure when people get there, they’ve got that impression he’s dedicated to their experience.”\nFall isn’t Marini’s only cash cow. At Christmas time, Marini turns the farm into a “winter wonderland,” and offers sleigh rides, wreaths, Christmas trees, and more holiday activities.\nBut for all the additions, Marini never loses sight of the main goal: Keeping his family’s farm afloat. His father, who owned the farm before he did, still works in the fields with him.\n“The other franchise owners and I are all just trying to do everything we can to keep our farms going,” Marini said. “People see that and support it.”\nIt’s decorative gourd season.
