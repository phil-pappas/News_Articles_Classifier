Maybe that isn't a big deal for Alabama's first-year starting quarterback Jake Coker and his sensational receiver, true freshman Calvin Riddle. \nAlabama's used to playing big games, right? And the Crimson Tide comes in as a four-point favorite, so maybe the noise isn't such a problem when A&M's two stud pass rushers, Myles Garrett and Daeshon Hall, tee off on Coker when it's third-and-long. \nAll Alabama needs is Coker on his back a couple times early in the game and Garrett and Hall celebrating a sack. The noise will be off the chart. Don't think the Aggies and their fans haven't forgotten about Alabama 59, Texas A&M 0. But Saban and staff know that, so figure on Coker getting some of the same max protection he got at Georgia. Yes, Coker has improved but reading between the lines of Aggies defensive coordinator John Chavis, he's not so much worried about Coker scrambling out of trouble as letting him have time to throw. \n\"He's gotten better and better,\" Chavis told reporters this week. \"He can throw extremely well ... he's not going to be as mobile as some quarterbacks we've seen. But he operates their system really well. ... He'll have our attention but Alabama's not going to change a lot of what it likes to do, and that's run the ball.\" \nAnd with the Aggies 12th in the SEC in rushing defense and 83rd in the nation (allowing 182.6 ypg), Chavis knows his defense is going to see a lot of Derrick Henry and Kenyan Drake, especially between the tackles where A&M is the most vulnerable. \nThis week's picks: \nAlabama vs. Texas A&M \nThis could turn into a shootout, which isn't in Alabama's best interest. With sophomore quarterback Kyle Allen a perfect 11-of-11 on first drives during the past four games, A&M has outscored opponents 121-37 in the first quarter. If the Tide can withstand A&M's early quick-strike pressure, especially Allen's ability to run an uptempo offense that has been a pain in the past for a Saban-Kirby Smart defense, Alabama can leave College Station with its SEC West title hopes in tact. A loss and the Tide falls two games behind A&M and one behind Ole Miss, the two teams likely to be left standing in the division. \nAlabama's best bet to win the game hinges on ball control and reducing how many times A&M's offense is on the field. If Alabama isn't rushing for 200 yards this weekend, this could be trouble. \nAlabama 36, Texas A&M 31 \nIn the SEC Ole Miss 38, Memphis 35Mississippi State 36, Louisiana Tech 17South Carolina 23, Vanderbilt 21LSU 24, Florida 17", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T15:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T18:13:21.543+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
