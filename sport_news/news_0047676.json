The Division of Wildlife will be releasing pheasants on Oct. 23 and 30, prior to the small-game season weekends for youth hunters. Youngsters age 17 and younger can hunt statewide for rabbit, pheasant, and all other legal game in season during two designated weekends, Oct. 24-25 and Oct. 31-Nov. 1. Ohio’s small game hunting season begins on Friday, Nov. 6, with pheasant releases to take place Nov. 5, and 13. A final release of the year is scheduled to provide pheasant hunting opportunities throughout the Thanksgiving holiday weekend and will take place on Nov. 25. Among the wildlife areas that will receive birds are Delaware, Killdeer Plains, Resthaven, Shreve, Spencer, Salt Fork and Grand River. For a full list of the 25 public hunting areas, visit bit.ly/pheasantlocations. \nAcorns are down in wildlife areas \nThere’s good news and bad news for hunters this fall. The 2015 Ohio acorn mast survey conducted at 38 wildlife areas showed a decrease in production from 2014. That’s bad news since the acorn crop, particularly white oaks, are an important food source for wild creatures from deer and wild turkeys to squirrels, so important for deer particularly, that they’ll often abandon farm crops and other foods like alfalfa to feast on the protein, fat and carbohydrate rich nuts. Overall there was a 23 percent decrease for white oaks in the number of trees bearing acorns. The good news? The poor mast crop should improve deer hunter success, particularly among archers, because deer will be moving more to actively search for food. \nWaterways safety council looking for members \nThose interested in boating issues might like to visit the Waterways Safety Council’s quarterly meeting at 10 a.m. Oct. 28.
