But throughout his career, Busch endured an annual tradition: Watching his Chase for the Sprint Cup hopes somehow blow up. \n“It’s September, October, November right?” Busch said Friday at Dover International Speedway. “That’s typically the time of the season in which something seems to happen to myself.” \nIt’s true: The strangest twists of fate strike Busch during the Chase, which has resulted in him never coming close to winning the title despite 33 career Cup wins (only one of which came during the Chase). Matt Kenseth on pole after Dover qualifying rained out \nJust look at last week’s race at New Hampshire Motor Speedway, when he had an inexplicable flat tire early in a run and crashed into the wall. \n“That just doesn’t make any sense,” Busch said of getting a flat tire after only 23 laps on it. “That has absolutely nothing to do with over-camber or over-using the brakes or melting a bead or anything like that. You can’t blow one that fast — but we can or I can.” \nThe resulting 37th-place finish left him 13th in the standings heading into an elimination race Sunday at Dover, after which only 12 drivers will advance. Dover: Most recent wins for legends; pressure cooker for Chase drivers \nAnd it’s not like this is a new occurrence for Busch. Last year, the Joe Gibbs Racing driver was having his most consistent and solid start to the Chase yet, seemingly in prime position to advance to the third round. \nAll he had to do was stay out of trouble at Talladega Superspeedway, so the smart strategy play was to drop to the back. \nBut then a wreck happened in front of him and Austin Dillon didn’t hit the brakes in time, slamming into Busch from behind. Just like that, Busch’s Chase was done again. \nPHOTOS: Behind the wheel with Kyle Busch Posted! A link has been posted to your Facebook feed. Kyle Busch was born May 2, 1985.
