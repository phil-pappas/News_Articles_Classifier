The property was included in the failed Measure L, which would have changed development restrictions to allow more homes while preserving some open space. Developer Terry Manley is now talking with opponents about a compromise project that could go to the ballot in 2016. , DAVID BAUMAN, FILE PHOTO Related article » ANOTHER BALLOT MEASURE? Riverside residents in November rejected Measure L, which would have changed development restrictions in the La Sierra area. Now developer Terry Manley is in talks with residents who led the opposition about a compromise proposal.\nHistory: Measure L would have allowed up to 1,950 homes on the 650-acre La Sierra Lands and preserved as open space the 650-acre La Sierra Hills. About 560 homes would be allowed on the entire 1,300 acres under current rules.\nFuture: Few details are available, but talks have centered on a 725-home development with a park and equestrian trails. Voters could see a ballot measure in 2016.\nInformation: Councilman John Burnard will discuss the issue at a meeting of Residents for Responsible Representation from 7 to 8:30 p.m. Oct. 12 at the Magnolia police station, 10540 Magnolia Ave., Riverside. It also will be on the group's Nov. 9 agenda.\nEven as they celebrated the defeat of Measure L in November, opponents of development in and around Riverside’s La Sierra Hills knew the issue wasn’t over.\nThey may be proven right next year. Las Vegas developer Terry Manley, who proposed the failed initiative that would have allowed up to 1,950 homes, has been meeting with residents who led the opposition, hoping to hammer out a compromise project that could be on the 2016 ballot.\nBecause of four-decade-old development restrictions, voters would have to approve any project that would build more than about 560 homes on the combined 1,300 acres of La Sierra Hills and La Sierra Lands, two swaths of relatively undeveloped property on the city’s west end.\nFew details about the potential development have been made public, and it’s not clear whether proponents are aiming for the June ballot, which also will include the mayor’s race, or the November presidential election, when voter turnout is typically much higher.\nDiscussions have centered on a much smaller project. It might include 725 homes plus a park, equestrian trails, a site for a future school and a water reclamation facility, according to a news release provided by former Ward 7 Councilwoman Laura Densmore.\nIn an email, Manley confirmed that he has had “very preliminary discussions” with Measure L opponents about a possible ballot measure but added, “We need to have many more discussions with a lot more folks before anything is decided.” He did not respond to a request for further comment.\nLast fall, Densmore led the opposition to Measure L in a David-and-Goliath battle that pitted residents’ grass-roots efforts against Manley’s more than $1.5 million campaign. But she has been meeting with him “to explore an alternative that gives the community an opportunity to play an active role in determining the future for this property,” she said in the release.\nDensmore couldn’t be reached for further comment.\nSome people view the talks about a possible development with concern or even suspicion.\nSharon Mateja, who lives in the La Sierra area and runs the community group Residents for Responsible Representation, said that as with Measure L, residents are still worried that a major development will worsen traffic, and they wonder whether the city has enough water to serve new homes and who will pay to build the needed school.\nAcross the border in Norco, Councilman Kevin Bash has similar worries, and he’s gearing up for a fight.\nHe’s frustrated that no one told him about the talks earlier, though they’ve been going on for months, he said. Bash thinks 725 homes is still too many, and he doesn’t favor cutting a deal on a measure that would sweep away development restrictions.\n“Boo-hoo if they can’t afford to build the homes and make a profit, but the voters have spoken now several times on this issue,” he said.\nOthers in Riverside want to hear more about what’s planned before they make up their minds.\n“If we need to fight, we’ll fight, but hopefully we can have some rational, realistic discussion about what needs to be done and what things we need to mitigate,” said resident Zack Earp, a Measure L opponent.\nContact the writer: 951-368-9461 or arobinson@pe.com", "external_links": ["http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/twitter-ico.jpg", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/fb-ico.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nvmcn1-b88529276z.120151002174046000gf4ccd43.10.jpg", "http://assets.pinterest.com/js/pinmarklet.js?r=", "http://s7.addthis.com/js/250/addthis_widget.js#username=YOUR-ACCOUNT-ID", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/mail-ico.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nvmcn1-b88529276z.120151002174046000gf4ccd43.10.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T04:04:40.836+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
