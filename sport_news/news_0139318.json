Roy Hibbert came over to Booker and bumped him, and the Jazz forward slapped him on the top of the head. That earned him another tech, and Booker was ejected. \nBooker will wait and see if the NBA hands out a suspension, though. If the league decided it, the Jazz will be without one of its big men for the start of the regular season. \nBut since it wasn't a closed-fist punch, there's a chance Booker will avoid a suspension and only receive a fine. \nWhat do you think? Should Booker be suspended for his double-technical call during the preseason? Let us know in the poll below.
