This year it was Shunali Shroff’s book ‘Battle hymn of a bewildered mother’, which is about parenting in the time of the Kadarshians, that kept the entertainment quotient high. Keeping her company on the stage was Ranbir Shorey, Bollywood actor. There were two high-voltage sessions — the first one saw the release of Khurshid Mahmud Kasuri’s book ‘Neither a dove, nor a hawk’, and the second one, a discussion on Gen VP Malik’s book, ‘Recent military conflicts and diplomacy: My experience’. Moderated by Ambassador SK Lambah, former external affairs minister from Pakistan Kasuri’s book session opened to a jam-packed hall. Emotions always run high whenever the discussion centres around Indo-Pak relations. The four-point framework—which includes Jammu and Kashmir could not be made independent, borders could not be redrawn, the LoC could be made irrelevant and a joint mechanism for both parts of Kashmir could be worked out. Kasuri made a witty comment: “Differences occur even in the best of marriages”, indicating there is still hope for the two nations. Indo-Pak relations again took the centrestage when Gen VP Malik recounted all major battles fought by India in 30 years, including the Kargil, in detail. Some of the discussions were hard hitting too. A panel comprising Rinki Roy, Vandana Shah and Juggi Bhasin took up rape: “Are we still asking the right questions? Peppering the trend further were two more sessions, “The Banana Republic and State Terrorism” that had a panel comprising Barkha Roy, Jatin Das, Avirook Sen, Santosh Desai and Govind Nihalini. The discussion centred around the art movement and moral policing, freedom of expression and misuse of freedom, followed by the media, mayhem and paparazzi with Fahad Samar and Malavika Sanghhavi discussing media adventures and misadventures with interesting anecdotes. Namita Gokhle and Ashok Dilwali covered ‘A century of Himalayan tales’ and John Eliott talk about ‘Implosion: 25 years of covering India for the East and the West’. Khushwant Singh’s book, ‘Portrait of a serial killer’ was launched on the concluding day.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T00:17:12.385+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
