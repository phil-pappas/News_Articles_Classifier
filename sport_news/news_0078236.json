They're (Michigan) not making a lot of mistakes.\n\"We just have to come confident and be ready to play. We look forward to the challenge.\"\nThe challenge is traveling to Michigan Stadium and entering the rivalry game against the surging Wolverines (5-1) as the perceived underdog for the first time in a while -- even though the Spartans remain undefeated (6-0).\n\"I think you're only underdogs if you think you're underdogs,\" Dantonio said, \"I will say that Michigan is playing outstanding football right now and we need to play better at certain points in time.\n\"We are undefeated, though. We've found ways to win football games, and that's the bottom line. Every game is different as we move forward, and we look forward to the challenge and opportunity\"\nDantonio is looking at every step back as an opportunity to grow stronger. Injuries seem to be the common theme for the Spartans this season (Conklin, London, Williamson, Sweat, Copeland, Meyers, Davis). Without commenting on who's fit to play against Michigan, Dantonio did say that his team is always prepared.\n\"You always have a plan; if so and so goes down, there is always a plan in place,\" Dantonio said. \"That's why you work your twos, that's why you recruit other players. It should make your football team stronger in the long run, and that's what we are always looking toward.\n\"Whether it's losing a player or losing a football game, you have to gain something, and you have to also gain from winning.\"\nAlthough continuously giving coach Jim Harbaugh and his team the respect they have earned this season, you can hear the determination in Dantonio's voice when he talks specifically about what this game means to Michigan State.\n\"For me, personally, and probably a lot of people, a lot of players, there are certain games that you measure yourself against because you measure yourself against the past. You sort of keep track,\" said Dantonio. \"Not to say that the other games aren't important, but you just sort of put a little bit more emphasis on this.\n\"So, yeah, it's exciting.\"\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.foxsports.com/", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T04:39:29.513+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
