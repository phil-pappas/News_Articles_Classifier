The Demons placed fourth or higher as a team in every competition from the freshmen to varsity boys and girls. The top-10 nationally ranked boys varsity team finished third out of 28 teams behind strong efforts from William Chandler (17), Benjamin Lachelt (21), Nicholas Turco (30), David Moenning (38), Seamus Millett (42), Jordan Helms (52) and Isaac Ducker (117). “It went very well, better than we probably expected,” said Durango head coach David McMillan. “I think the success was a combination of the fact that we were very well-prepared. The elevation change gives us an advantage because we just have more oxygen than usual and it’s just a really exciting atmosphere, so the kids get an extra boost of adrenaline.” The extra adrenaline was welcomed and much needed in a race as tightly contested and loaded with talent as the Desert Twilight. The intense competition, numerous bottlenecks and the fact the varsity race was run in total darkness led to a lot of contact taking place. “It’s just a big blur out there,” said senior David Moenning, son of Amy and Joshua Moenning. “There’s dust all over the place and elbows flying everywhere. There’s a wall of noisy people throughout the entire race and then the wall gets a little louder and you realize that it’s your teammates cheering you on. It’s an awesome experience.” David wasn’t the only Moenning to have a good day in Phoenix. Durango freshman Becca Moenning finished second in the girls small school freshman race and was followed by Anna Smagacz, who finished third. The varsity girls were led by Abby Scott’s impressive third-place finish. Sarah Smagacz (30) and Mary Fenberg (39) also ran solid races for the Demons. “I think there’s something really cool about running flatter races,” said Scott, daughter of Cecile Fraley and Donald Scott. “There was a girl from another team who I ran next to, and she was pushing me the whole way and really encouraged me to do better. I didn’t know who she was, but I introduced myself after the race and told her that I appreciated her help.” In the junior varsity boys race, Harry Steinberg led the Demons with a fifth-place finish, and Aiden Fitzgerald’s sixth-place finish in the freshman race was tops for the future Demons’ stars. “It’s easy to think that they look up to us, and we do take pride in guiding them along the way but that’s not all,” said senior Nicholas Turco, son of Richard Turco and Jack and Jennifer Turner. “They actually inspire us just as much if not more. It was amazing to see what they did in their races, and they really set the tone for us and made us want to run faster.” But, make no mistake of it, the seniors who have propped the Durango cross country program to new heights are creating a winning attitude that will last longer than they will at DHS. While many kids would be happy knowing they’re now in the top 10 in their chosen sport in the entire nation, this group won’t settle for accolades like that. “It’s just a number and this whole experience was just a stepping-stone to our real goals,” said Chandler, son of Bill and Virginia Chandler. “Our goal is to work hard until the end and keep improving as long as the other are depending on us to be our best.” “Our goal is to win the state championship and any rankings or accolades that come with it is just an added bonus,” added senior Benjamin Lachelt, son of Gwen Lachelt and Trisha Rickey. With leaders like that and a razor sharp focus, it’s no wonder they’re ranked where they are. For this tight-knit group of seniors, McMillan has instilled a team bond that only the best teams possess. “The ranking is great, but we have to stay humble and keep making a plethora of memories that will last a lifetime,” David Moenning said. “I expect us to just keep doing what we’re doing because we know that when we feel pain there are six others feeling the same pain, and there’s no way we’re going to stop until we all meet at the finish line. When the season’s over, we can look back and talk about the rankings and everything we did but, until then, it’s just a number.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T07:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T09:31:20.785+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
