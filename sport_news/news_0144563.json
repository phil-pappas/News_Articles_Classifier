Yet, I boarded the flight from Delhi to Patna reluctantly, dragging myself half out of a sense of duty as a journalist and partly because that friend’s words kept ringing in my mind. On the short runway at Patna, the aircraft came to a jolting halt. I waited for the bus only to realise that those familiar with the airport had walked down and reached before us.\nA row of men waited holding trolleys at the entrance to the arrival lounge. At the conveyor belt, an airport worker stood holding a trolley to pick up the bags of a healthy-looking man wearing a kurta, who looked influential and affluent.\nPatna looked like several other cities in the country — bustling from one chowk to another. Yet, amid the hustle and traffic, people stopped to answer a query or even talk of the political scenario. I had to drop my apprehensions about the people in Bihar, a baggage one probably carries from Delhi.\nBut, for me the story lay in rural Bihar. So I headed there in a taxi driven by a young man afflicted by polio, who would accompany me everywhere, decoding the dialect when I didn’t understand it. He was aware of the political scenario in a way that surprised me. “People are very happy with Nitish Kumar’s work but his tying up hands with Lalu Prasad Yadav has upset them,” he said.\nThe landscape turned green soon after the 5.8 kilometre Ganga setu. Rural Bihar looked picturesque with its mango, lichee and lemon trees. I started looking for a place to stop to begin my quest for the way the political winds were blowing. Soon, I realised my questions had started to begin with the query “Kaunsi jaati ke ho?” (which caste do you belong to?). I started doing caste arithmetic to determine which alliance had an edge in the polls.\nYet, it’s not as simple as it seems.\nAfter a couple of hours of driving down, it dawned that while undertaking a road journey in Bihar one has to take into account two critical things — the dearth of dhabas and toilets. For food, one can manage with fruits and biscuits or litti-chokha in some village. The next time I travelled to Bhagalpur, I was with a journalist from Patna who had kept in mind these problems and accordingly arranged a stopover midway. In Bhagalpur, I checked into a hotel with basic, but neat, AC rooms and amiable staff.\nThe morning “coffee” came with a lot of milk and cocoa. When I asked for coffee powder I got more cocoa. “Yehi tho coffee hai” (this is coffee), he insisted so innocently that I just drank it imagining it was coffee. I had heard there was a dolphin sanctuary near Bhagalpur so I went to the banks of the Ganga, 22 kms from the town. I saw a dolphin near where people were taking a dip. A 14-year-old boy Nitish Kumar sitting on the bank said the “dolphins are afraid of the people. The river needs the dolphins and the devotees have a right to take a dip in the Ganga,” he said.\nAs I passed by pretty-looking villages and the dusty towns, I was told that this was a Bihar far more developed than it was a few years ago. I had been given several warnings, from those who knew Bihar and those who did not, to be careful and not travel after dark. But, I felt safe — except on one occasion when a local RJD leader seemed suspicious about my being a journalist. People were warm and went out of their way to help me. A young boy even walked with me in the sweltering heat to a village of Musahars, a community which has come into focus because of former Chief Minister Jitan Ram Manjhi, who belongs to that community.\nAfter six days of exploring a small fraction of the state, I returned to Patna and checked into a decent hotel. Never before had I valued clean, white sheets, a cup of coffee and a plate of tomato sandwiches as much as I did that day! But never mind the dust and discomfort, I am ready to return to Bihar.\nThe author is assistant editor at dna", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T14:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T04:56:57.391+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
