The Flyers won that game in overtime. \nWell…Wednesday night, now a Boston Bruin thanks to a trade in June, Rinaldo tried again. \nHe took out his old teammate, Sean Couturier, with a suspension-worthy hit and — you guessed it — the Flyers won in overtime, beating the Bruins 5-4. It broke a six-game losing streak against the Bruins and a five-game losing streak at TD Bank Garden. \nClaude Giroux, who gave the Bruins an easy route to two goals with a turnover and a penalty, made up for it with the power-play overtime winner with 2:51 left in the extra session. \nIt was a costly victory, as neither Couturier nor goalie Michal Neuvirth was around for the end of it, both leaving with “upper-body” injuries. \n“There’s no place for it,” coach Dave Hakstol said of the hit. “That’s all I have to say. No place for it.” \nCouturier was battling along the boards with another Bruin with about 10 seconds left in the first period when Rinaldo left his feet to blindside his former teammate. Couturier fell to the ice, using both hands to grab his head. \nRinaldo was kicked out of the game, given a five-minute major for charging and a game misconduct. The Flyers had a five-minute power play featuring zero shots to start the second period. \n“That was a horrible power play,” said Wayne Simmonds, who tied the game midway through the third period. “I think that was the worst power play we’ve had in the last four and a half years since I’ve been here. That’s unacceptable, but I thought we showed great character battling back from that.” \nHeading into the first intermission the game was tied 2-2. Neuvirth’s shutout streak was over after 145:33, when he surrendered a rebound goal to Brett Connolly. Patrice Bergeron, whose wife Stephanie delivered their first child earlier in the day, scored with 2:36 to go in the period, knocking the puck out of mid-air and hitting Neuvirth over the head with his stick in the process. \nMason was called into duty after Neuvirth made 10 saves. It was a rocky start in relief, giving up two goals in four minutes, although the first was deflected twice before going in the net. \nHis big moment came at 6:34 of the third, when the Flyers were down two and David Pastrnak was threatening to make it three. Mason was so deep in his crease when he made the save that it garnered a video review to see if he didn’t block the puck after it had crossed the goalline. It hadn’t. \n“It was a big moment, but at the same time those are things that I expect of myself and I think the team expects from its goaltenders,” said Mason, who made 16 saves on the night. “It turns out in tonight’s game that kickstarted things and that’s a good thing.” \nShortly thereafter, Giroux made it a one-goal game after he found a loose puck in front of the Boston net and roofed it over the outstretched goalie Tuukka Rask. \nSimmonds tied it a little less than three minutes later when he beat Rask from the same spot Sam Gagner did on the Flyers’ second goal, flying down the left wing and roofing the puck over the Boston goalie. \nHad Rinaldo not been kicked out of the game, the Flyers might have been tempted to get revenge on him. Instead, they focused their efforts on putting pucks in the net, ending a lengthy losing streak against Boston. \n“I think it was better for us, the fact that he did get kicked out of the game because we were able to focus after the five-minute power play,” Simmonds said. “I think we were kind of out of sorts there. We recovered well, obviously. We’ve got to be better on our power play. Previous games we were moving the puck around well. I think tonight, besides that last 4-on-3, I don’t think we were too good on the power (play).” \nIn overtime, the power play was much better. Giroux netted the winner on a one-timer from the left circle. \n“Coming into this building, it’s always a tough atmosphere to play in,” Simmonds said. “I thought we played a good first period. Second period was, I think, horrible. Then we came back out in the third and did the job.” \nDave Isaac; (856) 486-2479; disaac@gannettnj.com . 3 CONNECT 10 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://on.cpsj.com/1RXxsRv TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T06:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T21:35:31.620+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
