Edenfield on the game’s first possession, and then found Teddy Ruben from 37 yards out to make it 21-0 after one. In the second he hit Jarvis Bentley from 13 yards out and followed that with a 14-yard strike to Bryan Holmes. His fifth TD was a 54-yard pass to Ruben. \nBrandon Burks had 10 carries for 133 yards and a touchdown for Troy (2-5, 1-2). \nLarry Rose III carried 21 times for 180 yards for New Mexico State (0-7, 0-3). \nCopyright © 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T05:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T06:39:17.238+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
