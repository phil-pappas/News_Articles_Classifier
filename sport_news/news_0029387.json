Safid Deen/Democrat \nFlorida State running back Dalvin Cook looked explosive in his return from a hamstring injury, accounting for 22 carries for 222 yards rushing and two touchdowns. He also had three catches for 47 yards and a receiving touchdown to lead the Seminoles in Doak Campbell Stadium in front of 82,329 people. \n“Dalvin Cook is one of the best pure players in college football,” Fisher said. “He had 222 yards on 22 carries and he wasn’t even supposed to play. .... That guy is something different. There’s something different in him, now.” \nKicker Roberto Aguayo converted on three of four field goals, and quarterback Everett Golson completed 25 of 33 passes for 291 yards and a touchdown to carry FSU’s offense. FSU's Roberto Aguayo, two Miami players involved in pregame tussle \nThe Seminoles (5-0, 3-0 Atlantic Coast Conference) have won 34 of their last 35 games. \nThe Hurricanes (3-2, 0-1 ACC), who came into the game ranked 126th of 127 teams in the FBS on third down, fixed their troubles converting 8 of 16 third-down plays on the Seminoles defense. \nStarting cornerback Jalen Ramsey and safety Lamarcus Brutus each missed an opportunity during the game to pick off Kaaya, playing his second game in the rivalry. Photos: FSU versus Miami fan cam \nBut with Miami’s backs against the wall on a game-deciding drive, the Seminoles defense answered the call to prevent a letdown after an impressive outing by FSU’s offense. \nCook, with about 9 minutes left in the first half, came up lame after a 35-yard run with an open field in front of him, but returned to action. His first play back was an 18-yard gain up the middle, ending with a smile from the second-year running back.

Safid Deen/Democrat \nThe Seminoles offense used several option plays to present a different look and get Golson more involved. \nHis pitch to Cook in the first quarter resulted in a 72-yard touchdown run by Cook, and it seemed like the Seminoles were off to the races. \nFSU left points on the field, with Aguayo missing his first ever kick against the Hurricanes, a 49-yard attempt as halftime came to an end. \nMiami scored twice in the second half, with Kaaya connecting on a 1-yard pass to Cook’s high school teammate, running back Joe Yearby in the third quarter. \nKaaya’s 29-yard pass to Stacy Coley gave UM its first lead of the game, 24-23 with more than 10 minutes remaining in the game.
