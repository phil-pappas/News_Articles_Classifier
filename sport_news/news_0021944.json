(Photo: AP) 20 CONNECT 4 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nPISCATAWAY Kyle Flood's general rule for policing off-field behavior is to urge Rutgers football players to make smart decisions. \nBack from a three-game suspension that prohibited him from speaking with the media since Sept. 16, Flood faced a barrage of questions Monday about decisions his players are making that have raised red flags around potential drug use and relationships with Rutgers athletics recruiting ambassadors. \n\"I take the issue of marijuana, drugs, alcohol addiction very seriously,\" Flood said. \"I think those are big issues on every college campus in the country. Do I feel that we have an issue above and beyond what our campus is or what another team has? I do not. That has not been my experience.\" \nIndividual NCAA drug test results are covered by federal privacy laws , but former walk-on fullback Lloyd Terry allegedly told police that he failed multiple drug tests and became \"addicted to weed\" before he was dismissed from the team in September. He is facing an armed robbery charge. Kyle Flood off suspension at Rutgers, starts with apology \nRutgers football has a written drug policy that stipulates counseling and up to a two-week suspension for a first violation, a minimum of a one-game suspension for a second violation and a three-game suspension for a third violation. \nMarijuana also was connected to the recent arrests of former Rutgers players Dre Boggs, Tejay Johnson and Jamil Pollard. \n\"Our program enforces the University drug policy,\" Flood said. \"That's not an issue. \n\"But I think what people need to understand is that that policy has different phases to it. That policy is about testing. That policy is about care. And we have a best-in-class care system here at Rutgers, one that any of our athletes who test positive immediately go into, and we're very proud of it. That we do everything we can to help our student-athletes with what is a very, very serious issue today with young people.\" \nFlood declined to comment on whether Terry, who played in one game last season, was suspended. \n\"Those are all personal issues with particular players and medical issues,\" Flood said, \"and issues that I can't discuss publicly.\" Kyle Flood returns at Rutgers, but B1G questions remain \nFlood could have -- but opted not to -- comment on the conditions of the reinstatement of star wide receiver Leonte Carroo , who was suspended for two games while facing a simple assault charge under domestic violence. \nThat charge was dismissed but Carroo was not reinstated until after meeting with Flood and athletic director Julie Hermann . A statement from the program at the time said Carroo \"agreed to the conditions of his reinstatement and after he accepted the responsibility that comes with his return to the team.\" \nWhat does that entail? \n\"I would keep those conditions to Leonte and Ms. Hermann and myself,\" Flood said. \"I don't think I want to discuss them publicly.\" \nCarroo's charge stemmed from his role in a Sept. 12 postgame altercation outside the Hale Center involving his girlfriend, his mother and a woman with whom he previously was romantically involved. All three females still face charges. \nAt the time, the woman worked as a recruiting ambassador for Rutgers athletics, though she no longer does. \nThat fact has raised questions about the fraternization between football players and/or recruits and the department's female employees. Kyle Flood apologizes to Rutgers community \n\"My expectation with the players when they're in the Hale Center is that at all times they conduct themselves in a professional way,\" Flood said. \"I don't begin to think that I can control the personal relationships of students with other students when they're outside of this building. It's not something that I ask them about or not something I get involved with.\" \nResponsible for showing around recruits on gameday, the ambassadors are male and female members of the student body. The program is common at athletic departments across the country, though it can create a tricky dynamic. \n\"I think we've got a good program,\" Flood said. \nAlong the same lines, Flood said he does not dictate the amount of contact between his current players and dismissed players. \nFlood has dismissed six players since Sept. 3 , including four who were charged with aggravated assault and two with robbery (Terry and Boggs). \n\"I don't have a policy per se about that,\" Flood said. \"In general when a player is dismissed from the program, they are not permitted to come back into the Hale Center. If they are still permitted on campus, which is a university decision, then we will set up their academic support in other parts of the campus so that they don't have to come into the Hale Center. \n\"In terms of trying to control the relationships of my players with current or former players, what I tell my players in general is make good decisions, help each other make good decisions, and to do that you want to be around the right people.\" \nStaff Writer Ryan Dunleavy: rdunleav@gannettnj.com 20 CONNECT 4 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://on.app.com/1RD0JRc TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T00:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T09:33:26.557+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
