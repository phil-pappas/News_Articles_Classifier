We will now take action in accordance to the directives of the court,\" Inspector Shafiqur Rahman, who was investigating the case against the paceman and his wife, said. \n\nThe court in Dhaka later remanded the cricketer in jail after denying his request for bail, his lawyer Arif Rahman said. \n\nHe surrendered to the court one day after his wife, Nritto Shahadat, was arrested on Sunday at her parents' home in Dhaka. Shahadat, who denied wrongdoing, was also taken into custody after a court denied bail. \n\nBoth face charges of assaulting a child and employing a minor. \n\nPolice raided the couple's house last month after the maid, Mahfuza Akter Happy, was found crying in a street in the capital. \n\nShe has told police and local media that the couple beat and tortured her, while television footage showed her looking frail and thin with swollen black eyes. \n\nPolice have said one of her hands had been burnt with a hot cooking paddle, while other injury marks were also found on her body.
