Oklahoma City als was ranked as the third-best team in the Western Conference and is one of the most fun teams to watch. \nGeneral managers also expect Oklahoma City to be the most improved team -- having a healthy Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook and Serge Ibaka for 82 games will help improve any team. \nOklahoma City's two main superstars also earned some praise. \nGeneral managers believe Durant will finish third in the MVP voting, is one of the best shooting guards and is the second-best small forward. They also voted Durant, tied with LeBron James, for second as the player they would want to build a franchise around. \nDurant also was voted second as the player general managers would want to take a shot with the game on the line. \nWestbrook is predicted to finish tied for fifth in the MVP voting and is considered the third-best point guard and one of the best perimeter defenders in the league. \nGeneral managers voted that Westbrook is the most athletic and the second fasted player with the ball in the NBA. They also believe he is one of the toughest players. \nIbaka is considered one of the best defensive, interior defensive and role players in the game. \nAnthony Morrow made an appearance on the survey, considered to be the fourth-best pure shooter. \nBilly Donovan was voted second as a new or relocated coach who will make the biggest impact on a team. \nThunder fans earned some recognition, too. Oklahoma City was voted to have the second-best home-court advantage. \nYou can read the full results on NBA.com . Tweet \nCopyright 2015 by KOCO.com All rights reserved.
