I want to finish tomorrow and win some matches again. \n\"I think it comes too late, to come after 15 years is too late, but it's something that is helping me to be better, a great negative experience.\" \nMourinho insists it is not the most challenging period, but the worst in terms of results. \nHe said: \"I had a big challenge all the time. It's the worst results. I've never lost so many matches. That's a fact.\" \nThe challenge began on the opening day of Chelsea's title defence, a 2-2 draw with Swansea on August 8, the repercussions of which continue. \nMourinho criticised first-team doctor Eva Carneiro and head physio Jon Fearn for going on to the field to treat Eden Hazard. \nAnd Mourinho was cleared by the Football Association on Wednesday of making discriminatory comments towards Carneiro. \nFA chairman Greg Dyke has told officials that Mourinho committed \"a failure of his personal judgement and public behaviour\" in his criticism of Carneiro, while independent board member Heather Rabbatts launched a stinging attack on the FA for its \"seriously disappointing\" handling of the case. \nMourinho refused to respond on Friday, saying his comments will come in time. \n\"For the past two months I didn't open my mouth and I'm going to keep it like this. One day I will speak and I will choose a day,\" Mourinho said. \n\"I'm quiet about it for a long time. I read and I listen and I watch and I'm quiet. \n\"I'm telling you, we can be here all day. My time to speak will arrive when I decide.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T15:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T17:36:33.180+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
