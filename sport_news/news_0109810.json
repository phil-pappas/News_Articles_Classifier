Happiness is a function of expectation.\nThe higher your expectations, the harder they are to satisfy. No one expected the Cubs to win as many games as they did during the regular season. Their defiance of expectation was part of what made their fans so giddy. It's why even though the ending of the fairy tale was sad, many fans went away happy.\n2. Hope is not the same as expectation.\nWrigley Illustrated: After the season ends, the fans remain Nausheen Husain and Rick Tuma As the Cubs and October baseball surprised Chicago, we set out to meet the long-suffering fans and capture the historic time at the friendly confines. We met an 80-year-old woman in Cubs pajamas who holds season tickets and is the only Cubs fan in her entire extended family. Everyone else roots... As the Cubs and October baseball surprised Chicago, we set out to meet the long-suffering fans and capture the historic time at the friendly confines. We met an 80-year-old woman in Cubs pajamas who holds season tickets and is the only Cubs fan in her entire extended family. Everyone else roots... (Nausheen Husain and Rick Tuma) Expectation is a form of demand: This had better happen, or else. Hope is a desire: It would sure be nice if this happened.\nCubs fans hoped the team would make it all the way. Wise fans knew better than to expect it.\n3. Surprise is often a key ingredient of pleasure.\nSurprise fueled the thrill of the Cubs' season.\n4. Surprise, by its nature, never lasts.\nNext year — when their success won't be new, when hope has hardened into expectation — the Cubs will have to do even better to supply the same amount of pleasure.\n5. A story is more than its ending.\nA baseball season is a story. Beginning, middle, end. Characters and dramatic twists. More than anything, the audience wants to be engaged, and by that measure the Cubs gave us a great story.\nAs Romeo and Juliet could testify, some of the world's best stories don't have happy endings.\n6. You can be disappointed that you lost but still glad you played.\nIf Cubs ever win it all, they would lose their essential nature Bernie Lincicome Not to beat a dead Cub, but …\nThe Cubs do not need autopsies. Inquests are for serious sins. The Cubs are what they are. No fingers need to be pointed, though a couple of Cubs outfielders might use a few more. I once accused the Cubs of choking, but that was early on and I didn't understand.\nI...\nNot to beat a dead Cub, but …\nThe Cubs do not need autopsies. Inquests are for serious sins. The Cubs are what they are. No fingers need to be pointed, though a couple of Cubs outfielders might use a few more. I once accused the Cubs of choking, but that was early on and I didn't understand.\nI...\n(Bernie Lincicome) Or, to put it the cliche way, it's better to have played and lost than never played at all.\n7. Play is good for work.\nOr, as Cubs manager Joe Maddon famously put it, \"Don't ever permit the pressure to exceed the pleasure.\" This team had fun, which made them more fun for the rest of us.\n8. A good boss makes the workers believe not only in themselves but in each other.\nSee \"Maddon\" above.\n9. Clothes may not make the man, but a good pair of glasses never hurts.\nSee \"Maddon\" above.\n10. Work is an investment in success; it doesn't always pay dividends right away.\nAs Cubs first baseman Anthony Rizzo put it a few days ago, \"We set a tone for how we are going to be for a long time.\"\n11. The successful person is sometimes the person whose greatest skill is a good attitude.\nIn August, the Cubs benched shortstop Starlin Castro, but when the season was over, Epstein praised him:\n\"Of all the players we can be proud of, he might be the one most deserving of that praise because of everything he went through off the field.\"\n12. You can be brilliant and still not be the best.\nOr to put it another way:\n13. No matter how good you are there's usually someone better.\nThe Mets will soon find out.\n14. Even the superhuman turn out to be human.\nBut you were great, Jake Arrieta.\n15. Young people can be shockingly good and better than their experienced elders.\nThe Cubs gave \"rookie\" a good name.\n16. In the face of youthful brilliance, experience may still win.\n17. Gracious losers are winners.\nThe Cubs closed out the season with class, which helped their fans to do the same. Gracious losers, btw, aren't the same as lovable losers.\n18. One of the best ways to cure disappointment is to find lessons in it.\nSee above.\n19. Baseball may be like life, but it's not all there is to life.\nSeriously, people. Get a grip.\n20. There really is always next year.\nAt least in baseball.\nmschmich@tribpub.com\nTwitter @MarySchmich\n Chicago Cubs Joe Maddon National League Championship Series New York Mets", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-56293bca/turbine/ct-graphics-wrigley-illustrated-the-fans-remain-20151022", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-562a86ee/turbine/ct-lincicome-cubs-world-series-spt-1025-20151024", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-562ad0f2/turbine/ct-cubs-lessons-schmich-met-20151023"], "published": "2015-10-24T03:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T15:32:27.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
