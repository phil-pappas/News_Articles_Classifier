(Richard Skinner) -- The Bengals overcame a very sluggish start both offensively and defensively with a strong offensive performance and a good enough defensive performance to move to 6-0 for just the third time in franchise history. \nThe Bengals scored on five straight full possessions from the second quarter until early in the fourth quarter to rally from an early 7-0 deficit and beat the Buffalo Bills, 34-21, on Sunday before a crowd of 69,593 in Ralph Wilson Stadium. \nQuarterback Andy Dalton completed 22 of 33 passes for 243 yards, three touchdowns and no interceptions finished with a passer rating of 118.6, marking the fifth time this season he had a rating of 115.9 or higher. In the second half, he was 14 of 19 for 165 and two touchdowns. \nThe Bengals opened the second half by going on two long scoring drives to pull away from a 17-14 halftime lead and take a commanding 31-14 lead through three quarters. \nThe first drive covered 90 yards in seven plays and capped it with a 10-yard touchdown pass from Dalton to Marvin Jones. Dalton was 5 of 6 for 82 yards on the drive and Jones had four receptions for 66 yards, including a spectacular over-the-shoulder catch between two defenders deep down the middle of the field for 42 yards. Jones had a career-high nine receptions for 95 yards. \nThe second drive covered 78 yards and was capped by a three-yard Dalton to Tyler Eifert touchdown with 1:42 left in the third quarter. \nThey pulled ahead 34-14 on Mike Nugent's 39-yard field goal with 10:40 left to play in the game. \nBuffalo made it 34-21 with a lengthy drive after Nugent's field goal that was capped by a three-yard touchdown run by LeSean McCoy, who tallied 90 yards rushing on 17 carries. \nThings looked dicey at the start as Buffalo marched 80 yards in 11 plays on the opening possession of the game to take a 7-0 lead on quarterback E.. Manuel's two-yard TD run. Manuel started in place of injured quarterback Tyrod Taylor, who was placed on the inactive list prior to the game due to a sprained MCL he suffered in the Bills game last Sunday at Tennessee. \nManuel finished 28 of 42 for 263 yards one touchdown and one interception. \nThe Bengals rallied from that early 7-0 deficit to take as much as a 17-7 first-half lead before Buffalo pulled to within 17-14 at halftime. \nThe Bengals were able to build that lead thanks to the defense holding the Bills without a first down on the four series after their opening-game touchdown drive and taking enough advantage of great field position. \nOn their second drive of the game the Bengals drove 49 yards in seven plays with Dalton hitting running back Jeremy Hill with a 13-yard touchdown pass. Dalton dumped a pass short to Hill in the left flat, and then Hill escaped a tackle on the left sideline, barely stayed inbound and them somersaulted into the end zone. \nThe Bengals then drove 55 yards on their first full possession of the second quarter and went ahead 14-7 when Giovani Bernard raced into the end zone from 17 yards out. Dalton changed the play at the line of scrimmage and Bernard scooted while barely being touched. Bernard also had a 23-yard catch-and-run on the second play off the drive. \nAfter the Bengals forced the Bills to go three-and-out on their next possession they got the ball at the Buffalo 36 following a penalty on the punt return, but had to settle for a 47-yard Mike Nugent field goal to go up 17-7 with 7:12 left in the first half. \nBuffalo then used all but the final 17 seconds of the half to drive 86 yards in 14 plays and pull within 17-14 when Manuel hit Sammy Watkins from 22 yards out for the touchdown. Watkins got hurt on the play and didn't return. \nThe Bills outgained the Bengals in the first half 196-121 with 166 of their yards coming on the opening drive and final drive of the half. Manuel completed 15 of 20 passes for 129 yards and was intercepted once. McCoy ran for 61 yards on 11 carries. \nDalton was 8 of 14 for 78 yards and a touchdown in the first half, while the Bengals tallied 43 yards rushing. \nJeremy Hill and Giovani Beranrd combined to rush for 106 yards on 24 carries. Hill had 56 yards on 16 carries and Bernard had 50 yards on eight carries. The Bills had allowed only one of their first five opponents to rush for 100 yards or more. \nNOTEWORTHY: Defensive end Michael Johnson suffered a leg injury in the fourth quarter, but there was no official word on what the injury was.
