The comeback bid fell short when senior kicker Nick Rose missed the game-tying extra point. The Golden Bears held on to win, 45-44.\nDespite losing, Heard had a historic night as he ran for 163 yards and three touchdowns and passed for 364 more. His 527 yards of total offense is a school record.\nHere's how the nation reacted to Jerrod Heard's performance and Texas' heartbreaking loss.\nCedric Golden, Austin American-Statesman: \"Jerrod Heard gets what it means to be a big-time quarterback. He isn't there yet, but count me as one who can't wait to see him grow up at the position. The clutch gene isn't given to all, but the kid has it from top to bottom, from the retro high-top fade reminiscent of Kid from Kid 'n Play fame down to the sweetest feet in Austin.\"\nPete Thamel, Sports Illustrated\nTexas scores to supposedly tie the game on a beautiful QB draw. And just missed the extra point. Wow. You never see that in that situation.\n— Pete Thamel (@SIPeteThamel) September 20, 2015 Heather Dinich, ESPN: \"PASS: Texas QB Jerrod Heard. No, the Longhorns aren't playoff contenders, but let's give Texas a pat on the back after what's been an abysmal start to the season. Heard set a school record with 527 total yards of offense and his third rushing touchdown brought Texas within a point with 1:11 left against Cal. A missed extra point has punctuated the season so far.\"\nStewart Mandel, Sports Illustrated\nTexas lost in excruciating fashion, but Jerrod Heard still had 527 yards of offense. Texas has come a long way in 2 weeks.\n— Stewart Mandel (@slmandel) September 20, 2015 Skip Bayless, ESPN\nOnce again a kicker who isn't really a football player costs his team (Texas) a game after it battles its guts out.
