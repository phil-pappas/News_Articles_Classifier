The decision was taken after the Ladakh Affairs Department, which is responsible for holding the elections to the Ladakh Affairs and Hill Development Council (LAHDC), Leh, and LAHDC, Kargil, after every five years, got no confirmation from the Civil Aviation Department vis-à-vis request for air sorties to airlift the polling staff. The Ladakh Affairs Department is held by Chief Minister Mufti Mohammad Sayeed. “The voting of the polling staff shall be arranged soon because the dispatch of polling staff is advanced due to non-availability of air sorties for the far-flung polling stations,” said District Election Officer Rakesh Sharma, who is also the Additional Deputy Commissioner, in an official order. He directed the staff on poll duty to send an application for issuance of ballot paper in order to enable them to cast their votes, if they wish, tomorrow from 10 am to 4 pm at Government Degree College, Leh. The elections are scheduled for October 17 and the counting of votes will take place on October 23. The polling staff and security personnel to seven polling stations —- Skumpata, Lingshet, Depling, Neraks, Youlchang, Merak and Fotoskar —- located in inaccessible and snowbound areas of the region, were to be airlifted on October 14 —- four days ahead of the polling —- so that they could reach the polling stations in time. However, non-availability of air sorties has forced the administration to advance their departure from the district headquarters. After airdropping them at a particular place, the polling parties would have had to trek for 5 to 7 hours before they could reach the polling stations in the far-flung villages. It has already appeared in these columns that conducting the Leh council polls has turned out to be a Herculean task for the administration due to weather vagaries and tough geographical terrains. Deputy Commissioner, Leh, Prasanna Ramaswamy G, who is also the election authority, said they had requested the Divisional Commissioner, Kashmir, and the Ladakh Affairs Department for air sorties to airlift the polling staff to the far-flung and inaccessible areas. “So far, we have received no confirmation from the authorities, forcing us to direct the polling staff to get ready for their early departure from the district headquarters. We will wait till October 13 and if we get no confirmation till noon that day, the polling parties will be dispatched via the road,” said the Leh Deputy Commissioner. He admitted that it would not be an easy task for the polling staff to reach their respective destinations in the far-flung areas. Tsering Maroop, secretary, Ladakh Affairs Department, said they had taken up the matter (availability of air sorties) with the Civil Aviation Department, but had received no confirmation so far. “We have directed the Deputy Commissioner, Leh, who is also the election authority, to remain prepared and dispatch the polling staff in advance (to the polling stations in the far-flung areas) due to non-availability of air sorties,” he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T00:16:38.369+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
