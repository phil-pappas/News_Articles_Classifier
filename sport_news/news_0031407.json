(AP Photo/Charlie Riedel) By Matt Galloway matthew.galloway@cjonline.com \nKANSAS CITY, Mo. — Two hours before Johnny Cueto delivered the first pitch of arguably the biggest start of his career, he boarded the wrong elevator. \nCueto, still in his street clothes and en route to the Royals’ clubhouse, realized his mistake soon after the doors shut on the elevator going in the opposite direction — up, toward the media levels. \n“Oh, (crap),” Cueto blurted out — in English — before dashing off at the next floor and scampering to the stairwell. \nIt was an appropriate start to an up-and-down afternoon for the right-hander — all part of an up-and-down two-plus months with the Royals — and it likely wasn’t the last time he would use salty language Friday. \nThe free agent-to-be coughed up at least one run in each of his first three innings, rebounded for three scoreless frames immediately after that, then watched from the top step of the Royals dugout as his teammates rallied for a 5-4 victory over the Houston Astros in Game 2 of the AL Division Series. \nAll told, Cueto surrendered four runs in six innings, striking out five and walking three on 103 pitches. It wasn’t the dominant outing the Royals envisioned when they traded for the 5-foot-11, 221-pound hurler on July 26, but to be fair, it probably wasn’t as bad as the 40,008 fans in attendance thought it would be through Cueto’s first three innings. \nAt times, Cueto was the most popular man in the ballpark — the sellout crowd roared in approval as he did his signature shimmy while delivering the fourth pitch of the game. At other times, he was the biggest villain — the same fans booed Cueto vociferously after he surrendered a 404-foot home run to dead center off the bat of Colby Rasmus to lead off the third inning. \nBut Cueto settled down, retiring 12 of the next 14 batters. He exited the mound for the final time to a polite round of applause — an appropriate response to an uneven afternoon. \nDespite Cueto’s early struggles, Royals manager Ned Yost said he never considered pulling his starter until he actually made the switch to Kelvin Herrera to start the seventh inning. \n“When he got done I looked at (pitching coach) Dave (Eiland) and said, ‘What did you think of his outing?’” Yost said. “And Dave said, ‘He pitched good enough to win.’ And I agree with that.” \nLike Yordano Ventura a game prior, Cueto’s woes began in the first inning. He walked George Springer and with two outs gave up an RBI double off the base of the right-field wall to — who else? — Rasmus. \nCueto’s second inning didn’t go much better. He gave up a broken-bat single to Chris Carter (.199 hitter), walked Jason Castro (.211) and allowed No. 9 hitter Jake Marisnik (.236) to reach on a bizarre bunt single. Mike Moustakas appeared to have enough time to retire Marisnik at first, but Cueto gestured to third base, Moustakas turned briefly, and the speedy center fielder beat Moustakas’ throw to first. \nSix of the first 10 hitters had reached for the Astros by the time Springer fisted a single into shallow left field over a sprinting Alcides Escobar to score two and make the margin 3-0. \nMoustakas did not blame Cueto’s gesture for the botched handling of Marisnik’s bunt, shouldering the blame on his own “mental error.” Instead, he praised his starter’s poise to escape the inning having allowed only two runs. \n“That’s huge. Huge,” Moustakas said. “It was a momentum shift back to us. I was happy to see him get out of that jam and I was happy he did it.” \nOne could argue poor luck played a role in Cueto’s early struggles. Outside of Rasmus, no Houston hitter really squared anything up off of him. For his part, the man the Royals mortgaged at least part of their future for did not make excuses after the game. \n“I don’t feel any pressure at all,” Cueto said through interpreter Pedro Grifol. “I know the magnitude of the trade and I know why I was brought here, and I take a lot of pride in my stuff and in helping my club win.” \nAs for arriving to the ballpark just two hours before first pitch? Yost said it is a normal move for a veteran starter, and certainly it will not be as big of a storyline on the heels of a series-tying victory that keeps the Royals away from an elimination game. \nFor now, at least. \n“Thank God we were able to pull this one out,” Cueto said, “and now we’ve got to go to Houston and play baseball.” \nMatthew Galloway can be reached at (785) 295-1104 or matthew.galloway@cjonline.com .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T03:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T04:44:29.045+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
