Not a big enough difference to have the attention on this that it’s gotten. What I come down to is, does it really matter? Some guys like the ball a little softer. And if a guy likes a harder ball, that’s fine too. We want the quarterbacks to be as successful as they can be, and we want them to give the fans the best entertainment they can. Who cares if a quarterback likes it at 10 and a half? If that makes him play better, fine.”\nBrady said in an interview with WEEI in 2011 he preferred a deflated football, but avoided questions about his preference during the court hearing in August.\nElway’s comments come 10 months after the inception of the scandal, and six weeks before the Patriots face his Denver Broncos in primetime on Nov. 29.\nA matchup with “the bear” is looming.\nh/t— ESPNBoston.com\nBill Belichick’s not mad; this is just his RBF\nPrevious -- of -- Next Jim Davis/The Boston Globe Previous -- of -- Next John Tlumack/The Boston Globe Previous -- of -- Next Bill Greene/The Boston Globe Previous -- of -- Next Lee, Matthew J./The Boston Globe Previous -- of -- Next Tom Herde/The Boston Globe Previous -- of -- Next Advertisement Previous -- of -- Next Jonathan Wiggs/The Boston Globe Previous -- of -- Next The Boston Globe Archives Previous -- of -- Next Charles Krupa/AP Previous -- of -- Next Rick Stewart/Getty Images Previous -- of -- Next John Tlumack/The Boston Globe Previous -- of -- Next Advertisement Previous -- of -- Next Michael Dwyer/AP Previous -- of -- Next Jim Davis/The Boston Globe Previous -- of -- Next Brian Snyder/Rueters Previous -- of -- Next Jim Davis/The Boston Globe Previous -- of -- Next John Tlumack/The Boston Globe Previous -- of -- Next Advertisement Previous -- of -- Next David L.
