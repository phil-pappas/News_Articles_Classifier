We recently had the occasion to look back at Le Corbusier and his contribution. Experts who ruminated in seminars held “50 years after the master” on Corbusier underlined the importance of the vision of the architect, and the manner in which it was translated into a concrete shape, literally. The builders of modern India diverted precious national resources into creating a new home to the displaced government of Punjab, which had lost its capital, Lahore, in 1947. They brought in various institutions that have given the city its preeminent space in education and health, and its talented inhabitants themselves fleshed it out with their cultural vitality. The city has evolved much beyond its original plans, and today some of its original infrastructure is strained from the increasing inhabitants and commuters. Even though the city was designed with the automobile in mind, the number of vehicles that ply on its roads is in excess of its capacity. Better public transportation is needed, as is speedier connectivity with other cities. The challenges that the present-day town planners face are in part posed by the success of the original plan and vision of Le Corbusier. They need to be tackled in a manner that does not violate the spirit of the founding architect. An urban oasis that subsumed a number of villages in the area, Chandigarh today is considered a jewel. While some issues might be flagged by experts, it remains a fine example of how a city may evolve without violating its original character. Le Corbusier poured his heart and soul in creating a city that would serve as a symbol of modern India. It remains one, even as it throws up demographic and other challenges that will keep town planners and administrators on their toes.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T14:58:19.368+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
