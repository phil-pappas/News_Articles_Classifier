Comment By Darrell Richardson/The Oak Ridger   By Darrell Richardson/The Oak Ridger Posted Oct. 15, 2015 at 4:20 PM By Darrell Richardson/The Oak Ridger Posted Oct. 15, 2015 at 4:20 PM The game began under blustery conditions … with gusts from the north reaching an estimated 30 mph at times. By the third quarter, a steady gale had developed and the weather was playing havoc with game plans, forward passes, punts and the record book. It was “hump” night for Oak Ridge High School. After three years of exiting in the quarterfinals of the state Class AAA playoffs, coach Joe Gaddis’ Wildcats were trying to earn a trip to the next week’s semifinals by beating Franklin County at Winchester. As it turned out, Oak Ridge’s mission was accomplished on that windy night of Nov. 29, 1991, as the ’Cats whipped Franklin County 28-3 before a packed crowd of 4,500 fans at James E. Douglas Memorial Stadium. And, perhaps more than anyone else, the Rebels’ sophomore kicker Jeff Hall realized the fickle fortunes of Mother Nature. With the wind in his favor, Hall unleashed a state-record 62-yard field goal with 2:02 left in the first period. The old mark was 57 yards. “We knew he could kick it that far if he got it up, so we decided to go for it,” Franklin County coach Red Roberts said at the time. Hall leaned into the ball at the Franklin County 48-yard line and launched it high into the night. At first, it seemed as if the ball would never start going up. Then it seemed the ball would never stop going … period … as it cleared the crossbar with room to spare. In the third quarter, Hall buried the Wildcats with a 69-yard thunder punt that was downed at the Oak Ridge 8. But the weather vane turned a few minutes later. With an opportunity to back the ’Cats deep in the opening seconds of the final period, Hall thumped a mighty effort into the sky from the Oak Ridge 46. He then watched helplessly as the punt just stopped, hung for a moment, then came drifting back. It was downed at the 39-yard line — a 7-yard effort. Meanwhile, Oak Ridge’s kicking combination of Chris Huber and Brian Seals remained steady despite the adverse conditions of that November night in 1991. Huber, who had been perfect so far that season on point-after attempts, nailed two of his four into the gale; while Seals, the kickoff man, put his first kickoff of the night into the wind … and into the end zone for a touch back. “Going into the wind, we decided we were just going to throw short,” said Wildcat quarterback Mike Underwood. “Going with the wind, everything was okay.” Facing the breeze in the first and third quarters, the Wildcats hitched up the horses and plowed through Franklin County on the ground. Underwood had only two completions in three attempts in the first period — both quick outs to Antone Thrift. Page 2 of 3 - In the third quarter, the senior signal-caller didn’t even put the ball into the air. His lone touchdown toss came with the wind at his back in the final minutes of the game and once again to Thrift. Oak Ridge was content to give the ball to tailback Shawn Summers and let him do his stuff. Summers racked up 57 yards on seven tries in the first period and 47 on nine in the third. Franklin County, on the other hand, hadn’t built the 10-2 record it brought into the contest with passing heroics. The wind made trying to rally late in the game doubly tough. In the fourth quarter, the Rebels had little time, lots of ground to cover and the wind blowing bugs into their teeth. “Our passing game is not that strong,” Roberts admitted. “We got into the position of having to throw it and the wind just made it harder. We had the wind in the third quarter but couldn’t get anything out of it.” *** In celebration of Public Natural Gas Week, the Oak Ridge Utility District hosted an “appreciation breakfast” on Oct. 6 — as local commercial and residential customers enjoyed fellowship and breakfast before being entertained by Jeff Hall, kicker and captain of the University of Tennessee 1998 national championship football team, according to information shared by ORUD’s Susan Lloyd. A self-proclaimed “not a natural athlete,” Hall shared his philosophy of hard work and dedication as he made note of the 100 footballs he kicked every day growing up to the exclusion of other sports and activities. That commitment delivered the aforementioned still-standing record of the longest Tennessee high school kick of 62 yards and the Southeastern Conference all-time scoring record with 371 points. Following a lively question-and-answer session at the end of Hall’s presentation, Dave Mullins from the ADFAC board of directors educated those in attendance on Project Safe — an Aid to Distressed Families of Appalachian Counties program that offers help to low-income families facing high utility bills. “ADFAC carefully screens all potential clients and provides one-time help to those who have a genuine need for assistance,” according to an article submitted by ORUD’s Lloyd. She added that with the “high-octane energy” of Anderson County auctioneer William “Bear” Stephenson “and ensuing bidding wars,” almost $1,000 was raised from autographed footballs during ORUD’s Oct. 6 breakfast with all proceeds going to Project Safe. In ORUD’s showroom of natural gas appliances, Hall “exhibited his trademark poise and genuine interest in people as he met the guests and signed photos, jerseys and helmets,” Lloyd said. A “Vol for Life,” Hall currently is a certified financial planner with a Knoxville firm. Page 3 of 3 - Darrell Richardson can be contacted at (865) 220-5510.
