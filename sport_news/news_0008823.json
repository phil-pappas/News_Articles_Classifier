I've noticed the teams that turn out that way are usually successful.\"\nBradley, 41, was hired in February after the Oakwood school parted ways with Sarullo, who went 189-103-4 in 30 seasons. He won four championships (the last in 2000), but the Lions' last winning season was 2005 and the program had slumped to 17-34 in the last five seasons.\nBradley says he will change the program's fortunes through working-class values.\nBradley's knack for winning started in 1986 when Farrell captured the Metro Bowl Championship under Sarullo. It continued in 1991 at Ithaca College , which won the NCAA Division III title. Five years later, and with Bradley as an assistant coach, the University of Massachusetts won the Division I-AA championship.\nA year ago, Farrell went 4-6, its third consecutive losing campaign, and were thumped 34-7 by Holy Cross in a CHSFL AA consolation playoff game.\nReplacing a legend and his former high school coach could be a daunting task for Bradley. If so, he's not saying.\n\"The expectations for this program are always high. We have a bunch of hard workers and great senior leadership. So far it's been an easy transition,\" Bradley said.\nThe Lions return 12 starters, including seven on offense. Bradley has installed a multiple spread offense, utilizing one back. He'll have senior quarterbacks Paul Quadrato , who started as a sophomore but was injured last season, and incumbent Paul Barchitta .\n\"I'm looking for the best decision-maker (at quarterback),\" Bradley said.\nDefensively, expect an aggressive 4-3 alignment.\nFarrell's first four games are a tough test, beginning with Saturday's opener against St. Joseph's Collegiate of Buffalo. The first assignment will be to stop Clemson-bound quarterback Chad Kelly , whose uncle Jim was a Hall of Fame signal-caller for the Buffalo Bills . That's followed by a murderer's row of CHSFL teams: St. Anthony's, Iona Prep and St. Joseph by-the-Sea.\n\"That's a very challenging schedule but it's always one game at a time,\" said Bradley, who practices law in New Jersey . \"Two of those teams play unique offenses, presenting more challenges.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T12:28:53.134+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
