But being undefeated (12-0-2) in league games left some dissatisfaction after allowing a goal less than one minute following its first-half goal.\n\"We really wanted to win this game. And whenever we get up ahead...it seems like within the next five minutes (any opponent) come back and score,\" said Meghan Cavanaugh , who scored her third goal for Shen this week about 10 minutes in. \"It really gets to us, because the fact we scored — we're all amped. I don't know why then we break down.\"\nSaratoga broke Shen down in style: Standout YaYa Van Ness took the ball, drew a lot of attention and set up freshman Julia DiMenna — a wild card for Saratoga moving forward. She blasted a pinpoint shot that even her opponents praised afterward.\n\"Definitely, we took advantage,\" Van Ness said. \"I think they were more comfortable after they got the goal.\"\nSaratoga (9-3-2 in league games) will be an interesting dark horse when it comes to sectionals which start next week. Van Ness has flash and speed that is virtually incomparable. And, like last year, the Blue Streaks are starting to get rolling at the right time.\n\"I don't know what it is, but it's been like this the past few years,\" coach Adrienne Dannehy said. \"But the girls are playing good and they're confident right now. The last few weeks have helped us.\"\nShen goalie Jill Shippee , like Cavanaugh, expressed frustration with allowing the tie. The Plainsmen won an emotional, physical game Tuesday against Niskayuna which virtually locked up the Suburban title — meaning a tie or a win would make it outright.\nBut there have been three recent games Shippee pointed out when Shen has scored, then given up a counter goal fast.\n\"Everyone kind of settles in, relaxes,\" she said. \"That's tough.\"\nShen hardly celebrated the title afterward. The celebrating ended after Cavanaugh scored on a fine setup from Kendra Harbinger.\n\"I tracked the flight of the ball well,\" Cavanaugh said. \"I figured I just have to get a body part on it. Doesn't have to be pretty.\"\nBoth teams had a handful of opportunities afterward. Saratoga forced Shippee to make 14 saves. Shen's Julia McDonald had six.\nJason Franchuk is a freelance writer.", "external_links": ["http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/44/11/8798788/5/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/44/11/8798791/5/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://timesunion.mycapture.com/mycapture/remoteimage.asp?backtext=Back%20to%20Times%20Union&image=http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/44/11/8798786/5/628x471.jpg", "http://timesunion.mycapture.com/mycapture/remoteimage.asp?backtext=Back%20to%20Times%20Union&image=http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/44/11/8798788/5/628x471.jpg", "http://timesunion.mycapture.com/mycapture/remoteimage.asp?backtext=Back%20to%20Times%20Union&image=http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/44/11/8798789/5/628x471.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/44/11/8798789/5/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/44/11/8798787/5/920x920.jpg", "http://timesunion.mycapture.com/mycapture/remoteimage.asp?backtext=Back%20to%20Times%20Union&image=http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/44/11/8798790/5/628x471.jpg", "http://timesunion.mycapture.com/mycapture/remoteimage.asp?backtext=Back%20to%20Times%20Union&image=http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/44/11/8798792/5/628x471.jpg", "http://timesunion.mycapture.com/mycapture/remoteimage.asp?backtext=Back%20to%20Times%20Union&image=http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/44/11/8798791/5/628x471.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/44/11/8798792/5/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/44/11/8798786/5/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/44/11/8798790/5/920x920.jpg", "http://timesunion.mycapture.com/mycapture/remoteimage.asp?backtext=Back%20to%20Times%20Union&image=http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/44/11/8798787/5/628x471.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/44/11/8798792/5/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/44/11/8798787/5/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/44/11/8798791/5/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/44/11/8798789/5/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/44/11/8798790/5/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/44/11/8798786/5/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/44/11/8798788/5/square_gallery_thumb.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-16T07:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T14:55:32.834+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
