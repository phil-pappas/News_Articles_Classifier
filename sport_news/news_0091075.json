Photograph by: Alex Gallardo , AP \nLOS ANGELES – And on the seventh day, the Vancouver Canucks won again. \nAll you need to know about the first seven days of the Canucks’ National Hockey League season is this: Tuesday’s 3-0 win against the Los Angeles Kings moved them seven points clear of the two-time Stanley Cup winners. \nThe Canucks are 3-0-1, the Kings 0-3-0. That’s a pretty good head start, especially since Vancouver’s other opening-week wins also were against Pacific Division rivals, the Anaheim Ducks and Calgary Flames. \nPlaying less than 24 hours after beating the Ducks 2-1 in a shootout in Orange County, the Canucks outskated and outplayed the struggling Kings, who have been outscored 12-2 in their three losses, all at the Staples Center. \nLos Angeles hadn’t played since Friday, but could barely keep up to Vancouver in the decisive second period. \nCanuck goalie Ryan Miller continued his brilliant start to the season with a 15-save shutout. \n“I think a lot of people didn’t think we’d have the start that we’re having, but it doesn’t really matter what people think outside our locker room,” winger Derek Dorsett said after scoring into an empty net. “We all believe in here that we can be a good team and we’re showing it right now. We’re getting big performances from a lot of different guys. We just have to keep it going.” \nThe Canucks are 3-0 on the road and have already beaten half of the other teams in their division. \n“You hope,” Miller said of the strong start. “But you look at the schedule and you see some tough games. You know it’s going to be a battle and you hope, as a group, you enter into that battle. You saw what the last two nights could bring; we played the right kind of hockey and it worked out for us. We put ourselves in that position and got rewarded.” \nThe Canucks opened up a tight game by scoring twice in the second period, but could have doubled their goal total with sharper execution. Vancouver dominated the Kings in the period, outskating them, outshooting them 14-4 and building momentum with a series of Los Angeles penalties. \nWith only six goals in parts of five previous NHL seasons, Adam Cracknell made it two goals in two nights by opening scoring at 5:13 of the second period. The fourth-liner’s one-timer from a terrific centring pass by Brandon Prust rattled through the pads of Kings’ goalie Jonathan Quick. Alex Edler’s screened 60-foot bomb went post-and-in to make it 2-0 at 13:23. \n“I think we’re just doing a lot of right things right now to score goals,” Cracknell said, already only one goal away from equaling his best NHL season. “We’re going to net hard and everyone’s going there. From the start, we believed we were a good team. To come down here and play Anaheim and L.A. very well, strong teams, we needed everybody and that’s what we got the last two games.” \nEven when bestowed three straight power plays in the first half of the third period, the Kings didn’t look threatening. The only score was Dorsett’s empty-netter.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T08:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T08:59:41.843+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
