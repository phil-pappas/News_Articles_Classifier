On Saturday, UVM snapped Hartford's 16-game home unbeaten streak with a 2-1 win. UMBC falls to 7-3-2 overall and suffers its first league loss of the season (1-1-1 AE).\nAfter a scoreless first half where shots were even at five for each team, Wright scored four minutes into the start of the second half. He collected a pass from teammate Charlie DeFeo in the run of play in the penalty area and touched it past UMBC goalkeeper Billy Heavner. It was Wright's team-leading seventh goal of the season.\nIn the 69th minute Wright carried the ball along the endline and sent a short pass across the front of the goal to Stefan Lamanna. Lamanna buried a shot with a one-time finish to put Vermont up 2-0.\nThe Catamounts closed out the scoring in the 82nd minute. Wright beat his defender and slid the ball across the front of the goal again to Jackson Dayton who finished off the play with a one-time touch.\nGreg Walton was credited with three saves to pick up the shutout victory in the Vermont net, while Heavner made six stops in the UMBC net.\nVermont continues America East play on Long Island. The Catamounts take on Stony Brook at 1 p.m. on Sunday.\nCourtesy: UVM Athletic Department", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T21:26:53.656+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
