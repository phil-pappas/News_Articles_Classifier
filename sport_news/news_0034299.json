He had a chance against America and fluffed that one, so hopefully he doesn't fluff the one on the weekend,” Burger told reporters on Friday. \n\"If it happens in the game, I don’t think we’ll be thinking of the record, we’ll be thinking we’ve scored against the All Blacks.\" \nHabana, who made his test debut in 2004 and is playing in his third World Cup, has 64 test tries to his name, the same as Australian David Campese with only Japan's Daisuke Ohata having more with 69. \nBurger said the Springbok poacher was likely to get at least one opportunity to reach a World Cup landmark on Saturday. \n\"Sure there will be opportunities, there always are when we play the All Blacks, so hope we can create something special for Bryan,\" Burger said. \n\"He has got the ability to score that 20 percent try, the one that comes out of nowhere, and he is due one so hope he scores one for us.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T15:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T15:56:18.186+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
