The decision came after Fifa's ethics committee slapped Thai FA president Worawi Makudi with a 90-day ban on all football-related activities on Monday. \"We had discussions with Fifa official James Johnson and other relevant parties yesterday. We reached an agreement to call off the upcoming election,\" said FA lawyer Narinpong Jinapak. \"But, Mr Johnson said we needed to pass a resolution to cancel the vote before forwarding it to Fifa and other agencies overseeing the election, which include the Sports Authority of Thailand.\" Narinpong said Fifa preferred that Saturday's vote be deferred in order to ensure fairness for everyone involved. \"We will send the resolution to Fifa and they will then set up an emergency committee to look into the case before setting a new date for the vote. \"They wanted the election to be postponed in order to make sure that the vote would be conducted fairly for everyone. They insisted the cancellation did not signal that anyone was guilty or had committed wrongdoing.\" Fifa bans S African official Fifa yesterday banned former top South African official Lindile Kika for six years for his role in a major match-fixing scandal with Asian betting syndicates before South Africa hosted the 2010 World Cup. Kika, the former South Africa Football Association director of national teams, was one of five officials named in a Fifa report on match-fixing. Meanwhile, the crowd disturbances ahead of Lithuania and England's Euro 2016 qualifier has led to Uefa charges against both countries. Reports said that some England fans managed to buy tickets reserved for the home supporters in Vilnius and that fighting broke out as punches were traded by rival factions ahead of the game. A police cordon had to be formed between the two sets of fans to maintain calm. 29 Viewed", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T03:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T04:19:27.659+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
