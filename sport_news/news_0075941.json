They find themselves at .500 at the latest point in the season since 2007, which also happens to be the last time the Blue Devils finished with a winning record. \nHappy days, indeed. \n\"It's been a long process,\" said coach Charlie Trentacosti. \"Everybody has had to learn to play together.\" \nThat process has been made easier by the continued development of senior tailback/linebacker Josh Paez. He's been one of North Jersey's most effective players — on both sides of the ball, during the streak — and is starting to pile up numbers that people notice. \nIn six games, Paez has carried 137 times for 1,161 yards and 11 touchdowns. He's lost only one fumble and passed for a two-point conversion four times. \nPaez also has been a leader on a defense that has allowed only 14 points and posted two shutouts in the last three games. He's tops on the Blue Devils with 65 tackles. \n\"He's a special young man,\" Trentacosti said. \"I keep saying he's an All-County player. He's working with every ounce of who he is to make this thing happen.\" \nTrentacosti also is high on sophomore Mike Giancaspro, who is doing a nice job at free safety and making big strides in his first season as a quarterback. Junior linebacker Greg Carmona has been a nice complement to Paez on defense, and senior running back Tony Parisi has impressed with his blocking skills. \nTrentacosti introduced a fourth freshman to the starting lineup in last week's 32-0 win over Bogota. He has 28 freshmen in the program; a very good number and sign that the rebuilding effort is starting to get some traction. \nThe Blue Devils have a big hill to climb in the North 1, Group 1 playoff chase, but they can make things interesting over the next two weeks with Queen of Peace (2-4) and Weehawken (4-2) on deck. \n\"We've still got a lot of work to do,\" Trentacosti said. \"There's a lot of [power] points to be had with these next two games, so we'll see what happens.\" © 2015 North Jersey Media Group Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T08:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T00:29:34.261+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
