His previous longest ban had been a 21-game suspension — initially 25 games — for a high hit on Chicago's Marian Hossa in the first round of the playoffs in 2012 when he played for Arizona. \nTorres was suspended for the final six games of the playoffs in 2013 with San Jose for a hit to the head against Los Angeles' Jarret Stoll. Torres was also suspended for two games in January 2012 and April 2011 for hits. \nAll content copyright ©2015 Pendleton Times-Post, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T01:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T01:47:57.519+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
