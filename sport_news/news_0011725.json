In the second set I felt could have won all of the games. \n\"I'm very happy with the performance and it's good to conserve some energy before (Saturday).\" \nBerdych, who is coached by Murray's former right-hand man Dani Vallverdu, held serve in the opening game of the match but from there the Scot took over. \nA forehand wide from Berdych gave Murray his first break of serve for 2-1, and the Scot then came through a test when he confidently saved two break points. \nHe made it three breaks and six games in a row to take the opening set, with Murray's clean hitting and accuracy from the baseline simply too much for Berdych to handle. \nIt was not until he was 3-0 down in the second set that Berdych finally stopped the rot after losing nine games in a row. \nBut Murray was not about to allow a shift in momentum and served out the victory after an hour and 19 minutes. \nDjokovic has not lost a set since the US Open final, winning the title in Beijing last week and moving smoothly into the last four in Shanghai. \nMurray trails the world number one 19-9 in their head-to-head but ended an eight-match losing run in their last meeting in Canada in August. \n\"It will be an extremely tough match,\" Murray said. \"Novak has played great tennis all year but especially the last couple of weeks. We've played some great matches before in Masters series.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T17:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T20:07:35.189+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
