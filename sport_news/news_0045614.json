Toronto ended the regular season at 93-69, a 10-game improvement over last season. \nJoey Butler homered twice and had six RBIs for Rays. \nTampa Bay's first run off Buehrle scored when first baseman Edwin Encarnacion dropped Steven Souza Jr's soft liner for the Blue Jays' second error in a span of five batters. \nTim Beckham drew a two-out bases-loaded walk and Butler hit a grand slam on an 85 mph offering - the fastest of Buehrle's 45 pitches - to make it 6-0. The slam came after a close call by plate umpire Alfonso Marquez went against Buehrle on a 2-2 pitch. \nManager John Gibbons took Buehrle out after Brandon Guyer's RBI single. \nMikie Mahtook completed the Rays' nine-run first with a two-run homer off Ryan Tepera. Butler had a two-run shot during a three-run fifth. \nColabello hit a solo drive in the fourth, and Barney had a two-run ninth-inning drive. \nMatt Moore (3-4) gave up one run and four hits over six innings for the Rays, who went 80-82 under first-year manager Kevin Cash. Tampa Bay was 77-85 last year with current Chicago Cubs manager Joe Maddon. \nThe Rays finished with an MLB-low home attendance of 1,247,668 after drawing 15,815 on Sunday. Tampa Bay drew 1,446,464 last season. \nTRAINER'S ROOM \nBlue Jays: SS Troy Tulowitzki doubled in three at-bats during his second game after missing three weeks due to a cracked scapula and upper back bruises. He went 2 for 5 Friday. \nRays: CF Kevin Kiermaier didn't start due to back tightness. \nUP NEXT \nBlue Jays: Toronto work out at home Tuesday night and Wednesday. \nRays: Tampa Bay opens the 2016 season at home against Toronto on April 4.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T06:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T06:34:35.597+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
