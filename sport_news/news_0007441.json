It was really hard to do.\" \nHmm. Bowles' logic here doesn't seem to add up. \nThe Patriots led, 23-20, when they got the ball back at their own 32 with 5:32 remaining. The Patriots, who ran their running backs just five times all day, quickly completed three straight passes to advance to the Jets' 44, at which point fewer than four minutes remained. \nThe Jets had all three of their timeouts. Bowles used none of them. \n\"That's above my pay grade,\" Jets quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick said. \"We're out there to play, and those are all coach's decisions. We're standing behind him 100 percent with that.\" \nOn first-and-10 from the 44, Brady completed a quick pass to Julian Edelman for an eight-yard gain. Still, the clock turned. \n\"It was second-and-2,\" Bowles said. \"They had just got a first down. You can't call a timeout on a first down, and if we got them at about [second and] four or three or [more], we would have called the timeout. But at second-and-2, had they got the first down, we'd have wasted one then.\" \nBowles basically said he didn't want to call time as long as the Pats had a short-yardage situation, and that he was waiting for the defense to make a stop before doing so. But Bowles has one of the league's top defenses . He couldn't simply have faith they'd get a stop if he called time? \nAnd isn't the object to, you know, stop the clock , rather than bank on momentum or whatever? \nAfter the Edelman completion, the clock went from 3:34 to 2:52. The Patriots ran running back James White for three yards and a first down at the 33. According to Bowles, he couldn't take a timeout then, because it was first down. So the clock churned to 2:17 before the Pats ran another play. PLUS: How did Darrelle Revis' return to Foxborough go? \nIn Week 3 against the Eagles, trailing by 10, Bowles used all three timeouts in succession after the Eagles ran three straight running plays—a loss of one, a gain of six, and a loss of three—before punting it back to the Jets 26 seconds after their possession began. But, to follow Bowles' logic from Sunday, that loss on first down dictated his decision to start burning timeouts. \nBack to Sunday. Following the White run, the Patriots nearly bailed Bowles out with two straight incompletions that stopped the clock. But on third-and-10, the Jets blitzed the house, and Amendola caught an 11-yard pass for a first down at the 22 at the two-minute warning. \nAmendola then caught a 7-yard pass to the 15—making it second-and-3—and still the clock ran, and still the Jets had all of their timeouts. By the time tight end Rob Gronkowski caught a 15-yard touchdown pass on the play after that to make it 30-20, just 1:13 remained—and still the Jets still all three of their timeouts. \nThe Jets were able to drive 43 yards in 55 seconds to kick a field goal for the final margin because they had those timeouts, but at that point, their chances to win were slim to none. \nDom Cosentino may be reached at dcosentino@njadvancemedia.com .
