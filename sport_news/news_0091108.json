Pakistan had resumed on 282-4 with Misbah and Asad Shafiq seeking to extend their unbeaten partnership of 104 but the skipper (102) fell leg before wicket to Stuart Broad, bringing Safraz Ahmed to the crease. The pair put on 52 from 93 balls before Safraz (32) was caught at mid-on via Moeen Ali's off-spin. Pakistan's tail-end sought to score quickly and that cost the hosts the wickets of Wahab Riaz (6), Yasir Shah (16) and Zulfiqar Babar (3). Shafiq (83) was last to go, Joe Root catching at short mid-wicket off Mark Wood. The series is tied after a draw in the first test in Abu Dhabi last week. Sharjah will stage the concluding test from Nov. 1.  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T14:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T16:14:26.199+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
