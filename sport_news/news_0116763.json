With an undefeated record coming into the contest, Brethren Christian had the right to believe, and they put the Tartans through quite the scare. \nGeorge Krantz’s quarterback sneak with 7:17 left proved decisive, as St. Margaret’s outlasted Brethren Christian, 34-31, at Ocean View High. \nThe game featured eight lead changes, keeping both sidelines and the fans on edge. \nKrantz threw for 316 yards and three touchdowns to lead the Tartans (7-1, 2-0). Nick Shanks had 215 receiving yards and a touchdown, and Auston Locke had a pair receiving scores. \nJordan Leonard was electric for Brethren Christian. The junior running back ran for 254 yards (168 in the first half) to spark the Warriors (7-1, 0-1). \nBrethren Christian appeared to be dealt a fatal blow in the third quarter when Leonard left with an injury. The Warriors were trailing 27-24 when the 5-foot-7 spark plug left, but the next play from scrimmage proved they had plenty of life. \nJoshua Gorrell beat the Tartans’ defense over the top, and Joey Gutierrez hit him in stride to give the Warriors a 31-27 edge with 3:01 left in the third quarter. \nKrantz’s goal-line score forced the Warriors to come up with a stop. With Brethren Christian out of timeouts and two minutes remaining, St. Margaret’s elected to go for a fourth-and-4 from midfield to end the game. Cole Miller made the tackle on Nick Krantz in the open field to give the Warriors hope. \nWith the clock winding down, Gutierrez heaved the ball toward the end zone. Koa Todd intercepted the pass to give the Tartans the win.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T07:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T08:20:01.940+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
