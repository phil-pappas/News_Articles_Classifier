LOS ANGELES – There comes a time when a manager finishes talking to his players, roars past the last of the questions from the media and has crunched as many numbers as his neural processors will allow. That threshold is usually crossed in the final 24 hours before the biggest game of his life, which in Terry Collins’ case was the opener of the NL Division Series.\nMuch has been made of Collins’ evolution from his days with the Angels and Astros, back in the ’90s when he was an uptight, forever-irritated leader who lost the clubhouse in both instances. These days, Collins is looser, hipper, brutally honest but without the irascibility that nearly ended his managerial career.\nCollins spent nearly 40 years in baseball waiting for this moment – his first appearance in the postseason. Only the most oblivious could miss the surge in adrenaline.\nCollins is practically awash in adrenaline these days. At age 66, Collins said on the eve of the playoffs, “I can’t remember the last time I was tired at the ballpark. In this job, at my age, I can’t afford to be. But that’s never been a problem.”\nHe’s worked hard to raise the Mets’ level of preparedness, not to mention their self-esteem. The Mets actually consider themselves the equals of the Dodgers, and that includes in starting pitching. We’re about to see how much of that is actually fact or merely an illusion Collins has convinced the Mets is real.\nBut the Mets’ belief in this magic carpet ride is about to give way to a more meaningful metric: how intelligently Collins implements his in-game strategy, and whether he can outthink Don Mattingly throughout the series.\nCollins is no one’s idea of a latter-day Tony La Russa, but nor is helpless moving the chess pieces. In what’s expected to be a low-scoring series, each of Collins’ decisions will be closely scrutinized. He says he’s ready for the long, fierce tentacles of the second-guessers. Let’s see if Collins is telling the truth.\nHis response to life under the microscope is, in a word, trust. “That’s what any manager will tell you, that he’s trying to put his players in the best position to succeed,” Collins said one day this summer. “After that, you have to trust them. You have to have faith that you’ve made the right choices and that the players will execute.”\nThat ethos will either serve as the Mets’ division series epitaph or the road map to the NL Championship Series. The journey began Friday night in a sold-out Dodger Stadium, where the game’s strikeout champion, Clayton Kershaw, took a deep breath, exhaled slowly and went to work on leadoff hitter Curtis Granderson.\nSo much of Collins’ confidence in his team’s chances rests in the belief that his left-handed hitters – Granderson, Daniel Murphy, Lucas Duda – could somehow crack the code on Kershaw’s curveball, his signature pitch.\nThe Mets’ lefties actually had success against southpaw starters this year, posting a .307 average with balls in play – better than they did against righties. Then again, Kershaw isn’t your typical lefty and the key question is whether the Mets could somehow puncture that wall of invincibility.\nSo much was riding on those lefty-lefty matchups. Granderson knew he had a chance to set the tone in the first inning, swinging at Kershaw’s first pitch. He didn’t wait. He didn’t work the count or take stock of the spin rate of Kershaw’s curveball. Instead, Granderson attacked – he sent an angry line drive to right field, forcing Andre Ethier almost to the warning track before it was finally run down.\nOne at-bat, one swing, the start of a long war. But that’s what Collins was talking about when he decided to bat Granderson leadoff, and why he anointed Murphy as the cleanup hitter.\nOf course the calculus changed after Juan Uribe suffered a chest contusion, and Collins was the first to admit, “If Juan was still here I probably would have gotten [him] in the lineup.” And Collins was also correct when he said Kershaw’s numbers against right-handed hitters were “outstanding.”\nHolding righties to a .211 average throughout his career, Kershaw forces a manager to forget about platooning and instead pick his poison. So Collins went to his lefties, issuing the kind of vote of confidence you’d expect from an old-school tough guy.\n“It really doesn’t matter, to me, where you hold the bat,” he said. “You better go in there and get a good pitch to hit and I think our lefties can do that.”\nThere’ll be a different narrative tonight against Zack Greinke. It’s a guarantee that Michael Conforto will be in left field and that Duda, who was batting sixth Friday, will bat closer to the middle of the order. One more time, Collins will roll the dice and expect the best, even if it means doing so against the National League’s ERA king.\nBut these are the fingerprints that Collins has left all over this team, building them up, pumping them full of macho helium and then setting them loose upon October.\nLogic says the Mets’ lefties would be nothing more than human sacrifice being fed to Kershaw, but not if you believed Collins. Not if you believe, like he does, that anything is possible with that time-honored weapon called trust.\nEmail: klapisch@northjersey.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T03:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T07:49:18.116+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
