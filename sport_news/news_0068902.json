Last month, the missing link to a trail along the Elizabeth River opened. The quarter-mile path along Lambert's Creek connects to the 10.5-mile pedestrian and bike path through several Norfolk neighborhoods. Eight years in the making, the path begins near Hampton and Terminal boulevards, goes through Old Dominion University, West Ghent, the Chelsea District and Freemason, passes Harbor Park and ends near Norfolk State University.\nLast week, Suffolk dedicated its Seaboard Coastline Trail, a 2.3-mile path that starts in Driver Village and ends at Shoulder's Hill Road. Eventually, the trail by farm fields and forests is supposed to link downtown Suffolk and Chesapeake.\nChesapeake, which plans a bike path along Portsmouth Boulevard to Suffolk, announced this month that it had corrected its proposal to locate its 10-foot-wide concrete path on the opposite side of the road from Suffolk.\nOriginally, the path was to be built on the south side of Portsmouth Boulevard and would have required users to cross the street to the north side at the Suffolk border. The trail, part of a $31 million project to widen Portsmouth Boulevard and Nansemond Parkway, is expected to be complete in two years and will give recreational runners, cyclists and strollers a safe way to navigate that high-traffic area.\nBut the most expansive proposal unveiled lately is Norfolk's Bicycle and Pedestrian Strategic Plan, which outlines a network of bicycle and pedestrian lanes, paths and walkways along 12 key corridors, all connected.\nThis month, after 18 months of study by cyclists and planners, the city rolled out the priority list. As The Pilot's Tim Eberly reported, Norfolk has begun working on part of it, a loop from Colley Avenue to 35th Street to Llewellyn Avenue to Olney Road and back to Colley. The plan is being designed now and \"calls for a variety of bike lanes and other infrastructure, allowing the city to test them and see what works best,\" Eberly wrote.\nEventually, planners hope to see a 44-mile path between Suffolk and the Oceanfront in Virginia Beach. Norfolk and Virginia Beach have made it a priority to earn the official designation as a \"bicycle-friendly community\" - a moniker that attracts young people who prefer to commute by bike or on foot to driving.\nMiles of bike lanes and multi-use trails have been built by neighborhoods throughout Virginia Beach. The city needs ways to safely go north and south.\nCity leaders wisely look at Madison, Wis., Austin, Texas, and much of the Research Triangle in North Carolina as models for attracting good jobs and smart workers. All tout their bike lanes and trails as incentives that helped to entice growth and made their cities more diverse.\nHampton Roads isn't bike friendly yet, but it's moving in the right direction.\nAbout editorials Virginian-Pilot editorials represent the consensus of the editorial board, which is independent of the newsroom.
