If you watch the goals that they let in against them, that's a big difference from last year in that aspect. \n\"Maybe they lost a little bit but they are still very strong. \n\"We know maybe the start of the season is not what everybody expected of Chelsea. \n\"They were the strongest team last year but, okay, it doesn't say anything about the situation because they have the qualities, they have the players to give a good reaction. \n\"Finally they will go up in the table.\" \nChelsea were marching towards the title when Southampton visited last season and were held to a 1-1 draw thanks to Dusan Tadic's penalty. \nAnd Koeman is confident his side can pick up another positive result in west London. \n\"That feeling we had already last year,\" the Dutchman added at his pre-match press conference. \n\"We know what we can expect, we can have a good result if we play on our level because two times we had a draw against them last year. \n\"That belief that we had last year, we have to show again.\" \nKoeman could add Jordy Clasie to the squad at Stamford Bridge. \nThe Holland midfielder has yet to feature in the Premier League for Saints due to an ankle injury, but he has trained this week and is in contention. \nKoeman will otherwise choose from the same squad which beat Swansea 3-1 at St Mary's last weekend.
