And, his replacement at Oklahoma State, Kody Cook, also walked on initially and is a receiver by trade. \nBoth have made splendid plays, though, further solidifying K-State’s reputation for developing walk-ons. \nStill, depending on a walk-on quarterback requires the utmost faith. \nEspecially when Justin Silmon, the running back who started in those narrow defeats to OSU and TCU, also joined K-State without a scholarship. In addition, receivers who are in the lineup lack experience. \nK-State is a team without a proven go-to performer. That was not true each of the past four years when Collin Klein moved piles to get necessary yardage while adeptly running time off the clock and when Tyler Lockett was a multi-purpose threat opponents rarely contained. \nSo yes, it is feasible that the K-State staff would not have as much trust in the abilities of the current offense to sustain production without feeling as if it must mix up play-calling. Or, that the Cats did not have the punch needed to automatically convert on fourth-and-1 — a long yard, at that — against TCU. \nRemember again that Hubener was dinged the week before and taken out at Oklahoma State. Injuries have thinned the Wildcats all season, especially at quarterback. Those setbacks could influence any decisions, anytime, for designing quarterback keepers — long one of the most effective elements of any K-State offense. \nStill, wouldn’t it be great to hear what was discussed last week during the pivotal timeout K-State used inside the two-minute mark? \nWere reservations shared about the Cats’ offense, and its chances of moving the sticks? Was confidence expressed instead regarding the Cats’ defense, and its chances of containing TCU? Was overtime a better option, given TCU’s explosiveness? Were past misses by Cantele mentioned? \nDunno ... but every man a Wildcat seems to have a definitive answer to each question. \nIn light of the 0-2 league start, we know Snyder takes full responsibility and acknowledged that he erred against TCU by settling for a field goal. \nHe’s right. Not only about the decision, but also his own role. \nAs much as anyone wants to blame this on Dana Dimel and his play-calling, the co-offensive coordinator is not allowed to explain his rationale. Instead, that falls exclusively on Snyder — much like any play that is sent in, or any decision regarding personnel, is subject to the head coach’s approval. \nSo, it is Snyder’s call. Period. \nLook, the K-State coach, and his staff, remain exceptionally skilled at scouting and scheming opponents. \nThey showed that the past two weeks by jumping ahead of OSU and TCU, two undefeated teams tied for the Big 12 lead. \nMost maddening, and rare, is the Wildcats failed to preserve halftime leads, something they managed in 49 previous games in which they led at the break. \nLeads slip. Especially in the Big 12, a league in which teams are loaded with gifted playmakers and come at you, as Snyder said before conference play began, “at the speed of light.’’ \nFrankly, K-State would be the surprise team of the Big 12 had it won its first two conference games. \nBut the Cats lost. And now, confidence is teetering. \nBoth for a fan base unaccustomed to K-State blowing halftime leads, and for a coaching staff, led by Snyder, that seems as if it’s not overly convinced in a promising offense that has shown considerable growth. \nKevin Haskin can be reached at (785) 295-1159 or kevin.haskin@cjonline.com .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T21:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T03:03:58.754+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
