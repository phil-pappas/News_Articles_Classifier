This week, the Colts fell into a 27-point hole to the Saints before nearly climbing out of that hole with a miraculous comeback. Regardless, both games resulted in losses for the 3-4 Colts and, now, emotions could be boiling over.\nAccording to Zak Keefer of The Indianapolis Star , Colts owner Jim Irsay and general manager Ryan Grigson got into a \"heated conversation\" in the locker room following Sunday's loss.\nReally, both don't have anything to be happy about. The Colts are below .500. Their franchise quarterback, Andrew Luck , has turned into an interception machine. Since drafting Luck, the Colts are 17-17 against non-AFC South foes. The Colts, once thought of as Super Bowl contenders, don't look like a legitimate threat to any of the current powerhouses.\nThere is room to be optimistic, though. And that's because of the AFC South, which doesn't feature a team over .500.\nUnfortunately for the Colts, the schedule isn't looking very promising, as they have five consecutive non-division games on the horizon. Ryan Grigson and Jim Irsay were reportedly involved in a 'heated conversation.'
