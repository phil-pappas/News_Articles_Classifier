I'd be shocked if both don't clear, but of course, I figured the Wild wouldn't keep a first-year pro in Mike Reilly if he's not initially playing.\nBut as GM Chuck Fletcher, who usually wants kids to play, reminded yesterday, “We did last year with [Matt] Dumba and [Christian] Folin at times where we had those players with the NHL roster. They weren’t playing every night, but they were learning and watching and practicing, and then at times they needed the game reps [and were sent to Iowa].”\nSo we'll see how long Reilly lasts if the Wild doesn't have injuries in the top-6. Remember, too, the Wild has two games in the first three days and then has four days off before a three-game road trip. So today's roster may not be next week's roster.\nThe roster is at 25, but it's really 24 because Justin Fontaine is expected to start on injured reserve.\nIf Haula or Jordan Schroeder start on IR, the Wild could have its opening-night roster right now. None of the above three is practicing now.\nIf Haula starts on IR and the Wild doesn't recall Dalpe, Ryan Carter could play center. If Haula and Schroeder both start on IR, the Wild will either need to recall a forward or maybe play Prosser at wing.\nHere's the roster as of now.\nForwards\nJason Zucker-Mikko Koivu-Nino Niederreiter\nZach Parise-Mikael Granlund-Jason Pominville\nThomas Vanek-Tyler Graovac-Charlie Coyle\nChris Porter-Ryan Carter-\nInjuries: Justin Fontaine, Erik Haula, Jordan Schroeder\nDefensemen\nRyan Suter-Jared Spurgeon\nJonas Brodin-Matt Dumba\nMarco Scandella-Christian Folin\nMike Reilly-Nate Prosser\nGoalies\nDevan Dubnyk\nDarcy Kuemper\nNiklas Backstrom\nTalk to you after practice.
