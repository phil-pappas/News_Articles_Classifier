Forecasters say winter El Niño storms will ease but not end the drought. Jae C. Hong AP i \ndkasler@sacbee.com \nCalifornia can expect a wet but warm winter from El Niño, forecasters said Thursday, bringing some “drought improvement” but probably not enough precipitation to bring the four-year dry spell to an end. \nIn their latest winter outlook, forecasters at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reiterated that one of the strongest El Niños on record appears to be headed to California. They said Southern and Central California are very likely to get above-normal precipitation, but the likelihood drops off to 34 to 40 percent for the Sacramento Valley. \n“The winter outlook is good news for California” but the drought probably won’t be over, said Mike Halpert, deputy director at the agency’s Climate Prediction Center in College Park, Md., in a conference call with reporters. He said El Niño will likely translate into “drought improvement” but not “drought removal.” \nHeavy rains in Southern California will help ease the drought, but what California needs is heavy snow in the northern half of the state, where most of the major reservoirs sit. Halpert said the outlook for Northern California has improved, but the likelihood of a warmer-than-usual winter means it’s hard to predict if the northern Sierra will get a significant snowpack. \n“As we get closer to winter we’re probably tilting a little more toward a wetter-than-average winter” in Northern California, he said. \nAsked about the size of the snowpack around Lake Tahoe, Alan Haynes, a hydrologist with the agency’s California Nevada River Forecast Center, said “it might be slightly more likely to be wet and slightly more likely to be warmer.” \nHalpert said California’s water “deficit” is probably too deep to erase in one wet winter.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T19:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T01:27:56.707+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
