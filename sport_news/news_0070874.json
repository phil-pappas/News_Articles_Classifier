Graham has been chosen to play for the East in the Semper Fidelis All-American Bowl on Sunday, January 3, in Carson, California. Sponsored by the U.S. Marine Corps, the game will be televised by Fox Sports 1, starting at 5 p.m. (Central time). Graham will be among 90 of the top high school seniors from throughout the nation to compete in the game. Kyle Linsner of the Semper Fi All-American Bowl, Staff Sgt. Jacob McKenzie, Bastrop High principal David Nordman and BHS coach Brad Bradshaw were among the speakers in Thursday's ceremony, held at the Rams' fieldhouse. Also in attendance were Morehouse Parish Schools interim superintendent Hazel Sellers, the Bastrop High coaching staff and Graham's teammates. Graham will be the featured attraction in another ceremony on Friday, October 30 at 10 a.m., when he reveals his decision regarding the next stop in his football career. He will make the big announcement during Bastrop High's homecoming pep rally. Graham has scheduled his final official visit this weekend to Mississippi State. He has already taken official visits to TCU and Arkansas. An official visit to South Carolina was canceled as flooding throughout the Palmetto state forced the October 10 game with LSU to be moved to Baton Rouge. Following Thursday's ceremony, Graham said his choices are down to Arkansas, Mississippi State, TCU and Tennessee. Though Graham hasn't visited Tennessee, he says he has remained in close contact with receivers coach Zach Azzani. “I talk to coach Z every night,” Graham said. Graham expects to make his decision sometime early next week upon returning from Starkville, Mississippi. “It's between those four schools, right now,” Graham said. Graham, who is on schedule to graduate from Bastrop High at the semester, plans to enroll in college in January and take part in spring practice. Throughout the recruiting process, Graham has never offered the slightest hint as to where he may ultimately land. “I'm in the dark, too,” Willie Graham II, Isaiah's father, said with a laugh. Though he is taking his time and carefully evaluating his options, Isaiah Graham says he is ready for the recruiting process to come to an end. “The late-night calls and the DMs (direct messages) on Twitter are getting old, but next Friday, it's all going to end,” Graham said. Graham, a Class 4A All-State selection last season, says he has solicited advice from different college players, including TCU receivers KaVontae Turpin, Jaelan Austin and Josh Doctson and Arkansas receiver Jared Cornelius, who prepped at Shreveport Evangel. Page 2 of 2 - Graham says he has talked extensively with Turpin, the former Neville superstar, who has made quite a splash at TCU as a true freshman. “Even though we played for rival teams, KaVontae's a great friend,” Graham said. “He wants me to come to TCU, but he told me I need to go where my heart leads me.” Meanwhile, Graham says he will return to action for Friday night's District 2-4A tilt at Franklin Parish. He was held out of last week's 59-13 victory over Tioga as precaution due to a lower back injury.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T03:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T11:14:48.800+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
