To score goals, we have to attack. \n\"What we want to do is play up to our level, because that will be needed - we play against a big team. \n\"We feel a bit that the pain inflicted [in Europe] was a bit by ourselves, maybe subconsciously we thought 'Anyway we will win these'. Now to correct that we need a great performance.\" Promoted Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T11:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T12:48:40.840+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
