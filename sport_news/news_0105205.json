Last season, as a No. 1 seed, the Crusaders scored on the opening play from scrimmage and never looked back in an 83-12 victory against the Eagles. \nLiberty, a relatively new school, does not have a senior class. So its team is comprised of juniors, sophomores and freshmen. \n“They’re much improved,” Rulo said. “You can see they are more comfortable out there. You can see them growing as a team.” \nThe Eagles, who got off to a 4-2 start to the season before dropping their last two games, operate from a split-back veer on offense. That means they like to run and run and run. \nLiberty has five players with at least 270 yards rushing this season. Stone Krogman (6-foot-2, 185 pounds, jr.) leads with 651 yards (7.2 avg.) and five touchdowns. Branton McCain (6-0, 190, jr.) is next with 409 yards (5.4) and four scores. \nLiberty quarterback Ryan Bermudez (5-8, 145 soph.) has rushed for 278 yards (5.8). He is just 27-of-65 passing for 386 yards with four touchdowns and four interceptions. \n“He does a good job of running the offense,” Rulo said. \nBrian Jones (6-3, 185 jr.) is the primary receiver with 19 catches for 267 yards and four touchdowns. No other Eagle has more than three catches. \nThe Crusader defense is coming off one of its top efforts of the season. Helias allowed just 165 total yards last week in a 14-7 win at Sullivan. Toss out a 70-yard touchdown run and the Crusaders allowed less than 2.5 yards per carry in the victory. \nIt’s a group that has shown steady improvement since struggling in the early weeks of the season. \n“The defense has really gotten better and playing well,” Rulo said. “We have found a good unit that we like. We’re being consistent with our personnel. \n“The defensive staff has done a great job of getting everybody on the same page.” \nRulo believes that comes in no small part because the defense has done a great job of studying its opponent throughout the week. \n“We really want the guys to understand the scouting report and being comfortable with it, so they can play fast,” he said. “Free the mind, free the feet.” \nOne potential positive from playing Liberty this week is potential district semifinal foe Hannibal plays out of the same formation. \n“It’s allowing us practice for what we may see down the road,” Rulo said. \nDefensively, Liberty employs a 4-4 front. That means the Helias running game will have to contend with eight men near the line of scrimmage, \n“They try to stop the run by getting everyone up there,” Rulo said. “It’s going to be a challenge for us, we’ll need to communicate and remember our assignments.” \nAlong with the defense, the Helias offensive line has improved throughout the season. \n“That group knows its assignments so much better,” Rulo said. \nBut the group will be without senior Cole Johnson, who suffered a broken arm against Sullivan. He will be replaced by sophomore Matthew Witt in the starting lineup. \nHelias will also be without receiver Kale Gerstner, who suffered a knee injury in the Sullivan game. Dalton Weaver will step in on offense. \nAlex Faddoul, who has missed the last two weeks, will start at quarterback for Helias. \n“He’s looked good running around, throwing the ball,” Rulo said. \nIn his first year at Helias, Rulo is excited to see the Crusaders play in the postseason. \n“I’m ready to see us compete,” Rulo said. “We need to find that final gear and get after it, I’m excited to see what that looks like.” \nNotes: The game will start at 5 p.m. The late start is due to ACT testing Saturday. … Jeremiah Heckman will start in place of Gerstner at safety on defense. … Helias has won eight consecutive district titles, going 24-0 in that span. \nHelias hosts Wentzville: Liberty at 5 p.m. Saturday - Updates on Twitter: @tjrackers .
