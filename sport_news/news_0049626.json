He said if he wasn't wearing a knee brace, he would \"probably have been done.\" Now the ankle injury hurts more than the knee. It's the same knee injury he suffered in Week 3 of the preseason. Johnson said the injury might affect his confidence and his cutting, but it's \"nothing too serious\" because he can tolerate pain. \n\"I'll be all right,\" Johnson said. \"They have painkillers for that.\" Banged-up, too \nThe Eagles defense is also dealing with injuries. Linebacker Mychal Kendricks (hamstring), cornerback Byron Maxwell (quadriceps), and defensive lineman Brandon Bair (groin) did not practice after leaving Sunday's game early. \nDefensive coordinator Bill Davis said Kendricks is \"day-to-day,\" but a league source said Kendricks' hamstring is back to where it was in Week 3, when he was out against the New York Jets, and that it would be a stretch for him to play Sunday. \nMaxwell hopes to play Sunday after leaving the Washington game in the first quarter. \"As it's looking right now, I don't think I'll be out, but you never know how these things go,\" he said. \nDavis said it will be hard for Bair to play this week, although the Eagles could have reinforcements coming. Cedric Thornton and Taylor Hart practiced after missing the last two weeks with injuries. Extra points \nWide receiver Josh Huff played only four offensive snaps Sunday. The limited playing time was not health-related. \"I can just control what I can control,\" Huff said. \"I come in day in and day out and bust my [butt] and show these guys that I'm up for it and I'm ready to go. They've got the final decision.\" . . . Davis addressed his players about Washington's 15-play, 90-yard game-winning drive. \"I hope the next 12 games come down to that same scenario because we'll win the next 12,\" he told them.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T02:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T03:01:24.888+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
