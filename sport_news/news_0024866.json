Got a suggestion for someone we should interview? See the bottom of this story.\nHis job is to help children find permanence.\nPermanent families. Permanent traditions, like getting a gift from Santa Claus. Permanent lives.\nDavid Udlock, 56, of Oregon City, has been in social work for 31 years, 24 of those with the state Department of Human Services. A caseworker, he connects foster and adoptive children with parents. He helps organize the annual Shoulder to Shoulder conference for child welfare professionals and foster and adoptive parents, which draws hundreds of attendees. He's played Santa at holiday parties for kids in foster care.\nUdlock has so impressed the Oregon Post Adoption Resource Center, one of the adoption agencies he's worked with, that it nominated him for Oregon's 2015 Angels in Adoption award, given by the Congressional Coalition on Adoption Institute for \"extraordinary contributions on behalf of children in need of families.\"\nThis month Udlock flew to Washington, D.C., to receive his award and meet with Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Oregon. The week before he left, he was most excited about taking along his wife, Jan, who'd never been to the East Coast. He was also looking forward to the accompanying gala, where special guests included \"Duck Dynasty\" stars Korie and Willie Robertson and \"X Factor\" contestant Rachel Crow. \"I've never been to a freaking gala!\" he said.\nWelcome to his world:\nI got into social work prior to my getting my master's in 1983, when I had a friend of mine basically tell me that, 'You know, you're good at talking to people and listening.'\nDays aren't typical. Days are usually spent between court, meetings, planning with the various parties involved in a case, and lots of paperwork. Currently my case load's about 18. That seems pretty typical with other workers right now.\nThe (work) environment can be difficult because we do different things. We really have to come together to really focus on what the needs of the kids are and what's going to be best.\nOur first intent is always to try to reunify a family, and when that's not possible we look then for the most permanent option that's potentially available for a child. If adoption is something that can be attained and it's appropriate, then that's what we look for.\nI remember when I first came to Oregon, in '91, that fathers really weren't even recognized. That really has finally come up to where it should be.\nIt's really the little things that make you smile and they just happen out of nowhere. I received a report from an adoption worker about two kids that are in the process of being adopted and they're 10 and 12 and they have a really horrific background. In the report there's a comment about the 10-year-old girl, that she has her daddy wrapped around her little finger. It just really made me smile.\nThis little boy that I've been working with for about the last three years, when I first met him, he was 2 and a half without speech, and I mean no speech. When I saw him about two weeks ago, his speech has gotten to the point where he's speaking in long sentences. There's still some brokenness, but he's now got inflection. You just look at that, and you just smile because you know he's come so far. And it makes it worth it.\nIt is an interesting perspective to be Santa and to watch the kids and to watch their responses: that 5-, 6-, 7-year-old who'll kind of look at you strangely, that 1- and 2- year-old that are just scared to death of you. But to be able to give something back has a lot of value, it really does, and it allows families that are involved with the child welfare system to have some piece of normalcy.\nWe're trying to plan about two or three events a year specifically for siblings that are in DHS foster care that aren't necessarily placed together, to give them an opportunity to be together. When the night's over with, just to be able to see the excitement on the children...\nI was also involved, oh, for about three or four years, with a separate event that had to do with planning an event for teens that were in DHS foster care â€“ just trying to provide them with a special type of night. And it was all fun. The kids really seemed to enjoy it and appreciated it.\nThe work that I've done for Shoulder to Shoulder, it's really a collaboration of bringing everybody together, from adoptive parents to social workers to school personnel, that works with child welfare. It's being able to give everybody training on the same subjects. That's something that's really critical, that we're all hearing the same kind of message and we're all learning the same thing.\nI've done a lot of recruiting, I've written lots of bulletins, I've talked with probably thousands of people, I've gotten to know many adoption agencies across the country, and I've been fortunate to be able to place children all across the country as well as kids within the state of Oregon.\nProbably the greatest benefit is really being able to see the family grow and create itself and then be able just to grow normally.\n-- Amy Wang\n(503) 294-5915; @ORAmyW\nFill out my online form .", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/oramyw", "https://oregonian.wufoo.com/forms/zmayue70hcs2wl"], "published": "2015-10-19T13:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T16:24:55.771+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
