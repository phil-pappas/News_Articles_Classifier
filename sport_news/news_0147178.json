It was recently made aware of the data breach by federal law enforcement.\nScottrade believes client names and addresses were the target of the hack.\n “Although Social Security numbers, email addresses or other sensitive data were contained in the system accessed, it appears that contact information was the focus of the incident. We have not seen any indication of increased fraudulent activity as a result of this incident,” the company said in a statement announcing the breach.\nScottrade doesn't believe account funds were compromised and emphasized that passwords were encrypted.\n“We have secured the known intrusion point and conducted an internal data forensics investigation on this incident with assistance from a leading computer security firm. We have taken appropriate steps to further strengthen our network defenses,” the company said.\nScottrade is offering clients a year of identity theft protection. Enrollment details will be provided through direct communication from the company.\nCopyright 2015 Raycom News Network.
