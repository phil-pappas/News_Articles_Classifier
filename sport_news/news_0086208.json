And this was against the Pac-12's best defense, one that held USC to 1-of-13 conversions a week ago.\n\"I almost shed a tear but it was all smiles,\" Carrington said after playing his first game since the Jan. 1 Rose Bowl due to NCAA and team discipline. \"You never know how fast it could be gone. It was just good to be back out there.\"\nOregon had entered Saturday ranked 91st nationally converting third down, but Adams' improvisation and Royce Freeman 's 27 rushes for 138 yards help move the chains. (And Freeman now moves into No. 8 all-time with 2,237 rushing yards at UO, moving past Ahmad Rashad and Jeremiah Johnson.)\n\"Vernon is a special player and he showed some of that tonight,\" offensive coordinator Scott Frost said. \"He made us go, extending some plays and making some throws and we've been missing that a little bit in our offense. I feel great for him that people get to see what he's like when he's healthy.\"\nThat isn't to suggest this marked a wholesale return to the high-flying brand of football Oregon rode to last season's Pac-12 Conference championship. UO started the game without starting left guard Matt Pierson, who's out with an undisclosed injury. Halfway through, two more valuable starters went down and didn't return: right tackle Tyrell Crosby and safety Charles Nelson. The Ducks ended it by nearly allowing a fourth-quarter comeback for a second consecutive week.\nAfter Oregon could not convert on third down with just over a minute remaining, its saving grace was freshman cornerback Ugo Amadi, who stepped in front of a pass by reserve quarterback K.J. Carta-Samuels — starter Jake Browning was having his shoulder looked at — to preserve a wild win in a season that's been just as up-and-down.\n\"The guy was open,\" Amadi said. \"But I had enough time to react to the ball so he kind of sailed it in the air a little bit.\"\nThe Ducks also committed nine penalties, and scored its second touchdown thanks to a Huskies gift — a head-slappingly silly holding penalty on a punt that changed field position by 40 yards. Relying on true freshmen at left tackle, quarterback and running back, Washington's offense largely handcuffed itself. But that running back, Myles Gaskin, ripped off a 72-yard touchdown to pull within 23-13 in the fourth quarter. That quarterback then followed with a three-yard TD pass to bring it within six.\nThey would inch no closer.\nAdams wasn't the only shift in the lineup. Tyree Robinson, a starter the previous six games at safety, started at cornerback instead, opposite Arrion Springs. That switch left Juwaan Williams and Nelson at safety, at least before Nelson was hurt late in the second half.\n\"We really need the bye week right now,\" defensive coordinator Don Pellum said. \"... We've been beat up along the way. We really need the bye week and we needed to regroup defensively to move forward.\"\nThe Adams Effect was immediate. Oregon quarterbacks had completed 3 of 14 passes thrown 20 yards or longer in its three previous games. Adams launched bombs of 48- and 36-yard gains, the latter for a touchdown to Carrington — on the first drive. Oregon hadn't thrown for more than 178 yards in that same three-game stretch. UO had 202 passing yards at the half, and a 16-3 lead to go with it.\n\"Huge impact,\" Helfrich said. \"You have to be able to make plays in the passing game when that comes up.\"\n\"(Adams) made some plays. He'll look at a few of those plays like woulda-coulda-shoulda type moments that, again, are a lot more fun to correct after a win than a loss. But certainly the ability to improvise and make some plays when things aren't perfect, he did a nice job.\"\nAdams set a Husky Stadium record by throwing seven touchdowns in a September 2014 loss while with Eastern Washington. He wasn't that video-game good this time, but he left with the thing he truly wanted: a win.\nCarrington caught five passes for 125 yards and two touchdowns in his first game following a seven-game suspension for violating NCAA and team rules, and if it looked as though he'd worked with Adams for months, it was true.\nThis summer, when Adams had moved to Eugene but couldn't officially join the UO roster until he passed a final math class and graduated from Eastern Washington, he and Carrington met on the fields east of Oregon's Student Recreation Center for informal throwing sessions. They were each players without a team; Carrington had failed an NCAA-run drug test during the College Football Playoff and had to sit half the season.\n\"We got to be good friends,\" Carrington said. \"I think there's a little chemistry there.\"\nThat many of Adams' biggest successes appeared improvised or aided by Husky mistakes — a 48-yarder to Dwayne Stanford after he'd improvised on third down; a 44-yarder to Bralon Addison to set up a field goal after UW corner Kevin King fell with 18 seconds left in the first half — almost didn't matter. Like a thirsty man in a desert, Oregon's wilting passing attack wasn't going to be picky about where it found help.\nHow truly healthy, Frost was asked, was Adams tonight?\n\"He looked pretty good to me,\" he said with a smile.\nAs Adams goes, so go the Ducks. They have a pulse.\n-- Andrew Greif\nagreif@oregonian.com\n@andrewgreif", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/andrewgreif"], "published": "2015-10-18T07:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T12:07:27.187+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
