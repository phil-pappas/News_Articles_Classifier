By then it was worth 6.7 million euros. Beckenbauer, by then the president of the organizing committee, and Niersbach, the vice president, \"began looking for a way in 2005 to pay back the illicit funds in an inconspicuous manner,\" the magazine said. \nSpiegel reported that a cover was created with the help of FIFA and that 6.7 million euros was transferred to world soccer's governing body as a contribution to an opening ceremony gala that was later canceled. \n\"The money had been paid into a FIFA bank account in Geneva. From there, FIFA allegedly promptly transferred the money to a Zurich account belonging to Louis-Dreyfus,\" Spiegel reported. \nLouis-Dreyfus died in 2009. \nEarlier Friday, the DFB said it was investigating whether a 6.7 million euro payment made by its World Cup organizing committee to FIFA in April 2005 for a \"cultural program\" had been misused. \n\"As part of its audits the DFB found no evidence of irregularities. Nor was there any evidence delegates' votes were purchased as part of the application process,\" the DFB said in a statement. \nSpokeswoman Pamela Mueller-Niese told The Associated Press that the German Interior Ministry had \"no knowledge\" of the matter. \nAssociated Press writers David Rising and Frank Jordans contributed. \nThis story has been corrected to show the dollar conversion in 2nd paragraph is about $6 million, instead of about $16 million. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T18:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T18:20:58.137+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
