MOUNDRIDGE — The Moundridge Wildcats’ late-season roll continued Friday night with a 40-28 home victory over Heart of America League rival Remington. “We knew Remington was a good football team,” said Moundridge head coach Matt Cole. “… We continue to improve. We continue to move in the right direction. It was a non-district win, but that’s three in a row.” In a preview of the rest of the evening, the Wildcats (3-4, 2-4 HOAL) took advantage of a short field after the Broncos (0-7, 0-5 HOAL) failed to recover an onside kick to start the game. On 3rd-and-10, Moundridge quarterback Anthony Otte capped a nine-play 55-yard drive with a 23-yard touchdown strike to Parker Lange to put the Wildcats up seven with 8:00 to go in the first quarter. A Remington three-and-out led to another score when Otte found running back Damian Calderon from 11 yards out to make it 14-0 on the ensuing Wildcat drive. A Broncos turnover on downs left possession with Moundridge at the Remington 37, before Calderon pay dirt for the second time on a 2-yard score just under two minutes into the second quarter. Calderon, a 5-foot-2 116 pound sophomore, has given the Moundridge offense a spark since returning from injury three games ago against Inman. After starting the season 0-5, the Wildcats haven’t tasted defeat since. After Otte opened things up with the pass, the Wildcats turned to their counter-heavy ground game for 276 yards. “If it was up to me I’d sling the ball 800 times a game,” Cole said. “But our bread and butter the last three weeks has just been pounding the ball.” Calderon ran for 119 yards on 27 carries with two scores, while senior Joel Holloway added 117 yards on 17 carries. Remington managed 302 yards of total offense, but the deficit had them playing catch up all night. Broncos quarterback Blake Thunberg completed 15-of-39 passes for 175 yards, but two interceptions would prove costly. Remington ran the ball just 18 times. Ensz led the way with 89 yards. Fullback Garet Johnson had just one carry. Thunberg sandwiched 49 and 7-yard touchdown passes to running back Todd Ensz around an Otte quarterback sneak in the second quarter to bring Remington to within 27-14 at halftime. After a failed fake punt by Remington, Holloway added a 9-yard passing touchdown to his resume on a halfback pass Kaden Diederich to open the second half scoring. The Wildcats led to 34-14 with 4:13 left in the third quarter. Ensz would score on a 32-yard sweep to cut it to 13 less than two minutes later, but after another short kick gave Moundridge possession near midfield back-to-back unsportsmanlike conduct penalties set up Calderon’s third touchdown late the third. Page 2 of 2 - “The biggest positive is this is the first game I’ve seen the fight,” said Remington head coach Chris Lawler. “There were the penalties, but it was both teams playing hard. I liked seeing our kids aggressive.” The Broncos were back to within two touchdowns after Thunberg hit Johnson for a short score with 6:37 to play, but Lange picked off his second pass from Thunberg to salt the game away with 2:55 left. Both teams return to their respective district play next week. Moundridge can clinch a playoff berth with a win at Salina-Sacred Heart. “Next week is the game we’ve been waiting for,” Cole said. “We’ll see how we step up. It’s for the playoffs. Like I told them, if we’re ever going to take a week of football serious that’s the week to do it.” Remington looks for its first win at Oswego.
