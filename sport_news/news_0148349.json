But Ridley Scott’s The Martian , starring Matt Damon, presents a different, more enjoyable point of view: science is damn glorious.\nIf we’re speaking on general terms, chemistry and physics are things most people withdraw from. It’s reserved for “smart people.” So for me, everything that fits into the broad category called “science” is boxed up in the attic of my brain, untouched, basically sub-labeled as “Everything in here: You won’t get it.”\nThat is, until The Martian makes the act of studying the material world look way more obliging. Aside from all the tricked out stuff we get with every sci-fi movie (the treadmill inside the turning spacecraft?) and the aloof kid who saves the day (Donald Glover, everybody!), the real appeal comes from the actual martian.\n Scientist Mark Watney, aka Matt Damon, aka a regular Boston dude, aka how you like them apples, is unintentionally left for dead on Mars and must find his way home. Once he starts experimenting with survival tactics, math and space and the periodic table start to seem approachable. The Martian is Matt Damon’s one man-show of making a whole lotta nothing into a whole bunch of somethings, and I’m here for all of it.\nI’m here for all of the science.\nMost of it has to do with Watney’s resourcefulness. Water does not exist on Mars (well it didn’t at the time), but Mark Watney will not be stopped! He will make water, and water will make him potatoes, and potatoes will make him live. His small NASA hub becomes a low-key potato farm.\nThen he has some other moments when you just think, man, this dude has a great temperament for a guy who is alone, 50 million miles from Earth. When his advisors ask him to take a photo of himself to send back to America, only to pose like the Fonz? It was so charming. Like, check out nerdy Matt Damon up on Mars, making the audience laugh instead of stressing them out with dark holes and dimensions and Matthew McConaughey’s maddening encounters with a bookshelf .\n“I don’t mean to brag or anything, but I’m the greatest botanist on this planet,” is one of Watney’s best lines. In the midst of an impossibly lonely moment, his wit is the last buffer between himself and his fear.\nLike its protagonist, The Martian is efficient, witty, inventive and realistic, and builds towards a tense closing sequence that sees a huge team effort. At that point, science is the only thing that can bring Matt Damon home.\nAnd that’s a damn glorious thing.\nThe many haircuts of Matt Damon:\nPrevious -- of -- Next In “Good Will Hunting,” Damon sports something like a bowl cut with a prominent part.
