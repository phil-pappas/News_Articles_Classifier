Bills coach Rex Ryan couldn't believe the turnout for such a long trip.\n\"You couldn't get into a restaurant yesterday without seeing Bills fans. It was awesome,\" Ryan said. \"I guess something I'm learning, I had no idea that Bills fans travel the way they do. Miami was packed. Here it was unbelievable. That's such a great feeling to know that your guys are with you, your fans travel so well. I also love the fact that they aren't off this boat. They never looked to jump and we gave them some reason to, but they're sitting right there. That's a great feeling.\"\nAt one point during the game, an audible \"Let's go Buffalo\" chant broke out.\nIt was a #Buffalo invasion. #Bills #BillsMafia #Nashville #GoBills pic.twitter.com/FxrJw2BixC\n— NashvilleBillsBackrs (@NashBillsBackrs) October 11, 2015 Scroll through the photo gallery to see Bills fans in Nashville.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/hashtag/GoBills?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/BillsMafia?src=hash", "http://t.co/FxrJw2BixC", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/Buffalo?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bills?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/Nashville?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/NashBillsBackrs/status/653310619987390465"], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T19:02:02.499+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
