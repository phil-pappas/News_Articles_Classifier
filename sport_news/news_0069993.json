All times local:\n4:35 p.m.\nTwo years after completing a three-year ban from soccer, former FIFA executive committee member Amos Adamu faces being sanctioned again.\nFIFA's ethics body named the Nigerian among several soccer officials subject to \"formal investigation proceedings relating to the suspicion of infringements.\"\nFurther details were not provided.\nAdamu's previous ban came after being implicated in corruption allegations concerning the fiercely criticized votes selecting Russia and Qatar as hosts of the 2018 and 2022 World Cups.\nAdamu was filmed in a British newspaper sting in 2010 asking undercover reporters posing as bidders for $800,000 to influence his World Cup hosting vote, saying he wanted the money paid to him personally so he could finance soccer fields in Nigeria.\nHe was suspended and not allowed to take part in the December 2010 votes, then banned for three years by FIFA and failed in two appeals against his sanction.\n___\n4:20 p.m.\nWith secrecy on cases now lifted, FIFA's ethics committee has confirmed that suspended FIFA Secretary General Jerome Valcke is under investigation \"related to the suspicion of misuse of expenses and other infringements of FIFA's rules and regulations.\"\nValcke was initially put on leave last month when FIFA ordered an investigation into alleged unethical conduct after he was accused of taking part in a deal for black market sales of tickets to 2014 World Cup matches.\nTwo weeks ago, FIFA's ethics committee then provisionally suspended Valcke for 90 days, pending the full verdict in the case.\nValcke had been FIFA's top administrator for the past eight years under President Sepp Blatter, who has been suspended over separate allegations.\n___\n4:07 p.m.\nFIFA has confirmed that Germany great Franz Beckenbauer and senior vice president Angel Maria Villar have been investigated for wrongdoing and their cases have been passed to the adjudicatory chamber for a verdict by the ethics judge.\nDetails of the case were not provided.\nAlthough both Beckenbauer and Villar have previously been identified as targets of an investigation, the announcement on Wednesday from FIFA's ethics committee is the first public confirmation of their names.\nThe public disclosure of Villar's name is potentially embarrassing for UEFA, given that the Spanish federation president headed meetings last week of European soccer leaders while Michel Platini is suspended.\n___\n11:10 a.m.\nFormer FIFA Vice President Chung Mong-Joon is accusing the governing body of sabotaging his bid to succeed Sepp Blatter after banning him for six years from soccer.\nThe South Korean was investigated over the 2018 and 2022 World Cup bidding contest and he complains in a statement Wednesday that FIFA's ethics committee still has not provided him with the written reasons for imposing the punishment two weeks ago.\nChung failed in a bid to obtain an injunction from a Zurich court against the ban.\nThe deadline to submit candidacies to FIFA for the Feb. 26 election is on Monday. If any officials have current suspensions lifted before then, FIFA's election watchdog could still declare candidates eligible.\nChung said: \"I cannot maintain my candidacy because of the unjust sanctions, but I cannot appeal those sanctions or get an injunction from the Swiss court because I do not have the reasoned decision that FIFA's ethics Committee has so far refused to send me.\"\nChung says \"FIFA continues to sabotage my candidacy for FIFA president.\"\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T21:39:06.008+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
