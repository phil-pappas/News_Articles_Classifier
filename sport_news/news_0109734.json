Given how many times I’ve been wrong going against the Governors over the years, I am firmly convinced they would beat the Patriots if I sided with Belichick’s boys over Jimmy O.\nThe only other loss came in Abington where I rolled the dice with the Green Wave, thinking the loss of quarterback Ryan Graham to injury would really hurt East Bridgewater. The Vikings proceeded to roll over my pick early and often.\nAs Coach Bill would say, on to Week 5.\n( Home team in CAPS.)\nNORTH ANDOVER over Billerica: Have a feeling the Scarlet Knights running game is going to be a major factor.\nBridgewater-Raynham over DARTMOUTH: While Dartmouth is the defending Division 3 state champion, Bridgewater-Raynham is the defending OCL champion.\nMARSHFIELD over Falmouth: Love the job Derek Almeida is doing at Falmouth, but conquering the Rams is a very tall order.\nCOHASSET over St. John Paul: Skippers showing that the road to Div. 6 glory still runs through Pond Street.\nBEVERLY over Marblehead (at Endicott): If for no other reason, I would hate to have to listen to Chris McDonough crucifying me on Twitter.\nWalpole over WELLESLEY: Rebels take down a second consecutive undefeated team here.\nXAVERIAN over Brockton: Lots of defense here and no one does it better than the Hawks.\nGOVERNOR’S ACA DEMY over BB&N: BB&N might get its points, but not sure it will be able to keep the Governors from getting theirs.\nCentral Catholic over TEWKSBURY: Ever-so-slight nod to the Raiders, whose younger players are getting better each week.\nDUXBURY over Plymouth North: Dragons continue their reign of terror in the Patriot League.\nLAST WEEK: 8-2 (.800)\nSEASON TO DATE: 31-9 (.775)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T15:39:28.727+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
