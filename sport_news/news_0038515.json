It surely didn't get off great, but in the end I do feel like we were ready. We got out-leveraged, missed some tackles. I don't think it's 'cause you're not ready. I don't look at it that way. We knew they had been in some tight, tough games. And we knew what they were capable of.\n\"They covered us, they pressured us, they controlled the line of scrimmage. ... Did I miss anything?\"\nSince Stoops asked:\nOU mustered only 67 yards rushing on 37 attempts and 278 yards total after averaging 521.8 yards of total offense in its first four games.\nMayfield and the beleaguered offensive line took six sacks, including two on a drive late in the fourth quarter with the Sooners down seven.\nOU gave up 313 yards rushing to one-dimensional UT, including an 81-yard run by D'Onta Foreman up the middle that the Sooners said they were prepared for.\nThe previously undefeated Sooners also had lost to a struggling Texas team 36-20 in 2013 after being heavily favored. That was referenced often this week, considering UT entered the game coming off a 50-7 loss to TCU and surrounded by a burnt orange sense of doom.\nBut now it's OU's ineffectiveness and doubts about its ability to contend in the Big 12 with No. 2 TCU and No. 3 Baylor that will be obsessed over.\n\"We walked into a lion's den here today,\" defensive coordinator Mike Stoops said. \"And that's what happens. People back you into a corner, and they come out fighting. And that's a prideful program. You'd be foolish to think they wouldn't.\n\"We kind of got set up for this and couldn't respond in a more positive way.\n\"That's the disappointing part. Still, we had our chances.\"\nOU twice pulled within a touchdown of Texas in the second half, in part because Mayfield (20 of 28 for 211 yards) was able to make some big passing plays and determined runs. He completed 14 of 16 passes for 166 yards and a touchdown in the second half.\n\"When a team's bringing as much pressure as Texas was, you've got to settle in and let the bullets fly by and make the throws,\" offensive coordinator Lincoln Riley said. \"It took him a little longer to settle in.\"\nBut when OU had the ball, down seven with 6:05 to play, the Sooners gave up two more sacks and had to punt. Texas got the ball back with 3:33 to play and converted three first downs to run out the clock.\n\"Everyone's got to take a step back and get a lot better,\" Riley said. \"There was no overlooking, I know that's where you're going. You know how these games go. These guys were ready to play. We knew we were going to get everything Texas had. The defense played well enough to win. 24 points is plenty to win a Big 12 game.\"\nBut it wasn't, not on this Saturday, and that's what the Sooners are left trying to make sense of.\nTwitter: @khairopoulos\n2015 AT&T Red River Showdown Texas 24, Oklahoma 17\nBox score\nCowlishaw: Texas' upset of Oklahoma alters narrative for Longhorns coach Charlie Strong\n5 memorable moments from Texas' big win in the Red River Showdown\nPhotos: Charlie Strong gets lifted up by team, wears Golden Hat; Longhorns celebrate with fans\nPregame photos: Fans pose by Big Texas as Texas and Oklahoma prepare for Red River Showdown\nTwitter reaction to Texas' upset of Oklahoma: Kevin Durant says 'Sorry NOklahoma'\nAttendance decreases, fails to crack 92,000 for first time since Cotton Bowl capacity increased\nTexas coverage Carlton: Embarrassment at TCU left Texas 'ticked off,' ready for redemption\nHow Texas' D-line took advantage of OU senior lineman's repeated mistake to make life tough for Sooners' QB Mayfield\nFive Thoughts: How Texas pulled off upset of Oklahoma\nCharlie Strong wears Golden Hat, Texas players throw coach in air after upset of Oklahoma\nPhoto: Texas Longhorn fans turn Oklahoma Sooners fan's car into trash can\nTwitter goes right for Longhorns, rapper Lil B lifts curse\nTexas quotable: 'Today was our day'\nUT's Malik Jefferson on Bevo's absence: 'It was weird because that's tradition and everybody loves that guy'\nHorns' Foreman tops 100-yard mark again\nUT's Malik Jefferson posts first two career sacks\nUT's Swoopes finding niche on short-yardage plays\nCharlie Strong's message for Gov.
