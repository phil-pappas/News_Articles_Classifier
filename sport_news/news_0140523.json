That notion will be proven out over the coming weeks. That’s when we get to see who can handle – and who’ll collapse – under the intense October pressure.\nAdChoices 8. Houston Astros\n© Elsa/Getty Images Colby Rasmus, left, and Jose Altuve, right, of the Houston Astros celebrate defeating the New York Yankees in the American League Wild Card playoff game on Oct. 6, 2015 in New York City. Living on the edge for about two weeks may be a burden for some teams, but it’s a pleasure trip for this franchise – one that hasn’t seen success in years. Houston relied on a familiar formula to beat the Yankees in Tuesday’s AL Wild Card Game: Dallas Keuchel and the home run ball. It’s too bad the Astros can only (at most) count of half of that every four or five days. Behind Carlos Correa, Jose Altuve, and others, the franchise won’t have to worry about crawling back into the wilderness. However, as good of a story as this is, Houston isn’t ready for prime time just yet.\n7. Texas Rangers\n© Tim Heitman-USA TODAY Sports Aug 17, 2015; Arlington, TX, USA; Texas Rangers right fielder Shin-Soo Choo (17) is congratulated by his teammates in the dugout after scoring a run in the first inning against the Seattle Mariners at Globe Life Park in Arlington. Mandatory Credit: Tim Heitman-USA TODAY Sports The AL West was the land of overachievers, with the Rangers foremost among them. Texas played at a .643 clip in August and September. Their late charge wasn’t by accident, as a group of veterans led the way. Cole Hamels proved to be a shrewd deadline pick-up (going 7-1). Adrian Beltre (.344 over the last month) and Shin-Soo Choo (.343 since the All-Star break) were locked in down the stretch. Prince Fielder revived his career with 23 homers, 98 RBI and a .305 average. The Rangers, though, were 23rd in team ERA – which will make for an early exit when facing Toronto.\n6.

Mets defeated the Cardinals 5-0. (Photo by Mike Stobe/Getty Images) The anticipation that was building over the past few seasons gives way to reality. At last, the Mets are overpowering opponents with an imposing – and emerging – young rotation. Ranked fourth in team ERA, a one-through-four staff of Jacob deGrom, Noah Syndergaard, Matt Harvey and Steven Matz poses a daunting prospect for any lineup. How they bridge the gap between the starters and closer Jeurys Familia remains a major question. So is New York’s ability to beat the top NL teams, as the Mets offense got well against the league’s bottom feeders.\n5. Los Angeles Dodgers\n© Kathy Willens/AP Photo Los Angeles Dodgers starting pitcher Zack Greinke delivers in the first inning of a baseball game against the New York Mets in New York, Sunday, July 26, 2015. Despite a third straight NL West crown, Don Mattingly’s job could be on the line. He’ll once again rely on the 1-2 punch of Zack Greinke and Clayton Kershaw to deliver. This Dodger duo put up remarkable numbers together, but their respective years won’t be considered successful without success beyond the 162-game slate. With an offense that is hit-or-miss and a back end of the rotation that’s tremendously questionable, the burden rests squarely on the two aces – both poised for (and capable of) a long-awaited breakthrough.\n4. Kansas City Royals\n© Orlin Wagner/AP Photo Kansas City Royals mascot Sluggerrr celebrates following baseball game against the Chicago White Sox at Kauffman Stadium on Monday in Kansas City, Mo. The Royals defeated the White Sox 10-1. On cruise control since early summer, the defending American League champs stalled out in September, but regained form late to capture the home-field advantage throughout the playoffs. The benefit of playing at Kauffman Stadium is a luxury K.C. embraced during last year’s magical postseason run. A boisterous crowd, team speed, and an outstanding defense will again be strong. The only difference this time? They Royals won’t sneak up on anybody.\nAfter not making playoffs from 1986-2013, #Royals are now only team to make playoffs in AL in each of the last 2 years\n— Joel Sherman (@Joelsherman1) October 4, 2015\n3.

(AP Photo/Don Wright) By shutting down the Pirates on Wednesday, Jake Arrieta can embark a road where few travel. It’s one thing to be historically hot in the regular season. It’s another to continue that hot streak into the postseason. There’s no reason to believe he can’t keep it up against the rival Cardinals. But Jake’s magic act isn’t the only Chicago showstopper. He’s supported by several young standouts in the lineup (namely Anthony Rizzo and rookie Kris Bryant) who possess the talent which can offset inexperience along with a manger who’s been here before.\n2. St. Louis Cardinals\n© Jeffrey Phelps/AP Photo Jason Heyward of the St. Louis Cardinals makes a sliding catch on a ball hit by the Jonathan Lucroy of the Milwaukee Brewers during a game on Aug. 9, 2015, in Milwaukee. Statistics aren’t a sufficient judge of St. Louis’ success. The only important numbers are wins. And Cardinal victories have been aplenty over the past 11 seasons – weather in spring, summer or fall. During that span, the team has won at least 90 games on seven occasions and has made eight playoff appearances (including four consecutive trips to the LCS). In 2015, the Cards used a deep, if not spectacular, pitching staff and a consistent lineup to reach the 100-victory plateau. In other words, it’s more of the same. One significant difference this year is the presence – by bat and by glove – of Jason Heyward.\n1. Toronto Blue Jays\n© Mandatory Credit: Kim Klement-USA TODAY Sports Heading into the divisional series, the Toronto Blue Jays could make the claim they're the best squad in the field. Their prowess at the plate is a trait that hasn’t left them yet this season. The Jays ranked first in homers, RBI, slugging percentage and on-base percentage. Until late July, pitching (specifically an ace in the starting rotation) was the only thing holding them back. But once Toronto acquired David Price at the trade deadline, the team became far better at limiting runs – all the while maintaining its blistering pace on offense. With that, you have a scary – if not World Series-winning – combination.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/hashtag/Royals?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/Joelsherman1/status/650817070066614272", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T17:15:27.800+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
