Alabama won 41-23. \nA three-interception performance last Saturday wasn’t the first for Texas A&M quarterback Kyle Allen . \nAnd while he learned to accept the failures better, it was the first time he had all three returned for TDs. \nThe last time Allen threw three picks was in Pop Warner football. Back then, he said he locked himself in his bedroom and pouted. \nThis time, he faced his role in a 41-23 loss to Alabama. He also vowed the Aggies will bounce back this Saturday against Ole Miss. \n“We’re still a tight-knit family. The loss didn’t change that,” Allen said after A&M lost for the first time in six games. \nAfter losing at home, Allen is eager for a change in scenery. He’s happy to get out of Texas this weekend, even if it means playing at one of the SEC’s toughest venues. \n“I’m looking forward to eating airplane food,” Allen said. “I’m just happy to get out of Texas and play somewhere else in the country.” \nOle Miss also is looking to bounce back from a loss. After beating Alabama on Sept. 19 to move to No. 3 in the country, the Rebels have lost two of their next four games to drop to No. 24. \nBoth teams realize the loser Saturday essentially will be eliminated from the SEC Championship race. For that reason, Ole Miss coach Hugh Freeze has challenged his team to reach deep. \n“We are going to see Saturday night if the heart is there,” he said. “I’m sure we will do what we have done every week and prepare them to have that. It is an individual decision. \n“I am going to do everything within my power that I can to make sure that occurs. I saw some passion yesterday in our team meeting and individuals. At the end of the day, every man has to decide his role and what that means to him. We are going to do our best to motivate them to be confident that we will play with great passion Saturday.” \nThe Rebels may have new energy with All-America offensive tackle Laremy Tunsil returning to the lineup following a suspension during an NCAA investigation. \nAllen said his team’s chances rely on their ability to forget last week’s loss. \n“Just learning from your mistakes and moving on,” Allen said. “You look at what you did well and learn off of that. You’ve got to bounce back from that.” \n\nVols RB has strong insight into Alabama \nAlvin Kamara has been a running back at Alabama. Now he’s a running back at Tennessee. \nWith those teams playing each other on Saturday, Kamara doesn’t have any mixed allegiances. \n“I’m appreciative of my time there,” Kamara said. “I appreciate the coaches and the players for embracing me while I was there. Now here at Tennessee, I’m having a good time and enjoying the success with my teammates and I’m ready to keep enjoying the success.” \nKamara came to the Crimson Tide as a quarterback and was redshirted during his freshman year. He spent last season playing junior college football in Kansas before signing with the Volunteers last spring. \nNow a running back, Kamara has three touchdowns rushing, two receiving and one kickoff return. \nAlthough he’s been away for more than a year, Kamara has been able to provide a little help to Tennessee’s preparation. \n“Through the beginning of the week, guys have been asking me about the mood over there or, more specifically, about certain [Alabama] guys, matchup-wise, kind of the demeanor of those guys as far as playing,” Kamara said. “So I’ve been kind of an insider, being able to give [Tennessee] some information about them. It comes down to Saturday. We’ve got to keep having great practices and put it on the field on Saturday.” \n\nSpurrier still on Carolina’s payroll \nThe Head Ball Coach is still calling plays at South Carolina. \nInstead of leading the football team, Steve Spurrier will be paid for the rest of the season despite resigning at midseason, the school announced. \nSpurrier quit after a 2-4 start, but the Gamecocks will make good on the full $4.028 million salary. \n\nAggies’ Williams finds his niche \nAlthough Brandon Williams has been a running back his entire career at Texas A&M, the senior has found a second home in the defensive secondary. \nIn fact, it’s become his primary football residence. \nWilliams is a rare two-way player, serving the Aggies as a running back and a cornerback. \n“Brandon Williams is a true two-way player,” coach Kevin Sumlin said. “We’ve used him some. Continue to use him some. Been playing pretty good at corner. Those are decisions that we made. That’s where we are.” \nWilliams has focused more on defense, where he has 20 tackles and five pass breakups. \nHe’s still been used on offense. But with six total yards, it’s clear A&M considers the move to be more permanent. \nEtc. \nLeonard Fournette ’s 180 rushing yards against Florida was his eighth in a row of 100 or more and is one behind Charles Alexander ’s team at LSU. … Alabama CB Minkah Fitzpatrick became the first player in Crimson Tide history to have two pick-sixes in a single game at Texas A&M.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T04:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T18:16:57.030+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
