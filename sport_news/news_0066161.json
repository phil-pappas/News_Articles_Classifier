The Detroit Lions gave up a season-high seven sacks and squandered a double-digit first-half lead to lose to the Minnesota Vikings for the second time this year, 28-19, at Ford Field. Box score \nThe Lions scored touchdowns on their first two possessions and raced to an early 17-6 lead before the Vikings scored 22 unanswered points and turned up the heat with their blitzing defense on Matthew Stafford. \nStafford, who needed chest x-rays after taking eight hits in the Lions’ 26-16 loss to the Vikings last month, was under constant pressure from Minnesota’s front seven today. \nSix Vikings split their seven sacks and Stafford went to the bench after one particularly disheartening series, got his left, non-throwing hand wrapped by trainers and returned the next series wearing a glove. \nThe Lions, owners of the worst record in the NFC at 1-6, face an equally bad Kansas City Chiefs team next Sunday in London. \nThe Chiefs (2-5) beat the Pittsburgh Steelers today. \nStafford completed his first seven passes for 128 yards, but finished just 18 of 26 for 256 yards and two touchdowns. \nThe Lions, coming off an 11-5 season, opened the game with two long touchdown drives and seemed to be picking up where they left off from last week’s 37-34 win over the Chicago Bears. \nStafford completed a 46-yard pass to Calvin Johnson on the third play of the game, hit Johnson for a 1-yard touchdown a few minutes later, and drove the Lions 80 yards in four plays on their second possession. \nBut the Vikings dominated the final three quarters, even as Adrian Peterson struggled to find consistent running lanes. \nPeterson finished with 97 yards on 18 carries, but 75 came on one carry midway through the third quarter. \nTeddy Bridgewater, meanwhile, picked apart the Lions secondary, completing 25 of 35 passes for a season-high 316 yards. \nHe threw a 1-yard touchdown to Kyle Rudolph just before halftime, a 36-yard touchdown to Stefon Diggs on the opening drive of the third quarter and led five field goal drives. \nThe Vikings (4-2) entered the game with the NFL’s worst passing offense, averaging just 179.6 yards per game. \nJohnson caught five passes for 86 yards for the Lions, who got outgained 140-77 on the ground. \nContact Dave Birkett: dbirkett@freepress.com.
