Richard, who’s in Grade 11, and the Plainsmen (2-5) used the slotback jet to perfection as he ran for 83 yards on 11 carries, including scoring runs of 13 and 11 yards. He ground out 112 yards during the previous six games. \n“That was awesome to get those touchdowns,” said Richard, who also caught four passes for 34 yards. “I couldn’t have (thought of a better day). That was incredible.” \nThe Plainsmen were fired up for Thursday’s contest and they showed it early. Richard opened the scoring midway through the first quarter with his 13-yard touchdown reception from quarterback Sam Esler. Cole Kardash forced a safety in the second quarter before Michael Olive kicked a 37-yard field goal and a single point to give the Plainsmen a 13-0 lead at the half. Olive also booted a convert. \nRichard scored on a rush in the third quarter and closed out the scoring with an 11-yard jaunt with 2:29 left to seal the win. Olive converted the first touchdown and added a rouge on a kickoff while Bryce Parnetta caught a two-point convert on the second. The Reivers scored all their points between Richard’s running scores. \n“The kids played tough and just believed in each other and it was nice to see,” said Crocus head coach Kevin Boyd. “They worked like hell and put up some points. Man our defence and special teams played well. \n“Last week when we were playing in (Winnipeg’s Investors Group Field) there, the kids really started to believe in themselves and showed that when they put in the extra effort that it pays off. We took the number one team in the Vidruk to the last play there and the kids got some belief in themselves from that.” \nEsler completed 10 of 19 passes for 124 yards and two interceptions, while Reilly Keele ran for 87 yards on 13 carries. Parnetta hauled in five passes for 62 yards. \nGary Gibbons led the defence with 10 tackles, while Kardash had three tackles and blocked a kick in addition to forcing the safety. Doug Wilkinson added four defensive tackles and one on special teams. \nAlthough they won their regular season finale, it wasn’t enough to keep the Plainsmen in the Tier 2 playoffs. Instead, they’ll drop to Tier 3. Where they’ll be seeded in the eight-team playoff and who they will face in the quarter-finals won’t be determined until Saturday. \nRegardless, Boyd is excited his team still gets to play at least one more game this season and thinks the Plainsmen are peaking at the right time. \n“We’re coming together,” he said. “We’re pretty good for injuries. We’ve got the attitude and we’re getting healthy bodies back and look out.” \nMeanwhile, the Vincent Massey Vikings (2-4) wrap up their regular season today when they visit the Steinbach Sabres (5-1). The Neelin Spartans (2-3) visit the Dryden Eagles (5-1) in the Andy Currie (A) Division today. \n» cjaster@brandonsun.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T11:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T15:46:07.527+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
