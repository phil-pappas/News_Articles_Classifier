He is expected at Saturday’s full-squad workout.\nRoughly half the team was on hand for Friday’s voluntary session. Position player regulars Lucas Duda, Travis d’Arnaud, Michael Conforto and Wilmer Flores made appearances, as did starting pitchers Jacob deGrom and Steven Matz.\nJuan Uribe, who was not on the Mets roster for either of the first two rounds of the playoffs due to a chest injury, took grounders and is scheduled to take batting practice Saturday. Still, manager Terry Collins seemed reluctant to place the 36-year-old on the 25-man roster for the World Series following a nearly month-long layoff.\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google Whatsapp Email Filed under juan uribe ,  new york mets ,  yoenis cespedes", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T17:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T04:12:35.624+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
