However, when such relationships occur in educational or supervisory contexts, they can present serious ethical concerns and compromise the University’s academic and work environment, in part due to an inherent power differential between the parties,” the policy reads.\n“The relationships can lead to charges of sexual harassment and exploitation, especially when the relationships end, or cause third parties to have concerns about undue advantage or restricted opportunities.”\nNew Mexico State University’s policy “strongly discourages consensual relationships” as they can “contain the potential for exploitation” of the student or employee. Adults in these relationships are instructed to alert a supervisor to structure grading or responsibility plans to avoid conflict of interest.\nCentral New Mexico Community College’s policy prohibits relationships between employees with authority and their subordinates, including teachers with students, coaches with players and bosses with staff.\nThe American Association of University Professors, however, says banning relationships isn’t practical or the preferred approach. The group suggests schools adopt a policy similar to UNM’s that strongly warns against such relationships and requires some sort of alert, according to the group’s policy suggestions website.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T08:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T13:29:02.236+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
