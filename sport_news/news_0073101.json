AP Source: Lack of written contract led to FIFA suspensions Associated Press | 0 comments \nZURICH (AP) — The lack of a written contract and a delay collecting payment led to the 90-day suspensions for Sepp Blatter and Michel Platini, a person familiar with the FIFA ethics case told The Associated Press on Monday. \nBlatter and Platini were handed 90-day bans last week after failing to provide written evidence to justify a payment of 2 million Swiss francs (about $2 million) that Platini received from FIFA in 2011 — nine years after the job was completed, according to the person. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because he wasn't authorized to speak publicly about the case. kAmq@E9 q=2EE6C[ E96 uxup AC6D:56?E[ 2?5 !=2E:?:[ 9:D 4@F?E6CA2CE 2E &tup[ 7246 =@?86C 32?D :7 E96 uxup 6E9:4D 4@>>:EE66 AC@G6D :ED 42D6 E@ 6E9:4D ;F586 w2?D\\y@249:> t4<6CE] %96 7F== G6C5:4ED 2C6 6IA64E65 367@C6 E96 h_\\52J DFDA6?D:@?D 6?5]k^Am kAmq@E9 56?J HC@?85@:?8 2?5 2C6 2AA62=:?8 282:?DE E96:C DFDA6?D:@?D]k^Am kAm%96 6E9:4D 42D6 H2D EC:886C65 3J q=2EE6C 2?5 !=2E:?: 364@>:?8 6>3C@:=65 :? 2 4C:>:?2= :?G6DE:82E:@? :? $H:EK6C=2?5 @G6C E96 D2>6 A2J>6?E] q=2EE6C H2D BF6DE:@?65 2D 2 DFDA64E 2?5 !=2E:?: :D 36:?8 :?G6DE:82E65 3J E96 $H:DD 2EE@C?6J 86?6C2= 2D D@>6E9:?8 36EH66? 2 H:E?6DD 2?5 2 DFDA64E]k^Am kAm%96 A2J>6?E C6=2E6D E@ E96 E:>6 H96? !=2E:?: H@C<65 7@C q=2EE6C 2D 2? 25G:D6C 7C@> `hhg F?E:= a__a[ H96?
