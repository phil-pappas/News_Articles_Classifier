That came just a minute after his brother, Andre Ayew of Swansea, was denied by United States goalkeeper Brad Guzan at the other end. \nBut Gylfi Sigurdsson equalized for Swansea six minutes later, whipping a free kick beyond Guzan from 30 yards, after he was fouled by Villa captain Micah Richards. \nAnd Swansea got the winner when Andre Ayew prodded in Kyle Naughton's cross in the 87th. \nVilla manager Sherwood has not won a league game since the opening day of the season against Bournemouth. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T18:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T20:20:25.785+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
