It was a tough one for me because I sat on the sidelines with a concussion. Our team really wanted to come out here and get some revenge.\" \nMcCloskey finished 11 of 19 for 202 yards and two touchdowns for the Patriots (6-0, 1-0). He added 106 yards and a touchdown on 17 carries. \nHis path toward vengeance started with extra meetings with GA's offensive coordinator Greg Isdaner during last week's bye. \n\"I felt like me and my receivers clicked,\" McCloskey said, \"and I met with my offensive coordinator about eight or nine times during the week, so we had a really good understanding of what would come at us.\" \nMcCloskey's game-changing, fourth-quarter touchdown toss was proof. \nThe deft touch-pass over an outstretched defender landed in the arms of Jimmy McAfee, who continued untouched down the seam for a 62-yard touchdown that extended the Patriots' lead to nine points. \nBefore the play began, Isdaner, who played briefly in the NFL after starring at West Virginia and Episcopal Academy, called an audible. \n\"We had a call for a running play,\" McCloskey said, \"but they showed full-press man (coverage). I was in the zone and ready to go until (Isdaner) yelled my name. I turned toward him and knew what he wanted right away.\" \nMcAfee finished with 105 yards on three receptions for the Patriots (6-0, 1-0). \nMatt Rahill led the offense for the the Blue Devils (4-2, 0-1) with 270 yards passing and two touchdowns. Jack Cucinotta caught eight passes for 119 yards and a touchdown. Matt Hoffman also grabbed eight receptions for 118 yards and a touchdown. \nGermantown Academy 7 7 0 7 - 21 \nSpringside Chestnut Hill 0 12 0 0 - 12 \nGA: Mike Patterson 29 pass from Kyle McCloskey (Vince Capone kick) \nSC: Jack Cucinotta 23 pass from Matt Rahill (kick failed) \nSC: Matt Hoffman 23 pass from Rahill (pass failed) \nGA: McCloskey 9 run (Capone kick) \nGA: Jimmy McAfee 62 pass from McCloskey (Capone kick)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T04:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T04:35:18.460+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
