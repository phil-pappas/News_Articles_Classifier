After the ever-consistent PR Sreejesh thwarted New Zealand A’s attempts from back-to-back penalty corners, India hit on the counter in the third minute. Ramandeep dribbled past a couple of opposition players before feeding Akashdeep, who coolly slotted it home to give his team a 1-0 lead. In the 20th minute, it was Ramandeep’s turn to put his name on the scorers’ list with a spectacular field goal as he left the host’s defence in complete tatters. Within six minutes, Nikkin got on the end of a Gurjinder Singh pass to make it 3-0. New Zealand did pull one back in the third quarter as they successfully converted a penalty corner in the 36th minute. In the fourth quarter, the Indians pushed hard for another goal. But despite enjoying majority of the possession, with the ball staying in the home side’s half, India failed to add another goal. India will again play against New Zealand A tomorrow at the same venue. The first match against the New Zealand senior team will be played at Nelson on October 6. — PTI", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T00:25:58.548+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
