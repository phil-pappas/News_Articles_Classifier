On a deep pass to tight end Martellus Bennett, Woodson undercut the route and picked it off to give the Raiders a chance. \nA penalty on the Raiders sideline forced Oakland to start at their its 9 and two big pass plays from Derek Carr to Michael Crabtree helped them push down the field. \nRoy Helu, who replaced Latavius Murray at running back after he fumbled a pitch and had a pass bounce off him for an interception, was stuffed on a third-and-2 play from the Bears' 22 to force the field goal attempt. \nJanikowski, who tied Tim Brown's Raiders record for all-time games played at 240, kicked a 41-yarder that gave Oakland the lead with 2:05 to go.
