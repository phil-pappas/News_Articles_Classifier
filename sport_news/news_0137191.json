The Rangers have a game Tuesday night at the Garden, but they were very aware that the biggest game of the week was taking place Monday night at Citi Field.\nRed-hot goaltender Henrik Lundqvist, who's preparing to make his fourth straight start for the undefeated Rangers (3-0-0) against the visiting Winnipeg Jets, is good friends with Mets starting pitcher Matt Harvey.\nLundqvist attended a game at Citi Field a couple of weeks ago and he said after Monday's practice in Greenburgh that he was planning his night around the Mets' Game 3 against the Los Angeles Dodgers as well - though he was undecided whether he'd be in the stands.\n\"I'll be watching for sure,\" Lundqvist said of the pivotal game in Queens. \"I just don't know where. I'd be more likely to go if we didn't have a game tomorrow, but we'll see. I was there a couple weeks ago. It was great. It's a really nice stadium.\"\nHarvey often supports Lundqvist from the Garden stands during Rangers games. The Mets pitcher even made the trip to Montreal for a Rangers playoff game in the 2014 Eastern Conference finals. So Lundqvist tries to return the favor when he can.\n\"You pay attention for sure to what he's doing,\" Lundqvist said of following Harvey's performances, \"but over the years I've gotten a lot more into American football, baseball. I enjoy it. Now a lot of the times I'm watching football on Sundays. Not all day, but I have it on. You never would have expected that, would you?\"\nHead coach Alain Vigneault didn't hesitate when asked if he were going to watch the Mets' Game 3.\n\"Damn right,\" he said, adding with a grin, \"Big slide (Saturday). I don't know much about baseball, but (Chase Utley's Game 2 takeout slide on Ruben Tejada) is borderline illegal if you ask me.\"\nLundqvist, meanwhile, continued to dazzle at Monday morning's practice. He made a stretching 2-on-1 save that caused defenseman Dan Girardi to tip his head back and wonder: \"Oh my God.\" Lundqvist has stopped 100 of 106 shots through three games, with a .943 save percentage and a 2.00 goals against average.\nVigneault said he is scratching struggling veteran defenseman Dan Boyle in favor of rookie Dylan McIlrath's season debut. Boyle makes $4.5 million but has continued to be the team's weakest defensive link.\n\"I think that Boyler can play a little bit better than he's played so far, but it probably has more to do with the fact that I want to see Dylan,\" the coach said.\nIn Boyle's absence, defenseman Kevin Klein will play on the point of the Blueshirts' first power play alongside Keith Yandle. Moving Klein there is a year overdue, just like Vigneault's addition of center Derek Stepan to the second unit's point to open this season.\nLundqvist said on Dec. 10, 2014, that Klein \"has the best shot on the team, no question.\" Last season, Klein scored seven of his nine goals last season in the Rangers' first 30 games. He already scored his first goal of this season on a 6-on-5 delayed-penalty finish in Wednesday night's opening win in Chicago.\nFourth-line winger Tanner Glass, meanwhile, convinced the coach to change Tuesday night's original plan by playing a \"real strong game\" in his debut Saturday night. So Glass will stay in the lineup over Jesper Fast.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T00:19:08.077+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
