But Stoops pointed out that the Sooners beat Texas last season and four of the last five seasons, but that didn't take the edge off last season's 8-5 finish after opening the season 4-0.\n\"Like you're going to do something different for the rivalry week,\" Stoops said, \"which then tells your players that this game is more important than the one before it and the one after it.\n\"Around here, let's face it ... everyone use to say, 'well if you'll just beat Texas'... Well that doesn't go. We beat 'em last year, and I didn't hear anyone patting us on the back after the season. ... The only way to win them all and keep winning is to do the same things every week.\"\nOn Twitter:\n @kHairopoulos", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/kHairopoulos"], "published": "2015-10-07T03:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T06:40:32.169+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
