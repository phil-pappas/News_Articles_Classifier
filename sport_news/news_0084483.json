Friekh helped pave the way for 644 yards of total offense, of which 368 came on the ground. The Wildcats allowed only one sack, picked up 6.3 yards per carry on 58 attempts, and scored five rushing touchdowns led by Orlando Bradford, who had three. \nSenior safety Will Parks collected the team’s Defensive Player of the Week award for another strong performance in the secondary. Parks, Arizona’s leading tackler on the season, registered five stops and broke up a pair of passes against the Beavers. Included was one of the plays of the year when Parks delivered a jarring hit to break up a pass in the second quarter. On the ensuing play, Anthony Fotu intercepted a pass deep inside Oregon State territory, and one play later Bradford punched in a touchdown for a commanding 27-7 lead. \nSenior punter Drew Riggleman again turned in a steady effort to earn Special Teams Player of the Week honors. Riggleman punted only three times, but collected 161 yards on his three boots, including a 61-yarder. Two of his three punts were downed inside the 20-yardline, providing critical field position for the Wildcats. He also was the holder on Casey Skowron’s three field goals and five extra point kicks. \nScout Team Player of the Week honors went to freshman lineman Nathan Eldridge (offense), freshman corner Malik Moody (defense) and freshman safety Nick Fadelli (special teams). \nThe team’s Hard Edge Player of the Week was fullback Jamardre Cobb, while freshman defensive lineman Shariff Williams was named the Student of the Week. Senior offensive lineman David Catalano was recognized with the Community Service Award. \nArizona (4-2, 1-2 Pac-12) travels to Boulder, Colo., to take on Colorado (3-3, 0-2 Pac-12) on Saturday, Oct. 17. Kickoff is slated for 7 p.m. (MDT) with a live television broadcast on FOX Sports 1. \nCopyright 2015 Arizona Athletics.
