Radley also contributed 15 points with the boot. \nMuscat now travels to Doha, Qatar to take on Doha 2 for its third match of the league on October 9. \nThe Gulf Premiership is a competition featuring five teams, with the matches being played on a home-and-away basis. It is an entry level meet for new West Asian rugby clubs aspiring to vie for the West Asia title. \nMuscat, Bahrain, Doha 1, Doha 2 and Kuwait's Q8 Scorpions are the five teams in fray this year.
