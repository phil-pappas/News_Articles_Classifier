Cara Bonshak (lehighvalleylive.com file photo) \n“I love the campus, the coaches, and the team, and all the facilities are great,” Bonshak said Tuesday nigh when the Zephyrs dropped a 3-0 Eastern Pennsylvania Conference decision to unbeaten Emmaus . “I like the idea of going to a big school.” \nBonshak is one of four Whitehall athletes playing soccer and field hockey this fall. The others are Kyle Cunningham, Kassidy Cunningham and Taylor George. Bonshak, Kylie Cunningham and George have made soccer their primary sport this fall. Kassidy Cunningham has chosen field hockey as her primary sport. \nBonshak explained her reasoning for choosing soccer over field hockey this season. \n“I primaried field hockey my freshman and sophomore years so I wanted to even it out,” said Bonshak, who is undecided on what sport she’ll primary next year as a senior. “I really enjoyed the success I had last year in soccer.” \nRELATED : Rapid recap: Emmaus field hockey team tops Whitehall \nBonshak has had just one conflict on game days this season when field hockey and girls soccer both played Pocono Mountain West on Sept. 24. Bonshak was obligated to play the soccer game, which Whitehall won 3-1. The field hockey team apparently didn’t need her that day because the Zephyrs also defeated the Panthers in that sport 5-0. \nHowever, Bonshak’s importance to the field hockey squad is invaluable, according to coach Jenn Bodnar. \n“Cara is a great player,” Bodnar said. “She really plays hard running to the ball. She’s a captain this year and was even a captain as a sophomore, which is a testament to her leadership.” \nBonshak also competes for the True North Field Hockey Club, which is based in Doylestown, Pa. It’s through that organization where she came in contact with Michigan State. \n“I visited the campus and went to several tournaments and camps (at MSU),” Bonshak said. \nAlthough Bonshak is smallish in stature, Bodnar is confident Bonshak has the tools to play at the major college level. \n“Her style of play is really conducive to Big 10 hockey,” Bodnar said. “She’s not the biggest player, but she makes up for it with her size and determination. She’s one of the toughest players I’ve seen.” \nUnlike soccer, Bonshak explains that it doesn’t matter how big or small you are to play field hockey. \n“Field hockey is a low-to-the-ground sport,” Bonshak said. “You have to be in an athletic stance at all times.” \nBodnar says Bonshak’s ratio of 21 goals and two assists are misleading. \n“She finishes around the circle and scores goals, but she gets her teammates involved, too,” Bodnar said. “She’s an unselfish player, and she’s smart. She’s one of those players that lifts everybody else’s game.” \nTom Hinkel may be reached at thinkel@lehighvalleylive.com . Follow him on Twitter @TomHinkelLV .
