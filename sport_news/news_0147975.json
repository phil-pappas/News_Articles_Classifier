On Gurmeet Ram Rahim stating that he was willing to visit Golden Temple for peace, they said Darbar Sahib was the only religious shrine where anyone could pay obeisance irrespective of religion, caste and creed. “In this context, his offer (to visit Golden Temple) holds no water,” they said. “He must come to Akal Takht in person and tender an apology in clear words for his blasphemous act and pledge not to repeat the same in future,” they added. Dal Khalsa chief HS Dhami and his Akali Dal (Panch Pardhani) counterpart Kulbeer Singh Barapind gave a clarion call to the Sikh diaspora to give a “befitting panthic response” to the religio-political leadership running the affairs of the Akali Dal, SGPC and the Akal Takht. “What’s the utility of constituting the committee after issuing a clean chit to the head of a heretical cult for his sacrilegious act? What relevance will the committee hold when a large section of the Sikhs have already rejected the so-called pardon decision?” they questioned. They took a dig at the Akali leadership for offering “hollow” and “vague” reasoning in pardoning Ram Rahim. “It’s being argued that for the sake of peace and harmony in the region, it was necessary to end the animosity between Sikhs and Sirsa dera.” DSGMC extends support to Akal Takht Amritsar: Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee (DSGMC) president Manjeet Singh GK along with his office-bearers on Friday met Akal Takht Jathedar Giani Gurbachan Singh and assured him full support over the Sikh clergy’s move to grant pardon to the Dera Sacha Sauda chief. Talking to mediaspersons, GK said, “We are here to express our support on behalf of the DSGMC and Singh Sabhas of New Delhi to the Akal Takht’s decision on granting pardon to the Dera chief. We feel that this move is in the interest of the Sikh community and for ensuring peace in Punjab.” He said the Sikh clergy had pardoned the Dera chief as he had “accepted the supremacy of the Akal Takht and apologised” for what he had done. — TNS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T00:06:32.875+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
