But the Golden Eagle pair is still firmly on that path by playing some seriously stellar tennis. \nChampions of the Tri-Eastern Conference and the sectional, Kissick and Lanich continue their postseason push Saturday at Fishers. They will face John Bickle and Caleb Jones of Heritage Christian at 10 a.m. \nThe winners of that match advance to play Center Grove's Ryan Stemle and Tye Thixton for a regional championship at 2 p.m. with a berth in the state finals on the line. \n\"We just have to go into it how we've been lately. We haven't lost in a while. We're going in with the same mindset,\" Kissick said. \"Just get in, play our best and hopefully everything happens right.\" \nA lot of things have happened right for the Golden Eagles. \nThey are 20-3 and avenged two of those losses at some point later in the season. Kissick and Lanich overturned defeats to Hagerstown and Richmond, with both those wins helping the Golden Eagles net championships. \n\"I thought we would continue to get better,\" Lanich said. \"I didn't think we'd make it this far, to be honest.\" \nLongtime Lincoln coach Elizabeth Wonsetler had confidence the two could become contenders. \nKissick played No. 2 singles a year ago, and Lanich was at No. 2 doubles. For his senior season, though, Kissick wanted to try doubles with its faster pace and quick points. \nSo Wonsetler saw an opportunity to pair Kissick with a player who already had doubles experience in the junior Lanich. \n\"You have to find two guys who want to play together, who I think are going to be a good team together,\" Wonsetler said, noting the two were friends already. \"I really felt they could complement each other with net play, primarily. But they're also great servers and they're great at returning serves. That's how you win at doubles. \n\"I thought they had the potential to win the TEC at No. 1 doubles. That's without knowing how good the other teams were. When they came back and were able to defeat Richmond after having lost the first time to them, I knew they had matured in their ability to work together.\" \nThe Golden Eagles halted Richmond's No. 1 doubles team 6-0, 7-5 in the first round of the sectional. Kissick and Lanich then went on to a 6-0, 6-2 victory over Rushville to claim the sectional title. \nThat put them in the regional, and Wonsetler believes it's the first time representatives from Lincoln's boys tennis program reached that level in at least a decade. \n\"They are a dynamic team to watch. They are a fun team to watch,\" she said. \"They take the net and dominate the net, which is really how you win good doubles. They both see the court really well. They see the open court. That enables them to hit passing shots, and also enables them to hit angle volleys.\" \nLincoln's last loss came on Sept. 14, in three sets, to Centerville. The Golden Eagles rebounded from that defeat to win three matches in the TEC tournament, followed by a 2-0 sectional record. \nKissick and Lanich are multi-sport athletes. Both play basketball in the winter while Kissick also plays baseball in the spring. \nThey each tabbed tennis as the favorite of their sports. \n\"It was a little bit challenging at first,\" Lanich said of the adjustment at No. 1 doubles. \"After a couple of weeks, I got into the groove.\" \nAdded Kissick: \"All I've wanted to do in my high school career in all three sports I've played is (win) TEC and sectional, and to get both of them is amazing.\" \nFishers is one of four regional sites, along with Bedford North Lawrence, Kokomo and LaPorte. Regional champions advance to the state finals Oct. 23-24 at Park Tudor. \n\"We'd always joke about being state bound and everything,\" Kissick said. \"Now after all the success and getting ready for Saturday, honestly we could and that's exciting.\" \nJosh Chapin: (765) 973-4463 jchapin@pal-item.com or twitter.com/JoshChapinPI \nAt a Glance \nWhat: IHSAA individual boys tennis regional \nWhen/where: Saturday at Fishers \nMatch 1: Jacob Kissick and Austin Lanich (Lincoln) vs. John Bickle and Caleb Jones (Heritage Christian), 10 a.m. \nMatch 2: Match 1 winner vs. Ryan Stemle and Tye Thixton (Center Grove), 2 p.m. \nNext: Regional champion advances to state finals Oct. 23-24 at Park Tudor 75 CONNECT 4 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://pinews.co/1LuD58N TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T04:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T09:05:12.592+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
