(Mike Stobe / Getty Images) Dylan Hernandez and Bill Shaikin Contact Reporters \nDon Mattingly is out as Dodgers manager. \nA person with knowledge of negotiations between the Dodgers and Mattingly, who still had one year remaining on his contract, said the parting was amicable and was a mutual decision. \nCalls to Mattingly and his agent were not immediately returned, and the Dodgers have not made an official comment. \nWith Mattingly as manager, the Dodgers won three consecutive National League West championships for the first time in franchise history. But even with baseball's biggest payroll, the club never advanced to the World Series, losing in the division series twice and league championship series once. \nIn five seasons at the helm, Mattingly accumulated an overall record of 446-363, a .551 winning percentage. \nMattingly wishes to continue managing, a person close to him said Thursday morning. The Miami Marlins are looking for a manager and are known to be interested in the former Yankees first baseman. The San Diego Padres, Washington Nationals and Seattle Mariners also have managing vacancies.

Chicago Cubs bench coach Dave Martinez and former Padres manager Bud Black are also considered possibilities. \nThe details of Mattingly's split with the Dodgers are unclear. The team is expected to officially announce the decision later Thursday, according to Jon Heyman of CBS Sports, who first reported the move. \nMattingly was known to have a good relationship with controling owner Mark Walter, and he seemed to go along with the analytically based decisions made by first-year baseball boss Andrew Friedman and general manager Farhan Zaidi. \nContrary to media reports that Mattingly turned down the club's offer of an extension, a person with knowledge of the situation said no formal offer was ever made because the sides agreed to part ways before the negotiations went that far. \nMattingly received a contract extension in 2014 after he expressed frustration about the possibility he would have to guide the team as a lame duck. \n\"Really what it does, it puts me in a spot where everything I do is questioned because I'm basically trying out or auditioning to say, 'Can he manage or can he not manage?' To me, it's at that point where, three years in, you either know or don't.\" \nThe Dodgers appear headed for a busy offseason. The team faces the probability that co-ace Zack Greinke will opt out of the final three years of his contract, leaving the team in need of at least one more front-line starting pitcher. \nThe team will also likely look to remake -- for the second straight year -- its bullpen, and needs to find a starting infielder and settle on what is still a crowded outfield. \nMORE ON THE DODGERS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T18:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T19:19:15.456+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
