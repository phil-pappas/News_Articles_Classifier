(AP Photo/Mark Tenally) more > By Zac Boyer - The Washington Times   \nASHBURN — Colt McCoy greeted an inquiry about the cut on his left foot with one of his own. \n“Want to see it?” the Washington Redskins’ backup quarterback asked, before holding up a photo of the glued-together wound on his phone. \nMcCoy was attempting to cut tape off his left foot following Thursday’s game when he lacerated the arch. The wound, which had to be glued back together, kept McCoy off his feet for the next two days and out of practice on Monday as a precautionary measure. \n“I was fine today,” McCoy said following practice. “Today was more of a day where I could start trusting it, and as I went, it got better and better, so I don’t foresee any problems.” \nCornerback Chris Culliver was limited in practice with what coach Jay Gruden described as “soreness in his knee and his quad and a little bit in his groin.” \nDefensive end Kedric Golston (broken hand) and center Josh LeRibeus (strained left calf) were limited in practice on Wednesday, and cornerback DeAngelo Hall (sprained toe on right foot), wide receiver DeSean Jackson (strained left hamstring) and inside linebacker Perry Riley (strained left calf) did not practice at all. \nCenter Kory Lichtensteiger (unspecified finger injury) and right tackle Morgan Moses (sprained right knee and sprained left elbow), as well as McCoy, were able to complete a full practice.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T00:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T01:27:38.993+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
