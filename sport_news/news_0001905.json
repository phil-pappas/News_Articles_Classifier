The Wing-T, an offensive scheme more than a century old, utilizes deception and a majority of running plays. It’s a high school football staple. In area leagues, you can see Lodi, Oakdale and East Union run iterations of it. Yet, the shotgun spread, track meet offenses have revolutionized the game, even though it’s taking longer to permeate through high school as it has in college. With that in mind, it’s no surprise that 2015 appears to be the year of the quarterback in the area. In some cases, it’s not a surprise. McNair senior Osai Brown showed the area football scene his worth last season with 33 touchdown passes. This season, he’s amassed 1,799 yards and 24 touchdowns — among the best in the state — through half the season. Yet, many of the top field generals in the area departed. St. Mary’s Noah Righetti, Tracy’s Michael Brown, Tokay’s Grayson Dillon, Chavez’s Julius Davila and Sierra’s Devin Nunez all graduated. Davila’s successor, senior Keith Dosier, already had impacted the Titans as a middle linebacker. But in coach John Ward’s West Coast, shotgun spread hybrid offense, he’s not only putting up big numbers at quarterback, but doing it with accuracy. Dosier went 12 of 15 for more than 250 yards and three touchdowns in Chavez’s 53-7 drubbing of Vallejo on Friday. Tokay junior Jared Zermeno has 820 passing yards, with 10 touchdowns to three interceptions. At St. Mary’s, junior Jake Dunniway has been unfazed replacing the reigning All-Area Player of the Year in Righetti. Dunniway is completing 61 percent of his passes, with nine touchdowns and three interceptions. Part of the contrast that truly makes this the year of the quarterback, is a lack of statistical monsters at tailback and on defense. Sure, there’s Brookside Christian linebacker Sione Liku, who leads the state with 116 total tackles. And West running back Marcel Dancy, second in the section with 1,093 rushing yards and 16 touchdowns. Last season, St. Mary’s linebacker Khalil Hodge led the nation in tackles, Ripon Christian lineman Will Kamps recorded more than a sack per game, and Chavez’s Priest Jennings and Sierra’s Mark Paule Jr. posted sometimes-astronomical rushing numbers. This year, the headline-grabbers have been dual-threat quarterbacks, such as East Union’s Jack Weaver and Sierra’s Mark Vicente, upstarts like Dosier and Zermeno, and the incredible hurler Brown. Last season, it was hard to fit all of the worthy running backs into our All-Area spots. This year, some capable quarterbacks will be omitted. And this trend may continue, whether or not the running backs deliver bigger games in the latter half of the season. Weaver is still a junior, sophomore Gino Campiotti is who Manteca coach Eric Reis calls “the future of the program” at the position, and Lincoln junior Aaron Thomas has some monster games ahead of him. SUSD fights substance abuse Last week, I released a column about a nonprofit organization called Sober Youth Inc., headed by former Stockton resident Dwayne McAfee and Lincoln High grad Tyronne Gross, which fights underage alcohol and drug abuse. Especially for student-athletes. I also should’ve included the effort from Stockton Unified School District and Chavez High, which has a Clean and Sober Teens (CAST) club, and which works with the California Highway Patrol’s “Every 15 Minutes” program. The district itself provides prevention curriculum for 7th and 8th graders, “Students in Prevention” peer educators in high schools, Peer Leaders Leading Students (PLUS) and more student assistance programs. Also, according to the California Health Kids Survey, alcohol use has declined among SUSD students since 2008, particularly among 11th graders where reported drinking is below the state average, the district’s communications and marketing director Dianne Barth said in an email. Power rankings Starting this week, I’ll include my football large- and small-school power rankings, as well as a volleyball top 5.
