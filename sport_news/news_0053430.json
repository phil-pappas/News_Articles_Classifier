Widespread protests have been witnessed in the region with activists blocking roads causing inconvenience to people. Panthpreet Singh, Ranjit Singh Dhadrianwale and Giani Kewal Singh, during a press conference here, said they would lift blockades at various places and start protest afresh from Sunday. This was being done to avoid inconvenience to commoners and travellers. “All scattered protests will be called off after performing ‘ardas’ this evening and a systematic agitation will be launched from October 18,” said Panthpreet. One road in each district would be blocked every day from 10 am to 1 pm. The venue of protest would change every day, they said. The revised protest would continue till October 25, when the bhog ceremony of those killed in police firing would be held. The main blockade at Bargari would, however, continue, they said. They said the blockades at various places were causing harassment to farmers, students, employees and transporters. “We do not want to trouble them in any manner. Otherwise, they would turn against us,” said Panthpreet. The leaders were part of 15 religious and other oganisation who had been booked following violence over the death of protesters in Faridkot district on October 14. The police had lodged a case of attempted murder against the leaders. Deputy Chief Minister Sukhbir Singh Badal had later asked the police to drop the case. Panthpreet said the act of sacrilege was “a nefarious design by hired men of some agencies to revive violence”. He claimed the decision to revise their protest was their own, and that there was no pressure from the government. He said the coalition government in the state had failed to arrest the culprits involved in the desecration of Guru Granth Sahib. Panthpreet urged members of all gurdwara committees to install high-resolution CCTV cameras to prevent reoccurrence of such acts. They also urged the government to provide security outside gurdwaras across the state. Voices of dissent emerged soon after the announcement was made. A group led by Amrik Singh of Damdami Taksal, Ajnala, and Sukhwinder Singh, president, Satkar Sabha, Haryana, opposed the reshaping of protests. “What is the point in withdrawing blockades? On the first day of protest, it was decided that blockades would not be lifted until the culprits were arrested. The decision has been taken without taking the ‘sangat’ into confidence,” said Amrik. Initially, a section of protesters announced its displeasure at the “withdrawal” of protests. Baba Baljit Singh Daduwal later said he would support the “collective decision”.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T04:16:49.754+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
