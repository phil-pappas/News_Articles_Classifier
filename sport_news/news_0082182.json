Only 33 percent of demolished homes had asbestos removed, when industry officials say 80 to 90 percent of homes being demolished have asbestos.\nBy contrast, a much higher portion of Southwest Washington homes had asbestos removed before demolition than Portland: 55 percent. The difference: Southwest Washington has a far more comprehensive system for documenting asbestos removal.\n A Washington official was among the experts that Oregon's environmental regulatory agency invited to speak on Monday.\nIf a house is demolished with asbestos-containing materials inside, that can release asbestos fibers into the air. People who breathe them are at risk of developing numerous fatal diseases later in life.\nEnvironmental regulators believe about 650 homes a year are demolished in Oregon with asbestos in place.\nAlthough the requirements of the bill, filed by Sen. Michael Dembrow, D.-Portland, are quite precise, experts invited by the department quickly made calls for more action from the state.\nThe department convened about two dozen people involved with asbestos, including an official with the Portland's Bureau of Development Services, construction contractors, and representatives of construction industry associations.\nThe bill doesn't require contractors to check homes for asbestos before renovations, which some at the meeting said are as much, if not more of a hazard as demolition.\n\"In all reality, it creates greater risk\" than demolition said John Mayer, who owns and runs the asbestos-removal company Lake Oswego Insulation. In the case of the latter, asbestos can disperse in the air if it isn't removed properly. But in the case of a renovation, those asbestos fibers stay inside with the people living there.\nDepartment officials said that the discussion of the day was limited to the scope of Dembrow's bill, with a more comprehensive review of the asbestos rules planned for 2017.\nStill, a number of experts called for asbestos inspections to be tied to demolition permits. Right now, contractors don't have to submit asbestos inspection reports to anybody in the state or prove they've checked for asbestos before demolishing a house.\nIf a copy of the asbestos inspection report had to be submitted, \"it would be a lot more security that it was actually done,\" said Nancy Thorington of the Portland Bureau of Development Services.\nSome counties in Southwest Washington require proof that contractors checked for and removed asbestos before issuing a demolition permit. To do that, contractors first have to go to the agency responsible for the region's asbestos enforcement, Southwest Clean Air Agency.\nOne of its inspectors, Gerry Strawn, told the department those requirements work well in southwest Washington. He regularly gets calls from people saying they were told to call his agency before they could get a demolition permit, he said.\nClaudia Davis, an asbestos official with Oregon's Department of Environmental Quality, said the agency doesn't have the statutory authority to create such a requirement.\nDepartment officials at Monday's meeting declined to answer questions from The Oregonian/OregonLive, and a department spokeswoman was not able to answer questions in time for publication.\nThis isn't the first time environmental regulators have tried to require inspections before demolitions.\nIn 2002, the department's governing board approved a rule change that required asbestos inspections before all demolitions and renovations in the state. That rule change was repealed months after it was supposed to take effect because of industry opposition.\nAt the time, the department promised to revisit the rules and find an alternative to the inspection requirement that would both protect the public and take into account industry concerns. That never happened.\nIf the department's estimates are correct, that would imply that thousands of homes have been demolished with asbestos in place since then.\n-- Fedor Zarkhin\nfzarkhin@oregonian.com\n503-294-7674; @fedorzarkhin", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T02:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T06:04:49.902+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
