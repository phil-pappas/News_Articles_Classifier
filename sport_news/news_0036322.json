He was also there when they were doing the same at the World Championships, World Cups and other continental tournaments.\n\"If you look at the results I think they (shooters) have done very well and nobody would like to say no to them now for whatever they require. Be it the Sports Authority of India or the Sports Ministry, they have been very helpful, and they will continue to support,\" the affable Keralite said.\nHe added, \"They deserve the appreciation. Now, we should train each shooter as per her or his individual needs. Everyone is different, and they have to be guided in the right manner and in the right direction.\"\nThomas quit his job as coach when he offered his resignation to the National Rifle Association of India (NRAI) in 2012. He was then appointed as life vice-president of the national federation, as he always wanted to be actively involved with the sport.\nThomas was at the helm when Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore brought home a silver medal in double trap in the 2004 Athens Olympics and rifle ace Abhinav Bindra did one better in the next Games in Beijing, winning a historic gold.\nVijay Kumar (25m rapid fire) and Gagan Narang (10m air rifle) capped off Thomas' journey on a good note, winning a silver and a bronze, respectively at the 2012 London Games.\nAccording to Thomas, the confidence of Indian shooters is on a different level altogether right now.\n\"It's different now. The confidence is high and they are not bothered thinking about how many medals can we win or how many Olympic quotas. We have a standing now in international shooting,\" the Dronacharya awardee said on the sidelines of the 8th Asian Air Gun Championship at the Karni Singh Shooting Range here.\nIndia have so far secured eight quota places for the 2016 Rio Olympic Games and Thomas is confident that the country would win a few more at the upcoming Asian Shooting Championship.\n\"It's difficult to say how many but I am sure we will win some more and may be go beyond the 11 we had before London Olympics,\" he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T09:42:45.777+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
