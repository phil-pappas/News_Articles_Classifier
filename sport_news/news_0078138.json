(Karl Merton Ferron / Baltimore Sun) Edward Lee Contact Reporter The Baltimore Sun RB Lamont Brown III to sit out second straight year for Morgan State football after tearing left ACL. \nFor the second season in a row, Morgan State running back Lamont Brown III is out for the remainder of the year after suffering a torn ACL. \nThe redshirt junior, who missed the 2014 campaign after sustaining the same injury to his right knee in the season opener, tore the ACL in his left knee in the third quarter of a 42-3 demolition of Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference foe Savannah State at Hughes Stadium in Baltimore on Oct. 10. \nAfter that game, Brown had expressed optimism that the injury was minor, but he did not play in Saturday’s 20-10 loss to Hampton at home, and coach Lee Hull revealed the extent of the season-ending ailment Tuesday. \nThe injury saps the Bears of their No. 2 tailback, who averaged 5.0 yards per carry with 230 yards on 46 carries, and Hull acknowledged that Brown’s absence will impact the offense’s running attack. \n“It definitely affects it, but we’re next man up,” Hull said. “[Junior fullback] Marcolm Banks is the next guy up. So he’ll be in the rotation with [redshirt sophomore running back] Orlando Johnson. I feel comfortable with those two guys handling the load.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T19:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T20:09:22.814+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
