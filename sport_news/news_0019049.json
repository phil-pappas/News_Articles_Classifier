Well, not literally, but the budget for her costume is higher than the production cost of the film. Not literally again! Now, costume of an actress is one department that a Hindi film just can’t ignore. It has to be grand no matter how much they have to loosen their purse strings. Following the suit, this opulence on dresses finds favour in Punjabi film industry as well. The Punjaban and non-Punjaban pretty faces wouldn’t settle for just about a Patiala salwaar kameez or a phulkari, read it dresses, gowns, western wear, anything that is super stylish. If you have had the chance to see Surveen Chawla’s Punjabi film Hero, you couldn’t have missed her designer dresses! So, till the time they get some meaty roles to flaunt, they definitely have asymmetrical cuts to show off! Wear about\nGladly, Punjabi films have come to terms with the fact that apart from shooting a scene at an exotic location, spending money on the actor doubling as singer, they need to shift the radar on the costumes of their actresses. “Costumes certainly play an important role for every film, they define a character. There is no denying the fact that the costumes for Punjabi actresses is given more than importance than what they used to get,” shares filmmaker Rohit Jugraj. From designer suits it is designer dresses now. Leading actresses Neeru Bajwa, Mandy Takhar, Surveen Chawla, Japji Khaira, Sonam Bajwa, Simran Mundi, Esha Reikhi have flaunted some wow costumes for their films. Cut to cut\nYou can’t expect an actress to be walking in a short skirt if she is playing the role of a village girl. This makes costume designer Simi Gill from Muktsar now based in Ludhiana smile, as she mockingly shares, “Even if she plays a village girl, every actress would demand a dream song sequence in an exotic locale where she can get a chance to wear some nice western dress.” This is precisely the reason why filmmakers have also increased the budget of the costumes of their leading ladies. Surveen Chawla is known for her exceptionally stylish on screen clothes. In all her Punjabi films, Singh Vs Kaur, Disco Singh, Hero Naam Yaad Rakhin she has worn the best of costumes. The pretty actress does most of the ideation of her styling herself, “Once I know my character, I try to visualise how I would look, it’s like getting under the skin of the character.” Even when Punjabi films have started hiring costume designers who are present on the shoot as well, most actresses do end up bringing out a good number of dresses out of their closet. Punjabi actress Diljott recommends her own designs, if it fits the bill of the producer. “I wouldn’t force the director to make me wear designer gowns if my role doesn’t demand so. But if I am playing a college girl, I would certainly like to wear costumes which are stylish.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T00:02:18.618+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
