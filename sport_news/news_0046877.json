Vikas has a very tough bout next up as he will be up against fourth-seeded Tomasz Jablonski, a European Championships silver-medallist.\n\nVikas had won a bronze medal at the 2011 edition of the event - only the second Indian to do so after Vijender Singh. The Haryana-lad dominated his bout against an immensely jittery rival and won by a unanimous decision.\n\n\"Both Shiva and Vikas dominated their bouts in the first two rounds and took it easy in the third for obvious reasons. They have tough opponents in the next round but fingers crossed for a good result,\" national coach Gurbax Singh Sandhu said.\n\nHowever, it was curtains for Manoj Kumar (64kg) in the very first round as he was stunned 1-2 to Moroccon Abdelhak Aatakni.\n\nThe former Commonwealth Games gold-medallist was surprisingly rusty in the opening round and the loss of momentum cost him dearly.\n\nHis movement sluggish in the first two rounds, Manoj gathered himself in the final three minutes but the comeback was a tad too late as Aatakni clinched the bout.\n\nNeeding to win either a gold or silver to be assured of a Rio Olympics berth, for L Devendro Singh the script did not go the way he had hoped for as he was shown the door by Britain's Harvey Horn in men's light fly 46-49kg category. \n\nHorn, a European Championships silver-medallist, won on points 2-1. \n\nIt was always going to be a difficult task for the 23-year-old London Olympics quarter-finalist from India and at one point was bleeding from his forehead. \n\nThe World Championships is the first qualifying tournament for next year's Rio Olympic Games.
