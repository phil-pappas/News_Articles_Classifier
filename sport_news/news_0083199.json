Just let it happen and it did.\"\nRoyals relievers Kelvin Herrera, Ryan Madson and Wade Davis shut down the Astros in the final three innings. Herrera picked up the victory and Davis logged his first postseason save.\nHarris, the fourth of six Astros pitchers, took the loss.\nThe Astros jumped out to a 4-1 lead but managed just two singles after the third inning.\nBoth starters -- Astros left-hander Scott Kazmir and Royals right-hander Johnny Cueto -- were acquired in late July trades to bolster their club's chances for the postseason.\nKazmir departed after 5 1/3 innings, charged with three runs, five hits and a walk.\n\"From the first pitch of the game I felt I had good command of all my pitches,\" Kazmir said. \"I was able to give the hitters a different look. I felt great. I felt I was getting stronger as the game was going on.\"\nCueto had a shaky first three innings, permitting four runs and six hits, including a home run by Rasmus, but only one hit after that. Cueto's final line was four runs, seven hits and three walks in six innings.\n\"I felt strong,\" Cueto said via an interpreter. \"I felt like I was aggressive. Obviously this was a very important game that I had to go out and perform for my team.\n\"I didn't feel any pressure at all. I knows the magnitude of the trade and I know why I was brought here. I take a lot of pride in my stuff and a lot of pride in helping my club win.\"\nThe Astros again struck early and often, seizing a 4-2 lead after three innings.\nRasmus doubled with two outs in the first, scoring right fielder George Springer, who had walked. Rasmus has an extra-base hit in his first six postseason games, a major league record.\n\"I feel blessed,\" Rasmus said. \"The Good Lord is with me. It's just one of those things.\n\"I'm just playing and not thinking about no records or none of that stuff. I'm just loving the game right now and trying to help these boys win a ball game.\"\nBut the Royals got the win, scoring three runs in the sixth and seventh inning to pull out a badly needed victory.\n(Editing by Andrew Both)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T06:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T06:00:24.308+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
