(AP) â€” Early interest in the Green Bay Packers' proposal for an entertainment, retail and residential district around Lambeau Field has the franchise already thinking of expanding its plans. \nThe Packers announced recently it plans to develop the Titletown District on 34 acres around the stadium, including 30 to 50 townhouses overlooking a public plaza. Packers vice president Ed Policy says interest in the development could mean as many as 70 townhouses. \nThe team's plan includes a four-star hotel, Hinterland Brewery and a sports medicine clinic west of Lambeau Field. Policy says there's also been a lot of interest in 180,000 square feet of commercial space on the north side of the district. The Packers have already been talking with prospective tenants. \nPress-Gazette Media ( http://gbpg.net/1Ob0gr0 ) reports Packers CEO Mark Murphy wants a specialty grocer within walking distance of the townhouses. \n___ \nInformation from: Press-Gazette Media, http://www.greenbaypressgazette.com More Headlines", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T16:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T17:59:59.467+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
