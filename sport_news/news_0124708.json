The Amerks used four third period tallies to break open a 2-2 game after 40 minutes of play to avoid the preseason sweep by their newest division rivals. Binghamton opened the scoring 8:57 into the first period when Ryan Dzingel skated behind the Amerks crease and fed a streaking Eric O’Dell who one-timed the puck past Nathan Lieuwen. Tobias Lindberg picked up the secondary assist after starting the breakout from the neutral zone. Justin Bailey evened the score at one apiece with the first of three power-play goals on the night for Rochester with just fewer than eight minutes to play in the opening frame to send the teams to the locker room tied. Cole Schneider regained the lead for Binghamton just 2:28 into the second after receiving a backhanded cross-crease feed from Nick Paul before one-timing the puck past Lieuwen to make it 2-1. The Amerks answered with exactly seven minutes to play in the period when Evan Rodrigues wristed a shot that beat the B-Sens Scott Greenham clean over the glove to even the score at 2-2. Rochester began the final frame on the power-play following a late second period tripping call and quickly took advantage. Matthew Ellis poked home a loose puck in front of Greenham to make it 3-2 Rochester before Jean Dupuy caught the B-Sens defense sleeping just 20 seconds later to push the score to 4-2. Goals from William Carrier at 7:23 and Jerome Leduc on the power play at 10:42 pushed the final score to 6-2 Rochester . Bailey, Dupuy, Ellis and Leduc all finished with a goal and an assist while Phil Varone and Allan McPherson each chipped in two assists to lead the visitors. Greenham stopped 28 of 34 shots faced in the losing effort.
