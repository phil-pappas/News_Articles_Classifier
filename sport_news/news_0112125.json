I had to leave one out. \n\"I make the decision I think is best for the team on the day. I am accountable on the results of my team and the way we play football.\" \nHowever, when asked about Jose Mourinho's latest jibes about the pressure Wenger may or may not face at Arsenal, he said: \"Stop that or we stop the press conference.\" \nThe Arsenal manager hit back at the sweeping crictisicm of his side. saying: \"I think you lack a bit of creativity in the press at the moment, that you follow a bandwagon that is very very, very, very boring. I don't go along with that. \n\"If you have any interesting questions for Sunday's game I can answer, but apart from that let's not come back always to the same story. I think you (the press) lack a bit of creativity in the press at the moment, that you follow a bandwagon that is very very, very, very boring. I don't go along with that. \n\"If you have any interesting questions for Sunday's game I can answer, but apart from that let's not come back always to the same story.\" \nWenger did confirm that Laurent Koscielny, Mathieu Flamini and Mikel Arteta will play no part in Sunday's match. \nKoscielny came off against Olympiakos with a hamstring problem while Flamini and Arteta picked up knocks during the 5-2 win at Leicester. \nWenger is now in his 20th year as Gunners boss but it seems the anniversary was lost on the Frenchman as he reacted curtly to questions about his goalkeepers and Jose Mourinho. \n\"One day I will look back but now is not the time to look back,\" Wenger said. \nWenger was happy to acknowledge the efforts of Louis van Gaal at Old Trafford, who has taken his side to the top of the table after seven games, but Wenger insisted it was far too early to predict an outcome in the title race. \nHe said: \"The experience Louis van Gaal has in his career, it is no surprise Manchester United are doing well. At the moment it is tight and difficult to say who will dominate the championship. You can't come to a conclusion yet.\" Promoted Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T14:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T22:42:46.888+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
