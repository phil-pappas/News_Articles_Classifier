Time will tell if they will get the opportunity at the next level. \nStone led all National Hockey League rookies in points and Hoffman led all rookies in goals last season for the Ottawa Senators, and both are averaging more than a point per game this season. Da Costa left the organization to play in the Kontinental Hockey League last season and finished fourth in the league in scoring for CSKA Moscow. \nO'Dell is among several players in the AHL tied for fourth in the league in goals with four. Lindberg has assisted on all four goals and Dzingel has assisted on three of them. The line has produced a goal in three of the team's four games this season. \nAlong with O'Dell and Lindberg, right winger Colin Greening (2 goals, 2 assists) and defenseman Patrick Mullen (0-4) are also producing at point-per-game averages through four games. \nThe B-Sens (2-2-0-0) host the Toronto Marlies (3-1-0-0) on Saturday night at 7:05 and then travel to the capital of New York for a 3 p.m. start against the Albany Devils (1-1-1-0). \nHOCKEY NIGHT \nWHAT: Toronto Marlies at Binghamton Senators \nWHEN/WHERE: 7:05 p.m. Saturday at Floyd L. Maines Veterans Memorial Arena \nRADIO: WINR 96.9 FM and 680 AM \nTICKETS: $20 for side seating ($21 on game day), $19 for end seating ($20 on game day), $2 discount for youths under 12.
