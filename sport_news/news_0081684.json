(AP) — The former Penn State assistant football coach convicted on multiple child sex-abuse charges will be returning to court for an appeal hearing. \nWJAC-TV (http://bit.ly/1NSfG3B ) reports that Judge John Cleland has ordered that Sandusky be moved from a state prison in Greene County to Bellefonte so he can be present for the Oct. 29 hearing. \nSandusky is appealing his 2012 conviction, claiming his trial attorney was ineffective. He also claims he was prejudiced because three former Penn State administrators awaiting trial on alleged cover-up charges weren’t available to testify at his trial. \nThe attorney general’s office already has filed a response calling the appeal “baseless.” \nSandusky is serving 30 to 60 years for his conviction on more than 40 child-sex abuse charges.
