Enlarge Springdale Har-Ber’s Emily Thompson tries to make a block Thursday on Roger High’s Hannah Lloyd (23) during their game in Rog... (By: Michael Woods) \nAfter winning the first set, Springdale Har-Ber trailed Rogers High 18-12 in the second set of a 7A-West Conference volleyball match in King Arena. But Williams dished up two aces during a 5-0 run that turned into a closing 13-2 run that helped push Har-Ber to a 3-0 (25-20, 25-20, 25-19) sweep over the Lady Mounties. \n\"I talk about spark plugs being the energy on our team, and when Paige is in the game, she is a spark plug,\" said Har-Ber coach Shyrah Schisler. \"She is very vocal and she does a great job offensively, defensively. She went in with no fear on the end line and was aggressive. That is all I can ask for.\" \nLauren Thompson led Har-Ber (23-5-2, 9-4 7A-West) with 13 kills and the sophomore had two kills after Rogers trimmed the Har-Ber lead from 18-12 to 19-18 in the first game. Makiah Martin added six kills and two blocks for the Lady Wildcats while Emily Doss had 18 digs. Elizabeth Williams had 40 assists for Har-Ber. \n\"It is important for us to stay focused,\" Schisler said. \"Makiah came in, and she is so strong when she comes in off the bench for us. She gives us that energy, and she puts the ball away when she needs to.\" \nSamantha Lassiter had 13 kills for Rogers (16-14-1, 5-8) while Audrey Herrera had seven blocks. Hannah Lloyd had 23 assists for the Lady Mounties while Madison Sherrill had 13 digs. \nRogers coach Jeana Breedlove said losing the lead in the second game was a turning point in the match. \n\"We had them down 16-8 at one point in the second and Har-Ber started scoring,\" Breedlove said. \"We then got rattled, and you have to give Har-Ber credit for coming back from that kind of deficit. The girls never gave up, but there are a lot of little things that we are not doing. Har-Ber is a good team.\" \nRogers, which has already qualified for the Class 7A State Tournament, closes out the regular season Tuesday at crosstown rival Rogers Heritage. A Rogers victory will give the Lady Mounties the No. 5 seed from the West at the state tournament. \nHar-Ber hosts Springdale High on Tuesday. \nSports on 10/16/2015", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T09:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T11:06:43.951+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
