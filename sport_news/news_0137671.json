He told 7 News he will not name the students or teams affected. \nTurner did say multiple fall sports teams were affected. ( Update Wednesday night: 7 News sports director Mel Busler was told \"a number\" of varsity football players were amomg the 18. ) \nAll 18 students were suspended for 10 percent of their overall sport season, he said. \nTurner said each student will miss about 2 sporting events under the suspension. \nIt's possible some students attended the party but didn't drink, according to a statement from Turner. \n\"The consumption of alcohol is for police to determine. The district believes these students made a poor choice and consequences are appropriate. Any student present at this party could have made the decision to leave once alcohol was introduced,\" Turner noted in his statement. \nHe said \"consequences\" were assigned based on the district's athletic code. \nTurner said the district launched an investigation after the athletic director was \"made aware\" of the party. \nThe announcement from Turner comes at an unusual moment for athletics in the north country - five players from the Indian River football team were suspended for unspecified violations of team rules, and South Lewis was forced to scrap the remainder of its football season because of player injuries.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T06:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T08:09:54.111+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
