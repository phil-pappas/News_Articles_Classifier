One stroke back of Hahn is Cincinnati Sycamore’s Kellen Alsip. \nPikunas is tied wih Springboro’s Maddie Durbin and Massillon Jackson’s Hannah Lemons. \nThe tournament concludes today. \nBoardman sophomore Jenna Vivo is one of six golfers tied for 16th place. Vivo finished with a 78. \nOver on Ohio State’s Scarlet Course, Boardman’s boys team is tied for sixth place after the first day of the Division I state tournament. \nBoardman shot 320, tying the Spartans with Centerville for sixth place. Cincinnati St. Xavier has the lead with 303. Behind the Bombers are Springboro (313), Dublin Jerome (316), Powell Olentangy Liberty (318) and Walsh Jesuit (319). \nAfter her turnaround on the back nine, Pikunas said she walked off the course feeling “pretty good. Overall, it was a pretty solid day.” \nThis morning, because she and Vivo are competing as individuals, they will be among the last ones to tee off. \n“For a tournament, it’s a fairly decent tee time,” Pikunas said of her 10:30 a.m. start. “But really, it doesn’t matter.” \nPikunas described her first few holes on Friday as “rough. I didn’t get off to as good a start,” Pikunas said. “The greens were really fast.” \nShe felt much better on the back nine. \n“I was much more consistent,” she said. \nBoardman freshman Cole Christman shot a 77 to tie with five other golfers for 13th place in the boys tournament. \nSophomore Brian Terlesky is one of six golfers with 78 to tie for 18th place. He’s making his second straight state tournament appearance. \nSophomore Cade Kreps is one of seven who shot a 79, tying him for 24th place. \n“We didn’t play how we wanted to do,” said senior Ethan Thomas who shot an 86 to tie for 53rd. “Hopefully we’ll get better [today].” \nBobby Jonda, Boardman’s other golfer, shot a 97 for 71st. \nThomas called the course conditions “pretty tough. It’s dry and the greens were rolling fast.” \nSaying his teammates “played pretty well today,” Thomas said the Spartans are hoping to move up in the team standings on his final day as a varsity golfer. \n“It’s pretty cool being here, seeing how we stack up against all this competition,” Thomas said. \nThe Spartans spent Friday evening hanging around their hotel and getting updates on the Boardman-Austintown Fitch football game. \n”I miss being there,” Pikunas said. “It’s a big game for us and I’m a big supporter of the team. \n“But it’s exciting being [in Columbus]. We’re having fun.” Other stories of interest", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T07:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T11:28:12.432+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
