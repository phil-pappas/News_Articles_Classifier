Running back DeMarco Murray has been a nonfactor. Both staring inside linebackers, Mychal Kendricks and Kiko Alonso, have missed more time than they have played. Head coach Chip Kelly is going back to college.\nBut, despite all of that, they are just one game away from completely weathering the storm.\nWith their 39-17 win over the New Orleans Saints on Sunday, and the Giants' 30-27 win over the San Francisco 49ers Sunday night, the Eagles are now just won win away from taking over first place in the NFC East.\nHere is how.\nThe Eagles currently stand at 2-3, the same record as the Dallas Cowboys (2-3) and Washington Redskins (2-3). The Giants (3-3) are currently in first place in the NFC East.\nThe Giants travel to Philadelphia next Monday night to face the Eagles at Lincoln Financial Field, giving head coach Chip Kelly's team a chance to control their own fate.\nIf the Eagles win, they would move to 3-3, tied with the Giants, who would drop to 3-3. A win next Monday would give the Eagles the head-to-head tie breaker over the Giants.\nBRADFORD: Report card from win over Saints The Cowboys are off next Sunday, meaning they will remain 2-3 for at least another week. The Redskins travel to MetLife Stadium to face the Jets, a likely loss, which would drop them to 2-4.\nMeaning if the Eagles beat the Giants, and the Jets beat the Redskins, the Eagles will be in first place in the NFC East.\nWhile leading a weak NFC East isn't something to write home about, it would mean that despite everything that has gone wrong this season, the Eagles will be right where everyone thought they would be six weeks into the season -- on top of the division.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T13:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T12:57:35.865+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
