On the road, against a Hall of Fame quarterback and arguably the league's best defense, Minnesota nearly upset a team that has now won 42 of its last 52 regular-season games. \"We were able to fight back and make some plays…our guys just kept fighting. We have a lot of fighters on this football team.” - Zimmer — Minnesota Vikings (@Vikings) October 4, 2015 \nThe 2-2 Vikings will likely categorize Sunday as a missed opportunity. Come December, it might look like the moment Minnesota knew it belonged among the NFL's big boys. \nThe now 4-0 Broncos jumped out to an 13-point lead, largely due to Blair Walsh's missed field goal and Ronnie Hillman's 72-yard rushing touchdown on back-to-back plays. The 10-point swing seemed to stagger the Vikings, who looked on the verge of getting blown out midway through the second quarter. \nA string of big plays swung the tide. \nDown, 10-0, with the Broncos, Brian Robison sacked Manning and forced a Denver field goal. After Bridgewater marched Minnesota 60 yards in 13 plays to set up Minnesota's first points, emerging linebacker Anthony Barr intercepted a short Manning pass on first down. Two plays later, Bridgewater 's four-yard touchdown pass to Mike Wallace cut Denver's lead to 13-10 at halftime. Justin Edmonds/Getty Images \nThe Broncos put the Vikings back on the ropes early in the third quarter. \nManning led Denver on an eight-play, 80-yard scoring drive to open the second half. He hit tight end Owen Daniels for a one-yard score on fourth down to push the Broncos' lead back up to 10 points at 20-10. \nBack-to-back three-and-outs against a swarming Denver defense made it look unlikely the Vikings would escape from another double-digit hole. \nBridgewater and Adrian Peterson had other ideas. \nBacked up to their own 3-yard line, the Vikings embarked on a nine-play, 97-yard march—which was finished off by Peterson's 48-yard touchdown gallop on fourth down. Safety Harrison Smith intercepted Manning on the second play of Denver's ensuing drive, giving Minnesota the football inside Broncos territory. Adrian Peterson untouched.UNTOUCHED.48 yards. All DAY. #MINvsDEN http://t.co/iV9KUmESzS — NFL (@NFL) October 4, 2015 \nThe Vikings got as far as the Broncos' 23-yard line, but a tackle for a loss on first down and a sack of Bridgewater on second short-circuited the drive. Walsh's field goal tied the game at 20. \nSuddenly, Minnesota was one stop and one score away from leaving Denver with the signature win of the Mike Zimmer era. \nManning and the Broncos defense wrote a different script. \nTaking over with five minutes, five seconds left on the fourth-quarter clock, Manning drove Denver 55 yards in nine plays. Brandon McManus gave Denver a 23-20 lead with 1:51 left when he nailed a 39-yard field goal. Did the Vikings prove they belonged against the Broncos?
