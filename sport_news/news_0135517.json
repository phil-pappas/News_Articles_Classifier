That it came in a 39-17 victory was the only consolation. \nFeel better this week? \n\"We won, so yeah, I feel a lot better,\" Sturgis said. \nBut will there be another week? You really have to wonder. On the one hand, Sturgis did kick field goals of 39, 29, 26 and 41 yards during the game. In that sense, he did get better as the afternoon wore on. On the other hand, there was the mixed extra point, again. There also was the fact that the coach was afraid to try a 53-yard field goal in the second quarter in a league where teams try 53-yard field goals all the time. And then there were the kickoffs - only five of nine (56 percent) were touchbacks in a league where 65 percent is the average. To be fair, he's at 62 percent over two games. \nSo, who knows? \n\"It's not a game that you can sulk in,\" Sturgis said, when asked about the missed extra point. \"You've got to get back out there and hit the next one.\" \nAnd did he feel as if things turned the corner for him during the game? \n\"I think I had a good week of preparation, and I was ready for this game,\" he said. \"I'm upset I missed that extra point, and there are a few kickoffs I'd like to get back, but I think I'm hitting the ball well.\" More coverage", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T15:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T16:12:55.281+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
