Perhaps that is related to the fact that the fullback is also considered the strongest player on the team . \nBergen has taken over the starting fullback job after Michael Burton's graduation. Bergen and Burton entered Rutgers together, but Bergen earned a sixth year of eligibility from the NCAA because he missed two seasons due to injury. \nThe 6-foot, 250-pound Bergen mostly played special teams and served as a lead blocker earlier in his career, but this season he has four catches for 40 yards and one carry for 15 yards. The carry came on a fake punt in last Saturday's 55-52 win over Indiana. \nI caught up with Bergen this week to discuss his first career carry, the fact that he's not the oldest player on the team and life after Rutgers. \nQ: What was your favorite team growing up? \nA: I've always been a Giants fan. \nQ: You're from Pennsylvania, so how did you become a Giants fan? \nA: My dad was born and raised in New York on Long Island so me, my brother and my sister all grew up New York sports fans — Giants, Rangers, Yankees, Knights. \nQ: Who was your favorite player growing up? \nA: I'd have to say Brian Urlacher from the Bears. Early on in my career I was playing linebacker so he was one of, if not the best around. \nQ: Why do you wear No. 44? \nA: To go along with the Brian Urlacher thing, my first year playing football in junior high I was trying to get 54 and someone already grabbed it so I just took 44. I guess it was the next best thing and it just stuck around, I guess. \nQ: What was your second college choice and why did you choose Rutgers? \nA: That's a little tough for me. Rutgers was always my No. 1 choice. It's a great school academically, it's not too far from my home and you play the best football around. It's kind of hard to tell what my second would be because I committed right when I got the offer, so I really couldn't tell you. I don't know. \nQ: When did you start playing football? \nA: Seventh grade. \nQ: That's a little later than most of your teammates. Some of them said they started playing when they were like 5 years old. \nA: I never played peewee football or anything like that because at that point I don't think I would have made the weight limit. I was a little heavier growing up. Believe it or not, I played soccer for a little bit and I wrestled pretty young, like in the second grade. \nQ: You mentioned the weight limit so did you have to start out on the line? \nA: I played linebacker and fullback right away. By that point, I grew a little bit. \nQ: How's the sixth year going? \nA: It's been going great. I'm definitely happy with the decision I made to come back and petition for that extra year. I think it's really paying off. I'm having a lot of fun. It's fun to go out there and play with these guys. We've got a great team, a lot of great guys, great coaches. It's just been awesome. \nQ: One of the perks of coming back for a sixth year is you finally got your first career carry on the fake punt against Indiana. What was that like? \nA: We've been practicing that for a couple of weeks. The situation came up and we called it and I just executed the play and got the first down. It was pretty sweet. A lot of guys were jacked up when I got on the sideline. That was fun. \nQ: You get all of the attention for the sixth year, but isn't Djwany Mera older than you? \nA: He is older than me. He gets mad every time I point that out, but it's just a fact. \nOUT OF BOUNDS \nQ: Are you in grad school? \nA: Yeah. I graduated last fall. I started grad school in the spring. \nQ: What are you getting your masters' in? \nA: I'm in the school of management and labor relations. My undergrad was economics. \nQ: I feel like you were always on the conference all-academic teams. What was your GPA when you graduated? \nA: I finished with a 3.1. \nQ: What are your plans for after Rutgers? \nA: I don't know. I really haven't put much thought into it yet because right now I'm just focused on the next game. But I'm just hoping that football might have a place in there somewhere. We'll see. \nQ: Is it hard to envision not being at Rutgers because you've been here for so long? \nA: Yeah, I've been here for more than half a decade, so it is kind of hard to imagine. But right now, I'm just taking it one day at a time, so we'll see. \nI'll do a Q&A with a player each Friday. Who do you want to hear from next week? Let me know in the comments section, and feel free to pass along any questions you have for players.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T20:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T23:29:42.023+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
