Danny Butterfield picked the ball up in midfield and delivered an inch-perfect pass that the young striker took down superbly, beat his man and drilled a low shot inside Sam Beasant's near post.Exeter continued to dominate the early exchanges with Nichols in the thick of the action. He forced Beasant into a flying save before delivering a superb cross, which fizzed across the face and goal and behind.Cambridge rarely threatened in the first half and it was not until the second half that they really threatened. Substitute Jordan Slew missed a great chance to equalise when he skied high from Barry Corr's knockdown and Slew forced Bobby Olejnik into a smart stop at his near post.However, Exeter finished the game strongly without ever really threatening the Cambridge goal, while the U's ran out of steam as the game ended somewhat tamely.
