Gregory Wolf at 219-881-1210 or 866-274-6347.\nAuthorities are still waiting for DNA results on another missing 2-year-old boy, Kyrian Knox, who disappeared from Rockford at the end of August. Kyrian was reported missing Sept. 17, but police said they believe the boy was last seen around Aug. 20.\nAuthorities initially found the foot of a toddler in the West Side park’s lagoon Sept. 5. Over the next two days, officials found a child’s head and other remains. The lagoon was drained during the investigation.\nInvestigators believe the remains are those of an African-American boy, but officials cautioned that the body could be of a \"mixed-race heritage\" child and possibly a girl. The toddler was most likely about 2 years old, investigators have said.\nCopyright © 2015, Chicago Tribune", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-561e4d61/turbine/ct-dna-test-missing-gary-boy-is-not-child-found-in-garfield-park-lagoon-20151014"], "published": "2015-10-14T14:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T17:01:17.605+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
