Save our future, save our community, save our family,” said Gobena to council members.\nUber is valued at $51 billion, and Lyft is valued at $2.5 billion.\nThe legislation would apply to Seattle's taxi- and driver-for-hire companies too.\n“We work hard. We make [the] company profitable, but we never get anything,” said driver Walelean Balcha.\nThe law would work by defining drivers as company employees rather than independent contractors—so they can then vote on whether to unionize.\nThe companies say that violates federal labor law.\n“We urge the committee to avoid a rush decision and to seriously consider the implications of these legal realities,” said Uber’s Catlin O'Neill.\nLyft says forcing the company to accept unions would raise prices for passengers.\nTim Or, a musician and Lyft driver, worried about union rules.\n“I'm just concerned about my long-term ability to control my own schedule, which Lyft has always allowed me to do,” said Or.\nThe committee considered waiting, but ultimately voted 7 to 0 to pass the ordinance on for full council approval.\ncomment (1)", "external_links": ["http://w.sharethis.com/button/buttons.js"], "published": "2015-10-03T03:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T12:05:55.594+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
