Eventually you're going to have to talk to your teammates. That's helped a lot. We're a family this year.\"\nPSU coach Bruce Barnum has planned this trip like a military campaign.\nThe buses are stopping Thursday for lunch at the Medford In-N-Out Burger, and for the night at a hotel in Concord, California.\n\"The kids think In-N-Out is like Nike, a cool thing,\" Barnum says.\nHe has a History Channel special on Alcatraz cued up to show on the buses, followed by the 1996 feature film \"The Rock.\"\nAll of that is in preparation for a Friday field trip to Alcatraz, the former federal prison located on an island in the San Francisco Bay, and now a national park.\n\"Give them a piece of history,\" Barnum explains. \"Get them out of their college football fiefdom.\"\nWell, not all the way out, because Barnum has arranged for a walkthrough practice in the old Alcatraz exercise yard.\nThey arrive in San Luis Obispo on Friday night, and will have a more formal practice there. They will play on Saturday night, bus back to Concord after the game, and be home by Sunday evening.\nThe coaches can do their prep work for next week's game against Montana aboard the buses on laptops and iPads.\nIt's not the normal mode of operation, but necessity sometimes forces innovation. In this case, the camaraderie the Vikings are developing on the highways might be worth the inconvenience.\n\"Does that matter?\" Barnum asks. \"I don't know. But I think it's helping our football team.\"\nThe offensive coordinator last year, Barnum inherited the job on an interim basis after the school fired Nigel Burton in November following a 3-9 season.\nAfter a 4-1 start, Barnum was given the job outright last week, along with a five-year contract, just before a 59-42 victory over Montana State.\nBarnum is a career assistant who spent three decades knocking around the lower levels of college football. He never has coached at the Football Bowl Subdivision level, and so isn't wedded to some the perks that are business as usual on the FBS level.\nTake the University of Oregon, which is located roughly 100 miles to the south, where the football program operates out of its own six-story Hatfield-Dowlin Complex.\nAmong the amenities inside are football locker rooms with ventilated lockers and infection-free Corian surfaces, that come complete with a magic shelf to recharge portable electronics without needing to plug them in.\nThere are four-foot deep hydrotherapy pools, a barber shop for the players, a players' lounge with foosball tables imported from Barcelona, sofas that recline into beds and gaming stations equipped with PlayStations branded with Oregon's logo.\nThe Vikings' coaches share office space on the fourth floor of PSU's University Center building alongside the Department of Communication, the Judaic Studies Program, and offices for the School of Business Administration.\nThe Vikings' locker room is several blocks away and, well, a locker room.\nBarnum never has been inside the Hatfield-Dowlin Complex, but he has heard about it.\n\"They have some cool stuff,\" he says. \"We have a couch in our locker room. It came out of somebody's house when they got a new one. One of the coaches keeps asking me, 'Should we get the players an Xbox?'\n\"Why? They can do that at home. The locker room is a workplace.\"\nThe PSU players don't seem concerned about what their locker room doesn't contain.\nQuarterback Alex Kuresa played a season on the FBS level at BYU.\n\"I think at this level you appreciate things a little bit more,\" he says. \"You can't go in and get a new pair of cleats every day or those type of things. But I think it helps you appreciate the things you have a little bit more.\"\nPenn is a junior from Portland's Grant High School who hasn't ever seen the interior of the Hatfield-Dowlin, either.\n\"At the end of the day,\" he says, shrugging, \"you can't miss what you've never had.\"\nBesides, PSU has something this year's Oregon team does not: a victory over Washington State.\nThe Vikings played at FBS North Texas two weeks ago, and they did fly for that game. They were on the bus to the airport after winning 66-7 , and some of the PSU players were following the Oregon-WSU game on their phones.\nThe Cougars won in double overtime.\n\"It was fun to see that happening,\" Kuresa said. \"We were celebrating our win. But it was fun to see that happening at the same time.\"\nWSU thumped Oregon State last week, 52-31, leading some to wonder if Portland State has Oregon's best college football team, frills or no frills.\n\"Yeah, that's what people are saying,\" Penn says. \"We'll take it for now. We're at different levels, but at the end of the day, we did what we had to do against Washington State. We don't play Oregon. We don't play Oregon State. We're focused on Cal Poly.\"\nWell, that and a very long bus trip.\n-- Ken Goe\nkgoe@oregonian.com\n503-221-8040 | @KenGoe", "external_links":
