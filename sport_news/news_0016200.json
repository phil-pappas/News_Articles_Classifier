All four of the Cubs’ games this postseason have had at least a 39% increase in ratings and viewership compared to last year. \nGame 3 of Dodgers/Mets drew a 2.4 and 4.0 million later in the night, up 26% in ratings and 37% in viewership from Dodgers/Cardinals on Fox Sports 1 last year (1.9, 2.9M) and down 4% and up 2%, respectively, compared to Braves/Dodgers in 2013 (2.5, 3.9M). The first hour of the game aired on TNT, earning 2.3 million. \nMonday’s American League playoff games did not do nearly as well. FS1 drew 2.2 million viewers for Game 4 of Royals/Astros, up 142% from Athletics/Tigers Game 3 on MLB Network in 2013 (912K). Blue Jays/Rangers Game 4 had 2.0 million later in the afternoon, down 23% from Cardinals/Pirates Game 4 in 2013 (2.6M). There were no comparable windows last year. \nUPDATE 10/13 : Original version of post mistakenly said ALDS Game 4s were most-watched of series. In Royals/Astros, Game 1 ranks as the most-watched, and in Blue Jays/Rangers, Game 3 is the most-watched. \n(Mon. numbers from Turner Sports, ShowBuzz Daily ) Related", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T23:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T10:29:34.153+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
