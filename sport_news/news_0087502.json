All they wanted to do was come in here and fight and play their butts off.\n\"I saw the look in their eyes all week, the focus.\" \nHammonton, the No. 3 team in The Inquirer Top 25, improved to 7-0 overall and clinched a share of the National Division title with a 4-0 mark. \nTop-ranked Delsea dropped to 6-1 overall and 3-1 in the division. \n\"They dominated the football game,\" Delsea coach Sal Marchese said of Hammonton. \"I saw a hungry football team. They came in here and they wanted it more than we did.\" \nWinters, a speedy junior, ran for two long touchdowns and also threw a touchdown pass in a performance that established him as a player to watch in South Jersey. \nHammonton also got strong work from senior Zach Barnard, who ran 17 times for 70 yards and a touchdown as a fullback and also led the Blue Devils defense as an inside linebacker. \nSenior end Josh Bevan, junior tackle Jon Vega, and junior linebacker Sean Collins also played strong defensive games as Hammonton shut out a Delsea team that was averaging 40.3 points. \n\"Words can't describe it,\" Raso said of the team's defensive performance. \"It was just an unbelievable effort.\" \nHammonton controlled the line of scrimmage, got a blocked punt by Izick Flores to set up a touchdown, and recovered two fumbles. \nDelsea never was able to get its ground game in gear. The Crusaders managed just four first downs in the first three quarters. By then, Hammonton's lead was 27-0. \n\"They came out and executed, right from the start,\" Marchese said of Hammonton. \"We were just the opposite. You can't make the mistakes we made against a good football team.\" \nThe 5-foot-11, 175-pound Winters was the game's big-play man. \nHe went 65 yards around left end for the first touchdown in the first quarter. \nHe threw a perfect strike in the end zone for a 27-yard touchdown to Flores on a fourth and 9 in the third quarter. \nAnd he capped the win with a 41-yard touchdown run around right end in the fourth quarter, lifting the football in the air in celebration over the final 5 yards and drawing an unsportsmanlike-conduct penalty. \n\"My emotions got the best of me because I knew that was going to seal it,\" Winter said. \"I was so happy. I couldn't control myself. \n\"Coach told me not to do it again, but he was smiling so I don't think he was too mad.\" \nHammonton 13 7 7 7 - 34 \nDelsea 0 0 0 0 - 0 \nH: Malachi Winters 65 run (kick fail) \nH: Zach Barnard 2 run (Jon Ryker kick) \nH: Mitch Vitali 22 run (Ryker kick) \nH: Izick Flores 27 pass from Winters (Ryker kick) \nH: Winters 41 run (Ryker kick)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T08:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T08:49:54.361+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
