Having the opportunity to work with this group all summer has been a tremendously satisfying experience. These young men have been maturing well physically and mentally. I'm looking forward to getting back at the appropriate time.\" U of L's Willard back doing what he loves \nLouisville will fill Willard's position with director of basketball operations David Padgett, a former U of L player who Pitino was grooming to become an assistant coach in the future. Padgett will perform the duties of both positions in Willard's absence, Klein said. \nWillard had only signed a one-year contract at U of L, saying this summer that he was specifically hired to help Pitino cultivate a young roster in what the staff views as somewhat of a transition year. \n\"I've always been the type of person who thinks you shouldn't do something if you're not going to add real value,\" Willard said in June. \"I missed the relationships. I missed the on-the-floor teaching.\" \nPitino spent much of this past summer coaching the Puerto Rican national team while Willard served as the Cardinals’ pseudo head coach back at U of L. \n\"Ralph is one of the game's great teachers and one of my closest friends in life,\" Pitino said in the school's release. \"My only concern right now is that he gets healthy and has a speedy recovery from some problems that need immediate attention. We are seeking the best doctors available to assess his situation.\" \nWillard, who has a home in Florida with his wife, had open-heart surgery back in 2008 to repair a leaking mitral valve while he was still the head coach at Holy Cross. \nHe told the Worcester (Mass.) Telegram after the operation that he had mitral valve regurgitation, which occurs \"when the mitral valve doesn't close tightly and leaks blood backward to the heart,\" according to the newspaper's 2008 report. In that story, Willard said he noticed the effects of the condition when he would become \"fatigued\" during his daily workouts. \nWillard spent 10 years at Holy Cross after head coaching stints at Western Kentucky and Pittsburgh. He was on Pitino's staffs at both Kentucky and with the New York Knicks in the late 1980s. He rejoined Pitino at U of L in 2009. He left in 2011 to work as a consultant for Holy Cross before taking a scouting job with the Oklahoma City Thunder for the 2013-14 season. \nHe was semi-retired in Florida when Pitino approached him about replacing Wyking Jones on Louisville's staff back in April. After debating the job offer with his wife, Willard, who said he spent his mornings deciding which color shorts to wear, agreed to spend the year at U of L. \n\"I just wasn't ready to retire,\" he said. 9 CONNECT 10 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://cjky.it/1Lr1JXU TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T22:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T23:28:58.808+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
