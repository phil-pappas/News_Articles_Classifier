As his comments drew criticism from media, political parties and various organisations, Eshwarappa defended himself, saying his remarks had been wrongly projected. Fellow BJP leader and Leader of the Opposition in the Assembly Jagadish Shettar said: “If the statement is actually like that, it is not in a good taste”. Some infuriated journalists even took up the issue with CM Siddaramaiah seeking action against Eshwarappa. The woman journalist had questioned Eshwarappa, who is Leader of the Opposition in the LC, on the silence of Opposition parties in the wake of rising crime in the state.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T04:22:24.400+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
