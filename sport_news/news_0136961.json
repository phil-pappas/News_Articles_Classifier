Cory Schneider: The 29-year-old goaltender must play even better than he did in the second half of last season for this team to have a chance to be close to a playoff spot.\n2. Offensive improvement: Other than Mike Cammalleri (team-high 27 goals in 2014-15) every returning forward — and newcomers such as Kyle Palmieri and Jiri Tlusty — must produce at a higher level than last season.\n3. The young defensemen: Adam Larsson, Damon Severson, Jon Merrill and Eric Gelinas have to continue to develop and further strengthen what needs to be the foundation of this team.\n4. The young forwards: If Reid Boucher, Stefan Matteau, Sergey Kalinin, Joe Blandisi (in minors to start season) or anyone else can step up and establish themselves as legitimate NHL players, that might speed up this rebuilding process.\n5. Ray Shero: The new GM will continue to look to use the pieces he has to acquire a younger top-six forward who fits his long-term vision.\n— Tom Gulitti", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T04:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T15:15:21.947+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
