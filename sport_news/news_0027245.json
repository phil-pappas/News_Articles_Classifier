Ashbrook responds to adversity The Green Wave came into Friday’s game against East Gaston with losses in two consecutive weeks. Hours before the game, the Ashbrook coaching staff made the decision to dismiss two of the team’s top players, wide receivers Jeff Glenn and Z’Andre Givens. Givens and Glenn were the team’s two leading receivers through the first seven weeks of the season, combining for 46 catches and 631 yards as the top targets for quarterback Jabreze Robbs. The news was not a positive development for an Ashbrook team that already had experienced some struggles over the past two weeks. But the Green Wave showed an ability to respond to a challenge, thanks in large part to its defense and senior running back Kristien Bell. Ashbrook held the Warriors to 110 rushing yards, an average of 2.8 yards per carry, and Bell posted his first 100-yard rushing game of the season, tallying 146 on the ground on 16 carries with three touchdowns. The most interesting takeaway from the game was the effectiveness of Ashbrook’s run-heavy offense. The Green Wave ran the ball 41 times Friday night and put the ball in the air for 18 pass attempts. Last week, the run-pass split was nearly the opposite: 39 passes and 22 runs. It will be interesting to see if the Green Wave stays with a run-oriented offense going forward after finding success with that approach Friday night, albeit through circumstances no one on the team would choose. 2. Parity abounds in the Big South Conference More than halfway through the conference schedule, Week 9 in the Big South 2A/3A brought up more questions than answers. Forestview did not put forth the performance it wanted in a 34-7 loss to South Point, yet the Jaguars have sole possession of second place thanks to Ashbrook’s victory over East Gaston. Stuart Cramer continued its terrific season with a second consecutive win, defeating North Gaston. The Wildcats beat Ashbrook two weeks ago, and the Friday before the Green Wave beat Stuart Cramer. Third place through eighth in the conference are separated by just one game, with three teams tied at 2-2 in conference and another group of three with a 1-3 record. The conference is even throughout, which makes for entertaining football and difficult results to predict week-to-week. 3. South Point appears to be rising above that parity The Red Raiders aren’t used to losing, and they have been determined to retake their spot on top of the conference since last year’s loss to Forestview. Since that overtime loss in 2014, South Point has won 13 of its 16 games, including a run to the state semifinal last season. Friday night, the Red Raiders had their opportunity to atone for what they saw as a subpar effort last year, and they delivered. “We’ve been waiting on this game for about 365 days,” said coach Mickey Lineberger after his team’s dominant 34-7 victory. While spots two through eight could shift around quite a bit through the rest of the season, South Point appears to be a strong favorite to finish the year in the top spot after Friday’s win. The Red Raiders take on Lake Norman Charter, North Gaston and Stuart Cramer to close the season, and the team appears to be peaking at the right time. 4. The 2A playoff picture takes another turn Last week, we covered Stuart Cramer’s potential road to its first-ever playoff berth in the program’s first season with a senior class. Friday night, the Storm strengthened their resume with a huge 35-28 win over North Gaston. That victory for Stuart Cramer puts the Storm in the number one spot among the three 2A schools in the conference, with another chance to strengthen their hold on that spot coming up Friday on the road against Hunter Huss. Meanwhile, Lake Norman Charter earned a hugely important win over the Huskies Friday, putting those two teams in a tie for the second 2A automatic berth with matching 1-3 records. There’s still time for plenty of changes in the next three weeks, but the Huss-Cramer matchup will have big tournament implications no matter who wins. 5. Sage Surratt approaches a milestone East Lincoln’s Surratt brothers continue to put up eye-popping numbers as they help the Mustangs continue to win. In a Friday, Oct. 9 victory over Bunker Hill, Chazz Surratt surpassed the 4,000-yard rushing mark for his career. This week, the Mustangs senior quarterback added another 284 yards on the ground while throwing for 225 in a win over Newton-Conover, the team’s 24 th straight win. However, while Chazz has received much well-deserved attention for his record-setting career, it’s his younger brother with a chance at a career milestone next week. Sage Surratt caught eight passes for 135 yards and two touchdowns in Friday night’s win, putting him over 1,000 yards for the second straight season. It was his sixth straight game with a receiving touchdown and his fifth 100-yard performance of the season. Next week, the junior receiver will have a chance to break the 3,000-yard career mark receiving. He’s just 17 yards short of that mark entering the game.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T01:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T04:25:58.826+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
