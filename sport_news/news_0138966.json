Ouch. \nArian Foster, RB, HOU \n10 rushing yards, 25 receiving yards, 1 fumble lost, 1.5 points. \nIt was exactly the season debut we were hoping for, as he averaged just 1.2 yards per carry. \nCarlos Hyde, RB, SF \n20 rushing yards, 2 receiving yards, 2.2 points. \nHasn’t performed well since Week 1. \nTre Mason, RB, STL \n-1 rushing yard, -0.1 points. \nThis is clearly Todd Gurley’s team now. \nJulio Jones, WR, ATL \n38 receiving yards, 3.8 points. \nThe Falcons got out to a huge lead without even needing Jones. \nOdell Beckham Jr., WR, NYG \n38 receiving yards, 3.8 points. \nWas targetted 12 times, but only managed five catches against Bills. \nDeVante Parker, WR, MIA \nHe’s buried on the depth chart and didn’t even have a single target. \nJordan Reed, TE, WAS \n37 receiving yards, 1 fumble lost, 1.7 points. \nWas knocked out of the game after suffering a concussion. \nI HOPE YOU STARTED \nAllen Hurn went out and did what most No. 2 receivers have done against the Colts this season: Light them up. With Vontae Davis keeping Allen Robinson in check, Hurns hauled in 11 passes for 116 yards and a TD. \n—I wonder if Kirk Cousins even started himself in his football pool this week? Well, if he is one of the 6% of Yahoo owners that does and started him, he would’ve been rewarded with 21.7 points, the second most among QBs this week.
