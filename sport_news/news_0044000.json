Elbert Robinson has that work cut out for him this season, though.\nWith a twist, though.\nRobinson is the biggest of the big men on the LSU basketball roster this season and that fact alone puts plenty on a plate that has featured a different kind of diet since he got to college.\nIn his second year of his Tiger career, Robinson is being counted on to elevate his game after a lackluster freshman season.\nThe good news: Robinson has plenty of room for growth and development. The bad: It's that whole 'filling shoes' thing.\nOver the last three seasons since Johnny Jones arrived as LSU's coach, Johnny O'Bryant, Jarell Martin and Jordan Mickey have been the Tigers' foundation.\nAll three earned All-SEC honors, all three were taken in the NBA Draft and all three were building blocks for an inside-out philosophy.\nWhich is where the twist comes in.\nLSU sophomore Elbert Robinson Associated Press The Tigers need Robinson to take a step forward. What the big Texan has to steer clear of is trying to be the next great LSU big man.\nEssentially, they just need Elbert to be Elbert.\nDefend the paint. Rebound. Take up space.\nNot a lot of bells and whistled needed when you are 7-foot-1 and 290 pounds.\n\"With him being down low and being as big as he is, we need him to protect the paint and get a lot of rebounds,\" junior guard Tim Quarterman said. \"He could be a big key for us\nAdded Jalyn Patterson , part of the same recruiting class as Robinson, \" With Elbert, we've got somebody down there who is going to protect the paint. He can make it hard for guys to get shots over him.\"\nTo do so, Robinson needs to be on the court, though, and last season, that proved to an obstacle.\nAfter opening the season as a starter, Robinson's playing time waned during the pre-conference season and evaporated almost altogether in conference play. He played just twice in SEC games for a total of 7minutes.\nStruggles with conditioning after he shed 35-40 pounds off a frame that was at 310 when he got to campus and struggles with defending the pick-and-roll were the major issues Robinson grappled with.\nLSU big man Elbert Robinson is ready to show his progress | Video The big Texan struggled through his freshman season, but says he has improved on defense and is ready to be a force on the glass.\n\"My freshman season, my maturity level wasn't good,\" Robinson said. \"I expected to come in and have things given to me. I worked hard, but not as hard as other guys and it was just a big wakeup call for me. Now I feel like my maturity level has increased a lot. Going against guys like Jarell and Jordan helped me a lot because they pushed me and gave me tips on how to get better.\n\"I never gave the coaches a hard time about not playing because I respected their decision. I knew my time would come. But it was hard to not be out there. I got down on myself.\"\nWhat made the mental transition even tougher for Robinson was that his dedication to reshaping his body was part of the reason he scuffled.\nRobinson's weight loss helped him getting healthier for sure, but also changed the way he could approach the game.\n\"I felt like last year I lost so much weight so fast that I lost muscle,\" Robinson said. \"I was playing with finesse and that's not my game. I like banging around in the post. It felt a lot better to get my weight back up, and now I want to be able to play the way I know I can.\"\nThat's what Jones is looking for as well.\nLSU's fourth-year coach has always been a big proponent of Robinson's potential, saying that with time, the big sophomore will be an impact player.\nIs that time getting closer?\n\"It's been a tough transition for him from high school to college, and he has taken the necessary steps to improve as a player,\" Jones said. \"Conditioning-wise, he's got to try to be in the best possible shape he can be in to be able to run the floor and be effective at both ends of the floor. When you're losing that much weight, sometimes you lose muscle mass and, as big a man as he is, he needed to make sure his muscle mass developed the right away to facilitate his frame. He spent most of last season concentrating on that.\nLSU coach Johnny Jones Gene J. Puskar | Associated Press \"Big guys develop a little bit differently. The transition sometimes is a little bit different for them. I'm hopeful that because of the year that Elbert had, the opportunity to play; and then being under our strength and conditioning program ... that it's starting to take place right now. He's benefitting from the time in the weight room and the special attention that he's been getting. He's made some really positive strides for us. He's been a bright spot these first three days in practice.\"\nThat's a good start, but sustaining that level of play and being consistent need to follow.\nWith an influx of offensively advanced players headlined by Benny Simmons, Antonio Blakeney, Brandon Sampson and Craig Victor , as well as a core group of veteran guards back, the Tigers are poised to be even more up-tempo this season with versatility -- positionless basketball -- as a calling card.\nFor Robinson to chime in, that likely means short stints on the floor when the game slows down to a half-court pace. Smaller windows to make an impact, but also less chance of the big man wearing down.\nWhether it's 5-6 minutes a half or longer spurts, a big key for Robinson is that he gives max effort.\n\"He's got a different mindset this year,\" Patterson said. \"He's more physically ready now. Whatever the coaches ask him to do, he's going to do it and play hard.\"\nPlaying hard is a big step. Being a factor on defense is another.\nRobinson expects to help on the glass and can block, or at least redirect, shots because of his sheer size. For either of those to work, though, he has to be in the right spot.\nLSU center Elbert Robinson: 'I knew my time would come. But it was hard to not be out there. I got down on myself.' Associated Press Last season, when opponents ran simple pick-and-rolls involving Robinson, he regularly wound up lost in the wash and out of position for his big body to supply any help. Making the transition from a suspect defender to one that his Tiger teammates can trust to be on the backline to clean up their gambles and missteps will be something to watch this season.\n\"Defense wins games, and that's what I really struggled with last year the most,\" said Robinson, who scored 11.7 points, grabbed 10.9 rebounds and rejected 4.1 shots a game on the way to Class 5A all-state honors as a senior at Lakeview Centennial in the Dallas suburbs. Those numbers were actually down from his junior season (14 ppg, 12.5 rpg, 6 bpg), in part because most opposing teams and players steered completely clear of him and the lane.\n\"Defensive moves and adjustments were all really new to me. I had a lot of trouble trying to stop the pick-and-roll. Now I've gotten a lot better on defense and it's just a matter of making sure I stay in great shape so can run with the new guys and be on the floor when we're pushing the ball.\"\nThat remains to be seen. But Robinson does figure to have a role and he has never wavered from believing that.\nDuring the offseason, there were rumblings that Robinson would transfer to find a program where his big size and perceived preference for a lumbering, slow-down style might fit better.\nElbert Robinson LSUSports.net Not the case, Robinson says. He knows there may be lowered expectations of him because he didn't burst onto the scene in a big way as a freshman, but that will become motivation.\n\"It bothered me a little to see and hear that stuff because it made look like I was going to run out on my team and that's not the kind of guy I am,\" Robinson said. \"I feel like I'm in a pretty good situation. I think I'll be a lot better and will be a guy the coaches can count on for a lot of high-low stuff.\n\"The coaches want me to bury people under the basket and look for easy shots,\" Robinson said. \"I know I need to be a great rebounder and defender to get on the floor. I've improved on a lot of things. I'm getting used to my body now and feel like I can make a big impact for the team.\"\nAnd perhaps slip into those shoes waiting on him.\nWhat Johnny Jones said Thursday\nPODCAST | Quarterman likes what he's seen so far\nVIDEO | Benny Simmons eager to get to work\nVIDEO | Jones, coaches get a different chance without Simmons\nVIDEO | Hornsby says summer tour allows for accelerated pre-season practice\nVIDEO | Jones likes options with six guards\nVIDEO | Hornsby says Simmons is just like any other teenager", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T23:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T23:45:12.093+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
