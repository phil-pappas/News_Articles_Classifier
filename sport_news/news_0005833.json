The previous high was a 3.5 for Game 5 of last year’s Giants/Cardinals NLCS. \nThe Royals’ win scored the third-highest overnight of this year’s Division Series, no small feat given the strong performance by the National League games. Only Tuesday’s Cardinals/Cubs (4.2) and Mets/Dodgers (4.8) games on TBS drew a higher overnight. \nLocally, the game had a 36.3 rating in Kansas City and a 15.7 in Houston, records for FS1 in either market. \nEarlier in the day, Game 5 of Rangers/Blue Jays drew a 2.5 overnight — the highest of the series. No other game topped a 1.7. The Rangers’ error-filled loss had a 10.9 rating in Dallas-Ft. Worth. \n(Wed. numbers from Sports Business Daily ) Related", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T19:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T04:09:36.017+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
