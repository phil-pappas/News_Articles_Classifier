He also lost the tip of his fractured thumb and underwent reparative surgery on his middle finger.\nSix weeks have passed since the Giants first examined Pierre-Paul’s hand. Since then, he has posted multiple videos of himself working out on his Instagram account, and tweeted in September that he wasn’t concerned with his index finger assisting him in recording sacks .\nThough the Giants have said they have been encouraged by Pierre-Paul’s “attitude, demeanor and physical condition apart from the hand,” they are reluctant to pay for him to return before he has fully recovered.\nNew York and Pierre-Paul must come to an agreement soon on whether he will sign his one-year, $14.8 million franchise tag. If he does not sign by 4 p.m. on Nov. 17, he would be forced to sit out the rest of the season. If he does sign, the Giants would be able to place him on the non-football injury list and could opt not to pay him.\nThe Giants (3–2) will play the Philadelphia Eagles (2–3) on Monday night at Lincoln Financial Field.\n• FARRAR: Panthers cement status in comeback, leaving Seahawks shaken\n- Erin Flynn\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["https://edit.si.com/nfl/2015/09/12/new-york-giants-jason-pierre-paul-hand-injury", "https://edit.si.com/nfl/2015/09/17/new-york-giants-jason-pierre-paul-index-finger", "https://instagram.com/p/7q-B2Sj2P1/?taken-by=iamjasonpierrepaul", "http://www.si.com/nfl/2015/09/15/new-york-giants-jason-pierre-paul-hand-injury", "http://www.si.com/", "http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/football/giants/jpp-report-back-giants-hand-re-examined-sources-article-1.2401902?utm_content=bufferfba9b&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=RVacchiano+Twitter", "http://www.si.com/nfl/2015/10/18/panthers-seahawks-cam-newton-richard-sherman", "https://instagram.com/p/770l8Tj2Gz/?taken-by=iamjasonpierrepaul", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T04:35:50.486+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
