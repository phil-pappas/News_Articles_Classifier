Even though I felt good, you can’t simulate what we go through. \n“But it was fine. Press on now. Now we’re chasing car speed, back into the old routine of complaining about the car and I need a new gear box, all that sort of stuff.” \nCourtney’s first run of the day ended with a 13th-fastest lap in opening practice before finishing inside the top 10 times in eighth position in the final session. \n“That last one I was just smashing the kerbs and getting a heap of cuts just to try and see what would happen but, yeah, everything was fine,” he said. \nAnother injured driver, Ford’s Scott Pye, has also emerged from Friday’s practice in good shape. \nThe Dick Johnson Racing Team Penske pilot topped the opening practice session and despite admitting his broken rib from a crash at the Bathurst 1000 was tender, ended the day all smiles.
