He certainly got that. \n“That was our biggest thing, because we have not done that yet this year,” Underwood said. “I thought at times we executed at a high level and I’m really proud of our guys and the way that they played today.” \nLost in the offensive outburst was the fact that St. Cloud State (3-2 NSIC, 3-2 overall) held Minnesota-Crookston (0-5, 0-5) to 226 total yards on the day, including holding the Golden Eagles to 60 total yards in the first half. \nStory continues below.
