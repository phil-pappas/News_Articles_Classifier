Stephen Lister, a trooper with 6Â½ years on the job, pulled Michael's black Bentley over because the car appeared to violate state laws on tinted windows, the Texas Department of Public Safety said Tuesday. No citation was issued, but according to SPS Sgt. Lonny Haschel, \"the trooper had Mr. Michael step out of the vehicle for a picture. A passenger in the player's car took the photo.'' \nThat might have been the end of it, but Michael posted the photo on Instagram with the caption: \"Got stopped just to take a picture.''
