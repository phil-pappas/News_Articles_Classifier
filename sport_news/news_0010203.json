One program that makes world history and current events leap off the page while promoting negotiating, writing and presentation skills is Model United Nations, a national program available at many colleges and high schools. Designed to emulate the process of the U.N., the extra-curricular program has teams of students researching and studying various countries before coming together at conferences to negotiate and debate current global concerns.\nVinay Nandanampati, a senior at Woodward Academy in College Park, was drawn to Model U.N. as a junior after discovering that it dovetailed with his interest in international affairs and business.\n“I’d done a lot of debating activities and thought this was a great avenue to do more of that,” said the 17-year-old. “I went to my first conference at Georgia Tech and really liked the structure. There were more issues than in debate. It had a wider scope that will give me a good background for the business world.”\nWoodward Academy student Ben Shipp, representing Germany, votes on a procedural motion at the Georgia Tech Model United Nations conference earlier this month. The extracurricular program promotes a deeper understanding of global issues and policies. In April, Nandanampati attended the London International Model U.N. and was named best delegate. His experiences inspired him to bring more people into the program.\n“Our Woodward team is growing, but we want to get more people interested, and one of the best ways to do that is to start our own conference,” he said. “We can invite students at our school, even in the middle school, to get involved. This summer, I went to Georgetown to learn about U.N. structure and the different committees, how to run a conference and how to become a better delegate. Then I proposed the idea of our own conference, and everyone thought it was great.”\nWoodward is planning on hosting a conference in February that would invite about 60 delegates from independent schools in the metro area.\n“Students will learn about parliamentary procedure, how to communicate in sessions and negotiating skills while also learning about a specific country,” explained Ben Shivers, a German instructor and co-sponsor of the Model U.N. program at Woodward.“But they don’t have to come with prior knowledge; they learn as they go. One of the goals of Model U.N. is learning about parts of the world they might not have been familiar with and to understand that country’s perspective during the conference.”\nThose international perspectives are what draws many students to participate in Model U.N., said Shivers. “It gives their education an international component that isn’t as readily available elsewhere. And because it’s role play, it’s very interactive. You get to dress up and go off-campus to an event that’s very results oriented.”\nBy participating in Model U.N, Nandanampati said he has acquired a wealth of knowledge about how countries play with policies to their advantage, as well as gaining an historical background on global issues that has meshed with his studies.\n“In my economics class, we talk about Chinese economy’s effect on global economy, and I already knew a lot about that from Model U.N.,” he said. “As a delegate, I have to be able to speak, convey my thoughts and ideas, and speak and write about what the country you represent thinks is important. It’s a great way to get rid of the fear of public speaking and to network with new people. And now that I know I want to go into policy analysis and management, this experience will be a great help.”\nLearn more about the Model U.N. program at unausa.org.\nInformation about Woodward Academy: woodward.edu or 404-765-4000.", "external_links": ["http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/lt/lt_cache/thumbnail/600/img/photos/2015/10/19/33/c9/102115-UN.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-20T20:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T08:00:33.662+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
