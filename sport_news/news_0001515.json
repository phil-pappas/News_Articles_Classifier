Ducks quarterback Vernon Adams reminded us all why he needs to be protected like the Pope for the remainder of his extended visit in Eugene. And amid all that, a sobering realization.\nOregon still has so much to fix. And so little time to do it.\nThe Ducks beat the Huskies for the 12th straight time, this one 26-20. Officially, the game ended with Oregon taking a knee, following a UW interception, following everyone holding their breath. And before that, the Ducks offense left piles of points in the red zone, and the defense struggled to close out a Washington offense so cumbersome that it looks like a guy trying to perform a three-point turn with a trailer.\nThere was only one big difference between these teams: Adams. The fifth-year senior Oregon lured to Eugene on a one-year mercenary contract. That's how dubious the Ducks season is.\nOn Saturday, the difference was that Washington had a freshman quarterback who went to pieces on critical plays and that Oregon had Adams running around on third down, breaking everyone's heart. Again and again, he completed passes on plays that broke down and re-started again. The Ducks quarterback never completed more than three in a row during the game. But on third downs, Adams completed six of his first nine passes for 202 yards and a touchdown.\nWashington coach Chris Petersen said of Adams: \"Buying time, keeping his eyes down field, converting third downs... that was... that was hard.\"\nWithout Adams, Oregon loses on Saturday night. Be clear. The Ducks season totally unravels and coach Mark Helfrich is faced with some career-crossroads questions.\nDemote defensive coordinator Don Pellum? Take the play-calling duty from offensive coordinator Scott Frost? Do something, right? Right?\nInstead, with Adams, Helfrich's team improves to 4-3 this season, but remains a fatally flawed outfit. The killer instinct just isn't there. The go-to plays aren't there. The defense's bottom-line was better, but threatened to wilt down the stretch against a Huskies team that is limited. Aside from fun helmets and Royce Freeman rushing for 138 yards, there's almost nothing reliable about Oregon anymore.\nBut it won.\nEven the play calling by Oregon was suspect on Saturday. Especially late in the game, with Washington out of timeouts and the Ducks trying to run out the clock. Given a chance to bleed UW out, Oregon inexplicably attempted a pass with only 1:25 left -- incomplete -- and stopped the clock for the Huskies.\nThe move was enough to give Ducks' fans counting down the seconds an ulcer. The only comfort came with the knowledge that the Huskies just aren't equipped to move anywhere on offense quickly this season. A better UW offense might have left Helfrich up all night, regretting a failed two-point conversion attempt on the Ducks' first score.\nOregon is at Arizona State in two weeks. Then, it has back to back games against Cal and at Stanford. Then, home against USC. Then, the in-state rivalry game with Oregon State. Anyone see two certain victories in there? I don't. Would Oregon's season feel like a failure if it doesn't get bowl eligible? You bet.\nOregon wants to recruit alongside Alabama and Ohio State. It wants to be known as a perennial Top-5 program. It wants to have staying power as an elite football university, and not fade away like Texas and USC have since playing for a national title a decade ago. The Ducks built that 145,000-square foot football building to not only get near the top, but stay there. But this season, what I'm more interested in learning is whether this undermanned team that is searching desperately for its identity can pull itself together and make a Las Vegas Bowl.\nDon't care that Adams is rented. Don't care that the defense's secondary is young. Don't care that Oregon has had injuries and lost a Heisman-trophy winning quarterback to the draft. And I especially don't care to hear from the revisionists who claim Oregon is only two plays from being 6-1.\nTwo plays? From 6-1? That's apologist talk. This is a flawed team that has failed to make plays when it counted. It's deserved the four wins, and merited those three losses.\nFrom this point, I only care that this team shows the kind of resolve some of its fans have demonstrated and wrings everything it can out of the rest of this season. Because if it doesn't care to finish, what's the point starting?\nCan the Ducks keep Adams healthy? ( I've wondered since Game 1 ). Will it work to discover another reliable dimension on offense to go with Freeman? Can Pellum quiet his critics against a more threatening offense? And if the season totally unravels in the next month, will Helfrich make a difficult staff decision in the off-season?\nThose are only the beginning of the questions for Oregon. Because the only thing put to rest on Saturday was that Washington just isn't there yet. The Ducks may have left Seattle winners of a dozen straight head-to-head matchups, but this tussle hasn't been this close in some time.\n\"I thought a really gutty performance by our team,\" Helfrich said. \"... our guys battled.\"\nI'm sure he knows it. But it's just begun.\n--- @JohnCanzanoBFT", "external_links": ["http://www.twitter.com/JohnCanzanoBFT"], "published": "2015-10-18T08:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T12:04:47.143+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
