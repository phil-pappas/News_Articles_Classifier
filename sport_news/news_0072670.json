Yes, said Claude Julien, Don Sweeney and Cam Neely, respectively, we want our team to play fast, take some risks, try to score more goals – but we’re still going to play defense. The second part of that message was effectively ignored for about two-thirds of Thursday’s 2015-16 season opener, and the Bruins took a 6-2 thrashing from the Winnipeg Jets as a result. While the final score makes it seem that the B’s were unable to withstand the challenge of playing without captain Zdeno Chara, who had to stay on Injured Reserve with an upper body injury, Julien wasn’t buying that. “It’s not about youth. It’s not about the young (defensemen),’’ the coach said. “It’s about our game without the puck. I think we might have got a little excited about our offense, and then forgot about the other part of our game.’’ Chara’s absence, in fact, was hardly noticed in the first period because the B’s got by without him in the best way possible: They had the puck all the time, and didn’t have to defend. The result was a 12-6 advantage in shots and a 1-0 lead, established when David Krejci took advantage of the type of forechecking the Bruins want – courtesy of teenage linemate David Pastrnak – and beat Ondrej Pavelec (29 saves) on a backhander after just 5:36. The new, up-tempo system produced other excellent chances – Chris Kelly and Jimmy Hayes weren’t able to convert in front of nearly empty nets – but Krejci’s goal was to be the best of times against a team the Bruins had beaten 13 straight times on home ice. “I thought we did a pretty good job of creating a bunch of scoring chances,“ Krejci said, “but on the other hand, we totally forgot about our defensive game.’’ The Jets exploited that amnesia to put together two multiple-goal clusters. They wiped out Krejci’s lead on goals at 5:26, 9:17 and 17:39 of the second period, and after Pastrnak cut the lead to 3-2 early in the third, the Bruins made it easy for the visitors to score at 5:17 and 9:51. Winnipeg’s final goal hit an empty net. “Even after we make it 3-2, we turn around, don’t have layers covering our (defenseman), who does the right job of battling on the wall,“ Julien said. “We’re not respecting that part of our game. They come back and make it 4-2, and take the wind right out of our sails.’’ Page 2 of 2 - Some goals were especially hard to watch. Mark Scheifele’s tying goal in the second period came after the Matt Beleskey-Krejci-Pastrnak line turned over the puck at the red line, and the Jets turned it into an easy goal off a rush. It became 2-1 when Andrew Ladd calmly stripped defenseman Matt Irwin (minus-3) of the puck behind the Bruins’ net and fed an uncovered Blake Wheeler, who snapped a shot past a startled Tuukka Rask (26 saves). Drew Stafford’s goal with 2:21 left in the second, which stood up as the game winner, came after the line of Hayes, Ryan Spooner and Brett Connolly, backed by Irwin and Zach Trotman, spent an entire shift trapped in the defensive zone. That group struggled a little more than most on Thursday, with Irwin and Spooner minus-3 and the others minus-2. They weren’t alone: Even Patrice Bergeron and linemate Loui Eriksson were both minus-2. “There’s a lot of things that are our fault,’’ said Bergeron, who became furious after taking a first-period Alexander Burmistrov head shot that Julien suggested the NHL review. “We’ve got to take … what’s bad, and make sure we fix it. We can’t just sit here and say we generated some good chances. We’ve got to find some results, keep harping on that (Friday) and be better on Saturday.’’ There’s not much time for the B’s to wallow. They host the Canadiens on Saturday night, with Eastern Conference champion Tampa Bay in town for a Monday matinee. “We’ve got to work and rectify those things as soon as possible,’’ Julien said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T11:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T00:06:52.357+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
