We need to be strong all over the park and we need to be tight, \n\"We have to defend well and attack well as a team but I think those are our attributes.\" \nIndeed, the midfielder insists Scotland are in fine fettle ahead of the crunch encounter against a side with whom they drew 2-2 in Warsaw a year ago. \nHe said: \"Everyone is on form, our strikers are scoring goals, our defenders are defending well and midfielders are playing well too. \n\"That is what you need going into these games. \n\"You have to have a lot of confidence and players in each position playing really well and we have got that throughout the squad. \n\"We have two huge games to put it right, hopefully. \n\"Everyone in the changing room is looking forward to the game and hopefully we can get the three points.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T10:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T19:54:03.967+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
