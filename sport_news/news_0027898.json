I think she was trying to help the two men inside.\"\nAs the woman, Lee Barnes exited, Gluckleder headed upstairs to the second floor, dropping onto his stomach and crawling in the darkness, he said. As he reached the top of the stairs, \"I felt arms on the floor.\" Firefighters had not yet arrived.\nGluckleder said he struggled to bring Tyree Miller Jr. down the stairs because Miller is a large man. Gluckleder said he rolled Miller Jr. down step by step, having to leave a couple of times to go downstairs for air.\nOnce he got the man to the first floor, three city workers who were at the scene dragged Miller Jr. from the house, he said.\nChicago Heights firefighters Dennis Sullivan, Daily Southtown Before Chicago Heights firefighters arrived at this house Wednesday morning, a Steger man had rescued two men from the burning house. Before Chicago Heights firefighters arrived at this house Wednesday morning, a Steger man had rescued two men from the burning house. (Dennis Sullivan, Daily Southtown) Gluckleder then re-entered the house and rescued Tyree Miller Sr., 88, whom he also found on the floor at the top of the stairs. He said the elderly man was much lighter, but \"he kept slipping in my hands. When I got him outside, I realized his skin was coming off.\"\nAll three fire victims were transported to Franciscan St. James Health Medical Center in Chicago Heights, and the elder Miller was later airlifted to Loyola Medical Center in Maywood. A Loyola spokesman said Thursday evening that he could not comment on Miller Sr.'s condition.\nA source in the Chicago Heights Fire Department, who didn't have authority to speak to news media, said Miller Sr. had burns over 60 percent of his body, his son suffered from smoke inhalation, and Barnes, who also lives in the home, was treated for burns on her arm and hands.\nGluckleder was treated at St. James for smoke inhalation and was released.\nIn a statement, Chicago Heights Mayor David Gonzalez credited Gluckleder with saving the lives of the two men.\n\"Mr. Gluckleder's heroic act helped prevent further injury or loss of life from this tragic event,\" Gonzalez said. \"He is to be commended for his courageous response as we pray for the Miller family.\"\nAnother son of Miller Sr., Curtys Miller, of University Park, said a space heater ignited a window treatment on the second floor of the house. He said father has lived in the house for 50 years.\nDennis Sullivan is a freelance reporter.\nCopyright Â© 2015, Daily Southtown", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-562067d9/turbine/ct-ct-sta-chicago-heights-fire-st-1-2-jpg-20151015", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-562067d8/turbine/ct-sta-chicago-heights-fire-st-1015-20151015"], "published": "2015-10-16T15:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T18:58:05.825+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
