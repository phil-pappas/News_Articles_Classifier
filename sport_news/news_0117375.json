If your answer is to get relief from stress, to experience joy, to kill time, to know God -- wrong! Absolutely wrong! Utterly wrong! Don't be surprised. We can get relief from stress by a thousand things. A good movie, a cricket or soccer match, tennis, music, dance, and list will go on and on. Company of like-minded people gives joy, all adventure sports give a great kick, an adrenaline rush and wow! What an experience! If you have been meditating for the sake of getting relief or looking for joy, then you are really confused and don't know what meditation really is. Meditation is not getting relief from stress but it is much more than that.\nMeditation is moving in the inner zone of emptiness, where stress can never touch you. It is exploring the inner space where you remain absolutely untouched from all ill effects of mind and samsara. This inner space is there and we just need the right method to move there; once you have understood and experienced this space, nothing can bring you down from that timeless zone. Being in this zone means being an ocean of joy. It is not just getting little glimpses of joy for some time and then falling back in rut. This has always been a great dilemma of those who meditate -- as long as they are doing it, they feel good, elated, happy, but the moment they come out of the meditation room, they find that they are back to square one. Things are exactly the same -- people still bother you, you get offended often, jealousies and prejudices are very much intact. Now individuals begin to plan when they can run away to their safe haven. So they are always avoiding the issue. To them, being an escapist seems very romantic. It seems to provide an easy way out, a short cut to all problems. Meditation is a way of life. It is to be lived. We have a vast reservoir of energy in us, lying unused, untapped. Once we get in touch with this energy, our life changes from just being an ordinary one to a divine one.\nThe author is a guru, mystic, contemporary spiritual master.
