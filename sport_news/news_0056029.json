This is exciting and we’re excited for sectionals, too.” \nWith the game deadlocked at 1-1 through the first half, Miles quickly collected in the ball after it deflected off an opposing player and scored in the 55th minute, with eighth-grader Zoey Shank assisting, to provide Watertown (12-1-3) with a lead it would not relinquish. \n“It was what we expected it would be,” Watertown coach Mike VanNostrand said of game’s intensity. “Beating a team a third time is tough as we know them and they know us. They’re good and are a solid team — we were fortunate to come away with a win.” \nFreshman goalkeeper Kayla Meyer made four saves, including a critical stop in the second half to preserve the victory. \n“Kayla played really well for us,” said VanNostrand, whose team is unbeaten in 12 games (10-0-2) against league competition this season. “She’s really come a long way for us this year.” \nMiles opened the scoring as she finished off a feed from senior Darcy Dyer in the 12th minute. \n“She’s a special player,” VanNostrand said of Miles. “Her desire to win is unmatched and I think we saw that again today.” \nIHC (9-6-1) drew even at 1-1 as senior Charisse Lapointe headed in a pass from eighth-grader Kate O’Neil in the 31st minute. \nHowever, the Cyclones were able to fend off the Cavaliers the rest of the way. \n“It was a little helter-skelter there towards the end, we had to play a little defense,” VanNostrand said. “But that’s OK, we don’t mind playing defense sometimes.” \nWatertown, which won the division in the regular season, claimed its fifth division playoff title over a span of eight years. \n“In the playoffs, it’s always going to be a good game, especially against IHC because they’re our rival,” Dyer said. “We just came out strong and we really wanted to win — it was a fun game.” \nFreshman goalie Amanda McElheran finished with 11 saves for the Cavaliers, including making eight stops in the second half to keep her team within reach. \nThe Cavaliers, a mostly young team with only two seniors on their roster, played in the program’s first division final since 2011. \n“We played well,” IHC coach Kurt Robbins said. “We’re so super young with eighth and ninth graders, I thought we played very well. We had our chances to score and we didn’t score and they capitalized on the two good ones that they had. I’m very happy with our kids, they worked their tails off.” \nSACKETS HARBOR 3, LYME 2 \nGray and Mendelson each tallied a goal within a span of seven minutes in the second half to help lift the top-seeded Patriots past the third-seeded Indians in the league’s “D” Division final. \n“This is our first playoff title for girls soccer ever, so this is nice,” Sackets Harbor coach Dan Green said. “I was looking at the banners at school and the last time we won a regular-season title was in 2006, so it’s real nice to win both this year.” \nSophomore goalie Hailey Martin made seven saves to gain the win for the Patriots (15-1), who recorded their eighth consecutive victory, and are ranked seventh in the state in Class D. \n“It’s very, very nice,” Mendelson said. “I enjoy being on a team that’s made it this far. I think what’s really special with us is we have a good bond on and off the field; we’re a very close team.” \nFreshman Akasha Gaige generated a pair of goals in the first half for Lyme (6-7-1), as she scored just 39 seconds into the game as she pounced on a loose ball and scored into an open net. \nSackets Harbor responded just one minute and eight seconds later as Gray sent a ball up and over the outstretched hands of sophomore goalie Keerah McCratic in the game’s second minute. \n“We knew this was going to be a tough game, we just had to get through it,” Gray said. “We really wanted this one.” \nLyme responded as Gaige scored in the 24th minute by curling the ball just under the crossbar, with senior Taylor Brown assisting, for a 2-1 lead it would hold into the second half. \nWith the Patriots controlling much of the play in the second half, Gray struck for the tying goal at 2-2 as she converted on a direct kick in the 53rd minute. \nMendelson followed with the go-ahead and deciding goal as she finished off a crossing pass from Gray in the 60th minute with 19:11 remaining in regulation. \n“She’s a phenomenal player that times it right with her passes,” Mendelson said. “We also have a lot of players on our team who give the ball up easily and aren’t selfish.” \nMcCratic made eight saves for Lyme, which defeated second-seeded LaFargeville, 1-0 on Wednesday to reach the final. \n“I think we fought until the end and played as team,” Brown said. “I think this was one of our best games this year, so it’s disappointing. But I think this team will do well again next year and will have more chances.”  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T08:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T12:33:55.406+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
