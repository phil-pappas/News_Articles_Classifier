He's the only season I watched the finals, to see if Kimmo would get a chance to raise the Cup. When he did, it was pretty awesome. It was pretty cool to see.''\nSimmonds believes other players are picking up the slack left by Timonen's departure.\n\"I think we miss Kimmo's complete presence,'' Simmonds said. \"It probably forced guys into roles that they probably wouldn't have been in. It's a learning process and we're growing in here together.\n\"This is my fifth year here. I've played with 70-, 80-percent of these guys, so we're growing together.''\nMichael Raffl is only in his third season with the Flyers but he appreciates the time he spent with Timonen.\n\"A great person off the ice,'' Raffl said. \"One of the nicest guys to have around the locker room for sure.\n\"He was a true leader and someone has to step up now. He knew what he was talking about all the time.''\nMatt Read offers that Timonen was a major influence on him when he walked in the door as an untested free agent out of college.\n\"A veteran presence and he played through so many injuries,'' Read said. \"A warrior out there. Came to play every night and never took a night off.\n\"For me, coming in my rookie year, he was a guy I looked up to. He kind of showed you the ropes, on and off the ice.''\nRead said the Timonens of the world are not a \"dime a dozen.''\n\"It's hard to replace a defenseman like that, who play 82 games a year,'' said Read, perhaps mindful that Timonen played 397 of a possible 410 games his first five seasons with the Flyers. \"He played big minutes on the power play, penalty kill.\n\"It's just the words of wisdom, he's played over a thousand games. But the guys in the locker room this year have certainly done a good job. Saying the right things at the right time – that's what Kimmo was before.''\nMason to skate Wednesday: Goaltender Steve Mason, who left the team on Monday to tend to a family matter, is expected to return on Wednesday to take part in the morning skate.\nHowever, with Michal Neuvirth coming off a 1-0 shutout of the Florida Panthers on Monday night, the Czech goaltender is likely to get the start against the Blackhawks.\n\"They're a great team and it's going to be a good test,'' he said.\nWEDNESDAY\nWhat: Chicago Blackhawks at Flyers.\nWhen: 8:05.\nWhere: Wells Fargo Center.\nTV/Radio: NBCSN/97.5-FM.\nSeason series: First meeting.\nWhat to watch: Excluding the 2010 Stanley Cup finals, the Flyers haven't lost a home game to the Blackhawks since 1996 (11 straight). . .Chicago has won two of three, losing only on opening night against the Rangers. . .Captain Claude Giroux is getting more ice time on the penalty kill. Coach Dave Hakstol said: \"I think he's doing a good job on the PK early on here. We'll stay with it.'' The Flyers went six for six on the kill vs. Florida. . .Hakstol on facing Chicago's Jonathan Toews (his most famous graduate from the North Dakota days): \"It's a regular game day. If we run into each other, we'll have a chance to say hello. But it's a game day and that's our focus.''", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T23:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T21:34:16.348+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
