While Patterson instituted some changes even critics saw as necessary, he basically alienated nearly everyone in burnt orange.\nFormer Texas linebacker and Houston lawyer Mike Perrin will be the interim athletic director and the start of the school year is admittedly an awkward time to do an AD search. Then again, Texas hired Patterson in the fall, too.\nAnd a lot of the names being thrown around are the same names that were tossed out there two years ago? Bob Bowlsby? Oliver Luck?\nHere's a look at some possible candidates who may surface:\nMack Brown, ESPN: As the news broke, Brown's former players flooded Twitter with endorsements for him as AD. He actually did the job before at Tulane and he's still on the Texas payroll -- remember the Dubai trip? Brown would be a great fund- raiser. But a bunch of people look at the football product and still hold Brown accountable. Brown supervising successor Charlie Strong could get awkward. He might not be the uniter Texas needs now. Probably not happening.\nOliver Luck, NCAA: He probably should have been the choice the last time when he was West Virginia athletic director. Would he still be interested now as a high- ranking NCAA official in the same town where his son, Andrew, plays quarterback for the Indianapolis Colts? He does have a law degree from Texas and an impeccable reputation.\nTom Jurich, Louisville: He's on the short list of top athletic directors in the country. He hired Charlie Strong at Louisville and likes him a lot. Louisville is a very good all-around athletic program. Jurich built a downtown arena for the basketball team and Texas will need a new basketball arena soon. On the negative, the Bobby Petrino experiment is still a work in progress. After 18 years at Louisville, would Jurich really want to leave?\nJoe Castiglione, Oklahoma: At the very least, Texas would be wise to gauge Castiglione's interest in the job with a call north of the Red River. He's another AD regarded among the very best at we does. He knows big-time football and the challenges at Texas. The Longhorns would need a major sales pitch to lure him out of Norman.\nChris Del Conte, TCU: He got TCU in the Big 12 and renovated a football stadium without amassing any debt. He could fund-raise and probably knows some Texas big money folks better than Patterson. But he's got private school background and seems like a great fit at TCU. He took himself out of the running via Twitter on Tuesday.\nGreg Byrne, Arizona: Bill Byrne's son in burnt orange? Talk about your family feud. But Byrne is one of a group of bright young administrators who seem to get the sports, people and business challenges of the job.\nJohn Currie, Kansas State: Sharp guy who has done well in a tough job without the resources of Texas or several other Big 12 schools. He oversaw a nice football stadium expansion. Texas had a lot of success with a former Kansas State athletic director once.\nFollow Chuck Carlton on Twitter at @ChuckCarltonDMN\nMore on split of Texas, Steve Patterson\n(Eric Gay/AP)\nCarlton: Steve Patterson provided blueprint of what not to do as Texas athletic director\nTexas AD Steve Patterson out after two years with Longhorns\nSherrington: With AD out, no sure things at Texas for Charlie Strong, others\nPossible Texas AD candidates include Mack Brown and Big 12 competitors\nTom Hicks calls Steve Patterson's firing 'a tragedy,' but his own fault due to 'fatal flaw'\nNational reaction: Ex-Longhorns lobby for Mack Brown to replace Steve Patterson as Texas AD\nTexas president Greg Fenves sends email to Longhorn faithful, pledges support for Charlie Strong, Shaka Smart\nNational Analyst: Steve Patterson was 'too arrogant' for Texas\nOn Twitter:\n @ChuckCarltonDMN", "external_links": ["http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/09/15/national-analyst-steve-patterson-arrogant-texas", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/09/15/tom-hicks-calls-steve-pattersons-firing-tragedy-fault-due-fatal-flaw-inability-communicate", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/09/15/carlton-steve-patterson-provided-blueprint-texas-athletic-director", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/texaslonghorns/2015/09/15/possible-candidates-texas-ad-job-include-mack-brown-big-12-competitors", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/09/16/report-mack-brown-interested-texas-ad-job", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/texaslonghorns/2015/09/15/sherrington-pattersons-legacy-texas-one-acidic-relationships", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/texaslonghorns/2015/09/15/texas-ad-steve-patterson-fired", "https://twitter.com/ChuckCarltonDMN", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/09/15/texas-ad-steve-patterson-resigns-mike-perrin-serve-interim", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/09/15/longhorn-players-media-react-texas-ad-steve-pattersons-firing"], "published": "2015-09-15T23:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T13:12:15.715+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
