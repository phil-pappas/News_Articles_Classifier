Myers responded with a career-high 260 yards on 18 of 25 passing with a touchdown. \nDamion Hobbs came on in relief of Myers after the third quarter and added 50 yards on the ground and was 1 of 2 through the air for 21 yards. \nHunter Sharp was Myers' favorite target grabbing six catches for 99 yards. Devonte Robinson caught four passes for 80 yards, including the 44-yard screen pass right before halftime that stretched the score to 29-7. Five other Aggies caught passes on the night. \nUtah State scored nearly all its points on the ground with Devante Mays scoring a career-high three touchdowns with LaJuan Hunt adding two. Hobbs and Justen Hervey each tacked on one late in the game. \nDefensive dominated in a similar fashion. The Aggies gave up only 194 total yards and forced three turnovers. They pressured redshirt freshman Bulldog quarterback Kilton Anderson all night piling up five sacks and 10 tackles for loss. Nick Vigil led the defense with nine tackles. \nThere were a few negatives for Utah State in the route. Place-kicker Brock Warren missed two extra points which, in the scheme of things, isn't that big of a deal against Fresno but against Boise State next weekend the Aggies will need every point they can get. \nThe Aggies were also sluggish to start the game. They averaged just 2.5 yards a carry and had a costly turnover that set Fresno State up for an easy touchdown. The Aggies ended the first quarter tied with a bad team. \nOverall, outside the first quarter, the Aggies did what they were supposed to do against a bad Fresno State team. They controlled the game. They did not force the ball on the ground or through the air. Instead, the Aggies the took what the Bulldog defense was willing to give them, and they took full advantage of that. They spread the ball around and were so efficient they were able to have most backups in by the end of the third quarter. \nThe defense nearly pitched a shutout. The Aggies held the Bulldog rushing attack to 82 yards on 42 carries. The Aggies handled everything they were supposed to in what turned into a tune-up game before Utah State's biggest and most important game of the season with Boise State. \nBoise State has been the Aggies Achilles' heel for years, but if the Aggies play like they did Saturday night, it will make for an incredible Mountain West Conference showdown.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T15:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T18:52:16.032+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
