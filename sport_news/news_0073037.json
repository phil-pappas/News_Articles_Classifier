(AP) - Vicksburg's water treatment plant is going private\nThe Vicksburg Post reports ( http://bit.ly/1W4Yxb7 ) the move will result in the possible layoff of the eight city employees working there.\nThe Board of Mayor and Aldermen Monday approved an agreement with Jackson-based engineering firm CDM Smith to help city officials prepare requirements for requests for proposals from companies interested in taking over the water treatment plant.\nThe cost of the move and whether it will save the city money, is undetermined. Mayor George Flaggs Jr. said part of the CDM's contract requires the company examine the possible cost savings to the city. The fiscal 2016 budget for the water treatment plant is $5.072 million.\nInformation from: The Vicksburg Post, http://www.vicksburgpost.com\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
