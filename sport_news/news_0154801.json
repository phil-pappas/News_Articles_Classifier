The Red Sox have their long-held personal position against signing pitchers to long-term contracts into their 30s. But nothing would alter the forecast for this Boston roster more than the addition of a front-line pitcher, and this offseason's presence of Price on the free-agent market will prove the greatest test of John Henry's pitching preferences. Even in a free-agent class alongside Zack Greinke (presuming he opts out), Johnny Cueto and Jordan Zimmermann, Price stands out. His on-field résumé speaks for itself. The left-hander has a good chance of winning his second Cy Young award this season, after finishing with an 18-5 record with a league-leading 2.45 ERA. His 220 1/3 innings were third in the American League, a year after leading the league with just shy of 250 frames. He's been a model of consistency on the mound, and he has handled the A.L. East, and then some. He is, as much as anyone in baseball, an obvious Game One starter, as he will be Thursday when postseason baseball returns to Toronto for the first time in 22 seasons. But if you talk to some of the people who have coached or played with Price, they'll emphasize all that the pitcher brings when he isn't on the mound — and perhaps it's those ancillary benefits that will give Boston that last nudge in its pursuit of the pitcher. \"It's just a level of expectation that can go without being stated. He can go out there and show you what's expected — and it's not even eight innings, less than two runs, no walks every night,\" said Tampa Bay's Chris Archer, who played parts of three seasons with Price. \"It's more than that. He does everything by example. He commands respect, but not verbally. You watch what he does, and you're like, 'OK, that’s what someone who is great does, and I'm going to do it.'\" \"It's not necessary to have a clear-cut, No. 1 alpha-male in your rotation; you can win without it. But it makes things a heck of a lot easier if you do have that guy,\" said Rays pitching coach Jim Hickey, who has held that position since before Price made his startling major-league debut for the team in 2008. \"Even with the talent that we had here, he was absolutely the guy that everyone would defer to. He was the clear-cut No. 1. \"It's a great situation with him personally because he did everything right. He did everything right on the field, he did everything right off the field, he did everything right in the weight room, on the bench he was a great teammate. That’s really important. If you had the guy who was the clear-cut No. 1 and he wasn’t a particularly good citizen or a particularly good teammate, that could cut the other way. With David, that’s never a consideration. It's a luxury.\" When Archer was a 23-year-old coming up to the majors for the first time in 2012, Price was already an All-Star and in the midst of a Cy Young season. Archer realized right away what it would take to get on Price's level. \"It allows you to say, 'All right, I've worked my whole way here. This is not a time to stop working. This is a time to work even harder,'\" he said. \"When you're in the minor leagues, you're battling completely different obstacles and your mentality is different. When you get here and you get settled in and you know you're on the team, there's a whole other list of accomplishments you want to achieve. Watching him and talking to him helps you grasp what you're actually trying to do out there. \"He just sets the bar so high, so it reshapes every way you look at your career and it challenges you to be the absolute best you can be.\" \"Whoever ends up signing him after this year, that’s a huge benefit they're going to reap that they're not even counting on,\" said Hickey. \"It really helps when the clubhouse can be policed and the pitching staff can be policed without any of the coaching staff or the front office getting involved.\" The Red Sox have a shaky history in that regard, dating back to the end of 2011. Before his departure in August, Ben Cherington had talked about the importance of having an alpha personality in the starting rotation. With a new class of pitchers — and predominantly left-handed ones — graduating through the upper minor leagues, the prospect of adding Price as an ace and mentor is tantalizing. What did Archer learn from Price? \"Everything really,\" he said. \"He's just a good teammate, being on the top step cheering on your team and the guy who's on the mound pitching, supporting each other in our throwing program and practice. He does that. If he's doing that and you're not, you feel uncomfortable because you're the new guy and he's the old guy. I should be doing that, too.\" The likelihood is that whichever team signs Price this winter overpays in the long term. That’s the case with every big-name pitcher who hits the market, now and perhaps in perpetuity. And it's possible to point out that after adding Max Scherzer the Nationals had a much worse season in 2015, that the Padres were looking to get out from under James Shields' contract three months into it and that the Red Sox rotation was actually pretty good down the stretch. But Price can offer the kind of value in the short- to medium-term that mitigates whatever may happen in the back end of a deal. And just in case, Hickey also thinks teams shouldn’t be scared away by the idea of Price aging. He sees in Price the smooth mechanics and a remarkable mental adaptability to continue succeeding deep into his fourth decade. Just these past few months, Price has adopted a more cutter-heavy approach, leading to outstanding results with the Blue Jays. \"I'm absolutely confident that he'll be the same type of pitcher when he's 35 and 36 years old,\" Hickey said. \"I don’t see him physically deteriorating. I don’t see the velocity dropping off all that much. \"However, the thing that sets him apart from a lot of other guys is his intelligence and his aptitude. All of a sudden, if he had Mark Buehrle's stuff, there's no doubt in my mind that he would become the David Price of soft-tossing left-handers because of the aptitude, because of the intelligence, because of the fact that he really loves the game, too.\" By Tim Britton", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T07:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T07:19:45.931+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
