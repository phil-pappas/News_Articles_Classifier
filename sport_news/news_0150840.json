But that won’t make life any easier for the top-ranked Buckeyes against the Nittany Lions in Ohio Stadium today (8 p.m., ABC).\n\"Hackenberg really likes to sit in the pocket because he’s a great passer, a real pro-style quarterback,\" Ohio State All-American defensive end Joey Bosa said. \"He’s not as afraid of pressure as the last few quarterbacks because the last few quarterbacks, they see pressure, they’re out of there right away.\"\nIn the past two games Indiana backup QB Zander Diamont ran 79 yards for a touchdown against the Buckeyes and Maryland’s Perry Hills breached the defense on a 75-yard run in addition to throwing a 52-yard touchdown pass.\n\"We have to do a better job of containing the quarterback,\" Ohio State co-defensive coordinator Chris Ash said.\nThe Buckeyes have a better idea what they’re getting from Hackenberg, a junior who has started the past two seasons against them. He’s passed for 1,086 yards with seven touchdowns and two interceptions this season.\nBut just as the Buckeyes prepare for Hackenberg the passer, he had touchdown runs of 1 and 5 yards versus Indiana last week, jokingly drawing comparisons by his coach to OSU quarterback J.T. Barrett.\n\"Hack is competing right now with Barrett to be the No. 1 dual-threat quarterback in the Big Ten based on last week’s performance,\" Penn State coach James Franklin said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T04:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T08:33:45.848+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
