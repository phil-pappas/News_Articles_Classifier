Ohio State had three in as many snaps Saturday against Maryland.\nIf you were scoring at home, it went from pocket passer Cardale Jones to muscular wildcat wraith Braxton Miller to red zone closer J.T. Barrett.\nRather than raising questions, it answered them.\nOn the open steppes, Glenville's Jones, \"12 Gauge\" by uniform number and arm strength, is the choice of coach Urban Meyer. Jones can make an opponent defend every inch of the field, stretching the defense until it breaks, using nothing more than the flick of his wrist.\nThe value of that is not as high as it once was, though, because only Michael Thomas has the speed to pose a deep threat similar to Devin Smith last season.\nBacked up against his own goal-line, Jones has the strength to resist sacks for safeties and the size to stand tall in the pocket and deliver first-down conversions. He showed both to advantage against Alabama and Oregon in the College Football Playoff.\nIn Saturday's 49-28 victory over Maryland at the Horseshoe, Jones threw for two touchdowns, 291 yards and no interceptions.\nIt was, however, always dodgy using Jones, a 6-5, 250-pounder who wears a protective leg brace, as a running threat, despite the memory of his plowing under a 320-pound Oregon nose tackle in the national championship game. Jones is simply not elusive enough -– dodgy enough, if you will -– in the open field.\nIn the red zone, when the field shrinks and so do the openings in the defense, the premium is on fast-twitch players such as Miller and quick decision-makers such as Barrett.\nIn their previous three games, against Mid-American Conference teams Northern Illinois and Western Michigan and customary Big Ten also-ran Indiana, the Buckeyes were six-for-nine in red zone conversions. That's not that good, even less so when you consider field goals accounted for five of the scores.\nThe Buckeyes were six-for-six, all of them touchdowns, against the Terps. Barrett directed five of the scores.\nSituational specialization is the trend in all sports. In football, there are edge rushers and nickel backs on defense. There are third-down possession receivers and short-yardage backs on offense.\nPlaying two quarterbacks, even in clearly defined situational roles, might undermine the old quarterback ethos of one team, one leader. Just pick one and stick with him, say the Old Schoolers. Meyer sees it differently.\nIt's not as if a two-quarterback system cannot work. Concerns over differing snap cadences, \"foot cues\" and handoff meshes are probably overblown with players who have been through the fires, such as Jones and Barrett.\nMeyer crushed Ohio State in the 2006 national championship game when he was Florida's coach with Chris Leak getting most of the snaps and Tim Tebow bulling forward and then throwing a jump pass for a 1-yard touchdown.\n\"We all know (Florida) had a great run doing that,\" said offensive coordinator Ed Warinner. \"But it was just what can we do to improve our red zone offense? How can we get the ball in? With coach Meyer's past experience I'm sure that helped trigger the thought that maybe J.T.'s role could be the red zone specialist.\"\nLSU's Les Myles beat the Buckeyes in the 2007 national championship game, using Matt Flynn and Ryan Perilloux at the game's most important position.\nIn the 2011 national championship game, however, Myles' Tigers failed to score at all as Alabama reversed a loss in a field goal battle during the regular season. Myles had used Jordan Jefferson and Jarret Lee all season, but he stuck with Jefferson for the entire title game.\nNow 44-3 at Ohio State, Meyer seems at times like the ultimate, veins-popping locker room motivator in the videos Ohio State releases before big games. At other times, he seems like an old psychology major, which is exactly what he was at the University of Cincinnati, using a blend of Corporate Speak and psychological catch phrases.\nMost of all, he is an optimist. As well as he has recruited, he knows something will turn up.\nJones and Barrett turned up together Saturday. Why not a \"Mr. Inside (the 20)\" and a \"Mr. Outside\" at quarterback?\nAt least this way, if the Buckeyes go down, they will do so using all their weapons.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T02:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T12:26:47.420+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
