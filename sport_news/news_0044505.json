Giants during the fourth quarter on Sunday, Oct. 11, 2015, in East Rutherford, N.J. Bill Kostroun The Associated Press i \nmbarrows@sacbee.com EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. \nColin Kaepernick’s confidence rebounded dramatically by the end of Sunday night’s game against the New York Giants, but it wasn’t enough to overcome counterpart Eli Manning’s 441-yard effort. \nManning threw for three touchdowns, the last a 12-yarder to tight end Larry Donnell with 21 seconds remaining that gave New York a 30-27 win. \nThat touchdown erased an impressive fourth-quarter drive directed by Kaepernick. He connected with wide receiver Torrey Smith for a 25-yard gain and hit Anquan Boldin for 26 yards to help set up Carlos Hyde’s two-yard touchdown run that put the 49ers ahead 27-23 with 1:45 to play. \nSmith and Boldin had been visibly upset during the 49ers’ meager offensive outings in the previous two games, illustrating the frustration with Kaepernick and the offensive scheme. \nOn Sunday, however, Kaepernick bounced back, attacking the field deep and converting third-down throws. He completed 23 of 35 attempts for 262 yards and two touchdowns with no interceptions. \nNevertheless, the 49ers (1-4) lost their fourth in a row and fell three games behind the first-place Arizona Cardinals in the NFC West. \nEarly in the game, the 49ers’ play callers appeared to be trying to rebuild Kaepernick’s confidence. \nHyde carried four times for seven yards on the opening drive and had eight carries in the first half, equaling the number of times he ran the ball in a Week 4 loss to the Green Bay Packers. \nAnd Kaepernick was asked to make short throws, two of which were screens to Bruce Ellington that the wideout turned into gains of 30 and nine yards. But Ellington wasn’t used much on offense from that point, and the Giants began zeroing in on Hyde, who had only 12 rushing yards at halftime. \nWith Manning carving up the 49ers’ defense, the pressure was on Kaepernick to keep pace. He seemed to hit his stride during San Francisco’s first possession of the third quarter. Kaepernick hit Boldin on a 37-yard pass down the right side, one of the few times the quarterback pushed the ball deep in recent weeks. \nAnother long throw – this one a would-be 43-yard touchdown – seemed to be on target to Vance McDonald but landed just beyond the tight end’s fingertips. \nThe drive also included a run by tailback Jarryd Hayne, substituting for the injured Reggie Bush, on third down deep in Giants territory when the 49ers needed to pick up one yard. The Aussie newcomer gained eight yards, the longest run of the season for the rookie, giving San Francisco a first down at the New York 3. \nOn the next play, Kaepernick sprinted to his right and threw a quick pass to Boldin at the pilon – the quarterback’s first touchdown pass since Week 2 against the Pittsburgh Steelers. \nAfter Manning’s 17-yard touchdown pass to Odell Beckham Jr. gave New York a 20-13 lead late in the third quarter, Kaepernick engineered an 80-yard drive during which he converted three third downs. The last, from the Giants’ 5, came when he found tight end Garrett Celek in the middle of the end zone. It was the first touchdown by a 49ers tight end since Week 1 of the 2014 season. \nManning set a career high with 54 pass attempts, completing 41 with one interception. \nMatt Barrows: @mattbarrows , read more about the team at sacbee.com/sf49ers .
