We had extension discussions for a reason. And then we went for it on a player (Jordan) that wasn't ready to be gone for.\"\nChandler has on several occasions expressed bitterness about the way things played out, though he seemed to soften his stance while sitting in the visitors' locker room Wednesday, surrounded by reporters. I asked Chandler if he anticipates ever talking things out with Cuban.\n\"I don't have any problems with him or having a conversation with him,\" Chandler said. \"We're two grown men. There's no hatred in my heart for Mark Cuban. If anything he put me in position to succeed twice. I don't have no ill will.\n\"He went for a home run when I was here in getting Rondo. He was still trying to put pieces to the puzzle to get the team over the hump. Maybe we will, maybe we won't (talk), but I'm not against it.\"\nSince purchasing the Mavericks in January 2000, Cuban has attempted to build a winning culture, one in which players feel welcome _ and want to remain once they are here. Is Cuban concerned about the mixed messages that the Chandler situation appeared to send? Chandler helped the Mavericks win the 2011 NBA title, but the Mavericks only offered him a one-year deal in which to return. Instead, he signed a four-year deal with the Knicks. Three years later, Dallas acquired Chandler from the Knicks, with Cuban saying \"I learn from my mistakes.\"\nAnd when Chandler again became a free agent, the Mavericks put talks on hold with Chandler and attempted to woo Jordan. I asked Cuban if he worries about how other players might perceive what happened with Chandler.\n\"You always worry a little bit, but at the same time, at least we're honest about the whole thing, right?\" Cuban said. \"You don't see us blaming it on the players. Or making excuses. If I'm wrong, I'm wrong. I've said, to be very clear, that Tyson has every right to be upset.\n\"But at the same time, it's also no surprise that sometimes you just have to go for it in this league. It works for you sometimes and sometimes it doesn't. Typically, that's my orientation: I'd rather swing and miss than not step up to the plate, so that's just the way it goes.\"\nOn Twitter:\n @townbrad", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/townbrad"], "published": "2015-10-22T03:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T12:00:05.889+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
