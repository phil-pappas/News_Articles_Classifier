Tomorrow, Oct. 16, the Bucs are at Columbia, starting at 4 p.m. and on Oct. 20, Montclair Kimberley comes to town for a 4 p.m. matchup. \nDiMasi was very pleased with his team's effort last week in defeating a pair of league rivals. \n\"We had two brilliant and awesome wins last week,\" said DiMasi. \nThe Bucs downed Cedar Grove, 4-1 and later stopped Bloomfield, 3-2. \n\"Our first singles player and captain, Nicole Posadas, was amazing in both wins,\" said DiMasi. \"She used such resolve and mental toughness in order to win both of those tough matches. She is our leader and deserves much credit for that.\" \nThe coach also noted some other strong efforts. \n\"Our second singles player, Krystal Renta, never gives up on a point and will do anything to win,\" said DiMasi. \"She will rally for long stretches of time, and come up with the winning point and overall victory. And our third singles, Karen Cuasay, who is also a team captain had a great win against Cedar Grove. She went out there and got the job done quickly to secure our first win of that match.\" \nThe doubles teams have also stepped up for Belleville. Emily Mendez and Catherine Rios have shown marked improvement in cross-court shots and volleys, according to DiMasi. \"They are doing a great job in moving like a doubles team,\" the coach said. \nThe second doubles team of Venisse Abanilla and Jenna Paeggao have shown good hands and athleticism at the net, winning key volleys. \"They are supporting and supplementing one another in each point and working great together,\" DiMasi said. \nEmail: Mike051893@aol.com  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T16:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T19:30:13.718+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
