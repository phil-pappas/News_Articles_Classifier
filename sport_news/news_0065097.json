The former employee at Shaker Road School is accused of assaulting a student who was 13 at the time.\nThe charges say the incidents occurred in 2013 and 2014 off school grounds. The 30-year-old Levesque is charged with felonious sexual assault, endangering the welfare of a child and manufacturing child sexual abuse images. He's being held on $60,000 bail.\nIn a letter to parents, Shaker Road headmaster Doug Hicks said Levesque hasn't been at the school since early 2014. He says the charges are \"devastating\" to the school.\nIt could not immediately be learned if Levesque had a lawyer.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T07:50:28.208+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
