So that's where the Travel and Immunization Clinic of Portland enters the fray.\nThat was the message brought to the Here and There Travel Fest by clinic manager Linda Boring last weekend when the show was held at the Oregon Convention Center. The clinic is very specialized in what it does, but is there to help travelers who need that special attention.\nThe clinic staff is trained to determine what pre-trip to post-trip care that travelers need, depending on destination and medical and other personal history. According to Boring, primary care providers often don't even attempt to keep up with vaccinations for hepatitis, cholera or diphtheria, let alone the less common but still serious illnesses that lurk on the road.\nThe clinic also follows weekly changes in recommended medications for world travelers, as made by government and health agencies. \"Most primary care clinics just can't keep up with that kind of detail,'' said Boring, who takes her name from the family that gave its name to a town in Clackamas County.\nWhen travel requires special medical planning, Boring advises beginning the process four to six weeks before departure. But not everyone does that.\n\"We had one patient show up for a 10:10 a.m. appointment and told us he had to be at the airport at 12:45 p.m. the same day. We did the best we could,'' she said.\nThe clinic, founded in 2003, is at 2330 N.W.
