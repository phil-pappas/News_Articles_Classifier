Midway through the season, they‚Äôre 4-2 and two wins from a bowl game. They‚Äôre also 4-6 plays away from being 6-0. There have been flashes of brilliance and unforgivable errors, both of which were clearly on display against Auburn. Six games in, I‚Äôm still trying to figure out how good this team is. \nSince Thursday night, I‚Äôve been going back and forth on a few of the issues facing this team and since I‚Äôm tired of debating myself, I put those thoughts on paper ‚Äî err, screen ‚Äî this afternoon. POINT: Shannon Dawson‚Äôs playcalling with two minutes left was baffling \nDown three with 2:12 left, Kentucky had a chance to tie or win the game. After the offense clicked into gear in the second half, things looked promising, too. Towles easily moved the ball down the field and just as you started to believe the Cats could pull off the upset, Boom Williams ran two yards on an inside draw on second down. The intent was to catch Auburn off guard with the run and set up Austin MacGinnis for the game-tying field goal, but the Tigers stopped Williams short and two frustrating plays later, the game was over. \nI can see what Dawson is trying to do, but why abandon the passing game that worked so well that drive, especially for a run up the middle when you have little time and no timeouts to spare? Dawson took a lot of heat for the call and his slighty smart-assed response of ‚ÄúI f it would‚Äôve worked, it would‚Äôve been great‚Äù didn‚Äôt help. COUNTERPOINT: He‚Äôs clearly not afraid to take a chance \nAfter the first of many deep balls against Louisiana Lafayette, we learned that Dawson clearly isn‚Äôt afraid to take a chance. For the most part, Dawson‚Äôs playcalling has been solid, and it‚Äôs worth pointing out that he‚Äôs learning on the fly after Dana Holgorsen called the majority of plays at West Virginia. If anything, that inside draw call will be a learning experience for years to come. Photo by UK Athletics POINT: The drops ‚Äî namely by Dorian Baker ‚Äî are becoming costly \nLook, I love Dorian Baker. You love Dorian Baker. The football gods really had some fun when they put him together. Big, strong, and freakishly athletic, Baker has accounted for some of the most impressive catches of the season; however, he‚Äôs also accounted for some of the most costly drops. He‚Äôs not alone; while Kentucky‚Äôs receiving corps is as strong as it‚Äôs been in recent years, the receivers had a major case of the butterfingers on Thursday night, with several crucial drops, including one by Baker in the end zone that could have given Kentucky the lead. There were more by Jeff Badet and Boom Williams, but unfortunately, it‚Äôs Dorian that‚Äôs earning a reputation as a repeat offender. COUNTERPOINT: Drops can be corrected \nYou take the good with the bad, and without Baker, Kentucky probably have lost the Eastern Kentucky game. Drops are incredibly frustrating, but can be corrected by, you know, HANGING ON TO THE BALL. At the beginning of fall camp, Garrett Johnson ‚Äî solid, reliable Garrett Johnson ‚Äî started the practice of doing 20 pushups whenever a receiver dropped a pass. If that‚Äôs still going on, at least our wide receivers will have buff triceps. ¬© Kim Klement POINT: The kicking game has become a liability \nSpecial teams get a raw deal. When they do their job well, they never get the credit they deserve, and when things go poorly, they take all the heat. Still battling a groin injury, UK‚Äôs kicker Austin MacGinnis was able to kick filed goals on Thursday, but the kickoff duties went to redshirt freshman Miles Butler. Butler struggled Thursday night, with no touchbacks and Auburn starting most of their drives outside their 30-yard-line. Auburn‚Äôs returners totaled 155 yards on returns to UK‚Äôs 18. Ouch. \nSenior punter Landon Foster isn‚Äôt faring much better. Foster, once so reliable, averaged only 35 yards per punt Thursday, looking like a shell of his former self. There are few better people in this world than Landon Foster, who has made this program proud in so many ways; however, his performance on the field lately is disappointing. COUNTERPOINT: There‚Äôs nowhere to go but up \nThankfully, Mark Stoops told reporters today that MacGinnis will be back for kick-offs against Mississippi State, so that hopefully solves that problem. Meanwhile, Foster is trying his best to concentrate on the second half of the season, taking on a self-imposed Twitter ban: Time to reevaluate, reset, and attack the second half of this season with a new mindset. See ya twitter peeps. \n‚Äî Landon Foster (@BigBlueKick12) October 19, 2015 \nYou got this, Landon. ¬© Mark Zerof POINT: Kentucky squandered away two winnable games \nKentucky made so many errors in the first half of the Auburn game that a comeback was nearly impossible. The fact that they battled back and had a chance to win the game in the final two minutes and messed that up was the cherry on top of a shit sundae. Kentucky was a few plays away from beating Florida as well, a loss that still stings even though the Gators have been one of the surprises of the SEC so far. Take away some of the blunders against Florida and Auburn and Kentucky could be 6-0 right now; however, had the ball bounced the other way a few times, they could also be 0-6. COUNTERPOINT: Those games were winnable \nTwo years ago, Kentucky wasn‚Äôt in a position to win any SEC game. The talent level was that low. Last year, the Cats got their first SEC wins under Stoops, but mentally and physically collapsed during the second half of the season. This year, Kentucky has fielded the better team in every game they‚Äôve played with maybe the exception of Florida. In four instances, talent has been enough to overcome errors, and twice, it wasn‚Äôt. Once you put the disappointment aside, the fact that each game thus far (and, in my opinion, the rest of the season) has been winnable is a testament to the progress Mark Stoops and his staff have made. Photo by UK Athletics POINT: Kentucky hasn‚Äôt played a complete game yet \nHere‚Äôs a rough list of when the Cats have played well this season: First half against Louisiana Lafayette First half against South Carolina Second half against Florida Second half against Eastern Kentucky Second half against Auburn \nMy point is, Kentucky has yet to put together a complete game. In every single outing, at least one unit has underperformed, whether it be the defense, offense, or special teams. Fortunately, four times out of six, Kentucky has done what they needed to do to escape with a win. COUNTERPOINT: Kentucky hasn‚Äôt played a complete game yet \nCan you imagine how good this team could be if they strung together two good halves of football? The thought alone gives me goosebumps. While the upcoming gauntlet of Mississippi State, Tennessee, and Georgia is daunting, it‚Äôs followed by three winnable games against Vanderbilt, Charlotte, and Louisville. Kentucky just needs two of those to get to a bowl, but if they can finally turn in a complete performance, there‚Äôs no one left on the schedule they can‚Äôt beat.

Stickman October 19, 2015 at 8:15   \nThe point to which there is no counterpoint: We have heard all of this ‚ÄúWe weren‚Äôt even in the position to win an SEC game two years ago‚Äù‚ÄúWe were only 2-3 plays away from some big wins‚Äù‚ÄúThere is nowhere to go but up‚Äù bullshit about UK football for the last 500 years or so. \nLet‚Äôs concentrate on what we‚Äôre good at‚ÄìBasketball, and leave the other stuff for other schools.

Hopefully they will continue to get better throughout the year. I give them credit though, they make a lot more difficult catches due to the inaccuracy of the pass than they do drop balls. Moto October 19, 2015 at 8:24   \nTowles Kentucky 200 pass attempts 7 INT Prescott Mississippi St. 225 pass attempts 0 INT Homesick October 19, 2015 at 8:26   \nYour characterization of Dawson‚Äôs remark about the running play as ‚Äúsmart-assed‚Äù reveals how little you know about football. Also continuously remarking on dropped passes does the same. It‚Äôs very, very difficult to catch a football in a crowd especially knowing as soon as you touch someone is trying to take your head off. This is an extremely difficult sport to play so give the young players some breathing room w/o constantly harping on the negatives. The team is improving gMe by game and year by year. Stoops and his staff are doing a great job. DesignatedDrinker October 19, 2015 at 8:36 pm | Permalink \nCalling a 2 yard draw and then a 30 yard bomb when you need a first down shows how little Dawson knows about football, or inexperienced he is, possibly. You can say ‚Äúif it had worked‚Äù after every single play that didn‚Äôt work. And if it was easy to run and catch passes then everyone would want a scholarship to do it. Instead of getting in bar fights and playing BB guns on campus or getting unsportsmanlike penalties for spiking the ball after a first down, maybe Baker should spend more time catching the ball. Criticism is ok and productive, unless you‚Äôre too immature to handle it. Brian October 19, 2015 at 8:47 pm | Permalink \nMan, for a guy who‚Äôs ‚Äúinexperienced, never called a play, and knows so little about the game of football‚Äù, Dawson sure does get lucky when it comes to finding a job. Talk about ‚Äòfalling up‚Äô‚Ä¶.. \nI think you may be full of shit, DesignatedDrinker‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ ME October 19, 2015 at 8:29   \nI recall Badet dropping one pass, but there may have been another. The pass he dropped was luckily dropped otherwise it would have been more costly than the Boom draw, time-wise, as he would have been dropped immediately. KevinM October 19, 2015 at 8:32   \nI like our pattern of having good 2nd halves. Now, if we can come out of the gate fast we can right the ship. Beating MSU would correct everyone‚Äôs attitude towards this team. We have to score more w/less mental mistakes. We‚Äôll need 33 points to beat MSU this week‚Ä¶.a tough task.
