Berhalter even called an important meeting in Chicago in August that did not include Klinsmann.\nPeople on the inside have different views about it. One said Berhalter is a smart guy who gets things done. Another said if you’re going to give Klinsmann the technical director job you should let him do it without interference. Communication between Berhalter and Klinsmann is described as “not good.” One insider used the term “power struggle.”\nMAILBAG: If Klinsmann gets fired, who could replace him? A U.S. Soccer spokesperson said: “Any perception that there’s a power struggle is simply false. Everyone is working collectively to improve the technical side on a daily basis.”\nPlanet Futbol Video In loss to Mexico, U.S. beaten by the very skill it aspires to match by Brian Straus", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/GrantWahl"], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T22:29:21.824+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
