Bullying is a leading factor in suicide for kids aged 11-16. October is National Bully Prevention Month and the staff and students of KC's Family Tae Kwon Do are stepping up to make a difference, along with friends at Acme Pizzeria who have generously sponsored the event. While the martial arts school teaches kids how to be confident and handle bullying all year round, they take this month to really focus on the matter, to educate, and to offer expertise to anyone who would like it. \"Our students have been hanging fliers in the community, posting positive messages on social media, will be signing anti-bully pledges, and are working with purpose toward developing respect and friendship among peers, as well as using their martial arts tools to stick up for themselves and others when needed,\" said KC's Head Instructor, Master Karen Conover. She firmly believes a confident child is less likely to be bullied and those who learn respect do not become bullies. This is a central teaching at KC's. \"Most bullying is verbal and social, and that all comes from a lack of respect for one another. That's where we need to start in our quest to end this epidemic,\" Conover said.If bullying does escalate onto a physical level, the KC's students also know how to handle it appropriately and safely as well. Students are taught effective ways to evade, block, and defend themselves all while getting out of the situation. Fighting is not allowed for students at KC's. \"In school last year a kid tried to fight me and I just tried to make space between us and verbally end it. When he kept at it and pushed me, trying to start a fight, I just reacted and knew exactly what to do to keep his hands off me and get out of it. It feels good to learn this stuff at KC's and be able to handle myself, even if there aren't any adults around, \" said Sebastian Lopez, a 10th grader and Black Belt at KC's. Sebastian is a student of the KC's Instructor College and helps the Black Belt Instructors teach younger students these skills in self defense class. To top off the KC's campaign this month, the school is offering a Free Bully Defense Seminar to Verde Valley kids, ages 7 - 17. The seminar will be held on Saturday, October 24th at 10am at KC's Family Tae Kwon Do in Cottonwood, located at 280 S. Main St. Attendees will learn basic self defense, how to take away a bully's power, how to build self confidence, how to stick up for each other and how to take part in developing a respectful and safe community. The event also includes learning how to break a board and free pizza for families afterwards, thanks to the event sponsor Acme Pizzeria. \"Anyone is welcomed to attend, as long as a parent accompanies them to sign a permission slip. Bring your scout groups and clubs from schools. I think it's important that we share what we know, as often as we can, to help kids feel safe and happy. There's no confidence like self defense confidence,\" added Master Conover. She went on to say that space for the seminar is limited and interested students should call (928) 634-5165 or stop by in advance to register. -Provided by KC's Family Tae Kwon Do", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T21:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T08:02:51.159+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
