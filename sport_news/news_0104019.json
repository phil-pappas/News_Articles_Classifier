Sure, Gasol agreed in a matter of minutes to a five-year deal to return to Memphis. Sure, Gasol got plenty of rest given he didn't play in international competition for his native Spain for the first time in more than a decade.\nBut the one thing that stuck in Gasol's craw and mostly occupied his mind over the summer is the Grizzlies' inexplicable collapse in the Western Conference standings over the five weeks following the all-star break last season.\nEvery other aspect of Gasol's game is complete — from passing to defense to basketball IQ — so his goal now is to offer the Griz stronger leadership.\n\"That haunted me the whole summer,\" Gasol said about the Grizzlies losing their grip on the second seed only to finish fifth in the West. \"Those weeks after the all-star break really haunted me. Things got out of hand and everybody was so emotional. This year, if anything like that happens I've got to take a different approach. I've got to be more of a leader. If anything like that happens, it's got to be on me. I will not look around and point fingers. It starts with me and it ends with me. It's that simple. It's not always just about points and rebounds.\"\nThe Grizzlies were 39-14 at the all-star break and then recorded an uninspiring 12-10 record in the next 22 games.\nTheir second-half regression could be blamed on several factors, including Jeff Green's arrival and choppy integration, and injuries to Zach Randolph and Mike Conley. The offense stalled and Gasol reverted to deferring to teammates.\nGasol, 30, now returns as the franchise's highest-paid performer, readily accepting the responsibility that comes along with it. Albeit a gradual transformation, the Griz have essentially become his team with Randolph's blessing and through the natural evolution of Gasol's individual talent on both ends of the court.\nThe Griz need Gasol's progression to continue if they are to take advantage of a closing window for this group to contend for an NBA title.\n\"The challenge for Marc is to play at the level of aggression that he played in the first 50 games and then try to sustain it,\" Griz coach Dave Joerger said. \"There was a point last season when we got agitated. It wasn't a fun time.\"\nJoerger seemed to acknowledge that the Grizzlies' February/March dive coincided with Gasol's sudden funk. The difference was significant when Gasol scored more. Memphis went 21-6 last season when Gasol scored 20 or more points.\nGasol, though, didn't average more than 16.4 points in any of the final four months of the regular season after he posted 19.3 points per game in November and 20.2 points per game in December.\n\"I will be aggressive,\" said Gasol, who attempted 15 or more shots 27 times last year, and that was 15 more than any previous year. \"I understand the importance I have on both ends of the floor for this team. That will not change. I want to make the Memphis Grizzlies the best franchise possible, and I'll do whatever it takes for that to happen. Right now, it's leading this team in more ways than what happens on the floor.\"\nJoerger believes Gasol being idle during the summer for the first time in 12 years could help him tap into another level of endurance. Joerger and Gasol met in June before the NBA's free-agent period. They discussed the funky five weeks of last season and worked through the ways to better manage this campaign.\nJoerger intends to run offense with a decrease in isolation and pick-and-roll sets in first quarters to give Gasol an opportunity to be fresher at the end of games.\n\"He likes a more equal-opportunity offense,\" Joerger said. \"He's all on board.\"\nGasol characterized his talk with Joerger as constructive as they watched a tennis tournament in Germany.\n\"We talked about things we felt that went wrong,\" Gasol said. \"When little things happen and bother you throughout the season, the sooner you talk about it the better. And then you can talk about basketball and Xs and Os.\"\nFor teammates, Gasol's play will be the least of their worries.\nGasol returns this season with the same mindset and physical condition that enabled him to elevate his game. Gasol went from 10.9 field-goal attempts per game in 2012-13 to 12.1 in 2013-14 to 13.2 last year. His usage rate has risen every year since 2010-11, peaking at 24.6 last season.\nEven though Gasol faded for two months, he still finished with the most productive season of his career, averaging 17.4 points, 7.8 rebounds and 3.8 assists per game.\n\"I hope he continues to be that aggressive and assertive player,\" Conley said. \"And it's not necessarily taking shots but making plays with the ball in his hands. The beauty of Marc's game is that he makes the right play 99 percent of the time.\"\nStill, can Gasol producing an encore to what he accomplished last season in becoming an All-Star starter, first-team All-NBA member and the driving force of the Griz be counted on like death and taxes?\n\"It's not like he had a goal and failed at it,\" veteran swingman Vince Carter said. \"So now, it's in him. It's not 'I'm trying to find my way.' He knows how to put the ball in the basket and now he can work on the next phase. You look around and you look at the opportunity. Last year, everybody felt like we could go far. This year, we can go very far, and Marc's a very important part. He understands that.\"\nGasol didn't comprehend the notion that he would bolt Memphis in free agency.\nThat's one of the few things he had fun with this summer.\n\"There was no negotiation. There was nothing to negotiate. It was either I was on board or I wasn't,\" Gasol said, chuckling while he reiterated that he didn't entertain offers from other teams. \"All I needed to hear was (controlling owner Robert Pera's) commitment to the team and what we can accomplish for the city. The rest is on me. The rest is my pride and my desire to do what we want to do here. He can only do so much after he says, 'I believe in you, go ahead and do it.' I've got to take care of the rest.\"\nTip-in: The Griz waived forward Sampson Carter, guard/forward Yakhouba Diawara, guard Lazeric Jones and forward/center Alex Stepheson on Saturday. The team's roster stands at 16 players with journeyman Ryan Hollins remaining on a non-guaranteed contract. NBA roster cannot exceed 15 players and must be finalized by Monday afternoon.\n2015-16 regular-season opener\nGrizzlies vs Cleveland Cavaliers\nWhen: Wednesday, 7 p.m.\nWhere: FedExForum\nTV, Radio: FOX Sports Southeast, WMFS (92.9-FM/680-AM)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T01:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T09:40:47.973+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
