(Source: WSYR/CNN) \nVERONA, NY (WSYR/CNN) - A high school football player says he was just giving praise to God after scoring a touchdown, but the ref called him out for unsportsmanlike conduct. \nQuarterback Dante Turo running 73 yards for a touchdown. As he crosses the goal line, he points his fingers to the sky. Seconds later the referee tosses a flag. \n“Then when I realized he was calling a penalty, honestly it surprised me, it really did,” Turo said. \nThe call: Unsportsmanlike conduct and taunting. The punishment: Mexico is penalized 15 yards. “I've done that every single time I've scored a touchdown,” Turo said. \nTuro is a devout Christian and his father raised him to praise God every time he makes a big play on the football field. He says that's exactly what he was doing. “I've always been taught since I was little. I've been playing football since I was around 5 years old that the glory shouldn't be on you, it should be on the team and then on God, God first,” he said. \nDante says he was praising God. His teammates, coach, and superintendent are supporting him. “From my vantage point, having the opportunity to see the film after the game several times, it didn't appear that there was any excessive celebration or taunting. However, I'm not a trained ref and I didn't have the pressure of the game in making the call,” said Sean Bruno, superintendent of Mexico Central School District. \nMexico wound up losing 33 to 31. But Turo is holding his head up high, and he says the next time he scores a touchdown, he won't hesitate to praise God again. \n“God has given me all the talents that I have so he deserves all the praise from it,” Turo said. \nCopyright 2015 WSYR via CNN.
