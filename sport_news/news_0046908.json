A Bench headed by Justice TS Thakur dismissed the petitions by KG Dhananjay Chauhan and others, observing that nothing survived in the PILs as nothing was found amiss in the CBI probe and trial. The Bench, which included Justice V Gopala Gowda, passed the order, accepting the Centre’s contention that there was no point in keeping the PILs pending. Appearing for the government, advocate R Balasubramanian said the court of metropolitan magistrate had discharged the only accused in the coffin scam case. The trial court said there was no evidence to proceed against Victor Baiza, the middleman, in the purchase of reusable aluminium coffins from a US company. The CBI had further noted that there was no substance in the allegations of a scam in the purchase of snow suits for the soldiers. In fact, there was no such deal and no payment had been made for the purpose, the agency had found. In another case pertaining to procurement of weapons from a South African company, Krasanopol Ammunition, the trial court had accepted the closure report filed by CBI for want of evidence, the apex court was told. Amicus Curiae Rakesh Dwivedi who had assisted the SC in the case had informed the court that the CAG had noted that nearly 75 per cent of the Rs 2,163 crore worth of supplies were received well after the cessation of hostilities and therefore no way supported the operations. The departments concerned had refused to accord sanction to prosecute officials holding that preliminary inquiries had shown there was no substance in 28 of the 35 cases mentioned in the CAG report.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T20:03:11.274+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
