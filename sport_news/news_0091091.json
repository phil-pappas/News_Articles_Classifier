He is skating on thin ice, after incurring the suspended ban for making a sexual comment about Wawrinka's girlfriend during their match at the Rogers Cup in Canada in August.\nFollowing Monday's match he maintained conditions were \"crazy\" at the Shanghai complex's Grandstand Court, where a cameraman was ejected for repeatedly talking during points. \"They were talking in the middle of the points.\nI was just expecting a lot more obviously from a Masters event. You're not going to see Roger (Federer) or Rafa (Rafael Nadal) playing on a court like that. They're always playing on centre court, where things go smoothly,\" Kyrgios said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T16:14:38.050+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
