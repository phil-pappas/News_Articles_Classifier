The Lincoln and Sunset seventh grade volleyball teams lived up to that fact Wednesday afternoon when the Lady Lions swept the Lady Rockets 25-5, 25-21 in Taft. Lincoln had the momentum from the opening serve of the first set when they raced out to a 4-1 lead highlighted by Brooke Ashmore’s ace. Sunset cut the lead in half but Taft took off again this time going on a 17-1 run thanks in part to Evelyn Camacho’s three straight aces (four total) and ten unanswered points to lead 21-3. Sunset ended the scoring drought with a point but Lincoln outscored the Lady Rockets 3-1 the rest of the way including Camacho’s ace for the final point to win the first set. The pendulum swung the Lady Rockets way to begin the second set as they reeled off four straight points on their way to a 6-1 run. Lincoln bounced back, outscoring Sunset 5-1 highlighted by Ashmore’s back-to-back aces to get within one at 7-6. The Lady Lions would narrow the lead again to one at 8-7 but the Lady Rockets maintained the small advantage until Lincoln tied the score at 10. Sunset regained the lead at 12-10 but Lincoln quickly erased the deficit with five unanswered points including Camacho’s ace to overtake the lead at 15-12. The Lady Rockets countered by cutting the lead down to one, but Lincoln answered with a 4-1 run led by Ashmore’s ace to up the advantage to 20-16. Sunset narrowed the lead down to three before Lincoln outscored them 3-1. The Lady Rockets made one last push by outscoring the Lady Lions 3-2 to trail by three but Lincoln got the final point to win the set and match.
