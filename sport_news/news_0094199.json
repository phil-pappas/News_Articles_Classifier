Our kids did a really nice job getting out in front. That was a nice play right there.\"\nFarmer's play stood out in a game filled with methodical, short-yardage offense. The Eagles (6-2, 4-1 Region 1-4A) scored three touchdowns on offense, two coming on drives of 12 plays or more.\n\"The game plan was to keep their big-play offense down,\" Grainger coach Chad Tate said. \"We wanted to make them snap the ball and force some turnovers. We got some in the first half, but that interception was a big play for them. It was a huge momentum swing.\"\nA turnover set up Grainger (4-4, 2-3) in Eagles' territory early in the first quarter. Grainger got inside the 10-yard-line three times in the opening half, but didn't score. It was the third shutout for Seymour this season.\n\"The key to the game was how well our defense held up after we turned over the ball on offense,\" Cooper said. \"We had two first-half turnovers, plus we fumbled a punt. The defense kept us in the game and then Devante made the great big play that flipped the game around. If they score right there, it's 7-7 and a different ballgame at halftime.\"\nSeymour opened the third quarter with a 13-play, 62-yard drive that Clayton Ogle finished with a 1-yard run. After Grainger turned the ball over on downs, the Eagles pushed the ball downfield with Jeremy Bryant and Isaiah Johnson doing most of the work on the ground. Jamal Ashley took it the final five yards for the score.\nBryant led Seymour with 18 carries for 88 yards and a touchdown.\nAdam Greene is a freelance contributor.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T07:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T07:20:52.371+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
