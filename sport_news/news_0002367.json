Notre Dame ended up earning the division's top seed for the Section 4 Class D quarterfinals in the tiebreaker points system by half a point over Groton and one point over Moravia. That No. 3 seed brings with it a home game at 7 p.m. Friday at Brewer Memorial Stadium against sixth-seeded Moravia. \n\"It's a credit to the work ethic of these kids because when we started off the first seven to 10 days of practice, they weren't grasping what we were trying to accomplish,\" D'Aloisio said. \"Since that day, I think they devoted themselves to learning the system, learning the terminology and they've just improved leaps and bounds from that second week of summer practice on.\" \nThis will be the fourth meeting in the last two seasons between Notre Dame and Moravia. Last year Moravia was a 41-14 regular-season winner over the Crusaders before beating them again in the sectional quarterfinals, 48-6. \nThis year, Notre Dame earned a 30-8 victory at Moravia on Sept. 26, with Blue Devils star running back Jared Lyon slowed in that game by an injury and limited to just 69 yards on 20 carries. The 5-foot-11, 185-pound Lyon is in top form now, having rushed for 347 yards on 20 carries last week in a 56-34 victory over Spencer-Van Etten to give him a school-record 1,436 yards for the season. \n\"When we played them, Jared Lyon got dinged up,\" D'Aloisio said. \"I'm sure they'll have some different stuff for us, different looks, and we'll have different looks for them. It helps (having played them) because we can make corrections on some of the things we did poorly against them, but that works in reverse as well.\" \nWhile Moravia will have a healthy Lyon, the Crusaders will be without key two-way starter Ty Kunzman, who suffered an injury two weeks ago in a 35-14 loss to Groton. \n\"We're banged up. Ty Kunzman won't be available for this game and he made a big difference on both sides of the ball for us,\" D'Aloisio said. \"We felt he was our best all-around player on both sides of the line. That will hurt, but other guys will have to step up, which is what they've been doing all year in a lot of cases.\" \nThis will be just the third home game this season for Notre Dame, which lost a home date when Candor had to forfeit on Oct. 2. The Crusaders are coming off a 22-6 win at Newfield. \nOther games: \nElmira (7-0) at Johnson City (4-3), 7 p.m. Friday : The Express, ranked 16th in New York state in Class AA, will try to complete a second unbeaten regular season over the last three seasons before starting the Section 4 Class AA playoffs Oct. 31 at home against Horseheads. \nElmira has the top-scoring team in Section 4 and has run for 2,750 yards and better than nine yards per carry. Dashaun Sutton has 1,099 yards on 112 carries and has scored 20 touchdowns, while Allaah Sessions has 81 carries for 809 yards with 16 total touchdowns. \nJohnson City has won four of its last five games, with the lone loss a 45-30 setback against four-time defending state champion Maine-Endwell that was close for the first half. \nSyracuse Corcoran (2-5) at Corning (4-3), 7 p.m. Friday : This matchup was determined last weekend after Corcoran missed out on the Section 3 Class AA playoffs. Corning's postseason is already set, with the Hawks playing at Binghamton next week in a Section 4 Class AA semifinal. \nCorning will try to end a two-game slide and will have to do so without explosive senior running back Devon Sullivan, who had surgery after breaking a bone in his foot during last week's 41-34 loss at Binghamton. Hawks head coach George Bacalles said Saturday's surgery went well and it is believed Sullivan will be ready to go in time for lacrosse season. Sullivan has verbally committed to play lacrosse at Syracuse University. \nThe Hawks will be wearing digital camouflage jerseys and selling T-shirts to raise money for the Wounded Warrior Project. Whatever T-shirts are not sold in school this week will be available at the game. \nHorseheads (3-4) at Union-Endicott (1-6), 7 p.m. Friday : After back-to-back losses against Johnson City, Horseheads will try to return to the .500 mark against a Union-Endicott team whose lone victory was 26-20 over Norwich (2-5). \nHorseheads quarterback Ben Clark has completed 92 of 149 passes for 1,396 yards, with 16 touchdowns and 12 interceptions. The Blue Raiders will try to cut down on the turnovers that have been costly in their losses. \nThomas A. Edison (2-5, 0-2 Division V) at Dryden (4-3, 0-2 Division V), 7 p.m. Friday : The winner earns third place in Division V of the Section 4 Football Conference, though both have been eliminated from Class C playoff contention. \nWaverly (6-1, 4-1 Division III) at Owego (5-2, 3-2), 7 p.m. Friday : Waverly can secure the No. 2 seed for the Section 4 Class B playoffs with a victory. That would give the Wolverines, the state's 16th-ranked Class B squad, a home game next week in the semifinals. \nLansing (2-5, 2-0 Division V) at Watkins Glen/Odessa-Montour (6-1, 2-0), 7 p.m. Saturday at Watkins Glen : The winner earns the Division V title and avoids meeting two-time defending Class C state champion Chenango Forks in next week's Section 4 Class C semifinals at Union-Endicott High School. The winner will instead play another tough 6-1 opponent, Newark Valley, in the other semifinal. \nWatkins Glen/O-M comes in averaging over 400 yards rushing per game and different backs have stepped up each week, with Ryan Pruitt leading the team with 927 rushing yards on 93 carries. The Seneca Indians moved up to 21st in Class C in this week's New York State Sportswriters Association rankings. \nLansing returns to action after forfeiting last week to Chenango Forks because of a lack of healthy players. \nWEEK 8 SCHEDULE \nSection 4 Class D quarterfinal: Moravia at Elmira Notre Dame, 7 p.m. \nHorseheads at Union-Endicott, 7 \nElmira at Johnson City, 7 \nSyracuse Corcoran at Corning, 7 \nWaverly at Owego, 7 \nThomas A.
