Instead, Carr recommends changing the language to prohibit begging that is \"intimidating, threatening, coercive or obscene and that causes the person solicited to reasonably fear for his or her safety,\" according to a news release.\nThe council will consider Carr's recommendations at its regularly scheduled meeting at 6 p.m. Tuesday in council chambers at the Municipal Building, 1777 Broadway.\nIn the spring of 2014, the council briefly considered an ordinance that would have prohibited panhandling at places where people might feel trapped or already have their wallets out, such as outdoor dining areas, playgrounds, ATMs, bus stops and gas pumps. A vote on the proposed ordinance was cancelled because of concerns and questions from councilmembers.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T13:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T08:31:02.331+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
