Kelly, USA TODAY Sports)\n2 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Are there any great teams in college football? Maybe not. Will at least one two-loss team make the College Football Playoff? Maybe so.\nBut as USA TODAY Sports college football reporters George Schroeder and Dan Wolken wring out their notebooks from a wet weekend of covering games in the south Atlantic region of the United States, they have a growing feeling what teams will stay in the conversation this season.\nOn this latest episode of The Football Four Podcast, George and Dan talk about the teams they see as the true best in Southeastern and Pac-12 conferences, speculate on what's the deal with Ohio State and reveal the teams they would put in the Playoff field were it to be set today.\nYou can listen or subscribe to the podcast on iTunes or SoundCloud below, as well as on Stitcher .
