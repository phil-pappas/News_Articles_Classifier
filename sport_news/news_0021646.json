The dessert was a share of the Merrimack Valley Conference Large title.\nSophomore quarterback Brett Edwards completed 14-of-22 passes for 227 yards and three first-half touchdowns while Omar Deschamps ran for 100 of his 128 yards in the second half as the Raiders put away Andover, 30-14, last night at Lovely Stadium.\nCentral Catholic (5-1 overall, 3-0 MVC) can clinch the league title outright with a victory over Lowell next week.\n“They had us going early but we weathered the storm,” Raiders coach Chuck Adamopoulos said. “We had a good second quarter and capitalized on some stuff to have the lead and then we played a good third quarter. I thought we played pretty good defense in the second half, much better than in the first half.”\nThe battle between Edwards and prolific signal-caller E.J. Perry of Andover (4-2) dominated the early proceedings. After a quick three-and-out to start the game by Central’s defense, Edwards struck immediately by finding wideout Steven Jackson over the middle for a 61-yard touchdown pass.\nNot to be outdone, Perry responded two plays later by tossing a jump ball to wideout Andrew Soucy on the left sideline, and Soucy was able to take it the rest of the way for a 49-yard score.\nThe Golden Warriors took the lead in the second on a 1-yard TD run by Perry Wynn and Central had two touchdowns called back on penalties, but the Raiders remained undeterred and finally tied the game on a 37-yard TD pass from Edwards to Mathias Villafane.\nAndover fumbled away the ensuing kickoff, which was recovered by Johandy Gonzalez at the Warriors’ 5. After a Central penalty, Edwards found Jackson from 10 yards out for his third touchdown pass of the half.\n“My receivers definitely play a big part, the line is doing great and the running backs,” Edwards said.\nCentral added to its lead in the third as Stefano Calvagno booted a 20-yard field goal to make it 23-14. Both teams traded interceptions in the fourth but Central was able to add a 40-yard TD run by Robert Fitzgerald, while the Raiders defense held Andover scoreless over the final 29:32 of the game.\n“To be honest with you, we just got on the guys about covering better,” Adamopoulos said of his defense. “And I thought we got more pressure in the second half.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T10:50:25.530+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
