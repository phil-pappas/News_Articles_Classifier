(AP Photo/Hektor Pustina) \nELBASAN, Albania — Serbian Prime Minister Aleksandar Vucic said he will not attend Thursday's qualifier for the European soccer championships in Albania, saying he does not want heated fan rivalry to undermine progress made in relations between the two Balkan countries. \nThursday's match in Elbasan, central Albania, is being policed by more than 2,000 officers, with extensive road closures and security checks. \nVucic had been invited to the game by Albanian Prime minister Edi Rama, who is due to attend. \nA match between the countries — who remain at odds over the status of now-independent Kosovo — was interrupted by violence in Belgrade last year after a drone carrying a nationalist Albanian banner hovered over the pitch. \nOn Wednesday, police arrested the alleged drone pilot on illegal weapons possession charges, along with three other men, while the bus carrying Serbia's squad was hit by stones in Tirana, causing no injuries. \n\"It's easy to raise tension and to take the easy route of animosity instead of a more rational view of the future,\" Vucic said Thursday. \nSerbian fans will also avoid traveling to the match, except for a small group of students who met Prime Minister Rama. \nThousands of fans gathered in a party atmosphere ahead of the Group I game In Elbasan, where buildings were draped with national red and black colors. \nLufti Idliraku, runs a small coffee shop opposite the 12,500-seat Elbasan Arena, and argued with customers over score predictions, danced to a passing street band and pulled a stuffed eagle, the national symbol, off his shelf. \n\"Personally, I think we'll win it 1-0. I'm sorry the fans aren't coming from Serbia,\" he said. \"I hope sport can make us overcome history, and not remind us of it.\" \nWith Serbia eliminated and their opponents still in the fight for qualification, Albania coach Gianni De Biasi said his players were focused on trying to win the game. \n\"These kind of games are the most straightforward. Everyone knows what they have to do,\" the Italian said. \"We know who we're up against and we know how tough they can be ... It's a crucial game.\" \nAlbania is third in Group I with 11 points from six matches. Portugal leads with 15 points, followed by Denmark with 12 but having played an additional game. \n__ \nAP writer Dusan Stojanovic in Belgrade contributed \n__", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T15:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T18:04:38.865+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
