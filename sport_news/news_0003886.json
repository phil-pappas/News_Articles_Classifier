(Brad Wilson | For lehighvalleylive.com) By Brad Wilson | For lehighvalleylive.com on September 29, 2015 6:42 PM \nPhillipsburg’s girls cross country team ran into the wild at this weekend’s Six Flags Wild Safari Invitational at the Great Adventure theme park in Jackson Township. \nWell, sort of. \n“We saw a lot of empty cages,” senior Nicole Boyer . \n“And we had to run over some really, really green water,” remembered sophomore Leah Kelly with a disgusted look on her face. \nBut the one wild beast the Stateliners did see was most appropriate. \n“Alpacas,” Boyer said. \nAn alpaca could be the perfect mascot for a team that runs in a pack better than most in the area. \n“We have five girls that could be our No. 1 runner on any given day,” coach Joe Grady said. \nIt’s the depth of the Stateliner top seven – seniors Boyer, Amina Sparks, Sarah Rumps, and Lexee Willey, plus sophomores Bella Beviss , Kelly and Alison Nicinski – that has allowed Phillipsburg to enjoy a strong start to their season. The Stateliners won the senior division title at the Bernie Magee class meet at Greystone Park two weeks ago and took second in the Varsity B race at Six Flags. \n\"I think we're a stronger team now than we were at the (Magee) race,\" Kelly said. \nIt’s the depth that allows Phillipsburg (3-1) to aspire for a Skyland Conference Raritan Division championship; the Stateliners face a big step towards a division crown when they face Bridgewater-Raritan and Watchung Hills at Natirar Park Wednesday, \nAnd it’s their depth that allows Phillipsburg, currently ranked No. 7 in the region by lehighvalleylive.com, to set lofty goals for the season. \nNumber one goal? \n“We have to beat Easton ,” said Willey of the currently No. 1-ranked Rovers, who will visit Phillipsburg’s course Oct. 10 for the annual clash. \nBeyond that, Sparks said the team wants to finish in the top 5 of the Skyland Conference and Hunterdon/Warren/Sussex meets – with the latter stressed as Phillipsburg is hosting that one on Oct. 15 – and make it to the NJSIAA Group 4 state meet. P’burg did that last season as the fifth and final qualifier from its North 2 Group 4 sectional, but as Sparks said, “we want to be better than fifth.” \nIn a section that includes Ridge, North Hunterdon (ranked No. 2 in the region by lehighvalleylive.com), Westfield and Millburn, that will be no small task, but, then, the Stateliners know all about working hard to achieve what they want. \n“These girls had the best summer of workouts I can remember in a long time,” Grady said. “We had daily workouts and our attendance was great, 75 percent of our 34 girls or better every day. These girls do the work every day – that’s what makes them special.” \nSpecial enough that they attract first-year seniors such as Rumps to come out for the sport – not a common occurrence. \n“I’d be running by myself, but that’s no fun,” she said. “I’d never really been into sports that much. But I love being on this team.” \nPhillipsburg’s team philosophy offers plenty of rewards in what can be regarded as an individual sport. \nFirst, the Stateliners’ ability to run together – they posted a 28-second spread between their No. 1 and No. 5 runners at Six Flags, a truly remarkable number (generally around a minute is regarded as good) – makes them feel like one unit. \n“We pretty much all have each other’s backs and we love to finish each race as a team,” Willey said. \nSecond, it allows any girl having a good day to lead. P’burg’s not dependent on one leader. \n“That takes the pressure of us,” said Boyer, who was the No. 1 Stateliner at Six Flags. “This year anybody can win races.” \nThird, since the group is so tight, the team can work as one. \n“Whoever is in back encourages everybody else to keep up,” Sparks said. “We work hard to all stay together. Our goal is to be within 45 seconds or a minute of each other in every race.” \n“We want to encourage every girl in the race and help our teammates,” Boyer said. “That’s what a team should be like, not just runners by themselves.” \nFourth, Grady’s no-cuts philosophy creates a leveling feeling. \n“It’s not like some other sports where you have to think ‘Oh, I have to better than that girl or I won’t make the team,’ Sparks said. “Out here we’re all suffering together.” \nThe team laughed at that comment, but they know it’s the intense workouts on the demanding course at the Phillipsburg Athletic Complex that allow them to enjoy success. \n“This is one tough sport,” said Rumps, the first-year senior. \nThe team feeling carries over when the team’s not running. \n“Coach Grady says we’re his 34 daughters,” Nicinski said. \nThe Stateliners have done some common team-bonding activities, such as ice cream socials and pasta parties, and some less usual ones as well. \n“We made T-shirts together,” said Willey; one such effort read “Will Run For Food” on a psychedelic background. \nForget the food – these Phillipsburg girls are running for gold – 'al-pack-a' style.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T02:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T01:34:03.638+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
