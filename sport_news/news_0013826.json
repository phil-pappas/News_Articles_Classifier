During a playoff run that's been all about Clayton Kershaw and Zack Greinke and Jake Arrieta and Daniel Murphy, their starters have gone overlooked. \nAnd they shouldn't be. As much as even Murphy, the Mets wouldn't hold a 2-0 lead over the Cubs in the National League Championship Series without them. \n\"Their stuff's there,\" Michael Cuddyer said. \"It's been there the whole year. Now it's on the big stage. We're the only game playing at the moment.\" \nNo pitching staff has a lower ERA (2.74) this postseason than the Mets. Only the Blue Jays' starters have thrown more innings and that's by getting one more out than the Mets' 42 2/3 innings over these seven games. And not a single team comes close to the 58 strikeouts the Mets have amassed this postseason from their staff. RELATED: Mets' Daniel Murphy is the reason these Cubs still look cursed | Politi \n\"We've beaten some of the best that the game has to offer,\" David Wright said Sunday night. \"I'll argue that we have the (Noah) Syndergaards, the (Matt) Harveys, the (Steven) Matzes and the deGroms, so I like our chances when we can run those guys out there. But just an amazing run for us offensively to be able to get to some of these guys early and then allow these starters to go out there.\" \nSyndergaard was just the latest to put up a dominant outing. He allowed just three hits in 5 2/3 innings and struck out nine. This after coming out of the bullpen in Game 5 of the NLDS to obliterate the Dodgers for an inning. \nThe Mets have gotten this far not just because of Murphy's hot bat or because of Jeurys Familia's stability in the ninth. It's because they've faced the best pitchers in the National League and had their starters pitch them even over nearly every outing. \nAnd the Mets' starting staff isn't getting enough credit for it. \n\"We've pretty much haven't hid the fact that we think we have pretty good pitching,\" Mets manager Terry Collins said. \"They're young, they're inexperienced. They don't have the credentials that Kershaw and Greinke and Lester and Arrieta have, but they're going to be good pitchers. They're going to be really, really good, and we're really proud of as fast as they've come and the way they've handled themselves this summer. \nBut they're going to we think we can stack up with anybody. And with Jake going, we've just got to go in there. They play great in Chicago. It's a park built for them, so it should be a great series continued.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T14:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T15:02:55.280+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
