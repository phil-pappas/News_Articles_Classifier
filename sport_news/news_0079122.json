Yet running strip drills has a purpose, no matter how monotonous. Vail Christian football’s defense produced four turnovers, including three fumble recoveries, shutting down Gilpin County’s high-powered offense in a 48-16 win on Saturday in Black Hawk. “We spent a lot of time on defensive assignments and were more aggressive in stunting and moving (in practice),” Saints coach Tim Pierson said. And that did the trick. Ethan Kuhns came up with two fumbles, David Caballero one and Bryan Trujillo snagged an interception as Vail Christian moved to 5-0 overall and 4-0 in the Central League. With extra possessions, the Saints dialed up the ground game and built up a 36-0 halftime lead. Quarterback Logan Raitt scored the first two touchdowns with runs of 21 and 2 yards. Kuhns broke to the house twice in the second quarter with a 52-yarder and a 34-yarder. In between, it was Caleb Chicoine with an 11-yard romp. In the second half, Kuhns made it three TDs on the day and Alex Davis wasn’t going to be left out with a 45-yarder to the house. After two road games, the Saints return for their homecoming game against Justice at Battle Mountain on Saturday at 2 p.m. Sports Editor Chris Freud can be reached at 970-748-2934, cfreud@vaildaily.com and @cfreud.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T01:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T02:31:34.424+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
