Today local safety officials showed us how they works. With a press of a button, school leaders can contact dispatch and dispatch can silently listen in on what's going on inside the school and notify Toledo Police. Toledo Public School Superintendent Dr Romules Durant tells 13 ABC,\n\"Our offices can respond just like you would see if we were in a bank, tellers can tap a button and get response times immediately without having to communicate other than the button.\" Toledo Police Chief George Kral says, \"If an intruder were to get in at another entrance, classrooms have an emergency button to push to alert the office as well. Each class has a I don't want to call it a panic button, but of sorts to let the office know there's something going on and they need police.\"\nToday Toledo's Mayor and Toledo safety leaders teamed up to sign a memorandum of understanding, to acknowledge the partnership between the city, the county, and Toledo Public schools. Toledo Police Chief George Kral says, \"As a public safety officer it is our job to keep everyone safe and when we are talking about our young people, theres a special place in our hearts for our kids so this radio is a God send.\"The emergency radios cost around 2-thousand dollars a piece including installation. A federal grant is funding the project.", "external_links": ["http://up.anv.bz/latest/scripts/anvload.js", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?sz=640x480&iu=/301721715/WTVG&ciu_szs&impl=s&gdfp_req=1&ad_rule=1&vpos=preroll&env=vp&output=xml_vast2&unviewed_position_start=1&correlator=", "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/C72/CC9/C72CC95283414D729FD3326085E3D1B7.mp4", "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/353*264/tps+radios.jpg", "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/tps+radios.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T02:12:00.776+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
