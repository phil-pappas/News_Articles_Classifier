The vegetation within the hilly 20-acre property on Hawver Road was green and lush, the oak trees were thick with leaves and the view of the valley below, from a deck built onto a two-story house, was as vivid as ever. But it will never be the same. The house was one of the hundreds that fell victim to the Butte Fire when it rolled through Calaveras County earlier this month. And Meyer, a geographic information system analyst with Cal Fire in Sacramento who inspects damage in the aftermath of a fire, was on hand to assess the destruction. “It was awful. I didn’t recognize it as a place that I had grew up in. It looked completely post-apocalyptic,” Meyer said. “The dust was burning, there were downed logs burning, there were still trees that were burning, most of the vegetation was black and gone. It just felt desolate.” Meyer, a Calaveras High School graduate who lives in Davis, arrived at the fire on Sept. 10 prior to it passing over the home — a structure handbuilt in the 1970s on property owned by the family. The home, occupied by her parents until the fire forced relocation primarily to property in Davis and Mokelumne Hill part time, was designed using various concepts found in books. “I was excited to be able to have firsthand knowledge by being at the base camp,” Meyer said. “I’d get information coming in from the field.” The fire eventually rolled through the area later on that Thursday, but Meyer was unsure at the time whether the house had suffered any damage. Due to dangers in the proximity of the area, it wasn’t until Saturday that Meyer saw something she says she could never prepare for. “There were these extreme emotions. At one moment, I just had this hope and this vision that somehow it went around the house, or it didn’t burn the house down,” Meyer said. “There was a crew out there protecting it and keeping the embers from burning it up and in the next moment, I envision it gone. I have to say, even envisioning it, it never went as extreme as what actually happened.” The whole situation has been beyond belief, she says. After learning the house had burned down, Meyer went back to the property on numerous occasions to confirm what she already knew — that the home she grew up and created childhood memories in was gone forever. “It’s kind of hard to conceptualize but when I really think about it, it’s like someone just kicked me in the stomach. It literally makes me nauseous,” Meyer said. “I’ve been out there four times now, the last couple of times to make sure it really is gone. I just have to keep checking because I can’t believe it.” Though she was working through the incident, Meyer — who has since been demobilized — says being at the incident base camp was a good place for her to be during her situation. Many of her colleagues helped her cope. “I was just amazed at the empathy of my colleagues. I think a lot of it came from the fact that they take personal responsibility of the safety of homes,” Meyer said. “That’s what they do, they protect homes. People just felt really deeply, almost responsibility for the loss.” Follow UnionDemocrat.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T04:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T07:11:58.636+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
