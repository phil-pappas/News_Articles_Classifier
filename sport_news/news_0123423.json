And the Stockton Heat took full advantage of it. The city’s new American Hockey League franchise put on a dazzling display in its debut on Saturday night, as it scored four times in the first period and trounced the Rockford IceHogs 7-0 in front of a jubilant crowd of 6,543 at Stockton Arena. By the end of the first, the game was less of a competitive contest and more like a homecoming parade, with Heat coach Ryan Huska and his team leading the way. “It was nice to see us get off to a good start,” Huska said. “And we continued at that point and didn’t take our foot off the gas. It was nice to play like that in our first game in this building.” The Heat arrived in town promising a better brand of hockey than that provided by the Stockton Thunder of the ECHL, who played at the arena for 10 years. The Heat’s owners, the Calgary Flames, provided a blend of players with NHL experience and young prospects, and promised a competitive team. It’s just one game, but the loyal and curious supporters who filed into the arena on Saturday seemed satisfied with the early results. Derek Grant had two goals for Stockton, and Markus Granlund and Jakub Nakladal had three points each. Nakladal, a 6-foot-2 defenseman, had a tremendous overall game, playing good defense, helping out offensively and leading the power play unit which converted three of six opportunities. All the offense made for an uneventful and successful debut for rookie goaltender Jon Gillies, who had 19 saves and enjoyed his first experience in front of the Stockton crowd. “I’ve never been one to get too nervous, it’s more excitement, more anxiousness,” Gillies said. “It’s kind of surreal to play the game. I thought the fans were spectacular. We had high expectation for fans, and they exceeded them. They were very passionate, they were loud, and they were enthusiastic throughout. It was a lot of fun to play in front of them.” The game began with each of the Heat’s active players being introduced and after the first period, it brought out its new mascot — Frankie the Firebird, who basked in the glow of his new-found stardom. By that time, the Heat was comfortably ahead. The IceHogs (1-1-0) were trying to spoil the debut of a Pacific Division team for the second night in a row, after beating the San Jose Barracuda 4-2 on Friday at the SAP Center. But they were completely overwhelmed in the first period by the Heat, and their starting goalie, Michael Leighton, didn’t last the first 20 minutes. Grant tapped the puck past Leighton just 4 minutes, 22 seconds into the game for the first goal in franchise history on assists by Turner Elson and Emile Poirier. That set off a loud celebration from the crowd, who had no idea how many times they were going to hear the goal horn. Rockford forward Ryan Hartman took the first of his four penalties (roughing) a short time later and Stockton cashed in, as Bill Arnold deflected a point-blank shot by Nakladal into the net. Granlund and Oliver Kylington pushed the score to 4-0, and Leighton’s night was over. IceHogs coach Ted Dent called on Mac Carruth. Just 39 second into the second period, Drew Shore scored his first goal of the season on Carruth. Stockton continued to pour it on with two more goals in the third period. Among the healthy scratches for the Heat were forwards Garet Hunt, Garnet Hathaway, Austin Carroll, Colton Orr, Ryan Lomberg, and defensemen Kenney Morrison and Keegan Kanzig. — Contact reporter Scott Linesburgh at (209) 546-8281 or slinesburgh@recordnet.com.
