By Charles F. Gardner of the Journal Sentinel Oct. 9, 2015 8:48 p.m. (0) Comments \nSt. Francis — Greg Monroe will renew acquaintances with his former Detroit Pistons teammates on Saturday night. \nThe Milwaukee Bucks center said he doesn't consider it a big deal. He's more focused right now on fitting in with the Bucks and doing his preseason work. \nThe Bucks and Pistons meet Saturday in the annual MACC Fund Game, marking the home debut for the 6-foot-11 Monroe. \n\"No game is more important than another to me,\" Monroe said. \nFormer Bucks forward Ersan Ilyasova, traded to Detroit during the off-season, will return to the place he played his first seven NBA seasons. \nMonroe signed a three-year, $50 million contract with the Bucks during the summer after playing last season in Detroit for a qualifying-offer salary. It was a decision that allowed him to be an unrestricted free agent and choose his next league destination. \nHe surprised plenty of observers by choosing the Bucks, bypassing the New York Knicks, Los Angeles Lakers and Portland Trail Blazers. \n\"The things they're asking me to do, I'm very capable of,\" Monroe said of his training camp experience. \"It's things I've been doing over my career. \n\"I think I fit in with the guys. I know I made the right decision. I'm not questioning that. Now is just time to get better with the team so we can do something together.\" \nMonroe played just 17 minutes in the preseason opener Tuesday and had six points and four rebounds in the Bucks' 105-95 loss to the Chicago Bulls. \n\"That's why we recruited him and wanted him here,\" coach Jason Kidd said. \"We felt he was going to fit and he does fit. \n\"But there's also a feeling-out process. He's had quite a few coaches (in Detroit) in his early career. For him, it's getting the system on both ends and he's doing that very well. \n\"He played at Georgetown and he's a smart young man, not just on the court but off the court, too.\" \nMonroe said he liked how the starters shared the ball Tuesday while building a three-point halftime lead against the Bulls. \n\"We did a pretty good job; we have a long way to go,\" Monroe said. \"Offensively, the ball was moving and I think we were getting some pretty good shots. We were playing some OK defense. We have to get better at it and communicate a little bit better.\" \nMonroe said he is trying to get into position to get some early post-ups and kick out the ball to his teammates. \nDo the Bucks have enough good shooters? \n\"Yes,\" Monroe said. \"You can never have too many shooters. I think we have a bunch of different people that can make shots at any moment. We just have to continue to find them.\" \nMonroe spent five seasons with the Pistons and played with Bucks forward Khris Middleton during the 2012-'13 season, when Middleton was a rookie. \nThe two remained friends after Middleton came to the Bucks in the summer of 2013, and Monroe has noticed the changes in Middleton's game. Middleton also signed a big contract during the summer, a five-year, $70 million deal. \n\"He's matured more as a player; he's always been a great shooter,\" Monroe said. \"I think he's finding ways to get to the spots he needs to get to. \n\"I think it's more about his dribble moves and things like that, he's gotten better at.\" \nMiddleton's one-handed dunk over Bulls guard Jimmy Butler made the highlight shows Tuesday, but Monroe thought it carried some significance as well. \n\"I think that's the kind of dunk that sets the tone for us moving forward,\" Monroe said. \"That has to be the norm. Guys shouldn't be surprised. If you're getting to the rim you should dunk it. \n\"It was a great play on his part, but that's something as a team we have to build from that.\" \nSecurity screening: All people attending games at the BMO Harris Bradley Center will be subject to security screening starting with Saturday's game. Walk-through metal detectors will serve as the primary method of fan screening at all NBA games. \nIn addition, all permitted bags will be searched thoroughly. Permitted bags should be soft-sided, not larger than 14-by-6-by-14 and able to fit completely beneath an arena seat. © 2015 , Journal Sentinel Inc. All rights reserved. About Charles F.
