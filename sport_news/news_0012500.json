As the farmers lifted the blockade, the rail traffic resumed in the state. “Though the rail services have been partially restored, it would take at least 48 hours to streamline the schedule of various inter-state trains in the region,” said a senior railway official. Farmers’ leader Sukhdev Singh Kokri Kalan said even though they ended their ‘rail roko’ agitation, the protest would continue as the government hadn’t conceded to any of their main demands yet. He said from tomorrow farmers would prevent BJP and Akali MLAs and MPs from entering their respective constituencies. Besides, farmers would ghearo the residences of all ministers on October 23. The farmer leader said the CM did not make any commitment on the price of basmati except purchasing it on the MSP and also to enhance the compensation to farmers whose crop had been damaged by whitefly. The government has committed to giving Rs 8,000 per acre while farmers are demanding Rs 40,000 per acre. The government also accepted the demand to regulate the interest rate on loan advanced by private money lenders.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T15:02:11.212+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
