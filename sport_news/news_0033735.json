He will arrive for Saturday’s assignment in the Colonial Athletic Association at Elon as the senior conductor of the undefeated Dukes’ lethal, high-tempo offensive system, playing quarterback in the commanding manner he’s accustomed and always has envisioned. On his terms. “This is something I’m comfortable in, something I take pride in and something that I love to do,” he said, “taking control of an offense, having the ability to check plays and just go fast.” Lee headed into uncertainty two years ago, as the 2013 season came to a close. The Durham native felt fortunate to be the starter at Georgia Tech, where he had developed a bond with his teammates, had performed key contributions for two seasons, had participated in an Atlantic Coast Conference championship game and had thrown a touchdown pass in a Sun Bowl defeat of Southern California. But he didn’t want to continue quarterbacking Georgia Tech’s run-driven, triple-option offense. “I tried to work my butt off to be the best triple-option quarterback I could be,” he said. “But it was just something that I knew I wanted more out of the quarterback position and I knew I was capable of doing more. “That’s what it all came down to. I told myself, ‘If this is the last time I play football ever again, I want to be able to do it with what I’m used to doing and happy doing, truly playing the quarterback position.’” Lee’s decision to transfer down a level to James Madison, after considering Towson, Northern Iowa and hometown Duke as other potential destinations, stands as both landing spot and jumping off point for his second act as a college quarterback. After lighting it up last year — in some ways his debut as a passer — and twice throwing for more than 400 yards in a game on the way to shattering school single-season milestones en masse while powering James Madison back into the FCS playoffs, the encore this year has furthered that impact. With Lee directing their fast-breaking show, the Dukes, riding a 6-0 start for the first time in school history, lead the FCS in total offense (614.5 yards per game) and rank second in scoring (48.3 points per game). James Madison took down Southern Methodist 48-45 three weeks ago, the type of signature victory in a step up against a bowl subdivision opponent that the FCS covets. Page 2 of 3 - Lee went off that night in Dallas, throwing for 289 yards and three touchdowns and running for 276 yards and two more scores, becoming the first Division I player ever to pass and rush for more than 275 yards in the same game. He’s not just the fifth-leading passer (1,698 yards) but the ninth-leading rusher (616 yards) in the FCS this season. “Pretty much every play, it’s a lot on me,” he said. “Honestly, that’s why I play the position, because I love the challenges. I’m kind of like a player-coach on the field, and I’m thankful the coaches believe in me to kind of take them to the right place.” This weekend’s game represents the closest thing Lavaedeay Montique Lee will experience to a homecoming in the CAA. Elon is the league’s only member in North Carolina and the league’s only football-playing school south of Williamsburg, Va. At Durham Hillside, he delivered a perfect 16-0 senior season in 2010, a Most Valuable Player performance in the state championship and earned the state’s Player of the Year distinction from the Associated Press. Naturally, Lee received plenty of recruiting attention. It wasn’t of the most settling variety, though. “A lot of those in-state schools kind of made it tough on me,” he said. “You had people doubting and saying you can’t play quarterback and maybe wanting to play you at other positions. That kind of messed me up, because I never seen myself going out of North Carolina.” Although he had a believer in Everett Withers, then the defensive coordinator at North Carolina, Lee wondered if then-Tar Heels coach Butch Davis was sold on him as a quarterback in college. The Russell Wilson-Mike Glennon quarterbacking saga soured him on North Carolina State. As for nearby Duke, he grew quite close to coach David Cutcliffe, but doubted if the Blue Devils could win consistently. “If I went back and did it over, I would consider them way more than what I did,” Lee said. “I love Coach Cutcliffe. Me and him have a great relationship still to this day. He’s an amazing coach and an amazing person. I’m happy for their success at Duke, because they’re making Durham happy and proud.” Lee said he chose to “be loyal to them because they were loyal to me” in settling on Georgia Tech. “Even though I never ran one option play ever in high school,” he said. “So all that was new to me. I just never was comfortable.” Page 3 of 3 - Withers’ hiring as James Madison’s coach in January 2014 piqued the interest of Durham Hillside coach Antonio King. That had Lee diving in and researching the Dukes, whose campus is located in the Shenandoah Valley town of Harrisonburg, Va. Then when he visited James Madison, one of Lee’s first turns off Interstate 81 was onto a road called Hillside Avenue. “That’s my high school, so I was like, ‘This is destined for me,’” he said. He liked that Withers, arriving after an assistant-coaching stop at Ohio State, and his staff also were new to James Madison. “It was funny because when I went on my visit, we were all going places not knowing nothing,” Lee said. “So I felt like I was able to come in with them. It felt good.” And away they went, cranking out offense at prodigious levels. After racking up 3,462 passing yards, 826 rushing yards and accounting for 39 touchdowns last season, Lee finished fourth in the voting for the Walton Payton Award, given to the Offensive Player of the Year in the FCS. This year, he’s perhaps the midseason frontrunner for that highest of honors. On his terms. “This is what I saw myself doing,” he said. “I think right now we’re competing to be the best team in JMU history, to be something special. “We’re focusing on us and that’s how Coach Withers designed it to be. By doing that, we focus on each week and not on the big picture, because even though I believe we have the talent, I don’t think we’ve arrived yet.” Kickoff Who: No. 5 James Madison (6-0, 3-0) at Elon (2-4, 1-2) When: 3 p.m. Saturday Series: James Madison leads 3-0 By Adam Smith", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T09:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T10:19:23.169+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
