Let’s take our daily look at the headlines while we’re waiting on those pucks to hit the ice starting at 7:00 PM ET. \nAntti Raanta, G, New York Rangers: Raanta made his season debut for the Rangers in the lone NHL game last night, posting 22 saves in a shutout 4-0 victory. It was a big win for New York, who halted a three-game losing streak and looked like a playoff-caliber team once again. Marc Staal and Jesper Fast posted a goal and an assist each, helping to drop the Sharks to 4-2-0 on the year. As for Raanta, it was his fourth career shutout. \nUSA TODAY Sports \nLet’s keep things going today with a couple of Penguins items. The team is reeling a bit in the early-going due to an 0-for-17 power play, which they’re reportedly going to make some changes to. Making matters worse is Sidney Crosby’s five-game streak with no points--that matches a career worst for him. The good news in Pittsburgh is that they got both Eric Fehr and Pascal Dupuis back in practice this weekend. Both are still a little ways out from being 100 percent, but it’s a good step. \nThe Flyers should have winger R.J. Umberger back on the ice pretty soon, however it probably won’t be tonight. Umberger is coming back from an upper-body injury and got some practice time in yesterday. \nTyler Bozak didn’t practice yesterday, thanks to his lower-body injury (which also caused him to miss Saturday’s game). Bozak might be okay for tomorrow night against the Sabres, though. \nNHL Daily Schedule: Here’s today’s NHL schedule.
