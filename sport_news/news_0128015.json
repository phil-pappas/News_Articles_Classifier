He had catches of 22, 4 and 3 yards Monday, plus an end-around run of 6 yards.\nTargeted just four times total against the team that took him in the second round of the 2010 draft, Tate spoke tersely about the Lions' offense after the game.\n\"Like I've said, they call the plays, I run the plays to the best of my ability, and that's the only thing I can do,\" Tate said.\nThe Lions have not scored an offensive touchdown in their last 15 possessions, and they managed just 256 yards of offense against the Seahawks. They're the only winless team left in the NFL.\n\"We are just going to go in, let (the coaches) design some plays, and I run them the best I can and I try to give the team the best chance I can at winning,\" Tate said.\nTate, who helped the Seahawks win their first Super Bowl two seasons ago, said he exchanged jerseys with his good friend and Seattle receiver Jermaine Kearse after Monday's game.\n\"It was good to be back,\" Tate said. \"I appreciated the welcome. It would have been nice to come out of here with a win, but unfortunately we didn't.\"\nContact Dave Birkett at dbirkett@freepress.com.
