He has been through a tough go. I think he is a great person. I know he really wanted to get to where he felt good about playing hockey. He worked hard over the summer to get himself into a good position, so I feel extraordinarily bad for him.\"\nFranzen, 35, had an assist in the first of the two games he played this season. He has not been available to reporters, but when asked by the Free Press in September whether he had considered retirement, Franzen replied, \"I feel like I want to end it on my own terms.\"\nFranzen has five years and $12.5 million left on his contract, which has an annual salary cap hit of just under $4 million.\nGeneral manager Ken Holland said that for now, Franzen is going on Injured Reserve, which opens a roster spot. He could be moved to Long-Term IR, which offers salary cap relief.\nThe Wings next play Friday against Carolina. Luke Glendening is questionable after suffering swelling from a blocked shot; if he can't go, Joakim Andersson will play, putting the Wings at 12 forwards. Blashill also said Darren Helm (concussion) had a setback that casts his expected Saturday return into question.\nTo Blashill's point about focusing on players who are available, those are expected to have a better showing from the start than last Saturday at Carolina. The Hurricanes battered Petr Mrazek with pucks, and it took a third-period rally for the Wings to emerge victorious.\nThe Hurricanes are still looking for their first victory, dropping to 0-3 after a 4-1 loss to the Florida Panthers on Tuesday.\n\"They had a night against Florida where I know they weren't happy with their game, so they are going to come in ready to go,\" Blashill said. \"We have to make sure we are ready to go from the drop of the puck, and then we have to do a better job than we did in their building of skating.\n\"When we are skating, we are a really good hockey team.\"\nLosing Franzen always was a possibility, given the precarious nature of head injuries. It wasn't even due to a big hit -- Franzen skated Tuesday morning, left the rink, and then called in to say he wasn't feeling well. Now it is back to a waiting game, for Franzen and the Wings, to see when -- or if -- he will be able to play again.\n(c)2015 Detroit Free Press\nVisit the Detroit Free Press at www.freep.com\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/hockey/s-1738447&h=Red+Wings%27+Franzen+out+indefinitely", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/hockey/s-1738447&hashtags=ArcaMax", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/hockey/s-1738447"], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T08:07:22.895+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
