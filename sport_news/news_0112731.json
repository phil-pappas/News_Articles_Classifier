The officials originally asked for a $15 per game raise, but the MHSAA would only approve a pay boost of $5 per game. \n\"We’d even be happy if they met us halfway,\" GCOA President Joe Davis said. \"We currently have a counter offer on the table that would be an additional $5 this year and $5 the next three years.\" \nThe GCOA is expected to vote again this Wednesday on whether to keep working during the negotiations. Hinton met with most of the coast high schools’ athletic directors Monday as well to let them know of MHSAA’s backup plan. \n“We’re continuing to try to work out the situation,” Hinton said. “We plan to continue our games and have our games start on time.” \n“We trust Don’s leadership that we’ll get this figured out,” Gulfport Athletic Director Bryan Caldwell said. “We’ll have to wait and see.” \nThe strike would only affect varsity, junior varsity and middle school basketball games. \nCopyright 2015 WLOX .
