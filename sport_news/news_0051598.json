Their on-field flare, both as blitzers and in coverage, has been the strength of the Pats defense through three games this season.\nThe key is they strive to have fun.\n“This is a hard sport, man,” Collins said. “You can’t just get anybody to come in here and play. It’s tough. You’ve got to make it fun. You’ve got to smile. It’s the little things. I’m big on that. When I come here talking about having fun, I’m talking noise to High(tower), and he knows this. You can’t just come in here with football on your mind all day every day. Pick his brain about anything, whatever it could be, just to make him laugh to get his mind out of the playbook. Loosen him up.”\nThe two are so close they wanted to conduct a joint interview at their adjacent locker stalls with trash talking, compliments and everything else in between on the table. They’ve visited each other’s homes — Hightower’s in Tennessee and Collins’ in Mississippi — to have some country fun: fishing, four-wheeling, anything outdoors.\nIt’s strengthened a bond that became tight quickly after the Pats drafted Collins in 2013.\n“We’re southern boys. All of that fast-paced stuff up here, man, y’all don’t take time to appreciate stuff,” Hightower cracked.\nCollins added, “Whatever you think of that’s country, there’s a possibility we’re doing it.”\nWhat about hunting?\n“I stopped hunting,” Collins replied.\nHightower quickly interrupted, “Because you can’t shoot anything.”\nThey’re both big into fishing, and that got personal. A proud Hightower couldn’t admit Collins was the better fisherman.\n“I don’t like to brag, so we’ll ask Dont’a that,” Collins said.\nHightower responded, “I’m not putting that on record. I’ll say no comment.”\nThe exchange was a peek behind the curtain of what makes them tick. There’s a deep connection between the two that translated to their ascension.\nHightower, a 2012 first-round draft pick, helped Collins make the transition as a rookie from a winless Southern Mississippi program to the decorated and demanding Patriots. Hightower is the master of the playbook and Bill Belichick’s defensive scheme, knowing the ins and outs of every player’s responsibility on any given play.\nHightower ensured Collins’ athleticism and playmaking tenacity lined up with his understanding of the defense, and Collins has since become the backup play-caller.\n“(Hightower is) not just a football nerd,” Collins said. “He’s a beast. Whatever I don’t find (in film study), he’s got the answers. Whenever you need an answer from someone, ask Hightower.”\nConversely, Collins is the reason why Hightower improved so dramatically in man coverage. Quarterbacks are 3-of-6 for 28 yards while targeting Hightower this season.\n“For real, it’s man-to-man coverage,” Hightower said when asked how Collins has provided the most help. “When people ask me the big difference between man-to-man coverage one year to the next, yeah, I worked on stuff, but I’ve watched film on a lot of guys. (Collins is) the best cover linebacker in the league, maybe the best linebacker in the league, I’ve been watching him, and he really helped me out with the man-to-man coverage.”\nCollins was the Patriots’ most dominant defensive player in September with 3.5 sacks, two forced fumbles, two quarterback pressures, one quarterback hit and one run stuff, and he drew one holding penalty. Quarterbacks were 2-of-8 for 11 yards when targeting him.\nSo Hightower’s claim that Collins might be the best linebacker in the league might not be far off.\n“I don’t look at stuff like that,” Collins said. “I just come here and do what I’ve got to do and get out of here. That’s just me.”\nHightower smiled, “There’s nothing wrong with being modest.”\nHightower has been stout on his own accord with 1.5 sacks, one pressure and one run stuff. He is the thumping, thinking-man’s linebacker, while Collins is the instinctive ball hawk with an electric gift for physicality.\nTheir inflicted madness is well-coordinated. It stems from their nonstop powwows at Gillette Stadium and spills over to the field, where the fun-loving Dixie duo generated quite the buzz with their personable playing style.\n“Building chemistry with Jamie hasn’t really been hard,” Hightower said. “We really play off of each other, so that chemistry built really fast over these past couple years. I’ve been on the field with him more than anybody since I’ve been here. When you’re out there playing fast and having fun, you’re not worrying about making mistakes.\n“When we’re playing fast and having fun, we’re not worrying about anything.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T10:59:06.135+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
