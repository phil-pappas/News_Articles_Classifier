NANCY SCHOLZ/SPECIAL TO THE TIMES NEWS By Justin Carlucci jcarlucci@tnonline.com \nORWIGSBURG — The District 11 golf stage is much bigger than the regular season. The stakes are higher, the crowd is larger and the tension is greater. \nThe high-pressure environment didn’t seem to affect Tamaqua’s Carson Schoener. The Raider sophomore was the team’s best golfer this season, and his solid score of 92 on Monday made it evident that he’s on the District 11 golf radar for good. \n“The course played more difficult today because they recently sanded and punched the greens,” explained Schoener. “For me, it could have been better, but could have been worse. It’s a long course, that’s for sure. It’s actually the longest that I’ve played. I played much better on the front-nine. I had five bad holes that killed me, but other than that, I played pretty well.” \nLast year, as a freshman, Schoener finished fourth in the Schuylkill League meet. He’s taken a giant stride in the right direction in just one calender year. \nSchoener explained, “I dropped my average five strokes since last year and I just need to keep going at it. My iron shots improved a lot since last year, but my putting and short-game still isn’t where I need to be. We had a younger team this year; I had a lot of fun.” \nClass AA was loaded with talent this year, as William Mirams of Notre Dame earned the low-card of the afternoon (71), and the class title. Nick Maff of Bechai was right behind him, with an impressive round of 72. Class AAA was won by Max Harrington of Emmaus, who shot a 73. \nThe girls’ AA champion was Franca Hurtado of Allentown Central Catholic, who has been a household name since she was a freshman. The Schuylkill League was represented well on both sides, as Blue Mountain’s Sophie Orsulak also advanced in class AA with a round of 85. Samantha Fritzinger of Emmaus won class AAA and shot an impressive 76. \nThe D-11 team championship simultaneously took place on Monday. Marian’s golf team represented our coverage area in class AA and tied for third place. Albert McFadden led the Colts with a score of 83. \nNOT ONE..NOT TWO..NOT THREE...ACC’s Franca Hurtado won her fourth straight D-11 class AA championship on Friday with her score of 77. Technically, it’s a record that can’t be broken. Her score from Monday was tied for sixth-best amongst both boys and girls. \nTHAT 70’S SHOW...A total of 15 golfers in Monday’s D-11 competition shot in the 70’s at Schuylkill Country Club. Moravian and Emmaus were responsible for seven of those golfers. Emmaus’s Eric Chichocki shot a 78 in the team championship, but wasn’t a qualifier to compete in the individual tournament. \nOVERDUE...The last Schuylkill League female competitor to win a District 11 title was Bobby Boyle of Marian in 1989. \nDISTRICT 11 GOLF CHAMPIONSHIPS \nAt Par 71 Schuylkill Country Club \nCLASS 3A BOYS \n(Top 6 qualify for PIAA East Regional) \n1.
