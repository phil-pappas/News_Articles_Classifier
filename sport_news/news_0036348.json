Game balls were given out and one went to tight end Daniel Fells, who is hospitalized with a case of MRSA. The Giants had dedicated the game to him and they shared their feeling in an online conversation.\n“Everybody was able to cheer him and to try to make him feel better and he was very nice in saying he watched the game and liked the way we finished,” coach Tom Coughlin said.\n  Fells has made progress against the infection the past three days and is feeling better after getting a couple of good nights of sleep. \n“He was very gracious about receiving a game ball and he told his teammates what he felt about them based on their games. It was nice,” Coughlin said.\nCharles all done KANSAS CITY, Mo. — Chiefs running back Jamaal Charles will miss the remainder of the season with a torn ACL in his right knee.\nThe star running back hurt his knee in the third quarter Sunday against Chicago.
