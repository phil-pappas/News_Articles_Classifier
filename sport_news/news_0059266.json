How they happen to be down 0-2 and on the verge of elimination is impossible to fathom. \nMultiple factors came together in a perfect storm of wrong turns in those first two games in Toronto. Truth is, the how or why is unimportant. This is not a time to navel-gaze and point fingers because no amount of introspection will help them get out of this hole. They simply need to win. They need to hit the reset button and find the elements that made them a playoff favourite to begin with. \nOn Thursday and Friday at the Rogers Centre, if it could go wrong, it did go wrong. Their normally reliable defence came apart at inopportune times. Their amazing thunderous offence fell silent. They pitched well enough to win, but not quite as well as the Rangers. \n“I think we need a big outburst with the bats, score a lot of runs, really,” said manager John Gibbons on Saturday at Globe Life Park where the Blue Jays won two of three late in August. \n“If you look at our season anyway, you know, we score — we score and win, we score in bunches. That’s kind of our trademark. Their pitching has really shut us down the last two games, so we need to do that to win and I think hopefully we can do it one time, you know, catch our breath a little bit and gain a little confidence. Maybe we can hang in this thing. But that’s what it’s going to take because, really, that’s the identity of our club.” \nObviously, teams game-plan for each other during the regular season but that is nothing like the game-planning that goes into the playoffs. Scouts from every team have been following each other around for the entire month of September, searching for holes in swings, looking for pitchers’ tendencies, trying to take all the surprises out of their opponents. \n“We’ve been keeping the ball down, I think,” said Rangers catcher Chris Gimenez. “They’re aggressive, but they’re patiently aggressive. They work hard to get their own pitch and they don’t miss. And keeping guys off the bases in front of the big boys is part of it, too. \n“Our pitching staff has done a phenomenal job of making big pitches in big situations. That’s the best offence in baseball and to be able to keep them in check a little bit is a big, big plus for us.” \nThe Blue Jays are a fastball-loving club. Their hitters have feasted on fastballs all year. So it makes perfect sense that they are seeing a steady diet of breaking balls and changeups. When the Rangers do show the Jays a fastball, you can bet it’s not going to be in a spot where it can be hammered out of the park. \nThrough two games, Josh Donaldson, Jose Bautista, Edwin Encarnacion and Troy Tulowitzki are a combined 5-for-35, including one home run each from Donaldson and Bautista. What has been missing is the consistent contact that is the hallmark of the team, one through nine. \nGiven the massive buildup the Blue Jays got ahead of the team’s first playoff appearance in 22 years, it might be a break for them to get out on the road as a team. The hype at home, while appreciated by the team members, may have been a bit overwhelming to the point of distraction from their mission. Acceptance of that theory would never get any traction from within the Jays’ clubhouse, but it was clear that they did not play their usual game. It showed up on defence at times, especially in the early innings of Game 2 when their failure to make plays cost them at least two runs, and maybe three. \nThere is something about going into a hostile road environment that can sometimes galvanize a team. Certainly, the Rangers felt that way in Toronto, free of pressure and inspired to silence the roar of the home crowd. That sense of togetherness could work in the Jays’ favour in Game 3, with their entire season at risk. \nThe Jays have been exceptional this season at staying in the moment. Perhaps that tendency was shaken a bit on Thursday and Friday when the moment became too big to ignore. Now, on the road, together and without the unintended pressure dogging their every minute, they may be able to regain that singular focus. \nMarco Estrada has been as consistent as any of the Blue Jays starters. He pitched a gem against the Rangers in this park in blazing heat on Aug. 27, losing 4-1. He’ll have no trouble keeping his job in perspective. \n“I’m taking it the same way as I would any other game,” he said. “We’ve got to win, regardless. Even if we would have won Friday, I would have had the same mentality going into the game on Sunday. So nothing’s really changed for me. I’m going to give it my all, no matter what. Like I said, if we were up 2-0 or down 0-2, like we are, it’s the same mentality for me. I know how to handle it and I’ve been there before, so I’m looking forward to starting Sunday.” \nPlayoff baseball history is dotted with teams that put together spectacular seasons then fizzled when the lights of October shone brightly. Witness the 2014 Los Angeles Angels who won 98 games, then got steamrolled by the wild-card Kansas City Royals in the first round. The 2001 Seattle Mariners won 116 games, but got blown out in the ALCS. \nBut there are others, like the 2012 San Francisco Giants who lost the first two games of the NLDS against Cincinnati, then swept the final three games on their way to a World Series title. \nRight now, for the Blue Jays, it’s all about one win. There is nothing more than that on the radar. For them, the alternative is too sickening to contemplate.
