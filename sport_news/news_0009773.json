Comment   Stephen Shank Posted Oct. 14, 2015 at 11:18 AM By Stephen ShankSports Editor Posted Oct. 14, 2015 at 11:18 AM The East Peoria Lady Raiders spoiled Canton's Senior Night with a 28-26, 25-9 Mid-Illini Conference win over the Lady Giants on Tuesday. Even though coach Amber Alexander's team lost in two games, they gave the Lady Raiders all they wanted in the first game. \"We came out and played really well,\" said Alexander. \"We talked, we were moving, and we passed the ball well. Unfortunately, we couldn't do the same things in the second game.\" East Peoria appeared to be on their way to an easy win in the first game, building their leads to 4-0 14-10, and 18-11. CJ Buzzell controlled the net as she had several kills in helping her team take the lead. Meanwhile, the Lady Giants never led during the first portion of the game, knotting the score at 6-6 and then again at 8-8. However, the hosts put together probably one of their best runs of the year after the Lady Raiders had extended their lead to the seven points. A sideout put the serve into the hands of Lily Dixon. She rattled off four consecutive points, forcing an East Peoria timeout. Once play resumed, another point from Dixon had the Lady Giants to within 18-17. The teams then traded sideouts before a trio of points from Jasah Dwyer enabled the Lady Giants to take a 21-19 lead. Later, the game was tied three more times before Canton took a 24-23 after it appeared that Dunlap got the point. However, the officials held a short conference and awarded the point to the Lady Giants as East Peoria was called for a double-hit during the volley. Canton had one-point leads at 25-24 and 26-25 only to have the visitors get game-saving hits from their front row. Finally, Haley Plumer produced a point on a kill from Taylor Scharp before a second point from Plumer earned the win when Canton's third hit went into the net. As eluded to before, the Lady Giants never got untracked in the second game. After the Lady Raiders broke a 2-2 tie on a point from Scharp, the eventual winners expanded their lead to 12-5 on a block at the net from Buzzell. A pair of Canton timeouts over the next few serves didn't help much as the Lady Raiders steadily pulled ahead, holding leads of 17-6 and 19-8. In the end, Canton got just one more point on a sideout before the night ended on a pointfrom Shelby Frank on a kill from Buzzell.
