At the very least, some of them will be paying World Series ticket prices.\nThe average price of a ticket on the secondary market for Games 3, 4 and 5 at Wrigley Field next week was $1,325.93 on Thursday, according to ticket aggregator TiqIQ. If that figure holds, it will make NLCS games at Wrigley the most expensive on record for fans buying tickets on the secondary market.\nSince 2010, the next highest average ticket price for LCS games at any ballpark was $687.15, for San Francisco Giants home games during the 2012 NLCS. Even by World Series standards, based on TiqIQ’s data, the asking price for Cubs tickets next week is high.\nOf the 10 teams to meet in the last five World Series, only three drew a higher average secondary-market ticket price for home games than what Cubs ticketholders are asking for. Fans paid an average of only $1,140.19 per ticket on the secondary market for World Series games at San Francisco’s AT&T Park last year.\nIt’s not all bad news for Cubs fans: tickets for Game 3 on Tuesday start at $500. But getting close to the field is another thing. As of Thursday, the priciest ticket listed was for a front-row seat behind the visiting team dugout. Asking price: $11,700.\nENLARGE", "external_links": ["http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/OG-AF926_COUNT1_G_20151014165346.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-15T01:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T01:33:09.518+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
