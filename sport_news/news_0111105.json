We could have won clearly but we didn't score and we paid with two points. It was a tough game and we need to recover,\" said Porto coach Julen Lopetegui, who was a goalkeeper on the books at Barcelona in the mid-1990s, the same period in which Mourinho formed part of the backroom staff at the Camp Nou.\nAlgerian winger Yacine Brahimi injured his right knee during that game and missed training over the weekend as a result, casting doubt over his chances of playing, but Brazilian defender Maicon hopes to feature despite hurting an ankle in the same match.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T17:22:55.966+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
