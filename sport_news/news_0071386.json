Hmm, indeed. \nMurphy was asked after the game if he had heard of this peculiar trend. \n\"Is [Murphy] the name of the goat? Is that what it is? Somebody told me that today,\" Murphy said after the game. \"What do I make of that? A unique coincidence.\" \nAnd a unique coincidence that the Mets would like to continue for three more wins in the NLCS and then four more in the World Series. \nMurphy's only hit Saturday was the home run, but it was his fourth in six games in these playoffs. He hit 14 this season, which is no small feat especially for a second baseman, but it's certainly nothing like this postseason rate. \n\"Saving the homers, I guess,\" Murphy said. \"No, really, I've said it before that if I knew what I was doing, I would have hit more homers during the regular season. But I think [hitting coach] Kevin Long we really started hunting pitches in the middle of the plate in...I started getting a little more aggressive, so we kind of talked and found out what are my strengths, what are my weaknesses? \n\"And he really helped me to play as much as I could to one of my biggest strengths, I think, which is I don't swing and miss a lot. So if I can get a good pitch to hit, there is a good chance I should be able to hit it hard.\" \nHis manager, Terry Collins, couldn't find enough laudatory words for Murphy's postseason. \n\"Well, I think Dan Murphy is an All-Star,\" Collins said. \"So I don't think it's something that's strange. I think Dan gets in the batter's box. We all know when he gets hot, he can hit anybody and he can do a lot of damage, and he's hot.\" PLUS : Juan Lagares botches fly ball, redeems himself at plate in Mets' Game 1 victory \nAnd, perhaps fittingly, the last out of the game was on a fine play by Murphy at second. \nThe Cubs had a runner on first base in the top of the ninth inning as Tommy La Stella ripped a ball in the hole between first and second base. Murphy scampered to his left and dove for the ball, stopped it quick, and made the throw to first for the game. Runners are easily on first and third if it scooted through. \nMurphy talked in detail how he was in the right position. \n\"I don't know if you saw, but I freaked out when I caught it, and then you've got to make the throw,\" Murphy said. \"Good thing Lucas is a fine target to throw to.\" \nHe went further: \n\"To tell you the truth, Tommy La Stella, he's from Atlanta...We played against him last year all season. He's a really good hitter. Stays on the ball well, and [Mets' closer] Jeurys Familia right there went to the splitter, so I think I gave him about a half step step to the pull side of the 3-4 hole, and it ended up being just enough to get there...And I was hoping that he'd be cheating to the heater, and that the splitter would kind of he'd hook it a little bit, and I just happened to be in the right spot.\" \nSort of like he's been all postseason. And the Curse of Murphy, at least for the Cubs, continues. \nRyan Hatch may be reached at rhatch@njadvancemedia.com . Follow him on Twitter @ryanhatch .
