There are no beads hanging from his neck or clinging to his wrist. Despite the missing outward sufi appearance, Dhruv Sufi is a bard, a dervish at heart. The ‘sufi’ attached to his name doesn’t jar; it neatly merges with him, with the Dhruv. In Chandigarh on the invitation of Soulmate and V2O, Dhruv mesmerizes the audience at Chandigarh Club, as he raises the pitch of his voice, the one that knocks the door of the heaven, making all the blessed souls there come and watch over him! Dhruv Sufi comes is India’s first neo sufi/folk artiste who has done more than 2500 concerts worldwide. He is also the winner of Leap Frog MTV Coke Studio Delhi, but laurels are not something he will be resting on. If he has to rest, it is under the shades of soulful music where he finds solace. “Sufism and sufi music have just one message and that is of love for humanity. The sufi dervish have tried to spread this message through poetry, through music. And this is something that connects with my existence and with my heart.” From teaching music at Ambala Cantt, the thirst for sufi music took Dhruv to Delhi where he found answers to many questions. “I would often ask my father who was in army to explain me the meaning of Punjabi words as I would listen to Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan. It is he who told me that every word, every song had a story behind it. In Delhi I met Ustad Iqbal Ahmed Khan (elder) and Dr Anish Ahmed Khan from the Delhi Gharana and thus started my sufi journey. I found this performing art better than all others,” he says. Like the dervishes travel the length and breadth of the country spreading the message of love, so does Dhruv through his concerts. “I would rather see it spread at national and international level,” shares the singer. Also, in order to take sufi music to as many as possible, Dhruv along with his team is also coming up with a sufi digital library. “I fall short of words if I were to explain the effect sufi music has on the senses. It connects me to god, and I end up closing my eyes when I sing.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T06:08:41.469+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
