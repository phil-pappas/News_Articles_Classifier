But Luck only did limited work for the last three days. \nIf Luck doesn’t play this week, backup quarterback Matt Hasselbeck will likely make his third straight start after leading the Colts to wins over Houston last week and Jacksonville the week before. \nSunday’s meeting between the Colts and Patriots is the first since New England beat Indy 45-7 in the AFC Championship in January. \nCopyright © 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T20:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T22:23:33.405+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
