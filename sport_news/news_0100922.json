With his hind legs, kicked me square in the face,” Attard said this week at his barn in the Woodbine backstretch. \n“Basically, the right side of my face was (crushed) and my nose broken. I was very lucky to still be here. I fractured the whole right side of my face from my orbital bone all the way across to my upper gum.” \nAttard, who also suffered a severe concussion, underwent surgery and had metal plates put in his face, which remain there to this day. \nThere was a worry that he might not live, never mind condition horses again. \nBut despite the horrific accident, Attard was back at Woodbine helping his dad the next season. \nIt’s certainly not an easy life, but when you’re the son of a racing icon, there’s really no other way to make a living, though Attard remembers a time when business was so slow, he almost walked away. \n“We’ve had some good years, we’ve had some real hard ones,” said Attard, who has 32 victories in 128 starts this season, with earnings of $1,497,661. “Prior to me training for Knob Hill Stable (in 2006), I was ready to pack up and leave the industry. I was down to four horses at a public stable. I don’t think I won my first race until around mid-September and I just bought a house, I had a young family and wasn’t making ends meet. \n“I had actually sent out a bunch of resumes to the outside world trying to get a job over the winter time and then the opportunity came with Knob Hill and I got hired and it kind of gave me the kick-start I needed.” \nThanks to the Knob Hill owner, the late Steve Stavro, Attard began a slow rise in the trainer rankings, from 48th place in 2006, to tied for eighth last season to second this year. \nAlong the way he’s developed some top-level horses, including Prince of Wales winner Alezzandro, Durham Cup champ Leonnatus Anteas, multi-stakes winner Surtsey, last year’s Canadian champion sprinter Calgary Cat and Melmich, the latter two owned by Stephen Chesney and Cory Hoffman. \nMelmich, a $20,000 claim last season, takes on the streaking Florida Won, trained by Casse, in this Saturday’s Grade 3 $150,000 Durham Cup at Woodbine. \nThe four-year-old Wilko chestnut has won six of eight starts for his new connections since being claimed on Sept. 26, 2014. \nHe arrives at Saturday’s \n1 1/8-mile stamina test over the Woodbine main track on a three-race win streak with a career-best 102 Beyer Speed Figure at the top of his form from a gate-to-wire score in the Elgin Stakes. \nA win in the Durham Cup would be another feather in the cap for Attard, who is hoping his breakout season will open some eyes with some of the more prominent owners at Woodbine. \nHis dad, Tino, also has a horse entered in the Durham Cup, Turkish. \nAttard is grateful for all the owners who have stuck with him through thick and thin, but one of his favourite owners is a 12-year-old Brampton boy who has a real eye for talent, his son Joshua, who won three races at Woodbine in 2014 with Bet On Jack (two wins) and Slickorrego. \nTino Attard put a couple of his horses in Kevin’s name when he was a kid and Kevin thought it would be fun to do the same for Joshua, who is certainly no casual observer. \n“He loves all sports in general, but he’s very astute when it comes to horse racing,” said Attard. \n“He’s always on the iPad, I’ll walk by and he’s watching video replays of races that I don’t even know. He checks out The Racing Form, he’s on Equibase, he’ll call me in the mornings, sometimes before he goes to school or on the weekends, and say, ‘Dad, did you work anybody?’ He’s got all the apps and everything. For a 12-year-old it’s kind of amazing to sit there and watch him. \n“Last night we were watching the baseball game and he’s got the iPad and he’s watching some replay of some race.” \nIt seems likely that a third generation Attard will be training at Woodbine before long, though Kevin isn’t sure he wants that for Joshua. \n“Ideally I would like to see him do something else,” said Attard, who works seven days a week during the season, starting his day at 4 a.m. \n“It’s a very hard industry. There’s a lot of long hours. There’s times when you’re not winning, and it can get tough. Everybody needs to work hard at what they do to be successful, but there’s also times where you would like a little more time for yourself. It’s hard on your family, it’s hard on your body.” \nStill, the hard work has paid off and Attard is hoping for bigger and better things ahead, starting with a win by Melmich in the Durham Cup on Saturday.
