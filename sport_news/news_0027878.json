Hesser scored her first career goal midway through the second half to help lead Portsmouth to a 5-0 win over Oyster River on Thursday. With the win, the Clippers finish the regular season 11-2-1 and will receive a first-round bye to the 12-team Division II tournament. Hesser's goal came made it 3-0 and came right after an Oyster River timeout. \"In the huddle, I said to myself I wanted to score a goal,\" Hesser said. \"I wanted to come down on them like a tsunami, get everyone going, erupt like a volcano. Energy just exploded and it started a spark.\" Indeed, as the Clippers got goals from Erica Musto and Ellie Hunkins in the final minutes of the contest to close out the scoring. The Clippers dominated the first half with seven penalty corners to the Bobcats' one and a 15-1 advantage in shots, but had only a 1-0 lead to show for it. \"I don't think we came out with the intensity we needed to,\" Portsmouth coach Sara Carpenter said. \"We need to do that to get us positioned for a playoff run.\" Olivia Grant scored the first of her two goals with 6:37 to go in the frame off a penalty corner. \"There was a tornado of emotions going on,\" Grant said. \"A lot of excitement, a lot of nerves, especially with the playoffs coming up after this. We were excited it was our last game. We wanted momentum, but it took a while to get that momentum.\" Grant made it 2-0 with a goal early in the second half. Oyster River fell to 0-13 and has yet to score since a 5-1 loss to Derryfield in its season opener. The Bobcats close out the season today at home against Souhegan. \"We're struggling,\" Bobcat coach Mark Smallwood said. \"I try to get them to play confidently, but the panic mode sets in. They get a touch on a ball and it's like a hot potato.\" Despite the lopsided score, Oyster River freshman goalie Gabbie Haug had an outstanding game, keeping Portsmouth off the scoreboard for most of the first half and stopping a penalty stroke by Portsmouth's Katie Locandro midway through the second. Portsmouth finished with a 23-1 shot advantage. Haug took over full-time goaltending duties for the Bobcats in the sixth game of the season having not played the sport previously. \"She's doing fantastic,\" Smallwood said. \"She has a boatload of potential with little experience. She's growing up every day. She's going to be, with more experience, a real force down the road.\" Portsmouth will host a D-II quarterfinal next Saturday. The semifinals are Oct. 28 in Exeter and the final is Nov. 1 in Bedford.
