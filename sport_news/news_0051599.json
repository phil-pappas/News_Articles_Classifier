So it’s definitely exciting and can’t wait for it.”\nDomi is set to make his NHL debut tonight in Los Angeles when the Coyotes open the 2015-16 campaign against the Kings, their first opportunity to reveal progress after a disastrous last season that saw the team dive to second-to-last in the overall standings and key up a rebuild in an attempt to climb back to respectability.\nAfter visiting the Kings, a Pacific Division rival, the Coyotes will host Sidney Crosby and the Penguins Saturday in their home opener at Gila River Arena.\nAZCENTRAL\nArizona Coyotes goalie Mike Smith gets sports psychologist assist\nThe 20-year-old Domi is the poster boy of the team’s decision to inject youth – and its accessories like speed, skill and energy – onto the roster as a way to kickstart growth throughout the entire organization, and the move comes at a time when rookies throughout the NHL are poised to steal the spotlight.\nGenerational talent Connor McDavid, taken first overall last summer, and No. 2 pick Jack Eichel appeared in their first NHL games Thursday as 18-year-olds, signaling the beginning of a season-long watch party of perhaps the game’s next dynamic superstars.\nThe hype surrounding those two is merited, but Domi’s transition with the Coyotes could also be one to watch.\nDomi will be the highest homegrown draft pick (12th overall in 2013) to debut for the Coyotes since defenseman Oliver Ekman-Larsson – a No.6 selection in 2009 – first appeared five years ago. He wasn’t thrust into the NHL immediately; twice Domi was returned to junior after failing to make the team out of training camp. But it’s those experiences that have probably upped his chances of having an impact now. “Everybody’s talking about obviously McDavid and Eichel for good reason,” said USA Today hockey expert Kevin Allen. “But I believe that Max Domi could have the same kind of impact for the Coyotes that Eichel’s going to have for the Sabres and McDavid’s going to have for the Oilers. He’s almost exactly what they need.”\nAZCENTRAL\nArizona Coyotes ready to find out what Max Domi can do\n“When they sent him back here, some kids will pout,” said Dale Hunter, who coached Domi while he was with the London Knights in the Ontario Hockey League. “But he said, ‘No. We’re going to win, and this is what we’re going to do.’ I can’t say more about him. He was a complete player, and he was a great leader in our room.”\nDomi was a prolific scorer in the OHL and a winner, eclipsing 30 goals three times and 90 points twice in a four-season stint that saw the Knights capture the OHL championship in each of Domi's first two years with the team. But expectations with the Coyotes haven’t been defined numerically.\n“If we see improvement from the start to the finish, that’ll be a very successful year for him,” coach Dave Tippett said.\nClearly, though, Domi will be given the opportunity to deliver.\nHe’s assigned to a top line next to center Antoine Vermette and winger Mikkel Boedker and should receive looks on the power play.\nAZCENTRAL\nCoyotes size up potential forward lines\nMcDavid and Eichel are in similar situations on their respective teams, and already Edmonton General Manager Peter Chiarelli has identified 20 goals and 40 points as an estimation for McDavid's output with the Oilers.\n“The official position of the Oilers is to temper the enthusiasm a little bit because these are very young players,” Allen said. “I don’t think it’s unrealistic to expect 50 points out of any of those three players. They’re capable of that.”\nTime will tell what the benchmark will be for this year's crop of newcomers. Only twice has the rookie scoring leader surpassed 65 points since Alex Ovechkin paced the 2005-06 class -- that included Crosby (102) -- with 106. The most recent leaders for full-length seasons finished with 64 in 2014-15 (Johnny Gaudreau and Mark Stone), 63 in 2013-14 (Nathan MacKinnon) and 52 in 2011-12 (Gabriel Landeskog and Ryan Nugent-Hopkins).\nDomi, like other young wingers Anthony Duclair and Jordan Martinook, simply wants to stick with the Coyotes permanently, embracing a small-picture focus that was implemented by his dad – who will be in Los Angeles for Domi’s debut along with Domi’s mom, two sisters and some extended family members.\n“My old man is definitely the first guy to tell me, ‘Don’t look further than the next step you take,’” Domi said.\nAZCENTRAL\nArizona Coyotes live chat - Oct. 7\nThat doesn’t mean he’s out of touch with pressure or what his arrival could indicate for the future of the franchise.\nActually, Domi doesn't mind that responsibility.\nAfter all, he’s been waiting an awful long time for it.\n“For me, it’s really what drives me – the excitement,” he said. “It’s not so much nervous. It’s hey, ‘You worked your whole life for it. Enjoy it, and it’ll be fun.’”\nReach the reporter at sarah.mclellan@arizonarepublic.com or 602-444-8276.

If Scott clears waivers, the team would have the option of sending him to the American Hockey League without requiring waivers before he plays 10 games in the NHL or remains with the team for 30 days.\nThe plan, however, appears to be to have Scott stick with the team.\n“John’s here, and he’s not going anywhere,” Tippett said.\nKings update: The Kings started their season with a 5-1 loss to the Sharks Wednesday. New addition Milan Lucic was given a match penalty for going after the Sharks’ Logan Couture near the end of the game, and the top line featuring Lucic, center Anze Kopitar and winger Marian Gaborik finished a combined minus-6. Los Angeles blanked on the power play, going 0-for-6, and gave up two power-play goals in eight chances. Center Nick Shore was the team’s lone goal scorer. Goalie Jonathan Quick made 27 saves. Aside from Lucic, the Kings also added defenseman Christian Ehrhoff over the summer after missing out on the playoffs last spring.", "external_links": ["http://admin.brightcove.com/js/BrightcoveExperiences.js", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/5e774fd0dbf7197fc7379d7320a0aaf7bfb36bf3/c=0-257-1534-1791/local/-/media/2015/08/26/Phoenix/Phoenix/635762199873920709-2coyotes.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/b978044dbf5fbc6b859a18f3c0b6d9d5fb8fd9fa/c=201-0-1696-1495/local/-/media/2015/10/07/Phoenix/Phoenix/635798543586416224-Smith.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/4b1da529482b8bb81d5e2905d42c4d9e644cd3bd/c=21-0-1859-1838/local/-/media/2015/10/08/Phoenix/Phoenix/635798629765353068-Domi.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/259d0c53345d80568b4d8af1fb93f304a056430f/c=413-0-2588-2175/local/-/media/2015/07/16/Phoenix/Phoenix/635726788300674634-uscpcent02-6ladkjn4n6wm8br46my-original.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/96e040d3cf528ad7e1ac20cf3af49fc35c0c103b/c=602-0-2861-2259/local/-/media/2015/10/06/Phoenix/Phoenix/635797554865292086-coyotes.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-09T03:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T06:12:10.242+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
