For now, they’re just following his lead.\nToffoli scored two goals, and scored for a fourth consecutive game and the Kings, perhaps not coincidentally, extended their win streak to four games with a 3-0 victory over Carolina on Friday night at Staples Center.\nThe Kings, playing the second of back-to-back games, once again allowed a lot of shots on goal (40) but got strong goalie play from Jonathan Quick -- who recorded his first shutout of the season -- and goals from Toffoli and Anze Kopitar .\nToffoli scored a power-play goal midway through the first period, and that was enough for Quick, who, after a ragged start to the season, has allowed a total of two goals in his last three games.\nToffoli has six goals in his first seven games. His teammates have combined for seven other goals. The Kings would prefer a bit more balance, but have to be thrilled with the development of Toffoli, who is only 23.\nFast starts are becoming common for Toffoli, who scored five goals in his first 12 games last season on his way to a 23-goal season. The Kings then signed him to a two-year, $6.5 million contract that, based on the first month of this season, looks like a bargain.\nFor a second consecutive year, a line centered by Jeff Carter is leading the way for the Kings. Last season, Toffoli and Tanner Pearson flanked Carter and were dominant in October. Now, Pearson has dropped to the third line, replaced by newcomer Milan Lucic, but Toffoli hasn’t stopped scoring.\nToffoli gave the Kings a 1-0 lead with 8:54 remaining in the first period Friday with an opportunistic power-play goal. Alec Martinez’s point shot deflected off Lucic in front of the net. The puck kicked back out to Christian Ehrhoff, who fed a quick pass to Toffoli for a shot and goal.\nThe second period was ragged for the Kings, who periodically suffered from dangerous defensive-zone turnovers, but Quick was solid and turned away 28 shots through the first two periods.\nKopitar gave the Kings a 2-0 lead with a 4-on-4 goal 8:04 into the third period and Toffoli added his second goal with three minutes left.\nContact the writer: rhammond@ocregister.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T14:40:22.849+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
