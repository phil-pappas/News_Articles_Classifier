The Pirates faced off with Wadena-Deer Creek first, and were dominant, winning 7-0, and only dropping one set along the way. For the complete results, go online to crookstontimes.com . In the afternoon, the Pirates faced Roseau, the lone Section opponent to defeat the Pirates this season, and when the lineups were released the Pirates were quite surprised. The Rams rearranged their lineup quite a bit from their first match, in order to try to take a few spots, and make the Pirates work for their win. “I just told the girls that if they play well they’re going to win,” head coach Mike Geffre said. “It doesn’t matter what Roseau does, we just have to worry about ourselves.” At first, however, it looked like the Ram strategy might work, as at one point, five matches were going on, and the Pirates were losing in four. “A little bit,” Geffre admitted when asked if he was a bit nervous after the fast start from Roseau. “But I know my kids were going to fight. They have enough confidence in their ability that they’re not going to quit; they’re going to keep coming at you.” And that’s just what the Pirates did, as three of the four matches in which the Pirates dropped the first set not only saw the Pirates win the second, but also the third, as the Pirates sported three very important come-from-behind wins. Those wins came from the number three doubles duo of Alyssa Schultz and Elise Tangquist (who have lost just once when playing together all season), Jaeden Lizakowski at the number four singles spot, and Alyssa Fee at the number two singles spot. Fee’s match, in particular, stood out to her coach. “She lost the first set; was down in the second set; won the set in a tiebreaker; and then won the third,” Geffred noted. “She could have been done several times, but she kept coming back. That was great to see.” In regards to the third doubles duo of Schultz and Tangquist, Geffre said, “They just get getting better and better as the match went on,” and that could really have been said about all the Pirate players. For a team that looked to be on the ropes early in the match, the Pirates ended up topping Roseau 6-1, in an impressive turn around.
