Here are some highlights.\nQuestion: With Patterson gone, how long a leash does Strong get under current leadership?\nTim Cowlishaw: I don't think that should change, a coach needs a certain amount of time. Obviously, the pressure increases each season. Cal has somehow gone from a 1 1/2 to a 6 1/2 point favorite in Austin this week. Not sure what that's indicative of. Does someone think the players are reeling without their beloved AD? It's odd. But Charlie needs to win 8 games this season to start going in the right direction. And Heard needs to be pretty good which seems possible.\nQuestion: Who is your choice for new Texas AD?\nTim Cowlishaw: I wanted Oliver Luck to get the job last time, not because he's Andrew's dad (too late to benefit from that).I got to know him when he was working for Tex Schramm's World League. He's not only a very interesting guy, he is a very smart guy. Not sure he wants to take another run at it, but I would certainly look at him.\nQuestion: Do you get the feeling the Texas OC backed Swoopes up and that's why he lost his play-calling duties? I can't imagine anything else would make you notice something in Week 1 you couldn't detect in four weeks over the summer.\nTim Cowlishaw: He lost the play-calling duties because of 38-3. Or whatever the score was. And, yes, because he insisted Heard wasn't ready and it was better to stick with Swoopes even though Swoopes was a bad fit for this offense all along. Now the Longhorns have pushed re-set, and will see what Heard does against a better Cal team Saturday.\nCLICK HERE TO VIEW THE FULL CHAT\nOn Twitter:\n @TimCowlishaw", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/TimCowlishaw"], "published": "2015-09-18T02:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T12:55:56.159+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
