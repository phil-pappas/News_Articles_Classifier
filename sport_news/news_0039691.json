Getty \nFrench team Lyon could earn up to €14m (£10.3m, $15.9m) from Anthony Martial's move to Manchester United, according to chairman Jean-Michel Aulas. Martial, 19, became the most expensive teenager in history when he arrived at Old Trafford from Monaco for an initial fee of £36m on transfer deadline day in August, a figure reported by BBC Sport. \nMonaco vice president Vadim Vasilyev revealed following the transfer United tripled their bid for the French prodigy in a matter of days before eventually agreeing a structured deal that could total £57.6m. Le Parisien claimed the performance-related clauses that would see United stump up the full fee included €10m when he scores his first 25 goals for the club, €10m should he make 25 appearances for France and another €10m should he go on to win the Ballon d'Or award. \nMartial came through Lyon's youth academy, making three appearances for the first team before joining Monaco in 2013. Having played a part in the striker's development, Aulas insists the club will also receive a healthy share of the transfer, having included a 20% sell on clause when they sold the player to Monaco. Martial has been winning praise from all quarters since arriving in Manchester. Getty \nAulas told RMC Sport €8m of the transfer fee belongs to Lyon with another €6m to potentially follow should Martial hit his targets. \"We will receive 20 percent of the supplementary payments of €30m when they are collected, probably in the next three or four years,\" he said, according to ESPN. \"They represent €6m to come in addition to the €8m already accounted for.\" \nWhile Martial's move initially caused considerable surprise, his performances for club and country have seen him begin to win doubters over. The teenager marked his arrival in the Premier League with a stunning debut goal against Liverpool before going on to win the PFA Player of the Month award for September. Although his full debut for France only came last week, his performance saw manager Didier Deschamps talk up the possibility of leading Les Blues attack later on.
