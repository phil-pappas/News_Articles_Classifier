AUSTRALIA HEAD COACH MICHAEL CHEIKA AND SKIPPER STEPHEN MOORE WALKING INTO NEWS CONFERENCE 2. RUGBY WORLD CUP SIGN 3. SOUNDBITE (English) AUSTRALIA HEAD COACH, MICHAEL CHEIKA, SAYING: \"Like I have said before, no team has ever won the world cup losing a game. We want to work on our improvements each week, which in your tournament play you have to do. You have to keep getting better because other teams are improving, everyone is playing around each other, some teams start a bit slower and are then getting a move on. You have to continually improve and, obviously, by the consequence of winning each game you win your pool. I don't subscribe to the theory of win your pool and you are going to get an easier run because that is disrespecting the opposition and that is not what we are about. So, we just want to do our best against Wales. It is going to be a big game, big game for us. We want to enjoy that part of it but also by ready for a massive battle because it is going to be pretty painful. I reckon it is going to be a tough game.\" STORY: Australia can't afford to slip up against Wales according to head coach Michael Cheika, as he delayed naming his team for the match as he waits on an injury update to key players. Cheika told reporters at a central London news conference on Thursday (October 8) that he was more concerned that the Wallabies maintained their winning ways with victory on Saturday at Twickenham, rather than ensuring an easier quarter final. Both Australia and Wales have qualified for the last eight from Pool A - at the expense of hosts England - and whoever finishes top will meet Japan or Scotland, rather than South Africa. Topping the pool will also mean the likelihood of avoiding New Zealand in the semi finals. \"Like I have said before, no team has ever won the world cup losing a game,\" said Cheika. \"We want to work on our improvements each week, which in your tournament play you have to do. You have to keep getting better because other teams are improving, everyone is playing around each other, some teams start a bit slower and are then getting a move on. You have to continually improve and, obviously, by the consequence of winning each game you win your pool. I don't subscribe to the theory of win your pool and you are going to get an easier run because that is disrespecting the opposition and that is not what we are about.

We want to enjoy that part of it but also by ready for a massive battle because it is going to be pretty painful. I reckon it is going to be a tough game.\" Australia were impressive in dismantling England 33-13 last weekend, with many experts tipping them as the main threat to current World Champions New Zealand.
