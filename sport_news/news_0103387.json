It’s such a blessing to contribute to what we’ve been able to do,” Murphy said.\n  Lucas Duda hit a three-run homer in the first inning and a two-run double in the second at Wrigley Field, silencing a crowd of 42,227 desperately hoping for the beginning of an epic comeback in Game 4.\nNot this time. Not with New York’s array of power arms, and Murphy swinging a hot stick that made him the NLCS MVP.\nManager Terry Collins’ team advanced to the World Series for the first time since the Mets lost to the crosstown Yankees in five games in 2000. They will play at either Toronto or Kansas City in Game 1 on Tuesday night.\nBut the first big question for New York is the health of center fielder Yoenis Cespedes, who left in the second inning with soreness in his left shoulder. Any health issue for the slugger could be a big factor in the next round.\nThe Cubs, meanwhile, still haven’t won the crown since 1908. Manager Joe Maddon’s wild-card bunch surged into this series but was overmatched.\n“They didn’t give us — they did not let us up for air at any point,” Maddon said. “Their domination of the early part of the game and their pitching was impressive.”\nBy wrapping it up fast, the Mets can now set up their imposing rotation how they want for the World Series. Jacob deGrom, Matt Harvey and Noah Syndergaard will all be on full rest.\nRight when it looked as if his historic streak was coming to an end, Murphy connected for a two-run drive to center against former Mariners closer Fernando Rodney in the eighth inning. The second baseman raised his right arm as he rounded first after his seventh homer of the playoffs — the string includes a shot in the deciding Game 5 of the Division Series at Dodger Stadium last week.\nSeattle Times staff", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T00:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T08:03:56.258+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
