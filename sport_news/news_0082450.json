(Stephen Mally/The Gazette) Most Popular October 9, 2015 | 10:43 pm \nCEDAR RAPIDS — It was not your typical Tyler Dralle night Friday at Kingston Stadium. \nDralle scored four touchdowns and rushed for 138 yards. That’s normal. \nBut he played little more than a quarter in No. 4 Cedar Rapids Kennedy’s 49-0 demolition of Waterloo East in a Class 4A District 5 football game. \nDralle averaged 31 carries in the first six games for Kennedy (7-0, 3-0), but only toted the ball 15 times against Waterloo East (0-7, 0-3). \n“I always like to carry the ball,” said Dralle, who scored on runs of 2, 2, 1 and 3 yards. He also ripped off runs of 27, 21 and 39 yards. “We did what we expected and got the job done.” \nKennedy’s win sets up a district showdown with 10th-ranked Cedar Falls next Friday night at Kingston Stadium. \n“This was a great game to play heading into Cedar Falls,” Kennedy Coach Brian White said. “We’ve played a pretty tough schedule up to this point. We have two tough games coming up (Cedar Falls and Waterloo West). \n“Anytime you have an opportunity to have a game like this and maybe rest some kids a little bit — like a Dralle — it’s great.” \nJust how much of a mismatch was this game? Kennedy amassed 441 yards of total offense to minus-1 for East — in the first half. The Cougars led 49-0 at halftime and there was running clock in the second half. \nKennedy scored touchdowns on 7 of 10 first-half possessions. The ones that failed to produce points ended with a fumble at the East 1, a missed 47-yard field goal attempt, and to end the half. \nNick Duehr completed his first four passes for 122 yards and a touchdown. Shaun Beyer caught four passes for 102 yards and also had a 34-yard run. \nEleven different Kennedy players carried the ball for 335 yards of rushing offense. East was held to minus-11 yards rushing. \nIt was a whipping. \nThe only downside were the 12 penalties called on Kennedy.
