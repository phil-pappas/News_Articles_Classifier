ALEXANDER was hired as Booker T. Washington's coach earlier this year, he evaluated every player on his roster.\nHe noticed something special about lineman Jamari Logan. Not only was he big - 6-foot-5, 400 pounds - but he was athletic and light on his feet.\n\"He's an athlete,\" Alexander said of Logan, who has offers from Norfolk State and Mississippi Valley State. \"When we saw that, we said we got to create some kind of package for him, especially for short yardage.\"\nAlexander and offensive coordinator Jarome Bell remembered former Chicago Bears lineman William \"The Refrigerator\" Perry and other big guys who carried the ball in the past, and implemented a \"Jumbo\" package. The result? Logan has scored a team-high five touchdowns as a running back.\n\"He loves it,\" Alexander said. \"Once we call it, that's his favorite word.\"\nThe only thing Logan lacked was a nickname. Someone recommended \"The Freezer.\"\n\"I like that,\" Alexander said, laughing. \"From now on we're going to call him 'The Freezer.' \"\n____\nHe said it\n\" (Salem) doesn't make mistakes. And mistakes killed us tonight. But this is not the end of our season by any means. I know they're disappointed, but they'll bounce back.\"\nCox coach Bill Stachelski, after the Falcons' 27-14 loss to Salem on Friday\n____\nTough time for Greyhounds\nIt's been a long season for Norcom coach Larry Archie.\nThe Greyhounds fell to 0-6 with Friday's 21-20 loss to Granby. Norcom hasn't gone winless this long since the 1978 Greyhounds started the season 0-7 and finished 2-8.\n\"It's frustrating because we can't get out of our own way; turnovers and mistakes have killed us,\" Archie said. \"We've been in some games, but winning is a process and we're just not ready to win. We're just not good enough to make the kind of mistakes we're making and expect to win.\"\nArchie wouldn't use his team's youth as an excuse, but the Greyhounds graduated 25 seniors after last season, leaving the coach with only four players with varsity experience. Archie has leaned on a number of people for advice; Lake Taylor coach Hank Sawyer told him when a team is struggling a coach has to give players a reason to play on.\n\"I've got to give these guys something to hold on to come back Monday,\" Archie said. \"We're a little down right now, but we can get it fixed.\"\n____\nBy the numbers\n60\nPoints scored Friday by Princess Anne in a victory over Tallwood - the Cavaliers' most points since a 56-0 win - also over Tallwood - in 2000.\n- Compiled by Larry Rubama\n[X] Click a thumbnail to view the full-size image.
