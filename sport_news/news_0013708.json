The Cardinals produced offense against the hosting BlueJays, but they couldn't make enough defensive stops in the 52-28 loss in Class 3A District 6 play. By Newton Daily News Sports Staff \nOnly one of the five area high school football teams posted a victory Friday in Week 8 action. Newton, Colfax-Mingo, Collins-Maxwell/Baxter and Prairie City-Monroe dropped district contests while Lynnville-Sully claimed a district win on the road. \nIowa high school football teams have one remaining regular-season game. Colfax-Mingo and Lynnville-Sully are in the top four in Class A District 7 going into next Friday’s action. PCM and CMB should be headed to the playoffs in Class 2A — both teams play in 2A District 7. Newton is out of the playoff picture in Class 3A District 6 without a win this season. \nBondurant-Farrar 52, Newton 28 \nBONDURANT — Newton High’s Cardinals had just scored on a 1-yard touchdown run by Joseph Banfield. Josh Gulling’s extra-point kick cut the margin to three, 17-14, with 8:34 left in the second quarter. \nTwo minutes later, Bondurant-Farrar regained its 10-point lead now a 24-yard touchdown run by Cole Schlenker. The BlueJays had two big plays in the final 3:36 of the second period — a pick-six by Seth Moeller and a 54 yd touchdown run with nine seconds on the clock — which put the visiting Cardinals up against wall. \nAfter the interception return, Newton shock it off and marched down the field, using three minutes and Dalton Nevels pushed his way through traffic on a 17-yard touchdown run. It was 31-21, then Jarrid Clark slipped a couple of tackles on the edge and raced 54 yards to paydirt just before the break. \nNewton trailed 38-21 at halftime and never made it up. Schlenker had two rushing touchdowns for B-F in the third quarter as the Jays kept the Cardinals winless, 52-28. \nThere was good news and bad news for Newton. \nReese Rosenquist had a strong second half running the football in his first major offensive role this season. He scored a touchdown from 3 yards out in the fourth quarter. Jwan Roush was back in the lineup and had a big catch-and-run play. Both players were back in the starting defensive backfield. \nThe bad news is the injury bug continues to bite the Cardinals. Banfield went down with an ankle injury at the end of the first half. Austin James, Andrew Weiland, Jake Bennett and Alex Miller suffered injuries Friday night. \n\"I felt like we were in great shape there halfway through the first half. We just couldn’t figure out how to get some stops on defense,” Newton head coach Ed Ergenbright said. “We have one game left. We’re going to try to get healed up and see if we can get one at home.” \nNewton is 0-8 overall and 0-5 in Class 3A District 6 play. The Cardinals host Nevada Friday in the final district contest. \nNewton's freshmen beat Bondurant-Farrar, 33-6, after building a 26-0 halftime lead Friday. \nLynnville-Sully 39, North Mahaska 6 \nNEW SHARON — Battling for a playoff spot in Class A District 7, Lynnville-Sully’s Hawks know they have to post wins in their final two regular-season games. They got one victory Friday night, defeating host North Mahaska, 39-6. \n“We played really well defensively. Our defensive line had a great night. Those guys up front are counted on to eat up blockers so our linebackers can make tackles,” Hawk head coach Mike Parkinson said. “Trevor Squires, Jayson Hardin and Kyle Van Dyke do a tremendous job up front for our defense.” \nSage Ehresman rushed for more than 100 yards and three touchdowns to power the Hawks. Evan Squires got the scoring going for Lynnville-Sully in the fist quarter. In the second period, the Hawks scored 22 points, which included a touchdown pass from Tyler Van Zante to Noah Engle. \nNorth Mahaska scored its touchdown in third quarter. Engle hit a 43-yard field goal in the fourth quarter for Lynnville-Sully. \n“We had to win and we wanted to win by 13 points to help with the point differential in district play. We accomplished those tonight,” Parkinson said. “We have to come back next week and play a complete game without the turnovers and penalties we had tonight. Belle Plaine is a good team.” \nLynnville-Sully hosts Belle Plaine Friday at Sully. The Hawks are 4-2 in district play as is Montezuma while Belle Plaine is 3-3. Those three are battling for the final two district playoff spots. The top four advance with BGM as the No. 1 seed and Colfax-Mingo as the No. 2 seed. \nNorth Polk 24, CMB 7 \nALLEMAN — Collins-Maxwell/Baxter turned the ball over five times, including twice in the red zone, as North Polk locked up at least a No. 3 seed out of Class 2A District 7 Friday night. \nMax Karpinske had three interceptions on defense, and he brought two back for scores. He also threw a 45-yard touchdown pass to Matt Cox. \nKarpinske's first pick-six came early in the second quarter when the Comets trailed 7-0. He intercepted a Brady Stover wide receiver pass at the 5-yard line and sprinted 95 yards down the North Polk sideline for the score. \n\"The play was wide open, but it got tipped,\" CMB coach Rob Luther said. \"I thought that play changed the game. We just never recovered from it.\" \nCox did most of the work on his 45-yard touchdown pass from Karpinske in the third quarter, but Karpinske put the game away when he snatched a Nate Bishop pass at the 40 and rumbled 60 yards for the touchdown. \nKarpinske's final interception came late in the game when the Raiders were deep in North Polk territory again. \nGrant Rampton also had an interception and a fumble recovery as the Comets improvecd to 5-3 overall and 4-1 in district play. North Polk can claim a first-round home playoff game and the district's No. 2 seed if it can win at PCM next week. \n\"You won't beat anybody turning it over five times,\" Luther said. \"We hung in there, but we needed to make some plays early in the second half and just didn't do that.\" \nCMB dropped to 5-3 overall and 2-3 in league play. The Raiders need to win at Centerville to earn a playoff spot as the district's No. 4 seed. \n\"We still have some football left,\" Luther said. \"We have to go down to Centerville and win and hopefully gain some momentum for the playoffs.\" \nThe Raiders finished with 321 total yards and out-gained North Polk, but the turnovers proved to be too costly. \nBishop was 23-of-35 for 186 yards and three interceptions. He did rush nine times for 41 yards and scored CMB's only touchdown on an 11-yard run in the first quarter. \nBrady Stover had seven catches for 60 yards, Hunter Gunderson had four catches for 58 yards and Brady Kemp hauled in seven catches for 53 yards in the loss. \nBlake Coughenour returned to action after missing three straight games but lasted only three plays after suffering a knee injury. He carried the ball twice on the opening drive and gained 43 yards. \nHunter McWhirter and Toren Schultheis also left the game in the first half with concussions. \n\"The injuries didn't help,\" Luther said. \"I told (Coughenour) that he was going to carry it 40 times tonight and he goes down on the third play, and it doesn't look good for him. It changed our mentality not having him in the game.\" \nBGM 35, Colfax-Mingo 0 \nCOLFAX — The Tigerhawks trailed 14-0 at halftime, lost all-state quarterback Jared Myers to an injury in the third quarter and lost for the first time since the season opener. \nClass A No. 2 BGM locked up the Class A District 7 No. 1 seed after the win and remained undefeated overall at 8-0. Colfax-Mingo (6-2, 5-1) can do no worse than the No. 2 seed and ends the season next week with a trip to GMG, which dropped to 1-7 on Friday night. \nColfax-Mingo came into the game averaging 41 points during its six-game win streak, but BGM's had four interceptions and recorded a shutout for the fourth time in its last five district games. \nBGM's offense rushed for 332 yards. Colton Massengale amassed 180 yards and a touchdown on 34 carries and Dalton Jack gained 80 yards and two scores on the ground. \nJayce Knight had four catches for 114 yards, including a 34-yard touchdown catch from Tanner Jansen. \nAlbia 42, PCM 6 \nALBIA — Class 2A No. 1 Albia rolled to another win and locked up the top seed out of Class 2A District 7. \nPCM (6-2, 4-1) had its six-game win streak snapped. The Mustangs will now have to beat North Polk at home in the regular season finale next week to earn the No. 2 seed and a first-round bye in the playoffs. \nAlbia led 28-0 at halftime. The Mustangs' only points of the game came on a 3-yard touchdown pass from Logan Gilman to Lucas Greiner in the fourth quarter. \nGilman was 15-of-32 for 169 yards and one interception. Greiner caught 10 passes for 112 yards and Reid Jenkins led the defense with six solo tackles and five assisted tackles. \nCarter Isley led the Blue Demons. The all-state tailback and future Northern Iowa Panther wrestler had 178 rushing yards and two scores on 22 carries. He also caught a 73-yard touchdown pass and completed a pass for 40 yards.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T08:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T20:27:27.596+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
