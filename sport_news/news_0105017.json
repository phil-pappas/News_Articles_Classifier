As players now, we have all the support of the sports science and all the guys to help us in terms of preparation, training and games, so I think it's still a fairly young age.\" \nRooney's current contract at Old Trafford expires in 2019 and the forward is not contemplating when he will hang up his boots. \nHe said: \"I couldn't sit here and say I am going to play five or 10 years. I think when the time comes I'm sure I'll know and I will have to assess the situation then, but it's something I haven't thought about. \n\"Players in the past have known when the time is right to finish playing and I'm certainly nowhere near that stage. I feel fitter and fresher than I ever have done, really, so for me it's a number. In terms of me and my football career, it's not important.\" \nMeanwhile, former United boss David Moyes, now at Real Sociedad, has praised Rooney, who he also worked with at Everton as a youngster. \n\"History has already judged him, because when you pick up the record books, there will be the name of Wayne Rooney,\" Moyes said in the Daily Mirror. \"He's already surpassed Sir Bobby Charlton as England's leading goalscorer and I'm sure he will go on to do the same at United. \n\"The England record is a great achievement, particularly when you look at the calibre of goal scorers before him -- Sir Bobby, Jimmy Greaves, Gary Lineker and Alan Shearer, all great strikers. \n\"Wayne has shown he belongs in that class and you have to score the goals to be top of the pile, which the record books show. \n\"For Wayne to be breaking records at his age is remarkable -- and he's not finished yet.\" \nFollow Joy Sports on Twitter: @Joy997FM.
