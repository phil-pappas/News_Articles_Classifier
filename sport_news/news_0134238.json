Any job cuts as a result of the merger will be \"extremely minimal,\" Baird said.\nWirtz Beverage names new leaders Jessica Wohl Wirtz Beverage Group said Monday that Danny Wirtz is taking over the role of president of the family beverage business from his father, Blackhawks Chairman Rocky Wirtz, who will now serve as the beverage company's chairman.\nAlso, Arthur Wirtz III, known as Art, was promoted to the new role of chief...\nWirtz Beverage Group said Monday that Danny Wirtz is taking over the role of president of the family beverage business from his father, Blackhawks Chairman Rocky Wirtz, who will now serve as the beverage company's chairman.\nAlso, Arthur Wirtz III, known as Art, was promoted to the new role of chief...\n(Jessica Wohl) Geographically, there's little overlap in terms of distribution between the two.\n\"When you look at our markets, this is not driven by necessity. … There are not a lot of redundancies,\" Baird said Monday. \"We think this is a springboard for future growth.\"\nWhile Breakthru Beverage Group will be headquartered in New York City, it will maintain a corporate office in Chicago. Baird will be president and CEO of Breakthru. Wirtz and Charlie Merinoff, currently chairman and CEO of Charmer Sunbelt, will be co-chairmen of the new company's board. Danny Wirtz, president of Wirtz Beverage Group, will be vice chairman. Arthur Wirtz, current chief operating officer, will take on the new role of executive vice president of operations, while also serving on the company's board.\nFinancial details of the deal, which is expected to close in January, were not disclosed.\nThe beverage industry has been marked by change and upheaval, with Anheuser-Busch InBev's looming takeover of SABMiller that would create the world's largest beer company. Other beer giants have also made moves to acquire craft breweries. Wine and spirits companies have also consolidated, including Japan's Suntory buying Deerfield-based Beam for about $16 billion last year.\nBlackhawks' Rocky Wirtz honors his dad by not following his lead Phil Rosenthal No one would have loved the Stanley Cup celebration more than former Blackhawks Chairman Bill Wirtz.\nThe sad thing is that if he were still around to enjoy it, it's unlikely there would be anything to enjoy.\nFrom his death in 2007, and son Rocky's assumption of control, the Blackhawks were reborn.\n... No one would have loved the Stanley Cup celebration more than former Blackhawks Chairman Bill Wirtz.\nThe sad thing is that if he were still around to enjoy it, it's unlikely there would be anything to enjoy.\nFrom his death in 2007, and son Rocky's assumption of control, the Blackhawks were reborn.\n... (Phil Rosenthal) Distributors are finding they must change too, Danny Wirtz said.\n\"For us to find ways to continue to grow and to become more relevant, this partnership was one way to do that,\" he said.\nIncreasingly, suppliers are looking for larger distributors that are adept at using data to build strategies, Baird said. He pointed to the surge of craft beer that's led to more \"consumer promiscuity.\"\n\"People are not loyal to brands like they used to be,\" Baird said.\nHaving local data across multiple markets will allow Breakthru to work more effectively with suppliers, Baird said.\nMerinoff, whose family has distributed alcohol dating to 1944, brushed off the suggestion that the combined company would have more clout negotiating with suppliers.\n\"My competition thinks of leverage,\" Merinoff said. \"I don't think of leverage.\"\nWirtz Beverage began its distribution network in Illinois and Wisconsin in 1945 before expanding into Minnesota in 1956 and Nevada in 1977. Its beer, wine and spirits portfolio represents $2 billion in gross annual sales. Rocky Wirtz took the helm of the company in 2007.\nThe deal expands the distribution footprint for both companies. Combined, Breakthru will distribute in Alabama, Arizona, Colorado, Delaware, Florida, Illinois, Maryland, Minnesota, Mississippi, Nevada, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Virginia, Washington, D.C., and Wisconsin. And the company expects to continue work with affiliates in Connecticut, Iowa, Missouri, New York and Canada to boost gross annual sales to about $8 billion.\nThat would be enough to make Breakthru the second-largest distributor in the country behind Miami-based Southern Wine & Spirits, Danny Wirtz said. Southern executives announced a corporate leadership expansion last month, saying sales have increased \"threefold\" in the past decade.\nIn March 2014, Wirtz Beverage announced its foray into Canada, taking over as the national broker for Diageo, the world's largest distiller. That part of the business will continue to be managed, but not owned, by Breakthru Beverage.\nTuesday's expected deal will have no direct connection to the rest of Wirtz Corp., which is known for its ownership of the Blackhawks and co-ownership of the United Center, Rocky Wirtz said. The company also does business in real estate, insurance and banking.\nMerinoff said the new company could continue to grow and change the industry.\n\"There's no next deal out there. But I wasn't willing to sell to Rocky. And Rocky wasn't willing to sell to me. … I believe there will be some like-minded people who want to come with us,\" he said.\ngtrotter@tribpub.com\nTwitter @GregTrotterTrib\n Rocky Wirtz Anheuser-Busch InBev Business SABMiller", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-5584b47b/turbine/ct-rosenthal-blackhawks-fathers-day-0621-biz-20150619", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-54fdfe54/turbine/ct-wirtz-beverage-president-0310-biz-20150309", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-56257be6/turbine/ct-wirtz-beverage-merger-1020-biz-20151019"], "published": "2015-10-20T14:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T15:04:57.656+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
