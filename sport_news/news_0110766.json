Questions started developing across the basketball world: Was this the end of an era in San Antonio? The Spurs used the offseason to answer.\nUSA TODAY\nHouston Rockets preview: Howard needs resurgence for them to move on\nWhat’s different this season? Tim Duncan, Manu Ginobili and Tony Parker are another year older, but does it really matter? They prove year after year that they don’t age like mortals. The biggest addition is LaMarcus Aldridge, who averaged 23.4 points and 10.2 rebounds last year for the Portland Trail Blazers. As if adding Aldridge wasn’t enough, they also managed to re-sign defensive player of the year Kawhi Leonard to a five-year, $90 million extension.\nHow good can they be? Adding a superstar in the offseason is always a dream come true for an organization, but adding a superstar to a team that already had championship potential ... that’s something most teams don’t even dream of.\nUSA TODAY\nDallas Mavericks preview: Hoping bad summer doesn't hurt season\nHow far they have to go: All of the pieces are there for San Antonio, now they just have to make them fit. We’ve seen superstars changing teams end in disasters in the past (2012-13 Los Angeles Lakers). Luckily for the Spurs, disaster and Gregg Popovich are two things that just don’t go together. As long as the Spurs can make this work, they will be a legitimate contender once again.\nWill it ever end? Since the Spurs drafted Duncan in 1997, there’s been no slowing down San Antonio. In his 18 seasons, they’ve made 18 playoff appearances. Six Finals trips have resulted in five championships. The Spurs have without a doubt been the most dominant franchise the league has seen over the past two decades.\nThe future of a franchise: Aldridge is 30 and has been a top-five power forward since his second season. Leonard is 24 and has already been Finals MVP and defensive player of the year. With Danny Green, Ray McCallum and Patty Mills on the roster, we could be looking at another decade of Spurs dominance.\nCONNECT 2 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/10/26/USATODAY/USATODAY/635814499540979243-AP-Spurs-Kings-Basketball.1.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/014a2be02f7dcc2bd4efc793bd28df99dc4f1913/c=80-0-3586-2636&r=x404&c=534x401/local/-/media/2015/10/26/USATODAY/USATODAY/635814499540979243-AP-Spurs-Kings-Basketball.1.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/bd5ebba3467b279ba9ea3c69e8a236317ec97560/c=0-121-3875-2310&r=x1683&c=3200x1680/local/-/media/2015/10/20/USATODAY/USATODAY/635809445566876835-USP-NBA--Preseason-Denver-Nuggets-at-Dallas-Maveri.jpg", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1S6n7Tp&mini=true", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/8dd645c1974889eadcee3d5b680c2b63f1fe0ff0/r=500x340/local/-/media/2015/10/26/USATODAY/USATODAY/635814499540979243-AP-Spurs-Kings-Basketball.1.jpg", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1S6n7Tp&text=San%20Antonio%20Spurs%20preview%3A%20Don%27t%20think%20they%27re%20done%20just%20yet&via=usatoday", "http://imgur.com/NQcGvaV.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/24b5b8704a12bbad374b28aa01ad66960718e192/c=0-374-4164-2727&r=x1683&c=3200x1680/local/-/media/2015/10/26/USATODAY/USATODAY/635814495930804101-USP-NBA--Houston-Rockets-at-Phoenix-Suns.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-26T19:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T18:36:39.485+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
