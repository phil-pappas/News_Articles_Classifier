USA Today Sports 1 day ago by Brant James, USA TODAY Sports M © Provided by USA Today Sports artin Truex Jr. looked dejected. Wet and dejected. His proverbial glass was half empty, on this particular early May night at Kansas Speedway, with rain water.\nAdChoices Truex Jr.’s Furniture Row Racing team had led 95 laps — including when a red flag halted the event because of storms — and for extended periods been the utter class of the field in the SpongeBob SquarePants 400. Ultimately, he finished ninth for his 10th top-10 in 11 races to start the season. He left Kansas second in driver points. Pretty good, considering. But that didn’t seem very comforting for a driver whose potential first victory since 2013 had been undone by an eventually fruitless fuel and tire call by crew chief Cole Pearn on the final caution.\nTruex Jr. and his single-car team were improving, and he acknowledged that, but nights like this, cars like this, had to be exploited, especially with a season-making Chase for the Sprint Cup berth the prize. There were no guarantees they’d get this close again.\nBut they did. Truex Jr. went on to lead 131 laps each of the next two races, finishing fifth at Charlotte and sixth at Dover. The ensuing week he led 97 more and finally captured an elusive win at Pocono. Progress was palpable.\nA mid-summer swoon of sorts followed, but he meandered into the Chase seeded ninth. Nice story, so was the thought, even though this was no tiny operation from the hinterlands, Colorado mailing address or not. There was the technical alliance with Richard Childress Racing, after all, which put two drivers in the Chase this season, including 2014 runner-up Ryan Newman.\nOn numerous occasions, much to Truex Jr.'s and his team’s confidence-building glee, the No. 78 Chevrolet had out-classed its RCR partners, but after finishing a woeful 32nd in the final regular-season race, at Richmond, Truex Jr. didn’t have the sheen of a driver who would be around long in this Chase, especially in a system developing a ruthless habit of ejecting megateams and former champions.\nBut Truex Jr.’s season is currently defying expectation in that regard, too.\nAnd that’s why Truex Jr.’s glass is half full as he returns to the 1.5-mile Kansas oval this weekend for the second race of the second round of the Chase. Third in points and “comfortable” at the venue, Truex Jr. seemingly is in prime position to continue a Chase advance that should no longer be deemed a surprise.\nKansas, he said, “is the race that I keep on saying that we're due to strike gold.”\nTruex Jr. was second with 10 laps left this spring when the final caution was issued and Pearn ordered him in for fuel amid concerns of making the distance. After the race, Truex Jr. would call this decision the first mistake the first-year crew chief had made in a race, while lamenting his never-ending struggle with races that come down to wisps of fuel. Truex Jr. restarted fifth but was bogged down on a restart and overwhelmed by cars that took tires under caution.\nNow, with a win, career-best eight top-fives and 19 top-10s, he returns a title contender.\nCertainly, the elimination of high-profile drivers like six-time series champion Jimmie Johnson after the first round has aided Truex Jr.’s cause. So has bizarre circumstance for Kyle Busch and mechanical maladies for championship contender Matt Kenseth, who are both below the current cutline of eight drivers who will advance to the third round. And seemingly is a worthless state of being in this second-year version of the Chase, which imperils all but race winners.\nFinally mining a first win at Kansas is not an unrealistic proposition, though. Truex Jr. has two runner-up finishes among four top-5s in seven starts there since 2012. Both of those runner-up finishes came with Michael Waltrip Racing, which, ironically, makes its final six stops before oblivion as Truex Jr. appears to finally have regained footing in a promising career.\nTruex Jr. was the casualty of a 2013 scandal at the regular-season finale at Richmond, when NASCAR determined that MWR officials contrived to manipulate the race and secure his entry into the Chase. Instead, the team incurred the most substantial penalty in series history, Truex Jr.’s sponsor, NAPA, left the sport and his team was disbanded. The 35-year-old two-time Xfinity Series champion landed at Furniture Row last season as a replacement for Kurt Busch, who shepherded the team into the Chase in 2013. After finishing 24th in points, with just one top-five last season, amid personal tumult as longtime partner Sherry Pollex was being treated for ovarian cancer , Truex Jr. was due a turn in fortune. He got it, as MWR lost investor Rob Kauffman to Ganassi Racing and will close after the season.\nTruex Jr. has earned this late-season shot, finishing a point-saving 11th in an elimination race at Dover, where passing was a chore after being forced to start at the back because of an illegal pre-race modification discovered by NASCAR. He drove a supposedly mediocre car to third at Charlotte last week after expecting to spend the race in “damage mode.”\nAnd he returns to Kansas searching for something that got away this spring. If he gets it, that rainy night in May won’t seem so disappointing anymore.\nFollow James on Twitter @brantjames\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.usatoday.com/sports/", "http://twitter.com/brantjames", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nascar/2014/10/28/martin-truex-jr-girlfriend-sherry-pollex-fighting-ovarian-cancer-together/18061015/"], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T17:27:38.627+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
