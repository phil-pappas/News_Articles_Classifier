But you wouldn't know it from the businesslike way they've carried themselves so far in preseason practice, where they've been treated and coached just like any of Memphis' six other freshmen.\n\"I've held them to the same accountability as I would anybody else. I've demanded the same amount of excellence that I would from anybody else. And we're gonna need them to produce like we need everybody else to produce,\" Pastner said.\n\"I've been very impressed by both young men. They're good players, but they're very respectful. They're accountable. They're good people. They're both gonna have good years this year.\"\nThey'll need to if Memphis is going to make a fifth trip in six seasons to the NCAA tournament this year.\nDedric, who averaged 20 points and 15 rebounds for Class AAA state champion Hamilton High last year, is projected as the Tigers' starting power forward with Austin Nichols having transferred this offseason to Virginia. K.J. (23.4 ppg on 60 percent shooting at Hamilton last season) will play both forward positions — a la ex-Tigers forward Nick King (who's now at Alabama) — with Memphis thin on big men.\nK.J. — a consensus top 50 recruit who wasn't ranked highly enough to earn McDonald's All-American honors like his younger brother — said he's fine playing wherever he's needed.\n\"I just want to bring a winning attitude and do whatever coach (Pastner) asks me to do and go out there and perform and make plays and get everybody involved,\" he said. \"If you're a ball player, you're going to play and you're going make your own position on the floor because nobody limits you when you get out on the floor. As long as you're on the floor, you can make mismatches. That's how I look at it. People get caught up in positions, but positions ain't really nothing but what you make it.\"\nDedric said he isn't intimidated by the fact that he'll probably be in the starting lineup when the Tigers open the season Nov. 14 against Southern Miss at FedExForum. Though he skipped his senior season of high school to enroll early at Memphis, Dedric has put on 25-30 pounds of muscle in preparation for this season and is now listed at 228 pounds — the same weight Nichols was listed at as a sophomore last season.\n\"I wouldn't look at it as pressure because if you look at things as pressure, you make yourself nervous. I just look at it as an opportunity to do what I need to do to make the team better and just to win games, basically,\" Dedric said.\nK.J. and Dedric are both good rebounders whose shooting range and ability to take defenders off the dribble can create mismatches. But there's a competitiveness and fire to K.J.'s game that Dedric's lacks at times.\n\"He's gonna always just have that aggressive edge because he's been looked over really our whole life on everything that we did together,\" Dedric said of his older brother. \"They always like looked at me as a better player than him, but we're both the same player. We were both raised the same way. I don't know. I guess because I'm younger, they look at me as a better player. But K.J. is a great athlete, a great player and he has a great mindset and a great IQ. He's a better competitor than anybody I know.\n\"I'm trying to get that competitive edge like he has to make me a better, more aggressive player.\"\nThat's precisely what the players' father, second-year Tigers assistant Keelon Lawson, wants to see.\n\"My job this year is to make sure that Dedric plays with as high a motor as K.J. has,\" Keelon said. \"I try not to compare them and (Dedric) knows that. But at the same time, it's like, 'Hey, man, K.J. is playing with a chip. You've gotta play with a chip, too.\"\nKeelon said he's not surprised with how well the brothers have handled themselves in preseason practice. \"Last year, throughout the year, I was just telling them what to expect. 'When you come in, just do what coach Pastner asks you to do, work hard and be ready to produce,'\" he said.\nBut he added that he has been pleasantly surprised with how quickly the team has embraced his sons.\n\"I thought they might have problems with guys (saying), 'Man, y'all just here because of your daddy,' or blah, blah, blah. But the guys have embraced them, and that's what I like about this team this year — it's not where you have different cliques,\" Keelon said.\n\"At any given time, you might see KJ hanging out with TB (senior Trahson Burrell) and (senior) Shaq (Goodwin) and (senior) Ricky (Tarrant). And you'll see Dedric hanging out with Shaq. At any given time during the week, they'll have that camaraderie that we didn't have last year. That's made it exciting. In practice, I'm hearing TB tell Ricky, 'Man, go ahead and give Smoove (Dedric) that ball, man, because he's the McDonald's All-American. Let's make sure he's getting what he's supposed to get.' Last year, we didn't hear that kind of stuff.\"\nThat was last year, says K.J.\n\"We've got to get the whole concept of the Memphis Tigers back to where we're just all about working; coming in and putting in the work, not worrying about nothing else and letting everything else handle itself,\" he said. \"I just know outworking someone, that's all I been known for. And that's what the city of Memphis is known for: We work. We're gonna outwork you. That's what it's all about.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T01:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T10:31:32.749+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
