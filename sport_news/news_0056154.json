Following a 19-18 homecoming win a week ago versus Canton, the Raiders still have a chance to make the postseason field for the first time since 2012. After snapping a three-game losing skid, East Peoria (2-4, 1-3) plays host to Morton (0-6, 0-4) Friday in a Mid-Illini Conference game at Corwin Clatt Field. Although the Potters are winless, they have three consecutive losses by less than 10 points. East Peoria prevailed 20-14 in 2014. Elsewhere ... In a Heart of Illinois Conference matchup, Tremont (3-3 2-3) seeks its fourth straight victory overall Friday when it squares off against Colfax Ridgeview (0-6, 0-4). After back-to-back road wins, the Turks return home, where they have a 1-2 mark. The Mustangs are struggling mightily with four defeats in a row by more than 30 points. Tremont was a 48-6 winner last year. • Fresh off a pivotal Week-6 victory over El Paso-Gridley, Dee-Mack (4-2, 2-2) looks to become playoff eligible Friday with an HOI triumph over Flanagan (0-6, 0-5). Outside of a 1-0 positive result by forfeit, the Chiefs are averaging 41 points per game. The Flanagan defense has yielded a staggering 286 points, the most in the league. The Falcons dropped Dee-Mack 47-33 last season. • Eliminated from postseason consideration, Olympia (1-5, 0-5) tries to end a five-game losing streak and get into the victory column in Corn Belt Conference play Friday versus Pontiac (4-2, 4-1). The Spartans must improve their home scoring. They have registered just 12 points in their first two dates at Stanford. The Indians currently are in a three-way tie for second place in the conference with Normal U. High and Mahomet-Seymour. Olympia nipped Pontiac 18-14 a year ago.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T10:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T11:37:07.131+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
