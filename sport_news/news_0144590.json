As if to hammer home the point he now was the man in charge, Jacobs used the occasion to slam his hockey team for its inept play, saying, “Without question, this has been a very disappointing year. It’s unacceptable the way this team has performed. Given the amount of time, money and effort that’s been spent on this team, to see it deliver the way it has is unacceptable.”\nBy almost any measure, it was the first time Jacobs, a trim, buttoned-down graduate of Boston College, ever really stepped out to the middle of the Bruins stage. The youngest son of Jeremy Jacobs, who has owned the Bruins for 40 years and remains atop the Delaware North masthead as chairman, Charlie Jacobs is a far cry from other sports bosses in Boston in that you just don’t see him around much.\nConsider how often you’ve heard from Patriots owner Robert Kraft and his outspoken son, Jonathan. Or Celtics owners Wyc Grousbeck and Steve Pagliuca. And let’s not forget outgoing Red Sox CEO Larry Lucchino, who is more frequently Quote: d than most of his players. Or Sox chairman Tom Werner, who has earned props for his involvement in baseball’s pace-of-game initiatives but a ton of criticism for the decision to jettison NESN play-by-by voice Don Orsillo.\nWas Charlie Jacobs flexing his corporate muscles back in January when he delivered those harsh remarks about the Bruins?\n“That could be taken two ways,” he said last week during an interview at his Garden office. “It could be meddlesome, which I’m not, but I’m certainly involved. And I was appointed CEO, and I needed to let people know . . . that I was going to be held accountable for this. And at that time in January, we had one of the highest payrolls in hockey, and it seemed to me our players didn’t care. And I will stand by my comments. That was unacceptable.”\nHe even went so far as to observe that, “I was frustrated. I felt a little bit angry that I seemed to care a little more than everyone else did about how this team was doing. That’s how I interpreted the way they were playing.”\nThe Bruins played well after Jacobs’ comments, going 8-1-1 the rest of the month, but, well, you know the rest of the story. The Bruins failed to qualify for the playoffs, and as a result, general manager Peter Chiarelli failed to keep his job and was replaced by his assistant, Don Sweeney.\nWhen the Bruins held a press conference to announce Chiarelli’s ouster, Jacobs had a hard time explaining why the move was being made. He has since found his sea legs, telling me, “We needed a change. We needed to freshen it up. And Don Sweeney’s been a breath of fresh air. We interviewed some great candidates for GM, and it really pissed me off that somebody wrote, ‘Well, they’re going to interview all these people and they’re gonna hire Don Sweeney.’ ”\nBut the Bruins did hire Sweeney.\n“It is what we did,” Jacobs said, “but it became a foregone conclusion that anybody else that we interviewed wasn’t going to get the job, and that, I think, did us a disfavor because there were some really good candidates out there that we talked to. And frankly, the process itself allowed us a better window into our organization. To hear it through, say, the lens of a former GM or an up-and-coming GM, it’s a healthy exercise.”\nRead these comments again, and it’s not pushing things to suggest Jacobs is morphing into a young George Steinbrenner, the late, bombastic owner of the Yankees who was both a blessing and a curse to two generations of Bronx Bombers fans. And let’s not forget Charlie and his family (wife Kim and three kids) have lived in Boston for nearly 15 years, the idea being he’d be the local emissary for the Buffalo-based Jacobs family.\nIndeed, even a casual conversation with Jacobs reveals he knows his way around town. He laments the closing of a dim sum place on Route 9 he and his wife used to frequent on Sunday mornings. They’re frequent fliers at the local Sarni dry cleaners and a nearby Eaton Apothecary, and they’re fond of Coach Grill in Wayland.\nJacobs, who worked several years in California before moving to Boston, did slip up when he made this comment about his daily commute to and from Weston: “What I love about it is that it’s so close. What I hate about it is that it’s taking me an hour these days to get to and from work because of construction on the 90, which is driving me batty.”\nConstruction on the 90? But let’s not quibble: Jacobs has been among us for a long time.\nYet he wants to make one thing clear: He’s not the final word on decision-making.\n“That’s a loaded question,” he said. “I hired Peter Chiarelli, and I had to let Peter Chiarelli go. I hired Don Sweeney. We have discussions about player personnel — Don, (team president) Cam Neely and I. I do not meddle in whether they feel ‘X’ player deserves a promotion over ‘Y’ player. I leave that to them.”\nDoes everything go through Buffalo?\n“When I had to let Peter go?” he asked. “Yeah. I mean, that was a process that took some time. . . . I absolutely have to say, ‘This is something I’d like to do, and here’s why.’ Build a case for it. Not that I build a case to submarine a guy, but here’s what I see that I don’t like. And we went through the process.”\nDuring the almost 45 minutes we spoke, Jacobs never referred to Jeremy Jacobs as “my father.” It was always “the chairman.” As in, “I’m in Buffalo one day a week. I have an apartment there. I meet with the chairman and my brothers, and we go over just about every line of our family’s businesses.”\nSo far, Jacobs has been guarded with his comments about this season, which begins tonight with the Bruins hosting the Winnipeg Jets.\n“Everyone wants to hear, ‘Does Jacobs think the Bruins can make the playoffs?’” he said. “I’m trying to avoid saying this team is either a playoff contender or, if it doesn’t make the playoffs, it’s a failure. That’s not our goal. Our goal is to win the Stanley Cup, and if it takes growing pains along the way, then we have to be a little patient.”\nIf it works, great. If it doesn’t, Charlie Jacobs is going to feel the heat. No longer just a daily commuter on the 90, he now lives under the Boston sports spotlight. And it can get really, really hot there.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T09:10:27.318+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
