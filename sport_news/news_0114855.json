Coach Marla Clay's squad took the first set from the Pioneers 25-12, then came from behind late in the second set to pull out a 25-23 victory evening their conference record at 4-4 and 17-12 overall. \"This group is so much fun to coach,\" Clay said. \"They're always working hard to get better with a lot of time spent in the off-season on the fundamentals of the game of volleyball.\" In the first set after Alleman (7-18-1,0-9) won a point on its first serve to open play, the Silver Streaks got a side-out and five straight service points from Ellen Junk to open a commanding lead and they never looked back posting a 25-12 win. Galesburg did it with aggressive net play combined with excellent play from the back line. Trailing 11-17, the Pioneers got a point on a side-out but turned right around and gave the serve back to the Streaks with a side-out. At that point, Haley Stevenson served five points to make it 23-11 before an Alleman service error made it 24-12 and Junk served the set winner. The second set was nothing like the first. The visitors took and early lead at 5-1. Shayli Florine, one of two Galesburg seniors, then served five points to knot the score at 6-all. The two teams then exchanged four side-outs resulting in four ties, the last at 10-all. At that point, the Pioneers opened a slim lead but the Streaks battled back to tie things at 14-14. But Alleman again moved out in front as Galesburg made several hitting errors. Trailing 14-18, Clay called a time out to try and stop the bleeding. It worked as her team got a side-out and then a service point to cut the lead to 16-18. At that point the two sides exchanged several more side-outs with the final tie came at 21-all. Galesburg made it 22-23 with Brittnee Williams, the other senior, serving. She rifled off three straight service points for the win. \"This group is so competitive,” Clay said. “They will just not give up and they will battle all the time. “In that second set we were making too many mistakes early with our hitting but when we got close we picked it up as things started to go our way.\" Florine led the Streaks with 13 kills chipping in a pair of blocks and a service ace. Kylee Townsell added 19 assists while Stevenson had 12 digs. \"We lose two outstanding seniors in Shayli and Brittnee but this is a very talented group, probably the most talented I've had in a few years so the future is bright,” Clay said.
