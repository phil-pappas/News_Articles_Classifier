It hangs out on surfaces in the training and locker rooms and on their skin, and when an athlete gets a cut, it can get infected. \nAs to whether the superbug could be spread through a cortisone injection, she said, \"While it is unlikely, with any injection there is always a small chance to introduce infection.\" \nMRSA starts as a skin infection, but it can spread to the small tissue, joints, bone, lungs, or even bloodstream, Flomenberg said. With an extensive infection, joint drainage and/or surgical removal of infected tissue might be needed along with antibiotics to improve healing. \nHerbert Cushing, infectious-diseases expert and chief medical officer at Temple University Hospital, reassures that the infection is usually localized and not limb-threatening. \n\"While for a long time vancomycin was the only good antibiotic available to treat MRSA, there are better antibiotics available now,\" he said. \nPrevention and early treatment seem to be the key. All sports equipment and facilities need to be cleaned regularly. And players should frequently wash their hands, practice good hygiene, and avoid sharing personal items. \nThey should also bandage all open wounds and watch for infection. \nTracey Romero is sports medicine editor of Philly.com and writes the \"Sports Doc\" blog, www.philly.com/sportsdoc .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T06:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T08:52:10.331+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
