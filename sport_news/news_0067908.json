The No. 16 pick of the 2015 NBA Draft had 16 points, 6 assists, 4 rebounds and 4 steals in a 111-105 preseason victory over the Nets Monday at the Garden. The lightning quick Rozier made all three of his 3-point attempts after missing the last two preseason games with a bruised left knee. “I thought Terry had the best bounce of all of us,” Stevens said, “and that’s probably because he sat all week.” Forward Amir Johnson scored 10 of his 15 points in the third quarter when the Celtics extended a 59-58 halftime lead to 87-80. Kelly Olynyk scored 14 points. Evan Turner collected 10 points, 7 rebounds and 6 assists. Thomas got kicked in his left shin at Brooklyn and it flared up Sunday so he sat out Monday. Jae Crowder (thumb) and David Lee (sick) also didn’t play for Boston. Bojan Bogdanovic had 18 points and Thomas Robinson 15 for the Nets, who rested all of their usual starters. The Celtics improved to 4-1 this preseason and both of their victories against NBA teams have come against the Nets (2-4). Boston won its first two games in Europe before winning in Brooklyn, 109-105, last Wednesday. The Nets used an 8-0 run to pull within, 92-90, with 7:22 to play, but R.J. Hunter scored on the break and James Young followed with a pair of 3-pointers to boost the Celtics’ lead back to double digits, 100-90. The Celtics conclude their preseason schedule by hosting the Knicks at the Garden on Thursday and playing the Sixers in Manchester, N.H., on Friday.
