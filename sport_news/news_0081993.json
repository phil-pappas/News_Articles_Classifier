The game was rescheduled from Friday due to poor weather conditions, but that did not stop the Panthers from executing their game plan against the Millers. Buy this photo Zach Gewelb/Staff Photographer The Cedar Grove football team improved to 4-1 on the season following Saturday night's road victory over Millburn. \nAfter a scoreless first quarter, senior quarterback Nick Zecchino found Evidence Njoku down the field for a 60-yard touchdown to give Cedar Grove a 7-0 lead. Millburn tied the score shortly after when quarterback Peter Serruto found John Serruto in the end zone for a 12-yard touchdown. \nThe Panthers took the lead before the half when junior Evidence Njoku returned a Millburn kickoff 85 yards for a touchdown. Njoku, who had two kickoff returns for touchdowns in a game against Hoboken earlier this season, used his speed and agility to break tackles and found the end zone to put Cedar Grove on top. \nThe Panthers increased their lead to 21-7 early in the second quarter when Zecchino threw a 12-yard touchdown pass to sophomore Joseph Rufo. Later in the quarter, junior running back Dan DiPrenda slashed his way through the Millburn defense to score from eight yards out, giving the Panthers a 28-7 lead. \nThe Millers scored in the fourth quarter to make the score 28-14, but could not mount a comeback against the solid Cedar Grove defense as the Panthers earned the road victory. The win was the Panthers' first league victory of the season and improved Cedar Grove's record to 4-1 in 2015. \nThe Panthers have another league matchup Friday, Oct. 16 when they host West Side at 7 p.m. \nEmail: gewelb@northjersey.com Â© 2015 North Jersey Media Group Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T19:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T00:18:01.453+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
