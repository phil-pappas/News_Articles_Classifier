And just when he thought there was a chance to come back, another setback would deny him. \nBut Steele is now healthy and hoping to provide a presence on special teams, where he excels, and in the backfield where he has done everything the tailback position requires in Toronto’s passing system. \nWhat Steele welcomes the most is to get hit in Ottawa, that feeling football players truly appreciate only when they’ve been away from the game for an extended time. \n“There are a lot of emotions,’’ said Steele. “I’m anxious, nervous, ready. I feel mentally I’m prepared, physically I feel prepared, my body feels good. \n“I feel like I’m more prepared in the mental stage just taking the time out and watching film, instead of physically being in there. It’s like I know the game better.” \nSpecial teams loom even larger in the CFL at this time of the year when weather becomes a factor. In a perfect world, the Argos would be at home in Toronto and under a closed roof, but it’s been, yet again, one of those imperfect seasons for three-down football given the politics and egos. \nFor Steele, the game could be played on Mars given his absence and the internal struggles he waged when he wouldn’t play and be a presence. \n“It was a process throughout,’’ said Steele of his road back. “Week 4 (an away game in Regina) was looking good and then came Week 6 and it didn’t look good. Then I had a setback. I just wasn’t strong enough and ready to come back. \n“It was frustrating, but I stayed strong and now it’s Week 13 and I’m ready. I’m feeling great. \n“From here on out, it’s crunch time. It’s the time to make your playoff run. We know what we are as a team, right now. The key for us is to go out there and execute, but our team is peaking.” \nWhen the Argos went into Ottawa and beat the RedBlacks last Saturday, all three phases — offence, defence and special teams — made plays as Toronto turned in its most complete game of the season, starting and finishing fast, though they did hit a rough patch in the third quarter. \nThat’s the encouraging part. \nSteele provides another source of encouragement because he’s refreshed, healthy and he will be a difference-maker. \n“I couldn’t come back at a better time,’’ said Steele. “I’m hoping to use my experience from a special-teams level and doing even better that what I did last year. \n“Running the football and blocking, which is always the No. 1 priority, being a check-down release for Trevor (Harris). I feel strong, explosive. I feel like I’m in good enough shape to go out and give it my all.” \nSteele playing on Tuesday night means Chad Kackert won’t. \nWhen the Argos beat the RedBlacks last weekend, Kackert returned the opening kickoff 21 yards, and didn’t get his hands on the ball the rest of the night. \nA team guy whose presence is invaluable inside the locker room, the 2012 Grey Cup MVP has appeared in five games this season when many thought he would never play again following two horrific injuries in the past two seasons. \nRAY INCHING CLOSER \nIn Toronto’s previous two visits to Ottawa, Ricky Ray dressed, leading the team at quarterback in the inaugural home kickoff for the RedBlacks, then leading the Argos in their pre-game routine during the Argos’ most recent visit. \nRay will be back Tuesday night as the Argos play their second road ‘home’ game and is slowly inching his way back into potentially playing in a live game. \nRay didn’t look good in the week of practice before last Saturday’s game at TD Place, being picked off and showing no zip on his throws. \nHe’s looked much better this week and while it’s still Trevor Harris’ team, the hope is that Ray can at least play in the event of an injury. \nWhen it happens and whether it happens has yet to be determined, Ray’s most recent live action came in last season’s second-to-last kickoff in Montreal when he suffered a concussion. \nThis past off-season, Ray underwent shoulder surgery. \nBoth Harris and Ray are free agents this off-season.
