More Information \nFairfield County Sports Hall of Fame class of 2015 \nJackie Robinson Professional Wing \nTed Drury (Trumbull), Max Pacioretty (New Canaan) \nJames O'Rourke Amateur Wing \nLisa Brummel (Westport), Lambert Shell (Bridgeport) \nJ. Walter Kennedy Community Service Wing \nJack Kvancz (Bridgeport), Angela Tammaro (Greenwich) \nDrury joins his younger brother Chris (Class of 2008) in the pro wing, becoming just the second pair of brothers enshrined in the Hall of Fame. \nThe Hirschbecks, John (2010) and Mark (2013), were the first siblings to be honored, also both in the professional category as Major League Baseball umpires. \nDrury said joining his brother made an already special night even sweeter. \n“It is a tremendous honor and it is even more special because my brother is already in the Hall of Fame,” Drury said. “It’s very cool. We definitely never thought about (going into the Hall of Fame), we just loved to compete and loved to play.” \nA nine-year NHL veteran from 1993-2001, Drury played 414 games with six different teams during his pro career, playing in two Stanley Cup finals as a member of the Anaheim Mighty Ducks. \nHe played for the U.S Olympic team in 1992 and 1994. \nPacioretty could not be at the event because his season is in full swing. \nHe played at New Canaan High School before transferring to Taft. He continued his career at the University of Michigan before being drafted by the Canadiens in the first round of the 2007 draft, \nPacioretty won the Bill Masterton Award in 2012 as the NHL player that exemplifies the qualities of perseverance, sportsmanship, and dedication to ice hockey. He played for the U.S. National team in the 2014 Olympics and was named captain of the Canadiens this past offseason. \nThe James O’Rourke Amateur Wing of the Hall inducted Lisa Brummel of Westport and Lambert Shell of Bridgeport. \nBrummel was one of the county's top female athletes as a four-sport standout at Staples High, earning All-FCIAC or All-State honors basketball, softball, track and field hockey from 1974-77. \nBrummel was all-Ivy in basketball each of her four years there, still in the top five in several school offensive categories and was Ivy League MVP when Yale won the title in 1979. She also played three seasons as a catcher with the Raybestos Brakettes (1976-78), winning national titles each year. \nShe is now one of the owners of the WNBA 's Seattle Storm . \nShell was one of the greatest basketball players in University of Bridgeport history as a three-time All-American. He scored 3,001 career points and had over 1,300 rebounds in leading the Purple Knights to Division II Final Fours and two national runner-up finishes in 1991 and ’92. \nShell said he never thought he would one day be going into a Hall of Fame, he just played basketball because he loved it. \n“This is a very nice honor and it is really unexpected,” Shell said. “I never thought about any accolades with basketball I just played because I loved to play, but I never thought I’d get some of the honors I got over the years. It is nice that 20 years and 80 pounds later things are still rolling in.” \nShell also had a pro career from 1992-2005 in the USBL, CBA and in Europe. \nInducted into the J. Walter Kennedy Community Service Wing were Jack Kvancz of Bridgeport and Angela Tammaro of Greenwich. \nKvancz was highly successful both on and off the basketball court, but his accomplishments as an administrator and coach are why he was inducted Monday. \nThe Bridgeport native and Harding High basketball standout began his coaching career with a three-year stint at Masuk High. He then moved into the collegiate ranks as an assistant coach at Brown before becoming head basketball coach and athletic director at Catholic University from 1974-82. His next stop was leading the athletic department for 12 years at George Mason . In 1994, Kvancz became the AD at George Washington and concluded his 17 years there in 2011. \nIn 2014, Tammaro concluded her legendary coaching career at Greenwich Academy after 49 years as the school's field hockey coach and 48 as lacrosse coach, while also being the athletic director for four decades. \nTammaro said her greatest joy was in teaching the game to student-athletes, but being recognized for her accomplishments is nice, too. \n“It is quite an honor and it is nice to be recognized where you work, locally,” Tammaro said. “I miss working with the girls and I always loved the game day coaching. It’s always a challenge making in-game adjustments and I always found that part of coaching the most challenging but also the most fun.” \nTammaro finished with 746 wins in field hockey and 700 in lacrosse, the most of any female coach in the country. Her teams racked up 30 consecutive league titles in field hockey and 28 total in lacrosse. \nAlso honored were Fairfield’s Giacomo Brancato with the Chelsea Cohen Courage Award; Leo Motyka , Bob Ritzert and Len Gambino with the Bill Gonillo Local Sports Media Award as well as the Sportspersons of the Year from local communities. \nScott.Ericson@scni.com; @EricsonSports", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T05:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T16:06:01.505+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
