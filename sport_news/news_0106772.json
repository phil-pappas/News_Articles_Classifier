United’s Natalie Johnson, Addison McKee and Lauren Sperry took center stage Wednesday on Senior Night in a 25-16, 23-25 and 26-24 loss to a tough Southeastern team. “They are going to be missed,” said United coach Carrie Boone, about her three seniors. “The good thing is that this will not be their last match played here at United with regionals next week. Our defense looked great and I told the girls we finished the (regular) season at 30-5 and all of our losses were to really good teams.” Sperry had another solid match in the front row with 9 kills, 2 blocks and 3 aces. Junior Mallory Flynn also had 23 assists for the Red Storm. United also closed out the regular season with a 9-1 mark to win the Lincoln Trail Conference. Southeastern (29-3), led by 5-11 junior Kolby McClellund was a perfect tuneup before going into regionals next week. McClellund, at times, took the match over with her jump serves and play at the net. “Coming in, we knew it was going to be a great volleyball match with two great programs. We’ve really developed a good rivalry. We knew they had a great record and a great team. They play hard and are very well-coached. This is one that we wanted going into our postseason. It was a battle and felt like whoever got the final serve was going to win.” About the play of McClelland, Kerr said, “Without question, she’s the best player I’ve coached in my 18 or 19 years. As a junior, she’s been getting some Division I looks and has been our go-to player. We haven’t found too many people who can stop her.” The second set featured ties at 7, 13, 15, 17, 18, 21, 22, and 23 before the Red Storm won it. The third and decisive set, though, saw United watch a 22-20 slip away. United will host the regional next week and return to the court on Tuesday at 6 p.m. against the winner of West Central and Abingdon-Avon. Lewistown def. Knoxville 25-21, 23-25, 25-20 At Lewistown, Knoxville forced a third match after recovering from a first set loss but could not pull out the win. Chloe Palmer hammered 10 kills and four blocks to lead the Blue Bullets. Emily Lenz made seven digs and Bailee Case gave out 10 assists also for Knoxville.
