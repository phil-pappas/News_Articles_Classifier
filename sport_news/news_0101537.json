The Tigers scored 24 consecutive points from that point and didn’t trail from there. \nNkemdiche went through concussion protocol throughout this week. Rebels head coach Hugh Freeze said Wednesday evening that Nkemdiche had one portion to pass Thursday morning in order to play against the Aggies. \nBreeland Speaks started in Nkemdiche's place. \nThe junior has 17 tackles (5.5 for a loss) and 1.5 sacks on defense and three touchdowns (two rushing, one passing) on offense. \nContact Daniel Paulling at dpaulling@jackson.gannett.com.
