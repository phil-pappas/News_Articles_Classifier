I've got a lot to thank him for.\" \nFormer Yorkshire and England captain and long-standing team-mate Ray Illingworth was visibly choked as he paid his respects. \nIllingworth told Press Association Sport: \"A lot of people say Brian was a hard man and things like that, but really he was a softy at heart you know. \n\"He could be hard on the cricket field, but he could do a good turn for anybody and as far as I'm concerned, well he was my best man. \n\"He was also godfather to my eldest daughter. That's the sort of bloke he was for me. It's a sad day. \n\"We go back a long way. There won't be another like him. It's been shown by a wonderful turnout and the tributes. I think it's tremendous.\" \nFormer Test umpire Dickie Bird OBE told Press Association Sport: \"It was a wonderful service with some wonderful tributes. \n\"It was nice to see Sir Ian Botham come all the way from Scotland to be here. It just shows the respect he had for Brian Close. \n\"Brian was a tremendous captain and a wonderful man. I shall miss him and feel for his wife Viv and all her family. \n\"He was a hard man, believe me, but a good man.\" \nClose's international career spanned 27 years, but took in only 22 Tests, and he was unbeaten on the seven occasions he captained his country. \nHe led Yorkshire to four County Championship titles in the 1960s before moving on to Somerset, and hit almost 35,000 first-class runs.
