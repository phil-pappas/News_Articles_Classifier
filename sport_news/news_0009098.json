White forced a fumble with one arm in West Mesquite's 20-0 loss to Rockwall-Heath. Using timed blitzes, White was able to quickly get into the backfield for three tackles for losses.\nWho is he? A 5-11, 180-pound senior, middle linebacker.\nThe stats: 13 tackles, 10 assists, three tackles for loss and one forced fumble.\nHe said it: \"Honestly, after the game, I asked my coach. I said, 'Coach, I don't know what happened [when I forced the fumble], but I know something happened. I came up for the tackle, and my shoulder is injured, so I can't really wrap up on my left arm, so I just tried to wrap up with my right arm and ... I actually hit the ball out.\"\nCoach said it: \"He plays fast and takes on blocks quick through the blitz, and it allows him to make tackles for a loss. The other part of it is he plays fast and with depth, too. He's got as good a closing speed as anybody we've had. And he's very explosive when he gets there, he doesn't miss many tackles.\" -- Jeff Neill\nDid you know? White is playing with a pinched nerve in his left shoulder, so he's only been tackling with one arm. After recording eight tackles in Week 7, White's coach told him he needed to work on his form, so White spent the entire week practicing how to better tackle opponents with just his right arm.\nHonorable mention\nPlayer School Cl.
