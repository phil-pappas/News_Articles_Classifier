He is the youngest player since Tiger Woods (21) to win the Jack Nicklaus Award as player of the year. Spieth also won the Arnold Palmer Award by topping the money list with a record $12 million, and the Vardon Trophy for the lowest adjusted scoring average. \nAlso Friday, Daniel Berger was voted rookie of the year. He was the only rookie to qualify for the Tour Championship. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T19:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T19:26:39.825+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
