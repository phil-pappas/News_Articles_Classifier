(Julie Bennett/jbennett@al.com)\nLashlee said the competition is \"healthy\" and believes both quarterbacks will benefit in the long run.\n\"I think it makes both of them better regardless of what we do,\" Lashlee said. \"The best thing about those two guys, and I've been fortunate since I've been here – it was the same with Nick (Marshall) and Jeremy – they get along great. They're still good buddies.\"\nWhoever the starter is this week will take the reins of an offense that's struggling to produce in many facets of the passing game. Auburn's 153.8 passing yards per game ranks 13th in the SEC and 113th in the FBS and a lack of deep passes is particularly troubling to Malzahn.\nRELATED: Auburn hopes to build off most explosive performance of season\nThere is no plan for a two-quarterback system though. Whoever starts will likely play the whole game, barring injury or if the coaches decide to make an in-game switch they've been reluctant to make thus far.\n\"I think always the plan is to stick with the guy you start a game (with),\" Lashlee said, \"because hopefully that means you are doing well.\"\n Auburn offensive coordinator Rhett Lashlee: Oct. 11, 2015 Auburn offensive coordinator Rhett Lashlee talks with the media after practice Sunday, Oct. 11, 2015, in Auburn, Ala.
