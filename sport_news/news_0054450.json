The First Ever NBA Alternate Court!!Four Nights Only. #FearTheDeer More at http://t.co/DwfNZJ8Tc2 pic.twitter.com/HWOkuNhkQX \n— Milwaukee Bucks (@Bucks) October 3, 2015 \nAs part of their “Fear the Deer” rebranding efforts, the Bucks introduced a set of alternate uniforms for the 2015/16 season. Not only that, but those uniforms come with an alternate court design, according to an official release by the team : \nWith the addition of a second court, the Bucks are now the first team in the NBA to feature an alternate court design to complement the alternate uniform. The Fear the Deer court shares the same design philosophy as the new uniforms, with the logos and color palette stripped down to keep the focus squarely on the team. \n— Milwaukee Bucks (@Bucks) October 3, 2015 \nIt seems a bit odd to create an entirely new court design that will only be used four times over the entire season, but the court and the uniforms are both pretty good looking. Naturally, they’ll be put to use in four of Milwaukee’s most high profile home games against the Lakers, Clippers, Thunder, and division rival Bulls, the team that eliminated them from last year’s playoffs. The look won’t matter much if Milwaukee can’t keep the on-court momentum going, but if they can play well, they’re well positioned to be a franchise on the upswing.
