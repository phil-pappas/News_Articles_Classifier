The Eagles led just 18-12 at the half and committed three turnovers before righting the ship in the second half and finishing with a 39-12 victory on Senior Night and Homecoming. West Craven platooned both Darious Abrams and Jarred Arthur at quarterback with success from both guys, especially in the second half. “We’ve got to get back to playing our style of football and I don’t feel like we have done that since Richlands,” West Craven coach Matt Riggsbee said. “My hat is off to West Carteret though, I have a lot of respect for Coach Barrow and their team.” Arthur threw for 95 yards and two touchdowns and Abrams ran for 161 and two scores. Riggsbee said he looks positively at having two guys at the quarterback position who do different things when in the game. “It’s a luxury to have that,” he said. “I think Jarred did some things great and he could start for any team in our conference and Debo (Abrams) did some things great for us too.” Abrams also caught a touchdown pass from Arthur, his lone reception of the game. Peejay Thompson added a rushing touchdown from 20 yards out on a jet sweep and Jaylen Franks caught the other score from Arthur. Defensively, the Eagles surrendered just six points, as West Carteret scored its first touchdown on a scoop-and-score fumble recovery. Claron Mims led the Eagle charge on that side of the ball. “When we were struggling, I just told the guys to not argue and just play football and they wasn’t going to beat us,” he said. “I was just in pursuit, doing what we work on in practice and reading my tackle and getting to the ball and stopping the run.” Riggsbee also praised his junior pass-rusher. “Claron played awesome tonight,” Riggsbee said. “He was also like another assistant coach over there for me tonight. He was a true leader.” West Craven committed 13 penalties for 130 yards, an area where Riggsbee said the main focus will be next week in practice. “We have to be mentally tougher and not do those types of things,” he said. “We have to stay in the game and not let things get in our head like that.” Page 2 of 2 - West Craven improves to 7-1 (3-1 Coastal 3A) and is on the road at 3-6 White Oak next week. The Patriots fall to 2-7, 1-3 and are off next week.
