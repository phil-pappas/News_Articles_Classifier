The problem, at least as far as Pontiac was concerned, was that it was the night to honor the Indians playing their final prep match at home. Yes, the Hawks spoiled Senior Night at PTHS with a 25-11, 25-22 victory in Corn Belt Conference play Thursday. “We played like a team and everything clicked,” PC head coach Jean Krippel said of the Hawks. “I told them we only have a couple games left so go out and have fun; don’t worry about winning or losing. They just played the sport that they love and it showed.” There was fun aplenty on the side of the navy-clad Hawks. There was a confidence and an attitude that exuded from the ladies from the moment they took the floor for warm-ups. Prairie Central had lost to Pontiac earlier in the season in Fairbury and the idea of payback must have been on the mind of the Hawks as they went through their pregame routine and launched into a display of volleyball mastery during the match. “Everyone knew their role and they were doing what they were supposed to be doing,” Krippel said. “We were scrappy on defense, we were where we were supposed to be, I couldn’t ask for a better team (effort).” Prairie Central’s start to the match showed how much the Hawks were happy to get a shot at retribution. Maddie Krenz, the 6-foot-3 senior from Chenoa who attended grade school at St. Mary’s, delivered a kill on the first play. A mistake by the Indians made it 2-0. Kylie Vogel, the Hawks’ other middle power swinger, had back-to-back kills to give Prairie Central a 7-5 lead. The successful attacks triggered a six-point run that put PC in the driver’s seat. “We started out cold, we’ve been doing that the last few weeks,” PTHS head coach Stephanie Smithson said. The Indians got behind early but did manage to forge a couple of ties and a lead change. There were four ties and two lead changes altogether in the opening game — all in a seven-serve run. Ashley Harfst, one of the seven Pontiac seniors recognized before the match, served an ace to give the Tribe a 3-2 lead. Cassie Einhaus added a kill that made it a 4-3 game. But the Hawks took control and outscored PTHS 19-6 from Vogel’s two scoring attacks to the end of the set. Prairie Central got kills from Vogel, Olivia Weber, Krenz and Annaliese Miller in closing out the victory. Page 2 of 3 - Grace Watson had a couple of kills for the Indians, who were simply overwhelmed in the opener. It looked as if second set was going to be over just as quickly. The Hawks, after spotting PTHS the first point, went on a 7-1 run that forced a timeout by Smithson. The last two points of the surge came from aces off the net from a pair of Weber serves. It was that bugaboo of serve receive that has had Smithson pulling out her hair. But Pontiac was not got going to give in so easily. It was, after all, Senior Night. PTHS progressively got back into the match. When Vogel launched a long attack, the Indians had come back to tie it at 10-10. Another Weber kill made it 13-10 for PC, but the Tribe responded. Meghan Heller, another one of Pontiac’s Senior Six, recorded a fierce block off a Miller hit and followed it up with a hit that the Hawks failed to return. This made it 13-13. It was 14-14 when Heller made another crowd-pleasing stuff of a PC attack to give the Indians the lead. A Watson attack made it 16-14. Although it was a night where the final-year players were honored, it was Prairie Central making the right plays at the right times. Krenz had back-to-back kills and added another on a tip as PC took an 18-16 lead. Another Krenz kill broke an 18-18 tie. Pontiac was leading 21-20 and had the serve when disaster struck — the first time. Maddie Wright’s serve sailed long for the game’s ninth tie. Watson got a kill for a sideout and a 22-21 PTHS advantage. But another disastrous serve gave the Hawks the ball. This time it was Miranda Fitzsimmons, the senior defensive queen for the Tribe, who sent the ball into the net, giving a gleeful Prairie Central team the ball. This time the Hawks closed it out. A long attack from the PTHS side and a Weber kill helped close out the match. “I’m glad they fought back and played hard,” Smithson said. “Serves hurt us that second game, especially when it’s a two-point game. “The good news is we have them in regionals in a couple of weeks.” Pontiac and Prairie Central will meet for a third time when they square off in the first match of the Class 3A Washington Regional on Oct. 26. Weber had 6 kills and Krenz added 6 for the Hawks. Sadie Ropp had 9 assists and 9 service points. Faith Bachtold came up with 14 digs. Harfst served up 7 points and had 11 assists for the Indians. Watson recorded 5 kills and Fitzsimmons had 8 digs. Heller had 2 blocks. Page 3 of 3 - Prairie Central won the sophomore match 25-21, 23-25, 15-8. Elle Giovanini had 9 points for PTHS.
