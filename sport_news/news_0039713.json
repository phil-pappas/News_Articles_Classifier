(AP) - Isiaha Smith ran for 74 yards and three scores, and Dominique Allen added 166 yards rushing and a touchdown to lead The Citadel to a 44-25 win over Samford on Saturday. \nVinny Miller chipped in with 68 yards on nine carries and an 8-yard scoring run, which put The Citadel (4-2, 3-0 Southern Conference) in front, 14-7, for good. \nThe Citadel defense forced four three-and-outs and four turnovers. \nJust 19 seconds after Smith’s second touchdown, Mark Thomas had a strip-sack of Michael Eubank, which DeVonta Delaney returned 25 yards to give The Citadel a 35-14 lead with 37 seconds left in the second quarter. \nOn the first drive of the second half, Delaney picked off a Eubanks pass and seven play later, Smith scored his third touchdown and Samford (3-3, 1-2) trailed by at least three scores the rest of the way. \nKarel Hamilton had 15 receptions for 220 yards - both career highs - and a score for Samford. \nCopyright © 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T02:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T03:25:40.112+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
