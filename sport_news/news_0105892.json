They’re good. They’re very good. They’re not Trevone Boykin good. \nIowa State needs immediate change, and I’m not referring to a mid-season replacement of the head coach right now. If athletics director Jamie Pollard was going to do that, presumably he’d have done it during the off week. \nBeyond fans calling for coaches immediately to be canned and starters to be replaced, there’s a lot of work to be done inside the football complex for the Cyclones to even be respectable on Saturday. Like what happened to the tight ends? And how about a few tosses down field where speedy receivers can do their stuff? \nTexas Tech did it. Others do it, too. It's time Iowa State joins in on this fun. Nothing else seems to be working in that aspect of the offense. \nWhat happened to the passing game? \nThis Sam Richardson-led passing attack hasn’t even come close to living up to expectations. \nVeteran receivers, a veteran quarterback, and experienced offensive linemen have not translated to what everyone thought it would. Nothing is going to change, however, from a personnel standpoint. \nCoach Paul Rhoads said after Saturday’s game that Richardson will continue to start. He’s not confident just yet using Joel Lanning in an extended passing role, and Grant Rohach hasn’t even played this season. \n“(Lanning) hasn’t had a chance to really go out there and run the offense,” Rhoads said. \nSo it’s all-Sam — until Lanning becomes comfortable running the team. Peterson: Save for Warren, nothing works for Cyclones \nMike Warren’s next step is ... \n“I don’t know. I don’t really know,” the redshirt freshman said after rushing for 245 yards on 23 carries Saturday. “I guess you can just keep going up from here.” \nIowa State rushed for 315 yards against the Big 12’s worst rush defense Saturday, the most for the Cyclones in a game since getting 368 against the Red Raiders in 2011. \nTCU, Saturday’s opponent, is giving up 183.0 rushing yards a game, so it could be another big one for Warren. \n“I feel like this game truly showed that we can run the ball,” said Warren, who needs to average 60.9 rushing yards a game over the remainder of the season to become Iowa State’s first 1,000-yard rusher since Alexander Robinson’s 1,195 in 2009. \nThey better run it well, because Iowa State is getting nothing from the other piece of the offense. And speaking of Allen Lazard highlight-reel catches ... \nHe needs more touches. Just saying. Mike Warren delivers another historic ISU performance \nIt’s everyone, including the place-kicker \nRhoads probably was just messing with Cole Netten’s mind, trying to motivate his once-solid place-kicker by saying that role is now open to anyone who has a good week of practice. \nBut you heard it here first — Netten isn’t losing his job. \nAs inconsistent as he has been throughout this 2-3 season, Netten still is the best on Iowa State’s campus, and anyhow, Rhoads wasn’t exactly enamored by replacement Chris Francis’ PAT effort late in Saturday’s game. \n“It was an awful kick, by the way,” Rhoads said. ISU status report: Struggles key Red Raiders rout \nHere come the Big 12 favorites \nIf Texas Tech was the (alleged) easiest among Iowa State’s run of games against three of the nation’s top offenses, then what can be in store when TCU comes to town? \nHere’s a hint: Cover your eyes, if you’re a Cyclones fan. \n“On paper, the next two offenses are better than this one,” Rhoads said after the Red Raiders amassed a school-record 776 yards Saturday. \nThe Horned Frogs are 6-0 record after rallying late to beat Kansas State 52-45 on Saturday. The Cyclones don’t stand much of a chance of winning this game, anyway, but there’s no chance without fixing everything that went wrong Saturday. \n“We have to play better perimeter run and pass defense,” Rhoads said. “That’s our outside linebackers, cornerbacks and safeties. Those are the guys on alert when those plays occur. \n“We have to get off blocks better, and we have to tackle with urgency and immediacy. The speed and pace isn’t going to slow down the next two weeks.” \nCyclone sports columnist Randy Peterson has been reporting on ISU during the past five decades. Follow @RandyPete.
