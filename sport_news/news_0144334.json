LOUIS -- The Cubs made only one tweak to their roster from the wild-card game to the National League division series. They took speedy outfielder Quinton Berry off the roster and replaced him with pitcher Jason Hammel, who may start Game 4, if the series goes that far.\nThat gives the Cubs a roster of 14 position players and 11 pitchers.\nrelated advertisement \"It probably comes down to an extra pitcher versus him,\" manager Joe Maddon said of Berry. \"And we chose to do it this way. I miss the thought of him being on the bench, but we have other guys with similar skill set regarding running or stealing bases.\"\nKyle Schwarber started in right field with Chris Coghlan in left. Maddon was asked if Jorge Soler would see action. Soler was on the disabled list from Aug. 24-Sept. 17 because of an oblique strain. Soler walked as a pinch hitter in the ninth inning of the Cubs' 4-0 loss to the Cardinals.\n\"His attitude has been fabulous,\" Maddon said. \"He's staying ready. He's been a great teammate. He knows what's at stake. You'll see him out there at some point.\"\nPlaying in Peoria, and elsewhere: Joe Maddon spent part of his pregame media session charming the St. Louis media as well as media members from Peoria.\n\"Mr. Vonachen, Pete, and I were really good buddies,\" Maddon said, referring to time spent in Class A ball at Peoria. \"Pete was the owner of the ballclub there in Peoria. I was never treated so well in the minor leagues as I was treated by the Vonachen family. Gave me a really nice car to drive, put me in Guy Hoffman's house. Guy Hoffman was a pitcher at that time, I think with the White Sox.\n\"I lived in Guy's pad during the summer, but Peoria, I have nothing but warm fuzzies, about his wife, Donna. I mean Pete just passed away recently. I've never been treated so well.\"\nThere was more.\n\"Steak 'n Shake was my favorite, and the butterfly pork chop sandwich from Rocky's,\" Maddon said. \"So there's all these things, Vonachen's Junction, all that stuff about Peoria, really, really very dear to my heart, but it was all based on the Vonachen family, and primarily Pete.\n\"I like 'takhomasak' (Steak 'n Shake theme). I mean, first of all, who came up with that? That's pure genius. Just a regular double, double with everything. There is one not far now from my home in Tampa, so late night when you're in trouble, just go take home a sack. The fries are fabulous, too. I can't do the milkshakes. I'm lactose intolerant, although at the time when I was younger, I used to challenge that component, and I always lost.\"\nThis and that: Cubs catcher David Ross said he was OK after getting hit on the mask with a foul ball early. The team's athletic trainer came out and looked at Ross, but he was able to complete the game behind the plate … Addison Russell has hit safely in both of the Cubs' postseason games. He singled in the sixth inning and stole second base … The Cubs were shut out for the fourth time in the postseason in team history. Before Friday, the last time it happened was Oct. 12, 2003 at Florida (Josh Beckett in Game 5 of the NLCS).\nRelated Article\nLackey, home runs too much for Chicago Cubs Get great articles like this sent to your inbox!
