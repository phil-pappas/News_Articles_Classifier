She was just tickled, jumping up and down.\"\nThe little girl who dreamed about one day learning to play piano could now resume that quest. When doctors told Lily's parents last February that their youngest child had acute lymphoblastic leukemia with the Philadelphia chromosome mutation, all dreams were pushed to the back-burner as the family shifted into survival mode.\nPiano lessons were not for sick children low on energy and whose parents were already stretched thin in the time, money and commitment departments.\nOr were they?\n\"Lily enjoys it. It's soothing for her. I don't know how to play, but, I feel like it's soothing for me too,\" Heather said.\nSo far, Lily's had six lessons, most of them on a keyboard until the piano arrived last week, but her teacher, Al Nichols, said, \"She knocked my socks off the first time she played on the piano. I didn't expect that. She was OK on the keyboard but on the piano, wow.\"\nThe piano, a black baby grand which still sports the surprise bow, was donated to the Cordova family by Cordogan's Pianoland in Geneva.\nIn a serendipitous series of events, orchestrated by Heather's best friend, Jenny Marcucci, the Cordovas were introduced to Nichols, a highly regarded teacher, just weeks before John and Diane Cordogan, brother and sister co-owners of Pianoland, learned of the situation and offered to donate the piano.\nNichols' mother recently died of cancer. His son, 40, is currently battling melanoma. He said he was compelled to offer his services free of charge.\n\"I know what she's going through,\" Nichols said. \"I'd do it for more kids if I had the time.\"\nNichols says he specializes in meeting each student where they are. He's taught a deaf boy, a blind man and a partially paralyzed student. Right now, he's teaching a man to play the first movement of Beethoven's \"Moonlight Sonata.\"\n\"Playing piano is one of the most comforting things you can do,\" he said. \"It's satisfying when you play a tune well.\"\nAnd, it turns out, Nichols, of Markham, used to work with the Cordogans, when they had a shop in Orland Park.\n\"Al's a great guy, a great teacher,\" Cordogan said. \"All of this seemed to come full circle.\"\nThere are other South Side coincidences, as well.\nCordogan plays in a band called Too White Crew, which performed at a fundraiser for Emily Beazley, a 12-year-old Mount Greenwood girl who died last May of cancer. When he learned that another little girl from the South Side needed help, he vowed to do what he could.\n\"It pulled at the heartstrings,\" he said.\nThe piano, he said, has a value of about $6,000, including tax and delivery.\n\"We like to donate when we can, but that's usually only once or twice a year,\" he said. \"And even though they were only asking for an upright, I was in a unique position to donate a baby grand, so that's what we did.\"\nCordogan said he likes to reward initiative and compassion. After Hurricane Katrina devastated New Orleans, he donated a piano to a teenage girl who reached out to him because she'd lost her piano in the storm and was looking for a replacement so she could continue to give lessons to special needs kids.\n\"More important in this case,\" he said, \"is bringing attention to Lily's go fund me page.\"\nBack in February, then 5-year-old Lily started running a low grade fever and complaining that her legs hurt. Her appetite also waned. The last straw, Heather said, was when she began heading straight to bed for a nap following her half-day of kindergarten.\nAt first doctors thought her leg pain could be due to flat-footedness and that her fever might be attributable to a virus. It was still flu season, after all.\nBut when her fever spiked to 104 one day and her legs hurt so much she could barely walk, Heather took Lily to the Loyola Emergency Room and blood was drawn.\nThirty minutes later a nurse came in and told Heather, \"A hematologist oncologist is going to come talk to you.\"\n\"I was like 'What?' I'm was familiar with what that meant. I said, 'She's anemic, right?' The nurse said, 'Yes.' Then I panicked and called my husband, who was on his way but wanted to stop at Toys R Us to get her something.\"\nWhen Danny Cordova, an electrician, got there, Heather burst into tears. \"I told him, 'Something's wrong with her. It's gonna be something serious.'\"\nThe oncologist told them Lily had leukemia and that she'd have to be admitted to start treatment the next day.\nThe bloodwork was sent out for more tests and about a week later, the Cordovas learned their daughter had a rare subtype of the disease known as PH+ALL, acute lymphoblastic leukemia with the Philadelphia chromosome mutation.\n\"That's a mutation of chromosomes 9 and 22. They swap places and start to mimic the other,\" she said.\nThe condition is found in only 3 to 5 percent of kids with leukemia, said Dr. Eugene Suh, a pediatric hematologist oncologist with Loyola University Medical Center.\nWhile the cure rate for ALL is high, Heather said, for kids with the subtype, the prognosis is uncertain.\n\"There's not a lot of research on this subtype,\" she said. She is being treated with a second generation of a drug but there are no long-term studies, she said. \"But they're saying they're seeing more success with it. Kids are staying in remission longer. But it's so new, they don't know the long-term effects. So much research that still needs to be done.\n\"The nice thing is they know what it is and they're treating it,\" said Heather, who left her full-time job with Alexian Bros. Foundation to be able to stay with Lily. \"We're all really optimistic that's she's gonna get through it.\"\nSuh said there is a targetable medicine to treat this condition. Increasingly, he said, pediatric research is focused on chromosomal changes that just may be the cause of some diseases. He also said regardless of where a patient is treated, all research finds its way into the same pool.\n\"All of the children's hospitals and researchers and patients banding together are improving cure rates and revolutionizing the way kids are treated,\" he said. \"Lily is contributing to that and benefiting from that especially with her specific type of leukemia.\"\nSuh said the donation of the piano is a true gift for Lily.\n\"Any way to give them a little bit of normalcy in their lives — we took everything away from them, going to school, playing with friends, going out to eat,\" he said. \"It's been hard so anything that can give them a little of normalcy, a little bit of hope and joy is good.\"\nLily's had seven months of chemotherapy, the first was the hardest, Heather said. She wasn't able to walk and mouth sores made eating and administering oral medications a challenge.\nAt the hospital, she said, there are kids who spend their days alone because their single parent has to go to work. \"To walk down the halls in the hospital and see through an open door a small child in there by himself, It's just heartbreaking,\" she said. \"I tell nurses, can we just bring him or her in our room. I'll help take care of both. I can imagine how hard it must be for that parent.\n\"It's definitely put my life in perspective. What's important, what's not. Family comes first. I'm also learning the good that people do. How they'll go above and beyond in a crisis,\" she said.\nShe is most grateful, however, that Lily is doing better. She's hopeful her daughter will enter the \"maintenance phase\" of treatment in November, enabling her to return to school. For now, a first grade teacher from Columbus Manor visits twice a week to give home school lessons.\n\"The school has been so supportive,\" Heather said.\nLooking back on her family's rough road through 2015, Heather said, she is grateful to have experienced so much kindness. \"There really are a lot of good people out there,\" she said.\n\"To see Lily now, the way she is, is like, 'thank you.' She's come a long, long way,\" she said.\nFar enough to begin weekly piano lessons, except for the weeks that she is in treatment.\nLily tires easily, so about 20 minutes is her limit when learning how to play, her mom said. \"She's still on numbers but Al says she'll be on notes soon.\"\nThe piano, Heather said, \"is beautiful. John and Diane went above and beyond.\"\nHeather said when the piano arrived, 7-year-old Ciara said to her sister, \"Oh my goodness, Lily, you've got your own piano. Can you share it with me?\"\nThe whole family wants to take lessons now, Heather said.\n\"You hear bad things on the news. You hear people complain day and night about this or that. And here is proof there are also really good people,\" Heather said. \"And when you're going through a rough time, they really rally around you.\"\nPerhaps the person most impressed by the kindness of others is Heather's friend Marcucci. They met 10 years ago while both were working at Loyola University Medical Center and have been best friends ever since.\n\"I have a disabled child so I know what it's like to have a special child, with special needs,\" she said. \"Lily and Ciara call me their fairy Godmother.\"\nIllness, Marcucci said, can happen to anyone.\n\"Lily has adjusted to her new normal,\" Marcucci said. \"She has been so brave, such a trooper.\"\nAnd now, she can also be a musician.\ndvickroy@tribpub\n@dvickroy\nCopyright © 2015, Daily Southtown Medical Research Cancer Leukemia Cancer Loyola University Chicago Loyola University New Orleans", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-56213030/turbine/ct-sta-piano-donation-child-cancer-st-1016-20151016"], "published": "2015-10-16T19:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T21:21:30.009+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
