The defensive end-turned-outside linebacker downed Alex Smith with 21 seconds left in the first half.\n“Felt great,” Young said. “It’s been a while. Being the ice-breaker for me, just how far I’ve come since Week 15 last year.”\nYoung ruptured his left Achilles in the Bears’ penultimate 2014 game.\n“To know I still got it,” Young said. “It’s a matter of consistency now.”\nCam-do\nWith two starting receivers out, Cameron Meredith became one of Jay Cutler’s fourth-quarter targets. In a span of three snaps, the rookie caught a 20-yard pass and then got out of bounds after a 10-yarder.\n“Big plays had to be made, certain people had to step up,” he said.\nThe Illinois State and Westchester St. Joseph’s alum said he couldn’t think about growing up a Bears fan.\n“I gotta block all that out,” he said. “At the end of the day it’s just football. Bigger stage. Bigger lights.”\nTulane\nMatt Forte thought Cairo Santos would miss a 66-yard field try as time expired. But Tulane pride made him think twice, even if the NFL record is 64 yards, set by Matt Prater two years ago.\n“I knew he was one of the lone Tulane NFL alumni, so I was like, ‘Don’t doubt him,’” Forte said. “Because we don’t have many in the NFL, but those guys that are, are pretty good. I was just hoping that he didn’t make it.”\nFollow me on Twitter @patrickfinley\nEmail: pfinley@suntimes.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T03:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T03:50:07.225+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
