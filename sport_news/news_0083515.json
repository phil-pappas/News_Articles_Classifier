(Photo: Matthew Emmons, USA TODAY Sports)\n2 CONNECT 1 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE IRVING, Texas — The Dallas Cowboys switched gears at quarterback this week, but that move may only provide a marginal boost to a sputtering offense unless they can address a host of issues elsewhere.\n\"It's a reflection of the whole offense,\" quarterbacks coach Wade Wilson said of the unit's problems amid a three-game losing streak that sent quarterback Brandon Weeden back to the bench in favor of recently acquired veteran Matt Cassel, who is expected to provide a boost until Tony Romo can return from his broken collarbone.\n\"It's not all dumped on Brandon. We've had penalties, we've had dropped balls, we've had a myriad of things that have happened on offense.\"\nUSA TODAY SPORTS WIRE\nUSA TODAY Sports' Week 6 NFL picks\nStart with the line, which has underwhelmed after being widely touted as the league's best entering the season. Running backs have had a difficult time finding holes.\n\"As a unit, we are still working to improve on a lot of the little things,\" center Travis Frederick said. \"I think we are good at a lot of things. ... And there are some things we have to continue to improve. Some things you get better at, and then it stresses another area. Then you work at that. You have to continue to tweak.\"\nRookie La'el Collins will start in place of Ron Leary at left guard when the Cowboys visit the New York Giants on Oct. 25 following their bye week. Collins was viewed as a surefire first rounder in the spring, but he went undrafted while police in Louisiana probed the murder of his former girlfriend. He signed with the Cowboys after it was clear Collins was not a target of the investigation. Now he'll be asked to help improve a bolster -ranked rushing attack after Leary struggled while nursing nagging injures.\nUSA TODAY\nNFL Junkies podcast: Brady, Patriots finally get their shot at Colts\nCollins is embracing the chance to show his potential.\n\"No question,\" he said. \"Definitely the start of showing I'm becoming the player I want to be.\"\nOpponents consistently dropped a safety into the box last year to combat the run, but the Cowboys — with the help of now-departed tailback DeMarco Murray — still churned out the second-most yards on the ground league-wide. Now they're seeing similar defensive looks but have struggled to take advantage. Frank Pollack, the offensive line coach, said the way to combat that is \"persistence and execution.\"\nIt's clear that the Cowboys (2-3) have sorely missed Murray, who joined the Philadelphia Eagles after leading the NFL in rushing in 2014. Dallas is currently averaging 106.2 yards per game on the ground, more than 40 yards off last year's weekly pace. Their 20.2 points per game rank 22nd, a full touchdown off their 2014 production.\nUSA TODAY\nArmour: Small acts of kindness blocked by NFL\n\"Anytime you have a great player like that, you miss him,\" running backs coach Gary Brown said of Murray. \"But I think we have enough guys here to make up for those yards.\"\nThe significance of losing versatile back Lance Dunbar, who suffered a season-ending knee injury against the New Orleans Saints on Oct. 4, can't be overstated. But coach Jason Garrett maintained that Joseph Randle, who has started every game, would remain the primary option. Darren McFadden will also continue to see action. Physical Christine Michael, acquired last month in a trade with the Seattle Seahawks, will get more opportunities after carrying the ball just twice for 5 yards in two games.\n\"He can do more things,\" Brown said. \"I think the thing is, he had to learn it. He had to feel comfortable with it. I think he's where he needs to be. We are going to take the reins off and let him rock.\"\nUSA TODAY\nSeahawks' varied problems create sinking feeling\nBut the Cowboys won't be able to run consistently unless opponents respect their passing game. Wilson said Weeden was trying to be too careful at times even though, for the most part, he followed the game plan.\nTight end Jason Witten is providing his typical steady numbers (30 catches for 271 yards) but hasn't scored since Romo and all-pro wideout Dez Bryant went down.\nGarrett said the other receivers need to do a better job of getting open. In his last three games, Terrance Williams has five catches for 79 yards. With Bryant likely still a few weeks away, Williams, like the rest of his teammates, needs to do more.\nBut he doesn't seem worried even with the Cowboys now a game behind the Giants in the NFC East standings.\n\"There's no panic here,\" said Williams.\n***\nFollow Eric Prisbell on Twitter @EricPrisbell\nPHOTOS: Week 6 games ranked by watchability\n NFL Week 6 games ranked by watchability\n14.
