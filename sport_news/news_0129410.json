With Will Genia rapid around the breakdown, the Wallabies were quickly leaping forward and only Mitchell's missed catch two yards out prevented them scoring after five minutes. \nSeymour was to blame though as Australia did touchdown five minutes later as he darted out from his line looking to smash Kuridrani but the centre brushed him off before slipping Ashley-Cooper in to score. Foley dragged the conversion wide. \nThe Dark Blues hit back with a Greig Laidlaw penalty and that was the spark they needed. T hey got a helping hand though when Australia switched off entirely at a ruck five yards from their own line, allowing the alert Horne to skip through a gaping hole to put his side ahead. \nLaidlaw added the extras and then a penalty as Scotland stepped things up. But they should have capitalised further when Finn Russell pinched a Kuridrani pass. Bennett, though, dropped the ball with the Aussie flank exposed. \nIt was an expensive spill as Australia went through a dozen composed phases before whipping it wide for Mitchell to dive over. Again, Foley missed the conversion. \nThe Australian pack had been hailed before kick-off by Cotter but it was his side who dominated the scrum battle, allowing Laidlaw to notch another penalty. \nBut Scotland's lead was reduced to a point just before the break. Australia rolled the dice as they turned down an easy penalty and it paid off as Cooper barged over for their third try. Foley let the Scots off the hook with another missed conversion. \nJoubert's decision to flash yellow at Maitland after the restart for a deliberate knock-on was harsh though and left Scotland vulnerable. The Wallabies took advantage, driving forward from a line-out before Genia tossed it wide for Mitchell to score again. To make matters worse, Foley finally found his range as he nailed the conversion. \nLaidlaw and Foley then exchanged kicks before the drama was turned up again when Russell charged down Foley's pass. The stand-off was hauled down before he could make the line but kept the ball alive as he popped off to Seymour who charged in for his fifth try in as many games. \nSkipper Laidlaw's first miss of the day meant Australia remained in front and when the Scots failed to win their own line-out five yards from their line, Kuridrani punished them again as he battered through for another Aussie try, converted by Foley. \nBut a stunning finale was in sight as Laidlaw added another penalty. \nWhen the Scots last beat Australia in 2012 it was played out in monsoon conditions Down Under. So when the heavens opened over Twickenham with seven minutes left it appeared destiny was on their side, with Bennett intercepting a James Slipper pass before darting in for another stunning score. \nLaidlaw converted to nudge his team ahead but when Joubert punished Scotland for offside - turning down Scottish appeals to refer it to the TMO - it handed Foley the chance to finally see off the plucky Dark Blues with a last-gasp penalty.
