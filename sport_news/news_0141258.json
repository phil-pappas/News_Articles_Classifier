I seen Shane Mosley calling out Cornelius Bundrage last week and he doesn't even have a world title. I have the world title now, so Shane Mosley should be calling me out. \n\"These are massive fights and massive names. People chase world titles and I have one so they've got to chase me now. I'm excited to see what names I get offered now. \n\"I don't really care where I defend my title but I have fulfilled one dream and now another dream is to win a world title in America. I would love to defend it back home too; I'm defending a world title wherever and that's just amazing.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T10:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T10:55:38.941+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
