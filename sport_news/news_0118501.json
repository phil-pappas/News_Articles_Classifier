The rope must be stretch a bit because it stops falling climbing rocks, if the rope is not stretchable a falling climber would be jerked suddenly. The using rope length should be ten to eleven millimeters in diameter.Using Carabineers:These are used in climbing which are made of solid aluminum with a loaded gate that allows the rope to be opened. Normally, the spring holds the gate closed, but the gate can be opened to admit a rope.Webbing:This Nylon webbing is most commonly using safety equipment often used tied into a loop. Climbing stores sell it by the foot, and it can be easily cut to any desired length. The ends are cauterized with heat to prevent fraying.Climbing Harnesses:To attach herself to a rope, a climber uses a sewn harness. A typical one has a wide nylon belt for the waist and a pair of leg loops for the thighs.
