Brian McCallum , FLORIDA TODAY 6:26 p.m. EDT September 30, 2015 HIgh school sports notebook Cocoa High's Chauncey Gardner is presented his Under Armour All-America game jersey (Photo: Brian McCallum) \nCocoa High football player Chauncey Gardner took another step in his football life on Wednesday, accepting his jersey for the Under Armour All-America game, prior to playing in the game in St. Petersburg on Jan. 2. \nAfter Tigers coach John Wilkinson recalled meeting Gardner and his family three years ago as a new player, Gardner said Wednesday’s honor was the next step in “a process” of becoming what he wants to become on the field. \n“You’ve got to take it step by step, go to the practices, go to the games, do what you’ve got to do, night in and night out, and who knows what’ll happen. My freshmen year, I didn’t think I could do it, but my coaches and my teammates did, and it came true.” \nGardner, who has committed to sign in February with the University of Florida football program, has been a star at defensive back for the Tigers, while also playing several other roles for the team, including receiver and punter. For his spring sport, he has become one of the state’s top high school sprinters, winning the Class 2A 100 and 200 meters last spring and also qualifying for state in the long jump. \nGardner followed two other Cocoa stars in being chosen to play in national all-star games. Tarean Folston, now a running back for Notre Dame, was an Under Armour selection, while Jamel Dean played in the Semper Fidelis All-American Bowl and eventually signed with Ohio State. This year’s NFL draft included eight first-round picks who played in the Under Armour game. Separation week in Brevard high school football \nWhile Wednesday’s ceremony was a highlight-filled event for Gardner that also included asking Cocoa junior Tiffany Harris to the school’s Oct. 24 homecoming dance, it was as big a day for his parents. \n“I’m all over the place,” mom Delatron Johnson said. “My chest is tight, and I’m excited and nervous, all of the above.” \nThe Under Armour game will be televised on ESPN2 at a time to be determined. \nViera grad Mall starting for Furman football \nBrevard County product Kevin Mall, who competed in football and track and field for the Hawks, has started three of four games for the football team at Furman University, in Greenville, S.C. \nMall is a redshirt junior for the Paladins, who are 2-2 . He has caught three passes for 55 yards, with a long of 27 yards at Virginia Tech on Sept. 12. Furman will host South Carolina State on Saturday. Cocoa offensive line could be key to big year \nTigers wrestling raises funds through fishing \nThe Cocoa wrestling program held its second Fish for Reds tournament last weekend. Anglers from across north Brevard County fished for the two biggest combined redfish and slot with spots. \nOttis Manley took first place, with a combined 67 inches. Billy Allred was second, with 62 inches. Chase Knapp took “most spots.” \nCocoa Beach has coaching openings \nCoaching positions in boys basketball and lacrosse are available at Cocoa Beach Jr./Sr. High. \nPrior experience is preferred but not required for a freshman boys basketball coach. The school also seeks someone to lead the boys lacrosse program, coaching the varsity while developing the program for grades seven through 12. \nInterested individuals should contact athletic director Fran Siljestrom at Siljestrom.fran@brevardschools.org. \nContact McCallum at 321-242-3698 or bmccallum@floridatoday.com.
