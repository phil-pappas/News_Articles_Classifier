The incident has been likened to insider trading. \nAttorney General Eric Schneiderman, in opening his investigation, said DraftKings and FanDuel employees may have exploited their access to nonpublic data. \n\"These allegations, and your company's subsequent statement, raise legal questions relating to the fairness, transparency, and security of FanDuel and the reliability of representations your company has made to customers,\" Schneiderman wrote to FanDuel. \nHe sent a nearly identical letter to DraftKings. \nThere's no evidence that the information led to the DraftKings employee's win, and a FanDuel spokeswoman said she did not believe there was an attempt to manipulate the contest. \nSchneiderman wants the companies to explain their policies or practices prohibiting employees from playing daily fantasy sports, whose participants put together virtual teams based on real players and compete for points based on the players' statistics. \nIn the letters, Schneiderman asked for the names, job titles and descriptions of employees who compile and aggregate data including pricing algorithms and athletes' ownership percentages for past contests. \nOn Monday, DraftKings and FanDuel posted identical joint statements on their websites saying nothing is more important to them than \"the integrity of the games we offer to our customers.\" \n\"Both companies have strong policies in place to ensure that employees do not misuse any information at their disposal and strictly limit access to company data to only those employees who require it to do their jobs,\" they said. \nAs the controversy reverberated Tuesday, ESPN said it was cutting sponsored DraftKings elements from within its shows. It called the removal a standard procedure when \"covering significant news, to avoid any suggestion of influence on our coverage.\" It said it was not cutting DraftKings commercials. \nCopyright 2015 by The Associated Press.
