So when [high school] tennis season rolls around, it's not just like spur of the moment situation. We get our training outside of the season. We work together all year.\" \nThe duo finished second at last year's Class 5A state tournament, losing a hard-fought three-set match to Thea Rice and Hannah Porter of Hot Springs Lakeside in the finals. In the semifinals of the Overall tournament, Minton and Swanson lost to eventual champions Mallory Tabler and Kendra Dinsmore of Bentonville. \n\"Playing together last year has really helped us this year because we've learned how each other plays,\" Swanson said. \"We've learned how to play to each other's strengths and we do have different strengths.\" \nMinton and Swanson dropped their opening game with Valley View's Paradise Gibson and Madeline Gammille in Monday's quarterfinals, but they responded by winning the next 12 on the way to a 6-1, 6-0 victory. Minton and Swanson play Cameron Riser and Kate McDonald of Little Rock Christian in today's semifinals at 9:45 a.m. The championship match is scheduled for a 1 p.m. start. \nThe Lady Bruins have set themselves up nicely for a possible team title. Pulaski Academy's second doubles team of Kendall Greer and Micah Meghreblian also advanced to today's semifinals, while sisters Caroline and Maya Hatley have both qualified for the singles semifinals. \n\"I think this can be a big year for us,\" Minton said. \"This is probably our best shot to win a team title.\" \n\"We really want to win this tournament,\" Swanson said. \"Not just as individuals, but as a team.\" \nTatum Rice of Hot Springs Lakeside, who finished as the Class 5A and Overall tournament runner-up in 2014, has advanced to the singles semifinals. Rice won both of her matches Monday by identical 6-0, 6-0 scores, defeating Evelyn Maurras of Valley View in the quarterfinals and Katie Henderson of Sylvan Hills in the first round. \nOn the boys side, defending Class 5A state champion Hunter Harrison won a pair of 6-0, 6-0 matches. Harrison, a junior from Pulaski Academy, knocked off Trent Swaim of Batesville in the first round and Noah Ross of Hot Springs Lakeside in the quarterfinals. \n\"I'm playing a lot better than I was last year,\" said Harrison, who will play Matt Phillips of Valley View in today's semifinals. \"I'm playing with way more confidence and a lot more power. I'm not missing as much. I'm playing more like a high-level player.\" \nSpencer Kauffman of Lakeside and Stuart Riser of Little Rock Christian will meet in the other semifinal match. \nSports on 10/20/2015", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T11:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T11:47:48.249+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
