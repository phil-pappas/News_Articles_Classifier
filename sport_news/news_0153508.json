Like Holland, Bannister entered the game as a nondescript prospect, a pitcher who appeared to have little to offer a contending team. Like Holland, Bannister breathed life into his career with the addition of one more pitch. Like Holland, Bannister eventually succumbed to an injury — in his case, a torn rotator cuff — that could be traced to adding that pitch. For Holland, the pitch was a splitfingered fastball that allowed him to pitch to lefties as well as to righties. For Bannister, the pitch was a cut fastball that kept the ball off the barrel of the bat. A pitch that he believes both created and destroyed his career. “I made the decision to pitch with my cutter because that’s what allowed me to get to the major leagues and pitch in the major leagues for a little while,” said Bannister. “Had I not thrown that cutter, I never would have been in the big leagues. There’s a very good chance that the cutter is what ultimately caused my injury and ended my career. “Had Greg Holland, who was a 10th-round pitcher, not developed his splitfinger, he probably never would have gotten to the position that he was to have the success that he had. One of the risks of the splitter is that it’s hard on the elbow. But I’ve seen so many guys where the difference between being a big-leaguer and being a career minor-leaguer is the addition of one pitch that might be a little more dangerous.” For a Boston organization that has seen pitching prospect after pitching prospect fail to pan out since the arrival of Clay Buchholz in 2007, the role Bannister takes on holds tremendous importance. Dave Dombrowski hired Bannister in large part to rectify the organizational shortcoming in discovering diamonds in the rough like Holland, who was a two-time American League All-Star reliever before his elbow gave out. “What can you do to get them over the hump?” Dombrowski said. “What can you do to get them to be a better pitcher? Sometimes it's an arm angle. Sometimes it's the repertoire of pitches they throw. Sometimes it's adding an extra pitch. Sometimes it's the analytical aspect of the spin rate you're using. You work together in trying to create the best basis of knowledge that you possibly can.” Both during and since his playing days, Bannister cultivated a reputation for being at the forefront of advanced statistics, for ignoring his win-loss record and even his ERA in favor of more advanced metrics that told a more precise story of his performance. To pigeonhole Bannister as a statistical analyst, however, would be to miss what the Red Sox hired him to do. What Bannister will do with the Red Sox is evaluate pitchers from a variety of perspectives — from old-school scouting to modern analytics — in an effort to find untapped talent and uncover hidden gems. As was the case in his own career, Bannister believes the modern focus on preserving pitcher health might be interfering with pitchers’ ability to get the most out of what they have. Other scouts might be in search of the delivery that minimizes stress on elbow ligaments, which in turn minimizes games lost to disabled-list stints. Bannister, on the other hand, has scouted with a focus on finding deliveries that make life difficult on hitters. “There are a lot of guys in the minor leagues with perfect mechanics, a lot of guys with very healthy arms, that can’t get anybody out,” he said. “Pitching coaches and people on Twitter are always in search of the perfect pitching mechanics, but to me, perfect pitching mechanics are the perfect mechanics for that person that leads to the best statistical results. They might not be like everybody else. You might look different. Tom Seaver didn’t pitch in any way like Randy Johnson, but they were both successful. “For me, the best part of studying pitching is identifying the characteristics that make some guys get people out all the time while other guys, who throw just as hard or who are generally perceived to have better mechanics or arm action, can’t get people out. That’s part of the mystery and the joy of pitching — identifying those characteristics.” Bannister has been cultivating his instincts for seeking incremental improvements since he was 12 years old and hanging around the Texas Rangers team for which his father Floyd Bannister pitched in 1992, at the end of his 15-year career in the major leagues. The younger Bannister can remember watching Nolan Ryan throw bullpens under the guidance of legendary pitching coach Tom House. He can remember the way House worked with Ryan and Kevin Brown, a young 20-game winner that season, to refine the way they manipulated the baseball to create more spin or deception. When Bannister studies modern metrics like spin rate, he does so in much the same way his old heroes did. It’s not about adherence to data. It’s about using data to maximize performance in much the same way pitchers have for generations. “Really, all of the analytics that have come out in the past couple of years, it’s the first time we’ve actually been able to measure those concepts and quantify them to some extent,” he said. “It completes the circle. The guys back in the day that I really respected and were really the best pitchers in the major leagues talked about things like this. Now we’re talking about the exact same concepts, but in a different way. It’s an attempt to distinguish between two pitchers who might have equal velocity, which one is more likely to have more success in the major leagues — and that’s really what it’s all about. “Tom Seaver was really big on getting his fingers in front of the ball, he called it, when he threw his slider. It was always a point of emphasis. These guys didn’t know how to measure it. They just knew that when they did it, it led to success. That’s really all they could do at the time because nobody could measure spin. Everybody had radar guns, but nobody could measure spin.” By Brian MacPherson", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T01:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T07:29:19.510+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
