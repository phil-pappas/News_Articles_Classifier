TCU took down the Longhorns in blowout fashion, 50-7.\nHere's how the nation reacted to Texas' loss Saturday.\nKirk Bohls, Austin American-Statesman: \"Texas really may be sinking to new lows. The Longhorns were bludgeoned in a soul-crushing, 50-7 loss to one of the best college football teams in the country on Saturday ... This was Freedom Bowl-ugly, UCLA Rout 66 Revisited.\"\nChris Johnson, Sports Illustrated: \"This was a beatdown of the highest order, a complete and utter pulverization that will leave Texas reeling long after its ride back to Austin. The game was effectively over less than 10 minutes in. Media members shifted their attention to the potential for collateral damage on the recruiting trail. UCLA 66, Texas 3 was recalled early and often.\"\nCedric Golden, Austin American-Statesman: \"Texas Fright. The Horns are scary bad. If you thought Saturday was a long day for the Longhorns, try this on for size: Texas still hasn't played Oklahoma, Texas Tech or Baylor. Shield your eyes, Texas fan. This is about to get worse. Much worse.\"\nJeff Caplan, Fox Sports: \"Sunshine pumping was becoming a cottage industry at Texas. Not anymore. Not after Saturday's 50-7 beatdown vs. No. 4 TCU. The Frogs had half their defense in the injury ward and were still missing one of their star receivers, but they still managed to thrash these lowly Longhorns ... This one is on the coaching. Strong and his staff had their team sleepwalking into the 11 a.m. (Central) start at a packed Amon G. Carter Stadium on a beautiful fall day.\"\nKevin McGuire, NBC Sports: \"Patience at Texas is essential for any rebuilding work to be done by head coach Charlie Strong, or any coach for that matter. The question is how much patience will Strong be given, and will it be enough to allow Strong to work his plan ... Good luck Charlie. You're going to need it.\"\nTom Fornelli, CBS Sports: \"Very rare is the occasion where I believe a coach should be in jeopardy of losing his job during his second season. By and large, I feel any coach deserves at least three seasons at a school to prove himself before the ax falls on his head. But there are always exceptions, and I'm starting to wonder whether Charlie Strong may be one of them.\"\nJay Busbee, Yahoo Sports: \"Texas is now 1-4 and in absolute freefall. TCU was ranked 4th coming into the game, but since this was about as competitive as a no-pads walkthrough, it's tough to give the Horned Frogs a whole lot of credit for this victory. Mark this down as another example of the balance of power shifting in Texas, and move on.\"\nOn Twitter:\n @Nick_Castillo74", "external_links": ["http://www.cbssports.com/collegefootball/eye-on-college-football/25326131/sorry-charlie-tcus-demolition-of-texas-puts-strongs-job-in-danger", "http://collegefootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2015/10/03/no-tcu-cranks-up-the-defense-in-texas-sized-blowout-of-longhorns/", "https://twitter.com/Nick_Castillo74", "http://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/ncaaf-dr-saturday/tcu-texas-165957139.html", "http://www.si.com/college-football/2015/10/03/tcu-horned-frogs-beat-texas-longhorns", "http://www.hookem.com/columns/golden-its-about-to-get-worse-after-cowtown-beatdown-to-frogs/", "http://www.hookem.com/columns/bohls-strong-is-losing-games-but-is-he-losing-his-players-too/", "http://www.foxsports.com/college-football/story/texas-longhorns-tcu-horned-frogs-charlie-strong-100315"], "published": "2015-10-05T02:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T13:40:41.856+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
