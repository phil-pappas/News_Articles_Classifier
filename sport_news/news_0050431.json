TEXAS TECH RUSH DEFENSE \nMike Warren has done things in the last two weeks no other freshman running back has ever done at Iowa State, and could have a chance to add to his momentum. Texas Tech is last in the Big 12 in average allowed rushing yards (277.4) while Warren has given the ISU offense another dimension with 301 rushing yards combined in the last two games. Advantage: Iowa State \nISU PASS OFFENSE VS. TTU PASS DEFENSE \nAside from two interceptions in the second half, ISU quarterback Sam Richardson was an efficient game manager and found eight receivers against Kansas. The Cyclones had 269 passing yards last week and should be able to throw against the Red Raiders secondary, which is last in the Big 12 and averaging 303.6 yards per game. If Iowa State can find consistency in the red zone — and improve on its 12-of-18 mark — then it should keep the TTU defense on its heels. Advantage: Iowa State \nTTU RUSH OFFENSE VS. ISU RUSH DEFENSE \nDeAndre Washington ran for a career-high 186 yards against the ISU defense a year ago, but will now have to contend with a three-man front. He's averaging 102 yards per game — third in the Big 12 — but the Red Raiders have made the yards on the ground count when they need to with 16 rushing touchdowns in five games, most in the conference. Advantage: Texas Tech \nTTU PASS OFFENSE VS. ISU PASS DEFENSE \nTexas Tech's ultimate strength lies in the passing game. The Red Raiders top the Big 12 in average passing yards per game (423.8) and sophomore quarterback Patrick Mahomes is averaging 367.2 yards with 14 touchdowns and has thrown for 300-plus yards in seven of his last eight games. The ISU defensive line has been efficient at getting to the quarterback with 14 sacks this year, but might have to let the secondary (No. 2 in the Big 12 and allowing 194.8 yards per game) contend with the potent air raid offense. Advantage: Texas Tech \nSPECIAL TEAMS \nIowa State kicker Cole Netten continued to be inconsistent against Kansas with a missed 28-yard field goal and make from 34 yards. Punter Colin Downing dipped in production against the Jayhawks, but has pinned opponents inside the 20-yard line nine times. Jakeem Grant is averaging 171 all-purpose yards for Texas Tech, while punter Taylor Symmank has effectively changed field position, kicking 50 yards or longer six times in five games. Advantage: Texas Tech \nINTANGIBLES \n1. Iowa State is 1-6 against Texas Tech in Lubbock. The only ISU win was in 2011 when the Cyclones beat the No. 19 Red Raiders, 41-7, with 368 rushing yards and four rushing touchdowns. \n2. TTU Coach Kliff Kingsbury played quarterback for the Red Raiders and faced the Cyclones one time in his career in 2002. Iowa State won, 31-17, and fans saw “The Run” from Seneca Wallace that day. \n3. In its last five games against Texas Tech, Iowa State is averaging 34.4 points and has scored 30-plus twice this season (vs. UNI and vs. Kansas). \n3 & OUT \n1. A different receiver has led Iowa State in receiving yards each game: Dondre Daley (70 vs. UNI), Jauan Wesley (76 vs. Iowa), D'Vario Montgomery (97 at Toledo) and Allen Lazard (75 vs. Kansas). \n2. According to the ESPN Football Power Index, the Cyclones' remaining strength of schedule is the toughest in America, with a projected win/loss mark at 3.4-8.6. \n3. After throwing two touchdowns and collecting his first Big 12 win as a starter, Sam Richardson has 44 career touchdown passes and needs just six more to break the school record set by Bret Meyer. \nISU WILL WIN IF ... \nIt can create a couple turnovers and control the clock. Texas Tech will operate quickly on offense, so forcing it into mistakes and setting the pace will be crucial. If the Cyclones are able to leave the defense on the sideline for extended periods of time, it could be anybody's game at the end. \nTTU WILL WIN IF ... \nIt can pressure Sam Richardson and slow down the ISU running game. Richardson has been the game manager Iowa State needs in the last two games, but has been inconsistent at times with potentially costly interceptions. If the Red Raiders are able to get to Richardson early and contain Mike Warren, the Cyclones will have trouble keeping up with the Texas Tech offense. \nPrediction: Texas Tech 45, Iowa State 35 Your Next College Football Articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T00:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T19:49:15.084+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
