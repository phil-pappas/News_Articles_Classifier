After carrying the puck through the neutral zone, the 18-year-old used Kris Russell as a screen and scored past Jonas Hiller on a long wrist shot. \nWith his parents in attendance, the first pick in last year's draft then capped the scoring with 3:40 left in the third, converting Taylor Hall 's pass for a power-play goal that brought out boos from the Flames (1-4-0) fans and loud cheers from the many Oilers fans in attendance. \nHall also had a three-point game for Edmonton (1-4-0), with a goal and two assists. Ryan Nugent-Hopkins and Nail Yakupov also scored as the Oilers got goals from all four of their first-overall draft picks. \nCam Talbot made 22 saves.
