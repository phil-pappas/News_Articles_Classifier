Is that going to be enough? We'll find out on Sunday.\" \nSchmidt is right to be wary as the Pumas, semi-finalists in 2007, have been playing some of the best attacking rugby of the tournament on their way to the last-eight showdown. \nThey have always been strong in tight play, particularly the scrum, but flyhalf Nicolas Sanchez now manages a backline that is as comfortable running with ball in hand as kicking the leather off it. \nMarcelo Bosch, banned for a dangerous tackle in their last pool match against Namibia, is a loss at outside centre and his replacement Matias Moroni is sure to have his defensive skills tested. \nArgentina's pack fears no one and the back row of Pablo Matera, Juan Martin Fernandez Lobbe and Leonardo Senatore would be a handful for any side, let alone one without three of its top forwards. \nVictories over Australia and South Africa over the last two years have proved the Pumas can live with the best sides around and in Sanchez they have a world class place-kicker. \nThe prize for victory is a semi-final date with Australia or Scotland, who face off in the last quarter-final later on Sunday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T16:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T16:28:52.948+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
