The series was done and dusted in Cuttack after India’s humiliating six-wicket defeat as South Africa sent the hosts packing for their second lowest total of 92 in a match which was interrupted twice due to unruly crowd behaviour. The final T20 match may have been rendered inconsequential but it would be of great importance for India skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni, who would look to get a win before the five-match ODI series against the visitors. For this to happen, Dhoni may have to drop his preferred picks — Ambati Rayudu and Axar Patel — and bring in Ajinkya Rahane and Amit Mishra. Dhoni’s selection of Rayudu ahead of Rahane, considered one of the best players of the format, has come under severe criticism. There is a strong possibility that the elegant right-hander will be included to lend stability to the side, especially after their Cuttack collapse. The Eden Gardens pitch is expected to be a spinner’s paradise. In such a scenario, Mishra seems to be a better bet but it remains to be seen whether Dhoni, who considers the leg-spinner to be slower in the air, picks him ahead of Patel or Harbhajan Singh. The biggest positive for India has been Ravichandran Ashwin, who has troubled the South Africans; he bowled out AB de Villiers in both the matches. The latest defeat to South Africa had added serious pressure on Dhoni. Though there’s no doubt over his fitness, Dhoni’s stroke-making skills have started to elude him, something that’s evident in the slide of his strike-rate. At Dharamsala, when it was expected that India would post around 220 after Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli’s 138-run partnership in 72 balls, India managed just 41 runs from the last five overs with Dhoni in the middle. It was worse in Cuttack, where the top order failed to give a start and the lower order, with Dhoni at No. 6, failed to build a partnership. On the other hand, the visitors have so far persisted with one specialist spinner in Imran Tahir, and JP Duminy has played a part-time role. Duminy and David Miller may play an extended role in bowling if Faf du Plessis opts for the same attack. — PTI Determined to make it 3-0: Miller Bolstered by the back-to-back wins, South Africa batsman David Miller says his team is all pumped up to make a clean sweep of the three-match T20 series. “I think it is a massive point. We are 2-0 up and are determined to make it 3-0. As you say, momentum and confidence is a big thing in international cricket. I think our preparations have been really good. We’ve been trying to check all the boxes and hopefully we come out on top tomorrow,” said Miller. “The series win is really big. We came here with a lot of expectations and there was a lot of pressure on us to perform. India is an amazing T20 team with huge players. It gives us a lot of confidence coming close to the World Twenty20,” said the hard-hitting batsman. AB de Villiers did not come for practice today and Miller said it was not much of an issue. Miller, who ran Rohit Sharma out with a direct throw in Cuttack, said they’re looking forward to more such dismissals at the Eden Gardens. “It’s a smaller boundary and there’s going to be a lot less twos and more ones. It’s a ground where there can be run outs. A little fumble here and there when the batters go for a two may just give a chance.” — PTI Live on Star Sports, 7pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T10:07:44.838+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
