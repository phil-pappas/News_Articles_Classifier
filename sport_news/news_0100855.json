That inspired me to invent this cooling bucket device.\"\nHe developed the MULTI COOLER to keep bottled and canned beverages cold and drinkable. The accessory also keeps food items, bait and other items cool. The unit ensures that cold food and drinks are readily available. This saves individuals from having to consume warm drinks. Furthermore, it is designed to be reusable, and it is adaptable for use with any five-gallon bucket.\nThe original design was submitted to the Washington D.C. office of InventHelp. It is currently available for licensing or sale to manufacturers or marketers.
