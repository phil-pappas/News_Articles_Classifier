Texas Tech can avenge last season's 82-point performance by TCU, which included 433 passing yards and 7 touchdowns from quarterback Trevone Boykin. An upset against No. 3 TCU would keep the momentum flowing for head coach Kliff Kingsbury and the Red Raiders following their road win against Arkansas. A TCU win would give the Horned Frogs a 2-2 record against Tech since joining the Big 12. The matchup also will be the first time TCU's co-offensive coordinator and former Texas Tech quarterback Sonny Cumbie makes calls against the Red Raiders in Jones AT&T Stadium.\nWhen Texas Tech has the ball?\nDon't go to the concession stand or the kitchen for risk of missing a big play. The Red Raiders are tied for third in FBS in scoring, averaging 54 points per game; fifth in yards per game, averaging 590 yards; and second in passing yards, averaging 399 per game. Mahomes has thrown three interceptions in as many games, but aside from the turnovers Tech's offense has proven efficient early on. Texas Tech has scored points on 13 of 14 red-zone opportunities with 10 of those possessions ending in touchdowns resulting in Tech's offense ranking second in offensive efficiency, a drastic change from last season\nWhen TCU has the ball?\nThe Red Raiders have not fared well against the run at this stage of the season. Tech ranks 122nd out of 127 teams defending the rush, allowing 257 yards per game. Although Boykin is the lead playmaker for the Horned Frogs, averaging 377 yards of offense per game, TCU rushed for 305 yards and three touchdowns in last year's meeting, including two individual 100-yard performances. The Horned Frogs offense needed 16 carries from running backs Trevorris Johnson and Aaron Green to churn out 210 yards and three touchdowns. Defensive Coordinator David Gibbs has taken steps to reform the Red Raiders defensively, but expect the Horned Frogs to try to wear down Tech's front seven with the run\nPrediction\nBoth teams are going to want to start fast. TCU scored at least one touchdown in the first quarter of all three of their prior contests while Texas Tech has produced at least two touchdown drives in three first quarters this season. It won't be a 10-3 thriller, but Texas Tech can beat TCU with timely defensive stops and by avoiding key turnovers. The Red Raiders have turned the ball over five times - all interceptions - in their two previous meetings with the Horned Frogs. Look for Mahomes to energize Texas Tech's sellout crowd with rushing and passing touchdowns while guiding the Red Raiders to a home win against a top-five opponent.\nScore: Texas Tech 52, TCU 41\nOn Twitter:\n @MikeDuPont_", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/MikeDuPont_"], "published": "2015-09-24T20:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T02:51:17.285+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
