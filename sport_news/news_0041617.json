With Ian Madigan now starting tomorrow's match versus Argentina it's ideal for him to focus fully on the out-half position. \n\"The centre position vacated by Jared (Payne) is well covered by Robbie Henshaw, Keith Earls, Darren Cave and Luke Fitzgerald.\" \nMadigan came of Test-match age against France, bossing Ireland's backline with poise and verve. \nThe 26-year-old playmaker must now repeat that feat, but this time from the off, against the fluent and threatening Argentina side that have lit up the World Cup with their ebullient counter-attacking style.
