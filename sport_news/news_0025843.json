(AP) — The Kansas City Royals kept waiting for Blue Jays ace David Price to give them some hope. \nIt turned out to be Toronto’s leaky defense that provided it. \nAfter managing one hit over six innings, Ben Zobrist’s easy fly that somehow fell for a hit began a five-run rally against Price in the seventh inning Saturday. The Royals rolled the rest of the way to a 6-3 victory over Toronto and a 2-0 lead in the AL Championship Series. \n“We needed to catch a break,” the Royals’ Alex Gordon said, “and Zobrist’s ball was it.” \nLuke Hochevar wiggled out of a jam to keep Kansas City in the game, and Danny Duffy and Kelvin Herrera got the ball to closer Wade Davis, who had to survive a shaky ninth to preserve the win. \nDavis gave up a leadoff single and walked pinch-hitter Cliff Pennington, but bounced back to strike out leadoff man Ben Revere and MVP candidate Josh Donaldson. Jose Bautista then flied out to right to give Davis his third postseason save and the Royals another postseason comeback win. \n“Our guys never quit,” Royals manager Ned Yost said. “They keep going.” \nEven though they looked foolish flailing at Price’s pitches — until the lazy fly ball by Zobrist changed everything. They proceeded to string together four singles and a double in their go-ahead inning, getting run-producing hits from Gordon, Eric Hosmer, Mike Moustakas and Alex Rios, along with an RBI groundout from Kendrys Morales. \nIt was a monumental collapse for Price, who had at one point recorded 18 straight outs. He fell to 0-7 in seven postseason starts, including a loss to Texas in their AL Division Series. \n“I gave up hits at the wrong time,” he said. “I felt good. It’s a very scrappy team. They put the ball in play. They continued to battle. It’s just a tough loss.” \nMeanwhile, the reigning AL champs have won nine straight ALCS games dating to their memorable seven-game series against Toronto in 1985 — the year they won their only World Series. The record is 10 straight wins set by Baltimore in the 1960s and ‘70s. \nNow, the Blue Jays head home for Game 3 on Monday night in dire trouble. All but three of the previous 25 teams to take a 2-0 lead in the best-of-seven era have won the series — though Toronto did rally from the same hole to beat the Rangers in five games in the division round.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T19:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T21:17:07.528+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
