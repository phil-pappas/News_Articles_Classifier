If I panic and freak out, then they will. They stayed calm. We adjusted about five things, went over them with the kids in about three minutes, came back out and warmed up.\n“… No one panicked, and no one yelled.”\nOlentangy flipped the script on New Albany in the second half, scoring 24 unanswered points to pull away to a 38-17 victory. The Braves (6-1, 4-0) won their fifth consecutive game and snapped New Albany’s four-game winning streak.\nToledo commitment Obi Anunike caught a 19-yard touchdown pass to erase a three-point halftime deficit, and after Jacob Fleck intercepted New Albany (4-3, 3-1) quarterback Casey Horch to start a 10-play, 82-yard drive, Cam Kennedy scored from a yard out to put the Braves ahead 28-17.\nKennedy added a 6-yard touchdown run to cap the scoring with 4:19 to play.\nKennedy’s 94 yards on 26 carries led Olentangy’s ground game, and Deeb Haber completed 14 of 28 passes for 210 yards and three touchdowns.\nNew Albany running back Victor White ripped off a 71-yard touchdown run on the Eagles’ second play from scrimmage and added a 75-yard scoring run in the second quarter after Olentangy had scored 14 unanswered points to tie the score.\nBut White — who has rushed for 1,197 yards this season — was bottled up thereafter. After gaining 152 yards on his first four carries, he had 2 yards on his next eight touches.\n“Our leaders stepped up,” Fleck said. “We got to each other and figured out what we had to change. Everything worked out. It was just reading our keys. We made some bad reads in the first half.”\nThe Braves got on the scoreboard when Haber found Anunike wide open for a 55-yard touchdown. Anunike bobbled the ball several times before righting himself and running the rest of the way untouched.\nHaber’s 52-yard pass to Sam Durst set the Braves up at the New Albany 5-yard line in the first minute of the second quarter, and on the next play Haber threw a touchdown pass to Derrick Wyche.\n“Ultimately, their physicality was the difference,” New Albany coach Pat Samanich said. “We had to do some things to try and keep them off-balance. We tried some quick throws and play-action (passes). But they made plays in the second half.”\nThis was the first of two consecutive games that probably will determine Olentangy’s league championship fortunes. The Braves visit Worthington Kilbourne (7-0, 4-0), the fourth-ranked team in Division II, on Thursday.\n“This was a huge game for us, and we know next week is a big game, too,” Anunike said. “You enjoy (a win) for a little bit, but we have to come right back and get even better.”\ndpurpura@thisweeknews.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T08:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T08:58:54.856+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
