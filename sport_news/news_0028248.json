Henderson/Getty Images \nRunning back Christian McCaffrey rushed for a school-record 243 yards and four touchdowns and added a 96-yard kickoff return to help No. 15 Stanford beat No. 18 UCLA 56-35 Thursday night. NHL notebook: Sharks' Couture suffers... \nIt was the Cardinal's fifth straight win since their season-opening loss to Northwestern and was Stanford's eighth consecutive victory over the Bruins, UCLA's longest-ever losing streak against any team. The Bruins' seven-game skid against USC from 1999 to 2005 had been their longest run of defeats against one opponent. \nMcCaffrey's 243 yards on 25 carries surpassed the school record previously held by Toby Gerhart, who rushed for 223 yards in a 2009 game against Oregon. McCaffrey, a sophomore, set the record in the third quarter and did not play in the fourth. His 369 all-purpose yards are the most by an FBS player this season and were just 10 yards shy of the Stanford record set by Glyn Milburn in 1990. \nStanford (5-1, 4-0 Pac-12) scored more than 40 points for the fourth consecutive game and is averaging 48.5 points in its four conference games. The Cardinal did not score in the fourth quarter Thursday when reserves were in the game. \nUCLA (4-2, 1-2) lost its second game in a row after falling to unranked Arizona State 38-23 on Oct. 3. Two weeks ago, the Bruins were ranked No. 7 and looked like a contender for the national-championship playoff. Thursday's loss might take them out of the Top 25. \nStanford already led 42-20 before McCaffrey scored his third touchdown of the game on a 70-yard sprint up the middle to make it 49-20. He scored on runs of 9 yards and 28 yards in the second quarter, and he added a 6-yard scoring run late in the third quarter to make the score 56-20. His four rushing touchdowns tied a school record. \nStanford quarterback Kevin Hogan attempted just 15 passes, completing eight of them for 131 yards, three touchdowns and one interception. \nUCLA freshman quarterback Josh Rosen was 22-for-42 for 325 yards with three touchdowns and two interceptions. Bruins running back Paul Perkins ran for 104 yards and a touchdown on 14 attempts, and wide receiver Darren Andrews had four catches for 100 yards and a touchdown. \nMcCaffrey had 118 of his rushing yards as well as a 96-yard kickoff return in the first half, helping Stanford take a 35-17 lead at halftime. \nStanford got on the scoreboard first when cornerback Alijah Holder intercepted a Rosen pass at the UCLA 31-yard line, broke a tackle along the right sideline, then raced across the field before reaching the end zone. \nUCLA closed the gap to 7-3 on kicker Ka'imi Fairbairn's 36-yard field goal midway through the first quarter. \nMcCaffrey returned the ensuing kickoff 96 yards to the UCLA 4-yard line, and the Cardinal converted that into a touchdown on the next play -- a pass from Hogan to tight end Austin Hooper to give the Cardinal a 14-3 lead. On UCLA's next play from scrimmage, Rosen threw a 70-yard touchdown pass to wide-open wide receiver Darren Andrews, cutting the margin to 14-10. \nStanford increased its lead to 21-10 early in the second quarter on a 9-yard touchdown pass from Hogan to wide receiver Devon Cajuste. That completed a 14-play, 74-yard drive that took 7:24 off the clock. McCaffrey's 9-yard run finished off Stanford's 42-yard drive on its next possession, making it a 28-10 game. \nA 71-yard scoring drive capped by McCaffrey's 28-yard touchdown run put the Cardinal ahead 35-10. UCLA got a little closer on Perkins' 3-yard touchdown run 11 seconds before halftime, completing an 80-yard touchdown march.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T07:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T08:17:55.374+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
