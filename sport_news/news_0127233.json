Seattle Seahawks (2-2) at Cincinnati Bengals (4-0) \nEasily the game of the week. We’ll find out fast if the Bengals offence is for real, because the Seahawks defence fights as timidly as Ronda Rousey at the opening bell. A loss would hurt the Bengals a lot more than the Seahawks -- not in the standings, but confidence-wise. \n2. New England Patriots (3-0) at Dallas Cowboys (2-2) \nToo bad Tony Romo (cracked collarbone) and Dez Bryant (cracked foot) aren’t healthy enough to play for Dallas. If QB Brandon Weeden leaves his effectiveness in the lockerroom at halftime again, don’t be surprised if the Cowboys turn to Matt Cassel. Regardless, Tom Brady should pick apart the Dallas secondary. \nBetting: Randall the Handle's Week 5 predictions \n3. St. Louis Rams (2-2) at Green Bay Packers (4-0) \nIf any team can pressure Aaron Rodgers into throwing his first interception at Lambeau since December 2012, it’s the Rams. The Rams’ cover corners are good too, starting with Janoris Jenkins. Still, there’s no good reason to believe the Nick Foles-led St. Louis offence can score anywhere near enough points to keep up with the Pack. \n4. Washington Redskins (1-3) at Atlanta Falcons (4-0) \nFolks, there are lot of teams 1-3 or 2-2. The Redskins haven’t played too badly. Their defence is better than you probably realize, and they can run it with anyone. Hard to see them staying with Matty Ice and the Falcons, though, who have been shredding the opposition on the ground as well as through the air. \nMUST-WIN SUNDAY \nThe team that must win, or else \nKansas City Chiefs (1-3) \nWe all know what happens when a pass rush gets to Bears QB Jay Cutler: not-good things for Chicago. And the Chiefs’ pass rush has been lights-out effective. Chiefs RB Jamaal Charles needs to have a better game than Chicago’s dynamic dual threat Matt Forte, or KC might drop to 1-4 -- virtually out of the playoff hunt already. \nTHE 3 BIG MATCHUPS \nA.J. Green vs. Legion of Boom \nThe Cincinnati Bengal is the latest elite receiver to give Seattle’s resuscitated secondary a go, after Megatron on Monday. Green has been prolific. Of the NFL’s top 40 pass receivers, Green is the only one averaging as many as 16.7 yards per catch. Free safety Earl Thomas needs a huge game for Seattle’s secondary. \nBlake Bortles vs. Jameis Winston \nBortles and Jameis. Has a nice ring to it. Hmmm. Anyhoo, last year’s first-drafted QB, Bortles of Jacksonville, is the 28th rated NFL passer. This year’s first-drafted QB, Winston of Tampa Bay, is the 31st. Limiting the mistakes: priority No. 1 at Tampa Bay. \nMarcus Mariota vs. the clock in his head \nThe rookie Titans QB is off to a fantastic career start. He’s the fifth highest rated passer in the league, throwing eight TDs against only two picks. But he doesn’t usually decide and throw as quickly as Tom Brady and Eli Manning did against Buffalo’s pass rush, which could spell trouble. \nQuick-hit items to whet your Week 5 appetite: \nAaron Rodgers has thrown 11 touchdowns without an interception so far in 2015. And, of course, he hasn’t been intercepted at home since December 2012. But the last time Rodgers threw a regular-season pick, anywhere, was last Dec. 14 at Buffalo, when safety Bacarri Rambo stole two of his passes. Before that? Oct. 26 at New Orleans, when Rodgers was picked twice. If you go back two full calendar years, Rodgers has thrown just eight interceptions -- over 25 regular-season games. \n- - \nIncidentally, Green Bay usually loses when Rodgers is picked off. The last time the Packers won a regular-season or playoff game in which Rodgers was intercepted was the 2013 regular-season finale at Chicago, which gave Green Bay the NFC North title. \n- - \nCleveland’s Andy Lee leads the league with a 52.7-yard punting average. And heaven knows he’s had his chances to punt with the Browns. \n- - \nCincinnati’s Giovani Bernard leads all rushers having carried at least 50 times with a 5.5-yard average. Overall, two rookies are among the Top 4 in yards-per-carry: St. Louis’ Todd Gurley is No. 1 (6.2), and Buffalo’s Karlos Williams is No. 4 (5.4). \n- - \nDevonta Freeman is the first NFLer in 10 years to rush for seven touchdowns in the first four weeks since LaDanian Tomlinson. \nTHE BIG NUMBER : 21 \nNumber of consecutive possessions opposing offences have failed to score a TD against the Seahawks, dating to late in Seattle’s Week 2 loss at Green Bay. \nTHIS JUST IN \nSaturday’s news updates: \nThe Baltimore Ravens waived Canadian defensive tackle Christo Bilukidi on Saturday. \nThe fourth-year player, who grew up in Ottawa, had re-signed with the Ravens last winter for $1 million over two years. The low salary meant he would not be a lock to make the team. \nThe 6-foot-5, 320-pounder impressed in the preseason and made the team. But he was not listed on the two-deep at DT. \nBilukidi was waived to make room for WR/KR Jeremy Ross, whom the Ravens elevated Saturday from the practice squad. \nRoss is a fourth-year NFLer who has caught 30 passes, two for TDs. He has returned 53 punts, one for a TD, and run back 47 kickoffs, one for a TD. \n* * * \nGreen Bay on Saturday downgraded WR Davante Adams (ankle) and S Morgan Burnett from questionable to doubtful, for Sunday’s game against St. Louis. \nAs well, the Packers added two players to the injury report. CBs LaDarius Gunter (heel) and Sam Shields (toe) are probable against the Rams.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T22:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T01:39:37.057+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
