We knew there were going to be some bumps and rocks in the road, and you have to overcome it. We lost some great people from trades, some really good people.\n\"Anthony Rizzo talked about Edwin Jackson tonight. Edwin Jackson was a contributor on this club. And James Russell is not here. But these are all people who contributed down the road in this â€” even the Scott Feldmans, the Paul Maholms, the Matt Garzas and (Jeff) Samardzijas.\n\"Those guys, and the seasons that they had here, whether they believe it or not, they contributed to where we are at right now, along with some other front office people, some scouts, some coaches and guys.\n\"And this is a journey that's not finished yet.\"\nBosio stays in the background most of the time and prefers not to talk about himself. He had an 11-year major-league career, going 94-93 with the Brewers and Mariners, and he tossed a no-hitter in Seattle in 1993.\nBut he was never into self-promotion. It was all about winning the game, no matter what it took.\nThe first time I met Bosio was after a White Sox-Brewers game July 21, 1991 at new Comiskey Park, now U.S. Cellular Field. Bosio outdueled Sox knuckleballer Charlie Hough in a 2-1 Brewers' victory, but what I remembered most was a play at the plate.\nSkinny White Sox outfielder Lance Johnson had tripled down the right field line with two outs in the fourth and tried to score moments later when Bosio's pitch to Ron Karkovice eluded catcher B.J. Surhoff and bounced a couple of feet away.\nSurhoff's throw to Bosio covering the plate was in plenty of time and Johnson didn't bother to slide into the 6-foot-3 pitcher, who then weighed around 230 pounds, at least according to the Brewers' media guide.\nBosio tagged Johnson hard for the out and Bosio was asked about it later in a group interview.\n\"Basically I said: 'Here I am. Run me over,'\" Bosio said.\nJohnson was no fool. He chose keeping his body intact over trying to bowl over getting crushed trying to bowl over the beefy Bosio.\nThat \"run-me-over-if-you-can\" attitude lives on with the Cubs' bullpen, which consists of a group of pitchers who either have been demoted, injured or cast off. They're a bunch of pitching mutts, much like Bosio himself.\nOn Tuesday night in Game 4 of the NLDS, manager Joe Maddon called on seven of his relievers to pitch the final six innings of the Cubs' 6-4 victory over the Cardinals. And it worked.\nBosio gets a lot of credit, with good reason, for Jake Arrieta's transformation into one of the best starters in the game. He built up Maholm, Feldman, Samardzija and others.\nBut he was beaming Tuesday night talking about the performances of Justin Grimm, Travis Wood, Trevor Cahill, Fernando Rodney, Clayton Richard, Pedro Strop and Hector Rondon, who combined for 13 strikeouts while allowing two runs on five hits over their six innings.\n\"It's amazing what these guys have done, really all year, and Joe deserves a lot of the credit because he manages every single inning, every game, to win,\" Bosio said. \"The guys know that and they're ready.\n\"They're hungry. We have guys with flexibility, we have guys with experience who have gained that experience throughout the year. I'm sure going into the series (the Cardinals) probably expected Grimm, Strop, Rondon (in late-inning situations). For the other guys to step up, it shows the kind of bullpen we have. We knew because we've seen the results.\n\"Guys have done a great job, but by no means do we think we're done. It was quite an accomplishment getting past Pittsburgh and St. Louis. But the best stuff is coming. I really, really believe that.\"\npsullivan@tribpub.com\nTwitter @PWSullivan\nPrivacy Policy Major League Baseball Baseball Chicago Cubs Milwaukee Brewers Chicago White Sox St. Louis Cardinals Hector Rondon", "external_links": ["http://www.tribpub.com/privacy-policy-and-your-privacy-rights/", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-561efbf0/turbine/ct-sullivan-cubs-spt-1015-20151014"], "published": "2015-10-15T04:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T12:55:13.586+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
