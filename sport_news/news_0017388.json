He has scored nine goals — tied for third in the CCC — in nine matches, compared with four total from his sophomore season. \nWhat’s so different? \nThis year, he lives near campus. \nLopez made the move from Aberdeen to Olympia during the summer. He lives in an apartment with teammates Angel Guerra (goalkeeper), Crisantos Chavez (defender) and Juan Oropeza (midfielder), who is his cousin. \n“When I didn’t live here, I used to leave after practice and not put in extra time,” Lopez said. “Living here has made me more committed to the soccer program.” \nHe said he also feels more comfortable, which has translated to the scoreboard. All of Lopez’s goals have come in TESC’s last four games — including three apiece against Multnomah and Walla Walla two weeks ago. \n“Our team chemistry is getting much better, and I think that’s a big factor of why I get more space to shoot,” Lopez said. \nLopez netted two against Oregon Tech on Saturday to bring the season total to nine. In the 58th minute he found the back of the net from 8 yards out. In the 88th minute, he rocketed his second goal to the far right post to solidify a 4-0 Geoducks win. \n“His agility is fantastic,” Evergreen coach John Purtteman said. “He’s explosive and can change direction very easily, and just has a tremendous shot as well.” \nPurtteman said he’s been waiting for Lopez to break through. \n“I knew that it was there because you can tell his technical ability is so good,” Purtteman said. “It was just a matter of him getting comfortable.” \nFollowing shutouts of Southern Oregon and Oregon Tech over the weekend, the Geoducks are tied for second in the CCC at 6-1 (9-1 overall). They travel to Montana this weekend to face Carroll College and University of Great Falls. Clippers volleyball program in the works \nSouth Puget Sound Community College has started the process to add volleyball to its athletic slate in the fall of 2016. \nThe college opened the position for admissions advisor/volleyball on Oct. 9 via its website. \nThe volleyball program will replace softball, which was dropped this summer. \nThe opening closes Oct. 27. \nLauren Smith: 360-754-5473", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T05:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T04:06:33.775+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
