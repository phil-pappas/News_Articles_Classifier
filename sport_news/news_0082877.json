It’s here Wednesday.\nIn many ways, a look back at the movie reveals the future is still the future.\nUSA Today does not have 3 billion readers, as the paper proudly stamped, Swiss terrorists might make a nice change from the current reality and Queen Diana never did tour America.\nThey never got around to making Jaws 19 and the tiny pizza that went into the Black & Decker Hydrator and came out cooked and sumptuous enough for a family of four never made it to market.\nWe can’t predict rain to the second and our cars don’t hover, although they did get some things right.\nWe have electronic billboards, facial recognition technology and Marty’s famous hoverboard does exist, though not on every streetcorner.\nThe big news came early in the movie though when Marty, still trying to come to grips with the future, runs into Young Terry, who by now is Old Terry, and is asked to donate to save the Town Hall clock tower.\nBehind him, an electronic billboard announces the Chicago Cubs win the World Series.\n“Cubs win world series ... against Miami?” says Marty, looking up.\nWTF: ‘A flipping point for baseball’\nMarty McFly can’t believe the Cubs have won the 2015 World Series. Source: Supplied\nThis was big news for a stunned Marty. There was a team in Miami? The in-joke was that the Cubs still hadn’t won a World Series.\n“Yeah, it’s something, huh?” says Old Terry. “Who would’ve thought? 100 to 1 shot! I wish I could go back to the beginning of the season, put some money on the Cubs.”\n“I just meant that Miami — what did you just say?” Marty asks.\nHe suddenly realised that the Cubs had still not won a World Series since their last in 1908, which made them then, and still does now, owners of the longest title drought in America’s four major sports.\nSays Old Terry: “I said I wish I could go back to the beginning of the season, put some money on the Cubbies!”\nSo here we are in the real 2015 and, Wednesday, those Cubbies beat St Louis in the National League Divisional Series to advance to the National League Championship Series.\nThey started the season at 40-1 and, as of Friday, are favourites to win the World Series that starts October 27 at 5-2, or $2.50.\nThey are eight wins away from winning the World Series and life imitating art. More, omen bettors and movie geeks are on the verge of something very juicy.\nCould the Chicago Cubs make Back to the Future a reality? Source: Getty Images\nWhile not the 100-1 Old Terry wished he got part of, a stack of them got the 40-1 and kept backing them in to their current odds and haven’t stopped since.\nThe big advantage in the bookies favour is not one bookmaker has ever paid out on a Cubs World Series win.\nThe Cubs have not even made a World Series since 1945. Meanwhile, the rest of America waits to see how the Cubs will blow it. The Cubs are that sort of side. They are known as the “Lovable Losers” and have found more ways to lose than Wile E Coyote.\nThe most famous was the Cubs last best chance more than 10 years ago, against Florida at home in Chicago in the National League Championship.\nThey led the series 3-2 and led game six 3-0 heading into the eighth inning when Florida’s Luis Castillo popped a foul ball into the air and outfielder Moises Alou headed to the fence for what looked an easy catch.\nThat’s when Cubs’ fan Steve Bartman bowed to the American obsession for memorabilia and instead of letting the ball simply plop into Alou’s glove for an easy out and leave his team just four outs away from that first World Series since 1945, he reached out and snatched the ball from Alou’s grasp.\nIt got him the ball ... and the Marlins rallied and scored eight runs before the innings was over, winning 8-3 and coming back the next day to eliminate Chicago and progress to their own World Series. They won it in six.\nIf there is a way to lose the game the Cubs usually find it. Not this year, hopefully. There’s something in the universe.\nRyan Anderson driving monster truck Son-uva Digger. Source: News Corp Australia\nJUST ANSWER THE QUESTION\nRyan anderson, Monster car driver, Son-uva Digger\nYou drive Son-uva Digger and your dad, Dennis Anderson, drove the famous Grave Digger before your brother Adam took over, sounds like a family business.\nAbsolutely. I was born into it and I’ve been doing it ever since.\nHow did your dad get into monster trucks?\nHe started putting bigger and bigger tyres on his mud truck. Soon he was getting tyres off big combines, big farm machines. He worked on a farm at the time so it wasn’t a problem.\nAnd it took off from there?\nHe started to crush cars. He had a catchy name from Grave Digger and when he crushed the cars people remembered it.\nThat must have been fun watching that growing up.\nIt was normal for us. But when we’d bring friends over we’d do the craziest things and now, when we look back and realise what was a normal life, we had anything but a normal upbringing.\nIn what way?\nWell, we never got toys. We got actual vehicles and dad would tell us to go out in the farm and crash them. It was crazy. Our life evolved around monster trucks.\nIt must be nice that, at the same time, the sport has grown so you can make a living out of it now?\nIt’s been insane in the past 10 years. We’re doing things now that we wouldn’t imagine doing 10 years ago. Backflips, frontflips ...\nI imagine it must be hard practising for that. It’s not like you can crash into foam pits like the bike riders.\nWe’ll get a pile of cars and put them out in the middle of the field. And hopefully land in a pile of cars. You surprisingly land well when you land in a pile of cars.\nWhat’s the craziest thing you’ve done?\nIt’s kind of hard to pick one. So many when you look back that we shouldn’t have done. We tried four consecutive backflips and it didn’t work out. Dad ended up landing on top of me. I actually broke my neck in that one. Since then it’s changed so much.\nYou’re competing with Monster Jam at ANZ Stadium tonight and everyone is there to see the trucks. Tell us about Son-uva Digger.\nThere’s a whole design team working on new designs. Mine and my dad we did ourselves. Mine took seven years from the time of the idea to the paint scheme. I’d do a design and kind of like it, then change it. Mostly that’s because I was too young, I wasn’t ready to drive so I kept reworking it.\nDan Parks: 'Scotland must defend well' 6:42 Rugby World Cup: Former Scotland fly-half Dan Parks joins Patrick Stack at the desk to take a look at the Wallabies' World Cup clash against the Scots in the quarterfinals\nOctober 15th 2015 6 days ago /video/video.news.com.au/Sport/Rugby Union/Rugby World Cup/ A GOOD WEEK FOR\nTHE Wallabies have never been in a better position to win a World Cup. Their four greatest rivals are all on the opposite side of the draw. They are on the weak side, facing Scotland and then either Ireland or Argentina in the semi.\nMore, their greatest threats, South Africa and New Zealand, will likely face each other in the semi-final and with any luck they will do a job on each other and be left nursing tender ribs as they prepare for Australia. The only possible fear for the Wallabies is they won’t be as battle-hardened as their final opponents. But could they plan it any better?\nGITEAU: From baby face to leader\nRIVALS: Scotland’s tough approach\nDON’T MISS\nONCE again the big trainers take the stage, with racing’s latest super trainer, Chris Waller, presenting three strong chances in Saturday’s Caulfield Cup (Channel 7 5.40pm).\nThere used to be a time when the Caulfield Cup was the best form guide towards the big one, the Melbourne Cup, but the influence of overseas horses in the past decade has thrown that theory away like losing betting tickets. But before we honour Waller and his like let’s pause; it will be the first Caulfield Cup without the great Bart Cummings, who won the race a record seven times.\nUP FOR THE CUP: Saturday’s best\nINSIDE MAIL: Big bets and market movers\nA ROUGH WEEK FOR\nAh, the French. If memory serves, a similar revolt to Les Bleus Rugby World Cup campaign also took place with their soccer World Cup team in 2010. Why can’t they ever be happy? Back then, the players refused to train for the manager Raymond Domenech.\nThis time, before Sunday’s quarter-final against New Zealand, the French have exacted a coup on coach Phillipe Saint-Andre. It could not have come at a worst time. Or a better time. As Sports Fans know, the sidelining of any coach usually in a turnaround in performance equal to what wasn’t there before. All Black fans are terrified.\nANGRY PILLS\nTHE Matildas continue to brawl with FFA and show the struggle is far from over. Australia’s most successful soccer team, boasting a World Cup quarter-final win, they are also the only national team to strike.\nCHILL PILLS\nWELL done Ash Barty, who quit tennis’s WTP tour to go all-Jarryd Hayne and sign with Brisbane Heat in the Women’s Big Bash League. Already she has the greatest attribute: when she hits them, they stay hit.\n Can Cubs go Back to the Future?", "external_links": ["http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/sport/more-sports/chicago-cubs-in-line-to-make-back-to-the-future-world-series-prediction-a-reality/story-fni2frsp-1227572057175", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/external?url=http%3A%2F%2Fcontent4.video.news.com.au%2Ffoxsports%2Fprod%2Farchive%2F2015%2F10%2F16%2FFSD_161015_MLB_G5_NY_METS_LA_DODGERS.jpg&width=650&api_key=kq7wnrk4eun47vz9c5xuj3mc", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/origin:fatwire.", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/b8e8df7c68d662458a84d4ae936fe862", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/021a473f57383371bdf49c62b0713fb6", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/external?url=http%3A%2F%2Fcontent4.video.news.com.au%2Ffoxsports%2Fprod%2Farchive%2F2015%2F10%2F15%2FFSD_151015_DAN_PARKS_CHAT.jpg&width=650&api_key=kq7wnrk4eun47vz9c5xuj3mc", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/733fc707abdd1aad8ebe48eca22129d6", "http://widgets.outbrain.com/outbrain.js", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/0d8572d698e9f2cd1315a69617cd3d5f", "http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/"], "published": "2015-10-17T01:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T18:28:52.728+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
