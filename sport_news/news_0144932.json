It is a good experience. I just play my game and pay attention to the court. This is very important to me.\"\nKing was placed on a team by the luck of the draw.\n\"It's not that difficult because all of us play basketball,\" he said. \"You just move the ball and play. Luckily, I play with guys who are not selfish, and they move the ball. It is my dream to play in the NBA, so I am willing to do whatever it takes.\"\nPembroke Pines resident Immanuel West, 16, plays at Miami Norland High School, where he is a sophomore. This was his second showcase event in the past year, but his first time playing using a random selection process.\n\"This was important to me to see how I play with all different players under a different [system],\" West said. \"This helps me get my skills better and develop different ways of playing. It gives me more experience about training and what college coaches are going to be looking for in the future.\"\nDudley Blackwell, a 13-year-old from Miramar, was also playing in his second showcase event. The Sagemont School eighth-grader said wanted to show people he has what it takes to get to the next level.\n\"I get to show my talents,\" Blackwell said. \"Pressure is not in my vocabulary. I try not to look at them or think about it. I just play my game like there is nobody here, like it is an open gym.\"\nDeerfield Beach's Herman Robinson, 17, showed he could run the floor and hit long-range jumpers.\n\"This is pretty big to come out here and show my skills and be put on the map,\" said Robinson, a junior at Highlands Christian Academy. \"There have been a lot of good players that have come through here. It's a great program.\"\nTournament organizer Tony Perkins said there were athletes from around the state, including as far away as Jacksonville. The boys played on Saturday, the girls on Sunday.\n\"The purpose is to get a lot of these kids in South Florida exposure on a national level,\" Perkins said. \"We want to help them get seen and recognized by some of the larger scouting services in the United States.\"\nThe athletes pay $125 to play in the event, and each participant is guaranteed three games.\n\"They come and we give them skill development training in the morning, which a lot of these events don't provide,\" Perkins said. \"The biggest thing we try to do is provide coaching and exposure. They also get competitive games. We mix them up on different teams, and some of the coaches from the local high schools and travel teams [are involved].\"\nMany players, including Sagemont School graduate Prince Ali (UCLA), have played in the showcase and gone on to college.\n\"What we pride ourselves in is identifying the kids early and monitoring them through their high school careers,\" Perkins said. \"It gives us a chance to identify them when they are as young as in the sixth grade.\"\nHave an idea for a sports centerpiece feature?
