(Photo: Steve Mitchell, USA TODAY Sports)\n7 CONNECT 21 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE When the NBA holds its annual rookie transition program every August, none of the youngsters who come through the league’s New Jersey doors should be able to leave until they hear the story of David West.\nIn this basketball world where missteps and money problems so often lead to lost opportunity and wasted talent, the San Antonio Spurs forward is proof positive that doing things the right way pays off in the end. Even when it doesn’t.\nAfter 12 seasons, the 35-year-old who had earned two All-Star berths and $87 million in combined salary but had zero championships to his name faced a tough choice: pick up the $12 million player option to play for an Indiana Pacers team that many considered in decline, or take his title pursuit elsewhere while enduring the kind of pay cut that most veterans would never consider. He opted for the latter, signing a veteran’s minimum deal with the Spurs that will pay him $1.49 million in all by season’s end.\nBut rest assured, West said in a recent chat with USA TODAY Sports, he’s already being paid back in other forms.\n“Towards the end of my career, it’s just (about) having options and being able to make decisions based on everything but the fact that I need, need, need money and have to scrape every last dollar out of the NBA,” said West, who has a son and a daughter with his wife, Lesley, and is known as one of the more charitable players in today’s game. “I’m beyond that at this point in my professional and personal life.\n“I see guys all the time make decisions based on the money, especially toward the end, just hanging on and trying to make up for mistakes they made earlier. But we’re not in that situation.”\nUSA TODAY\nThabo Sefolosha's reasons for a trial were more than principled\nHe’s not in that boat, of course, because he was smart with his money; because he avoided the traps that basketball players often fall in to. And, because his consistent play, team-first personality and revered leadership skills had teams like the Spurs and the defending champion Golden State Warriors itching to add him during this late stage of his playing days.\n“My whole career, I’ve been very strategic about what I’ve done with my money and how we’ve invested,” West said. “The future is very bright, so when it came down to this basketball decision, I was saying, ‘Well, it’s not about money at this point, it’s about finding … a good basketball environment where I might learn and ultimately compete at the very top. These guys (the Spurs) are there every year. The organization, there’s like a mythological lure about them and the way people talk about them.\n“I’ve been a Spurs fan my whole life, and having an opportunity and wanting to learn from (Tim) Duncan and Manu (Ginobili) and Tony (Parker) and obviously Coach (Gregg) Popovich and all his knowledge, I just felt like it was a good environment, and it was the best environment.”\nUSA TODAY\nKristaps Porzingis getting more comfortable with Knicks\nWest has made it clear before that San Antonio’s landing of forward LaMarcus Aldridge during free agency in July sealed his decision. As such, he’s more than happy to be join Ginobili as their second sixth man of sorts. It’s a sacrifice of a different kind, however, considering he remains productive enough to play a starting role on most teams (11.7 points, 6.8 rebounds, 3.4 assists per game last season).\nUSA TODAY Sports' Sam Amick discusses the biggest story lines for the upcoming NBA season.\nWest said he gave serious consideration to joining the Warriors, but the combination of the Spurs’ remarkable track record and their understated ways proved the more comfortable fit. The two sides had some shared history, too, as West’s New Orleans Hornets fell to the Spurs in seven games during the 2008 Western Conference Semifinals. He was at his best back then, averaging 20.1 points, 9.3 rebounds, and 2.4 assists while facing off against Duncan.\n“I just felt like this was my speed here (in San Antonio), just sort of the way they do things,” West said. “Like I said, being in New Orleans, competing against them, just knowing what the organization was about and what these guys can bring, I just wanted to be a part of it.”\nThe freedom required to make that choice, however, was something he earned along the way.\n\"We gave ourselves a shot (in Indiana), four years being there,\" said West, who was the Pacers' resident locker room leader during that time when they reached the Eastern Conference Finals twice and the semifinals once. \"It was time for a changed environment, and obviously looking at my situation, knowing that I had more yesterdays than I do tomorrows, I was just trying to figure out the best situation. Like I said man, I loved my time there. It was just time for me to give myself a crack at this.\"\nPHOTOS: NBA preseason highlights\nOct. 10: Trail Blazers forward Mason Plumlee (24) passes around Kings defender DeMarcus Cousins (15) during the first half in Sacramento.
