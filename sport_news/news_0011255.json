Shmyr now has three points in the last three games after failing to register any in his first four contests. \n“They’re excellent hockey players and I’m honoured to be playing with them,” Shmyr said. “I look forward to playing with them this season.” \nOn Saturday, the Wheat Kings built up a 2-0 lead on first-period goals by Tanner Kaspick and Duncan Campbell. But the lead was erased early in the second when the Oil Kings scored on three separate power plays in three minutes, getting goals from Aaron Irving, Lane Bauer and Luke Bertolucci. \nThe line evened up the game a few minutes after the third Edmonton goal, when Hawryluk fed Duke, who then sent the puck to Macoy Erkamps for the tying goal. \nWhile the Shmyr-Duke-Hawryluk line didn’t find a way to score the go-ahead goal, they created opportunities on a good number of shifts. \n“We want to have an impact on the game,” Duke said after the game on Saturday. \n“I think we had that tonight, but you can always do more. If we just bang the net a little harder and get in there into the dirty areas, we might bounce one in. It just didn’t happen tonight.” \nThe newcomer to the line is Shmyr, but Hawryluk already likes what he brings. \n“He’s got lots of skill,” Hawryluk said. “He’s got good hands and he’s a smart player. He works really hard and gets in there. He’s a pest.” \nDuke also describes Shmyr as skilled, adding that he sees the ice well and has good hands. \nHawryluk and Duke, who are both 19 and National Hockey League draft choices, only skated together a bit last season. Both also spent some time with Shmyr, but they never were a line together. \n“They’re both really skilled,” Duke said. \n“I think Jayce and I complement each other’s games. He’s a hard-hitting, hard-working forward and he’s got a great shot. I just try to find him as much as I can.” \nIt’s obviously worked. Hawryluk has two five-point games and Duke has had one since the line came together. Duke also scored his first career hat trick. \n“The line’s been clicking,” Hawryluk said. “We’re moving the puck to the net and things are going well. I give a lot of credit to them; they’re scoring and they’re finding me. Whenever that happens, it’s always nice.” \n<B>ICINGS: With their loss to the Oil Kings (3-3-1-0) on Saturday, the Wheat Kings \n(4-1-0-2) fell into a tie for first place in the East Division with the Moose Jaw Warriors \nrandon F <B>Tim McGauley (shoulder, week-to-week) sat out on Saturday, along with F <B>Ty Lewis (upper body), F <B>Quintin Lisoway, F<B> Garret Armour and<B> D<B> Mark Matsuba … <B>Bukarts returned on Saturday after serving a three-game suspension for a hit from behind … The Wheat Kings will play their last home game in three weeks on Friday night, when they host the Swift Current Broncos.
