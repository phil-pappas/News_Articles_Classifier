This is where I’m from, this is where my family is, so you think about it at different stages and then you get to a certain stage in your life. \n“I’m 25 now, football is important – it’s not the most important thing, the most important thing for me is family. \n“But to be able to combine the two with such a terrific football club which Geelong is, it’s a pretty exciting prospect.” \nDangerfield reckons he has upwards of 100 relatives in the greater Geelong area, all of whom are just as excited as he is by the chance to don the famed navy blue and white hoops. \n“It will be nice to surf and fish and then cruise into Geelong and play footy,” he said. \nDangerfield was also looking forward to playing alongside another of the competition’s very best midfielders in Geelong skipper Joel Selwood. \n“Obviously he’s a champion of the game, a champion of this football club,” he said. \n“It’s not only Joel, it’s the other 45 players who make up a team and that’s important if you’re going to experience success – everyone has a role to play.” \nGeelong coach Chris Scott deliberately kept his distance during negotiations between the two clubs, with master recruiter Stephen Wells filling him in when he thought it necessary. \n“I understand the hype that will surround a move like Paddy coming home,” said Scott. \n“But we also acknowledge as a footy club we’ve been in transition for a long period of time, we’ve been working really hard on developing a group of players who can stand on their own two feet. \n“Clearly Paddy and some of our senior players are going to help. \n“But if Paddy hadn’t arrived at Geelong we would still have a level of confidence in our playing future.” \nDangerfield could have joined the Cats as a restricted free agent, but the Crows got better compensation for him by orchestrating a trade. \nThey received draft picks nine and 28 and untried Geelong midfielder Dean Gore in exchange for Dangerfield and pick 50.
