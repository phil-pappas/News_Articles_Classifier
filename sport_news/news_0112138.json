(Robert Mayer / Sun Sentinel) Associated Press \nFormer Miami Dolphins receiver Irving Fryar was sentenced Friday to five years in prison for his role in a mortgage scheme. \nHis mother, Allene McGhee, was sentenced to three years' probation in the same case. \nBoth were convicted in August of applying for multiple mortgage loans in quick succession while using the same property as collateral. \nFryar, 53, who also played in the NFL with the New England Patriots, the Philadelphia Eagles and the Washington Redskins, was -- along with Mark Ingram in 1993 and '94-- a starting wideout in Miami for Dan Marino from 1993-95. Coincidentally, Ingram was released from prison earlier this year after serving six years for bank fraud, money laundering and jumping bail. \nFryar's defense claimed he was the victim of a \"con artist\" who told him to carry out the scheme, a reference to William Barkdale. Barkdale pleaded guilty last year to a conspiracy charge and was the government's key witness at Fryar's trial. He is serving a 20-month prison sentence.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T23:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T08:24:41.367+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
