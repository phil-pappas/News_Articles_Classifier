He was injured when Dodgers second baseman Chase Utley recklessly slid into second base as Tejada attempted to turn a double play during the Mets' loss in NLDS Game 2 Saturday.\nMORE: Best photos from the NLDS | Open letter to Matt Harvey: Don't throw at Harvey\nTejada is expected to spend six to eight weeks in a cast, but will be ready when spring training rolls around in February.\nUtley was handed a two-game suspension for Games 3 and 4 Sunday after MLB chief baseball operator Joe Torre explained his slide was deemed \"illegal.\" Utley appealed the suspension, but he is free to play because his appeal will not be heard before Monday's game.\nThe questionable play was the second time in less than a month a player had been injured by a careless slide into second. Pirates shortstop Jung-ho Kang was lost for the season on a similar play in September.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.sportingnews.com/mlb/story/2015-10-11/mlb-suspends-chase-utley-two-games-for-slide-on-ruben-tejada-nlds-dodgers-mets", "http://www.sportingnews.com/mlb/story/2015-10-11/mlb-playoffs-2015-mets-dodgers-nlds-chase-utley-slide-ruben-tejada-matt-harvey-revenge", "http://www.sportingnews.com/photos/4657748-mkb-playoffs-2015-nlds-national-league-division-series-photos-cardinals-cubs-dodgers-mets/slide/363941", "http://www.sportingnews.com/mlb/story/2015-09-17/jung-ho-kang-injury-update-pirates-cubs-knee", "http://www.sportingnews.com/mlb/story/2015-10-11/ruben-tejada-injured-chase-utley-takeout-slide-mets-dodgers-nlds-game-2", "http://www.sportingnews.com/", "http://www.sportingnews.com/mlb/story/2015-10-12/chase-utley-appeal-slide-ruben-tejada-broken-leg-mets-dodgers-nlds-2015-mlb-playoffs", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T09:06:25.129+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
