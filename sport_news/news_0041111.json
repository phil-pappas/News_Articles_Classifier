BG's total yardage was the most since Babers took over prior to the 2014 season. 5: Touchdown passes for Matt Johnson \nHis five scores went to five different players: Ronnie Moore (71 yards), Roger Lewis (68 yards), Ryan Burbrink (40 yards), Travis Green (12 yards), Derek Lee (two yards). 30: UMass rushing yards \nFreshman Marquis Young led the team with 35 net yards (he fumbled, too). That five-yard difference should give you a good idea on how putrid the rushing attack was otherwise. 56: Pass attempts for Blake Frohnapfel \nIt was the second time this season Frohnapfel has been asked to throw the ball more than 50 times and the sixth time overall. He's averaging 45.4/game this season, good for third-most in the nation. 91: Bowling Green offensive plays \n\"Falcon fast\" was on display again Saturday. BG is now averaging 89.5 snaps per game, behind only Tulsa (94.6) and West Virginia (90.5). Hard to defend on tired legs if you're UMass. 37:17: Bowling Green's time of possession \nWith the Minutemen holding the ball for just 22:30, all those BG plays translated into a massive advantage in TOP. 100.0: Bowling Green's success rate in the red zone \nNot only did the Falcons move the ball with ease, but when they got done near the end zone, they capitalized every time. With four touchdowns and two field goals, BG went 6 for 6 in the red zone. 13: Receptions for Tajae Sharpe \nThe senior wideout now has 58 catches, putting him on pace 139 this season. That would, uh, shatter the previous UMass record of 92.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T00:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T01:16:26.023+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
