Gary Al-Smith has the wrap. \nCoached by the legendary Emmanuel Amunike, Nigeria opened their title defence on Saturday with a 2-0 victory over the United States of America. \nIn the game played in Santiago de Chile, the Golden Eaglets withstood the enterprising play of their opponents, before Chukwudi Agor opened scoring five minutes after the break when he blasted home after the Americans failed to clear. \nStar striker Victor Osimhen doubled the advantage in the 61st minute, slotting home after getting the better of two defenders. \nIn an earlier match, Guinea came from behind to draw 1-1 with England. The young Englishmen missed a first half chance to take the lead from the spot before Edward Hinds nodded home the opener in the 61st minute. \nGuinea playmaker Naby Bangoura equalised for his side in the 76th minute after collecting a through pass from Jules Keita and finishing superbly. \nAfrican champions Mali were held to a goalless draw by Belgium in their opening game on Sunday. In the game played in Talca, the Eaglets dominated much of the game but failed to convert their form to goals against the plucky defence of the Europeans. \nPulling the strings for the Malians was 15-year-old Sekou Koita who looked every inch like a new star gifted to the competitive global sport. The youngster star came closest to breaking the deadlock with a first half effort that crashed against the woodwork. \nHe was also involved in a goal that was denied by the assistant referee's flag after his cross in was poked home by Boubacar Traore. In the second half, Koita again slipped in central striker Aly Malle, who went one-on-one with the Belgian goalkeeper, but missed the target. \nSouth Africa play their first game against Costa Rica on Monday. \nAbout Africa's fourNigeria are the defending champions after triumphing for a record fourth title two years ago in the UAE. However they only barely qualified for this edition of the finals after finishing as the fourth best team in the African qualifiers. \nMali are the African champions, after beating South Africa in the final in Niamey, while Guinea were third. \nNigeria are in Group A alongside hosts Chile, the USA, and Croatia, while Mali are in Group D with Honduras, Belgium and Ecuador. Guinea are in Group B with England, Brazil and Korea Republic, and South Africa are in Group E with Costa Rica, Korea Republic and Russia. \nFollow Gary on Twitter: @garyalsmith.
