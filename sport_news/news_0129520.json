He now stands at 2,212 yards with at least three more games remaining.\nHe became Franklin's single-season receiving yardage king with 193 in a Week 1 win against Pottsgrove. But for Buffalo, one record stands above them all. \n\"Probably touchdowns,\" he said after a pause. \"Yeah, touchdowns. Because yards might not help my team win, but scoring a touchdown would.\" \nThe defending league champion Electrons (5-1, 3-1) are in second place in the AAAA Independence Division behind undefeated Northeast (6-0, 4-0). \nIn trying to repeat as champions, Buffalo said he has felt the weight of leadership. Last year's offensive leaders, quarterback Kevin Caldwell and receiver Rafeal \"Macho\" Rodriguez, have graduated. \nBut Buffalo also relishes the opportunity. \n\"There is a lot of pressure knowing that everybody looks toward you and a few other players,\" he said. \"It's a lot, but it feels good knowing that they look toward me and I can help them by never letting them down and trying my best.\" \nHis best has already set him apart in league history, but the Erie Avenue resident said he remains focused on the present. Franklin coach Dave Carter makes sure of that. Buffalo said Carter will largely keep him in the dark about the college interest he has generated until after the season. \nUntil then, Buffalo will continue on the path that started with one simple, life-changing touchdown. \n\"I had played football before that, but it wasn't that huge for me,\" he said of his first touchdown. But I played that freshman year and got a taste of it and I knew I wanted to keep with it.\" \nTop performers. Mastery North's Yassar Windle rushed for 224 yards on 13 carries in a 54-6 win against Future. St. Joseph's Prep's D'Andre Swift romped for 217 rushing yards on 23 carries in a victory over St. Joseph's Regional (N.J.). Answered Gleplay had 209 yards on 17 carries as John Bartram beat Mastbaum, 40-6. \nEpiscopal's Dee Barlee collected 159 yards and five touchdowns in a 42-14 romp against Conwell-Egan.
