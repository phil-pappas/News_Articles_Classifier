There's still 10 games left on the schedule. I know. That seems unpossible. But I checked it. Twice. \nThe bright side, if you want to call it that, is we've still only seen the Dez and Romo Cowboys for roughly one quarter, and we still haven't seen the Dez and Romo and Hardy and Gregory and McClain and Lee Cowboys for one single moment yet, and that the NFC East is kind of a music festival portable restroom at the moment, and all this 0-4 slide has done, really, is limit the breathing room Romo will have come late November into December. \nYou could also say that it's lifted a veil and shown us a glimpse of the long, dark, post-Romo future, but that kind of introspection is best left outside of football. \nPut it this way; would you rather take Dallas, where it is right now, feeling horrible after a third winnable game slips away, or would you rather take Washington, who despite a stirring comeback that lead to this display of negative charisma sit just a half game ahead of Dallas and its half season of quarterback misery? \nWould you rather be in Philadelphia's position, whereby Mark Sanchez is being seriously discussed as an answer at quarterback? \nThe truth is a Cowboys team with Romo is lording over the division right now, and in (hopefully) three weeks he'll be right back. That doesn't excuse the plentitude of mental errors Dallas made on Sunday, from Terrance Williams' inexplicably bad route on Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie's pick six, or Anthony Hitchens getting washed on the Dwayne Harris kickoff return, or whatever it is that happened to Cole Beasley on the final back-breaking muffed punt return. Romo's really really good, but he doesn't fix those (although he probably doesn't stare down Williams on the pick six, or float the pass in on that gentle, slow-moving arc that Cassell's passes seem to follow, but let's leave that stone on the ground for now). \nThe team's gaze now turns to Seattle, where the 3-4 Seahawks are also struggling with an identity on the season. It will be on any unit other than the passer to steal a game, and both the defensive line and the offensive line are capable of it (and at times, both looked like it could take a win away from the Giants, but historically bad special teams saw to that not coming to pass. \nFortunately Seattle has made a habit of letting winnable games slip away as well, generally against inferior competition (although probably about 28 NFL teams are pretty clearly inferior to Seattle these days). If that trend would be the one to continue on Sunday, I think we would all agree on that and call it good. \nAt the end of the day, it comes back to finding those two wins in the cruft along the floorboard that is a half-season sans Romo. In all likelihood, the team has exactly three weeks to find them. It's never too late for now, Matt.
