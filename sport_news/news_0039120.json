Now the positive marks in the ledger are starting to pile up. \nThe Colts (11-6-2) are in the midst of a 10-game stretch without a loss. Their lone tie in that period came at No. 10 South Oldham, a perennial contender in the state. \nWest Jessamine went 2-6-1 in its first eight games. Four of those losses were to top 10 opponents and two to highly ranked out-of-state foes. The tie? No. 5 Lexington Catholic. \n\"I told these kids, you're not going to be judged on that\" brutal schedule to start the season, Coach Kevin Wright said. \"You're gonna be judged on what we do at the end. \nThey've only been shut out twice, against No. 1 Sacred Heart and No. 2 Assumption, and those games came early in the year. \nWest Jessamine has scored four goals or more against the four Lexington opponents they've played, all wins save for LexCath tie. In the span of three days it tore up No. 18 Henry Clay (5-1 win on Saturday) and Paul Laurence Dunbar (7-0 win on Monday). \nMitchell, who's fielding DI offers, had a hat trick and two assists against the Bulldogs. Lee, a University of Kentucky commit, scored twice and had two assists as well. \nThat pair has played together since middle school, and it shows. Both zip around while off the ball and have a knack for not just knowing where the other's going to be, but putting her in the right position to get the Colts on the scoreboard. \n\"It's really back and forth between us,\" Lee said. \"It's really fun playing with her.\" \nMitchell has 18 goals and 12 assists through Monday; Lee has 13 goals and 16 assists. \nMitchell said playing a tough slate to start the year was beneficial for the Colts. \n\"In the postseason those are the types of teams we're gonna play so we gotta be prepared,\" Mitchell said. \nLee and Mitchell aren't just a lethal pair on the field; they're also an undefeated doubles duo in the team's ping pong bonding exercises. \n\"We have intense tournaments,\" said senior standout Chancey Wallace. \nIf their chemistry's as natural there as on the field, good luck. \nWest Jessamine 7, Paul Dunbar 0 \nAt Paul Dunbar \nG —WJ: Mitchell 3, Lee 2, Isaacs, Little. \nGK —WJ: Perdue.
