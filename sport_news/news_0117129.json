The senior receiver’s unforgettable, game-winning, 35-yard touchdown catch in the end zone on the last play of Paramus Catholic’s 19-16 victory at Don Bosco instead kept the Paladins in the thick of the Big North United Division race and gave them valuable power points in the Non-Public, Group 4 standings. \n“When I caught it, I put it to my chest,” Stewart said Saturday. “No matter what, nobody was going to take it away from me. I held onto it with all my might. Tyrone Hill [Don Bosco’s senior defensive back] had his arm in there and he was trying to pick it out. I said, ‘Nah, Ty. I got it, man.’Ÿ” \nStewart’s teammates and coaches never doubted that he’d have it. They have grown accustomed to the Passaic resident making exceptional catches at important moments for the Paladins (2-3), who’ll face Friendship Academy (5-2) next Saturday in Washington, D.C. \n“Donald is, in my opinion, the No. 1 receiver in New Jersey,” Paramus Catholic coach John Westervelt said. “Whoever you put on Donald, our chances look good if you throw him the ball. If you put the ball anywhere near him, we feel pretty good that he’s going to come down with the ball.” \nThe 6-foot-4, 185-pound Stewart caught five passes for 145 yards and two touchdowns Friday night. \nAmong those receptions was an acrobatic, 33-yard catch near the sideline that set up the Paladins’ first touchdown of the game, a 4-yard run by senior tailback Ahmad Thomas that put Paramus Catholic ahead, 6-0, with 2:58 to go in the first half. Stewart also caught a 13-yard touchdown that helped tie the game at 13 at the 1:56 mark of the third quarter. \nStewart’s stellar performance marked his third two-touchdown game this season and second straight strong outing. He caught six passes for 117 yards and two scores in Paramus Catholic’s 27-21 loss at Bergen Catholic on Oct. 3. \n“He’s a great athlete,” Westervelt said. “He’s 6-foot-4, he jumps, he’s got giant hands. He’s been a wide receiver his whole life. He has worked his tail off to be a wide receiver. \n“He didn’t change from this position to this position to this position. He’s done everything in his power to be the best wide receiver he can be and it shows on the field. Donald is a leader, a good kid, a smart kid who works hard in school. Donald is the whole package.” \nCoaches from FBS schools have more than taken notice. \nStewart, who owns a 3.6 grade-point average, has scholarship offers from Boston College, Connecticut, Illinois, Iowa, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Northwestern, Pittsburgh, Rutgers, Stanford, Syracuse, Temple, Vanderbilt, Wake Forest and Washington State. He has scheduled official visits to Michigan (Nov. 28-29) and Stanford (early January), but Stewart has yet to choose the three additional schools he’ll officially visit. \nHe is more focused today, however, on helping Paramus Catholic complete its comeback from 1-3. \n“I’m so happy we got this win because we definitely needed it,” said Stewart, who transferred from Seton Hall Prep following his sophomore basketball season. “It gives us a lot of momentum. We’re looking forward to getting back to practice. First we have Friendship, then IMG [Academy on the road Oct. 23]. We’ve got to finish the season strong.” © 2015 North Jersey Media Group Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T06:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T06:55:44.403+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
