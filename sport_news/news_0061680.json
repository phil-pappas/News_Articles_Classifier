By virtue of the tiebreaker, goals differential in district matches, Oakland will be the top seed in the tournament. The Lady Patriots were plus-15 goals vs. Siegel’s plus-14. \n“They had a one-goal advantage,” said Siegel coach Eric Shelton. “That decided the regular season.” \nThe Lady Stars (11-2-1, 5-0-1) have not allowed a goal to be scored since a 4-0 loss to Houston on Sept. 10. Siegel didn’t allow a goal in any of its district matches. \nOakland (10-1-4, 5-0-1) almost got a score in with nine minutes remaining in the game. The Lady Patriots played it in, and Abbey Peach dribbled around Siegel’s wall of defenders, faked a cross and had an open shot at the goal when Siegel goalkeeper Hayli Meeks made a rare mistake and bit on the fake and was out of position. \nBut Peach’s shot on goal hit the left side of the goal and rolled away. \n“It’s called U.T.I., that’s a play we do, and I missed,” said Peach. “A right-footed player stands in the wall, we’ll play it in, and you shoot it, cause people think that you’re just going to cross it.” \nThree different Oakland players battled for the rebound, but Siegel’s Taylor Ryan and Emma Schrage got to it and kicked the ball away to end the threat. \n“We didn’t organize very quickly and they got the play off,” said Ryan. “Our goalie came out and they got the shot off. Luckily Emma and me were standing there ready to get anything on it to get it out of there.” \nSiegel also had some near-miss goal opportunities in the final 10 minutes. Two shots hit the crossbar and bounced away. \nEmma Grace Goldman made a diving last-second stop of another shot which looked to be headed towards the net. \n“We (and Siegel) have the best defenses in the county and the best goalkeepers in the state,” said Oakland coach Jeff Boynton. “I thought it was even. We were unfortunate to not score. They could have scored too.” \nThe District 7-AAA tournament will begin Monday. Siegel will play Monday while Oakland will get a first-round bye and play Tuesday at Siegel Park. \nDISTRICT 7-AAA STANDINGS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T05:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T05:15:36.659+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
