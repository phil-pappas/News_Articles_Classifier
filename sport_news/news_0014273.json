You can contain him if you don’t let him getting that steam power going,” James said. “If you can just put a hand on him before he picks up that speed … but once you let him get trucking, it’s hard. He’s a hard man to bring down.” \nSobrato coach Tony Holmes didn’t mince words when he said a lack of depth is really starting to take its toll on the Bulldogs. \nInjuries continue to plague Sobrato who are missing key linemen as well as key playmakers who are listed day-to-day. \nIn their place are guys who Holmes said are tying, but aren’t where they need to be. \n“There’s some guys who have no business being out there on the football field but we’re forced to play them because of the rotation.” \nFor all the down notes struck in Saturday’s game, a huge positive also emerged. \nRiley Owen cleared his sit-out period after transferring from Live Oak. \n“He’s a great asset to any team. He’s a motivator. He’s a leader. He’s got that go-win attitude. That’s Riley Owen all in a nutshell,” Holmes said. \nOwen made his presence felt immediately with 60 yards receiving and a rushing touchdown. \nHe eluded tacklers and helped spread out the defense, which in turn opened running opportunities for Darius Wheeler, who rushed for 99 yards on the day. \nThe 60 yards receiving helped Bolio to 86 yards passing for the day. \nBolio said the addition of Owen will make Sobrato tough to beat once everyone gets healthy on offense. \n“I think we’re going to be a hard team to beat. Right now if we execute all our weapons, I don’t think anybody in this league is going to have an easy time stopping us,” Bolino said. “We have a great run system and a great pass system. If we learn how to use it and have the momentum on our side, we’re going to be a hard team to stop easily.” \nAnd for a half, Sobrato looked like it would put up a fight. \n“I think the momentum was on our side. We started driving the ball. All the plays in practice were working,” Bolino said. “The blocking schemes were there. Everything was there. So it felt good to have the momentum on our side.” \nOwen recovered a fumble by James on the Silver Creek 17 to end the Raiders’ opening drive, which pushed 51 yards to the Sobrato 8. \nThe Bulldogs led 6-0 after Owen capped off an 83-yard drive with a six-yard run. \nSobrato’s defense then forced Silver Creek to settle for a three-and-out, setting up a 41-yard drive that stalled at the Raider 6. \nBut Vitale Butera turned the drive into points with a 23-yard field goal and a 9-0 lead at the start of the second quarter. \nThat was the last points Sobrato scored and James took over the game for the Raiders. \n“The second quarter he started plowing through us. But that’s what guys like that are built for. They’re built for bruising and playing four quarters going down south,” Holmes said. \nOn Silver Creek’s ensuing possession, James went 64 yards on the third play from scrimmage to cut Sobrato’s lead down to 9-7. \nThe Bulldogs did halt Silver Creek’s next drive, forcing the Raiders to settle for a 35-yard field goal attempt that missed badly. \nSobrato just couldn’t capitalize. \nJoseph Mendoza intercepted Bolino on Sobrato’s first play from scrimmage, giving the Raiders a short field. \nSilver Creek went 45 yards on nine plays, highlighted by a fourth-down conversion from James. \nHe went the final six yards to put the Raiders up 14-9 at the half. \nTo start the second half, Sobrato twice turned the ball over on downs trying to go for it on fourth down at midfield. \n“At that point in time we were only down by six. At that time I felt as if we could keep that momentum going, our kids would be playing harder,” Holmes said. \nBoth times Silver Creek scored. \nThe first was set up on a pass to tight end Xavier Soto, who went 42 yards before being stopped at the Sobrato 5. \nAfter James got the ball to the 3, Savali Tautiaga went the final distance for a 21-9 lead. \nThe second time Sobrato turned the ball over, James needed one play to go 42 yards and the final margin. \nThe Bulldogs possessed the ball just two more times, the first ending with a punt from its own 16 and the second ended with a fumble on a strop sack from Keith Kelly. \nKelly disrupted Sobrato the whole day, forcing Bolio to run for his life several times, sacking him three times. \n“He knew how to get off a block and when he got off a block, he knew where to go from there,” Bolino said. “He knew how to shed a block and he created havoc back there.” \nSobrato will now have a short week before it gets ready for Independence on Friday in San Jose.
