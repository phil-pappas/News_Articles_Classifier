He's getting an opportunity to continue to live his dream out and be on a team that's good and be able to showcase his talent to the world, but happy for our team that our anchor is back on the floor.\" \nWhile coach Erik Spoelstra cautioned that the Heat would be prudent with the return, Whiteside said he no longer is at risk for exacerbating his injury. \n\"I'm still not 100 percent, because there's still some tightening and it's still tight,\" he said. \"But I'm cleared to play. I can't injure myself, so that's what's most important.\" \nSpoelstra said Whiteside should be able to make quick gains, having been a regular on the practice court throughout the offseason. \n\"It definitely helps that he was here,\" Spoelstra said of Whiteside's offseason sessions. \"And then it helps that he played for us last year, that he was always in the pre-practice group. They drilled a crazy amount of reps last year. He got great game experience and he was here all summer.\" \nBosh said there was an air of comfort with Whiteside back. \n\"It's good to start crawling before you walk, just getting him back out there running the sets,\" he said. \"You always have to kind of start simple. We understand that the game is moving a lot faster and he's going to have to play catch-up right now. But he knew the sets.\" \nAt 1-3 in a preseason that resumes with road exhibitions Saturday against the Houston Rockets and Sunday against the Atlanta Hawks, the Heat essentially get to re-set their course. In all, four preseason games remain for the Heat. \n\"I mean it's huge,\" Dragic said. \"He's one of the main guys. He's going to be our anchor in the paint.\" \nAs for the overall roster, there remains a cautious approach with forward Josh McRoberts, who not only was held out of the past two exhibitions, but also Thursday's practice. He was sidelined for the season last December due to knee surgery. \nForward Amar'e Stoudemire and guard Mario Chalmers, who also missed the past two exhibitions due to knee soreness, returned to practice Thursday. \nwinderman@tribpub.com.
