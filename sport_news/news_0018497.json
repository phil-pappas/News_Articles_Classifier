Now it’s just ironic it’s happened to him,\" quarterback Drew Brees said.\nVitt fell during the early morning hours on Saturday, but it did not keep him from getting his work done. Vitt returned to the Saints facility in a scooter. It is how he gets around the office now.\n\"I’m sure you’ve seen him at practice many times. He wants to be in the mix. He has his little spot back there. He’s moving along with his players and he’s running in there and yelling at his guys on offense and defense and everything else and special teams, it doesn’t matter. He’s just a football coach. He’s not used to sitting in a cart. You can still hear him across the field though,\" Brees said.\nBrees said he's not surprised that Vitt would chase the perpetrators.\n\"I was like is there any inkling to call the cops? That’s what the police are for. Let’s chase after these guys in your socks. It’s some good stuff all around,” Brees said.\nThe extra days of rest between last Thursday's game against the Falcons and Sunday's game against the Colts gives Vitt some additional time to heal.\nCopyright 2015 WVUE .
