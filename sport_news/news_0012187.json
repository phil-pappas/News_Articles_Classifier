The management of grade III acromioclavicular (AC) joint injuries, also known commonly as shoulder separations, is sometimes controversial. There have been concerns that delaying surgical treatment -- to see if the injury will get better without surgery – could lead to inferior results in those who eventually opt for surgery. Patients from Dr. Millett’s practice were used to collect the data for the study.\nThis study co-authored with researchers Max Petri, MD and Marilee Horan, MPH from SPRI, found that delaying surgery after acute grade III injuries to the shoulder AC joint did not affect the ultimate outcome. Based on the data collected, it was concluded that a trial of non-operative treatment is warranted as successful outcomes can be expected, even in those patients that eventually opt for surgery. A secondary finding showed that patients who came to their orthopaedic doctor for their initial evaluation 30 or more days after their injury were more likely to opt for surgical treatment. This study is part of a series of ongoing studies at SPRI on the arthroscopic surgical management of AC joint injuries.\nFounded in 1983, the German Arthroscopy Association (AGA) is the largest Arthroscopy Society in the world. The goal of AGA is to foster close contact among physicians practicing arthroscopy and provide a forum for mutual exchange of ideas. “This award from AGA is a great honor for our team and we hope that this research will help surgeons make better decisions about the best treatment for their patients with AC joint injuries,\" said Dr. Millett.\nIn addition to receiving the award for this study on AC joint injuries, Dr. Millett was invited to the 2015 Annual AGA Meeting as an international guest speaker. He spoke on Superior Labrum Anterior and Posterior (SLAP) tears and Biceps Tendon disorders and their surgical treatments.\nAbout Dr. Millett\nAs the Director of Shoulder Surgery at The Steadman Clinic and a Scientific Advisory Board Member at the Steadman Philippon Research Institute, Dr. Millett is dedicated to orthopedic research. As an internationally recognized shoulder specialist, Dr. Millett focuses his research on the shoulder AC joint osteoarthritis, rotator cuff tears and shoulder instability. Keeping active people active through excellence in clinical care, orthopedic research, and education is Dr. Millett’s mission.", "external_links": ["http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cDovL3d3dy5yZXNlYXJjaGdhdGUubmV0L3B1YmxpY2F0aW9uLzI3OTE1NTY5M19DbGluaWNhbF9SZXN1bHRzX0ZvbGxvd2luZ19Ob24tb3BlcmF0aXZlX01hbmFnZW1lbnRfZm9yX0dyYWRlX0lJSV9BY3JvbWlvY2xhdmljdWxhcl9Kb2ludF9Jbmp1cmllc19Eb2VzX0V2ZW50dWFsX1N1cmdlcnlfQWZmZWN0X092ZXJhbGxfT3V0Y29tZXM=", "http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cDovL2RybWlsbGV0dC5jb20vYWMtam9pbnQtaW5qdXJ5Lw==", "http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cDovL2RybWlsbGV0dC5jb20vZHItcGV0ZXItai1taWxsZXR0LW9ydGhvcGFlZGljLXN1cmdlb24tdmFpbC1jb2xvcmFkby8="], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T14:21:41.847+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
