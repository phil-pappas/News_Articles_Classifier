Susan and I had been hunting for another pottery mosquito repellent holder to give us two. I found one at Home Depot and we purchased it. \nWhile I was there I got a bottle of the new Super Gorilla Glue. I got it for fishing but when we got home and opened up the box the pottery was broken into three pieces. I’m pretty good at puzzles so I got the glue and commenced putting it back together. Now this new super glue will hold, take my word for it. I put the pottery back together and it was better than when new. \nThis Ape Glue is slow drying. You know how when regular super glue dries on your fingers we sometime chew it off with our teeth? Well I was pretty messy with this new glue. Without thinking too long on it I put my finger in my mouth and was going to chew some of the glue off. \nWell this was a slow-drying glue and there was a little on my finger that didn’t dry yet. Well it stayed on the inside of my top teeth. I was set upon by a case of the Dumb A. I stuck my tongue up to my teeth to get it off and it was instant stick. After a lot of this and that I finally got it loose without losing any tongue hide. It was one of the few times in my life I was pretty quiet for a while. \nYou know I have been writing about catching fish in the weeds. Last Friday Charlie Hill, my retired fireman friend, met me at the house and we went fishing. I gave him a rod, reel, and lure — a Black Heddon Baby Chugger. I ran to one of my spots and on my first cast with my Booyah Spinnerbait I got a keeper. \nWe moved around me working the backs of the weeds, Charlie working the front. He missed a fish, then caught one. I got another. We caught seven out of that one spot. I went back to my next favorite spot. I gave Charlie a Medium Heavy TFO Gary Loomis Rod and Booyah Spinnerbait. \nFishing this style isn’t for wimpy rods. Now I’m not the only one fishing now throwing a Spinnerbait. For use of a better word, I’m calling my style weed-hopping. It’s not easy to do it right and you need four things — 40-pound braid, a small Spinnerbait Booyah Counter Strike, 3/8 ounce. \nThe blades are different and I think the fish have seen enough of the regular Spinnerbaits that this new vibration interests them, plus bigger Spinnerbaits don’t work as well for this style of fishing. \nThe third thing you need is patience, a lot of it, and fourth is casting accuracy. You need to pick out spots as far back in the weeds as you can the size of a dinner plate or little bigger. They are generally not fished as hard as the bigger open spots. Allow for wind. \nUse a slow, steady retrieve as long as you keep the bait coming it bounces up, off and over the weeds. You will have thrown over a lot of weeds and as you retrieve the bait it will come out of the water crawling over and up in the weeds, hopping out of the weed tops into the water constantly, if you work your rod right. Friday I had one bass climb up a weed after my bait — Charlie and I watched it. \nYou are going to get hung a lot and that’s where the Braid comes in. I mean you are gonna get hung a lot. On a long cast the lure is often out of the water more than in. If you are a person who gets aggravated about repeated hang-ups and taking big long weeds off your lure on about every cast this might not be your cup of tea. Even I get a little riled at times. \nFriday Charlie and I caught over 30 bass in a little over three hours. Charlie had the two biggest fish on the Heddon Baby Chugger. I had the most on my Spinnerbait. With the lake dropping like it is the fish will likely move out before long. But until they do I’m going to be weed hopping my Booyah Spinnerbait. \nAdventure Texoma Outdoors owner John Blasingame (903-814-5566) reports fishing below the dam is good for bigger stripers. He has an airboat. Pottsboro luremaker Jeff Foreman says the crappie bite is really picking up in water 6-to-20 feet deep. He is using his brand of Jigs and soft plastics.
