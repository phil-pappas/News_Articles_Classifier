At 7 pm, NASCAR officials made the call that the race will be run on Sunday afternoon, with the green flag set to fall at 12:30 pm. \nThe event marks the first race in the Contender round of the Chase for the Sprint Cup, and, should a Chase eligible driver win, it will instantly transfer them to the all important Eliminator round, as the field for the Chase will continue to be narrowed. \nWhen the race gets underway, Chase contender Matt Kenseth will lead the field to green. Teammate Kyle Busch will start in second, with Joey Logano third, non-Chaser Greg Biffle in fourth and Denny Hamlin in fifth. \nKurt Busch, Jimmie Johnson, Carl Edwards, Aric Almirola and Ryan Newman round out the top ten starters. \nWDUN will have live PRN Radio coverage beginning at Noon on 102.9 FM.
