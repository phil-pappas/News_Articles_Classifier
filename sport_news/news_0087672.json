While playing the Tigers to a draw in the first half tied at 1-all, Boonville came out and outscored Kirksville 5-0 in the second half for a 6-1 victory. While the win improved Boonville’s record to 12-5-1 overall and 9-3 in the NCMC, head coach Tim Brown said the team really had trouble finding their groove in the first half. “Again, we were tinkering with our formation in preparation for districts, but no matter what changes we made in the backfield over the past few weeks, we still are giving up soft goals,” Brown said. “In the second half, we returned to a system that we have been more comfortable with, and the game opened up quite a bit-after a 1-1 tie at halftime, we scored five unanswered in the second half.” Junior Alec Adair also added to his record number of goals for the season. While breaking Tyler Drew’s record last week with 30 goals, Adair tacked on four more Monday night-all of which came in the second half. Needless to say, the Pirates found themselves in for a battle in the first half as Kirksville actually came out and took the lead at the six minute mark on a goal from Matt Schwend to go up 1-0. However it was pretty much all Boonville the rest of the way while tying the game at 1-all at the 40-minute mark on an assist from Giovanni Strickland to Philip Udinyiwe. In the second half, Adair and company took over while scoring five unanswered goals within a 20-minute span. The go-ahead goal came at the 60-minute mark on an assist from Udinyiwe to Adair to make it 2-1. Three minutes later at the 63-minute mark, Udinyiwe picked up his second assists of the night on a goal by Brian Brown to extend the lead to 3-1. The rest were all by Adair, his second coming at the 70-minute mark on an assist from Brady Gholson. Then, at the 74-minute mark, Gholson and Adair would hook up again on a goal to add to the lead at 5-1. Meanwhile, at the 80-minute mark, Adair scored his fourth goal unassisted to round out the scoring. While dominating the second half against Kirksville, the Pirates also finished the game with 35 shot attempts and 11 shots on goal while the Tigers had 11 shot attempts and only four shots on goal. Boonville junior goalie Riley Lang also had three saves in the game. In the junior varsity match, Kirksville defeated Boonville by a score of 1-0. Page 2 of 2 - The Pirates’ JV, who ended their season at 2-5-3 overall, gave up the only goal of the night at the 17-minute mark. Brown said the basic trend of the season was that the JV team could play decent defense, but they did not possess the skill to score. “In fact, the JV squad only scored in two of their 10 matches, and in one of those matches, a varsity player was in the game because he was recovering from injury scored the two goals,”Brown said. Kirksville’s JV finished the game with eight shot attempts and five shots on goals while Boonville had only three shot attempts and one shot on goal. Boonville freshman goalie Lance Marshall also had four saves in the game. For the season, Luke Rehagen and Cristian Vivas each had two goals while Alec Tilman added one goal. Gabe Kaiser, meanwhile, had two assists on the season while Ryan Cramer and Trey Schler added one assist each. Lance Marshall also had two wins on the season while recording four shutouts as the goalie.
