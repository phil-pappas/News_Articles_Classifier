A video review confirmed Green had control of the ball and got a foot in bounds.\nBoykin threw for four touchdowns and a career-high 509 yards for TCU (4-0, 1-0). Doctson caught three touchdown passes and finished with 267 yards on 18 catches -- all career highs.\nGreen rushed for one touchdown, and the Horned Frogs got a safety in the first quarter after the snap went over Texas Tech quarterback Patrick Mahomes.\nMahomes, who was injured in the first quarter, completed 25 of 45 passes for 392 yards. He threw for two touchdowns and ran for another score for the Red Raiders (3-1, 0-1).\nTV/radio: FOX / WBAP-AM (820), KTCU-FM (88.7), KFXR-AM (1190)\nTCU\nClick here to visit the TCU page\nTexas Tech\nClick here to visit the Texas Tech page\nOn Twitter:\n @SportsDayDFW", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/SportsDayDFW", "http://dallasnews.stats.com/cfb/boxscore.asp?gamecode=201509260086&home=86&vis=85&meta=true", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/tcu-horned-frogs", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/texas-tech-red-raiders"], "published": "2015-09-24T20:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T02:40:27.216+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
