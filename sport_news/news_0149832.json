(Photo: Newsy ) \"Listen to this,\" KSAZ reporter Cory McCloskey said.\nDing, ding, ding. What do we have for him, Johnny? Well, embarrassment, for one thing.\nKSAZ reporter Cory McCloskey's fellow anchors laughed at him.\nHe had to get the sousaphone player to bend over. The reporter even had to lie on his back at one point.\nAnd look at the sousaphone player's face. Now, this picture is worth a thousand words ... or notes.\nOutlets couldn't decide if it was a sousaphone or a tuba .\n\"He lost his microphone in a tuba,\" Fox News reporter Steve Doocy said.\n\"Which is more embarrassing, to be the guy who dropped the mic, or the guy who knows the difference between a tuba and a sousaphone?\" Jimmy Kimmel said .\nActually, a sousaphone is a type of tuba. A sousaphone is easier to carry and is used for marching. Don't get too obsessed with the difference. Jimmy Kimmel will make fun of you. And don't drop a microphone in one. We'll make fun of you.\nThis video includes an image from Getty Images.\nTrending on Facebook\nBody of teen missing since 2008 found in chimney Miracle baby' missing part of brain, skull celebrates first birthday New mom touched by plane passenger's heartwarming act of kindness Bride's father stops wedding so stepdad can walk her down the aisle, too Picture of teacher walking children home from school goes viral More popular and trending stories", "external_links": ["http://time.com/4057927/fox-phoenix-cory-mccloskey-tuba-microphone/", "http://ftw.usatoday.com/2015/10/a-local-tv-reporter-dropped-his-microphone-right-into-a-tuba", "http://abc.go.com/shows/jimmy-kimmel-live", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LovWz0154KI", "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3256416/You-know-love-tuba-Reporter-hilariously-loses-microphone-student-s-instrument-live-TV-report.html", "http://www.foxnews.com/on-air/fox-and-friends/", "https://www.facebook.com/CMGNationalNews", "http://www.newsy.com/videos/a-reporter-drops-the-mic-in-a-sousaphone/&sa=U&ved=0CAUQFjAAahUKEwjtk5yGiaXIAhVRO4gKHaf7AF8&client=internal-uds-cse&usg=AFQjCNGHRNkFJdtwE_TbQIp4NUm6BoYxOg", "http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/lt/lt_cache/thumbnail/600/img/photos/2015/10/02/11/37/sousaphone.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-03T03:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T07:27:02.121+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
