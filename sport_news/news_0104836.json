McCaffrey's record performance leads... \nA source told ESPN on Saturday that Odom is \"way, way better\" and is more conversational after he was found unconscious at a Nevada brothel on Tuesday. \nOdom is breathing on his own and no longer has a breathing tube, ESPN reported Friday. He is wearing a breathing mask. \nAccording to ESPN, Odom slept most of the day Friday but did see his children, father and Khloe Kardashian, his estranged wife. \nOdom, 35, has been hospitalized since Tuesday after he was found unconscious at a brothel named Love Ranch in Crystal, Nevada, located about 80 miles outside of Las Vegas. He was placed on life support and was reportedly close to death. \nIn the 911 call released Wednesday, Love Ranch employees said Odom was unresponsive with a light red fluid and white matter oozing out of his nose after using cocaine and taking sexual performance supplements. \nFormer Rhode Island coach Jim Harrick -- who became a father figure to Odom when he coached him in college -- told USA Today that Odom is responding to communication from Kardashian. \n\"She reached down and said 'you know I love you' and he kind of nodded,\" Harrick said Friday. \"Three or four days after being scared to death and fearing the worst, that is a little hope, a little progress. She texted me that (information).\" \nOdom played 14 NBA seasons and finished his career in 2013. He won championships with the Los Angeles Lakers in 2009 and 2010.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T10:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T10:49:17.920+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
