No, no, no. I don’t know what’s going on, seriously,” Nadal told reporters. \n“We had the issue that we had in Hamburg, and that’s it. No problems. \n“At the US Open no problems. No problems today. Very easy match in terms of attitude for both of us. No problem at all. Very, very easy I think for the umpire.” \nFognini also said the Hamburg row was in the past, but indicated ill-feeling may remain against Nadal’s team and in particular his uncle Toni, who was seen angrily gesticulating courtside on Saturday. \nBoth players started Saturday’s match unconvincingly, suffering two breaks of serve each in the opening games, with Nadal also sending down three double-faults. \nThey steadied to take it to 6-5 for Nadal, but Fognini wobbled as he served to stay in the set, wilting in the rallies as he finally gave up the decisive break and smashed the ball into the stands in anger. \nThe second set was attritional until Nadal leapt ahead with a break for 4-2, and the suddenly invigorated Spaniard won the next game to love to stand on the brink of victory. \nFognini saved two match points before holding serve in a gripping eighth game, but by now the Nadal juggernaut was fully in motion and he ploughed across the line in the next game. \nIn the women’s semis, Timea Bacsinszky upset Ana Ivanovic 5-7 6-4 6-1, a result that will push her into the women’s top 10. \nThe 12th-seeded Swiss will next play Spain’s Garbine Muguruza, who beat Agnieszka Radwanska 4-6 6-3 6-4 to reach her second straight final after she retired from last week’s Wuhan title match.
