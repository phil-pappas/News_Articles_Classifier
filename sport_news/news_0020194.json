He being held without bail in the Clackamas County Jail.\nMeanwhile, police identified the victim as Timothy Scott Way, 55, of Beavercreek. Since 2013, Way operated Best Way Wash and Wax, a carwash and detailing business, at his home.\nSgt. Kyle Hove, state police spokesman, declined to release circumstances of the slaying or how Way died.\nTroopers were dispatched to the rest area along southbound I-5 (formerly known as the Baldock rest area) at 8:26 p.m. Monday to investigate a report of a man suffering traumatic injuries, said Hove said. Arriving paramedics were unable to revive Way and he was pronounced dead at the scene.\nStepina, a licensed tattoo artist, was convicted in Linn County in 2013 of menacing and unlawful possession of a firearm.\nHove said state police detectives worked on the investigation with the Clackamas County District Attorney's Office and the Clackamas County Medical Examiner's Office, Clackamas County Sheriff's Office, Oregon City Police Department and Milwaukie Police Department.\nThe French Prairie rest area was closed Monday night while police continued their investigation. It was reopened early Tuesday afternoon.\nThe rest area has a long history of high-profile incidents. In 2010, a citizen group lobbied to change the name from the Baldock Rest Area to the French Prairie Rest Area in hopes of shedding the bad reputation it had gained among travelers.\nIn 1995, a Colorado man was sentenced to five years in prison for robbing a motorist at gunpoint at the rest area.\nIn 2001, a Portland man was charged with sodomy and sexual abuse after he was found naked in a van with a 15-year-old boy.\nIn 2013, a Salem woman was arrested for filing a false report claiming she had been kidnapped and assaulted at the rest area.\nLast year, a Vancouver man committed suicide by shooting himself in the head.\nReporter Stuart Tomlinson of The Oregonian/OregonLive contributed to this report.\n-- Rick Bella rbella@oregonian.com\n503-294-5915; @southnewshound", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/southnewshound", "https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m18!1m12!1m3!1d2807.721945871422!2d-122.77549828701983!3d45.27363122412273!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x54956f320d93b4ad%3A0x7b4a83e26474b71!2sFrench+Prairie+Rest+Area+-+Southbound!5e0!3m2!1sen!2sus!4v1444741239777", "http://www.oregon.gov/osp/Pages/index.aspx", "https://tripcheck.com/Pages/RAentry.asp"], "published": "2015-10-13T21:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T06:14:22.052+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
