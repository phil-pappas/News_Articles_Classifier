Posted: Sunday, September 27, 2015 7:00 am Colts hope to begin turnaround against Titans By George Bremer | The Herald Bulletin Herald Bulletin Posted on Sep 27, 2015 \nINDIANAPOLIS â€” The Super Bowl talk has been silenced. The high-powered offense is stuck in neutral, or occasionally reverse. And a season filled with anticipation for the Indianapolis Colts is off to a dismal start. \nHeading into today's AFC South showdown at Tennessee (1-1), the team just needs a win. \n\"It's a tricky game,\" inside linebacker D'Qwell Jackson said. \"It's a new season every year, a new set of guys to get familiar with one another. It takes awhile to get going, and you never want to start off 0-2 in the hole. But we are. That's what the season presents itself with, and just like last year, we got to dig ourselves out of it. \n\"We got to focus on the day at hand. Sunday, when it comes around, getting a division win. That will get things going to get some of this stink off of us. Once we get one win and we get that confidence rolling, we'll start to string along some wins here.\" \nThe Titans would just as soon put that off for a few more weeks. \nTennessee opened the season with a blowout of Tampa Bay before falling against Cleveland. It now prepares for the home opener with a promising young quarterback in Marcus Mariota and a share of the division lead. \nNow there's a chance to knock off the two-time defending division champs and really get things rolling. \n\"They've won it two years,\" Titans head coach Ken Whisenhunt said. \"They've been to the conference championship. They're a good football team. In our division, certainly it would be a big win for us to be able to get one. But we haven't been able to do that in awhile. It's tough.\" \nThe Colts have won 13 straight games against division foes, the longest current streak in the NFL. And they haven't lost to Tennessee since the dark days of 2011. \nQuarterback Andrew Luck, who comes in reeling with just three touchdown passes and a league-leading five interceptions, is 16-2 against the AFC South. But Indianapolis isn't putting much stock in that history. \n\"Never,\" Luck said. \"Never in the NFL, you don't assume anything. Every year is so different, and every game is so different. That has no bearing on what'll happen this weekend.\" \nThe continual mistakes from this offense are another matter. \nThe Colts have turned the ball over eight times in two weeks, and they've wiped out a host of positive plays with penalties. The offensive line struggled against exotic blitzes by the Bills and Jets in the first two weeks, and they're likely to see more of the same from Tennessee. \nDefensive masterminds Ray Horton and Dick LeBeau are renowned for their ability to put pressure on opposing quarterbacks, and they've reunited with the Titans to form a defense that ranks fourth in total yards. \nIndianapolis' early game tape assures defenses will continue to be aggressive. \n\"It's a team game, and it takes all 11 every single play,\" Colts head coach Chuck Pagano said. \"You've got to be good up front. Communication has got to be there. Guys got to be on the same page. Guys got to make their blocks. We've got to firm things up, and guys got win on the outside. They've got to win their matchups because people are going to play tight coverage. We're going to see the same script over and over and over again until we put the fire out. You've got to make them pay.\" \nIndianapolis also continues to deal with injuries. \nTight end Dwayne Allen will miss today's game along with cornerbacks Greg Toler and Darius Butler. Outside linebacker Trent Cole also is out after injuring his knee during practice late in the week. \nCole's absence means Robert Mathis could get his first start since returning from a torn Achilles' tendon. The real concerns are in the defensive secondary. \nCornerback Vontae Davis is returning from a concussion, and he'll be backed up by Jalil Brown, Eric Patterson and newcomer Josh Thomas. \nAccording to Pro Football Focus, Brown was targeted nine times in his first start against the Jets. He allowed eight completions for 108 yards and one touchdown. \nPatterson was cut, re-signed to the practice squad and then elevated back to the 53-man roster after Sheldon Price was injured late in the week. And Thomas signed with the team on Tuesday. \nBut the Colts aren't wasting time worrying about things they can't control. \n\"They're not going to cancel the game,\" Pagano said. \"It's at 12 central, right? And they're going to kick the thing off. Whoever we got suited up, they're going to roll and they're going to play well.\"  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-27T14:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T13:46:05.944+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
