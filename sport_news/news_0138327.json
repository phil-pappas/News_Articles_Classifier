The Gamecocks (2-4, 0-4 SEC) are seventh in the SEC East heading into Saturday's game against Vanderbilt. \n\"It their turn to have a go at it. It's their turn to see what they can do,\" Spurrier said. \"That's simply it, right there. It's time for me to move on and time for South Carolina to start rebuilding a bit.\" \nSpurrier resigns with an 86-49 record at South Carolina and a 228-89-2 mark in 25 seasons as a head coach. He coached Florida, his alma mater, from 1990 to 2001 and led the Gators to the 1996 national championship and six SEC championships using his innovative \"Fun 'n' Gun\" offense. \nHe was named SEC coach of the year nine times. \nSouth Carolina president Harris Pastides said he asked Spurrier twice Monday to reconsider, but Spurrier declined. \n\"That doesn't work a lot,\" Spurrier said about finishing out the season. \"If the players know you're not going to be their coach after such and such a time, you just don't have the accountability. ... The team needs to hear a new voice, a new message from another coach.\" \nFormer players and coaches reacted to Spurrier's decision on Twitter. I'm proud to have played for one of college football's greatest coaches. Thank u for all u did for me + our program, Coach Spurrier #respect \n— jadeveon clowney 7 (@clownejd) October 13, 2015 Thank you coach! Your impact will live forever in this state. Your legacy will never be forgotten I promise you that \n— Marcus Lattimore (@MarcusLattimore) October 13, 2015 Coach Spurrier has impacted & influenced more of us in this business than he will ever know. He will be missed and will always be the \"HBC\" \n— Hugh Freeze (@CoachHughFreeze) October 13, 2015 Thank you, Coach Spurrier, for paving the way and showing us all what greatness truly is. #GoGators #HBC https://t.co/IHyB2loloX \n— Jim McElwain (@CoachMcElwain) October 13, 2015 \n\"I hate it for Steve and hate it for college football,\" Alabama coach Nick Saban told ESPN on Monday night. \"The guy's been one of the best coaches for a long, long time and a great personality for the game. I have a tremendous amount of respect for what he's accomplished and what he's done. ... It's always sad to see somebody who's meant so much to the game walk away.\" \nSaid Oklahoma coach Bob Stoops, a former assistant under Spurrier at Florida: \"He's probably the most competitive guy I've ever known, but he's also one of the most genuine guys I've ever known. He's special.\" \nSpurrier was close to stepping down at the end of last season, when the Gamecocks dipped to 7-6 after three straight 11-win seasons and three straight top-10 finishes, but he elected to return. The Gamecocks have lost eight of their past nine SEC games dating to last season. South Carolina coach Steve Spurrier is the Gamecocks' all-time winningest coach. He led the team to three straight top-10 finishes before last season. AP Photo/Wade Payne \nHe said this summer he planned to coach two or three more years, then extended that to four or five years when several recruits who had committed to South Carolina backed away before signing day in February. \nThen in July, Spurrier held a defiant news conference, telling Gamecocks fans not to listen to \"enemies\" questioning his commitment level, or implying he could no longer effectively coach at his age. \n\"We haven't lost it,\" Spurrier said prior to this season -- his 11th at South Carolina and 23rd in the SEC. \"We've got a dang good team.\" Steve Spurrier's SEC Legacy \nSteve Spurrier, whose 208 career wins are second only to Paul \"Bear\" Bryant (292) among SEC coaches, is the all-time leader in wins at both Florida and South Carolina.
