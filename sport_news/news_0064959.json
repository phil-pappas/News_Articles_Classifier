It was Hutchins' third sack of the season. Associated Press \nBobcats running back Chad Newell rushes forward against East Tennessee State. Newell scored three touchdowns in Montana State's 63-7 victory. \nBOZEMAN — Nothing about the outcome was unexpected. \nNo. 21-ranked Montana State had little trouble Saturday at Bobcat Stadium in a 63-7 drubbing of fledgling East Tennessee State. \nRunning back Chad Newell scored three touchdowns, quarterback Dakota Prukop threw for 226 yards before being replaced by back up Jake Bleskin with 10 minutes left in the third quarter, and the Bobcats’ defense, much maligned after a last week’s loss at Portland State, held the Buccaneers to 376 total yards. \nThe nonconference win improved MSU’s record to 4-3. The Bobcats, 2-2 in the Big Sky Conference, get back into their league schedule next week on the road at North Dakota. \nLinebacker Mac Bignell disrupted ETSU’s first offensive play, crashing into the backfield to drop running back Jajuan Stinson for a loss of two yards. The Buccaneers went three-and-out, punted, and the Bobcats took the lead on their ensuing drive when Newell scored uncontested from 1-yard out to go up 7-0. \nFrom there the rout was on. \nMSU implemented some lineup changes defensively, starting Jessie Clark at the “Bandit” defensive end position, and moving Zach Hutchins to weak-side linebacker. Overall, the Bobcats had four quarterback sacks 10 tackles for loss and four takeaways. \nReserve linebacker Robert Walsh had two fumble recoveries. \nThe only measure of success, coach Rob Ash said in the run-up to this game, was a victory. But what was the true barometer? \nAfter dropping its program in 2003, East Tennessee State is midway through its first football season in 12 years. An FCS independent visiting from 2,000 miles away in Johnson City, Tenn., coach Carl Torbush’s team started a combined 20 freshmen on offense and defense on Saturday. \nThe play that epitomized the mismatch happened in the second quarter on a throwback screen pass from Dakota Prukop to tight end Austin Barth. Barth caught the ball, turned up field and got behind left tackle John Weidenaar, who shoved cornerback Daren Ardis on his back with a textbook block. \nWeidennar, a senior, is 6-foot-7 and 295 pounds, Ardis, a sophomore, is 5-10, 166. It wasn’t even close. \nBarth got to the ball to the 9-yard line, and MSU scored a few plays later on a shovel pass from Prukop to Newell. \nIt probably won’t be that easy next week when Montana State travels to play Big Sky rival North Dakota. UND (4-4, 2-3) lost 42-19 at Montana on Saturday, but freshman running back John Santiago rushed for a 180 yards on just 22 carries – including an 80-yard touchdown on its first play from scrimmage. \nThe Bobcats were chewed up on the ground against their last legitimate FCS opponent, Portland State, and the outcome was a 59-42 loss. MSU’s defense, which came in ranked 118th out of 123 teams in the country, will again be in the spotlight leading into the matchup with North Dakota. \nPrukop only played about half the game against ETSU, but he and wideout Justin Paige continued their synergy. Prukop hit Paige with a 41-yard touchdown pass in the first quarter, and the duo connected again on a 51-yard pass in the second that set up another score. \nPaige is Prukop’s designated deep threat. Paige came into the game averaging more than 47-yards per catch. Paige has now made six consecutive catches of 40 or more yards. \nAnother speedy wideout, Jayshawn Gates, retuned a kickoff 97-yards for a touchdown in the fourth quarter. It was the second straight game the Bobcats returned a kickoff for a TD. Logan Jones brought one back 100 yards for a score against Portland State. \nNOTES: Montana State RB Nick LaSane blocked an ETSU punt in the first quarter. It was the Bobcats’ first blocked punt since Brady Daly had one in 2013 against Montana. … Sophomore Dylan Mahoney started at RG in place of Kyle Godecke, who sat out with a neck injury. … RB Gunnar Brekke was held out with a concussion, and LB Fletcher Collins missed his second straight game with a hand/thumb injury. … Safety Bryson McCabe returned to the lineup for the first time since a season-opening win against Division II Fort Lewis. McCabe had been out with a knee injury. \nCheck back later for updates.
