Sawyers msawyers@times-news.com The Cumberland Times-News Posted on Oct 18, 2015 by Michael A Sawyers \nThere have now been 31 bears killed on Maryland roadways this year, according to an unofficial count kept by the Cumberland Times-News. \nOn Oct. 6, a male bear weighing 169 pounds was struck and killed on Interstate 68 four miles west of Keysers Ridge. The sedan that struck the bruin was disabled, according to Clarissa Harris of the Maryland Wildlife & Heritage Service. \nOn Oct. 9, on state Route 36 in the area of Moscow, a 150-pound bear died. The condition of the carcass prevented wildlife officials from determining the gender of the animal. \nOn Oct. 14, a report was received that a bear had been struck and killed on I-68 at Friendsville, but a wildlife crew could did not find a carcass at that location. \nTo report bear incidents in Garrett County, call 301-334-4255. In Allegany County call 301-777-2136. \nMichael A. Sawyers is outdoor editor and reporter at the Cumberland Times-News.
