The Royals went on to win 4-3 to take the series in six games.\nToronto right-fielder Jose Bautista immediately claimed there was fan interference on the play. The Blue Jays asked for a review but the ruling was upheld.\nThe fan was identified by the Kansas City Star as 19-year-old Caleb Humphreys. He used his glove to catch the ball just as it approached the top of the wall. Television replays could not definitively show whether the ball would have cleared the wall or remained in the field of play had he not touched it.\n\"From where I was looking, my point of view, it seemed like the ball never left the yard,\" Bautista said. \"So the ball, I felt, from where I was looking, got pulled into the home run territory inside of a baseball glove that a fan owns.\n\"But I haven't seen every angle so it's hard for me to say that they made a mistake.\"\nKansas City will play the New York Mets in the World Series.\n———\nFollow @GregoryStrongCP on Twitter.\nReport Error Submit a Tip Refund Refund", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T06:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T13:59:07.707+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
