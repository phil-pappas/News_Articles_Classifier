Leading by just two, 16-14, at the half the Buccaneers offense went to work in the second half scoring 36 second half points to run away with the double-digit victory. The Bucs are now 5-2 on the year, and 2-1 within the division. They’re back in action next night hosting Woodbridge in the school’s Breast Cancer Awareness game starting at 7:30 p.m.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T07:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T02:11:22.565+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
