(AP Photo/Gary Wiepert) \nBUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) — The Buffalo Bills scrambled to make moves from across the Atlantic to patch up a banged-up roster on Tuesday. \nReceiver Marquise Goodwin was placed on the season-ending reserve-injured list, and the Bills signed offensive tackle Jordan Mills off of the Detroit Lions practice squad. \nThe moves were made while the Bills (3-3) spent their first full day in London in preparation for their game against the Jacksonville Jaguars (1-5) at Wembley Stadium on Sunday. The Bills had many injury concerns while traveling to England after their 34-21 loss to Cincinnati last weekend. \nGoodwin’s season is over after he hurt his ribs returning a kickoff in the second quarter. It’s the latest injury to the third-year speedster who has yet to play a complete season. \nMills was signed to add depth to an offensive line that could be without starting right tackle Seantrel Henderson, who sustained a concussion last weekend. \nMills was selected by Chicago in the sixth round of the 2013 draft and had 29 starts over the previous two seasons with the Bears. He was waived by Chicago in early September and then signed by the Lions. \nThe Bills have plenty of other concerns, particularly at receiver with the playing status of starters Sammy Watkins and Percy Harvin uncertain. \nWatkins hurt his left ankle while catching a 22-yard touchdown pass against Cincinnati, while Harvin didn’t play because of a hip injury. Backup receiver Marcus Easley’s status is also uncertain after he didn’t play against the Bengals because of a shoulder injury. \nThe Bills defense could be without starting lineman Kyle Williams, who hurt his left knee against the Bengals. \nAnd then there are questions over whether starting quarterback Tyrod Taylor will play after missing one game with a sprained left knee. \nBackup running back Karlos Williams has also missed two games because of a concussion. \nThe Bills hold their first practice on Wednesday, when coach Rex Ryan is scheduled to provide an update on his injured players. \nThe Bills also shuffled their practice squad roster by signing receiver Titus Davis and releasing quarterback Dustin Vaughan. \n___ \nAP NFL website: www.pro32.ap.org and www.twitter.com/AP_NFL Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T17:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T18:28:01.942+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
