The 6-foot-4 guard made 8 of 10 shots and was 13 of 16 from the free throw line. Matthew Dellevedova scored 13 points. The Cavaliers blew a 19-point lead. \n76ERS: Wilbekin's winner was his only shot attempt of the game. Jeremi Grant had 19 points and Nerlens Noel grabbed 10 rebounds. \nSTAR WATCH: Stars? What stars? LeBron James sat out. So did Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love. Same with J.R. Smith and Timofey Mozgov. The few fans sitting behind Cleveland's bench went wild when James took his seat just before tipoff. James mostly stood around with his arms folded during timeouts. \nSAY WHAT?: Allen Iverson, whose retired No. 3 hangs from the rafters, was interviewed from a seat in the suite. Iverson mumbled his way through the interview and was inaudible throughout the arena. Some fans booed. \nUP NEXT: Philadelphia plays Brooklyn on Saturday in Albany, New York. Cavaliers play Memphis on Monday in Columbus, Ohio. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T05:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T05:24:52.462+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
