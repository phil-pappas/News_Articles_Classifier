Reynolds Razorback Stadium in Fayetteville, Ark. (Julie Bennett/jbennett@al.com) (JULIE BENNETT) Comments \nStanton Truitt went down and Gray King stepped up. \nThe sophomore caught the first two passes of his career, including a ball that careened in the air as Sean White was drilled by an Arkansas defender, in Auburn's 54-46 loss at Arkansas in four overtimes Saturday. \nTruitt injured his right shoulder in the second quarter and his status for the Tigers' return home to Jordan-Hare Stadium against Ole Miss on Halloween is unknown. King may be counted on more next week after his 13-yard performance. \n\"We're getting kinda thin at receiver now and hopefully these guys can stay healthy the rest of the season,\" Auburn receivers coach Dameyune Craig said on the Tigers' post-game radio show. \nAuburn booted receiver D'haquille Williams from the team following a bar fight in early October. Ricardo Louis has since stepped up as Auburn's No. 1 receiver, and while he delivered three clutch catches for 60 yards to put Auburn in position for the game-tying field goal with four seconds remaining in regulation, he also dropped several passes, including a tough bobble in tight coverage on the final play of the game. \n\"These guys are working hard,\" Craig said. \"We have some young guys stepping up now and having to step up. Jason Smith did a great job going in and he made a couple of plays. That's what it's about. When your number is called, you have to be ready.\" \nAuburn dropped at least eight passes -- some were contested by defenders, but many were not. \nAuburn (4-3, 1-3 SEC) hosts No. 24 Ole Miss at 11 a.m. CT on Oct. 31.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T00:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T00:51:26.265+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
