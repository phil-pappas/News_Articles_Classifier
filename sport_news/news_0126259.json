Mayer, Donovan Olumba, Michael James & Malcolm Lee) J.J. Mayer's football life has gone full circle in a quick timespan. The Clarksburg native went from quarterbacking RCB's offense and defense to a 5-year collegiate career also splitting time on both sides of the ball at Fairmont State to a 1-year stay at Massachusetts' Stonehill College and now back to the Mountain State at Philippi's Alderson Broaddus University. As fate would have it, just two years into his current tenure with ABU, Mayer was promoted to the Battlers' defensive coordinator at the age of 27 in his third year with the program last fall. Mayer specializes in ABU's secondary. He had become offensive minded through his time with Byrd and FSU's signal calling duties, but used that experience to develop those opposing the QB. The Battlers rank 23rd in the nation in total defense, 46th against the pass surrendering just 175 yards a game. You could say great strides have been made in Philippi on the defensive end, but really it's more like a leap. ABU has risen from the dregs on a national level to not allowing an offensive point through the first eight quarters of the season.
