M's fire manager McClendon 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Seattle\nGiven the opportunity that he didn't get in his previous stop as a general manager, Jerry Dipoto decided the best move for the Seattle Mariners was to bring in his own field boss from the start.\nThat was the reasoning behind Dipoto's decision to fire manager Lloyd McClendon on Friday after two seasons. Instead of moving forward with someone who had differing baseball views, Dipoto will start his tenure in Seattle with someone he chooses.\nMcClendon's firing was far from a surprise after a disappointing 76-86 season. Seattle started the year with expectations of contending in the AL West and reaching the postseason, but instead finished in fourth place in the division.\nMcClendon was under contract for the 2016 season.\nDipoto said he has great respect for McClendon but realized in meetings this week and last that their baseball philosophies would not be the best match going forward.\nDipoto came to Seattle after leaving behind a rocky relationship with the Angels and manager Mike Scioscia over the summer. Scioscia was already entrenched when Dipoto was hired in L.A..\nThe Mariners said hitting coach Edgar Martinez and infield coach Chris Woodward have been invited to remain with the Mariners staff and Dipoto was hopeful both would accept. Pitching coach Rick Waits and coach Chris Prieto have been invited to remain with the organization in different roles. All other coaches on the major league staff will not return.\nMcClendon went 87-75 in his first season and missed the playoffs by one game. Seattle will have its 10th manager since the club's last playoff appearance in 2001.\nMets: Left-hander Steven Matz was added to the roster for the NLDS. Matz threw 80 pitches in an instructional league intrasquad scrimmage on Thursday to test his troublesome back. Matz said that he felt fine after Thursday's work. Matz was scratched from starts during the season's final week. Matz is likely to start Game 4 on Tuesday at Citi Field, if the series goes that far.\nPace of play: Commissioner Rob Manfred says it's \"not appropriate\" to enforce pace-of-play rules as strictly during the postseason. \"We are going to stay focused on pace of play,\" Manfred said, \"but in terms of the disciplinary aspects of the program, warnings and things like that, it's just not appropriate in the postseason.\"", "external_links": ["http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/34/42/8767677/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/34/42/8767677/3/920x920.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-10T06:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T08:21:05.977+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
