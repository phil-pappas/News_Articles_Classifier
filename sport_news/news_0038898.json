Most Read Stories \nBell took the direct snap, ran left and was slowed in traffic before diving for the end zone and getting the ball across the line as Donald Butler dragged him down. \n“I got to get it in,” Bell said. “We still had a timeout left. I was thinking ‘OK, maybe if I get stopped, maybe run like 4 seconds off and get a timeout and we could kick a field goal.’ I wanted to end the game right there.” \nBell said it was the most meaningful touchdown of his three-year career. “The game-winner on the last play of the game, that’s what you dream about,” he said. \nTens of thousands of Pittsburgh fans waving Terrible Towels roared as the Steelers improved to 3-2. San Diego dropped to 2-3. \nVick, having an awful game until the fourth quarter, kept the drive alive with a 24-yard scramble up the middle on third-and-six from the 41 and then a 16-yard pass to Heath Miller to the 1-yard line a play before Bell’s big run. He rushed 21 times for 111 yards. \nSan Diego’s Philip Rivers was 35 of 48 for 365 yards.
