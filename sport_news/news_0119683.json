And having wrested the initiative away from the tourists, SL then drove home their advantage as debutant Kusal Mendis justified the faith of the selectors with an entertaining innings of 39. Opener Dimuth Karunaratne was out first ball of the innings, caught by a diving Bishoo, after flicking uppishly off Taylor.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T16:34:06.909+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
