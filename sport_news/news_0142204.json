It would not have mattered if the Blue Eagles kept on winning. But following the loss to La Salle last Sunday, during which Ateneo blew a 15-point lead, his leadership has come under question. Maybe the criticism comes partly from having.\nIn that game, Ravena made just seven of his 24 shots and missed his final four shots. The last time a player other than Ravena took a shot was in the 2:34 mark, when Jerie Pingoy found a wide open Chibueze Ikeh to give the Blue Eagles a 76-74 lead.\nThat was the last time the Blue Eagles made a basket. La Salle scored six straight points to steal the win, 80-76.\nThere’s no questioning Ravena’s talent and willingness to win games. Time and time again, he has proven he could lift the team sometimes singlehandedly.\nBut right now, with Ateneo sporting a 4-3 card and tied for third-fourth place, he has to prove he’s an able leader, one who can win games for his team by not being the Lone Ranger but by also getting his teammates involved.\nIn the first half where the Blue Eagles dominated, they had a total of 15 assists, five from Ravena.\nThey only had seven in the next 20 minutes as La Salle stormed back from the big deficit.\nAsked about his shot selection late in the game, Ravena was unrepentant.\n“It’s not being a hero, it’s not wanting to be a hero but if we lose, we lose by me and my captains, Von and the other guys. Ayun, ganun talaga. I played the game with no regrets. People will give their own opinion about the game and I respect that,” he said.\nRecord shows that Ravena takes the most number of contested shots, hoisting a total of 123 shots. He made 32, good for just 26 percent.\nThe next player with the most number of contested shots is Jeron Teng, who had 101 but he had more success than Ravena, getting 42 of those 101 attempts to drop in.\nIn total, Ravena has just made 47 of his 143 attempts in the first round, good for 32 percent. Not necessarily MVP type of numbers.\n“I missed shots, so I guess something’s gotta give. We blew a big lead, we weren’t able to capitalize on the lead. I felt bad for myself not being able to lead the team, some of our guys it’s their first Ateneo-La Salle game,” said Ravena.", "external_links": ["http://i.po.st/static/v3/post-widget.js#publisherKey=4qcr4d26tnrf260rqrda&retina=true"], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T18:30:52.238+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
