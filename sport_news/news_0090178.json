Addressing the Royal United Services Institute, an independent think tank on defence and security, in London, Gen Sharif said the dispute between Pakistan and India “resides in the Kashmir issue”. Terming the Kashmir issue an unfinished agenda of Partition of the sub-continent, he said the world community must come forward to help resolve the longstanding issue if it wants genuine peace in the region, the Dawn reported today. The army chief claimed that Indian intransigence, violations of the Line of Control and indirect strategy against Pakistan were adversely affecting the region. Talking about the security situation in Pakistan, he said it was becoming conducive for upward economic trajectory. He said efforts would continue for peace in the country. Gen Raheel also talked about Afghanistan and promised to support all efforts for an enduring and permanent peace in the strife-torn neighbouring country. He also warned against detractors and spoilers of these efforts. “While we continue to support enduring and permanent peace in Afghanistan, let us all beware of detractors and spoilers,” he said. Gen Sharif is visiting Europe where first he addressed a security conference in Germany and then has been busy in Britain addressing conferences and meeting officials. — PTI", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T15:24:25.184+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
