Liverpool management moved swiftly to replace the Northern Irishman. This week marked the beginning of an era for the club. \nThe past few days shall always be remembered as the week Jurgen Klopp took charge of Liverpool and not as the week where Brendan Rodgers was dismissed. This simple fact implicitly says everything that you need to know about the Rodgers era. \nThe former Swansea and Reading boss oversaw a fairly long spell as manager of England’s 18 championship winning football club, but what is sad is that he has had no contribution to that long line of success. \nLooking back at his stint, it seems the main reason he failed was because the whopping majority of the players that he signed let him down big time. \nIn fact, the players that he signed were not capable of doing anything more than what they did. Most of these lads were Average Allen’s- I mean Joe’s- who Rodgers had immense faith in. The Northern Irishman’s transfer record speaks for itself. He’s spent 292m Pounds over a span of three and a half years to purchase 31 players. Seven of these lads were bought this summer, so it won’t be fair to judge them yet. \nOf the remaining 24 players, only two, namely Daniel Sturridge and Philippe Coutinho, can be classed as out and out successes. \nMahmadou Sakho, Emre Can and Simon Mignolet are three players who have done alright during their time at Anfield. \nAfter giving Rodgers the benefit of doubt, we find ourselves with 5 players who were signed by him and actually succeeded. The remaining 19 lads were flops of the highest order. It did not take a rocket scientist to figure out that Rodgers’ failure was due to the failure of the players he signed. \n“We brought in some new players that Brendan recommended that we thought would take us forward. We are where we are, I don’t want to say too much.” said Liverpool’s co-owner, Tom Werner after our last manager was sacked. \nThis admission from a man at the top of the Liverpool management has to be proof enough for anyone who still harbours doubts about why Rodgers was dismissed. \nFor all others though, it’s a sad sign of how such a successful and beloved club has regressed over the last three seasons.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T19:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T19:23:31.823+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
