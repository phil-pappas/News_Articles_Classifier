Button's two-year deal included an 'option' on McLaren's side for next season which it has decided to take up. \nIn the days before the Japanese Grand Prix the UK's Fleet Street newspapers reported Button was set to announce his retirement after growing frustrated with McLaren-Honda's difficult first season together. Button, who joined McLaren in 2010 as world champion, confesses he was weighing up that option before McLaren CEO Ron Dennis' determination to take the team back to the front convinced him to stay for another year. \n\"Over the past month or so I have done quite a lot of thinking, and it is no secret that I was at one point in two minds about my future,\" Button said. \"But I have been a McLaren driver for six seasons now [2010-2015], and in that time I have got to know Ron [Dennis] very well. He and I have had some very good chats these past few weeks, and during those chats it has become clear to me that Ron is both utterly determined and uniquely equipped to lead our team through its current difficulties to great successes in the future. That gives me great confidence, and it is for that reason that, together, he and I have decided to continue our partnership; and, as soon as I had made that decision, straight away I realised it was the correct one.\" \nWith five races left to run in 2015, Button says McLaren and Honda know where they need to improve in order to go into next season at full strength. \n\"Okay, granted, this year has not been an easy one for us, but we know what we need to do to improve things and, in collaboration with Honda, we will work extremely hard over the next weeks and months in order to make sure that 2016 will be a much better season than 2015 has been. I can't wait!\" I'm very pleased to announce I will be racing with #MclarenHonda in 2016. #dedication #believeinMclarenHonda üëçüèΩ https://t.co/Z3G6OmymmR \n‚Äî Jenson Button (@JensonButton) October 1, 2015 0 Shares", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T12:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T12:52:59.976+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
