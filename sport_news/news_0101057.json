(AP) - The city of Laconia has closed a 250-space downtown parking garage for repairs.\nPublic Works Director Paul Moynihan tells the Citizen ( http://bit.ly/1KQHdfr ) an inspection Monday found deteriorated ramps and cross beams. As a precaution, the city ordered the garage closed. He expects the work will take about four weeks.\nThe three-story garage, built in the 1970s, was upgraded in 1996; repairs also were done in 2005 and 2006. Moynihan says the latest damage was caused mostly by exposure to the weather and salt used during the winter.\nHe says the cross beams will need to be upgraded and steel plates put in.\nEnforcement of overnight and two-hour downtown parking restrictions will be temporarily suspended. Police will continue to enforce handicapped parking laws and restrictions on blocking crosswalks or fire hydrants.\nInformation from: Citizen, http://www.citizen.com\n ", "external_links": ["http://bit.ly/1KQHdfr"], "published": "2015-09-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T07:36:21.804+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
