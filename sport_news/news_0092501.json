After building an early 28-0 first-half lead off two Willard turnovers, Republic held off a furious comeback in the second to down the white Tigers 49-35. Jerney Jones and Riley Watkins led the Republic attack, combining for six of the orange Tigers' seven touchdowns. CLICK HERE FOR PHOTOS Republic head coach Wes Beachler utilized Jones often out of the backfield and, at times during drives, almost exclusively. Jones finished the game with four touchdowns and rushed for 203 yards on 25 attempts.\"We try to spread the ball around,\" Beachler said. \"But we always tell Jerney, 'If you're on and we're getting seams, we'll keep going to you.' He's a handful because he's kind of a blend of power and speed. If he gets to the edge, he could be gone, and yet he's not easy to tackle in between the tackles, either.\" Despite Jones' big night and Republic's early lead, Willard wasn't about to go away quietly. After all, the white Tigers also have a do-everything running back in Hunter Yeargan. The senior dynamo scored three touchdowns of his own during the third-quarter comeback and notched a game-high 253 yards on 31 carries. Following Yeargan's big quarter, Republic entered the fourth nursing a seven-point lead. Watkins opened the quarter with a 55-yard passing strike to Jones, stretching the Republic lead to 35-21. On the very next series, Willard answered right back with a long drive that ended with Nate Swadley's 2-yard plunge into the end zone. Following the opening fourth-quarter salvo, both teams traded a second set of touchdowns. With the white Tigers once again down just a single score, all the momentum seemed to be flowing back to the home team. Then Republic and Watkins landed what proved to be the game's knockout punch. After feasting off sweeps to Jones for most of the game, Watkins faked one and took off for the other sideline. The misdirection play caught Willard's defense unprepared, and Watkins raced down the sideline for a 66-yard score.\"Coach called a play he hadn't called on all night,\" Watkins said. \"and I knew the defense was going to flow hard. I picked up a big block from Bryan Cole, an amazing block, and that's what really set up that touchdown.\" Watkins' big play punctuated his own 177 rushing yards on the evening and left Willard with needing two scores with only 90 seconds left on the clock.\"They were really keying on Jerney there,\" Beachler said. \"And we thought that was a good play to go to. Coach Wolfinbarger, one of my assistants, made that call, and it was a great call on his part.\" Were it not for two costly turnovers, one which occurred on the Republic goal line, Willard might have enjoyed a different outcome. Despite the 28-point deficit, Willard was able to storm back and nearly tie the game up down the stretch. Head coach Brock Roweton was pleased with his team's resilience.\"Our attitude and mindset just got right in the second half,\" Roweton said. \"We did not look like ourselves in the first half. There was no wild discussion or speech at halftime, it was simply, 'Change your mindset, and we can get back into this.' We definitely did that, and I'm really proud of my guys' effort. Maybe now we realize what we can do, and hopefully we can just start like that from here on out.\" Both teams are back in action next week in Central Ozark Conference action. Republic (4-3) hosts Neosho, while Willard (4-3) travels to Branson.
