I have spoken to Gareth and Sergio and they are both fine and excited to play.\n\"They have been cleared to play, but match-fitness is another thing. Even at less than 100 percent they are two very useful players for us.\"\nRodriguez hasn't featured since being injured whilst on international duty with Colombia last month, but had been called up for their World Cup qualifiers against Peru and Uruguay.\nHowever, Benitez cast doubt on whether the 24-year-old would be allowed to travel to South America.\n\"He got a knock on Thursday and won't be ready for this game.\n\"The Colombian national team manager and doctor are in Madrid. He won't be ready for Sunday and almost certainly not to go with the national team either.\"\nMadrid lead Atletico by just two points after the first six games of the season and the biggest game of the La Liga campaign to date hands both a big opportunity to lay down an early marker.\nReal were thrashed 4-0 at the Vicente Calderon last season and haven't won a league derby for two seasons.\nAnd Benitez called on his side to match the intensity of Diego Simeone's side.\n\"We will approach the game with the idea of winning, but there are many different ways to achieve the result.\n\"We know it will be very difficult. We have to respond with character and personality, but try to play our football.\" ", "external_links": ["https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.toi.reader.activities"], "published": "2015-10-04T01:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T21:46:27.695+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
