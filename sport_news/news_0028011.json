Westin Graves lined up facing the south end zone prior to Mississippi State's matchup with Troy last weekend. He had made all six field goals he attempts during MSU's games this season. The sophomore missed the kick, the Bulldogs huddled and returned to the locker room. \n“He’s kicking the ball pretty confidently,” MSU coach Dan Mullen said. “You can tell that not so much in his makes, but his confidence in his misses.” \nGraves split the uprights with a 42-yard kick in the second quarter to pad MSU’s lead to 24-0. He hasn’t missed an attempt in seven opportunities this season as part of a revamped special teams unit. \nMississippi State began camp in August without a reliable kicker, punt returner and kick returner. \nAt the midway point of the season, Graves has been perfect, Fred Ross has a 77-yard punt return touchdown and Brandon Holloway returned a kick 100 yards for a score. \n“Those guys are a little more veteran players so they trust the scheme of what’s going to happen out there on the field,” Mullen said. “Both of those things are huge when you have a guy that has the ability to go score but also trusts the scheme that’s going on.” \nEvan Sobiesk was a reliable option as the team’s kicker last year. He made 12 of 14 attempts, but left the team in the offseason to pursue a career in dentistry. \nWill Redmond, Fred Ross, Cedric Jiles and Gabe Myles all worked out at punt returner through the spring and into the summer. Last year, Jamoral Graham was removed from the punt returning job after he mishandled punts in four straight games. \nRoss emerged from the uncertainty in the offseason with the starting role. He’s averaged 11.5 yards per return this season. \n\"He catches it most consistently,\" Mullen said. \"To be honest with you, when you look at the punt return game it’s as much lost yardage as it is gained yardage.\" \nRoss’ best performance came last week with a 77-yard return. Troy bounced low, line-drive kicks to the junior the rest of the game. \nHolloway has drawn the same respect from opponents on kickoffs. The junior is averaging 29.4 yards per kick return. \nRoss and Holloway receive the high-fives after the big returns. They’re veterans at the back end of a return group that includes a handful of freshmen. The old is mixing well with the new. \n“When you hit the home runs like that, it’s everybody understanding the scheme,” Mullen said. “It’s not just the one or two blocks at the point of attack, it’s the block 20 to 30 yards down the field at the end.” \nContact Michael Bonner at mbonner@jackson.gannett.com.
