(AP) â€” Kyle Lowry scored 25 points and DeMarre Carroll added 18 points and six rebounds in the Toronto Raptors' 105-97 preseason win over the Los Angeles Lakers on Thursday night. Kobe Bryant suited up for his third straight preseason game and scored 16 points at Citizens Business Bank Arena in just over 20 minutes of play, a number that coach Byron Scott said was predetermined. \"I told him I was going to play him until about the three-minute mark in the third quarter,\" Scott said. \"I'm very happy with what he was doing.\" The Lakers returned to California for their annual game in the Inland Empire after nine days of training camp in Hawaii. The 37-year-old Bryant said that after three exhibition games, he's starting to get in a rhythm. His last three seasons ended early due to injury, and he hadn't played since January. \"It's coming, it's coming,\" he said. \"I'm still taste-testing some things, but I feel great.\" RAPTORS: Lowry missed the Raptors' second preseason game with a sore right groin, but there was no indication of any lingering effects as he scored 14 second-half points, including nine straight in the third quarter. LAKERS: Lou Williams scored 19 points against his former team. Julius Randle added 17. MISSING: Lakers guard D'Angelo Russell sat out with a bruised glute. The first-round draft pick was hurt in Tuesday's preseason game, a loss to Utah in Honolulu. Brandon Bass was held out after MRIs revealed a bruised left patella. STAR WATCH: Bryant's line included three assists and three rebounds. Metta World Peace scored six points. UP NEXT: The Lakers will host Maccabi Haifa on Sunday night in their first preseason game at Staples Center. The Raptors return home to host the Minnesota Timberwolves on Monday night. ___ This story has been corrected to show that Carroll scored 18 points and Williams scored 19.
