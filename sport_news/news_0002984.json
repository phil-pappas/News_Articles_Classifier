But in what’s been a peak-and-valley-filled season for the Yankees, some still see reason to believe in them becoming the latest unlikely World Series champion.\n“I would not be shocked to see them go on a run,” ESPN analyst and one-time Yankees postseason hero Aaron Boone said.\n“Look, I think they have a ton of question marks and have a flawed team, but I think they have the makings of a team that could get hot with their offensive potential and that bullpen. Every team we look at that won the World Series or got to the World Series, one of the common threads is they had a bullpen that can shut down games, and the Yankees have that.”\nThe Yankees, who would have clinched a playoff spot with a win over the Red Sox on Thursday night, will in all likelihood start their postseason as wild-card hosts on Tuesday night with Masahiro Tanaka on the mound.\nBoone is proof of the bizarre nature of the postseason, as he is one of the most unlikely heroes in Yankees playoff history — his home run in Game 7 of the 2003 ALCS bolting the Bombers over the Red Sox and into the World Series. Raul Ibanez is also on that list. His three home runs in 2012 — the last time the Yankees were in the postseason — carried the team past the Orioles before it lost to the Tigers in the ALCS.\nAlex Rodriguez rounds the bases after homering on Wednesday night.

Bereswill Ibanez was a central figure in the A-Rod sideshow that postseason with the veteran providing a pinch-hit homer when manager Joe Girardi took out the scuffling Rodriguez in Game 3 of that ALDS.\n“I really remember how well Joe Girardi … you could never tell what was going on outside of that locker room by looking at him, how stoic he was through the entire postseason,” said Ibanez, now an analyst for Fox Sports 1.\n“It’s really incredible how he handled that and the in-game management of that. Even as a player at the time, when you get called on to pinch hit I understood the magnitude of the moment. Joe’s people skills are just incredible. I learned so much from that experience, and how he leads a team.”\nGirardi will have to find a way to pull the right strings with this Yankees team. There are issues at multiple positions and the skipper has desperately tried to find the right combination that will hit against lefty starters. But both Ibanez and Boone were encouraged by what they have seen from Rodriguez, who had been struggling before hitting his 33rd home run of the season on Wednesday night.\n“His bat speed is there, putting up quality at-bats,” said Boone, who will be calling Tuesday night’s game on ESPN Radio. “I think there’s reason to believe he can perform well. He could be impactful with what I’ve seen from his swing.”\n“The one thing that has been really impressive is his ability to go to the opposite field,” Ibanez said. “His swing looks more like his swing when he was younger. He’s got better balance and he’s getting through the ball significantly better and the ball is jumping off his bat to the opposite field. So any time you have that stroke in your back pocket, eventually you will be OK.”\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google Whatsapp Email Filed under alex rodriguez ,  joe girardi ,  mlb playoffs ,  new york yankees ,  raul ibanez", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T20:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T00:44:16.542+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
