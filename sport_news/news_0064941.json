But the physical toll of Saturday's game could go on for days as two of Miami's biggest offensive playmakers — quarterback Brad Kaaya and receiver Rashawn Scott — were knocked out of the game with injuries that could keep them from playing at Duke next week.\nKaaya, who entered the game as the ACC's passing leader, was sacked by Clemson's Shaq Lawson in the opening minutes of the second quarter. He was shaken up on the play and taken to the sideline where Miami's radio partner WQAM reported he failed concussion protocols.\nKaaya, who was 6-of-10 for 51 yards with an interception, did not return and after the game, Hurricanes coach Al Golden said he was unsure whether he or Scott would be available next Saturday.\nScott, who leads Miami's receivers with 35 catches for 467 yards, was hit in the shoulder and collarbone area early in the fourth quarter and managed to walk off the field.\nBut the redshirt senior, who has dealt with multiple shoulder and collarbone injuries during his Miami career, did not return.\nDave Hyde answers the question, 'will Al Golden be fired?' Miami loses to Clemson 58-0\nMiami loses to Clemson 58-0\nSee more videos \"I don't know,\" Golden said, when asked about Kaaya's health. \"The good news is he and Rashawn are good, in terms of health and everything. But it's too early to evaluate where they're at for next week.\"\nBackup quarterback Malik Rosier, who was pressed into duty after Kaaya got hurt, also struggled against Clemson's pressure. He was sacked twice and threw two interceptions, one of which was returned 34 yards for a touchdown by Tigers cornerback Cordrea Tankersley.\nAfter the game, Rosier said he had a chance to speak with Kaaya — his roommate and one of his best friends — and said the starter was in the locker room at halftime trying to encourage his teammates.\nHyde: Time for Miami to face truth on Golden Dave Hyde The University of Miami cannot go on with Al Golden. Losing is one thing. Losing in double digits, as Golden has 10 of the past 25 games, is another. And, then, of course, there is losing by eight TDs The University of Miami cannot go on with Al Golden. Losing is one thing. Losing in double digits, as Golden has 10 of the past 25 games, is another. And, then, of course, there is losing by eight TDs (Dave Hyde) \"We came in for halftime and he told me to fill his shoes and that's what I was trying to do,\" Rosier said. \"He's always been there, so it was nice to see him walking around the locker room.\"\nFor his part, Rosier said he plans to spend much of the next week preparing so that he'll be ready if Kaaya is unable to play against the Blue Devils and he is called on to make his first college start.\n\"I feel like I'll get more reps and [it will] help me get better chemistry with the receivers,\" Rosier said. \"There were a couple balls that were off. … I feel like we'll get our timing on time and we'll get better with our route-running and I'll get more accurate with the ball.\"\nPlayers say they still believe in Golden\nFor the seventh straight game, a plane towing a banner asking for Golden's firing flew over a UM game. As Clemson built a 21-0 first-quarter lead, many in the stands echoed that sentiment and began chanting \"Fire Golden.\"\nBut after the loss, several Hurricanes said they still had faith in their coaches and said they felt prepared to face Clemson, despite the lopsided score and the Tigers' dominant performance.\n\"We still believe in the coaching staff. We're still sticking by them,\" senior safety Deon Bush said. \"We obviously didn't play, we didn't execute at a high level.\"\nAdded Stacy Coley , \"We always believe. Coach Golden is the same guy every day. He's uplifting, he's the same guy every day. Yeah, we believe in him.\"\nVogel solid\nThere weren't many highlights for the Hurricanes in Saturday's loss, but punter Justin Vogel had one of the few plays that got fans in the stands cheering when he booted a 73-yard punt in the second quarter.\nIt was a career long for Vogel, who averaged 42.5 yards on 10 punts, and the longest punt since Pat O'Donnell hit a 71-yarder in 2013 against Virginia.\nccabrera@tribpub.com ; Twitter @ChristyChirinos\n Miami Hurricanes Clemson Tigers Duke Blue Devils Sun Life Stadium", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-562c0e42/turbine/fl-miami-hurricanes-news-1025-20151024", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-562bf80d/turbine/sfl-dave-hyde-answers--20151024", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-562c123f/turbine/fl-hyde-miami-clemson-column-1025-20151024"], "published": "2015-10-25T00:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T12:17:45.450+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
