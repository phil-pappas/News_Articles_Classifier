He was elected in August, defeating Sergei Bubka to succeed Lamine Diack. \nThe money is aimed at helping national bodies develop the sport in their countries. \nCoe says \"the IAAF must engage and work together with its members, listen to their needs and implement tailored solutions at a local and regional level.\" \nAll content copyright ©2015 Pendleton Times-Post, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T18:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T21:07:44.577+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
