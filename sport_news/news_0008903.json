That's what happened to a Toledo woman who is hearing impaired. 21-year old Nicole Gray was born completely deaf, but communicates just fine using a sign language interpreter.\nShe was very excited to start classes to become a medical transcription technician at Stautzenberger College this past week. Her mother Rebecca says she asked College admissions counselors if they would be able to accommodate Nicole's need for a sign language interpreter in her classes, and says they assured her they would. However when Nicole showed up for class, they were told they would be unable to provide any accommodations for her and that she should take classes on-line.\n\"I did everything on my part, and then I go to take my daughter to the first day of school and just nothing,\" says Rebecca Cummins. Nicole's sister Brittani says the Stauzenberger disability coordinator pulled her aside as she was bringing Nicole to class and \"She told me that they didn't have any accommodations for Nicole that night and they weren't going to have any for her at all,\" says Brittani. \"They told me it was too expensive for them to get any sort of accommodation for her besides just shoving her off into online classes.\"\nNicole's mother Rebecca says online classes don't allow Nicole to interact with the teacher and ask questions, \"If she does, than she's not with other people she's not getting the full experience that I want her to get on top of it all.\"\n13ABC asked Ability Center Executive Director Timothy Harrington where Nicole's rights lie. He tells us that the Americans with Disabilities Act covers her right to to request an interpreter if that's the way she communicates. \"Anything less and that's not a fair shake for her,\" says Harrington. Unfortunately, he says it may take a legal fight to get it, \"The amount of fighting involved. and the amount of attorney's fees involved could pay for the accommodation three times over,\" says Harrington. If that's what it takes, Nicole's family says they'll fight this, \"I don't want this to happen to another child,\" says Rebecca.\n</div> <div id=\"storyFeatures\" class=\"row-fluid\"> </div>", "external_links": ["http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?sz=640x480&iu=/301721715/WTVG&ciu_szs&impl=s&gdfp_req=1&ad_rule=1&vpos=preroll&env=vp&output=xml_vast2&unviewed_position_start=1&correlator=", "http://up.anv.bz/latest/scripts/anvload.js", "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/7B4/D4F/7B4D4FB32AFF4342AC40ECB9527325B5.mp4", "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/353*198/STAUTZENBERGER.JPG", "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/STAUTZENBERGER.JPG"], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T02:04:53.141+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
