(Bellator MMA) When it comes to mixed martial arts, San Jose continues to serve as Northern California's unofficial capital. Another fight card has been announced for the city, this one on Dec. 4 at the San Jose State Event Center and featuring Josh Thomson in the main event. \nThomson, a San Jose native with a 21-8-1 record in MMA competition, will meet Pablo Villaseca as part of a Bellator fight card broadcast live on Spike TV and staged by promoter Scott Coker. The show follows closely on the heels of a successful Sept. 19 Bellator event at SAP Pavilion in which Thomson, a 37-year-old lightweight, defeated Mike Bronzoulis in a third-round submission. \nThomson was the lightweight champion in Coker's previous Strikeforce promotion before it was absorbed by the UFC and seeks to earn the Bellator title. The Dec. 4 fight is considered a steppingstone toward that end. Villaseca, a 29-year-old Chilean fighter, has a 10-1 record \nThe co-headline event on Dec. 4 will feature featherweights Georgi Karakhanyan of Cucamonga and Daniel Weichel of Germany. Karakhanyan is the No. 1 contender for the 145-pound title. Tickets go on sale Friday at the Event Center Box Office as well as at Ticketmaster and Bellator.com .
