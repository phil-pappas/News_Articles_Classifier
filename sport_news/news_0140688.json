The meeting came two years after Germany had been awarded the World Cup by one vote in 2000. \nDer Spiegel reported last Friday that a slush fund of 10.3 million Swiss francs (about US$6 million at the time) was set up to buy the votes of four Asian representatives on the FIFA executive committee. \nAt a hastily organized news conference in Frankfurt yesterday, Niersbach repeated that Germany had done nothing wrong in bidding for the 2006 World Cup. \n“The key message is that everything was done with honest means for the 2006 World Cup bid. There were no slush funds, no vote-buying,” said Niersbach, who had denied the Spiegel allegations already on Monday. \nNiersbach said he visited Beckenbauer at his Austrian residence on Tuesday and learned about the deal reached between him and Blatter. \nFIFA was ready to finance the organizers to the tune of 250 million Swiss francs in return for a payment of 10 million Swiss francs, Niersbach said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T19:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T03:58:14.108+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
