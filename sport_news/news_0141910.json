His SportsWatch column debuted on Sept. email twitter \nThe Yankees did all they could last decade to build a new Yankee Stadium that looked and felt like old Yankee Stadium - with wider concourses and craftier beers, of course. \nMission accomplished. Then the team itself emphasized the point by winning the World Series in its first season there, just as it often had across the street.
