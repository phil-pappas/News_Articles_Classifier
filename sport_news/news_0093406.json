As a matter of policy, we do not further comment on pending proceedings.\"\nU.S. prosecutors in May indicted 14 soccer and marketing officials in the biggest corruption inquiry to hit FIFA in its 111-year history. Switzerland's Office of the Attorney General (OAG) is conducting a parallel investigation.\nThe OAG had by last month gathered around 11 terabytes of electronic data and 121 different bank accounts had been flagged for suspicious activity.\nThe OAG said in August it had received 103 suspicious financial activity reports for its inquiry.\nHandelszeitung said Swiss banks had reported suspicious activity by around 50 clients in the case.\n(Reporting by Michael Shields and Oliver Hirt; editing by Ralph Boulton )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T20:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T20:10:10.962+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
