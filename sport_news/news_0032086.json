I stand in this tank, which goes down to like minus-184 degrees Fahrenheit; it goes up to your neck and you're just wearing underwear and socks. It jump-starts your nervous system. I'll do a morning skate at the rink, then I'll do cryotherapy in the chamber, come home, eat, and go to sleep until I have to get to the game. That's pretty much my game-day routine.\"\nCryoUSA, which was recently seen on LIVE with Kelly and Michael, and The Dr. Oz Show, was formed to provide active recovery and unmatched customer experience to anyone seeking to improve quality of life and enhance an active lifestyle.
