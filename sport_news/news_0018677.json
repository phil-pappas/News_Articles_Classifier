They go four four Saturday.

We're preparing and starting to get in the zone, but still pretty relaxed about it.\" \nThe Arrows and Lexington have raced head-to-head four times already this season and competed at the same venue six times in 2015. Lexington won its own invitational 28-35 in August, but since then Ashland has beaten the Minutemen three straight times. Ashland was third in its invite and Lex fourth, 114-121, then at Galion, Ashland was 30 points better than their rivals. Last week at Harding, Ashland won with 46 points with the Minutemen scoring 57 points. \n\"Obviously they have two great front-runners,\" Weaver said of Lexington's Nick Stricklen and Ryan Johnston. \nBut senior Edmund Coleman and junior Andrew Stump are always right with them. \n\"We have an amazing group of five more guys back there that can run in front of Lexington and Wooster's fourth guy about,\" Weaver said of Ashland freshman Blade Estle, senior Adam Benway, junior Luke Gravitt, senior Eugene Cho and junior Alec Coleman. \"It comes down to everyone doing what they exactly are capable of and have done before. It's running together.\" \nWhile a four-peat is the first goal on the list, it's not going to come at the expense of the rest of the season. \nThe Arrows finished 10th at last year's state meet in Division I, and Weaver wants his runners primed for a possible top eight performance in 2015. \n\"My philosophy is early on we want to run well, but it's not our main concern,\" Weaver said. \"Even for conference, we're not looking to have our best day of the year.\" \nBecause the split Division I district at Oregon isn't stout, there is no fear of not making it to the Tiffin regional, so Weaver can train them through the districts with higher mileage and greater intensity before tapering them for regionals and state. \n\"I'm a firm believer if what we're doing is working, we don't change much,\" he said. \nFour of the top seven runners in the program have regional and state-meet experience, and Weaver called that a blessing. \n\"There's no real surprises there. They know what to expect and the right kind of mentality they need to have. They know what good things and bad things can happen,\" he said. \"I don't need to coach them up in a way because they kind of do it themselves because they've been through it.\" \nAnd they've successfully been through it the last three years at the OCC meet. \nrmccurdy@gannett.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T00:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T01:38:43.735+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
