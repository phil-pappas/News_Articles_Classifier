That would be the “ Northwestern basketball has never made the NCAA Tournament” fact/factoid/storyline/reference/allusion/mention/personal gag reflex at this point. The Chicago Cubs and Northwestern basketball athletics are closely linked. NU Athletic Director Jim Phillips is neighbors with Cubs Owner Tom Ricketts, and both sports franchises are partnered with WGN radio. Northwestern basketball Coach Chris Collins , a native of Chicago’s north shore suburbs, added a “Go Cubs” to his podium time at Big Ten Media Day. He also discussed the Cubs surge this season, in year four of Theo Epstein’s rebuilding plan. It wasn’t until year four that we saw finally saw progress in Epstein’s total tear down and then subsequent complete rebuild. However, once we saw progress in Epstein’s plan, it took off like a rocket. Year four saw 97 wins, and a NLCS appearance. Collins is entering year three at the helm of Northwestern basketball. “The best example I can use is what I see happening with the Cubs,” Collins said. “I don’t see the Cubs playing, feeling with 100 years of pressure on their shoulders. I see them playing with young exuberance and enthusiasm. If we go out and play with 70+ years of not going to to the tournament on our shoulders, we’re gonna crack.” “That’s not what I want for this team. They cannot have that on their shoulders. I want them to enjoy this process, and enjoy the hunt, the ups, the downs, and not feel like they have to live up to what has or hasn’t happened in our program’s history.” “It’s going to be difficult if we’re doing well, because the chatter will get more, and the questions will get more…The moment you start daydreaming to March, you come crashing down to reality quickly, and that’s my biggest fear with this team.” Collins doesn’t see the zero tournament appearances as a burden for his staff and players to carry. “We don’t talk about it a lot with our guys, but I think coming into the season, we did talk about the fact that it’s not on this current team’s shoulders to feel the pressure day in and day out of playing for however many years it’s been of going to the NCAA tournament.” \nCollins also said during his time at the round table that he would like to schedule a Northwestern basketball game at the United Center, once they get better. \nPaul M.
