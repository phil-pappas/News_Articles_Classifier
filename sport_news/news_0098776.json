I thought we pressured the puck and our puck pursuit was good.”\nNo. 20 Colgate (1-2-0) entered the contest with two games under its belt after splitting a pair at Mercyhurst last weekend. Yet it was NU which displayed the better early tempo.\nNU (1-0-0), which entered the season with questions about its goaltending situation with the graduation of Clay Witt, seemed to find the answer behind the superb play of junior Derrick Roy, who finished with 16 saves.\nThe middle period began with each team having a glittering opportunity. Roy made a dazzling glove save on Kevin Lough, while Colgate’s Charlie Finn (41 saves) responded by holding the near post to foil a shot by NU’s Mike McMurtry.\nNU broke the scoreless deadlock when John Stevens tipped home a blast from the right point by freshman Eric Williams at 12:09. Stevens dug the puck from behind the Colgate net and fed pointman Jarrett Fennell, who slid a pass to Williams.\nThe Red Raiders needed only 2:12 to knot the affair. Roy made a save under pressure, and Colgate winger Tyson Spink collected the rebound and beat Roy with a shot along the ice.\nThe third period featured a pair of defensive gems by the Huskies. Fennell sprawled to break up a 2-on-1 Colgate rush. Later, Roy stoned Red Raiders right wing Hunter Racine with the right leg pad.\nNU moved ahead at 11:48 of the third on a nifty solo rush down the slot by Nolan Stevens, who stickhandled through the defense and tucked the puck underneath Finn’s pads.\n“It was kind of a broken play in our zone and I got some speed and a great pass from (Colton) Saucerman. The defense sort of gapped and I got by one guy and ended up tapping it in,” said Stevens.\nUMass 4, Colorado College 3 — Shane Walsh scored twice around a Steven Iacobellis goal in the first 2:35 of the third period to erase a three-goal deficit, and Austin Plevy scored with 3:07 to play to give the Minutemen (2-0-0) a stunning comeback win over the host Tigers (0-2-0) in Colorado Springs, Colo.\nUnion 5, Boston University 3 — Charlie McAvoy scored his first career goal with 4:36 to play to tie the game, but Matt Wilkins potted one with 2:39 left in regulation to lift the Dutchmen (1-0-1) over the Terriers (0-1-0) in Schenectady, N.Y.\nQuinnipiac 4, Holy Cross 2 — T.J. Moore had a goal and an assist, and Tommy Nixon made 35 saves, but the host Bobcats (2-0-0) scored two power-play goals to beat the Crusaders in Hamden, Conn.\nMercyhurst 3, Bentley 2 — Andrew McDonald scored his second of the night to give the Falcons (0-2-0, 0-2-0) a 2-1 lead in the second period, but the Lakers (3-0-0, 2-0-0) rallied to the Atlantic Hockey victory in Watertown behind Josh Lammon’s game-winner with 7:30 to go.\nNew Hampshire 7, AIC 3 — Tyler Kelleher had two goals and two assists, and Andrew Poturalski added a goal and three assists as the Wildcats (1-0-0) had a big win over the Yellow Jackets (0-1-0) in Durham, N.H.\nMiami (Ohio) 3, Providence 2 — Trevor Mingoia had two assists, but the Friars (1-0-1) wrapped up their weekend series at the RedHawks (0-1-1) with a double-overtime loss in an exhibition 3-on-3 extra session, on a goal by John Melnick. Officially, the result will count as a tie.\nWomen\nLindenwood 4, NU 2 — Kendall Coyne tallied her seventh goal of the season, but the host Huskies (2-1-1) were stymied by Jolene deBruyn (38 saves) and the Lions (2-4-0), who got a hat trick from Shara Jasper.\nBoston University 3, Penn State 1 — Rebecca Leslie had a goal and two assists, and Erin O’Neil had 27 saves as the host Terriers (3-1-0) dispatched the Nittany Lions (1-3-0).\nHerald wire and staff reports contributed to this roundup.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T11:40:07.814+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
