In a shockingly tone-deaf press conference earlier this week, Hardy said he wanted to come back “guns blazing” and complimented Tom Brady for having an attractive wife.\nAdChoices In a passionate speech on Fox NFL Sunday , Terry Bradshaw condemned Cowboys owner Jerry Jones for giving Hardy a job and said he hopes players guilty of domestic abuse are eradicated from the NFL.\nPREACH TERRY: pic.twitter.com/89XvtLkynD\n— OHB (@ohholybutt) October 11, 2015\npic.twitter.com/3gW61IMfzC\n— OHB (@ohholybutt) October 11, 2015\n“Anybody, in my opinion, that lays a hand on a woman — I don’t care who you are my friend — you never come back in this league.
