We are taking extra precautions. We'll have extra water. We're going to provide more water stations.\"\nWorld Cup football officials shifted the 2022 event to November-December over major heat worries in Qatar, with air-conditioned stadiums under construction to ease fears the desert nation would be too sweltering.\n\"We're not air conditioning,\" said John Lelangue, technical operations director for the Doha 2016 cycling worlds.\n\"We're not expecting so much heat. We'll be top temperatures 34, 36, 38, 40 degrees. It will be hotter than in Belgium but we will have been racing all around the year in other countries. There are no worries in this regard. October is a nice month.\"\nWhile temperatures could rival those for European events in hotter months, there will be no mountain climbs on offer in Qatar, although brisk winds could foil the plans of sprinters on the flat course.\n\"Visitors can expect temperatures no higher than the Tour de France,\" said 70-year-old Belgian cycling legend Eddy Merckx.\nIn addition, men riders have competed in the Tour of Qatar since 2002 and women since 2009. The January-February timed event has slightly cooler conditions but plenty of familiar challenges like the wind.\n\"Unfortunately I can't do anything about the wind. It's part of the race. The wind is the wind for everybody,\" Lelangue said.\n\"It will be windy. It's not a sandstorm. The riders are used to riding there for 14 years. They will know what to expect.\"\nCourses for the 253km men's road race, 138km women's road race, 24km women's time trials and 40km men's time trials include trips into the desert and around the man-made island \"The Pearl\" to show Doha's modernity as well as culture and traditions with city skyscrapers in the background at the finish line.\n\"It's an honor the world governing body has trusted in us to host,\" Al Thani said. \"We're confident we can host some exciting races.\" ", "external_links": ["https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.toi.reader.activities"], "published": "2015-09-25T15:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T00:23:22.361+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
