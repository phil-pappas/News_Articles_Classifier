And often, that impact isn’t truly appreciated until years after graduation. \nThe goal of any great high school coach isn’t to just make his or her players better athletes, but better people. They push their students to achieve their best, whether it’s on or off the playing field. \nWhen I think back to my high school cross country and track coach, Jim McCullough, I’m reminded of how I was more afraid to show my report card to him than I was to my mother. \nMom would see a B in geometry, and think “good job.” Coach would see that same B and would ask me to explain, in detail, why I didn’t get an A. \nSo this week we celebrate the successes of three long-tenured area coaches in particular who have made great impacts on young people in Southwest Washington, knowing far too well that there are many, many others doing great work. \nThe first is Jeff Nesbitt, longtime volleyball coach at Woodland High School. On Tuesday, during the Beavers’ home match against Washougal, Woodland will celebrate Nesbitt’s 30 years of coaching, including the past 22 at Woodland, and all of his accomplishments. Former players are expected to attend to celebrate this milestone anniversary. \nThe next coach is Columbia River tennis coach Jim Chapman. During his many years at River, Chapman has been a jack-of-all-trades coach. He spent 29 seasons coaching wrestling at River, six coaching football and the past 25 coaching tennis. \nBut on Wednesday, Chapman will coach his final league dual match. The match at River will be an appropriate one, as the Chieftains will face Prairie, which has its own longtime coach in Chris Linquist. This will be the final meeting of teams coached by both Chapman and Linquist in their long rivalry. \nAnd, I can’t forget my good friend George Konzek, the boys golf coach at Evergreen. Konzek, who has also coached wrestling and gymnastics in his three decades as a middle school and high school math teacher, is also retiring at the end of the school year. So this week’s 4A district tournament — which is Monday and Tuesday at Tri-Mountain Golf Course — will be Konzek’s final one leading the Plainsmen. \nSo it’s a great week to celebrate coaches in Southwest Washington, and the victories they earn every day that will never show up on a scorecard. \nTim Martinez is the assistant sports editor for The Columbian.
