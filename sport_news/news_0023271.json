Striped bass are still absent from the mix. Big blues, porgies and blackfish are biting on the inshore wrecks. Offshore in the canyons, yellowfin and longfin tuna are biting well. Many state rivers and streams are now stocked with trout. \nHOT BAITS: Small Ava-17’s are a good slim profile metal lure to cast to false albacore that will imitate the small rain baits that are present in the ocean. \nHOT SPOTS: Inshore ocean waters from Monmouth Beach south to Deal have had a good concentration of rain baits with small blues and false albacore on them in the last week. Look for these pods in about 45 feet of water. \nANNOUNCEMENTS: Through Wednesday, fall trout stocking, no closed dates.
