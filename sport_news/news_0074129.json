Posted: Sunday, October 18, 2015 12:00 am Gridiron Greats:North Andover's Hartford restarts ROTC program at Macalester Gridiron Greats Michael Muldoon Eagle-Tribune \nMacalester was there for Glen Hartford and Glen Hartford has been there for Macalester. \nMidway through his junior year at North Andover High, he tore his ACL. Early in his senior season, he tore his other ACL. \nMost of the schools who were recruiting the promising linebacker abandoned ship. \nNot Macalester, a top academic Division 3 school in St. Paul, Minn. \n“I was reaching out to schools,” he explained. “I knew I wanted to play football and I knew I wanted a great education.” \nNow a junior, the 6-0, 223-pound linebacker has surprised even himself by starting from the get-go for the Scots. \n“I had my chance and I took it,” he said. \nHe was the fourth leading tackler with 48 as a freshman and last fall helped lead the Scots to their first title in 67 years with 52 tackles, 6.5 tackles for loss and 4 pass-break-ups in a 9-2 campaign. \n“It was an amazing story,” he said. “It was an incredible feeling.” \nWith all his injuries, Hartford appreciates where he is now. \n“It’s tough on your body. I’ve definitely thought about hanging up the cleats,” he said. “But I love the sport. I wouldn’t want to give it up for anything.” \nHe wears braces on both knees but health problems continue to follow him. He missed this year’s opener after tearing his meniscus early in the preseason. \n“The injuries are always going to be there,” said Hartford. \nThe Scots were 2-3 heading into the weekend. Hartford has contributed 14 tackles with two tackles for a loss and two pass break-ups in four games. \nStarts ROTC program \nWhile not on scholarship, he’s getting more money than a lot of bigtime players. His ROTC scholarship (3.5 years tuition and some sizable stipends) is valued at $215,000. \nThe small liberal arts school’s ROTC program had been disbanded but Hartford helped get it going again. \n“Me and my mom talked to the University of Minnesota and Macalester,” he said. “It just took time. Both sides were eager to have it happen.” \nOriginally, he was Macalester’s only ROTC student but in the spring of his freshman year Grace Dickman joined. They both travel to nearby University of Minnesota for classes and training. \nStill more bad news \nMacalester wasn’t in the original plans for the oft-injured Scarlet Knight linebacker. \n“I always wanted to do something in the military,” said Hartford, who was also a lacrosse captain at North Andover High. “I was planning on the Coast Guard. But March in my senior year I was disqualified for color vision deficiency. I never knew I had it growing up. It was heartbreaking.” \nA military career always seemed in his future. \n“I always knew from a young age I wanted to do something in the military,” said Hartford, a geology major with a GPA slightly above a 3.0. “I always loved reading books on World War II and I loved ‘Band of Brothers’ and ‘Saving Private Ryan,’ they were very influential.” \nWell rounded linebacker \nFootball, academics and ROTC make for a jam-packed schedule for most mere mortals. \nHartford manages to cram in even more. \nHe didn’t have a singing background but joined the Chromatics a cappella group on campus. \n“It’s definitely tough, not having a lot of time,” he said. “I don’t get to sleep a whole lot. You sacrifice. It’s 4 or 5 hours sleep 3-4 nights of the week. It’s a struggle, for sure.” \nIn a February story written by Macalester student Eliza Ramsey, Scots coach Tony Jennison said, “His greatest gifts are his work ethic, desire to do his very best and the way he treats other people. He treats people very well, it’s because they trust him, because they believe in him they will follow him. He’s a very strong young man in a lot of ways — mentally, physically. He’s special. He stands out.” \n... \nE-mail Michael Muldoon at mmuldoon@eagletribune.com . \nABOUT ROTC PROGRAM \nPosition: He’s training to become an Army officer, second lieutenant. \nCommitment: The program requires an 8-year commitment: 4 years active duty then 4-year Reserve or 8-year National Guard or Reserves. \nScholarship: 3.5-year tuition scholarship and pay/stipends at Macalester totalling $215,000. \nWeekly schedule: Two 90-minute classes and a 3-hour lab (hands-on training) Sign Up / Sign In With your existing account from... {* loginWidget *}", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T07:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T04:10:39.091+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
