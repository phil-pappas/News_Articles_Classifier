After a while I started to realize how much I wanted to coach varsity again,\" Nelson said. \"It's not something that's super new to me - I last coached varsity in 2013 - but it's going to be something I'm really excited about.\" \nWhile Cedar Grove High School Principal Rick Mangili was involved in the hiring process, it was Athletic Director Rob Gogerty who did most of the \"leg work,\" the principal said. \n\"He has my support and confidence in his decisions,\" Mangili said. \"Nelson had most, if not all of these kids in middle school because he's the P.E. teacher there, and he coached the American Legion team this summer.\" \nNelson, Gogerty and Mangili sat down after the summer season for an interview, Nelson said. \n\"We spoke and I guess we hit it off pretty well,\" Nelson said. \"I know Rob from teaching with him before he became the athletic director, and Mr. Mangili is a really good guy and a straight shooter. I like that.\" \nNelson took over the summer American Legion baseball coaching duties from former varsity coach Mike Valanzano this year, who was relieved of his position following the 2015 season and stepped down from coaching the summer team, according to a previous report in the Times. \nThat experience seemed to solidify his qualifications for the position, Nelson said. \n\"I think coming in and having a decent year helped a little,\" he said. \"I think it let them know that I can work with that group of kids. A lot of them are kids I've taught in class over the years - the seniors were the only group I didn't teach.\" \nFor the next step, Nelson said he will sit down with Gogerty to select the rest of the coaching staff, which is expected to change entirely. \n\"I have an idea where I want to go with one spot, but the other two are up in the air,\" Nelson said. \"I'm just really happy for the opportunity. It's something I think I'm ready to do and I'm ready to go.\" \nAdditional reporting by Sports Editor Zach Gewelb. \nEmail: moroses@northjersey.com Â© 2015 North Jersey Media Group Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T19:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T02:32:59.853+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
