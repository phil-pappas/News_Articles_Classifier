Hunter Shinkaruk netted a hat trick, scoring once in each period, to lead the Comets to the win. \nAmerks goaltender Linus Ullmark stopped 43 of the 46 shots he faced in the loss, giving him a total of 81 saves on 85 shots (.953 save percentage) in two games against Utica this season. Jason Akeson and Jerome Leduc each scored their second goals of the season for Rochester, while Cal O’Reilly earned an assist in his return to Utica, where he served as team captain last season. Chad Ruhwedel also collected an assist. \nShinkaruk’s hat trick was supported by 12 saves from goalie Joe Cannata and an empty net goal from Alexandre Grenier as the Comets won their home opener for their first victory of the season. \nA slashing penalty to Rochester’s Matt Donovan 1:39 into the contest would prove costly for the Amerks as Utica capitalized just 25 seconds into the man-advantage. Shinkaruk weaved his way through the Rochester defense and beat Ullmark with a wrist shot to the top of the net to give the Comets an early 1-0 lead. \nThe Amerks responded midway through the opening frame on a snipe from Akeson, who picked the upper left corner moments after a clean face-off win from O’Reilly. The Amerks captain won the draw squarely back to a waiting Akeson and he let loose a shot that sailed past a screened Cannata to make it a 1-1 game at 10:38. \nThe penalty trouble continued for Rochester in the waning minutes of the second period and the Comets would capitalize again with Shinkaruk grabbing his second of the game. Shinkaruk completed the hat trick at 6:46 of the third period, converting a Nicklas Jensen rebound from the top of the crease to put Utica up 3-1. \nLeduc scored his second of the season on the power-play to bring the Amerks within a goal, but Grenier sealed the win for Utica by scoring into an empty net with just two seconds remaining. \nThe Amerks return home on Friday, Oct. 23 when the longtime rival Toronto Marlies make their way to Rochester for a North Division showdown at The Blue Cross Arena. The 7:05 p.m. contest will be the first of eight scheduled meetings between the two teams this season and will be broadcast live on FOX Sports 1280 Rochester.
