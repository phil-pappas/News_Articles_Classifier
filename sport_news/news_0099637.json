(AP) - A small Louisiana Indian tribe says money offered to settle its lawsuit against BP PLC and others for the Gulf of Mexico oil spill is not enough to clean up and monitor tribal lands. So the 680-member Pointe-au-Chien (point-oh-shyenh) tribe is continuing with its lawsuit against BP, Transocean Ltd. and Halliburton Energy Services.\nAttorney Joel Waltzer tells The Courier ( http://bit.ly/1Zs2JRF ) that the tribe was offered less than $75,000. He says that's too little to cover its costs so far.\nThe tribe is also accusing BP of failing to produce reports on confidential cultural information and historic sites that tribe members shared with the company. The suit alleges that such anthropological and archaeological reports would have helped the tribe's push for federal recognition.\nThe tribe is recognized by the state.\nInformation from: The Courier, http://www.houmatoday.com\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
