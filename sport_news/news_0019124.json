The team announced that Rose should be able to resume basketball activities in two weeks. The Bulls open their regular-season schedule on Oct. 27 against the Cleveland Cavaliers.\nThe injury occurred while Rose, the 2011 NBA Most Valuable Player, was driving to the basket on the baseline and took an elbow to the face from one of the Bulls' big men. Rose will be sidelined for a portion of the first training camp under Hoiberg, who was hired during the summer to replace Tom Thibodeau. It's likely that Rose will wear a mask when he returns.\n\n---In an effort to streamline the replay review process, the NBA announced Wednesday that current referees will be assigned to the replay center to make rulings on out-of-bounds calls, shots at the end of a quarter, shot clock violations on baskets, goaltending and several other plays.\nThe NBA Board of Governors unanimously approved the instant replay modifications on Wednesday that will be implemented at the beginning of this season. Referees on the court will still be in charge of requesting reviews, but the officials in the replay center will take over administration of specific calls to help preserve the flow of games.\nReplay review will determine outcomes in the following instances: two-point/3-point field goals (made shot or foul); made basket at the end of quarters; out of bounds; shot clock violations on made field goals; goaltending/basket interference; clock malfunctions (non-foul or non-violation involved); 24-second shot clock resets and the number of players on the court. On-court referees will rule on flagrant fouls; clear-path-to-the-basket fouls; off-ball fouls; player altercations; fouls at the end of quarters; shot clock violations involving foul calls; the correct free throw shooter; clock malfunction situations (foul or violation involved) and restricted areas.\n\n---Cleveland Cavaliers point guard Kyrie Irving and power forward Kevin Love , both still recovering from injuries, are unsure when they will fully return to the court.\nThe Cavs announced in late April that Love's recovery time to repair a dislocated left shoulder was four to six months. Love missed most of the Cavs' run to the NBA Finals after suffering a dislocated shoulder in the playoffs.\nIrving, who sustained a fractured knee cap in Game 1 of the NBA Finals against the Golden State Warriors, was expected to need three to four months to recover.\nCavaliers general manager David Griffin said there is not a definitive timeline and there is no rush to get both stars back for games.\n  Butler guides Chicago Bulls past Minnesota Timberwolves NBA Game Summary - Minnesota at Chicago Derrick Rose, Pau Gasol return as Chicago Bulls edge Jazz Bulls' Rose out with knee soreness", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T00:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T04:37:30.093+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
