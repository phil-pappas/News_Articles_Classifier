The result was a 2-0 win for the Lumberjacks, as the Pirates couldn’t quite get one into the back of the Lumberjack goal, and while the Pirates held the Lumberjacks off the scoreboard for a half, they couldn’t hold them off in the second half. “Possession was almost 50/50,” head coach Don Cox said. ”They spent a lot of time in our half and were passing well, but we had our chances too.” In the first half it was the Elijah Phaiah show, as the Pirate goalie was all over the place, stopping ten Lumberjack shots, and drawing the praise of both his coach and his teammates. “To steal a phrase from my players at the half, ‘he was on fire,’” Cox said. “He made some amazing saves and had a really good game.” In the second half, Bemidji went ahead when Phaiah came out to shut down an attack, but the Bemidji player managed to slide the ball to his left foot and put the ball past the Pirate goalie in the 48th minute. Nine minutes after that, the Lumberjacks got a free kick just outside the 18-yard box, and a bit of confusion and a quick take put Bemidji up 2-0. From there the Pirates had a couple chances, but couldn’t keep the ball low enough to hit the target, hitting a couple shots over the bar, and falling by a final score of 2-0. The Pirates have dropped two in a row after starting 8-1, but have a chance to bounce back with a pair of games Friday and Saturday. “We’re looking for a couple wins,” Cox said. “The boys are confident, and all set to play with the intensity that they brought the last couple of games.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T17:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T18:11:40.453+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
