AL DIAZ adiaz@miamiherald.com i Order Reprint of this Story \nA day after the University of Miami’s worst football loss in history, the University of Miami has fired coach Al Golden. \nMiami athletic director Blake James announced Sunday evening in a written release that he “has relieved Head Football Coach Al Golden of his duties effective immediately’’ and that assistant coach Larry Scott will serve as the interim head coach for the remainder of 2015. \n“Coach Golden has led our program through some very difficult times and he has done so with class, integrity and a true desire to see our students succeed on the field, in the classroom and in the community,’’ James said in the release. “However, we have a proud tradition of excellence at Miami, not just in football but in all sports, and we want to compete for ACC and national championships. I simply believe that now is the time to bring the Hurricane Family together and rally behind our young men.’’ \nGolden was fired in the middle of his fifth season at UM and finished 32-25. The program has been going downhill for years, and Saturday night’s 58-0 loss on national TV – the largest margin of error in UM’s 90 years of football – was the final dagger for Golden. \nThe Canes are now 4-3 and 1-2 in the Atlantic Coast Conference, and don’t have much chance of even winning the Coastal Division in the ACC, their foremost goal this season. \n“On behalf of my family I want to thank the University of Miami for a tremendous opportunity,’’ Golden said. “I believe in what we are doing and how we are doing it and we have some outstanding young men in our football program. Though this moment is difficult, we wish the Canes the best of luck going forward.’’ \nScott is the tight ends coach and run game coordinator, and spent the eight previous seasons at USF. \nMore coverage \n▪ Two lines here to colfootru here here here, XB \n▪ Two lines here to fiufolo here here here, XB \n▪ Two lines here to fsufolo here here here, XB Related content", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T01:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T01:41:28.521+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
