(Ross D. Franklin / Associated Press) Associated Press \nHouston Astros left-hander Dallas Keuchel (20-8) will face New York Yankees right-hander Masahiro Tanaka (12-7) when the teams meet Tuesday in the Bronx in the American League wild-card game. \nKeuchel, the only 20-game winner in the AL this season, is leading the Astros into their first postseason appearance since 2005, when they won the National League title and lost to the Chicago White Sox in the World Series. \nTanaka made only 24 starts this season because of a hamstring injury that forced him to the disabled list. \nThe winner of the game will face the Kansas City Royals in a best-of-five series starting Thursday. \nJohn Farrell to return as Red Sox manager \nJohn Farrell will return next season as manager of the Boston Red Sox, the team announced. \nFarrell, 53, recently completed his final course of chemotherapy for non-Hodgkin lymphoma. He left the Red Sox on Aug. 14 after being diagnosed. \nThe club also gave Torey Lovullo , Boston's bench coach who had a 28-19 record as interim manager while Farrell was out, a two-year contract extension through 2017. Lovullo waived his right to pursue managerial openings. \nFarrell was hired as Boston's manager in October 2012 and led the Red Sox to a World Series title in his first season. He signed a two-year contract extension in February through the 2017 season with the club holding an option for 2018. \nFarrell has a 246-243 record with the Red Sox, who finished 78-84 and last in the American League East this season. They are having consecutive losing seasons for the first time since 1993-94. \nBoston did not renew the contract of first base coach Arnie Beyeler . Third base coach Brian Butterfield will return along with hitting coach Chili Davis and pitching coach Carl Willis . \nNationals to make a decision on Matt Williams soon \nMike Rizzo , general manager of the Washington Nationals, said that a decision about Manager Matt Williams' future with the team will be made soon. \nRizzo said the club is \"not going to let people twist in the wind\" and the organization wants to begin preparing for 2016. \nThe Nationals were a World Series favorite going into the season. They were eliminated from playoff contention last weekend and finished 83-79, seven games behind the National League East champion New York Mets. \nRizzo said members of the team's front office will meet as early as Monday. \nWilliams guided the Nationals to an NL East title last season and was the NL manager of the year in his first season on the job. In February, the Nationals exercised the option on his contract for 2016. His deal also includes a team option for 2017. \nPat Murphy won't return as Padres manager \nThe San Diego Padres said that interim Manager Pat Murphy won't lead the team next year. \nMurphy took over in mid-June after Bud Black was fired. San Diego was 42-53 under Murphy and finished fourth in the National League West at 74-88, 23 games behind the first-place Dodgers. Murphy was manager of El Paso, San Diego's triple-A affiliate, when he moved up. \nIchiro Suzuki pitches in with Marlins \nIchiro Suzuki hit 88 mph and induced a swing and miss with a breaking pitch during a one-inning relief appearance for the Miami Marlins in their regular-season finale against the Philadelphia Phillies. \nThe 15-year veteran and 10-time outfield Gold Glove Award winner had never pitched in a major league game before the bottom of the eighth inning Sunday. He gave up a leadoff double to Odubel Herrera , who scored on a double by Darnell Sweeney . \nAfter throwing mostly fastballs to the first few hitters, Suzuki mixed in an upper-70s breaking pitch to Freddy Galvis , inducing an awkward whiff with his first one. \nSuzuki gave up one run and two hits with a ground out and two fly outs.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T03:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T12:46:48.778+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
