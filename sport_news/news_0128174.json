In a 41-14 loss to Buffalo in Week 3, Tannehill threw three interceptions, including a pick-six. \nIn an effort to build Tannehill's confidence after that game, Philbin tried something different.\nAccording to the Houston Chronicle 's Aaron Wilson (via the National Football Post), Philbin told the Dolphins' practice squad players to go easy on Tannehill so the quarterback could get some of his confidence back. \nApparently Tannehill was throwing so many interceptions in practice that he was getting frustrated to the point where he would talk trash to certain practice squad players after they picked him off. \n\"Enjoy your practice squad paycheck, enjoy your practice squad trophy,\" Tannehill would say, according to Wilson. \nIf the plan was to restore Tannehill's confidence, it didn't work. The Dolphins quarterback threw two more interceptions in Miami's 27-14 loss to the Jets on Sunday. \nTannehill wasn't the Dolphins' only issue in practice last week. According to the Miami Herald , Ndamukong Suh wore tennis shoes to a full-padded practice on Thursday and many players took that as a sign that Suh was unhappy with the team's defensive coaching staff. \nThe bottom line here is that interim coach Dan Campbell is going to have turn things around quickly, which is exactly what he plans on doing. \nDuring his introductory press conference on Monday, Campbell said he needs to change the team's \"culture.\"\n\"There may be some things that need to be moved and shuffled, I have to sort those things out, but we have enough to win. We have to change the culture. I have to change the culture,\" Campbell said. \nWhen it comes to changing the culture, the new coach will probably want to start with Suh and Tannehill. \n\nRyan Tannehill's confidence hasn't been sky high lately.
