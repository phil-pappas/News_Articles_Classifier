Fan A says something to Fan B, Fan B doesn’t like it, and before we know it, Fans A, B, C, D, E, F, and G are in a big pile in the middle of the screen going at it.\nThis fight, which took place at the Mexico/U.S. CONCACAF match over the weekend, takes a turn for the worst at around the 15-second mark, though, when a female fan starts striking a male fan while he’s on the ground. The guy appears to shove her back and then gets into it with one of her female friends as hell breaks loose around them.\nFortunately, it doesn't look like there were any really big punches landed by anyone—and security broke up the fight quickly. But still, this all seemed very unnecessary.\n .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T02:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T07:38:47.080+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
