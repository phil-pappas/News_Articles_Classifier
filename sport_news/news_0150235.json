(Photo: Advertiser file photo) Buy Photo \nAfter playing three games in 12 days, Teurlings finally had a regular week with a regular Friday night game after beating a physical Breaux Bridge team Thursday. \nTheir reward? The chance to host Catholic of Baton Rouge, a similar hard-nosed, grind-it-out team and one of the better Class 5A teams in the state. \nTeurlings coach Sonny Charpentier said even though the Bears are 2-2, their record is deceiving after losing by only one touchdown to two of the best teams in the state. \n“But this is the best team that we’ve played so far. We’re going to have to play very well,” Charpentier said. “They play good sound defense and their special teams is outstanding. \n“They’re 2-2, but they could easily be 4-0 they lost to two quality football teams by one touchdown.” \nCharpentier said the Bears are similar to both Notre Dame and Breaux Bridge in that they have a physical defense that they pair with a strong running game that emphasizes ball control. \nIn their win against St. Thomas More last week, the Bears held the ball for twice as long as the Cougars. \nCharpentier said the Rebels’ ability to stop the run and generate stops on defense would be key to his team’s chances. \n“They’re going to try to do the same thing. They are going to try to keep the ball away from us,” Charpentier said. “But we’ve got to stop the run; I don’t care who you’re playing, you have to stop the run to get the ball back.” \nOne of the things that makes the Bears rushing attack so strong is their wide receivers’ willingness and ability to block on the outside, Charpentier said. \nThe Rebels will have to shed their blocks not only at the line of scrimmage, but also in the secondary to effectively stop the Bears running game. \nCharpentier said after starting slow the last couple of weeks it would be important for the Rebels to come out firing against the Bears to gain some confidence. \n“I think it’s crucial to play well early and get some confidence and hopefully get a break or two, a turnover or two or a stop,” Charpentier said. “Whatever it takes we’re willing to do. But confidence-wise we want to play well early and we haven’t done that in the last couple of week so it’s important this week to get off to a good start.” \nThe Rebels will be without both of their starting wide receivers after Jacob Richard was injured in the Breaux Bridge game. Hayden Cantrelle is still recovering from an injury sustained earlier in the season. \nEvan Huesers and Holland Griffin will be forced into the starting role and both have made plays for the Rebels when called upon this season. \nHuesers made a couple of catches on the Rebels game-winning drive against Breaux Bridge and Griffin had a nice grab against Notre Dame two weeks ago. \nCharpentier said both Noah Harris and Jansen Lormand would also be bigger parts of the passing game out of the backfield, but would still need the outside guys to make plays when called upon. \n“We’ll have to be a little more creative getting (Lormand and Harris) involved,” Charpentier said. “But ultimately those other guys are going to need to make plays too because sooner or later the defense is going to figure it out.” \nGame: 7 p.m., Friday at Teurlings \nRadio: \nLast game: TC beat BBHS 14-7; Catholic beat STM 35-17 \nLast year: Catholic 9-1, TC 8-1 \nPlayers to watch: TC - Justin Murray, DB; Jansen Lormand, RB (13 receptions, 126 yards, 2 TDs); Holland Griffin, WR (4-80, 1 TD); Catholic - Zach Toms, OL; Clyde Edwards-Helaire, RB; Lawrence Hamilton, FB \nSchedule \nTeurlings \nSept. 4 beat Calvary Baptist 45-28; 12 beat Archbishop Shaw 37-23; 18 lost Notre Dame 28-23; 24 beat Breaux Bridge 14-7; Oct. 2 Catholic; 9 Northside; 16 Beau Chene; 23 St. Thomas More; 30 Carencro; Nov. 5 Opelousas \nCatholic \nSept. 4 lost Parkview Baptist 33-26; 11 lost Zachary 41-26; 18 beat Sam Houston 47-7; 25 beat STM 35-17; Oct. 2 Teurlings; 9 East Ascension; 16 Broadmoor; 23 St. Amant; 30 Dutchtown; Nov. 6 McKinley Read or Share this story: http://www.theadvertiser.com/story/sports/high-school/football/2015/10/01/teurlings-faces-another-tough-test-catholic-br/73166880/ TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T06:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T13:32:21.833+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
