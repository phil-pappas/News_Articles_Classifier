He unleashed a few good slapshots and took some contact that would lead you to believe that he is indeed on the verge of a return.\nOn the other hand, his defense partner for much of the practice was Colin Miller, another scratch from Thursday night's game, which doesn't exactly make a return Saturday night against the Canadiens seem all that likely.\nBut as we've come to know about these day-to-day injuries, we'll have to wait and see.\n“I'm pleased that it's getting better and every day it's getting better,” said Chara. “Again, I wish I could give you more info or go further beyond tomorrow. But as of right now, I'm just waiting for tomorrow and I don't want to have any setbacks, so if it keeps going like this, I'm pretty close.”\nThere is surely a greater appreciation for what Chara brings after Friday's 6-2 shellacking at the hands of Winnipeg. Chara did enjoy watching it, either.\n“It's always hard to watch when you're not playing, no matter what,” said Chara. “But I think we did some good things as well. We've got to take the positive out last night's game and obviously improve on the things we could have done better. I don't think any team is perfect st this point of the season. We know we've got to keep getting better and keep improving and working hard.”\nAfter some video work to dissect the lopsided loss and an on-ice session of about 45 minutes, coach Claude Julien put the defeat in perspective.\n“It is just one game. We're fortunate enough to play 82 of them,” said Julien. “I just look back to the Patriots last year when they played Kansas City and the whole world fell apart because of that. People thought it was going to be the end of their team and sure enough they bounced back. I'm not trying to compare our team to the Patriots. I'm just saying it's one game. After the first game of the season you don't have to be assessing that it's going to be that way the whole season. I think we have a good group of guys that's going to get better. I think we played well enough yesterday in the first. If we can maintain that type of play, we may be a good team. We just have to focus on getting better and building on those foundation blocks and get better.”\nThough he said he could shuffle his lines for Saturday's match against the Habs, the forward combos and defense pairs were pretty much the same as the start of Thursday's game, with Max Talbot and Ty Randell rotating into the fourth and third lines, respectively.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T21:39:08.140+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
