It involves trying and failing to cut back on texting, becoming defensive when challenged about the behavior and feeling frustrated when one can't do it,\" Lister-Landman explained in a journal news release.\nGirls don't text more often than boys, but they text for different reasons, the study authors noted.\n\"Borrowing from what we know about Internet communication, prior research has shown that boys use the Internet to convey information while girls use it for social interaction and to nurture relationships,\" Lister-Landman said.\n\"Girls in this developmental stage also are more likely than boys to ruminate with others, or engage in obsessive, preoccupied thinking, across contexts. Therefore, it may be that the nature of the texts girls send and receive is more distracting, thus interfering with their academic adjustment,\" she noted.\nWhile the study shows an association between compulsive texting and poor school performance, it doesn't establish a direct cause-and-effect relationship. And the authors acknowledge that texting can benefit teens in various ways.\nU.S. teens send and receive an average of 167 texts a day, according to 2012 Pew Internet and American Life Project study.\nMore information\nCommon Sense Media has more about teens and social media .\nCopyright Â© 2015 ", "external_links": ["http://images.worldnow.com/Revenue/images/275529_G.jpg", "https://www.commonsensemedia.org/social-media/age/teens/", "http://www.healthday.com/"], "published": "2015-10-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T02:39:48.762+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
