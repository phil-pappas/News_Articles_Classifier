(AP) - Mississippi Gov. Phil Bryant has nominated Brandon High School principal Buddy Bailey to the state Board of Education.\nBailey will serve several months while awaiting confirmation by state senators in 2016. That's common practice for people nominated to state boards while the Legislature is not in session.\nBryant chose Bailey on Friday to serve the final eight years of a nine-year term started by Richard Morrison, who is leaving the state board and stepping down from the job as an assistant superintendent of Rankin County schools. A new superintendent has been elected in Rankin County.\nMorrison's seat on the nine-member board must be filled by a school administrator.\nBailey has been Brandon High principal since 2008. Before that, he was principal of Brandon Middle School, starting in 2000.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
