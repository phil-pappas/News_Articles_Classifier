It's a sad situation to be a part of, just to see the whole story of where he was as a player, as a person, and where he is right now.

At times, he sacrificed other things in life to do for everyone else.

It's sad in a way. He's someone with a heart of gold. And right now he's fighting the battle of his life. We should all be cheering him on in our thoughts and prayers.\"\nOdom, 35, hasn't played in the NBA since 2013, though he was officially on the Knicks' roster for the final day of the 2013-14 season. He reportedly had been talking about making a comeback.\nSaid Fisher: \"From a basketball standpoint, he was an amazing teammate. Really an amazing player that possesses all the skills necessary to do everything on the floor you need done. I think his defense and rebounding was more spectacular than anything he can do on the floor offensively. Really as close to one of the top reasons as to why we won championships in '09 and '10 because of him.\"\nNotes & Quote: s: Kristaps Porzingis (quad) did not practice Wednesday.
