Marquez had to retire from the race after the collision. \nRace officials said Rossi, 36, will have to start from the back of the grid in Valencia. \nLorenzo said Rossi received a slap on the wrist because of his teammate and rival’s superstar status. \n“If it was another rider, he may be punished much harder. I did not expect this to happen. I am disappointed,” he said. \n“It think it is unfair. Valentino got 16 points and Marquez got nothing. I cannot believe anyone will do this kind of thing.” \nLorenzo, who has steadily whittled away at Rossi’s championship lead, is now just seven points back. \nPedrosa started from the pole position and never relinquished the lead for Honda. \n“It was a fabulous race but I was not aware of the problems behind me,” he said. \nHe clocked 40 minutes 37.691 seconds – 3.612 seconds ahead of his fellow Spaniard Lorenzo, and 13.724 seconds faster than Rossi. \nLorenzo had begun from the second row, and 11 points behind Rossi for the world championship, but he burst ahead into second place on lap 2 and held it the rest of the way. \nLorenzo, 28, seeking his third world title, had earlier gained ground on Rossi in the Australian Grand Prix, finishing second, to the Italian’s fourth place. \nRossi and Marquez waged a tense, see-saw fight for third. \nSeeking to bulldoze his way past Rossi on lap 7, Marquez crashed into the right side of the Italian’s bike. \nThe incident happened on a corner just after Rossi appeared to taunt Marquez, gesturing at him to open up his throttle. \nRossi has nine career world titles, but has yet to win since 2009. \nLorenzo and Marquez have rubbished Rossi’s allegation that the two Spaniards colluded during the Australian Grand Prix, where Marquez won and Rossi managed only fourth place.
