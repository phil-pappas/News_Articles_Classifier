The trip to the mountains starts with coffee in darkness. There are miles to go before the sun rises. At 4:30 a.m., it’s drizzling in Jamestown and there are two hours before any hint of dawn. Highway 120 is slick, and Old Priest Grade is open. Forecasters say thunderstorms are likely over Yosemite this morning. By 7 a.m., first light silhouettes cloud-shrouded, 13,053-foot Mount Dana, the second-highest point in Tuolumne County. A still pond reflects this headwater source for Tuolumne Meadows and the Tuolumne River. It’s less than 40 degrees Fahrenheit. Thirty minutes later on the rocky eastside of 9,941-foot Tioga Pass, direct sun is breaking through more clouds to the east. Brisk winds ripple the surface of a glacial lake and a reservoir below. Quaking aspens near streams are yellow and orange below jagged rock ridges far above. There’s rain on Highway 395 north of Lee Vining. By 9 a.m. there are more pockets of yellow and orange foliage before Bridgeport. Further up the road in Walker the weather has cleared for the moment. The Andruss Motel has a sign that says “Welcome El Nino Rain.” A strong smell of wet rabbit brush and sage hangs in the air, stirred up by earlier rainfall. “That’s the smell of the Antelope Valley, the Great Basin, when it rains,” Andruss owner Mary Dayhoff says. “We were saying the same thing this morning.” Past Coleville in Topaz, elevation 5,033 feet, Highway 89 heads west and uphill toward Ebbetts Pass and Markleeville. The road winds upward into the 27-square-mile Washington Fire burn. Lightning ignited the blaze in early June near Monitor Pass, and it burned within three miles of Markleeville, according to the Forest Service. The blaze was declared out cold in mid-August. Steep, charred watersheds are dark in the rain and cloud cover before 11 a.m. At Markleeville General Store, employee Amy Pedroli said post-fire rains unleashed charred soil and rock that closed the road for a short time. “We had mudslides and all kinds of fun stuff,” said Pedroli, who’s lived in Markleeville eight years and worked seven years at the store. “We had a lot of rain before it and after it. Just for a short time they closed it. Right around the fire time.” Asked about weather and traffic on the 89 and up Highway 4 to Ebbetts Pass, Pedroli said the first snow of the season generally comes around Halloween. “It’s a beautiful drive,” Pedroli said. “I’m not saying it’s better than any other pass. It’s a beauty of its own.” Spells of steady rain continue through noon. Rocky wilderness and the road are soaked at 8,730-foot Ebbetts Pass in a light drizzle. Brad Arnold, 27, and Emily Arnold, 26, of Walnut Creek, said it was their first time driving east over Highway 4. “We’ve been up in the Sierra mountains before but never along this Ebbetts Pass here,” Brad Arnold said. “You’ve got these steep grades, winding road and single-lane. It’s different.” Brad Arnold is a PhD student at University of California, Davis, and a researcher with the Center for Watershed Sciences. He says he has experience with GEI Consultants of Rancho Cordova, working with agricultural agencies in the Central Valley. “The developments of El Niño are certainly promising,” he said. “There is a correlation with precipitation events. Whether or not those are enough to pull us through the drought it will certainly help … It’s a great thing to see the precipitation already.” More rain falls from Mosquito Lakes to Lake Alpine. Before 2 p.m., it is still drizzling in Bear Valley, elevation 7,030 feet, in Alpine County, just east of the Calaveras County line. The Bear Valley ski resort and other winter sports in the area are considered an economic engine for the Highway 4 corridor into Angels Camp. Paul Petersen, 57, said he’s lived in Bear Valley 40 years. He owns Bear Valley Cross Country & Adventure Company and volunteers with the sheriff’s search-and-rescue team. Bear Valley is home to Bear Valley ski resort, which employs about 350 people each winter. “In the winter there’s 200 homes that are snowbound,” Petersen says. “I live in a snowbound house. The only way to get around is snowmobile. We have a system where we can respond to sheriff’s, fire and medical emergencies with different snow vehicles, including a snow cat, a tractor that is designed to go across snow. It has rubber and steel tracks and 3-foot-long paddles.” The last four winters, Bear Valley has been snowbound. But snowpack has been 1 to 3 feet deep, compared with the last wet winter, 2010-11, when Bear Valley got 600 inches total and snow was 10 to 12 feet deep in places. “There are 14,000 homes between here and Murphys,” Petersen said. “Those are vacation homes that a lot of people use for skiing and snowmobiling.” Snow affects restaurants, gas stations, from Angels Camp to Bear Valley, he said. “That’s thousands of jobs, not just the 350 people that work at the ski area in the winter, and an extra hundred or so that work here in the village.” Farther down Highway 4, by 2:30 p.m., rains have ceased and sun is breaking through the giant sequoias at Calaveras Big Trees State Park. For the 48-hour period beginning at 5 p.m. Friday and ending at 5 p.m. Sunday, Ebbetts Pass received 2.5 inches of rain, Bear Valley received 2.33 inches, Calaveras Big Trees State Park received 2.54 inches, Sonora Pass received 1.2 inches, Pinecrest received 0.96 inch and Cherry Valley received 0.91 inch, said Karl Swanberg, a forecaster with the National Weather Service in Sacramento. Drier and warmer conditions with breezy north winds are expected today in the Mother Lode. The warming trend is expected through mid-week, with dry weather continuing.
