Spain's Jorge Lorenzo dominated Friday's combined free practice on his Yamaha despite hazy weather conditions ahead of this weekend's Malaysian MotoGP. \nThe two-time world champion outperformed Italy's Valentino Rossi by setting a blistering pace at the 5.5-kilometre Sepang International Circuit track, and in punishing heat, posting a best lap of two minutes 00.246 seconds. \nDeploying extreme lean cornering techniques, the 28-year-old Lorenzo was 0.669sec ahead of team-mate Rossi, the championship leader who hopes to win his 10th career world title in Sunday's Malaysian GP at Sepang. \nChallenging closely were Honda riders: Spain's Dani Pedrosa was second quickest, at 0.047sec off the pace, while team-mate and defending world champion Marc Marquez, who won in Sepang last year, was third fastest at 2:00.472. \nItalian Ducati rider Andrea Iannone was fourth, but was 0.240 down on Lorenzo's time, while Rossi was fifth fastest at 2:00.915. \nOnly Rossi and Lorenzo can win this year's MotoGP crown as it heads into the two final rounds of the season. \nAdding to the drama, crowd favourite Rossi only holds a slender 11-point lead at the head of the championship table over his old rival Lorenzo. \nA classic battle erupted between the two Yamaha riders to top the timesheets during the morning practice, but a calm Lorenzo managed to dominate both sessions. \nIn order to win the title in Malaysia, the 36-year-old Rossi will need to increase his lead in the championship to at least 26 points. \nRossi, the oldest rider in the MotoGP entry list, risks a world title showdown in the season's final race in Valencia on November 8 if he does not grab the title in Malaysia. \nIf Rossi goes on to capture the crown this season, the Italian will be the second oldest title winner since the world motorcycle racing championship started in 1949, when 38-year-old Briton Leslie Graham won the inaugural 500cc crown, race officials said. \nSepang is one of the season's most demanding circuits, but is also Rossi's favourite track as the Yamaha racer has won six times here in the premier class. \nTemperatures can soar well above 30 degrees Celsius at the circuit, which lies outside Kuala Lumpur and is one of the longest in the season. – AFP, October 23, 2015. \nShare with others", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T11:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T12:24:39.186+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
