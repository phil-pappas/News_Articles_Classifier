Potential reached. \nIn Coshocton's 39-34 win against undefeated Meadowbrook, the Redskin offense that was searching for an identity this summer finally found it. \nThe Redskins (5-2) totaled 354 yards of offense and it didn't take long for them to get going. \nMeadowbrook scored to start the game, putting Coshocton in a 7-0 hole with 10:44 to go in the first quarter. But the offense responded in 59 seconds with a touchdown and though the extra point was no good because of a high snap that drive set the tone for the entire night. \nAnd that tone all started up front with the offensive line. The same offensive line: that returned only one starter and has had to move players to new positions. \nThey were opening up holes for backs Jake Fortney — who finished with 133 yards rushing — Spencer McCrea and Zach Michael, and when quarterback Andrew Mason stepped back to pass he had time to throw. It was almost perfect for most of the first half. \n\"Everybody worked their butts off all summer. We got a little scared there at the beginning when we lost two games, but now we are starting to click and hit our peak,\" Mason said. \nIn the first half the Redskins scored on four of their six drives, which included a good mix of the run and pass. Fortney had two touchdown runs, Mason had two touchdown passes to Michael, and Michael scored another one on the ground. \nThe half also included a pass from tight end Dallas Griffiths to wide receiver Miles Hardesty for 43 yards. Everything was clicking offensively. \n\"The offensive line did a really nice job pushing the pile,\" Fortney said. \"I think getting some work on the outside opened up the inside some more. All the backs were running hard, all the lineman were pushing. Everybody worked as hard as they could.\" \nWhen Mason connected with Michael for the second time with 26 seconds left in the half, it looked as if the Redskins would go into the break leading 24-14, but then the defense made a play. \nDallas Griffiths came off the edge and forced Meadowbrook quarterback Konnor Roberts to fumble and Kobie Means picked it up and ran it back 20 yards for the touchdown. That gave the Redskins some cushion going into the break leading 30-14, which they would need as they clock ticked down. \nIn the second half the offense slowed down and that's when the defense stepped up. But they couldn't hold a talented Meadowbrook offense down the entire half, as Roberts connected with Parker Black for a 26-yard touchdown. \nAlmost on cue the offense came back and scored, off yet another Mason to Michael connection, this time from nine yards out. \n\"The offensive line has a motor that don't stop and when you have backs like we do (Meadowbrook) started getting tired up front,\" coach jim Woodrum said. \"Between the offensive line and backfield, they were clicking and we had a good night.\" \nThings took a turn for the worse for the Redskins in the fourth quarter though, the offense couldn't move the ball, the secondary struggled to stop the pass and the special teams gave up an onside kick. \nIn less than two minutes the Colts blew up the Coshocton lead, cutting it from 39-21 to 39-34. The offense stalled on its next two drives, but the defense came up big when they needed to most. \nCoshocton forced the Colts to go three-and-out on one drive and forced them to turn the ball over on downs the next drive. \n\"When the defense had to get a stop they got it,\" Woodrum said. \"We kind of had that bend don't break mentality all year and they put up a few more points than we wanted them too, but they are pretty good, especially offensively.\" \nThe Redskins got the ball back with 2:47 to play in the game and despite stalling out the previous two drive the offensive line went right back to work. Fortney ran three straight times for 32 yards sealing the win. \n\"We had to outscore our opponent tonight and we were able to do it,\" Woodrum said. \n\"Coming into the season we thought we were going to be really good offensively and we are just now starting to see it. The last couple games, we've been clicking pretty well,\" Mason said. \"I think we are hitting our peak.\" \ncteaguerob@gannett.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T06:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T07:24:14.371+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
