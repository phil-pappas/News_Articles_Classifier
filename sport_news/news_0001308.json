And there’s John Z. DeLorean hawking Cutty Sark scotch, with nary a kilo of coke in sight. With apologies to Mr. Dickens, it was the worst of times, it was the worster of times.\nA few bright spots managed to punch holes through the darkness. Turbocharged engines began to appear under the hoods of a number of cars, including the Datsun Turbo ZX, the Mazda 323 GTX, the Porsche 944 Turbo, the Volvo Turbo, and even the Subaru XT Turbo.\nNascent technologies also made some of their earliest appearances in these pages, with ads for Apple’s Macintosh desktop computer, Panasonic’s TV with a 1.5-inch screen, and the Maxwell Portable Cellular Phone with one hour of talk time for $695. And if the Maxwell was too pricey, you could order a fake “Cellular Fun Phone” and “enjoy the status of owning a car phone for just a fraction of the regular cost.” Cost: $49.95.\nThe decade couldn’t end soon enough.\nPontiac Grand Prix – April 1980\n© Provided by Car and Driver 198004-001 The Sharper Image Xernus – June 1980\n© Provided by Car and Driver 198006-001 International Harvester Scout – June 1980\n© Provided by Car and Driver 198006-002 Mercedes-Benz – July 1980\n© Provided by Car and Driver 198007-001 Energy Efficiencies Inc.
