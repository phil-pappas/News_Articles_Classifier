The conference didn't place a team in last season's playoff and is trying to avoid the fate this year.\nBut before we forget, here's a quick look at what we learned from the first half of the Big 12 season:\nTop Heisman contender: TCU's Trevone Boykin began the season as the Big 12's top contender. Despite a rare off game in the opener against Minnesota, he still is. He has since responded with late-game Heisman moment performances against Texas Tech and Kansas State. Boykin has followed his breakout 2014 season with a better completion percentage, a higher passer rating and 411.5 yards per game of total offense this season.\nMost candid acknowledgement: After his team struggled in the first half of games against SMU and Lamar, Baylor's Art Briles took the blame. \"I think I lost my edge a little, quite honestly,\" Briles said. \"I'm standing here because I had an edge about me for a long time as a person and as a coach. I don't want to lose that or let somebody take it away from me.\" Since Briles' soul searching, Baylor has outscored three opponents 199-59.\nMost timely victory: Despite national speculation otherwise, Texas coach Charlie Strong wasn't about to be fired even if he had lost to Oklahoma. The 24-17 Texas win and the image of Strong being tossed in the air by his players just reaffirmed that Strong was staying. Even though plenty of work remains to bring Texas back, the narrative has changed.\nBest defensive coaching job: Even Gary Patterson would freely admit that he's not coaching a great TCU defense. It's still been good enough to keep the Horned Frogs undefeated. At one point, TCU was minus seven anticipated starters. How many other contenders would have avoided a loss? \"You have to get our kids credit,\" Patterson said. \"They've made stops when they needed to.\"\nBest Adam Sandler movie reference: Patterson claims this category as well with his description of dealing with his team's inexperience in practice. \"Every day is 50 First Dates sometimes,\" he said.\nTop under-the-radar monster talent: Who says they don't play defense in the Big 12? To paraphrase Donald Trump, Oklahoma State's Emmanuel Ogbah is enjoying a yuuuuge season. The junior defensive end leads the Big 12 in sacks (71/2) and tackles for loss (11) while also notching nine quarterback hurries.\nBest under-the-radar team: Texas Tech. The Red Raiders' early win at Arkansas should have been a tip-off. So should the near-upset of TCU in the Game of the First Half. This is a different Tech team from the one that finished 4-8. How much better with quarterback Patrick Mahomes and a standout offensive line? The Red Raiders could easily turn around last season's record.\nStrangest stat: Kansas State won 49 consecutive games when leading at halftime -- no surprise for a Bill Snyder-coached team. Then the Wildcats lost two in a row, first to Oklahoma State and then to TCU after blowing an 18-point lead.\nScariest stats: In each of its first five games, Baylor has rushed for at least 280 yards while also throwing for four touchdowns. While conventional wisdom says the numbers may dip in Big 12 play, remember that Baylor starters have barely played in the fourth quarter.\nTwitter: @ChuckCarltonDMN\nOn Twitter:\n @ChuckCarltonDMN", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/ChuckCarltonDMN"], "published": "2015-10-17T04:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T07:33:31.718+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
