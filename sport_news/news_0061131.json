It certainly was late. That concerns me, the lateness of the slide. I’m looking at it just to see if there's anything we feel should be done.''\nDusty Baker, the former veteran manager, said that Utley should be suspended immediately.\nAll we know is that the last time we saw Kang on the field during the Pirates’ wild-card loss to the Cubs, he was in a wheelchair, being pushed to the baseline for the preagme lineup announcements.\nIf we see Tejada again in this series, he may be in a wheelchair too.\nThere were 10 teams that made this year’s postseason tournament, and two of the teams’ shortstops are out with broken legs.\nThat’s an epidemic, folks.\nIt must be stopped.\nSure, you can argue that aggressively breaking up double plays is simply part of baseball, and has been around since the game has been invented.\nYet, Abner Doubleday never imagined when he drew up the rules that it would be more dangerous to be a middle infielder these days than an NFL quarterback.\nMajor League Baseball executives were alarmed when Kang’s injury happened, particularly when Coghlan went straight for his legs, but the controversy dissipated almost immediately when the Pirates never complained, calling it an aggressive play.\n“”It’s unfortunate that what would be considered heads-up baseball would cause such a serious injury,’’ Kang said in a release from the hospital. “That said, Coghlan was playing the game the way it should be played. I’m confident he meant me no harm. I appreciate everyone’s support.’’\nKang and the Pirates helped douse a potential nasty retaliation, and all that happened to Coghlan was being vociferously booed when his name was announced during the introductions.\nThis time, it’s completely different.\nThe Mets are outraged, calling the slide dirty.\nThe Dodgers awkwardly support Utley, but certainly understand the Mets’ anger.\n\"Well, I don't know if I need to get into whether it's clean or anything else,\" Dodgers manager Don Mattingly said. “The one thing I probably know 100%. ... I know Chase is not trying to hurt anybody.’’\nSaid Mets manager Terry Collins: “It broke my shortstop’s leg. That’s all I know.”\nMets infielder Kelly Johnson, who has played 842 career games at second base, was the most vocal of his disgust with Utley, and had no filter discussing his view of the play.\n“It was dirty,” Johnson said. “There are so many things wrong with that play. Our starting shortstop is out of the playoffs with a broken leg. …I want a rule about a guy going into Ruben like that. We don’t have a rule about that slide, or whatever that was, that tackle. ..Obviously he went in and got our player before he even touched dirt.\n“It’s sad. I don’t get it, I really don’t.’’\nNo matter your viewpoint, Utley has now become the most hated baseball player in New York since John Rocker.\nYou can be assured that MLB will have extra police protection at Citi Field for Utley’s safety, just as they did Rocker, when he littered New York with racist comments.\nBut there’s no cop on the planet who can stop the Mets from their own vigilante plan, and drill Utley when he’s at the plate, or sliding as hard as they can into second base, deliberately trying to break a bone or two.\nIt’s going to get nasty, and baseball better change the rules this winter, making sure we never see anything like this again.\nMLB must rewrite the rules and require that baserunners slide directly at the base, not at the baserunner. Torre acknowledged Saturday night they are testing just such a plan in the Arizona Fall League, a setting for prior experiments such as instant replay and between-innings clocks.\nWe all love aggressive plays, but when you’re talking about players' livelihoods, and potentially ruining careers, permitting beanball wars makes more sense than what’s happening now.\nAt least in the batter’s box, you’re wearing helmets.\nAnd you can be assured that changing the rule will be the hot topic of conversation in November at the general manager’s meetings in Boca Raton, Fla., and by the winter meetings a month later, the rule will be adopted, signed off by the owners.\nSimply, this can no longer go on.\n“I just want to know why there’s not something in place that’s going to protect us,’’ Johnson said. “I just don’t get that. He’s [Utley] in the vicinity of the bag, yes, [Utley] probably could have touched the bag had he put his hand out on it. But there’s got to be something in there that says we’ve got to hit dirt.\n“We’ve got to slide, not jump into, break fibulas, and knock players out of games.’’\nYou’re’ talking about plenty of money lost, too, with these injuries. You aren’t on the disabled list for two weeks. You’re done for the season.\nCan you imagine if anyone ever took out Derek Jeter, and prematurely ended his career?\nHow about being the guy who wiped out Cal Ripken Jr., ending his consecutive games streak?\nFor everyone’s sake, and even the guys who love to play good ol' fashioned hardball like Utley, it must stop.\nIt’s a shame that Utley, whose career is coming to an end, will now be remembered for the slide more than anything he ever accomplished as a player.\n© Jayne Kamin-Oncea, USA TODAY Sports Jayne Kamin-Oncea, USA TODAY Sports “I did not intend to hurt him whatsoever,’’ Utley said. “I was just trying to break up the double play. I was trying to put a body on him to break up the double play. That’s winning baseball.\n“I feel terrible that he was injured.’’\nIt doesn't matter. The damage is done. Tempers are flaring.\nUtley will never again be looked upon the same.\nAnd should the Dodgers go on to win the World Series, everyone will remember the key rally that turned around their Division Series was aided significantly by a dirty play.\nThat's still a ways off, though. Both clubs are tasked with handling the emotional fallout as Game 3 looms Monday night.\n“You got to take the emotion and keep your focus,’’ Mets manager Terry Collins told reporters. “You can’t lose control. …We’ll control it, but yeah, [the Mets players] are angry. You lose in a playoff series to that serious of an injury, yeah, they’re not very happy about it.\n“I think our guys will be certainly very, very anxious to get back on the field on Monday.:\nAnd perhaps just as eager to see Utley being taken off the field himself.\nYes, we’re talking vengeance, and that’s the scariest part of all about this mess.\nIt’s not over, and will never be over, until baseball steps in and stops it with a rule change.\nEnough is enough.\nFollow Nightengale on Twitter: @Bnightengale\nGALLERY: Dodgers, Mets clash in Division Series\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.usatoday.com/sports/", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "https://twitter.com/BNightengale"], "published": "2015-10-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T19:22:50.237+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
