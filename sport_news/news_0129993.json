I managed to stay out there quite long, so that's good,\" Konta said.\nWilliams -- who first stepped out onto the pro circuit when Konta was just three-years-old -- was also full of praise for her young opponent.\n\"I think she had a lot of self-belief out there and she had a lot of focus. I thought that was really impressive, especially playing against opponents that have more experience than her, who have been in these situations before,\" said Williams.\nKonta looked like she might take the third set off Williams -- breaking her serve to bring the score to 3-1 -- and she kept the pressure on the American veteran right into the final game.\n\"That last game, I thought I played a great game. Mostly first serves in. Still (I) found myself down 15-40 due to her play. So clearly things are working for her,\" Williams said.\nUntil recently Konta had struggled with nerves, but since Wimbledon she has won 21 of 23 matches beating the likes of Halep, Victoria Azarenka, Andrea Petkovic and Garbine Muguruza.\nKonta's Lawn Tennis Association funding was dramatically slashed at the beginning of the year, as part of an overhaul of support for up-and-coming players.\nThe cut forced her to move her training to northern Spain where coaches Esteban Carril and Jose-Manuel Garcia have mentored her through a rapid rise up the rankings.\nShe has decided to sit out next week's China Open in Beijing, withdrawing from the qualifiers, and will head back to the UK.\nBut first, the young player was planning a good night's sleep.\n\"I'm going to go to bed sleeping all right tonight,\" she said.\n ", "external_links": ["https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.toi.reader.activities"], "published": "2015-10-02T18:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T21:32:01.257+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
