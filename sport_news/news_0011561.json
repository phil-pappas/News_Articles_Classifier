A key to that success has been a relentless, play-making defense, and at the center of that is Akinboboye, a senior leader and the defensive signal-caller. \nHe also is an excellent student, proving he can hit the books as well as he does opponents. He tackled various subjects in a Q&A session with the Journal. \nHow often do people mispronounce your name? \nA lot! Most people who’ve known me for a while get it right, but for people just meeting me, it’s a struggle. They’ll add all kinds of extra letters and syllables trying to say it. Whenever we have a substitute teacher, before they take attendance I just tell them, \"It’s the first name on the list. I’m present.\" \nFavorite food? \nI love the chicken, bacon and ranch pizza from Tosi's in Marlboro. \nYour parents are from Nigeria. What’s it like growing up in that culture? \nFood-wise, we eat a lot of rice. And my parents are very strict. Education is always the priority and I can’t play sports unless my grades are good. \nHow are the grades? \nMy overall average is a 95, and I take a lot of advanced placement courses. \nToughest person you've had to tackle? \nProbably Nick Gallo from Schalmont. We played them in my sophomore year and I didn't tackle him once. I hadn't seen that kind of speed before. \nEver been run over? \nYeah. Again, sophomore year against Pleasantville in the regional game. I was blitzing on a fourth down and a lineman blindsided me and I went airborne; feet up in the air and everything. I got up and still got the sack. After the game, we watched that play on tape like 20 times and everyone was laughing at it. But it was the hardest hit I’ve ever taken. \nPopular song you find annoying? \nAnything from Iggy Azalea. \nBest day of your life? \nProbably last week when coach (Rich) Ward gave me a compliment after an interception in practice. I get criticized a lot in practice because I'm the person who's responsible for setting up the defense. When anything goes wrong, I'm held accountable. So to get a compliment meant a lot. He said, \"Great job. I knew you could do it.\" I said, \"Finally!\" \nWhat TV shows do you watch? \n“Power” is the best show out right now, and I like “The Walking Dead.” \nFavorite subject? \nPhysics. It’s also my toughest class. A lot of classes, you wonder, \"Why are we doing this?\" But physics makes sense to me. And, Mr. (Scott) Hisel is one of the best teachers I’ve ever had. \nDo you speak any Yoruba (a native language of Nigeria)? \nI don’t, but I can tell when my parents are mad at me. I’ll hear my name and know from the context that I’m about to get yelled at. \nWhat do you usually get yelled at about? \nI'm tired when I get home, but I’ve got chores. If I have to mow the lawn or wash the dishes and I'm late on it, they’ll yell. \nWhat do you want to be when you grow up? \nPhysical therapist. I want to help people and still be around sports somewhat. I’ve been volunteering at Peak Physical Therapy in Newburgh since January and I like doing it. \nIf you interviewed yourself, what's a question you would ask? \nWhat does your name mean? \nAnswer?", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T21:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T02:44:35.802+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
