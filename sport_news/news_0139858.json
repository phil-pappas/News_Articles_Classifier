A University of Chicago grad, Ng has spent the last five seasons working in the commissioner's office.\nShe previously worked as the vice president and assistant GM with the Los Angeles Dodgers. Ng arrived in LA from New York, where, at age 29, she was hired as an assistant GM for the New York Yankees.\nNg was first mentioned as a potential candidate by the Daily News last month.\nMore coverage Final season stats for Phillies Download FREE Philly Sports Now app for iPhone! Buy Phillies jerseys and other gear WATCH: Daily fantasy baseball updates According to the CBSsports.com report, former Marlins GM Larry Beinfest has already interviewed with incoming Phillies president Andy MacPhail, and Indians vice president of player personnel Ross Atkins is scheduled to interview this week. Atkins interviewed for the Angels' GM job last month.\nWhen he dismissed Ruben Amaro Jr. last month, MacPhail said he planned to run a thorough search to fill the GM position and thought it would be \"ambitious\" to have a hire in place before the Phillies' organizational meetings at the end of the month. So this is likely just the beginning of that process.\nOther potential candidates include Matt Klentak, who worked as an assistant GM with the Angels in 2015, J.J. Picollo, as assistant GM with Kansas City, and Thad Levine, an assistant GM with the Texas Rangers.\n- Ryan Lawrence", "external_links": ["http://philly.stats.com/mlb/teamstats.asp?team=22&type=stats", "http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&mi=11081&pw=159355&ctc=article&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.fanatics.com%2FMLB_Philadelphia_Phillies"], "published": "2015-10-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T03:06:52.897+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
