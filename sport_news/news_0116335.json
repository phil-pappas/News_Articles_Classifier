He will make his debut Thursday when Columbus visits Minnesota. \nThe Blue Jackets were expected to contend for a playoff spot this season. They are just the sixth team to open with seven straight losses. They were shut out by the New York Islanders on Tuesday night, and Columbus has been outscored 18-7 in the third period this season. \nTortorella most recently coached Vancouver in 2013-14. He led Tampa Bay to a Stanley Cup title in 2004. \n___ \nThis story has been corrected that Blue Jackets have made playoffs twice.
