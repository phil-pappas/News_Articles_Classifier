Birney Crum Stadium Saturday afternoon made for either football heaven or football hell, depending on what colors you were wearing. \nThe green and gold of Central Catholic heard angels singing. \nThe blue and white of Nazareth wondered what the devil was wrong. \nThe Vikings scored four touchdowns in the first 9:58 of the Eastern Pennsylvania Conference South Division game and rolled to a 48-27 defeat of the Blue Eagles that wasn’t really even that close. \nIt made for a most unwelcome sight for Nazareth coach Tom Falzone, who should be credited with keeping his sense of humor afterwards. \n“I don’t want to see you at any more of our games,” he said to a reporter covering his first Blue Eagle football tilt in 17 years. \nAsked if he’d seen such a first 10 minutes before, Falzone said, “Sure. Last year. We saw a lot of this last season (when Nazareth went 2-8). I hadn’t seen anything like this this season. We played as badly as we could possibly play.” \nAnd Central Catholic (4-2 overall, 3-2 EPC South) could hardly have been better. \n“It all started with practice this week, where we had to keep our focus all week,” said Viking senior running back Alvin Pacheco , who ran for 234 yards and four touchdowns Saturday. “We can definitely tell when practice is making us better. We got some great looks from our scout team all week that really prepared us for today.” \nCentral Catholic’s scout team might have done better stopping the Vikings than the Blue Eagles did. \nNazareth’s nightmare started on the opening kickoff. \n“We wanted to play keep-away on the kickoffs,” Viking coach John Cupples said. \nThe Vikings did that as well as possible when a pooch-kick was muffed by Nazareth and Edward Manzella recovered for Central at the Blue Eagle 23. \n“We didn’t want to kick to their athletes,” Cupples said. “We had some directional kicks in. Any time you get a turnover on special teams, that is huge.” \nThe Vikings had the ball in the end zone on the next play but a penalty negated the score. Nazareth’s reprieve was brief, as three plays later Viking junior quarterback Ethan Persa (7-for-14 passing, 141 yards, 1 TD, 2 interceptions) found Dallas Kassis for a 22-yard scoring pass and it was 7-0 Central 74 seconds into the game. \nAfter a 3-and-out for Nazareth the Vikings found themselves facing 3rd-and-15 at their own 15. Persa hit Pacheco for a 73-yard gain on a fly route down the right sideline, and two plays later senior fullback Joe Milano , who played exceedingly well all afternoon, pulled into the end zone from 11 yards out. 14-0, 4:38 in. \nNazareth responded with a an impressive drive from its 19 to the Central 17, but Viking junior defensive back Tom Murphy sliced in front of a Travis Stefanik slant pass, intercepted it, and ran it back to the Central Catholic 31. \nOn the next play, Viking junior running back Darnell Ferrell took a speed sweep 69 yards to the house. 21-0, 7:55 in. \nThat sequence was probably the turning point of the game, though, as Falzone said. “I am not sure there was a turning point.” \nA Blue Eagle 3-and-out followed. One play after the punt, Pacheco dashed, absolutely untouched, right through the middle of the Nazareth defense for a 60-yard score. \n28-0, 9:58 elapsed. \nHeaven for Central Catholic. The opposite for Nazareth.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T04:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T02:25:46.032+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
