He was added as insurance because Brandon Jennings is rehabbing a ruptured Achilles and likely won't be available until December.\nDETROIT FREE PRESS\nPistons exercise Bullock's $2.3M option for 2016-17\nBut he suffered a nasty spill on the second day of training camp and it took nearly three weeks for Blake to pass the league's mandated concussion protocols.\nHe recovered in time for Friday's game and he excelled — dishing out a game-high 12 assists in 24 minutes in the Pistons' 115-87 victory over the Hawks.\n■ Granger update: The deadline to set rosters is this afternoon, and that's when the Pistons will likely part ways with small forward Danny Granger, who was part of the deal that also brought Marcus Morris and Reggie Bullock from Phoenix this summer.\nHe is still in Arizona rehabbing a bum knee, but Van Gundy expects him to surface later this year with another team.\nWhen the Pistons waive Granger, they will eat the $2.2 million he is owed this season. The only other outcome is a late-developing trade, but that seems doubtful.\nContact Vince Ellis at vellis@freepress.com .
