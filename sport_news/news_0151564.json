Abington Heights won, 10-7. \nThe high school football landscape in Pennsylvania has changed. \nThe PIAA Board of Directors approved an expansion from four to six classifications this afternoon beginning with the 2016 season. It’s the biggest change the sport has seen since the state playoffs were adopted for the 1988 season. \nThe new system takes effect starting with the 2016 season and divides schools into classes of roughly equal size. \nIn addition, the PIAA also approved to expand from four to six classes in boys and girls basketball, softball and baseball. Boys and girls soccer and girls volleyball will expand to four classes, while field hockey is expanding to three classes. Lacrosse is expanding to two classes. \nThe football expansion was approved by a 26-4 vote. The other sports were approved, 23-7. \nToday’s vote is the culmination of a long process that began with three proposals. Other options included six classifications with a Super Class for schools with an enrollment of 700 or more, and a Super Class with schools with enrollment of 800 or more. \nAs the months passed, options were eliminated through the review process that included meetings of the Strategic Planning and Football Steering committees and the Pennsylvania Scholastic Football Coaches Association, which had strong support for change. \nLast month, the Strategic Planning and Football Steering Committee recommended a to move to six classifications with an even break of roughly 96 football teams per classification. \nCheck back for updates, or read more in The Times-Tribune on Thursday.
