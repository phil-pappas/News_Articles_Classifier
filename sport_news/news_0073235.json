The scheme named “Dr APJ Abdul Kalam e-map Centre” will be launched on a pilot basis at Shimla, Baddi- Barotiwala-Nalagarh Development Authority (BBNDA), Dharamsala, Ghumarwin and Nadaun. Later, depending upon the response of the scheme it could be replicated in the entire state. The TCP Department has fixed rates for services like sub-division of land, preparation of building map, structural design and spot visit so that the architects and engineers do not overcharge. “Our main objective is to guide and educate those undertaking construction so that the building raised by them is in conformity with the TCP rule and building norms and later on no problems are faced,” said Sudhir Sharma, Urban Development and TCP Minister. He added that the facility of preparation of building maps will be provided free of cost to the below poverty line (BPL) category. The TCP Department has already come out with six retention policies to regularise the unauthorised construction made by house owners in the past. The department is now in a dilemma as to how to provide relief to over 25,000 house owners who have built unauthorised structures in violation of norms. As such the step of setting up e-map centres could go a long way in solving the problem of unauthorized constructions. Moreover, with the department filing an affidavit before the High Court that it will not come up with another new retention policy, possibility is being explored to bring about an amendment in the TCP Act to give relief to the violators. The TCP while notifying the e-map centre scheme has invited applications from registered architects or organizations, preferably those registered with the Town and Country Planning Department or Council of Architecture for being empanelled. The scheme will enable digital maps and online grant of permission. As per the norms for the scheme, 25 per cent of the consultancy fee on account of preparation of maps, site visits and structural designs will be retained by the TCP Department or by the Special Area Development Authority. This amount will be deposited in the Convenience Fund which will be utilized to pay honorarium to the In-charge of the e-map centre. This money will also be used for organizing public awareness workshops, for maintenance of e-map Centre and meeting other office expenses of e-map Centre.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T04:17:33.018+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
