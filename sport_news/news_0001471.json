He completed 11 of 20 passes with touchdowns of 55, 61 and 17 yards, tying his career high for touchdown passes with three. \n“They had some big plays that hurt us,” said Western Kentucky coach Jeff Brohm, who sounded taken aback by Harris’ performance as his defense sold out to stop the run. “Because they run the ball so well, they can get some play action off of it, and they did. It hurt us, but their quarterback has improved. He did a good job throwing the ball up the field, seeing things, running the offense.” \nHarris threw touchdowns to three wide receivers. Sophomore Malachi Dupre caught the 55 yarder for a 7-0 lead in the first quarter. True freshman Tyron Johnson caught the 61-yard score for a 34-13 lead in the third quarter, and Travin Dural caught a laser over the middle for the 17-yard touchdown for a 41-20 lead in the fourth quarter. \n“He’s playing great,” said Dupre, who caught three of Harris’ passes for 86 yards. “The weather wasn’t what we wanted it to be, but we still made plays through the air when we had to. The weather wasn’t optimal, but we still performed with the situation we had. We’re just going to continue to get better. Brandon is getting more and more confidence. The coaches are getting more confident in his ability.” \nHarris was not available for interviews after the game and is not expected to be anymore this season, according to Coach Les Miles, because of comments Harris made last week after the 35-28 win over Florida in which he hit 13 of 19 passes for 202 yards and two touchdowns. \n“If they want to play us with nine in the box, so be it,” Harris said after that game, referencing Florida and other opponents who pile up defenders to stop tailback Leonard Fournette and dare Harris to pass. “People have been doubting us. We say, ‘Keep doubting us.’” \nAnd Western Kentucky did exactly that, too, as it often put eight or nine close to the line to stop Fournette and left just two or three for pass coverage. \n“This team lives in the box,” Miles said of Western Kentucky, which allowed six completions of 17 yards or more to Harris. He completed a 67-yard pass to Dural that set up LSU’s second touchdown for a 14-7 lead in the second quarter. There were also completions of 28 and 25 yards by Harris to Dural and to Dupre. \nAs has been the case in recent weeks, Harris threw from the pocket and on the run. \n“He is more dangerous because he is still a great passer while running,” said Dural, who caught five passes for 132 yards. \n“We’re throwing the ball better,” Miles said. “One thing about him is if he goes to scrambling, you better cover your guy.” \nFournette, meanwhile, still got 150 yards on 26 carries, though his longest run was just 18 yards. The Tigers totaled 497 yards. True freshman tailback Derrius Guice added 48 yards on three carries as he had a 47-yard touchdown in the fourth quarter for the 48-20 final. \n“We had to really emphasize technique and pad level. We had to keep our knees bent because you want to avoid slipping,” right tackle Vadal Alexander said. \n“Early on, the weather conditions were terrible,” Miles said. “If it had stayed that way, no one would have had any success in the air. It turned out to be a pretty nice night to me. I kind of enjoyed it myself. I don’t think the weather affected our throwing at all late in the game.” \nPOLL WATCH, BAMA GAME: The Tigers (7-0, 4-0 Southeastern Conference) moved up one spot to No. 4 in the Associated Press and USA Today polls on Sunday. Alabama (7-1, 4-1 SEC) moved up one spot to No. 7 in each poll. LSU and Alabama each have an open date Saturday before their Nov. 7 clash at Bryant-Denny Stadium in Tuscaloosa, Alabama. Television and kickoff information for that game will be announced on Monday. \nMISSING TRE’DAVIOUS WHITE: LSU starting cornerback Tre’Davious White was held out of the game Saturday with a minor injury as a precaution. \n“He got nicked in a freak accident that involved our players,” Miles said, but did not get any more specific. “We expect him to be back. He probably could have played. We could have pushed him, but we didn’t really need to. Now, we have two weeks before we play. It will work out well.I do think we missed him.” \nJunior Dwayne Thomas started in White’s place, but LSU played a variety of defensive backs throughout the night as Western Kentucky quarterback Brandon Doughty riddled the secondary with 37 completions in 61 attempts for 325 yards and three touchdowns. True freshman Kevin Toliver started at the other cornerback slot and was inconsistent as was reserve cornerback Ed Paris. \n“So, we built some depth,” Miles said. \nStarting defensive tackle Ethan Pocic also was held out with a minor injury, but he is also expected back for the Alabama game.
