I wear this uniform, we all wear this uniform, got to be proud of it.” \nThe Fighting Clan responded, topping the Braves 2-1 in overtime for their first win of the season. \nAtkinson made two huge plays in the victory — a diving save in the first half and a leaping punch on a corner kick in the second, which also prevented a goal. That effort instilled confidence in the team, which was moving on from former standout keeper Shelby Money, who entered Wednesday 3-0 with a shutout in her freshman season at Rowan University. \n“It’s definitely tough to fill those shoes,” junior defender Alyssa Nanni said. “Shelby is an incredible player, but Molly is doing well. She’s loud. She’s aggressive. She’s willing to go and get the ball from a girl on the breakaway, so I know she has my back if I happen to break down.” Buy Photo \nVineland Goalie Molly Atkinson. Sept. 24, 2015 (Photo: Craig Matthews/Staff Photographe) \nAtkinson didn’t know much about Money before she got to Vineland. In fact, she knew very little about the team as a whole. \nHer only familiarity with the Fighting Clan stemmed from what Melanie Milam, Emily Caignon and Devin Fisher told her. The Vineland trio played with Atkinson on the Pittsgrove Stuffed Animals in the spring. \nWhen Atkinson finally transferred, the girls pushed her to join the team. \n“Every day at practice, ‘Since you are coming to Vineland, you have to play. We’re going to force you. We’ll hunt you down. We’ll find you,’” said Fisher, describing the conversations they had with Atkinson. \nTheir persistence proved to Atkinson she was wanted. Atkinson had never played a varsity game before — she started on both the freshman and JV teams her first two seasons before riding the bench as a junior. \nBut when offseason training started, Atkinson realized her first varsity action would carry added weight because of who she was replacing Vineland. \n“I was kind of nervous, I’m not going to lie,” Atkinson said. “I heard the girls always talking about how good Shelby Money was, so that made me nervous, because it was a new team and they talked about Shelby Money like she was a god.” \nThose nerves didn’t deflate Atkinson. Instead, the 5-foot-1, 115-pound goalie rose above those concerns. \n“She has adapted very well,” junior Sarah Patrignani said. “She came in the first day and within a week she’s friends with everyone. She is definitely a Type-A personality. Very outgoing, very loud on the field, not afraid to get out there and take someone out and get that ball and you know she’s never going to back down.” \nAtkinson’s attitude has inspired her teammates. \nDuring the squad’s 2-1 overtime loss to still-undefeated Millville, Atkinson made a leaping save on a ball heading just under the crossbar. \nThat stop garnered her a new nickname with Caignon — Ninja Goalie — which was originally coined in the movie “She’s the Man.” \n“I thought that was amazing,” Atkinson said. “That made me feel a lot more accepted, being seen as ninja goalie.” \nHer teammates and coaches feel it’s well deserved and they couldn’t be happier having Atkinson defending their net. \n“I always say she’s so unassuming,” coach Amy Ardito said. “She’s this little kid and she just like looks like she’s this young little girl and she comes out there and she’s the complete opposite. … They feel comfortable with her back there.” \nJosh Friedman; (856) 563-5257; jfriedman2@gannettnj.com 50 CONNECT 11 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://vineland.dj/1KPzsbG TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T18:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T02:20:55.517+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
