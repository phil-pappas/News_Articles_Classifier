So far, the police had been claiming that they had opened fire in self defence when members of various Sikh organisations, protesting in the village against the alleged desecration of their holy book, clashed with them. Thereafter, the police had registered against the protesters a case of attempt to murder and disrupting police officials in discharging duty. No police official has been named in the fresh FIR as a probe by a Special Investigation Team (SIT) headed by Additional Director General of Police IPS Sahota is still on. However, Sahota said the police team that opened fire on the protesters was headed by the then Moga SSP Charanjit Sharma. On Sahotaâ€™s directions, an FIR under relevant sections of the IPC and the Arms Act was lodged at the Baza Khana police station today evening. Gurjeet Singh (27) and Bhagwan Krishan Singh (54) were killed and 50 persons were injured in the police firing on October 14 and since then protesters have been demanding a murder case against officials who ordered the firing. Sources said the SIT would fix the responsibility as to who ordered the firing and under what circumstances. It is yet to be ascertained if the local executive magistrate declared the protest as an unlawful assembly and ordered police firing.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T04:05:54.250+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
