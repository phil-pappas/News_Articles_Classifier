The Buckeyes’ surge really began in week five, when they destroyed Maryland on the road 52-24 and not nearly that close. That was the second of four games in a five-week stretch in which they averaged 53 points and 520 offensive yards. In the fifth game in that stretch, they managed 293 total yards, 17 points in regulation and zero in the second half and barely survived, in double OT, at Penn State. \nLast week: Ohio State beat Maryland in Columbus, 49-28. \nAll-time series: Ohio State leads, 17-13. \nLast meeting: Ohio State beat Penn State, 31-24 at Beaver Stadium Oct. 25, 2014. \nCoach: Urban Meyer (fourth year at OSU, 44-3 at OSU, 148-26 overall). \nBest player: Junior DE Joey Bosa is considered the best player, regardless of position, in the 2016 NFL draft class. \nLas Vegas says: The line opened at Ohio State -21 The Buckeyes are now 18.5-point favorites. \nOutlook: With some of the best skill-position talent in CFB history, the Buckeyes rank only 26th in total offense, even after lighting it up a bit against Maryland last week. This against the nation’s 73rd-ranked schedule, according to Football Outsiders’ rankings (Penn State’s sked, no murderer’s row, ranks 32nd). \nOne wonders how much Meyer misses Tom Herman, last year’s offensive coordinator/QB coach, now the head man at Houston. One wonders, in fact, why this hasn’t been talked about more. Houston, for what it’s worth, is 5-0. \n(This isn’t a criticism of Meyer. If it was, 44-3 at OSU, 148-26 overall would be an effective counter.) \nMeyer has begun mitigating his choice of Cardale Jones as starting QB over J.D. Barrett lately by using Barrett in red-zone situations, in which the Buckeyes were 6-for-6, all touchdowns, last week. \nPrediction: Ohio State is potentially an historically great team, if it finds itself. If this is the week that happens, we could be looking at an Ohio State romp by five or six touchdowns. \nAgain, though, at this point a year ago, the Buckeyes’ self-discovery was already well underway. They still barely, and some would say luckily, survived at Beaver Stadium. \nA win for Penn State would tangibly ratify the end of a transitional period in the program’s history, and it is possible. Penn State’s defense should (not can, should) keep it in the game. If the unknowables - turnovers, penalties, officiating, freak plays, etc. - go in the Lions’ net favor, something crazy could happen. \nIf not, there’s a mismatch at the center of the game, the Lions’ O-line against the Buckeyes’ D-line, that is so huge it’s hard to overstate, and harder to overcome. \nOhio State 30, Penn State 17.
