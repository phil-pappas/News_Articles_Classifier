Ad Feedback \nDespite that experience he describes offshore sailing as \"pretty infectious\". \nBeing the youngest to cross the Tasman was not without trouble. His autopilot, an essential aspect of solo sailing, failed 200 miles off the coast of New Zealand. \nYet he still made it to Mooloolaba on the Sunshine Coast 10 days later. \n\"Solo sailing, everyone thinks is quite lonely. Realistically you don't have time to worry about being alone. You just get into a routine.\" \nMcLennan has purchased a new yacht from France which he'll use to achieve his next dream - to race solo across the Atlantic in the Mini Transat 6.50. \nDespite people telling him it's mad to cross it alone, McLennan will dedicate the next four years to achieving this goal. \n\"I've got one shot at life and if you\"ve got a dream you've got to try and make it happen. No one's going to give you a handout and say 'here you go, make your dream happen'.\" \nSearch for Cory McLennan Racing on Facebook to follow his progress and vote for him to win an AMP scholarship. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T23:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T16:05:00.847+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
