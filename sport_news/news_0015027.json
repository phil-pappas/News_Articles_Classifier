Fire Mattingly. #Dodgers #MLBPlayoffs\n— Rob Lowe (@RobLowe) October 16, 2015 I guess you could say Lowe has St. Elmo's Fire burning inside him right now.\nTaking a stand like this? I guess you could say this is The Finest Hour of Rob Lowe's career.\nIf Mattingly does get fired, I bet Rob Lowe will do a Square Dance to celebrate.\nGoing up to bat for beleaguered Dodgers fans who want change? I guess you can call him The Grinder .\nAfter a tough loss like this, Lowe will probably want to go to enjoy some Parks & Recreation .\nAdChoices Go to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.sbnation.com/mlb/teams/los-angeles-dodgers", "http://www.sbnation.com/mlb/teams/new-york-mets", "https://twitter.com/RobLowe/status/654860159940870144", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/Dodgers?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/MLBPlayoffs?src=hash", "http://sbnation.com?utm_source=MSNbanner/", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T11:57:56.696+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
