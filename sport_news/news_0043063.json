(AP) — The Washington Redskins will be missing both starting cornerbacks against the Atlanta Falcons on Sunday, with Chris Culliver joining DeAngelo Hall on the sideline. \nRedskins coach Jay Gruden says Friday that Culliver, who missed practice all week, has “some cartilage issues” in his left knee, which was operated on in the past. \nHall will be sitting out a second game in a row with an injured right toe. \nWill Blackmon is expected to start alongside Bashaud Breeland at cornerback against Matt Ryan, Julio Jones and Atlanta’s high-powered offense. \nThe Redskins also will be without tight end Jordan Reed, who has a concussion, and receiver DeSean Jackson, out since hurting his left hamstring in Week 1. \nLinebacker Perry Riley Jr. is listed as questionable with a strained left calf. \n___ \nAP NFL website: www.pro32.ap.org and AP NFL Twitter feed: www.twitter.com/AP_NFL Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T22:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T22:34:16.124+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
