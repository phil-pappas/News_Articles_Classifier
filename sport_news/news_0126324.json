Pinckneyville looked ready to claim a win over Nashville for the first time in several years on Tuesday night, but the Hornettes rebounded after losing the first set to dominate the next two on their way to a 19-25, 25-12, 25-11 victory at PCHS. The Lady Panthers trailed 16-9 in the first set before rallying back to trail by just two at 19-17. From there, PCHS rattled off eight points in a row to take a one set lead. Pinckneyville extended their scoring streak to ten straight points with the first two in the second set, but from that point on, Nashville made all the plays and took total control of the match. After taking the second set, the Hornettes jumped out to a 15-3 lead in the third and never looked back. Sophie Keith led Pinckneyville with 6 kills, Emma Banach added 4. Mayci Doerflein's 11 assists and Mady Epplin's 8 digs were also team highs for the Lady Panthers. Pinckneyville will try to close out conference play with a win on Thursday when they travel to Carterville.
