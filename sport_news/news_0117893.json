Xi Jinping has said on several occasions that one of his biggest dreams is for China to someday win the FIFA World Cup, and while the fulfillment of that lofty objective doesn't exactly lie just over the horizon, the Chinese President's journey to the United Kingdom offers a chance to push international football forward back at home, by emphasizing the benefits of bilateral cooperation.Former England captain David Beckham is among those helping in the effort to improve the beautiful game in the PRC, which includes making the sport a compulsory part of the national education curriculum. Close to 20,000 football academies are slated to open by 2017 with the goal of producing more than 100,000 players. \nWork is also underway to attract more foreign stars to the Chinese Super League, in hopes that their presence will help lift the overall level of competition in the professional ranks.\"This is just not a short-term project. It's a long-term project. It's something that we're very passionate about changing the mentality of the league, and changing and bringing a lot of youngsters through the development and into professional,\" said David Beckham, CSL global ambassador.And officials from the UK are putting their money where their mouth is. In addition to setting up more football development forums, a three million pound initiative was announced last month to help Chinese sports administrators teach and promote the game at the grassroots level, as part of the Premier Skills Scheme. \nThis program has also trained over 1,000 coaches in the last seven years, with promises of similar instruction for at least 5,000 more individuals in the near future.\"Chief among our suggestions to make this precious opportunity a success, is to create a platform for exchanging playing and coaching talent, thus furthering our multi-level cooperation,\" said Xu Jiayin, Evergrand Group chairman.So while President Xi meets with leaders like Queen Elizabeth and Prime Minister David Cameron to discuss political issues like bolstering free trade and mediating regional conflicts, mutual efforts to raise the profile of the most popular sport on the planet in the world's most populous nation could very well be the key legacy of the first-ever China-UK Cultural Exchange Year.
