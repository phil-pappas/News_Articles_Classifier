Because it looks like a big one,\" team mate Max Verstappen asked over the team radio as the medical car sped to the scene of the impact and the paddock collectively held its breath. \nTost said the fact the car went under the barriers was worrying and others expressed safety concerns about the installation of the barriers and the way the car had penetrated beneath them. \n\"I think we've definitely dodged a bullet there -- the car shouldn't have gone under the barriers, absolutely not,\" said Williams performance engineering head Rob Smedley. \n\"That isn't what's supposed to happen so that's disconcerting, to say the least, to watch.\" (Editing by Ed Osmond and Ken Ferris ) Trending On Reuters", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T21:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T23:47:32.179+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
