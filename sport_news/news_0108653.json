The El D Way: Miners win 28-14 \nWith that goal-line stand, the Cavaliers held on for a 35-28 triumph on Friday in a crucial Central Sequoia League showdown at CVC. \n\"It's just a credit to our team,\" CVC coach Mason Hughes said. \"We fought a lot of adversity. We were down early, a lot it seemed like, and they fought. I trust these boys. They're gonna fight to the very end, and they did.\" \nThe Cavaliers trailed 28-21 entering the final quarter before they battled back. \nConnor Paden scored what seemed like the game-tying touchdown on an 11-yard sweep with 10 minutes and 21 seconds left in regulation, but the Cavaliers missed the extra point kick and fell behind 28-27. \nAfter forcing Kingsburg to turn the ball over on downs in CVC territory, the Cavaliers marched nine plays and 62 yards down the field to set up a reasonable field goal attempt. \nLuke Greidanus lined up for the 26-yard field goal try, but his kick sailed wide. \nWith 2:18 left to play, the Cavaliers still showed resiliency. \nCVC forced a Kingsburg three-and-out, and the Vikings punted the ball away with under a minute left in the contest. \nPaden, who also scored on a 20-yard touchdown reception in the second quarter, lined up near the Cavaliers' 40 to field the punt, and he dazzled on the return. \nPaden scooped up the kick at his own 46 running in full stride and shifted for a 34-yard gain. \n\"We had the decision to go for the block, or set up the return, but we haven't been getting the blocks this season,\" Hughes said. \"I just said, 'Let's go for the return and hope he kicks it to us' and he did. The punt bounced perfectly into Connor, and he's great at the bounce. The punt team kind of slow downs when it bounces, but he puts it in another gear.\" Harris hurt, Redskins still run strong \nOn the very next play, senior quarterback Aaron Daggs scrambled for a 20-yard touchdown. Kolin Stock converted the two-point try, and CVC grabbed its only lead of the game, 35-28. \n\"I looked downfield, and I didn't see anybody open,\" Daggs said. \"I saw a lane open up, and I decided just to take it. My guys blocked well downfield and I took it in.\" \nDaggs finished with 71 yards passing and three total touchdowns (two passing, one rushing). He also ran for 25 yards. \nStock recorded his seventh game of at least 100 yards or more. The tough 5-foot-10, 185-pound bruiser rushed for a game-high 197 yards on 26 carries. His 58-yard run in the first quarter tied the game at 7. \n\"He played very well,\" Hughes said. \"We call him Beast Mode. He's been unreal all season. He's a tough son of a gun. He doesn't go down easily. He plays his heart out and wears it on his sleeve.\" \nThe CVC secondary intercepted Kingsburg four times. Collin Stockton picked off two passes, and Jacob De jong and Scott Vanderwall each had one. The Cavaliers also recovered a fumble. Prep Football Week 9 \n\"I thought that (the turnovers) obviously gave us good field position at times,\" Hughes said. \"They're very explosive, and they weren't because of that. They still were explosive, but it limited them some. Those kids played very hard.\" \nThe Cavaliers snapped the Vikings four-game winning streak and improved to 6-2 overall and 2-1 in CSL action. \n\"It's just a testament to our character,\" Daggs said of the team's comeback victory. \"We never give up. Even though we were down at half, we were coming back fighting. No matter what, we knew it was going to be tough because Kingsburg's a great team. We just had to come back and keep fighting. We knew the outcome would be in our favor.\" \nKingsburg", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T10:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T05:57:33.361+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
