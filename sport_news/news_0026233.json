But it's unclear yet if that will lead to good news on the football field for Rutgers ' star wide receiver.\nA temporary restraining order against Carroo was dismissed on Tuesday morning at the Middlesex County Family Courthouse. Lawyers for Carroo and the woman who alleged she was slammed to the ground by the wide receiver on Sept. 12 said they expect a simple assault charge against Carroo to be dismissed at hearing scheduled for 4:30 p.m. on Tuesday at Piscataway municipal court.\nThat puts the ball in Kyle Flood's court, as the Rutgers coach must decide whether or not to reinstate Carroo from his indefinite suspension. Rutgers hosts No. 4 Michigan State on Saturday (8 p.m., BTN).\n\"We are aware of the proceedings this morning and understand that there are more proceedings this afternoon,\" a football program spokesman said in a statement. \"We will continue to gather information and do not have any comment on his status at this time.\"\nCarroo has been suspended from the team since he was arrested for his role in an altercation involving his girlfriend and the other woman, who was a Rutgers recruiting ambassador at the time of the incident.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T23:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-07T02:53:03.973+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
