Game: Cherokee (3-1, 1-1) at Wheeler (3-2, 2-1), 7:30 p.m.Last year: Cherokee 35, Wheeler 26All-time series: Wheeler leads 25-8Prediction: Cherokee 35, Wheeler 24Cherokee and Wheeler enter their game tonight in similar places. Both will be looking to avoid a second region loss, something that will be reliant on their run games doing well.The styles of running games, however, are quite different. Cherokee (3-1, 1-1 Region 5 ) employs a more traditional running attack, while Wheeler (3-2, 2-1) relies more on misdirection in its option-oriented offense.Just like they know how important it will be to establish their own running games, the coaches know the importance of limiting the other team. “I think the team that can come out, establish a strong running game, control the ball a little bit and keep the other team’s offense off the field is probably going to have a little bit of an advantage,” said Wheeler coach Mike Collins, a Cherokee alum and former assistant. “I do think there will be some explosive plays, but I think, for the most part, that the running game will be key on both sides. We need to try to stop their running game on defense and try to establish ours on offense.”Wheeler will have to slow down Cherokee’s Brittain Brown. The Duke commitment rushed for 266 yards and five touchdowns two weeks ago in the Warriors’ 58-14 win over Pope.If Wheeler can slow down Brown, Cherokee will have to rely on quarterback Nolan Donley, something coach Josh Shaw said the team is prepared for.“Our offense is fairly simple,” Shaw said. “We’re going to take what they give us. If they’re loading up on the perimeter to try and stop our guys on the outside, we’re going to run. And, if they’re loading up to stop the run, we’re going to try to establish the pass. That’s something we hope to be able to do and, obviously, we will try to get our athletic kids in space so they can create some plays.”Because the teams are so close in the region standings, tonight’s game will have key implications in determining which four teams reach the state playoffs from Region 5 .“This is a big game for us,” Shaw said. “Not only is it a region game and the next game, but you start dropping games in the region at this point, and it’s almost a two-game swing. Not only does it put you with a loss and the other team with a win, but they also now hold the tiebreaker scenario over you. We need to go on the road this week and try and get one.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T08:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T07:40:56.311+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
