I can say I'm a winner now. I won on the Web.com Tour, I won on the Latin America Tour, but it didn't feel right. \n\"I knew what I was capable of, I just didn't get there before Sunday. But yeah, there's a lot of confidence there. I really can't wait for Thursday to tee off. The weather is unbelievable out here and it's a great week. It's Vegas. \n\"I have my wife, my father-in-law and pretty much my whole team right here, so we're going to enjoy a good week. I did put some champagne in the trophy (on Sunday), but it wasn't that much.\" \nGrillo will play the opening two rounds alongside American pair Charley Hoffman and Ryan Moore, who both attended the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. \n\"It's going to be fun,\" he added. \"I think I'm going to pay more attention to what they do and try to learn from them.\" \nWorld number five Rickie Fowler is the top ranked player in the field and has been paired with Ryder Cup captain Davis Love and Jimmy Walker for the first two rounds. Fowler and Walker halved three and won one of their four matches together in last year's Ryder Cup at Gleneagles.
