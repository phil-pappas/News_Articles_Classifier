Paire won the set with a powerful backhand winner down the line to break the second-seeded Nishikori, who was bidding for his third Japan Open title. \nPaire, who had 11 aces and saved seven of nine break points, raced ahead 4-1 in the third set and secured the win on his first match point when Nishikori hit a lob long. \nPaire, who captured his first ATP title at Bastad in July, also beat Nishikori in the U.S. Open first round this year. \nFrench Open winner Wawrinka had eight aces to beat Gilles Muller 6-4, 7-6 (5). \nThe Swiss reached his fourth final of the year when Muller angled his backhand volley wide in the tiebreaker. \nIn Sunday's final, Wawrinka will be looking to add to his wins at Chennai, Rotterdam and Roland Garros. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T12:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T15:32:34.596+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
