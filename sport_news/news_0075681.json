Tulsa World JENKS, Okla. — \nBroken Arrow took some unlikely routes Friday night to its biggest football victory since its journey to the 2011 state title game. \nDespite picking up only one first down in the second half, the third-ranked Tigers rallied from being down 13 points late in the third quarter to stun top-ranked Jenks 35-34 at Hunter-Dwelley Stadium. \nIt was the first home loss for Jenks since dropping a triple-overtime decision to Booker T. Washington in 2006. \nThe victory gives Broken Arrow (7-1, 5-0) sole possession of the District 6AI-1 lead over Jenks (6-1, 4-1), which is looking for a fourth consecutive state title, with two games remaining. It was Broken Arrow’s first win over Jenks since 2011.
