I couldn't have asked for a more committed group of players and coaches to work with. \n\"We've had a very tough year in 2015 but despite this, we've received overwhelming support from the majority of fans and this shows the unity and family feeling that Sussex engenders. \n\"My increasing commitments with Ireland and the stage in my career that I'm at meant that the job this year became more a burden than a challenge to be relished. \n\"So the time is definitely right to hand over the reins to a new captain and whoever that is will have my full support. \n\"I'm also very determined to get back to scoring lots of runs and helping us back into the first division of the championship and to performing much better in white-ball cricket. \n\"We have so much talent in the dressing room and so many good people throughout the club that I'm certain we'll bounce straight back from this season.\" \nSussex's professional cricket manager Mark Robinson said, \"I'd like to thank Ed for all of his hard work and dedication that he has put into the job. \n\"He has always led the team with great integrity and commitment, and I'm sure that the new captain will appreciate having a player of the stature of Ed to be able to lean on for advice and support.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T15:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T17:35:25.581+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
