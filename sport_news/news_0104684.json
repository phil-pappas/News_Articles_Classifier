However, his maiden bowl victory with Louisiana-Lafayette over San Diego State has now been vacated.\nThe university states that it \"strongly considered\" a self-imposed postseason ban this season, but decided that would be \"unduly severe to address violations committed by a single individual that were in no way indicative of systematic, program-wide noncompliance with NCAA rules.\"\nThe reductions in recruiting includes cutting periods for off-campus recruiting by a total of 40 days during the current and previous academic years, as well as reduced communications with prospective recruits during a three week period this fall.\nThe university does not dispute the allegations of test-score fraud, which entailed Saunders advising recruits to take their ACTs at a specific test center in Wayne County, Mississippi, where he had a relationship with the supervisor administering the test. That supervisor, Ginny Crager, allegedly agreed to change recruits' answers as needed to produce more favorable results.\nLouisiana-Lafayette is disputing that there is sufficient evidence to conclude Saunders gave cash to a recruit.\nThe NCAA notified Louisiana-Lafayette that the alleged violations represent a \"severe breach of conduct.\"\nThe NCAA's formal notice of allegations is dated last May 22. A response from the university, dated Aug. 20, states that Louisiana-Lafayette worked collaboratively with NCAA enforcement staff from the time allegations first surfaced in December 2013 against Saunders, who was also an assistant recruiting coordinator. The university also noted that Saunders was fired when \"it became clear\" by last October that violations had occurred. The university also stated that it immediately withheld student-athletes whose test scores were in question from further participation.\nDocuments from the NCAA and university state that Saunders has denied wrongdoing but also has refused to cooperate with investigators.\nFarmer said that later this fall, university officials will appear at a closed NCAA hearing and that the university cannot comment further until the probe had concluded.\n___\nAP college football website: collegefootball.ap.org", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T21:38:34.460+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
