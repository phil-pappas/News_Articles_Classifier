The 49ers defeated the Ravens 25-20. The San Francisco 49ers had some inside information on Shareece Wright, and they used it to their advantage when facing the defensive back on Sunday.\nAdChoices The Niners released Wright last week per his request after making him a healthy scratch for the first four games of the season. The Baltimore Ravens picked him up, and he had terrible results when the teams played in Week 6.\nThe 49ers won the game 25-20 and burned Wright on both of Colin Kaepernick’s touchdown passes. The big one came on a 76-yard bomb to Torrey Smith.\nSan Francisco had seen Wright up-close for several months and knew he wasn’t good enough to activate for games, so it was natural that they would pick on him when they had a chance to face him.\nAnquan Boldin said 49ers purposely targeted Shareece Wright today. Said when you practice a lot against a player you know his weaknesses.\n— Matt Barrows (@mattbarrows) October 19, 2015\nWhen a rival team picks up a player who was on a previous team, usually the player can provide some inside info to help the new team. In this case, the former team had the advantage because they got to take advantage of an inferior player.\n“I’m part of this defense and I gave up a big play,” Wright said via The Baltimore Sun . “I know that’s on me. I’ll take ownership on that on my behalf. I can’t allow that to happen.”\nWright will probably feel pretty embarrassed after he reads Boldin’s comments — even more embarrassed than when he got destroyed on a hit by Andrew Luck . The Ravens will also have to give second thoughts to giving him a big role moving forward. Having him out there was a liability Sunday.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.yardbarker.com/", "http://www.baltimoresun.com/sports/ravens/bs-sp-ravens-49ers-notebook-1019-20151018-story.html", "https://twitter.com/mattbarrows/status/655897590513274880", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "http://larrybrownsports.com/college-football/andrew-luck-delivers-the-hit-of-the-year-on-shareece-wright-video/33513"], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T18:56:16.776+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
