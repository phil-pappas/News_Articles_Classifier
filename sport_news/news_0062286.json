Taking a free kick from 40 yards out, Yoder sent a beauty over a horde of leaping players and into the back of the net with 22 minutes remaining, serving as the decisive goal in G-A’s 1-0 victory against Red Lion during a District 3-AAA boys’ soccer play-in game at Kaley Field. With the win, the Blue Devils (14-6) advance to face No. 2 Cumberland Valley in Tuesday’s first round, a contest that will be hosted by the Eagles at 5 p.m. “I think the keeper was waiting for a skim, but it just ended up pretty much going straight in,” G-A coach Scott Gelsinger said. “Hey, we’ll take it.” A significant portion of the action took place in the midfield, with both sides having limited chances to break the scoreless tie. Despite a few late rushes by Red Lion (8-6-3), the Blue Devils made Yoder’s goal stand, moving on to the Round of 16. “We had some opportunities early that would have been nice to finish, but defensively, I felt we played pretty smart,” Gelsinger said. “You don’t want to leave a good team hang around, especially when it only takes one. Still, we’re happy to get the win and move on.” Complemented by the defensive trio of Yoder, Damian Sherrill and Austyn Smith, keeper Bryson Robinson made a pair of nice saves on Red Lion corner kicks during the first half, ultimately culminating in the shutout.
