Oak Ridge's Dan Neikirk should teach a course in patience.\nMost deer hunting stories begin and end more or less in the same day or, at most, the same few days. Neikirk has one that begins in 2012 and didn't end until just a few minutes before dark on Thursday night.\nBut it was a pretty good ending.\nFor those who like jumping ahead and reading the last chapter of a book: Thursday night, Neikirk bagged a 17-point buck in Anderson County. When he put it on the scales at Adams' Taxidermy in Claxton, the deer weighed 194 pounds field dressed and has been rough scored at 180 inches.\n\"That's a big deer if it came from Kansas or Illinois or anywhere in the world,\" J.O. Adams said. \"It's as impressive a deer as I've seen come through here.\"\nFor the whole story you have to go back to 2012 and a stolen tree stand.\n\"One of my stands had been stolen and I wanted to see if another one of my stands was still there,\" Neikirk said. \"It was when I was walking to that stand that I saw this deer for the first time. I was walking and then I saw this really big rack.\"\nNeikirk knows big when he sees it, but that day he was looking for a stand and not a deer. A few weeks later on Nov. 30, 2012, he saw the deer again and got a shot at it.\nIt seemed to be a really big 10-point, but it had gotten away. A few months later, when the season was over and he had put trail cams in the area, he saw that the buck was still alive and kicking.\nAnd he kept growing.\nNeikirk saw the buck again in September of 2013, but then he disappeared for several weeks. When he saw him again he could tell it was the same deer, but he had obviously been busy.\n\"He showed back up but he was all busted up,\" Neikirk said about the buck's antlers. \"The next year it was the same thing.\"\nSame buck, same story: Neikirk saw him in September, but then the buck fell off the radar. He returned later in the season and, again, his antlers showed the wear and tear of having been in a scrap or two.\n\"I really didn't want to shoot him looking like that,\" he said.\nWith three seasons of having hunted the same deer under his belt, Neikirk knew the routine: If he didn't get the buck in September he wasn't likely to see him again until well after the rut was over.\nWhile a lot of hunters might have passed on Thursday afternoon and the rainy weather, Neikirk figured the chill and damp might get the deer up and moving before the big rains set in. Not too long before dark, he saw a 7-point moving through the area and knew that deer, at times, was a running mate of the big buck.\nNeikirk has a long history of letting smallish bucks walk. The last buck he put a tag on was one with a mainframe 8 that had a kicker tine in 2011 that scored in the 130s. So he was more interested in seeing what might come with the 7-point. About 10 minutes later the 17-point showed himself.\n\"In all those years he made one mistake,\" Neikirk said of the buck. \"Right before dark he came into about 30 yards. It was by far the closest I had been to him.\"\nAdams said by his reckoning the opening week of the bow season has been a good one, with more than 90 deer brought to his shop the first two days. As in past years, the key is the weather.\nSaid Adams: \"If we get good weather, especially on the opening days of the muzzleloader and rifle seasons, this should be a good one.\"\nAt the Neikirk house a good one is already in the bank.\n\"I'm still kind of numb,\" he said. \"It has been three years of me seeing him off and on, but Thursday night there he was.\"\nBy The Way: Adams' Taxidermy won the Tennessee Wildlife Federations \"Dan and Cherie Hammond Sharing the Harvest Award\" for its work with the Hunters For the Hungry Program.\nLast year Adams' Taxidermy donated 4,700 pounds of venison to Hunters for the Hungry. Since becoming a part of the program Adams' Taxidermy alone has provided more than 100,000 meals worth of venison.\n\"It's people like J.O. Adams that make this program work,\" said Michael Butler, CEO of the TWF. \"For a lot of people across the state this is a really, really important program. We appreciate what he and the other deer processors across the state do every year.\"\nBob Hodge is a freelance contributor.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T05:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T06:31:48.417+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
