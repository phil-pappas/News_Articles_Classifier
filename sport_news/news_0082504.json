Repeatedly. The plan has the Mets either pushing him back or basically skipping his subsequent start off Tuesday. So deGrom attempted to function pitching coach Dan Warthen.\n“I was talking to Dan [Friday] in the dugout a little bit and said, ‘So how’s Tuesday looking?’ and I stated it to him a couple of times, but they decided not to let me throw Tuesday,” deGrom mentioned. “He kept saying, ‘We’ll see. We’ll see.’ ”\nAnd that is either coach or parent speak for “No.”\nManager Terry Collins explained that in deGrom’s final handful of starts, “you could just see the place of his pitches is not where it requirements to be” and deGrom was up in the zone so the Mets decided to give him some rest. Final season, deGrom was sensational in September right after coming off the DL. Collins did not indicate when deGrom would pitch next.\n“I do not know if I necessarily require it, but I do not believe it can hurt,” said deGrom, who will be replaced for a single game by Logan Verrett. “It’s what they chose to do, so that is what we’re going to do.”\n“I’ve been a lot more up in the zone than I want to be. Commonly I pitch down and then go up when I want to. I haven’t been capable to get the ball down. … I’d like to say it was just one start out, but I don’t believe I’m tired and I think I’m all right.”\nDeGrom admitted rest helped final season when “there was some shoulder fatigue” but this time “I really feel fine.”\nCollins dismissed a report that indicated Matt Harvey will be capped about 70 pitches Sunday.\n“There is no pitch count,” Collins mentioned. “I’m just going to limit his workload and that will be my decision, when I think he ought to come out.If he’s functioning really challenging, it may possibly be earlier. If he’s cruising, it may possibly be later. But he’s not going to go deep into the game. We’ll just see how he does and how they react to him.”\nTyler Clippard was unavailable for a second straight day due to the fact of soreness in his reduced back. Collins said the ideal-hander may be provided a rest until Monday just to be cautious.\nLucas Duda will be in the lineup against Yankees lefty CC Sabathia, according to Collins. Duda went 1-for-two ahead of receiving pinch hit for by Juan Uribe with the bases loaded in the sixth inning of the Mets’ five- loss to the Yankees.\n ", "external_links": ["http://nypost.com/2015/09/19/degrom-may-be-skipped-on-tuesday-but-its-not-his-idea/"], "published": "2015-09-20T06:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T10:06:15.688+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
