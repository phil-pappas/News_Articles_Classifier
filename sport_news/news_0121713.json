The Panthers took advantage of their visitors’ confusion, especially forward Johnny Davidson. The senior drifted into space at will, and at one point, was surprised he remained so open. \nDavidson found the net four times to lead the Panthers to a dominant 7-2 victory. He scored off of a corner kick, a long throw-in, and twice more after receiving passes down the middle. \n“Just the passes to me were going good,” Davidson said. “My team pretty much fed me all those goals.” \nStevensville’s defense did little to mark him. On his first goal, defenders were nowhere to be found as he stood at the far post and made an uncontested header off a corner kick for a 2-0 lead in the ninth minute. \n“I was looking around and thought, ‘OK this is good,’” he said. “No one is on me.” \nThe goal came just three minutes after Kyler Linton converted a penalty kick. About 10 minutes later, Zach Smith’s long throw-in bounced into open space and Davidson converted again. \nPanthers head coach Ric Plante attributed the relatively easy offensive effort to his formless front three. \n“We play with three up top, but we don’t give them a position,” Plante said. “They are free to move about as long as we keep a good team shape on the field. They are constantly in motion, and because of that, they find themselves open at times.” \nStevensville’s Quade Renstrom scored off a free kick from about 10 yards beyond the penalty area, and Belgrade led at halftime, 3-1. Renstrom’s shot was just his teams’ second in the first half. \nThe Panthers challenged for possession as soon as the Yellowjackets touched the ball and intercepted passes at midfield. If not for Renstrom’s free kick attempt that bounded off a Belgrade defender and into the net, and then a penalty kick in the second half, which Renstrom converted, the shutout would have been secured. \n“All of us are working harder than the other team,” Davidson said. “We have really good team chemistry and we’re really good at filling space between opponents. It feels like next week, we’re just going to play just as good and I don’t think anyone will be able to stop us if we play just as good.” \nAdded Plante, “We wanted to possess the ball, and we hadn’t seen Stevensville, but I had a good idea of their style of play and we tried to counter that with our training sessions last week. I think we did a good job.” \nBelgrade was without starters Jeffrey DeBuse and Ethan Monlux, who were out with injuries, but Plante said they should be back by next weekend’s semifinal. \nThe Panthers (11-1-1) have reached the semifinals now three consecutive years. \nHAMILTON 1, BELGRADE 1, HAMILTON WINS IN SHOOTOUT, 2-1: The Panthers misfired on their first three attempts of a penalty kick shootout and fell in the quarterfinal of the Class A girls state tournament. \nThe score was knotted at one after 80 minutes and remained the same through two overtime periods. Belgrade freshman Mariah Morgan scored an unassisted goal in the 55th minute, but 10 minutes later, Reilly Rosstad tallied the equalizer. \nPanthers goalkeeper Emily Cady made eight saves and Larami Schara had 11. \nBelgrade ended its first season under Celine Valentin 5-7-1. \nMichael Appelgate can be reached at mappelgate@dailychronicle.com or 582-2670.
