His bowling being a plus point may earn him a place in the first Test. \nJonny Bairstow, who made a half-century in the first warm-up match, fell for nought while all-rounder Ben Stoke also failed to score, his second failure on the tour. \nBell and Taylor added 102 for the third wicket before the later retired to give others some batting practice. Bell hit four boundaries and a six during his sedate 100-ball stint. \nTaylor knocked six boundaries during his 123-ball stay. \nFor Pakistan 'A' left-arm paceman Mir Hamza finished with 4-34 while Junaid Khan and Zafar Gohar took two wickets apiece. \nThe two teams will also play four one-day and three Twenty20 internationals after the Tests. \nAbbreviated Scores: Pakistan 'A' 192-9 dec (Adnan Akmal 74 not out; S. Finn 4-16, Adil Rashid 3-53) \nEngland 198-9 (J. Taylor 61, I.
