We know this because he won awards for Best Quote: and Best Social Media Campaign by a Brand (for this and this ). But we also know it because he spent a few seconds humping a middle-aged woman at the show. The moment was captured by a Twitter user who was there and promptly uploaded to YouTube for all to see:\nI was within 2 feet of @RobGronkowski last night and then this happened and I dont think ill ever get over it https://t.co/sWfnMQFmQF\n— Cbordas (@bordasc) October 7, 2015 WTF?
