(Photo: John T. Greilick, Detroit News) \nCONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Michigan interim athletic director Jim Hackett, in an open letter on Sunday to the Michigan community, sounded off on those who took vicious shots at Michigan punter Blake O'Neill after a late-game error in the 27-23 loss to Michigan State.\nO'Neill took a low snap from Scott Sypniewski, dropped it, picked it up and spun around and attempted t kick but fumbled into the hands of Michigan State's Jalen Watts-Jackson, who scored on a 38-yard return giving the Spartans a 27-23 victory on Saturday at Michigan Stadium.\nSome fans responded with vitriol directed at O'Neill through social media. Hackett praised the team's effort in his open letter saying the game proved \"the progress that we are making in our football program.\" But he also addressed the nastiness an outcome and produce.\n\"Today I awake to the shocking reality that our community who care so much about this program would send hurtful, spiteful and vicious comments to one of our students,\" Hackett wrote. \"To be clear, such comments come from a small minority, none of whom are reflective of our institution.\n\"The program I know at MICHIGAN speaks about the team, the team the team. The people I have been associated with my whole life around this fantastic program — some whom are living and some whom have passed on — would never, I repeat never, spread blame.\n\"As our head coach said yesterday, '…this outcome will steel our spine.'\n\"That means all of us.\n\"I'm asking that our community not lose this game twice by condoning thoughtless comments and remember the Fielding Yost comment that this is the 'Michigan of ours.'\"\nI don't care what any college player does to your Saturday afternoon mood. They are all student-athletes and they don't owe you a thing.\n— Zoltan Mesko (@ZoltanMesko) October 17, 2015 achengelis@detroitnews.com \ntwitter.com/chengelis", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T16:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T20:39:21.064+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
