The Chiefs (1-5) had eight penalties enforced for 95 yards.\nDiggs had 129 yards on seven catches on a day when Bridgewater threw two interceptions. Adrian Peterson, who was on the sideline late in the game with the Vikings trying to put it away, finished with 60 yards on 26 carries.\nHKN-BLUES-JETS \nTarasenko scores twice, Blues beat Jets 4-2\nWINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) - Vladimir Tarasenko scored twice and Brian Elliott made 26 saves in the St. Louis Blues' 4-2 victory over the Winnipeg Jets on Sunday.\nTarasenko gave the Blues a 3-2 lead on a delayed penalty midway through the third period, firing a shot past goalie Ondrej Pavelec and into the corner of the net for his fifth goal of the season.\nScottie Upshall and Carl Gunnarsson also scored for St. Louis. The Blues have won four straight to improve to 5-1-0.\nNikolaj Ehlers and Mathieu Perreault scored for Winnipeg, and Pavelec stopped 37 shots. The Jets dropped to 4-2-0.\nALCS-ROYALS-YOUNG \nRoyals Chris Young to start Game 4 of ALCS\nTORONTO (AP) - Royals manager Ned Yost has chosen Chris Young over Kris Medlen as his starter for Game 4 of the ALCS.\nYoung has only made two starts since July 28, but they were good ones. He allowed one run in 11 1-3 innings over those two outings, with his final start coming Oct. 2.\nThe 6-foot-10, third-round draft pick out of Princeton in 2000 appeared as a reliever in Game 1 of the ALDS, giving up a run in four innings. Overall, he was 11-6 in 34 appearances - 18 starts - this year.\nYoung faced the Blue Jays once this year, a 7-5 loss on July 11. Edwin Encarnacion hit a two-run shot and Young yielded five hits and three runs over six innings. But over his 11-year career, Young has held current members of the Blue Jays to a .229 average (22 for 96) with two homers.\nMedlen was 6-2 with a 4.01 ERA in 15 appearances, including eight starts, this year. He returned from Tommy John surgery on July 20 and hasn't pitched since Oct. 1.\nCAR-NASCAR-KANSAS \nLogano spins out Kenseth late, wins at Kansas Speedway\nKANSAS CITY, Kan.
