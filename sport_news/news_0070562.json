(AP) — Oklahoma’s pass defense was a liability last season, and it appeared more of the same was in store this year after Tulsa torched the Sooners for 427 yards through the air a month ago. \nSince then, Oklahoma has been stellar against the pass. In league games, the 17th-ranked Sooners (5-1, 2-1 Big 12) lead the conference in scoring defense, pass defense and interceptions and are second in sacks. Overall, Oklahoma ranks ninth nationally in pass defense. \nThe Sooners will be tested this week. Texas Tech (5-2, 2-2) ranks second nationally in passing yards per game (427.6), second in total offense (623.7) and third in scoring offense (49.4). Tech quarterback Patrick Mahomes already has thrown for 2,628 yards and 20 touchdowns this season, and he’s rushed for six more scores.
