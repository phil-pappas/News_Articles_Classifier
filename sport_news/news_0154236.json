Meanwhile, the No. 13 Pioneers have finished second to Whitewater twice during that span, qualifying for the postseason in 2012. \nBoth teams are 3-0 and are coming off thrilling come-from-behind wins. The Warhawks got a 6-yard Jordan Ratliffe touchdown run with 38 seconds remaining to earn a 33-30 win over NAIA top-ranked Morningside College (Iowa) last Thursday. \n“When I scheduled that Morningside game last spring that was really my purpose,” said UW-W head coach Kevin Bullis. “I knew it was going to be a tough game — we needed that because we’re jumping into a heavy portion of our conference right at the beginning with Platteville, Oshkosh and La Crosse — we needed a good test. Win or lose, it was very important to come out of this game knowing what areas we need to focus on.” \nMeanwhile, UW-P tallied 21 unanswered points in the fourth quarter and scored in overtime to stun then-No. 13 North Central (Ill.), 35-28, on Sept. 19. \n“The WIAC is a long haul and it’s a heck of a battle each week no matter who you play; anybody can beat anyone on any given Saturday, so you’ve got to come ready to go,” said Bullis. \nThe Pioneers are led by their passing attack which ranks second among WIAC teams at 310.7 yards per game through the air. Junior Tom Kelly leads that aerial assault having completed over 65 percent (75-of-114) of his passes for 908 yards. Kelly has thrown a WIAC-high nine touchdowns, while only being intercepted twice. \n“What they do at Platteville is definitely a spread offense, like Belhaven was, but it’s another test for our guys in the defensive backfield,” said Bullis. “The key thing for us is keeping it simple for our players — on the defensive side of the ball keeping it simple because of their passing attack and their ability to run the ball as well, \n“They will attack you and attack you with speed and frenzy.” \nKelly’s main two receivers, 6-foot-6 junior Dan Arnold and 6-4 senior Mitch Munda, have combined for 33 receptions 391 yards, five touchdowns in three games. \nFor Whitewater, Ratliffe leads the WIAC in rushing with 354 yards on just 45 carries, an average of 7.9 yards/carry, while scoring five touchdowns. \nSenior Dennis Moore returns to the lineup after missing the last two games with an injury. \n“He’s been practicing all week so we’re hoping everything’s OK,” said Bullis of last year’s leading rusher. \nNick Patterson also has been practicing after being injured in the Morningside game. \nJunior defensive linemen John Flood and Brandon Tamsett each have two quarterback sacks, while Vince Mason and J.D. Marconi each have one interception to headline the UW-W defense. \n21ST GEORGE CHRYST \nMEMORIAL BOWL \nSaturday's contest also marks the 21st annual George Chryst Memorial Bowl for the Miner's Pick, the rivalry game trophy. The game is named for Chryst, a former head football coach and athletic director at UW-Platteville for more than a decade who died suddenly in 1992. \nChryst was the father of University of Wisconsin head football coach Paul Chryst. \nNEWS & NOTES: \nThis is the 108th meeting between the two programs dating back to 1895.
