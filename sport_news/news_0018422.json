Rundle and a group of players from Monona Grove's 1977 state championship team will be honored at halftime of the Silver Eagles' home game on Friday. \n“Coach” has passed on. \nDick Rundle, who lost only 30 football games during a 25-year period of his 34-year coaching career, died early Thursday morning at the age of 80. \nHe leaves behind the reputation of a man who not only demanded excellence from those he taught and coach, he followed the same example himself. \n“It was just awful. ... I love him. I love him so much,” said former Monona Grove football coach Mike Stassi, who played under Rundle and at the University of Wisconsin and was head coach at Monona Grove from 1999 to 2014. \n“He was the greatest coach I ever had, and I got to play at the UW,” Stassi said. “He was not just my coach or my mentor, he felt like a father to me in many ways. And that’s true of so many of the young men he has helped over the years.” \nRundle joined the football coaching staff at Monona Grove High School in 1956, became head coach in 1962 and led the Silver Eagles until 1989. He had an overall record of 165-50-3. His teams produced 15 conference championships, four undefeated seasons and two state championships. \nPlayers joked that Rundle was known by various nicknames, ranging from “Coach” to “Mr. Rundle” to “The Preacher” to even “Here Comes Hell.” \n“He made a lot of good teams look great. He knew how to push each kid’s buttons to make the most out of him,” Stassi said. \nRundle also led the Monona Grove boys golf team to the 1987 WIAA state title, making him one of only a few coaches in Wisconsin history to coach state championship teams in multiple sports. \nIn 2014, Rundle was joined by about two dozen members of his coaching staff and former players in an honors ceremony held during halftime of a football game at Monona Grove’s John Klement Stadium — named after Klement, another Monona Grove legend and the school's original football coach, who passed away in 2014. \nAt the time of the ceremony, Rundle discussed his reputation as a taskmaster who demanded that his players perform to the best of their abilities. \n“The idea of competing was important to me. The idea of winning was real important to me, because too many people say winning isn’t everything,” Rundle said. “But my comeback to that is that it is so much easier to teach when you win. \n“Go out there as a losing coach in a losing program and see how much teaching you can get done. But if you’re winning, those kids are just staring at you all the time. The concentration is always there. Wanting to succeed is always there.” \nThe National High School Coaches Association named Rundle to its Hall of Fame in 2003. He also is a member of the Luther College Hall of Fame, served on the National High School Coaches Association Board of Directors, and for decades served as executive director of the Wisconsin Football Coaches Association. \n“It is with a heavy heart that we inform you of the passing of our Executive Director Emeritus, Dick Rundle,” current WFCA executive director Dan Brunner wrote on the association’s website. “Under Dick’s leadership, the WFCS became one of the most respected coaches associations in the nation. \n“He made every decision based on what was best for the Wisconsin Football Coaches Association. We have lost a great man and, for many of us, a dear friend.” \nInformation on funeral services for Rundle will be posted at the WFCA’s website, www.wifca.org . +1 Former Monona Grove High School football coach Dick Rundle CONTRIBUTED Related", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T23:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T15:24:14.398+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
