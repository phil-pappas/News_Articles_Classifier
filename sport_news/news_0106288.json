Cooper-USA TODAY Sports Boston Red Sox former catcher Jason Varitek has reportedly drawn interest from Seattle Mariners to take over the open manager position. Jason Varitek apparently is interested in reuniting with the organization he began his career with.\nVaritek recently interviewed with the Seattle Mariners for their open managerial position, according to multiple reports. CBSSports.com’s Jon Heyman was the first to report the news.\nAdChoices The former Boston Red Sox captain is among a handful of candidates the Mariners are considering, per the Boston Herald. Varitek currently serves as a Red Sox special assistant, and the Herald indicates Varitek will remain in the same role next season — if he isn’t hired by the Mariners.\nVaritek was drafted by the Mariners in the first round of the 1994 draft out of Georgia Tech. The backstop ultimately was traded with Derek Lowe to Boston for Heathcliff Slocumb in 1997, a trade that proved vital to the Red Sox eventually winning the World Series in 2004. Varitek also was on the Red Sox team that won it all in 2007.\nVaritek, 43, has no managerial experience.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.bostonherald.com/sports/red_sox_mlb/clubhouse_insider/2015/10/sources_jason_varitek_interviewed_for_seattle_mariners", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "http://www.cbssports.com/mlb/writer/jon-heyman/25346962/jason-varitek-interviewed-for-vacant-seattle-mariners-manager-job"], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T08:47:01.423+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
