If we have to attack then we will do and when we need to defend then we are able to do that. Basically we are an attacking side.\"\nIn an earlier press conference Blanc said it would be a battle between two styles of football.\n\"I think Madrid are quite defensive but also efficient and let in few goals,\" said Blanc.\n\"We are going to see two separate styles. I want to have the ball and from what I have seen of Madrid they defend and go out on the counter-attack.\"\nIt is a crunch game at the top of Group A with both sides on six points from two games.\nReal face PSG in the midst of an injury crisis with Gareth Bale, Karim Benzema and James Rodriguez among those missing.\nHowever, Benitez is confident that Luka Modric and Sergio Ramos are ready to return.\n\"Modric has been brought here because we think he is fit. We will now have to see how he is in training,\" he said.\n\"Sergio knows that if he has an injection then he will be able to play but after that he will have some pain.\"\n(For more sports news and updates, follow Ahram Online Sports on Twitter at @AO_Sports and on Facebook at AhramOnlineSports .)", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/AO_Sports", "https://www.facebook.com/AhramOnlineSports?fref=ts"], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T23:27:27.133+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
