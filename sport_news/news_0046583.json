If this was the quarter-final, he would be playing.\" \n\"We've got enough depth to be able to say, 'hey, we don't have to risk people if they're not 100 per cent'.\" \nNumber eight Kieran Read takes over leadership duties in McCaw's absence, while centre Ma'a Nonu will become the sixth All Black to win 100 Test caps after McCaw, Keven Mealamu, Tony Woodcock, Dan Carter and Mils Muliaina. \nReflecting on Nonu's achievement, Hansen added: \"The first conversation I ever had with him was that we don't think you're fit enough and we want you to go to sevens. He went there and changed himself. \n\"He went from being a blockbusting, hard-running centre to a really fit centre who could then play for long periods into the game. He's developed the skills over the period and is a beautiful passing centre as well as a blockbusting runner. \n\"He has grown into a leader within the group. He doesn't say a lot, but when he does speak it's right on the money. He asks a lot of himself and cares a lot about the team - and we care a lot about him. \n\"It's a fantastic achievement to play one Test for the All Blacks let alone 100, and he should be very proud of himself.\" \nNew Zealand have already booked a place in the quarter-finals, where they are set to face Ireland or France, although their performances to date have not been of the vintage variety. \n\"Physically, we will be ready, I have no doubt about that. And I know that mentally we are a strong side,\" Hansen said. \n\"So we've just got to go out, really enjoy that game (Tonga) and then look forward to whoever it is we play at the Millennium Stadium (in the quarter-final). Walk towards the pressure and enjoy it. \n\"That's what we play Test matches for. The bigger the challenge, the better it is. You don't get too many opportunities to play anything bigger, so we may as well look forward to that and get excited by it, which I know we are.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-07T19:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T19:55:14.781+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
