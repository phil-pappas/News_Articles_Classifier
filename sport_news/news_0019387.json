(Stan Behal/Toronto Sun) \nSo how did Jose Bautista cap off his game-winning home run for the Toronto Blue Jays to clinch their AL Division Series on Wednesday night? \nBy being as low-key as possible. \nBautista, who swatted a three-run home run against the Texas Rangers during a crazy seventh inning that lasted nearly an hour, went home late in the evening on a kick scooter. \nMatthew King snapped a photo of the Jays outfielder riding home and posted the image to his Instagram account @kingermr . \nBautista confirmed it was him on the scooter Thursday evening and reposted it with the tagline \"Caught me ridin' dirty...\" after TSN promoted the image on Instagram.
