(Photo: Associated Press) \nGreyson Lambert has gone from \"uh oh\" to oh wow at Georgia. \nThe Virginia transfer has completed 76.5 of his passes to rank second nationally in completion percentage, but didn't show any signs he'd be that accurate at the start of fall camp. \n\"The first day, he didn't throw very good at all and I now know it's attributed to a lot of nervous energy the first time going out there to practice for Georgia and all that, but he struggled,\" said Georgia coach Mark Richt with a slight chuckle Wednesday. \"He was not throwing the ball well at all and that was the first time I saw him live and I was like, uh oh, we might be in trouble.\" \nThose troubles have evaporated into tremendous production for the junior transfer from Jesup, Georgia. \nLambert had a stretch this season in which he completed a school-record 22 consecutive passes over a two-game span. Twenty of those completions came against South Carolina when he set an NCAA record for completion percentage by going 24-of-25 (96% percent) for 330 yards and three touchdowns in a 52-20 victory over the Gamecocks. \n\"He settled down and began to throw the ball better,\" continued Richt on the SEC coaches call. \"The more the receivers run their routes and make the breaks and react to certain coverages, the more reps you get, the more certain you are of what angles guys are going to take and speed the players you're playing with and all. He was able to become more and more accurate at time went on of just the reps of working with everybody.\" \nAll those numbers will be put to the test Saturday against No. 13-ranked Alabama (3-1, 0-1 SEC) at Samford Stadium in Athens. \n\"What he's seen so far, I think he's reacted well to, but there are a lot of thing he's has experienced yet, at least at Georgia, as far as playing from behind or getting sacked a few times or even throwing an interception,\" Richt said. \n\"He hasn't even thrown an interception yet so there will be some things that will come up that he'll have to deal with and react to and I have full confident that he'll be able to handle those things, but it will be an adjustment to react to some adversity.\" \nWhat makes Lambert's production at Georgia so fascinating is he wasn't exactly on point at Virginia. Lambert finished last season with a 59 percent completion percentage and threw 10 touchdowns to 11 interceptions for the Cavaliers. \nThis season, Lambert already has seven touchdown passes and hasn't been picked off once this season. Then again, the Cavaliers didn't have the running game Georgia does to keep defenses honest. \nAs a team, Virginia rushed for 1,653 yards in 12 games last season. Through only four games, Georgia already has 1,031 rushing yards with Nick Chubb accounting for 599. \nGeorgia should have a tougher time running on the nation's fourth-best rushing defense Saturday. The Crimson Tide are surrendering just 56.8 yards on the ground, but If they can't slow down Chubb and Georgia's ground game, Lambert is fully capable of exploiting their suspect pass defense. \n\"If we run the ball well enough and get some 1-on-1 situations, our receivers have got to win,\" Richt said. \"Our tight ends, our running backs, whoever it may be, they've got to win and create a little space and give the quarterback a target to throw to. \n\"In the meantime, we've got to block good enough to keep the quarterback where he can focus downfield and make his progressions and make accurate throws.\" Read or Share this story: http://on.mgmadv.com/1FF0DqQ Most Popular", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T21:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T05:26:44.444+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
