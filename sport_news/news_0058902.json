They have played major roles at two of the best high school football programs.\nWedd's been patrolling the Lawrence sideline for 25 years, the past 17 as head coach, while McCartney's been at Olathe North 19 seasons. This is his second season as the head man. During that time, the Lawrence Chesty Lions (one of the great nicknames in high school sports) have won five state titles, and the Olathe North Eagles own eight championship trophies.\nAlong with their coaching skills, the two men bring a great deal of pride to this game- pride in their programs, and pride in this rivalry.\n\"This game has always been special,\" McCartney said, and Wedd agrees. \"We play them every year in the regular season, and then there have been a number of years we've faced them again in the playoffs.\"\nClearly, these programs mean a lot to the players and coaches.\n\"There have been years that we won titles with teams that weren't necessarily great talent-wise,\" Wedd said, \"But, when the players put on that Lawrence High uniform, they expected to be great. I think that's also true of the kids at Olathe North, it means something to put on those uniforms.\"\nCoach McCartney feels the same way.\n\"We have a bunch of players who have worked hard to get to the point where they can be starters,\" he said. \"They've waited their turn. They know what it means to be an Olathe North football player, aand they understand this rivalry.\"\nIf it comes down to shear talent, Lawrence will have the edge. The Lions feature one of the nation's most sought after linemen in Amani \"Moose\" Bledsoe. His 6-5, 270-pound size attracts attention, but the offensive tackle/defensive end's quickness, strength and overall athleticism has schools like Oklahoma, Missouri, Kansas State and Kansas beating a path to his door.\nAnd he's not the only Lion standout, as middle linebacker Price Morgan \"Is a star in the making,\" according to one coach. And Trey Georgie, who plays the other offensive tackle/defensive end spot, \"Is just an excellent player. He's starting to draw attention from some big-time schools,\" his coach said.\nOlathe North can counter with one of the most explosive players in Kansas, Isaiah Simmons. The wide receiver/rover back is big (6-3, 205) and can really run. His ability to combine with quarterback Matt Wright in the passing game will likely be a key to this game. He's also a \"stud\" on defense.\nBoth teams have excellent tailbacks. North senior Vinnie Shabazz has averaged 8 yards a carry, on his way to over 1,100 yards and 19 touchdowns, but Lawrence can call on senior J.D. Woods, who might be the most explosive runner in this region. He's averaging almost 10 yards a carry, and has racked up 1,300 yards and 25 TDs.\nSo, this is more than just a rivalry game, it's a contest between two of the best teams in the Kansas City area.\nKick off is Friday night at 7:00. You can see the contest on KSMO-TV.\nCopyright 2015 KCTV (Meredith Corp.)
