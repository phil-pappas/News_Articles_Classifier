(AP Photo/Alexander Zemlianichenko) \nMOSCOW (AP) — Russia qualified for next year’s European championships with a 2-0 win over Montenegro on Monday, while Sweden goes into the playoffs. \nVeteran defender Oleg Kuzmin and striker Alexander Kokorin scored both Russian goals in the space of five first-half minutes to ensure Russia takes the second automatic qualifying place in Group G behind Austria, which had already qualified. \nQualification caps a dramatic turnaround under new coach Leonid Slutsky, who took charge of the team in August with the 2018 World Cup host struggling to qualify. The team has since won all four of its games following Slutsky’s appointment. \nAustria completed its unbeaten qualifying campaign with a straightforward 3-0 win over Liechtenstein, while Sweden beat Moldova 2-0 to finish third in the group and enter next month’s playoffs.
