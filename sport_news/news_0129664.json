He said that he hopes Kelly loses every single game this season and ripped him for not treating his players right.\nThis week, Scott, who is an analyst for CBS Sports, left Kelly alone and instead set his sights on Tom Brady . Scott is obviously very familiar with Brady, having played against him when he was with the Ravens and Jets . But apparently, he doesn’t think Brady is a tough player.\n“There’s nothing tough about Tom Brady,” he said on CBS Sports Radio. “Tom Brady doesn’t think he’s tough. Gisele [Bundchen] doesn’t think he’s tough. Listen, I respect him, but he plays the game differently. No different than the way Peyton Manning plays it, but listen, certain guys— Steve McNair , tough guy. He was a guy that could hang with anybody.”\nScott also thinks Brady sucks at celebrating and said he needs to stop trying to high-five his teammates .\n“When he does that, he looks like a dork,” he said. “How many times does he miss air high-fives? He’s missed celebrations because he’s just awkward.”\nAnd finally, Scott thinks Brady is a “cornball.” Like, a BIG cornball. Just count the number of times he called Brady a cornball in under a minute on CBS Sports Radio.\n“He’s a cornball [1],” he said. “You’ve seen him dance, he’s a cornball [2]. It’s fine, he’s a cornball [3] that was a sixth-round draft pick that became maybe the best quarterback in the history of football, and he has a hot wife. He has a great life, and he has a bunch of hardware. That’s great. But does that not make you a cornball [4]? No, he’s still a cornball [5]. I’m sure his teammates tell him he’s a cornball [6]. It’s fine, there’s nothing wrong with being a cornball [7].”\nSeven times?! C’mon, man. You think this guy is a cornball?\nScott is turning out to be one hell of an analyst. Who do you think he'll go at next?!\n .\n[ via Fox Sports ]", "external_links": ["https://vine.co/v/eeg7xrdrxbr/embed/simple", "http://www.foxsports.com/nfl/story/new-england-patriots-tom-brady-bart-scott-dork-corn-ball-100115", "https://platform.vine.co/static/scripts/embed.js"], "published": "2015-10-02T00:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T12:23:18.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
