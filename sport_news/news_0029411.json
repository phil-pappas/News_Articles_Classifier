(AP) - A group of conspiracy theorists are meeting in Kenner to discuss and celebrate the last man believed to have assassinated an American president: Lee Harvey Oswald.\nMultiple investigations have come and gone since Nov. 22, 1963 and for the most part, they have concluded that Oswald acted alone when he fired three shots from the Texas Book Depository in Dallas, fatally striking President John F. Kennedy and wounding Texas Gov. John Connally.\nThe New Orleans Advocate reports ( http://bit.ly/1X9RDyz ) \"Oswald's Summer of Secrets: New Orleans and the JFK Assassination\" kicked off Friday. The conference will consider Oswald's time living in New Orleans and started with a walking tour led by Oswald's former girlfriend, Judyth Vary Baker. The weekend will end with a 76th birthday party for the alleged assassin on Sunday.\nInformation from: The New Orleans Advocate, http://www.neworleansadvocate.com\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
