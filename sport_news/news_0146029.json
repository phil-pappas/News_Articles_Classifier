It’s more like running through a briar patch,” Charpentier said. \nThere’s no reason for his team to be overconfident against an opponent averaging 10 points a game and was limited to six total points during the first three weeks of the season, said Charpentier. \n“West St. Mary rose up and beat Jeanerette (36-25) last week. They are improving with a new head coach (Clifton Armelin) and there is always going to be that transition period. \n“You look at the tape and they have some good players. You can see over the course of the season how they have improved and are working hard. \n“They have good size, good speed, good athletes,” Charpentier said. \nThe Vikings are also the third St. Landry Parish team West St. Mary has played during the past five weeks. \nWSMH opened the season with a 23-0 loss to Beau Chene followed by a 34-0 defeat the next week in a game against Northwest High. \nOC meanwhile, has lost two games against Notre Dame and Central Catholic-Morgan City, teams that are ranked in the top 10 of their classifications. \nThe Vikings have stuck with their running game offensively for most of the season, but during the past couple of games, OC has injected some new components into the backfield. \nIn addition to starters Aaron Miller and Aaron Whipp, OC has used Evan Moody and Lyn Hebert as frequent rushing options. \nHebert gained 96 yards on 10 carries in last Thursday’s 35-0 win over Sacred Heart. Moody gained 32 on nine attempts. \n“What we’ve been trying to do is keep (Whipp and Miller) fresh and especially keep (Whipp) ready on defense. \nYou always want to develop that depth in the running game,” Charpentier said. \nOne constant in the backfield for OC has been second-year starting quarterback David Labbe. \nLabbe is a frequent runner and last week ran for 78 yards on11 attempts and three touchdowns against Sacred Heart.
