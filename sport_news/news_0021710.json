According to People , Barrett allegedly gouged out the peephole to Andrews’ room and recorded her on his cell phone. The next year, he posted multiple videos of the host in the nude online. The footage went viral.\nAndrews, 37, wants the hotel chain to pay up because she says its employees told Barrett she was staying at the hotel, provided him with her room number and even allowed him to book a room next to hers.\nAndrews accused the hotel chain and Barrett of negligence and invasion of privacy.\nIn 2009, Barrett pleaded guilty to interstate stalking and was sentenced to 30 months in prison.\nLast month, defense lawyers sought a court order requesting Andrews specify the amount of damages the ordeal cost her, The Smoking Gun reports. They suggested her claims were “unreasonably vague and ambiguous.”\nThe trial date is set for February.\nTrending on Facebook\n$2 junk-store find turns out to be $5M Billy the Kid photo Woman's body hanging from fence mistaken for Halloween decoration Study: People who like black coffee more likely to be psychopaths The latest: 7 things to know about Lamar Odom's hospitalization Stranger’s random act of kindness goes viral More popular and trending stories", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/CMGNationalNews", "http://www.people.com/article/erin-andrews-75-million-peeping-tom-lawsuit-michael-barrett?xid=socialflow_facebook_peoplemag", "http://www.thesmokinggun.com/documents/celebrity/erin-andrews-seeks-75-million-751098"], "published": "2015-10-17T11:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T10:46:21.368+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
