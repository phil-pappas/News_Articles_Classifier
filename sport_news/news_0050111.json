KING -- State Journal \nWisconsin linebacker Leon Jacobs (32) leaves the game, ejected for targeting, as Wisconsin head coach Paul Chryst pleads with officials in the first quarter of a game against Troy at Camp Randall Stadium in Madison, Wis., Saturday, Sept. 19, 2015. M.P. KING -- State Journal \nUniversity of Wisconsin defensive coordinator Dave Aranda confirmed Wednesday that inside linebacker Leon Jacobs (toe) will miss the rest of the season. \nThe news was first reported by 247sports. \nAranda said he hopes Jacobs, who re-aggravated a toe injury he suffered early in fall camp, will be granted a medical redshirt despite playing in four games this season. \nJacobs was ejected for targeting in the first quarter against Troy in Week 3 of the season. True freshman Chris Orr recorded 14 tackles in his place and supplanted Jacobs as UW’s starter the next week against Hawaii. \n“Leon’s got a great heart,” Aranda said. “He lives Badger football. He’s trying to get back as soon as he can. It’s hard to see him go through what he’s gone through.” \nJacobs could return to a starting role in 2016 if he moves back to his original position of outside linebacker. \n“Outside linebacker’s probably where he’s most comfortable,” Aranda said. “I thought there were good things he was doing at inside linebacker. That’s probably something we’re going to have to address when we get to that point. \nAranda said the Badgers are now “four strong” at that spot, citing Keelon Brookins and Ryan Connelly as the backups to starters Orr and T.J.
