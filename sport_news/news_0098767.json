By Rick Peterson Jr. richard.peterson@cjonline.com \nFormer Washburn quarterback Joe Schartz finished his career as the Ichabods’ record holder in passing yards with 5,527 and total offense with 6,622 yards. \nBut it wasn’t statistics alone that paved the way for Schartz to be inducted into the Washburn Athletic Hall of Fame. \nSchartz, who played from 1993-96, built a reputation as one Washburn’s toughest competitors at a time when the Ichabods were struggling to find success in Division II. \n“I took a lot of pride (in toughness),” Schartz said. “That toughness was instilled from my parents at home at an early age. If you want something in this life, you need to work for it. That kind of epitomizes my time here at Washburn. \n“It wasn’t easy. It took a lot of perseverance to make it all the way to my senior year.” \nSchartz, now the coach at Manhattan High School, joined former Ichabod golfer Dave Carson and the 2005 national champion women’s basketball team as the new inductees enshrined into the Hall of Fame on Saturday morning. \nThe Ichabods were winless in Schartz’s freshman season but improved to post back-to-back 4-6 seasons in Schartz’s junior and senior seasons. \nSchartz was one of only six players from the freshman class in 1993 to finish their careers at WU, joining Jeff Koch, Grant Webber, Keith Coleman, Zuri Stokes and Josh Parker. \n“Those guys mean a lot to me,” Schartz said. “We went through a lot of hard times together, and that bond is everlasting. It will be with us for a lifetime. ” \nSchartz said he enjoyed the opportunity to return to WU for the ceremony. \n“Football means a lot to me, it’s been a part of my life from the beginning,” Schartz said. “I’m blessed to still be a part of this game. I have a bond with all of my teammates from the past. I still have that bond with my players today. It’s a special bond that people don’t understand unless they’ve experienced it.” \nWashburn women’s basketball coach Ron McHenry and the 2005 team fully understand that bond. \n“I love seeing them,” McHenry said of the players on the title team. “You know, I don’t think there’s a bad bone in any of them toward any of us, and that’s hard. You’re going to have to do some things as a coach that doesn’t always excite everybody. You’re going to have to do some things that make people mad, but not that group. \n“That group, when they weren’t playing, they were cheering. It’s fun to see them because they’re great people.” \nWashburn went 35-2 in the 2004-05 season, defeating Seattle Pacific 70-53 in the national championship game in Hot Springs, Ark. \nSenior forward Carla Sintra was a first team All-American and the MIAA’s most valuable player averaging 13.5 points a game and 6.8 rebounds. \nGuard Jennifer Harris averaged a team-high 14.4 points to lead the team. Harris went on become the national player of the year the next season. \nSintra, sophomore Brooke Ubelaker and senior Lora Westling started all 37 games during the season. \n“I can’t imagine there were too many more talented teams top from bottom than that team was,” McHenry said. “They had togetherness, and they were really tough.” \nCarson, a WU golfer from 1982-85, helped the Ichabods earn CSIC Tournament championships and NAIA district championships in 1983, 1984 and 1985. He also qualified for the NAIA national tournament in all three of those seasons and recorded a top-25 finish at the national tournament after the 1985 season. \n“I played 100 years ago, and I was shocked more than anything (to be inducted),” Carson said. “My brother, Tim, pushed this nomination and put it together, but it’s been awhile. You put your resume in, and you get selected or you don’t, so I really didn’t think much about it. \n“But when they called I was super thrilled. It was a great honor.” \nCarson said he takes pride in making the Hall of Fame as a golfer, saying golfers are often overlooked as athletes. \n“That’s always kind of the joke. People are like, ‘Are you an athlete? No, no, no, I’m a golfer,’” Carson said. “But it’s a hard sport. It’s like tennis, it’s a sport where it’s kind of hard to be recognized. A team can accomplish so much more, and you have so many other people who can make headlines to where the team gets spotlighted. \n“I’m thrilled to be in as a golfer and appreciate Washburn and the Hall of Fame committee looking at a golfer and inducting a golfer.” \nRick Jr. Peterson can be reached at (785) 295-1290 or rick.peterson.jr@cjonline.com .Follow Rick Jr. on Twitter @RickiePeterson .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T02:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T07:53:02.400+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
