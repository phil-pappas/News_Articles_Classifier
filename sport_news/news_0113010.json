JASON LEE jlee@thesunnews.com i Order Reprint of this Story \nPeyton Derrick is closing in on Conway’s all-time single-season passing yards mark. \nThe Tigers quarterback can points to top receiver Bryan Edwards or the handful of other speedsters he’s relied upon to throw to all year. But the overall effectiveness that has him in third place in the school’s record book since Chuck Jordan took over may be his ability to keep the ball in his own team’s hands. \nOf Derrick’s 192 pass attempts this year, only two have resulted in interceptions. That equates to 1.04 percent of his attempts, a ridiculously small figure given the fact that Conway has thrown the ball as much as it has this year. \nWith his performance last week against Socastee, Derrick moved past his 2014 figures. He now stands only behind his older brother Dakota Derrick, who threw for 2,471 yards in 2007 and 2,410 yards in 2006.
