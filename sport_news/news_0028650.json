Later that year, Teaneck lost a classic Jamboree final to Bill Willoughby-led Englewood, then won its first Group 4 sectional title before losing to powerful East Orange in the state semifinals. Holsworth won All-Bergen and All-State recognition at Teaneck. \nHe earned a scholarship to St. Peter’s, although injuries cut short his college career. After being an assistant coach at St. Joseph and part of the Green Knights’ 1981 Bergen title team, he was named head coach early in the 1982 season when Dennis Rossi had to step away for personal reasons. Holsworth took a team that returned no starters from the previous season and led it to a 63-57 Jamboree win over Leonia, becoming the first non-public school to repeat as Jamboree champ. \nHis son, James Holsworth, the former Passaic Valley coach who recently took an assistant coaching job at Caldwell College, played at Bogota and collegiately at St. Anselm (N.H.). \nHolsworth also is survived by his daughter, Denise. Visiting is 2 to 4 and 7 to 9 p.m. Friday at Petrik Funeral Home, 140 Palisade Ave., Bogota.
