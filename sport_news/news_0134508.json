It was a rushing attack that couldn’t hardly be contained. \nThe Rockets rolled to 267 yards rushing in topping SJCC, 55-6, in nonleague play. \n“Overall I thought it was a great team win,” May said. “Our offense moved the ball up and down the field and our defense got some stops. I thought the offensive line played well and the backs ran hard.” \nOak Harbor (4-3) ran 37 times for the 267 yards including 28 rushes for 250 yards in the first half. Dylan Mansor finished with 93 yards while Garrett Duty had 71 yards on seven carries. Kalob Vargas scored three touchdowns while Caleb Oberther had two scores. \n“Our talk right now is we want to be playing Week 11 in the playoffs,” May said. “We have to get better and we have a tough game next week in Perkins. We can’t think about this one too long.” \nThe Rockets scored on each of their seven possessions in the first half in rolling to a 49-0 lead at halftime. Vargas (33 yards) and Oberther (30 yards) each scored two touchdowns on short runs in the first quarter. Vargas added his third to make it 35-0 and Mansor scored from five-yards out before Duty added a 17-yard score in the first half. Oak Harbor ran just one play on its own side of the field — a 55-yard run by Duty. \nOn the other side of the ball, the Streaks (0-7) continued their struggles. They limped to just 21 yards of offense in the first half including 22 rushes for 18 yards. \n“They took it to us,” SJCC coach TJ Buckley said. “They were better than us. We have no excuses.” \nSJCC got a little offense going in the second half. Ross Snyder, who returned to the lineup after missing two games, ran 16 times for 85 yards in the second half. Jordan Hartley and Tyler Laughlin exchanged 1-yard touchdown runs in the running-clock second half. \n“They came right at us,” Buckley said. “We had no answers for them. It’s been a tough year. These kids are doing everything we ask.” \nSJCC quarterback Spencer Harrison completed 6-of-12 passes for 47 yards while Hartley ran seven times for 49 yards. \n“The emotions get the best of you sometimes,” Buckley said. “You snap a little bit when it’s hot under the collar but we just have to keep playing hard. Our kids play hard. There is nothing more we can ask of them.” Read or Share this story: http://ohne.ws/1LmZnci TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T07:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T09:06:27.823+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
