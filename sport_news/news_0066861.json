Obviously, the Patriots win. Four championships speak volumes.\nBut beyond that, and having Tom Brady , there are other reasons that have allowed Belichick to stick around and earn the distinction in some circles as being the best in the business.\nFor one, there’s his unmatched attention to detail. Who else has former players sending out tweets after calls are botched in games weekly?\nThat was the case with the illegally batted ball in the Seattle-Detroit game Monday night. Former Patriots linebacker Rosevelt Colvin responded immediately after the officials failed to flag Seahawks defender K.J. Wright for illegally batting the ball out of the back of the end zone, robbing the Lions of a potential win. Colvin tweeted: “I promise you Bill Belichick knows that rule . . . cause we practiced it in our situational practices.”\nWe reached out to Colvin to get a little more background.\n“In training camp, we’d have a situational practice, and I distinctly remember being in the stadium, where we talked about situations, and batted balls was one of them,” Colvin told the Herald. “Literally, practice was stopped. Everybody was over on the sidelines, and we talked about when to bat the ball, where, how, all types of things. We did it all, what you can, and can’t do. I wasn’t making that up. So as soon as I saw it, I was like, ‘Oh, my god, how could they miss that call?’ ”\nIn the aftermath, Wright said he didn’t know the rule, and that he should have been penalized.\nSeahawks coach Pete Carroll also admitted that he would have been taken aback if they had thrown a flag and returned the ball to the Lions. Carroll said his staff instructs players to knock loose balls out of bounds, but said he wasn’t aware that it’s against the rules to do that in the end zone.\n“I would have done the exact same thing,” Carroll told ESPN radio last week. “I didn’t know that rule either. I’ve never even seen it come up and I’ve been coaching for — I don’t even know how many years it is and how many games it could possibly be — I don’t know how anybody would have known that one. If they did, they did.”\nPerhaps the guy who stared at Carroll from the opposite sideline during the final minute of Super Bowl XLIX, and decided not to call a timeout? The guy who sensed there was something amiss with the Seahawks, and that likely meant they weren’t going to run the ball from the 1-yard line? That guy, Belichick? He knows the rules. And by extension, so do his players.\n“That’s why he’s so successful. But all this stuff is nothing new,” said Colvin, who came to the Patriots in 2003 after four years with the Bears. “The length and longevity of his success, what he gives you . . . there’s a fine line between a winning team and a losing team.\n“Look, every team in the league has talent. There’s only so many people that know how to put talent in the right places, that know how to cover situations like that one in the end zone (with Seattle), or to recognize that play with Malcolm Butler in the end zone (in the Super Bowl) and have them run that play with all those players at practice beforehand with everyone getting a rep at it, everybody failing at it, and Bill talking about it, until they get it right.\n“It amazes me sometimes. But then the other day, there you go. It pops up again.”\nDon’t all coaches go over this stuff? Don’t all coaches have situational practices? Isn’t what the Patriots do, what Belichick does, like that everywhere else?\n“It’s not,” Colvin said. “I’ve been in three locker rooms. I was with the Bears (under Dick Jauron ). I was with the Patriots, and I went to training camp with Houston (under Gary Kubiak ). It is not like that everywhere.\n“When I got to New England, it was like . . . ‘This is how it’s supposed to be done? Really? This is how they do it?’ Then when I left and went to Houston, I felt like I had enough knowledge from what I had done in New England, that I could survive, and help some guys out there. But, no, it does not work that way.”\nColvin is coaching a Pop Warner team now. He recently drew upon what Belichick taught him about allocating timeouts to give his team another chance to win at the end of a game.\n“I just sit back and laugh, because I remember stuff we used to do, and then it shows up in my games,” said Colvin, who was on the 2007 Patriots team that fell just short of a perfect season, losing to the New York Giants in the Super Bowl.\nColvin has yet to order a punt snap through the end zone for an intentional safety just yet, as Belichick did in Denver in 2003 because that was the best option for keeping the Patriots’ deficit to a field goal.\nFacing a fourth down from the 1, while trailing the Broncos by a point, Belichick told then-snapper Lonie Paxton to snap the ball out of the end zone. The unusual strategy worked to perfection, of course. After the Broncos went up by three, the Pats defense held, then Brady hit David Givens with an 18-yard touchdown pass with 30 seconds remaining to win the game.\nColvin got a chuckle out of last year’s playoff ploy with ineligible receivers against the Ravens — causing mass confusion with John Harbaugh ’s team not knowing who to cover — and how it’s since been deemed illegal.\nSaid Colvin: “The Patriots have had so many rules change, just off of things that they’ve done.”\nAs Brady intimated after that divisional win over Baltimore, the Pats know the rules. Belichick makes sure of that.\n“All the years of experience, all the things Bill has seen football-wise through the years, there’s never a situation where I’m out there thinking we won’t know what needs to be done,” Pats safety Devin McCourty said Friday. “I always feel like Bill and the coaches know exactly what we need to do. Sometimes, he thinks outside the box and does stuff not every coach thinks about. He spends a lot of time evaluating the game, and what you can do, and what you can’t do, and how to take advantage of it.”\nThat’s why Belichick still stands proud. And 21 other guys in the AFC East have been shown the road.\nEsiason draws firing line\nIn his weekly analysis Showtime’s “Inside the NFL,” Boomer Esiason dumped all over the Dolphins for making a coaching change four games into the season.\n“It never works. There is no history of it working,” Esiason said. “I understand why the Dolphins did this. I said earlier in the week, for some reason, the AFC East teams all go psychotic on themselves from time-to-time, everybody with the exception of the New England Patriots. They just sit up there in Foxboro, laughing at everybody with all these changes, all these inconsistencies, and all these leaks coming out of these buildings.\n“It is just unbelievable how dysfunctional (AFC East rivals) can become. (Interim coach) Dan Campbell has an opportunity. He’s a disciple of Bill Parcells , if you will . . . a former player. I know he’s a tough guy. I know he will probably want to try to pick a fight or two in that locker room to see if he can light a fire under those players. But conventional wisdom tells you that this does not work, and it won’t work.”\nTesting their boundaries\nBelichick’s frequent pitch to the Rules Committee to have all plays subject to review hasn’t garnered much support, one of his other proposals — using fixed replay cameras along the boundaries of the field — is going to get a test run.\nAt least, that’s what USA Today reported last week. And that dry run is going to happen during Jets and Giants games at MetLife Stadium in coming weeks.\nThat testing, a league spokesman told USA Today, would give the NFL “10-12 games worth of data on viability, impact, and feasibility” for the proposal.\nWhile replays can cause unwanted delays, the whole point is getting the call right. Belichick believes with the technology available, it’s worth a try. Agreed.\nWeeden tunes it all out\nCowboys quarterback Brandon Weeden , who’s back in a fishbowl since taking over for the injured Tony Romo , no longer uses his Twitter account. Apparently, he’s taken the “ignore the noise” mantra to another level.\n“I do a good job of blocking everything out,” Weeden told the Dallas Morning News. “I deleted Twitter a long time ago.”\nOf course, there’s pressure that comes from playing quarterback. Now multiply that by a ton being in Dallas.\n“There’s probably not a more pressure packed position in all of sports, maybe other than playing shortstop, backing up Derek Jeter when he was in New York.”\nWeeden said he used Twitter throughout college but stopped before his rookie year in the NFL.\n“I was pretty interactive in college,” Weeden said. “I remember everybody that always talked crap, they never had a picture of themselves. It was some cartoon or something, and it was always probably a 12 year old kid that damn sure never played quarterback, and damn sure never played quarterback in the NFL. I don’t need that kid telling me, ‘What the hell you thinking throwing to this guy?’ I don’t need that.\n“I’m 32 years old. I don’t need a 12-year-old telling me how to play quarterback.”\nElway-Del Rio rift clear\nSeems things were a bit frosty at the end between Broncos GM John Elway and Raiders coach Jack Del Rio , when the latter was defensive coordinator in Denver under John Fox . Don’t expect any hugs today when Denver hits Oakland.\nDel Rio was more aligned with Fox. So when the Broncos had an early exit from the playoffs last season, Del Rio knew he better find a job.\n“Do I still talk to (Elway)? I’m not sure that we really talked (in Denver) other than business. We didn’t hang out or anything,” Del Rio told reporters in Denver via a conference call. “If we see each other on the field, we’ll say hello, but beyond that we never were really tight friends or anything.”\nYou can almost feel the chill.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T09:33:58.162+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
