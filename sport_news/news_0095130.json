All are from Albuquerque. The Library Bar & Grill is aboard as a title sponsor.\nAt this time last year, the Gladiators didn’t exist. In fact, it wasn’t until just before the Champions league opened play in late February that the franchise was born.\nThe team was then quickly invited into the CIF to fill the void left by the New Mexico Stars, who opted to sit out 2015 to reorganize.\nCaward enjoyed having more time to plan this season.\n“The difference is incredible,” he said. “The amount of time that it takes to run an organization like this at this level is immense. It can be overwhelming. … We didn’t have a chance to do a lot of marketing last year.\n“So this year it was great because we got to do a lot of marketing, and we feel the buzz everywhere we’d go. So having months to prepare, it’s a night-and-day difference.”\nThe home schedule includes one of three new CIF teams, the Mesquite (Texas) Marshals, who join the Bloomington (Ill.) Edge and Chicago-based Illiana Eagles to make it a 12-team venture.\nCoach Dominic Bramante said he can’t wait to get going.\n“We knew going forward we had to get through our first year, get through the obstacles, the bumps in the road, and we’ve done that,” he said.\n“I am more than happy with how recruiting is going, to the point I have to calm myself down and say it’s only October.”\nTRYOUT: The team will hold a tryout at noon Saturday at UNM’s indoor football field, just south of University Stadium. The fee is $60; $50 online.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T06:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T08:54:24.842+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
