It said that while these antics have upset students, faculty and community members for months, the behavior now threatens to complicate the school's accreditation renewal.\n\"The board should act in good faith and in the best interests of the institution,\" the commission said in its report. \"From dysfunction in the boardroom to airing out differences in the media, that has not been the case at the College of DuPage.\"\nThe accreditation team determined the college's most serious failings involved unethical conduct and ineffective leadership during President Robert Breuder's tenure, problems that could lead to the school being put on probation as early as next month. The report points to other issues as well, many of them uncovered by the Tribune, including the school's failure to follow its investment rules, which added to costly losses, and a scandal in how it awarded college credit to recruits at the police academy on campus.\nBut the publicly funded community college also got warnings in other areas, including the conduct of its board. Indeed, the in-fighting has grown so disruptive, according to the report, that the agency's reviewers recommended monitoring the Glen Ellyn-based campus to ensure trustees are behaving professionally as the college works toward renewing its accreditation.\n\"Electronic recordings of Board meetings clearly show Board Trustees talking over each other, rolling eyes, whispering, and demonstrating other negative verbal and non-verbal behavior,\" the report states. \"The team saw little evidence that the Board will be able to fully function in the manner expected and needed to enhance the College without appropriate board development and relationship building.\"\nTribune coverage: Issues at College of DuPage Read ongoing coverage of issues at Illinois' largest community college with more than 28,000 students and $108 million in local property tax dollars, located in west suburban Glen Ellyn.\nRead ongoing coverage of issues at Illinois' largest community college with more than 28,000 students and $108 million in local property tax dollars, located in west suburban Glen Ellyn.\nRead more stories Such rancor could be on display Tuesday night at a special board meeting called to vote on firing Breuder. At least one trustee has criticized Hamilton for calling the meeting when she knew some board members — those likely against firing Breuder — couldn't attend.\nCharles Bernstein, who joined the board in April, said Monday the board's behavior is \"terrible, it is embarrassing and it has to stop.\"\n\"It is damaging to the school that is supposed to be our first responsibility,\" he said.\nThe report describes a board mired in acrimony, where information is withheld from certain trustees and hiring decisions have been made without the knowledge of some trustees. The board is often split 4-3, with Hamilton and the three new trustees she backed on one side, and three holdover trustees on the other.\nThe report cites several reasons for the rancor, including the previous board's treatment of Hamilton when she was the only dissenting voice. But it suggests the bitterness has intensified since she became chairwoman in April and assumed control of the new majority. Since her selection, Hamilton has been \"micromanaging\" the college and has made it clear to administrators that she is \"the boss,\" according to the report.\nInterim President Joseph Collins told reviewers that Hamilton calls him frequently and forced him to hire political strategist Chris Robling — who supported the slate backed by Hamilton in the previous election — as the \"assistant to the president for institutional and transitional affairs.\" The position was not advertised and no other candidates were interviewed, according to the review.\nRobling has said the part-time job is temporary and he is donating his salary. He declined comment.\nHamilton says she takes the findings seriously, and said the board \"will be working aggressively to satisfy the criteria of the HLC.\"\nHamilton concedes that her relationship with some trustees remains strained. The report cites several examples of strife, including complaints that Hamilton refuses to share information with anyone who opposes her agenda. Hamilton, for her part, told reviewers that at least one trustee hangs up on her when she telephones her with updates.\nCollins partially confirmed those grievances, telling reviewers that there \"is an inconsistent manner in which 'minority' Board members are provided information.\" The report also said the fact that some trustees file open-records requests for basic information about the school's operations is \"evidence of serious dysfunction.\"\nThe board's student representative, Gloria Roark, told the accreditation team that trustees at times seem more interested in rehashing past feuds than focusing on the school's future.\nRoark, who has only a symbolic vote, provided the commission with notes she had taken during a recent meeting.\n\"This Board sometimes operates as two separate entities and I am ... disheartened that I have to be there to remind them that we are here for the students first,\" the report Quote: s the notes as saying.\nHamilton contends the board is working toward becoming a more cohesive group. The board recently ate pizza together on campus before a board meeting to boost morale, though two trustees did not attend. There are also plans for a board retreat, she said.\nHamilton also supported a measure to send Trustee Joseph Wozniak, a member of the board minority, to a conference in San Diego. Though most of her board allies opposed it, Hamilton said she pushed it through as an olive branch. Bernstein said he voted for it as a \"peace offering.\"\nWithin minutes of that vote, however, the two factions began bickering about which side caused the meeting to run longer than three hours.\nWozniak, the board's longest serving member, marveled at the seemingly endless arguing.\n\"I've never been on a board where all we do is bash each other,\" he said. \"How is that helping anyone at the college?\"\nBernstein — who hours earlier had made an impassioned speech about the board reconciliation — frowned and hung his head during the squabble. He told the Tribune that he was thinking, \"Oh my God, this has to stop.\"\n\"I will do everything I can now to get it to stop,\" he said Monday. \"As unfathomable as the HLC report is ... I guess I welcome it too because it ought to be a smack in the face to everybody on that board that we have to stop this.\"\nsstclair@tribpub.com\njscohen@tribpub.com\nTwitter @stacystclair\nTwitter @higherednews\n College of DuPage", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-56258939/turbine/ct-college-of-dupage-board-dysfunction-20151019", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-54e64727/turbine/chi-college-of-dupage-coverage-20150127"], "published": "2015-10-20T03:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T04:06:50.653+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
