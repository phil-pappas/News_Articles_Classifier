(AP) â€” The Buffalo Sabres are returning rookie defenseman Brendan Guhle to his Canadian Junior Hockey League team in Prince Albert, Saskatchewan.\nGuhle was re-assigned on Tuesday after recovering from an upper body injury he sustained in a preseason game against Toronto two weeks ago. The 18-year-old was selected by Buffalo in the second round of the NHL draft in June.\nGuhle has five goals and 27 assists in 123 games split over two seasons with Prince Albert of the Western Hockey League.\nThe Sabres (1-2) closed a three-game season-opening homestand with a 4-2 win over Columbus on Monday. They begin a two-game road trip at Florida on Thursday.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
