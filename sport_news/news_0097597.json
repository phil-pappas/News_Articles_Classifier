Further, pheasant production was up in both the primary and secondary pheasant range. \n\"This fall should provide some excellent opportunities for Wisconsin's pheasant hunters,\" McGinley said. \nThe pheasant was introduced as a game bird to Wisconsin in the late 1800s. The population of the nonnative birds increased rapidly in the state. But in the 1940s, the pheasant population began to decline due to limited habitat, modern agricultural practices and urbanization, according to state biologists. \nToday's pheasant population is highest in the southeast one-third of the state and several counties in west-central Wisconsin. \nIn response to the population decline, the Pheasant Stamp was created in 1991 to provide funds for pheasant restoration and management. \nHabitat projects funded by Pheasant Stamp dollars along with partner funds have managed, preserved and restored thousands of acres of nesting and winter habitat. \nA 2015 Pheasant Stamp is required to hunt pheasants statewide. \nWild pheasants are found in higher numbers in areas that feature a mix of cover types. Agricultural areas made up of at least 10% to 15% grassland or idle ground with wetlands and/or shrub lands available to provide winter cover are most likely to hold pheasants, according to the DNR. \nDuring the 2014 season, an estimated 46,855 hunters pursued pheasants and harvested 294,483 birds. The top counties for pheasant harvest were Fond du Lac, Jefferson and Kenosha. \nHunters are reminded that on the first two days of the pheasant season, the daily bag limit is one cock pheasant. For the remainder of the season (Oct. 19-Dec. 31), the daily bag limit is two cock pheasants, with a possession limit of four. \nHen pheasants are protected in most of the state in an effort to help natural reproduction. \nSome public hunting grounds such as Richard Bong State Recreation Area in Kenosha County offer both hen and rooster pheasant hunting. \nSimilar to last year, the DNR plans to release approximately 75,000 game farm pheasants this fall on about 90 Wisconsin public hunting grounds. In southeastern Wisconsin, the highest stocking levels are scheduled for Bong (12,820 birds) and Scuppernong RHA in Kettle Moraine State Forest-Southern Unit (3,820). \nPheasants raised by conservation clubs through the Day-old Chick Program will be released this fall on both designated public hunting grounds and private lands open to public pheasant hunting. Hunters are reminded to notify landowners before hunting on private property open to public hunting. \nHunters can view a summary of stocked properties on the 2015 Pheasant Stocking Information Sheet, available at dnr.wi.gov , keyword \"pheasant.\" \nHunters who dress pheasants in the field are reminded that the head, a fully feathered wing, or an entire leg must remain attached to the carcass while in the field and during transport. \nLearn to hunt pheasants: A DNR-sponsored Learn To Hunt Pheasants class will be held Dec. 11-12 at Wern Valley Sportsmen's Club in Waukesha. \nThe event will include classroom instruction in hunter safety and hunting techniques, firearm instruction, trapshooting and a supervised pheasant hunt. \nLearn To Hunt events are designed for novices 10 and older who are new to a particular kind of hunting. Participants do not have to be enrolled in or have completed a hunter education class. \nFor more information or to enroll in the class, contact the Friends of Poynette Game Farm at friendsofpoynette@gmail.com or (608) 635-8120. \nMoose rescued near Phillips: A bull moose was rescued Sept. 24 after it was found tangled in wire near a train track east of Phillips in Price County. \nStaff with Canadian National Railway noticed the moose and called the DNR's call center help line. The DNR dispatched four personnel to the site: wildlife biologists Pat Berenger of Park Falls and Scott Roepke of Black River Falls and conservation wardens Dan Michels of Park Falls and Joe Paul of Phillips. \nAn employee with the U.S. Department of Agriculture Wildlife Services also responded to the incident. \nThe moose weighed about 650 pounds and had about a 40-inch rack, according to DNR reports. The animal was tangled in copper wire and was dragging part of a utility pole that inhibited its movement. \nThe moose was immobilized with a sedative and a bolt cutter was used to remove the wire from its body. In less than an hour, the moose was once again free to roam the area, according to a DNR report. \nThe agency asks the public to call the DNR hotline at (800) 847-9367 if a wild animal is observed in an \"abnormal situation.\" \nBlaze orange reminder: Due to the Youth Deer Hunt held statewide this weekend, all hunters (with the exception of waterfowl hunters) are required to wear blaze orange through the end of legal hunting hours Sunday. \nThe regulation requires that 50% of outer clothing above the waist and a hat (if worn) be 50% blaze orange. The blaze orange requirement is credited with helping reduce the number of hunting-related firearms injuries in recent decades. Â© 2015 , Journal Sentinel Inc. All rights reserved. About Paul A.
