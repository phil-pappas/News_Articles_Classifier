Starting life as a 1968 example, German Lambo importer Herbert Hahne had this beauty converted into a custom Jota SVR.\nResearch Make (e.g. Mazda) Acura Alfa Romeo AM General Aston Martin Audi Bentley BMW Buick Cadillac Chevrolet Chrysler Daewoo Dodge Eagle Ferrari Fiat Fisker Ford Geo GMC Honda Hummer Hyundai Infiniti Isuzu Jaguar Jeep Kia Lamborghini Land Rover Lexus Lincoln Lotus Maserati Maybach Mazda McLaren Mercedes-Benz Mercury MINI Mitsubishi Nissan Oldsmobile Plymouth Pontiac Porsche Ram Rolls-Royce Saab Saturn Scion smart SRT Subaru Suzuki Tesla Toyota Volkswagen Volvo The authentic Lamborghini Miura Jota started as a project to take the company's supercar racing, and the one-off featured a plethora of upgrades, including lower weight, aero adjustments like fixed headlights, extra power, and much more. The car met an untimely end when its wealthy owner had a crash in Italy. However, a few Miura owners wanted one, as well, and the factory did a handful of conversions to create examples that are incredibly valuable today.\nRead More: The 10 coolest Lamborghinis ever made\nAccording to Bingo Sports' listing, ​Hahne's car is something a bit different. He had a '68 Miura transformed with this shapely body in 1975. The design now sports incredibly wide rear fenders to fit some serious tires at the back. He also had a rear spoiler added to the engine cover that placed the wing right on top of the roof when closed. The interior was also refitted with some comfy leather-covered Recaro seats and a Blaupunkt stereo.\nWithin about a year of the custom work, the Miura made its way to Japan. The supercar has lived there ever since, and a three-year restoration was reportedly just completed. That's not too hard to believe because the photos show every surface of this unique supercar as practically immaculate. There's no price listed on this beauty, but we did inquire with Bingo and will update this post if and when we hear back.\nFollow MSN Autos on Facebook\nRelated Video:\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BBlRhsf.img&quot;}},{&quot;csId&quot;:&quot;AA28YN&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;This", "http://img.s-msn.com/tenant/amp/entityid/BBkkqFx.img&quot;}}", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/b?&quot;,&quot;Category&quot;:&quot;autosenthusiasts&quot;},&quot;Mute&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;HomePageLink&quot;:&quot;//www.msn.com/en-us&quot;,&quot;GeofenceUseSps&quot;:&quot;false&quot;,&quot;GeofenceEnabled&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;AutoPlay&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;AutoPlay&quot;:true,&quot;Mute&quot;:true,&quot;SwfCacheRefreshTime&quot;:86400,&quot;AdConfig&quot;:{&quot;FWFlashProfile&quot;:&quot;188286:MSN_US_AS3_LIVE&quot;,&quot;FWHtml5Profile&quot;:&quot;188286:MSN_HTML5_L", "http://api.5min.com/studio/517478842/videos.xml?num_of_videos=50&amp;page=1&amp;SID=1863&amp;sort=most_recent&amp;return_num_items=true&amp;include_children=true&amp;country=US&amp;return_category_id=true&amp;show_original_url=true&amp;show_renditions=true&amp;show_renditions_status=true&quot;},{&quot;ns&quot;:&quot;ignore_this_version&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;System.Collections.Generic.List`1", "https://www.facebook.com/MSNAutos", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BBlIqcK.img&quot;}},{&quot;csId&quot;:&quot;BBbn6pG&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;Watch", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BBlR9kB.img&quot;}}", "http://pshared.5min.com/scripts/playerseed.js?sid=1863&quot;}", "http://pshared.5min.com/scripts/playerseed.js?sid=1863&quot;,&quot;tags&quot;:", "http://www.autoblog.com/?ncid=txtlnkusaolp00000618"], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T06:08:08.594+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
