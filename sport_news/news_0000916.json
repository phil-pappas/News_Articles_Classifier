She won the 2009 U.S. Women's Open for the second of her two LPGA Tour titles. \nChina's Lin Xi-yu was second. American Morgan Pressel, England's Charley Hull, Germany's Sandra Gal and South Korea's Sun Young Yoo shot 68. Pressel birdied the final two holes. \nSecond-ranked Lydia Ko topped the group at 69. The 18-year-old New Zealander has four LPGA Tour victories this year. She won the 2013 Swinging Skirts World Ladies Masters at Miramar for her first victory as a professional. \nAmericans Brittany Lincicome and Lizette Salas also shot 69. \nTaiwanese star Yani Tseng had a 72. She won the inaugural event in 2011 at Sunrise. \nMichelle Wie and Jessica Korda, the winner two weeks ago in Malaysia, shot 73. \nThird-ranked Stacy Lewis had a 77, her worst score since a 78 in the final round of the 2013 U.S. Women's Open. She was second last year at Miramar behind Inbee Park. \nThe top-ranked Park is skipping her title defense to play in the Korea LPGA's KB Financial Star Championship, where she was tied for first-round lead Thursday. \nThe tournament is third in the five-event Asian Swing. The Blue Bay LPGA is next week in China, followed by the Japan Classic. \nAll content copyright ©2015 Pendleton Times-Post, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T10:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T11:14:04.887+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
