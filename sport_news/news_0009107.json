(Michael Perez / Associated Press) Bill Shaikin Contact Reporter \nAfter Dodgers ace Clayton Kershaw suggested that Major League Baseball might have been \"bullied\" into suspending Chase Utley, Commissioner Rob Manfred pointedly dismissed that notion. \n\"The thought of Joe Torre being bullied by anyone I find to be just a little laughable,” Manfred said at Citi Field on Monday before Game 3 of the National League division series between the Dodgers and New York Mets. \nTorre, the league's chief baseball officer, suspended Utley for two games because of his controversial slide in Game 2 on Saturday. Utley upended Mets shortstop Ruben Tejada, who suffered a broken leg. \nUtley sent his regrets to Tejada via a text message to Mets third baseman David Wright. On Monday, Wright pointedly declined to say whether he thought the message was sincere. \n\"I got the text and I passed it to Ruben,\" Wright said. \nUtley remains eligible to play pending an appeal hearing. Officials from the league and players' union conferred Monday and hope to set a date for the hearing Tuesday.

Each one of these is unique.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T19:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T22:27:05.710+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
