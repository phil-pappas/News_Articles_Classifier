Spartans fall 1-0 to No.4 Shawnee Heights By Corbin McGuire corbin@emporia.com emporiagazette.com | 0 comments \nThe Emporia High boys soccer team dropped its fourth game in a row Thursday, losing a home match to No. 4 Shawnee Heights 1-0. \nThe Spartans held possession more than the T-Birds, but couldn’t convert any close chances. And there were close chances. \n“Sometimes you just need the ball to bounce your way,” EHS head coach Victor Ibarra said. “We got close, really, really close. There’s that saying: you’d rather be lucky than good sometimes. I think that can go for this game.” \nEarly in the first half, Mason Mohn rocketed a shot from the right side off the crossbar. The shot bounced back to Bryan Zapata, who eagerly zipped it just wide of the goal. \n“We hit the post two or three times,” Ibarra said. “There was a couple times where we had the guy we wanted with the ball and for some reason the ball just didn’t go in the back of the net.” \nNeither team scored in the first half, and Zapata booted another shot just wide early in the second half. Mohn followed a few minutes later by nearly winning out a race for the ball against Shawnee Heights’ charging goalkeeper. \nThe T-Birds scored the go-ahead score with about 17 minutes left in regulation. After sending a corner into the box, Emporia was unable to clear the ball successfully. Shawnee Heights’ Taylor Lang gathered the ball eventually and sent a short shot into the back of the net. \n“They’re the (fourth)-ranked team in state and honestly we played better,” Ibarra said. “I’m not going to be politically correct here, give them the benefit of the doubt and tell you they were the better team. We clearly possessed the ball. We had the chances but we just didn’t put them away. But that’s how the game goes. That’s why you play the game.” \nEmporia High’s once 6-3 record now sits at 6-7 with three games left before regional play begins. The Spartans take on St. Mary’s Academy at home Tuesday, Shawnee Mission South Thursday before finishing a postponed contest against Seaman next Friday. \n“Sometimes you just need the ball to bounce your way,” Ibarra said. “The guys’ efforts are there. Unfortunately we can’t piece one full game together where everybody just comes together.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T18:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T23:48:16.461+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
