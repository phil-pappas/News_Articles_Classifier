As part of the low downforce setup, Goodyear will develop tires to complement it.The setup resembles that of races at Kentucky and Darlington earlier this season.Steve O’Donnell, NASCAR executive vice president and chief racing development officer, said in a statement, \"The success of the races at Kentucky and Darlington in similar trim proved extremely valuable in accelerating rules development for 2016. Now, as teams have even more time to prepare and a strong baseline of data, we anticipate the racing to be even better.\"Copyright © 2015, ABC Radio. All rights reserved.
