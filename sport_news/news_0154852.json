Weeks ago, it wouldve been packed with emergency vehicles and firefighting personnel responding to the Butte Fire. Jason Cowan / Union Democrat, Copyright 2015. Three weeks ago, thousands of firefighters and emergency personnel overflowed the temporary incident command at the Calaveras County Fairgrounds in response to the Butte Fire. Today, it is like they were never even there. Nearly a week after the blaze was contained and responders at Frogtown have moved on to other assignments, the empty grounds show little remnants of the little city created there to fight the massive fire. “Cal Fire does a really good job of leaving a property like they found it,” said Laurie Giannini, CEO and fair manager of the Calaveras County Fairgrounds. Due to the fire and the establishment of a base camp on the grounds, a number of events, such as a cross country meet and the Calaveras County Business Symposium/Expo, had to be canceled or rescheduled. But the loss of business and use of resources was irrelevant to Giannini. “We went into this thing not knowing if we were going to be reimbursed for any of it. But it really wasn’t about that,” said Giannini. “My board would’ve done this, even if it was everything. Because it was the right thing to do.” With the destruction of the blaze behind them, Giannini and the fairgrounds have shifted the focus toward restoration. Throughout the past two weeks, fairground staff has been transporting donated animal supplies to Mountain Ranch, Railroad Flat and other areas in need. “We’re taking the supplies donated to the animals out to the burn area. We’re taking them out to the people who need them,” said Giannini. “Now we’re working with our local ranchers or farmers and our people who just have goats or donkeys and we are actually delivering supplies to them or they can pick them up here.” Although most of the 400 animals that took refuge at Frogtown in the midst of the fire have reunited with their owners, about 20 animals — horses and chickens — remain on the grounds. But that number may still grow in the coming weeks. “We’ll see what happens. There are still animals that were burned and are at UC Davis,” said Giannini, who is also housing at least five families — free of charge — at the RV park. “We don’t know what’s going to happen when they get released, if they’re going to come here. There’s lots of things that are still kind of an unknown.” This week, Giannini said the fairgrounds, physically, will return to normalcy. However, it will take time emotionally to recover from the event and its effect on the community. “There was a point, I wasn’t sleeping much anyway because I had a lot to do, but I didn’t want to go to sleep because, whenever I woke up, I found out that someone else that I cared about lost their house,” said Giannini. “Through all this you hear just some amazing stories.” The Calaveras County Fairgrounds will resume regular events this weekend with “Calaveras Has Talent” on Saturday. Meanwhile, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has begun cleanup of hazardous material in the aftermath of the Butte Fire and the Valley Fire in Lake County, according to a release from the EPA. The EPA is working with the state and Federal Emergency Management Agency to assess and clean waste and drums that remain at the more than 1,700 residences and 200 outbuildings affected by the two fires. Three cleanup teams will be deployed to the areas and will — at full staffing — be able to clear up to 100 structures per day. Once the hazardous waste has been removed from the properties, the land can be cleared of debris and the rebuilding process can begin.
