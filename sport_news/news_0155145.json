Over the first few weeks of the season, Baylor has suspended two players and three coaches, along with dismissing another player for a violation of rules. To say the least, Art Briles and company are ready to get back to football.\nBaylor has not looked as good as advertised yet this season, even though it has won its games by a combined 70 points. The Bears have struggled with focus and consistency throughout and will need to address it by the time conference play starts next week.\nFor Rice, this game is an opportunity to make a statement. The Owls played exceptionally well against Texas, even though the final score did not show it. Had Rice not turned over the ball five times, things could have gone much differently. It will try to do the same to Baylor.\nWhen Baylor has the ball?\nPart of the answer to this question depends on which Seth Russell shows up. In his first two starts, the Garland quarterback threw for a combined 814 yards and 11 touchdowns to only one interception. Against Lamar, Russell threw three costly interceptions and fumbled once too. By the end of the game, it was clearly in his head.\nIt becomes unclear which Russell is the one fans should expect to see heading forward. Luckily, Russell has some incredibly gifted players around him to ease the transition.\nThe running game currently ranks No. 5 nationally in yards per game, while junior Shock Linwood and freshman Terence Williams each rank top 10 in yards per carry. Junior wide receiver Corey Coleman also leads the nation in both receiving yards and touchdowns per game with a combined 360 yards and five scores in two games. Rice will have its hands full.\nWhen Rice has the ball?\nFor Rice, the name of the game will be ball control. The Owls rank No. 2 nationally in time-of-possession at almost 39 minutes per game, which will be their greatest opportunity against a talented Baylor team. In their loss to Michigan State, the Baylor defense was worn down after losing the time-of-possession battle by almost 14 minutes.\nFormer Cedar Hill QB Driphus Jackson emerged at Rice in his first year as a starter in 2014 and will be a key matchup for Baylor. The Bears struggled mightily with SMU dual-threat quarterback Matt Davis in Dallas and Jackson has even more of a proven track record.\nRice boasts a young running back trifecta in freshmen Samuel Stewart and Austin Walter, along with junior Darik Dillard. The group has combined for 531 yards over the first three games of the season on 5.7 yards per carry.\nPrediction\nRice will win the time-of-possession battle and potentially win it by a lot. The Owl offense will need to take care of the ball and give itself as many opportunities as possible. Jackson will play conservatively and only take a couple shots downfield in key spots, while the running backs will get the bulk of the action.\nThat said, Baylor will have little trouble moving the ball when it has it. Russell struggled with turnovers last game and should be looking to make a statement against the Owls heading into conference play. Coleman will continue to lead the nation in receiving after this game.\nBriles needs a focused performance from his defense to set the tone heading into conference play, but this game might not be that. The game could be closer than the final score, but Baylor will pull away late and move to 3-0.\nScore: Baylor 59, Rice 28\nOn Twitter:\n @ShehanJeyarajah", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/ShehanJeyarajah"], "published": "2015-09-24T20:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T05:46:46.792+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
