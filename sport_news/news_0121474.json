Barbour County dropped to 0-9 and 0-5. Wicksburg will be the region’s No. 4 seed and will travel to Gordo for their first-round game.

Quarterback Tucker Driskell threw for two touchdowns and added one rushing, while five players scored at least once for the Panthers. \nBarbour County had little trouble scoring, but had much trouble stopping Wicksburg. BCHS quarterback Dywaun Walton had a big night, throwing for four touchdowns and running for another. \nIn the first quarter, Walton connected with Kenneth Hunter, Jr for a 30-yard touchdown pass and Michael Curry caught a deflected ball off the fingertips of Marquell Jones and ran in from 30 yards out. \nIn the third quarter, Walton scored on a 20-yard run, and Jones added the two-point conversion to cut the Wicksburg lead to 43-20. \nWalton would toss two more TD passes in the fourth period – 20 yards to Jaylin Robinson and 40 yards to Jaquvius Richardson.
