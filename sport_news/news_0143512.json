Our current players couldn’t be more thrilled. I wish I had that opportunity when I played (at the University of Florida).” \nJones said the sport creates professional opportunities in the United States. There are none in regular vollebyall. \nOne major difference is the restrictions on coaching. There are only specific times a coach can talk to the players. \nIt’s a two-on-two game with three sets of two players for each team. \n“The big thing is the beach game forces you to be a complete player because you’re playing both at the net and in the back and all over the court and working with one other player,” she said. “You have to develop all skills sets.” \nJones said players on scholarship for regular volleyball can also play beach volleyball. Players who are on scholarship for beach volleyball cannot be play the indoor game. That’s to prevent a school from loading up on scholarships to increase the roster beyond maximum limits for regular volleyball. \nCANDY LAND \nIf a youngster is seeking a sugar high, UCA’s homecoming on Halloween next week is the place to be. \nUCA officials will turn the tailgate area into a trick-or-treat area before the 6 p.m. game against Southeastern Louisiana. \nUCA will also try to set a world record for the largest bowl of candy (13,000 pieces of candy are planned). \nTOP TUNE FROM THE PAST \nTo put the Chicago Cubs’ possibly ill-fated World Series quest into perspective: The last time the Cubs won the World Series (1908) one of the top songs on the charts was “Take Me Out to the Ballgame.” One of the greatest innovations that year was the paper cup and the Ottoman Empire was still alive. \nA TRAGEDY \nIt’s a shocker that North Little Rock’s Altee Tenpenny was killed in an automobile accident in Mississippi. \nTenpenny was probably the top high school recruit in Arkansas in 2013 and originally signed by Alabama. He had problems during his career and was dismissed and/or transferred from three programs, Alabama, UNLV and Nicholls, the latest after a weapons charge. \nHis college career was characterized by poor decisions. It’s tragic that he never had a chance to get his life on track. \nHis story is one that should catch the attention of young athletes everywhere. \n(Sports columnist David McCollum can be reached at 501-505-1235 or david.mccollum@thecabin.net )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T04:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T07:13:59.531+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
