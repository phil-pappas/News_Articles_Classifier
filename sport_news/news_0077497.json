I guess they figured Andrea was a freshman so that's where they put her.\" \nTo reach the quarters, Cerdan topped Morristown's Stef Elling and Kinnelon's Brittany Lau in straight sets in rounds 3 and 4 Saturday. \nZorovich said today's 9 a.m. matchup between Cerdan and Schrage could go either way. \n\"They're both very powerful players,\" Zorovich said. \"I think it's going to come down to which one plays the steadiest game. It should be a great match.\" \nJoining Cerdan in the quarterfinals will be Holy Angels' sixth-seeded freshman Ashley Hess, who lost just six games combined in besting Pennsville's Tori Nugent and Mendham's Lauren Hassell on Saturday. \n\"I thought I played really well today,\" said Hess, who'll face East Brunswick's Jennifer Chen.\"I'm really excited to make it this far. I'm just going to play my hardest and try to take advantage of the opportunity.\" \nTwo other North Jersey singles players dropped out after Round 3 losses. Holy Angels 18th-seeded senior Adrianne Alfonso lost to No. 20 Cynthia Huang of Newark Academy (6-2, 6-4), while Leonia's unseeded senior Kate Lieber was shut out by Schrage (6-0, 6-0). \n\"Honestly, there were some shots [Schrage] made where I wanted to applaud,\" Lieber said. \"She has such a strong game and hit so many winners. \n\"I was happy to make it to the third round, though, and getting a chance to play her was great.\" Â© 2015 North Jersey Media Group Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T08:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T00:18:19.631+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
