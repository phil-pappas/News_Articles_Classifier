The Coyotes merrily skated away with a breezy 4-0 victory as an announced 15,172 wondered what world the Ducks were residing in.\n“We just got to wake up. We’re playing like a team that’s not playing for anything right now,” Ducks captain Ryan Getzlaf said. “It’s accountability throughout our locker room. We’re going to have to start doing that tomorrow. We got embarrassed in our building.”\nThe Ducks are the team that is supposed to be racking up wins and building toward a second Stanley Cup, if you believe the multitude of preseason predictions. They’re sitting at 0-2-1 after three games with one goal in 185 minutes.\n“People can talk about us all they want. It’s up to us in here to go out and prove why we’re getting such praise right now. We’re not even close to doing that,” Ducks defenseman Cam Fowler said. “People can talk. They can pump your tires. As a team, we have to go out there and compete. It’s not there right now.”\nTo make matters worse, the Ducks have held a lead for only 6 minutes, 42 seconds. Arizona’s Anthony Duclair scored three times as many goals as they have in one night. And your night isn’t going well when Fowler has to resort to engaging in his first NHL fight.\nThis was far from the result Ducks coach Bruce Boudreau sought after pushing his players through an up-tempo practice Tuesday to get them up to speed.\n“We want to get it ingrained in us on how hard we have to work to be successful,” Boudreau said.\nDecisions made also backfired. Despite losses to San Jose and Vancouver to open the season, Boudreau opted to give goaltender Anton Khudobin his first start with the Ducks and let starter Frederik Andersen take a night off.\nAndersen didn’t get that free night. Boudreau summoned him 12:53 into the first period after Khudobin was beaten for three goals on eight shots, two coming from Duclair and one from Max Domi. Duclair later celebrated his first career hat trick by beating Andersen in the second.\nThe two talented youngsters have lit an early fire under the supposedly rebuilding Coyotes, the losers in the Connor McDavid-Jack Eichel sweepstakes who easily handled the Ducks after beating the Kings on the road and defeating Pittsburgh at home.\nArizona goalie Mike Smith stopped 37 shots for his 28th career shutout.\n“Well, they are young and hungry,” Boudreau said. “They have an us-against-the-world mentality because everybody’s supposedly picked them to not finish toward the top. They’ve rallied around that point.\n“Quite frankly, I watched their (first) two games and they looked very good. They looked fast. Mike Smith looked like he was Mike Smith again. When that happens, they’re a very difficult team.”\nThe Ducks still have games against Colorado and Minnesota left on their homestand but they have to start getting themselves right and soon. The strong defense they showed in the first two games was nonexistent Wednesday.\n“It’s about building. Showing up to play and working,” Getzlaf said. “I don’t know what the sense is when it comes to showing up to the rink and being ready to go because we got every team’s best, especially at the start of the year here.\n“There’s nobody that wants to beat us more than the person across from you. We got to bring that urgency to the game right away.”\nAdded Fowler: “It’s a pretty humbling game. We’re by no means where we need to be right now. Not just in our execution but our work ethic. That team came in here and won all the battles and foot races. That’s why you see a result like you did tonight.\n“There’s no reason to turn on each other and get down on each other. We have to just come to work and if I know the character in this room like I think I do, we’ll be able to climb our way out of this hole.”\nContact the writer: estephens@ocregister.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T16:18:36.587+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
