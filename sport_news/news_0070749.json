He’s watched the B’s and Habs square off since before he could skate, and he understands the storied history.\n“It’s obviously a very intense one. Just growing up you always see the battles that these two teams have against one another,” he said. “It’s continued throughout the years.”\nLast night marked the 907th meeting between the two clubs (including playoffs). In Hayes’ eyes, the rivalry remains one of the fiercest feuds in sports.\n“It’s up there,” Hayes said. “Each sport has its own, but I think that in hockey, Montreal and Boston has to be up there.”\nAs if hosting the defending Atlantic Division champions wasn’t daunting on its own, the winger said playing the Canadiens comes with an additional challenge: Keeping your emotions in check.\nHayes may be new to the Bruins’ lineup, but it’s clear he knows the recent history. These Canadiens have a knack for getting under the Bruins’ skin — see Subban, P.K. — and knocking them off their game. Hayes knows that can’t continue.\n“You’ve got to stay the same. You’ve got to be even,” Hayes said. “You don’t want to get too high or too low at any point during the game, (but) bring a high pace of energy.”\nBefore last night, the most intense games he’d played in were also rooted in Garden ice. He played three years at Boston College before turning pro, winning a pair of Beanpot titles, a pair of Hockey East championships and a national title.\n“I go back to my college days, so that’d probably be BU and BC,” Hayes said. “I’ve had some great games in this building.”\nWith the local boy jumping into the rivalry for the first time, Hayes was proud to announce that plenty of his friends from Dorchester were in attendance.\n“I like to have the hometown fans in here. They’re always screaming,” Hayes said. “They’re always around during warm-ups, you see some buddies here.”\nAnd while his team may be working to keep its emotions under wraps, Hayes couldn’t deny the feeling in the locker room when Montreal is in town.\n“It gets everyone going,” Hayes said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T14:42:05.400+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
