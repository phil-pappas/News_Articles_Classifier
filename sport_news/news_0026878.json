The top four teams from each district make the postseason. Comment Posted Oct. 15, 2015 at 7:00 AM Micah McVicker Posted Oct. 15, 2015 at 7:00 AM In honor of his brother, Cody, Cole Borin wears No. 33. “Keep on the tradition,” he said. The regular season has less than a month remaining. Borin is aware of that. “You’ve got to give it all you’ve got,” he said. “The end is near. I’m not saying anything relative to the playoffs. Every year, you hear, ‘It’s going to be over before you know it.’ It goes pretty fast. “Every play — don’t have any regrets at the end of the day.” Dorian Fagan, Kam Spencer, Dylan Marr, Jamaal Betterson, Borin and Cameron Selensky comprise the Indians’ senior class. Borin said the Class of 2016 talks about legacy negligibly. His priority is to do his part to make the Indians an overall better team every day. The seniors maximize this time by dedicating everything they have to help the team reach its goals, which include winning a district championship. To achieve that goal, the Indians are focused on Comanche, the fourth-to-last regular season game. “Our focus this week has been on trying to do the things that we do, and get better at them,” Plainview coach Joe Price said. “We’re talking about doing a good job of tackling and getting lined up right on defense. “Offensively, making sure we’re sound in our assignments and doing a good job of throwing and catching.” Plainview (4-2, 1-1 District 3A-4) looks up at Sulphur — which leads the district with a 3-0 mark and 33 points — Lone Grove, Madill and Marlow. The Outlaws also have a 1-1 district record, but have 12 points to the Indians’ zero. Madill hosts Marlow at 7:30 p.m. today. At 0-6, 0-3, the Comanche Indians are in the district cellar. Games aren’t decided on paper. Price acknowledges that his team has to win the remainder of its district games — and get some help if they want to pass Lone Grove, the defending district champions. “That’s definitely something we’re working toward,” Price said regarding a district crown. “I think it was good to get a win (against Dickson) after a loss (to Lone Grove.) I think we’ve got some momentum going right now. I think we’ve got everything headed in the right direction.” Micah McVicker", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T15:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T17:17:30.094+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
