He was held back by a minor knee injury in the season opener against the Steelers, then a combination of the knee and a crowded depth chart in Weeks 2 and 3. Now, a lingering shoulder injury has resurfaced in practice.\n“It can get frustrating, but I’ve got to make sure I’m ready when my time comes,” Flowers said. “I’m coming to work every day, working hard to get better, rehabbing after practice and doing the things to take care of my body so I’m 100 percent when the time comes.”\nFlowers’ shoulder injury is related to the ailment he suffered in the preseason opener against the Packers, which caused him to miss a week in August, but a source deemed it “not a big concern.”\nFlowers hasn’t missed a regular-season practice, but he was downgraded this week from a full to limited participant and is questionable for tomorrow. For the time being, the Arkansas product is powering through the injuries to ensure his technique is up to snuff when the Patriots bust him loose.\n“I’m trying to maintain my game and continue to improve on it,” he said.\nFlowers had some dominant moments during his three preseason games, as he racked up one sack of Aaron Rodgers , three quarterback hits, three pressures and a batted pass. He was the best defensive player on the field in the finale against the Giants.\nIt hasn’t panned out yet in the regular season, but Flowers is trying to make the most of his situation. After waiting this long to make his debut, whenever it comes, he wants to be ready to capitalize, so Flowers has stayed buried in the playbook and focused on his teammates to improve his rush techniques.\nEventually, to use another bad pun, Flowers hopes to blossom.\n“I’m an observer, so I look (at teammates) and I see, and I see what works and apply it to my game, or I apply what I would have done and things like that,” Flowers said. “I just sit back and observe. Obviously, you’ve got a lot of good vets (in New England), so I just sit back, observe and take it all in.”\nBest foot forward\nCornerback Tarell Brown shook off any concern over his foot injury yesterday and made it sound like he’d be available to play tomorrow.\nBrown’s offseason foot surgery and recovery delayed his ability to sign with the Pats until July, and he was limited at times in August. And after he dressed but didn’t play against the Jaguars, the foot popped up on this week’s injury report. He was limited Wednesday and Thursday before being upgraded to a full participant yesterday.\nBrown opened the season as the Pats’ No. 2 cornerback, and quarterbacks are 4-of-8 for 49 yards when targeting him. It sounds like he’ll be ready against the Cowboys.\n“I’m fine. I’ll be all right,” said Brown, who is listed as probable for the game. “You’ve got to play football. It’s part of the job, part of the territory, good and bad days. I’m excited for the game this weekend.”\nNumbers game\nRunning back Dion Lewis ’ two-year, $3 million contract has been filed, and the $600,000 signing bonus is the only guaranteed money. Lewis can earn an $800,000 base salary and $200,000 roster bonus ($12,500 per game on 46-man roster) in 2016 and a $1.2 million base salary and $200,000 roster bonus ($12,500 per game on 46-man roster) in 2017. His cap hits are now $791,240 in 2015, $1.2 million in 2016 and $1.6 million in 2017.\nLewis can earn an additional $800,000 in incentives to increase the max value of the contract to $3.8 million. In 2016 and 2017, Lewis can earn $200,000 for playing 40 percent of the Pats’ offensive snaps, or $300,000 for playing 50 percent of the snaps or $400,000 for playing 60 percent of the snaps. For a point of reference, Lewis has played 67.8 percent of the snaps this season, and Shane Vereen played 52.6 percent in 2014.\nRoster juggle\nThe Patriots re-signed offensive lineman Chris Barker to the practice squad and released offensive lineman Sean Hickey to make room.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T11:49:39.911+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
