Hopefully they won’t have to compete under the same conditions, as high winds buffeted the runners on the Benson Golf Course. Benson will be the site of the West Central Conference meet on Tuesday at 4 p.m. Most of the teams in the conference competed in Monday’s meet, with Lac qui Parle Valley/Dawson-Boyd establishing itself as the favorite to take both the boys and girls championships. The Montevideo boys were second out of 10 complete teams, while the Thunder Hawks girls were third, trailing the Eagles and Morris/Chokio-Alberta. Kurt TeBeest added an­other individual title to his resumé, finishing 14 seconds ahead of LqPVDB’s John Wagner. Josh Tastad added another top-10 finish for the T-Hawks, placing fifth. For the Montevideo girls, Claire Sulflow was seventh, Emma Stueck 15th and Mollie Varpness 17th. The girls individual champion was Maddie Carrington of Morris/Cho­kio-Alberta, who edged Jordyn Sterud of LqPVDB by 2 seconds. “Another strong showing as we continue to see progress,” said Montevideo coach Jamie Harrington. “Lots of people ran their season’s best time in very windy and difficult conditions. We’re proud of the progress we’re seeing and optimistic about conference next week.” Montevideo’s Addie Op­dahl was runner-up in the girls junior high run, with Hayley Voller finishing fifth. In the JV girls race, Emmariah Runyan was seventh and Alexis Bartunek eighth.
