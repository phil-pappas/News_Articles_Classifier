We’re just getting ready for Cal, just trying to prove why we are the best team every week and trying to make a statement every week.”\nUtah wide receiver Kenneth Scott said.\nSALT LAKE CITY — History followed Utah’s 62-20 victory at Oregon. The surprisingly lopsided outcome landed the Utes in the top 10 of the AP Top 25 Poll. It’s the first time they’ve ever done so in September — the previous earliest inclusion was Oct. 3, 2010.\n“It’s definitely a great accomplishment for this program,” said Utah quarterback Travis Wilson. “I think this team has earned it, but we still have a long ways to go and still need to improve some things.”\nThe Utes (4-0, 1-0) enter a bye week ranked 10th. They also received a first-place vote, something that hasn’t happened since 2008.\nUtah coach Kyle Whittingham doesn’t put a lot of stock in early polls. However, he acknowledged that you can start to get some perspective in weeks four and five.\n“It certainly means more now than it did two or three weeks ago. But still we don’t pay a whole lot of attention to it,” Whittingham said. “We’ve got our own goals and our own things that we want to accomplish and we’ve just got to take those on our own timeline and not worry about the external stuff.”\nWide receiver Kenneth Scott, a team captain, has certainly taken that advice to heart.\n“I didn’t even know we were in the top 10,” he said, adding that his focus is on Utah’s next game — Oct. 10 at Rice-Eccles Stadium. “We’re just getting ready for Cal, just trying to prove why we are the best team every week and trying to make a statement every week.”\nAnything beyond that, such as talk about making the College Football Playoff, isn’t even under consideration.\n“Don’t even go there. That’s not in the realm of our thought process,” Whittingham said. “We’re just trying to figure out a way to beat Cal. Period. That’s where it begins. That’s where it ends.”\nHowever, Whittingham acknowledged that the national exposure that followed the win over Oregon is good for recruiting. It’s also been an obvious positive for the team.\n“It’s nice and it’s the highest I’ve ever been ranked being on this team,” said senior punter Tom Hackett. “So I guess it says we’re doing something right. People are starting to take notice.”\nEven so, Hackett explained that he enjoys being the underdog better. It’s just different, he said, than being picked to win the games.\nUtah responded to the challenge last weekend in Eugene.\n“We really tried to make a statement,” Scott said. “We had confidence that we could go in there and do the things we did.”\nScott added that the Utes executed well, did everything right, and capitalized on Oregon’s mistakes.\n“It was good to see us play our best football because we hadn’t done that in the previous three games,” said Whittingham, who noted that the team was completely ready to play with a lot of energy and focus.\n“You could see it during the practice week. It was a not a surprise that they played well,” he continued. “I’m not saying we thought the outcome was going to be what it was, but we felt that we had a great week of preparation in all phases — on the field and off the field — everything that goes into getting ready for a game.”\nNow comes the challenge of taking a break before embarking on a season-ending stretch of eight Pac-12 games without a bye. Whittingham referred to it as a gauntlet.\n“We need to maximize the time during this break by getting healed up and getting our legs completely back and just getting ready for that eight-game grind,” he said.\nEmail: dirk@desnews.com\nTwitter: @DirkFacer", "external_links": ["http://deseretnews.sportsdirectinc.com/football/ncaaf-teams.aspx?page=/data/ncaaf/teams/team93.html", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?env=vp&gdfp_req=1&impl=s&sz=1x1000&output=xml_vast2&iu=/6686/ddm.dn/sports/main&cust_params=section%3Dsports%26subSection%3Dmain%26page-type%3Darticle%26article-id%3D865637818%26content-category%3Dutah-utes%2Csports%2Cutah-utes-football%26dev-location%3Ddesktop-content-video-template%26pos%3Dplayer&vpos=postroll&unviewed_position_start=1&url=http://www.deseretnews.com/&correlator=1443652280", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?env=vp&gdfp_req=1&impl=s&sz=1x1000&output=xml_vast2&iu=/6686/ddm.dn/sports/main&cust_params=section%3Dsports%26subSection%3Dmain%26page-type%3Darticle%26article-id%3D865637818%26content-category%3Dutah-utes%2Csports%2Cutah-utes-football%26dev-location%3Ddesktop-content-video-template%26pos%3Dplayer&vpos=preroll&unviewed_position_start=1&url=http://www.deseretnews.com/&correlator=1443652280"], "published": "2015-10-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T01:43:51.710+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
