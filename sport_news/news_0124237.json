Check back Friday for analysis on Sunday’s games and Monday’s matchup between the Giants and the Philadelphia Eagles.\nFalcons at Saints\n8:25 p.m., Eastern time, CBS\nQuarterback\nMatt Ryan (ATL) — The Saints have been generous to opposing quarterbacks so far this season, allowing an average of 21.6 fantasy points per game, the third most of any team. They also rank 27 th in sacks (7) and 28 th in interceptions (2). While this is another plus matchup for Ryan, he is coming off his lowest quarterback rating since Week 2 of last season (55.1) and it was against the lowly Redskins secondary. We would be more excited about Ryan if his top receiver, Julio Jones, was at full strength.\n Fantasy Football Week 6: Waiver Wire Picks OCT. 13, 2015 N.F.L. Roundup: League Cites Another Monday Night Error OCT. 13, 2015 Analysis: Defense, Not Manning, Behind Denver Broncos’ 5-0 Start OCT. 12, 2015 Giants Connect With Teammate Being Treated for MRSA OCT. 12, 2015 Drew Brees (NO) — Brees, who is on a pace to be sacked a career-high 53 times this season , might get a break this week, as the Falcons rank 30 th in sacks (6) and 25 th against the pass with 292 yards allowed per game. Brees is averaging 24.5 F.P.P.G. in his last two starts and should fare well at home Thursday night.\nRunning Back\nDevonta Freeman (ATL) — The Saints yielded 253 yards total yards and two touchdowns to a once struggling Eagles ground game in Week 5. Over all, they are considered the ninth best matchup for fantasy backs. The Falcons have been relying on Freeman to carry the offense amid their passing game struggles, and that could be the case once again with a banged-up receiving corps. Freeman is a top three running back option this week.\nMark Ingram/C.J. Spiller (NO) — Atlanta ranks first against the run (78.4 Y.P.G.), but has allowed a league-high nine rushing touchdowns. Ingram is locked in as an RB1 play, while Spiller remains an afterthought in the Saints offense and is looking like waiver wire fodder at this point.\nWide Receiver\nJulio Jones/Leonard Hankerson (ATL) — Hankerson is dealing with some bad ribs but is expected to start. Jones is expected to play but might be on a “pitch count” as he nurses a hamstring injury. If you own Jones, you have to start him, but keep expectations in check. An opposing wideout has managed to reach double-digit fantasy points against New Orleans in four of five contests this season.\nBrandin Cooks/Willie Snead (NO) — Snead solidified the WR2 role in New Orleans with his 141 yards and one touchdown on a team-high 11 targets against the Eagles last week. Cooks finally showed up with 107 yards and one touchdown. Both are solid WR2 starts against Atlanta’s 25 th ranked N.F.L. secondary.", "external_links": ["http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/13/sports/Y-GIANTS/Y-GIANTS-thumbStandard.jpg", "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/14/sports/14nfl-1/14nfl-1-thumbStandard.jpg", "http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000554030/article/injury-roundup-leonard-hankerson-suffers-rib-injury", "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/13/sports/13broncos-web-sub/13broncos-web-sub-thumbStandard.jpg", "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/14/sports/14WAIVERSweb1/14WAIVERSweb1-thumbStandard.jpg", "http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000556679/article/julio-jones-to-play-but-falcons-will-monitor-pitch-count", "http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/13875945/pittsburgh-steelers-san-francisco-49ers-washington-redskins-need-key-players-return-quickly-tuesday-nfl-preview"], "published": "2015-10-14T21:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T23:39:12.407+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
