The area is near the community of North Bloomfield, just north of Warren and Youngstown near the Pennsylvania state line.\nRainn was being taken to a hospital for evaluation. Officials had no other immediate information on how she disappeared or how she was discovered.\nSearchers on horseback had combed through fields while a helicopter hovered above Sunday in the hunt for Rainn. Authorities concentrated the search around the home in rural northeastern Ohio, going through wooded areas, backyards and drainage pipes.\nTrumbull County Sheriff Tom Altiere said early Sunday, before Rainn was found, that there were no signs of foul play. Deputies had searched the family's home several times and had given polygraph tests to the little girl's relatives, he said.\nSearch dogs on Saturday briefly picked up the 2-year-old girl's scent just down the street from where she was last seen, the sheriff said.\nRainn and her two brothers, ages 3 and 4, were staying with their great-grandparents on Friday when they reported her missing.\nRainn's mother said her children had been staying with the couple because she was moving into an apartment.\nHer grandmother was in the kitchen and the three children were with the grandfather in another area of the house when the toddler walked away and soon after was missing, Brandi Peterson said.\n\"She's 2 years old and goes to strangers. She goes to anybody. She is just an innocent little girl, and she is lost, and I don't know if she is cold or hungry,\" Peterson told WFMJ-TV in Youngstown before her daughter was found.\nThe sheriff said the family had cooperated with investigators and there were no signs of violence at the home.", "external_links": ["http://www.cleveland.com/metro/index.ssf/2015/10/missing_2-year-old_girl_found.html"], "published": "2015-10-05T02:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T03:44:45.888+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
