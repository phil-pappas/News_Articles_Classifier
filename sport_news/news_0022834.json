(Bettina Hansen / The Seattle Times) Seattle Seahawk Michael Bennett responded to a jab from his brother and said he saw nothing wrong with his actions that led to a penalty in Sunday's game against the Bengals. \nSeattle Seahawk Michael Bennett had sharp retorts Wednesday for his brother, Martellus, and critics of the personal foul penalty he received Sunday in Cincinnati. \n— First, his brother. Martellus Bennett, a tight end for the Chicago Bears, was asked today about what Michael Bennett said last week after the Seahawks beat Detroit, that he doesn’t like Lions’ QB Matthew Stafford because, well, he’s from Dallas and that’s where JFK was killed (the Bears play the Lions this week). Martellus Bennett responded that he had no issue with Stafford (noting that Stafford “probably” wasn’t even born yet) and that his brother is, well, an “a..hole.” \nSaid Michael today when asked about what Martellus said: “Yeah, a rich a..hole.” \nSo, there you go.

Just because he’s the quarterback it’s a big deal. Carriers get hit all the time and knocked to the ground, but the only time people care — one, he’s the quarterback and he gets paid a lot of money and people just put this zoom-in screen on it so it becomes a big deal.But I can show you tons of plays where offensive linemen are jumping on guys all the time and it’s not a big deal.” Asked a follow-up question about the play, Bennett said: “I hit him, he got back up. I pushed him back down, he got back up. I pushed him down again. What was I supposed to do let him get back up?’’ At that point, teammate Brandon Mebane came over and said with a smile “you should have let him back up, Mike.” Bob Condotta : 206-515-5699 or bcondotta@seattletimes.com ; on Twitter: @bobcondotta .
