But it was a pair of stylish, if rather impractical, backless leather loafers lined in plush brown fur that made the biggest impact when the merchandise first hit stores in late summer. The slipper-like shoes sold like proverbial hot-cakes in the U.S.; there is currently a wait list.\nThis sort of cultish frenzy for a single piece of fashion is what defines an “It” item. If you’re susceptible to It-ness, once something like these shoes gets under your skin, it matters less and less that you’ve seen them coming and going on Instagram or that you could be spending near $1,000 on outré slippers you may only wear for a few months. Ultimately, you must confront the question: Do you or don’t you?\nThe answer isn’t entirely black and white. If you’re not content to be a trend ascetic who shuns all things of-the-moment (where’s the fun in that?), there are a few approaches you can take.\nThe Lifespan of a Trend Some of fall’s most coveted pieces and their predicted expiration dates. fullscreen Browse through our collection of this season’s trending pieces.

Martin Ramin/The Wall Street Journal, Styling by Anne Cardenas … of SHOW CAPTION HIDE CAPTION fullscreen The most prudent one may be that of London-based magazine editor Caroline Issa: anti-impulse buying. Ms. Issa, who can only be described as sensible but also relishes fashion, counsels weighing each decision carefully and making sure the purchase aligns with your taste. “I would make a parallel to buying art,” she explained. “You have to buy things that you love and that fit your personality.” Buying into trends in the heat of the moment, she pointed out, often leads to expensive regret. If you’re lucky, a well-considered trendy piece will have the longevity of a classic. Ms. Issa has held on to once-hot pieces like a checked tulip-shaped skirt and doctor bag from Stefano Pilati’s mid-aughts tenure at Yves Saint Laurent. “I will pull that skirt out again and wear it with a classic white blouse,” she said.\nMaking smart decisions is easier said than done, however. Great fashion can strike deep in the heart, and when it does, the head is vetoed. “Any time a designer hits the right balance and makes a piece that’s coveted by women globally, there’s a real emotional response,” said Roopal Patel, fashion director at Saks Fifth Avenue.\nMs. Patel’s best advice is to try to resolve the head-heart conflict as early as possible and pull the trigger quickly if it’s meant to be. “You get the most pleasure, and mileage, out of having it then because it hasn’t gone mainstream,” she said. No doubt, those who got in early on the now-ubiquitous Mansur Gavriel bucket bags or Vita Kin folk dresses felt a certain sense of quiet satisfaction. And when your little-known find suddenly floods Instagram? “Well, you move on from it for a bit,” said Ms. Patel. “Then bring it back at an unexpected moment—when you won’t walk into a room and see three other people wearing it.”\nThe buy-and-hold strategy is one many chic women employ. Shoe designer and stylist Tabitha Simmons never gets rid of once-trendy pieces. “I’m a bit of a hoarder,” she admitted. “But things come back around.” She’s considering reviving a blouse and dress in Prada’s ethereal fairy-print collection from spring 2008. The corollary to this advice, some argue, is that you don’t ever need to stop wearing something just because its heat has dissipated. “Those rules no longer exist,” said Saks Fifth Avenue’s Ms. Patel. “I think women decide when they want a trend to expire.”\nWhen you are wearing an item at the height of its popularity, how you wear it is also important. It helps to play it casual, to avoid letting a trendy piece speak too loudly. “Wearing a trend cannot feel like a costume,” said Laure Heriard Dubreuil, co-founder and CEO of Miami boutique the Webster. “You have to wear it like it’s always been part of your wardrobe.” To achieve that, she mixes current and past-season goods. For instance, earlier this fall, she was sporting her Louis Vuitton jeans—a trendy spring item that’s still smoldering—with a decade-old striped top from A.P.C. and a ’70s vintage jacket. “The important thing,” she noted, “is to make a look your own.”\nAnother way to deploy on-trend items in their prime is to use a single hot accessory to spike a timeless ensemble. Stylist Micaela Erlanger, who dresses actresses like Lupita Nyong’o and Meryl Streep, chooses pieces that work with one of her rotating uniforms, say, a button-up shirt, leather leggings and flats. “With that, I can easily carry something like a fringe bag,” she said. Ms. Issa, too, looks to accessories—such as Prada’s candy-hued plastic brooches for fall—as an easy (and somewhat more affordable) way to sample trends. “I can use them on a pea coat now or jean jacket later,” she explained. This season, she also invested in Christian Dior’s bright stretch patent leather boots with plexiglass heels to function as “the one crazy element in an otherwise classic outfit.”\nThen there are the advanced sailors of the trend seas like Moscow-based designer Natasha Goldenberg. She recently purchased a tweed dress from Miu Miu’s much-coveted fall collection, but rather than wear it as intended, she had it cut into a skirt and bralette top. “I was sure I would see many others in the same dress. I thought, ‘I want to wear it in my own way,’ ” she explained. An easier way of standing out is to track down a hot piece in a rare color, a strategy Ms. Goldenberg also advocates. An e-commerce site like Farfetch, which allows you to search small boutiques worldwide can be helpful here. Ms. Goldenberg also likes to hunt online for formerly trendy pieces she may have missed out on. She recently bought a pantsuit from Prada’s fairy collection, proving that the best “It” pieces never really die.\nMore in Style & Fashion Autumn Salves: Sunscreens for Fall and Winter The Three Fashion Designers to Know This Fall Indie Denim Brands Serve Up Something Special Fall Fashion’s Victoriana Principle Fall Fashion’s New Eccentricity Phone Cases: The New It Fashion Accessory?", "external_links": ["http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KT505_TRENDW_16H_20151014133952.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KT502_TRENDW_8H_20151014133937.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KT502_TRENDW_16H_20151014133937.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KT506_TRENDW_8H_20151014134002.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KT503_TRENDW_750V_20151014133942.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KT494_trendc_M_20151014132719.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KT505_TRENDW_8H_20151014133952.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KT506_TRENDW_12H_20151014134002.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KT494_trendc_P_20151014132719.jpg", "http://www.pinterest.com/wsj/wsj-fashion/", "http://www.prada.com/en.html?cc=US&quot;", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KT505_TRENDW_12H_20151014133952.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KT506_TRENDW_16H_20151014134002.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KT504_TRENDW_1000V_20151014133947.jpg", "http://www.prada.com/en.html?cc=US", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KT503_TRENDW_1000V_20151014133942.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KT502_TRENDW_12H_20151014133937.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-15T21:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T20:52:08.052+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
