Then they began playing football and that optimism vanished as the Tigers blew a large lead to Louisville, narrowly escaped Jacksonville State at home, and then lost its first two SEC games. Auburn is very lucky to be 2-2 right now. \nDanny Sheridan, a sports handicapper and analyst for USA Today, made a guest appearance on Paul Finebaum today and said he sees Auburn losing three more games, at least. And if things don’t improve, he believes Kentucky will be favored in the Thursday night game in Lexington in two weeks. \n“Right now, they would be an underdog versus Kentucky,” Sheridan told Finebaum. \nIf you had told me before the season that there was any chance UK would be favored over Auburn, I would’ve had a very hard time believing you. That was one of two games (along with Georgia) we had in the ‘definite loss’ column. \nBut I didn’t have Kentucky at 3-1 and Auburn at an ugly 2-2 through four games, either. \nSo who’s up for traveling to Mississippi State with a 5-1 record?

Talk about sucking! RealCatsFan October 1, 2015 at 5:25 pm | Permalink | Reply \nMust be the Muschump effect. Their defense is last in the SEC since he took over. At this point, I’m not sure if Florida’s downfall can be blamed on Joker or on Muschamp. Maybe some unholy combination of both – wish they were still with the gaytors.
