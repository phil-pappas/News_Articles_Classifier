This is Trent’s 22nd 300 game and it came with a series of 775. Jarvis began with the 300 and followed with a 223 and 252. Trent has been one of the best local bowlers for years and seems to be heading toward another great season. \nThe fourth perfect game of the season arrived two days later as Dan Layton shot perfection Wednesday in the Industrial/Teachers League. This was Layton’s second 300. He also moved into the top series of the season with a 790. Layton started the night with 296 and then 234 finishing with his 300. \nRyan Buckner also was in the running with a 761 series this week. It won’t be long until that 800 barrier falls. \nWe also had a near 800 series when Charlie Colip shot 792 on games of 246-277-269 in the Pick Your Partner league. A seven pin in the 10th frame kept Colip from the elusive level, but the 15 year old holds the house record for now. Charlie shot a 299 game last week and is averaging over 250 after two weeks. Evidently he has never heard of average management. \nLogan Marshall is another youth bowler who had a great set. Logan shot 743 with a game of 267 in the Saturday Major’s league. Cort Calhoun, yet another youth bowler, shot 721 Monday night. It seems as though the youth bowlers have thrown down a challenge to the adults. \nWhat do you say veteran bowlers? Can you answer this with some scoring of your own? I think they will answer and in a big way. \nOne adult bowler who has answered the challenge is Tifinie Voiles. Tifinie shot a 673 with games of 202, 214 and 257. This was Tifinie’s highest series ever. Great shooting Tifinie. \nAnother youth making a name for herself is 12 year old Shayla Gwynn. Gwynn was invited to try out for the U12 USA National Youth Great Lakes Team last Saturday night at Arrowhead Bowl in Lafayette. Her team won the Regional Championship to move on to the National Finals held in Indianapolis in August. We are looking forward to seeing that title brought home too. \nThese talented young bowlers are representing themselves and our area well. They keep us looking forward to the future. \nThe past few weeks have busy in our world. The new season for the TKO Tournament was held here at Championship and this month’s will be held at Pro Bowl West in Ft. Wayne on Oct. 18.
