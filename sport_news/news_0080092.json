By DOUG FERGUSONAP Golf Writer \nINCHEON, South Korea (AP) - Capsules of the matches Thursday at the Presidents Cup: \nBubba Watson and J.B. Holmes, United States, def. Adam Scott and Hideki Matsuyama, International, 3 and 2. \nThe Americans' big-hitting duo ran off four straight birdies to build a 3-up lead and never trailed the rest of the match. But it was tight on the back nine, and pivotal for the International side considering how the other matches were going. The International team had two straight chances to square the match, but Scott missed a 4-foot par putt on the 13th hole, and Matsuyama missed an 8-foot birdie putt on the 14th. Matsuyama left a downhill birdie putt short on the par-5 15th, and Holmes made birdie from 8 feet for a 2-up lead. The Americans closed it out on the 16th when Holmes made a 15-foot birdie putt. \nLouis Oosthuizen and Branden Grace, International, def. Matt Kuchar and Patrick Reed, United States, 3 and 2. \nThe Americans took a quick lead with a birdie on No. 2, only for the South Africans to birdie the next hole. The match was all square until Oosthuizen made a 20-foot birdie putt on No. 9, and the International side began to pull away with American mistakes. Kuchar drove into the water on No. 11, Grace hit a splendid bunker shot that led to par to win the 12th, and the International held on for the win. It was the first win for Grace in the Presidents Cup after going 0-4 two years ago. \nRickie Fowler and Jimmy Walker, United States, def. Anirban Lahiri and Thongchai Jaidee, International, 5 and 4. \nFowler and Walker halved all three of their matches together at the Ryder Cup. They had no trouble getting their first win at the Presidents Cup. They birdied three straight holes starting on No. 2 for a 3-up lead, lost the next hole with a bogey, but the International team got no closer the rest of the way. Fowler made a 15-foot birdie on the 13th hole for a 4-up lead, and the match ended on the 14th hole when Walker hit wedge to 5 feet and the Internationals failed to make par and conceded the match. \nPhil Mickelson and Zach Johnson, United States, def. Jason Day and Steven Bowditch, International, 2 up. \nA tight match turned in the Americans' favor when Mickelson holed a bunker shot for birdie on the 13th hole for a 2-up lead and kept the margin until the match was dormie. But the International side - Day, in particular - did not go easily. Day holed a 40-foot birdie putt on the 17th hole that sent the match to the 18th and kept alive hopes of at least a half-point. Bowditch hit a long iron to about 18 feet, but Mickelson hammered a tee shot and Johnson hit a 7-iron to about 10 feet. Day missed the eagle putt and conceded the Americans an eagle. \nJordan Spieth and Dustin Johnson, United States, def. Danny Lee and Marc Leishman, International, 4 and 3. \nThe tone was set early when Spieth holed a 20-foot birdie putt on the second hole, and then Johnson hit a 349-yard drive on the next hole. That hole was halved, but it was a statement sent early that a U.S. team of power and putting would be tough to beat. The Internationals won the ninth when Johnson drove wild to the right, leaving the Americans a 1-up lead going to the back nine. The International team chopped it up around the 10th green for bogey, and put two balls in the water on the 11th to lose the hole and fall 3 down. The Americans closed it out on the 15th hole.
