Jeff Manning/The Oregonian/OregonLive It's shaping up as a bloody autumn in Portland.\nPortland police are investigating the death Monday night of a man who suffered traumatic injuries and was found bleeding outside a building north of Columbia Boulevard. It is the fourth homicide in the city since Friday, the sixth in just over a week.\n\"That's a lot of violent crime we're responding to,\" said Pete Simpson, Portland Police spokesman.\nSeventeen police units responded to the scene at 7:22 p.m. at the 5500 block of North Columbia Court on reports of an injured person.\nThey found a man who had suffered severe injuries, though Portland police spokesman Sgt. Pete Simpson said the man hadn't been shot.\nEmergency responders administered medical aid but were unable to save the man, who died at the scene. Simpson said the medical examiner will conduct an autopsy Tuesday to determine the cause of death.\nSimpson said police had not yet identified a suspect.\nPolice did not immediately release the name of the victim or his age, saying only that it was an adult man.\nThe crime scene is affecting neighborhood traffic in the area, police said. Motorists should use routes away from the area.\n-- Jeff Manning\n503-294-7606, jmanning@oregonian.com", "external_links": ["https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m18!1m12!1m3!1d2791.753199836067!2d-122.72572648569876!3d45.595505879102696!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x5495a7dfc0a30f91%3A0xa52265a0e9bddb25!2s5500+N+Columbia+Ct%2C+Portland%2C+OR+97203!5e0!3m2!1sen!2sus!4v1444106711218"], "published": "2015-10-06T04:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T10:24:09.939+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
