(Curtis Compton/Atlanta Journal-Constitution via AP) MARIETTA DAILY OUT; ... more > By GEORGE HENRY - Associated   \nATLANTA (AP) - Everyone in the Atlanta Falcons’ locker room seemed eager to praise a teammate. \nA 48-21 blowout victory gave the Falcons four straight wins, and they’ll try to improve to 5-0 when they host Washington next week. \n“It was a total team effort out there today,” Pro Bowl receiver Julio Jones said. “Each guy was doing for another guy. What’s great is we can only get better.” \nFor the Houston Texans, second-year coach Bill O’Brien was accepting all the blame. \nA 42-0 deficit in the third quarter marked the biggest deficit in the team’s 14-year history. \nThe Texans must move their focus quickly with Indianapolis visiting in four days. At 1-3, O’Brien has a lot of mistakes to correct. \nHe called his performance and the team’s “terrible.” \n“It starts with me,” O’Brien said. “To go out there and perform like that - that’s on the head coach, so I’m going to try and do a better job.” \nSome things to know from the Falcons’ dominant win: \nNOT NEARLY ENOUGH: Devonta Freeman and Leonard Hankerson made them pay with a combined 11 catches for 184 yards receiving, but Texans at least did what neither Philadelphia, Dallas or the New York Giants could. \nThey held Jones, who began the day leading the NFL with 440 yards from scrimmage, to 38 yards on four catches. \nHouston’s strategy backfired. \n“They were trying to bracket me early on and they were leaving gaping holes up front,” Jones said. “The offensive line did a great job today. Hats off to those guys. J.J. Watt’s over there, Jadeveon Clowney, Vince Wilfork - they’ve got a great (defensive) line.” \nFAMILIAR CAROUSEL: After the game, O’Brien wasn’t ready to say whether Ryan Mallett or Brian Hoyer will start against Indianapolis. \nMallett was benched after completing just 12 of 27 passes for 150 yards and an opening-possession interception that led to Atlanta’s first touchdown.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T11:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T12:20:55.521+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
