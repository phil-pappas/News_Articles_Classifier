Pekin visits Morton at 7:30 p.m. tonight in a Mid-Illini Conference football game at renovated Carper Field between teams that have diametrically different goals. The Dragons (3-2, 2-1) are in search of a conference championship and post-season playoff berth. The Potters (0-5, 0-3), who have already been eliminated from playoff contention, just want to get into the win column. Pekin is on a roll, outscoring its opponents 89-3 over the last 10 quarters. The Dragons haven’t allowed a touchdown since the second quarter of a 10-7 loss to conference foe Dunlap in Week 3. Morton has been outscored 183-89 in its five defeats. The Potters showed some life last week in a 40-35 loss to Dunlap, which caught Pekin’s attention. Dragons coach Doug Nutter said he’s taking nothing for granted tonight. “It’s their homecoming and they want to win their first game on their new (artificial turf) field,” he said. “We need to be ready from the get-go and play four quarters of Pekin football. “We have to be disciplined defensively against their option and sustain drives offensively while not turning over the ball.” The Dragons have had only three turnovers this season, all against Dunlap. Nutter said he isn’t worried that his players are looking ahead to games against conference powerhouses Washington (5-0, 3-0) and Metamora (4-1, 2-1) in the next two weeks. “All we’re thinking about is Morton,” he said. “That’s our next opponent. Our goals are in front of us. We can’t afford a letdown.” The loss to Dunlap (4-1, 3-0) seemed to light a fire in the Dragons. They beat Mid-Illini rivals Canton 34-3 and East Peoria 48-0 in back-to-back home games the last two weeks after the road defeat. Pekin led Canton 14-3 going into the fourth quarter and scored 20 unanswered points against the Little Giants (2-3, 0-3) to make the game a runaway. Add the 48 points the Dragons scored against East Peoria (1-4, 0-3) and that makes it a 68-0 run in the last five quarters. Quarterback Nick Campbell threw five touchdown passes in the five quarters. Three went to Elijah Henson and one each to Cameron Whitford and Colton Reader. Leading Pekin rusher Sebastian Fuller has run for more than 100 yards twice this season. He had 171 yards vs. Bloomington and 145 vs. East Peoria.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T10:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T16:42:23.456+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
