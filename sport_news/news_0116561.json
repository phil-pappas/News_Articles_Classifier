The plan is for someone else to coach the team the rest of the season. \nSpurrier's retirement was first reported by SI.com. \nAn interim coach will be named Tuesday, sources said. \nSpurrier, the Gamecocks' all-time winningest coach, also informed South Carolina athletic director Ray Tanner of his decision to step down, sources said. This came after the Gamecocks lost their fourth straight SEC game Saturday to LSU. The loss guaranteed Spurrier no better than a .500 season. He has never had a losing season in 25 seasons coaching in college. \nSpurrier, 70, was close to stepping down at the end of the past season, after the Gamecocks dipped to 7-6 on the heels of three straight 11-win seasons and three straight top-10 finishes, but he elected to return. The Gamecocks have lost eight of their past nine SEC games dating to the past season. \nThe Gamecocks are 2-4 overall this season and 0-4 in the SEC. They sit seventh in the SEC East.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T06:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T18:09:42.156+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
