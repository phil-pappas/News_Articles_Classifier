Coco Chen (Notre Dame) 6-3, 6-4 â€” Rapid Recap \nWilson junior Tyra Ott defeated Notre Dame senior Coco Chen 6-3, 6-4 in the District 11 Class AA final for the second straight year on Monday afternoon at Lehigh University. It was the third straight title for Ott. \nTurning point : After Chen came back from 4-1 down to even things in the second set, Ott won the next two games to clinch the hard-fought match. \nWhat it means : It's another district title for Ott, who will look to successfully defend her state title on November 6 in Hershey. Chen held leads in a much more competitive match than last season's 6-2, 6-0 victory for Ott in the final.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T00:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T02:35:28.377+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
