The Cabinet cleared ordinances to amend the Arbitration and Conciliation Act and bring into force the Commercial Courts, Commercial Division and Commercial Appellate Division of High Courts Bill, 2015 pending before a Parliamentary committee. The Cabinet had in December last year given a nod to an ordinance to amend the Arbitration Act but it was never sent to the President for approval. For speedy settlement of commercial disputes, the Cabinet had in August cleared a bill to amend the Arbitration Act to fix a timeline for arbitrators to resolve cases. The Bill was not introduced in Parliament. Under the proposed amendments to the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, an arbitrator will have to settle a case within 18 months. However, after the completion of 12 months, certain restrictions will be put in place to ensure that the arbitration case does not linger on. Finance Minister Arun Jaitley had said recently that the government has made considerable progress in addressing the issue of ease of doing business.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T04:09:56.409+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
