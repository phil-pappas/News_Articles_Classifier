The 4 oz. fabric cleaner and 8 oz. waterproofing bundle cleans technical fabrics, while restoring water repellency and factory level DWR performance.\nBellingham, WA (PRWEB) October 14, 2015\nGear Aid® is pleased to offer a new waterproofing spray combination pack from the ReviveX® line of technical fabric cleaners and waterproofing agents. The ReviveX Durable Waterproofing Spray Combo Pack includes a 4 oz. bottle of ReviveX Pro Cleaner bundled with an 8 oz. bottle of ReviveX Durable Waterproofing Spray. The new bundle is designed to clean technical fabrics while adding or restoring factory-level water repellency.\n“Cleaning a fabric is the most important step in restoring water repellency or factory-level DWR performance,” said Gerald Craft consumer marketing director. “A fabric must be clean of residue in order for it to repel water. Traditional household cleaners contain heavy suds, optical brighteners and fabric softeners which tend to deposit additional residues on the fabric making it more difficult for the fabric to repel water. You must begin by cleaning the fabric and more importantly, by cleaning with a specialized cleaner like ReviveX Pro Cleaner.”\nThe ReviveX Durable Waterproofing Spray Combo Pack ensures the fabric is cleaned properly which is essential prior to applying a water repellent. Non-toxic and solvent free, the cleaner and water repellent are safe for use on waterproof-breathable fabrics including GORE-TEX® fabrics, eVent® and NeoShell®. Repels water, oil and stains on all fabric types.
