We, or my family, are suffering an insecure tax situation that affects the planning of his career,\" Neymar Sr told Barcelona sports daily Sport.\n\"We need these issues to stop. How can we extend something if we don't have tax stability?\"\nNeymar isn't the only Barca player to be plagued by tax problems as four-time World Player of the Year Lionel Messi is to face trial over tax fraud over his image rights between 2007 and 2009.\nFellow-Argentine Javier Mascherano is also to go before a judge later this month in a case related to the tax payments on his image rights.\n\"We are seeing various players suffering tax penalties. Why would I anticipate a renewal if I don't have judicial security that will back us to be able to work? I intend to wait and be calm to manage Neymar in the best way possible.\"\nOn the field Neymar produced one of best performances in a Barcelona shirt on Saturday as he scored four and assisted Luis Suarez for the Catalans' other goal in a 5-2 win over Rayo Vallecano.\nAnd his father insisted Barcelona is the best place for him to keep developing despite admitting that Manchester United had tried to sign the 23-year-old during the summer.\n\"They phoned Barcelona. They got a response that Neymar had a contract and that they would not sell him. People should be calm, Neymar still has three years on his contract.\"\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/AO_Sports", "https://www.facebook.com/AhramOnlineSports?fref=ts"], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T18:37:49.643+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
