Down by 10 points in the second half while on the road at a venue where Washington State had not won in more than a decade, Falk showed uncommon grit to lead the Cougars’ rally. Even though he was sacked seven times for the second week in a row, Falk played well in the Cougars’ 45-38 double overtime win against Oregon. The Cougars’ first-year starter finished 50-of-74 for 505 yards with no interceptions, five passing touchdowns and one rushing touchdown. “I thought he played a real good fourth quarter and a pretty good first half,” WSU coach Mike Leach said of his quarterback, who recorded the second 500-yard passing game of his young career against Oregon. But what’s maybe more notable is his willingness to put himself on the line to do whatever it takes for his team to win a game. Against Portland State, he landed awkwardly on his throwing shoulder when he was upended by the defense when running for a first down. He got the conversion, but had to leave the game. Still, Falk was back under center the next week and he led WSU to a key road win at Rutgers. Falk took a beating against California last week, getting sacked seven times in the loss. Asked afterward whether that was a particularly gritty game for his quarterback, receiver Gabe Marks said: “He’s a team guy. It’s not just today. He does it every day. I think he kinda likes it when it gets nasty out there and he gets in his groove. That’s normal. We see it all the time.” Against the Ducks on Saturday night, things got nasty again and Falk got hammered by the Oregon defense. Ducks linebacker Torrodney Prevot hit Falk so hard in the second quarter that the quarterback was slow getting off the field. The WSU training staff huddled around Falk on the bench right afterward to check him out, and backup quarterback Peyton Bender started throwing on the sideline. But on the next series, Falk went back into the game. Then, in the first overtime period, with the pressure on the Cougars to match Oregon’s touchdown, Falk once again showed his smash-mouth side as he lined up under center and rammed into the end zone on a quarterback keeper, but got leveled by Oregon’s defense in the process. The 6-foot-4, 205-pound quarterback literally crawled a couple of feet, holding his right arm gingerly, before he finally got up off the turf. If Falk was hurt at all, he didn’t show it when the offense went out again in the second overtime period and he hit Marks for 9 yards before launching what turned out to be the winning touchdown to Robert Lewis — though River Cracraft technically caught the ball, but it popped loose in the end zone and went to Lewis. After the game, Falk was asked if he was shaken up at all after Prevot’s sack. “No, I was just pretty happy,” he said, and laughed. Whether that’s actually true, we’ll never know because of Leach’s mandate that the team never discusses any injuries, but what’s clear is that while Falk is more than willing to make plays at the expense of himself, the Cougars need to keep their sophomore quarterback healthy. In the first five games of this season, Falk has been calm and efficient in Leach’s offense. He hasn’t always played well — Leach was critical of Falk in the first two games, saying the quarterback looked slow and deliberate — and the biggest knock against Falk lately has been that he holds on to the ball too long at times and takes unnecessary sacks. But Falk is also the element that makes this offense work. He’s fourth nationally with a 71.3 completion percentage, has thrown 15 touchdowns to only two interceptions, and has shown the kind of toughness that earns a quarterback his teammates’ unanimous respect. If nothing else, Oregon’s struggles in its first season of the post-Marcus Mariota era — the Ducks had a mere 123 passing yards against the Cougars — have shown that it’s extremely difficult to replace a long-time starter at quarterback. Falk’s predecessor, Connor Halliday, was electric in the Air Raid, and he provided a reassuring consistency at quarterback for WSU for two-and-a-half seasons. Falk has picked up where Halliday left off. That seamless transition is important in itself, and while the Cougars’ young quarterback still has a ways to go, the numbers indicate that he’s progressing nicely.
