The athletes, part of a 40-member squad, were left to fend for themselves ahead of the tournament with some of them spending last night outside a Gurudwara as authorities failed to provide accommodation. The Sports Ministry-recognised All India Sports Council of the Deaf was responsible for the differently-abled athletes but they failed at their job miserably. The athletes, however, did manage to get the Taiwanese visa later but not much can be expected from the contingent considering their frame of mind less than 24 hours ahead of the competition. While Sports Minister Sarbananda Sonowal was quick to order an inquiry, the Sports Authority of India (SAI) was also dragged into the controversy for not providing accommodation to the team members. “I was very sad to learn about this. Whoever is responsible for this will be brought to book,” Sonowal said. SAI DG Injeti Srinivas described the incident unfortunate. “You criticise SAI whenever it is due, but this case is a complete distortion of facts. Nobody asked us for accommodation. The athletes are suffering because their federation (All India Sports Council of the Deaf) is in a mess. The body has not even settled the accounts for the previous trip but despite that we made an exception and cleared Rs50 lakh for the trip,” Srinivas said. — PTI", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T00:04:32.121+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
