Success??? It's not actually much to write home about.\nBUT, it's not over yet! We still have two indoor-grown ladies to harvest and Jeremy's thinking they'll produce over an ounce each. Crossing my fingers!\nHow does harvest work?\n1. Trim the leaves off the plant as if you were cutting long-stem roses. Don't trash the leaves though - Jeremy suggests using them for mulch or fertilizer.\nWhat about smoking leaves? Jeremy said he's conducted several studies that have shown marijuana leaves don't usually produce more than about 1.5% THC and 1.5% CBD, at most.\n\"Leaves have a tiny effect when smoked. The remainder is a harsh smoke, consisting of combusting plant material,\" Jeremy said, not something you probably want in your lungs.\nTeresa Mahoney / Staff 2. Cut stems strategically to make a natural \"Y\" shape so you can hook them to a clothes hanger.\nTeresa Mahoney / Staff 3. Hang each stem a few inches apart on a clothes hanger so they're not touching. You might need more hangers depending on how much you harvest.\nTeresa Mahoney / Staff\n4. Hang in dark, dry closet. Mild humidity (50%), low temperature (58-62 degrees). Jeremy said it's important to make sure the environment is stable (i.e., doesn't go from oven to freezer overnight).\nTeresa Mahoney / Staff\n5. Put a fan in the closet to help with air circulation. A gentle breeze is plenty.\n6. Drying/curing should take about 10-14 days. You'll know they're ready when stems are able to gently snap. Flowers will still have a tiny bit of moisture.\nOutdoor plant harvest hanging to dry, one week later. It's almost ready. Courtesy/ Jeremy Plumb 7. Consume! As you can see by the photos, I didn't participate in this harvest, but I'm hoping to give it a whirl when the indoor plants are ready late November.\nHere's a look at our outdoor Dogwalker clone plant through the weeks. They grow up so fast!\nLeft to right: Our outdoor Dogwalker strain as a clone (day 1) , in the flowering stage (day 94) and harvested (day 115). Teresa Mahoney / Staff What will we do with our harvest?\nAs I mentioned in my last diary entry , we're dividing the final harvest three ways.\nStay tuned for updates on the indoor grows!\nHappy growing,\nTeresa\nPS - Due to technical difficulties, the indoor grow live stream has been off air. Working on getting that back up and running! But to give you an idea of how big they are, they no longer fit into the frame of the camera.\n--\nPot Grow Diary: Day 1 | The Oregonian grows weed.
