Finally given a New York team talented enough to win, he's pushed all the right buttons in his first postseason as a big-league skipper, expertly piloting the NL East champs to a surprising pennant.\nAnd just think, it only took him 1,688 regular-season games to reach the playoffs.\n\"Baseball has been my life â€” my whole life. I was one of those guys that started playing when he was 4 or 5,\" said Collins, whose father died just before spring training. \"So it's a special moment for me.\"\nFor the Mets, too. Back in the World Series for the first time in 15 years, they'll play the AL champion Royals beginning Tuesday night in Kansas City.\nCollins, no doubt, is a big reason for New York's success.\nHe made several pivotal and gutsy moves during Game 5 of the NL Division Series at Dodger Stadium, sticking with struggling ace Jacob deGrom early and then going to rookie Noah Syndergaard for his first career relief appearance in the seventh inning.\nCollins also called on closer Jeurys Familia for a six-out save.\nThen, during a four-game sweep in the NL Championship Series , Collins turned the Mets loose on the basepaths even though they ranked last in the league in steals this season. It paid huge dividends against a Chicago Cubs team that had real trouble holding runners.\nWhen his team clinched the division title in Cincinnati, he came back onto the field to celebrate with Mets fans who made the trip, spraying them with champagne. He did the same following Game 5 in Los Angeles, even getting a kiss on the cheek from an overjoyed man in the front row.\nAnd after returning to New York following the sweep against the Cubs, Collins took his wife to dinner Thursday night. Patrons gathered for a salute and, quite literally, made him the toast of the town.\nWhether it be joking that his wife calls him an \"idiot\" after in-game moves backfire, or when he kidded about star pitcher Matt Harvey making the team flight on time, the silver-haired Collins has shown his sense of humor to the media more and more during his five years in the Big Apple.\nIt's a sign of his transformation from an old-school manager with a previous reputation for being fiery and uncompromising, to one who more resembles a spunky grandfather with baseball savvy.\n\"Forty-five years and here's my first chance to do this,\" Collins said Friday. \"The one thing I said when I took this job, I was going to enjoy managing a lot more than I did in the past.\"", "external_links": ["http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/57/71/8846917/5/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/57/71/8846917/5/square_gallery_thumb.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-25T05:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T09:25:55.712+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
