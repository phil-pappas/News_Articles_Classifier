(Sue Beyer | For lehighvalleylive.com) By Greg Joyce | For lehighvalleylive.com on October 21, 2015 7:33 PM \nAll of the good things a cornerback does in a football game can get clouded over with one single pass. \nThe nature of the position can breed confidence easily, but it doesn’t always last long. \nEaston senior Nate Moser experienced that Friday night against Parkland . The cornerback had played a solid first half while guarding Trojans’ receiver Kenny Yeboah , and even started the second half with an interception of Devante Cross . \nThe fourth quarter wasn’t as kind to Moser, though. Yeboah beat him twice for touchdowns, using his 6-foot-5 frame to haul in passes over the 5-foot-11 Moser. \n“That’s the life of a cornerback,” Red Rovers coach Steve Shiffert said. “Sometimes you do really well and sometimes you get in a mismatch that’s difficult to deal with.” \nRELATED : Freedom's Cordell Cotto anchors EPC's top defense ahead of Parkland showdown \nIf getting beat for touchdowns is the worst part of being a cornerback, the best part is every play provides another opportunity to make a stop. Moser should get plenty of those come Friday night as Easton takes on Liberty. \nThe Hurricanes have the deepest stable of wide receivers in the league, but Moser figures to be matched up on junior Darian Street or senior Victor Santiago . \n“Coming off a loss, it sucks. It’s bad,” Moser said. “So we’re coming out here working hard. We got Liberty this week, they’re a very good team so we gotta get the job done.” \nMoser leads the Red Rovers with three interceptions this season in his first year as a starter. He bided his time behind Shane Simpson at cornerback last year, seeing some action but not nearly the amount he has this year. \n“Coming off the bench, I definitely had to prove myself to coaches and the team, show them I could play,” Moser said. \nThe Palmer Township native went to speed camps during the offseason and put in extra work to get ready for playing a bigger role as a senior. \n“My technique and speed got better and just as an all-around player I got better,” he said. \n“He’s just gaining confidence,” Shiffert said. \nMoser also plays guard on the Easton basketball team, but is hoping to soak in the rest of his final high school football season. \n“Right now, I love football a lot,” he said. :Senior year, coming out one last season with my team, I love it. It’s a great experience out here. I love football, probably more than basketball at this point.” \nDespite the touchdowns he was on the wrong end of, Moser and the Easton defense played well enough to win against Parkland. Instead, the offense couldn’t do its part because of an onslaught of penalties. \nThe Red Rovers’ practices this week have included plenty of discipline drills and extra running in an attempt to not have flags haunt them again this week. \n“We try to do as many drills that we can that involve discipline where they can’t move, gotta watch the ball and that type of thing,” Shiffert said. “But sometimes you can drill it till the cows come home and it just doesn’t work out.” \n“… I think the hardest thing the kids gotta realize is you go through a hard period before you get to the good period. And that’s the practice in the beginning of the week. It’s tough to get going again after you’ve made those mistakes.” \nBut the defense is hoping to build off of its solid game Friday night at Bethlehem Area School District Stadium in the battle against Liberty. \nEaston is in the midst of a brutal stretch where they face four of the league’s top quarterbacks – Cross, Doug Erney, Joe Young and Travis Stefanik – in the final four weeks of the season. \nThat means plenty of opportunities for Moser and the secondary to forget about the past – good and bad – and play the next snap. \n“We try to look past it,” Moser said. “Can’t win them all, so we try to do our best. Coaches push us hard and we try to win every week. … The big teams at the end, it’s a great experience. It’s tough, so we gotta come out, work our best and just play.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T02:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T03:00:39.143+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
