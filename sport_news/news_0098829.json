In the book, Powell claims McGee, U of L's former director of basketball operations, paid her and other escorts, including her own teenage daughters, thousands of dollars and gave them game tickets in exchange for dancing for and having sex with players and recruits. \nMcGee's lawyer, Scott C. Cox, acknowledged on the day the book was released that McGee knows Powell, but he said McGee did not pay for escorts to have sex with players or recruits. \nLouisville head coach Rick Pitino, in several public appearances in the past few weeks, has said if anything happened, he did not have knowledge of it. Reached Tuesday morning for his reaction to the ESPN report, Pitino said he was \"devastated\" and \"disappointed,\" but that he loves his current Louisville team and \"will give them all I have.\" \nPowell's book has prompted investigations by U of L, the NCAA and by local Louisville authorities. Commonwealthâ€™s Attorney Tom Wine said Powell could be prosecuted if there was corroborating evidence that her daughters were underage at the time, though Powell told ESPN, \"Everybody I dealt with was grown. They were able to make their own decisions as to what they wanted to do.\" \nHer lawyers are set to meet with U of L's general counsel on Tuesday, ESPN reported. The book's coauthor, journalist Dick Cady, told The Courier-Journal earlier this month that he met with U of L's private investigator, Chuck Smrt, and a compliance officer the day the book was released. \nThe NCAA has reportedly interviewed several former Louisville recruits. \n\"I couldn't make this up if I wanted to,\" Powell told \"Outside the Lines.\" \nOne former Louisville recruit who is attending another school told ESPN: \"I knew they weren't college girls. It was crazy. It was like I was in a strip club.\" \nPowell, in her interview with ESPN's \"Outside the Lines,\" parts of which were shown on ABC's \"Good Morning America,\" said McGee paid for \"side deals\" for players and recruits. \nAnother player told ESPN that McGee \"would give us the money, just the recruits. A bunch of us were sitting there while they danced. Then the players left, and the recruits chose which one [of the dancers] they wanted.\" \nESPN said five former Louisville recruits -- Montrezl Harrell, JaQuan Lyle, Jordan Mickey, Antonio Blakeney and Terry Rozier -- had sex with one of Powell's escorts. Harrell and Rozier both played for U of L, while Lyle (Ohio State), Blakeney (LSU) and Mickey (LSU) signed elsewhere. \nOne of Powell's daughters, in the OTL segment, claims she had sex with former U of L star Russ Smith, who was an All-American senior. Smith has not responded to messages seeking comment. \nHarrell has not responded to multiple messages seeking comment, but he told reporters in Houston, where he now plays in the NBA, that he didn't \"know anything about any\" of the allegations spelled out in Powell's book. \nRozier, like Harrell, has not responded to multiple messages seeking comment, but he told the Boston Globe earlier this month that he would \"answer those questions\" when the time was right. \nTo ESPN, Rozier said, \"I don't want to talk about it. ... I was already committed before I took my visit. ... I will say, though, (Pitino), as far as the dorm situations and visits, he'd go out to eat with the recruits and their parents. As far as after that, he wouldn't know. ... I can say his nose is clean.\" \nThe ESPN report said \"Outside the Lines\" reviewed Powell's journals, text messages and phone records and independently confirmed that text messages sent to Powell to arrange the parties came from McGee's cellphone. The report also says ESPN independently confirmed a wire transfer of money from McGee to Powell on one occasion. \nAsked if Pitino or U of L athletic director Tom Jurich would have any comment on the OTL report, the university put out a statement: \"To preserve the integrity of the review process, the university will withhold comment on any details until the review is concluded.\" \nIn the clip played on Good Morning America, Powell doesn't say whether she thinks U of L coach Rick Pitino knew about the parties or the other illicit activities. But in the full ESPN report, she reiterated what she told the Indianapolis Business Journal in September, that McGee said Pitino did know about the interactions between McGee and the players and recruits and the escorts. \n\"Four years, a boatload of recruits, a boatload of dancers, loud music, alcohol, security cameras, basketball players who came in at will -- how could Rick not know?\" Powell told ESPN. \nAs the investigations continue, several former U of L players and assistant coaches have spoken out in the past few weeks, saying they had never seen or heard of Powell and that if any of the illicit activities did take place, Pitino wouldn't support them. Powell's book claims 22 illicit parties with U of L players and recruits took place between 2010-14, with many of them occurring at Minardi Hall, the dormitory that houses Louisville basketball players. \nLuke Hancock, the Final Four's most outstanding player when the Cards won the 2013 national title, said on the radio last week that he \"never saw anything, heard anything, wasn't involved in anything.\" \n\"If I wasn't, and I lived there, how could you expect Rick Pitino to know?\" Hancock said. \nHancock's former teammates Tim Henderson, Mike Marra and Stephan Van Treese have all echoed his statements. \nPitino's son, Richard, who is now the head coach at Minnesota and was an assistant at U of L, told ESPN, \"with zero doubt,\" that his dad \"knew nothing about any of these alleged incidents.\" Cincinnati head coach Mick Cronin, the elder Pitino's former associate head coach at U of L in the early 2000s, told The Sporting News last week that there was \"zero chance\" Pitino knew about the alleged parties. \nIn his only comments on the book's allegations, Jurich said in early October that the university will \"get to the bottom of this\" with its investigation. U of L has retained the law firm Stites and Harbison for general legal review. Louisville head coach Rick Pitino reacts during the Cardinals game against North Carolina.
