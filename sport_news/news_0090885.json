After all, the lefty did not finish last season because of right knee surgery. \nThen, this season was interrupted with more troubles with the same knee.\n“I was scared for sure going down, but I felt I had a good chance of getting back out there,” Sabathia said. “And being able to pitch well is a bonus.”\nBeing able to pitch and win the game that secured the Yankees’ return to the playoffs was even better.\n“CC is going to pitch big in the big game. That’s what we expect of him. That’s what he did tonight,” said Adam Warren, who accepted the torch for three innings after Sabathia worked the first five in the Yankees’ 4-1, wild-card clinching victory over Boston at the Stadium Thursday.\n“He’s the best pitcher of my era,” catcher Brian McCann said. “It couldn’t have ended any better with him on the mound, getting us there.”\nCC Sabathia allowed one run in five innings and picked up the win. Photo: Charles Wenzelberg It was not Sabathia at his very best, but it was an effective Sabathia. He did not have a single clean inning, but made the pitches he needed to make and got the help he needed to get behind him. Two double plays thwarted Boston at key moments as Sabathia improved to 6-10 allowing one earned run, six hits and three walks, one intentional, in his five innings.\n“It means a lot to be on the mound for the game where we’re trying to clinch,” said Sabathia, whose ERA dipped to 2.17 for his five starts since coming off the disabled list Sept. 9 because of right knee inflammation. “The guys stepped up. I wasn’t that sharp. But guys stepped up and we got it done.”\nThe guys who stepped up were glad to get it done for Sabathia.\n“I’m glad for him because CC had really battled,” said Carlos Beltran, who slugged one of three Yankees homers. “When he hurt his knee, people thought he wasn’t going to be able to be back. CC’s a horse, man. I love watching him on the mound. Since he was in Cleveland, I always considered him a guy that will fight.”\nSabathia credited his knee brace for alleviating doubt. He could land and plant like the Sabathia of old.\n“It’s been a long road,” he said. “I didn’t get a chance to finish and I had the knee surgery and this year I had an up-and-down season. To be able to find myself, feels great. It’s the brace, for sure. The rest and the brace have helped. Obviously two weeks off in the season is not ideal but I took advantage and we did the rehab and I’m ready to go. And whenever I get a chance to pitch in the postseason I’ll be ready.”\nDitto the Yankees, who Sabathia sees as legit title contenders.\n“Because it’s a good team,” he said. “We’ve got a combination of everything and if we pitch well and keep playing the way we’ve been playing, we’ve got a good chance.”\nModal Trigger Worst fears to clincher: CC Sabathia comes full circle in a month Posted: October 2, 2015 View Thumbnails Previous Next Advertisement Dellin Betances and John Ryan Murphy jump for joy as the Yankees clinch.
