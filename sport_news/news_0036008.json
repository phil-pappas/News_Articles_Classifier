Manziel admitted drinking before the incident, but police didn't charge him. \nManziel spent 70 days in a Pennsylvania rehab facility during the offseason for treatment of an unspecified condition. The Browns said they are aware of the incident. \nThe former Heisman Trophy winner started and won one game for the Browns this season. He's currently backing up starter Josh McCown. \nManziel made two starts last year during a turbulent rookie season.
