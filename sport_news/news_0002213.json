She powered her way alone to the finish line. \nTop performer: Bonaguidi won her first H/W/S individual crown in 18 minutes and 40 seconds. She became the first Terrier girl to win the county title. \nWhat it means: Bonaguidi showed she will be an individual force to be reckoned with throughout the season, as did other top finishers such as North Hunterdon’s Anna DiMarcello (second) and Voorhees' Lauren Wagner (third). The Lions won a team championship they wanted very much.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T00:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T02:52:36.643+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
