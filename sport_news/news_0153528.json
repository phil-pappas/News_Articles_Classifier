He also made three field goals.\n\"From that standpoint, he did a great job for us,\" Golden said. \"Obviously, we wouldn't have won last week if it weren't for him. We lost [Thursday] as a team. I know he wishes he had a couple of those back, there's no question about that.\"\nBadgley, a freshman, has made 5 of 5 field goals at home. On the road, he is 6 of 9.\nDefensive changes?\nGolden said there could be some potential personnel moves on the defensive side after Thursday's performance. The Bearcats gained 446 total yards.\n\"There are some things we're certainly looking at on the defensive side,\" Golden said. \"…There are some things we're looking at.\"\nThird downs a concern\nThe Hurricanes were just 4 of 15 on third downs, continuing a trend of struggles. Golden said the issue has to be corrected by having more efficiency on second down.\n\"We're looking at all of it,\" Golden said. \"As I look at this here, we had nine that were 3rd-and-6 and more. … Those definitely have an impact.\"\nNext game: Miami at Florida State, Oct. 10, time and TV TBD\nsrichardson@tribpub.com\n Miami Hurricanes", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-560f10ad/turbine/fl-miami-hurricanes-news-1003-20151002"], "published": "2015-10-02T22:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T17:27:48.304+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
