Cedar Falls’ Sam Schillinger and Isaac Smith finished in 15:50 and 15:52, respectively. Linn-Mar’s Michael Mather was fourth in 15:57. \nAll 14 MVC schools were in attendance, but the boys’ race evolved into a dual. Cedar Falls and Prairie combined for 10 of the top 11 runners, with Cedar Falls edging the Hawks by a 28-34 margin. Linn-Mar was third with 109 points. \n“We’re definitely getting better, every day,” VanDraska said. “All the guys are cutting time, and we have a freshman (11th-place Colton LaGrange) was is killing it.” \nPrairie’s Jake Moore, Cam Steffens and Chris Oehlert were fifth, eighth and ninth, respectively. \nClass 4A second-rated Cedar Falls beat No. 4 Prairie handily at the Prairie Invitational in August. The Hawks have carved at the gap. \n“We’re not there yet, but we’re going to get faster and faster,” VanDraska said. “I think Fort Dodge (site of the state meet Oct. 31), that will be our fastest day.” \nLed by individual champion Mary Arch, Iowa City High took top honors in the girls’ race. The Little Hawks tallied 64 points, followed by Cedar Falls (77), Linn-Mar (93) and short-handed Iowa City West (98). \nArch raced to the front of the pack immediately, then held off fast-finishing Reagan Gorman of Cedar Rapids Washington. Arch was clocked in 18:52; Gorman in 18:58. West’s Tia Saunders was third in 17:14. \n“I like to see how much I can push myself,” Arch said. “It’s important to know how hard you can compete if you run by yourself. \n“I was pretty confident we would do well today. We have accomplished a lot of really big things lately.” \nArch was out and away from the pack in a hurry, and led by 10 seconds at the mile mark at 5:44. The margin remained the same through the second mile before Gorman chipped away somewhat. \n“I don’t mind letting people get ahead,” Gorman said “Just not too far ahead.” \nArch was one of three City runners in the top 10. Anna Lindower was eighth, Emily Bywater 10th. \nGorman was the first of five Metro runners that finished in the top seven. \nCedar Rapids Kennedy’s Hannah Fusselman was fourth in 19:23, followed by Maddie Mann of Linn-Mar (fifth), Meredith Koenigsfeld of Cedar Rapids Jefferson (sixth) and Jenny Dickes of Cedar Rapids Xavier (seventh). \nMISSISSIPPI VALLEY CONFERENCE SUPER MEET \nAt Waterloo (Byrnes Park) \nGirls Results \nTeams — 1.
