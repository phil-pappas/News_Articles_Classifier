He was 16 years, 6 months, 16 days old. \nItaly and Juventus goalkeeping legend Gianluigi Buffon was 17 when he made his debut for Parma. \nAll content copyright ©2015 Pendleton Times-Post, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T00:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T01:37:15.483+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
