Then the singer became a mainstay on MTV. The teen became obsessed.\n\"I really liked her look,\" Dollar, now 46, said. \"It was really edgy for the time, especially being out in 1980s Beaverton.\"\nBefore going to the concert, she scoured secondhand shops for fingerless lace gloves and 1940s braziers to wear as undershirts. She had the horn-rimmed sunglasses. But on the day of the show, Dollar's outfit was missing something.\nDanette Dollar remembers Madonna 1985 concert Danette Dollar remembers finding the right religious articles to wear and getting her picture taken with the Beastie Boys in 1985 at the Madonna concert.\nShe spotted a magnificent string of rosary beads with a large crucifix hanging from a statue of the Blessed Virgin in her friend Angela's living room. The girls were alone in the house.\n\"Her mom was away at the Coast,\" Dollar recalled. \"I asked her if I could wear the rosary to the concert.\"\nAngela hesitated before saying yes. \"Just don't tell my mom,\" she told Dollar.\nIn his tour diary \"Life with My Sister Madonna,\" the pop star's brother, Christopher Ciccone, recounted how he feared for Madonna's life because of what he saw outside the Schnitz.\n\"From the moment we arrive in Portland, Oregon, on April 15, it feels like one of the strangest cities I've ever visited,\" Ciccone writes. \"Outside the Arlene Schnitzer Concert Hall, religious fanatics are picketing the show, milling around with placards proclaiming that Madonna is Satan's spawn, and that she is going to hell.\"\nThe picketers heckled Dollar outside the theater, telling her she was disgracing the rosary around her neck. \"I'm not Catholic,\" she told them.\nBefore walking inside, she struck her best Madonna pose near a parking meter for a photographer from The Oregonian.\nGirls dressed in Madonna outfits booed the Beastie Boys through their opening set. But once the headliner took the stage, they shouted every lyric and mimicked her dance moves. It was pure pop ecstasy.\nOf course, the next morning, the photo of her wearing the rosary beads appeared in the newspaper. Her friend's mother saw it. Busted.\n\"Oh my God,\" she recalled, \"did I get a lecture on the sanctity of the Rosary.\"\nNow the mother of a 25-year-old son and working at in a Fred Meyer furniture department in Hillsboro, Dollar said she has lost touch with Madonna's newer music but she remains a big fan. \"Sadly,\" she said, \"I wasn't able to get tickets to the show this time.\"\nLiz Ephren\nEphren was a16-year-old Romani who had just eloped. \"In our tradition, because I was married,\" she said, \"I couldn't wear pants. To my mother and father, it wouldn't have looked respectful to my husband.\"\nLiz Ephren: then and now. The Oregonian file photo/Photo courtesy of Liz Ephren On the night of the Madonna show, she left her parents' house wearing a skirt. But once she was in the car with her cousins, Ephren's rebellious side took control: she changed into a pair of jeans.\nHer cousins, Michele and Linda, were dressed like their pop idol. When she saw the 30-year-old photo of the three of them at the show, she blinked her eyes in disbelief and laughed out loud.\nIt was the first concert she and her husband attended together. (\"He didn't care if I wore pants.\") They were young and in love. Madonna sang the songs of their courtship.\n\"My husband knew the ticket scalpers in town,\" Ephren said. \"He was able to get us tickets for a good price. And my husband would never get a bad seat.\"\nShe still cherishes those two hours with her cousins among the mob packed into the Schnitzer mezzanine. More than anything, she remembers hearing her favorite Madonna song, \"Like a Virgin.\"\nEphren, now the mother of four sons and still living in Portland, eventually lost touch with Madonna. \"We had to worry about bills and responsibilities and life,\" she said. \"But I'm still a fan.\"\nJoseph Newland via email\nJoseph Newland Joseph Rose | The Oregonian/OregonLive \"Your article made me recall that I still had my old, beat up ticket stub. Wow. $15.50. I was 20 and went with three other dudes because we thought she was hot and the music was ok. I'll skip her concert this year, but already went to Rush, Aerosmith and Robert Plant. Unbelievable how these people are still doing their thing at the ages that they are at.\"\nâ€” Joseph Rose\n503-221-8029\njrose@oregonian.com\n@josephjrose", "external_links": ["https://books.google.com/books?id=nKuoMD4UG-0C&pg=PA103&lpg=PA103&dq=christopher+Ciccone+portland&source=bl&ots=siXmEVD18q&sig=OAlU4KwfPduO_UVsALZazli_vuo&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CDoQ6AEwBWoVChMIyonXqb69yAIVT_tjCh1mQQVZ#v=onepage&q=christopher%20Ciccone%20portland&f=false", "https://www.facebook.com/Skoochies", "http://twitter.com/josephjrose", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMHRq7yGdkA", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/ydZMpdmwjeA"], "published": "2015-10-14T14:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T20:02:42.657+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
