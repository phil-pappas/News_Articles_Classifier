What do you think? Log in and start commenting \nPaul Clement's rampant team were sharper in attack, with Wolves' young defence struggling to cope in what was a reality check after successive 3-0 victories before the international break. \nJackett made one change from the side that had beaten Huddersfield 3-0 before the international break, replacing Sheyi Ojo with Jed Wallace. \nThere was a boisterous atmosphere before kick off with a near-full iPro a sea of scarves after 24,000 were handed out to fans in the build-up to the game. \nAnd if the noise was intended to get Derby flying out of the traps it certainly worked as they took the lead inside three minutes. \nThe ball was worked to Martin outside the box and his rasping effort flew into the top corner, leaving Martinez no chance. \nThe goal will have had some Wolves fans fearing a repeat of last season's 5-0 thrashing and those concerns will have increased when former Albion midfielder George Thorne got behind a thumping 25-yard volley which Martinez beat away. \nAttacks were few and far between in the opening stages for Wolves. \nBut out of the blue they equalised with a superb strike from Afobe. \nIn a pre-worked move, Henry sent a low corner towards the penalty spot where Afobe lashed past Scott Carson with a rasping shot. \nDerby responded instantly and Martinez was again called upon, saving a Martin shot on the turn. Adam Le Fondre of Wolverhampton Wanderers celebrates after scoring a goal to make it 4-2 \nBack came Wolves and from a Henry cross Adam Le Fondre could have made it 2-1, but ex-Wolves defender Jason Shackell blocked his goalbound effort. \nAnd just three minutes later Derby made Wolves pay by re-taking the lead. \nIt was a howler from a Wolves point of view - Dominic Iorfa's poor clearance gave Derby the ball back and from Johnson's cross Martin beat Martinez to the ball and nodded home. \nThe goal was a carbon copy of Kenwyne Jones' header at Cardiff in August, with the keeper in no-man's land as Kortney Hause left the cross, presumably after getting a shout from the Argentine. \nHenry was Wolves' most creative outlet by a distance, tormenting Derby left-back Craig Forstyth, but from another excellent cross Derby cleared their lines with no one there to tap home. \nThe game was meandering gently towards half time but then in stoppage time Derby won a penalty, with Batth clearly taking out Thomas Ince in the box. \nThe captain earned a booking, but Martinez redeemed himself by saving his second penalty of the season to deny Martin a hat-trick. \nHowever just seconds later his good work was undone when Derby made it 3-1, with dreadful defending allowing a corner to hit Johnson and trickle into the net past the statuesque goalkeeper. \nWolves were unchanged at half time and indeed little changed on the field with Derby carrying on where they left off. Kevin McDonald of Wolverhampton Wanderers \nRussell coasted past Hause and shot at Martinez, before a Hendrick free kick hit the wall. \nIt was all Derby and on 57 minutes they scored yet again. Wolves were picked apart at the back and Scott Golbourne's block from near his own goal line fell to Russell, who fired into the corner. \nWolves were shellshocked and their priority suddenly became keeping the score down with as succession of shots blocked as the visitors struggled to cope with the Derby onslaught. \nJackett reacted by replacing Wallace and Jack Price with Sheyi Ojo and Conor Coady. \nAnd like in his previous two substitute appearances against Preston and Fulham, Ojo made an immediate impact, teeing up Le Fondre with a header and the on-loan striker smartly beat Carson from close range. \nIt was a goal from nowhere that gave Wolves faint hope. \nBut any Wolves fans expecting a rousing finish were to be disappointed - they barely tested Carson again, with Derby looking the more likely scorers. \nRussell, a constant menace, forced a late save from Martinez as the game petered out in the closing minutes. \nWith eight minutes left Jackett sent on teenager Bright Enobakhare in place of Le Fondre, but the game was long gone with Wolves unable to make any headway. \nDERBY: Carson; Christie (Baird, 79), Keogh, Shackell, Forsyth; Ince, Thorne, Hendrick (Butterfield, 74), Johnson, Russell; Martin (Bent, 90).
