(AP) — Emiliano Grillo holed out from 175 yards for an eagle on the par-4 18th hole Friday to take the lead in the Web.com Tour Finals-ending Web.Com Tour Championship. \nThe 23-year-old player from Argentina finished with a 6-under 64 to reach 10-under 130 after two rounds on TPC Sawgrass’ rain-soaked Dye’s Valley Course. He used a 9-iron on the eagle. \n“It was a hard wind from behind and I hit it perfect,” Grillo said. “I’m pretty happy with the way I finished.” \nLucas Glover, the 2009 U.S. Open champion, was second after a 67. \n“The harder it played, the better I played for some reason,” said Glover, who had five one-putts on the outward nine. “I hit a bunch of good flat shots into the wind. I played great on the front.” \nThe tournament is the fourth and final event in the series for the top 75 players from the Web.com Tour money list, Nos. 126-200 in the PGA Tour’s FedEx Cup standings and non-members such as Grillo who earned enough money to have placed in the top 200 had they been eligible to receive points. \nThe top 25 players on the Web.com Tour regular-season money list earned PGA Tour cards. They are competing against each other for tour priority, with regular-season earnings counting in their totals. The other players are fighting for 25 cards based on series earnings. \nGrillo is fifth on the series money list with $103,667, more than enough to wrap up a PGA Tour card. He lost a playoff in March in the PGA Tour’s Puerto Rico Open. \nGrillo birdied five of his first 10 holes, had a double bogey on the par-4 12th, birdied the par-4 17th and closed with the eagle. He hit 15 of 18 greens in regulation. \n“I played a perfect front nine,” Grillo said. “I couldn’t play it any better. I hit some great shots.” \nGlover was 147th in the FedEx Cup standings and is 15th in the series with $38,991. Last year, Eric Axley took the 25th card with $36,312. \n“I set out these four weeks with a job and that is still the mentality,” Glover said. “I just want to play as good as I could and I’ll check it on Sunday night.” \nChez Reavie and D.H. Lee were tied for third at 8 under. They have already secured PGA Tour cards. \nReavie, the winner of the second event in the series, had a 65, and Lee shot 67. \nReavie leads the series money list with $215,067. He won the 2008 Canadian Open. \nLee, from South Korea, finished in the top 25 on the Web.com Tour regular-season money list and has earned $92,300 in the series to jump to sixth on the combined money list with $281,067. \nSam Saunders topped the group at 7 under after a 69. Saunders, Arnold Palmer’s grandson, was 137th in the FedEx Cup standings and is 12th on the series list with $46,950. \nTommy Gainey was 8 under with three holes left, but dropped four strokes with a triple bogey and a bogey on the next two holes. He was tied for 17th at 4 under after a 69. \nGainey was 35th on the Web.com Tour regular season money list and is 84th in the series standings with $2,727. He won the PGA Tour’s 2012 McGladrey Classic. Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T02:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T04:08:21.451+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
