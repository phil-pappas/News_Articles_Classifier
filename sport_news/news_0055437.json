(AP) - LHC Group Inc., a Louisiana-based home health and hospice company, will acquire Georgia-based Halcyon Hospice LLC and its 16 facilities for $58.5 million in cash.\nHalcyon is one of the largest independent hospice companies in the Southeast. The Advocate reports ( http://bit.ly/1GrLCDE ) the company employs around 400 people and has facilities in Georgia, Mississippi and South Carolina.\nHalcyon's annual revenue is roughly $41 million. The deal will increase LHC's hospice segment to 53 locations in 12 states and more than $110 million in annual revenue.\nThe Halcyon acquisition costs are expected to lower LHC's fourth-quarter earnings by around 6 cents per share. But the new properties will add an estimated 15 cents to 20 cents per share in 2016.\nInformation from: The Advocate, http://theadvocate.com\n ", "external_links": ["http://bit.ly/1GrLCDE"], "published": "2015-10-05T15:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T15:21:48.228+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
