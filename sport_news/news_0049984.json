Those projects range from building fitness zones and playgrounds to hosting youth football clinics. \n“We are committed to giving children access to the tools they need to make healthy, lifelong choices,” United Way CEO John Franklin said. “This annual partnership with the New York Jets is a great way to show our children how they can incorporate healthy habits into their daily routines.” Jets players work out with Dover Middle School students Staff video by Michael Izzo \nIn recent years for Hometown Huddle, the Jets have gone to Florham Park, where their practice faultily is located, Newark, and Montclair. This year guidance counselor Ana Rosa Acevedo brought Dover to United Way’s attention. \nTheresa Leamy, senior vice president of resource development for United Way of Northern New Jersey, said Dover was chosen as this year’s Hometown Huddle neighborhood because it’s an ALICE (Asset Limited, Income Constrained, Employed) community. \nLeamy said 53 percent of Dover residents fall under United Way’s ALICE measurements for financial hardship, as opposed to 40 percent statewide. The term describes families who have limited incomes but are employed.

The players can give them skills to ready them for high school and adulthood.” \nDover’s new PLAY 60 Fitness Zone, designed to encourage physical activity under the NFL’s PLAY 60 mission, includes five pieces of strength and cardio training equipment. \n“This is an outstanding opportunity for our students to meet and be inspired by professional athletes as we strive to emphasize personal health and wellness,” Dover Superintendent Robert Becker said. This kind of donation of equipment and time by both United Way and the New York Jets will have a long lasting positive impact on our students and community for which we are greatly appreciative.” Buy Photo \nNew York Jets linebacker Taiwan Jones helps Brianna Mejia, l, and Nicole Espinosa on the parallel bars as members of the New York Jets unveil a PLAY 60 Fitness Zone playground with 35 students from Dover Middle School as part of the NFLÕs 17th annual Hometown Huddle, an NFL-wide day of service with United Ways across the nation.

Students had to be in at least fifth grade to be eligible due to the size of the exercise equipment. \nPrincipal Tawana Clarett said there were hundreds of entries in the raffle. \n“We wanted all students to be a part of it, but the courtyard simply isn’t big enough for that,” Clarett said. “The contest ran for a week and everyone had a chance to be chosen if they were caught performing a random act of kindness by a teacher or student.” Buy Photo \nNy Jets rookie quarterback Bryce Petty takes a selfie with students as members of the New York Jets unveil a PLAY 60 Fitness Zone playground with 35 students from Dover Middle School as part of the NFLÕs 17th annual Hometown Huddle, an NFL-wide day of service with United Ways across the nation.

Each came up with fun activities for the students to do at the stations, from competing against one another to counting the number of reps they could do. \n“This is a unique experience, for kids to be taught by world-class athletes,” Linder said. “And Dover will get to use this equipment now in phys ed, at recess, and I’ve been told the staff plans to use it on their own too.” Buy Photo \nNew York Jets FB/LB Julian Howsare helped out Catalina Fernandez on the elliptical machine Howsare and other members of the New York Jets unveil a PLAY 60 Fitness Zone playground with 35 students from Dover Middle School as part of the NFLÕs 17th annual Hometown Huddle, an NFL-wide day of service with United Ways across the nation.
