Small-market managers are the most vulnerable when high expectations don't pan out.\nSeattle's Lloyd McClendon understands that only too well, having been fired by Pittsburgh back in the Pirates' penny-pinching days. Now he faces an uncertain future after a disappointing fourth-place finish which led to the mid-season dismissal of general manager Jack Zduriencik.\n\"If you're looking for security in this game you're in the wrong business,\" McClendon told MLB.com after meeting with his new boss Jerry Dipoto.\n\"I'm a professional juggler,\" said Dipoto, Seattle's ninth general manager.\nReportedly, Tim Bogar is a likely candidate if McClendon gets the axe.\nDipoto left the Angels after his turbulent relationship with manager Mike Scioscia generated too many sparks. He told MLB.com his issues in Anaheim reinforced the need for a cooperative situation in Seattle.\nEarly talks with McClendon went well, according to Dipoto, but he stopped short of giving the Gary native a ringing endorsement.\n\"He's had a challenging career path to get here,\" said Dipoto, acknowledging McClendon's rise from eighth-round draft choice to an eight-year career before managing the Pirates (2001-05), then serving on Jim Leyland's coaching staff in Detroit. \"He deserves consideration for anything moving forward.\"\nLast year, McClendon guided the Mariners to only their third winning season since 1993, 87 wins representing one of the most impressive turn-arounds in the majors. Signing free agent slugger Nelson Cruz raised the bar and some guess-perts picked them to win the American League West.\nCruz delivered as advertised, pounding 44 homer runs. Thanks to him and Kyle Seager (career-high 26 homers), the Mariners ranked fifth in that category. But they ranked in the bottom third in runs scored and below the anemic White Sox with a .249 team average.\nThat and a shaky pitching staff extended their playoff drought, which started after Lou Piniella managed them to a record 116 victories in 2001.\nNot much went right for McClendon, whose only innings-eaters were perennial Cy Young candidate Felix Hernandez, an 18-game winner whose other stats tailed off, and Taijuan Walker. Their stressed bullpen by committee blew 23 saves.\nKing Felix reached 200 innings for the seventh straight year, but finished nine strikeouts short of extending his streak of 200. The Mariners were also unstable behind fhe plate, None of five candidates hit their weight.\nWhere's the mystique?: Has interleague baseball lost its appeal? Except for rivalries in New York, Chicago and Los Angeles does anybody care? Apparently not even the schedule makers do, since interleague play now extends from April into September. Nothing's special about games sprinkled throughout the season.\nSo, instead of division rivals settling races down the stretch we get matchups like the Yankees-Mets, Dodgers-Angels, Marlins-Rays and Giants-Athletics.\nIssues about strength of schedule, particularly with the playoff-bound Yankees and Mets, also damage the integrity of the game.\nAnd don't get me started on baseball purity as long as one league embraces the designated hitter. It makes no sense to operate under different sets of rules. It's also risky for American League pitchers, who alter season-long routines to pick up a bat for an occasional series in a National League park. Either go with the DH or drop it.\nManaea's resume sparkles: Oakland couldn't be happier about Sean Manaea, acquired in a deal with Kansas City for Ben Zobrist on July 28. The 23-year-old lefty from Wanatah posted a 7-1 record in three different leagues and gave up only two earned runs in his last four starts, covering 28 innings.\nThe 6-5 Andrean grad's resume includes 90 strikeouts in 74 innings, improving our chances of seeing him pitch for the A's against the White Sox at \"The Cell\" next season.\nJohn Mutka is a freelance columnist for the Post-Tribune.\njmutkapt@gmail.com\nCopyright Â© 2015, Post-Tribune Major League Baseball Jerry Dipoto Seattle Mariners Pittsburgh Pirates New York Mets Chicago White Sox Nelson Cruz", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-5611c63a/turbine/ct-ptb-john-mutka-column-st-1005-20151004"], "published": "2015-10-05T03:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T18:25:38.021+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
