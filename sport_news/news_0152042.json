(Image Source: Gregory Shamus/Getty Images) \nAround the NFL in Week 5: \n* Undefeated: With wins on Sunday, the Atlanta Falcons, Cincinnati Bengals, Denver Broncos and Green Bay Packers all improved to 5-0. Two more teams, the 4-0 New England Patriots and Carolina Panthers, have a chance to reach 5-0 this week. The record for most 5-0 teams in a season is five, which happened in 2009. \n* Another Comeback: Among the six undefeated teams, no one has been more dramatic than the Atlanta Falcons, who overcame a fourth-quarter deficit to beat the Washington Redskins in Week 5. They are the first team to start a season 5-0 and overcome four fourth-quarter deficits along the way. Atlanta won the game in overtime on a 59-yard INT TD return by CB Robert Alford , the longest INT TD return in OT in a decade. Making his third-career start, RB Devonta Freeman rushed for 153 yards and a score to become the first player in the Super Bowl era to score seven rushing TDs in his first three career starts. \n* Rookie Watch: Arizona Cardinals RB David Johnson ran for two TDs in their 42-17 win over the Detroit Lions, giving him three rushing TDs, two receiving TDs and a KR TD on the season. He’s the first rookie since Hall of Famer Gale Sayers to have more than one rushing TD, at least two receiving scores and a trip to the paint via a kick return in the first five games of a season. \n* Old Man Watch: Veteran safety Charles Woodson continues to make plays at the age of 39. The Oakland Raiders DB helped keep his team in the game against the Denver Broncos with a pair of interceptions of Peyton Manning . Only two other players, Darrell Green and Clay Matthews Jr. were the first two, have ever had an INT at the age of 39, Woodson is the first to have two in the same game at such an advanced age. \n* A-Rod Goes Deep: In Green Bay’s 24-10 win over the St. Louis Rams, Packers QB Aaron Rodgers connected on a pair of TD passes, including a 65-yard scoring strike to WR James Jones . That gives A-Rod 31 TD passes of 50-plus yards since he became the starting QB in 2008, that’s the most in the NFL. \n* Triple-Threat: Buffalo Bills QB Tyrod Taylor threw for just 109 yards, which he helped make up for with 76 yards on the ground. He rushed for a score and threw for another, including a two-yard game winner to Chris Hogan in the fourth quarter. While 109 passing yards isn’t much to write home about Taylor also caught a pass which made him the first player since Randall Cunningham in 1987 (fifth ever) to throw for 100 yards, rush for 70 and have a reception in the same game. \n* Brown Out: Cleveland Browns QB Josh McCown led the team to an upset win, 33-30 in OT, over the Baltimore Ravens. The red-hot passer threw for 457 yards and two scores (no INTs) for a rating of 111.3. McCown set a franchise single-game passing record and he also became the first passer to throw for 300-plus yards in three-straight games in the history of the Browns. \nDaniel Mogollon is a member of the Pro Football Writers of America and the Football Writers Association of America.
