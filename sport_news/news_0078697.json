That night, California linebacker (Tustin High School) Alema Pilimai and Nevada wide receiver (Moapa Valley High School) RJ Hubert committed. On Monday, California defensive lineman (Leuzinger High School) Semesi Lauaki pledged commitment.\nScout.com rates Pilimai as a three-star prospect, while it gives Hubert and Lauaki two stars. All three are planning on serving LDS missions immediately after high school, so likely won’t be suiting up for at least two years.\nPilimai, who according to Scout stands 6-foot-4 and weighs 205 pounds, told the Deseret News the Utes started showing interest at the beginning of his junior year thanks to high school teammate Siaosi Wilson, who is now a freshman for Kyle Whittingham.\nPilimai said he’s been eager to make a decision where he’ll commit, and a recent conversation with his father made him realize Utah is the place he wants to go.\n“It’s been a lifelong dream to play in the Pac-12, and Utah football has a very good reputation of football,” he said. “I’ve always been a fan since I was younger, me and my family, so it’s just me fulfilling a lifelong dream, really.”\nIn particular, Pilimai said his relationships with the coaching staff are what sealed the deal for him. Those bonds were first formed when Pilimai attended a camp during the summer and have continued to this point.\n“The entire Utah staff, they all left a really great impression the first time I met them all,” he said, specifically mentioning linebackers coach Justin Ena. “I’m a huge fan of Coach Whittingham also. The vibe that they had at the camp, it was something I could tell I want for the next four years of college.”\nDid the Utes’ 4-0 start help sway him at all?\n“They were the first school to show interest in me, so I’ve always had a special spot for them in the back of my mind,” he said. “Their wins and how they’re doing this season just kind of made it easier for me to make the decision, but it wasn’t the turning point.”\nHubert’s recruiting process as far as Utah is concerned was a little bit different from Pilimai’s. Ena has been evaluating Hubert as a safety since the spring, but not heavily. As Hubert tells it, that intensity changed in September, as he saw a big increase in communication via mail and Twitter direct messages.\nThe big reason: the Ute coaching staff saw tape of Hubert as a wide receiver and decided to switch approach. Last week, wide receivers coach Taylor Stubblefield contacted Hubert and told him he would be in the Las Vegas area and wanted to come visit him at practice. What’s more, Stubblefield told Hubert he’d offer him a scholarship in person so long as the visit went as expected.\nIt did, Stubblefield offered, and Hubert followed through on his plan that he’d commit on the spot if in fact offered.\n“I was just stoked,” he said. “I was just filled with excitement. It was great.”\nHubert’s thoughts on Utah’s splash onto the national scene as of late?\n“I think it shows how much their coaching staff and players have worked to get where they are,” he said. “I think they deserve it.”\nLauaki did not return messages seeking comment.\nHere’s the weekly rundown of notable performances from last week by players committed to Utah, BYU and Utah State:", "external_links": ["http://deseretnews.sportsdirectinc.com/football/ncaaf-teams.aspx?page=/data/ncaaf/teams/team33.html"], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T07:13:19.642+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
