Signal photo by Dan Watson. \nSanta Clarita Christian’s Garrick Moss said the Cardinals’ 34-24 win over The Webb Schools of Claremont Saturday night at Canyon High was the biggest win in the history of the SCCS 11-man football program. \nBut why was it the biggest win for SCCS? \n“One, because it’s against an incredibly well-coached team that beat us handily last year,” Moss explained. “Two, because it’s a league game, which is massive. And three, because they’re ranked in the top 10. We’ve never beaten a top 10 team as an 11-man school.”. \nBoth SCCS and Webb came into Saturday night’s game with identical 5-1 overall records, as well as both hoisting a 1-0 San Joaquin conference record, but the Gauls are ranked No. 8 in the CIF-Southern Section East Valley Division. \nBut it wasn’t only the biggest in SCCS 11-man history because of those reasons. \nThe Cardinals had to overcome an early 14-0 deficit and SCCS quarterback Tristan Miller had to shake off three first-quarter interceptions. \nWebb’s Adrian Alvarez punched in the first score from 1-yard out and then Alvarez picked off Miller and returned it for a pick-6 late in the second quarter. \nBut Miller, who went 26-for-40 with 255 yards, three touchdowns and four interceptions, settled down. \nMiller connected with Jacob Moss on the first play of the second quarter for an 8-yard TD and then Moss quickly turned around to pick off Webb’s Wyatt Albert to give his offense the ball back. \nCaden Brenner caught Miller’s second TD pass of the night, this time from 7-yards out on a slant pass. \nThen Moss, who had 146 receiving yards on 10 catches, caught his second touchdown of the night from Miller, a 28-yard pass play, to give the Cardinals their first lead (20-17) of the night with just two minutes left in the second quarter. \nSCCS wouldn’t let the lead slip away after that. That was mostly in part of the running game, and its defense. \n“We’re winning games because our defense is holding us in the games, and our offense is doing just enough,” said Moss, whose team moves to 6-1 and remains undefeated in Heritage League play (2-0). \nThe running game was led by freshman Seth Yu who ran for 102 yards with a 55-yard touchdown up the left sideline to cap his night. \nAt just 5 feet, 7 inches and 150 pounds, Yu was running in circles all night — mainly because his quick spin move was breaking tackles all over the field. \n“Seth’s last run was the play of the game. He ran hard all game,” Moss said. “For a kid that hasn’t got a start in a varsity game and for him to do that, is just a special moment.” \nBut it was the Cardinal’s defense that kept SCCS’ offense on the field. \nSCCS was able to pick off Albert (7-for-17, 128 yards, 0 TDs) four times and forced three fumbles, including one recovery by Brenner where he nearly got in the end zone. \nLeading the Gauls Nick Jung with 114 receiving yards. Albert was able to punch in a rushing TD from 3-yards out. \n“I have a lot of respect for coach Moss and how they play,” said Webb head coach Amahl Thomas, whose team falls to 5-2 overall and 1-1 in league play. “I think if we play like this we’re going to do fine going forward. The meat of our schedule is still ahead of us, so if we can go and knock some of those teams off we’ll be alright.” \nThe Cardinals next face Capistrano Valley Christian next Saturday at Canyon High.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T10:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T11:31:55.212+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
