(AP Photo/Matt Dunham) ... more Image 12 of 12 Bills pay price for Manuel's early turnovers 1 / 12 Back to Gallery London\nEJ Manuel's second-quarter struggles proved costly for the Buffalo Bills on Sunday.\nThe Bills quarterback committed consecutive turnovers in a 7-second stretch, both returned for touchdowns in a 34-31 loss to the Jacksonville Jaguars .\nPaul Posluszny 's interception two minutes later was converted by the Jaguars into another TD that gave Jacksonville a 27-3 lead halfway through the second quarter.\nYet Manuel felt that his turnovers weren't the crucial factor in a loss that dropped the Bills to 3-4 entering their bye week.\n\"I don't think I necessarily cost the team the game,\" said Manuel, who made his second straight start in place of the injured Tyrod Taylor .\n\"I know those two plays for touchdowns they scored on hurt our team. I don't think any one play necessarily changed the game for us.\"\nManuel rallied the Bills with touchdown passes to Robert Woods and Marcus Easley , whose 58-yard touchdown with 6:33 remaining followed by LeSean McCoy 's 2-point conversion got the Bills within 27-24.\nIt was Easley's first catch of the season and third of his five-year career.\nBlake Bortles then overthrew a pass to Allen Robinson that landed in the arms of safety Corey Graham , who returned it through traffic down the right sideline for a 44-yard score to put the Bills up 31-27 with 5:21 remaining.\nThe Bills' defense appeared to stop the Jaguars' next possession at midfield as Bortles' pass on third-and-15 to Bryan Walters sailed high and wide. But cornerback Nickell Robey was called for interference, giving the Jaguars a first down at the Bills 36.\nRobey described the pass interference ruling as the worst call he'd ever experienced.\n\"I don't see where the contact was made. I didn't even press him. I'm going to the ball with my hands out,\" Robey said.\nBortles delivered the winning pass two plays later in the first NFL game to be streamed live on Yahoo.\nRolling right to evade the rush on second-and-5 from the Bills 31, Bortles looked to have enough running room to get the first down. Instead, he threw the ball deep to Allen Hurns , who caught the game-winner with a leaping grab near the left pylon.\n\"Obviously it is an extremely painful loss,\" Bills coach Rex Ryan said. \"To have the courage to battle back the way we did, battle all the way back, then to give it up at the end (was) a devastating loss to say the least. ... It just kills you right now.\"\nManuel started to put the Bills in a hole by failing to detect a cornerback blitz from Aaron Colvin , who jarred the ball loose as Manuel was about to throw. Chris Clemons scooped up the fumble for a 6-yard touchdown that puts the Jags up 14-3.\nOn his next play, Manuel failed to see linebacker Telvin Smith sliding back into zone coverage and tossed a pass intended for Woods. Smith ran 26 yards for the score.\nOn the next series, Posluszny stepped in front of a pass intended for Chris Hogan , setting up a short Jaguars drive capped by T.J. Yeldon's 28-yard touchdown run that put the Jags up 27-3 when kicker Jason Myers missed the extra point.\nManuel wasn't the only culprit on offense. McCoy, who gained 68 yards on 18 carries, took a dump-off pass 25 yards to the Jags' 1-yard line — but as McCoy spun away from one tackler, safety Johnathan Cyprien put his helmet into the ball and jarred it loose for a turnover that kept the Jaguars ahead 27-16.\nRyan said he never considered benching Manuel for third-string quarterback Josh Johnson .\n\"I thought he needed a chance to rebound. I thought he did,\" Ryan said.\nRyan said the Bills play-calling on offense was handicapped by technical difficulties with the coaches' electronic communications with Manuel, who frequently had to run to the sideline to get the play call.\nThe Bills enter their bye week hoping for rapid recoveries for Taylor, starting wide receivers Sammy Watkins and Percy Harvin, and right tackle Seantrel Henderson . Ryan said his team was committed to winning out the rest of the way and climbing back into contention in the AFC East.", "external_links": ["http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/60/71/8851045/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/60/71/8851048/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/60/71/8851046/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/60/71/8851047/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/60/71/8851041/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/60/71/8851040/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/60/71/8851041/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/60/71/8851049/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/60/71/8851039/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/60/71/8851043/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/60/71/8851039/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/60/71/8851048/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/60/71/8851044/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/60/71/8851049/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/60/71/8851042/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/60/71/8851046/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/60/71/8851040/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/60/71/8851047/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/60/71/8851043/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/60/71/8851042/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/60/71/8851045/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/60/71/8851044/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-26T06:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T07:32:31.665+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
