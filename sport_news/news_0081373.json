Thousands of Confederate soldiers died during the war.”\nThe Confederate battle flag did not fly over the Greene County courthouse during the civil war because the area was strongly tied to the Union and opposed secession. So strong was anti-Confederate sentiment, the secessionist government designated the area an “enemy territory”.\nIn Tennessee’s Ordinance of Secession referendum, which was confirmed on 8 June 1861, Greene County citizens voted against secession by a vote 2,691 to 733. Tennessee seceded in 1861, but Union sentiment remained strong throughout the eastern part of the state, including Greene County.\nDebate over the Confederate flag resurged this summer after nine black churchgoers were killed in Charleston by a man who decorated declarations of his white supremacist views with the battle flag. In the wake of the shooting, the banner became a fixed point of outrage over its connections to racist groups, and the South Carolina legislature lowered the flag from its statehouse in July.\nRandolph’s resolution reads:\n“Greene County Commission and the citizens they represent are proud to be Americans, but they are also proud to be Tennesseans and whereas, Greene County is conscious of its Heritage and loyalties; one that transcends the usual ties of national patriotism and state pride.\nOur citizens retain habits that are strong and memories that are long. Our region and its citizens have been powerfully shaped by its history and are determined to pass that history on to future generations and where as, the Confederate flag represents state rights, the south, it represents Dixie land, our culture, and our heritage and should be proudly displayed by our County.”\nBut this is not really so, said Richard Hood, a Greene County resident and retired history professor. Hood denounced the proposal in a lengthy letter published in the Greeneville Sun that documents the county’s clear Unionist history.\n“[Randolph’s] appeal to our ‘history’ and ‘heritage’ is appallingly off-base,” Hood wrote.\nHood illustrated many points that reveal Greene County was “profoundly anti-Confederate”. For one, at an 1861 convention in Greeneville, citizens attempted to separate from the seceded state of Tennessee and stay in the Union. For another, Andrew Johnson, who succeeded Abraham Lincoln as president in 1865, was from Greene County and was the only southern member of the House or Senate to remain in Congress during the war.\n“Commissioner Randolph may not like this history, but it has the virtue of being factual. He should be celebrating Greene County’s heritage of resistance to the Confederacy, not propping up a grotesque distortion of ‘history’ that debases our true past and offends many, many of our own neighbors,” Hood wrote.\nMeanwhile, nearly 50 people plan on attending a demonstration outside the Greene County courthouse on Monday evening to protest the raising of the controversial banner. Organized by resident Donnie Barnett, the protesters back Hood’s historical account of Greene County.\nThey also protest that taxpayers have to support the flag being flown on government property.\n“We support every citizen’s’ right to display any symbol on PRIVATE property,” reads the protest’s Facebook event photo.", "external_links": ["http://www.greenevillesun.com/opinion/letters_to_editor/writer-greene-county-was-very-strongly-anti-confederacy/article_0c04ebc0-9bbd-5f8f-ada5-9e397c4d437d.html", "http://wjhl.com/2015/10/18/greene-county-resident-plans-protest-against-confederate-flag-resolution/"], "published": "2015-10-20T06:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T00:52:03.263+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
