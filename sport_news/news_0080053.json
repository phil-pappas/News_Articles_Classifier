(Photo: Bryan Mitchell, Special to Detroit News) \nFarmington Hills — John Herrington is pleasantly surprised by Farmington Hills Harrison’s 5-1 record heading into the final third of the regular season, noticing that talk of a possible school closure following this year has not been a distraction to the Hawks.\nHerrington was busy at work Tuesday evening while preparing the Hawks during practice ... and enjoying every minute of it.\nHarrison can clinch the Oakland Activities Association White Division title and a state playoff spot with a win Friday night at Farmington High. The Hawks are 5-0 in league play, owning a one-game lead on Southfield and two-game edge on Farmington (4-2, 3-2).\nHerrington said Harrison lost a pair of standout junior players due to transfers just weeks before the start of practice, including receiver Tyrone Lyte. Still, the Hawks have responded with passionate play, winning five straight, including a 17-14 win over Southfield, after a 35-28 loss to East Kentwood in the opener.\n“The kids are playing hard and getting the job done,” said the 74-year-old Herrington, who has a career record of 417-98-1 and a state-record 13 state championships, one or more in each of the last four decades. “If we beat Farmington we’re league champs and we’ll play (No. 3 ranked) West Bloomfield in the crossover game and you can’t get better than that.\n“Khalid (Kareem) is doing a fantastic job and (Jared) Char’s doing a good job as a tailback and linebacker and little Gio (Anthony Giovanni) the quarterback is doing enough. I knew we had some talent, but we had to replace a lot of guys (from last year’s state semifinals) and then lost a couple to transfer.\n“We’ve had all the talk about the school closing and everything, the elephant in the room as they say, but it’s been good. The defense is playing really well, the kicking game is good and the offense is still a work in progress.”\nHarrison’s defense was never better than in Friday’s 21-0 win over Rochester Adams — the Hawks’ second shutout of the season — getting 12 sacks while limiting Adams to 155 total yards. Kareem, the Alabama-bound defensive end, had 11 tackles, three tackles for loss, including a pair of sacks. Char and fellow junior linebackers Matthew Hays also played well.\n“We’re having a terrific season right now,” said the 6-foot-4, 255-pound Kareem, who has 13 sacks. “We learned after that loss (to East Kentwood) we had to work hard and stay with it, can’t turn the ball over or have penalties. I think we’ve only had one penalty throughout three games and that’s been the real key.\n“Our defense has been playing great, our front seven and DBs have been fantastic. We swarm to the ball every time that I rush and when the quarterback steps in the pocket someone’s right there for him.”\nSenior receiver/cornerback Jamison Scarber has played well in the absence of Lyte, scoring on a 24-yard run against Adams, getting an interception late to secure the win over Southfield and scoring three touchdowns in the loss to East Kentwood. Tommy Williams, who was the long snapper last year, caught touchdown passes of 35 and 22 yards against Oak Park as a tight end/receiver.\nGiovanni has completed the key pass when needed and Char has run well all season.\nSenior Alex Bolstrum kicked a 27-yard field goal for the difference against Southfield and kicked a 30-yarder against Oak Park. Punter David Vinsky has helped the Hawks win the battle of field position.\nHays worries if Harrison will still be around for him to graduate, but he is focused on this season and takes pride in the Hawks’ defense.\n“I think it took a toll on us, but our main focus has been to win out this season and then whatever happens I guess we’ll have to go with it,” Hays said of the school closure talk. “It would be pretty hard for us as underclassmen to hear that the school is going to be closing because that takes away a long tradition that we’ve had with all the winning and state championships.\n“It’s fun, especially when you go out in public and you’re wearing a Harrison football shirt, people come up to you just because of that, wanting to talk about the program and Coach Herrington. It’s fun to play for him. He runs a great program.”\nHerrington feels the school will close in a few years, not after this. A meeting on the subject will be held next month.\n“I worry about it all the time, but we’re pretty sure that it will be a soft close if they close it,” Herrington explained. “That means they won’t close us next year, maybe in three years. They may not have freshmen come in and phase it out. Then, we may have three years. I think that absolutely would be the right way of doing it so the kids who are here could graduate here.”\ndavid.goricki@detroitnews.com \ntwitter.com/DavidGoricki", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-07T21:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T08:46:17.861+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
