And if some of the younger kids see that I made it, hopefully they'll realize they can do it, too. It shows that it's possible.\" \nSauer comes from an athletic background. Her father Craig was a standout athlete at Sartell High School, who went on to play football at the University of Minnesota and in the NFL. \nAnd her mother Shari was a standout athlete at Rocori. \n\"My Dad does a really good job of keeping me motivated,\" Sauer said. \"I think I inherited my killer instinct from him. And my Mom really keeps me grounded. They've both been super-supportive.\" \nSauer knows she has her work cut out for her at state. Lambert, her first-round opponent, placed fourth a year ago. And half of the 16 players in singles competition were at the state tournament last season. \n\"Playing the No. 2 seed right away is tough, but I never want to back down from a challenge,\" Sauer said. \"It won't be easy, but nothing ever is. \n\"My goal is to come away happy with how I played. Being the first player from Rocori to get there is a big honor. And I want to represent our team the best I possibly can.\" \nSauer is joined in the Class 2A singles field by St. Cloud Tech seventh-grader Ashley Tarrolly, who became the youngest athlete in Tech's history to win the Section 8-2A singles title. \nShe brings a record of 31-1 into her match against Rochester John Marshall junior Julia Geske in the first round at 8 a.m. Thursday. \n\"I think she's going to be excited about every ball she hits down there,\" Tigers coach Paul Bates said. \"She's just going to enjoy the moment.\" \nTarrolly's older sisters Taylor (a junior) and Katelyn (a sophomore) will represent Tech in the Class 2A doubles field. They take on the duo of Stillwater senior Shelby Anderson and junior Savannah Johnson in the first round at 10 a.m. Thursday. \nBefore that, though, the Tigers play in the Class 2A team quarterfinals against No. 2 seed Edina at noon Tuesday at Baseline. \nThe Hornets are seeking their 19th consecutive state title. Their run of 18 titles from 1997 through last season is a national record. \n\"It's a rare occasion for them to be the No. 2 seed,\" Bates said. \"They're always No. 1 (this year, the top seed went to Prior Lake). I think a lot of people predicted they might not be as strong this year as in the past. But they've improved as the season has gone along and they've been playing really well here at the end. \n\"We know we're in for a big challenge.\" \nIn Class A, Foley faces St. James in the team quarterfinals at noon Tuesday at the Reed-Sweat Family Tennis Center in Minneapolis. \nSt. James placed fourth at state a year ago. Foley is making its first state tournament appearance since 2013, a season in which the Falcons were defeated 4-3 by St. James in the quarterfinals. \nThe Foley team of juniors Kayla McIver and Kylee Funk take on St. Peter junior Kelli Hanson and sophomore Josie Carlson in the first round of Class A doubles play at 10 a.m. Thursday. McIver and Funk lost in the quarterfinals last season. \nAnd Melrose senior Elisha Engelmeyer draws No. 2-seeded Blake eighth-grader Arlina Shen in the first round of singles play at 8 a.m. Thursday. \nFollow Frank Rajkowski on Twitter at @rajko1973 or like him on Facebook at www.facebook.com/sctimesfrank .
