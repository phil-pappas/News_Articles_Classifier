The 2-point conversion, brought the score to 8-0 with 16.3 seconds left in the first quarter. \nThe Eagles came back and put together an 11 play, 58-yard drive that was capped off by an 8-yard quarterback keeper by Gordon for a touchdown. \nThe extra point made it 8-7 in favor of the Cardinals. \nNeither team could get anything going for much of the second quarter until Vilonia put together an eight-play drive that focused primarily on Gordon and his ability to pass and run the ball. He threw a 4-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Tripp Reed with 1:50 left on the clock, giving the Eagles their first lead of the game. \nRunning back Cody Mitchell followed up the touchdown pass with a TWO-point conversion, bringing the score to 15-8. \nAn 82-yard return by Farmington wide receiver Trenton McChristian on the ensuing kickoff allowed the Cardinals to start their drive at the Vilonia 8. \nThe Eagles defense stepped up in a big way and stopped Farmington from scoring on a halfback pass, ending the first half. \nIn the third quarter, the Cardinals fought back with a 6-yard rushing touchdown by Hobbs, bringing Farmington within one after a failed two-point conversion. \nThe scoring concluded in the third quarter with the 38-yard pass from Gordon to Norman. \nWaggle was intercepted a three times late in the game, making it four interceptions on the night. \nOne of the interceptions was thrown in the end zone, where Norman r1eturned the pick 28 yards. \nIt was the first of two interceptions for Norman and cornerback Gage Johnston also had two interceptions. \n“We won by two points, so anytime we get interceptions is big, and hopefully, offensively we can capitalize on it,” Stout said. \nVilonia travels to Harrison on Friday to play the Golden Goblins with playoff hopes hanging in the balance.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T04:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T06:54:13.250+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
