The Hokies can’t afford another loss if they are to have any hope of getting back into the mix for the divisional title and ACC title game berth. \nKEY MATCHUP \nVirginia Tech QB Michael Brewer vs the Duke defense. The Blue Devils rank fourth nationally in overall defense and second nationally against the pass. Brewer will be making his first start since he broke his collarbone in the season opener against Ohio State, and will have to be sharp from the start for the Hokies to do damage. \nPLAYERS TO WATCH \nDuke: QB Thomas Sirk leads the Blue Devils in rushing and passing, and has completed better than 62 percent of his throws with seven touchdowns and just three interceptions. Of greater concern might be his 321 rushing yards because running quarterbacks have given the Hokies fits so far this season. \nVirginia Tech: TE Bucky Hodges is 6-foot-6 and athletic, but has been minimized in the Hokies passing game this season. Through seven games, he’s caught just 16 passes for 248 yards and two touchdowns. Look for Brewer to try to get Hodges more involved, especially with the Hokies very thin at wide receiver. \nFACTS & FIGURES \nDuke is 22-4 in its last 26 regular season games. Only Florida State (26), Ohio State (25), and Baylor, Michigan State and Alabama (24) have won more in that time. … The Blue Devils also have won five straight and 11 of their last 12 road games, including a 13-10 victory at Lane Stadium in 2013. … The Hokies have lost three of their last four games this season, but have won 13 of their last 14 meetings with Duke. … Virginia Tech is tied for third in the ACC with 15 sacks. The Blue Devils have allowed an ACC-low four sacks. \nCopyright © 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T18:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T20:05:03.551+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
