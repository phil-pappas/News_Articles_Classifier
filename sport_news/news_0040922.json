The music played, the pastor preached and the donation basket was passed. But it was anything but a typical Sunday.\nThe church took a collection for Kenneth Felber, who works as a pizza delivery man. He's not among the church's 140 members, so what happened when he walked in with a stack of pizzas caught him by surprise.\n\"Here's our pizza, guys,\" pastor Dan Krause said as video captured Felber walking into the church's service. \"Come on up. So, this is the strangest pizza delivery you've ever made, I'm sure.\"\nKrause said he talked to the pizza store's manager who told him Felber was a good employee who has medical problems and financial hardships. Then he asked Felber a question that he didn't expect.\n\"What's the best tip you've ever gotten for delivering pizza?\" Krause asked.\nFelber said it was $100 and Krause said he could do better than that.\n\"How does a tip of $1,900 sound?\" Krause said.\n\"Oh, heck no,\" Felber said.\n\"Oh, heck yes,\" Krause said.\nThe congregation was hoping to raise $1,000 but was able to almost double that amount, giving Felber, 53, the biggest tip by far of his 14 years of pizza delivery. Felber had a smile so big even his bushy mustache couldn't hide it.\n\"They just said take these four pizzas to Begich Middle School, so I did that,\" Felber said. \"As I walked in, the whole crowd jumped up and started clapping. I'm just going to be glowing the rest of the day, the rest of the week.\"\nCopyright 2015 KTUU via CNN.
