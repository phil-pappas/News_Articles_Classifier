The bike was working really well and we did a good job throughout the whole weekend.\n\"For sure, we fly very happy from this race.\"\nRossi, 36, a seven-time world champion in the premier class, battled to the end in his record-equalling 328th GP to make his 16th podium on his 19th trip to Australia.\nBut the Italian legend was edged out for third spot by the greater speed on the straight of Iannone's Ducati.\n\"I had a good pace and good speed during the race, so arriving in fourth place is a pity, but it was still a good race,\" Rossi said.\n\"We already said that race results was going to be important 10 rounds ago, but now it's really important and it will be very tough until the last race.\"\nIt was Marquez's first premier class win at Phillip Island after two years of frustration.\nLast year Marquez crashed out on the 19th lap while leading off the pole. In the 2013 race he was disqualified after ignoring a mandatory pit stop in the middle stages of the race.\nLast month Marquez broke his left hand and has been steadily working his way back to full fitness, but his chance to successfully defend his world crown is gone.\nHe trails Rossi by 74 points with just two races or a maximum of 50 points left in the season.\n\"My plan on the last two laps was to try to push a little bit more ... but it was difficult to manage and honestly I didn't believe that I would get to Jorge,\" Marquez said.\n\"But I pushed 100 percent on the last lap and in the end it is a great win for me, for Honda.\n\"After a difficult season it's always great to (finish) on top.\" Stay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device.", "external_links": ["https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.toi.reader.activities"], "published": "2015-10-19T21:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T23:32:27.267+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
