Haden said Sunday it was \"clear to me that he was not healthy.\"\nA player told ESPN via text that Sarkisian \"showed up lit to meetings again today.\" Another source said he showed up Sunday morning and \"appeared not normal,\" and then was told to leave.\n\"They wouldn't let him come to practice,\" the source said.\nSarkisian is going through a divorce. His behavior while apparently under the influence of alcohol and painkillers at the Salute to Troy function in August drew national headlines, and he later apologized. He also added then that he would be getting unspecified treatment, but didn't believe he had a drinking problem, blaming his unsteady appearance on combining alcohol and medication.\nSarkisian was also suspected by his staff to be under the influence during USC's 42-14 win over Arizona State on Sept. 26, a source said, though Haden was apparently unaware.\nAnother source who is close to Sarkisian said the coach \"needed to hit rock-bottom\" to seriously confront an addiction and added that \"this is rock-bottom.\"\nSarkisian, a former BYU quarterback who played in the CFL, was an assistant under Pete Carroll on the Trojans' great teams of the previous decade. Coaching alongside Lane Kiffin, Sarkisian ran USC's offense before getting hired by the University of Washington to take over a winless program in 2009.\nCarroll, now the coach of the NFL's Seattle Seahawks , told 710 ESPN Seattle on Monday that Sarkisian's situation \"breaks my heart.\" Carroll also said that he has reached out to Sarkisian.\n\"But he recognizes it and he's going to do something about it, so this is the day the turn occurs. I'm grateful for everybody around him that he's finally figured it out. ... This is going to take a long time. This is big battle and we'll pull for him all the way,\" Carroll said prior to news of Sarkisian's firing.\nSarkisian went 9-4 in his first season at USC and compiled the nation's consensus top recruiting class heading in to this season. However, after rising to as high as No. 6 in the AP Top 25 this season, the Trojans (3-2, 1-2 Pac-12) have lost two of their last three games and are unranked.\nUSC enters a tough stretch with games against No. 14 Notre Dame , No. 4 Utah and No. 23 Cal over the next three weeks.\nESPN's Shelley Smith, Brett McMurphy, Joe Schad and Garry Paskwietz contributed to this report.\n \"\nSteve Sarkisian fired by USC ", "external_links": ["http://media.video-cdn.espn.com/motion/2015/1012/dm_151012_nfl_adickes_on_jamaal_charles_acl857/dm_151012_nfl_adickes_on_jamaal_charles_acl857_default.jpg", "https://s.abcnews.com/assets/js/merlin-core.js?v=2", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fabcnews.go.com%2FSports%2Fsteve-sarkisian-fired-usc%2Fstory%3Fid%3D34427708", "http://a.abcnews.com/assets/beta/js/abcn.js?v=47", "http://media.video-cdn.espn.com/motion/2015/1012/dm_151012_mlb_cora_utley_appeal_wont_beheard/dm_151012_mlb_cora_utley_appeal_wont_beheard_default.jpg", "http://media.video-cdn.espn.com/motion/2015/1012/dm_151012_ncf_haden_presser_on_sark/dm_151012_ncf_haden_presser_on_sark_default.jpg", "http://abcnewsplayer-a.akamaihd.net/player/2.24.0.0000/amp.premier/amp.premier.min.js?v=2", "http://a.abcnews.com/assets/beta/js/custom/pages/trident_story.js?v=47", "http://a.abcnews.com/assets/js/s_code_15.js?v=4", "https://s.abcnews.com/assets/js/merlin-ext.js?v=2", "http://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Steve+Sarkisian+fired+by+USC+-+ABC+News+-+http%3A%2F%2Fabcnews.go.com%2FSports%2Fsteve-sarkisian-fired-usc%2Fstory%3Fid%3D34427708&via=ABC", "http://api.addthis.com/oexchange/0.8/forward/email/offer?url=http://abcnews.go.com/Sports/steve-sarkisian-fired-usc/story?id=34427708&title=Steve+Sarkisian+fired+by+USC", "http://media.video-cdn.espn.com/motion/2015/1012/dm_151012_nfl_schefter_ray_rice_chiefs/dm_151012_nfl_schefter_ray_rice_chiefs_default.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T01:15:24.694+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
