Bengals come all the way back 1 / 2 Back to Gallery Cincinnati\nAndy Dalton led the Bengals from a 17-point fourth-quarter deficit to a 27-24 overtime victory on Sunday over the Seattle Seahawks, keeping Cincinnati undefeated with the second-biggest comeback in its history.\nTrailing 24-7 as the fourth quarter started, Dalton threw for a touchdown, ran for another and led the Bengals on a 69-yard drive without a timeout. Mike Nugent tied it with a 31-yard field goal on the final play of regulation.\nNugent was good again from 42 yards with 3:36 left in overtime, the ball deflecting off the left upright before going through. It matched the second-biggest comeback in Cincinnati's history when trailing in the fourth quarter.\nThe Bengals are 5-0 for the first time since 1988, the last time they went to the Super Bowl.\nSeattle (2-3) punted twice in overtime, giving the Bengals a chance to pull it out.\nFalcons 25, Redskins 19 (OT): Robert Alford returned an interception 59 yards for a touchdown, keeping the Falcons unbeaten. The Redskins had the first possession of OT, and Kirk Cousins moved the team to midfield. When wide receiver Ryan Grant slipped on a pass route, Alford caught Cousins' pass and was left with open field down the Falcons' sideline for the touchdown. Devonta Freeman's apparent 13-yard TD catch in the final minute of regulation was ruled incomplete on a review. Freeman scored on six-yard run two plays later to give Atlanta a 19-16 lead. Dustin Hopkins' 52-yard field goal on the final play of regulation forced overtime. The Falcons (5-0) overcame two interceptions and a lost fumble by Matt Ryan. Freeman had 27 carries for 153 yards and the touchdown.\nBrowns 33, Ravens 30 (OT): Travis Coons kicked a 32-yard field goal in overtime and Josh McCown threw for a team-record 457 yards. Cleveland (2-3) had lost 13 of the previous 14 meetings between these AFC North foes, but in this one the Browns rallied from a 12-point deficit to leave the Ravens (1-4) alone in the division cellar. Playing its second straight overtime game, Baltimore went three-and-out on the first possession of the extra session. McCown then used more than seven minutes to move the Browns 51 yards before Coons kicked his fourth field goal with 6:43 left in OT. McCown completed 36 of 51 passes with two touchdowns in becoming the first quarterback in Browns history with three straight 300-yard games. He broke the team record of 444 yards passing set by Brian Sipe on Oct. 25, 1981, against the Baltimore Colts.\nPackers 24, Rams 10: Aaron Rodgers threw for two touchdowns and 241 yards, but his impressive string of not being intercepted at Lambeau Field ended. Rodgers was 19 of 30 for 241 yards with long scoring strikes to receivers Ty Montgomery and James Jones. But NFL-record streaks of 587 pass attempts and 49 touchdown passes at home without an interception for Rodgers ended in the first quarter on linebacker James Laurinaitis' diving pick of a tipped ball for the Rams (2-3). Rodgers threw another interception in the second quarter before losing a fumble in the third. Relentless pressure on quarterback Nick Foles helped keep the Packers (5-0) unbeaten. Foles threw a career-worst four interceptions, two in the fourth quarter inside the Packers' 10.\nBroncos 16, Raiders 10: Chris Harris Jr. returned a fourth-quarter interception 74 yards for a touchdown and the Broncos overcame a shaky day from Peyton Manning. Manning was intercepted twice by 1998 draft classmate Charles Woodson and failed to lead the Broncos (5-0) to an offensive touchdown for the second time in five games this season. But Denver's defense made sure it didn't matter, getting a third defensive touchdown of 2015. Derek Carr threw for 249 yards and one touchdown for the Raiders (2-3), but was done in by the interception midway through the fourth quarter with Oakland in position for a possible go-ahead field goal.\nCardinals 42, Lions 17: Carson Palmer threw for three touchdowns, while Matthew Stafford was benched after throwing a third interception. The Cardinals (4-1) have a two-game lead in the NFC West. The Lions (0-5) have the dubious distinction of being the NFL's only winless team and are off to their worst start since becoming the league's only 0-16 team in 2008.\nBears 18, Chiefs 17: Jay Cutler led the Bears to a pair of fourth-quarter touchdowns, the second an alert toss to Matt Forte with 18 seconds left. Kansas City lost star running back Jamaal Charles to a potentially season-ending right knee injury. Chicago (2-3) trailed 17-3 early in the third quarter when Charles went down while trying to make a cut. The preliminary diagnosis was a torn ACL and Charles will have an MRI exam Monday. The Bears quickly seized the momentum. After Robbie Gould's second field goal got them going, Cutler led an 88-yard drive that he capped with a 22-yard strike to Marquess Wilson with 3:05 left. The two-point conversion came up short, but the Bears defense responded by forcing a quick three-and-out. With help from a pass interference call on Chiefs rookie Marcus Peters, the Bears quickly moved downfield. That's when Cutler took a snap from the shotgun, dropped the ball, picked it up and spotted Forte running past safety Husain Abdullah in the end zone for the go-ahead score.\nEagles 39, Saints 17: Sam Bradford overcame two red-zone interceptions and threw for 333 yards and two touchdowns, and Fletcher Cox forced two fumbles on sacks. Ryan Mathews and DeMarco Murray each rushed for touchdowns to help the Eagles (2-3) break out of their offensive slump. They snapped a three-game losing streak at home that dated to last season.\nBuccaneers 38, Jaguars 31: Doug Martin ran for 123 yards and scored three touchdowns, helping Jameis Winston rebound from his worst pro performance. The Bucs (2-3) snapped an 11-game home losing streak that dated to December 2013, the same month the Jaguars (1-4) began an equally agonizing road skid that now stands at 12. Winston threw for 209 yards and one touchdown without an interception, redeeming himself after turning the ball over five times in a 14-point loss to Carolina last week.", "external_links": ["http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/36/42/8775823/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/36/42/8775823/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/36/42/8775824/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/36/42/8775824/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-12T07:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T17:12:56.683+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
