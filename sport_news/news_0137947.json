Won Presidents' Trophy, Metropolitan Division. Lost to Tampa Bay Lightning in Eastern Conference finals.\nCOACH: Alain Vigneault, 14 NHL seasons, 520-341-35-74.\nADDED: RW Emerson Etem, G Antti Raanta, LW Viktor Stalberg, C Jarret Stoll, D Raphael Diaz, C Brian Gibbons, C Jayson Megna, C Matt Linblad, C Luke Adam.\nLOST: LW Carl Hagelin, G Cam Talbot, RW Martin St. Louis, D Matt Hunwick, C Chris Mueller, C James Sheppard.\nPLAYER TO WATCH: Chris Kreider. The 24-year-old left wing is coming off a career-high, 21-goal season and the Rangers' hierarchy believes he is capable of becoming one of the NHL's elite players. He has size, speed and the toughness to take a major step this season and join Rich Nash as a major contributor on offense.\nOUTLOOK: The Rangers have been close the past two seasons and many wonder whether they missed their chance to win their first Stanley Cup since 1994. Jeff Gorton replaced Glen Sather as the general manager in the offseason and didn't make any major moves, other than keeping young core players Derek Stepan, J.T. Miller and Jesper Fast. If goalkeeper Henrik Lundqvist has another 30-win season, Nash (42 goals) is among the league leaders and a veteran defense delivers led by Ryan McDonagh stays healthy, New York will get one more shot at a title.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
