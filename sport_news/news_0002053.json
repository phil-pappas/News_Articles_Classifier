Already hosting its second NCAA Division I Men’s Ice Hockey Midwest Regional Championship in three years in March, the NCAA has handed Miami and U.S. Bank Arena the honor again for the 2017 NCAA Tournament. The NCAA Division I Men’s Ice Hockey Committee announced all four regional sites, which will run March 24-26. “We are extremely honored to be chosen to host the 2017 NCAA Midwest Regional for the third time in four years,” Associate Athletic Director/Chief Operations Officer Keanah Smith said. “Thanks to the NCAA Division I Men's Ice Hockey Committee and Staff for allowing us to continue to bring premiere college hockey events to the city of Cincinnati. Miami University and U.S. Bank Arena have a proud hockey tradition and will work to ensure an extraordinary experience for the student-athletes and fans.” U.S. Bank Arena serves as home to the ECHL’s Cincinnati Cyclones. In addition to hosting the 2014 NCAA Midwest Regional Championship, the rink has also hosted the 1996 Frozen Four. “It is truly an honor to once again be chosen as the host of the Men’s Ice Hockey Midwest Regionals” said U.S. Bank Arena Vice President and General Manager Kristin Ropp. “This selection only reinforces that Cincinnati is a growing hockey market. We are thankful for the hard work of our partners, Miami University, the Greater Cincinnati Sports Corp and the Cincinnati Convention and Visitors Bureau, in helping us to secure this championship. This bid partnership created in 2013, proves that regional collaboration drives winning event bids. We look forward to hosting this showcase event this March and again in 2017.” The other three regional sites are Scheels Arena in Fargo, N.D., the Verizon Center in Manchester, N.H. and the Dunkin’ Donuts Center in Providence, R.I., where the Miami hockey team competed in the 2015 NCAA East Regional. The 2017 Frozen Four will take place in the United Center in Chicago. \"Hosting three regionals in four years is quite the honor,\" Miami head hockey coach Enrico Blasi said. “In 2014, fans were treated to an amazing weekend and got to see what postseason college hockey is all about. The atmosphere in the rink was electric and I think the success of that weekend has made Cincinnati a go-to location for postseason college hockey in the eyes of the NCAA. For the next two years, fans will get to see what makes both our sport and Southwest Ohio great.\" As host of both the 2016 and 2017 NCAA Midwest Regional Championship, the RedHawks will automatically be playing their postseason games in U.S. Bank Arena should they make the NCAA Tournament, which they have done nine times in the past 10 seasons. Miami takes on Western Ontario in an exhibition at Steve ‘Coach’ Cady Arena on Saturday at 4 p.m. The 2015-16 regular season starts when the RedHawks host defending national champion Providence for a weekend series Oct. 9-10.
