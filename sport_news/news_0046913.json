A native of West Memphis, he ran cross country and track in high school, winning the state cross country championship as a junior.\nHe earned a track scholarship to Baylor before transferring to Ouachita Baptist, where he earned NAIA all-American honors as a marathoner.\nHeading into the season, Simmons' girls teams had won the region championship in five of the last eight years while placing third in the state in 2005. Collierville's boys won the region title in 2014 after a string of runner-up finishes.\nThe school's Facebook post said grief counselors would be at the school when students return from fall break next week.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T02:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T11:32:24.478+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
