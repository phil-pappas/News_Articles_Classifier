They will also face ethics checks. \nFIFA will elect a new president on Feb. 26 following Blatter's decision in June to step down amid corruption probes into the world soccer body by American and Swiss investigators. \nBlatter and Platini, who was previously the favorite to win the election, have both been provisionally suspended for 90 days over a payment of 2 million Swiss francs (about $2 million) Blatter made to Platini in 2011. \nThat could ruin Platini's chances of standing for president. \nIf Sexwale is backed as the preferred candidate for the whole African continent, that could put him in a strong position. Africa is FIFA's largest continental confederation with 54 voting national associations. Another possible African candidate, Liberian FA president Musa Bility, failed to gain the backing of the rest of Africa. \nAs well as working on FIFA's anti-discrimination committee, Sexwale has mediated for FIFA in the dispute between the Israeli and Palestinian soccer federations, a diplomacy mission given to him by outgoing president Blatter. He also served on the organizing committee for South Africa's 2010 World Cup. \nSexwale holds strong political credentials. He was imprisoned on the notorious Robben Island off Cape Town for 13 years, some of them alongside Mandela, for fighting against apartheid, South Africa's system of white minority rule. He became a close confidante of Mandela, the anti-apartheid leader and Nobel Peace Prize winner who died in 2013. \nReleased from prison in 1990, Sexwale served as a cabinet minister after South Africa's shift to democracy and at one time held ambitions of becoming South African president. \nHis wealth has often been a story of interest for the South African media, which reported in 2013 that Sexwale had bought his own personal tropical island in the Indian Ocean for $70 million. \nAP Sports Writer Rob Harris contributed to this report. \nGerald Imray is on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/GeraldImrayAP \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T22:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T22:46:48.380+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
