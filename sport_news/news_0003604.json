The game will be broadcast on ESPN.\nThe main stage for GameDay will be near North University Street between the Kraus and chemistry buildings. From the release:\n“Fans are encouraged to make creative signs for a competition sponsored by Pizza Hut and there will be a sign painting station provided by Home Depot. There will also be fan activities, a Coke Zero tent and a Cheez-It Real Fan of the Week presentation. The College GameDay Home Depot Bus will also be on site.”\nIt’s the second time ESPN will have a set on the Ann Arbor campus this season, following a SportsCenter broadcast in Jim Harbaugh’s home debut as coach Sept. 12 against Oregon State.
