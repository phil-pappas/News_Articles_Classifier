Abingdon-Avon rushed 60 times for 243 to overcome a two-score, first-half deficit and defeat the hosts 30-27 in a Prairieland Black Conference game Saturday at the Patriot Bowl. “We knew they were going to put the ball on the ground, we knew they were physical, we knew they were gonna control it and keep it away from our offense,” Heights coach Jon Adkins said. “They got the job done and we didn’t.” Heights (3-3, 2-2) seemed in control, after a pair of touchdown passes from Blake Begner to Jarin Wallace and a 15-yard TD run by Jalen Hughes gave the Patriots a 20-8 lead just three minutes into the second quarter. But the Tornadoes were just getting warmed up. Sophomore Hunter Darst capped a seven-play, 59-yard drive that took just three minutes with a seven-yard scoring run and two-point conversion to pull A-Town within 20-16. A successful onside kick followed, recovered by Bo Glaser, and Darst turned it into a 24-20 Tornadoes lead six plays later with 2:49 left in the half on a nine-yard blast. “That onside kick was huge,” Adkins said. A-Town (3-3, 2-2) then kept the Patriots’ offense on the sidelines by chewing up 13 of the first 18 minutes of the second half. Brett Fordyce completed a seven-and-a-half minute, 88-yard drive with a four-yard TD to make it 30-20 with 5:45 left in the fourth. The Patriots pulled within 30-27 with 2:16 left on a 14-yard scoring pass from Begner (12-for-17, 171 yards) to Quinn Miller. Shane Coleman smothered the ensuing onside kick and Abingdon-Avon was able to run out the clock. Fordyce (116) and Heath Milan (115) both went over 100 yards on the ground for an A-Town offense that completed just one of five passes. “I’m really happy with the way our line was able to get a helmet on a helmet, our backs did a good job lead blocking and our backs, when there wasn’t a hole, were able to get four or five yards and grind out a victory,” A-Town coach Rick Quinn said. Quinn credited linemen Julian Nicholson, Gage Coursey, Ethan Hecox, Sam Dechow, Ryan Sandoval as well as tight ends Dylan Klockenga and Nick Boggs. \"For us to be down 20-8 and find a way to get back into the game and take the lead and kinda control the second half and second quarter says a lot about our offense, our defense and some of our toughness,” Quinn said. “After the last two weeks we could have gone one of two ways, but we came out and fought today and that's what we need to do the next three weeks.” Page 2 of 2 - After rushing for 544 yards in the previous two games, Patriots sophomore Geno Hess was held to 97 yards on 18 attempts.
