Say this for yesterday’s showdown between No. 8 Central Catholic and No. 9 Tewksbury : It lived up to the hype and then some.\nOn a brilliant fall day in Tewksbury, the two Merrimack Valley Large heavyweights went toe-to-toe the whole way. But with their league title hopes on the line, it was the visiting Red Raiders who left Doucette Stadium with a gut-check 27-21 victory.\n“I’m not going to lie to you, this is a huge win,” said Central coach Chuck Adamopoulos. “That’s a very good team over there and if they beat us today it was going to be over, they were going to be the Large School champs.”\nLeading 21-7 at the half, Central (4-1) saw the hosts score 14 unanswered points to tie it behind the dynamic tandem of wideout Adam Gajjaoui (eight catches, 134 yards, three TDs) and quarterback Brett Morris (10-for-21, 122 yards, two TDs). With all the momentum squarely back on the Tewksbury sideline, however, Central answered the bell.\n“One of the things we always talk to the guys about is that anyone can play when things are going great, but who is going to be the guy who steps up when things are going bad,” Adamopoulos said.\nSafe to say the veteran coach saw a whole slew of players answer that call, starting with captain Omar Deschamps. The rugged 5-foot-9, 200-pound back rushed for 118 yards, 48 of which came on Central’s final scoring drive that was punctuated when sophomore quarterback Bret Edwards (13-for-22, 162 yards) scored the final TD on a keeper from 6 yards out with 10 minutes to play.\nPredictably, Tewksbury (4-1) did not go quietly. A 56-yard kickoff return by speedster Troy Carey set the hosts up deep in Red Raiders territory — only to see a fumble ended the drive. After a huge hold by the Tewksbury defense on fourth down deep in its own territory, the hosts had one more chance to drive for the win — but back-to-back sacks by Central’s Mike Mears and Pat Schena ended it.\nRunning back Rob Fitzgerald accounted for the first two Central scores, while Carey connected with Gajjaoui on a pretty option pass to get Tewksbury on the board in the first quarter. Schena gave Central a 21-7 lead at the half with a 25-yard fumble return just 48 seconds before intermission.\nIn other action yesterday:\nThe Wellesley defense only allowed 65 yards to lead the Raiders (5-0) to a 7-6 win over Walpole in the Bay State Herget, snapping 15-game losing streak in the series. Griffin Morgan hauled in a 19-yard halfback pass from Brendan Dolan in the second quarter.\nIn a Bay State Carey contest, Trevor Martinez-Tobin and Jimmy Hodgson combined to rush for 176 yards as Newton North (3-2) blanked Braintree , 10-0.\nDillon Preston ran for 110 yards and two touchdowns as St. John’s Prep (5-0) remained undefeated with a 20-8 win over Catholic Memorial in the Catholic Conference.\nSteve D’Emilia threw a pair of touchdown passes to Kyle Johnston and Bridgewater-Raynham (2-3) blocked a potential game-tying field goal attempt to preserve a 16-13 win over Dartmouth in the Old Colony League.\nNick Graham ran for three touchdowns as Mansfield (3-2) defeated Taunton , 32-14, in the Hockomock Kelley-Rex.\nDan Murphy ran for two TDs and threw for a third as Revere (4-1) forced three fumbles, blocked a punt for a touchdown and scored a safety to top Saugus , 35-6, in a Northeastern Conference South matchup.\nBrendan Chipman rushed for two scores and tossed two more as Middleboro (5-0) defeated North Quincy , 41-7, in a Patriot Fisher game.\nIn a Patriot Keenan showdown, Duxbury (4-1) built up an early 21-point lead and then hung on to defeat Plymouth North, 28-19. Ryan Reagan finished with two touchdown receptions, including a 36-yard TD catch with 43 seconds remaining to seal the game.\nMike Reale threw for one touchdown, ran for a second and returned an interception 33 yards for a third score as Cardinal Spellman (5-0) defeated Arlington Catholic , 49-15, in the Catholic Central Large.\nKeyshawn Young ran for two scores as Nantucket (5-0) defeated Old Colony , 30-0, in the Mayflower Small. . . . Matthew DeLuca caught a 41-yard TD pass from Justin Lavoie as time expired to lift West Bridgewater (5-0) over South Shore , 19-16.\nRyan Dauphnais ran for 166 yards and two scores as Barnstable (1-4) defeated Somerville , 32-22, in a nonleague contest.\nDan Ventura, Marcello Rossetti, Kevin Barrucci and Brian Roach contributed to this report.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T14:22:52.319+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
