NJ.com Eagles reporter Eliot Shorr-Parks estimated that about 40 percent of the crowd was made up of Philly fanatics:\nGoes without saying, but there are a TON of #Eagles fans here outside of the stadium. Maybe 60/40, Panthers fans.\n— Eliot Shorr-Parks (@EliotShorrParks) October 25, 2015 And you know what happens when that many fans of a road team show up for an NFL game, right? F ghts!\nCarolina fans don’t seem to be big on smartphones for whatever reason so, unfortunately, there aren’t many videos of the fights available. But a quick Twitter search reveals that they did happen. See here:\nTalking to my friend and in his section an Eagles fan tried to fight a @Panthers fan and... Panther Nation won that too lol\n— Bring Back The Buzz™ (@BringBackTheBuz) October 26, 2015 And here:\n@frankgarcia65 just saw a panther fan try to jump 4 eagles. He got jacked up and sheriff threw him out. We got fight in our fans. #drunkman\n— michael tessenar (@BarStoolSpecial) October 26, 2015 And here:\nlmfao eagles fan just got his ass whipped and arrested lmfao\n— i dont chillin (@PanthersAnon) October 26, 2015 And in this (very) short video, you can see a bunch of fans going at it in the stands at Bank of America Stadium :\nNever seen the stadium this hostile. pic.twitter.com/GmBVe480IL\n— Tyler Parr (@tylerparr1) October 26, 2015 Apparently, it wasn’t just Eagles fans fighting Panthers fans, either. The same guy who posted the clip above also pointed out that Eagles fans were fighting each other in the parking lot after the game ended:\nWalking back to car. Eagles fans are now fighting their own fans. I've seen it all.\n— Tyler Parr (@tylerparr1) October 26, 2015 Sounds like another fun night at an NFL game!\nSend all complaints, compliments, and tips to sportstips@complex.com .\n[ via Total Pro Sports ]", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/BringBackTheBuz/status/658496209951289344", "https://twitter.com/frankgarcia65", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/drunkman?src=hash", "http://www.totalprosports.com/2015/10/26/reports-of-eagles-panthers-fans-fighting-in-out-of-the-stadium-video/", "https://twitter.com/tylerparr1/status/658493852781780992", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/Eagles?src=hash", "https://t.co/GmBVe480IL", "https://twitter.com/tylerparr1/status/658498249557463041", "https://twitter.com/BarStoolSpecial/status/658493442339807236", "https://twitter.com/Panthers", "https://twitter.com/PanthersAnon/status/658487838347014144", "https://twitter.com/EliotShorrParks/status/658391349276876800"], "published": "2015-10-26T19:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T22:26:11.740+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
