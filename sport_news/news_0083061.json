No injuries were reported.\nKerjon Lee, a spokesman for Los Angeles County Public Works, said 50 field personnel and more than 30 pieces of heavy equipment were on the ground in the small mountain communities of Elizabeth Lake and Lake Hughes in Leona Valley, about 40 miles north of Los Angeles.\nHe said in that area alone, crews need to clear out 20,000 dump trucks worth of dirt, which could take months. The dirt eventually will be used to backfill eroded canyons.\nMeanwhile, Lee said at least one of the homes in the area is considered a total loss after flooding ripped it from its foundation. Crews were continuing to assess homes in the area on Saturday, and Lee said the number of those destroyed could rise.\nGary and Gina Hartle, who own a 70-acre horse ranch in Lake Hughes, said they have so much work to restore their property, they have no idea how long it will take.\n“Our property is 75 percent devastated,” Gina Hartle, 54, told The Associated Press on Saturday as she surveyed the damage. “We can’t access our homes too well right now because everything is washed out.”\nShe said the two homes on the land seemed like they were OK, but that one of the homes was without water because of an inundated pump, and their 20-foot trailer is nowhere in sight.\n“It either got buried or it’s downriver,” Hartle said.\nStill, Hartle said the couple feels lucky. Their pregnant daughter was at home during the storm and wasn’t sure she was going to survive.\n“She was scared. She knew she had to get moving because she felt she was on an island and the water was getting higher and higher,” Hartle said. “The water was up to her hips and she had to escape for her life and her unborn child’s life.”\nHartle said her daughter made it to a neighbor’s home on foot.\nTwenty miles to the east in the Mojave Desert city of Lancaster, Jennifer Dunnagan and Rochelle Price wiped away tears as they assessed the damage to their home Friday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T08:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T13:43:38.266+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
