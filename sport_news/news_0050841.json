Posted: Wednesday, October 7, 2015 9:00 am VSU's Codato, Campos earn GSC awards Staff reports Valdosta Daily Times \nSetter Jessica Codato and libero Natalia Campos both played huge roles in Valdosta State volleyball’s push toward their 12th consecutive win last week, and the efforts were rewarded on Tuesday, as the Gulf South Conference respectively named the duo the GSC Player and Defender of the Week. \nAs the central component of the Blazer offense, Codato has distributed 423 assists this season for an average of 9.84 per set. As one of the top three setters in the league statistically, the senior has helped Valdosta State rank among the top three offensive teams in the GSC with a team hitting percentage of .223. \nIn last week’s performance, Codato highlighted a .368 hitting percentage on the week with a near-perfect performance on Saturday night, in which she blasted eight kills in 10 attempts with no errors for an incredible .800 hitting percentage. The night capped off a week for Codato that included 126 assists (11.4 per set), five blocks (0.45 per set) and 48 digs (4.36). \nCampos, who during her junior season has quickly established herself as the anchor for the Blazer defense, has played in and started every game for VSU this season. Over the course of the season, she has become one of the top three defenders in the conference with a total of 221 digs and an average of 5.14 digs per set. The Lutz, Fla., native has picked up 10 or more digs in every contest this season, topping the 20-dig mark four times and eclipsing the 30-dig mark once. \nLast week Campos racked up 59 digs in total and averaged 5.36 per set. In addition, her passing skills complemented Codato well, earning Campos 15 assists to go along with two aces.
