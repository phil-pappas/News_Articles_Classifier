The sophomore had 75 yards on 14 carries against the Bulls — and didn't shine brightly enough to secure full possession of the job.\nWarren earned his third start of the season Saturday against Charlotte, and Howell was back to having a partner in crime — at least, at first.\nThe two split duties evenly through the first quarter and the start of the second, with the running backs rotating play on alternating drives.\nBut by the second half, Howell was back to the bulk of the carries for the Owls, with sophomore Marcus Clark working into the mix in place of Warren.\nEntering the game, Howell's 97 total yards through three games was good for fifth-best in Conference USA.\nTurnovers galore\nTurnovers have been the downfall for FAU in three losses this season, including five last week in a 33-15 loss to Buffalo. In all, the Owls had 10 turnovers entering Saturday's game, for a -1.67 turnover differential.\nIn Charlotte, however, they met their equal. The 49ers recorded 13 turnovers in three games before facing FAU, with a differential of -2.33 that ranked them last in C-USA.\nExtra points\nThe game at Charlotte's Jerry Richardson Stadium marked the first home night game for the 49ers, who just had lights installed at the field in the spring. … FAU also was the first FBS opponent to play at Richardson Stadium; this is Charlotte's first season competing in Conference USA.\n Florida Atlantic Owls UNC Charlotte 49ers Conference USA Buffalo Bulls", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-560740ee/turbine/fl-fau-owls-news-0927-20150926"], "published": "2015-09-27T02:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T17:46:31.620+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
