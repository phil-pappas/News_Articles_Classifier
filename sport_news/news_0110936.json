Therefore, predictions are iffy about where best to head for productive fishing.\nHowever, several captains have noted that the fall migration of fishing species is under way. And Island Curent fleet’s Capt. Chris Cullen reports that Long Island Sound has been loaded with bunker and other bait fish. So we can certainly look forward to landing porgies, bluefish, striped bass and black sea bass.\nPlus, as of this coming Monday, New York anglers can add blackfish to their search. State regs allow a daily take of four blackfish measuring at least 16 inches.\nMeanwhile, while we wait out rainy days and with a busy Columbus Day holiday coming up one week from Monday, now is a good time to mark down some of this month’s angling events on your calendar.\nFor instance, the sixth annual Star Island Striped Bass Tournament will be held Sunday, Oct. 11 at the Star Island Marina in Montauk. There’s a captain’s meeting Saturday, Oct. 10 7:30 p.m. For details, phone (631)668-5052 or email marina@starislandyc.com.\nOn Oct. 16-18, the South Shore Surf Fishing Classic will be held at Captree State Park. Cash and tackle prizes will be awarded for the three largest striped bass and the three largest bluefish, as well as for the largest released striper. This is sponsored by Long Island State Parks and The Fisherman magazine. For more info, call (631) 321-3510.\nThe annual Fall Family Fishing Festival will be held on Saturday, Oct. 17. from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. at McDonald and South Ponds in Hempstead State Park, West Hempstead, L.I.\nBesides a special Casting for Pumpkins for kids, everyone should enjoy some grand trout fishing since the lakes will be stocked with hundreds of trout. Both admission and parking are free. For details, call (631) 444-0283.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T09:26:41.292+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
