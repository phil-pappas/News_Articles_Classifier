CIMBUREK james.cimburek@yankton.net yankton.net | 0 comments \nWAGNER — When Wagner head volleyball coach Amy Tyler picked out managers for her 2008 and 2009 state championship teams, little did she know she was grooming a future varsity lineup. \nFour Red Raider starters and five varsity players overall got their start with the program as student managers, many of which were on the bench as the Red Raiders won back-to-back Class A titles. Her 2014 team had two more former managers as well. \n“You get used to seeing those kids every day,” Tyler said. “They become a part of your life.” \nOne of the job requirements for manager is a “ride home.” For senior Ali Kuca, that “ride home” was her cousin Jilanne Doom, an all-stater who went on to compete in track and field at the University of South Dakota. \n“I thought it would be fun, and I wanted to be around the girls,” said Kuca, a manager on both title teams. “I loved being around sports.” \nBesides fulfilling the managerial duties of filling water bottles and running down loose volleyballs, there was also time for practicing the sport themselves. \n“While they were practicing, if they saw Adrian (Weber) or me doing something wrong, they let us know,” Kuca said. “It helped us to be where we are at today.” \nWeber, who was a manager in 2008, noted that it wasn’t always about volleyball for the managers. \n“Ali and I used to play hide-and-seek in the locker rooms. We would get in trouble for it,” said Weber, a senior. “I don’t remember them getting after us, except the coaches for us playing in the locker room.” \nThe experience of being around one of the top programs in the state rubbed off, said sophomore Sierra Juffer. \n“I learned a lot from watching them play,” she said. “And the older girls helped during practice sometimes. \n“That’s probably why I am starting on varsity today.” \nSophomore Schylar Juffer and freshman Faith Tyler, Coach Tyler’s daughter, also experienced Red Raider volleyball as a manager before stepping onto the court as a player. Coach Tyler has seen the experience play off for her players. \n“They definitely have an advantage, being in the gym every day,” she said. “They get to know the game so much better. They step onto the floor with a lot more experience.” \nNow that they are on the court, the former managers haven’t forgotten where they started, stepping in to help the young managers as players did for them years ago. \n“We always try to make their day, help them enjoy what they are doing,” Kuca said. “And if we see them doing something wrong, we’ll nudge them and say, ‘Hey, do this.’” \nThat trend of managers becoming players is likely to continue for Wagner. This year’s managers are Lizzie Tyler, Coach Tyler’s daughter, and Madisyn Knebel, daughter of assistant coach Stacey Knebel. Lizzie will be eligible for the sixth grade program next season. \nFollow @JCimburek on Twitter", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T07:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T07:26:37.672+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
