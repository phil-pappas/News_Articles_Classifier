There was this , and this , and this , and this , and this , and a bunch of other stuff that I’m probably missing. Saturday’s Red River Showdown is probably going to be forecast as a romp for Oklahoma over Charlie Strong’s boys. But you know what, I say SCREW ALL THAT, because the Longhorns are going to kill it here. They may score less than the Sooners, they may give up more points than the Sooners, they may turn the ball over more than the Sooners, but I DON’T CARE. What I think is going to happen is the Horns are going to be up two scores in late in the fourth quarter and Oklahoma is going to be down to the Texas 30 and when Baker Mayfield drops back on third and 7 Kris Boyd is going to come in and crush him on a corner blitz, forcing a fumble for the backbreaking scoop-and-score. And then Boyd will take out his phone and tweet about it. On the field. Texas over Oklahoma \nGarry : St. Louis Rams over Green Bay Packers. The surprisingly spry Rams are representing St. Louis, a city of a little more than 300,000 but within a metropolitan area of almost 3 million. So you think a town like Green Bay, with a population of about 100,000, can take on an area that populous? Think again. The Rams will win this game by a score of 34-26. Rams over Packers \nHaenchen : Georgia Tech's option offense let me down against the Irish earlier this year. Last week, Air Force let me down. Therefore, I'm going full #AnchorsAweigh this week (Ken Niumatalolo's squad runs the option, and bulldozed the Falcons). Bon voyage to the Irish's playoff hopes. Navy over Notre Dame \nNicholson : Almost exactly 50 years ago, Ivy League rivals Princeton and Colgate collided in what has never been called a classic matchup. By game’s end, the Tigers of Princeton had tuned up Colgate by a score of 27-0. People still don’t talk about it to this day. This weekend’s matchup between the two schools might follow the same story, but will no doubt dominate the conversation at sumptuous cocktail parties on campus. In case you haven’t noticed, I’m 32-8 so far this year, which is amazing. But I’m just 1-3 in Locks of the Week, so the Princeton pick above is my way of changing things up.
