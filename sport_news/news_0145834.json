Spiller with a short pass that the running back turned into an 80-yard touchdown — the 400th of the Saints quarterback's career — on the second play of overtime, and New Orleans won for the first time this season, 26-20 over the injury-decimated Cowboys on Sunday night. \nBrees, who missed New Orleans' previous game because of a bruised rotator cuff in his right (throwing) shoulder, completed 32 of 39 throws for 279 yards in his return. \nMark Ingram gained 126 yards from scrimmage on a combination of runs and short passes, and Khiry Robinson had a 1-yard touchdown run for New Orleans (1-3). \nJoseph Randle scored the lone TD for Dallas (2-2) on a 1-yard run in the first half. The winning score enlivened a Superdome crowd stunned by Saints kicker Zach Hocker's 30-yard miss in the final seconds of regulation. \n___ \nAP NFL websites: http://pro32.ap.org and http://twitter.com/AP_NFL Copyright The Associated Press Sign up for our WHIO-TV Daily Headlines Newsletter Sign Up", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T08:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T08:19:20.691+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
