It's just a game. We're supposed to have fun. If we win, that's a bonus.\" \nThe Cougars definitely put on a show for the packed stands that day by dominating the Hillbillies in the first set 25-12. After the Cougars jumped out to a 5-0 lead, the Hillbillies responded by tying the game at 6-6 with a small burst that would inevitably fall flat. While on top 13-10, the Cougars found themselves scoring nine straight points an all but wrapping up the first game. Verona tried to come back with back-to-back points but the Cougars finished strong with the final three. \n\"We have fantastic servers,\" Tully said. \"On any given day, one of those servers is going to get to you. If one server doesn't get you, another one will. Tyla Parker ripped several good serves in game one and was quiet in game two but that's when Kimani Freeman took over. And Hailey Sylvander, she always manages to score.\" \nDespite the overall dominance of game one, the second game was a much closer affair with the Cougars winning 25-20. However, the Cougars only lost the lead one time during the tight game. The Hillbillies struck first the second time around, gaining a 5-2 lead but a five-point swing saw the Cougars with a 7-5 lead that they would not give up. The game saw back-and-forth point trades until while on top 12-11, the Cougars exploded with seven straight points. That open window gave the Cougars the exact lead they needed as Verona started to close strong by outscoring MKA 9-4 to make it a three-point game but the lead was too much and the Cougars closed out the game with the final two points. \nThe Cougars saw an all-around effort during their homecoming game with senior captains Freeman (10 service points, 10 digs, 5 aces) and Robinson (9 kills, 5 digs) leading the charge. Parker also had a strong performance with 16 assists, nine service points and five digs. \nBeyond serving, one of the things that has proven to be MKA's driving force is the overall team synergy that radiates from the Cougar bench. Because of their strong communication, the Cougars made very few mistakes and, if they did managed to bounce right back from them. \n\"Our girls do a great job at loving and supporting each other,\" Tully said. \"It's something we emphasize a lot and, in a game like this, it really showed up. \"You don't start a program with good players, you start it with good human beings and that's exactly what we have, wonderful girls who are wonderful human beings.\" \nCougar Streak Continues \nMKA won its seventh straight game on Tuesday, Oct. 13 with a 2-1 win over Caldwell and now prepare for their road trip to Livingston High School today, Oct. 15, at 4 p.m. \nThe Cougars came back from a 1-0 deficit to defeat Caldwell and saw yet another well-rounded performance. Junior Samantha Dowd led the team with 30 digs while Robinson picked up 13 kills, Parker recorded 19 assists and Sylvander and junior Grace Anders both recorded 11 service points. \nEmail: verhagen@northjersey.com Â© 2015 North Jersey Media Group Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T18:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T22:56:32.647+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
