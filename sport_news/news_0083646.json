The seven-team Mid-Illini Conference tournament will be held starting at 9 a.m. at the new Morton High School facility. Morton is expected to christen the new courts with its fifth consecutive league championship. Overall standings are determined by a combination of dual records and tournament finish. A perfect season nets the title winner 16.5 points. The Potters went 6-0 in dual matches, followed by Washington, Dunlap and Metamora, all of whom were 4-2 and split with each other. Morton needs only a second-place tournament result to capture M-I bragging rights for another year. Pekin was 2-4 in duals. East Peoria was next at 1-5 and Limestone went winless in six conference outings. Canton does not participate in girls tennis. There will be two singles and two doubles brackets at the eight-court setup that includes a viewing tower. The last team outside of Morton to win the league crown in girls tennis was Metamora in 2010. Pekin was the third-place team last season behind the Potters and Dunlap. The Dragonsâ€™ coach a year ago was Pat Lowder, who now directs the Morton program.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T08:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T11:52:17.787+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
