She saw an opportunity and took it. A false deed and bill of sale made the house hers, until the relatives of the dead owner sold it. Google Maps Street View A NYPD cop allegedly stole a townhouse in a “dirty deed” against the rightful home owners. Officer Blanche O'Neal, 45, of the 83rd Precinct in Bushwick allegedly stole a three-family home by signing the deed of a vacant home in her neighborhood over to herself and alleging she paid $10,000 for the property.\nSo just how does something like this happen? This three family home sat vacant for years after the owner died and left the property to family members. The woman died in 1993 and her nephew along with three other relatives inherited the property in Bed Stuy, according to CBS News on October 20.\nKen Thompson, a Brooklyn D.A. said that after the home sat vacant for years, “that was an opportunity that we allege this officer took advantage of by filing the necessary paperwork to be able to gain ownership falsely of the property in Bed Stuy.” O’Neal filed that paperwork back in 2012 making her the owner with these false papers.\nWhen a buyer for the property contacted the nephew last year, the scheme unraveled pointing to O’Neal with the smoking pen. In a bizarre twist, O’Neal notified the authorities when the rightful owners went to sell the property claiming that someone was trying to commit deed fraud against her.\nWhat was she thinking? Didn't she know that they'd catch on to this? USA Today suggests that O'Neal apparently was hoping that no one would notice that she just took over ownership of the property.\nThat didn’t go over very well because all O’Neal has is the paperwork she falsely conjured up. You would think as a member of law enforcement she would know enough that evidence of this sale would need to be presented. Although she said she paid $10,000 for the property, if she didn’t have evidence of that transaction she’s out of luck.\nIf O’Neal buying this property was fraudulent, as the court case claims, then there is no receipt for the $10,000 and her story has many holes in it. O’Neal came into the courthouse in handcuffs, but the judge let her go on her own recognizance. She left the courtroom unrestrained, not stopping to talk to waiting reporters. O’Neal has been suspended without pay from Bushwick’s 83rd Precinct.", "external_links": ["http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2015/10/19/cops-accused-of-stealing-townhouse/", "http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2015/10/20/nypd-officer-charged-with-stealing-four-story-townhouse-in-brooklyn/74267498/"], "published": "2015-10-20T22:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T00:38:06.015+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
