KPNX \nThe Ahwatukee Bowl was a dramatic one, with Mountain Pointe securing the win in the fourth quarter with a score of 28-14. \nBut for Mountain Pointe quarterback Jack Smith, the 'Tukee Bowl was just like any other week on the field. \n\"To me, because I didn't grow up here, I didn't know anything about it. It felt like any other game.\" \nMountain Pointe head coach Norris Vaughn echoed similar feelings. \n\"They're a good group of kids. They're in our neighborhood, we love them.\" \nDesert Vista quarterback Nick Thomas threw three interceptions on the night, two of which became touchdowns later in the drive. The third and final interception came with less than three minutes on the clock. \nDesert Vista will face Red Mountain next week while undefeated Mountain Pointe will face Desert Ridge.
