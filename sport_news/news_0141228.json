According to ESPN's Adam Schefter , multiple teams are expected to inquire about Payton.\nAdChoices Among those teams are the Miami Dolphins and Indianapolis Colts. The Dolphins are currently led by interim head coach Dan Campbell, while Chuck Pagano is seemingly on the hot seat in Indianapolis.\nAs Schefter reports, there is no sign that the Saints or Payton, himself, would consider offers from other teams. And because Payton is still under contract, the Saints would be in line to receive compensation if he does leave New Orleans.\nAs of now, the Dolphins are the only team with an interim head coach, as the Colts aren't a sure bet to fire Pagano.\nMORE NEWS: Want stories delivered to you?
