DraftKings and FanDuel employees have access to both things, neither of which is public,” his suit states.\n“Because the goal is to beat the other players, a player with statistical data about ownership percentages of competitors would have an edge over players without this data.”\nNew York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman has opened investigations into both companies.\nThe focus on the fantasy sites began last month when DraftKings worker Ethan Haskell won $350,000 on a $25 bet he made on competitor FanDuelduring the same week he “accidentally” leaked lineup data before the beginning of the third week of NFL games.\n“DraftKings and FanDuel both communicated to customers that their employees were not allowed to play on their own sites, but omitted the material fact that they were allowed to play on other sites and that other sites’ employees were allowed to play on their site,” the suit states.\nFanDuel did not respond to a request for comment.
