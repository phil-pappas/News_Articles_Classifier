Cloaked in blue and orange, fans called out the name of a man they feared had abandoned them. All was forgiven. All was forgotten. \nUnlimited and unrestrained, Matt Harvey was pitching the Mets to an early lead in the National League division series. \nMaking his second start of the postseason – his second start since all the down-the-stretch drama about his innings limits; since all the debate about his desire and motivation – Harvey was relentless against the Cubs’ young, explosive lineup, holding them in check for a 4-2 win in Game 1 of the NLCS. \n“I wanted to go out there,” Harvey said. “I wanted this game bad. … I know there’s been a lot of speculation or talks going around the past month, but I kind of wanted to kind of stop all that and really go out there and do everything I could for the team and help us start off right.” \nEven better than his performance in Game 3 of the division series, Harvey pitched into the eighth inning allowing two runs on four hits. He struck out nine, was hit in the triceps by a comebacker in the sixth, and convinced manager Terry Collins to let him go back out after the seventh. \n“Once in a while, you’ve got to throw him a bone,” Collins said. “And tonight was that time.” \nHarvey out away from eight complete innings when Kyle Schwarber homered on his final pitch of the night. When he was pulled for closer Jeurys Familia, Harvey walked off to a standing ovation and held one fist up to the crowd. \nThis was Harvey just as the Mets always envisioned. He’d frustrated the fan base in September with talk of a firm innings limit in his first year back from Tommy John surgery, but he’s been let loose in the playoffs, and fans called his name throughout the night. \nStrikeouts ended five of his innings, two of them with runners left stranded in scoring position. He’s won each of his playoff starts, and the plan is for him to pitch again this series. The Mets say there are no longer any workload limitations. \nAnd the Mets will take all the innings Harvey can give them. \n“I know exactly what he’s made of,” Collins said. “I know what he’s about, and he wants the baseball. He wants it.” \nTo back Harvey, the Mets turned to a familiar weapon. It was second baseman Daniel Murphy who put the Mets in the lead with his fourth home run in six games this postseason. \nHe took Clayton Kershaw deep for an early lead in the division series opener. He homered off Kershaw again in Game 4, providing the only Mets run of the night. His solo shot off Zack Greinke on Thursday was the game-winner that sent the Mets into the NLCS. \nAgainst Jon Lester on Saturday, Murphy homered in his very first at-bat. After hitting one home run off a left-handed pitcher in the regular season, he’s now hit two off Kershaw and one off Lester in the playoffs. \n“I don't think this is a phase for him,” general manager Sandy Alderson said. “I think that in some ways he's a fundamentally different hitter than he was as recently as three, four months ago.” \nThe Cubs briefly pulled even with an RBI double by Starlin Castro in the fifth inning, but the Mets responded with a two-out, RBI single by Curtis Granderson in the bottom of the fifth. Then Travis d'Arnaud homered off the center field apple in the sixth. Granderson lifted a cushion-building sacrifice fly in the seventh. \n“I really wanted to start things off the right way and get us rolling,” Harvey said. “Fortunately enough, I had things working pretty well, and we were able to do that.” 1 CONNECT 2 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://lohud.us/1LBGen3 TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T07:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T11:26:41.150+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
