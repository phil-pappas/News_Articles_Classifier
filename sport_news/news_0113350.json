And that didn’t change in the Mets 4-1 win over the Cubs on Sunday night in Game 2 of the NLCS at Citi Field.\nDuda went 0-for-3 with two more strikeouts, but the Mets survived thanks to some more excellent pitching and another homer by Murphy, as well as some help from Curtis Granderson and David Wright.\nBut Duda was supposed to be in the middle of the lineup, along with Yoenis Cespedes, adding to the mix.\nIt hasn’t happened.\nAnd to hear Duda talk about it, he’s not especially bothered by the situation because the Mets are taking a 2-0 lead with them to Chicago.\n“As long as we’re winning, that’s the main goal here,” Duda said. “It’s all about winning at this point in the season.”\nAnd that’s what the Mets have done lately, with little to no help from first base. Michael Cuddyer started in place of Duda against the left-handed Jon Lester in Game 1 and had a single, but Duda returned to face the right-handed Jake Arrieta Sunday night.\nWith righty Kyle Hendricks scheduled to start for the Cubs in Game 3 on Tuesday in Chicago, Duda figures to be in there again.\n“Whatever happens, I’m fine with, as long as the team results stay the same,” Duda said “I’d happily go 0-for-whatever with however many punchouts I might have, as long as we win. As long as the results are the way they are, everything’s good.”\nThat’s fine when the Mets are winning, but as unlikely as Murphy’s power surge has been, it’s just as unlikely that it will continue all the way through a potential World Series.\nAt some point, Duda will need to break out of the slump. So far this postseason, he has just two hits and 13 strikeouts.\n“I know what all the questions are, but if we keep moving on, I’m not worried about the answers,” Duda said.\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google Whatsapp Email Filed under chicago cubs ,  lucas duda ,  mlb playoffs ,  new york mets ,  nlcs", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T07:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T13:14:38.258+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
