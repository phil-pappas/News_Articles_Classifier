We have got to get mentally prepared to play.”Dardanelle (4-0, 1-0 4A-4 Conference) hasn’t struggled to play on the road or at Keenan Field so far this year. The Sand Lizards thumped the Booneville Bearcats 38-7 at Booneville in Week 2 and won their home games by a combined 129 points. Dardanelle averages 421 yards of total offense a game.Price credits the offensive line.“It’s super nice to have those guys up front,” he said. “Those guys dominated Pottsville. We rushed for 450 yards because our guys made some big holes. Those guys have seen it all. They get it. They do their job.”Running back Daniel Craig, who rushed for 99 yards and a touchdown against the Apaches, will be called on again against Clinton (1-3, 0-1).“He’s our best running back,” Price said. “You will see a lot more of him.”Part-time quarterback Chris Kershner, who rushed for 248 yards and two touchdowns against Pottsville, will again play versatile roles on the offense.Price said he likes to move Kershner around to create problems for the defense.“I think we can do some things formation-wise to give them some real problems,” he said. “We feel like we can exploit some of the things that we see. The good thing about Chris is he played running back in seventh and eighth grade. Then he played QB as a sophomore. Then he played wide receiver as a junior. He knows all those spots. That makes it real easy for me to move him around.”Kickoff is scheduled for 7 p.m. today at Jim Tumlison Field.
