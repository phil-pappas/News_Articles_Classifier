Hunter scored the team’s first touchdown on a 15-yard burst. Hunter helped lead a defense that held the Trojans to 82 yards and five first downs in the first half. The Regals forced two first-half turnovers and made the Trojans punt six times. \n“We were looking for a lot of different stuff,” Hunter said. “You never know what a team’s going to do against you.” \nPhillips scored a touchdown on a 60-yard winding run through the scattered Trojan (1-3, 2-5) defense. He had a punt return for a TD called back by a penalty and was a threat to score anytime he touched the ball because of his speed and ability to cut back and forth. \nStenger passed 39 yards to a wide-open Thomas Rapp for another TD on a flea flicker that completely fooled the Trojan secondary. Regina racked up 16 first-half first downs, 205 yards rushing and 142 yards passing in the first half alone. The second half was played with a continuous clock and Regina emptied the bench.
