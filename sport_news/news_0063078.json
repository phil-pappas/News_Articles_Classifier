Just take a gander at the one-fifth that died in the Trans-Atlantic slave trade... and the inhuman conditions of life once they arrived, shackled, on the plantations. Sorry Mr. George, read more history and diaries! This is much, much more than just “one humanity issue,” and sadly, it’s still going on in today’s world! Jim Prunetti The slumber of fools To the Editor: Some folks get too much of the religion of global warming in letters to the editor. They suggest letters should be limited, protecting our Constitutional Right to be uninformed. Since global warming deniers lack supportable arguments and evidence, they would like to suppress the issue. Normally in debate when you’re in that position you recognize you’re wrong and submit to the science. However, denial proudly ignores reason. There’s an organization called NASA that sent a rocket ship to the moon with men on board. NASA has a telescope that can see light from the other side of the universe, letting us look back in time. But these facts are true only if you choose to believe them. Google “NASA: global warming.” NASA states the planet is warming and humanity is in grave danger. They have facts, graphs, and research. And NASA is authoritative for people who believe in the American tradition that the best supported ideas create the best policy. That is what made America’s government the envy of the world. If free market economics solves all problems, then why do we have global warming? Free market economics is self-serving nonsense. And because we do have global warming, we need a strong responsible government to confront the irresponsibility of many of our corporations. Of course some readers would have us suppress NASA and ignore the fact that free market economics is crony capitalism. For them it doesn’t matter how big the piles are that they sweep under the carpet of ideology. How can you have responsible government if you don’t have responsible, knowledgeable citizens? Or is the goal irresponsible government? For those who care, there is a march at 3 p.m. Wednesday, Oct. 14, at Courthouse Square demanding action on global warming. See you there.
