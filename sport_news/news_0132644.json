Some reportedly took photos\n— InsideUSC (@InsideUSC) October 11, 2015 Player on last year's #USC team claims Sarkisian drank bottle of Patron Tequila after Notre Dame game at Coliseum in 2014\n— InsideUSC (@InsideUSC) October 11, 2015 BREAKING: #USC assistants pulled Steve Sarkisian out of player huddle on sideline during Arizona State game. Believed he was not sober\n— InsideUSC (@InsideUSC) October 11, 2015 These reports come on the heels of Sarkisian appearing drunk at a USC donor event back in August.\nOriginal story: USC still hasn't really righted the ship following the Pete Carroll era. Steve Sarkisian took over after Lane Kiffin 's failed regime. After a disappointing 3-2 start following a loss against the Huskies, Sarkisian's direction is looking shaky, too.\nTrojan news didn't get better on Sunday. The school announced that Sarkisian is taking a leave of absence after missing today's practice.\nTwo sources at USC say Steve Sarkisian was sent home by athletic director Pat Haden earlier today.\n— Bryan Fischer (@BryanDFischer) October 11, 2015 Haden didn't reveal Sarkisian's specific condition, but he told reporters that Sarkisian didn't sound right when he called inquiring why he missed practice.\n\"I was at a basketball event earlier today when I got a call to say Sarkisian was not at practice,\" he said. \"I called Steve and he made it clear to me that he was not healthy, and I asked him to take an indefinite leave of absence. I think this is the right thing for our team.\"\nOffensive coordinator Clay Helton will serve as USC's interim head coach.\n[ via ESPN ]", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/InsideUSC/status/653347087208153088", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/USC?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/InsideUSC", "https://twitter.com/InsideUSC/status/653351987090558977", "http://espn.go.com/losangeles/college-football/story/_/id/13864229/usc-trojans-head-coach-steve-sarkisian-take-leave-absence", "https://twitter.com/InsideUSC/status/653355657244995584", "https://twitter.com/BryanDFischer/status/653317041055600640"], "published": "2015-10-12T02:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T08:36:09.976+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
