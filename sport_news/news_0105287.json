I'm honored, humbled and blessed to stand here today as head baseball coach at Auburn University. Auburn has meant so much to me and my family over the years.\"\nThe 45-year-old from Aberdeen, Miss., has coached at Mississippi State for the past seven seasons and served as associate head coach for the Bulldogs since 2013. He was an assistant at Auburn from 2006 to 2008.\nThompson is the 17th head coach in program history and succeeds Sunny Golloway, who was fired last month after two seasons on the Plains and an internal investigation into the program.\nJacobs said he conducted \"several\" interviews for the position, but ultimately felt Thompson was the best fit.\n\"This is an exciting day in Auburn baseball,\" Jacobs said. \"To be able to bring a guy in with the character and integrity that Butch Thompson has and the experience he has in the Southeastern Conference at Georgia, Auburn and Mississippi State and the way he has owned the state of Alabama from a recruiting standpoint, you begin to think about the future of the program.\"\nRELATED: Quick hits: Auburn introduces Thompson\nThompson said his biggest draws to Auburn were the \"history, tradition and passion.\" He feels \"battle tested\" after 15 seasons in the SEC.\n\"I believe all the ingredients are here,\" Thompson said. \"The commitment to get to the College World Series is here.\"\nAuburn's last appearance in the College World Series was in 1997, but Thompson's track record is an impressive one. The 2014 Baseball America assistant coach of the year has reached the College World Series seven times, most recently with Mississippi State in 2013. Known as a top recruiter, nine of his players have gone on to pitch in Major League Baseball.\nThompson is eager to get going at Auburn as the final weeks of the recruiting season wind down. He knows his work is cut out for him, as he inherits a team that finished ninth in the SEC last season with a 13-17 mark.\nThompson met with his new team Thursday and told the Tigers \"It's going to be OK.\"\n\"I think we have a good ball club,\" said Thompson. \"I know these players. I've competed against these players. There's an opportunity for an initial connection from knowing them. We will not give this season away, next week away, tomorrow away, today away, a pitch away.\"\nJacobs said the decision to retain members of Golloway's staff, which includes renowned pitching coach Tom Holliday, will be Thompson's to make.\nAuburn opens its 2016 campaign with a three-game homestead against Sacramento State beginning Feb. 19.\nWatch Thompson's press conference in the video above.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T07:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T06:20:22.834+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
