Courtesy of Sock it to Me Walker is chief executive at Sock it to Me , a Portland company that delights in creating footwear populated with bacon strips, sloths and Sasquatches, and is gearing up to release its first line of underwear .\nThe new line is just one way Sock it to Me is responding to rapid-fire growth: It's expanding its international business; it's moving company headquarters from inner Southeast to a larger space in Milwaukie; and it's in the midst of a hiring spree.\nA decade ago, Sock it to Me was little more than an idea. Founder Carrie Atkinson started the business from her kitchen in 2004, selling at the Portland Saturday Market.\nThese days, Sock it to Me's business is 90 percent wholesale, with more than 3,000 accounts, including Powell's Books and New Seasons Market. Sales have tripled in recent years: The sock maker ended 2012 with $3.4 million in sales, and is expecting to reach $9 million this year.\nTo get there, Sock it to Me has capitalized on its customer base's love of everything quirky, adorable and nerdy. A Portland company to the bone, it delivers on the weirdness in plenty of ways other than selling Sasquatch socks. A dedicated employee draws personalized doodles on every customer invoice, and the company hosts an annual sock-design contest (going on now ), where the winning design is put into production.\nThese moves have helped Sock it to Me build a loyal fan base, which it's counting on to make its entrance to the underwear market a success.\n\"Carrie had been wanting to do underwear for a while,\" Walker said. \"Socks are everyday items, so are underwear. They can still have fun aesthetics.\"\nTo launch the undie line, they picked the company's best-performing sock designs and printed them on men's boxer briefs and women's bikini briefs.\nThey're hoping the line, which officially launches around Valentine's Day (though they'll be available before that), will help offset the seasonal nature of sock sales, which peak in the fall.\nThose who buy Sock it to Me's undies might not be able to show off their briefs the same way they can with socks, but the company has discovered its customers care more about how their products make them feel than how they look to others, anyway. Even so, the designs are important to get customers interested in the first place.\n\"I think the designs really resonate with people,\" said Marketing Manager Sarah Jean Charniak. \"It's the whimsical self-expression.\"\nBut the Sock it to Me team doesn't want their customers to keep all the underwear for themselves. They're big on gifting.\n\"We want to make it less about a private, secret undergarment, more of an upfront, out-there, proud of your point of view thing,\" Walker said. \"It gives you a little something in your step.\"\n-- Anna Marum\namarum@oregonian.com\n503-294-5911\n@annamarum", "external_links": ["http://issuu.com/kriskaplan/docs/sitm_2015_catalog_underwear", "https://twitter.com/annamarum", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/xc0U6e7nr6s", "http://contest.sockittome.com/", "http://www.sockittome.com/"], "published": "2015-09-30T15:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T00:29:32.611+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
