LOUIS – Right-hander Kyle Hendricks, who had an impressive finish to his first full season in the majors, gets the call to start Game 2 against the Cardinals on Saturday in St. Louis.\nHendricks (8-7, 3.95) closed out the season with 13 consecutive scoreless innings – part of the 0.30-ERA stretch for the rotation during the nine-game winning streak (wild-card game included) that they carry into Friday’s Division Series opener.\n“You saw his last couple of games,” manager Joe Maddon said of the decision. “He’s been really sharp. The fact that he could put the ball on the ground matters a lot, too; keep the ball out of the air.”\nHendricks faces left-hander Jaime Garcia (10-6, 2.43) Saturday.\nJon Lester (10-11, 3.34) faces the Cards’ John Lackey (13-10, 2.77) in Friday’s opener.\nAnd Jason Hammel (10-7, 3.74) would follow ace Jake Arrieta in a potential Game 4 start at Wrigley unless he’s needed out of the bullpen early in the series, Maddon said.\nThe Cardinals’ Michael Wacha (17-7, 3.38) goes against Arrieta in Game 3, with Lance Lynn (12-11, 3.03) in a possible Game 4.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T05:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T11:53:56.141+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
