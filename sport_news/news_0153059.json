East dynamic continues to shift toward parity Comment Posted Oct. 1, 2015 at 8:30 PM By Tim Britton Posted Oct. 1, 2015 at 8:30 PM NEW YORK — It was hard to feel the excitement. Even with the Yankees on the verge of clinching a postseason berth all series, there was the opposite of buzz for four autumn games against the Red Sox in the Bronx. The crowd was sparse, even when the weather cooperated earlier in the week, and it lacked energy. No, Sox and Yanks ain't what it used to be. Part of that is the absurdly high bar 2003 and 2004 set for this rivalry; the teams weren't going to meet in a seven-game postseason series every year. But another part is the changing dynamic of an American League East that has now yielded five different champions in the past six seasons. On Wednesday night, the Blue Jays clinched their first division title since 1993, becoming the fourth different team to win the East the last four seasons. The longest drought without a division title belongs to the Rays, who haven't won it since 2010, and the longest postseason drought belongs, at least until they officially clinch, to the Yankees. Each division in the National League has teams that haven't finished in first place in the wild-card era. In the A.L. Central, the Royals hadn’t won a division since 1985 before this year. In the A.L. West, the Astros and Mariners haven't finished first since 2001. The East used to be the division that defined top-heavy. From 1987 to 2007, only four different franchises won the East, which included seven teams for part of that time. Nineteen of the 20 titles were won by New York, Boston or Toronto. Competitively, this is the division's flattest stretch since the 1980s, when from 1981 to 1986 six different teams claimed the division title. Toronto's winning the division after being below .500 in late July reiterated what many had been saying about the division the last few years. The lack of a competitive behemoth like the turn-of-the-century Yankees means the barrier of entry for contention is lower than before. The 50-51 Blue Jays were eight games out on July 28. That would have put them 13.5 back in 2004 (and 24.5 back in 1998). The division has made up for it, though, with balance throughout. Sure, the Yankees aren’t winning 100 games consistently anymore, but neither are the Rays losing 100 games each year. The Red Sox can't count on exhaling on road swings through Tampa and Baltimore the way they could a decade ago. Entering play Thursday, the Rays occupied last place in the East with 77 wins. There remained an outside shot of all five teams reaching .500 on the season — something only done by the 2005 National League East. Only Tampa Bay had a negative run differential. A dozen years ago, the task for Boston consisted of chasing the Yankees. It was difficult, to be sure, but relatively simple. Page 2 of 2 - Now the Red Sox have to contend with all four other teams in the division. Toronto is an offensive monster now and for the foreseeable future. Baltimore faces an uncertain winter, but the tandem of Dan Duquette and Buck Showalter has provided the Orioles with their best stretch in two decades. Tampa Bay continues to churn out quality young players. And then there's the issue of payrolls. The gap between New York and Boston's tier and that containing the division's other three squads has diminished considerably. In the past decade, the Sox have increased their Opening Day payroll by 30.4 percent. The average payroll for the Blue Jays, Orioles and Rays has increased by 142 percent in the same time period. What challenges does that shifting dynamic represent for Boston? \"I just know in the offseason preparation, when we're outlining our thoughts for the next year's teams, we're thinking about how we can compete with some of those other teams in our division,\" interim manager Torey Lovullo said Thursday. \"We're just trying to figure out a way to beat each other. There is no magical solution. It's a great division; we all know that. \"It just seems like if you do one or two of the right things, you're going to jump up on top. I know the Blue Jays are well ahead, but it was a pretty equal division for a long time until they picked up David Price and got some key horses and finally ran away with it. It's a tough division, we know that. We're preparing for other moments within the division all year long.\" If you braved the cold, the rain and the lethargy at Yankee Stadium on Thursday night, you could lament that this was what had become of a rivalry that was all-encompassing in the American League not that long ago. But perhaps you could also appreciate a division that has become arguably the most fascinating in baseball — one that figures to remain that way going forward.
