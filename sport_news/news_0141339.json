(Photo: PTI) Manchester : The transition from amateur to professional has not been an easy one but star Indian boxer Vijender Singh cannot wait for the beginning of a new life when he makes his pro debut on October 10 against Englishman Sonny Whiting.\nTraining for more than a month here under globally acclaimed trainer Lee Beard, Vijender said he is confident of a winning start in the circuit.\n\"It's altogether a different beginning of my life. I am really excited for the debut day and I am in shape. I have stayed for more than a month in this gym with trainers like Lee beard and Haroon Headley,\" Vijender said.\nAsked what has been the hardest aspect of his training, Vijender said nothing was in fact easy. \"Professional training is really hard but I love to do hard things in my life. I was an amateur boxer, now I am turning pro so everything has changed slowly but I am hard working so I can do it,\" he said.\n\"I am learning new techniques everyday from boxers like Jason, Andren and Jack whom I follow. I see them and how they use different techniques so I just watch and learn from them,\" Vijender added.\nThe 29-year-old said he is hoping that the Indian community in Manchester will come out to support to him. \"I am getting warm welcomes at different places by the Indian community here in Manchester and they ask me about the date of my debut fight. They all are very excited to see me in the professional ring and they told me that they will come to see my fight. I am sure Indian community will turn up in large numbers at Manchester Arena to cheer me on October 10,\" he said.\nPages 1 2 next › last » Tags: Boxing Vijender Singh Sonny Whiting pro boxing Manchester Also Read I had another opportunity and that's why I have turned a pro: Vijender Singh Still feel guilty about letting down Indian Army: Gurcharan Singh Boxer Vijender Singh in trouble, Haryana police warns him of action", "external_links": ["http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/connect.php/js/FB.Share", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/151006/sports-other-sports/article/cant-wait-start-new-life-pro-debut-vijender-singh", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php", "https://apis.google.com/js/plusone.js", "http://vuukle.com/js/vuukle.js", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/styles/article_node_view/public/Vijender_PTI_0.jpg", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/Vijender_PTI_0.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-08T01:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-07T14:39:05.809+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
