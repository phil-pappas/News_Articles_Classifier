(Getty Images) \nLess than a year removed from an 11-5 record and playoff berth, the Lions have played as poorly as any team in the NFL. They lost three of their games by double-digit margins while choking away second half leads in their two other defeats. Detroit remains the only team without a win, and their play so far suggests that few, if any victories, are likely to come later in the year. \nCertainly, the coaching staff shouldn't shoulder all of the blame for Detroit's slow start. Even when healthy, the offensive line lacks the players to keep the pocket clean on a regular basis. Meanwhile, the defense has slid backwards without Ndamukong Suh manning the defensive front. In a vacuum, these drop-offs aren't the fault of head coach Jim Caldwell or his assistants. However, successful staffs develop talent to fill the voids and cover up deficiencies through scheme. That hasn't happened often in Detroit this season, particularly on offense. \nHeading into Week 5, the Lions' offense ranked 16th through the air and dead last on the ground according to Football Outsiders' DVOA metric . The problems come into focus on closer inspection. The offensive line began the week with 65 total pressures on their record according to Pro Football Focus , most of any team in the conference. The interior of the unit has also struggled in the ground game, with the Lions only running behind the guards on six occasions to date. For a unit featuring Calvin Johnson and Golden Tate at the skill positions, four Day 1 and 2 draft picks along the offensive line and a Pro Bowler under center, those results reflect poorly on team's coaches. \nAt this stage, Caldwell appears unwilling to consider adjustments to his staff. The question surfaced multiple times during the coach's postgame pressers in recent weeks, particularly in reference to offensive coordinator Joe Lombardi. Though Lombardi's offense averages fewer than 21 points a game for the second consecutive year, Caldwell continues to express support for the embattled assistant. That may change at some juncture, especially if Lombardi cannot resolve the team's ever-worsening problem under center. \nLombardi's hiring in 2014 coincides with the decline of quarterback Matthew Stafford. Once considered a rising star at the position, Stafford developed an undesirable penchant for turnovers. He currently leads the league with eight interceptions despite taking fewer shots downfield than in previous years. On Sunday, two of Stafford's three picks came on short, routine passes, one on a throw 10 yards down the field and another on a halfback screen. These are mistakes befitting a rookie signal caller, not a seven-year veteran with Pro Bowl credentials to his name. Yet under Lombardi's watch, Stafford cannot seem to avoid turnovers, which is why the Lions benched him for journeyman Dan Orlovsky during the third quarter of Sunday's game. \nLombardi's play calling has also come under fire. Shortly after the Lions' Week 3 loss to the Denver Broncos, Tate made the startling admission that opponents could identify the team's plays before they even snapped the ball. \n\"I've had a couple occasions in literally each game where they called out our play, one, then afterwards been like, 'Hey, we knew what you guys were doing,'\" Tate said during a radio appearance . \"I don't know how they know, or what film they're watching that we're giving away. That's something we got to go back and watch our tendencies to figure out where we line up or how we line up or what formation or whatever it may be. \n\"We've got to figure it out because we're clearly giving it away. All three weeks, a player's come up to me and said, 'We knew where you were going to.' That's bad.\" \nDisguising intent is an important aspect of play calling, yet Lombardi's offense remains predictable two weeks later. According to the NFL Game Statistics and Information System database, he utilizes three wide receivers and a tight end on roughly 60 percent of all first downs. In those cases, the Lions attempt a pass over 77 percent of the time. Lombardi changes up his looks more on second and third down, but he still has favorites. With so little variety, it's little surprise that defenses can guess what's coming from Detroit. \nEven if Lombardi's job looks secure for now, Caldwell may feel compelled to reverse course if the issues persist. After all, Caldwell experienced firsthand what a midseason play caller change can do for a team. \nIn 2012, the Ravens fired offensive play caller Cam Cameron 11 games into the season and handed the reins to Caldwell. Though the team's scoring output actually dipped, the unit exhibited greater balance with Ray Rice becoming a more heavily featured weapon. That approach proved beneficial during Baltimore's playoff run, a trip that resulted in a 34-31 Super Bowl XLVII victory over the 49ers. \nTime has probably run out for Detroit to make a postseason push in 2015, but a new play caller could give the team a chance to get out of the NFL cellar. Achieving such a modest goal won't placate fans, but it could help save the head coach's job. Caldwell lost his only other HC gig -- a three-year stint with the Indianapolis Colts -- when his team bottomed out at 2-14. If the Lions finish with a similarly woeful record this year, Caldwell may not be around much longer to rectify his mistakes.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T16:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T20:38:57.176+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
