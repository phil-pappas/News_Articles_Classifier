And as a result Miami was consistently being pushed around at the line of scrimmage.\nNot even three minutes into his first press conference Campbell pledged to fix things, vowed to make changes, and promised not to pull any punches.\n\"When you're talking about the fronts, O-line and D-line, it starts with an attitude and the culture,\" Campbell said. \"It has always been that way.\"\nMike Tannenbaum on Sean Payton rumors Sid Rosenberg (640-AM Sports) asks Dolphins Executive VP of Football Operations Mike Tannenbaum about rumors that Saints' Sean Payton will be next Dolphins coach.\nSid Rosenberg (640-AM Sports) asks Dolphins Executive VP of Football Operations Mike Tannenbaum about rumors that Saints' Sean Payton will be next Dolphins coach.\nSee more videos That was hint number one.\nThen, during his second day on the job Campbell's first meeting with his team featured a film session with Miami's offensive line.\nThe film work on display was a breakdown of every sack, pressure, quarterback hit allowed, penalty, snapshots of defenders in Miami's backfield, and every tackle they allowed behind the line of scrimmage.\nIt was a horror show of mistakes, and probably lasted as long as a major motion picture horror flick would based on all the mistakes made by Miami's much-maligned offensive line.\n\"He had us watch all the bad plays we've had and really hone in on what you want to work on fundamentally,\" said Ja'Wuan James, the Dolphins starting right tackle. \"We ran through all the runs we had and he said 'I want you to be critical.'\nTannenbaum on if Ryan Tannehill has regressed Sid Rosenberg (640-AM Sports) asks Dolphins Executive VP of Football Operations Mike Tannenbaum if Ryan Tannehill has regressed.\nSid Rosenberg (640-AM Sports) asks Dolphins Executive VP of Football Operations Mike Tannenbaum if Ryan Tannehill has regressed.\nSee more videos \"We just have to all continue to be hard on ourselves,\" James said. \"Everyone!\"\nWith or without Branden Albert, the starting left tackle who has been sidelined two games because of a hamstring strain, the Dolphins' offensive line has played poorly. Only the Lions are worse at running the football this season.\nThe Dolphins haven't opened up many running lanes, leading to a stagnant rushing attack that averages 69.3 yards per game. And they can't protect the quarterback consistently, especially when fire blitzes are coming.\nIf something doesn't get done, if things don't change Ryan Tannehill will easily keep his crown as the most sacked quarterback in the NFL since the 2012 season, when he career began.\nNot all of Miami's offensive problems are on the offensive line, but it is clear that Campbell believes the journey to fixing them begins with that unit.\n\"He was a tight end, but all tight ends are kind of linemen at heart,\" Pro Bowl center Mike Pouncey said of Campbell, who played 11 seasons in the NFL. \"He understands that to win football games, to have a winning football team it starts from the inside out. ... If you want to win football games you have to run the ball and stop the run on defense and that's something we haven't done much of.\"\nEnough of this pass first, pass often, and pass at the goal line mentality.\n\"We're trying to change the attitude of those guys up front, it's about finish. We need a little bit nastier attitude,\" Campbell said before correcting himself. \"We need a lot nastier attitude.\"\nCampbell pointed fingers of blame at everyone for Miami's shortcomings running the football. Everyone — from the receivers and tight ends. And while he didn't specifically call out the tailbacks, Campbell did point out that Miami's runners are leaving yards on the field.\nHe also romanticized about Knowshon Moreno's physical running style, using last year's veteran back — who is not on an NFL roster this season — as an example of what he wants to see from Lamar Miller and company.\n\"When I saw Knowshon, and the way that he ran, those guys fed off of it upfront. ... 'Oh my God, this guy is running hard, I cannot let him keep taking hits, I will block this guy until the end because he is pouring out his heart and soul for this run.' \" Campbell said. \"To me, that's where it all changes.\"\nThat's the challenge, to change Philbin's finesse Dolphins to Campbell's physical bunch begins.\nPrivacy Policy Miami Dolphins Joe Philbin NFL Mike Pouncey Knowshon Moreno NFL Pro Bowl Detroit Lions", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-561d3742/turbine/sfl-tannenbaum-on-if-ryan-tannehill-has-regressed-20151013", "http://www.tribpub.com/privacy-policy-and-your-privacy-rights/", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-561d993e/turbine/fl-dolphins-kelly-column-1014-20151013", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-561d2b5e/turbine/sfl-mike-tannenbaum-on-sean-payton-rumors-20151013"], "published": "2015-10-14T00:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T03:36:30.010+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
