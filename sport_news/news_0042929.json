Jackson had bigger things in mind.\n“If a lot of the plays are based off you, it’s on you if things are going well or not going well,” Jackson said Thursday morning, before he made his preseason debut for the Pistons in a home loss to the Nets. “You get to make a lot of plays, but you are also going to take the brute force of criticism.\n“That’s something you have to be willing to take, and that’s exactly what I wanted: to be able to have my ship and be the captain, and either sink with it or get the best you can out of it. I’m ready for the responsibility, but a lot comes with the job. I’m looking forward to it, and trying to make something special here.”\nFor the Pistons to become something special again – see: their run of six straight trips to the Eastern Conference Finals, including two trips to the NBA Finals and a championship in 2004, that ended in 2008 – it’s going to take the 25-year-old Jackson living up to that contract, and proving he’s the kind of player a team can build around.\nPistons coach Stan Van Gundy Photo: AP Stan Van Gundy – the coach and czar of Pistons basketball – is a believer. When Brandon Jennings — already tagged as an iffy defender and inconsistent shooter — was lost for the season last February with a torn Achilles tendon, the Pistons began looking for a long-term solution at point guard. Only one name made sense.\nThe Pistons handed their team over to Jackson by getting him in a three-team trade with the Thunder and Jazz just before the trade deadline, then signed him to a five-year, $80 million contract this summer.\n“We had to shift gears,” Van Gundy said Thursday morning. “That had not been a position we had targeted earlier in the year to spend our money on, but it’s quite possibly the most important position on the floor, and so we needed to be comfortable that we had the right long-term option. So when Brandon went down and we had to start shifting into thinking about point guards, we easily thought [Reggie] was the best option out there.”\nJackson is a divisive figure in the basketball community. A good value selection by Thunder general manager Sam Presti with the No. 24 pick in the 2011 draft, Jackson has shown a spotty jump shot – he’s a career 29.4 percent 3-point shooter – and has struggled to get to the foul line.\nBut the Pistons are confident Jackson can improve in those areas. He shot 33.7 percent on 3-points in his 27 games with the Pistons after the trade, and his free throws attempts per game rose to 3.8 (career average: 1.8).\n“What’s really stood out, and it’s what our scouts had said, besides what you can see on the floor, he’s got a tremendous desire to be a great player, and he’s got a great, great passion for the game,” Van Gundy said. “I think the guys who have that, they usually end up OK. When you have those guys, and you see the talent on top of it, you figure they’re going to just get better and better.”\nAndre Drummond can form the other half of a potent pick-and-roll combo. Photo: AP Van Gundy and his lieutenants only have been in charge of the Pistons for a year, but the foundations of his preferred style of play are being put into place. They moved on from Greg Monroe, never offering him a max contract last summer and letting him walk as an unrestricted free agent in July. Monroe couldn’t provide the floor spacing Van Gundy craves next to center Andre Drummond – who the Pistons hope can become something like what Dwight Howard was for Van Gundy during their very successful run together in Orlando. Drummond is set to get a max contract either before the season or, more likely, next summer, when the Pistons will have an extra $12 million or so in cap space.\nBetween Kentavious Caldwell-Pope and rookie Stanley Johnson, the Pistons have a pair of wings they hope can grow with Drummond — a nice advantage given the lack of wing depth around the NBA.\nThe Pistons also did a nice job this summer of using their cap space to take on useful assets from teams looking to shed salary. They acquired Ersan Ilyasova from Milwaukee (ironically opening up the cap space for the Bucks to sign Monroe a few weeks later) and Marcus Morris, Reggie Bullock and Anthony Tolliver as part of the Suns’ fruitless pursuit of LaMarcus Aldridge.\nThat leaves Jackson as the major question. He certainly put up numbers after the trade, averaging 17.6 points, 4.7 rebounds and 9.2 assists in those 27 games with the Pistons, and Van Gundy’s system – redicated on spreading the floor and running pick-and-rolls with a big like Drummond who can roll like a freight train to the rim – seems well-suited to Jackson’s skills.\nNow it’s up to Jackson to prove the Pistons were right to put their faith, their franchise and plenty of cash in his hands.\n“It’s still going to take more time,” Jackson said. “I think we’ve shown some flashes, probably quicker than most people expected. Of course, they’re going to expect a lot more this season, but we’re still going to have our ups and downs, and there will probably be times we’re not going to be on the same page.\n“But we have a common goal, and we’ve got to take control of this team this year, and put it on our backs. We have to go out front and try to figure it out together and hopefully turn this around and get [to the playoffs], somewhere we haven’t been in six seasons here.”\nHornets lost sting before season started Michael Kidd-Gilchrist Photo: AP The Hornets got disappointing news this week when Michael Kidd-Gilchrist was lost for the season after needing surgery to repair a torn labrum in his right shoulder.\nIt was a crushing blow for the Hornets, one of the NBA’s most active teams this summer. They traded for Nicolas Batum, Spencer Hawes and Jeremy Lamb, signed Jeremy Lin and Tyler Hansbrough and drafted Frank Kaminsky to improve the shooting around the trio of Kidd-Gilchrist, Kemba Walker and Al Jefferson.\nBut everything revolved around Kidd-Gilchrist, who was a crucial cog for Hornets coach Steve Clifford the past two seasons. With the defensive monster in the lineup, the Hornets were 62-55 – and 14-33 without him.\nThe Hornets have a lot of questionable defenders, particularly in the paint, but the plan was for Batum and Kidd-Gilchrist to be good enough on the wings to make up for that. Without Kidd-Gilchrist, though, the Hornets will have an extremely hard time making up for their defensive shortcomings, and it likely will be yet another long season in Charlotte.\nPaul George should drop power forward beef Paul George returns for his first full season off a gruesome broken leg in 2014. Photo: NBAE via Getty Images Paul George keeps making comments about how he’s not thrilled playing power forward , most recently to the Indianapolis Star after the Pacers lost to the Pelicans in their preseason opener.\nNo matter how much George complains about it, he doesn’t have a choice. Pacers president Larry Bird has decreed George will be the team’s power forward, and he doesn’t care how much George complains about it. And Indiana coach Frank Vogel doesn’t have any other options to play there.\nAfter they traded Roy Hibbert and David West left in free agency, here are the bigs the Pacers now have on their roster: Ian Mahinmi, Jordan Hill, Lavoy Allen, Shayne Whittington and rookies Myles Turner and Rakeem Christmas.\nTurner – the No. 11 pick this June – has tons of potential, but he will need time to develop. George is the best option at power forward – particularly in a league increasingly focused on playing smaller and quicker, with a greater emphasis on shooting.\nYes, George is going to have his hands full trying to guard someone like Pelicans forward Anthony Davis. But matchups like that are few and far between, and George should able to take advantage of the vast majority of opposing 4s. He might as well get used to playing there, because his role won’t be changing anytime soon.\n  andre drummond ,  brandon jennings ,  charlotte hornets ,  detroit pistons ,  indiana pacers ,  oklahoma city thunder ,  paul george ,  reggie jackson (nba) ,  stan van gundy", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T15:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T21:03:14.204+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
