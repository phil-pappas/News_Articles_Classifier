But the Dallas Cowboys did not stop Tom Brady.\nAfter being sacked just six times in the Patriots’ first three games of the 2015 season, Brady was sacked five times in the first half by the Cowboys on Sunday. Brady persevered through the pressure and led the Patriots to a 30-6 win .\nPatriots head coach Bill Belichick didn’t even have patience for questions about possible questions about Brady’s toughness after the win.\n “I don’t think it’s overlooked,” Belichick responded on Sunday when a reporter asked about Brady’s resiliency and toughness possibly being overlooked by some. “I don’t think anybody questions Tom’s toughness. Who has ever done that?”\nAfter the reporter attempted to clarify the question, Belichick made it clear how he feels about Brady’s toughness.\n“I think Tom is one of the toughest players in the league,” he said .\nWhile Belichick may not have heard about it, former NFL linebacker Bart Scott, a longtime rival of the Patriots while playing with the Ravens and Jets, did recently question Brady’s toughness while comparing him to injured Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger.\n“There’s nothing tough about Tom Brady,” Scott said during an appearance on CBS Sports Radio on Sept. 30. “The toughest thing about Tom Brady is his chin because it has the dimple in it, which is characteristic of most super heroes.”\nWhile Belichick would likely have taken issue with Scott’s assessment of Brady’s toughness, perhaps they could have agreed on the Patriots’ quarterback resembling a super hero.\nPHOTOS: Patriots vs. Cowboys\n The New England Patriots took their undefeated record into the Lone Star State in a Week 5 matchup against the Dallas Cowboys.
