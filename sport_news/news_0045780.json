The Heisman contender couldn't overcome the ball-control issues that put the Golden Bears (5-1, 2-1) in a hole. \nThe Utes entered the game with seven interceptions and Marcus Williams, Justin Thomas, Gionni Paul and Dominique Hatfield all picked off passes in the first half. Hatfield had another interception in the fourth quarter. \nUtah quarterback Travis Wilson couldn't recapture the magic that led to a 42-point victory at Oregon two weeks ago. He finished with 170 yards, one touchdown and two interceptions. \nCopyright © The Associated Press. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed.
