Owner Glen Taylor hugged Cheryl Reeve, and Moore leaped on to the scorer's table and pumped her fists toward the crowd. \n\"The way we grinded together, a lot of things happen throughout the season that people don't even know,\" Augustus said. \"We kept grinding and working despite everything that we've been through.\" \nIt was a stunning collapse for the previously unflappable Fever, who had staved off elimination five straight times in these playoffs leading into Game 5. \nJanuary and Catchings helped turn Indiana into a tough, confident bunch that erased an 18-point deficit to beat the New York Liberty in Game 2 of the Eastern Conference finals, but finally ran into a wall they couldn't break through at the boisterous Target Center on Wednesday night. \nIn the second and third quarters, the Fever scored 12 points total and turned the ball over 17 times. \nStar guard Briann January scored six points in the first quarter for Indiana, but didn't get her next bucket until six minutes were gone in the third quarter. She finished with 13 points on 6-for-15 shooting. \nThe game got off to an ugly start, with the Lynx slugging out a 27-21 lead at halftime in the lowest-scoring first half in finals history. Neither team could hit a shot or hold on to the ball, and Moore was held to just three points on 1-for-5 shooting. \nThe Lynx kept the defense set to stifling in the second half, but finally started to generate a little offense in the third to gradually pull away.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T05:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T06:12:52.974+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
