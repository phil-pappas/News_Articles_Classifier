We are glad to get off there with a win. \n\"The big challenge for us was to mentally get back up after what happened last weekend. I thought we did that quite well. \n\"We set our stall out early doors, but physically it was tough, especially the second half. I am just glad we held on in the end for a win. \n\"We have got a couple of days to rest up now, and then it will be into a full Test week before playing Australia. We will get our heads back on when we get back in. \n\"Even though we have won three out of three, we can probably go up again in terms of our performance. \n\"We've had a lot of tight games against Fiji, and some of the backs they have got are playing in quality teams in France and all over Europe. \n\"We knew they were going to come and throw the ball about, which is why we had to be alert for the whole 80 minutes in defence. \n\"If they (Australia) win on Saturday, it takes a little bit of pressure off going into that last game, but I am sure 'Gats' (Wales head coach Warren Gatland) and the coaches will want us to go full-hit against Australia and try to get that victory. \n\"We've had a couple of injuries which have maybe set us back a little bit, but I feel we are building, and now we have to keep trying to build the momentum. \n\"I suppose the team that wins the World Cup is the one that keeps building on each performance.\" \nAs at Twickenham, though, Wales' main area for concern proved to be the scrums, where Fiji enjoyed dominance. \nJenkins added: \"That was one of the best scrums we have come up against in a long time. \n\"They didn't surprise us. We knew how they scrummaged against England, and how good they are in that area. \n\"We have got a bit of work to do in that area, and we are not going to shy away from that.\" \nWales, having lost five of their original 31-man World Cup squad through injuries, did not appear to suffer any major problems in that department against Fiji, although lock Bradley Davies had his right ankle encased in an ice pack after the game.
