We played with emotion; and we have to do that. \n\"Last week was a team win, everyone played well, and we're trying to get better,\" Barden said. \"We're a team that, hopefully is getting better each week and our best football is still in front of us.\" \nThe Indians (6-1, 4-0 Region 8-AAAA) play host to Madison County next week. \nChestatee (0-7, 0-4) will play host to White County next week.
