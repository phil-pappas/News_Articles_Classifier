The Wamps hung tough for a half, before conceding a pair of goals to Billy Dorion in the second half en route to a 2-0 loss.\nA largely underclassmen group has used that game as motivation for this season and the results speak for themselves. Playing in the ever-competitive Bay State Carey, Braintree heads into the home stretch with an impressive 11-1-1 mark.\n“I thought we had a team capable of doing this,” Braintree coach Gary Burke said. “We had a lot of underclassmen starting on a team that went 10-6-4. Even now, we only have two seniors who start.”\nBurke has sold the Wamps on a team-first mentality. If you’re dressing, chances are good you are playing. In virtually every game, Braintree has played as many as 18-19 players.\n“It’s made us a deep team, one that can deal with injuries and fatigue,” Burke said. “By this point of the season, everyone pretty much knows their role.”\nIt has also led to a balanced attack as evidenced by the fact that Braintree had five scorers in one game and four more in another contest later in the week. Forwards Ryan Mangan and Vikiendios Zahopoulos lead the team in scoring, while Brian Carney and A.J. McMartin have come up with timely goals.\nThe midfield is sound with the quartet of Justin Phripp, Stephen Jameson, Anthony Rogers and Marco Carnes, while the defensive foursome features Liam Kelley, Liam Sage, Jason Reynolds and Jonathan Yeragotelis. James Fahey and Ben Burke (no relation) have been the keepers.\n“We’ve had tournament success in the past, so I don’t think the kids were happy how last year ended,” Burke said. “They expect to do better.”\nBoxers pound away\nLongtime Brockton boys coach Rick Robens joked that they don’t give awards for national rankings. They do, however, give awards for excelling on the pitch, and the Boxers appear primed to make some noise in the postseason.\nBrockton opened the season with one-sided wins over Catholic Memorial and Somerville and parlayed that success into an 11-0-2 record. Robens points to John Santos, Joe Cruise, Elvis Mendes and Michael Cruz for providing some much-needed leadership.\n“I think we have more direction with this team than we did last year,” said Robens. “We’ve also added some talented players which has helped a lot.”\nThe Boxers are averaging nearly four goals a game with Maldini Fonseca, Rilton Carvalho and Cam Frederick leading the way.\nMedway headway\nAny time you can put two future Division 1 girls players on the pitch as Medway can, you’re going to get recognized.\nMustangs coach Jason Rojee insists that Shannon Simmons (UConn commit) and Shannon Aviza (Syracuse) along with Sarah DiPillo, are just as valuable off the field.\n“They come to practice with such a positive attitude and their teammates notice it,” said Rojee, whose team is 10-1-1. “They are such coachable kids that they make my job easier. They’re always asking what can do they to make us better and it rubs off on the other players.”\nPositive attitudes are nice, but the ability to put the ball in the back of the net is even nicer. DiPillo leads the way in scoring with nine goals, while Simmons and Aviza have chipped in with timely goals.\nWhat makes the record all the more impressive is the fact Medway has done it without a full complement of players. Every time the Mustangs inch closer to getting everyone back from an injury, another player falls.\n“We’ve had games where we were missing four starters because of injuries,” Rojee said. “What it’s done is make us a deeper team because we are using more kids and they’re getting the experience.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T18:21:53.194+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
