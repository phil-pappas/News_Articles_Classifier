Saban knew his secondary needed help with Landon Collins and Nick Perry gone, so he moved Jackson back to safety and gave Jackson's old spot to redshirt freshman Marlon Humphrey.\nGeno Matias-Smith, the other starting safety, said Jackson was unsure of the decision at first. He had come in and started four games at cornerback as a true freshman in 2013 and looked to be a stalwart at the position for the remainder of his time in Tuscaloosa. But after starting another 10 games last season, Jackson had to learn to read offenses differently and undertake a new role on the defense.\nWith each passing game, Saban's move looks better and better. Jackson's switch to safety has solidified what had been a weak point on last year's team.\n\"I put my trust in coach Saban and the process,\" Jackson said. \"He's like a football guru so (whatever) he says you just have to run with it and play your hardest.\"\nIt was hard to know what to expect from Jackson at safety, but he's exceeded expectations through six games. He brings a different set of tools to the position than past Alabama safeties -- he's not an in-box hitter and is better in coverage -- and has helped a young group of cornerbacks. He added his team-best third interception Saturday night -- the only turnover the Tide forced against the Razorbacks -- and helped out multiple times in coverage. He hasn't been perfect, but he's an important piece to a defense that could be the best in the country.\nNot every player could transition the way Jackson has, but he had a little help. Veterans Reggie Ragland and Cyrus Jones coached him through the situation, and everyone benefited from it.\n\"I feel a lot more comfortable,\" Jackson said. \"Now, it's just more natural. We have a great secondary coach, coach (Kirby) Smart is a great defensive coordinator. Other guys always help me out with film and things like that.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T11:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T07:52:09.961+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
