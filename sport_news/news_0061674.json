Based on the calculations, the team is expected to go 48-34 -- a record that would have resulted in the Eastern Conference's fifth seed last season. \nThat would represent an eight-game improvement from Boston, which, like the math says, isn't out of the question. Before getting outclassed by Cleveland in the playoffs, the Celtics finished the regular season on a 24-12 rush, which would translate to about 55 wins over a full campaign.

Even if the Eastern Conference should be improved, there's plenty of reason to hope the Celtics can take another step forward during head coach Brad Stevens' third year. \nCARMELO also provided some interesting player comparisons, such as Marcus Smart to James Harden (whoa) and Jonas Jerebko to Scott Padgett (not so whoa).
