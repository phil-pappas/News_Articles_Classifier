Entering Saturday’s games, that was the highest average of any NHL forward this season, almost a minute ahead of Washington’s T.J. Oshie (21:33).\nPlaying a lot is nothing new to Kopitar, the Kings’ No. 1 center, but rarely do even the heartiest of forwards average more 20 minutes per game over long stretches. Kopitar, who averaged 19:23 last season, has played at least 21:25 in every game this season.\nPart of that is special teams. The Kings have had above-average numbers of power plays and penalty kills, but Kopitar is playing more than usual out of necessity. It gives the Kings their best chance to win.\n“We need to get a few more minutes out of our (other) centermen,” Sutter said Saturday. “(Kopitar) shouldn’t be a 24-minute guy in the long run. … Those (extra) four or five minutes should be going somewhere else. We need production out of those other four or five minutes.”\nJeff Carter, the No. 2 center, is another strong minutes-eater (17:27 per game) but behind him, the Kings have slotted Nick Shore and either Andy Andreoff or Jordan Weal, none of whom are established NHLers.\nCarter played 18:35 against the Wild, Shore played 10:56 and Andreoff played 7:59, and the disparity is even more pronounced in special-teams situations.\nMidway through the third period Friday, the Kings went on the penalty kill. Kopitar had an extremely long shift of 1:34 to help successfully kill the penalty. Just over two minutes later, Kopitar was back on the ice for a shift of 1:27. Then, Kopitar played 1:24 of the overtime, which lasted 2:19.\nSutter compared the situation to that of Drew Doughty last season. Because of injuries and ineffectiveness among Kings defensemen, Doughty averaged 28:59 of ice time, second-most among all NHL players.\nKopitar’s minutes aren’t sustainable, even for an elite center who is in strong physical condition. Sutter’s hope is that Kopitar’s teammates help ease the burden soon.\n“Some guys aren’t matching up,’’ Sutter said. “We’re at home, and I get to match up who we want (after faceoffs). What happens when we go on the road and we don’t?’’\nDAY OF REST\nMost of the Kings were given the day off from practice Saturday. That included defenseman Brayden McNabb, who looked to be injured Friday after a slap shot deflected off his foot.\nSutter said McNabb wanted to practice Saturday but that he told McNabb to take the day off.\nDefenseman Matt Greene, who missed Friday’s game with an upper-body injury, was a full participant in the optional practice, but it’s not yet known whether Greene is available for Sunday’s game against Colorado.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T19:36:08.948+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
