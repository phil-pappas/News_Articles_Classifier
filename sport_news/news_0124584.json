Lions defeated the Hamilton Tiger-Cats 40-13 on Friday night.\nWith the victory, the Lions (6-10) snapped a two-game slide while maintaining their hold on third in the CFL's West Division.\nJeff Mathews threw two touchdowns for the Tiger-Cats (10-6), but struggled for long stretches against a stout B.C. defence that created four turnovers, including two interceptions by Ryan Phillips.\nThe Lions temporarily found themselves outside the playoff picture when the Montreal Alouettes defeated the Toronto Argonauts 34-2 earlier Friday, but came up with a big effort after going just 2-7 over their last nine.\nThe Alouettes also sit at 6-10 and are battling the Lions and the Winnipeg Blue Bombers (5-11) for third place in the West by way of the crossover rule. Montreal must finish with more points than both B.C. and Winnipeg to earn the crossover.\nAfter the Tiger-Cats grabbed an early 6-0 lead on Mathews' 64-yard catch-and-run hookup with Luke Tasker that was followed up by a blocked extra point, the Lions forced the visitors into conceding a safety before getting their first big play of the night when Chris Rainey returned a punt 66 yards to Hamilton's 20.\nJennings found Shawn Gore on the next snap to make the score 9-6 after Richie Leone's convert.\nThe Lions forced their first turnover later in the quarter on Hamilton's 10-yard line when defensive lineman Mic'hael Brooks recovered a Junior Collins fumble after a strip by Zach Minter.\nJennings again struck quickly, finding Emmanuel Arceneaux on the next play to make the score 16-6 with the extra point.\nB.C. stretched the lead to 17 early in the second quarter when Jennings found Bryan Burnham on a 46-yard pass to set up Rainey's 25-yard circus TD that included a one-handed grab and a leap into the end zone.\nLeone's extra point made it 23-6 and he would add a punt single in the final minute to pad the lead to 18 at the break.\nThe Lions suffered an embarrassing 52-22 defeat in Hamilton in August and came in having blown late leads the last two weeks, but they didn't look back after halftime and increased their advantage to 27-6 on a 31-yard Leone field goal to open the third quarter.\nPhillips then picked off Mathews midway through the quarter before the Lions stopped the Tiger-Cats, who are fighting for first place in the East, on a third-and-short inside the host's 40-yard line.\nBut Hamilton defensive back Brandon Stewart intercepted Jennings in Tiger-Cats' territory to set up Mathews' 12-yard TD pass to Andy Fantuz that made it 27-13 with the convert.\nNeither team could do much on offence from there until the Lions sealed it on a drive midway through the fourth quarter that culminated with Harris' 15-yard touchdown run with 4:17 left to make the score 33-13 after Leone missed the extra point.\nPhillips then added his second interception of the night to set up Harris' eight-yard TD run with under two minutes to go.\n---\nFollow @JClipperton_CP on Twitter\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T03:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T08:34:19.781+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
