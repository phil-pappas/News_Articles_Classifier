Pictured are (from left) Kaylee Gaia, Jayna Choi, Coach Steve Bell and Baili Park. Jayna Choi will get the headlines. But Houston coach Steve Bell said it was a team effort that gave the Mustangs the AAA state golf championship Wednesday at WillowBrook Golf Club in Manchester.\n\"Baili (Park) was 1-under over the last 10 holes,\" said Bell. \"And Jayna was out of town for the regional, so without the score we get from Kaylee (Gaia), we don't even get to the state tournament. She's the reason we were here.\"\nAnd Choi was the reason they won.\nThe freshman shot a tournament-record 8-under 64 to capture the individual championship by a whopping seven strokes over two-time defending champion Aubree Jones of Brighton. The score was a 12-stroke improvement from Tuesday's opening round and gives Houston its second girls champion and first since Natalie Mitchell in 2008.\n\"There were coaches from Georgia, Auburn, MTSU all following her around,\" said Bell. \"She played well. The water got hot.\"\nChoi — the younger sister of former Houston standout Jacob Choi and a highly regarded junior golfer — gave the credit to her putter.\n\"I putted a lot better,\" she said. \"My dad came up, and he helped me figure out my stroke and I started to get the hang of it. I actually didn't know (how well she was playing), so I was kind of shocked (to get the record).\"\nBell said it could have been even better; an 18-footer for birdie on No. 18 just skirted the cup. Choi had two birdies on the front and added six more on the back, including three in a row on Nos. 15-17 as Houston won by nine strokes over Kingsport Dobyns-Bennett.\n\"I wanted a birdie, but I was happy with the par,\" Choi said of her final hole. \"But I'm really happy that we got coach Bell his first (team) title.\"\nPark, a sophomore, finished eighth overall at 6-over 150.\nHouston's Andrew Wood was the highest-placing local boys competitor, tying for 33rd at 9-over 153. Spencer Cross of Sevier County shot 10-under to win the title.\nST. AGNES JUNIOR STANDOUT COMMITS\nSt. Agnes junior Abby Heck has verbally committed to play at Notre Dame.\nHeck, who was the Pepsi Best of the Preps golfer of the year in 2014, captured the Division 2-AA West Regional title on Sept. 21, beating younger sister Rachel by one stroke. Abby will defend her state championship starting Tuesday at WillowBrook.", "external_links": ["http://media.jrn.com/images/200*150/Class+AAA+state+golf+championship.jpg", "http://media.jrn.com/images/Class+AAA+state+golf+championship.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-01T04:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T19:56:16.246+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
