(WVLT) -- Derrick Henry's 14-yard touchdown run with 2:24 left lifted No. 8 Alabama to a 19-14 victory Saturday over Tennessee. \nAlabama's aggressive defense then recorded two straight sacks and Ryan Anderson knocked the ball loose from Joshua Dobbs to preserve the win and the Crimson Tide's national championship hopes. \nAlabama (7-1, 4-1 Southeastern Conference) got plenty of help, with Tennessee (3-4, 1-3) missing three long field goal attempts. \nThe Vols took the lead on Jalen Hurd's 12-yard scoring run with 5:49 left. Alabama overwhelmed the 15-point underdogs from there. \nQuarterback Jake Coker moved Alabama downfield thanks to athletic catches by ArDarius Stewart and Calvin Ridley. Then he turned it over to Henry. \nDobbs and Tennessee managed a first down before the sacks. Anderson jarred the ball loose and A'Shawn Robinson recovered on the second one. \nAlabama has won the last nine meetings, and the Vols have dropped 24 straight against Top 10 teams.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T05:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T15:49:14.643+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
