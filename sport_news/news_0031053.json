Lot of high hopes for the Mocs this year and why not. They return nine players from a SoCon champion team that went 29-4 last year. But UTC faces a daunting non-conference schedule this year with the Lady Vols, Stanford, and U-Conn.Said guard Alicia Payne, \"We're really excited to play. We're really ready to start off the season that way because it will give us a lot of experience. Teach us a lot of things. I think it will help us later on.\" Said head coach Jim Foster-\"We make no secret that we would like to win some games in the NCAA Tournament. We'd like to advance.
