I have let trees die and taken water buckets from my shower using the water that would go down the drain while waiting for hot water, for what? Our conservation is being used against us! Please keep in mind that OID is using the guise of this water for fish. OID General Manager Steve Knell likes to sell water. He is responsible for the largest sale of water in the history of the US when he was employed by the Imperial Irrigation District (IID) which was a sale to San Diego of 300,000 Acre Feet of water from the Colorado River in 1999. This sale effected Lake Mead, the Colorado Water Basin, and was as far reaching as the Salton Sea. Now is the time to stand up and say “we aren’t going to take this anymore!” Congressman Tom McClintock has a bill that we all need to support: HR 2898, the save our water during a drought bill. This bill sits in the US Senate, please e-mail Sen. Feinstein & Sen. Boxer that you support this bill. California has not built one reservoir since the late 1970s and our population has almost doubled, we need to put pressure on all of our elected representatives. I mean all, our own Board of Supervisors, our State Representatives and Gov. Brown. Tell them to get busy and do the people’s work and build more water storage. The voices of the many is the only thing they will listen to, it is time to get active. Elaine St. John Attending TUD forum makes no difference To the Editor: The quote from Kristine Rice in Wednesday’s paper, “it’s disappointing to see the lack of public interest,” at the small turnout for TUD’s rate forum sure does not reflect my view. I am keenly interested in the coming attack on my small retirement income. Rather if reflects the knowledge that these so-called forums are merely a dog and pony show put on by what ever utility, TUD, PG&E, whoever, is getting ready to gouge us next. We could fill the room to its limit, and it wouldn’t make an iota of difference. They want more money, period. Beverley L.
