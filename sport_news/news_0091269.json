Schalke, Wolfsburg, Hertha Berlin, and Leverkusen round out the Top Six after the first 10 matches of the Bundesliga season. Dortmund 5 - Augsburg 1 \nSuarez nets hat-trick to push Catalans into second place In Spain, Eibar would take an early lead versus Barcelona, when Borja Baston scores in the 10th minute at the Nou Camp. But it becomes the Luis Suarez show from that point forward, as the Uruguayan finds the back of the net in the 21st, 48th, and 85th minutes. \nThe often-controversial striker accounts for all of Barca's scoring, as they survive a red card against Javier Mascherano, to jump into second place in La Liga.Both Real Madrid and the Catalans now have 21 points, but Los Blancos are well ahead on goal difference. Atletico Madrid beat Valencia to move into third place on Sunday, while Celta Vigo's loss to Real 24 hours earlier, dropped them to fourth. Giallorossi displace Violas at top of standings And in Italy, Roma would defeat first place Fiorentina 2-1, as the Giallorossi claim the top spot in Serie A all to themselves.So the team from the Italian capital now has a two-point lead over Napoli, Fiore, Inter Milan, and Lazio, who are all stuck on 18. And speaking of stuck, traditional powers AC Milan are currently in 10th place, while four-time defending champions Juventus sit in 12th.
