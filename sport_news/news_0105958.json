The teams try out reserves and different combinations. It is better that we don’t read much into it. They are one of the strongest sides in all the formats, not just in T20s,” India batsman Rohit Sharma said here today. When told that India have hardly played T20 Internationals after the World T20 in Bangladesh last year, Rohit said it wasn’t a cause of concern for the team. “I agree we have not played many T20 Internationals, but all of us have been playing in the IPL, so we will use that experience here,” he said. Rohit said the team will have one eye on World T20, which is just five months away, during the three-match series. “The World T20 is round the corner, so we have to make the most of these games. It will be a challenge for them (South Africa) as well, considering they too have not played a lot of T20 Internationals of late,” said the stylish right-hander. When asked how India were planning to face the visitors’ pace attack, Rohit said the unit was focussing both on spin and pace. “It is not only pace. They have got quality spinners too. They will be effective here. It is better to focus on all aspects,” he said, referring to the Imran Tahir-led spin attack. He went on to say that the frequent overseas tours in the last two years have helped the batsmen tackle pace better. “In the last couple of years, we’ve played mostly outside India. It has given us a lot confidence to handle pace, regardless of the conditions,” said Rohit. Talking about the game on Friday, Rohit said the team was better prepared than the South Africans, having arrived here a few days earlier than scheduled. “We have gotten used to the conditions. We came here early, have practised really hard in the last few days.” Asked about his role in the team, Rohit said he doesn’t care about criticism from outside and plays as per the requirement of the side. He also spoke about his seam bowling capabilities. “I definitely want to add something extra to the team. If you bowl a bit, the captain has an extra option. The wickets were seaming a lot in Sri Lanka during our recent tour, and I thought if someone could chip in with three-four overs, it would help the main bowlers. That is how I started to work on my bowling.” On the familiarity between the players of the two teams, thanks to the IPL, Rohit said “it works both ways”. “All these guys have been playing in the IPL for the last 5-6 years. They have faced our bowlers and vice versa. It cuts both ways, it’s both an advantage as well as disadvantage.” Asked about the captaincy style of MS Dhoni and Virat Kohli, he added: “Both are different. I don’t see adjusting (to their styles of captaincy) as a problem. Different individuals have different style of handling the team.” — PTI", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T10:04:16.906+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
