Catholic bishops were voting Saturday on a final document to better minister to families following a contentious, three-week summit at the Vatican that exposed deep divisions among prelates over Pope Francis’ call for a more merciful and less judgmental church. Alessandra Tarantino AP i \nWashington Post VATICAN CITY \nDeeply divided clerics at a landmark Vatican summit echoed the more inclusive tone of Pope Francis on Saturday, extending more welcoming language to divorced and gay Catholics but stopping short of calling for clear alterations in policy and leaving the extent of any change in the hands of the mercurial pontiff. \nThe meeting – known as a synod – marked the culmination of a two-year process to recalibrate the faith’s approach to families in the 21st century and broke new ground by tackling issues once considered taboo in the Roman Catholic Church. In the most significant pronouncement, the clerics cracked open the door for divorced and remarried Catholics, who the church teaches are technically living in adultery, to receive Communion – a sacrament from which they are currently officially barred. \nBut the synod did not explicitly condone a change either, leaving Francis room to interpret the will of his hierarchy. The document also recognized the “dignity” of homosexuals, while also saying there was not even a “remote” similarity between same-sex unions and “God’s design on matrimony and family.” \nThe final communiqué, while a significant bellwether of the hierarchy’s thinking, nevertheless amounts only to a recommendation to Francis. As pope in the benevolent autocracy that is Vatican City, Francis now has the final say. \nLiberals at the synod were pragmatic, saying they were impressed they got as far as they did given significant conservative resistance. But the staunch opposition to fast change suggested how difficult it may now be for Francis to translate his revolutionary style into substance. \nIt also puts him in a highly difficult position. If he fails to change the status quo, he risks disappointing liberal Catholics – as well as many non-Catholics – who have heralded him worldwide as an agent of change. Yet going too far beyond the recommendations could alienate many in his own divided church, triggering an even stronger backlash among conservatives – some of whom are already openly questioning the direction of his papacy. \n“What the pope has to do now is take all of this in and decide how to we use it,” said Cardinal Donald Wuerl, the archbishop of Washington. “He may decide to use bits and pieces in different ways.” Previously reported \nEven before the synod began, the Associated Press reported, there was the bombshell announcement by a Vatican monsignor that he was a proud, gay priest, had a boyfriend and thought the Catholic Church was homophobic. He was fired. \nA few days later there was a leaked letter by 13 conservative cardinals to Francis complaining about synod procedures and warning that the Catholic Church was at risk of collapse if bishops went too far in accommodating the flock. \nMidway through, the mudslinging spilled into newsprint when high-ranking cardinals publicly criticized one another. German-speaking bishops made their displeasure official by starting off their final, written set of amendments with a public dressing down of Cardinal George Pell, the Australian who spearheaded the conservative charge. \nAnd this week came the zinger: An Italian news report that Francis had a brain tumor. The Vatican vehemently denied the report and said it was aimed at suggesting that Francis’ health – and therefore his authority – was in question.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T00:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T01:48:28.674+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
