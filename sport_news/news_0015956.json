It wasn’t enough as the Royals rallied to a 6-3 victory in Game 2 of the ALCS.\nTroy Tulowitzki, who started Saturday’s action in a 2-for-25 slide, went 2-for-4 with an RBI double in the sixth inning when the visitors stretched a 1-0 lead to 3-0 but failed to add on.\n“It was a good day for Tulo, he has been taking a little heat,’’ Blue Jays manager John Gibbons said of his shortstop. “He is such a good hitter, it’s just a matter of time. Big at-bats today, that really got him going.’’\nAs for Encarnacion, Gibbons said before the game had it not been a postseason game, the designated hitter would have sat out.\n“He is a huge part of our lineup,’’ Gibbons said of the right-handed hitter who was hitting .286 (6-for-21) with a homer and three RBIs in six postseason games going into Saturday’s action. “If it was a normal game he would be in there but we need him and he will battle through it.’’\nAfter the loss that dropped the Blue Jays into a 2-0 hole, Gibbons was upbeat discussing Encarnacion.\n“No signs of pain, he had a good day,’’ Gibbons said of the DH who singled twice, fanned twice and drove in a run.\nEncarnacion left Friday night’s Game 1 for pinch-hitter Justin Smoak in the eighth inning. According to Gibbons, Encarnacion has been dealing with the problem for a while.\nGibbons wanted to get Chris Colabello’s bat into the lineup for Game 1 and started the right-handed hitter at first base. He could have used Colabello’s bat in Game 2 against another right-hander Yordano Ventura as the DH but opted with Encarnacion, who hit 31 homers and drove in 111 runs in the regular season.\nColabello, who started the game at first base, was leading the Blue Jays in postseason hitting with a .350 (7-for-20) average and had one of the Blue Jays’ three hits in Game 1. He went 2-for-4 with a double.\nRoyals catcher Salvador Perez battled a stomach virus, took a hard foul ball off the mask and was hit by a pitch in the left arm during the ALDs against the Rangers.\nSo, in Game 1 of the ALCS on Friday night Perez got hit on the left hand by Josh Donaldson’s back swing in the eighth inning of a 5-0 Royals victory. Of course, he stayed in the game.\n“The toughest guy I ever saw was Jason Kendall and Sal is right up there,’’ Royals manager Ned Yost said of his tough catchers. “It’s just amazing the beating he can take and rebound every day.’’\nPerez, who has three postseason homers in six games, went 0-for-4 Saturday.\nYost didn’t want to think about a Game 4 starter before Game 1 and wasn’t ready to name one before Game 2.\n“I am not sure yet but I will give you a hint. His first name is Chris,’’ said Yost, who will choose between Chris Young and Kris Medlen.\n“You ask these questions but right now, the first two days, my mindset is I am going to do whatever I need to win,’’ Yost said. “Whoever is available for Game 4 they are both great options. For me to name a Game 4 starter [Saturday], and I need him to win [Saturday] doesn’t make any sense to me.’’", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T00:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T05:51:41.172+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
