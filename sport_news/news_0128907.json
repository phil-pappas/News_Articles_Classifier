Center. After a Wednesday morning shootaround, he fielded more questions about the Hoosiers than his own game. \nThat's the result of sophomore Emmitt Holt's dismissal in September due to an alcohol-related citation – his second off-the-court incident — as well as a citation for freshman Thomas Bryant, a first offender who remained with the Hoosiers. \nThey were just the latest incidents in an offseason that has seen three IU players in all released from the program. Those measures came on the heels of other drug and alcohol-related issues with coach Tom Crean's roster since Oladipo's days in Bloomington. Cody Zeller to IU players: 'Hold yourself to a higher standard' \n\"Those guys got to be men,\" Oladipo said. \"They need to grow up. That's the biggest thing. That's what we did. They have to do the same thing. They've got to realize that there's something way bigger in jeopardy than going out and doing what they're doing.\" \nOladipo, the second overall pick in the 2013 NBA draft, played three seasons for the Hoosiers, guiding IU back to No. 1 in the nation during his time there. A troubled off-the-court culture didn't exist with Cody Zeller and Jordan Hulls heading up the program alongside the Maryland native. \nSo did that trio simply make better decisions? \n\"Yeah, you know what I mean?\" he said. \"Plain and simple, we realized it's much bigger than ourselves. We had fun. We were college kids and had fun, but we did it the smart way. We didn't do what they were doing, obviously. Some stuff they were doing is just crazy.\" \nOladipo said it shouldn't be up to Crean, who has received the brunt of the criticism while his team also took an early NCAA exit last season, to monitor players at all hours. What will IU basketball look like this season? \nInstead, the third-year pro gave all credit to Crean and his staff for his development in college. Oladipo came out of high school a three-star prospect but quickly transformed into an All-American deft on defense and explosive on offense. \n\"I improved drastically,\" he said Wednesday, and the job isn't done. A Magic starter and key piece to the franchise's turnaround, Oladipo averaged 17.9 points, 4.2 rebounds and 4.1 assists last season. He also poured in double-figure points as a rookie. \n\"I've gotten better. I feel better,\" Oladipo said. \"Things I need to improve on – just being precise and not making too many mistakes and taking care of the ball, things like that. \n\"As far as shooting the ball, it's going to go in sometimes and it's not going to go in sometimes. I'm just going to keep shooting with confidence.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T21:34:05.292+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
