(Aaron Josefczyk / AP) Associated Press \nJohnny Manziel's in-car argument with his girlfriend could lead to punishment from the NFL. Browns Coach Mike Pettine said Monday that the league is investigating the high-profile backup quarterback's domestic dispute last week. \nManziel was questioned by police in Avon, Ohio, after his girlfriend claimed he was physical with her when the two had a heated disagreement while driving on an Interstate highway. Colleen Crowley can be heard telling police on a dash-cam video that Manziel \"hit me a couple times.\" Manziel was not arrested and Crowley, who police said appeared intoxicated, did not press charges. \nManziel spent 70 days in a Pennsylvania rehab facility during the off-season for an undisclosed condition. It's not known if he is in the league's substance-abuse program. If he is and if he violated any conditions, Manziel could face additional fines or suspensions. \nNFL plans hearings on L.A. \nWith the prospect of a team or teams moving to the Los Angeles market, the NFL is planning public hearings in Oakland, St. Louis and San Diego as part of the league's relocation procedures. \nAccording to the NFL, the purpose of the hearings is to provide an opportunity for fans and others to ask questions and express their views directly to the league \"before any decisions are made\" about the moving of a club. Members of Commissioner Roger Goodell's executive staff will attend the hearings, which will be open to the public, with a free entry pass is required to attend. \nâ€”Sam Farmer \nBengals receive apology \nThe NFL Network apologized to Cincinnati Bengals players who were shown naked in the locker room during a postgame interview Sunday in Buffalo. A network reporter was interviewing cornerback Adam \" Pacman \" Jones after a 34-21 win, and the videographer's angle included the entrance to the shower area. Several players were shown naked in the background. \nSaints sign Forbath \nNew Orleans released kicker Zach Hocker and replaced him with former UCLA kicker Kai Forbath . Hocker missed two field-goal attempts Thursday night in a victory over Atlanta and a potential game-winner two weeks earlier against Dallas, a game the Saints won in overtime. Forbath kicked for Washington from 2012 until his release last month and has made 60 of 69 field-goal attempts in his career. \nSeahawks reinstate Coleman \nSeattle lifted the suspension of fullback Derrick Coleman imposed after his arrest last week following a car crash. Coach Pete Carroll said Coleman, who was arrested for investigation of vehicular assault and hit-and-run, could play Thursday against San Francisco. \nMariota has sprained MCL \nAn MRI exam revealed Tennessee quarterback Marcus Mariota has a sprained medial collateral ligament in his left knee, Coach Ken Whisenhunt said. Mariota did not miss a play after being injured on a hit by Miami defensive end Olivier Vernon during the second quarter Sunday, but the team still wants to gauge his mobility in practice this week before declaring him fit to play Sunday against Atlanta. \nEtc. \nNew York Jets wide receiver Quincy Enunwa was suspended four games by the NFL for violating the league's personal conduct policy, stemming from an incident last year in which he was arrested on suspicion of simple assault on his girlfriend at a New Jersey hotel. Domestic violence charges were later dropped in the case. . . . Rookie linebacker Shane Ray , Denver's first-round draft pick, is expected to miss a few weeks because of a sprained MCL in his right knee, and star receiver Emmanuel Sanders could miss a couple of weeks because of a bruised left shoulder. . . . Buffalo Coach Rex Ryan said the status of receiver Sammy Watkins (left ankle), defensive tackle Kyle Williams (left knee), offensive tackle Seantrel Henderson (concussion) and receiver Marquise Goodwin (ribs) is uncertain for the Bills' game against Jacksonville in London. All were hurt Sunday during a loss to Cincinnati. . . .
