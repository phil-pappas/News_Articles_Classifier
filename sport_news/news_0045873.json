Except the Indiana Fever.\nBriann January had 19 points and six assists and the Fever stole home-court advantage in the WNBA Finals with a 75-69 victory over the Minnesota Lynx in Game 1 on Sunday.\nMarissa Coleman added 16 points and the Fever hit all 16 of their free throws in a rematch of the 2012 finals. Indiana won Game 1 of that series as well en route to the franchise’s only championship.\n\"We just believe in one another,\" Fever coach Stephanie White said. \"We trust one another and we understand that no matter what happens through the course of a game, if we come together we’re going to put ourselves in a position to win.\"\nMaya Moore had 27 points and 12 rebounds and Sylvia Fowles added 21 points and 11 rebounds for the Lynx. But Minnesota missed eight of 23 free throws and turned over the ball 15 times to drop the opener.\n\"How do we lose that game?\" Lynx coach Cheryl Reeve said after her team held Indiana to 36 percent shooting. \"We just didn’t do the little things at key times.\"\nGame 2 in the best-of-five series is Tuesday night in Minneapolis.\nVeteran Tamika Catchings had 12 points, six rebounds and four assists for the Fever, who never got rattled by Minnesota’s boisterous home crowd. They outscored Minnesota, 22-12, in second-chance points.\nThe Lynx were 19-2 at Target Center in their playoff history, the best winning percentage in the WNBA. The last time they had lost at home in the playoffs was against the Fever in 2012.\nThis one followed a similar script, with the determined and gritty Fever absorbing several haymakers from the Lynx and pushing back each time.\nJanuary — the tough-as-nails daughter of a karate instructor — led the way. She knocked down two tough jumpers late in the third quarter when the Lynx had pulled within four points and was right there in the end to ice it.\nAfter the Lynx charged back to take a 62-61 lead with 4:28 to play, Coleman hit a three and scored on a back-door cut off an inbounds pass. Then January crossed over Anna Cruz, Minnesota’s best perimeter defender, for a layup and a 68-63 lead.\n\"I challenged Bri to lead this team,\" Catchings said. \"To lead us on the defensive end, to lead us on the offensive end. When she plays the way she knows how to play defensively, she gets under people’s skin so bad. It’s fun to watch.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T04:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T08:45:58.374+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
