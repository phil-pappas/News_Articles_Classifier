Whitney Fountain is used to doing things quickly. The Columbus HS senior is one of the fleetest athletes in the country; she was the nation's top-ranked indoor 300-meter runner last winter, and she set a PSAL record in the outdoor 200-meter dash in the spring.\nBut when Fountain started searching for a college program, she slowed down. Only after careful deliberation did Fountain select a school; the Daily News has learned that she verbally committed to Clemson two weeks ago.\n“When I went for my visit there, it was beautiful,” Fountain told the News. “They have great coaching. It felt like family.”\nFountain chose the ACC school over a host of other programs that desperately wanted her services. According to former Olympic gold medalist Derrick Adkins , who currently serves as the Director of Track and Field at the Armory in Manhattan , Fountain could have attended any school in the country.\n“She really had her pick,” he said. “She could have gone to what they call the ‘top-notch' track schools, like Texas or LSU . But this is a good decision for her.”\nFountain passed on other opportunities after visiting Clemson at the end of October. She said she met the school's president and fell in love with the campus. She added that she enjoyed the school's focus on academics.\nWhen she returned to the Big Apple , she made a list of pros and cons, matching the school up against other potential destinations.\n“I wanted to make sure I found the right school,” she said. “I felt good about Clemson.”\nClemson may not have the big-name stature of other programs, but Adkins, who ran for ACC school Georgia Tech in the late 1980s, said that the school will still provide Fountain with plenty of opportunities to continue her development.\n“It's a great athletic conference,” he said. “She'll face a lot of good runners. It's a very good fit.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T14:11:02.132+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
