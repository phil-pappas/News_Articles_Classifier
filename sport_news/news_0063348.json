Authorities busted the alleged dealer in Manchester who was in the United States on a visa.\nFederal agents discovered the shipment of drugs coming from Guatemala into the U.S. In an undercover sting operation, authorities delivered the heroin to the suspect parked outside the Mexican restaurant Cilantro.\nThey pulled the suspect over a few blocks away seizing the drugs and arresting him. Federal agents say they seized more than 80 pounds of heroin.\n\"Between Boston and New York, Canada. This is a bad place. Great place for skiing and it's a great place for drugs,\" said Hallie Lovett from East Rupert, Vermont.\nAuthorities say they arrested Diego Walther Anibal Mejia Paredes, who was allegedly in possession of more than $5 million worth of the drug earlier this month.\nFederal agents set up a sting operation outside Cilantro where they posed as a delivery person handing over 40 kilograms of heroin to the suspect. They say 1 kilogram is about the size of a loaf of bread and police don't believe there's a connection between the drugs and the restaurant.\n\"This situation is everywhere and can be anywhere,\" said Chief Michael Hall, Manchester Police.\nBut Hall says the suspect has family in the area and that could be why he chose Manchester for the hand off.\n\"Historically on occasion we have had these large quantities of drugs although nothing like this for heroin,\" said Tristam Coffin, former U.S. attorney.\nCoffin who's had a lot of experience dealing this drug cases like this. He says most heroin in the U.S. comes from Central and South America and is smuggled across the border. He thinks this amount of heroin may have arrived in Vermont, but was probably heading somewhere else coming from a big cartel.\n\"It could be some destined for Vermont but typically that quantity of drugs is something that will be destined for an urban area. Maybe Chicago, Detroit, maybe Montreal,\" said Coffin.\nCurrent U.S. Attorney for Vermont Eric Miller released a statement saying:\n\"I am extraordinarily proud of Homeland Security Investigations for developing the leads that produced this huge bust. I am equally pleased that HSI worked so well and so closely with its federal and state partners to prevent this heroin from reaching the streets.\"\nGovernor Peter Shumlin, D-Vemront, says busts like this help in the war on drugs in Vermont, but the fight's not over.\n\"You can buy this junk for 5 bucks a bag down south of U.S. and sell it 3 hours up the interstate for 20, 30 bucks a bag. So there's huge motivation for folks to bring this poison into Vermont and sell it to Vermonters,\" said Shumlin.\nThe suspect is charged with intent to distribute a kilogram or more of heroin. Experts say with the amount of heroin he was allegedly caught with, he faces a possible sentence of 10 years to life.\nRelated Stories:\nHeroin bust in Manchester", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T02:08:07.918+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
