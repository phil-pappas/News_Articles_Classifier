Wayne Valley, ranked No. 7 in The Record public Top 25, scored 22 unanswered points and fended off 14th-ranked Lakeland for a 29-25 victory. \nThe Indians’ remarkable comeback improved their record to 7-0, secured Wayne Valley’s first playoff berth since 2010 and significantly damaged Lakeland’s chances of qualifying for the North 1, Group 2 playoffs. \n“We know we can blow teams out,” said Wayne Valley’s Vin Tedesco, a senior linebacker. “We know we can come in and dominate. But this proved that we’re legit this year; that we can move on in the playoffs this year. If we’re down, we’re never out of the fight. \n“We really needed this because this is what the playoffs are like. We’re not going to be blowing teams out in the playoffs. … I prefer a win like this, where we were down and we came back, than just blowing a team out. I know my teammates are as tough as anything and never put their heads down. They grind and they fight.” \nTedesco led Wayne Valley’s defense with eight tackles, including four for losses. None of Tedesco’s tackles were bigger than his stop for a 1-yard loss on Lakeland’s fourth-and-1 play from its own 31, with 3:50 left in the game. \n“That hit was huge,” said Will Kearney, a senior running back/linebacker for Wayne Valley. “Everyone got chills down their backs from that.” \nKearney provided plenty of excitement on the previous drive. He scored a 13-yard touchdown up the middle, the eventual game-winner and Kearney’s second score of the night, to help give the Indians a 29-25 lead at the 5:15 mark of the fourth quarter. \nWayne Valley began its comeback early in the third quarter. \nThe Indians immediately responded to Lakeland taking a 25-7 lead with senior tight end Ryan Monteyne’s 30-yard touchdown catch from junior quarterback Grant Ferrauilo, who made his second straight start in place of injured senior Nick Goodwin (foot). \nOn Wayne Valley’s next drive, Ferrauilo found junior receiver Joe Scancarella for a 73-yard touchdown pass down the middle of the field to help cut Lakeland’s lead to 25-22 with 3:55 to go in the third quarter. Scancarella made an adjustment to an underthrown pass and broke two tackles before beating two Lakeland defenders to the end zone. \nNeither team scored on the ensuing seven drives, not until Kearney’s second touchdown. A 32-yard run down Wayne Valley’s sideline by junior tailback Nick Gould two plays prior to Kearney’s touchdown set up the score. \nGould led Wayne Valley with 83 rushing yards on 12 carries. Kearney finished with 68 yards on 12 carries. \nSenior quarterback Danny Mullin led Lakeland (4-2) with 145 yards on 22 attempts. He also completed 10 of 19 passes for 178 yards and two touchdowns. \n“We made one play [in the third quarter] and we got the momentum,” Wayne Valley coach Roger Kotlarz said. “It’s hard to get that momentum back, and we were able to keep it. And I thought our defense stepped up big-time at critical moments in the second half.” © 2015 North Jersey Media Group Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T07:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T08:32:44.469+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
