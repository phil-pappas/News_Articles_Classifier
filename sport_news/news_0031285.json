New Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp told the club's fans on Friday that the team will play at \"full throttle\" under him following his appointment as the successor to Brendan Rodgers. \n\"Winning is important, but so is how you win and how you play the game,\" Klopp said in a statement on the Liverpool website. \n\"I believe in a playing philosophy that is very emotional, very fast and very strong. My teams must play at full throttle and take it to the limit every single game.\" \nFormer Borussia Dortmund head coach Klopp, 48, was appointed on Thursday on a three-year contract following the dismissal of Rodgers, who was sacked last Sunday after three and a half years at the club. \nHis first game at the helm will be a trip to Tottenham Hotspur in the Premier League on October 17. \n\"It is important to have a playing philosophy that reflects your own mentality, reflects the club and gives you a clear direction to follow,\" Klopp added. \"Tactical of course, but tactical with a big heart. \n\"Liverpool has extraordinary supporters and Anfield is a world renowned home, with an incredible atmosphere. \n\"I want to build a great relationship with these supporters and give them memories to cherish. I hope we can feed off each other's energy and that we take this journey together.\" – AFP, October 9,  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T10:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T10:49:22.297+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
