(Sarah Phipps/The Oklahoman via AP) \nThe scene was a typical one at college towns across the country in the early fall. On a day designated for Homecoming, crowds gathered along the city’s streets, with parents bringing excited kids out to enjoy the first days of autumn and the sights of a parade before the day’s big football game. \nIn Stillwater, Okla., on Saturday, that festive scene turned horrific when a car plowed into the crowd, killing four people — including a 2-year-old boy — and injuring 44. Three died at the scene and the child, whose identity was not released, died of his injuries at Oklahoma University Medical Center Children’s Hospital, Stillwater police said. \nBabies and children made up an inordinately high number of those injured and, as of late Saturday night, five people remained hospitalized in critical condition, police told KOCO.com . Another 12, including six children, remained in six hospitals in the Oklahoma City-Tulsa-Stillwater area. Five children were among the 30 others treated and released from hospitals. \n“The parade was starting to wind down and my wife and daughter and I were standing at that corner about three minutes before it happened. The baby had just gotten fussy so we were beginning to leave when we heard a commotion behind us,” Zach Gray of Stillwater told NewsOK.com . \n“I saw people start running that way with hands over their mouths and blood draining from their faces. I knew something pretty wrong had happened.” Emergency personnel and spectators respond at the crash scene. (David Bitton/The News Press via AP) \nMegan Lantz of Ponca City, Okla., estimated for NewsOK that the car, a 2014 Hyundai Elantra, was traveling at more than 40 mph. \n“We were facing the parade and heard tires squealing and then started to hear the car hitting things and people and there was screaming and people running away. I think the car was going between 45 and 50 MPH, and it just barreled into everybody that was there.” \nGail Lamb described the shattered security she felt to the Tulsa World. “You think you’re safe at a parade,” Lamb said , “and you’re with your grandchildren, and you realize that they all could have been killed in the blink of an eye. Little kids were sitting all along that curb, getting the candy and everything. I just realize that they all could have been taken so quickly, when they were all so happy. This is a trauma they will never forget.” \nA 25-year-old woman, Adacia Avery Chambers, was in custody, suspected of driving under the influence. Her father said the incident was very unlike his daughter. \n“Everyone across the country is talking about it,” Floyd Chambers told NewsOK.com . “I still don’t believe it. I can’t wrap my brain around this. … This is not the person that’s my daughter,” he said. “I can’t imagine alcohol being involved. She is not an alcoholic, that I’m aware of. \n“This is just not who she is. They’re going to paint her into a horrible person but this is not [who she is].” Adacia Chambers was taken into custody. (Stillwater Police Department via AP) \nChambers said his daughter had moved to Stillwater about six months ago to live with her boyfriend and he believes she was on her way to a job “in the food industry” at the time of the crash. \n“We’re going to pray for those who have lost loved ones,” Chambers said. “And my heart goes out to those people and all of them who are injured. It’s just a bad thing. I know this isn’t something that she would have done deliberately. I know that. She’s not that person.” \nThe victims were identified as Nakita Prabhaker, a 23-year-old international student from Mumbai, India, and Bonnie Stone and Marvin Stone, both 65. \nThe Homecoming game went on as scheduled, with players taking a knee in prayer before kickoff and then beating Kansas 58-10 after the administration decided to go on with the game.

(Brody Schmidt/AP) \n“The first thing you do [when you hear about the tragedy] is call and find your family,” Oklahoma State coach Mike Gundy said after opening his postgame comments with condolences for the victims. “Football is something that’s not very important. When you hear of an incident like that, football is a nonfactor. You start calling to find out where your family is.” After spending most of her career in traditional print sports journalism, Cindy began blogging and tweeting, first as NFL/Redskins editor, and, since August 2010, at The Early Lead.
