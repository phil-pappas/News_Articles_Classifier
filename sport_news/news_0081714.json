(AP) — New Orleans Saints have decided to make a change at kicker, releasing Zach Hocker and replacing him with Kai Forbath, said a person familiar with the situation. \nThe person spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity on Monday because the roster move has not been announced. \nHocker missed two field goal attempts during Thursday night’s Saints victory over Atlanta, dropping him to 9-of-13 on the season. Two weeks earlier, Hocker had missed a potential game-winning field goal against Dallas, hitting the left upright. However, the Saints won that game in overtime. \nForbath had kicked for the Washington Redskins from 2012 until his release last month and has made 60- of 69 field goal attempts in his career. He hit 24 of 27 attempts last season. \nHe becomes the 10th Saints kicker under coach Sean Payton, who took over in New Orleans in 2006. The previous nine were: John Carney, Billy Cundiff, Olindo Mare, Martin Gramatica, Taylor Mehlhaff, Garrett Hartley, John Kasay, Shayne Graham and Hocker. \nHartley was one of the stars of the Saints’ 2009 championship season, hitting the game-winner in the NFC title game and then making three kicks from beyond 40 yards in the Super Bowl. While injured, Hartley was replaced by Kasay in 2011. Hartley returned in 2012, but was replaced by Graham in 2013 after having one kick blocked and missing another wide left in a loss at St. Louis. \nGraham remained with New Orleans through 2014, but Payton decided in the offseason to release Graham and open the job to a competition between a pair of young pros with no regular season NFL experience: Hocker, who kicked at Arkansas, and Dustin Hopkins out of Florida State. \nHocker won the job in the preseason. Hopkins, meanwhile, has replaced Forbath in Washington, hitting 10 of 11 attempts. \n___ \nAP NFL website: www.pro32.ap.org and AP NFL Twitter feed: www.twitter.com/AP_NFL Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T22:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T22:28:00.476+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
