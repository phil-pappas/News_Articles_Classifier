The sophomore back injured his knee on the first play from scrimmage against Tennessee. \nUGA stated the back's ACL is still in tact. \nSo far this season, Chubb has amassed over 700 yards and 7 touchdowns. \nThe Georgia back has no official timetable for return. The injury occurred in an upset loss to Tennessee in what should have been a bounce back game for the Dawgs. Georgia fell 38-31 to the Vols. \nSaturday not only cost the Dawgs their star player, but also their spot in the AP top 25. Copyright 2015 WALB .
