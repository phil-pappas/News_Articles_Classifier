Center in Louisville, Ky.:\n-- Shabazz Napier?\n-- Yes, Shabazz Napier.\n-- His biggest shot in a Heat game? As a member of the Orlando Magic.\n-- (Well, not real, but it was a game-winner, his 3-pointer with 3.5 seconds to play.)\n-- And with that, 0-2 in the preseason.\n-- Not that the score matters.\n-- Apparently we've found a team that actually needs an eight-game preseason.\nChris Bosh: 'It's all about rhythm right now' Chris Bosh finds his shooting stroke, but appreciates he has to score within confines of Heat offense.\nChris Bosh finds his shooting stroke, but appreciates he has to score within confines of Heat offense.\nSee more videos -- A lot to work through here.\n-- But also plenty of time to work through it.\n-- The absence of Hassan Whiteside opened all kinds of possibilities for old Heat friend Nik Vucevic.\n-- It was too much for much of the time for Udonis Haslem and Chris Bosh.\n-- So Chris Andersen started the second half in place of Haslem, after not playing in the first half.\n-- Haslem sat out the final two periods with a groin issue that is not deemed serious.\n-- Face it, without Whiteside, cohesion will remain an abstract for the Heat.\n-- Bosh was sublime with his jumper. It's back. He had 16 points at the intermission.\nNapier's late 3-pointer for Magic drops Heat to 0-2 in preseason Ira Winderman The bonding barbeque in Boca? The night of scorpions during the offseason get-together in Joshua Tree? That took care of the camaraderie.\nBut only now -- during an eight-game preseason schedule that seemed too long but might not be long enough -- can the continuity develop for the Heat.\nAnd it's...\nThe bonding barbeque in Boca? The night of scorpions during the offseason get-together in Joshua Tree? That took care of the camaraderie.\nBut only now -- during an eight-game preseason schedule that seemed too long but might not be long enough -- can the continuity develop for the Heat.\nAnd it's...\n(Ira Winderman) -- Goran Dragic still is trying to find his way in the Heat's push-it-and-go approach that has anyone and everyone advancing the ball.\n-- It's not what Dragic is doing, it's what he's not getting a chance to do.\n-- This was a step forward from Sunday, but still not sure what he's doing parked in the corner.\n-- The Heat's halfcourt offense had its moments when the Heat weren't turning it over.\n-- Of course, there were 16 first-half turnovers.\n-- The Heat attempted only three 3-pointers in the first half. Bosh made his two attempts, while Josh McRoberts had the other attempt, a miss.\n-- McRoberts had four first-half turnovers, but that is a case of his teammate getting in sync with his unique approach.\n-- Dwyane Wade asked out with 5:19 to play in the first period after bending his thumbnail backward while going for a steal. He was replaced by Gerald Green.\n-- Haslem again played as a fill-in starter so Erik Spoelstra could keep his second unit intact.\n-- At least for the first half.\n-- Spoelstra cautioned, though, that he is not tied to a specific five-man second unit.\n-- \"On a regular basis, I don't know. We'll see,\" he said. \"I know we're going to need everybody and that's the point of depth, to keep guys fresh, to put a lot of pressure on the opponent every single night.\"\n-- Still, Spoelstra again had Green, Justise Winslow, Mario Chalmers, McRoberts and Amar'e Stoudemire on the court to close out the first quarter.\n-- Green, though, didn't make it to the end of the first, forced to the bench with three fouls in the four minutes after he replaced Wade.\n-- That had Tyler Johnson entering for Green.\n-- The Johnson-Chalmers backcourt wasn't exactly fluid.\n-- Dragic was called for his fourth foul with 9:43 left in the third period, after just 18 minutes of game action.\n-- Stoudemire and Green both were called for technical fouls, meaning preseason checks that will have to be written to the league.\n-- The Heat had nine turnovers in the first quarter, including two apiece by Wade, Dragic and McRoberts.\n-- They then had turnovers on each of their first three possessions of the second period, with that backcourt of Johnson and Chalmers.\n-- Stoudemire was called for his technical foul in the second period for teaching Mario Hezonja some colorful English language after a Hezonja foul.\n-- Shabazz Napier said before the game he remains grateful for the Heat's veterans helping him to transition to the NBA last season. \"I think the experience of being among players like Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh and seeing them, how they continue to get better each and every year. To watch them be the professionals you see on television, to actually see it first-hand, I think that's the experience I'm definitely going to take out of it.\"\n-- Magic coach Scott Skiles on Napier, \"He working hard. He's fit in nicely. He can make a shot. He does a good job of kind of running the club for us. We're evaluating him. We're looking at him, watching him. We're going to watch him through exhibition and just kind of see where he's at.\"\n-- Spoelstra said his entire camp roster will soon be given time for exposure, with the next four games a pair of back-to-back sets, \"We'll have back-to-backs where some of those [main] guys won't play.\"\n-- The KCF Yum! Center was packed last season when the Heat played the Pelicans during the preseason.\n-- That, of course, also was when the Pelicans arrived with Louisville product Russ Smith and Kentucky product Anthony Davis.\n-- This time neither the Magic nor the Heat featured a player from the state of Kentucky.\n-- The Heat and the Magic would have been wise to split the difference and play this one in Yeehaw Junction.\n-- As it is, the teams meet again next Tuesday in Orlando, the second night of a back-to-back after the Heat play San Antonio at home on Monday night.\n-- Darrell Griffith, aka, Doctor Dunkenstein, presented the game ball before the opening tip.\n-- He's now a local restaurateur.\n Miami Heat Orlando Magic Goran Dragic Chris Bosh Dwyane Wade Erik Spoelstra Shabazz Napier", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-5615c0d6/turbine/sfl-miami-heat-orlando-magic-game-s100715", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-5615e6f3/turbine/sfl-chris-bosh-postgame-s100715", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-5615bff8/turbine/sfl-miami-heat-orlando-magic-blog-s100715"], "published": "2015-10-08T03:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T17:28:13.123+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
