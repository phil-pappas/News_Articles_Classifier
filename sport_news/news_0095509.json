(AP) - Edinson Volquez will start Tuesday's World Series opener for the Kansas City Royals against the New York Mets.\n\"It's a great honor to pitch in this game, especially pitching at home,\" Volquez said Monday. \"It's a great feeling.\"\nJohnny Cueto starts Game 2 on Wednesday. When the Series switches to Citi Field, Yordano Ventura will start Game 3 on Friday, followed by Chris Young in Game 4.\nNew York's rotation opens with Matt Harvey and Jacob deGrom in Kansas City. Noah Syndergaard and Steven Matz follow at Citi Field.\nVolquez was 13-9 with a 3.55 ERA during the regular season and 1-2 with a 4.32 ERA during three starts in the playoffs. He pitched six scoreless innings of two-hit ball to beat Toronto in the AL Championship Series opener. Volquez lost Game 3 of the Division Series against Houston and Game 5 of the ALCS.\n\"Volquez lined up perfectly for the first spot for us,\" Royals manager Ned Yost said. \"If we brought Ventura back for Game 1, he would have been a day early. We didn't want that.\"\nKansas City's rotation has Cueto starting Game 2 and a potential Game 6 at home, where he was 6-4 during the season. Cueto was 5-9 on the road.\n\"Johnny really feeds off the home crowd,\" Yost said. \"They really, really give him a lot of energy. He's pitched his best games here.\"\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
