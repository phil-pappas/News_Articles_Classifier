After snorting up the \"substance,\" the woman immediately starts cheering because everyone else around her is doing so. She clearly has no idea what in the world is going on in the game. It's like being asleep at a sporting event and then jolting awake and yelling out \"YEAH!\" because the rest of the crowd is going bonkers. This is ninja-like in the way she tries to fit in seamlessly in the crowd, despite have probably done something horribly illegal.\nWe're with the man who shakes his head at the end of the video. Really? Even if it's just a pixie stick or something, a baseball game is the place you choose to do this? And not even in, like, the bathroom, away from thousands of people? Whatever works, I guess.\n[Via @WRBolen ]", "external_links": ["http://t.co/mq4rKdNgG2", "https://twitter.com/WRBolen/status/653359376611172353"], "published": "2015-10-12T05:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T08:32:03.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
