They were beating us in the regular season and we were beating them in playoffs. That’s what makes the rivalry between the two schools pretty neat.” \nFrom 2000-2011, the Red Rovers had beaten Parkland in all five of its postseason showdowns and in five of its nine regular season games. \nAsked if he would trade in the last three regular season wins against the Trojans for three district wins against them, senior defensive end Daloni Caldwell aimed higher. \n“I would, but we have to do it both times, first and second,” Caldwell said. \nRELATED : Parkland football team excited for hostile environment at Easton \nWhile the postseason matchup this year isn’t guaranteed, an emotional Friday night battle is. \nParkland brings back more experience from last year’s game, but it knows Easton will still be hungry for payback. \n“Easton, they just reload,” Trojans offensive coordinator Frank Lane said. “Being from there and knowing what it’s like to play Easton football when you’re a kid and growing up watching your idols, they just reload. They’re tough, hard-nosed kids from every township that they’ve got.” \nBoth teams come in with a loss and with four weeks remaining in the regular season – and Freedom sitting atop the EPC South standings unbeaten – there’s plenty at stake. \nThe Red Rovers have played their best football coming off of a Week 4 loss to Central Catholic . The Trojans are hoping to do the same coming off last week’s loss to Liberty . \n“One thing you gotta understand is it seems like every team in this league has taken a night off somewhere along the line and not played their best football,” Shiffert said. “They’re high school kids, I think that’s the easiest way to say it. I don’t think Parkland played their best game against Liberty. They realize it and I’m sure they’re going to play a lot better this Friday.” \nParkland player to watch: Noel Brouse . The Syracuse commit is a two-way lineman and an imposing figure at 6-foot-5, 275 pounds. The Trojans had some issues up front on both sides of the ball last week – protection on offense and stopping the run on defense – but expect them to have those problems ironed out come Friday. \nEaston player to watch: Trey Bailey . The junior tight end has been one of quarterback Trey Durrah’s favorite targets this year, hauling in seven receptions for 112 yards and two touchdowns in four games. Playing a defense that will surely be geared up to stop the run, the Red Rovers have to be able to pass the ball in order to have success. \nParkland will win if … It can bring the heat from the start, something it didn’t do last week and it cost them. The Trojans are capable of being an explosive offense, they just need to show it consistently. They’ll also need to buckle down on defense and put last week’s results in the past. \nEaston will win if … It can find a balance of the run and pass on offense while taking care of business on special teams. Kicking and punting hurt them in last year’s district championship, some bad field position wiping out strong defensive play. The Red Rovers will be without kicker Jarrett Koose the rest of the year due to injury, so 5-foot-3 junior kicker Diego Santiago will be thrust into the spotlight.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T23:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T02:52:38.680+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
