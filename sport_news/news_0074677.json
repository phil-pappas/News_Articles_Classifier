But where would daughter Victoria be born?\nThe family's home is in Quebec. Their hockey home base is in Syracuse. And Tampa Bay was a logical option as well.\n\"It's unsure a lot. You need to try to focus,'' Marchessault said.\n\"When I was up there (with the Lightning), I was always keeping my phone on, ready to know what's going to happen. She was advanced in the pregnancy. Obviously, my head was a little here (in Syracuse with Alexandra),'' Marchessault said.\nMarchessault's career swirled as well. After establishing himself as a dominant AHL scorer the past four seasons, he earned so much confidence from the Lightning that the team trusted him to skate in two playoff games last postseason.\nIf Tampa Bay couldn't find a role for him to start this season, it was possible that another NHL team might claim him on waivers. Failing that, Marchessault could be ticketed for the Crunch, a team he led in scoring (24-43) last season.\nBut when it came time to finally lock in, Marchessault knew what to do.\nScore.\nIt's a plan that's always worked out well for him in the past, and one that should very soon return him to the NHL.\nMarchessault began the season with Syracuse and potted a pair in the Crunch's season-opening win Saturday at Lehigh Valley.\n\"It's been four years, I've done a lot of offensive production. So every year I've got to bring it up. I cannot let go one year because now you're going downhill,'' Marchessault said Tuesday. \"Every year I've got to beat what I did the year before. This is how you become a better hockey player.''\nThat sense of urgency will make the Crunch a much more dangerous team for as long as Marchessault sticks around. As the team's season begins, the 24-year-old has proven himself deserving of the very first chance that pops up in Tampa Bay.\n\"I've got a big role on the (Crunch). I know I've got to produce a lot of offense and play good everywhere. I had a really good year last year but I've got to keep going and I've got to make sure that if there's somebody that gets injured or something, I need to be that guy that wants to go up,'' Marchessault said. \"It's always a constant battle. It's not only them (Tampa Bay) that has a good team right now. We have a really good team. I'm really happy to be part of the Crunch right now. We have a good thing going on.''\nMarchessault and his wife decided to build the most important foundation of the season by having their child in the U.S. They already had a home ready to go in Syracuse, so they figured that would be the best choice for a base.\nJonathan left the Lightning camp in early October to join Alexandra here. On Oct. 5, she brought Victoria into the world.\nThings went very smoothly in that department, but Marchessault's hockey home was still up in the air. Despite his obvious NHL-ready skills, Marchessault was in the final group cut and he then passed through NHL waivers unclaimed.\nAnd the Lightning's parting message to Marchessault?\n\"You have a big role in Syracuse. You've got to go down and do what you do. For sure, we're going to see you back this year,'' Marchessault said. \"So hopefully I can be that first guy (up), and just be good here and win some hockey games with the guys here.\n\"They have the same team as last year and they went to the Stanley Cup (final). So, obviously there's no room up there right now. You have to keep working harder. When you're so close, you never know what could happen. You've got to keep believing, working hard and maybe good things will happen for you.''\nMarchessault has already seen how close he is to those types of aspirations. His season-ending time spent with Tampa Bay let him not only appreciate the great skills of young forwards like Tyler Johnson, Nikita Kucherov and Ondrej Palat, but also understand how it could be argued he's progressing along a similar path.\n\"All those players were here (Syracuse) one day. So maybe they adapt well to the NHL, they got their chances. So hopefully I'll have mine one day and keep going.\n\"They (the Lightning) are young. But the next few years for them they're going to have to make big decisions (in terms of contracts). Hopefully, it's going to open up something for me. Maybe things are going to open up this year for me in Tampa, and maybe it's going to be next year. So, we'll check it out.''\nContact Lindsay Kramer anytime: Email | Twitter | 315-470-2151", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/LindsayKramerPS"], "published": "2015-10-14T03:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T07:33:46.956+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
