We want to be a good team, and those are things we have to count on having every night.”\nLopez is right, but what the Nets are going to need every night to be competitive is for him to play like an All-Star. And Thursday he looked every bit the part.\nHe may have wound up with a similar stat line to Drummond, who finished with 14 points and 11 rebounds, but there was little doubt who had the bigger impact. Lopez’s mere presence in the pick-and-roll allowed Shane Larkin and Donald Sloan — who split the point-guard minutes with Jarrett Jack (rest) sitting out — to get wherever they wanted on the court.\nEach found Lopez multiple times for wide-open mid-range buckets after the defense collapsed on them after they went around one of Lopez’s screens.\n“That’s deadly,” Sloan said of running the pick-and-roll with Lopez. “That’s what you want to have out there every time, because you make them dictate what you can do.”\nBut it wasn’t just offensively where Lopez’s impact was felt. He also played well on defense, forcing Drummond into some tough shots and helping the Nets put together a far better defensive showing than they did in Monday’s loss to Fenerbahce.\n“We had a lot of energy,” Lopez said. “We tried to be in the right places, and when we weren’t we recovered by playing hard, and we made up for a lot of mistakes.”\nLopez received a three-year max contract this summer, after the Nets kept him at the trade deadline once Oklahoma City turned down a deal that would have seen the Nets send Lopez to the Thunder for a package built around point guard Reggie Jackson. The Thunder moved Jackson to Detroit as part of a three-team trade instead.\nIt was a wise deal for the Nets not to make. They wound up getting Thaddeus Young for Kevin Garnett at the deadline in a separate deal. Young and Lopez helped the Nets stretch run to the eighth seed in the East, and both free agents were re-signed this summer to build around.\nThe Nets re-signed Lopez, in part, with the hope his second half — he posted numbers of 19.7 points, 9.2 rebounds and 1.8 blocks while shooting 52.5 percent from the floor — was proof he was capable of carrying them into contention this season.\nPlaying against Drummond who, either this month or next summer, will get a max contract of his own, there was no doubt who was better. If the Nets are going to be the competitive team Lopez hopes they can be, they will need that kind of showing from him on a nightly basis.\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google Whatsapp Email Filed under brook lopez ,  brooklyn nets", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T04:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T12:59:47.816+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
