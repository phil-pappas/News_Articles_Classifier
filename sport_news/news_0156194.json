The development that has received scant attention, and even Naughton is more focused on the Ramblers' receivers.\n\"They are hiding him,\" said Naughton, who coaches Loyola's receivers. \"That is our secret weapon.\"\nFive games into the season, the secret's out.\nHelfgot's football blog: The fantastic four games yet to be played Mike Helfgot In the blink of an eye, five games are in the books, which means a majority of teams (those that miss or exit early from the playoffs) have reached or surpassed the midway point of the season.\nHomewood-Flossmoor and Loyola, Riley Lees and Michael Johnson, the East Suburban Catholic and the West...\nIn the blink of an eye, five games are in the books, which means a majority of teams (those that miss or exit early from the playoffs) have reached or surpassed the midway point of the season.\nHomewood-Flossmoor and Loyola, Riley Lees and Michael Johnson, the East Suburban Catholic and the West...\n(Mike Helfgot) The 5-foot-7 1/2 Laja will burn defenses more concerned with containing Loyola's four receivers. Focusing on Laja rather than quarterback Emmett Clifford and his four 6-3-or-taller receivers has proven ineffective as well.\n\"We weren't effective at either,\" said Fenwick coach Gene Nudo, whose team lost to Loyola 54-16 in Week 4.\nLaja has rushed for 514 yards and 10 TDs on 76 carries this season, which is something for a complementary threat to Clifford (65-of-95, 974 yards, 14 TDs, one tipped interception), Thomas Smart (23 catches, 379 yards, 5 TDs) and Loyola's spread passing attack.\nKnown for their defense since former NFL linebacker John Holecek became head coach in 2006 — Loyola has 31 shutouts in that time — the No. 2Ramblers have been about as close to perfect offensively as a team can be.\nThey've scored 26 touchdowns in the first half of games. They're not sure the exact number of first-half possessions they've had, but the consensus on the number that did not end in the end zone is no more than five.\nPrep football: Senior moments spur Conant Bob Narang Late during Tuesday's practice, Conant coach Bill Modelski stepped back from his normal routine to chat with some outside observers.\nInstead of stressing over every detail for Saturday's showdown at No. 11 Barrington, Modelski allowed his assistant coaches and players to handle the final 20 minutes...\nLate during Tuesday's practice, Conant coach Bill Modelski stepped back from his normal routine to chat with some outside observers.\nInstead of stressing over every detail for Saturday's showdown at No. 11 Barrington, Modelski allowed his assistant coaches and players to handle the final 20 minutes...\n(Bob Narang) The second half has been for the second team.\n\"Even when I thought they were pulling off, they're not capable of it, because their kids are so well trained,\" Nudo said. \"This is easily the best Loyola team we've seen. They are very, very good all the way around. Everybody knows John is a great coach. This group is really attuned to what they're trying to do.\"\nThe offense has been so good that Holecek even credits it for a defense that's allowing six points a game.\n\"We've jumped on people early,\" he said. \"It really helps the defense when teams don't have time to commit to the run.\"\nThe Ramblers have more FBS recruits than normal — receiver Eric Eshoo is going to Northwestern to play tight end, defensive tackle Ben LeRoy is headed to Northern Illinois and long-snapper John Shannon is a Notre Dame commit — but it's a typical Loyola team.\nLoyola has won at least 11 games every year since 2008 with captains like Laja and Clifford and center Sam Badovinac — undersized, ignored by major college coaches, hoping to play for a Northeast school with a major academic reputation.\nAnd unaware of personal statistics.\n\"Once the season started, I kind of forgot about it,\" Laja said. \"My thing was, if I play how I can play and have a good season, it will come. When the time is there, I'll be a little more excited about it.\"\nMike Helfgot is a freelance reporter for the Chicago Tribune.\nPrivacy Policy Copyright © 2015, Chicago Tribune High School Football Loyola Ramblers High School Sports Sports", "external_links": ["http://www.tribpub.com/privacy-policy-and-your-privacy-rights/", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-560dc32d/turbine/ct-spt-1001-prep-fb-helfgot-blog-20150930", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-560ca734/turbine/ct-spt-1002-prep-fb-feature-loyola-20151001", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-560ca44b/turbine/ct-spt-1002-prep-fb-feature-conant-20151001"], "published": "2015-10-02T02:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T15:36:45.119+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
