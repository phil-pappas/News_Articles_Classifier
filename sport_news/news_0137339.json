Please know you'll be accepted by your brothers in the sport of men's basketball.\" \nCoach K and Burns will cross paths soon. Bryant opens its season against the defending national champion Blue Devils in November. \nThis video includes images from Getty Images.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T04:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T09:14:08.196+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
