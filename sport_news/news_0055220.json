DryHop head brewer Brant Dubovick will have the same role at Corridor.\nFood options include the aforementioned flatbreads, sandwiches and entrees such as Flemish stew, fish and chips, and Cornish hen.\nCorridor Brewery & Provisions, 3446 N. Southport Ave., will open at 5 p.m. Oct. 15, then be open for normal daily hours 11 a.m. to midnight beginning Oct 16.\nPrivacy Policy Copyright © 2015, Chicago Tribune", "external_links": ["http://www.tribpub.com/privacy-policy-and-your-privacy-rights/", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-5612e98a/turbine/ct-corridor-brewery-opening-chicago-20151005"], "published": "2015-10-05T23:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T10:55:24.598+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
