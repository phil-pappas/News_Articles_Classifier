The Wildcats have lost nine of 10 games at William & Mary with their only win coming 17 years ago when Jerry Azumah broke the Division I-AA rushing record and current head coach Sean McDonnell was the offensive coordinator. \"We're aware of it,\" said sophomore safety Nick Marino. \"It actually acts as a motivator.\" The Wildcats are 4-14 all-time against the Tribe — although they have won two of the last three meetings — and 0-6 in Williamsburg under McDonnell. \"The biggest thing for us is it's a new year and a new group,\" he said. \"We've got to go down there and play.\" No. 19/20 UNH (3-2, 1-1 CAA) will try to forget about the past Saturday (12, CSN) when it takes on No. 24 William & Mary (3-2, 2-1 CAA) in a critical Colonial Athletic Association matchup. The Wildcats beat the Tribe, 32-3, last year at Cowell Stadium. William & Mary prevailed, 17-0, two years ago in Williamsburg. \"The second half of the season will determine what we do and where we're going,\" McDonnell said. \"This is a target game for us.\" For the Wildcats, the bye week couldn't have come at a better time. They needed to improve on the field and they needed to get healthier off it heading into the meat of their CAA schedule. The biggest plus could be the return of senior quarterback Sean Goldrich, who missed the last three-plus games with a high ankle sprain. As of Wednesday, and barring any unforeseen circumstances, he is expected to start Saturday. \"If he's healthy, he's going to play,\" McDonnell said. \"None of us are going to know how good he really is until he puts a foot on the ground and naturally reacts on Saturday.\" Goldrich is 18-7 as a starter, including 7-1 in CAA road games with the one loss being the shutout in 2013. \"He's our leader,\" said junior offensive tackle Andrew Lauderdale. \"He's a big part of our team.\" Goldrich had to watch as backup QB Adam Riese led the Wildcats to back-to-back home victories over Central Connecticut State and Elon before the break. Lauderdale is also expected to return after missing the last two games following arthroscopic knee surgery. \"The knee is 95 percent healthy,\" he said. William & Mary, which played four of its first five games on the road, is coming off a 38-16 win at No. 14 Villanova last week. After falling behind 10-3, the Tribe scored 35 unanswered points. Their two losses have been by a combined seven points (36-29 to Virginia and 24-23 to Delaware). \"They're close to being undefeated,\" McDonnell said. The teams' only common opponent thus far is Stony Brook. William & Mary blanked the Seawolves, 21-0, the week after Stony Brook defeated UNH, 31-6. William & Mary ranks first in the CAA in scoring defense and third on offense. The defense is anchored by linebacker Luke Rhodes and safety DeAndre Houston-Carson, whose 94-yard interception return for a touchdown changed the complexion of last week's game against Villanova. \"This is a really complete football team,\" McDonnell said. \"They never put themselves in bad situations.\" The Tribe average slightly more than 192 yards rushing per game which is about what UNH gives up. They've had a 100-yard rusher in 10 straight games. William & Mary has scored 11 touchdowns of 30 yards or more this season, and nine plays from scrimmage have gained at least 40 yards. \"They use their run game set up their pass game down the field,\" Marino said. \"The key for us is being able to stop their run game and limiting their (explosive) plays.\" By Al Pike", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T07:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T11:55:57.895+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
