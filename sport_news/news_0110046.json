The Wallabies won the match 35-34, after Foley's decisive kick 43 seconds from time. \nWorld Rugby has now said that, having reviewed the incident, the \"appropriate decision was a scrum to Australia for the original knock-on\" and not a penalty. \nThe statement reads: \"The selection committee confirms that Joubert applied World Rugby Law 11.7 penalising Scotland's Jon Welsh, who had played the ball following a knock-on by a teammate, resulting in an offside. \n\"On review of all available angles, it is clear that after the knock-on, the ball was touched by Australia's Nick Phipps and Law 11.3(c) states that a player can be put on-side by an opponent who intentionally plays the ball. \n\"It is important to clarify that, under the protocols, the referee could not refer to the television match official in this case and therefore had to rely on what he saw in real time. \n\"In this case, Law 11.3(c) should have been applied, putting Welsh onside. The appropriate decision, therefore, should have been a scrum to Australia for the original knock-on. \n\"Overall, it is widely recognised that the standard of officiating at Rugby World Cup 2015 has been very high across 44 compelling and competitive matches to date.\" \nWorld Rugby high performance match official manager Joel Jutge said: \"Despite this experience, Craig has been and remains a world-class referee and an important member of our team.\" \nWorld Rugby has announced the names of the referees for this weekend's semi-final matches. \nFrenchman Jerome Garces will officiate the Twickenham semi-final on Saturday between South Africa and New Zealand, while Englishman Wayne Barnes takes charge on Sunday between Argentina and Australia at the same venue.
