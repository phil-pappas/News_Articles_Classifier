You suspect his legal troubles are just beginning.\nThis is, bottom line, a horrible black eye for St. Pius, one of the worst for the Catholic school since the shaved-down helmet buckle incident against Albuquerque Academy about 20 years ago that made national headlines.\nAnd if St. Pius believes this story is going away, it isn’t.\nClearly, the school has already circled the wagons, steering coaches and athletes away from media inquiries. That was to be expected, and to a degree, it’s understandable. After all, St. Pius’ administrators are paid to look after their students. This has to be hurting them, too, to have their school’s filthy laundry trotted out for all to see.\nBut the school did not help its cause, not one iota, when it threatened to eject Journal reporter Mark Smith from the campus earlier this week. Mark was making inquiries with parents at a girls soccer game, an NMAA-sanctioned public event to which he was fully and properly credentialed. Threatening to physically remove him looks just terrible for St. Pius, not to mention it interfering with a reporter’s First Amendment rights.\nHere’s the thing St. Pius might be wise to remember: The more it looks like they’re trying to brush this under the carpet, the more the media’s interest will be piqued.\nAnd we’re not done investigating, not by a country mile.\nTo that end, private school or not, it would behoove St. Pius to stand up and answer a few questions. That would be counterintuitive to their natural instincts, I grant you, but it possibly could be the most beneficial. Especially after the school – and some of its athletes – spoke so glowingly about its drug-testing program and punishment procedures in an enterprise story the Journal published just prior to the start of this athletic season.\nSomebody – Principal Barbara Rothweiler, athletic director Jim Cook (who made some odd comments to Smith the other day, which didn’t help matters for St. Pius), and perhaps even head football coach San Juan Mendoza himself – needs to get out in front of this before this gets any uglier.\nAnd believe me, this has the potential to go even further south on St. Pius than it already has.\nA prepared statement by Rothweiler earlier this week was disappointingly bland, and, from our seats here, not quite adequate.\nShe spoke generally of an “incident” and students being “dealt with” and falling back on the ubiquitous “confidential matter concerning students who are minors.”\nHere is the problem with that statement:\nIt does not speak to the much larger issue of possible drug use at St. Pius. Moreover, it does not speak to the drug-testing policy that is currently in place, and whether or not it needs tweaking in light of what has happened with the younger Mendoza.\nThe details in his police report make this a news story with legs. St. Pius, much as it might try, won’t be able to cut those legs out from under anyone.\nBEAN COUNTING: You must credit Atrisco Heritage coach Patrick Johnson for making one of the smartest strategic decisions of the season. In Week 3, he pulled Aaron Bean out from behind center and turned him into a running back, which is a natural position for Bean.\nThe results have been solid for the Jaguars, who are tied with West Mesa for the lead in District 5-6A.\n“We wanted to have Aaron where we could throw him the ball or get him on the run,” Johnson said.\nIn open space, Bean is as efficient and explosive as any back in 6A. He could be the difference-maker in terms of who wins this district when Atrisco and West Mesa square off Oct. 30.\nPLAYOFF TALK : Before this past week’s round of games, I had it in my head that the 12 playoff teams in Class 6A would be as follows: Cleveland, Rio Rancho, Volcano Vista and Cibola from District 1, Las Cruces and Mayfield from District 3, the District 5 champion, the top three teams from District 4 and the top two teams from District 2.\nSandia’s very impressive and timely upset of Eldorado changes the paradigm.\nFor the moment, it seems clear that the top three from District 2 will all reach the postseason, and only the top two from District 4. Which puts extreme emphasis on this coming Friday’s game between Hobbs and Clovis.\nTo see my latest blog projecting the entire top 12 in Class 6A, you have to get it on our website, ABQjournal.com/sports .\nI won’t have playoff projections here in the physical paper for a couple of more weeks.", "external_links": ["http://main.abqjournal.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/YODICE-James_2012-175x168.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-18T06:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T13:33:23.790+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
