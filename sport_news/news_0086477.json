Down 1-2 and most of the batsmen struggling for form and consistency, the beleaguered skipper is faced with the danger of losing a home ODI series. It would be India’s second straight loss after the 2-1 defeat against Bangladesh earlier this year. The biggest problem the hosts are facing going into the must-win match is their unstable batting order. The team seems a little confused on this front, with the skipper himself admitting that they are yet to figure out as to who were the ideal players to occupy No. 5, 6 and 7 spots. With an ageing Dhoni preferring to bat up the order, Ajinkya Rahane is yet to find his mojo at No. 5 or 6. Dhoni’s deputy Virat Kohli finally got some runs (77) in the last game, though it came in a losing cause. While Kohli started scoring once he got back his preferred No. 3 slot, it was, though, an ordinary knock in which he struggled to rotate the strike, Rahane failed to contribute after being demoted to No. 6. Suresh Raina is another player who has struggled in all the three matches. Having scored just three runs from three matches, the left-hander is going through a lean patch, which has increased the pressure on the other batsmen. While Rohit Sharma seems to be in the form of his life, his opening partner Shikhar Dhawan is going through a rough patch — he has managed only 59 runs in three matches. Strangely, Dhawan has scored three centuries in his last three Test matches but he has failed to carry that form into the shorter format. With Dhoni shuffling the batting order constantly so far in the series, it will be interesting to see what combination he opts for in the must-win game tomorrow. South Africa, on the other hand, are on the top of their game, having won the T20I series and the two ODIs so far. For them, AB de Villiers and Faf du Plessis are in good form. At Rajkot, opener Quinton de Kock scored a century to mark his return to form, making the South African batting even more menacing. Mishra available for the game: Harbhajan Beleaguered leg-spinner Amit Mishra is “available” for the fourth ODI tomorrow. “Amit Mishra is available for tomorrow. If the management feels he should be playing, he will play,” said Harbhajan Singh. A police complaint has been filed against Mishra in Bangalore by a woman, alleging that the cricketer abused and assaulted her. Harbhajan said that the incident does not affect Mishra’s place in the team. Mishra, who played the Kanpur and Rajkot ODIs, has to appear before the court to give his version of the story. Harbhajan, though, was not sure if R Ashwin, who suffered a side strain during the Kanpur ODI, would be available for tomorrow’s game. “I do not know what his fitness is like. Obviously, having him fit will be great for the team.” — Agencies", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T04:01:52.308+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
