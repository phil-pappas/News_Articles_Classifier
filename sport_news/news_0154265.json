After Morgan Clark and Rachel Johnson graduated, Malapit put a lot of pressure on herself to be the one to make it to state. \nNow that she qualified after shooting a 75 at the Lapel Regional last week, she can just play. But she did say the pressure was kind of a good thing. \n“In the first few matches (this season), I was pretty nervous because a lot of people were relying on me to play well,” Malapit said. “But that kind of made me play better, because I had so many supporters behind me. There were a lot of people following me in the paper, and they’d come up to me and say, ‘Good job yesterday,’ or whatever. That just kind of motivated me.” \nThat’s worked for her. Malapit has just one nine-hole score in the 40s this season and no 18-hole scores in the 80s, trimming five strokes off her average from her sophomore season. She shot 74 to win the Central Sectional two weeks ago. That 91 she shot at the New Castle Regional last season seems like a long time ago.

This year she’s the only ECI qualifier, and she’s on a course that she’s played several times before but hasn’t been able to score the way she wants. \nThat’s why Malapit is going to try to slow her rounds down this game, at least mentally, after she kind of got away from it last weekend. \n“I’m just going to play hole by hole and shot by shot,” Malapit said. “I think at regionals, I looked at more of a total score. Like when I said a ‘bad 75’ in the newspaper the other day, I really did mean it, just because my mental game was off. That’s key for tournaments as big as state. You need to go hole by hole and shot by shot and go from there.” \nContact sports features writer Ryan O’Gara at (765) 213-5829.
