Chris, who also played at Stanford, was asleep when it happened. \n\"Those late games, East Coast people, I don't know how they do it,\" said Chris Owusu, who is from California. \"I had to get some rest and get back to training early [Friday]. I was asleep, unfortunately.\" \nHe did get to see the catch before Friday morning, though. \n\"I woke up in the middle of the night [around 4:40 a.m.],\" Owusu said. \"I was a little dehydrated, so I went to get some water, and saw some text messages, more than usual.\" \nThose text messages alerted Owusu about his brother's catch. So he searched on his phone and found video of it. He was stunned by what he saw. \n\"I had to check it out for myself,\" Owusu said. \"It was as unbelievable as everyone said it was. I watched it several times, and it got better and better as I kept watching it.\" \nHe texted Francis a congratulatory message in the morning. \n\"I was too tired to type [immediately after watching the catch],\" said Owusu, who played at Stanford from 2008-11. \"I wanted to just give him some love in the morning, and let him know how proud I was of him, and just keep it going.\" \nHis message to his younger brother focused on \"just how amazing the catch was,\" Owusu said. \"Didn't want to give him too much [praise]. But I wanted to let him know that it was an amazing catch, and I was proud of the way that he was able to track the ball, despite, at the last second, his head being away from the ball. His concentration, his hand grip to be able to hold that ball, especially with another person in between, was pretty extraordinary.\" \nDid he get any trash talk in return from Francis? \n\"Nah, he didn't talk any trash,\" Owusu said with a smile. \"He knows better.\" \nOwusu, who had been the Jets' No. 3 receiver, is coming off arthroscopic knee surgery. He is listed as doubtful to play in Sunday's home game against Washington. It would be his third consecutive game missed. In his two games played this season, he has four catches for 55 yards. \nHere's another look at his younger brother's crazy catch: \nFRANCIS OWUSU. Quite possibly the greatest catch EVER.
