(Photo: USA TODAY Sports) No. 7 Michigan State 27, No. 12 Michigan 23 \nANN ARBOR, Mich. - Jalen Watts-Jackson grabbed a flubbed punt and lumbered 38 yards into the end zone for a touchdown on the final play of the game, giving No. 7 Michigan State a shocking 27-23 win over No. 12 Michigan in one of college football’s most unlikely endings. \nWith the Wolverines ahead 23-21 and 10 seconds left, Michigan punter Blake O’Neill bobbled a low snap, and spun around to try and make the kick. But he was hit, the ball popped free and Watts-Jackson caught it, broke a few tackles in the final yards and made it into the end zone. \nMichigan State improved to 7-0, 3-0 in the Big Ten. Michigan fell to 5-2, 2-1. No. 1 Ohio State 38, Penn State 10 \nCOLUMBUS, Ohio - J.T. Barrett played finisher for Ohio State, running for two red-zone touchdowns in the first half and then taking over full-time for Cardale Jones in the third quarter, as the top-ranked Buckeyes played another round of quarterback roulette in a 38-10 victory against Penn State on Saturday night. \nWearing black uniforms for the first time, the Buckeyes didn’t look like themselves, though they did look a lot more like the dominant team many expected the defending national champions to be this season. \nOhio State (7-0, 3-0 Big Ten) still doesn’t have a definitive answer at quarterback, but the Buckeyes have a 20-game winning streak. \nBarrett added two fourth-quarter touchdown passes to make it 38-10 and draw chants of “J.T.! J.T.!” from the blackout crowd of 108, 423 for Dark Night in the Shoe. \nJones started, as he has all season, but was only 9 for 15 for 84 yards. Barrett, as he did last week, entered when the Buckeyes got inside the 20 in the first half and helped Ohio State complete three trips there with touchdowns. After two unproductive third-quarter series, Jones was benched. \nFreshman Saquon Barkley provided most of the offense for Penn State (5-2, 2-1) with 194 yards rushing. \nOhio State coach Urban Meyer seemed to find a two-quarterback combination last week with Jones playing the big part of the field and Barrett taking over inside the opponents’ 20. It worked great in a rout of Maryland. Not so against a pretty good Penn State defense that came in leading the nation in sacks. \nSo again the question is, as it has been since last January, who is the Buckeyes No. 1 quarterback? Jones, who led the Buckeyes to the national championship, or Barrett, who was the Big Ten player of the year. \nEzekiel Elliott was once again a constant for the Buckeyes with 153 yards rushing, his 12th straight 100-yard game. \nAside from Jones’ struggles, it was Ohio State’s best game of the season. Braxton Miller got involved in a variety of ways with eight touches for 63 yards and a touchdown and the Buckeyes committed no turnovers. \nPenn State knows exactly who its quarterback is but Christian Hackenberg was again poorly protected against Joey Bosa and the Ohio State pass rush. Last season, Bosa ended Ohio State’s double-overtime victory with a sack and he had one of five sacks Saturday night against Hackenberg. The junior seemed to be favoring his back after getting dumped in the third quarter and finished 7 for 13 for 120 yards and a touchdown. \nPenn State leaned on Barkley, who had missed the last two games with a foot injury. He made a difference, but his long touchdown run that could have put Penn State up 10-0 in the first quarter was wiped out by a holding call on right guard Brian Gaia. \nBarrett gave Ohio State a 7-3 lead with a 5-yard TD run early in the second quarter and Elliott finished the next drive by darting and bouncing off tacklers for a 10-yard score. Barrett closed the next drive, too, taking a keeper on the zone read 13 yards for the score. \nPenn State opened the second half with a three-play touchdown drive, capped by DaeSean Hamilton stretching to the pylon for an 8-yard touchdown reception to make it 21-10. No. 16 Iowa 40, No. 20 Northwestern 10 \nEVANSTON, Ill. - Northwestern coach Pat Fitzgerald wants his team to make a decision after the Wildcats surrendered 78 points in two games. \nDo the Wildcats want to be the team that won its first five games? Or do they want to be the team that struggled with tackling and making catches in losing those two games? \nFitzgerald said his 20th-ranked Wildcats made fundamental mistakes in their 40-10 loss to 17th-ranked Iowa on Saturday. After the Wildcats fell to No. 12 Michigan 38-0 last week, they’re trying to avoid the kind of collapse they experienced in 2013 when Northwestern lost seven straight games after winning its first four. \n“We’ve got to do a better job as a staff,” Fitzgerald said. “We’ve got to get their confidence back. We’ve got to get our guys to tackle better. We’ve got to get our guys to block better.” \nAkrum Wadley ran for 204 yards and tied a school record with four rushing touchdowns for Iowa (7-0, 3-0 Big Ten), which lost leading rusher Jordan Canzeri late in the first quarter. Canzeri, who was averaging 116.2 rushing yards per game, sustained an ankle injury following a short run when Northwestern linebacker Jaylen Prater landed on Canzeri. \nWadley, who had only eight carries prior to Saturday, didn’t miss a beat. \nThe sophomore running back scored his third touchdown on a 2-yard run with 6:42 remaining in the third quarter, extending Iowa’s lead to 23-10. \n“Anyone of us is capable of making big runs, and I just stepped up to the plate,” Wadley said. \nHis record-tying fourth scoring run — which followed a Northwestern fumble — came on a four-yard run that gave the Hawkeyes a 30-10 lead. \n“It just seems like they roll running back after running back after running back,” Fitzgerald said. “They understand what their system is. They play well in it. I don’t want to diminish the young man’s game, but I think we helped him.” \nMarshall Koehn added a 36-yard field goal before Derrick Mitchell scored on a 13-yard touchdown run with 7:55 left. \n“I felt like we could do what we wanted to offensively,” Iowa quarterback C.J. Beathard said. \nNorthwestern (5-2, 1-2) turned the ball over three times. \n“We give up those type of momentum plays against a good football team, it makes for a long day,” Fitzgerald said. \nIowa led 16-10 at halftime after failing to extend its lead on the final play of the second quarter. C.J. Beathard drove the Hawkeyes to the Northwestern 16-yard line, but Koehn pushed a 34-yard field goal attempt wide. \nNorthwestern struggled to find any rhythm offensively for much of the first half, but responded to a 16-point deficit with 10 straight points. \nRedshirt freshman Clayton Thorson, who was 17 for 35 passing for 125 yards with a touchdown and interception, connected with Christian Jones on a 4-yard touchdown pass with 6:18 remaining in the first half to get Northwestern to within 16-7. \nAfter Treveon Henry intercepted Beathard on Iowa’s next drive, the Wildcats drove to the Hawkeyes 1-yard line, but had to settle for a Jack Mitchell 20-yard field goal to close to within 16-10. \nIowa built an early lead behind Wadley, who scored on runs of 35 and 4 yards. \n“If you want to beat Iowa, you have to stop the run and that didn’t happen today,” Northwestern defensive end Dean Lowry said. Nebraska 48, Minnesota 25 \nMINNEAPOLIS - Tommy Armstrong Jr. bounced back from a pair of bad performances to start Big Ten play, passing for 261 yards and three touchdowns to start the salvaging of Nebraska’s season and preserve a 48-25 victory over Minnesota on Saturday. \nTerrell Newby rushed for 116 yards and two first-half scores on just 13 carries for the Cornhuskers (3-4, 1-2), who were reeling from four losses this fall on the opponent’s final offensive play. \nThis one was a lot less stressful, though Mitch Leidner did his best to keep the Gophers (4-3, 1-2) competitive against Nebraska’s FBS-worst pass defense with career bests in completions (26) and yards (301). Leidner threw two late interceptions, one that was returned by Joshua Kalu for a 41-yard touchdown, but he threw for one score and ran for another. \nAlonzo Moore, Cethan Carter and De’Mornay Pierson-El were the touchdown targets by Armstrong, who completed only 36 percent of his passes for a total of 234 yards in losses to Illinois and Wisconsin the last two weeks. \nPierson-El, who fumbled near the goal line in the closing minutes of Minnesota’s 28-24 win at Nebraska last year, missed the first four games with a foot injury. He had a 42-yard punt return and the catch of the game in the corner of the end zone early in the fourth quarter when he tipped the ball to himself between two defensive backs. \nCarter reached to push the ball over the pylon in the third quarter for a 10-yard score, deftly using his other arm for balance while Antonio Johnson was trying to tackle him. That marked the end of a 99-yard march in 10 plays by the Huskers, the defining stretch against an injury-affected Gophers defense that had been so good this season and the last two. \nNebraska predictably had plenty of fans on hand, with the two campuses a six-hour drive apart. Red hats, jackets and jerseys were packing the corners of the upper deck, interspersed throughout the lower bowl and spotted at all kinds of attractions around the Twin Cities this weekend. \nThey had most of the stadium to themselves to chant “Go Big Red!” to their heart’s content by the end, with the frustrated home crowd largely emptied out. \nThe troubling part of the first half for the Gophers was that Leidner was as sharp as he’s ever been, completing 16 of 17 passes for 156 yards before the break, but they still took a 10-point deficit into the locker room. \nRight after Minnesota’s first touchdown in the first quarter this season, a 75-yard opening drive capped by a 24-yard catch on third-and-1 by Eric Carter, Nebraska answered in three plays. Newby galloped through a gaping hole in the middle and bounced outside to reach the end zone untouched for 69 yards. \nAfter grinding up Purdue on the ground last week for a 41-13 victory, the Gophers rushed for only 65 yards on 26 attempts with Huskers defensive tackles Maliek Collins and Vincent Valentine doing plenty of damage inside. 7 CONNECT 4 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://indy.st/1RORHAT TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T07:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T08:25:42.343+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
