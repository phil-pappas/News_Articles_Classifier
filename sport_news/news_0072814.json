View More... \nBelfast — There are few things in sports as exciting as two distance runners pushing themselves to the limit over the final 50 yards of a 3.1-mile course — with hundreds of screaming fans forming a human tunnel and path to the finish line — in an attempt to outrace the other to record a faster time and higher place to help their team. \nThat happened frequently on Saturday, Oct. 3 as thousands of feet, connected to hundreds of young bodies, pounded their way around the course on a blustery, cold, early-fall day during the 14th running of the Festival of Champions high school cross-country meet at Troy Howard Middle School. \nIt was a solid day for Midcoast student-athletes, none more than Camden Hills' Augusta Stockman, who finished first among the freshmen runners. In fact, the talented Stockman finished seventh overall among 614 girls who finished the 5K course. The Windjammer finished more than 30 seconds head of the next best freshman runner. \nCombined with the 811 boys who finished the course, that totaled 1,425 runners who crossed the course during one of six races on the day, which included boys and girls unseeded and seeded races, as well as freshmen events. \nVideo and a link to more photos from this event will appear later with this story. \nAdditionally for Midcoast participants, Belfast's Emily Jolliffe, Patrick Groening and Ricky Smith finished among the top 100 for girls and boys, respectively. \nRunners from 67 Maine high schools, as well as from Rhode Island, Vermont, New Hampshire and Prince Edward Island in Canada, converged on Troy Howard Saturday. \nThe largest sporting event in the state was a preview, of sorts, for the upcoming conference, regional and state championship meets, which highlight standout individuals and championship teams from schools large and small. \nThe event was co-hosted by Belfast and Brewer. \nThe girls team scores were: La Salle Academy of Providence, R.I. 30, Orono 128, Cumberland of Rhode Island 141, Harwood Union of Moretown, Vt. 154, Falmouth 267, Cape Elizabeth 301, Massabesic of Waterboro 323, Phillips Exeter Academy of Exeter, N.H. 324, Colonel Gray of Charlottetown, P.E. 393, Brunswick 394, George Stevens Academy of Blue Hill 409, Scarborough 452, Cony of Augusta 479, Bonny Eagle of Standish 488, Mount Blue of Farmington 502, Westbrook 509, Camden Hills of Rockport 560, Waterville 580, South Portland 608, Lewiston 623, Hampden Academy 664, Boothbay Region 672, Caribou 673, Maranacook of Readfield 704, Biddeford 732, Lincoln Academy of Newcastle 741, Kents Hill 741, Old Town 765, Presque Isle 781, Brewer 788, Mount Desert Island 789, St. Dominic of Auburn 822, John Bapst of Bangor 834, Maine Coast Waldorf of Freeport 851, Burrillville of Rhode Island 895, Morse of Bath 933, Monmouth Academy 973, Bangor 995, Mattanawcook Academy of Lincoln 1,041, Messalonskee of Oakland 1,066, Marshwood of Eliot 1,098, Telstar of Bethel 1,189, Thornton Academy of Saco 1,219, Lake Region of Bridgton 1,260, Oxford Hills of South Paris 1,262, Hall-Dale of Farmingdale 1,266, Gray-New Gloucester 1,272, Edward Little of Auburn 1,282, Medomak Valley of Waldoboro 1,318, Gould Academy of Bethel 1,412, Winthrop 1,436, Catherine McAuley of Portland 1,444, Hermon 1,463, Windham 1,620.
