Fred Roggin reports for the NBC4 News at 11 on Sunday. (Published Monday, Oct. 12, 2015) The University of Southern California has announced that Trojans football coach Steve Sarkisian has been asked to take an indefinite leave of absence and reportedly will seek treatment for alcohol addiction. \"He is not healthy,\" USC Athletic Director Pat Haden said. \"I asked him to take an indefinite leave of absence.\" Trick Play Leads Washington Over No. 17 USC Haden spoke to the media after Sarkisian was not at practice on Sunday, just five days before the Trojans take on No. 14 Notre Dame in South Bend on Saturday. According to Haden, he was watching the USC Men's basketball team practice at the Galen Center when he received a call that Sarkisian \"was not well,\" and in no condition to work. Haden then called Sarkisian to see for himself. \"It was clear to me that he was unhealthy,\" Haden said matter of factly. \"This has all happened very quickly.\" The call ended with Haden asking Sarkisian to take an indefinite leave of absence from the program. USC Coach Apologizes for Profanity at Kickoff Event Coach Sarkisian came under fire back in August after he delivered a profanity laced speech at a team sponsored event. Sarkisian appeared to be visibly intoxicated and apologized for his \"inappropriate\" behavior. At the time, Sarkisian said he would seek treatment and avoid alcohol for the remainder of the college football season -- apparently, he was unable to do so. Coach Sarkisian Apologizes for Rant USC football coach Steve Sarkisian talks about the \"moral of the story\" after his \"inappropriate\" behavior at a team event. Mario Solis reports for the NBC4 News at Noon on Tuesday Aug. 25, 2015. (Published Tuesday, Aug. 25, 2015) \"We all have a great deal of concern for coach Sarkisian and his health,\" Haden continued. \"Clay Helton will take over as head coach.\" Helton then addressed the media, issuing a statement: USC Avenges Loss in 42-14 Blowout of ASU \"Thank you for the opportunity to be the interim head coach of USC,\" He said. \"Fortunately, or unfortunately, I've been in this situation before.\" This marks Haden's second stint as head coach of the Trojans as he took over for coach Ed Orgeron in the 2013 Las Vegas Bowl Game against Fresno State. USC won that game 45-20, and Sarkisian was hired to replace Orgeron right away. Stanford Shocks No. 6 USC 41-31 Crushing Title Hopes Helton is 1-0 as a head coach, and has been calling the plays for the Trojans on offense for most of the season. Despite the \"temporary leave of absence\" tag placed on Sarkisian's departure from the program, we imagine this will be permanent by the end of the season.
