It’s a powerhouse that has seen great heights and plenty of dominance. \nAccording to head coach Clint May, though, the Hawks have never had a duo run as well as Riley Collins and Chase Equall are right now. \n“Our top two boys were just phenomenal,” May said after Bozeman swept Thursday’s Capital City 7 of 7 Invitational in Helena. “We’ve had a lot of good teams, and we’ve had a lot of good 1-2 punches, but that combined time is the best in Bozeman High’s history.” \nCollins finished second in the No. 1 race in 15 minutes, 9 seconds, behind only Missoula Sentinel’s Marshall Beatty. Equall, running against No. 2s from across the state, won in 15:14, more than 26 seconds better than the runner-up. \nThe Bozeman boys finished with 13 points, as Equall won the No. 2 race, Duncan Hamilton the No. 4 and Orrin Clark the No. 5. None of the seven finished lower than third, and the Hawks were eight points better than Missoula Hellgate. \n“The boys were very strong today, and we had two young ones (Dylan Humberger and Simon Rosenzweig) at the No. 7 and 6. They’re sophomores, but both of them, most of their experience was with JV, but they were able to move up to varsity and were really, really strong,” May said. \nSince the races took place in reverse, the youngsters set the tone for a strong day. \n“I guarantee the other runners were sneaking peaks, and they can tell when good things are happening,” May said. “When those two younger guys were really, really competitive right up to the end, that is a momentum builder where you start getting excited.” \nThe Hawks have one more home meet Oct. 13 before state Oct. 14. \n“If they can run like that, we should have a very good day at state,” he said. \nPiper Meuwissen finished fifth in the No. 1 on the girls’ side, but Camila Noe and Kenenni Wiegand won the next two races and the Hawks’ 19 points were tops in the field by four. \n“It was a very good team effort,” May said. “Our girls, they know that they’ve got a large task ahead of them. The team that was in third today (Billings Senior) was missing their top runner, so they shifted around and had girls in different places.” \nIn a loaded No. 1 field, Meuwissen was 54 seconds behind Kalispell Glacier’s Annie Hill, though a more manageable 16 out of second place. \n“We’re going to have to get better in the next two weeks, but I definitely feel like we can do that,” May said. “We just have to put together the right workouts and take care of ourselves.” \nParker Gabriel can be reached at pgabriel@dailychronicle.com or 582-2690.
