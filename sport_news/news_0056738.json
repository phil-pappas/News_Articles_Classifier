The Mountaineers crushed Louisiana-Monroe 59-14 to improve to 5-1 on the season and 2-0 in the conference. App has won 11 of its last 12 games and is riding an eight-game conference winning streak into a Thursday showdown against Georgia Southern, another former SoCon school that is also 5-1 overall and 3-0 in the Sun Belt. \nSpeir took over a Western Carolina program after the 2011 season that had plummeted to the bottom of the Football Championship Subdivision level by going 12-56 overall and 3-43 in conference games in the previous six seasons. \nSpeier’s first two teams finished 1-10 and 2-10 but showed more heart and skill than it had under former coach Dennis Wagner. \nLast year’s team turned the corner by going 7-5 overall, which included losses to South Florida and Alabama. The 5-2 record in the SoCon was good for a second-place finish and gave Catamount fans hope that this was going to be the season the program would win its first ever SoCon title. \nThe conference season got off to a bad start with a road loss to The Citadel, but a comeback win over Mercer on Oct. 10 gave fans hope. Then on Saturday WCU stormed to a 17-0 lead against Wofford, forcing four turnovers, three of which led to three scores. \nThe Terriers mounted a comeback and had the ball with plenty of time to try and tie the score, but the Cats’ defense held on, forced another turnover and Speir’s team improved to 4-2 with a 24-17 win. \n“I’m proud of our players and thank the Good Lord every day for putting me,” in Cullowhee, Speir said after the game as he had his arm around his mother. who stood with him as he talked to the media. \n“I brought him good luck,\" she said. \nThe Cats host Samford in their homecoming game on Saturday and then play at Chattanooga on Oct. 31 in a game that could go a long way toward deciding the conference title. Then it’s conference games against Furman and Virginia Military Academy sandwiched around a money game against Texas A&M to end the regular season. \nIn Boone, coach Scott Satterfield had a rocky start after replacing Jerry Moore, who won three FBC championships during his tenure. Satterfield’s first team finished 4-8 overall in its last season in the SoCon. Last season the Mountaineers were 2-5 before winning their last six games for a 7-5 record. That success has carried over to this season with App’s only loss coming against ACC power Clemson, which is unbeaten and ranked sixth in the latest Associated Press Poll. \nTwo more wins will likely put the Mountaineers into one of the four lower-tier bowls the Sun Belt has contracts with. \nWestern Carolina likely needs to win or share the SoCon title to earn a berth to the FBS playoffs. By winning at Wofford the Cats kept their hopes alive and continued the turnaround that has made football exciting again in Cullowhee. \nThis is the opinion of Citizen-Times sportswriter Bob Berghaus.
