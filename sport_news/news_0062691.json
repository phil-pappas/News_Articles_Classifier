(AP) — Former stars Marty Marion and Bucky Walters are among 10 candidates from the earlier days of baseball who will be considered for the Hall of Fame. \nThe Hall on Monday announced the Pre-Integration Era ballot. A 16-member panel will decide on Dec. 7 during the winter meetings in Nashville, Tennessee, with a three-quarters vote needed for election. \nJoining Marion and Walters on the ballot are Doc Adams, Sam Breadon, Bill Dahlen, Wes Ferrell, Garry Herrmann, Frank McCormick, Harry Stovey and Chris von der Ahe. All of them are deceased. \nThe candidates made their greatest contributions to the game before Jackie Robinson broke the color barrier in 1947. \nMarion was the 1944 NL MVP and a top-fielding shortstop for the St. Louis Cardinals. Walters compiled a 198-160 career record and the 1939 NL MVP with Cincinnati. \nAdams played for the acclaimed Knickerbocker Base Ball Club in 1845 and later helped establish the shortstop position.
