The hood of Bowyer’s 5-hour ENERGY Toyota was pushed up over the car’s windshield and the car suffered heavy damage, particularly to the right front. \nBowyer was taken to the infield care center but emerged a few minutes later after being checked out by medical personnel. \n“It was a hard hit,” Bowyer said. “It gives you a wakeup call. We were having some fun, doing a little better than I actually thought we were going to do. \n“I’m just disappointed, frustrated. You always hate to have something like that happen, especially at home.” \nBowyer was trying to get past Gordon for the 15th spot when the incident happened. \n“I was following Gordon and starting to catch him back,” Bowyer said. “I went in and he kind of took my line away. I tried to pull down and as soon as my headlight got out and got some air, boy, it turned me. I probably should have just went to the inside, but I thought I could save it. \n“I can’t believe how fast it snapped. You usually can ride it along a little bit but that thing came out from underneath of me so fast.” \nBowyer, who was eliminated in the Challenger Round of the Chase for the Spring Cup Championship, finished 40th on Sunday. Bowyer, who has finished as high as second in the Sprint Cup standings, now has five races left in his tenure with Michael Waltrip Racing. \nHAMLIN STRENGTHENS CHASE POSITION — Denny Hamlin didn’t see the incident between Joey Logano and Matt Kenseth late in Sunday’s race that sent Kenseth spinning and Logano to victory lane. \nBut as a good Joe Gibbs Racing teammate, he took Kenseth’s side. \n“I didn’t see it,” said Hamlin, who finished second in the race and climbed to second in the Chase standings. “Unfortunately those guys were really fast and too far ahead of me to see it. But my standpoint was just that you have a mix there of one guy (Logano) that had nothing to lose and one (Kenseth) that probably saw his opportunity to move on to the next round. \n“(I) don’t know what happened, but no matter what, I’m going to stick up for Kenseth, so he’s probably right.” \nACTOR THRILLED TO BE GRAND MARSHALL — Mark-Paul Gosselaar, probably best known for his role as Zack Morris on the former TV series “Saved by the Bell,” is an avid race fan and racer, so when NBC and Kansas Speedway offered him the opportunity to serve as grand marshall for Sunday’s Hollywood Casino 400 he jumped at it. \n“I’m a part of the NBC family and I have a new NBC show (“Truth Be Told”) that’s on Fridays,” Gosselaar said. “Being a part of the family they always ask you what your interests are and I said NASCAR, motorsports, golf. So that’s why I'm here this weekend, not only to promote by new show but also because I’m a big fan of motorsports.” \nGosselaar’s main duty as grand marshall was to give the “start your engines” command before the start of the race, and he admitted that he practiced beforehand. \n“People ask you, ‘Don’t you nervous doing what you do?’” Gosselaar said. “Yes, in moments like these I get a little nervous. What word do you put the emphasis on? Is it drivers or start or engines? Thank God for showers because that’s where I practiced, in the shower.” \nAlso in attendance was Kansas City, Kan., native Eric Stonestreet, who stars in the hit ABC comedy “Modern Family.” \nRick Peterson can be reached at (785) 295-1129 or rick.peterson@cjonline.com .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T02:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T06:51:18.188+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
