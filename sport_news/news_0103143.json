The Maples pieced together a near-perfect day to claim the 35th annual Lenawee County Volleyball Tournament Saturday hosted at Adrian High School after knocking off rival Tecumseh 25-21, 25-21 in the championship match. “I’m very proud of them,” said Adrian coach Kerry Watkins. “They played tough all day. We had a few hiccups here and there, but came back and played some really good matches.” Adrian earned the No. 2 seed in bracket play after posting a 5-1 record in Pool A. The Maples defeated Addison 25-14, 25-17 in the quarterfinals and Onsted 25-20, 25-22 in the semifinals. “I told the seniors, ‘This is your last county tournament, and your last chance to win the championship,’ and they stepped up and played hard,” Watkins said. The Indians earned the top spot the bracket round after a 6-0 finish in Pool B. Tecumseh topped Lenawee Christian 25-21, 25-9 in the quarterfinals and Blissfield 25-13, 25-18 in the semifinals, before falling to the Maples in the title match. “We came out and played pretty well through pool play and the semifinals,” Tecumseh coach Kim Foley said. “We were our own worst enemies today. We got ourselves down and then had to fight our way back. They wanted it really bad, but we didn’t play our best. Adrian is great defensively. They were digging everything that we were giving them.” Tecumseh and Adrian will turn around and matchup again on Tuesday at Adrian, this time with Southeastern Conference White Division title implications. Onsted was the No. 3 seed after a 5-1 finish in pool play. The Wildcats fell in the semifinals to Adrian in two close sets, after they defeated Clinton 25-13, 25-15 in the semifinals. “I think we’re at a point where we’re doing real well right now as far as where we are,” said Onsted coach Rhonda Hubbard. “Getting ready to go into the postseason, execution in crunch time is key.” Blissfield earned the No. 4 seed after finishing 5-1 in pool play. The Royals defeated Madison 25-21, 25-17 in the quarterfinals, before falling to Tecumseh. “We worked through some different kinks, but they persevered and played as a team a lot today,” Blissfield coach Margaret Timmis said. “I told my girls last night there’s going to be great competition, and it will make you see where you stand as a team, so I think the tournament was great.” Madison claimed the fifth seed, followed by Clinton, Addison and Lenawee Christian. Morenci earned the ninth seed, followed by Britton Deerfield, Hudson and Sand Creek.
