He was fired on Monday.\nHayes will take an official visit to Notre Dame on Saturday when the Irish host USC in one of college football's big rivalry games.\n\"My first official visit will be at Notre Dame this weekend,\" said Hayes, a 6-foot-4, 240-pound five-star linebacker with 4.5 speed. \"If I had to give a No. 1 school right now, Notre Dame would probably be it.\"\nHayes – who suffered a season-ending separated shoulder in Week No. 3 against Saline – plans on graduating early and attending college in January. He was ranked the No. 2 player in the state in the preseason by The Detroit News, behind Detroit King receiver / defensive back Donnie Corley.\nHayes, who is ranked the No. 13 outside linebacker in the nation by Scout.com, attended Notre Dame's season opener against Texas back on Labor Day weekend and as Irish players entered Notre Dame Stadium, he received a hug from ND head coach Brian Kelly, according to reports.\n\"I've been loving Notre Dame since my sophomore year when I attended camp and they offered me on the spot,\" Hayes said Monday. \"I'm confident with how they want to use me because they're recruiting me like they did Jaylon (Smith) and they want me to come in and do the same things he's doing (at the hybrid defensive end / linebacker spot). I'm confident the coaching staff would get me to where I need to be at that level. And, I've also talked to 'Bama. 'Bama contacted me today and they want me to set up an official.\"\nSmith, Notre Dame's 6-3, 240-pound junior, was an Associated Press second-team All-American last season.\nSo, where is MSU and Michigan in his list?\n\"Michigan State is, I'm not so sure about Michigan,\" said Hayes of his top teams. \"Yes, they (Michigan) offered me when he (Jim Harbaugh) first got there, but I haven't really talked to him since. I have talked to Coach Dantonio, definitely. Michigan State's been a powerhouse under Coach Dantonio the last few years.\"\nOne thing is certain: Hayes won't be attending USC.\n\"No, that's pretty much a wrap for that situation,\" Hayes said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T20:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T00:07:34.648+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
