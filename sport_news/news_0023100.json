Was it the niqab? Was it the decision to promise a balanced budget? Was it that Mulcair could just not compete, on a personality level, with the charismatic Trudeau?\nTime will tell as the post-election analysis comes in, but as one NDP insider put it even before the devastating results started rolling in Monday night: this was a momentum campaign, propelled by the desire for change, and the momentum did not go their way.\nThe bad news began in Atlantic Canada, losing both NDP Deputy Leader Megan Leslie and long-time MP Peter Stoffer to the Liberals.\nThey knew those provinces would likely be a near-Liberal sweep, but by the time the Quebec results started rolling in, it was clear the NDP had fallen hard and fast to third place.\nThe mood in the room was sombre, with a smattering of cheers and applause as the occasional victory rolled in — including that of Ruth Ellen Brosseau in the Quebec riding of Berthier-Maskinongé, the young woman who traveled to Las Vegas during the 2011 election campaign and then had come to symbolize how many of the paper candidates from 2011 had worked hard to become serious MPs.\nEarly results also suggested they would be able to hold their own in British Columbia.\nBut celebrations came few and far between, despite party president Rebecca Blaikie at one point yelling some enthusiasm into a microphone in front of a relatively small crowd of supporters: “It ain’t over till it’s over!”\nBut it was over, really, and it was even hard to see a silver lining, beyond the fact that Conservative Leader Stephen Harper, against whom they campaigned hard, even as their attacks had turned more often to Trudeau in the last stretch of the campaign, had gone down to defeat.\nBefore the poll results started coming in, NDP sources who acknowledged their path to victory had disappeared were still confident the party would at least receive its second-best result in its history.\nThat second-best bar was not a high one to jump: before 2011, when the late Jack Layton led his party to Official Opposition status, the highest number of seats they had ever had in Ottawa was 43, under former leader Ed Broadbent.\nAnd yet, they did not even make that.\nThe fall from 95 seats at the dissolution of Parliament to Elections Canada online results showing them leading in just 35 seats, at time of publication Monday night, is a steep one. And this, especially, for a campaign that had been arguing the party needed only 35 more seats to defeat the Conservative government of Stephen Harper, unlike the 100 needed by the Liberals, who in the end were the ones to actually do it.\nMore on thestar.com\nConservative candidate Bob Saroya wins in Markham-Unionville\nLisa Raitt wins new Milton riding", "external_links": ["http://static.freeskreen.com/publisher/52/freeskreen.min.js"], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T07:06:00.588+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
