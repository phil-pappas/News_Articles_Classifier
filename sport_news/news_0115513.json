PAUL RODRIGUEZ, STAFF PHOTOGRAPHER Related article » EL SEGUNDO – Byron Scott couldn’t guarantee that Kobe Bryant will be on the floor when the Lakers open the regular season Wednesday against Minnesota at Staples Center, but he wasn’t betting against it, either.\n“Do I think he’ll play? Absolutely,” Scott said after Saturday’s practice. “I think he’ll play, knowing him like I do.”\nScott said Bryant took part in shooting drills and got treatment during the Lakers’ light practice, but didn’t do any running. The Lakers star has been sidelined for a week because of a bruised lower left leg.\nScott said he will see how Bryant feels Sunday and hopefully he can “ramp it up a little more” before engaging in full practices Monday and Tuesday. Mostly, Scott is taking a “wait and see” approach before penciling in the 37-year-old star.\n“I’m not trying to predict what he can do tomorrow,” Scott said. “I just want to see him get out here and go a little bit more. If he can do that, we’ll make progress. That’s what we want to see.”\nScott said Bryant called his leg “a little stiff.” Bryant sat out the final three preseason games after injuring the leg against Sacramento in Las Vegas.\n“He (Bryant) wants to make sure he’s able to run – cutting and lateral movements are important,” Scott said. “I don’t know if he’ll be 110 percent, but I think the closer we can get to him being to that number, the better.”\nCLARKSON OPTIMISTIC\nThere’s no guessing about Jordan Clarkson’s availability for the opener. The second-year guard took part in some drills Saturday and said he expects to be ready to play Wednesday, less than a week after spraining his right shoulder.\nHe said he strained two muscles behind his shoulder, but the pain has lessened and predicts he will be 100 percent healthy by Wednesday.\n“I didn’t think it was too serious after the game,” Clarkson said. “It’s just one of those things you have to rest.”\nContact the writer: jcarr@ocregister.com", "external_links": ["http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/twitter-ico.jpg", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/fb-ico.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nwrahb-kobe.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nwrahb-kobe.jpg", "http://assets.pinterest.com/js/pinmarklet.js?r=", "http://s7.addthis.com/js/250/addthis_widget.js#username=YOUR-ACCOUNT-ID", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/mail-ico.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T07:24:12.330+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
