Winning one at home\nTexas A&M head coach Kevin Sumlin has accomplished many things since his arrival in 2012. However, before tonight, his Aggies had yet to claim victory at home against an AP Top 25 opponent.\nThe last victory at Kyle Field to come against a ranked opponent before Saturday's 30-17 victory came in 2011 when A&M defeated No. 20 Baylor 55-28 as a member of the Big 12.\n104,455 watched as the Aggies handled the Bulldogs, never trailing in the contest. A&M improves to 5-0 for the second consecutive year for the first time since 1940-1941.\nThe Aggie defense kept Mississippi State quarterback Dak Prescott in check for the majority of the evening, limiting the success of the senior signal caller and preventing him from getting in a rhythm.\n2. Too many penalties\nPenalties costly. It's already difficult enough to drive down the field at the college level, and penalties certainly don't make it any easier.\nThe Aggies committed five total penalties for 53 yards, all coming in the first half.\nThe most costly flag from the first 30 minutes of action came about halfway through the second quarter. Sophomore wide receiver Ricky Seals-Jones was disqualified from the game after picking up a targeting penalty while blocking.\nRicky Seals-Jones was ejected for targeting on this play.

Before his ejection, he caught five passes for 34 yards including a one-yard touchdown reception.\nIn the third quarter, this tweet appeared on Seals-Jones' Twitter feed.\nLOVE the 12th Man !\n— SweetJonesJr (@RickySealsJones) October 4, 2015 3.Offense is improving\nThe offense has began to truly open up five games into the season for Texas A&M.\nLast week, A&M QB Kyle Allen set a career-high in passing yards with 358 in an overtime victory against Arkansas.\nAt halftime on Saturday, Allen had already managed 226 yards to go along with two touchdown passes. He finished the game with 25 completions on 41 attempts for 322 yards.\nFreshman sensation Christian Kirk continues to improve by the week as well, in terms of both production as well as understanding of the offense. After working primarily out of the slot during non-conference play, the wide receiver out of Arizona has been moved all around the field in the last two weeks.\nOn the ground, Tra Carson took 26 carries for 110 yards and a touchdown.\nSophomore Damion Ratley became the seventh different A&M receiver to haul in a TD pass in 2015 to put the Aggies up 14-3 in the first quarter.\nThe Aggies are off to a hot little start, up 14-3 on Miss State. Kyle Allen is 9-9, 2 TDs passing. pic.twitter.com/Yq93PcFzmA\n— TexasFootball .com (@dctf) October 4, 2015 4. Scoring in the fourth\nAfter taking a 24-10 lead to halftime, both offenses stalled dramatically in the second half of play.\nMississippi State continued its streak of not allowing a touchdown in the fourth quarter, but did concede a field with five minutes and change remaining in the fourth quarter to push the score to 30-17.\nThe field goal was one of three on the day for A&M senior Taylor Bertolet, including a career-high of 55 yards.\nOn the following possession, Prescott scrambled up the middle to set up fourth and two with the game on the line. After a false start from Bulldogs OL Justin Senior pushed the play back to fourth-and-seven, Prescott's intended pass to De'Runnya Wilson fell incomplete.\n5. Moeller breaks record\nSenior Sam Moeller made his 31st consecutive start as the 12th Man on Saturday, good for the school record.\nA special teams tradition dating back to 1982, Moeller breaks the record of 30 held by Nick Lamantia, who played for A&M from 2006-2008.\nMoeller had two tackles on the evening, including a stop to pin the Bulldogs inside the five on the opening kickoff of the second half.\nUp next for the Aggies is a bye week, followed by an Oct 17 matchup with the Alabama Crimson Tide at Kyle Field.\nFollow Brandon Wheeland on Twitter: @BrandonWheeland\nTexas A&M 30, Mississippi State 17: Complete coverage\nClick here to visit the Texas A&M Aggies page\nHairopoulos: Sumlin breaks through vs. Top-25 team at home; A&M has bye to prepare for Bama\nTexas A&M quotable: Sumlin impressed with play of defensive ends; 'will address' Seals-Jones tweets during game\nTexas A&M quick hits: Seals-Jones catches 1st TD pass of season, gets ejected for targeting\nFive thoughts: No. 14 Texas A&M improves to 5-0 despite slow second half offensively\nPhotos: Kyle Allen, ground game carry A&M past Mississippi State 30-17\nKate Hairopoulos answers Texas A&M/SEC questions at 3 p.m. Wednesday, Oct. 7; ask yours now\nOn Twitter:\n @BrandonWheeland", "external_links": ["http://dallasnews.stats.com/cfb/boxscore.asp?gamecode=201510030084&home=84&vis=78", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/10/03/texas-quick-hits-seals-jones-catches-1st-td-pass-season-gets-ejected-targeting", "http://twitter.com/brandonwheeland", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/10/04/texas-quotable-sumlin-impressed-play-defensive-ends-will-address-seals-jones-tweets-game", "https://twitter.com/BrandonWheeland", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/texas-aggies", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/10/03/five-thoughts-14-texas-improves-5-0-despite-slow-second-half-offensively-defeat-21-mississippi-state-30-17", "https://twitter.com/dctf/status/650475650411708416", "https://twitter.com/RickySealsJones/status/650484833282584578", "http://t.co/PzhfsDkokV", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/10/03/hairopoulos-sumlin-breaks-vs-top-25-team-home-bye-prepare-bama", "http://t.co/Yq93PcFzmA", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/chats/2015/09/30/kate-hairopoulos-answers-texas-amsec-questions-3-pm-wednesday-oct-7-ask-now", "https://twitter.com/dctf/status/650462819721199617"], "published": "2015-10-04T06:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T06:02:11.300+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
