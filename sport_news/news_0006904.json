Blue Jays starter Marco Estrada looked completely in command in the first three innings striking out four and retiring the first nine Royals he faced.\nRoyals starter Edison Volquez couldn't match Estrada, giving up a solo homer in the bottom of the second as the Jays took an early 1-0 lead. It could have been worse were it not for an excellent catch by first basemen Eric Hosmer and a very good one by second baseman Ben Zobrist, both coming in the second inning.\nThe Royals collected their first hit in the fourth as Alcides Escobar led off the frame with a sharp single to left, though he was quickly erased as Zobrist hit into a 4-6-3 double play. Lorenzo Cain then popped out to second.\nThe Jays put a man on in the bottom of the fourth, but the Royals closed out any threat with a sharp 4-6-3 double play of their own.\nEstrada continued his dominance in the fifth with another one two three inning. He has faced the minimum number of hitters through five innings.\nVolquez is also pitching well, just not quite as well. Aside from the one bad pitch that Chris Colabello deposited in the left field bleachers, Volquez has matched Estrada pitch for pitch.\nIt was another zero for the Royals in the top of the sixth as Perez just misses hitting one out and Gordon and Rios go quietly into the early Toronto evening.\nVolquez got into trouble immediately in the bottom of the frame, walking the first batter than hitting the second, putting two on with no outs for slugger/evil villain Jose Bautista who coaxed a walk on a very controversial ball four call. With the bases loaded and nobody out, there was another controversial walk making it 2-0 Jays. Manager Ned Yost then goes to the bullpen to bring in reliever Kelvin Herrera.\nAfter striking out the first batter, Herrera gets lit up by Troy Tulowitzki who drives a double into the left-center field gap, clearing the bases and giving the Jays a 5-0 lead. \nThe Royals go quietly in the top of the seventh, and the Jays still lead by five. \nCopyright 2015 KCTV (Meredith Corp.)
