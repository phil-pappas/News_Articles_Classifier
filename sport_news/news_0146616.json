A Green 3-pointer with 9:19 left. Another Green 3-pointer with 8:51 to go. Eight points in 70 seconds. And then a Green 3-point play with 7:09 left. Heat within three, on the way to tying it.\nErik Spoelstra reviews Heat preseason loss to Magic Turnovers a concern for Heat, Erik Spoelstra after dropping to 0-2 in preseason.\nTurnovers a concern for Heat, Erik Spoelstra after dropping to 0-2 in preseason.\nSee more videos Eleven points, his only scoring of the game, in fewer than three minutes. Less than two minutes later he would check out for the night, because a team carrying the NBA preseason limit of 20 players can ride a hot hand for only so long.\nFor Green, it was a matter of getting in sync with the game. And, oddly, it meant slowing down, as he continues to strive for NBA revalidation after signing for the league minimum this offseason.\n\"My teammates did a great job of calming me down,\" he said. \"Once I get an opportunity, I just try to make something happen.\"\nIt happened Wednesday, the type of eruption the Heat lacked last season in all those games when scoring droughts led to the lottery.\nChris Bosh: 'It's all about rhythm right now' Chris Bosh finds his shooting stroke, but appreciates he has to score within confines of Heat offense.\nChris Bosh finds his shooting stroke, but appreciates he has to score within confines of Heat offense.\nSee more videos \"Offense comes easy for me,\" the 29-year-old swingman said. \"I know if I go down and lock my defense down, nine times out of 10 we're going to win.\"\nFor Green, that ultimately could be the key to consistent playing time. While the Heat have featured a complete five-man second unit in the first two exhibitions, such an approach is less likely during the regular season, when the minutes will go up for Dwyane Wade, Luol Deng and Goran Dragic. To retain his minutes, it likely will require Green to be more of a two-way player than he has shown in recent years.\nSo for all he accomplished during his three minutes of Wednesday scoring fury, there also was disappointment for allowing Magic wing Evan Fournier to break clear for a 3-pointer of his own during that stretch.\nThat's what will be on Green's mind when the Heat return Friday to the practice court at AmericanAirlines Arena in preparation for Monday's resumption of the preseason schedule Monday against the visiting San Antonio Spurs.\n\"I know my role is to have energy on both ends of the floor,\" Green said. \"I'm really focusing on defense, that's what I'm really trying to focus on. Scoring is easy for me. I'm not really worried about scoring.\n\"It's the defense that I'm trying to work my best at. I know that's the only way we can become a better team, if I'm a better defender.\"\nCleanup time\nWednesday's 20 turnovers left coach Erik Spoelstra with a clear lesson plan for when camp resumes.\n\"I think that's something we'll be able to correct, with more practice time, with more time together, more game time,\" he said, with six exhibitions remaining on the Heat's preseason schedule. \"Because when we weren't turning it over, there were some very good things that we saw offensively.\"\nWade said the uneven play almost is to be expected.\n\"We're trying to learn a new offense with new guys,\" he said. \"Preseason is about learning, so you need mistakes to learn from, and we've got a lot of 'em. We got a lot of things that our coaches are going to earn their check with.\"\nFor Spoelstra, that means a fine line between adding more and sharpening what already is in place.\n\"We'll have to continue to install, but continue to work on the collaboration,\" he said. \"Everybody knows in that locker room weâ€™ve got to tighten that up.\"\nFor now, time is on their side, with the regular-season opener not until Oct. 28 against the visiting Charlotte Hornets.\n\"Turnovers is our weakness,\" forward Chris Bosh said. \"And I'm glad that we have eight games. It's a blessing.\n\"So we have plenty of time to look back at the film, see where we're making our mistakes and continue to really polish our game and make sure both the first and second groups are running our offense and defense correctly.\"\nwinderman@tribpub.com.
