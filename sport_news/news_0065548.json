He did a lot of good things.”\nSmith appears to have earned the starting role for the remainder of the campaign, but you don’t score points in the Atlantic Coast Conference without execution. Smith must make substantial statistical improvements when the Eagles (3-4, 0-4) engage Louisville (2-4,1-2) in a conference battle on Saturday (12:30) at Papa John’s Cardinal Stadium.\n“I thought he took a sizable step last week. Now, does that mean there will be another equal sizeable step this week?” Addazio said. “Does it kind of steady off there and take another one down the road a little bit?\n“Those are the things that are hard to tell. I think it makes it easier going to Louisville just from the sheer fact that he’s been in one of those environments already.”\nSmith shared the job with redshirt freshman quarterback Troy Flutie after starter Darius Wade suffered a fractured left ankle in the second quarter of a 14-0 home loss to Florida State on Sept. 18.\nThe two-QB game plan was blown up following consecutive low-scoring ACC losses to Duke and Wake Forest. Addazio looked at the body of work of both young QBs and selected Smith.\nBC is playing with a young rotating offensive line, and featured tailback Jon Hilliman is out for an extended period with a fractured left foot. If Smith can effectively operate the Eagles offense under these conditions against powerful opponents, he will move beyond keeping the seat warm for Wade.\nGoing into this week, Smith now has more actual game experience than either Wade or Flutie. By the time BC wraps up conference play at Syracuse on Nov. 28, Smith will be the only true veteran QB going into the spring.\n“I thought he operated the team more confidently in practice, and he operated the team more confidently on the (Clemson) field,” Addazio said. “That was all real, and I saw all that.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T11:00:15.458+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
