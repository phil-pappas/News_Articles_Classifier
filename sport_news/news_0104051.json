Cotto was always a longshot to agree to the full 160, because all three of his middleweight fights have been paired with catch-weight stipulations which ranged from 155 to 159. \nBut now it appears that Canelo is not interested in fighting Golovkin, or anyone else for that matter, at 160-pounds. He indicated in a video interview that unless Golovkin agrees to a catch-weight of 155-pounds, there won't be a fight. \n\"If he wants to fight with me, let him come down to 155 and I'll fight him whatever day he wants,\" Canelo told Fighthype.com. \n\"At this moment, my body isn't ready for 160 pounds. Maybe 1 or 2 more years I'll be ready for 160, I don't know, but I'd be delighted to fight someone like Gennady. He's a great fighter and I think it would be a great fight. I'd be delighted to get him in a fight.\" \nBecause Canelo would fall under a mandatory obligation, and because the winner of his fight has been ordered by the WBC to fight Golovkin or vacate - Sanchez sees absolutely no reason for his fighter to drop down to any weight lower than 160-pounds. \nGolovkin himself has recently stated that he won't entertain a catch-weight for either boxer. If Canelo or Cotto vacate the title, then Golovkin would become the full WBC champion. \n\"Gennady is the interim-champion and they have to fight him. If they don't fight him, they vacate and Gennady becomes the champion. For this particular fight, for the WBC belt, I believe the Golovkin's team is thinking that there is no reason for it be any less than 160. If it goes to a purse bid or anything else, we have no obligation to do anything different than 160-pounds,\" Sanchez told BoxingScene.com. \n\"I think when you put the name Golovkin in the equation, all of a sudden a lot of guys, whether it be Peter Quillin in the past or someone else, all of a sudden things change and there are a lot of excuses. Golovkin's intentions from the beginning is to be the unified champion. If Canelo chooses not to fight us, then I guess we'll go in a different direction.\" \nHowever, if Canelo vacates the title and then comes back to the negotiating table in the future - without a mandatory order in place - Sanchez explained to BoxingScene that it might be possible to work out a weight limit that works for both parties. \nBut in this particular situation, Golovkin and his team are standing firm on the middleweight limit of 160. \n\"If down the road they fight, and it's not for the WBC title, then anything is possible. There is nothing that can't be done, it all depends on the negotiations between [Golovkin's promoter] Tom Loeffler and Canelo's people - and if Golovkin agrees to it then I see no problem with it. But for this particular fight it has to be for the 160-pound title and then it has to be at 160,\" Sanchez said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T00:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T02:38:11.256+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
