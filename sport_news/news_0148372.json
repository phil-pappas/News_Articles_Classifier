Items like a high-revving, naturally aspirated engine and a soft top will be things of the past and won't make it to the mid-engined \"baby NSX.\"\n© Provided by MotorTrend 2016-Acura-NSX-front-wheels Speculation about a new hybrid powertrain is nothing new, though Auto Express claims Honda's development team has made a few changes. A 2.0-liter, turbo-four was in the original plans, but Honda has purportedly downsized to a 1.5-liter mill to better meet fuel economy and emissions targets. Combined with an electric motor, the powertrain could make around 300 hp, compared to 237 horses produced by the original S2000.\nResearch Make (e.g. Mazda) Acura Alfa Romeo AM General Aston Martin Audi Bentley BMW Buick Cadillac Chevrolet Chrysler Daewoo Dodge Eagle Ferrari Fiat Fisker Ford Geo GMC Honda Hummer Hyundai Infiniti Isuzu Jaguar Jeep Kia Lamborghini Land Rover Lexus Lincoln Lotus Maserati Maybach Mazda McLaren Mercedes-Benz Mercury MINI Mitsubishi Nissan Oldsmobile Plymouth Pontiac Porsche Ram Rolls-Royce Saab Saturn Scion smart SRT Subaru Suzuki Tesla Toyota Volkswagen Volvo Auto Express also claims that the new sports car will only be offered in coupe configuration, unlike the S2000 that came in roadster form only.\nGlobally, the S2000 replacement will slot above the Honda S600 and S1000, thenew mid-engined roadsters that won't be making it to our shores. More importantly, the S2000 will be more accessible than the new Acura NSX, which is estimated to carry a price tag of around $150,000 when it arrives in showrooms next spring.\nFor now, Honda will soon serve up relatively affordable fun once the new Civic Type-R enters the scene. Honda's hot hatch will feature a 2.0-liter turbo-four rated at 306 hp and will be unlike any past Civic offered in the U.S.\nSource: Auto Express\nFollow MSN Autos on Facebook\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/MSNAutos", "http://www.motortrend.com/"], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T14:04:31.282+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
