I really want them to maximize their open 3's.''- Eddie Jordan \nA year after ranking last in the Big Ten in 3-pointers made (4.8 per game) and next-to-last in 3-point accuracy (29.5 percent), Rutgers coach Eddie Jordan is looking for better production from beyond the arc. \n\"I'm excited about pushing the ball and taking your first open 3,'' Jordan said Thursday, speaking from the podium at Big Ten men's basketball media day in Chicago. \"I've told three or four of our guys who have the ability to make 3's, that if it's a good, open shot, I don't care if it's 22 seconds on the clock, go ahead and shoot it. They like that idea.'' \nUnlike last year, Jordan said he believes he has the personnel to attack teams from the perimeter. It's why Rutgers' third-year coach is shelving his traditional Princeton-type offense in favor of a more free-shooting offensive system. \n\"I see a lot of good things for us as far as the way we're going to play,'' said Jordan, who has two starters back from a team that finished 10-22 in its inaugural Big Ten campaign. \"For most of my career, I've done a Princeton-like type offense. This year, we changed it up. We're more perimeter oriented. And so we have a lot of good athleticism. We have good talent. And it's something I'm looking forward to. I'm hoping we can have six, seven guys who average probably 9 (or) 10 points a game.'' \nPLUS: A look at the Rutgers basketball schedules for 2015-16 \nDespite losing the services of three of his team's best shooters, Jordan is confident that Mike Williams — who was regarded as one of New York City's best shooters two years ago coming out of Brooklyn's Bishop Loughlin High School — will produce better results from beyond the arc. \nWilliams made 24 of his 100 3-point attempts last season, experiencing what Jordan called \"freshman jitters.'' \n\"Mike has been looking very good in practice,'' Jordan said. \"He's probably the toughest defender that we have. I know he had a reputation coming out of New York as a top shooter, but you know, he confessed he was nervous as a freshman.'' \nJordan also cited redshirt freshman guard Justin Goode and highly touted true freshman point guard Corey Sanders as shooters he is relying on to improve Rutgers' 3-point accuracy. \nALSO: Rutgers men's basketball gains commitment from Bradley transfer guard Omari Grier \nBut the Scarlet Knights' best perimeter shooter figures to be Omari Grier, a fifth-year senior graduate transfer from Bradley who last season finished second for the Missouri Valley Conference squad in 3-pointers made. \n\"I want those guys to jack them up,'' Jordan said. \"I really want them to maximize their open 3s and get the attempts up.'' \nKeith Sargeant may be reached at ksargeant@njadvancemedia.com .
