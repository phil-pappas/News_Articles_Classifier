It's also the first time in 15 years the NFL went without an arrest for an entire month during the season, per Rosenberg . It's good news for the NFL, which underwent one of its most controversial years in its history in 2014, including high-profile situations such as the Ray Rice assault case and Adrian Peterson 's arrest for child abuse. It is worth noting the NFL's arrest rate was actually two times lower than that of men aged 20-39 from 2000-2013, according to a study by University of Texas-Dallas criminologists, per Yahoo SportsDash . But the league will undoubtedly be pleased it was able to go an entire month without having to deal with the negative publicity associated with one of its players being arrested.
