He injured the ligament on a slide May 31, and was on the disabled list from June 1-22. \nBeltre missed two games of the ALDS because of a strained lower back. He finished the season with a jammed finger on his left hand, but hit .287 with 18 homers and 83 RBIs in 143 games. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T05:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T06:22:55.234+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
