The Bulldogs defense has come up with 15 (9 being INTs) while the offense has turned the ball over six times. Moberly, however, is at a Minus-7 in this category committing 20 turnovers while the defense has come away with 13. 85 Defensively, the Bulldogs’ unit has come up with 85 tackles that has resulted in loss yardage this season, including 11 quarterback sacks. Moberly has 36 total tackles for loss yardage. 364 Mexico’s offense averages 364 rushing yards per game this season, compared to Moberly’s 108. If Moberly (3-5, 2-3 NCMC) is to secure a Senior Night victory against North Central Missouri Conference and Class 4 District 7 rival Mexico on Friday, the defense will need to stop the Bulldogs’ potent rushing attack. It’s no secret that Mexico (7-1, 4-1 NCMC) likes to run the football and the No. 9 state-ranked program has been a one-dimensional team to this point of the 2015 season. While outscoring their opponents by an average margin of 38-11 with four shutouts, Mexico produces about 364 yards of rushing offense per outing and only 40 yards passing during this year’s campaign. Defensively, Mexico is at a plus-9 in this category and according to data on Maxpreps.com website the unit has a remarkable 85 tackles that has went for loss yardage, including 11 sacks. Six of their 10 running backs have amassed at least 100 total rushing yards. Seniors Karsten Ekern and D’Milo Nunnelly display both speed and power running the football rushing for a total of 1189 and 690-yards respectively this season. Ekern has scored 18 touchdowns, and he averages 149 rushing yards per game (8.6 per carry). Nunnelly could very well have joined Ekern in eclipsing the 1,000 rushing yards plateau if it wasn’t for him missing three games due to injury. Nunnelly has 10 rushing touchdowns and is averaging 86 yards per contest. Last week the Bulldogs defeated Fulton 64-39 and racked up 518 yards rushing. Nunnelly accounted for 310 rushing yards and five scores. Senior quarterback SpencerThomas has completed 13 of 22 passes for 294 yards, 3 TDs and he has thrown two interceptions. Thomas’ season stats in the passing department are a far cry from Moberly’s Drake Davidson’s numbers, but again Mexico is more of a run-oriented team. Against Boonville in Week 8, Davidson threw for a career-best 331 yards (26-40, 3 TDs) for a single game, and those numbers alone are greater than the season-to-date numbers Thomas has in the passing game. The Spartans junior quarterback has completed 114 of 210 passes for 1,578 yards this season, with 13 touchdowns and he has thrown nine interceptions. Davidson is averaging 195 passing yards per contest and the team is averaging about 108 rushing yards. Senior John Heimann leads all Moberly ball carriers with 401 total rushing yards on 82 carries. Davidson has rushed 62 times for 162 total yards. Meanwhile the next leading active rusher is freshman Chance Richards, who typically comes into the backfield late in the fourth quarter, and Richards has gained 60 yards on 13 carries. Moberly’s offense has had its challenges finding the end zone in 2015, being outscored by a 17-to-27 average score. Last year the Bulldogs snapped its 9-game losing skid to Moberly when Mexico defeated the Spartans 33-16. --- --- --- NOTE: Following this weekend of football games across the state, a formula will be used by MSHSAA to determine matchups for first round of districts that begin Oct. 23. Depending on final data, Moberly could be playing at either Mexico or Liberty-Wentzville next week.
