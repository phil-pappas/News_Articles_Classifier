(Dave Pickoff / AP) Paul Sullivan Contact Reporter Can the Cubs avenge the horror of 1969 once and for all? \nThe Dodgers and Mets played Game 5 of their National League Division Series Thursday night at Dodger Stadium because of some crazy Major League Baseball rule that prevents the Cubs from getting a bye into the World Series. \nThough everyone knows by now the Cubs' World Series appearance seemingly has been preordained, thanks to a brief scene from the time-travel movie \"Back to the Future, Part II,\" for contractual reasons they still have to play the game. \nThe Cubs will take on the Mets in the National League Championship Series, which begins Saturday night in New York, the site of some traumatic moments from the distant past. \nThe NLCS will pit the Mets' talented young starters, Matt Harvey, Jacob deGrom and Noah Syndergaard, against the Cubs young sluggers â€” Anthony Rizzo, Kris Bryant and Kyle Schwarber. \nCan they avenge the horror of 1969 once and for all? \nThe Mets advanced on Thursday night with a 3-2 victory in the do-or-die game before a frenzied crowd of 54,602. \nIt was expected to be a pitching duel between the Dodgers' Zack Greinke and deGrom, and after a shaky first inning, both starters settled into a groove. \nThe Mets took advantage of some Dodgers sleepwalking to tie the game in the fourth and snatched a 3-2 lead on Daniel Murphy's home run off Greinke in the sixth. \nGreinke came into Game 5 unbeaten in his previous six starts against the Mets, with a 4-0 record and 1.80 ERA. He hadn't lost to the Mets since 2004, his rookie season, and had gone 7-0 overall since Aug. 27. \nThe Mets took a quick lead in the first when Curtis Granderson reached on an infield hit after originally being ruled out, and Murphy doubled him home. But deGrom, who struck out 13 in seven scoreless innings to win Game 1, allowed four straight singles in the bottom of the inning to give the Dodgers a 2-1 lead. \nAs the Dodgers frittered away scoring chances, the Mets came back to tie it in the fourth when the Dodgers suffered a collective brain cramp. After a walk to Lucas Duda sent Murphy to second, Greinke put his head down and third baseman Justin Turner still was hanging around second after an infield shift. \nBoth watched helplessly as Murphy noticed third was uncovered and easily stole the base. Travis d'Arnaud's sacrifice fly tied the game 2-2 and muted the raucous crowd. Murphy drilled a 3-2 pitch into the short porch in far right field to give the Mets their lead in the sixth. \nThe atmosphere at Dodger Stadium was much different than it was at Wrigley Field during the Cubs' two division series games against the Cardinals, except for the now standard postseason towel-waving. \nBefore the start of the game, the Dodgers warmed up their fans by showing a clip of Kirk Gibson's walk-off home run in Game 1 of the 1988 World Series, while a DJ on the field begged them to \"keep the energy going.\" The Cubs don't have any DJ's on the field, much less any film of the 1908 World Series to put on the video boards. \nAfter the top of the third inning, Flea, of the Red Hot Chili Peppers, jumped on top of the dugout and began gyrating to music like a worm going through shock therapy. It was as loud as Wrigley, though the game itself was only part of the show. \nSo now comes the Cubs-Mets NLCS, the one being played because of Article V in the collective bargaining agreement that states: \"The winners of the Division Series in each League shall then engage in a best of seven League Championship Series, and the winners of the two League Championship Series shall engage in a best of seven World Series.\" \nThe Cubs march into the NLCS with a head of steam, having beaten the teams with the two best records in baseball, the Pirates and Cardinals, in the wild-card game and NLDS, respectively. \nThey will have their top two starters, Jon Lester and Jake Arrieta, rested and ready for Games 1 and 2. And they're playing with house money because no one expected them to get this far, \nSo look for another wild week of October baseball with some things you probably never have seen before. \nWhy should anything change now?", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T06:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T06:45:54.280+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
