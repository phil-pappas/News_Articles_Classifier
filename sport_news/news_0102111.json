Kedar Devdhar (17) and captain Aditya Waghmode (4) were at the crease when stumps were drawn.\nEarlier, playing in his 100th first class match, Tamil Nadu captain Abhinav Mukund opted to bat first and he stayed at the crease for just 10 balls before being out for a duck. Tamil Nadu were 1/1 at that time.\nThere were some hope for the hosts as K Bharath Shankar (28, 115b, 4x4) and Baba Aparajith (44, 90b, 4x4, 2x6) adapted well to the conditions to share 65 runs for the second wicket.\nBut, once Shankar missed the line of the ball to be clean bowled by Bhatt, the floodgates were opened and Tamil Nadu lost eight wickets for the addition of just 59 runs to be all out for 125.\nIn Baroda's reply, the openers were cautious in their approach and gamely negotiated the first six overs. When left-arm spinner Rahil Shah was brought on, Hitesh Solanki miss to read the turn of the ball to be bowled for 5.\nBrief Scores:\nTamil Nadu 1st Innings: 125 all out in 57.4 overs (Baba Aparajith 44; Yusuf Pathan 4/29, Bhargav Bhatt 4/32).\nBaroda 1st Innings: 33 for 1 in 16 overs (Kedar Devdhar 17 batting, Aditya Waghmode 4 batting).
