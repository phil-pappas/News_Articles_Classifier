Martinez almost won the game for the home side but Keylor Navas in the Real goal, who saved an Antoine Griezmann penalty in the first half, managed to tip his shot away. \nBenitez disagreed with a reporter who suggested at the post-match news conference that Real had lacked ambition. \n“No, you have to give credit to Atletico who were intense,” Benitez said. \n“In the first half we were playing to win,” he added. \n“We took the lead and then we made mistakes, with the penalty and the goal. We lacked precision on our counter attacks.” \nBenitez, who brought on fit-again attacking midfielder Gareth Bale in place of playmaker Isco with around half an hour to go, said he had taken Benzema off because he wanted fresh legs on the wing. \nThe draw meant Real missed a chance to go top.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T19:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T07:21:12.774+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
