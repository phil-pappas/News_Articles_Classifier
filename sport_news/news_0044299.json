He was not cocky about how he was playing or how many touchdowns or yards he had. He's the same way now.\"\nJoliet resident Dunn and Plainfield native Ivory Kelly-Martin were looking forward to adding to their trophy shelves last year as sophomores. But Kelly-Martin tore his MCL a week before Nazareth's opener and missed the entire regular season.\n\"It was a huge bummer,\" Ivory Kelly-Martin said. \"Hearing what happened to me and knowing I wouldn't be back was very hard. I was lucky to get a chance to play at the end of the season. I was almost 100 percent, but not fully back.\"\nFortunately for Kelly-Martin, the Roadrunners extended the season by winning five games in the playoffs and capturing their first state championship.\nKelly-Martin returned in the state quarterfinals and, in Nazareth's 26-7 win over Lemont in the Class 6A title game, he rushed for seven yards on two carries and contributed a tackle as a defensive back.\n\"It was special,\" Ivory Kelly-Martin said. \"It was the greatest team I ever played for and it was a dream season finishing 14-0. It was fun for me to play with my brother in that game.\"\nThe 5-foot-10, 170-pound Ivory Kelly-Martin now feels 100 percent healthy and is making up for lost time. He carried for 148 yards and three touchdowns as Nazareth (5-1, 3-1 East Suburban Catholic) beat Benet 33-0 on Friday, Oct. 2, in LaGrange Park.\n\"Being back playing football at Nazareth feels amazing,\" the junior said. \"A lot of people were thinking (the injury) was an ACL, but actually it was my MCL. I didn't need surgery and I came back better than ever.\"\nThrough six games, he's rushed for 930 yards on 81 carries (11.5 yards per carry) and 13 touchdowns.\n\"I'm not surprised at all with his performance after the injury,\" Nazareth coach Tim Racki said. \"I have been up close and personal with all of his rehab work the past year-plus. He's an incredibly mentally tough kid that handled it like a champion. He had to rehab while we were making a state title run, yet he was always on the sideline cheering, encouraging teammates and never once had his head down or felt sorry for himself.\n\"He came back faster and stronger than ever. He's a soft-spoken kid, who is loved by teammates and classmates because of how humble and down to earth he is. His impact has been a game changer for us.\"\nDunn, an offensive lineman and defensive tackle, is glad his friend is back in the lineup.\n\"He's always been like a brother to me,\" Dunn said. \"He's a great player with his speed, agility, quickness and vision. I'll do anything to get him to the end zone. I love being on the field with him because of the type of kid he is.\"\nIvory Kelly-Martin's injury doesn't appear to have hurt his recruitment. He's attracting plenty of attention from Division I programs and has offers from Wisconsin, Illinois State and Indiana State.\nHe said Wisconsin, Notre Dame (where teammate Julian Love has already committed), Northwestern, Iowa State and Vanderbilt are among his top choices. He and Love were in South Bend, Ind., for Notre Dame's 30-22 victory over Georgia Tech on Sept. 22, and he attended a Northwestern game earlier this season.\n\"Recruiting is going really well,\" Kelly-Martin said. \"I'm taking it slow right now.\"\nKen Ryan is a freelance reporter for Pioneer Press.\n High School Football Sports", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-5613dd5b/turbine/ct-dws-nazareth-football-ivory-kelly-martin-tl-1008-20151006"], "published": "2015-10-06T17:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T20:22:21.276+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
