Well, it’s not everyday that a football program let’s a Playboy Playmate into their locker room for a photo shoot. \nBut Miss July 2010 Shanna McLaughlin is a UCF grad, and her recent photo shoot for Axis Magazine inside the UCF locker room has given us the first thing to talk about relating to UCF football since Daunte Culpepper. \nThat’s why I think the UCF A.D. Joe Hornstein is FULL OF IT here \n“An employee without proper authorization allowed access to our football locker room. By the time the video of the shoot was brought to our attention, it had already made its rounds via the internet,” Hornstein’s statement said. \n“Let me make this clear, UCF does not condone the photos and the video. We have spoken to the employee in question and we will speak to our entire staff to make sure that this does not happen again. To any fans who were offended by this, we sincerely apologize.” \nYes, I know Florida is part of the bible belt, and yes America is a country founded by ridiculously uptight Puritans, but that statement is still absurd; I don’t buy it for a minute. As an A.D. your primary job is to grow your program, bring awareness to it, sell it to donors, boosters, alumni and recruits. \nDrawing publicity is the primary way to do so. Granted this story won’t have legs (not legs like Miss McLaughlin anyway) for very long, but this also isn’t Janet Jackson-Justin Timberlake Super Bowl “Nipplegate” either. \nSo I doubt too many people were offended by this which was approved by….wait for it…..Head Coach George O’Leary. \nRemember him? The disgraced Notre Dame head coaching candidate from five years ago. \n“I approved the magazine,” O’Leary told a Sentinel reporter after practice ended Saturday. “The guy called my office and basically wanted to know if they could do a magazine shoot. There was a UCF girl who had her MBA and all that. And the only thing I asked is, ‘Is that a magazine that is distributed on campus?’ And they said, ‘Yes.’ They’ve done I think four, since I’ve been here at least four, initial copies of football [previews] opening up the football season.” \nO’Leary said he was shown a copy of the magazine cover. \n“Eh, it’s not what I expected, but I don’t think there’s anything outlandish on the thing. I never saw the video. \nAnd now for the actual reason you clicked on this post, the video from the Axis magazine shoot. Don’t worry the video is SFW. \nWritten by Paul M.
