Almost all national polls at the moment have the Colts ranked number one.\nA week ago, Coach Tom Heath's runners scored a decisive team victory over other Eastern powers at the Bowdoin Classic Meet in Wappingers Falls, N.Y. Heath kept most of his top racers on the sidelines yesterday at Holmdel Park - keeping them fresh for the big Manhattan College Invitational next Saturday at Van Cortandt Park in New York - but the Colts had more than enough talent to win their Boys Varsity A-1 division race\nby a huge margin.\nHaddon Township's Owen Long (16:20), Eastern Regional's Nicholas Pschunder (16:23) and Hillsborough's Brandon Tubby (16:38) took the 1-2-3 individual medals in this one, but the CBA pack was hard on their heels over the 5,000-meter course that was made far more\ndifficult than usual by the brutal conditions.\nYuro claimed fourth in 16:38) and the entire CBA scoring group crossed the line within 29 seconds - with Joe Boyle seventh (16:48), Genaro Anzalone 10th (1:58), Chris Trigani 11th (17:01) and Matthew Cavallaro 14th (16:58.) All are juniors.\nThat gave CBA a low-low 39-point total, and a total team time of 1:24:32 and an average of 16:54.\nSouthern Regional, led by sophomore Evan Adanatzian (ninth in 16:38), was a distant runner-up in the team race with 111 points, a 1:27:18 total and a 17:27.60 average.\n\"We wanted to kind of hang back in the pack the first mile, then move up, just as usual,\" said Yuro. \"I'm just hoping I make our team running the Manhattan meet.\"\nTwo other Shore squads ran off with team titles in the mega-event that listed 27 races that ran from 9 a.m. to past 5 p.m.\nRed Bank Catholic claimed the girls Varsity D division title with 55 points and a 1:45.39 total, for a 21:07.20 average.\nThe Caseys did it with sophomore Caitlin O'Hare fifth (20:36), senor Louisa Guminski 10th (21:07), sophomore Emily Dunn 11th (21:09) and juniors Melanie Cronk 17th (21:23) and Michelle O'Malley 18th (21:24.) River Dell's 97 points ranked a distant second to the Caseys.\nMater Dei Prep took the Boys Varsity F title with 54 points on a 1:33:10 total and 18:39 average.\nPowering the Seraphs were John Spinelli in fifth (17:49), Justin Vidal 10th (18:30), Pat Osborn 11th (18:31), Nick Roditis 14th (18:47) and Steven Alegretta 30th (19:33), running a strong second in the Girls C event was Rumson-Fair Haven, with 98 points (20 back of winning Summit) as Emily Wellman snared sixth (20:05), Rebecca Ley 17th (20:39), Sarah Nelson 20th (20:52), Julia Tambaro 26th (21:10) and Olivia Rehder 29th (21:24.)\nOnly power-packed Voorhees, running with its top unit, outranked CBA in boys over-all results. Taking the Varsity C title, on a low 22 score, Voorhees ran a total 1:23:22 for a 16:40.4 average.\nTim Bason, West Windsor-Plainsboro South, was quickest of all boys in the meet with his Varsity B win in 15:58 over Toms River North's J.P. Flavin (16:14.) Varsity B winner Ridge was the fastest of all girls squads with a 1:39:43 total and 19:56.50 average. Fastest over-all girl was Mainland Regional's Alyssa Aldridge (18:20.)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T16:07:10.614+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
