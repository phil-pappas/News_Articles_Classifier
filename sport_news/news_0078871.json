Since the dome does bid on the Final Four and host large concerts, cutting a hole in the roof may be out of the question, but a retractable roof made of a material that lets in light would brighten things up considerably.\nPhoto: Ronald Martinez, Getty Images 1.

Bigger video boards\nThe Alamodome features two 24 ft. by 32 ft. video \"walls,\" according to the dome's website.

That game was supposed to make San Antonio look like a phenomenal soccer city and instead the condition of the awful pitch — which was visible even on TV — was so bad that we may never host a national team soccer game again.\n3.

Image 21 of 21 New pro football league eyes Alamodome 1 / 21 Back to Gallery A new professional football league scheduled to begin play in 2016 has contacted the city about leasing the Alamodome , the San Antonio Express-News has learned.\nMike Sawaya , the city official who oversees the dome, said there has been “preliminary discussions” with Major League Football but “no decisions have been made.”\nAccording to its website, MLFB is a “publicly traded, single-entity league” that is the “product of over seven years of planning by former NFL general managers, coaches, players, personnel executives and businessmen that has a singular goal to bring professional football to the public during the spring and early summer of 2016.”\nMLFB’s chief executive officer is Jerry Vainisi, formerly GM of the Chicago Bears and vice president of player personnel with the Detroit Lions . Vainisi helped launch NFL Europe more than 20 years ago.\nThe president of the MLFB is former NFL wide receiver Wes Chandler , who told the Orlando Sentinel in January the idea for the league was hatched seven years ago when he was an assistant coach with the Cleveland Browns .\n“There are a lot of people on the street today, both players and coaches, that can still play but need a little bit more growth,” Chandler told the newspaper.\nFor more, go to ExpressNews.com\ntorsborn@express-news.net\nTwitter: @tom_orsborn", "external_links": ["http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/40/46/05/8544582/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/37/54/24/8308002/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/33/73/21/7320699/15/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/04/70/64/1281326/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/01/43/06/405916/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/40/65/61/8608832/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/40/65/61/8608833/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/40/65/61/8608832/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/33/46/8763825/5/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/40/65/56/8608642/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/15/42/34/3548941/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/35/67/53/7830238/11/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/33/46/8763825/5/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/21/53/75/4636530/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/40/65/56/8608657/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://www.nrg.com/documents/renew/levis_stadium_fact_sheet.pdf", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/40/65/61/8608833/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/21/53/75/4636530/3/920x920.jpg", "http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/columnist/2015/02/15/loveless-solar-power-san-antonio/23384349/", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/15/75/23/3658960/7/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/40/65/56/8608642/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/05/50/01/1474670/5/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/40/46/05/8544582/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/40/65/56/8608657/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/33/53/8764100/4/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/15/75/23/3658960/7/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/40/72/67/8629728/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/40/72/67/8629728/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/20/55/21/4379737/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/35/67/53/7830238/11/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/37/52/40/8300602/4/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/33/53/8764100/4/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/37/54/24/8308002/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/20/55/21/4379737/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/04/70/64/1281326/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/24/36/40/5367812/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/37/52/40/8300602/4/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/01/43/06/405916/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/33/73/21/7320699/15/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/05/50/01/1474670/5/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/15/42/34/3548941/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/24/36/40/5367812/3/920x920.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-09T20:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T20:15:54.918+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
