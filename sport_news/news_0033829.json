No, we're not referring to anyone on City Council. We're talking, rather, about The Portland Building and the trident-wielding statue looming over the front entrance, Portlandia, which turned 30 this week.\nThere was a cake on Thursday . People sang, and local dignitaries milled. Portlandia was back at work on Friday as if nothing had happened, reaching down oddly toward the sidewalk and providing a contrast, in hammered copper, to the cartoon of a building upon which it sits. The Portland Building isn't aging well. Portlandia is.\nThose who work in The Portland Building, designed by famous architect Michael Graves, are said to hate it. It's dark and it leaks. A renovation project of staggering expense is under consideration, but who knows? Maybe the city will sell the thing or (trigger warning, preservationists) tear it down and build something new. Few will miss it.\nBut Portlandia will still be around 30 years from now, though potentially obscured by enormous trees city officials can't bring themselves to cut. People will still be taking pictures through the leaves and realizing, suddenly, that it was a statue long before it was a TV show.\nValley\nPaid parental leave: Multnomah County's commissioners agreed this week to provide up to six weeks of paid leave for new parents, following the lead of similarly situated counties in Washington and California. King County, home of Seattle, offers 12 weeks, as does San Francisco City/County. While employers must offer unpaid parental leave, continuing to compensate people during this time off is still the exception rather than the rule in the United States.\nFor the Multnomah County employees who qualify for the new benefit, this week's vote is certainly a \"peak.\" What new parent wouldn't love to have six weeks of paid leave to bond with a child – or a combined 12 if both parents happen to work for the county? Problem is, benefits aren't free, and the county estimates that its new policy will cost about $1 million per year. The cost can be absorbed easily, the argument goes, because county departments rarely spend all of the money budgeted for their use anyway.\nIf the push to ramp up public-sector benefits in this fashion were to stop with Multnomah County, there wouldn't be much to say. But that's not the way policy escalation works. Politically receptive local governments such as Multnomah County, rather, serve as beachheads, making it much easier for activists and public employees in other counties and cities to argue, \"Multnomah County did it. Why can't you?\"\nMeanwhile, public employees render themselves persuasive by contributing, through their unions, to the campaigns of elected officials. Because those officials pay for new benefits with other people's money – you know, yours – saying \"yes\" can be quite easy. By the time the escalating cost of benefits bumps up against available revenue, they may not even be in office. In any case, what happened in Multnomah County this week may soon happen in counties and cities elsewhere in the state, eventually making paid parental leave a standard benefit for public-sector workers.\nA significant problem with adding new benefits is that Oregon's public sector struggles to pay for the benefits it already offers. At the center of the struggle is the state Public Employees Retirement System, whose burden on schools and other public agencies had become so crippling by 2013 that the Legislature, at the urging of then-Gov. John Kitzhaber, adopted cost-cutting reforms. The most significant would have reduced the rate by which retiree compensation rises every year. The state Supreme Court, composed of PERS members, threw out most of the cost-saving measures this year. The pension bill for public employers, including Multnomah County, could increase by $800 million during the 2017-19 biennium.\nOregonians will hear plenty about the state's dire need for additional revenue in 2016, if, as expected, a public employee-dominated group qualifies a huge business tax hike for the ballot. There will be plenty of rhetoric about predatory corporations who must be punished, er, pay their fair share (the Koch brothers piñata is already taking a beating ).\nAs the demand for higher taxes escalates, voters should keep in mind how it is that public services become so expensive to maintain. It happens one Multnomah County at a time.", "external_links": ["http://ouroregon.org/attention-koch-brothers-we-want-our-25-million-back/", "http://portlandtribune.com/pt/9-news/274541-150253-report-state-local-governments-face-jump-in-pension-contributions"], "published": "2015-10-09T23:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T02:09:32.369+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
